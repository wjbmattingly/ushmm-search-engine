And we\u2019re going to\nstart the interview at the very beginning, so I\u2019m going to want to know about your\nchildhood, your background.

        "A: Juozapas, or in English, Joseph Ugianskis. And he was sent to Italy to attend a\ncavalry school in Pinerolo, Italy. Of course my mother was with him because he\nspent several years there. And on November 18, 1929, I was born in Italy.\nInteresting enough, it was on Sunday, and they couldn\u2019t get ahold of any medical\npeople, so my dad called his \u2014 the doctor, the veterinarian that he knew. And I was\ndelivered in Pinerolo, Italy by a veterinarian. Anyway, when he was asked how\ndifficult it was, his answer was, it\u2019s a hell of a lot smaller than a horse.February 18, 2013",
        "Q: It\u2019s unusual for two reasons: that a Lithuanian is born in Italy, and two, that he\u2019s\ndelivered by a veterinarian.",

        "A: Well, I\u2019m not exactly sure, but I would think probably sometime between \u201928\nand \u00b030.",
        "Q: Okay. So, in 1930 you come back to Lithuania, and you probably have no\nmemories of Italy.",
        "A: Very foggy. In fact, when I visited Pinerolo some years ago, I recognized the\nplace where I was being carried around.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. But that\u2019s all that I remembered about it.",
        "Q: Okay. Were you the only child in the family?",
        "A: No, I\u2014 my \u2014 my parents had six children. The oldest one died shortly after birth,\nthen I was the next, Cesare, born in Italy. Then my brother Roman, who was born\nin Lithuania, in Kaunas. And then a sister was born, her name was Ligeia. And\nunfortunately she died from one of the diseases that was spreading around, maybeFebruary 18, 2013\ntyphus or something like that. Or diphtheria. Anyway, she died at the age of five.\nAnd then my brother Joseph, Joe was born in Lithuania. So he was 10 years\nyounger than I. And then a year later or so my sister was born, Grazina. She, and\nwe all ended up in the United States, as a family.",
        "Q: Di\u2014 were you growing up, after you returned from Italy in Kaunas, in the\ncapital city at the time?",

        "A: Okay, well, I think he was born in 19 \u2014 I\u2019m sorry 1893. And there\u2019s a confusion\nabout the date because it was at that time there was the old calendar, that was\nchanged later. So I think his birthday is on the 18\" of January in 19 \u2014 I mean, 1893.",
        "Q: And he grew up in Lithuania?",
        "A: In Kaunas, he grew up in Kaunas, and after they \u2014 Lithuania fought for its\nindependence in 19 \u2014 1819, he was a volunteer in that army.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He never talked about his years that he served in the \u2014 in the fight for the\nLithuanian independence. The \u2014 the only thing that I remember about it, that he wasFebruary 18, 2013\ngiven a\u2014a medal which is called Wikyas(ph) kryZius. But essentially it\u2019s the same\nkind of thing that we have Medal of Honor.",
        "Q: And what was that for?",
        "A: It was for his bravery fighting in the \u2014 in the \u2014 with the Polish and Russian\ntroops.",
        "Q: Okay. So, from the tsar\u2019s army, after World War I ends, that\u2019s when Lithuania\nstarts fighting for independence?",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 volunteer, essentially.February 18, 2013",
        "Q: A volunteer, okay.",
        "A: And then he \u2014 when the war was \u2014 I mean, Lithuania gained its independence,\nhe ended up going to military school, and became an officer in the Lithuanian army.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And after that, he continued to serve.",
        "Q: And your mother? Tell us a little bit about her. Where was she born, what was\nher name?",
        "A: Okay, my mother was born in a small village along the Nemunas river,\nPloksciai. Her father was a very successful lawyer in Lithuania and he had a large\nestate in that little town. And when I was on my way, they were in Ploksciai, in that\nlittle town and was delivered there, and th-they \u2014 they \u2014 I mean, she was born there.\nAnd I-I think she was born in 1906, but I don\u2019t remember the date.",

        "A: And \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember the estate? Do you remember the estate?",

        "A: And essentially my \u2014 my dad was a military fa \u2014 my \u2014 my family was a military\nfamily, so we moved around. And I remember living in the place called\nMyampoli(ph). That\u2019s where \u2014 the first place I remember I lived. Then I lived in\nAlytus, and then we moved to Kaunas. And when in 1940, when the Russians\nessentially occupied Lithuania and Lithuania became the Socialist Republic, my\nfather was dra \u2014 transferred into the Red Army. So he became a lieutenant colonel\nin the Red Army.",
        "Q: Well, here\u2019s \u2014 I have a question about that, and I\u2019Il ask it now, and then we\u2019ll go\nback a little bit to your \u2014",
        "A: Okay.February 18, 2013",
        "Q: \u2014 to your childhood. Things like that happened, but it sounds to me rather\nunusual, because many army officers, many professional military men were actually\narrested by the Soviets. So how 1s it that he wasn\u2019t \u2014 not only not it \u2014 wasn\u2019t he\narrested, but he becomes a military officer in the Soviet army\u201d?",
        "A: Well, because he never was involved in politics.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And his father was a policeman that was killed by the Germans during World\nWar I. And so essentially, he came from a simple family, and he was born in a little\ntown on \u2014 on \u2014 along the Nemunas river. And he spoke very good Russian, because\nhe lived in Russia for years too, being \u2014 being \u2014 being in the service. So essentially,\nhe wasn\u2019t arrested, but we found out that when \u2014 when the German occupied\nLithuania in 1941, we found out that we are in a \u2014 the family was on a list to be\ndeported to Siberia next week.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So it didn\u2019t matter that he would have been a Soviet army officer?",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s what I heard.February 18, 2013",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I mean, I didn\u2019t see any paper or anything, because at that time I was too young\nto decipher anything, I was essentially \u2014 in 1941 I was 11 years old.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Or in 1940.",
        "Q: So when \u2014 when you were growing up, and you moved around in different\nplaces, was there something that was different between \u2014 you felt was different\nbetween your family and other kids?",
        "A: Yes, because we always have to make new friends. So it\u2019s just kind of different,\nbut we \u2014 we adapted to that very quickly. It didn\u2019t really bother us. Because\nessentially we moved \u2014 we really moved with the army, you know, it wasn\u2019t like a\nnew job or something. It was just o-officer being moved to a \u2014 getting another\nassignment.",
        "Q: In a different place.",
        "A: Yeah, in a different place, so we just \u2014",

        "Q: Okay, and did you \u2014 did you have any friends who were Jews, did you have any\nfriends who were Germans, did you \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes, we \u2014 our neighbors. The \u2014 my grandmother\u2019s neighbors were\nLithuanian Jews. And \u2014",

        "Q: Where did your grandmother live?",
        "A: Oh, she lived in Kaunas.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And she was friends with them, and they had some children there and so I would\n\u2014 when I would visit my grandmother, I would play with them. And then, of course,\nthey disappeared in 1941.",

        "Q: Okay. Did you remember your parents talking about \u2014 you say your father\nwasn\u2019t very political, but do you remember your parents talking about history or\npolitics, or what was going on in the world?",
        "A: Well, some of it, but not \u2014 not anything that I remember as a \u2014 as an outstanding\nthing. My father was pretty adept at getting along with the government.",

        "Q: \u2014 because there had been a Jewish relative.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, because there was a Jewish relative, and so nobody talked about it,\nand people that knew didn\u2019t bring it up anywhere.February 18, 2013",
        "Q: I see. Even though it could have been in the ni \u2014 in the 19\" century.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: That Jews, you know, take ad \u2014 take advantage of s \u2014 of \u2014 of Lithuanians. That\nwas sort of an idea that was spread. I think in fact th-they \u2014 the Lithuanians were\nvery tolerant, because in 1300s, Jews came to Lithuania because they were being\nevicted from England and Germany and Austria. And they came to Poland,\nLithuania, because at that time Lithuanians themselves were \u2014 weren\u2019t Christians.February 18, 2013\nVery tolerant, they were pagans, you know. And so th \u2014 Lithuania lived with those\nJews until u \u2014 udi \u2014 unification with Poland, in \u2014 I think in 1500s. And that\u2019s when\nJesuits come in, and they the ones that spread all those bad stories about the Jews.",

        "Q: Those were the sorts of things that you\u2019d hear growing up?",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And that they were stealing things from people, you know, they were really bad\npeople. Of course, all it was, jealousy, because Jews were organized well, they were\nwell educated. And there were \u2014 of course there were poor Jews too, but \u2014 but \u2014 but\nlot of them were \u2014 were well educated people. In fact, you know, there were\nrestrictions, you know, in the professions, like [indecipherable] get in. For\nexample, they couldn\u2019t own land.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: They weren\u2019t allowed to own land.",
        "Q: In independent Lithuania?",

        "Q: And later they were allowed.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah, mm-hm.",
        "A: But at first, no. And in general, it was idea that the Jews in general were taking\nadvantage of people, so you had to be careful of them. That was sort of negative I\nremember.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Do you \u2014",
        "A: On the other hand, on the other hand, there were good Jews that were friends of\nmy parents, you know.",
        "Q: So that your parents socialized with different \u2014 different groups of people, not\njust \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Oh yeah, when \u2014 when he was growing up, there was Jewish people\nwho were living there next door to them. So \u2014February 18, 2013",
        "Q: Did your parents talk about their friends who were different nationalities much,\nor is it just you knew them, this was \u2014 this was this person, this was that person, and\nso on?",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure how to answer that, but my parents essentially weren\u2019t very anti-\nSemitic in many ways, I would say. They were very tolerant and they would just\nshrug it off.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t remember really my mother or father badmouthing Jews.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 do you have memories of going to school before the war?",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",

        "A: Yes. He was an officer\u2019s son, too.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And are you still friends?",
        "A: Oh yeah. We see them all the time.",

        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: So, I mean that is unusual, you know, from \u2014",

        "Q: And they\u2019re here too?",
        "A: And he lives here too. And there\u2019s another friend of mine that I went to \u2014 I mean,\nI start to go to high school in 1941, probably, we started together. And in fact, when\nw \u2014 when \u2014 when \u2014 when we lived in Germany, DP camps, we met up again and\nwe finished high school together in Germany.",

        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Becau \u2014 and we\u2019ll have lunch. And we\u2019ll come back to the parts where you did\nsee things.February 18, 2013",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay? We\u2019ll come back to that after lunch.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay, yeah.\n[break]",
        "Q: This is a continuation of our interview on February 18\", 2013, with Mr. Cesare\nUgianskis. And when we broke off before, we were talking about 1941 \u2014 1942 in\nKaunas, you had heard of \u2014 you had s \u2014 heard of neighbors of your grandmother\u2019s\nwho were Jews, who were brought to Vilijampole Slobodka, to what became the\nghetto. You found out soon thereafter that Jews were being taken an-and shot at\nvarious places around the city. Can you tell us a little bit about the geography of\nKaunas, and what were the old forts that were there, that ended up being execution\nplaces?",
        "A: Well, I'll tell you what I know, or at least I think I know. Kaunas was a city in\nLithuania that was populated by Lithuanians, and about 30 percent, I believe, at\none time, was Jewish.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And my parents \u2014 my \u2014 my p \u2014 my father\u2019s parents lived in Kaunas, my\ngrandfather \u2014 my \u2014 my grandfather was a police officer. And in 1918 or so, when he\nFebruary 18, 2013\nwas arrested by the Germans, he was killed in a POW camp. So I never met him or\nher \u2014 or \u2014 or saw him. And after that, what can I say? We moved to Kaunas,\nbecause my father was transferred from Alytus to Kaunas in 1939. And soon after\nwe arrived in 1940, Russians came in.",
        "Q: Well, what I\u2019d like to do if you \u2014 if you have memories of this, or knowledge of\nthis, Kaunas, from what I \u2014 or Kovno, as it is known in Yiddish, is ringed, or th \u2014\naround the city is ringed by a series of forts. That\u2019s not usual for most European\ncities.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Can you tell us about which \u2014 what was the historical basis of these forts?",
        "A: Well, it was done by Catherine the Great.",
        "Q: Okay, so tell us about these forts.",
        "A: Well, all I know about it is the fact that there are about, I think, 12 of them\nsurrounding Kaunas. That\u2019s essentially when \u2014 when \u2014 when I was alive, some of\nthem had certain \u2014 certain uses. Like the fort where we lived, fort five was storage.\nThere are a lot of \u2014 military storage, workers \u2014",
        "Q: What did \u2014 what did a fort look like? I mean, sometimes people will imagine a\nfort as being an entire complex where people even live in it. What were these forts?\nWere they like towers, or were they like \u2014February 18, 2013",
        "A: No, they \u2014 they\u2019re \u2014 interesting enough, they were level ground.",
        "Q: They were on level ground.",
        "A: Level ground, and they had water surrounding them, th-they had a \u2014 whatever\nyou call that.",
        "Q: A moat? A moat?",
        "A: Yes, a moat surrounding it. And inside they had the quarters and they had\nweapons, artillery and so on. But I don\u2019t think that very many people lived there.\nThere lived, surrounding the fort, they had \u2014 they had buildings, and the fort that I\nremember was fort number four, fort number five, fort number nine. These are the\nthree forts that I remember because they\u2019re connected with \u2014 with the history in\nsome ways, for me.",
        "Q: Okay, is it possible to give \u2014 [interruption]",
        "A: So, the other forts, I don\u2019t know what they were used for, but number \u2014 and \u2014\nand that\u2019s right, and there was number six, I think, that was used as a prison.\nNumber nine \u2014",
        "Q: You told me before the ole \u2014 before the war.",
        "A: Before the war, yeah.",
        "Q: Before World War II.",
        "A: In fact, in fact, they never were used for military purposes, because \u2014February 18, 2013",
        "Q: So Catherine the Great had built them.",
        "A: They built them, they were just \u2014 sat there, because nobody attacked Kaunas,\nnobody needed them. And so it was really probably a great waste of \u2014 of \u2014 of tsar\u2019s\nmoney to build them, but they build them, and as I say, when I was living in\nLithuania they were used as prisons and storage u \u2014 places. And \u2014",
        "Q: About how big would these forts be?",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "Q: About how big would these complexes be, these fort complexes?",
        "A: O-Okay, let me see, how ca \u2014 how to describe it? Well, it\u2019s probably \u2014 diameter\non it probably was ha-half a kilometer, 500 meters or so.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And they \u2014 they \u2014 they had these build-ups, you know, in \u2014 in-inside, you know,\nin and out. The kind of stuff, you know, that would protect from somebody firing at\nyou.",
        "Q: Were they underground? Were they underground, too? Did they \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, there was some underground stuff, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Were they tall?",
        "A: No, they weren\u2019t tall, no.",
        "Q: Were they \u2014 were they brick?February 18, 2013",
        "A: No, they were \u2014 had some \u2014 they had some above, you know, they \u2014 but \u2014 but\nthey weren\u2019t very tall.",
        "Q: The materials that they were built from, was it brick, was it stone?",
        "A: They had brick, brick and cement, yeah. And \u2014 and ce \u2014 and iron. Iron was \u2014 was\none of the things that they were using there. The gates, and \u2014 e-entrance to the fort,\nat \u2014 at \u2014 at least the number four and five had this huge steel wall, steel fence that\nthey opened ev \u2014 to get in and ge \u2014 get out.",
        "Q: Could you see through that steel fence, or was it \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, no, you could see right through it, you could see the bild \u2014 the building.\nIn fact, there were some quarters there and storage places, right \u2014 right after the\nentrance, so they could come in with the vehicles, unload them, you know, and so\non. But then, the rest of 1t was all in and out, you know, it was just \u2014 just a lot of ins\n\u2014 for \u2014 for mounting weapons, for looking through, you know. And even when I\nthink about it now, I\u2019m not sure what \u2014 what they would have done with them, even\nif they were attacked.",
        "Q: Okay. Well, being built by Catherine the Great would have been that they had\nbeen around for a couple of hundred years already, and the weaponry was \u2014 was of\na different kind.February 18, 2013",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right, exactly. So anyway, so that\u2019s what I remember about\nthose forts. And the one that I\u2019m most acquainted is number five, because we lived\nabout 200 feet from \u2014 200 meters from \u2014 from the fort.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: My father had a house built there on a five hectare land, it\u2019s like 15 acres. And\nso we used to go and play there.",
        "Q: At the fort?",
        "A: At the fort.",
        "Q: Okay, were you allowed inside?",
        "A: Oh, we \u2014 kids, you know, could get in anywhere.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So \u2014so we\u2019d go in there and at one time when \u2014 when \u2014 in 1941, when Germans\nattacked Russia, we went in there and there was th \u2014 there was a food storage there.\nAnd I remember loading ourselves up with cans of \u2014 of vegetables and goods, you\nknow, food, because there was \u2014 full of it there. And people \u2014 whole neighborhood,\nyou know, was coming in and going out with \u2014 with goodies.",
        "Q: Was this \u2014 this had been \u2014 had it been during the Soviet occupation, that is, they\nhad stored canned goods there?",
        "A: That\u2019s right.February 18, 2013",
        "Q: And as they were retreating, people came in?",
        "A: That\u2019s right, they left it all, and so \u2014",
        "Q: They left it all.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And so the ge \u2014 before the Germans could \u2014 could even take care of it, people\nwere already in there and taking things out.",
        "Q: Cleaning it out.",
        "A: Yeah, including me.",
        "Q: Yeah. Were these forts always under some sort of governmental or municipal\ncontrol?",
        "A: Oh yes, all the time, yes.",
        "Q: Okay, so they\u2019ve never been privatized?",
        "A: No, they just \u2014 I\u2019m not sure if the other forts were wide open like the fifth one\nwas. Fourth one, of course, was always kind of closed up because they always had\nthe \u2014 I think something going on, you know, with \u2014 with prisons or something like\nthat. But \u2014",
        "Q: How could they be used as prisons? Did they have \u2014",
        "A: Well, they had quarters, you know, for housing soldiers.February 18, 2013",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And so \u2014 so that\u2019s what they did, you know, they used the quarters as prison.\nAnd fort number nine and I think six, were prisons. And \u2014 and then in the end\nactually, number five, this is where the most of the Jews were killed.",
        "Q: In fort number five?",
        "A: Nine.",
        "Q: In fort number nine.",
        "A: Number nine. This is where most of the Jews were killed. And then some of\nthem were killed in number five \u2014 number four.",
        "Q: Okay, tell me about that. About those that \u2014 that you knew of and saw.",
        "A: Okay, well, you know, as I mentioned earlier, my father was a director of a \u2014 of\na sawmill, which was on a river in the \u2014 in the \u2014 Kaunas. And I can \u2014",
        "Q: We can look at that, mm-hm.",
        "A: \u2014 show you here.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So-",
        "Q: We\u2019re going to show the map of Kaunas to begin with.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Right here is a small map of the Kaunas city and region. Can you see that?\nFebruary 18, 2013\nQ2: Do you want us to shoot quality inserts later, and then you just talk?",
        "Q: Let\u2019s just do this now, and maybe we\u2019ll do that later, but \u2014 but for right now \u2014\ncan you see it? Okay, so this is how the river bends, and forts are around the various\nperim \u2014 the perimeter of the city. Now, the next printout that we\u2019re going to look at\nis \u2014 what river is this?",
        "A: This is Nemunas.",
        "Q: That\u2019s the Nemunas, or Nemun(ph) river.",
        "A: Nemo(ph) \u2014 Nemo(ph) or Nemun(ph).",
        "Q: Yeah, Nemun(ph) river.\nQ2: Can you back up a little so your \u2014 your audio \u2014 I\u2019m hearing you better.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: Number five is where I lived and number four, this is where we \u2014 where they\nwere using as a prison.",
        "Q: So this is number four? Oh n \u2014 this is actually, you have 14 and 15.",
        "A: No, four and five.\nQ2?: It\u2019s an X and a\u2014",
        "Q: It\u2019s an X anda-\u2014andal V.",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s \u2014 I \u2014 just making location.",
        "Q: Okay, so that\u2019s just location.February 18, 2013",
        "A: The X is location.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s fort number four and then fort number five. And you lived near fort\nnumber five.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, I lived near fort number five.",
        "Q: Have you got that?",
        "A: And we were probably about a mile or so apart.",
        "Q: Okay, and then here \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s the same map.",
        "Q: Okay, Kaunas.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Is the same map.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And then what\u2019s the dif \u2014 what\u2019s the last one? That\u2019s much \u2014 close up.",
        "A: And here is a closer look. This is where my father\u2019s sawmill was, and this is\nwhere the fort was.",
        "Q: Okay, that\u2019s \u2014 so here is a close-up of fort number four, the edge of the river,\nwhere Mr. Ugianskis\u2019 \u2014 where the circle is in pencil is where his father\u2019s sawmill\nwas, and the circle of number four is where the fort was. Got that? Okay, so tell us\nwhat \u2014 what did \u2014 what was going on there at fort number four?\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "A: Okay, well, at one \u2014 this is during the summer now, so we\u2019re loose, on summer\nvacation. And so for nothing better to do, we used to come and visit my father in the\n\u2014 in the sawmill, and go in swimming in the river. And so along the river one time, I\n\u2014 coming in from \u2014 toward us, along the river Nemunas, we saw this \u2014 this huge\ncrowd moving. And we said, well, let\u2019s take a look what it is. So wen \u2014 we went up\nthere, and what it was, it was actually most people were ha \u2014 we-wearing the yellow\nDavid star, meaning that they were Jews. And they were young people and young \u2014\nand \u2014 and small children, and ladies and \u2014 and men, older men mostly. And they\nwere marching towards [indecipherable] towards number four fort. So we decided\nto follow them, and so we saw them move this huge crowd into the fort. And then\nwe kind of cut behind there and we stood on the outside edge of the moat, and we\ncould see inside. And we saw this \u2014 these people in a single row, moving in, and\nthrowing in their belongings in a pile.",
        "Q: So, in other words, outside of the fort, there was an elevation that was even\nhigher than the \u2014 than the walls of the fort itself?",
        "A: That\u2019s right, a little bit higher, yes.",
        "Q: And you could stand on that and \u2014 and look in?",
        "A: Outside?",
        "Q: Yeah.February 18, 2013",
        "A: No, no, that was lower, that \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 where we were standing was lower.\nThere were higher places in the fort itself.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But we were looking down in the fort from the moat.",
        "Q: I see, okay.",
        "A: And so we were looking down in the fort, and we could see this single row of\npeople going and throwing in whatever they were carrying with them, you know.\nAnd \u2014",
        "Q: Were they undressing?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t really think they were undressing there, I think they undressed\nlater. But \u2014 but they were throwing in their goods there. And then they marched in\nthere and after awhile, we started hearing gunfire, you know, and we realized what\nwas going on, they were shooting them. And all of a sudden we saw this guard tar \u2014\nrunning toward us, you know, coming toward us. So we realized that they don\u2019t\nwant us here. So we started running and they kept on yelling stop, and we just took\noff. And of course, you know, being younger and faster, just took off and knew \u2014\nwe knew where we were going, they didn\u2019t. And so we escaped. But \u2014 but that\u2019s\nwhen we realized that that\u2019s what it was, you know, this is \u2014 probably \u2014 I guess this\ni\u2014 this was probably early August of 1941.February 18, 2013",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And then, you know, we sort of heard that there were some more shootings there\nafter that, but not very much. But there were continuous shooting apparently going\non in fort number nine. I mean, we heard about it. We couldn\u2019t hear, but we heard\nabout it. Well anyway, what happened then was that, let\u2019s see, about 1944, about\nFebruary, the Germans got a whole bunch of Russian war pr \u2014 prisoners of war, and\nthey were starting to dig up \u2014 that\u2019s what we heard from other people, I didn\u2019t see it\n\u2014 that they were digging up the bodies, putting them in piles and setting them on\nfire. Well, what I remember about that was that when the wind was downwin \u2014 we\nwere \u2014 lived downwind, we got this horrible smell of human bodies burned \u2014\nburning.",
        "Q: So \u2014 so was it the si \u2014 entire city was covered with this wind?",
        "A: No, no, no, just \u2014 just toward our for \u2014 toward \u2014 toward us [indecipherable] the\nfifth fort.",
        "Q: And did you \u2014 and you knew that that\u2019s what it was?",
        "A: Oh sure. We heard about it from people. Here is \u2014 here\u2019s where \u2014 where we\nwere, okay?",
        "Q: Okay. Let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s turn the paper a little bit like this, okay?",
        "A: Okay. Here is where we were, okay?February 18, 2013",
        "Q: Right, at the bend of that river at the bottom.",
        "A: And the fort is right here, okay? And the fifth fort is right here. So when the\nwind would come this way, we would get the smell \u2014 the smoke, actually.",
        "Q: Where was the ninth fort? Show us with your finger where the ninth fort was.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: The one where the burning body \u2014",
        "A: The ninth fort \u2014 ninth fort is here.",
        "Q: I see, so it\u2019s to the northeast \u2014 northwest, excuse me.",
        "A: Yeah, northwest, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 yeah, it\u2019s northwest.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s tur \u2014 yeah, let\u2019s turn the page so it\u2019s around there, can you get that?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, so the nor \u2014 fort \u2014 number nine f-fort \u2014 fort number nine 1s there.",
        "Q: Is someplace right \u2014 right here, you said?",
        "A: Right there, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. Right there would be where fort number nine was, and as the bodies were\nbeing burned, they were \u2014",
        "A: No, not in nine, in fort number for \u2014 for \u2014 four being burned.",
        "Q: Oh, I see, they were burned in fort number four as well.",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s what I mean, that\u2019s what we witnessed.",
        "Q: Oh, I see, I see.February 18, 2013",
        "A: What we witnessed was at \u2014 what was happening in number four.",
        "Q: Okay. I understood that, but I also know that in 1944 \u2014",
        "A: Yes, right.",
        "Q: \u2014 there were bodies being burned everywhere.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s right, but \u2014 but \u2014 but they were burning them in a \u2014 number four fort\nand we were getting the wind.",
        "Q: I got it.",
        "A: Because we \u2014 they were here and we lived here.",
        "Q: Got it.",
        "A: And so the \u2014 the wind would come right down toward us, you know, and I never\nforget that smell. It\u2019s just incredible. So that\u2019s my experience with \u2014 with watching\npeople led to execution. I \u2014 I \u2014 we didn\u2019t see the actual shooting because it was\ninside the fort.",
        "Q: What did you see through, did you see through the gateway? Or through\nwindows?",
        "A: No, no, we were standing on the \u2014 on the outside on the moat and looking in.",
        "Q: So, but in through what? Was it an open area?",
        "A: It\u2019s an open area in the fort.",
        "Q: Ah.February 18, 2013",
        "A: See, they marched them in, then they walked through some tunnel, and they\ncame in through this open area, and they marched them through this open area to\nthe other side. And this is where they were killing those people, on the other side.",
        "Q: I see. Did you hear screams?",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "Q: Did you hear anybody scream?",
        "A: No, no, no, we were too far from that.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Beth \u2014 but we could hear the firing. We couldn\u2019t see the actual execution, but we\nsaw people going in, you know, in a \u2014 in a single row, throwing in their things and\njust marching in there.",
        "Q: And you saw children as well?",
        "A: Oh yeah, there were children and then women, and then \u2014 then old men, mostly.",
        "Q: Do you \u2014 I mean, would you have any recollection about how large a group of\npeople this might have been\u2019?",
        "A: Well, it was thousands, probably.",
        "Q: Really?",

        "A: Well, the Ukrainian, if I remember, was light \u2014 lighter color than Lithuanian.\nLithuanian was dark green, and the Ukrainian uniforms were lighter greenish or\nbluish, as I remember it.",
        "Q: Wa \u2014 okay, the dark green of the Lithuanians, was that the normal army uniform\nfrom independent Lithuania?",

        "A: Oh, I\u2019m sure it was German \u2014 German created.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Or German by \u2014 created by German orders, because during the fort \u2014 between\n41 and 44, the Germans had organized battalions an-and regiments out of the\nLatvians and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and Estonians. And they had SS [indecipherable].\nLithuanians didn\u2019t agree to that. They were called savisagorse(ph), self-defense\nforce.",
        "Q: Right.February 18, 2013",
        "A: And \u2014 and that\u2019s the way it was, you know, and so the self-defense force was \u2014\nwas participating in the \u2014 in executions and \u2014 and they were all over the place, you\nknow.",
        "Q: I guess what I\u2019m trying to find out is whether or not, as members of the self-\ndefense battalion, whether they were wearing the uniforms from independent\nLithuania.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: No, no, they were wearing something modified.",
        "Q: Did you, as kids, after this, did you talk about it amongst yourselves? Did you\ntell your parents what it was that you saw?",
        "A: Oh yeah, we told our parents, you know, and no, I don\u2019t remember talking much\nabout it. I just don\u2019t remember mu-much talk.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 was that the one time you saw live people go in and know that they\nare being killed during the war?",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s the only place, the only time I saw it.",
        "Q: So, did you ever see any other people during the German occupation be shot or\nkilled?",
        "A: No.February 18, 2013",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I think we stayed away from all those. See, we lived on the\noutskirts, number four \u2014 five fort 1s on the outskirt of Kaunas and it was pretty\nempty there. You know, there was a couple of \u2014 like I want to say five homes\nprobably, around where I lived, you know, and so nobody went by there.",
        "Q: How did life progress for your family during these occupation years, between\n41 and \u00b044?",
        "A: Well, actually wasn\u2019t as bad as it could have, because my father had a good job,\nand he provided money to buy food for us on the black market. So we \u2014 we wou \u2014\nmy mother would go to Shaunshai(ph), to the black market there and buy food for\nthe money my father had.",
        "Q: Well, you had a pretty big family.",
        "A: Well, yeah. So we actually, I m\u2014I must admit, I think we lived, during the 1941\nthrough \u201944, I\u2019d say we lived better than average, for sure. My family.",
        "Q: Okay. Uh-huh. What started happening about \u00b044?\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "A: Okay, well, all of a sudden, you know, we \u2014 front kept on advancing, you know.\nOn the radio we could hear that the \u2014 that the Russians were now at the Ukraine\nand Russians were now in Belarus, you know. And then we could \u2014 started to hear\nthe echoes of the \u2014 of the weapons, you know, the cannons. We could hear cannons\nfiring and exploding. And so, my father realized that there\u2019s no way for us to stay\nbecause essentially he\u2019s a deserter from the Red Army. So what can we do? So my\nfather fou-found some friends in the self-defense force, who issued him some sort\nof a paper that \u2014 that would allow us to go through the border into Germany.",
        "Q: So, was this the same self-defense force that had been taking \u2014 was this the same\nself-defense force \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 that would have taken part in these executions?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, the same \u2014 same people.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So anyway, so they took us to Dresden, Germany. But my father was supposed\nto go back, and become a commander in the f \u2014 some town or something. But, on\nthe way there, Russians occupied Lithuania, so he came back, and we ended up\nworking in a factory, Seidel Naumann factory that you \u2014 before the war used to\nmake sewing machines, right now was making pieces for \u2014 for military purposes. In\nFebruary 18, 2013\nfact, I was, at that time, you know, 14 years old, and I was working in a factory with\na machine, that were parts being made together for \u2014 for the submarines.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s \u2014 and so anyway \u2014 and then we got bombed out.",
        "Q: While you were in Dresden\u2019?",
        "A: Yeah. And we got bombed out and then we moved to a little town outside\nDresden, Dippoldiswalde.",
        "Q: How is it \u2014 what was it called?",
        "A: Dip-Dippoldiswalde.",
        "Q: Portiswilder?",
        "A: Di-Dippoldiswalde.",
        "Q: Dippoldiswalde, mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah. Which is closer to the Czech border.",
        "Q: Tell us a little bit about the bombing of Dresden. You were in the middle of the\ntown, or was the factory on the side?",
        "A: No, we were on the outside \u2014 on the side.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Oh, the buildings were destroyed.",
        "Q: Oh, so \u2014February 18, 2013",
        "A: The factory, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Your factory was destroyed.",
        "A: Oh yeah, our buildings are destroyed, so that\u2019s why we had to move out to\nsomewhere else. And so my father found a job as a\u2014 as a hofmeister.",
        "Q: What\u2019s a hofmeister?",
        "A: The \u2014 the guy responsible for \u2014 for the upkeep of the yard.",
        "Q: Upkeep of what kind of a yard?",
        "A: Factory yard.",
        "Q: A factory yard.",
        "A: Ye-Ye \u2014 yeah, right. You see, they \u2014 they were making also some sort of\nmilitary parts. And I got a job there as a \u2014 as a apprentice in \u2014 in their apprentice\nschool, metalworking apprentice school. And so we were working there until we \u2014\nagain we heard the guns firing around, you know, and we started going toward\nGermany, trying to go south, you know, to \u2014 to get to \u2014 to the western forces,\nbecause my father didn\u2019t want to get overrun by the Russians, you know.",
        "Q: Okay. I want to stop just a little bit.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Did you see any part of the bombing of Dresden? Did you see any part of the\nbombing of Dresden?February 18, 2013",
        "A: Oh yeah, I saw \u2014",
        "Q: Tell us what you saw.",
        "A: I came back to Dresden about \u2014 I would say about two weeks after the \u2014 the\nhuge bombings. And in fact, my brother and I. And we walked down to the center\nof the town. And there was this pile, you know, covered up with burlaps, you know,\nand \u2014 and we thought, what the hell is this? So we went to take a look. It was a pile\nprobably six meters high, so \u2014 so like 18 feet or so, of bodies. Dead bodies. Burned\nbodies, but dead bodies, just a pile.",
        "Q: And nothing was being done, they were being burned, or \u2014",
        "A: Well, they were just sitting there, they were \u2014 obviously they got collected, but\nno \u2014 but you know, they were probably digging out other people too, you know. But\nthat\u2019s what we saw. And we walked around, and we just couldn\u2019t believe you know,\nall those beautiful buildings, they\u2019re all gone, you know, in the center of \u2014 of\nDresden. And so we of course came back \u2014 came back to Dippoldiswalde the same\nday.",
        "Q: But I \u2014 again I want to stay with this a bit. You were still on the outskirts of\nDresden as it was being bombed?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What \u2014 were you in a house, were you in a cellar?February 18, 2013",
        "A: No, I\u2014 no, no, I was in a plant.",
        "Q: And it was being bombed, that plant.",
        "A: Yes, yes. And the building above us collapsed, but lucky for us, it didn\u2019t break\nthrough down to the basement. So we were able to walk out after the building\ncollapsed, but didn\u2019t collapse into the basement. And so we came out of the\nbasement when the fire was burning around.",
        "Q: And was it only the workers of the factory who were there, or whole families?",
        "A: Well most \u2014 my \u2014 my \u2014 my mother was there, she was injured. As a matter of\nfact, my mother was somewhere else because we were at work, so we were\nsomewhere else. And so we came home in the day, we couldn\u2019t find our mother. So,\nfew days later we started looking for her. And so we walked in on one of the nearer\nhospitals and sure enough we found her in hallway. She already had gangrene set in\non her leg, but luckily not far enough, and we got the doctors to take care of her so\n\u2014 so sh \u2014 they didn\u2019t have to amputate her leg or anything, so she survived the\nbombing. She\u2019s the only one in our family that was hurt during the World War II.",
        "Q: And it was at the bombing of dre \u2014 Dresden?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: You survived \u2014 you survived the bombing.February 18, 2013",
        "Q: And your brothers and sisters also?",
        "A: Oh yeah, they were with mother, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because you know, I was \u2014 i1-in Dresden I was 14 years old. So my younger\nbrother was four years old, my younger sister was three years old. So they were\nwith the mother, but somehow they got back to the camp, you know, where we were\n\u2014 th-the barracks, where we were stationed.\n[break]",
        "A: \u2014 mother was gone and we couldn\u2019t quite get out of these kids what happened to\nmom.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They took her away, you know. That\u2019s about all they could tell us.",
        "Q: Okay. So you must have been frightened until you found her.",
        "A: Oh, it was.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It was. So finally we found \u2014 found her and \u2014 and lucky for us, you know, she \u2014\nshe survived, and \u2014 and so that\u2019s the part that I remember vividly. And then, of\ncourse, when we were living in Dippoldiswalde, nobody was bombing us there.February 18, 2013\nBut a couple of times we actually had the planes, American planes flying over in the\ndaytime and strafing them, you know, from the air fr \u2014 shooting at \u2014 on the ground.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: In fact, one time I \u2014 I\u2014 I was on the road when they were running out shooting,\nand I thought they probably shooting at me, but they didn\u2019t. Probably saw it was a\nkid, you know, so the guy didn\u2019t shoot me.",
        "Q: Yeah. And so \u2014",
        "A: And then my father, he was ahead of me f \u2014 because somehow we separated, he\nwas ahead of me, and he went into the doorway. And when they were firing, you\ncould see the bullet hits right around there where he stood, but \u2014 but 1t wouldn\u2019t hit\nhim because he was in a doorway, so he didn\u2019t get hit. We were a lucky family.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So anyway, so then we started hearing the shooting outside the Dippoldiswalde,\nand we decided to get out.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because we \u2014 again, we didn\u2019t want to fall in the Russians. So we walked into\nCzechoslovakia.",
        "Q: You \u2014 the whole family walked?February 18, 2013",
        "A: Yes, we had the little cart, so we had some grain, some food you know, some\ngrain and sugar, and stuff like that. And we walked for two weeks from che \u2014 from\n\u2014 to Czechoslovakia, all the way to the American zone. And when we got to\nAmerican zone, the American soldiers stopped the traffic. They wouldn\u2019t let people\ngo across the bridge. And my father said, this is something screwy. He walked off\nthe road, talked to a farmer, and asked him was there another way to get to \u2014 get out\nof here. He said yes, take this d-dirt road here, walk up, you know, two kilometers,\nturn left and you\u2019 ll walk into the road that goes right into Germany. So my father\nsays, we\u2019re not going to wait and listen to these Americans. So we walked, we get\nto the border and we see a soldier guard, American guard walking around. My\nfather looked around, he says, let\u2019s go, he won\u2019t bother us, he\u2019s talking to a girl.\nSure enough, we walked, he just kind of \u2014 I don\u2019t know if he even saw us, probably\nhe didn\u2019t. And we just walked in and sure enough, that night Americans withdrew\nfrom Czechoslovakia and Russians took over.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: So I keep on saying, you know, we were the luckiest family in World War II, to\nsurvive things like that. So anyway, so we ended up in little town called Selb, lived\nthere for a month or two, then moved to a little town called [indecipherable] townFebruary 18, 2013\ncalled Hof. Stayed there for a couple of months and then we moved to Wiirzburg,\nGermany. And we spent \u2014 in Wurzburg we spent from 1944 til about 1948 ef \u2014",
        "Q: So when you were in Wurzburg, the war was still going on?",
        "A: Oh no, no, no. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that \u2014 that\u2019s right, yeah, yeah, we \u2014 we were\nin \u2014 the war was still on, oh yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, the war ended in May, and so we ended up -\u2014 essentially, I think war\nstopped really, when we were en route.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, I think that\u2019s what happened, yeah, the war was stopped when we were en\nroute. And so we got out in the American zone, and that\u2019s where we spent the next\nfive years, you know, \u201940 \u2014 \u201945 to \u2014 well, \u201944 to \u00b045 \u2014 \u00b045, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: To \u00b049.",
        "Q: And what kind of \u2014 what happened in \u2014 in \u2014 in these years? Did you settle in one\nplace, you know, that is, when you were in Wurzburg, or were you moved around?",
        "A: We lived in a displaced person camp.",
        "Q: I see.February 18, 2013",
        "A: And we were fed there, and we had a high school there, so I went to school\nthere.",
        "Q: Was it a German high school?",
        "A: I\u2014I finished high school in Germany, in Lithuanian high school.",
        "Q: So, was this a Lithuanian displaced persons camp?",
        "A: This was mostly Lithuanians. There was Latvians a \u2014 one building Latvians and\nthree buildings Lithuanians. And a hospital. It was a former military camp in\nWurzburg.",
        "Q: What did your father do during these years?",
        "A: My father found out that Americans \u2014 soldiers, had a warehouse and they needed\nsome workers. So he went there and applied for a job, and they gave him a job. So\nhe started working for the Americans in \u2014 in the warehouse. And then Americans\nstarted organizing guard companies. And my father told the Americans he was an\nofficer, and so they appointed him as a commander of a Lithuanian company.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That ended up guarding Nazi prisoners in Schwaibishmint(ph) with Lithuanians\nunder Americans. They were dressed up in American uniforms, I can show you a\npicture. And \u2014 and then, what happened when the guarding stopped, they\nestablished a engineering company. And so my father became a c \u2014 a companyFebruary 18, 2013\ncommander for an engineering company that was responsible for putting bridges\nacross the Rhine.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. So \u2014 but let\u2019s stop with the \u2014 let\u2019s go back a\nlittle bit to the time he was a guard of \u2014 of Nazi criminals, is that what \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 what you said? So did he talk about this when he came home and told you \u2014",
        "A: No, because he lived som \u2014 separately. We were living in Wiirzburg and he was\nin Schwaibishmint(ph), which is quite a ways apart.",
        "Q: Okay. Did he eventually tell you what \u2014 who he was guarding and what kind of\npeople they were?",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh sure, we knew that.",
        "Q: So, what kind of mem \u2014 what kind of stories did he say \u2014 did he tell?",
        "A: Well, he didn\u2019t say may \u2014 much of it at all, you know, they were just guarding\nthe war prisoners, you know, they didn\u2019t do anything else, you know, just stand\nguard around. They were \u2014 they weren\u2019t interrogating them or doing anything. They\nwere just guarding the \u2014",
        "Q: The perimeter?",
        "A: The \u2014 yeah, the p-per \u2014 per \u2014 per \u2014 per \u2014 periphery. And \u2014 and then when that\nwas over they \u2014 they appointed him commander of engineering company.\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "Q: And s \u2014",

        "A: Okay, my father-in-law Darsha(ph) Starkus told me the story.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He and a guy by the name of Belkinus(ph) went to medical school together. And\nthe Belkinus(ph) was a Jew. And so then, by coincidence, they \u2014 he \u2014 Dr. Starkus\nended up as a district doctor of this small district in \u2014 in Lithuania, around\nDiletus(ph).",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And it turned out to be Belkin(ph) ended up there too. And they used to get\ntogether occasionally. Well, one day, when they started pe \u2014 pushing people into the\nghettos, my father-in-law, Dr. Starkus was going to work, and he saw Dr.\nBelkin(ph) with his wife and a daughter, with suitcases going towards the railroad\nstation. He said, where you going? Well, Vilijampole. He said, you know what\u2019sFebruary 18, 2013\ngoing on there, don\u2019t go. He says, where can I go? Come with me. He took the\nfamily to his sister-in-law house and put them up there. In the meantime, as a doctor\nof that district, he became friends with a German \u2014 with a German commander of\nthe town, or of the district. And he used to come occasionally to visit and for dinner.\nWell, one day he came in, you know, and he says, I\u2019ve got to leave early today\nbecause we have to go to south side of Aytus to arrest Jews that are people housing.",
        "Q: No kidding.",
        "A: So the German one way, the father-in-law the other, ran over to that sister-in-\nlaw\u2019s house, put the people in a car and drove them to another place, and then the\nfollowing day he found a place to put them with a f\u2014 some of his acquaintance that\nhad a farm next to th \u2014 to \u2014 to the woods \u2014 to the fl \u2014 you know. And apparently\nthey built a double wall somewhere where they could hide if somebody came. And\nDr. Belkin(ph) and his wife stayed there, but the d-daughter, they couldn\u2019t keep her\nthere. So Dr. Starkus arranged with a priest to give him a birth certificate of \u2014 of a\ndead girl as hers. And he put up with \u2014 with \u2014 with an older lady, a friend of his, or\na \u2014 someone he knew. And that\u2019s how they survived the war.",
        "Q: So the whole Belkin(ph) family \u2014",
        "A: The whole Belkin(ph) family survived. And the little girl was \u2014 was \u2014 was\nchristened to be a Christian \u2014 Catholic, by the lady. Anyway, they had a little hardFebruary 18, 2013\ntime \u2014 well, of course, and then the Russians came. And of course Dr. Belkin(ph)\nand his wife survived and their little daughter survived. And the little \u2014 they had the\nlittle trouble getting the girl back because the woman didn\u2019t want to give her up,\nafter three years or so.",
        "Q: You get attached.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Anyway, so then, of course, it worked out fine and \u2014",
        "Q: Do you know if they stayed in Lithuania, the Belkin(ph) family?",
        "A: Well, when the lady that \u2014 the lady that housed them in Alytus, Dr. Starkus\u2019\nsister-in-law died, and I went to her funeral there and Mrs. Belkin(ph) was there, I\nthink Dr. Belkin(ph) by then was dead. And she died shortly after that, I think. Her\ndaughter, the young lady, still survives and she lives in Vilnius.",
        "Q: Does she?",
        "A: And she\u2019s married, you know, lives in Vilnius, has her own family.",
        "Q: And she still lives in Lithuania?",
        "A: Yeah. That\u2019s the last I heard.",
        "Q: Okay. Now the funeral that you\u2019re talking about, what year was that funeral?\nWas that \u2014February 18, 2013",
        "A: \u00b092 - 93.",
        "Q: Okay. So the Belkins(ph), the elder Belkins(ph) had still been alive until \u201992 and\n93?",
        "A: Some \u2014 somewhere around there, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But he wasn\u2019t at the funeral, but s \u2014 but his wife was there.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So I saw her and met her.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Just said hello and that was about it.",
        "Q: Okay. Did she know of your connection?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m not sure. I kind of doubt it.",
        "Q: Okay, okay. And \u2014",
        "A: I kind of doubt it.",
        "Q: \u2014 did anybody \u2014 Mr. Starkus, what happened with him?",
        "A: Well, Dr. Starkus \u2014 after we got married, Dr. Starkus retired at the age of some\n\u2014 70 something and moved to Santa Monica, and lived here until he died in the\nearly 90s.",
        "Q: Do you \u2014February 18, 2013",
        "A: Oh no, late 90s, I guess.",
        "Q: Late 90s.",
        "A: Yeah, late 90s, yeah. And then his wife survived for another two years, died in\nHawaii, and they\u2019re buried here in Los Angeles.",
        "Q: Do you know whether or not they were ever recognized by Yad Vashem, as\nbeing Righteous Amongst Gentiles?",
        "A: You know, I used to go to some meetings, you know, and I met a Jewish fellow\nwho was part of the organization here, the Holocaust or whatever you call it, here in\nLos Angeles.",
        "Q: The Museum of Tolerance?",
        "A: Yeah, something, you know, he was member of that. And I kind of told him the\nstory, so he wanted to talk to Dr. Starkus. Dr. Starkus refused. He didn't want to\ntalk about it.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: You know, there are some things that happened, I think when the Russians came\nand liberated Lithuania from the Germans. But Dr. Belkin(ph) became a doctor in\nAlytus in \u2014 in the prison there. And the lady that I\u2019m talking about that \u2014 that\nhoused these \u2014 these people, her husband was arrested and shot there. And they\nwere all upset, you know, that he didn\u2019t help him. They think he didn\u2019t help him,February 18, 2013\nmy opinion is he could not help them. But anyway \u2014 and so that kind of broke up\nthe friendship.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Because he participated in the \u2014 in the execution of \u2014 of daw \u2014 of Byerchus(ph).",
        "Q: What was the name of the family?",
        "A: Byerchus(ph).",

        "A: \u20141n Lithuania, he was a partisan.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And so somebody, you know, squealed on them, and th \u2014 and the Russians found\nthem and essentially took him in and killed him.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: SO.",
        "Q: It\u2019s complicated.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "Q: It\u2019s complicated.",
        "A: So I think that sort of put some friction there, between the families.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And I think \u2014 I personally think it\u2019s unjustified, because there is nothing he could\nhave done.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: But that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the story there.",
        "Q: Is \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s what I know.",
        "Q: Yes, I understand. Is there anything else that you would like to add to what\nwe\u2019 ve spoken about, about these events, these historical events? You know, what\nkind of inter \u2014 why your interest was piqued and maybe other people\u2019s wasn\u2019t?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know. I think the fact that when I found out that there was a Jewish\nconnection in my family, I \u2014 I got interested, you know, and tried to track it and I\ncouldn\u2019t get anywhere, in Lithuania. You know, because the documents were kept\nvery poorly and so on, and \u2014 and so, no I couldn\u2019t track anything down. But, in\ngeneral, I got interested in it, and the more I read, the more interested I got, you\nknow, to find out what \u2014 what went on. And so I\u2014 I\u2014I read quite a few books, you\nknow, and \u2014 and in fact I just finished, some time ago, a book about a thousandFebruary 18, 2013\npages which is a diary of a Jewish lawyer that survived all these wars, and ended up\nin Israel and then depa \u2014 and then become internationally known as a la-lawyer and\nso on. Well, he wrote \u2014 he preserved most of his diary from those days in Kaunas\nghetto.",
        "Q: Do you remember his name?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you read it in English or in Lithuanian?",
        "A: In English, in English, it\u2019s a big book, and I can\u2019t even \u2014 I think it just says diary\nsomething.",
        "Q: Diary of the Kovno ghetto.",

        "Q: Avraham Tory.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s the guy, that\u2019s his diary.",
        "Q: What did you learn from that diary that you hadn\u2019t known before?February 18, 2013",
        "A: Well, I learned what \u2014 what happened, how the life went on there. Because, you\nknow, we didn\u2019t see it, you know. Things went on [indecipherable] inside, you\nknow, and \u2014 and we see ok \u2014 you know, like we used to see was groups of Jews\nbeing escorted from one place to another. That\u2019s about all we saw, you know, in\nyellow stars. And as I say, you know, my mother got stopped because she looked\nJewish [indecipherable] they wanted to know where her star was. So \u2014",
        "Q: Why do you think some people are interested in this in Lithuania and other\npeoples aren\u2019t?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I just became interested, you know, and the more I\nread, the more interested I got. And so essentially \u2014 a little while back\n[indecipherable] published a little review of a book by this woman, and I just\nstarted reading it.",
        "Q: I think it must be Ellen Cassedy\u2019s book.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, it is. That\u2019s right, that\u2019s what I have.",

        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, Remus(ph) Kaminskas(ph), yeah. He is reading it. I think\nthat\u2019s who I gave it to, yeah, I think it\u2019s Remus(ph). So anyway \u2014 so that\u2019s why \u2014\nhow I developed interest you know, in \u2014 in following genocide, and then especially\nLithuanian.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: And being quite aware, in Lithuania of \u2014 of mo \u2014 mo \u2014 the opinion that people\nspread about the Jews, you know, that\u2019s a \u2014 and I think it was primarily jealousy,\nbecause Jews, you know, well organized people, they helped each other, opened up\nbusinesses, were successful. And by golly, you know, people said well, you know,\nJews are taking it over. Well, sure they taking over. Why? Because they work and \u2014\nand \u2014 and \u2014 and create, and get educated.",
        "Q: What would you want \u2014 what would you want young Lithuanians in Lithuania\nto know about what went on there?",
        "A: Well, I think that somebody could create a \u2014 a \u2014 a seminars or something about\nit, but \u2014 but I\u2019m not sure that it would work.",
        "Q: Why?February 18, 2013",
        "A: Well, you know, I guess now is there\u2019s some guilt in among the Lithuanians, you\nknow. Because let\u2019s face it, you know where the Holocaust started?",
        "Q: Where?",
        "A: Lithuania.",

        "A: That\u2019s what it tells you.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That\u2019s where it all started.",
        "Q: Why do you think it started in Lithuania?",
        "A: Well, because they started executing people first, even before the Poles did.\nThat\u2019s why.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know that Poles executed Jews. I think it was just that concentration\ncamps were in Poland.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s probably Germans with \u2014 with other help.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: I think there was a battalion of Lithuanians that participated in that.",
        "Q: In \u20141n Poland?February 18, 2013",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m not sure in Poland, but I know in Lithuania.",
        "Q: Oh yes, oh yeah, uh-huh.",
        "A: Yeah, I don\u2019t know about Poland, no I don\u2019t know about Poland. But \u2014 but\nessentially, years ago, it was haven for the pole \u2014 for the Jews to come, because\npeople were tolerated. And then it became anti-Semitic place because there were so\nmany of them there, and they were \u2014 and they were keeping themselves, you know,\nas a separate class, and then hatred developed. Or I should say, you know,\nmisunderstanding or whatever you want to call, developed between the two groups,\nbecause essentially, Jew was not Lithuanian, he was Jew. He just lived here. That\u2019s\nthe way they looked.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know? Even today they think they look the same way.",
        "Q: So, Pll \u2014 I'll repeat the question a bit of a different way. If you were sitting here\nwith a 16 or a 17 year old Lithuanian kid who\u2019s now growing up on the streets and\nin the places where all of these things happened, what would you want to tell them?\nBecause you were an 11 year old kid when it was happening?",
        "A: Well, I would ask him if he\u2019s interested to hear about it.",
        "Q: Okay.February 18, 2013",
        "A: And it he isn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t tell him anything. You know, how can you tell\nsomebody that doesn\u2019t want to listen?",
        "Q: That\u2019s true. That\u2019s true.",
        "A: SO.",
        "Q: What do you think we need to do in order to have people want to listen?",
        "A: Well, you know, I think there\u2019s a process in Lithuania gaining \u2014 getting people\nto \u2014 to understand the \u2014 th-the \u2014 the unity of people to understand the relationship\namong the people, because [indecipherable] way, part of the Euro \u2014 European usa\n\u2014 union. People are interchanging, people are all mixing. And I think that\u2019s\nassimilation process. And I think that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s gonna help. You know, Lithuania\u2019s\nlosing people to immigration. The number of Lithuanian pop-population has\ndecreased.",

        "A: No, I\u2014 my \u2014 my parents had six children. The oldest one died shortly after birth,\nthen I was the next, Cesare, born in Italy. Then my brother Roman, who was born\nin Lithuania, in Kaunas. And then a sister was born, her name was Ligeia. And\nunfortunately she died from one of the diseases that was spreading around, maybeFebruary 18, 2013\ntyphus or something like that. Or diphtheria. Anyway, she died at the age of five.\nAnd then my brother Joseph, Joe was born in Lithuania. So he was 10 years\nyounger than I. And then a year later or so my sister was born, Grazina. She, and\nwe all ended up in the United States, as a family.",
        "A: No. At first we lived in Alytus, Lithuania, where my father was a cavalry\nofficer. Only in 1939, we moved to Kaunas.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, he was a professional military man. Just one \u2014 one thing about this\nmilitary career. He started out during World War II in the tsar\u2019s army.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Okay, well, I think he was born in 19 \u2014 I\u2019m sorry 1893. And there\u2019s a confusion\nabout the date because it was at that time there was the old calendar, that was\nchanged later. So I think his birthday is on the 18\" of January in 19 \u2014 I mean, 1893.",
        "A: In Kaunas, he grew up in Kaunas, and after they \u2014 Lithuania fought for its\nindependence in 19 \u2014 1819, he was a volunteer in that army.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh yes, he was, yes he was, yes.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: He never talked about his years that he served in the \u2014 in the fight for the\nLithuanian independence. The \u2014 the only thing that I remember about it, that he wasFebruary 18, 2013\ngiven a\u2014a medal which is called Wikyas(ph) kryZius. But essentially it\u2019s the same\nkind of thing that we have Medal of Honor.",
        "A: It was for his bravery fighting in the \u2014 in the \u2014 with the Polish and Russian\ntroops.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, he changes armies.",
        "A: He becomes an officer in the Lithuanian army, in the cavalry.",
        "A: That\u2019s how he ended up in Italy.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember the title, but ti \u2014 the title that I think of is \u2014 was savanoris \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 volunteer, essentially.February 18, 2013",
        "A: And then he \u2014 when the war was \u2014 I mean, Lithuania gained its independence,\nhe ended up going to military school, and became an officer in the Lithuanian army.",
        "A: And after that, he continued to serve.",
        "A: Okay, my mother was born in a small village along the Nemunas river,\nPloksciai. Her father was a very successful lawyer in Lithuania and he had a large\nestate in that little town. And when I was on my way, they were in Ploksciai, in that\nlittle town and was delivered there, and th-they \u2014 they \u2014 I mean, she was born there.\nAnd I-I think she was born in 1906, but I don\u2019t remember the date.",
        "A: And \u2014",
        "A: Oh, the estate, yes, I do remember the estate, because I was there, trying to get\nher back under the new Lithuania.",
        "A: I probably \u2014 I remember being there once or twice, with my mother, visiting\nthere.",
        "A: Well, let me just finish about my mother.",
        "A: Her name was Krasauskita(ph), which is derived from Krasauskas(ph). And\nshe was fairly young when she got married to my father in 1926, I think.",
        "A: And essentially my \u2014 my dad was a military fa \u2014 my \u2014 my family was a military\nfamily, so we moved around. And I remember living in the place called\nMyampoli(ph). That\u2019s where \u2014 the first place I remember I lived. Then I lived in\nAlytus, and then we moved to Kaunas. And when in 1940, when the Russians\nessentially occupied Lithuania and Lithuania became the Socialist Republic, my\nfather was dra \u2014 transferred into the Red Army. So he became a lieutenant colonel\nin the Red Army.",
        "A: Okay.February 18, 2013",
        "A: Well, because he never was involved in politics.",
        "A: And his father was a policeman that was killed by the Germans during World\nWar I. And so essentially, he came from a simple family, and he was born in a little\ntown on \u2014 on \u2014 along the Nemunas river. And he spoke very good Russian, because\nhe lived in Russia for years too, being \u2014 being \u2014 being in the service. So essentially,\nhe wasn\u2019t arrested, but we found out that when \u2014 when the German occupied\nLithuania in 1941, we found out that we are in a \u2014 the family was on a list to be\ndeported to Siberia next week.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s what I heard.February 18, 2013",
        "A: I mean, I didn\u2019t see any paper or anything, because at that time I was too young\nto decipher anything, I was essentially \u2014 in 1941 I was 11 years old.",
        "A: Or in 1940.",
        "A: Yes, because we always have to make new friends. So it\u2019s just kind of different,\nbut we \u2014 we adapted to that very quickly. It didn\u2019t really bother us. Because\nessentially we moved \u2014 we really moved with the army, you know, it wasn\u2019t like a\nnew job or something. It was just o-officer being moved to a \u2014 getting another\nassignment.",
        "A: Yeah, in a different place, so we just \u2014",
        "A: Yes, I would say so. Yeah, come \u2014 well, not really. There were several ethnic\nRussians that lived in Lithuania that I befriended, yes.February 18, 2013",
        "A: Yes, yes, we \u2014 our neighbors. The \u2014 my grandmother\u2019s neighbors were\nLithuanian Jews. And \u2014",
        "A: I beg your pardon\u2019?",
        "A: Oh, she lived in Kaunas.",
        "A: And she was friends with them, and they had some children there and so I would\n\u2014 when I would visit my grandmother, I would play with them. And then, of course,\nthey disappeared in 1941.",
        "A: Layba(ph).",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That\u2019s the last name.",

        "A: Yeah, they were boys.",
        "A: Two boys, as I remember.",
        "A: My father\u2019s mother.",
        "A: Oh yes, we did.",
        "A: Well, some of it, but not \u2014 not anything that I remember as a \u2014 as an outstanding\nthing. My father was pretty adept at getting along with the government.",
        "A: So-",
        "A: Well, he didn\u2019t participate in \u2014 in \u2014 1n any cliques, and was \u2014 was a fair guy, and\n\u2014 and his underlings always loved him because he was very fair, he was tolerant\nperson.",
        "A: Well, he was pretty straightforward, but pretty strict, as an officer.",
        "A: And when he said something to do, you did it.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, my mother was the family\u2019s boss in the house.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, she was actually very easygoing. Occasionally, you know, she kind of\npretended she was beating us, you know, and she just kind of went past the face,\nyou know, past the rear end, you know, and that was about it. No, she was very\ngentle.",
        "A: Not that much. My mother was more than my father. But I don\u2019t remember\ngoing to church very often with them.",
        "A: Catholics.",
        "A: My \u2014 say one \u2014 one thing about my mother. Many years later, when I\u2014 when we\nwere here in the United States, my mother, and in fact her sister too, told me that in\nmy mother\u2019s family, in \u2014 there was a Jew that married a Lithuanian women. And in\nfact, that was a big [indecipherable] secret on the German occupation.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, it had to be three or four generations back.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, because there was a Jewish relative, and so nobody talked about it,\nand people that knew didn\u2019t bring it up anywhere.February 18, 2013",
        "A: That\u2019s right. So anyway \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, you know, all Lithuanians considered Jews different people.",
        "A: They still do.",
        "A: Well, as I say, my father was not very \u2014 he\u2019s a very tolerant, you know, he \u2014",
        "A: Oh \u2014 oh \u2014 oh, well it\u2019s essentially re-really anti-Semitic judgment.",
        "A: That Jews, you know, take ad \u2014 take advantage of s \u2014 of \u2014 of Lithuanians. That\nwas sort of an idea that was spread. I think in fact th-they \u2014 the Lithuanians were\nvery tolerant, because in 1300s, Jews came to Lithuania because they were being\nevicted from England and Germany and Austria. And they came to Poland,\nLithuania, because at that time Lithuanians themselves were \u2014 weren\u2019t Christians.February 18, 2013\nVery tolerant, they were pagans, you know. And so th \u2014 Lithuania lived with those\nJews until u \u2014 udi \u2014 unification with Poland, in \u2014 I think in 1500s. And that\u2019s when\nJesuits come in, and they the ones that spread all those bad stories about the Jews.",
        "A: Oh, about Jews taking the kids, rolling them in a barrel full of nails and using\ntheir b \u2014 they blood to \u2014 to make matzo.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: And that they were stealing things from people, you know, they were really bad\npeople. Of course, all it was, jealousy, because Jews were organized well, they were\nwell educated. And there were \u2014 of course there were poor Jews too, but \u2014 but \u2014 but\nlot of them were \u2014 were well educated people. In fact, you know, there were\nrestrictions, you know, in the professions, like [indecipherable] get in. For\nexample, they couldn\u2019t own land.",
        "A: They weren\u2019t allowed to own land.",
        "A: At first, yes.February 18, 2013",
        "A: And then later, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: But at first, no. And in general, it was idea that the Jews in general were taking\nadvantage of people, so you had to be careful of them. That was sort of negative I\nremember.",
        "A: On the other hand, on the other hand, there were good Jews that were friends of\nmy parents, you know.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Oh yeah, when \u2014 when he was growing up, there was Jewish people\nwho were living there next door to them. So \u2014February 18, 2013",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure how to answer that, but my parents essentially weren\u2019t very anti-\nSemitic in many ways, I would say. They were very tolerant and they would just\nshrug it off.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t remember really my mother or father badmouthing Jews.",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "A: I did?",
        "A: Oh yes, I remember starting grammar school in 1936. I was, I guess six years old\nor seven years old \u2014 six \u2014 six years old, yeah.",
        "A: Interesting enough, one of the people that I went to school, that \u2014 that started\nschool there in Alytus, lives here in Los Angeles.",
        "A: Yes. He was an officer\u2019s son, too.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh yeah. We see them all the time.",
        "A: His name is Pasulas(ph).",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Yes. Well, there\u2019s another person that lives here in Los Angeles that I went to\ngrammar school when we moved to Kaunas.",
        "A: And he lives here too. And there\u2019s another friend of mine that I went to \u2014 I mean,\nI start to go to high school in 1941, probably, we started together. And in fact, when\nw \u2014 when \u2014 when \u2014 when we lived in Germany, DP camps, we met up again and\nwe finished high school together in Germany.",
        "A: And he\u2019s here too.\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "A: It\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s right.",
        "A: You know, I just remember badmouthing Soviet Union, but I don\u2019t remember\nbadmouthing Germany.",
        "A: Well, the first time it was in 1939, when the Russians occupied \u2014 ni \u2014 1940,\nwhen the Russians occupied Lithuania.",
        "A: Oh sure, I was in Kaunas.",
        "A: We just moved to Kaunas from Alytus.",
        "A: And I remember people walking around you know, some for it, some against it,\nyou know. And there were a lot of communists out on the streets, celebrating the\nliberation from the Smetona, fascist ruler.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I never remember hearing anything about \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 about them saying anything about it.",
        "A: Yeah, I don\u2019t ever remember him mentioning anything about that \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the government being or \u2014 or being bad, good, or what. He was an officer,\nthat\u2019s the way he looked at it.",

        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. So I remember them very be \u2014 being surprised to see what we had.February 18, 2013",
        "A: In fact, what happens, there was a re \u2014 of \u2014 anti-aircraft artillery group in \u2014 just a\nhalf a mile from our house. And what they did, we had a house with upstairs, ru \u2014\nsleeping rooms, they moved a \u2014 a political officer into our house.",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Occasionally, yeah, he used to come back.",
        "A: You know, I remember people were worrying about food supplies and sugar and\nso on, because they were afraid that the Russian soldiers were buying things up and\nshipping home. And so there was talk about the fact that there may be food\nshortages, you know, and that \u2014 and now we won\u2019t have any bananas, you know,\nand all that. I kind of remember tho \u2014 that talk. So it was repe \u2014 pretty much\nrecognizing that Russia was not a \u2014 a\u2014a wealthy place, or a good place to live.",
        "A: Well, we start to study Russian.",
        "A: One of the classes we had to attend was Russian.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m sure they changed history courses, you know, and stuff like that, but I\ndon\u2019t really remember much about the changes, I just remember getting a book and\nthat\u2019s it. A history book and a social studies.",

And some of his friends said, well you do\nthat, they\u2019re gonna send you to \u2014 to \u2014 with the Jews. He said, we\u2019ll see. He came\nback, spoke to the German supervisor, told him that his family was in Kaunas, and\nhe had a nice job, could he leave. And the German released him.",
        "A: Cause he said, I\u2019m not going to participate in \u2014 in executions of Jewish people.",

        "A: It was my grandmother that said goodbye to them, so I don\u2019t know what\nhappened, but \u2014February 18, 2013",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t remember much talk about it.",
        "A: I just remember that they were forced to go to ghetto. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s about all I\nremember about them.",
        "A: They just sort of disappeared.",
        "A: Not with me.",
        "A: Okay, I was going to one of the top high schools at that time in \u2014 in \u2014 in\nLithuania, in Kaunas. It\u2019s called AuSros gymnasium, was really the top ranked\nschool. And one of the reasons I got in there is because my mother\u2019s sister\u2019s\nhusband was a director.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",

        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, we just kept quiet. In fact, our father told us not to make any comments\nabout the government and so on. So we just didn\u2019t participate in. Even if anybody\nwas doing it, I don\u2019t \u2014 I \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I\u2019m sure I just walked away.",
        "A: We just \u2014 essentially we just tolerated whatever was going around us.",
        "A: Well, they essentially ghetto, stay there, you know, and they kept on killing them\n\u2014 bringing people there and then shooting them in the nine foo \u2014 for \u2014 Ninth Fort.",
        "A: Oh, everybody knew about that.",
        "A: No, we \u2014 at our home we didn\u2019t talk much about it.",
        "A: But we knew that was going on. And as I say, you know, my father\u2019s rules, no\none can get involved with this.",
        "A: Essentially, y-you know, there was a lot of opinions that I \u2014 I kind of recall, ab \u2014\namong people that \u2014 that kind of said, well, the Jews are getting what they deserve.\nThere were \u2014 some people were doing \u2014 saying that. But we were jus \u2014 stayed out of\nit.",
        "A: Beg your pardon?\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember really much.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember much.",
        "A: I just remember, you know, these stories that \u2014 that \u2014 that my grandmother kept\non telling me, you know, that the Jews used his blood you know, and they make\nmatzo and th \u2014 and many other things. I don\u2019t remember any particular story, but \u2014\nbut there were stories that were spread. And I think \u2014 my \u2014 my own opinion is that\nall this started when Lithuania united with Poland and Jesuits came in.",
        "A: I think this is where it all started.",
        "A: I think when I was already here in the United States, probably.",

        "A: Oh I\u2019m sure there were a lot of them that felt \u2014 felt that way.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, my \u2014 my answer for that is I-I\u2019m ignorant of the view.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t remember what view I heard.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, they \u2014 my \u2014 the two years younger brother, he understood it.\nIn fact, he\u2019s \u2014 e-even today, he remembers more than I do.",
        "A: Oh yes. The two years make a big difference. But he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s always had a better\nmemory.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Okay.\n[break]",
        "A: Well, I'll tell you what I know, or at least I think I know. Kaunas was a city in\nLithuania that was populated by Lithuanians, and about 30 percent, I believe, at\none time, was Jewish.",
        "A: And my parents \u2014 my \u2014 my p \u2014 my father\u2019s parents lived in Kaunas, my\ngrandfather \u2014 my \u2014 my grandfather was a police officer. And in 1918 or so, when he\nFebruary 18, 2013\nwas arrested by the Germans, he was killed in a POW camp. So I never met him or\nher \u2014 or \u2014 or saw him. And after that, what can I say? We moved to Kaunas,\nbecause my father was transferred from Alytus to Kaunas in 1939. And soon after\nwe arrived in 1940, Russians came in.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Well, it was done by Catherine the Great.",
        "A: Well, all I know about it is the fact that there are about, I think, 12 of them\nsurrounding Kaunas. That\u2019s essentially when \u2014 when \u2014 when I was alive, some of\nthem had certain \u2014 certain uses. Like the fort where we lived, fort five was storage.\nThere are a lot of \u2014 military storage, workers \u2014",
        "A: No, they \u2014 they\u2019re \u2014 interesting enough, they were level ground.",
        "A: Level ground, and they had water surrounding them, th-they had a \u2014 whatever\nyou call that.",
        "A: Yes, a moat surrounding it. And inside they had the quarters and they had\nweapons, artillery and so on. But I don\u2019t think that very many people lived there.\nThere lived, surrounding the fort, they had \u2014 they had buildings, and the fort that I\nremember was fort number four, fort number five, fort number nine. These are the\nthree forts that I remember because they\u2019re connected with \u2014 with the history in\nsome ways, for me.",
        "A: So, the other forts, I don\u2019t know what they were used for, but number \u2014 and \u2014\nand that\u2019s right, and there was number six, I think, that was used as a prison.\nNumber nine \u2014",
        "A: Before the war, yeah.",
        "A: In fact, in fact, they never were used for military purposes, because \u2014February 18, 2013",
        "A: They built them, they were just \u2014 sat there, because nobody attacked Kaunas,\nnobody needed them. And so it was really probably a great waste of \u2014 of \u2014 of tsar\u2019s\nmoney to build them, but they build them, and as I say, when I was living in\nLithuania they were used as prisons and storage u \u2014 places. And \u2014",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "A: O-Okay, let me see, how ca \u2014 how to describe it? Well, it\u2019s probably \u2014 diameter\non it probably was ha-half a kilometer, 500 meters or so.",
        "A: And they \u2014 they \u2014 they had these build-ups, you know, in \u2014 in-inside, you know,\nin and out. The kind of stuff, you know, that would protect from somebody firing at\nyou.",
        "A: Yeah, there was some underground stuff, yes, yes.",
        "A: No, they weren\u2019t tall, no.",
        "A: No, they were \u2014 had some \u2014 they had some above, you know, they \u2014 but \u2014 but\nthey weren\u2019t very tall.",
        "A: They had brick, brick and cement, yeah. And \u2014 and ce \u2014 and iron. Iron was \u2014 was\none of the things that they were using there. The gates, and \u2014 e-entrance to the fort,\nat \u2014 at \u2014 at least the number four and five had this huge steel wall, steel fence that\nthey opened ev \u2014 to get in and ge \u2014 get out.",
        "A: Oh yeah, no, you could see right through it, you could see the bild \u2014 the building.\nIn fact, there were some quarters there and storage places, right \u2014 right after the\nentrance, so they could come in with the vehicles, unload them, you know, and so\non. But then, the rest of 1t was all in and out, you know, it was just \u2014 just a lot of ins\n\u2014 for \u2014 for mounting weapons, for looking through, you know. And even when I\nthink about it now, I\u2019m not sure what \u2014 what they would have done with them, even\nif they were attacked.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right, exactly. So anyway, so that\u2019s what I remember about\nthose forts. And the one that I\u2019m most acquainted is number five, because we lived\nabout 200 feet from \u2014 200 meters from \u2014 from the fort.",
        "A: My father had a house built there on a five hectare land, it\u2019s like 15 acres. And\nso we used to go and play there.",
        "A: At the fort.",
        "A: Oh, we \u2014 kids, you know, could get in anywhere.",
        "A: So \u2014so we\u2019d go in there and at one time when \u2014 when \u2014 in 1941, when Germans\nattacked Russia, we went in there and there was th \u2014 there was a food storage there.\nAnd I remember loading ourselves up with cans of \u2014 of vegetables and goods, you\nknow, food, because there was \u2014 full of it there. And people \u2014 whole neighborhood,\nyou know, was coming in and going out with \u2014 with goodies.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.February 18, 2013",
        "A: That\u2019s right, they left it all, and so \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And so the ge \u2014 before the Germans could \u2014 could even take care of it, people\nwere already in there and taking things out.",
        "A: Yeah, including me.",
        "A: Oh yes, all the time, yes.",
        "A: No, they just \u2014 I\u2019m not sure if the other forts were wide open like the fifth one\nwas. Fourth one, of course, was always kind of closed up because they always had\nthe \u2014 I think something going on, you know, with \u2014 with prisons or something like\nthat. But \u2014",
        "A: Well, they had quarters, you know, for housing soldiers.February 18, 2013",
        "A: And so \u2014 so that\u2019s what they did, you know, they used the quarters as prison.\nAnd fort number nine and I think six, were prisons. And \u2014 and then in the end\nactually, number five, this is where the most of the Jews were killed.",
        "A: Nine.",
        "A: Number nine. This is where most of the Jews were killed. And then some of\nthem were killed in number five \u2014 number four.",
        "A: Okay, well, you know, as I mentioned earlier, my father was a director of a \u2014 of\na sawmill, which was on a river in the \u2014 in the \u2014 Kaunas. And I can \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 show you here.",
        "A: So-",
        "A: Yes.\nFebruary 18, 2013\nQ2: Do you want us to shoot quality inserts later, and then you just talk?",
        "A: This is Nemunas.",
        "A: Nemo(ph) \u2014 Nemo(ph) or Nemun(ph).",
        "A: Number five is where I lived and number four, this is where we \u2014 where they\nwere using as a prison.",
        "A: No, four and five.\nQ2?: It\u2019s an X and a\u2014",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s \u2014 I \u2014 just making location.",
        "A: The X is location.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, I lived near fort number five.",
        "A: And we were probably about a mile or so apart.",
        "A: That\u2019s the same map.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And here is a closer look. This is where my father\u2019s sawmill was, and this is\nwhere the fort was.\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "A: Okay, well, at one \u2014 this is during the summer now, so we\u2019re loose, on summer\nvacation. And so for nothing better to do, we used to come and visit my father in the\n\u2014 in the sawmill, and go in swimming in the river. And so along the river one time, I\n\u2014 coming in from \u2014 toward us, along the river Nemunas, we saw this \u2014 this huge\ncrowd moving. And we said, well, let\u2019s take a look what it is. So wen \u2014 we went up\nthere, and what it was, it was actually most people were ha \u2014 we-wearing the yellow\nDavid star, meaning that they were Jews. And they were young people and young \u2014\nand \u2014 and small children, and ladies and \u2014 and men, older men mostly. And they\nwere marching towards [indecipherable] towards number four fort. So we decided\nto follow them, and so we saw them move this huge crowd into the fort. And then\nwe kind of cut behind there and we stood on the outside edge of the moat, and we\ncould see inside. And we saw this \u2014 these people in a single row, moving in, and\nthrowing in their belongings in a pile.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, a little bit higher, yes.",
        "A: Outside?",
        "A: No, no, that was lower, that \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 where we were standing was lower.\nThere were higher places in the fort itself.",
        "A: But we were looking down in the fort from the moat.",
        "A: And so we were looking down in the fort, and we could see this single row of\npeople going and throwing in whatever they were carrying with them, you know.\nAnd \u2014",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t really think they were undressing there, I think they undressed\nlater. But \u2014 but they were throwing in their goods there. And then they marched in\nthere and after awhile, we started hearing gunfire, you know, and we realized what\nwas going on, they were shooting them. And all of a sudden we saw this guard tar \u2014\nrunning toward us, you know, coming toward us. So we realized that they don\u2019t\nwant us here. So we started running and they kept on yelling stop, and we just took\noff. And of course, you know, being younger and faster, just took off and knew \u2014\nwe knew where we were going, they didn\u2019t. And so we escaped. But \u2014 but that\u2019s\nwhen we realized that that\u2019s what it was, you know, this is \u2014 probably \u2014 I guess this\ni\u2014 this was probably early August of 1941.February 18, 2013",
        "A: And then, you know, we sort of heard that there were some more shootings there\nafter that, but not very much. But there were continuous shooting apparently going\non in fort number nine. I mean, we heard about it. We couldn\u2019t hear, but we heard\nabout it. Well anyway, what happened then was that, let\u2019s see, about 1944, about\nFebruary, the Germans got a whole bunch of Russian war pr \u2014 prisoners of war, and\nthey were starting to dig up \u2014 that\u2019s what we heard from other people, I didn\u2019t see it\n\u2014 that they were digging up the bodies, putting them in piles and setting them on\nfire. Well, what I remember about that was that when the wind was downwin \u2014 we\nwere \u2014 lived downwind, we got this horrible smell of human bodies burned \u2014\nburning.",
        "A: No, no, no, just \u2014 just toward our for \u2014 toward \u2014 toward us [indecipherable] the\nfifth fort.",
        "A: Oh sure. We heard about it from people. Here is \u2014 here\u2019s where \u2014 where we\nwere, okay?",
        "A: Okay. Here is where we were, okay?February 18, 2013",
        "A: And the fort is right here, okay? And the fifth fort is right here. So when the\nwind would come this way, we would get the smell \u2014 the smoke, actually.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: The ninth fort \u2014 ninth fort is here.",
        "A: Yeah, northwest, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 yeah, it\u2019s northwest.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, so the nor \u2014 fort \u2014 number nine f-fort \u2014 fort number nine 1s there.",
        "A: Right there, yeah.",
        "A: No, not in nine, in fort number for \u2014 for \u2014 four being burned.",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s what I mean, that\u2019s what we witnessed.",
        "A: What we witnessed was at \u2014 what was happening in number four.",
        "A: Yes, right.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s right, but \u2014 but \u2014 but they were burning them in a \u2014 number four fort\nand we were getting the wind.",
        "A: Because we \u2014 they were here and we lived here.",
        "A: And so the \u2014 the wind would come right down toward us, you know, and I never\nforget that smell. It\u2019s just incredible. So that\u2019s my experience with \u2014 with watching\npeople led to execution. I \u2014 I \u2014 we didn\u2019t see the actual shooting because it was\ninside the fort.",
        "A: No, no, we were standing on the \u2014 on the outside on the moat and looking in.",
        "A: It\u2019s an open area in the fort.",
        "A: See, they marched them in, then they walked through some tunnel, and they\ncame in through this open area, and they marched them through this open area to\nthe other side. And this is where they were killing those people, on the other side.",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "A: No, no, no, we were too far from that.",
        "A: Beth \u2014 but we could hear the firing. We couldn\u2019t see the actual execution, but we\nsaw people going in, you know, in a \u2014 in a single row, throwing in their things and\njust marching in there.",
        "A: Oh yeah, there were children and then women, and then \u2014 then old men, mostly.",
        "A: Well, it was thousands, probably.",
        "A: Oh yeah. I\u2014 I do \u2014 I\u2014I don\u2019t know, I would guess at least a thousand or \u2014 or\nmore.February 18, 2013",
        "A: In that one group, right.",
        "A: Oh yeah, they had the \u2014 in fact, the guards were Lithuanian and Ukrainian\n[indecipherable] army.",
        "A: Yeah. The guy that came after us was a Ukrainian guy.",
        "A: Well, because the uniform.",
        "A: They had different uniform than Lithuanians.",
        "A: Well, the Ukrainian, if I remember, was light \u2014 lighter color than Lithuanian.\nLithuanian was dark green, and the Ukrainian uniforms were lighter greenish or\nbluish, as I remember it.",
        "A: Yeah, I think so. Well, it was the normal Russian uniform.February 18, 2013",
        "A: The \u2014 the color.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no. I thought we were talking about the Russian p-prisoners\nof war. Oh no, no, the guys that were marching there were Lithuanian Ukrainians.",
        "A: Okay, [indecipherable] army I said had light color uniform and Lithuanians had\na darker uniform.",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m sure it was German \u2014 German created.",
        "A: Or German by \u2014 created by German orders, because during the fort \u2014 between\n41 and 44, the Germans had organized battalions an-and regiments out of the\nLatvians and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and Estonians. And they had SS [indecipherable].\nLithuanians didn\u2019t agree to that. They were called savisagorse(ph), self-defense\nforce.",
        "A: And \u2014 and that\u2019s the way it was, you know, and so the self-defense force was \u2014\nwas participating in the \u2014 in executions and \u2014 and they were all over the place, you\nknow.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: No, no, they were wearing something modified.",
        "A: Oh yeah, we told our parents, you know, and no, I don\u2019t remember talking much\nabout it. I just don\u2019t remember mu-much talk.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s the only place, the only time I saw it.",
        "A: No.February 18, 2013",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, no.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I think we stayed away from all those. See, we lived on the\noutskirts, number four \u2014 five fort 1s on the outskirt of Kaunas and it was pretty\nempty there. You know, there was a couple of \u2014 like I want to say five homes\nprobably, around where I lived, you know, and so nobody went by there.",
        "A: Well, actually wasn\u2019t as bad as it could have, because my father had a good job,\nand he provided money to buy food for us on the black market. So we \u2014 we wou \u2014\nmy mother would go to Shaunshai(ph), to the black market there and buy food for\nthe money my father had.",
        "A: Well, yeah. So we actually, I m\u2014I must admit, I think we lived, during the 1941\nthrough \u201944, I\u2019d say we lived better than average, for sure. My family.\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "A: Okay, well, all of a sudden, you know, we \u2014 front kept on advancing, you know.\nOn the radio we could hear that the \u2014 that the Russians were now at the Ukraine\nand Russians were now in Belarus, you know. And then we could \u2014 started to hear\nthe echoes of the \u2014 of the weapons, you know, the cannons. We could hear cannons\nfiring and exploding. And so, my father realized that there\u2019s no way for us to stay\nbecause essentially he\u2019s a deserter from the Red Army. So what can we do? So my\nfather fou-found some friends in the self-defense force, who issued him some sort\nof a paper that \u2014 that would allow us to go through the border into Germany.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, the same \u2014 same people.",
        "A: So anyway, so they took us to Dresden, Germany. But my father was supposed\nto go back, and become a commander in the f \u2014 some town or something. But, on\nthe way there, Russians occupied Lithuania, so he came back, and we ended up\nworking in a factory, Seidel Naumann factory that you \u2014 before the war used to\nmake sewing machines, right now was making pieces for \u2014 for military purposes. In\nFebruary 18, 2013\nfact, I was, at that time, you know, 14 years old, and I was working in a factory with\na machine, that were parts being made together for \u2014 for the submarines.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s \u2014 and so anyway \u2014 and then we got bombed out.",
        "A: Yeah. And we got bombed out and then we moved to a little town outside\nDresden, Dippoldiswalde.",
        "A: Dip-Dippoldiswalde.",
        "A: Di-Dippoldiswalde.",
        "A: Yeah. Which is closer to the Czech border.",
        "A: No, we were on the outside \u2014 on the side.",
        "A: Oh, the buildings were destroyed.",
        "A: The factory, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah, our buildings are destroyed, so that\u2019s why we had to move out to\nsomewhere else. And so my father found a job as a\u2014 as a hofmeister.",
        "A: The \u2014 the guy responsible for \u2014 for the upkeep of the yard.",
        "A: Factory yard.",
        "A: Ye-Ye \u2014 yeah, right. You see, they \u2014 they were making also some sort of\nmilitary parts. And I got a job there as a \u2014 as a apprentice in \u2014 in their apprentice\nschool, metalworking apprentice school. And so we were working there until we \u2014\nagain we heard the guns firing around, you know, and we started going toward\nGermany, trying to go south, you know, to \u2014 to get to \u2014 to the western forces,\nbecause my father didn\u2019t want to get overrun by the Russians, you know.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I saw \u2014",
        "A: I came back to Dresden about \u2014 I would say about two weeks after the \u2014 the\nhuge bombings. And in fact, my brother and I. And we walked down to the center\nof the town. And there was this pile, you know, covered up with burlaps, you know,\nand \u2014 and we thought, what the hell is this? So we went to take a look. It was a pile\nprobably six meters high, so \u2014 so like 18 feet or so, of bodies. Dead bodies. Burned\nbodies, but dead bodies, just a pile.",
        "A: Well, they were just sitting there, they were \u2014 obviously they got collected, but\nno \u2014 but you know, they were probably digging out other people too, you know. But\nthat\u2019s what we saw. And we walked around, and we just couldn\u2019t believe you know,\nall those beautiful buildings, they\u2019re all gone, you know, in the center of \u2014 of\nDresden. And so we of course came back \u2014 came back to Dippoldiswalde the same\nday.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, I\u2014 no, no, I was in a plant.",
        "A: Yes, yes. And the building above us collapsed, but lucky for us, it didn\u2019t break\nthrough down to the basement. So we were able to walk out after the building\ncollapsed, but didn\u2019t collapse into the basement. And so we came out of the\nbasement when the fire was burning around.",
        "A: Well most \u2014 my \u2014 my \u2014 my mother was there, she was injured. As a matter of\nfact, my mother was somewhere else because we were at work, so we were\nsomewhere else. And so we came home in the day, we couldn\u2019t find our mother. So,\nfew days later we started looking for her. And so we walked in on one of the nearer\nhospitals and sure enough we found her in hallway. She already had gangrene set in\non her leg, but luckily not far enough, and we got the doctors to take care of her so\n\u2014 so sh \u2014 they didn\u2019t have to amputate her leg or anything, so she survived the\nbombing. She\u2019s the only one in our family that was hurt during the World War II.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: You survived \u2014 you survived the bombing.February 18, 2013",
        "A: Oh yeah, they were with mother, yeah.",
        "A: Because you know, I was \u2014 i1-in Dresden I was 14 years old. So my younger\nbrother was four years old, my younger sister was three years old. So they were\nwith the mother, but somehow they got back to the camp, you know, where we were\n\u2014 th-the barracks, where we were stationed.\n[break]",
        "A: \u2014 mother was gone and we couldn\u2019t quite get out of these kids what happened to\nmom.",
        "A: They took her away, you know. That\u2019s about all they could tell us.",
        "A: Oh, it was.",
        "A: It was. So finally we found \u2014 found her and \u2014 and lucky for us, you know, she \u2014\nshe survived, and \u2014 and so that\u2019s the part that I remember vividly. And then, of\ncourse, when we were living in Dippoldiswalde, nobody was bombing us there.February 18, 2013\nBut a couple of times we actually had the planes, American planes flying over in the\ndaytime and strafing them, you know, from the air fr \u2014 shooting at \u2014 on the ground.",
        "A: In fact, one time I \u2014 I\u2014 I was on the road when they were running out shooting,\nand I thought they probably shooting at me, but they didn\u2019t. Probably saw it was a\nkid, you know, so the guy didn\u2019t shoot me.",
        "A: And then my father, he was ahead of me f \u2014 because somehow we separated, he\nwas ahead of me, and he went into the doorway. And when they were firing, you\ncould see the bullet hits right around there where he stood, but \u2014 but 1t wouldn\u2019t hit\nhim because he was in a doorway, so he didn\u2019t get hit. We were a lucky family.",
        "A: So anyway, so then we started hearing the shooting outside the Dippoldiswalde,\nand we decided to get out.",
        "A: Because we \u2014 again, we didn\u2019t want to fall in the Russians. So we walked into\nCzechoslovakia.",
        "A: Yes, we had the little cart, so we had some grain, some food you know, some\ngrain and sugar, and stuff like that. And we walked for two weeks from che \u2014 from\n\u2014 to Czechoslovakia, all the way to the American zone. And when we got to\nAmerican zone, the American soldiers stopped the traffic. They wouldn\u2019t let people\ngo across the bridge. And my father said, this is something screwy. He walked off\nthe road, talked to a farmer, and asked him was there another way to get to \u2014 get out\nof here. He said yes, take this d-dirt road here, walk up, you know, two kilometers,\nturn left and you\u2019 ll walk into the road that goes right into Germany. So my father\nsays, we\u2019re not going to wait and listen to these Americans. So we walked, we get\nto the border and we see a soldier guard, American guard walking around. My\nfather looked around, he says, let\u2019s go, he won\u2019t bother us, he\u2019s talking to a girl.\nSure enough, we walked, he just kind of \u2014 I don\u2019t know if he even saw us, probably\nhe didn\u2019t. And we just walked in and sure enough, that night Americans withdrew\nfrom Czechoslovakia and Russians took over.",
        "A: So I keep on saying, you know, we were the luckiest family in World War II, to\nsurvive things like that. So anyway, so we ended up in little town called Selb, lived\nthere for a month or two, then moved to a little town called [indecipherable] townFebruary 18, 2013\ncalled Hof. Stayed there for a couple of months and then we moved to Wiirzburg,\nGermany. And we spent \u2014 in Wurzburg we spent from 1944 til about 1948 ef \u2014",
        "A: Oh no, no, no. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that \u2014 that\u2019s right, yeah, yeah, we \u2014 we were\nin \u2014 the war was still on, oh yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, the war ended in May, and so we ended up -\u2014 essentially, I think war\nstopped really, when we were en route.",
        "A: Yeah, I think that\u2019s what happened, yeah, the war was stopped when we were en\nroute. And so we got out in the American zone, and that\u2019s where we spent the next\nfive years, you know, \u201940 \u2014 \u201945 to \u2014 well, \u201944 to \u00b045 \u2014 \u00b045, yeah.",
        "A: To \u00b049.",
        "A: We lived in a displaced person camp.",
        "A: And we were fed there, and we had a high school there, so I went to school\nthere.",
        "A: I\u2014I finished high school in Germany, in Lithuanian high school.",
        "A: This was mostly Lithuanians. There was Latvians a \u2014 one building Latvians and\nthree buildings Lithuanians. And a hospital. It was a former military camp in\nWurzburg.",
        "A: My father found out that Americans \u2014 soldiers, had a warehouse and they needed\nsome workers. So he went there and applied for a job, and they gave him a job. So\nhe started working for the Americans in \u2014 in the warehouse. And then Americans\nstarted organizing guard companies. And my father told the Americans he was an\nofficer, and so they appointed him as a commander of a Lithuanian company.",
        "A: That ended up guarding Nazi prisoners in Schwaibishmint(ph) with Lithuanians\nunder Americans. They were dressed up in American uniforms, I can show you a\npicture. And \u2014 and then, what happened when the guarding stopped, they\nestablished a engineering company. And so my father became a c \u2014 a companyFebruary 18, 2013\ncommander for an engineering company that was responsible for putting bridges\nacross the Rhine.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, because he lived som \u2014 separately. We were living in Wiirzburg and he was\nin Schwaibishmint(ph), which is quite a ways apart.",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh sure, we knew that.",
        "A: Well, he didn\u2019t say may \u2014 much of it at all, you know, they were just guarding\nthe war prisoners, you know, they didn\u2019t do anything else, you know, just stand\nguard around. They were \u2014 they weren\u2019t interrogating them or doing anything. They\nwere just guarding the \u2014",
        "A: The \u2014 yeah, the p-per \u2014 per \u2014 per \u2014 per \u2014 periphery. And \u2014 and then when that\nwas over they \u2014 they appointed him commander of engineering company.\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "A: So you see, my father served in the tsar\u2019s army, in the Lithuanian army, the in\nRed Army, in the Lithuanian self-defense force for a month, and \u2014 and American\narmy.",
        "A: He was quite a guy.",
        "A: No, hardly anybody ever talked about that much.",
        "A: You know, that\u2019s a sa \u2014 that\u2019s an experience that you want to forget.",
        "A: Not much.",
        "A: Not much.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I \u2014 I think it\u2019s people, they don\u2019t want to talk about\nbad times. I don\u2019t know, it just sim \u2014 das \u2014 didn\u2019t seem to do it, you know, didn\u2019t\nseem to worry about it.",
        "A: Just the life just went on.",
        "A: Well, I'll tell you about one episode. My mother and I \u2014 this is now 1941 \u2014 my\nmother and I were walking in the middle of s \u2014 Kaunas city, and we walked up\nthere across the street, and there is a\u2014 a German Gestapo guy and a Lithuanian\npoliceman.",
        "A: And they stopped us. And the Lithuanian guard asked my mother why she didn\u2019t\nhave her David star on.",
        "A: Well, look at my mother, she looks a little Jewish, doesn\u2019t she?",
        "A: So he decided that she had to be Jewish, you know. And so she pushed up \u2014\nlucky for her she had a passport with her which said that she was Lithuanian and\nCatholic.",
        "A: This is when they got married.",
        "A: 1926, I think.",
        "A: So\u2014so I must admit that, no matter what you think of your father, now when I\nlook back, I think he was a very, very cunning man. He understood the \u2014 the\nsituation, and he was a survivalist. He knew how to survive.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. Yeah, he \u2014 he was quite a man. And he came to the United States,\nhe got a job in a store \u2014 in a\u2014 1n a factory making furniture. And while he was\nworking there, he decided he wanted to buy a house in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\nWell, he went to \u2014 to look at one house and he said, well, we\u2019d like to buy it. AndFebruary 18, 2013\nthe guy says, can you afford it? And my father, well [indecipherable] how much I\nmake. The guy said, I\u2019ll give you a job in my factory for more, so you can pay this.",
        "A: So my father got a job in the \u2014 in a company that was making \u2014 if you remember\nor seen some of these brass plates that people ha \u2014 hu \u2014 used to hang in the 50s in\ntheir kitchens?",
        "A: There used to be brass plates. Well, the guy was making those kind of things,\nand my father was in a quality control. He worked until he was sev \u2014 he was 19 sev\n\u2014he 78 years old.",
        "A: And \u2014 and the reason he quit because he \u2014 they discovered he had cancer. He\ndied four years later.",
        "A: It is.",
        "A: Remarkable.",
        "A: A survivalist you know.February 18, 2013",
        "A: Not only that, in 1938, Lithuania had their so-called Lithuanian nat \u2014 Lietuvos\ntautinis olimpinio, the Lithuanian National Olympics. My father, using horses,\nwon two gold medals and one silver.",
        "A: In equestrian ma \u2014 events.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. A remarkable man.",
        "A: But he was strict.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Oh yeah. When he said something, you did it.",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 it started \u2014 by \u2014 by that time I was in \u2014 in the United States, I think.",
        "A: When I started reading about it, hearing about it, you know, and then connecting\nto what I saw to what they were talking about. So essentially I started to connect\nthings, probably after I came to the United States.",
        "A: Well, I was 20 years old when I came to the United States.",
        "A: No, we never talked much about the Holocaust or Jews.",
        "A: No, my \u2014 my family never discussed it. And it just \u2014 it just \u2014 as I say, you know,\nwe just stayed away from these subjects.",
        "A: Well, it became of interest to me after I came here to the United States and I\nstarted reading about it and I found out that my mother had some Jewish roots. And\nI got interested in the Jewish history and I started reading it. And \u2014 and in fact, I\u2019m\njust reading a book now, written by an American lady who spent 10 years studying\nLithuanian Jews, their history and what happened during the Holocaust in\nparticular.February 18, 2013",
        "A: I can\u2019t think of the name of it right now.",
        "A: But I have it on the \u2014 can\u2019t think of the a \u2014 the name of the author or \u2014 but it\u2019s \u2014\nit\u2019s \u2014 hm, go into the room there if you want to, and see \u2014 see if you can see a\nbrown book.",
        "A: Okay, okay.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, I married a Lithuanian girl from Chicago. And we were married for about\n37 years, and then she just one day departed. Just left me a note, and that was it.\nAnd we had one daughter, who went to UCLA, got a Bachelor\u2019s degree there, and\nthen got Master\u2019s degree in connectic \u2014 Connecticut \u2014 kinesthesiology. That\u2019s the\nstudy of human body. And then ended up at medical school at Northwestern and\nbecame interventional radiologist.",
        "A: I was an engineer, electrical engineer. I worked for Hughes Aircraft for 29\nyears.",
        "A: Well, they part \u2014 essentially participated in a part of Holocaust.",
        "A: Okay, my father-in-law Darsha(ph) Starkus told me the story.",
        "A: He and a guy by the name of Belkinus(ph) went to medical school together. And\nthe Belkinus(ph) was a Jew. And so then, by coincidence, they \u2014 he \u2014 Dr. Starkus\nended up as a district doctor of this small district in \u2014 in Lithuania, around\nDiletus(ph).",
        "A: And it turned out to be Belkin(ph) ended up there too. And they used to get\ntogether occasionally. Well, one day, when they started pe \u2014 pushing people into the\nghettos, my father-in-law, Dr. Starkus was going to work, and he saw Dr.\nBelkin(ph) with his wife and a daughter, with suitcases going towards the railroad\nstation. He said, where you going? Well, Vilijampole. He said, you know what\u2019sFebruary 18, 2013\ngoing on there, don\u2019t go. He says, where can I go? Come with me. He took the\nfamily to his sister-in-law house and put them up there. In the meantime, as a doctor\nof that district, he became friends with a German \u2014 with a German commander of\nthe town, or of the district. And he used to come occasionally to visit and for dinner.\nWell, one day he came in, you know, and he says, I\u2019ve got to leave early today\nbecause we have to go to south side of Aytus to arrest Jews that are people housing.",
        "A: So the German one way, the father-in-law the other, ran over to that sister-in-\nlaw\u2019s house, put the people in a car and drove them to another place, and then the\nfollowing day he found a place to put them with a f\u2014 some of his acquaintance that\nhad a farm next to th \u2014 to \u2014 to the woods \u2014 to the fl \u2014 you know. And apparently\nthey built a double wall somewhere where they could hide if somebody came. And\nDr. Belkin(ph) and his wife stayed there, but the d-daughter, they couldn\u2019t keep her\nthere. So Dr. Starkus arranged with a priest to give him a birth certificate of \u2014 of a\ndead girl as hers. And he put up with \u2014 with \u2014 with an older lady, a friend of his, or\na \u2014 someone he knew. And that\u2019s how they survived the war.",
        "A: The whole Belkin(ph) family survived. And the little girl was \u2014 was \u2014 was\nchristened to be a Christian \u2014 Catholic, by the lady. Anyway, they had a little hardFebruary 18, 2013\ntime \u2014 well, of course, and then the Russians came. And of course Dr. Belkin(ph)\nand his wife survived and their little daughter survived. And the little \u2014 they had the\nlittle trouble getting the girl back because the woman didn\u2019t want to give her up,\nafter three years or so.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Anyway, so then, of course, it worked out fine and \u2014",
        "A: Well, when the lady that \u2014 the lady that housed them in Alytus, Dr. Starkus\u2019\nsister-in-law died, and I went to her funeral there and Mrs. Belkin(ph) was there, I\nthink Dr. Belkin(ph) by then was dead. And she died shortly after that, I think. Her\ndaughter, the young lady, still survives and she lives in Vilnius.",
        "A: And she\u2019s married, you know, lives in Vilnius, has her own family.",
        "A: Yeah. That\u2019s the last I heard.",
        "A: \u00b092 - 93.",
        "A: Some \u2014 somewhere around there, yeah.",
        "A: But he wasn\u2019t at the funeral, but s \u2014 but his wife was there.",
        "A: So I saw her and met her.",
        "A: Just said hello and that was about it.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m not sure. I kind of doubt it.",
        "A: I kind of doubt it.",
        "A: Well, Dr. Starkus \u2014 after we got married, Dr. Starkus retired at the age of some\n\u2014 70 something and moved to Santa Monica, and lived here until he died in the\nearly 90s.",
        "A: Oh no, late 90s, I guess.",
        "A: Yeah, late 90s, yeah. And then his wife survived for another two years, died in\nHawaii, and they\u2019re buried here in Los Angeles.",
        "A: You know, I used to go to some meetings, you know, and I met a Jewish fellow\nwho was part of the organization here, the Holocaust or whatever you call it, here in\nLos Angeles.",
        "A: Yeah, something, you know, he was member of that. And I kind of told him the\nstory, so he wanted to talk to Dr. Starkus. Dr. Starkus refused. He didn't want to\ntalk about it.",
        "A: You know, there are some things that happened, I think when the Russians came\nand liberated Lithuania from the Germans. But Dr. Belkin(ph) became a doctor in\nAlytus in \u2014 in the prison there. And the lady that I\u2019m talking about that \u2014 that\nhoused these \u2014 these people, her husband was arrested and shot there. And they\nwere all upset, you know, that he didn\u2019t help him. They think he didn\u2019t help him,February 18, 2013\nmy opinion is he could not help them. But anyway \u2014 and so that kind of broke up\nthe friendship.",
        "A: Because he participated in the \u2014 in the execution of \u2014 of daw \u2014 of Byerchus(ph).",
        "A: Byerchus(ph).",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Byerchus(ph), he was \u2014 he was caught by the Russians in a bunker \u2014",
        "A: \u20141n Lithuania, he was a partisan.",
        "A: And so somebody, you know, squealed on them, and th \u2014 and the Russians found\nthem and essentially took him in and killed him.",
        "A: SO.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "A: So I think that sort of put some friction there, between the families.",
        "A: And I think \u2014 I personally think it\u2019s unjustified, because there is nothing he could\nhave done.",
        "A: But that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the story there.",
        "A: That\u2019s what I know.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know. I think the fact that when I found out that there was a Jewish\nconnection in my family, I \u2014 I got interested, you know, and tried to track it and I\ncouldn\u2019t get anywhere, in Lithuania. You know, because the documents were kept\nvery poorly and so on, and \u2014 and so, no I couldn\u2019t track anything down. But, in\ngeneral, I got interested in it, and the more I read, the more interested I got, you\nknow, to find out what \u2014 what went on. And so I\u2014 I\u2014I read quite a few books, you\nknow, and \u2014 and in fact I just finished, some time ago, a book about a thousandFebruary 18, 2013\npages which is a diary of a Jewish lawyer that survived all these wars, and ended up\nin Israel and then depa \u2014 and then become internationally known as a la-lawyer and\nso on. Well, he wrote \u2014 he preserved most of his diary from those days in Kaunas\nghetto.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: In English, in English, it\u2019s a big book, and I can\u2019t even \u2014 I think it just says diary\nsomething.",
        "A: I can find out what was [indecipherable] But anyway \u2014",
        "A: Beg pardon?",
        "A: Yes! That\u2019s it.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s the guy, that\u2019s his diary.",
        "A: Well, I learned what \u2014 what happened, how the life went on there. Because, you\nknow, we didn\u2019t see it, you know. Things went on [indecipherable] inside, you\nknow, and \u2014 and we see ok \u2014 you know, like we used to see was groups of Jews\nbeing escorted from one place to another. That\u2019s about all we saw, you know, in\nyellow stars. And as I say, you know, my mother got stopped because she looked\nJewish [indecipherable] they wanted to know where her star was. So \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I just became interested, you know, and the more I\nread, the more interested I got. And so essentially \u2014 a little while back\n[indecipherable] published a little review of a book by this woman, and I just\nstarted reading it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, it is. That\u2019s right, that\u2019s what I have.",
        "A: Yeah, I started reading it.",
        "A: Yeah, so anyway, and that [indecipherable] diary, I gave it to a friend of mine,\nso he is reading it.",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, Remus(ph) Kaminskas(ph), yeah. He is reading it. I think\nthat\u2019s who I gave it to, yeah, I think it\u2019s Remus(ph). So anyway \u2014 so that\u2019s why \u2014\nhow I developed interest you know, in \u2014 in following genocide, and then especially\nLithuanian.",
        "A: And being quite aware, in Lithuania of \u2014 of mo \u2014 mo \u2014 the opinion that people\nspread about the Jews, you know, that\u2019s a \u2014 and I think it was primarily jealousy,\nbecause Jews, you know, well organized people, they helped each other, opened up\nbusinesses, were successful. And by golly, you know, people said well, you know,\nJews are taking it over. Well, sure they taking over. Why? Because they work and \u2014\nand \u2014 and \u2014 and create, and get educated.",
        "A: Well, I think that somebody could create a \u2014 a \u2014 a seminars or something about\nit, but \u2014 but I\u2019m not sure that it would work.",
        "A: Well, you know, I guess now is there\u2019s some guilt in among the Lithuanians, you\nknow. Because let\u2019s face it, you know where the Holocaust started?",
        "A: Lithuania.",
        "A: Read the \u2014 read that Cassedy\u2019s book.",
        "A: That\u2019s what it tells you.",
        "A: That\u2019s where it all started.",
        "A: Well, because they started executing people first, even before the Poles did.\nThat\u2019s why.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s probably Germans with \u2014 with other help.",
        "A: I think there was a battalion of Lithuanians that participated in that.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m not sure in Poland, but I know in Lithuania.",
        "A: Yeah, I don\u2019t know about Poland, no I don\u2019t know about Poland. But \u2014 but\nessentially, years ago, it was haven for the pole \u2014 for the Jews to come, because\npeople were tolerated. And then it became anti-Semitic place because there were so\nmany of them there, and they were \u2014 and they were keeping themselves, you know,\nas a separate class, and then hatred developed. Or I should say, you know,\nmisunderstanding or whatever you want to call, developed between the two groups,\nbecause essentially, Jew was not Lithuanian, he was Jew. He just lived here. That\u2019s\nthe way they looked.",
        "A: You know? Even today they think they look the same way.",
        "A: Well, I would ask him if he\u2019s interested to hear about it.",
        "A: And it he isn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t tell him anything. You know, how can you tell\nsomebody that doesn\u2019t want to listen?",
        "A: SO.",
        "A: Well, you know, I think there\u2019s a process in Lithuania gaining \u2014 getting people\nto \u2014 to understand the \u2014 th-the \u2014 the unity of people to understand the relationship\namong the people, because [indecipherable] way, part of the Euro \u2014 European usa\n\u2014 union. People are interchanging, people are all mixing. And I think that\u2019s\nassimilation process. And I think that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s gonna help. You know, Lithuania\u2019s\nlosing people to immigration. The number of Lithuanian pop-population has\ndecreased.",
        "A: I think it\u2019s around 500,000 people have left, out of three million.",
        "A: That\u2019s a lot",
        "A: That\u2019s a lot.",
        "A: Okay.",
