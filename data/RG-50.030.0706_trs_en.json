So when I\nwent with my father to that room, the thing what impressed me most, my memory,\nwas the terrible smoke. And you know, he said, you speak to his people who were\nplaying cards with him, and stuff like that. Then, most likely my mother picked me\nup, and we went wherever we went.",
        "Q: Did \u2014",
        "A: You know, he was not a com \u2014 extra \u2014 he was a regular father, 1n my opinion.\nUnfortunately, what happened later, naturally wi\u2014 no, I shouldn\u2019t say split.

I\nmean, pork was not like here, you know, pork \u2014 people don\u2019t eat pork. And I don\u2019t\neat it now either. My f\u2014 every day I fish. But, you know, that changed over the time.\nBut back \u2014 at those \u2014 at that time, when I was maybe 13, 15, I remember that I went\nwith my mother, whatever she was doing, on that [speaks Czech] I don\u2019t remember,May 4, 2013\nbut we went in \u2014 down south, and there was that butcher store where we stopped by,\nand had some bite of whatever, and go to [indecipherable] back home.",

        "A: So she was closer to me than my father.",
        "Q: Your father. But if you ate pork, that means that your parents didn\u2019t observe the\ndietary \u2014 the pa \u2014 your parents didn\u2019t observe the dietary laws \u2014",

But you\ncame to the bil \u2014 call it building, house, on a\u2014 on a regular day, especially Saturday,\nthe house was like a \u2014 smelled like a restaurant, because everybody was cooking the\nsame thing. We were doing the same thing like our neighbors, whether they were\nJewish, or Christians, or what \u2014 that was not the subject, nobody cared about this.",
        "Q: Did \u2014",
        "A: I\u2019m talking about when I was a small boy \u2014",
        "Q: I understand.\nMay 4, 2013",

        "A: Oh, definitely.",
        "Q: \u2014 because it was a new country?",
        "A: Definitely. Not only that, but our constitution was identical to the US.\nconstitution, because the U \u2014 you know, the United States president at that time,\nWilson, was very instrumental of carving out Czechoslovakia. You would have to\nknow more about the history, but Europe was occu \u2014 no, I shouldn\u2019t say occupied,\nsay ruled by the Austrian-Hungarian empire.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And that was the House of the Hapsburgs, king of Hapsburgs, or whatever he\nwas, emperor, I don\u2019t remember that part. And everything \u2014 the language was much\nmore German, because the Czechs were part of that Austrian empire. But then one\nof the \u2014 one of the principle politicians over there at the time, Masarek(ph), he\npetitioned \u2014 came here, and he petitioned Wilson, and I don\u2019t know who came afterMay 4, 2013\nhim, or before him, to es \u2014 to give the Czechs the [indecipherable] determination\nright.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So they calfed(ph) out of that Austrian empire afterward, during World War I,\nCzechoslovakia. There was no Czechoslovakia before. There was \u2014 the state was\ncalled Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia. Those were three states which were, so to\nspeak, the bone of Czechoslovakia. So when, apparently here, or there, when they\nrealize it\u2019s too small to be independent, somehow they attached Slovakia to it. And\nthat\u2019s why it became Czechoslovakia. The original three states \u2014",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: \u2014 and then another two or three states to the \u2014 I say to the \u2014 to the \u2014",
        "Q: To the east a little bit.",

        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: So, the very eastern part of Czechoslovakia was very close to Russia, and that\u2019s\nwhy it was so, later on, during World War I], Czechoslovakia \u2014 Czechoslovakia\nwas ceded to the Russian sphere of influence.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll come to those things. We\u2019ll come to those things.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s the truth.May 4, 2013",

        "Q: \u2014 school did you go to?",
        "A: \u2014 school \u2014 I went to a German school, because at \u2014 wi \u2014 you know,\nCzechoslovakia, that time there was no Czechoslovakia, so when Czechoslovakia\nwas founded, just like here, you had a better chance to get a position when you\nspeak Spanish, and certainly English. So there, my mother, I remember her saying\nall the time, whatever you want to do in life, you have to talk Czech, which was our\nlanguage \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 but you have learn German. So, I went to a German school.",
        "Q: Did you speak \u2014 at home \u2014",

        "Q: Okay. Did your parents know Yiddish at all?May 4, 2013",
        "A: Not at all. The first time I heard Yiddish, you would not believe it, when I was\ngoing to Auschwitz. I never heard of Yiddish. There was Czech, or German. Now,\nif you didn\u2019t speak well German, maybe you had some kind of a mishmash of\nGerman, but not Yiddish. I have \u2014 my friends they was all Czechs, I mean, who\nspoke anything else but Czech?",
        "Q: Your \u2014 did you know anything of your family history, beyond your father and\nmother and maybe grandparents?",
        "A: Yes, th-this \u2014 somehow \u2014 my father used to say that his family came from \u2014 that\nwould be west \u2014 from the southwest of Bohemia. And he was \u2014 he thought that his\nancestor were Catholics, but there were \u2014 you know, there was all kinds of reforms\ngoing on under \u2014 not Martin Luther King here \u2014",
        "Q: I know.",
        "A: \u2014 but the original Luther.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And there was also somebody in \u2014 in Prague by the name of Jan Hus, h-u-s.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: So there was a certain split in the \u2014 in the religion.",
        "Q: And certainly within Catholicism.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.May 4, 2013",
        "Q: In the Middle Ages.",
        "A: And \u2014 and he thinks that instead of choosing the sides between the two split\nCzech \u2014 Catholic religion, that they chose the Jewish religion. This why our name is\nnot Jewish, you know, our name \u2014 the Jewish, let\u2019s say, names in Prague, they were\nthe Feldmans, like my wife\u2019s single name, or the Schwarzkopf(ph), just like here.",
        "Q: They were like more Germanic names.",
        "A: Exactly. Now look, here somebody is called Schwarzkopf(ph), you know he is\nsomehow Jewish.",
        "Q: Or German.",
        "A: Or German.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Well, that was exactly in Prague. So to know somebody by the name of Pekarek\nand be Jewish, that didn\u2019t exist. And I will tell you a small story when I was a kid,\nand I went to the German school, not speaking German. But I remember that my\nteacher, that was the first grade, second grade, you know, I was what, six, seven\nyears old. Somehow she is \u2014 there was some question about religion, and she assign\nme to the class, or to the time to have religious schooling, to the Catholic class,\nbecause of the Czech name. Well, I didn\u2019t speak any German, but somehow I\nobjected to it, and I said that I was Jewish. Th \u2014 so she sent me to the Jewish class,May 4, 2013\nor whatever, but I remember the name, that was not a Jewish name at all. Now, this\n\u2014 we were Jewish. This \u2014 we were born as Jewish people, but then, unfortunately\nwhat happened \u2014 I told you I was not a very proud Jew, no, because everything what\nhappened was because of the Jewish faith. And lots of things happened, ma-maybe\nwe come to it.",
        "Q: Yes, we come to \u2014",
        "A: But so \u2014",
        "Q: I guess \u2014",
        "A: The name I change for different reason. If you want me to tell it to you now, Pll\ntell it to you now.",
        "Q: Yes, let\u2019s do \u2014 let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s do it \u2014 let \u2014 tell \u2014",
        "A: Well, we were \u2014 my name was Pekarek.",
        "Q: Pekarek.",
        "A: I married Georgine, she was Pekarek, of course. And then what happened 1 \u2014 th-\nthat was 1947 \u2014 \u2019\u00b048, the infl \u2014 at that time, the influence of Soviet Russia was\ntremendous. Why? Because that goes to polit \u2014 politics. The Czechs always felt that\nthe west let them down. Th-The \u2014 the che \u2014 the \u2014 the west means England, not the\nUnited States, the United States was out of this world. But England, France,\npartially Italy, that instead of helping the Czechs, so to speak, maintain theirMay 4, 2013\nidentity, freedom, they let them down, and then in turn, Hitler marched in, and the\nwhole situation has changed. So the Russia influence was very strong. We,\nGeorgine and me, we didn\u2019t care for it, because we have seen what happened when\nyou don\u2019t have freedom. We both survived Auschwitz, we came back in 1945, and\nwere living in Prague as best as we could have done it, until \u201947 - \u201948. But when the\nsituation became very, very difficult, we didn\u2019t like it. We thought again, we might\nhave to go through the same thing. Maybe not the extremes, but hardly the freedom\nwhich we were hoping for. Well, we decided to get out of Czechoslovakia, which\nwas 19 four \u2014 late \u201947, early \u201948. I couldn\u2019t get out, because I was, quote, military\nage. So I thought that if I somehow split with Georgine, that by myself I will be\neasier to get out than two of us with luggage and all and that stuff. That\u2019s how we\nthought of it. Well, I met somebody by the name of Hyde. His name was Walter E.\nHyde. Through him, I got a English passport. So Georgine left Prague in February\n1948. I couldn\u2019t get out that quickly. In the meantime she went from Prague to\nLondon, stayed in London for a while. From her mother\u2019s side, they were here,\nsurviving the situation in Ecuador. Now, of the f \u2014 all these countries, I\u2019 Il tell you\nwhy Ecuador. That was Georgine\u2019s uncle from her mother\u2019s side; he was a dentist.\nBut he didn\u2019t care for dentistry, he was more like a businessman sitting on the board\nof directors here, sitting on the board of directors there. And somehow he became\nMay 4, 2013\nconsul general of Ecuador. Well, how he got Ecuador, I can\u2019t tell you. But that\u2019s\nhow it was. So it was \u2014 unfortunately, the situation became worse, before Hitler and\nall that stuff. He was trying to convince Georgine\u2019s mother and father to go to\nEcuador because he was able to give them the visa to go to Ecuador. Well, my\nmother, you know, they were in a different situation. They had a house like a house,\nand those days there were no mortgages in Prague. So to leave your house, to leave\nyour business, that was unheard of. Why should I go to Ecuador to listen to those\nidiots down there, or something? This is my home. Well, unfortunately, it didn\u2019t\nwork out in the long run, but since they survived in Ecuador, in Quito, they came\nafter the war here, like most of people usually do. So when Georgine was in\nEngland, she heard, of course, of her aunt and uncle, that they were here \u2014 they\nwere in Ecuador at that time. But they know they were living in \u2014 in Ecuador.\nThey came here and that uncle of hers had some earlier connections to somebody\nwho was a manufacturing person. And because of the Cold War which existed\nalready at that time, somehow the United States government was pumping much\nmore money into Puerto Rico, as a prevention that Puerto Rico wouldn\u2019t go too\nmuch left, like some of the countries did.",
        "Q: Right.May 4, 2013",
        "A: So he was \u2014 he was offered to build a factory in Puerto Rico. So since that uncle,\nwho was a dentist representative of Ecuador, he told him, well, if you just came\nfrom Ecuador, you speak Spanish, you want to manage my factory\n[indecipherable] from Prague. So they settled to Puerto Rico for some time. So\nGeorgine, not having any other family, from England, went to the United States,\nwent to Puerto Rico.",
        "Q: Rico.",
        "A: So we stayed, of course, I was in Prague. Not divorced, that was not the question\n[indecipherable]. But I managed to get out of Prague. By myself it was easier than\ntogether with Georgine. So, when I got out of Prague, naturally I had nowhere to\ngo. But the train took me to Paris. Well, I have to say something in favor of the\nFrench, irrespective of their view today, of that view. The French, at that time, were\nextremely helpful. They tried to reunite families who were split, you didn\u2019t know\nwhere \u2014 last time saw him here, last time you saw him there. So it was very difficult,\nbut the French were helping. And they were helping also, the people like myself,\nwho all of a sudden, from Prague, was in Paris. We were called DPs, displaced\npeople. And I got to Paris couple days before July 14\", I\u2019m sure you know what\nJuly 14\" is. Well at that time, of course, that time was the different. That was 1948,\nand de Gaulle was still around, and he was running down Champs Elysees, I\nMay 4, 2013\nremember like today. When I did go to France, to Paris, I was supposed to see\nsomebody who somebody knew somebody in Prague, and I was supposed to see\nthose people. So those people took me to that celebration of July 14\". Now,\nspreading out this story which I\u2019m just telling you, my sister \u2014 or rather, my mother\nhad a sister, who had married a Viennese person, all Jewish, but she didn\u2019t like the\nsituation as it was. And, before Hitler came in, she decided, with the husband, to go\nto, at that time Palestine. There was no Israel. You had to take the boat, which was\nvery difficult, because Prague is right in the middle of Europe, there\u2019s no ocean\naround.",
        "Q: There\u2019s no Czech navy.",
        "A: There\u2019s no \u2014 no Czech navy, no nothing. But she managed somehow, through\nsomeone else, to get the per \u2014 the documents, and she survived the Hitler years in\nJerusalem. [indecipherable] I \u2014 I don\u2019t know which town she survived, but she\nwas there. So when she came back to Prague looking for her family, but there was\nno family except us, my sister, me. But she didn\u2019t like it because she said exactly\nwhat we have found out later on. That it\u2019s too autocratic, too left-wingish, and she\nthought there was no future for Czechoslovakia to survive again. So somehow she\nhas some friends in Australia. So she convinced my sister to go with her. The \u2014May 4, 2013\nincidentally, the husband of my aunt passed away, and he is buried on the mount \u2014\nwhat is the name of the mountain in Israel? I forgot the name of the mountain.",
        "Q: But he\u2019s buried there?",
        "A: Yeah, he is buried there.",
        "Q: Right there.",
        "A: But she came back by herself, and she convinced my sister to go with her to\nAustralia. Now, my sister, you know, she was very much into languages. So, for her\nto speak English, French, Italian, although she was born in Prague, she spoke all\nthese languages. So, she was \u2014 for her to go to Australia was no problem, she spoke\nEnglish. So they went to Australia. Well, the trip to Australia by boat, that\u2019s a long\ndistance, this is not around the corner. So when they arrived in Australia, I was in\ntouch with them, or they were in touch with me, they helped me to get to Australia.\nAnd the French \u2014",
        "Q: From Paris?",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "Q: From Paris?",
        "A: From Paris. But, from Paris you had to go to Marseilles, and the ship to s \u2014\nthere, took 60 days.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.May 4, 2013",
        "A: Well, this how it was. So in the 60 days, I got into Australia in January \u00b049. I left\nJuly \u00b048, I got into Australia January \u201949. So when I go to Australia, of course,\nGeorgine, we were married. She took the first plane, and she came to Australia,\nand we were living in Melbourne for a few years.",
        "Q: Okay. At this point we want to find out, when did you become Frank Hyde?\nWas it when you got \u2014",
        "A: Because Georgine was \u2014 sh-she had a passport 1n the name of Hyde.",
        "Q: Ah, so that \u2014",
        "A: So I didn\u2019t like to be someone else, so I dro \u2014 and the name, at that time in\nAustralia, to have a Czech name was \u2014 they couldn\u2019t pronounce it, and \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, so my point \u2014 my question is, is did you get that passport when Walter\nHyde provided you with the \u2014 and you chose Hyde as your name, or did you change\nyour name when you were in Australia?",
        "A: No, I changed my name only after we got the passport in the [indecipherable] if\nthe passport would have been in the name of MacDonald, I would be MacDonald.",
        "Q: Excuse me, but what I don\u2019t understand is when that \u2014 you got that passport\nwhile you were still in Prague, or when you got to Australia?",
        "A: No, we got it in Prague, that\u2019s how Georgine got out, she got out as Georgine\nHyde.May 4, 2013",
        "Q: Okay, so you chose, or \u2014",
        "A: I chose because of her name, that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: \u2014 because of the gentleman who provided them, at that point you changed your\nnames?",
        "A: Not at that point, but at \u2014 eventually, yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. So the \u2014",
        "A: And see, she had the name Hyde, and \u2014",
        "Q: Excuse me, but I don\u2019t understand where is eventually. Is eventually when you\ngot it in \u2014 when you got the passports in Prague, or when you were in Australia?",
        "A: No, I got that passport in Prague.",
        "Q: And it had your name, Frank Hyde in it?",
        "A: Well, I was still Frank Pekarek.",
        "Q: But she was Georgine Hyde.",
        "A: But she was Georgine Hyde. So she got out as Georgine Hyde, and she was\nliving in austral \u2014 in \u2014 in England as Georgine Hyde.",
        "Q: Ahhh.",
        "A: Because she had a British passport.May 4, 2013",
        "Q: A-And when you got out, you still were Pekarek.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: And then when you got to Melbourne is when you changed it.",
        "A: Then I lost the Pekarek, sure. I have here to show you, if you want to come to\nmy office, I have a certificate that I passed an accounting test as Pekarek.",
        "Q: I see. Okay.",
        "A: So it was very difficult.",
        "Q: And then in \u2014 in Melbourne is when you changed your name?",
        "A: Here. I changed the name here \u2014",
        "Q: In the United States?",
        "A: \u20141in the United States, yes.",
        "Q: I see. Okay.",
        "A: When we were living in Queens, I\u2019ve \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the name of the lawyer\nwho did it, but it\u2019s un \u2014 my legal name here \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u20141s Frank pek \u2014 not Frank Pekarek, but Frank Hyde.",
        "Q: Got it.",
        "A: I kept the P from Pekarek.",
        "Q: Okay.May 4, 2013",
        "A: It\u2019s not Peter, it\u2019s the P I kept for sentimental reasons, for my father\u2019s sake, shall\nI say? So \u2019'm Frank Hyde, and John \u2014 John, my son, of course, was born as John\nHyde. Everything is back to John Hyde \u2014 I mean, Frank Hyde, Georgine Hyde.",
        "Q: Okay. So let\u2019s go back to Prague, and the \u2014 in the mid to late 1930s.",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to Prague, it\u2019s the mid to late 1930s, and you\u2019re in school.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s a new country, it\u2019s not even 20 years old. What happens in the political\natmosphere?",
        "A: No, you see, what happened, when the situation has gradually changing in\nCzechoslovakia \u2014",
        "Q: Before the Germans come in?",
        "A: Before the German came \u2014 well, they was \u2014 I don\u2019t know how much history you\nknow, but there were negotiations somehow, the influence of Hitler.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That was a story the other day in \u201cThe Wall Street Journal,\u201d exactly what I\u2019m\ntelling you, if the allied forces at that time would have done something to stop\nHitler, that would not have happened, but they were not interested, maybe the\nMay 4, 2013\ninterest was somewhere else. So, he became too powerful. There was also a\nrecession in that world. Was a recession here \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 because \u2014 because \u2014 whatever they call it here.",
        "Q: Depression.",
        "A: A depression, that\u2019s correct. So, he promised jobs, and he promi \u2014 he didn\u2019t say\nhow, but what he did, you have t \u2014 again, I\u2019m talking about history, after World War\nI, the French and German were not always friends.",
        "Q: Okay, excuse me, I\u2019m going to interrupt. What I am interested to know is, did\nHitler have an influence before he marched in the country, before he marched into\nCzechoslovakia, and took it over, when you say things changed gradually, was it\nsuch that it \u2014 internal life in Czechoslovakia changed for the Jews, even before\nHitler came? That\u2019s what my question is.",
        "A: Not really.",
        "Q: Not really.",
        "A: I\u2014 not to my knowledge, no.",
        "Q: Okay.May 4, 2013",
        "A: No. What changed was, like I said, there were negotiations, they wa \u2014 he had\ncertain demands. The border countries of that old Bohemia, which was somehow\ncreated by \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 this government here, to give them \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 border. That was occupied by German minorities. But since the constitution\nwas like here, everybody was alike, and there was no ant \u2014 anti-German feeling, or\nanything like that. But, let\u2019s go back to that recession which we had. So, when that\nwas all the world was the depression, and Hitler promised jobs. Now, how did he\ndeliver the job? Because, like I started to say, after World War I, the League of\nNation, which was the forerunner of the United Nations, they thought Germany, not\nHitler, there was Hindenburg, which was the president.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They told him, you cannot go to this area of Europe, and in this area of Europe,\nwhich was called the Saar, s-a-a-r. And another place goes by.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Which was something like say, our Detroit, with the factories of automobiles \u2014",
        "Q: Right.May 4, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 and all this.",
        "Q: The Ruhrgebeit.",
        "A: So he invaded those two places, and nobody stopped him. If they would have\nstopped him, maybe he wouldn\u2019t have been so powerful. But because they didn\u2019t\nstop him, maybe they didn\u2019t have the power to stop him.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: He has grown. So there was no \u2014 no anti-Semitism in Prague, or anything of that\nnation. Everybody was Czech, and on the contrary, if you didn\u2019t speak well Czech,\nyou were \u2014 somehow you \u2014 you were not liked, if I can say that word. And in that\nconnection, I would also like to tell you, into my house where I was living,\nsomebody moved in from Poland, ab \u2014 what used to call 1s \u2014 a Polish Jew. His name\nwas Ehrlstein(ph). Well, the name tells you already, German Jew, so \u2014 he became a\nleader of the Jewish population at that time, because somebody has to represent the\nJews \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u20141n connection to the Czech government \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 and what followed, the German government. So he was appointed to be leader\nof the Jewish community. Since he moved into the house where we were living,May 4, 2013\nspoke poorly Czech \u2014 German was not liked, because we were now, all of a sudden,\nenemies with the German \u2014 my mother had his wife to go shopping, and all this\nstuff. Now that [indecipherable] they\u2019re all down the road, why we stayed in\nPrague longer than other people who were already deported, in camp number one.",
        "Q: Okay. Let\u2019s come to the point where Pll \u2014 Pll speed ahead a little bit. I \u2014 I -\nokay, if it 1s so that life didn\u2019t change in the late 1930s for you, in \u2014",
        "A: Not until 1937 - 1938.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It was the same.",
        "Q: All right, what happened in 1937?",
        "A: Well, the Czechs were forced to give up some of these border countries. So there\nwas a resentment against the rest, because officially Russia was \u2014 officially. They\nwere not doing much, but officially they were. So, the negotiations were primarily\nbetween Germany, France \u2014 | can even tell you the name of the prime minister of\nGermany, who was negotiating at that time, wa \u2014 he was a [indecipherable] from\nlike a \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, he was a aristocrat.",
        "A: Yeah, aristocrat. His name was Ribbentroph(ph). Well, I \u2014 the \u2014 some other\nname came back to me, and on the Italian side was Count Charnow(ph). And thoseMay 4, 2013\npeople were pushing \u2014 well, at that time they were negotiating with Prime Minister\nChamberlain. Now, naturally, in those days, when you gave your word, you were\nsupposed to keep your word. So Hitler, through Chamberlain, through\nRibbentroph(ph), and Italian Charnow(ph), Hitler promised the dema \u2014 the\ndemand on the Czechs to give up those border countries, is his last territorial\ndemand. Chamberlain believed it, because in those days, when you signed\nsomething, you were believing. So he went back to - Chamberlain went back to\nLondon, where he came from, and showed a piece of paper, and this piece of paper\nis a guarantee of peace in our lifetime. Well, he didn\u2019t realize whom he was deali \u2014\ndealing with. But coming back to \u2014 to the Czechs, so there was a certain animosity,\nof course, because all of a sudden, instead of having the country like this, it was like",
        "Q: Sliced.",
        "A: \u2014 sliced, and you know, undefensible(ph).",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And in the \u2014 the \u2014 the attitude towards German was all of a sudden they were not\nour citizens, they were our enemies, because they wanted to join Germany.",
        "Q: Right.May 4, 2013",
        "A: Primarily because he promised jobs, which we couldn\u2019t deliver at the time. So\nnow all the European continent really turned pro-German. The Austrians, they want\nto be German. They were German speaking people, but they were so different from\nactually Germany, that it was not \u2014 you know, th-thinking about, he promised jobs,\nand he delivered the jobs. Making his armed forces, making all these weapons,\nwhich he developed.",
        "Q: But your life, it didn\u2019t change?",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "Q: Your life, and your f-family\u2019s ri \u2014",
        "A: No, not at that time, no. We were still playing soccer like everybody else\n[indecipherable] didn\u2019t play any role, no. It really started much later, when he came\ninto Prague, which was in March ninethir \u2014 1939. Well \u2014",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about that.",
        "A: \u2014 Czechoslovakia ceased to exist.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And they no \u2014 they named it the protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia. Had\nsomething like a \u2014 what we call the governor, or something. And the Czechs were\nrepresented by a figurehead. Then the list started to change, yes.",
        "Q: Tell \u2014 tell us how.May 4, 2013",
        "A: Anti-Semitism to a certain extent, because they were always connected, the\nJewish were looked at \u2014 German speaking people, rather than Czech speaking\npeople. The names were German. So it started to deteriorate. To what extent? Not\nthat much, but then started the transportations.",
        "Q: Well, how did \u2014 my question is much more personal than that. It is, when did\nyour life, your father\u2019s life, your mother\u2019s life, how did things happen in the family?\nHitler marches in, and by what point \u2014",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s changed primarily because young Czech pe \u2014 young Jewish people, th\n\u2014 we were forced to go on certain labor. We were single men, that\u2019s why we\nmarried. The single Jewish people, they were \u2014 well, they were taught to meet\nsomewhere, and that\u2019s was something what I always call like Madison Square\nGarden. We don\u2019t have Madison Square Garden in Prague \u2014",
        "Q: What was the square\u2019? Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 but something like Madison Square Garden.",
        "Q: What was the place?",
        "A: We had to \u2014 we had to report, and we had to do certain work for the Germans.",
        "Q: Tell me \u2014 excuse me, though, do you remember the place you had to report to in\nPrague?May 4, 2013",
        "A: Well, it was \u2014 no, I don\u2019t remember the name, but I have to tell you, before that\nstarted, when they marched in, March \u00b039.",
        "Q: Correct.",
        "A: I was 18, I was working for a Jewish firm. The Jewish management was thrown\nout, and a German administrator was sent in. I was still working when he came in, in\nhis black uniform, and a red \u2014",
        "Q: Armband.",
        "A: \u2014 swastika. And we were \u2014 the location was just across from the Gestapo\nheadquarter.",
        "Q: Oh, I think I \u2014",
        "A: But they didn\u2019t, you know, you didn\u2019t do anything, so they didn\u2019t bother you, but\nyou s \u2014 you saw the changes which gradually occurred. At home I don\u2019t think I have\nseen so many changes. Maybe I didn\u2019t pay attention to it. I was a young man, they\nstill u\u2014 before Hitler came, you know, we still went to dance. And there was a\nresentment, but there was still freedom enough to go and enjoy \u2014 don\u2019t forget, I was\nwhat, 18 years. So what did 18 years do here? The same thing they do over there.\nWe went to dance. I remember the place where we used to go. It was called coffee\nshop, but not the type of a coffee shop what we call here a coffee shop. It was muchMay 4, 2013\nmore elaborate, it was more like a, I would say really full blown restaurant with a\ndancing \u2014",
        "Q: Place.",
        "A: \u2014 room \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 spot where you could dance, and the young people were dancing, we were\ndancing. But that gradually has changed, because \u2014",
        "Q: Did your father lose his job?",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "Q: Did your father lose his job?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think he lost the job at that point. I think he retired, he was forced to\nretire. So he was home, my mother was always home. I don\u2019t know how they were\nmaking a living, I was \u2014 but I remember the first salary which I got when I was\nworking for that Jewish firm, naturally my obligation was to bring it home. That was\nunderstood. It was never thought by me tha \u2014 or by the parents, that somehow I\nwould take it and spend it somewhere. We were \u2014 that was ex \u2014 you know, that was\nanticipated and expected from you. Life was very different in those days. But it has\nchanged, you know. I lost that job because ultimately he found out that I was Jewish,May 4, 2013\nor whatever, and it was [indecipherable] how could I have worked with somebody\nwith a swastika, and all this stuff. Soon it became \u2014",
        "Q: What was his manner, though? Excuse me \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it became worse.",
        "Q: Okay. The manner of that person who ended up taking over the firm, with the\nswast \u2014 did he \u2014 was his manner arrogant, was he \u2014",
        "A: No, no \u2014 well, that was his mentality. But you know, th-the \u2014 the life has\nchanged, what has changed? The laws have changed. So th \u2014 we were playing that\nsoccer. Everybody realize there was no restriction, no nothing. But gradually the\nnon-Jewish population was put on such pressure, not to socialize with Jews \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 that all of a sudden your friends, were afraid to be your friends. So, the\nrelationship has ceased. Everything became a separate society. The Jewish people\nwere \u2014 we had to wear Jewish stars, we had to be home at eight o\u2019clock. So there\nwere certain restrictions which were put on the Jewish population, which became,\nyou know, like what they call here [indecipherable] it didn\u2019t happen overnight, but\nit was, you know. The first thing, for example, that I remember, as a kid I used to\nplay the violin. Well, don\u2019t ask me what day, what year, but all of a sudden we were\nsupposed to submit all those musical instruments to a certain place. Well, but it\u2019s notMay 4, 2013\nthat I didn\u2019t agree, you \u2014 you were afraid not to agree. So you did what you were\ndoing, because the Catholic population, they could not help you, because they were\nafraid themselves. So, the \u2014 the \u2014 the hostilities, or the violence, increased. So that\nthere was a distinct difference between the Jewish population, and the non-Jewish\npopulation. And the very first transport, as I remember, a cousin of mine, he was\nmuch older than I was, but that\u2019s not the issue, the only reason I\u2019m saying it,\nbecause with his wife, somehow they had no children. She \u2014 she lost a child and she\ncouldn\u2019t have more children, or whatever, they were one of the first ones to be\ndeported to a Polish ghetto which was called L\u00e9dz, l-o-d-z, is a town in Poland.\nThey survived there until a certain time, when that was also liquidated, and he\nwound up in Auschwitz. Lost his leg in Auschwitz and everything else, but they\ncame back after the war, and \u2014 because so few people survived, I was reasonably\nclose to them at one point, you know. Remember, the age was different, he was born\n1900, and I was born 1921, so it\u2019s 20 years different. So when we came back, I was\nonly 22, 24, he was already close to 50.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So there was a different. But eventually they also left for Austria. Austria was\nvery helpful.May 4, 2013",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s go back then, to life gradually changing, and there\u2019s this separation\nbetween the Jews and the non-Jews, and a marginalization, from what I\u2019m seeing,\nyou\u2019re put on the margins of society, where you\u2019re not \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 allowed to do things that you were allowed to do before. When did \u2014 let me go\nback even before that. Did you know Georgine by that time?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How did you meet Georgine?",
        "A: Well, we were kids, we were dancing the same group of people.",
        "Q: So you were friends from chil \u2014 from childhood?",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "Q: You were friends from childhood?",
        "A: Well, not from childhood, but when she was maybe 14 - 15, and I was four years\nolder, you know. Now, what the Jewish people did, or at least our group did, there\nwas somebody who \u2014 the father had the wholesale business, and the wholesale\nbusiness was in a building which he owned, in the old section of Prague, not far\nfrom where I was growing up. And they used to go to that house to dance. But\nremember, in those days we talk about zillion years back.",
        "Q: Not a zillion.\nMay 4, 2013",
        "A: Yeah, you had a gramophone, if you remember, and that had to be hooked up,\nand you put the disk on it, and that\u2019s the music we used to have.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: If you remember \u201cPennies from Heaven.\u201d",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, that was a \u2014",
        "Q: That was one song \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 thing which was in, you know, insp \u2014 but also, at that time, why did it change?\nBecause also Jewish people who spoke German, very little Czech \u2014 Czech nationals,\nbut they were living in those border countries. So when those border countries had\nto be given back to Germany, because sh \u2014 they came back. So, naturally they were\nJewish, and we were Jewish, so somehow there were more of these girls, who came\nback from these countries, so we were, all of a sudden, instead of six people, we\nwere say 12 people or 14 people. And we used to go to dance \u2014 I don\u2019t remember its\nname, but that\u2019s not important. We went to that house, and in those days you had \u2014 I\nthink Georgine had it, was an electric gramophone, so you didn\u2019t have to crank it up",
        "Q: Crank it up.\nMay 4, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 you had to plug it in, and that was the music we used to dance to. But that\u2019s \u2014\ngradually it changed. It was very difficult, 1t was dangerous to go and be found out\nthat you do these things, which were \u2014",
        "Q: Normal things.",
        "A: \u2014 normal things, but they not normal under those conditions. So it has changed,\nyou know, so you know, the deportations started. The deportations didn\u2019t start in\nAuschwitz, it started in that first ghetto, which they said will be a model ghetto.",
        "Q: What was it called?",
        "A: Theresienstadt. Terezin, in Czech. Now Terezin was of \u2014",
        "Q: Excuse me, before that, when did the deport \u2014 how did people find out that\nthey\u2019re going to be deported? There\u2019s still a gap between when life stops being\nnormal \u2014",
        "A: Well, for example, her fa \u2014 parents, because they were [indecipherable] they had\na house. So number one they had to move out of their house, their house was given\nto some German family, a \u2014 a lieutenant or whatever he was, you know. So it started\ngradually, you know, it was not that there were mass transportation, or deportations,\nno. But a limited amount of people were sent to Terezin.",
        "Q: I want to \u2014 excuse me \u2014 interrupt and finish one thought \u2014",
        "A: Okay.May 4, 2013",
        "Q: \u2014 before, which was, you and Georgine are in the same group of friends, and you\nwere dancing. How did your relationship develop? How did it develop that you had",
        "A: Well, that \u2014 I don\u2019t think I remember how it developed, you know. It was the\nsame group of people that used to go to dance. Now how \u2014",
        "Q: Yes, but fr \u20141-\u2014 but at one point you\u2019re dancing, and then you\u2019re married. What\nhappened?",
        "A: Well, no, no, it was \u2014 well, no. Used to go to dance, like I said.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The marriage didn\u2019t happen that way.",
        "Q: How did it happen?",
        "A: The marriage happened because all of a sudden the edict came \u2014 don\u2019t hold me to\nthe numbers.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Five hundred men, 5,000 men, we had to report to be deported \u2014 when you were\nsingle. So everybody who had a girlfriend got married. We didn\u2019t get married\nbecause we thought we would have children in the United States. We got married\nbecause we \u2014 once you were married, you postponed the deportation. Now, under\nthose circumstances which existed at that time, everything in your life at the time,May 4, 2013\nwas to delay the deportation, because you knew where you were, but you did not\nknow what will come once you go. So you did anything to delay the deportation. So\nif you \u2014 1f you look at the calendar, you will remember that in 1941, when we got\nmarried, Pearl Harbor happened.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: So we thought, oh my gosh, now the United States will go to war with the \u2014 it\nwill be over before we go.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So everything was done to delay that thing. Now, since you were married all of a\nsudden, whether it was this girlfriend, or this \u2014 or vice versa, from the girl\u2019s point of\nview, we got married. Now, of course, the circumstances were very, very different\nalready. Number one, we had to wear a Jewish star. Transportation, there was hardly\nany in place. Now the streetcars, which we had at that \u2014 remember, we talk about\n1939 - 1940, so different now, no doubt. But at the time we had streetcars. And the\nstreetcars, the entrance was in the middle. So there was a front part, and a rear part.\nSo the Jewish people had naturally to be in the rear part.",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: So when we got married, well, we had to go to the rear part, to \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nwhere we went. No, I know where we went. Her sister [indecipherable] you know,\nMay 4, 2013\nthe life in Prague at that time, there \u2014 there was no different between I told you,\nJews, non-Jews, people got married. So her sister got married to a Czech person, not\nJewish person. And they were living in a certain place, I can\u2019t remember the street\nany more, but I remember where it was.",
        "Q: What\u2019s the neighborhood?",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "Q: What was the neighborhood?",
        "A: It was called Libe, I-i-b-e and on the end was like a little \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 something, like that. And sh \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it was her house, or an\napartment, I don\u2019t remember that, but I know it was supposed to \u2014 that\u2019s where we\nhad our quote, wedding celebration, if you want to call it. But all this was in a very,\nvery limited way.",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: Because the circumstances were not to allow you to do something\nostentiously(ph) or something \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014no. But we got married in October 1941, and like I just told you, because so\nmany young men were supposed to report \u2014 let\u2019s call it to Madison Square GardenMay 4, 2013\nfor work. Now once you were married, you still reported, but you were not deported.\nNow the deportation were already taking place. Now, if I may inject something \u2014",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: \u2014 what I was doing when I quote lost my accounting job? You had to work. If\nyou didn\u2019t work, you didn\u2019t get your stamps, which you needed to buy food, so we\nhad to work. So naturally you had no choice what you would like to do for work.\nYou were told what to do. Now, you have to realize that some of these Jewish\npeople, including her father, mother, when they were deported, they left behind this,\nlet\u2019s say. So that had to be emptied, because the landlord wanted to rent it. so he\ncouldn\u2019t rent it when all the stuff was there. So I was assigned to a unit which was\nemptying out sewing machines. [horn sound] My ear?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Oh, this were \u2014",
        "Q: It\u2019s a car outside.",
        "A: The \u2014 the sewing machines in those days were heavy clunkers. I don\u2019t know if\nyou remember that, they were, you know, big stuff. Iron. Not like now plastic, and\nyou put it on the table",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nMay 4, 2013",
        "A: So mirrors, pictures and sewing machines were a \u2014 were taken out of those\napartment and they were stored in a large synagogue in a suburb of Prague. I was in\nthat unit which was doing this \u2014",
        "Q: Work.",
        "A: \u2014 work. Now, since we had pictures from the Jewish family \u2014 at that time, if you\nremember, maybe you don\u2019t remember, because your age, west Europe was already\nunder the attack by British, maybe American planes. So some of these planes hit\nGerman households. So the German government gave these burned-out families,\nsomething what we have here, what we call food stamps. Now, they were not having\nfood stamps, but they had stamps to buy certain things, to reestablish them in\nPrague, or wherever they were living. Now, let\u2019s shall \u2014 talk about Prague, because\nthat\u2019s where I was active. So when they came, and they had these stamps, coupons,\nor whatever it was, that they could buy two paintings. Now, naturally they didn\u2019t\npay for it, they gave you that stamps in return. But there was no gallery, like here in\na gallery, you know, you \u2014 that was a pile of paintings, that it was segregated\nbetween certain items of paintings; animals, or flowers, or whatever. They \u2014 in\nGerman they call it stil leben.",
        "Q: Stil leben, yeah.May 4, 2013",
        "A: So, I remember that when these people came in, they wanted to have a stil leben\nfor their dining room, so I had to hold it, because they wanted to look at it. So when\nI was holding it, you know, that\u2019s how you hold stil \u2014 why do I mention it? So when\nwe got married, in October 1941, and I was still working for that Jewish\norganization, assembling the sewing machine, pictures, and all that stuff. So when\nwe had to report to, quote, Madison Square Garden, there was naturally an SS guy\nwho directed the \u2014 the people, the traffic where you had to check in, where you had\nto go. Somehow he remembered that he was buying \u2014 buying a painting that \u2014 which\nI was holding. So, h-he called me out from the deportation, and he said, you stay\nhere. So naturally then \u2014 remember, I spoke perfectly German, I had German\nschools, and then you \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 improve it, because everything was German. So I was telling him that I have\nalso a wife here. So somehow we found where Georgine was, and the delay, again,\neverything was always delay, delay, delay.",
        "Q: What about your parents? Were they \u2014",
        "A: My parents, they sta \u2014 that was a difference, I \u2014",
        "Q: We\u2019ll come to that.May 4, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 Tl tell you. So, we were delayed, not by a long time, no, but it was a delay.\nWeek, or something, whatever. You talk about my parents. My sister worked for the\nJewish government, the government which was connected to the German\ngovernment. Don\u2019t forget, the Germans didn\u2019t do any orders, they gave the orders to\nthe Jewish government. So there was a Jewish police, there was a Jewish this \u2014\neverything \u2014 not everything, of course, but within certain \u2014 so my sister was working\nfor that Jewish organization, call it the Jewish government. And that was primarily\nbecause, if you remember I told you, that person who came into our house where we\nwere living. So he knew my mother, he knew my sister \u2014",
        "Q: This Edelstein(ph)?",
        "A: Edelstein(ph). So he was delaying their deportation. So they stayed\n[indecipherable] in Prague much longer than I and Georgine, or her parents.",
        "Q: Got it.",
        "A: How long [indecipherable] how long, but you know, eventually they also came\nto Theresienstadt, just like my sister. But sh \u2014 my sister, from the job in Prague,\nshe had the same job in Theresienstadt, because \u2014",
        "Q: What was that job?",
        "A: \u2014 she was working for the Jewish government.",
        "Q: What was the job?May 4, 2013",
        "A: The office.",
        "Q: Office work.",
        "A: You know, don\u2019t forget they had \u2014 they had statistics, they knew how many\npeople they killed. I tell you they knew exactly how they killed. They had system,\nand if you read back, you know, the papers what I have here \u2014 I will have to look for\nit to show it to you, tru \u2014 they knew my transportation number when I was, well,\nwith Georgine, when we left Prague for Theresienstadt, the \u2014 the transport had a\nname, the transport had a number. We had a number. I don\u2019t remember the number,\nof course, but I have papers here to show you. So, my parents were actually deported\nlater.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They \u2014 they perished, of course, just like everybody perished. But they \u2014 later th\n\u2014 they lived a little longer, let\u2019s say, before they got into Auschwitz, and Auschwitz\nwas, of course, the end of it. Because you, when you were in Auschwitz, and you\ncame with a train, and in front of you stood that doctor, whatever his name was. And\nhe decided as you go this way, or that way. Natch \u2014 now, you have to realize, I like\nto tell you, we know now when we say the word Auschwitz, we know what it 1s.\nBut you have to go back to 1941, when we got married, \u201942. So when we were living\nin Theresienstadt, our clothes \u2014 they didn\u2019t have any prisoner clothes \u2014 it was\nMay 4, 2013\nhorrible. But it was a paradise compared to what happened. Why do I say it?\nBecause, you know Theresienstadt is an old town, named after Queen\nTheresienstadt, or whatever she was [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Theresa, mm-hm.",
        "A: And naturally, those were barracks for the Czech armed forces. Now there wasn\u2019t\nthat much space, nor that many beds or anything. So they constructed bunks, three\non top of each other. So that was a terrible shortage of space. When you went to the\nbathroom, you had to have your container for soap, you went there, you know. It\nwas not a bathroom in a sense, like you go here. So, it was very difficult. The\ncrowds. You had to wait in line to get your food, you know. So when you come\nfrom a normal atmosphere like here \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean my house per se \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 and then all of a sudden you have a regimented life, you have to be there seven\no\u2019clock, or nine o\u2019clock, or whatever. And then you slept three on top of each other,\nwhich one are you going to go? On top, in the middle, or down below? So there\nwere arguments among people, Jewish people, but don\u2019t forget, they were not only\nJewish people there \u2014",
        "Q: Of course.\nContact reference@ushmn.org for further information about this collectionMay 4, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 there are also Jewish people from some other places, because it was supposed\nto be a model ghetto, and hit \u2014 and Hitler was running the border over. So it became\nextremely crowded. Now, in that Theresienstadt, the first x months, I can\u2019t tell you\nhow many months, but I was assigned to distribute coal, because I was working in\nthe coal firm, so I was assigned to a coal job. What was the job? Well, all these\npeople who were living in these places, they were assigned boxes, with the two\nhandles here, two handles over there, and that you had to fill this \u2014 this up with coal,\nand they took it in wherever they were staying. The houses were condr \u2014 houses \u2014\nth-they were n-not houses like \u2014",
        "Q: Barracks.",
        "A: \u2014 you know, when \u2014 shacks. But that was converted so that some people could\nhave \u2014 like there is mostly men, or mostly women, and they needed heat, so they\nwere getting the coal. So, at one point, the \u2014 you know, when \u2014 when the coal\nnormally was sold, or delivered, there used to be a little hut with a scale outside. So,\nbecause of my coal co-connections, I was given the use of that thing. So Georgine\nmoved back in with me, in that \u2014",
        "Q: Hut.",
        "A: \u2014 hut, they call it. In the \u2014 in the public [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So you ha \u2014 so you had your own private place in the hut.May 4, 2013",
        "A: [had my private scale. But like I say, it was awful, but 1t was wonderful to what\nhas happened. So, in September \u2014",
        "Q: Hang on. Before we get there \u2014",
        "A: Sure, sure.",

        "A: Couple days more.",
        "Q: Ah, it was a couple of days.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t like a month, or two months, or na \u2014 something like that?",
        "A: Oh no, no, a coup \u2014 couple days. I had to rej \u2014 re \u2014",
        "Q: You had to \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 reappear, whatever you want to call it, yeah.",
        "Q: Oh, I see. And so no \u2014",
        "A: And then we went, naturally.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: To \u2014 to Theresienstadt.May 4, 2013",
        "Q: I understand, but here\u2019s \u2014 can you \u2014 you don\u2019t remember that \u2014 that gathering\nplace that you call Madison Square Garden? Do you remember the name of where\nyou were told to go?",
        "A: No. I would lie if I tell you I remember, no, no. [indecipherable] Velitic(ph) was\nlike a \u2014",
        "Q: What was Velatrishnik(ph) what \u2014",
        "A: Velitic(ph) means like a \u2014 like a huge \u2014 we have something in New York City,\nJavits \u2014",
        "Q: Center.",
        "A: Something like that \u2014",
        "Q: A convention center.",
        "A: \u2014 you know, it was, of course much smaller, everything was smaller than here.",
        "Q: But it was called Velitrish(ph)?",
        "A: Velitic(ph). Velitic(ph) is a name like it was \u2014",
        "Q: I know. Is it \u2014 it\u2019s a place, however?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: All right. And it was \u2014 was it near the train station, was it near \u2014 was it \u2014",
        "A: I would not know.",
        "Q: You would not know, okay.May 4, 2013",
        "A: I would not know.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: But from there, I di \u2014 must have been some across the train station, because \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: \u2014 we were deported by train.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Now, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t remember where it was, you know, certain things\ndisappear from your memory, you know.",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay. That\u2019s okay.",
        "A: Don\u2019t forget that what you\u2019re talking about, happened 70-odd years ago.",
        "Q: I know. I know. I know. It\u2019s amazing what you\u2019re able to tell us from that time.",
        "A: Oh, I remember these things like if 1t happened yesterday, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Certain things.",
        "Q: Certain things.",
        "A: And certain things you don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: So, here\u2019s another question before we go back to Theresienstadt. Life changed\nafter Hitler marched in.",
        "A: Yes.May 4, 2013",
        "Q: And that was in March 1939.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: And then the war starts September \u00b039.",
        "A: That was because Hitler didn\u2019t keep his word that the Czech territory was his last\nterritorial \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 demand. He had a demand on Poland.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: And he marched into Poland on September 1\u201c \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: \u2014 1939.",
        "Q: My question: did life change even more when there was an actual war?",
        "A: Yeah, of course, of course, of course.",
        "Q: How?",
        "A: Well, ha \u2014 again, we had to be home by eight o\u2019clock, you couldn\u2019t do out, you\ncouldn\u2019t do this. There were restrictions.",
        "Q: So was like a \u2014 okay.",
        "A: Musical instruments we had to give up. The star, and you know, that all\nhappened.May 4, 2013",
        "Q: But, is that because of the war, or is that \u2014",
        "A: That \u2014 that happened between them marching in. When they marched in, nothing\nhappened. You were living like you were living before.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But s-slice.",
        "Q: Slice, okay.",
        "A: Slice this, you know, then that \u2014 that they \u2014 look, we used to go to play cards\nwith that friend of mine, who was, of course, Catholic. He was my \u2014 playing soccer,\nI was the right wing, he was playing next to me, whatever we used to call it. So we\nwere friends. So we used to go to \u2014 they were living very close to where I was\nliving, when we talk about park.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So, in the evening, whatever during the day, he was working, I was working. So\nduring the evening, we went to see, in his home, such an old house, I remember like\ntoday. And we were playing cards, you know, killing the evening. There was no\ntelevision, of course, you know, in those days. So we played cards. The mother\ndivorced \u2014 his mother. And me \u2014 and wa \u2014 she was dating somebody who was\nGerman. But he was very \u2014 you know, not every German was a Nazi at that point.",
        "Q: Of course, of course.May 4, 2013",
        "A: But, they deteriorated. Then it came that we could not stay longer than eight\no\u2019clock, we had to be home. So we had to go from his house to my house, to go\nhome, because you didn\u2019t like to take a chance if somebody would catch you on the\nstreet. So it gradually became worse and worse and worse, you know? And then, all\nof a sudden, you couldn\u2019t see him any more, because he was afraid if he was \u2014 if\nsomebody will see him with a Jew \u2014",
        "Q: He gets into trouble.",
        "A: \u2014 that he will have a problem.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But talking about the German language and all that, Auschwitz, you know, when\nI was comparing it to that here, 9/11, when we had that World Trade Center\ncoming down, I know where I was, I\u2019m sure you know where you were.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I saw the first plane hitting the thing. Well, at that time my assumption was\nthat the guy lost his bearing, or something happened to the plane, and he hit the\nbuilding. So the same was with Auschwitz, you know, when you \u2014 when you don\u2019t\nknow, and you are confronted with these unknown things, what happened? So,\ncoming back to Theresienstadt, they got there in March \u201943. And from March \u00b043\nto September \u00b044, everything was Theresienstadt, okay?May 4, 2013",
        "Q: Ah, so you actually were in Prague until March \u00b043?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Living under \u2014 okay?",
        "A: My name, prag \u2014 Pekarek.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I was working for the Jewish government, removing \u2014",
        "Q: Stuff from the houses.",
        "A: \u2014 but it didn\u2019t happen right away, I was still working under the German guy.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And then, when I lost that job, if you want to call it, then \u2014 then they assigned me\nto this thing, and then I was assembling the sewing machines, paintings, mirrors.",
        "Q: Things like that.",
        "A: And then, in f \u2014 March \u201943, well, we had to go.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay, so in Theresienstadt, you\u2019re there from March four \u2014",
        "A: Nine \u2014 March \u00b043 \u2014",
        "Q: Forty-three.",
        "A: \u2014 to September \u201944. What happened September \u00b044? September 28 is a Czech\nholiday. So we were told that we have to build a new camp, always the new camp. I\nMay 4, 2013\ndon\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t \u2014 what I don\u2019t know, I'll tell you. I don\u2019t remember if it was 500, or\n5,000 \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 or anything in between, men. So, we were assembled, and we had to \u2014 we had\nto go to these open boxcars, which were full of coal that had to be taken out, the\ncoal, and we had to go in. Then they took off March \u2014 September 28, eastward.\nNow, we knew that the American allied soldiers were coming westward, but they\ndidn\u2019t get far enough for us to get out, whatever. So when the train was full of\npeople, open boxcars, well, you know what people do, you know. People have to go\nto the bathroom, there is no food. I have to interject here something, because my\nfriend out on Long Island, he always says, well, what about food? And I always tell\nhim, Fernando, there were no dining cars, you know. But there\u2019s something else. So\nafter we were traveling east \u2014 northeast, there was somebody, as I remember it like\ntoday, in a stripe \u2014 remember, Theresienstadt, we had our clothes. So that was also,\nyou know, where you put it, and all that stuff. So there was always a shortage of\nspace, and you intermingled stuff, and it wa \u2014 it was really a source of trouble. But\nwhen we were traveling east, there was a guy in str-striped uniform. And we get out\nof those boxcars, where are you from? Because we wanted to know what camp is heMay 4, 2013\nfrom. And he said Auschwitz. Now that didn\u2019t \u2014 that\u2019s like if you would say\nsomething.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Didn\u2019t mean a thing. Well, we continued traveling for I don\u2019t know how many\ndays. And finally we got in to something which we \u2014 was called Auschwitz. But\nyou know, again, the Germans, what they did, they tried to intimidate you right from\nthe first moment you entered this whole area. The train didn\u2019t s-stop, yes, but not\nthat everybody had to get out of the train. It took, I think, two days before they\nfinally set everybody out of those boxcars, and get out. And the train was going\naround, around, and you had no idea, because there were no signs. You didn\u2019t know\nhow \u2014 where \u2014 how come that we go around. Nobody was there to tell you anything,\nof course. So finally when we came to a stop, which was like, I would say, the\ncouple of days after, October first, second, I don\u2019t know for sure. Well, we to get\nout, you know, orders in German. And my \u2014 we were together, her father, the two\nuncles, the two doctors, and also some other relatives from her mother\u2019s side.",
        "Q: Were you toge \u2014 was Georgine with you?",
        "A: No, no, no, no.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Her father-in-law. Was only men.May 4, 2013",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So, well, we had to get out, and then you were confronted by that top German\nguy who was \u2014 welcoming you, whatever. And he \u2014 my father-in-law, he was saying\nthat he\u2019s a \u2014 he was not old, but in his mind, he was old. He was only 50 years, fif \u2014\nexactly 50 years, but you know, he lost his house, he lost his business, and\neverything else. So he felt he\u2019s old. So he was telling him in German that he\u2019s an old\nman. So he had to go this way. Well, the two brothers, the doctors, me and someone,\nthis way. Well, once you are split, you try to find out what happened to the people\nwho are the other way.",
        "Q: The other place.",
        "A: Well, they to \u2014 they told you here is gas chambers, crematoriums, and the only\nway out of here is through the chimney, you know. So, if you find out what\nhappened to him, and well, then we were in Auschwitz. First the shoes had to be\ndisinfected, so they put it into water. Well, this was intimidation, you know? So now\nyou had shoes wet, icy cold. Auschwitz is in a very cold area of southern Poland,\nstanding in those freezing temperatures, wet shoes, no coats, no nothing. They give\nyou pants, but those pants are like, you know, his pants were, if he \u2014 I don\u2019t mean\nyour pants what you have on, but me that would be obviously, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah.May 4, 2013",
        "A: But then you were assigned to a barrack. Those were stables for the Polish armed\nforces horses. Don\u2019t forget the time is still horses. So, if you had to have equipment,\nhorses had to pull it, not a car. Gasoline was very difficult. So the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the\nstables they had, seven floors, of course. And they were contructions(ph) for the\nhorses, but contructions(ph). The size was just about like the table. Not high, I\ndon\u2019t mean that, the s \u2014 the size. And that was on the floor, and the edges were a\nlittle higher. So think of it as on the floor, but the end was a little higher.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Why was the end higher? Because the people had to put o-oats into that\ncontraption, so the oats were not all over.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Then the horses ate the oats, or whatever else they were eating. Now for us, the\nheight was good because we put our head on it. There were no beds, like at\nTheresienstadt we had bed \u2014 we had beds, we had bunks, but that was still \u2014",
        "Q: It\u2019s still a space, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 regular \u2014 you know. So that was \u2014 th-that stuff on the floor, cold as 1t was, you\nknow. It was awful, awful. So one of \u2014",
        "Q: When did you find out \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the uncles \u2014May 4, 2013",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 of Georgine, doctor.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: He said, we don\u2019t stay here. Well, that\u2019s easier said than done.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Naturally. So he was \u2014 he came up with this story that if they do nothing, they\nwill not survive, because the cold weather, the food, no food, nothing. So he said\nthat the best will be for us to say that we are locksmiths. And I always say that\u2019s the\nonly lie I lied in my life, because I said I\u2019m a locksmith. So we s \u2014 but he figured\nthat if we say we would be locksmiths, that they would send us into some kind of a\nfactory, and it would be inside, rather than somewhere outside, digging roads, or\nsomething.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Well, he was right. They were always \u2014 they were always counting how many are\nalive, and all that stuff, in Auschwitz.",
        "Q: When did \u2014 where \u2014 again, I'll go back a little bit. In Theresienstadt, what was\nthe mortality like? Were there a lot of people who \u2014",
        "A: Ire \u2014 don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: I mean, did you see people dying \u2014May 4, 2013",
        "A: Of \u2014 of course, old people, we used, of course [indecipherable]. Of course, the\nold people were dying, but they were buried.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Sure. And I think they started with Auschwitz from Theresienstadt, because I\nthink really the Germans were concerned that maybe some disease, or some uprising\nmight happen, you know, over the multitude of people, you know, and now, of\ncourse, they had th \u2014 they had the weapons, we had nothing, of course.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But they would have to shoot.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: All that blood, and all that mess which would probably happen. So they started\nwith the deportation out of Theresienstadt, you know? I think that was the main\nreason, apart from getting rid of the Jewish population.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t know where Georgine was?",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "Q: At \u2014 at that time, you didn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: \u2014 you didn\u2019t know where Georgine \u2014May 4, 2013",
        "A: We left Georgine and her mother behind. They followed, because that \u2014 the\nexcuse was, you want to follow your husbands, your brothers, you can go tomorrow.\nSo three days later, she went with her mother, the same way. Of course, she never\nsaw her mother again, because again, the age, you know. But Georgine was shipped\nto a Russian camp from Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Where was she shipped?",
        "A: She was called \u2014 it was called Gross-Rosen.",
        "Q: Ah, to Gross-Rosen, okay, mm-hm.",
        "A: That\u2019s where she stayed until the end of the war. But she was always sick, you\nknow, women are very different, in case you don\u2019t know. The women body is a very\ndifferent body than a man\u2019s body, so she \u2014 she came back, she was sick from day\none. Of course, she came back to Prague, where I was, you know, first thing\nhospital. She had to be put back into a normal stage, which she wasn\u2019t.",
        "Q: So \u2014",
        "A: But Auschwitz, you know, then we were locksmiths.",
        "Q: Yeah, locksmiths.",
        "A: You remember, my name was Pekarek?",
        "Q: Yeah.May 4, 2013",
        "A: So, at one time, we had to, again, assemble to go \u2014 there was no travel agent, you\nknow, they told you have to get out of the thing, and you were standing there, then\nthey told you will be transported someplace, so the tr \u2014 they call the names. Now,\nlots of people changed their names, not legally. Why? Because they were afraid in\ncase they would be punished or beaten up, or whatever. They might have\nramification to the family somewhere else.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, lots of young men changed the name from A to B, or B to C. I didn\u2019t change\nmine, I was still Pekarek. And \u2014 but the \u2014 the transportation, the first transportation\nstopped at K, and because I was Pekarek, they were F, Feldmans \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 they left, and I stayed behind. Because there were only so many empty on the\ntrain \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 to go wherever. So, we met only after the war with those people again. They\nsurvived, and I survived, as a locksmith, but not in the same place. Reasonably, you\nwould say like I was in Muncie, and they were in Poborno(ph), or something like\nthat.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.May 4, 2013",
        "A: Of course, you couldn\u2019t travel freely, that was out of question. But I cus \u2014 I\nstayed behind, unfortunately, and because I stayed behind, you always have to do\nsomething what they told you to do. So for maybe about a month, or six weeks or so,\nI had to \u2014 I was assigned to a group which was taking out the dead bodies from the\ngas chambers, which had to be taken to the crematorium. You didn\u2019t like to leave\ndead bodies in the gas chambers, you had to go to the crematorium and burn them.\nAnd then, you know, th-the ashes was nothing. So the \u2014 the transportation took place\non a\u2014I don\u2019t know how you would call it, it had two Vs on each side, and a piece of\nwood was like this, you know? We were not so strong, I can\u2019t tell you how many we\nhad to push always to get to the gas chambers. Take the bodies out, put them on that\nstretcher [indecipherable] and transport them to the crematorium. Well, that went\non for some time, I would say maybe about a couple of \u2014 maybe about a month or\nSO.",
        "Q: Wasn\u2019t it a shock?",
        "A: Well, sweetheart, that was life at that time. Then \u2014 then he finished, and the\ntransportations then again, was through that \u2014 where I was, as a locksmith. If you\nhave a huge map of Germany, you probably found town one in \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.May 4, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 on the map. It was called Meuselwitz. Very close to where Uncle Bert was\nwith his brother, but not in Mosul, it\u2019s a very different place. And you were working\nthere from six to six.",
        "Q: And what did you do there?",
        "A: What I did after that?",
        "Q: No, no, no, in Meuselwitz.",
        "A: What I was doing \u2014 it was a huge machine. We were producing casings for the\nGerman navy. You had a machine you p-put \u2014 remember, I was a locksmith, so you\npressed it, the thing was about this big \u2014 not that \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 you know, maybe bigger, but narrower. And you had a bucket, and that \u2014 you\nhad to fill up the bucket. I can\u2019t tell you how many buckets a day, or whatever, from\nsix to six. Well, then you went back to where you were supposed to be housed, but it\nwas temporary shelter, really. Was no bed. Was just one thing big from there to\nhear, and today you slept here, tomorrow you slept there. Boys or old men only. And\nin the morning you did the same thing. Six to six. And I have to tell you how I got\nout, because really that was what people always say, well, who \u2014 who \u2014 who\nliberated you. And I have to say, I was not liberated in that sense. Remember what IMay 4, 2013\nwas telling you is the truth. The only not truth is locksmith. So, w-we came back,\nwha-whatever the date was. April 7.",
        "Q: You came back to where?",
        "A: To \u2014 where we were sleeping.",
        "Q: Ah, so in Meuselwitz, you\u2019re still \u2014",
        "A: From the factory \u2014",
        "Q: To the place.",
        "A: \u2014 they took us back to where we were sleeping.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But instead of sleeping, we had to empty a tray of briquettes. You know what\nbriquettes are? Briquettes are about this big. So we had to empty that tray from the\nbriquettes. Well, then \u2014 then that [indecipherable] the tables, and they threw the\nbriquettes, they chased us in. So again, you know, you are in a train, like my friend\nalways, what about food, what about food? First of all, we were already dehydrated,\nthe body was stopped, like you sitting here \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 or I\u2019m sitting here. I don\u2019t know how many pounds we had, but food was not\nreally the item which bothered you, so to speak. So then she starts back into theMay 4, 2013\ntrain, and the train took off east, just like from Theresienstadt east, this time from\nMeuselwitz, Germany, east. Away from those upcoming American soldiers.",
        "Q: One point here, I just want to establish. So, if I understand properly, you were in\nAuschwitz for about two months or so?",
        "A: No, I was there longer than that. I got to \u2014 in Auschwitz in September 28, so we\ngot there like, I would say, October first.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And out of Auschwitz, somewhere around Christmastime.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: So I would say about three months.",
        "Q: Three months. Three months.",
        "A: And then from Christmas to the quote, liberation where I\u2019m trying to tell you \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u20141n Meuselwitz.",
        "Q: In Meuselwitz, okay.",
        "A: Now the Meuselwitz didn\u2019t have any accommodation, like I just said \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 it was \u2014 you know why? Because the German people, they were very all \u2014\neither on the east front, or west front, and they needed the manpower, so they were\n74May 4, 2013\ninterested in producing it. Anyway, so when the order came to get inside those\nboxcars east \u2014 but you have to realize, that was not Germany of the 1940s, that was\nGermany of a defeated country. The railroads were ripped up from the bombing of\nthe United States. So the transportation wasn\u2019t like that you hop in here and you\nwind up there, no. It was very difficult. Not for u\u2014 I mean, we were just prisoners,\nand we had to do whatever we were told, but it was not so easy for them either. So\nwe were traveling for two days, eastward. Then we came to a place in Germany, or\nmaybe western Poland, or something. Next to us was a train with German soldiers.\nThey were heading west, we were heading east. It\u2019s like that, okay. I was like this,\nthey were on this side. So my particular boxcar, we were told to get out of the\nboxcar so that they could count how we are still in the boxcar are living, because\nsome people are die out of hydration, age, malnutrition, sickness. So they always\ncounting. So while we were standing alongside our railroad car, next to us was a\nGerman car, right? I mean, the British bombers came by, and they started to dive,\nand started to shoot. Now, you know when you are up there and you starting to\nshoot, you don\u2019t shoot like this, you shoot like this, you know? So that you kill as\nmany opponents you can kill. So there was a panic at that moment. We were out of\nthe car. So, we \u2014 wi \u2014 wi [indecipherable] if you want to call it free. That\u2019s not the\nright word, but no supervision at that moment. So that was a hill, and I always call itMay 4, 2013\nthe same like here. You know, you have a hill behind you, and you had to run up the\nhill, because you wanted to get away from the shooting. So we were \u2014 remember, I\nwas \u2014 1945, I was what, 24 years. So, you had the different stamina to run than you\nwould have now that I\u2019m 91. So we were running up. When I say we, there was\nalways somebody who was closer to you. I remember one guy, his name, but I don\u2019t\nremember the other two who were running, Czechs, with us.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So we got up on top of the hill. Now we were realizing that we didn\u2019t have any\nGerman guard watching us, right? We were free. Free, without any passport, without\nany papers, striped uniform. So free is a different thing for free. And that \u2014 and the\ntrain, which I told you, the British bombers started to bomb. Eventually they hit the\ntrain. So there was a tremendous commotion. But we wound up on the top of the\nhill. So that \u2014 what are we going to do? Are we going to stay here, get organized, or\ngoing back, or whatever. So we decided four of us, cold as it was, that we will stay\novernight, and then we will think what we do the nec \u2014 next day. So we decided one\nday to stay up on the hill, and maybe two nights, I don\u2019t remember for sure any\nmore. But we decided to go back, because we thought, we had no papers, we had\nnothing. Where are we going to go? Not that we had anywhere to go down there, but\nat least we were not fugitives from \u2014May 4, 2013",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 where we were. So we went down the hill, and as we were coming down the\nhill, believe it or not, our train took off. So we \u2014 we really lost the train. The\nprisoners who were still there. We took only about one car, which was where we\nwere. The rest was still inside. So, we left the train \u2014 so we, when we saw the train\nmoving, we ducked a little, to be sure that they don\u2019t start shooting. And they left,\nand we went back to the hill. So we were on that hill [indecipherable] Fernando\nwill buy the food. I said, oh Fernando, there was no food, there was no service,\nthat\u2019s for sure. But anyhow, we went back to the hill, and we stayed there another\ntwo days.",
        "Q: No food, nothing, yeah?",
        "A: Thinking where to go, how to go, what excuse.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, the roads were all occupied by what we have here, National Guard, or\nwhat do we call it here?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.",
        "A: So we knew once we get down, that we will be confronted. The only thing, we\nspoke very well German, and we came up with a story that we will say we were\n77May 4, 2013\nCzech workers on the train, apart from prisoners from Auschwitz. So, we were\ndifferent. We thought we are different from \u2014",
        "Q: Those.",
        "A: \u2014 and that our papers, in that commotion, we lost our stuff which we had, and that\nwould have shown that we are Czech workers. So finally we decided we take a\nchance, we have to do it, because we don\u2019t live indefinitely on top of the hill. So we\nwent down, a short enough distance, like you would say, maybe further down,\nmaybe [indecipherable]. Sure enough, there was a station, this we \u2014 soldiers with \u2014\nthree, four soldiers with guns. So we put our hands up right away, that they don\u2019t\nstart shooting. That\u2019s the approach, then w-we told them exactly what I\u2019m telling\nyou, that we were Czech workers, on work in Germany, in that factory where we\nwere, and that our clothes was damaged in that attack, and that\u2019s what we saved, is\nwhat we have on. Well, you have \u2014 you have to put you into jail, you have to see the\nmagistrate the next day. So we were now in \u2014 in a regular jail. Well, if you have a\nbrain injury \u2014 and I hope not [indecipherable] but it was the first time a regular jail.\nThere was discarded clothes. So, what we did, we took, instead of our prison\nclothes, we took the discarded clothes which was left there by whoever. So when\nthis local magistrate, the next morning, we had ill-fitted clothes, but it was not \u2014",
        "Q: Striped.May 4, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 striped. The story was that we are Czech workers, that we were \u2014 of course, we\nspoke German, that we were caught on the train, which was bombed by the British\nand we got \u2014 you know, we were trying to get somewhere, out of, you know, where\nwe were. Now, the most unexpected thing happen. The magistrate said that, you\nsuffered enough, You are free to go wherever you want to go.",
        "Q: So he didn\u2019t believe your story?",
        "A: Well \u2014 well, he let us go. So we were free. So then, coming back to Prague, how\ndo you get back?",
        "Q: Well, did you then have a paper, or a stamp, or something.",
        "A: No, we had nothing.",
        "Q: So you could have been stopped the next town over?",
        "A: Yes, well, we were not stopped, you know, the situation was like here after 9/11.\nYou know, it was not \u2014 it was not so rigid any more, you know.",
        "Q: It was chaotic.",
        "A: I-It was halted, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Now, I would like to also tell you at this point that the cars which existed, which\nwere allowed to travel, didn\u2019t use gasoline. What they did \u2014 the Germans are very\ninventive. The \u2014 the cars which were allowed to take what I am telling you, they hadMay 4, 2013\nto cut out the passenger seat. The driver, was a driver, but the passenger seat was\ntaken out, and they put in something like you would say, a contraption, with wooden\nchips. And the wooden chips had to be put on fire, and they produce a little bit of\nsteam, and the steam produce the car to go. So when we tried to get to Prague hi \u2014\nnot hijacking, ja \u2014 jack \u2014 how you call it here, when you \u2014",
        "Q: Hitchhiking.",
        "A: \u2014 hitchhi \u2014 hitchhiking. So we tried to get to Prague hitchhiking, because we\nhave, of course, no money, no paper, no nothing, four of us. So, a truck, which was\nsomething I remember like today, like a pickup truck, he stopped. Where do you\nwant to go? Of course we said Prague, and he said he goes to Prague, too, but his\ntruck \u2014 where we were was a very hilly country. So he said, most likely the truck\nwill not make it, you will have to get out, and have to push the thing to get over the",
        "Q: Hill.",
        "A: So we took seven days to get back to Prague, because he had only that thing on\nthe side, producing the \u2014 the s \u2014 the steam. But we got to Prague April 20\", Hitler\u2019s\nbirthday, and they were still celebrating. That\u2019s it.",
        "Q: My God.",
        "A: It\u2019s the truth.May 4, 2013",
        "Q: April 20\".",
        "A: Well, her sister was in the place where we thought we will meet. So since we\ndidn\u2019t eat anything since that in \u2014 you know that in \u2014 that left, April seventh, April\n20, 13 days.",
        "Q: You hadn't eat anything for 13 days?",
        "A: Who should have given me some? So she gave us \u2014 I remember like today, tea.\nWell, I said [indecipherable] something else. And shower, bathroom, because we\nhad lice. If you know what lice does, you know, they crawl all over you. So,\nnaturally she was afraid that we bring the lice into her home. So first was the\nbathroom, you know, staying there because how many hours, to kill the lice. And\nthen a cup of tea. But you couldn\u2019t get out of that house, because we didn\u2019t have any\npapers, so we were afraid if you get \u2014 we \u2014 I was afraid, if you get out, you know,\nthat somebody could stop us. And then what? Don\u2019t forget the hair \u2014 th-the hair, you\nknow. But during the camp, they shore it, so people knew that you are from\nsomewhere else. So we stayed inside until May five. And quote famous Czech\nrevolution started May five. Ended May nine, was horrible. Because people take\nvendettas, you know. Because you did this to my family, I did this to you, you\nknow. Was very, very, very, very bad, very bad.",
        "Q: What did you see, or what did you hear about?May 4, 2013",
        "A: People, you know, people found out where the Germans were hiding, and they\nkilled them, of course. But if they would have killed them with one shot, is one\nthing, but that was not the case, it was awful. Those are the unfortunate results of\nwar, you know? The people who depress people, you know, that comes out. But\nthen, April \u2014 May nine, it stopped. The nation came back to order. There was police,\nreal police, you know. So gradually things get to order, and I \u2014 and I have to again\nsay the French, they were having all kinds of ways to reunite families. Don\u2019t forget,\nyou didn\u2019t know where \u2014",
        "Q: They came to Prague\u2019?",
        "A: \u2014 Georgine, didn\u2019t know where she was, of course not. But they had s \u2014 like we\nhave here \u2014 not here, in New York City \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 stands where you could have both newspapers. So those places, they hung up\nsigns that you\u2019re looking for somebody last seen in this camp, in September, or\nsomething, you know, that he should report to this and this address, and stuff like\nthat. So it took a little while to get it back into order. But those who survived, well,\nthey had some arrangements, you know, like I told you about these two doctors.\nThey all were supposed to meet in her sister\u2019s house, and they did, one at a time.May 4, 2013\nWell, once they came back, you know, then \u2014 then, who survived, who didn\u2019t\nsurvive.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: There\u2019s not much else I can add to it.",
        "Q: There are more questions, but \u2014",
        "A: Somehow \u2014 I don\u2019t know how I got the apartment, whether it was given to me,\nwhether I could occupy it without a lease, or whatever, I don\u2019t remember. I had an\napartment the old section of Prague, new building. No elevator, but it was on the\nsecond floor. I don\u2019t remember whether I \u2014 I don\u2019t know how I maintained it, I\ndidn\u2019t have any money. But eventually I got the job, you know, the one \u2014 the one\nJewish friend, one of them came back. Naturally, demanded his firm to be getting\nback. And eventually I started to work for him.",
        "Q: This is \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s just about it.",
        "Q: Well \u2014",
        "A: Anything else what you want to know, I gladly tell you the dates, the details.",
        "Q: There\u2019s a lot I want to know.",
        "A: Sorry?May 4, 2013",
        "Q: Maybe \u2014 maybe we \u2014 the \u2014 I don\u2019t know what time it is now, let me take a look.\nMaybe we\u2019ll break for lunch, or have a little bit of a break, and then we\u2019! continue\nlater.",
        "A: Well, I have to tell Georgine \u2014 not Georgine, but Tammy(ph) and Elise.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. And then \u2014",
        "A: What time is it?",
        "Q: One o\u2019clock.",

        "A: Let me find out where they are.",
        "Q: Okay. Hang on, let me go, because you still have a mike on you.\nEnd of File OneMay 4, 2013\nBeginning File Two",
        "Q: So, where we left off before was that you had made it back to Prague, after a\nmost unusual kind of way of being liberated.",
        "A: Oh yeah, when I left, yes, yes.",
        "Q: You know?",
        "A: This how it was.",
        "Q: And you were at your sister\u2019s \u2014 your sister\u2019s house, or your cousin\u2019s house who\nhad married someone. Tell me again, whose house did you go to when you came\nback to Prague?",
        "A: Tha-That was my wife\u2019s sister.",
        "Q: Your sister-in-law?",

        "Q: I never knew. I never knew. Okay.\n85May 4, 2013",
        "A: Vlasta(ph) is Patricia in English.",
        "Q: And was her home in the center of Prague?",
        "A: No, she was living in Lieben. I don\u2019t remember the street any more, but so many\nyears since you\u2019re out of there, you know.",
        "Q: Of course. So, was it in a residential neighborhood, or was it a city\nneighborhood?",
        "A: No, that was a residential neighborhood, yes.",
        "Q: A city neighborhood, or \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, it was very nice, and again, you know, when \u2014 when these deportations\nstarted, you always said well, you have to be somewhere, then you come back.\nNobody ever thought that you will not come back.",
        "Q: Come back.",
        "A: So yes, you \u2014 you will come back, and you should have someplace where you\nwill quote, meet.",
        "Q: And Vlasta(ph), was she able to stay there because she was married to a non-\nJew?",
        "A: She was married to a non-Jew, but that actually it was a surprise that she\nsomehow managed not to be involved, because that was not an excuse. She was\nJewish, so under normal circumstances of that time, she would have had the sameMay 4, 2013\ndifficulties. But for some strange reason, nobody knew. The neighbors, of course,\nCzech. She married somebody by the name of Krejcik(ph).",
        "Q: Krejcik(ph).",
        "A: Now Krejeik(ph) is like a small tailor, in English. So the name was, of course,\nCzech, and she was married to him for quite a while. Well, they would have been ol-\nolder than we, but I remember him, and she came here couple of times, we have a\npicture, we have a \u2014 which I mentioned to you, a swimming pool.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",

        "Q: The rim.",
        "A: The \u2014 the layout. But there were quite a few, somehow, survivors. Well, not just\nsurvivors, people who were born here. I told you about this uncle who was living in\n\u2014 in Ecuador \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: \u2014 so that\u2019s 1\u2014 from this side the world. The picture shows quite a few people, you\nknow?",
        "Q: Okay. So, when you\u2019re back and \u2014 and she sees you, could she recognize you\nwhen she saw you?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, yes.\nMay 4, 2013",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Even without the hair. I mean, now I have normally no hair, but at the time it was\nshort cut \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 you know, and \u2014 and the language, you hear the same voice, and yes. So I had\nno problem with that part, no. And specially the bathroom. Now, you know, these\nare human, so when you go to the bathroom, you know what happen. You have to\nclean yourself, and \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 wash up yourself. There\u2019s something which didn\u2019t exist in Australia \u2014 ah, in\nAustralia, in \u2014 in \u2014 in Auschwitz. There were no bathrooms, you know, there was a\npiece of wood, and you had to sit down and do what you did, and there was no\nwater. So you really \u2014 you personal esteem, or hygiene, or whatever you want to call\nit, was absolutely nonexistent, you know. Just think of it, what she was talking\nabout, that underwear. Well you, when you are in that kind of a cold weather, and\nyou are not properly dressed, your nose is running con-constantly. So, at one time\nthey were, probably as a make you feel miserable, or whatever, out of that prayer\nshawl, they made shorts. So \u2014 which I started to tell you earlier. Somehow, when\nthey were throwing out those shorts, I must have caught two, maybe they were\nMay 4, 2013\nsomehow intertwined. So one I put on, and the other one I tore to pieces, and this\nUncle Fred and Uncle Bert, of course I gave them piece of that material, so they\ncould wipe their nose, just like I could wipe my \u2014 but Uncle Fred, who was living in\nMunnsville, upstate New York, after \u2014",
        "Q: The war.",
        "A: \u2014 the [indecipherable], he always said in his Czech language, I will never forget\nit; if I remember a present, you gave us that piece of cloth to wipe our \u2014 and that was\nhere, not there. He never forgot that. And he was treating John. John went, at that\ntime, to Colgate University, undergraduate school, and we used to get \u2014 get up there\nto visit Uncle Fred, with his wife, and John was there, so \u2014 it was not so far from\nhere, anyhow.",
        "Q: Right, mm-hm.",
        "A: It was far, but not that far that you could not make it, you know, so \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, mm-hm, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 we \u2014 we saw them, occasionally. But all these people were older than we both\nwere, so eventually we are just by ourselves. You know, my age, Georgine\u2019s not\nthat far behind \u2014",
        "Q: Sure.\nMay 4, 2013",

        "Q: Okay, so we were talking about \u2014 we were talking about when you were in\nAuschwitz, and how you gave your uncles your \u2014 that is, Georgine\u2019s husbands a\npiece of \u2014",
        "A: A piece of un-underwear.",

        "A: Nose.",
        "Q: \u2014 their noses. I wanted to go back a little bit further, even before you\u2019re deported,\nbecause from what I understand now, you lived really, several years under Nazi rule\nin Prague.",

        "Q: So during that time, what was \u2014 what was \u2014 did you \u2014 what did you hear about\nRichard Heydrich, who was the leader \u2014 I mean, who was Hitler\u2019s man in Prague?\nWhat did you know of him?",
        "A: Well, of course I remember the name, H-Heydrich, of course. Well, one\nexperience comes right to your mind. When he was killed, and they were looking\naround for those parti-partisans, they used to call them, who they suspected killed\nhim, well, we were living in an apartment \u2014 we were married, of course, and we\nwere living in an apartment which was assigned to us, because the parents had to\nmove out of the house where they were \u2014 lived. And they were assigned to another\nJewish family, which was, as soon as you remember Prague a little bit, near the\nCharles bridge.",
        "Q: Bridge.",
        "A: So we were living in that neighborhood, and I do \u2014 I don\u2019t know what I was\ndoing, but most likely working for the Jewish organization \u2014 I shouldn\u2019t call it that\nway, but that\u2019s the way it was.",
        "Q: Well, it sounds like an authority. Like an authority \u2014",
        "A: Jewish authority would be a better word.",
        "Q: Yeah.May 4, 2013",
        "A: And I remember we were, of course, sleeping, and all of a sudden somebody\nburst into that room \u2014 I don\u2019t know if they were soldiers, or SS soldiers, that I don\u2019t\nremember, but they were moving the furniture, which was not ours, which was, we\nhad the furnished room. They were looking for some hidden escape routes which\nthese partisans might have taken. That was the middle of the night, whether it was\n10 - 12, that I don\u2019t remember, but I remember very well when they came.\nNaturally, we were scared to death in bed, sleeping and all of a sudden somebody is\nthere with weapons, and go \u2014 moving the furniture to see whether it\u2019s a hidden\nstaircase to go somewhere where that person might have been hiding.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But ultimately, of course, they didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t find anything, they left. But it was\nvery difficult. The \u2014 the conditions became worse. I don\u2019t mean living conditions\nlike eating, no. It was more the freedom of moving around, yes. Because you were\nsupposed to have the yellow star, and if they caught you without wearing it, without\nhaving the documents which a non-Jew had to produce, you \u2014 it was punishable.\nAnd the office which I was working at, was just across from the headquarter of the\nGestapo. So we had the \u2014 I have seen many things which normally people would not\nhave seen, you know, that \u2014",
        "Q: Such as?May 4, 2013",
        "A: Well, the trucks with the prisoners, and the mistreating of prisoners getting into\nthe building, and all this stuff. Was awful. That building was originally a bank, and\nit was owned by a Jewish person. The name was called \u2014 like you have here\nCitibank, so that was called the Petschek bank. And he was known, you know, like\nyou know here Rockefeller, so he was known there as Petschek the banker, you\nknow. But what you have seen, yes, e-every 12 o\u2019clock, a new guard came to\nreplace the guard from the day before. So you have seen the power, the might what\nthey had at that time. The streets were \u2014 that particular location was at, that had all\nAmerican presidents there. It was a Hoover Street, it was a Wilson Street, and there\nwere more of them. So why they hurried there, I don\u2019t know, but that was that bank\nwhich they used for the Gestapo, you know.",
        "Q: Was \u2014 was the Gestapo headquarters, now was that parallel to Vlasov\u2019s\nginanisty(ph)?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Then I know the building.",
        "A: Vlasov\u2019s ginanisty(ph), you are absolutely right. Vlasov\u2019s ginanisty(ph), it goes\nthis way \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 and that\u2019s three-four \u2014 the parallel, yes, yes.May 4, 2013",
        "Q: Yeah, then I know the \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019ve passed by the building, yeah.",
        "A: It was parallel.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And that\u2019s \u2014 that section of Prague had all these American presidents\u2019 name,\nprobably just to show gratitude that they made \u2014",
        "Q: Made.",
        "A: \u2014 established the Czech Republic, or Czechoslovakia at that time, you know.\nBut wi \u2014 again, the life was, before the Nazis came, that was \u2014 we had the same\nfreedom like here. There was no religious discrimination of any kind. If you were\nJewish, you went to a Jewish temple, if you were Catholic, you went to a Catholic \u2014",
        "Q: Church.",
        "A: \u2014 church, or wherever you went. That has changed. People became more \u2014 well,\nmaybe afraid. Maybe that some of the true feeling also might have come out, you\nnever know.",
        "Q: Well, going back to Heydrich, when they burst in \u2014 into the room in the middle\nof the night, did you have any idea why? Had you heard that Heydrich had been chMay 4, 2013",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh we \u2014 we knew, oh to sh \u2014 how can you not know?\nHeydrich was \u2014 you know, we had something called I-a-n-y, Lany. Lany was like\nwe have here in the United States, Camp David.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: You see, when the president wants to relax, we \u2014 whichever president, they don\u2019t\ngo into politics, you went to Camp David because that was the summer, or the\nrelaxation for the existing president. So we had that Castle Lany. And Heydrich\nwas known that he travels between Lany and Prague, because he wanted to enjoy\nthe same thing like \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 the president enjoyed that Lany, you know, the castle which was there. But\nsomehow those partisans which were dropped by the British, they found out his\nroute, and eventually, naturally, killed him by \u2014 I don\u2019t exactly remember any more.\nThe car was passing, and somehow exploded, or whatever. But it was big\nrepercussions, yeah, because he was really the right hand of Hitler. So when they\nkilled the right hand of Hitler, you know, they wanted to show \u2014 and you know,\nthey traced it back \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you heard that story, they tri \u2014 they traced it\nback that those partisans were staying, or were dropped off in a town called Lidice.\nAnd out of sympathy, naturally, here in the United States, in Chicago, there is aMay 4, 2013\nsuburb called Lidice. Now, I don\u2019t know if they have changed it since then, or\nwhatever, but there\u2019s a strong Czech community in Chicago, and they wanted to\nshow that somehow the \u2014 the west stands with that particular event. But, of \u2014 of\ncourse I remember it, and there were pictures of Heydrich left and right. He was the\nright hand of Hitler, no doubt about it.",
        "Q: Now in \u2014 now, when they burst in in the middle of the night, that means it wasn\u2019t\nthe same night that heyd \u2014 or the same day that Heydrich had been attempted \u2014",
        "A: No, we had aft \u2014 well, they were looking for the n \u2014 you know \u2014",
        "Q: Right, for days.",
        "A: \u2014 and even if they knew the \u2014 that \u2014 that the people are God knows where, or\nmaybe they were even killed, or whate \u2014 they wanted to show the power they had,\nand to im \u2014 intimidate everybody else.",
        "Q: Were there other reprisals, after they captured those \u2014 because I bel \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember exactly what would have happened afterwards, except that they\ntook all these men, people \u2014 and not only men, boys \u2014 from the town of Lidice, and\nthey burned it down. Females had \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether they took the females, but\nit was awful, awful. And that kind of event warns the rest of the people, you know,\nthey \u2014 they say the non-Jews were afraid to \u2014",
        "Q: Right.\nMay 4, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 you know, talk with Jews, and \u2014 and the fear was spread all over. So it\u2019s not\nlike th-the people were against you. No, I told you, my best friend, he was playing\nsoccer with me. Who cares whether he was Jewish or Catholic, or whatever. But the\nfear was there. So, out of fear, there was a certain \u2014 call it segregation.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: And \u2014 and it was imposed by \u2014 by the system, you know.",
        "Q: Okay, now let\u2019s jump to after the war. When you came back, how did life\ndevelop for you out of your sister-in-law\u2019s apartment? After that, you get better, it\u2019s",
        "A: Well, I told you, somehow \u2014 I don\u2019t know how I got the apartment, because there\nwere also Germans who were thrown awa \u2014 not thrown away, but they made them\ngo back to Germany, or whatever. So I don\u2019t know how I got the apartment.\nCertainly didn\u2019t pay for it, I had no money, I was a kid. Was it allotted to me by\nsomeone? I don\u2019t remember that part. I know I stayed with Georgine until \u2014 and\nthen her aunt, the one they were talking about, the close, she came to visit us when\nshe was expecting George, the one who is a doctor near Washington, D.C. She was\nexpecting him, and that was the first time she came to Prague and the first time they\nmet her, so to speak.",
        "Q: Also, excuse me, we haven\u2019t talked about how did Georgine come back\u2019?May 4, 2013",
        "A: Well, Georgine, I don\u2019t know how she came back, physically, but I think, which\nI mentioned to you, the French were trying desperately to put people together.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Now, if you think who paid for it, definitely nobody. That was the government\u2019s\nsomehow obligation, or whatever. Georgine was sick, and I remember very\ndistinctly, when she came, there were two of her good, best friends who really made\nher survive. Did I remember the name? One was, I think, Ruth but they call her\nChekruthka(ph), and I forgot the second one. But they were not from Prague, so\nthey stayed in Prague for a couple of days before they got the connection to\nwherever they going. One was through Moravia \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 which was the other state of Czechoslovakia. And I think they lost, you know,\nlike always you lost track of each other, because people have different interests, and\nGeorgine, she needed surgeries. She developed a thyroid condition. The thyroid 1s\nnot only that it takes away your breathing, but also she developed a\n[indecipherable] on the \u2014 on this side. That would be her left side, I think it was. So\nshe had to have that taken out. It was not taken out in Czechoslovakia, but she was\ntreated from it. Always the truth, 1t was taken out when we came here, in New York\nCity. Not at the hospital, there used to be small op \u2014 small practices. That was doneMay 4, 2013\non Park Avenue. Don\u2019t hold me to it, but I remember it was on 83\" Street, I think,\nbetween Park and Madison, closer to Park. And it had to be taken out, because the\ndoctor said here that she would \u2014 she would have difficulties. Now, come to think of\nit, why was it not done in Australia? She had it in Australia. But, you know,\nAustralia of 19 \u2014 when we got there, 1949, was a different Australia than 2013.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: They were very backwards. Not because they were dumb or something, it was the\nlocation. They were so far away from anything, that 1-1t \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: \u2014 it was \u2014 it was a different Australia. That\u2019s why we also changed the name,\nbecause when I said my name is Pekarek, it was like talking to, you know, God\nknows what. So 1-it was \u2014 it was very difficult. Then, since she was here, she read\nher \u2014 that the treatment here is much more progressive, with nuclear energy.",
        "Q: I want to go back to when she comes back to Prague.",
        "A: Yeah, please.",
        "Q: Yeah. She\u2019s sick. Did you meet her \u2014 did she return back to your \u2014 her sister\u2019s\napartment as well, and that\u2019s where you met her?",
        "A: Yeah, but we had the \u2014 we had the apartment which I told you I got in central\nPrague.May 4, 2013",
        "Q: I know, but your first meeting, when she comes back, do you remember it?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t think I remember exactly the first couple of days, not really.",
        "Q: Okay. No, so you ha \u2014 all right. And \u2014 and what \u2014 but when she does come back,\nshe\u2019s very sick \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 and so she needs treatment.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And had you had your apartment that you were assigned, already by that time?",
        "A: Yeah, oh yes, yes.",
        "Q: I see. Okay.",
        "A: I had the apartment \u2014 you know, I was \u2014 I told you I was in Prague April 20,\nwhen the nat \u2014 when the Germans were still there \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: \u2014 celebrating Hitler. So, when the \u2014 when \u2014 when the revolution finished at May\nninth \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014I somehow, couple days later, I got the apartment, I don\u2019t know how.",
        "Q: Oh, so it was within a few days, yeah.\n100\nMay 4, 2013",
        "A: But she wasn\u2019t there yet, no, she came much later, because she was on the\nRussian side, and they were not so organized bringing the people back, like when\nyou were somewhere on the western side.",
        "Q: Got it.",
        "A: So eventually she did come back. Now how did she find me? Well, most likely\nthrough her sister.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That\u2019s my guessing now \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 70 years later.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Do I remember exactly how she found me? No.",
        "Q: And did you start working again?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What were you doing?",
        "A: The same firm where I used to work before.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They claim \u2014 there\u2019s a story to it also, they got it back because that\n[indecipherable] was theirs.May 4, 2013",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And we \u2014 even if we had the left le \u2014 leaning government, it was theirs, they got\nit back. And \u2014 since they were quite well off, and they had connections to the\nUnited States. How? The original owner was a very old man. He had quite a few\nchildren. In those days, you know, there were not so many precautions not to get\nchildren, or pregnant, or whatever. So he had, I think, five or six of them. And two\nwere living here in the United States very \u2014 before the war started. One was in\nPhiladelphia, and I don\u2019t know where the other one was living. So, they got the\nthing back, but because it was so left-leaning, the whole Czechoslovakia after\nWorld War II, because the Soviet Union, we were your protectors, and the country\nwas really very much to the left, which we didn\u2019t care for. So this firm had\ndifficulties with the labor force, because they were delivering coal, c-o-a-I-l \u2014 you\nknow, coal?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: What you \u2014 you know, don\u2019t forget, nowadays, you have have gas, you have all\nkinds of things.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But in Prague, coal was the thing to make your morning coffee. So, it was very \u2014\nand horses were the ones which delivered the coal.\n102May 4, 2013",
        "Q: Ah, so now I understand, you worked as an accountant for a coal company.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: I see. I thought it was an accounting company.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no.",
        "Q: No, it was a coal company.",
        "A: I was the accountant \u2014",
        "Q: For the coal co \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 for a company which was selling coal.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And the owner was an old man, he had several sons, but two of them worked in\nthe firm. And it was a very successful firm.",
        "Q: Okay, so now when they come back, they reclaim their firm, do they \u2014 if \u2014 what\ndid \u2014 do they eventually leave it, because you\u2019re talking about this left-leaning\ngovernment?",
        "A: Yes, yes, that\u2019s what I wanted to tell you.",
        "Q: So tell me.",
        "A: One of \u2014 so when \u2014 when \u2014 when this more left-leaning, more left-wingish. So\neventually \u2014 I don\u2019t remember if this was nationalized or not, those things escape\nme. But Hinnek(ph), he was one of the sons, he wanted to get out, but there wasMay 4, 2013\nnowhere to go. To get a visa permit here was very difficult, and the two\n[indecipherable] of his, well, you know, it\u2019s very difficult to make a living here.\nThinking about millions which they had over there, they didn\u2019t have the millions\nhere. So he had difficulties coming, but I promised him when I went to Australia\nthat I will try to see whether I could get him some documents to get to Australia.\nBelieve it or not, I did manage to help him, and he came to Australia eventually,\nwith his wife, two children, and he was driving a cab, of all things. Quite successful,\nbut naturally money-wise no comparison to what he had been. But I\u2019m pretty sure\nthey must have had some money here, or something.",
        "Q: Okay. So let\u2019s go back to left leaning government in Prague. The owners are not\nhappy, they don\u2019t want to stay. What makes you not happy? What specifically?",
        "A: The left-wingish thing. Look, you \u2014 for example, there were elections. You had\nto go with everybody in that firm, and to sing the name of the leader, his name was\nGotwald(ph), and \u2014 and he was the only one who was running. So, having that\nexperience from World War II, we have seen that the country is deteriorating.",
        "Q: So it was \u2014 between \u201940 and \u201948, I was always under the impression that it was\nstill not a communist country.",
        "A: No, but it was very left-wingish, yes.",
        "Q: I see. I see.May 4, 2013",
        "A: And I would say not between \u201940 \u2014 between 1945 when we came back \u2014",
        "Q: Forty-five, yes, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: \u2014 and 1948, definitely. Only one candidate.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: If you liked it or not, he was the only one, and naturally he was the communist\nleader. So it was \u2014 it was not hundred percent communistic, but it was getting there.",
        "Q: Okay, so here\u2019s the other question. You said that when the Nazis came in,\nbecause of their policies, it affected the relationships people had with each other. So\nthat if you were \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 had a frou who was nonjew \u2014 a friend who was non-Jewish, it became \u2014 you\nbecame estranged even through no desire of your own.",
        "A: There is \u2014 it had nothing true with it. If you \u20141f you were not one of \u2014 for\nexample, look, your kid couldn\u2019t go to school, to a college, if he was from a\nbourgeois \u2014 they call it bourgeois family.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what I wanted to find out. How did that develop now, after the war?",
        "A: Tha-That\u2019s how it was. So when you \u2014",
        "Q: Tell us.\n105\nMay 4, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 when your child was born from a bourgeois family, that child couldn\u2019t go to\ncollege.",
        "Q: Well, what was your family considered?",
        "A: Well, I had no children to begin with, but there was no family left, you know, so I\ndidn\u2019t have that kind of a problem, but you didn\u2019t like it.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It smelled too much from controlled leftists. So Nazi \u2014 Hitler was too controlled\nfrom the right side. This was the same damage on the left side.",
        "Q: I have \u2014 there\u2019s one question I forgot to ask you before.",
        "A: Great.",
        "Q: When did you find out what happened to your parents?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s a good question. I think my sister survived, and I think she said she\ngave me the date when they were, so to speak, transported from \u2014 from one camp to\nthe \u2014 to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: So, from Theresienstadt?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And when \u2014 once they got to Auschwitz, there was no way that they could have\nsurvived, because my father would have been old, also a little bit on the sick side.\n106\nMay 4, 2013\nHad difficulties with \u2014 not arthritis, I recalling it\u2019s something else. Had difficulties\nwalking, I don\u2019t remember the name, what they used it for. But they were old\npeople, you know, now my father was born \u201978. So when he got to Auschwitz, say\n1944 - \u201945, so he was close to 70, where I\u2019m now 90, but that was a different time.",
        "Q: Yeah, he was 64 - 65.",
        "A: And \u2014 and you see here, you are a free person whether you live until 90 or 105.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But that was a controlled society. Jewish on top of it, so when they got there, they\nhad no chance.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They had no chance. So my sister knew the date, and she told me. I forgot the\ndate, of course, but she told me when the day came, she couldn\u2019t hold them as a\ndependent any more, and she was the \u2014 and they were deported.",
        "Q: I see, I see.",
        "A: And once they were deported to Auschwitz, well that was, of course, the end,\nyou know\u201d?May 4, 2013",
        "Q: So okay, let\u2019s go back to after the war. So you didn\u2019t \u2014 you didn\u2019t like the way\nyou saw things developing back in Prague.",
        "A: Exactly. That was the truth.",
        "Q: Yeah. What did you \u2014 what actions did you start taking? How did things develop",
        "A: Now see, that I couldn\u2019t take any \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 from thought to action?",
        "A: \u2014I\u2014I didn\u2019t take any, except that I want to get out with Georgine. And being of\nthat age, military age \u2014 now, for example, when I came back, I had to join the army.\nNot that I wanted, that was a compulsory \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 so for, I don\u2019t remember how many months, I was \u2014 I was within the army\noffice, but still I was in the armed forces",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then they passed a law that people who were in a concentration camp, were\nexempt from that service. So I came back to the apartment which I had \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 originally with Georgine. So Georgine came to visit me, how she got there, I\ndon\u2019t know, most likely by bus, because we didn\u2019t have a car. Have a car was aMay 4, 2013\nluxury in those days. So she must have come by bus to visit me, and naturally there\nwas a question of money, because when you are in the military, you don\u2019t make \u2014\nwhat do you make? Nothing. So there were some difficulties. Do I remember what\ndifficulties? Not really. Somehow we made it. You know, maybe some money was\nleft over from the father \u2014 her father. But you know, the \u2014 during that kind of a\nsituation that\u2019s happening here to someb \u2014 not want to touch that that base, but when\npeople \u2014 my father-in-law, when \u2014 when they heard that this one was transported to\nsome camp, and this one \u2014 so, as a precaution, they gave \u2014 they had a housekeeper\nof the house, which was living in the basement, so to speak. So they gave her some\nmoney. How much? No idea. He had a factory. Remember, the time goes back now,\n60 \u2014 70 years. So plastic was a novelty. So, in Czechoslovakia, when you had \u2014\nwhen you bought a drink, let\u2019s say like a Coke. Was not a Coke, like a Coke. So it\nhas a top that you closed, you know, but it was the old-fashioned thing, which was\nvery difficult and maybe not nice looking. So he did a lot, with a partner, plastic \u2014\nyou know \u2014",
        "Q: Screw top.",
        "A: \u2014 th-the tops which we today take for granted, you know, and [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yeah.May 4, 2013",
        "A: So it was a novelty, and he was doing extremely well. So he gave his\nhousekeeper X \u2014 no idea how much \u2014 dollar, but you keep it, and then they come\nback \u2014 you know, you give it back to us. Well, there are lots of people who didn\u2019t\ncome back. In that connection, I would like to refer to a story which appeared in\n\u201cThe Wall Street Journal\u2019 not more than maybe two weeks ago, and I gave it to\nElise to read. Why? Because it turned out that New York state, there are unclaimed\ninsurance policies, monies which were left around in banks. In the bill \u2014 b \u2014 in the\nbillions. And the story was that New York state can get this if it stays unclaimed,\nbecause there is a law, if you don\u2019t claim X after so many years, it becomes the\nproperty of the state. So naturally, New York state, I can imagine if they could get a\ncouple of million, perhaps billion, oh my gosh, you know?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So that was the story, and I have no doubt, insurance companies, banks, and I\u2019m\ntelling to you out of experience, Georgine knew that her father had the life\ninsurance policy with X \u2014 I forgot the name. So when we came here, we tried to get\nin touch with those people, we found some document showing that he had this, and\nhe had that, and whatever. So the answer which we got, if I would look for it, I\nwould find it. I\u2019m not going to take the time now \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.May 4, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 and I will not take the time then either. But they responded that we have to\nproduce a death certificate. Now, to get a death certificate for somebody who passed\naway in Auschwitz, is like \u2014 I don\u2019t have to tell you. So nothing happened. But that\nmeans that that policy was never consummated. So, if he was entitled to those\nbenefits, 10,000 - 100,000, whatever, that was never paid. So really, the unclaimed\namounts which are there, must be in the \u2014 well, I\u2019m telling you, the story was \u2014 they\nmentioned ski \u2014 I think, two billion dollars. Because I\u2019m sure my father-in-law\nwasn\u2019t the only person who did this.",
        "Q: But you\u2019re talking \u2014 when you\u2019re talking about where they were unclaimed, it\nwas in the \u2014 Czechoslovakia where it was unclaimed?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, in Czechoslovakia, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, but there\u2019s \u2014 if the money would have been somehow, say inherited by\nGeorgine, or \u2014 or somehow \u2014",
        "Q: Right. That\u2019s right.",
        "A: \u2014 it would have come \u2014",
        "Q: Come to \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 or maybe to her sister while she was still in the uni \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.\n111\nMay 4, 2013",
        "A: It was never paid, because we could not prove \u2014",
        "Q: His death.",
        "A: \u2014 his death. And I\u2019m sure there were cases, God knows how many, because lots\nof people didn\u2019t come back, especially older people, you know, the young people\nmight have survived [indecipherable] about the older people had no chance. So\nwe re \u2014 I\u2019m just telling you what happened in \u201cWall Street Journal,\u201d which I enjoy\nreading, but that\u2019s not the issue. So the situation was \u2014 it was varied. It was not the\nsame Czechoslovakia, like it was when it was founded. No.",
        "Q: Wer \u2014 were you still there when Jan Masaryk was killed?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: What can you tell us about that, and what happened to \u2014 how did you experience\nit, what did you \u2014",
        "A: Well, we experienced only that somehow he jumped to his death. That was the\nofficial version. Now, the unofficial version was that they threw him out of the\nwindow.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Now, what was true? That depends on what side you are on.",
        "Q: What do \u2014 were people frightened to speak to one another?\n112May 4, 2013",
        "A: Oh yes. Oh, definitely, because you didn\u2019t know what the other person would do\nto enhance his position, whatever he was doing, he or she, yes. It was not the same\nCzechoslovakia, no. And that is in a way part of what you\u2019re asking me, why didn\u2019t\n\u2014 it was not just this threat from the Soviet Union, we didn\u2019t have anything, so what\nwould I have taken, and we just came back. But it was everything, you know, the\ndistrust of each other. The quality of life wasn\u2019t the same. By far not the same.\nReligion, the religion we didn\u2019t practice a religion anyhow, so that didn\u2019t make any\ndifferent. But the life was not the same, no. You talked to a neighbor, you were\nafraid in case you say something, it might be turned over against you. If you were\nmore on the liberal side, rather than communistic side. If you said you don\u2019t like \u2014\nI\u2019m just saying \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 as an example, if you didn\u2019t like this guy, and he was a prominent, say\npolitician, Prague, or whatever. So 1-it was not the same country, by any mean. But\nit was not the same country for two reasons. Unfortunately, the German occupation\ndid it, and the Russian threat continued during it. So that was not that\n[indecipherable] who were the \u2014 originally the spirit. That was \u2014 was missing, that\nwasn\u2019t there. And specially this aunt of mine, who survived the war in Israel, it was\nnot Israel, it was Palestine. It\u2019s the same thing anyway.May 4, 2013",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So she didn\u2019t like it, and she was alerting us to these things more than we did,\nbecause we were thrilled that we are free. We were free. So, for us, we didn\u2019t see it.\nBut she s \u2014 she was, like I say, a different oy \u2014 age, from a different country. She\nsaw it differently, you know? The way she was living, I remember certain things,\nthat she was living in Vienna, she married in Vienna. And she came to Prague with\nher husband, and sh \u2014 I can\u2019t tell you the year. Oh, it must have been before \u00b039,\nbefore Hitler came. She was saying that this is a unstoppable wave, that anything\nwhat is somehow German, will become Nazi German. And I think she was right.\nWhy? I told you earlier, because Hitler provided jobs, and even the people who\nwere \u2014 who had nothing to do with it, became pro-Nazi. I like to say Nazi\nGermany, because I don\u2019t blame today\u2019s generation for what happened 50 - 70\nyears ago. Le \u2014 I mean, these people who are today Germans \u2014 I mean, of course\nthey are German, because they were born there, I mean, they questioned their old\ngrandparents. I mean, how could you have not known, or why could you have\ncondoned this, you know? Different from today\u2019s world than it was at the time, but\nwhen I talk about Germany, I usually say Nazi Germany, or Germany.",
        "Q: Yeah.\n114\nMay 4, 2013",
        "A: Because I\u2019m getting a pension, small pension, couple hundred dollars. Really, it\u2019s\nnot even worth talking about it. Depends on the exchange rate. So Georgine got for\nthe month of May, 200 dollars, and I got five \u2014 200 dollars, another 500 dollars,\nsomething, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So today, in this world, 700 dollars amounts \u2014 is not going to make me rich or\npoor. Yes, it helps me to maintain Georgine, which I told you.",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: But those article, they had nothing to do with the Holocaust. Those articles,\nthey\u2019re like John\u2019s age, or even younger.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: I mean, why should they [indecipherable] they, through taxation, pay me X\ndollars? Well, I\u2019m looking at it, I\u2019m telling you how I feel about it.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Do Ll accept it? I would be crazy not to accept it, but really \u2014",
        "Q: The guilty \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 are not \u2014 the guilty ha \u2014 wer \u2014 got away with it.May 4, 2013",
        "A: You don\u2019t understand me? Sweetheart, I told you I like to say the truth, this is a\ntruth.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I accept thing, well yes, I accept it, because I was working there and all that\nrubbish did happen. But you \u2014 I\u2019m wondering why this generation stole everything?\nDo they feel any moral guilt? Where \u2014 would I feel moral guilt, what my grandfather\nmight have done? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just asking a civilized question, you know?",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah. It\u2019s one question that is \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s so many questions in these\nevents, that \u2014 for which there were no answers, and yet we still look for them.",
        "A: That\u2019s what you saying [indecipherable] saying that\u2019s how I feel, you know?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: If they send me the check, yes I take the money, because automatic it\u2019s coming to\nmy account, so I take it, you know. But from a human point of view, from my\npersonal point of view, I wonder how I would feel if I would be in that situation. His\n\u2014 they didn\u2019t cause it. It was the grandfather, or the grand-grandfather. And to \u2014 to\nanalyze what reasons that person had 50 years ago \u2014 you only can [indecipherable]\nto almighty God.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk a little bit about Georgine, if we can.",
        "A: Sweetheart, Georgine, she\u2019s my wife for 70 plus years.May 4, 2013",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I told you that she was there, right here, where we are.",
        "Q: What I mean is, just give me the outlines of what happened to her, when you\nwere split apart. She was \u2014",
        "A: Sweetheart, she went through Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And anybody who went through Auschwitz, and saw that misery, and had a\nheart, and if sh \u2014 if u\u2014 she was lucky that she didn\u2019t have to work, although when\nthey came here, she did. Remember, she had a British passport, so she was working\nfor the British consulate on Rockefeller Center.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: How long, I can\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t remember, short while, then she got another job. But\nthat\u2019s not the issue. So she was lucky that she could have stayed home. She stayed\nhome when she became pregnant. Well, that was another reason why she had all that\nsurgery, because they were saying, if you treat it with nuclear energy, she will\nbecome sterile. And as a young woman, you know, you didn\u2019t like that. So she had\nthe surgery rather than the \u2014",
        "Q: Right.May 4, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 treatment, and eventually, just like I said, we were working about two years or\nso, and she became pregnant. We had \u2014 she had a vacation, I had a vacation, and\nwas like summertime, she quit her job. Well, then, you know how it takes, it takes a\nfew months to get to that place. So she was very happy, she was a hundred percent\nmother. And having seen all these children perish in Auschwitz, she devoted her life\nto children. Truth is the truth. So she went when John was six, kindergarten, or\nwhatever that system is here. She started to be on the school board. Not as a teacher,\nshe was never a teacher. And through her persistence, integrity, or interest,\nwhatever, she was on the school board for 32 years.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: So here, in this country, they s \u2014 in the local school board here, there\u2019s a room\ndedicated to Georgine\u2019s 32 years of being on the school board, giving service to the\nchildren. Now, if we would have time, she has literally hundreds of these things,\nwhat were \u2014 now we have this.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: So we have all kinds of wooden plaques, testimonials, we had it here hanging.\nWell, you know, they changed.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.\n118\nMay 4, 2013",
        "A: I don\u2019t blame them. This is [indecipherable]. They had here hanging, honorary\ndoctorate. She has a couple of honorary doctorates. What I\u2019m telling you, like I just\ntold you, I am not a person who will make things bigger than they are \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 this is the truth. Where it is now, I don\u2019t know. Elise has a tendency to change\nthings. Which is fine, I\u2019m \u2014 she\u2019s a very hardworking person, and I told you, I like\nall three of them. What happened to it, I don\u2019t know, it was always hanging here. So\nmaybe they put it inside, or something, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Was a proclamation of one university, honorary doctorate in, like they called\nletters, or something? Like writing.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 did you talk with one another about what you both went through, a lot?",
        "A: Very little.",
        "Q: Very little.",
        "A: No, no, because she has the same like I went. Luckily, we both came back.",
        "Q: But you know, here\u2019s another thing that\u2019s unusual. You got married, so that you\nwouldn\u2019t be called up for the army. Everybody \u2014",
        "A: At that time we don\u2019t be deported \u2014",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 to be deported to Theresienstadt.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Okay. So you didn\u2019t get married \u2014",
        "A: Wa -\u2014 one little thing. We were kids.",
        "Q: Yes. How old were you?",
        "A: I married when I was 20. She was 16. We had to have permission from our\nparents.",
        "Q: And they gave the permission?",
        "A: Oh sure.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Well, because they knew what\u2019s coming.",
        "Q: So one could say that you didn\u2019t get married for the most \u2014 I would say normal \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: \u2014 usual of reasons?",
        "A: A hundred percent right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That\u2019s the truth.\n120May 4, 2013",
        "Q: And then when you\u2019re together, you\u2019re young, but somewhere after\nTheresienstadt, you\u2019re separated. And you go through the kinds of experiences that\ncan shatter a person.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You both survive, you come back, and then you spend a lifetime together. That\u2019s\nunusual. I mean, so many people \u2014 that is, so many people can come back from such\ntraumatic experiences, and they\u2019re changed inside.",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 we changed to a certain extent. She got involved with the schools.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I was ma \u2014 much more, say for going to the Metropolitan Opera. So I \u2014\nfinancial were different. So I bought a subscription for two of us. Naturally, we were\nmarried \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 we were vi \u2014 di\u2014 we used to go, there was a show here on Broadway,\nwhatever it was, not important. So we had tickets, two tickets to go to the\nMetropolitan Opera. But now all of a su\u2014 oh John \u2014 Frank, I won\u2019t be able to\nmake it because I have to see Commissioner so and so from the education\ndepartment. So I had two tickets, I went, and I sold one, or gave it away, or whateverMay 4, 2013\nI did. So that went on for about three years like that, that I had two tickets, very\nseldom we used them.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Seldom. But we still had the same interest, we had the same background. We\nknew our parents, her parents, it was the same. She knew my parents, of course. So\nnothing really has changed, really. And proof is what I\u2019m saying is we are \u2014",
        "Q: Seventy-one years.",
        "A: And then \u2014 and \u2014 and financially I told you what it cost. If you multiply by 50,\nand multiplied by five, six years, you don\u2019t talk about 10 dollars.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Do [have any regrets? No. I consider this is my responsibility, no.",
        "Q: What it \u2014 just for the sake of the interview, we\u2019re talking about Georgine, who is\nno longer able to participate in \u2014",
        "A: Very little.",
        "Q: \u2014 normal activities. Who is we \u2014 not well.",
        "A: Well, my \u2014 there was a story in the papers. If you want to read it, we have made\ncopies, that goes back about two, three years. You know what, I tell you something,\nI have to go to my office, and give you a copy.",
        "Q: Okay.\n122\nMay 4, 2013",
        "A: Our life has changed, my life in particular. Because now, I go to eat dinner at\nfour o\u2019clock. I come home when Bibi comes, she comes usually at six, I come\nusually home at 5:15 - 5:30, because it\u2019s only a mile. So I come home. We either\nbring them, or they [indecipherable] or whatever, that\u2019s not the issue. And then she,\nwhen Bibi comes, six o\u2019clock, summertime, wintertime, I go to sleep. And again, I\ntold you, my hours have shifted.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I get up at two o\u2019clock, three o\u2019clock.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Do I complain? No, I just \u2014 this is fine, this is the life it is, my obligation. She\u2019s\nsick, so either you get [indecipherable] not me [indecipherable] or you do what\nyou have to do. And I feel this is what I have to do. We married, we were kids. My\nresponsibility was the same as it was 50 years ago.",
        "Q: When you \u2014",
        "A: Before you go, I give you the story from the newspaper.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Free of charge.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They \u2014 they made copy \u2014 made a bunch of copies.\n123\nMay 4, 2013",
        "Q: And the story from the newspaper is about what?",
        "A: Well, is what I\u2019m telling you, that we were separated because of Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Oh, I see, it\u2019s about you. The story from the newspaper is about you, okay.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, about \u2014 well, it was about both of us, but actually it\u2019s more\nabout what I\u2019m doing with \u2014 you know, I was always working.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Some of u \u2014 I mean, one of us had to make a living.",
        "Q: Did you feel like you were a different person when you came back from\nAuschwitz, though?",
        "A: Oh sure \u2014 oh, from Auschwitz, of course. I was a grown-up man, I was a kid\nwhen I went in. No, no question about it. You understood what life is, what brutality\nis. Don\u2019t forget, there were instances where some prisoners wanted to escape.\nRussian in particular, I have to say the truth. You know, we had to witness when\nthey were literally beaten to death. Why did they ask us to witness this? To\ndiscourage other people from doing it. And that\u2019s pi \u2014 after all these years, I\u2019m still\nseeing it once in a while.

I\nmean, pork was not like here, you know, pork \u2014 people don\u2019t eat pork. And I don\u2019t\neat it now either. My f\u2014 every day I fish.

        "A: Oh, definitely.",
        "A: Definitely. Not only that, but our constitution was identical to the US.\nconstitution, because the U \u2014 you know, the United States president at that time,\nWilson, was very instrumental of carving out Czechoslovakia. You would have to\nknow more about the history, but Europe was occu \u2014 no, I shouldn\u2019t say occupied,\nsay ruled by the Austrian-Hungarian empire.",

And everything \u2014 the language was much\nmore German, because the Czechs were part of that Austrian empire. But then one\nof the \u2014 one of the principle politicians over there at the time, Masarek(ph), he\npetitioned \u2014 came here, and he petitioned Wilson, and I don\u2019t know who came afterMay 4, 2013\nhim, or before him, to es \u2014 to give the Czechs the [indecipherable] determination\nright.",

There was \u2014 the state was\ncalled Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia. Those were three states which were, so to\nspeak, the bone of Czechoslovakia. So when, apparently here, or there, when they\nrealize it\u2019s too small to be independent, somehow they attached Slovakia to it. And\nthat\u2019s why it became Czechoslovakia. The original three states \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and then another two or three states to the \u2014 I say to the \u2014 to the \u2014",

        "A: \u2014 school \u2014 I went to a German school, because at \u2014 wi \u2014 you know,\nCzechoslovakia, that time there was no Czechoslovakia, so when Czechoslovakia\nwas founded, just like here, you had a better chance to get a position when you\nspeak Spanish, and certainly English. So there, my mother, I remember her saying\nall the time, whatever you want to do in life, you have to talk Czech, which was our\nlanguage \u2014",

        "A: Ch \u2014 oh, sure.",
        "A: Not at all. The first time I heard Yiddish, you would not believe it, when I was\ngoing to Auschwitz. I never heard of Yiddish. There was Czech, or German. Now,\nif you didn\u2019t speak well German, maybe you had some kind of a mishmash of\nGerman, but not Yiddish. I have \u2014 my friends they was all Czechs, I mean, who\nspoke anything else but Czech?",
        "A: Yes, th-this \u2014 somehow \u2014 my father used to say that his family came from \u2014 that\nwould be west \u2014 from the southwest of Bohemia. And he was \u2014 he thought that his\nancestor were Catholics, but there were \u2014 you know, there was all kinds of reforms\ngoing on under \u2014 not Martin Luther King here \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 but the original Luther.",
        "A: And there was also somebody in \u2014 in Prague by the name of Jan Hus, h-u-s.",
        "A: So there was a certain split in the \u2014 in the religion.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.May 4, 2013",
        "A: And \u2014 and he thinks that instead of choosing the sides between the two split\nCzech \u2014 Catholic religion, that they chose the Jewish religion. This why our name is\nnot Jewish, you know, our name \u2014 the Jewish, let\u2019s say, names in Prague, they were\nthe Feldmans, like my wife\u2019s single name, or the Schwarzkopf(ph), just like here.",
        "A: Exactly. Now look, here somebody is called Schwarzkopf(ph), you know he is\nsomehow Jewish.",
        "A: Or German.",
        "A: Well, that was exactly in Prague. So to know somebody by the name of Pekarek\nand be Jewish, that didn\u2019t exist. And I will tell you a small story when I was a kid,\nand I went to the German school, not speaking German. But I remember that my\nteacher, that was the first grade, second grade, you know, I was what, six, seven\nyears old. Somehow she is \u2014 there was some question about religion, and she assign\nme to the class, or to the time to have religious schooling, to the Catholic class,\nbecause of the Czech name. Well, I didn\u2019t speak any German, but somehow I\nobjected to it, and I said that I was Jewish. Th \u2014 so she sent me to the Jewish class,May 4, 2013\nor whatever, but I remember the name, that was not a Jewish name at all. Now, this\n\u2014 we were Jewish. This \u2014 we were born as Jewish people, but then, unfortunately\nwhat happened \u2014 I told you I was not a very proud Jew, no, because everything what\nhappened was because of the Jewish faith. And lots of things happened, ma-maybe\nwe come to it.",
        "A: But so \u2014",
        "A: The name I change for different reason. If you want me to tell it to you now, Pll\ntell it to you now.",
        "A: Well, we were \u2014 my name was Pekarek.",
        "A: I married Georgine, she was Pekarek, of course. And then what happened 1 \u2014 th-\nthat was 1947 \u2014 \u2019\u00b048, the infl \u2014 at that time, the influence of Soviet Russia was\ntremendous. Why? Because that goes to polit \u2014 politics. The Czechs always felt that\nthe west let them down. Th-The \u2014 the che \u2014 the \u2014 the west means England, not the\nUnited States, the United States was out of this world. But England, France,\npartially Italy, that instead of helping the Czechs, so to speak, maintain theirMay 4, 2013\nidentity, freedom, they let them down, and then in turn, Hitler marched in, and the\nwhole situation has changed. So the Russia influence was very strong. We,\nGeorgine and me, we didn\u2019t care for it, because we have seen what happened when\nyou don\u2019t have freedom. We both survived Auschwitz, we came back in 1945, and\nwere living in Prague as best as we could have done it, until \u201947 - \u201948. But when the\nsituation became very, very difficult, we didn\u2019t like it. We thought again, we might\nhave to go through the same thing. Maybe not the extremes, but hardly the freedom\nwhich we were hoping for. Well, we decided to get out of Czechoslovakia, which\nwas 19 four \u2014 late \u201947, early \u201948. I couldn\u2019t get out, because I was, quote, military\nage. So I thought that if I somehow split with Georgine, that by myself I will be\neasier to get out than two of us with luggage and all and that stuff. That\u2019s how we\nthought of it. Well, I met somebody by the name of Hyde. His name was Walter E.\nHyde. Through him, I got a English passport. So Georgine left Prague in February\n1948. I couldn\u2019t get out that quickly. In the meantime she went from Prague to\nLondon, stayed in London for a while. From her mother\u2019s side, they were here,\nsurviving the situation in Ecuador. Now, of the f \u2014 all these countries, I\u2019 Il tell you\nwhy Ecuador. That was Georgine\u2019s uncle from her mother\u2019s side; he was a dentist.\nBut he didn\u2019t care for dentistry, he was more like a businessman sitting on the board\nof directors here, sitting on the board of directors there. And somehow he became\nMay 4, 2013\nconsul general of Ecuador. Well, how he got Ecuador, I can\u2019t tell you. But that\u2019s\nhow it was. So it was \u2014 unfortunately, the situation became worse, before Hitler and\nall that stuff. He was trying to convince Georgine\u2019s mother and father to go to\nEcuador because he was able to give them the visa to go to Ecuador. Well, my\nmother, you know, they were in a different situation. They had a house like a house,\nand those days there were no mortgages in Prague. So to leave your house, to leave\nyour business, that was unheard of. Why should I go to Ecuador to listen to those\nidiots down there, or something? This is my home. Well, unfortunately, it didn\u2019t\nwork out in the long run, but since they survived in Ecuador, in Quito, they came\nafter the war here, like most of people usually do. So when Georgine was in\nEngland, she heard, of course, of her aunt and uncle, that they were here \u2014 they\nwere in Ecuador at that time. But they know they were living in \u2014 in Ecuador.\nThey came here and that uncle of hers had some earlier connections to somebody\nwho was a manufacturing person. And because of the Cold War which existed\nalready at that time, somehow the United States government was pumping much\nmore money into Puerto Rico, as a prevention that Puerto Rico wouldn\u2019t go too\nmuch left, like some of the countries did.",
        "A: So he was \u2014 he was offered to build a factory in Puerto Rico. So since that uncle,\nwho was a dentist representative of Ecuador, he told him, well, if you just came\nfrom Ecuador, you speak Spanish, you want to manage my factory\n[indecipherable] from Prague. So they settled to Puerto Rico for some time. So\nGeorgine, not having any other family, from England, went to the United States,\nwent to Puerto Rico.",
        "A: So we stayed, of course, I was in Prague. Not divorced, that was not the question\n[indecipherable]. But I managed to get out of Prague. By myself it was easier than\ntogether with Georgine. So, when I got out of Prague, naturally I had nowhere to\ngo. But the train took me to Paris. Well, I have to say something in favor of the\nFrench, irrespective of their view today, of that view. The French, at that time, were\nextremely helpful. They tried to reunite families who were split, you didn\u2019t know\nwhere \u2014 last time saw him here, last time you saw him there. So it was very difficult,\nbut the French were helping. And they were helping also, the people like myself,\nwho all of a sudden, from Prague, was in Paris. We were called DPs, displaced\npeople. And I got to Paris couple days before July 14\", I\u2019m sure you know what\nJuly 14\" is. Well at that time, of course, that time was the different. That was 1948,\nand de Gaulle was still around, and he was running down Champs Elysees, I\nMay 4, 2013\nremember like today. When I did go to France, to Paris, I was supposed to see\nsomebody who somebody knew somebody in Prague, and I was supposed to see\nthose people. So those people took me to that celebration of July 14\". Now,\nspreading out this story which I\u2019m just telling you, my sister \u2014 or rather, my mother\nhad a sister, who had married a Viennese person, all Jewish, but she didn\u2019t like the\nsituation as it was. And, before Hitler came in, she decided, with the husband, to go\nto, at that time Palestine. There was no Israel. You had to take the boat, which was\nvery difficult, because Prague is right in the middle of Europe, there\u2019s no ocean\naround.",
        "A: There\u2019s no \u2014 no Czech navy, no nothing. But she managed somehow, through\nsomeone else, to get the per \u2014 the documents, and she survived the Hitler years in\nJerusalem. [indecipherable] I \u2014 I don\u2019t know which town she survived, but she\nwas there. So when she came back to Prague looking for her family, but there was\nno family except us, my sister, me. But she didn\u2019t like it because she said exactly\nwhat we have found out later on. That it\u2019s too autocratic, too left-wingish, and she\nthought there was no future for Czechoslovakia to survive again. So somehow she\nhas some friends in Australia. So she convinced my sister to go with her. The \u2014May 4, 2013\nincidentally, the husband of my aunt passed away, and he is buried on the mount \u2014\nwhat is the name of the mountain in Israel? I forgot the name of the mountain.",
        "A: Yeah, he is buried there.",
        "A: But she came back by herself, and she convinced my sister to go with her to\nAustralia. Now, my sister, you know, she was very much into languages. So, for her\nto speak English, French, Italian, although she was born in Prague, she spoke all\nthese languages. So, she was \u2014 for her to go to Australia was no problem, she spoke\nEnglish. So they went to Australia. Well, the trip to Australia by boat, that\u2019s a long\ndistance, this is not around the corner. So when they arrived in Australia, I was in\ntouch with them, or they were in touch with me, they helped me to get to Australia.\nAnd the French \u2014",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: From Paris. But, from Paris you had to go to Marseilles, and the ship to s \u2014\nthere, took 60 days.",
        "A: Well, this how it was. So in the 60 days, I got into Australia in January \u00b049. I left\nJuly \u00b048, I got into Australia January \u201949. So when I go to Australia, of course,\nGeorgine, we were married. She took the first plane, and she came to Australia,\nand we were living in Melbourne for a few years.",
        "A: Because Georgine was \u2014 sh-she had a passport 1n the name of Hyde.",
        "A: So I didn\u2019t like to be someone else, so I dro \u2014 and the name, at that time in\nAustralia, to have a Czech name was \u2014 they couldn\u2019t pronounce it, and \u2014",
        "A: No, I changed my name only after we got the passport in the [indecipherable] if\nthe passport would have been in the name of MacDonald, I would be MacDonald.",
        "A: No, we got it in Prague, that\u2019s how Georgine got out, she got out as Georgine\nHyde.May 4, 2013",
        "A: I chose because of her name, that\u2019s it.",
        "A: Not at that point, but at \u2014 eventually, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And see, she had the name Hyde, and \u2014",
        "A: No, I got that passport in Prague.",
        "A: Well, I was still Frank Pekarek.",
        "A: But she was Georgine Hyde. So she got out as Georgine Hyde, and she was\nliving in austral \u2014 in \u2014 in England as Georgine Hyde.",
        "A: Because she had a British passport.May 4, 2013",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Then I lost the Pekarek, sure. I have here to show you, if you want to come to\nmy office, I have a certificate that I passed an accounting test as Pekarek.",
        "A: So it was very difficult.",
        "A: Here. I changed the name here \u2014",
        "A: \u20141in the United States, yes.",
        "A: When we were living in Queens, I\u2019ve \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the name of the lawyer\nwho did it, but it\u2019s un \u2014 my legal name here \u2014",
        "A: \u20141s Frank pek \u2014 not Frank Pekarek, but Frank Hyde.",
        "A: I kept the P from Pekarek.",
        "A: It\u2019s not Peter, it\u2019s the P I kept for sentimental reasons, for my father\u2019s sake, shall\nI say? So \u2019'm Frank Hyde, and John \u2014 John, my son, of course, was born as John\nHyde. Everything is back to John Hyde \u2014 I mean, Frank Hyde, Georgine Hyde.",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: No, you see, what happened, when the situation has gradually changing in\nCzechoslovakia \u2014",
        "A: Before the German came \u2014 well, they was \u2014 I don\u2019t know how much history you\nknow, but there were negotiations somehow, the influence of Hitler.",
        "A: That was a story the other day in \u201cThe Wall Street Journal,\u201d exactly what I\u2019m\ntelling you, if the allied forces at that time would have done something to stop\nHitler, that would not have happened, but they were not interested, maybe the\nMay 4, 2013\ninterest was somewhere else. So, he became too powerful. There was also a\nrecession in that world. Was a recession here \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 because \u2014 because \u2014 whatever they call it here.",
        "A: A depression, that\u2019s correct. So, he promised jobs, and he promi \u2014 he didn\u2019t say\nhow, but what he did, you have t \u2014 again, I\u2019m talking about history, after World War\nI, the French and German were not always friends.",
        "A: Not really.",
        "A: I\u2014 not to my knowledge, no.",
        "A: No. What changed was, like I said, there were negotiations, they wa \u2014 he had\ncertain demands. The border countries of that old Bohemia, which was somehow\ncreated by \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 this government here, to give them \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 border. That was occupied by German minorities. But since the constitution\nwas like here, everybody was alike, and there was no ant \u2014 anti-German feeling, or\nanything like that. But, let\u2019s go back to that recession which we had. So, when that\nwas all the world was the depression, and Hitler promised jobs. Now, how did he\ndeliver the job? Because, like I started to say, after World War I, the League of\nNation, which was the forerunner of the United Nations, they thought Germany, not\nHitler, there was Hindenburg, which was the president.",
        "A: They told him, you cannot go to this area of Europe, and in this area of Europe,\nwhich was called the Saar, s-a-a-r. And another place goes by.",
        "A: Which was something like say, our Detroit, with the factories of automobiles \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and all this.",
        "A: So he invaded those two places, and nobody stopped him. If they would have\nstopped him, maybe he wouldn\u2019t have been so powerful. But because they didn\u2019t\nstop him, maybe they didn\u2019t have the power to stop him.",
        "A: He has grown. So there was no \u2014 no anti-Semitism in Prague, or anything of that\nnation. Everybody was Czech, and on the contrary, if you didn\u2019t speak well Czech,\nyou were \u2014 somehow you \u2014 you were not liked, if I can say that word. And in that\nconnection, I would also like to tell you, into my house where I was living,\nsomebody moved in from Poland, ab \u2014 what used to call 1s \u2014 a Polish Jew. His name\nwas Ehrlstein(ph). Well, the name tells you already, German Jew, so \u2014 he became a\nleader of the Jewish population at that time, because somebody has to represent the\nJews \u2014",
        "A: \u20141n connection to the Czech government \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and what followed, the German government. So he was appointed to be leader\nof the Jewish community. Since he moved into the house where we were living,May 4, 2013\nspoke poorly Czech \u2014 German was not liked, because we were now, all of a sudden,\nenemies with the German \u2014 my mother had his wife to go shopping, and all this\nstuff. Now that [indecipherable] they\u2019re all down the road, why we stayed in\nPrague longer than other people who were already deported, in camp number one.",
        "A: Not until 1937 - 1938.",
        "A: It was the same.",
        "A: Well, the Czechs were forced to give up some of these border countries. So there\nwas a resentment against the rest, because officially Russia was \u2014 officially. They\nwere not doing much, but officially they were. So, the negotiations were primarily\nbetween Germany, France \u2014 | can even tell you the name of the prime minister of\nGermany, who was negotiating at that time, wa \u2014 he was a [indecipherable] from\nlike a \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, aristocrat. His name was Ribbentroph(ph). Well, I \u2014 the \u2014 some other\nname came back to me, and on the Italian side was Count Charnow(ph). And thoseMay 4, 2013\npeople were pushing \u2014 well, at that time they were negotiating with Prime Minister\nChamberlain. Now, naturally, in those days, when you gave your word, you were\nsupposed to keep your word. So Hitler, through Chamberlain, through\nRibbentroph(ph), and Italian Charnow(ph), Hitler promised the dema \u2014 the\ndemand on the Czechs to give up those border countries, is his last territorial\ndemand. Chamberlain believed it, because in those days, when you signed\nsomething, you were believing. So he went back to - Chamberlain went back to\nLondon, where he came from, and showed a piece of paper, and this piece of paper\nis a guarantee of peace in our lifetime. Well, he didn\u2019t realize whom he was deali \u2014\ndealing with. But coming back to \u2014 to the Czechs, so there was a certain animosity,\nof course, because all of a sudden, instead of having the country like this, it was like",
        "A: \u2014 sliced, and you know, undefensible(ph).",
        "A: And in the \u2014 the \u2014 the attitude towards German was all of a sudden they were not\nour citizens, they were our enemies, because they wanted to join Germany.",
        "A: Primarily because he promised jobs, which we couldn\u2019t deliver at the time. So\nnow all the European continent really turned pro-German. The Austrians, they want\nto be German. They were German speaking people, but they were so different from\nactually Germany, that it was not \u2014 you know, th-thinking about, he promised jobs,\nand he delivered the jobs. Making his armed forces, making all these weapons,\nwhich he developed.",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: No, not at that time, no. We were still playing soccer like everybody else\n[indecipherable] didn\u2019t play any role, no. It really started much later, when he came\ninto Prague, which was in March ninethir \u2014 1939. Well \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Czechoslovakia ceased to exist.",
        "A: And they no \u2014 they named it the protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia. Had\nsomething like a \u2014 what we call the governor, or something. And the Czechs were\nrepresented by a figurehead. Then the list started to change, yes.",
        "A: Anti-Semitism to a certain extent, because they were always connected, the\nJewish were looked at \u2014 German speaking people, rather than Czech speaking\npeople. The names were German. So it started to deteriorate. To what extent? Not\nthat much, but then started the transportations.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s changed primarily because young Czech pe \u2014 young Jewish people, th\n\u2014 we were forced to go on certain labor. We were single men, that\u2019s why we\nmarried. The single Jewish people, they were \u2014 well, they were taught to meet\nsomewhere, and that\u2019s was something what I always call like Madison Square\nGarden. We don\u2019t have Madison Square Garden in Prague \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 but something like Madison Square Garden.",
        "A: We had to \u2014 we had to report, and we had to do certain work for the Germans.",
        "A: Well, it was \u2014 no, I don\u2019t remember the name, but I have to tell you, before that\nstarted, when they marched in, March \u00b039.",
        "A: I was 18, I was working for a Jewish firm. The Jewish management was thrown\nout, and a German administrator was sent in. I was still working when he came in, in\nhis black uniform, and a red \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 swastika. And we were \u2014 the location was just across from the Gestapo\nheadquarter.",
        "A: But they didn\u2019t, you know, you didn\u2019t do anything, so they didn\u2019t bother you, but\nyou s \u2014 you saw the changes which gradually occurred. At home I don\u2019t think I have\nseen so many changes. Maybe I didn\u2019t pay attention to it. I was a young man, they\nstill u\u2014 before Hitler came, you know, we still went to dance. And there was a\nresentment, but there was still freedom enough to go and enjoy \u2014 don\u2019t forget, I was\nwhat, 18 years. So what did 18 years do here? The same thing they do over there.\nWe went to dance. I remember the place where we used to go. It was called coffee\nshop, but not the type of a coffee shop what we call here a coffee shop. It was muchMay 4, 2013\nmore elaborate, it was more like a, I would say really full blown restaurant with a\ndancing \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 room \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 spot where you could dance, and the young people were dancing, we were\ndancing. But that gradually has changed, because \u2014",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think he lost the job at that point. I think he retired, he was forced to\nretire. So he was home, my mother was always home. I don\u2019t know how they were\nmaking a living, I was \u2014 but I remember the first salary which I got when I was\nworking for that Jewish firm, naturally my obligation was to bring it home. That was\nunderstood. It was never thought by me tha \u2014 or by the parents, that somehow I\nwould take it and spend it somewhere. We were \u2014 that was ex \u2014 you know, that was\nanticipated and expected from you. Life was very different in those days. But it has\nchanged, you know. I lost that job because ultimately he found out that I was Jewish,May 4, 2013\nor whatever, and it was [indecipherable] how could I have worked with somebody\nwith a swastika, and all this stuff. Soon it became \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it became worse.",
        "A: No, no \u2014 well, that was his mentality. But you know, th-the \u2014 the life has\nchanged, what has changed? The laws have changed. So th \u2014 we were playing that\nsoccer. Everybody realize there was no restriction, no nothing. But gradually the\nnon-Jewish population was put on such pressure, not to socialize with Jews \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that all of a sudden your friends, were afraid to be your friends. So, the\nrelationship has ceased. Everything became a separate society. The Jewish people\nwere \u2014 we had to wear Jewish stars, we had to be home at eight o\u2019clock. So there\nwere certain restrictions which were put on the Jewish population, which became,\nyou know, like what they call here [indecipherable] it didn\u2019t happen overnight, but\nit was, you know. The first thing, for example, that I remember, as a kid I used to\nplay the violin. Well, don\u2019t ask me what day, what year, but all of a sudden we were\nsupposed to submit all those musical instruments to a certain place. Well, but it\u2019s notMay 4, 2013\nthat I didn\u2019t agree, you \u2014 you were afraid not to agree. So you did what you were\ndoing, because the Catholic population, they could not help you, because they were\nafraid themselves. So, the \u2014 the \u2014 the hostilities, or the violence, increased. So that\nthere was a distinct difference between the Jewish population, and the non-Jewish\npopulation. And the very first transport, as I remember, a cousin of mine, he was\nmuch older than I was, but that\u2019s not the issue, the only reason I\u2019m saying it,\nbecause with his wife, somehow they had no children. She \u2014 she lost a child and she\ncouldn\u2019t have more children, or whatever, they were one of the first ones to be\ndeported to a Polish ghetto which was called L\u00e9dz, l-o-d-z, is a town in Poland.\nThey survived there until a certain time, when that was also liquidated, and he\nwound up in Auschwitz. Lost his leg in Auschwitz and everything else, but they\ncame back after the war, and \u2014 because so few people survived, I was reasonably\nclose to them at one point, you know. Remember, the age was different, he was born\n1900, and I was born 1921, so it\u2019s 20 years different. So when we came back, I was\nonly 22, 24, he was already close to 50.",
        "A: So there was a different. But eventually they also left for Austria. Austria was\nvery helpful.May 4, 2013",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, we were kids, we were dancing the same group of people.",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: Well, not from childhood, but when she was maybe 14 - 15, and I was four years\nolder, you know. Now, what the Jewish people did, or at least our group did, there\nwas somebody who \u2014 the father had the wholesale business, and the wholesale\nbusiness was in a building which he owned, in the old section of Prague, not far\nfrom where I was growing up. And they used to go to that house to dance. But\nremember, in those days we talk about zillion years back.\nMay 4, 2013",
        "A: Yeah, you had a gramophone, if you remember, and that had to be hooked up,\nand you put the disk on it, and that\u2019s the music we used to have.",
        "A: If you remember \u201cPennies from Heaven.\u201d",
        "A: Well, that was a \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 thing which was in, you know, insp \u2014 but also, at that time, why did it change?\nBecause also Jewish people who spoke German, very little Czech \u2014 Czech nationals,\nbut they were living in those border countries. So when those border countries had\nto be given back to Germany, because sh \u2014 they came back. So, naturally they were\nJewish, and we were Jewish, so somehow there were more of these girls, who came\nback from these countries, so we were, all of a sudden, instead of six people, we\nwere say 12 people or 14 people. And we used to go to dance \u2014 I don\u2019t remember its\nname, but that\u2019s not important. We went to that house, and in those days you had \u2014 I\nthink Georgine had it, was an electric gramophone, so you didn\u2019t have to crank it up\nMay 4, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 you had to plug it in, and that was the music we used to dance to. But that\u2019s \u2014\ngradually it changed. It was very difficult, 1t was dangerous to go and be found out\nthat you do these things, which were \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 normal things, but they not normal under those conditions. So it has changed,\nyou know, so you know, the deportations started. The deportations didn\u2019t start in\nAuschwitz, it started in that first ghetto, which they said will be a model ghetto.",
        "A: Theresienstadt. Terezin, in Czech. Now Terezin was of \u2014",
        "A: Well, for example, her fa \u2014 parents, because they were [indecipherable] they had\na house. So number one they had to move out of their house, their house was given\nto some German family, a \u2014 a lieutenant or whatever he was, you know. So it started\ngradually, you know, it was not that there were mass transportation, or deportations,\nno. But a limited amount of people were sent to Terezin.",
        "A: Okay.May 4, 2013",
        "A: Well, that \u2014 I don\u2019t think I remember how it developed, you know. It was the\nsame group of people that used to go to dance. Now how \u2014",
        "A: Well, no, no, it was \u2014 well, no. Used to go to dance, like I said.",
        "A: The marriage didn\u2019t happen that way.",
        "A: The marriage happened because all of a sudden the edict came \u2014 don\u2019t hold me to\nthe numbers.",
        "A: Five hundred men, 5,000 men, we had to report to be deported \u2014 when you were\nsingle. So everybody who had a girlfriend got married. We didn\u2019t get married\nbecause we thought we would have children in the United States. We got married\nbecause we \u2014 once you were married, you postponed the deportation. Now, under\nthose circumstances which existed at that time, everything in your life at the time,May 4, 2013\nwas to delay the deportation, because you knew where you were, but you did not\nknow what will come once you go. So you did anything to delay the deportation. So\nif you \u2014 1f you look at the calendar, you will remember that in 1941, when we got\nmarried, Pearl Harbor happened.",
        "A: So we thought, oh my gosh, now the United States will go to war with the \u2014 it\nwill be over before we go.",
        "A: So everything was done to delay that thing. Now, since you were married all of a\nsudden, whether it was this girlfriend, or this \u2014 or vice versa, from the girl\u2019s point of\nview, we got married. Now, of course, the circumstances were very, very different\nalready. Number one, we had to wear a Jewish star. Transportation, there was hardly\nany in place. Now the streetcars, which we had at that \u2014 remember, we talk about\n1939 - 1940, so different now, no doubt. But at the time we had streetcars. And the\nstreetcars, the entrance was in the middle. So there was a front part, and a rear part.\nSo the Jewish people had naturally to be in the rear part.",
        "A: So when we got married, well, we had to go to the rear part, to \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nwhere we went. No, I know where we went. Her sister [indecipherable] you know,\nMay 4, 2013\nthe life in Prague at that time, there \u2014 there was no different between I told you,\nJews, non-Jews, people got married. So her sister got married to a Czech person, not\nJewish person. And they were living in a certain place, I can\u2019t remember the street\nany more, but I remember where it was.",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: It was called Libe, I-i-b-e and on the end was like a little \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 something, like that. And sh \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it was her house, or an\napartment, I don\u2019t remember that, but I know it was supposed to \u2014 that\u2019s where we\nhad our quote, wedding celebration, if you want to call it. But all this was in a very,\nvery limited way.",
        "A: Because the circumstances were not to allow you to do something\nostentiously(ph) or something \u2014",
        "A: \u2014no. But we got married in October 1941, and like I just told you, because so\nmany young men were supposed to report \u2014 let\u2019s call it to Madison Square GardenMay 4, 2013\nfor work. Now once you were married, you still reported, but you were not deported.\nNow the deportation were already taking place. Now, if I may inject something \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 what I was doing when I quote lost my accounting job? You had to work. If\nyou didn\u2019t work, you didn\u2019t get your stamps, which you needed to buy food, so we\nhad to work. So naturally you had no choice what you would like to do for work.\nYou were told what to do. Now, you have to realize that some of these Jewish\npeople, including her father, mother, when they were deported, they left behind this,\nlet\u2019s say. So that had to be emptied, because the landlord wanted to rent it. so he\ncouldn\u2019t rent it when all the stuff was there. So I was assigned to a unit which was\nemptying out sewing machines. [horn sound] My ear?",
        "A: Oh, this were \u2014",
        "A: The \u2014 the sewing machines in those days were heavy clunkers. I don\u2019t know if\nyou remember that, they were, you know, big stuff. Iron. Not like now plastic, and\nyou put it on the table\nMay 4, 2013",
        "A: So mirrors, pictures and sewing machines were a \u2014 were taken out of those\napartment and they were stored in a large synagogue in a suburb of Prague. I was in\nthat unit which was doing this \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 work. Now, since we had pictures from the Jewish family \u2014 at that time, if you\nremember, maybe you don\u2019t remember, because your age, west Europe was already\nunder the attack by British, maybe American planes. So some of these planes hit\nGerman households. So the German government gave these burned-out families,\nsomething what we have here, what we call food stamps. Now, they were not having\nfood stamps, but they had stamps to buy certain things, to reestablish them in\nPrague, or wherever they were living. Now, let\u2019s shall \u2014 talk about Prague, because\nthat\u2019s where I was active. So when they came, and they had these stamps, coupons,\nor whatever it was, that they could buy two paintings. Now, naturally they didn\u2019t\npay for it, they gave you that stamps in return. But there was no gallery, like here in\na gallery, you know, you \u2014 that was a pile of paintings, that it was segregated\nbetween certain items of paintings; animals, or flowers, or whatever. They \u2014 in\nGerman they call it stil leben.",
        "A: So, I remember that when these people came in, they wanted to have a stil leben\nfor their dining room, so I had to hold it, because they wanted to look at it. So when\nI was holding it, you know, that\u2019s how you hold stil \u2014 why do I mention it? So when\nwe got married, in October 1941, and I was still working for that Jewish\norganization, assembling the sewing machine, pictures, and all that stuff. So when\nwe had to report to, quote, Madison Square Garden, there was naturally an SS guy\nwho directed the \u2014 the people, the traffic where you had to check in, where you had\nto go. Somehow he remembered that he was buying \u2014 buying a painting that \u2014 which\nI was holding. So, h-he called me out from the deportation, and he said, you stay\nhere. So naturally then \u2014 remember, I spoke perfectly German, I had German\nschools, and then you \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 improve it, because everything was German. So I was telling him that I have\nalso a wife here. So somehow we found where Georgine was, and the delay, again,\neverything was always delay, delay, delay.",
        "A: My parents, they sta \u2014 that was a difference, I \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Tl tell you. So, we were delayed, not by a long time, no, but it was a delay.\nWeek, or something, whatever. You talk about my parents. My sister worked for the\nJewish government, the government which was connected to the German\ngovernment. Don\u2019t forget, the Germans didn\u2019t do any orders, they gave the orders to\nthe Jewish government. So there was a Jewish police, there was a Jewish this \u2014\neverything \u2014 not everything, of course, but within certain \u2014 so my sister was working\nfor that Jewish organization, call it the Jewish government. And that was primarily\nbecause, if you remember I told you, that person who came into our house where we\nwere living. So he knew my mother, he knew my sister \u2014",
        "A: Edelstein(ph). So he was delaying their deportation. So they stayed\n[indecipherable] in Prague much longer than I and Georgine, or her parents.",
        "A: How long [indecipherable] how long, but you know, eventually they also came\nto Theresienstadt, just like my sister. But sh \u2014 my sister, from the job in Prague,\nshe had the same job in Theresienstadt, because \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 she was working for the Jewish government.",
        "A: The office.",
        "A: You know, don\u2019t forget they had \u2014 they had statistics, they knew how many\npeople they killed. I tell you they knew exactly how they killed. They had system,\nand if you read back, you know, the papers what I have here \u2014 I will have to look for\nit to show it to you, tru \u2014 they knew my transportation number when I was, well,\nwith Georgine, when we left Prague for Theresienstadt, the \u2014 the transport had a\nname, the transport had a number. We had a number. I don\u2019t remember the number,\nof course, but I have papers here to show you. So, my parents were actually deported\nlater.",
        "A: They \u2014 they perished, of course, just like everybody perished. But they \u2014 later th\n\u2014 they lived a little longer, let\u2019s say, before they got into Auschwitz, and Auschwitz\nwas, of course, the end of it. Because you, when you were in Auschwitz, and you\ncame with a train, and in front of you stood that doctor, whatever his name was. And\nhe decided as you go this way, or that way. Natch \u2014 now, you have to realize, I like\nto tell you, we know now when we say the word Auschwitz, we know what it 1s.\nBut you have to go back to 1941, when we got married, \u201942. So when we were living\nin Theresienstadt, our clothes \u2014 they didn\u2019t have any prisoner clothes \u2014 it was\nMay 4, 2013\nhorrible. But it was a paradise compared to what happened. Why do I say it?\nBecause, you know Theresienstadt is an old town, named after Queen\nTheresienstadt, or whatever she was [indecipherable]",
        "A: And naturally, those were barracks for the Czech armed forces. Now there wasn\u2019t\nthat much space, nor that many beds or anything. So they constructed bunks, three\non top of each other. So that was a terrible shortage of space. When you went to the\nbathroom, you had to have your container for soap, you went there, you know. It\nwas not a bathroom in a sense, like you go here. So, it was very difficult. The\ncrowds. You had to wait in line to get your food, you know. So when you come\nfrom a normal atmosphere like here \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean my house per se \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and then all of a sudden you have a regimented life, you have to be there seven\no\u2019clock, or nine o\u2019clock, or whatever. And then you slept three on top of each other,\nwhich one are you going to go? On top, in the middle, or down below? So there\nwere arguments among people, Jewish people, but don\u2019t forget, they were not only\nJewish people there \u2014\nContact reference@ushmn.org for further information about this collectionMay 4, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 there are also Jewish people from some other places, because it was supposed\nto be a model ghetto, and hit \u2014 and Hitler was running the border over. So it became\nextremely crowded. Now, in that Theresienstadt, the first x months, I can\u2019t tell you\nhow many months, but I was assigned to distribute coal, because I was working in\nthe coal firm, so I was assigned to a coal job. What was the job? Well, all these\npeople who were living in these places, they were assigned boxes, with the two\nhandles here, two handles over there, and that you had to fill this \u2014 this up with coal,\nand they took it in wherever they were staying. The houses were condr \u2014 houses \u2014\nth-they were n-not houses like \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you know, when \u2014 shacks. But that was converted so that some people could\nhave \u2014 like there is mostly men, or mostly women, and they needed heat, so they\nwere getting the coal. So, at one point, the \u2014 you know, when \u2014 when the coal\nnormally was sold, or delivered, there used to be a little hut with a scale outside. So,\nbecause of my coal co-connections, I was given the use of that thing. So Georgine\nmoved back in with me, in that \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 hut, they call it. In the \u2014 in the public [indecipherable]",
        "A: [had my private scale. But like I say, it was awful, but 1t was wonderful to what\nhas happened. So, in September \u2014",

        "A: Slice this, you know, then that \u2014 that they \u2014 look, we used to go to play cards\nwith that friend of mine, who was, of course, Catholic. He was my \u2014 playing soccer,\nI was the right wing, he was playing next to me, whatever we used to call it. So we\nwere friends. So we used to go to \u2014 they were living very close to where I was\nliving, when we talk about park.",
        "A: So, in the evening, whatever during the day, he was working, I was working. So\nduring the evening, we went to see, in his home, such an old house, I remember like\ntoday. And we were playing cards, you know, killing the evening. There was no\ntelevision, of course, you know, in those days. So we played cards. The mother\ndivorced \u2014 his mother. And me \u2014 and wa \u2014 she was dating somebody who was\nGerman. But he was very \u2014 you know, not every German was a Nazi at that point.",
        "A: But, they deteriorated. Then it came that we could not stay longer than eight\no\u2019clock, we had to be home. So we had to go from his house to my house, to go\nhome, because you didn\u2019t like to take a chance if somebody would catch you on the\nstreet. So it gradually became worse and worse and worse, you know? And then, all\nof a sudden, you couldn\u2019t see him any more, because he was afraid if he was \u2014 if\nsomebody will see him with a Jew \u2014",

So the same was with Auschwitz, you know, when you \u2014 when you don\u2019t\nknow, and you are confronted with these unknown things, what happened? So,\ncoming back to Theresienstadt, they got there in March \u201943. And from March \u00b043\nto September \u00b044, everything was Theresienstadt, okay?May 4, 2013",

        "A: \u2014 to September \u201944. What happened September \u00b044? September 28 is a Czech\nholiday. So we were told that we have to build a new camp, always the new camp. I\nMay 4, 2013\ndon\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t \u2014 what I don\u2019t know, I'll tell you. I don\u2019t remember if it was 500, or\n5,000 \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 or anything in between, men. So, we were assembled, and we had to \u2014 we had\nto go to these open boxcars, which were full of coal that had to be taken out, the\ncoal, and we had to go in. Then they took off March \u2014 September 28, eastward.\nNow, we knew that the American allied soldiers were coming westward, but they\ndidn\u2019t get far enough for us to get out, whatever. So when the train was full of\npeople, open boxcars, well, you know what people do, you know. People have to go\nto the bathroom, there is no food. I have to interject here something, because my\nfriend out on Long Island, he always says, well, what about food? And I always tell\nhim, Fernando, there were no dining cars, you know. But there\u2019s something else. So\nafter we were traveling east \u2014 northeast, there was somebody, as I remember it like\ntoday, in a stripe \u2014 remember, Theresienstadt, we had our clothes. So that was also,\nyou know, where you put it, and all that stuff. So there was always a shortage of\nspace, and you intermingled stuff, and it wa \u2014 it was really a source of trouble. But\nwhen we were traveling east, there was a guy in str-striped uniform. And we get out\nof those boxcars, where are you from? Because we wanted to know what camp is heMay 4, 2013\nfrom. And he said Auschwitz. Now that didn\u2019t \u2014 that\u2019s like if you would say\nsomething.",
        "A: Didn\u2019t mean a thing. Well, we continued traveling for I don\u2019t know how many\ndays. And finally we got in to something which we \u2014 was called Auschwitz. But\nyou know, again, the Germans, what they did, they tried to intimidate you right from\nthe first moment you entered this whole area. The train didn\u2019t s-stop, yes, but not\nthat everybody had to get out of the train. It took, I think, two days before they\nfinally set everybody out of those boxcars, and get out. And the train was going\naround, around, and you had no idea, because there were no signs. You didn\u2019t know\nhow \u2014 where \u2014 how come that we go around. Nobody was there to tell you anything,\nof course. So finally when we came to a stop, which was like, I would say, the\ncouple of days after, October first, second, I don\u2019t know for sure. Well, we to get\nout, you know, orders in German. And my \u2014 we were together, her father, the two\nuncles, the two doctors, and also some other relatives from her mother\u2019s side.",
        "A: No, no, no, no.",
        "A: Her father-in-law. Was only men.May 4, 2013",
        "A: So, well, we had to get out, and then you were confronted by that top German\nguy who was \u2014 welcoming you, whatever. And he \u2014 my father-in-law, he was saying\nthat he\u2019s a \u2014 he was not old, but in his mind, he was old. He was only 50 years, fif \u2014\nexactly 50 years, but you know, he lost his house, he lost his business, and\neverything else. So he felt he\u2019s old. So he was telling him in German that he\u2019s an old\nman. So he had to go this way. Well, the two brothers, the doctors, me and someone,\nthis way. Well, once you are split, you try to find out what happened to the people\nwho are the other way.",
        "A: Well, they to \u2014 they told you here is gas chambers, crematoriums, and the only\nway out of here is through the chimney, you know. So, if you find out what\nhappened to him, and well, then we were in Auschwitz. First the shoes had to be\ndisinfected, so they put it into water. Well, this was intimidation, you know? So now\nyou had shoes wet, icy cold. Auschwitz is in a very cold area of southern Poland,\nstanding in those freezing temperatures, wet shoes, no coats, no nothing. They give\nyou pants, but those pants are like, you know, his pants were, if he \u2014 I don\u2019t mean\nyour pants what you have on, but me that would be obviously, you know.",
        "A: But then you were assigned to a barrack. Those were stables for the Polish armed\nforces horses. Don\u2019t forget the time is still horses. So, if you had to have equipment,\nhorses had to pull it, not a car. Gasoline was very difficult. So the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the\nstables they had, seven floors, of course. And they were contructions(ph) for the\nhorses, but contructions(ph). The size was just about like the table. Not high, I\ndon\u2019t mean that, the s \u2014 the size. And that was on the floor, and the edges were a\nlittle higher. So think of it as on the floor, but the end was a little higher.",
        "A: Why was the end higher? Because the people had to put o-oats into that\ncontraption, so the oats were not all over.",
        "A: Then the horses ate the oats, or whatever else they were eating. Now for us, the\nheight was good because we put our head on it. There were no beds, like at\nTheresienstadt we had bed \u2014 we had beds, we had bunks, but that was still \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 regular \u2014 you know. So that was \u2014 th-that stuff on the floor, cold as 1t was, you\nknow. It was awful, awful. So one of \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the uncles \u2014May 4, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 of Georgine, doctor.",
        "A: He said, we don\u2019t stay here. Well, that\u2019s easier said than done.",
        "A: Naturally. So he was \u2014 he came up with this story that if they do nothing, they\nwill not survive, because the cold weather, the food, no food, nothing. So he said\nthat the best will be for us to say that we are locksmiths. And I always say that\u2019s the\nonly lie I lied in my life, because I said I\u2019m a locksmith. So we s \u2014 but he figured\nthat if we say we would be locksmiths, that they would send us into some kind of a\nfactory, and it would be inside, rather than somewhere outside, digging roads, or\nsomething.",
        "A: Well, he was right. They were always \u2014 they were always counting how many are\nalive, and all that stuff, in Auschwitz.",
        "A: Ire \u2014 don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Of \u2014 of course, old people, we used, of course [indecipherable]. Of course, the\nold people were dying, but they were buried.",
        "A: Sure. And I think they started with Auschwitz from Theresienstadt, because I\nthink really the Germans were concerned that maybe some disease, or some uprising\nmight happen, you know, over the multitude of people, you know, and now, of\ncourse, they had th \u2014 they had the weapons, we had nothing, of course.",
        "A: But they would have to shoot.",
        "A: All that blood, and all that mess which would probably happen. So they started\nwith the deportation out of Theresienstadt, you know? I think that was the main\nreason, apart from getting rid of the Jewish population.",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: We left Georgine and her mother behind. They followed, because that \u2014 the\nexcuse was, you want to follow your husbands, your brothers, you can go tomorrow.\nSo three days later, she went with her mother, the same way. Of course, she never\nsaw her mother again, because again, the age, you know. But Georgine was shipped\nto a Russian camp from Auschwitz.",
        "A: She was called \u2014 it was called Gross-Rosen.",
        "A: That\u2019s where she stayed until the end of the war. But she was always sick, you\nknow, women are very different, in case you don\u2019t know. The women body is a very\ndifferent body than a man\u2019s body, so she \u2014 she came back, she was sick from day\none. Of course, she came back to Prague, where I was, you know, first thing\nhospital. She had to be put back into a normal stage, which she wasn\u2019t.",
        "A: But Auschwitz, you know, then we were locksmiths.",
        "A: You remember, my name was Pekarek?",
        "A: So, at one time, we had to, again, assemble to go \u2014 there was no travel agent, you\nknow, they told you have to get out of the thing, and you were standing there, then\nthey told you will be transported someplace, so the tr \u2014 they call the names. Now,\nlots of people changed their names, not legally. Why? Because they were afraid in\ncase they would be punished or beaten up, or whatever. They might have\nramification to the family somewhere else.",
        "A: So, lots of young men changed the name from A to B, or B to C. I didn\u2019t change\nmine, I was still Pekarek. And \u2014 but the \u2014 the transportation, the first transportation\nstopped at K, and because I was Pekarek, they were F, Feldmans \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 they left, and I stayed behind. Because there were only so many empty on the\ntrain \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 to go wherever. So, we met only after the war with those people again. They\nsurvived, and I survived, as a locksmith, but not in the same place. Reasonably, you\nwould say like I was in Muncie, and they were in Poborno(ph), or something like\nthat.",
        "A: Of course, you couldn\u2019t travel freely, that was out of question. But I cus \u2014 I\nstayed behind, unfortunately, and because I stayed behind, you always have to do\nsomething what they told you to do. So for maybe about a month, or six weeks or so,\nI had to \u2014 I was assigned to a group which was taking out the dead bodies from the\ngas chambers, which had to be taken to the crematorium. You didn\u2019t like to leave\ndead bodies in the gas chambers, you had to go to the crematorium and burn them.\nAnd then, you know, th-the ashes was nothing. So the \u2014 the transportation took place\non a\u2014I don\u2019t know how you would call it, it had two Vs on each side, and a piece of\nwood was like this, you know? We were not so strong, I can\u2019t tell you how many we\nhad to push always to get to the gas chambers. Take the bodies out, put them on that\nstretcher [indecipherable] and transport them to the crematorium. Well, that went\non for some time, I would say maybe about a couple of \u2014 maybe about a month or\nSO.",
        "A: Well, sweetheart, that was life at that time. Then \u2014 then he finished, and the\ntransportations then again, was through that \u2014 where I was, as a locksmith. If you\nhave a huge map of Germany, you probably found town one in \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 on the map. It was called Meuselwitz. Very close to where Uncle Bert was\nwith his brother, but not in Mosul, it\u2019s a very different place. And you were working\nthere from six to six.",
        "A: What I did after that?",
        "A: What I was doing \u2014 it was a huge machine. We were producing casings for the\nGerman navy. You had a machine you p-put \u2014 remember, I was a locksmith, so you\npressed it, the thing was about this big \u2014 not that \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you know, maybe bigger, but narrower. And you had a bucket, and that \u2014 you\nhad to fill up the bucket. I can\u2019t tell you how many buckets a day, or whatever, from\nsix to six. Well, then you went back to where you were supposed to be housed, but it\nwas temporary shelter, really. Was no bed. Was just one thing big from there to\nhear, and today you slept here, tomorrow you slept there. Boys or old men only. And\nin the morning you did the same thing. Six to six. And I have to tell you how I got\nout, because really that was what people always say, well, who \u2014 who \u2014 who\nliberated you. And I have to say, I was not liberated in that sense. Remember what IMay 4, 2013\nwas telling you is the truth. The only not truth is locksmith. So, w-we came back,\nwha-whatever the date was. April 7.",
        "A: To \u2014 where we were sleeping.",
        "A: From the factory \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 they took us back to where we were sleeping.",
        "A: But instead of sleeping, we had to empty a tray of briquettes. You know what\nbriquettes are? Briquettes are about this big. So we had to empty that tray from the\nbriquettes. Well, then \u2014 then that [indecipherable] the tables, and they threw the\nbriquettes, they chased us in. So again, you know, you are in a train, like my friend\nalways, what about food, what about food? First of all, we were already dehydrated,\nthe body was stopped, like you sitting here \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 or I\u2019m sitting here. I don\u2019t know how many pounds we had, but food was not\nreally the item which bothered you, so to speak. So then she starts back into theMay 4, 2013\ntrain, and the train took off east, just like from Theresienstadt east, this time from\nMeuselwitz, Germany, east. Away from those upcoming American soldiers.",
        "A: No, I was there longer than that. I got to \u2014 in Auschwitz in September 28, so we\ngot there like, I would say, October first.",
        "A: And out of Auschwitz, somewhere around Christmastime.",
        "A: So I would say about three months.",
        "A: And then from Christmas to the quote, liberation where I\u2019m trying to tell you \u2014",
        "A: \u20141n Meuselwitz.",
        "A: Now the Meuselwitz didn\u2019t have any accommodation, like I just said \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it was \u2014 you know why? Because the German people, they were very all \u2014\neither on the east front, or west front, and they needed the manpower, so they were\n74May 4, 2013\ninterested in producing it. Anyway, so when the order came to get inside those\nboxcars east \u2014 but you have to realize, that was not Germany of the 1940s, that was\nGermany of a defeated country. The railroads were ripped up from the bombing of\nthe United States. So the transportation wasn\u2019t like that you hop in here and you\nwind up there, no. It was very difficult. Not for u\u2014 I mean, we were just prisoners,\nand we had to do whatever we were told, but it was not so easy for them either. So\nwe were traveling for two days, eastward. Then we came to a place in Germany, or\nmaybe western Poland, or something. Next to us was a train with German soldiers.\nThey were heading west, we were heading east. It\u2019s like that, okay. I was like this,\nthey were on this side. So my particular boxcar, we were told to get out of the\nboxcar so that they could count how we are still in the boxcar are living, because\nsome people are die out of hydration, age, malnutrition, sickness. So they always\ncounting. So while we were standing alongside our railroad car, next to us was a\nGerman car, right? I mean, the British bombers came by, and they started to dive,\nand started to shoot. Now, you know when you are up there and you starting to\nshoot, you don\u2019t shoot like this, you shoot like this, you know? So that you kill as\nmany opponents you can kill. So there was a panic at that moment. We were out of\nthe car. So, we \u2014 wi \u2014 wi [indecipherable] if you want to call it free. That\u2019s not the\nright word, but no supervision at that moment. So that was a hill, and I always call itMay 4, 2013\nthe same like here. You know, you have a hill behind you, and you had to run up the\nhill, because you wanted to get away from the shooting. So we were \u2014 remember, I\nwas \u2014 1945, I was what, 24 years. So, you had the different stamina to run than you\nwould have now that I\u2019m 91. So we were running up. When I say we, there was\nalways somebody who was closer to you. I remember one guy, his name, but I don\u2019t\nremember the other two who were running, Czechs, with us.",
        "A: So we got up on top of the hill. Now we were realizing that we didn\u2019t have any\nGerman guard watching us, right? We were free. Free, without any passport, without\nany papers, striped uniform. So free is a different thing for free. And that \u2014 and the\ntrain, which I told you, the British bombers started to bomb. Eventually they hit the\ntrain. So there was a tremendous commotion. But we wound up on the top of the\nhill. So that \u2014 what are we going to do? Are we going to stay here, get organized, or\ngoing back, or whatever. So we decided four of us, cold as it was, that we will stay\novernight, and then we will think what we do the nec \u2014 next day. So we decided one\nday to stay up on the hill, and maybe two nights, I don\u2019t remember for sure any\nmore. But we decided to go back, because we thought, we had no papers, we had\nnothing. Where are we going to go? Not that we had anywhere to go down there, but\nat least we were not fugitives from \u2014May 4, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 where we were. So we went down the hill, and as we were coming down the\nhill, believe it or not, our train took off. So we \u2014 we really lost the train. The\nprisoners who were still there. We took only about one car, which was where we\nwere. The rest was still inside. So, we left the train \u2014 so we, when we saw the train\nmoving, we ducked a little, to be sure that they don\u2019t start shooting. And they left,\nand we went back to the hill. So we were on that hill [indecipherable] Fernando\nwill buy the food. I said, oh Fernando, there was no food, there was no service,\nthat\u2019s for sure. But anyhow, we went back to the hill, and we stayed there another\ntwo days.",
        "A: Thinking where to go, how to go, what excuse.",
        "A: You know, the roads were all occupied by what we have here, National Guard, or\nwhat do we call it here?",
        "A: So we knew once we get down, that we will be confronted. The only thing, we\nspoke very well German, and we came up with a story that we will say we were\n77May 4, 2013\nCzech workers on the train, apart from prisoners from Auschwitz. So, we were\ndifferent. We thought we are different from \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and that our papers, in that commotion, we lost our stuff which we had, and that\nwould have shown that we are Czech workers. So finally we decided we take a\nchance, we have to do it, because we don\u2019t live indefinitely on top of the hill. So we\nwent down, a short enough distance, like you would say, maybe further down,\nmaybe [indecipherable]. Sure enough, there was a station, this we \u2014 soldiers with \u2014\nthree, four soldiers with guns. So we put our hands up right away, that they don\u2019t\nstart shooting. That\u2019s the approach, then w-we told them exactly what I\u2019m telling\nyou, that we were Czech workers, on work in Germany, in that factory where we\nwere, and that our clothes was damaged in that attack, and that\u2019s what we saved, is\nwhat we have on. Well, you have \u2014 you have to put you into jail, you have to see the\nmagistrate the next day. So we were now in \u2014 in a regular jail. Well, if you have a\nbrain injury \u2014 and I hope not [indecipherable] but it was the first time a regular jail.\nThere was discarded clothes. So, what we did, we took, instead of our prison\nclothes, we took the discarded clothes which was left there by whoever. So when\nthis local magistrate, the next morning, we had ill-fitted clothes, but it was not \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 striped. The story was that we are Czech workers, that we were \u2014 of course, we\nspoke German, that we were caught on the train, which was bombed by the British\nand we got \u2014 you know, we were trying to get somewhere, out of, you know, where\nwe were. Now, the most unexpected thing happen. The magistrate said that, you\nsuffered enough, You are free to go wherever you want to go.",
        "A: Well \u2014 well, he let us go. So we were free. So then, coming back to Prague, how\ndo you get back?",
        "A: No, we had nothing.",
        "A: Yes, well, we were not stopped, you know, the situation was like here after 9/11.\nYou know, it was not \u2014 it was not so rigid any more, you know.",
        "A: I-It was halted, you know.",
        "A: Now, I would like to also tell you at this point that the cars which existed, which\nwere allowed to travel, didn\u2019t use gasoline. What they did \u2014 the Germans are very\ninventive. The \u2014 the cars which were allowed to take what I am telling you, they hadMay 4, 2013\nto cut out the passenger seat. The driver, was a driver, but the passenger seat was\ntaken out, and they put in something like you would say, a contraption, with wooden\nchips. And the wooden chips had to be put on fire, and they produce a little bit of\nsteam, and the steam produce the car to go. So when we tried to get to Prague hi \u2014\nnot hijacking, ja \u2014 jack \u2014 how you call it here, when you \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 hitchhi \u2014 hitchhiking. So we tried to get to Prague hitchhiking, because we\nhave, of course, no money, no paper, no nothing, four of us. So, a truck, which was\nsomething I remember like today, like a pickup truck, he stopped. Where do you\nwant to go? Of course we said Prague, and he said he goes to Prague, too, but his\ntruck \u2014 where we were was a very hilly country. So he said, most likely the truck\nwill not make it, you will have to get out, and have to push the thing to get over the",
        "A: So we took seven days to get back to Prague, because he had only that thing on\nthe side, producing the \u2014 the s \u2014 the steam. But we got to Prague April 20\", Hitler\u2019s\nbirthday, and they were still celebrating. That\u2019s it.",
        "A: It\u2019s the truth.May 4, 2013",
        "A: Well, her sister was in the place where we thought we will meet. So since we\ndidn\u2019t eat anything since that in \u2014 you know that in \u2014 that left, April seventh, April\n20, 13 days.",
        "A: Who should have given me some? So she gave us \u2014 I remember like today, tea.\nWell, I said [indecipherable] something else. And shower, bathroom, because we\nhad lice. If you know what lice does, you know, they crawl all over you. So,\nnaturally she was afraid that we bring the lice into her home. So first was the\nbathroom, you know, staying there because how many hours, to kill the lice. And\nthen a cup of tea. But you couldn\u2019t get out of that house, because we didn\u2019t have any\npapers, so we were afraid if you get \u2014 we \u2014 I was afraid, if you get out, you know,\nthat somebody could stop us. And then what? Don\u2019t forget the hair \u2014 th-the hair, you\nknow. But during the camp, they shore it, so people knew that you are from\nsomewhere else. So we stayed inside until May five. And quote famous Czech\nrevolution started May five. Ended May nine, was horrible. Because people take\nvendettas, you know. Because you did this to my family, I did this to you, you\nknow. Was very, very, very, very bad, very bad.",
        "A: People, you know, people found out where the Germans were hiding, and they\nkilled them, of course. But if they would have killed them with one shot, is one\nthing, but that was not the case, it was awful. Those are the unfortunate results of\nwar, you know? The people who depress people, you know, that comes out. But\nthen, April \u2014 May nine, it stopped. The nation came back to order. There was police,\nreal police, you know. So gradually things get to order, and I \u2014 and I have to again\nsay the French, they were having all kinds of ways to reunite families. Don\u2019t forget,\nyou didn\u2019t know where \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Georgine, didn\u2019t know where she was, of course not. But they had s \u2014 like we\nhave here \u2014 not here, in New York City \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 stands where you could have both newspapers. So those places, they hung up\nsigns that you\u2019re looking for somebody last seen in this camp, in September, or\nsomething, you know, that he should report to this and this address, and stuff like\nthat. So it took a little while to get it back into order. But those who survived, well,\nthey had some arrangements, you know, like I told you about these two doctors.\nThey all were supposed to meet in her sister\u2019s house, and they did, one at a time.May 4, 2013\nWell, once they came back, you know, then \u2014 then, who survived, who didn\u2019t\nsurvive.",
        "A: There\u2019s not much else I can add to it.",
        "A: Somehow \u2014 I don\u2019t know how I got the apartment, whether it was given to me,\nwhether I could occupy it without a lease, or whatever, I don\u2019t remember. I had an\napartment the old section of Prague, new building. No elevator, but it was on the\nsecond floor. I don\u2019t remember whether I \u2014 I don\u2019t know how I maintained it, I\ndidn\u2019t have any money. But eventually I got the job, you know, the one \u2014 the one\nJewish friend, one of them came back. Naturally, demanded his firm to be getting\nback. And eventually I started to work for him.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s just about it.",

        "A: No, that was a residential neighborhood, yes.",
        "A: Yeah, it was very nice, and again, you know, when \u2014 when these deportations\nstarted, you always said well, you have to be somewhere, then you come back.\nNobody ever thought that you will not come back.",
        "A: So yes, you \u2014 you will come back, and you should have someplace where you\nwill quote, meet.",
        "A: She was married to a non-Jew, but that actually it was a surprise that she\nsomehow managed not to be involved, because that was not an excuse. She was\nJewish, so under normal circumstances of that time, she would have had the sameMay 4, 2013\ndifficulties. But for some strange reason, nobody knew. The neighbors, of course,\nCzech. She married somebody by the name of Krejcik(ph).",
        "A: Now Krejeik(ph) is like a small tailor, in English. So the name was, of course,\nCzech, and she was married to him for quite a while. Well, they would have been ol-\nolder than we, but I remember him, and she came here couple of times, we have a\npicture, we have a \u2014 which I mentioned to you, a swimming pool.",
        "A: It is covered, you don\u2019t see it, you can only see the \u2014",
        "A: The \u2014 the layout. But there were quite a few, somehow, survivors. Well, not just\nsurvivors, people who were born here. I told you about this uncle who was living in\n\u2014 in Ecuador \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 so that\u2019s 1\u2014 from this side the world. The picture shows quite a few people, you\nknow?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, yes.\nMay 4, 2013",
        "A: Even without the hair. I mean, now I have normally no hair, but at the time it was\nshort cut \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you know, and \u2014 and the language, you hear the same voice, and yes. So I had\nno problem with that part, no. And specially the bathroom. Now, you know, these\nare human, so when you go to the bathroom, you know what happen. You have to\nclean yourself, and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 wash up yourself. There\u2019s something which didn\u2019t exist in Australia \u2014 ah, in\nAustralia, in \u2014 in \u2014 in Auschwitz. There were no bathrooms, you know, there was a\npiece of wood, and you had to sit down and do what you did, and there was no\nwater. So you really \u2014 you personal esteem, or hygiene, or whatever you want to call\nit, was absolutely nonexistent, you know. Just think of it, what she was talking\nabout, that underwear. Well you, when you are in that kind of a cold weather, and\nyou are not properly dressed, your nose is running con-constantly. So, at one time\nthey were, probably as a make you feel miserable, or whatever, out of that prayer\nshawl, they made shorts. So \u2014 which I started to tell you earlier. Somehow, when\nthey were throwing out those shorts, I must have caught two, maybe they were\nMay 4, 2013\nsomehow intertwined. So one I put on, and the other one I tore to pieces, and this\nUncle Fred and Uncle Bert, of course I gave them piece of that material, so they\ncould wipe their nose, just like I could wipe my \u2014 but Uncle Fred, who was living in\nMunnsville, upstate New York, after \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the [indecipherable], he always said in his Czech language, I will never forget\nit; if I remember a present, you gave us that piece of cloth to wipe our \u2014 and that was\nhere, not there. He never forgot that. And he was treating John. John went, at that\ntime, to Colgate University, undergraduate school, and we used to get \u2014 get up there\nto visit Uncle Fred, with his wife, and John was there, so \u2014 it was not so far from\nhere, anyhow.",
        "A: It was far, but not that far that you could not make it, you know, so \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 we \u2014 we saw them, occasionally. But all these people were older than we both\nwere, so eventually we are just by ourselves. You know, my age, Georgine\u2019s not\nthat far behind \u2014\nMay 4, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 you know. So uncles, they were \u2014 they were born 1904 - 1910. [technical\ninterruption, break]",
        "A: A piece of un-underwear.",
        "A: Nose.",
        "A: Oh sure, sure.",
        "A: Thirty-nine to 42.",
        "A: Three years.",
        "A: Yes.May 4, 2013",
        "A: Well, of course I remember the name, H-Heydrich, of course. Well, one\nexperience comes right to your mind. When he was killed, and they were looking\naround for those parti-partisans, they used to call them, who they suspected killed\nhim, well, we were living in an apartment \u2014 we were married, of course, and we\nwere living in an apartment which was assigned to us, because the parents had to\nmove out of the house where they were \u2014 lived. And they were assigned to another\nJewish family, which was, as soon as you remember Prague a little bit, near the\nCharles bridge.",
        "A: So we were living in that neighborhood, and I do \u2014 I don\u2019t know what I was\ndoing, but most likely working for the Jewish organization \u2014 I shouldn\u2019t call it that\nway, but that\u2019s the way it was.",
        "A: Jewish authority would be a better word.",
        "A: And I remember we were, of course, sleeping, and all of a sudden somebody\nburst into that room \u2014 I don\u2019t know if they were soldiers, or SS soldiers, that I don\u2019t\nremember, but they were moving the furniture, which was not ours, which was, we\nhad the furnished room. They were looking for some hidden escape routes which\nthese partisans might have taken. That was the middle of the night, whether it was\n10 - 12, that I don\u2019t remember, but I remember very well when they came.\nNaturally, we were scared to death in bed, sleeping and all of a sudden somebody is\nthere with weapons, and go \u2014 moving the furniture to see whether it\u2019s a hidden\nstaircase to go somewhere where that person might have been hiding.",
        "A: But ultimately, of course, they didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t find anything, they left. But it was\nvery difficult. The \u2014 the conditions became worse. I don\u2019t mean living conditions\nlike eating, no. It was more the freedom of moving around, yes. Because you were\nsupposed to have the yellow star, and if they caught you without wearing it, without\nhaving the documents which a non-Jew had to produce, you \u2014 it was punishable.\nAnd the office which I was working at, was just across from the headquarter of the\nGestapo. So we had the \u2014 I have seen many things which normally people would not\nhave seen, you know, that \u2014",
        "A: Well, the trucks with the prisoners, and the mistreating of prisoners getting into\nthe building, and all this stuff. Was awful. That building was originally a bank, and\nit was owned by a Jewish person. The name was called \u2014 like you have here\nCitibank, so that was called the Petschek bank. And he was known, you know, like\nyou know here Rockefeller, so he was known there as Petschek the banker, you\nknow. But what you have seen, yes, e-every 12 o\u2019clock, a new guard came to\nreplace the guard from the day before. So you have seen the power, the might what\nthey had at that time. The streets were \u2014 that particular location was at, that had all\nAmerican presidents there. It was a Hoover Street, it was a Wilson Street, and there\nwere more of them. So why they hurried there, I don\u2019t know, but that was that bank\nwhich they used for the Gestapo, you know.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Vlasov\u2019s ginanisty(ph), you are absolutely right. Vlasov\u2019s ginanisty(ph), it goes\nthis way \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and that\u2019s three-four \u2014 the parallel, yes, yes.May 4, 2013",
        "A: It was parallel.",
        "A: And that\u2019s \u2014 that section of Prague had all these American presidents\u2019 name,\nprobably just to show gratitude that they made \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 established the Czech Republic, or Czechoslovakia at that time, you know.\nBut wi \u2014 again, the life was, before the Nazis came, that was \u2014 we had the same\nfreedom like here. There was no religious discrimination of any kind. If you were\nJewish, you went to a Jewish temple, if you were Catholic, you went to a Catholic \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 church, or wherever you went. That has changed. People became more \u2014 well,\nmaybe afraid. Maybe that some of the true feeling also might have come out, you\nnever know.",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh we \u2014 we knew, oh to sh \u2014 how can you not know?\nHeydrich was \u2014 you know, we had something called I-a-n-y, Lany. Lany was like\nwe have here in the United States, Camp David.",
        "A: You see, when the president wants to relax, we \u2014 whichever president, they don\u2019t\ngo into politics, you went to Camp David because that was the summer, or the\nrelaxation for the existing president. So we had that Castle Lany. And Heydrich\nwas known that he travels between Lany and Prague, because he wanted to enjoy\nthe same thing like \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the president enjoyed that Lany, you know, the castle which was there. But\nsomehow those partisans which were dropped by the British, they found out his\nroute, and eventually, naturally, killed him by \u2014 I don\u2019t exactly remember any more.\nThe car was passing, and somehow exploded, or whatever. But it was big\nrepercussions, yeah, because he was really the right hand of Hitler. So when they\nkilled the right hand of Hitler, you know, they wanted to show \u2014 and you know,\nthey traced it back \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you heard that story, they tri \u2014 they traced it\nback that those partisans were staying, or were dropped off in a town called Lidice.\nAnd out of sympathy, naturally, here in the United States, in Chicago, there is aMay 4, 2013\nsuburb called Lidice. Now, I don\u2019t know if they have changed it since then, or\nwhatever, but there\u2019s a strong Czech community in Chicago, and they wanted to\nshow that somehow the \u2014 the west stands with that particular event. But, of \u2014 of\ncourse I remember it, and there were pictures of Heydrich left and right. He was the\nright hand of Hitler, no doubt about it.",
        "A: No, we had aft \u2014 well, they were looking for the n \u2014 you know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and even if they knew the \u2014 that \u2014 that the people are God knows where, or\nmaybe they were even killed, or whate \u2014 they wanted to show the power they had,\nand to im \u2014 intimidate everybody else.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember exactly what would have happened afterwards, except that they\ntook all these men, people \u2014 and not only men, boys \u2014 from the town of Lidice, and\nthey burned it down. Females had \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether they took the females, but\nit was awful, awful. And that kind of event warns the rest of the people, you know,\nthey \u2014 they say the non-Jews were afraid to \u2014\nMay 4, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 you know, talk with Jews, and \u2014 and the fear was spread all over. So it\u2019s not\nlike th-the people were against you. No, I told you, my best friend, he was playing\nsoccer with me. Who cares whether he was Jewish or Catholic, or whatever. But the\nfear was there. So, out of fear, there was a certain \u2014 call it segregation.",
        "A: And \u2014 and it was imposed by \u2014 by the system, you know.",
        "A: Well, I told you, somehow \u2014 I don\u2019t know how I got the apartment, because there\nwere also Germans who were thrown awa \u2014 not thrown away, but they made them\ngo back to Germany, or whatever. So I don\u2019t know how I got the apartment.\nCertainly didn\u2019t pay for it, I had no money, I was a kid. Was it allotted to me by\nsomeone? I don\u2019t remember that part. I know I stayed with Georgine until \u2014 and\nthen her aunt, the one they were talking about, the close, she came to visit us when\nshe was expecting George, the one who is a doctor near Washington, D.C. She was\nexpecting him, and that was the first time she came to Prague and the first time they\nmet her, so to speak.",
        "A: Well, Georgine, I don\u2019t know how she came back, physically, but I think, which\nI mentioned to you, the French were trying desperately to put people together.",
        "A: Now, if you think who paid for it, definitely nobody. That was the government\u2019s\nsomehow obligation, or whatever. Georgine was sick, and I remember very\ndistinctly, when she came, there were two of her good, best friends who really made\nher survive. Did I remember the name? One was, I think, Ruth but they call her\nChekruthka(ph), and I forgot the second one. But they were not from Prague, so\nthey stayed in Prague for a couple of days before they got the connection to\nwherever they going. One was through Moravia \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 which was the other state of Czechoslovakia. And I think they lost, you know,\nlike always you lost track of each other, because people have different interests, and\nGeorgine, she needed surgeries. She developed a thyroid condition. The thyroid 1s\nnot only that it takes away your breathing, but also she developed a\n[indecipherable] on the \u2014 on this side. That would be her left side, I think it was. So\nshe had to have that taken out. It was not taken out in Czechoslovakia, but she was\ntreated from it. Always the truth, 1t was taken out when we came here, in New York\nCity. Not at the hospital, there used to be small op \u2014 small practices. That was doneMay 4, 2013\non Park Avenue. Don\u2019t hold me to it, but I remember it was on 83\" Street, I think,\nbetween Park and Madison, closer to Park. And it had to be taken out, because the\ndoctor said here that she would \u2014 she would have difficulties. Now, come to think of\nit, why was it not done in Australia? She had it in Australia. But, you know,\nAustralia of 19 \u2014 when we got there, 1949, was a different Australia than 2013.",
        "A: They were very backwards. Not because they were dumb or something, it was the\nlocation. They were so far away from anything, that 1-1t \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it was \u2014 it was a different Australia. That\u2019s why we also changed the name,\nbecause when I said my name is Pekarek, it was like talking to, you know, God\nknows what. So 1-it was \u2014 it was very difficult. Then, since she was here, she read\nher \u2014 that the treatment here is much more progressive, with nuclear energy.",
        "A: Yeah, please.",
        "A: Yeah, but we had the \u2014 we had the apartment which I told you I got in central\nPrague.May 4, 2013",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t think I remember exactly the first couple of days, not really.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, oh yes, yes.",
        "A: I had the apartment \u2014 you know, I was \u2014 I told you I was in Prague April 20,\nwhen the nat \u2014 when the Germans were still there \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 celebrating Hitler. So, when the \u2014 when \u2014 when the revolution finished at May\nninth \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I somehow, couple days later, I got the apartment, I don\u2019t know how.",
        "A: But she wasn\u2019t there yet, no, she came much later, because she was on the\nRussian side, and they were not so organized bringing the people back, like when\nyou were somewhere on the western side.",
        "A: So eventually she did come back. Now how did she find me? Well, most likely\nthrough her sister.",
        "A: That\u2019s my guessing now \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 70 years later.",
        "A: Do I remember exactly how she found me? No.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The same firm where I used to work before.",
        "A: They claim \u2014 there\u2019s a story to it also, they got it back because that\n[indecipherable] was theirs.May 4, 2013",
        "A: And we \u2014 even if we had the left le \u2014 leaning government, it was theirs, they got\nit back. And \u2014 since they were quite well off, and they had connections to the\nUnited States. How? The original owner was a very old man. He had quite a few\nchildren. In those days, you know, there were not so many precautions not to get\nchildren, or pregnant, or whatever. So he had, I think, five or six of them. And two\nwere living here in the United States very \u2014 before the war started. One was in\nPhiladelphia, and I don\u2019t know where the other one was living. So, they got the\nthing back, but because it was so left-leaning, the whole Czechoslovakia after\nWorld War II, because the Soviet Union, we were your protectors, and the country\nwas really very much to the left, which we didn\u2019t care for. So this firm had\ndifficulties with the labor force, because they were delivering coal, c-o-a-I-l \u2014 you\nknow, coal?",

        "A: But in Prague, coal was the thing to make your morning coffee. So, it was very \u2014\nand horses were the ones which delivered the coal.\n102May 4, 2013",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no.",
        "A: I was the accountant \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 for a company which was selling coal.",
        "A: And the owner was an old man, he had several sons, but two of them worked in\nthe firm. And it was a very successful firm.",
        "A: Yes, yes, that\u2019s what I wanted to tell you.",
        "A: One of \u2014 so when \u2014 when \u2014 when this more left-leaning, more left-wingish. So\neventually \u2014 I don\u2019t remember if this was nationalized or not, those things escape\nme. But Hinnek(ph), he was one of the sons, he wanted to get out, but there wasMay 4, 2013\nnowhere to go. To get a visa permit here was very difficult, and the two\n[indecipherable] of his, well, you know, it\u2019s very difficult to make a living here.\nThinking about millions which they had over there, they didn\u2019t have the millions\nhere. So he had difficulties coming, but I promised him when I went to Australia\nthat I will try to see whether I could get him some documents to get to Australia.\nBelieve it or not, I did manage to help him, and he came to Australia eventually,\nwith his wife, two children, and he was driving a cab, of all things. Quite successful,\nbut naturally money-wise no comparison to what he had been. But I\u2019m pretty sure\nthey must have had some money here, or something.",
        "A: The left-wingish thing. Look, you \u2014 for example, there were elections. You had\nto go with everybody in that firm, and to sing the name of the leader, his name was\nGotwald(ph), and \u2014 and he was the only one who was running. So, having that\nexperience from World War II, we have seen that the country is deteriorating.",
        "A: No, but it was very left-wingish, yes.",
        "A: And I would say not between \u201940 \u2014 between 1945 when we came back \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and 1948, definitely. Only one candidate.",
        "A: If you liked it or not, he was the only one, and naturally he was the communist\nleader. So it was \u2014 it was not hundred percent communistic, but it was getting there.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: There is \u2014 it had nothing true with it. If you \u20141f you were not one of \u2014 for\nexample, look, your kid couldn\u2019t go to school, to a college, if he was from a\nbourgeois \u2014 they call it bourgeois family.",
        "A: Tha-That\u2019s how it was. So when you \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 when your child was born from a bourgeois family, that child couldn\u2019t go to\ncollege.",
        "A: Well, I had no children to begin with, but there was no family left, you know, so I\ndidn\u2019t have that kind of a problem, but you didn\u2019t like it.",
        "A: It smelled too much from controlled leftists. So Nazi \u2014 Hitler was too controlled\nfrom the right side. This was the same damage on the left side.",
        "A: Great.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s a good question. I think my sister survived, and I think she said she\ngave me the date when they were, so to speak, transported from \u2014 from one camp to\nthe \u2014 to Auschwitz.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And when \u2014 once they got to Auschwitz, there was no way that they could have\nsurvived, because my father would have been old, also a little bit on the sick side.\n106\nMay 4, 2013\nHad difficulties with \u2014 not arthritis, I recalling it\u2019s something else. Had difficulties\nwalking, I don\u2019t remember the name, what they used it for. But they were old\npeople, you know, now my father was born \u201978. So when he got to Auschwitz, say\n1944 - \u201945, so he was close to 70, where I\u2019m now 90, but that was a different time.",
        "A: And \u2014 and you see here, you are a free person whether you live until 90 or 105.",
        "A: You know?",
        "A: But that was a controlled society. Jewish on top of it, so when they got there, they\nhad no chance.",
        "A: They had no chance. So my sister knew the date, and she told me. I forgot the\ndate, of course, but she told me when the day came, she couldn\u2019t hold them as a\ndependent any more, and she was the \u2014 and they were deported.",
        "A: And once they were deported to Auschwitz, well that was, of course, the end,\nyou know\u201d?May 4, 2013",
        "A: Exactly. That was the truth.",
        "A: Now see, that I couldn\u2019t take any \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I\u2014I didn\u2019t take any, except that I want to get out with Georgine. And being of\nthat age, military age \u2014 now, for example, when I came back, I had to join the army.\nNot that I wanted, that was a compulsory \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 so for, I don\u2019t remember how many months, I was \u2014 I was within the army\noffice, but still I was in the armed forces",
        "A: And then they passed a law that people who were in a concentration camp, were\nexempt from that service. So I came back to the apartment which I had \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 originally with Georgine. So Georgine came to visit me, how she got there, I\ndon\u2019t know, most likely by bus, because we didn\u2019t have a car. Have a car was aMay 4, 2013\nluxury in those days. So she must have come by bus to visit me, and naturally there\nwas a question of money, because when you are in the military, you don\u2019t make \u2014\nwhat do you make? Nothing. So there were some difficulties. Do I remember what\ndifficulties? Not really. Somehow we made it. You know, maybe some money was\nleft over from the father \u2014 her father. But you know, the \u2014 during that kind of a\nsituation that\u2019s happening here to someb \u2014 not want to touch that that base, but when\npeople \u2014 my father-in-law, when \u2014 when they heard that this one was transported to\nsome camp, and this one \u2014 so, as a precaution, they gave \u2014 they had a housekeeper\nof the house, which was living in the basement, so to speak. So they gave her some\nmoney. How much? No idea. He had a factory. Remember, the time goes back now,\n60 \u2014 70 years. So plastic was a novelty. So, in Czechoslovakia, when you had \u2014\nwhen you bought a drink, let\u2019s say like a Coke. Was not a Coke, like a Coke. So it\nhas a top that you closed, you know, but it was the old-fashioned thing, which was\nvery difficult and maybe not nice looking. So he did a lot, with a partner, plastic \u2014\nyou know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 th-the tops which we today take for granted, you know, and [indecipherable]",
        "A: So it was a novelty, and he was doing extremely well. So he gave his\nhousekeeper X \u2014 no idea how much \u2014 dollar, but you keep it, and then they come\nback \u2014 you know, you give it back to us. Well, there are lots of people who didn\u2019t\ncome back. In that connection, I would like to refer to a story which appeared in\n\u201cThe Wall Street Journal\u2019 not more than maybe two weeks ago, and I gave it to\nElise to read. Why? Because it turned out that New York state, there are unclaimed\ninsurance policies, monies which were left around in banks. In the bill \u2014 b \u2014 in the\nbillions. And the story was that New York state can get this if it stays unclaimed,\nbecause there is a law, if you don\u2019t claim X after so many years, it becomes the\nproperty of the state. So naturally, New York state, I can imagine if they could get a\ncouple of million, perhaps billion, oh my gosh, you know?",
        "A: So that was the story, and I have no doubt, insurance companies, banks, and I\u2019m\ntelling to you out of experience, Georgine knew that her father had the life\ninsurance policy with X \u2014 I forgot the name. So when we came here, we tried to get\nin touch with those people, we found some document showing that he had this, and\nhe had that, and whatever. So the answer which we got, if I would look for it, I\nwould find it. I\u2019m not going to take the time now \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and I will not take the time then either. But they responded that we have to\nproduce a death certificate. Now, to get a death certificate for somebody who passed\naway in Auschwitz, is like \u2014 I don\u2019t have to tell you. So nothing happened. But that\nmeans that that policy was never consummated. So, if he was entitled to those\nbenefits, 10,000 - 100,000, whatever, that was never paid. So really, the unclaimed\namounts which are there, must be in the \u2014 well, I\u2019m telling you, the story was \u2014 they\nmentioned ski \u2014 I think, two billion dollars. Because I\u2019m sure my father-in-law\nwasn\u2019t the only person who did this.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, in Czechoslovakia, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, but there\u2019s \u2014 if the money would have been somehow, say inherited by\nGeorgine, or \u2014 or somehow \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it would have come \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 or maybe to her sister while she was still in the uni \u2014",
        "A: It was never paid, because we could not prove \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 his death. And I\u2019m sure there were cases, God knows how many, because lots\nof people didn\u2019t come back, especially older people, you know, the young people\nmight have survived [indecipherable] about the older people had no chance. So\nwe re \u2014 I\u2019m just telling you what happened in \u201cWall Street Journal,\u201d which I enjoy\nreading, but that\u2019s not the issue. So the situation was \u2014 it was varied. It was not the\nsame Czechoslovakia, like it was when it was founded. No.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: Well, we experienced only that somehow he jumped to his death. That was the\nofficial version. Now, the unofficial version was that they threw him out of the\nwindow.",
        "A: Now, what was true? That depends on what side you are on.\n112May 4, 2013",
        "A: Oh yes. Oh, definitely, because you didn\u2019t know what the other person would do\nto enhance his position, whatever he was doing, he or she, yes. It was not the same\nCzechoslovakia, no. And that is in a way part of what you\u2019re asking me, why didn\u2019t\n\u2014 it was not just this threat from the Soviet Union, we didn\u2019t have anything, so what\nwould I have taken, and we just came back. But it was everything, you know, the\ndistrust of each other. The quality of life wasn\u2019t the same. By far not the same.\nReligion, the religion we didn\u2019t practice a religion anyhow, so that didn\u2019t make any\ndifferent. But the life was not the same, no. You talked to a neighbor, you were\nafraid in case you say something, it might be turned over against you. If you were\nmore on the liberal side, rather than communistic side. If you said you don\u2019t like \u2014\nI\u2019m just saying \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 as an example, if you didn\u2019t like this guy, and he was a prominent, say\npolitician, Prague, or whatever. So 1-it was not the same country, by any mean. But\nit was not the same country for two reasons. Unfortunately, the German occupation\ndid it, and the Russian threat continued during it. So that was not that\n[indecipherable] who were the \u2014 originally the spirit. That was \u2014 was missing, that\nwasn\u2019t there. And specially this aunt of mine, who survived the war in Israel, it was\nnot Israel, it was Palestine. It\u2019s the same thing anyway.May 4, 2013",
        "A: So she didn\u2019t like it, and she was alerting us to these things more than we did,\nbecause we were thrilled that we are free. We were free. So, for us, we didn\u2019t see it.\nBut she s \u2014 she was, like I say, a different oy \u2014 age, from a different country. She\nsaw it differently, you know? The way she was living, I remember certain things,\nthat she was living in Vienna, she married in Vienna. And she came to Prague with\nher husband, and sh \u2014 I can\u2019t tell you the year. Oh, it must have been before \u00b039,\nbefore Hitler came. She was saying that this is a unstoppable wave, that anything\nwhat is somehow German, will become Nazi German. And I think she was right.\nWhy? I told you earlier, because Hitler provided jobs, and even the people who\nwere \u2014 who had nothing to do with it, became pro-Nazi. I like to say Nazi\nGermany, because I don\u2019t blame today\u2019s generation for what happened 50 - 70\nyears ago. Le \u2014 I mean, these people who are today Germans \u2014 I mean, of course\nthey are German, because they were born there, I mean, they questioned their old\ngrandparents. I mean, how could you have not known, or why could you have\ncondoned this, you know? Different from today\u2019s world than it was at the time, but\nwhen I talk about Germany, I usually say Nazi Germany, or Germany.",
        "A: Because I\u2019m getting a pension, small pension, couple hundred dollars. Really, it\u2019s\nnot even worth talking about it. Depends on the exchange rate. So Georgine got for\nthe month of May, 200 dollars, and I got five \u2014 200 dollars, another 500 dollars,\nsomething, you know.",
        "A: So today, in this world, 700 dollars amounts \u2014 is not going to make me rich or\npoor. Yes, it helps me to maintain Georgine, which I told you.",
        "A: But those article, they had nothing to do with the Holocaust. Those articles,\nthey\u2019re like John\u2019s age, or even younger.",
        "A: I mean, why should they [indecipherable] they, through taxation, pay me X\ndollars? Well, I\u2019m looking at it, I\u2019m telling you how I feel about it.",
        "A: Do Ll accept it? I would be crazy not to accept it, but really \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: You don\u2019t understand me? Sweetheart, I told you I like to say the truth, this is a\ntruth.",
        "A: I accept thing, well yes, I accept it, because I was working there and all that\nrubbish did happen. But you \u2014 I\u2019m wondering why this generation stole everything?\nDo they feel any moral guilt? Where \u2014 would I feel moral guilt, what my grandfather\nmight have done? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just asking a civilized question, you know?",
        "A: That\u2019s what you saying [indecipherable] saying that\u2019s how I feel, you know?",
        "A: If they send me the check, yes I take the money, because automatic it\u2019s coming to\nmy account, so I take it, you know. But from a human point of view, from my\npersonal point of view, I wonder how I would feel if I would be in that situation. His\n\u2014 they didn\u2019t cause it. It was the grandfather, or the grand-grandfather. And to \u2014 to\nanalyze what reasons that person had 50 years ago \u2014 you only can [indecipherable]\nto almighty God.",
        "A: Sweetheart, Georgine, she\u2019s my wife for 70 plus years.May 4, 2013",
        "A: I told you that she was there, right here, where we are.",
        "A: Sweetheart, she went through Auschwitz.",
        "A: And anybody who went through Auschwitz, and saw that misery, and had a\nheart, and if sh \u2014 if u\u2014 she was lucky that she didn\u2019t have to work, although when\nthey came here, she did. Remember, she had a British passport, so she was working\nfor the British consulate on Rockefeller Center.",
        "A: How long, I can\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t remember, short while, then she got another job. But\nthat\u2019s not the issue. So she was lucky that she could have stayed home. She stayed\nhome when she became pregnant. Well, that was another reason why she had all that\nsurgery, because they were saying, if you treat it with nuclear energy, she will\nbecome sterile. And as a young woman, you know, you didn\u2019t like that. So she had\nthe surgery rather than the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 treatment, and eventually, just like I said, we were working about two years or\nso, and she became pregnant. We had \u2014 she had a vacation, I had a vacation, and\nwas like summertime, she quit her job. Well, then, you know how it takes, it takes a\nfew months to get to that place. So she was very happy, she was a hundred percent\nmother. And having seen all these children perish in Auschwitz, she devoted her life\nto children. Truth is the truth. So she went when John was six, kindergarten, or\nwhatever that system is here. She started to be on the school board. Not as a teacher,\nshe was never a teacher. And through her persistence, integrity, or interest,\nwhatever, she was on the school board for 32 years.",
        "A: So here, in this country, they s \u2014 in the local school board here, there\u2019s a room\ndedicated to Georgine\u2019s 32 years of being on the school board, giving service to the\nchildren. Now, if we would have time, she has literally hundreds of these things,\nwhat were \u2014 now we have this.",
        "A: So we have all kinds of wooden plaques, testimonials, we had it here hanging.\nWell, you know, they changed.",
        "A: I don\u2019t blame them. This is [indecipherable]. They had here hanging, honorary\ndoctorate. She has a couple of honorary doctorates. What I\u2019m telling you, like I just\ntold you, I am not a person who will make things bigger than they are \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 this is the truth. Where it is now, I don\u2019t know. Elise has a tendency to change\nthings. Which is fine, I\u2019m \u2014 she\u2019s a very hardworking person, and I told you, I like\nall three of them. What happened to it, I don\u2019t know, it was always hanging here. So\nmaybe they put it inside, or something, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Was a proclamation of one university, honorary doctorate in, like they called\nletters, or something? Like writing.",
        "A: Very little.",
        "A: No, no, because she has the same like I went. Luckily, we both came back.",
        "A: At that time we don\u2019t be deported \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: Wa -\u2014 one little thing. We were kids.",
        "A: I married when I was 20. She was 16. We had to have permission from our\nparents.",
        "A: Oh sure.",
        "A: Well, because they knew what\u2019s coming.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: A hundred percent right.",
        "A: That\u2019s the truth.\n120May 4, 2013",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 we changed to a certain extent. She got involved with the schools.",
        "A: And I was ma \u2014 much more, say for going to the Metropolitan Opera. So I \u2014\nfinancial were different. So I bought a subscription for two of us. Naturally, we were\nmarried \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 we were vi \u2014 di\u2014 we used to go, there was a show here on Broadway,\nwhatever it was, not important. So we had tickets, two tickets to go to the\nMetropolitan Opera. But now all of a su\u2014 oh John \u2014 Frank, I won\u2019t be able to\nmake it because I have to see Commissioner so and so from the education\ndepartment. So I had two tickets, I went, and I sold one, or gave it away, or whateverMay 4, 2013\nI did. So that went on for about three years like that, that I had two tickets, very\nseldom we used them.",
        "A: Seldom. But we still had the same interest, we had the same background. We\nknew our parents, her parents, it was the same. She knew my parents, of course. So\nnothing really has changed, really. And proof is what I\u2019m saying is we are \u2014",
        "A: And then \u2014 and \u2014 and financially I told you what it cost. If you multiply by 50,\nand multiplied by five, six years, you don\u2019t talk about 10 dollars.",
        "A: Do [have any regrets? No. I consider this is my responsibility, no.",
        "A: Very little.",
        "A: Well, my \u2014 there was a story in the papers. If you want to read it, we have made\ncopies, that goes back about two, three years. You know what, I tell you something,\nI have to go to my office, and give you a copy.",
        "A: Our life has changed, my life in particular. Because now, I go to eat dinner at\nfour o\u2019clock. I come home when Bibi comes, she comes usually at six, I come\nusually home at 5:15 - 5:30, because it\u2019s only a mile. So I come home. We either\nbring them, or they [indecipherable] or whatever, that\u2019s not the issue. And then she,\nwhen Bibi comes, six o\u2019clock, summertime, wintertime, I go to sleep. And again, I\ntold you, my hours have shifted.",
        "A: I get up at two o\u2019clock, three o\u2019clock.",
        "A: Do I complain? No, I just \u2014 this is fine, this is the life it is, my obligation. She\u2019s\nsick, so either you get [indecipherable] not me [indecipherable] or you do what\nyou have to do. And I feel this is what I have to do. We married, we were kids. My\nresponsibility was the same as it was 50 years ago.",
        "A: Before you go, I give you the story from the newspaper.",
        "A: Free of charge.",

        "A: Well, is what I\u2019m telling you, that we were separated because of Auschwitz.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, about \u2014 well, it was about both of us, but actually it\u2019s more\nabout what I\u2019m doing with \u2014 you know, I was always working.",
        "A: Some of u \u2014 I mean, one of us had to make a living.",
        "A: Oh sure \u2014 oh, from Auschwitz, of course. I was a grown-up man, I was a kid\nwhen I went in. No, no question about it. You understood what life is, what brutality\nis. Don\u2019t forget, there were instances where some prisoners wanted to escape.\nRussian in particular, I have to say the truth. You know, we had to witness when\nthey were literally beaten to death. Why did they ask us to witness this? To\ndiscourage other people from doing it. And that\u2019s pi \u2014 after all these years, I\u2019m still\nseeing it once in a while. When I start thing like now, talking about it. Sure. Was\nawtul. So you have grown up, no question about it. You were a child, you were\ninexpere \u2014 when we came out, we were children. I wanted to buy the house. They\nwere talking about real estate ex \u2014 I had no clue. So this friend \u2014 not friend, she was\n124\nMay 4, 2013\na client of mine, said well, do you have any money? Remember, 3,000 dollars down\npayment. Was a different down \u2014 different time.",
        "A: Yeah. So I said, not really. Sh-She said to me \u2014 I will never forget her, well you\ncan\u2019t just get a mortgage without having some money in the bank. For me that was,\nyou know, a revelation, what is she talking about? So she loaned me 3,000 dollars,\nwhich was 10 percent from what was needed for the down payment. Of course I paid\nher back, this is not the question. But that\u2019s how it was.",
        "A: Well, we didn\u2019t have the normal life. You said the right thing.",
        "A: Well, you know, truthfully, you try to push it away, you know, and you\nconcentrate on what we did together. You know, we went shopping together. She\nwas normal, don\u2019t forget, she was a normal person.",
        "A: So \u2014 not that I\u2019m putting her down or something \u2014\n125May 4, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 I\u2019m just saying the true, we used to go to Lord & Taylor, I remember. When\nwe bought the house, we \u2014 we bought a car. And you just look out the window\nthere\u2019s a tree, stupidly we planted it right next to the house. Well, we went \u2014 I had a\nChevy, and we thought to make it more \u2014 more trees. So we bought a tree which\nwas bigger than this thing here. Well, now it\u2019s 50 years ago, now it\u2019s tremendous,\nyou know. So we were sharing life together. She grew into it, I grew into it, but we\ngrew into it together, not separately. Separately was only the circumstance which \u2014\nwhich made us separate, you know?",
        "A: And that was a story in the paper, you know. I couldn\u2019t get out of\nCzechoslovakia because of that military age. Well, I managed to get that British\npassports, so that was not a pretense of some kind of divorce or separation.",
        "A: It was just to survive. We was just so panicky with survival.",
        "A: And \u2014 and the only way to do it was well, you go first, and somehow I managed\nto get out by myself, because I will take a suitcase and go. But now, if we are two,\nit\u2019s a different thing.\n126\nMay 4, 2013",
        "A: And that\u2019s exactly what happened, so when I f \u2014 got to stay, I told you before,\nshe took the plane and came back. Of course she came back.",
        "A: \u2014 was not some kind of a second marriage, or something.",
        "A: If I would take it back?",
        "A: Oh, add. Well, the only experience I would like to tell you about, when I was\nworking for General Motors, which I told you, photography here. When I went to\nGeneral Motors, no English. So, since I had some experience from the concentration\ncamp Model As.",
        "A: So my sister go to General Motors, they pay good salary, 10 pounds, or whatever\nit was in those days, and I was having [indecipherable] which is something like\nthis, and then the tube goes in like this. And I was working on brake drums.

        "A: \u2014 because there are gauges, they called the gauges \u2014",

But we had it on for some reason or\nanother, and then I saw it. Well, I saw that the pilot made a mistake, of course. Why\nwould I think that it\u2019s a terrorist attack? And the same things with Auschwitz. Why\nwould anybody think that a sophisticate nation like the Germans would come up\nwith something like this because of religion, or where you come from? Unheard of.\nAnd the same is with that 9/11, where did you think that that would be planned?",
        "A: Now when you see it again, you know, the \u2014 you know what happened. And if\nsomething in the future would come up with some crazy person like Hitler was,\nmaybe \u2014 maybe the world will not make the same mistake. There was a wonderful\nstory, \u201cWall Street Journal\u2019 \u2014 I\u2019m not trying to sell the \u201cWall Street Journal,\u201d but\nthat\u2019s what I\u2019m reading, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. They were talking about\nthe preemptive stri-strike. If someone like this happened to be somewhere, they were\ntalking about Iran, that you shouldn\u2019t wait until it\u2019s too late. And whoever wrote it\nwas a historian, or whatever it was. Was a couple days ago, I gave it to Elise to read.\n132May 4, 2013\nAnd he said if \u2014 if the allied forces would have done something, that Hitler marched\ninto Zar(ph), and the other place, I [indecipherable]",
        "A: And the story said, maybe five million people would not have been killed. Well,\nyou know, she would have something what you should have done. God knows. But\nmaybe you not have the will of the way into Auschwitz, you know? God knows. I \u2014\nI don\u2019t know. I lived through it, it was there. I \u2014 I told you I \u2014 the times, from time to\ntime, when I \u2014 when I was [indecipherable] and all that stuff, you know? God\nknows. But people make the same mistakes, ye \u2014 they don\u2019t learn from history, you\nknow.",
        "A: So if you can kindly take my stuff out of me. Do I still have it? Yeah, I do.",
        "A: I\u2019m very glad that you came.",
