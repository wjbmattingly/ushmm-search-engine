        "Q: Good morning.",
        "A: Good morning.",
        "Q: Thank you for agreeing to the interview.",
        "A: I\u2019m very pleased, Joan, that you...This 1s the first time I\u2019m doing anything like this.",
        "Q: So, first tell me where you were born.",
        "A: I was born in Zagreb. At that time, it was the kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes,\nlater became Yugoslavia. It\u2019s Croatia now.",
        "Q: And what year were you born?",
        "A: I was born in 1921, December fifth.",
        "Q: December fifth?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: 1921? And, what was your name when you were born, your full name?",
        "A: Officially, you know, in the documents, I was Carolina Sternberg, but I was always\nknown as Lucie, L-u-c-i-e C-a-r-o-]-1-n-e, and that was never used except on documents.",
        "Q: And your name now?",
        "A: Lucie Carol Rosenberg.",
        "Q: Rosenberg. Now, I want us to get some sense of what your life was like in your\nchildhood. So, perhaps you can start with your parents, or you can start where you would\nlike.",
        "A: My father\u2019s name was Manfred Sternberg. My mother\u2019s name was Lili. Her maiden name\nwas Prister, P-r-i-s-t-e-r. He was from Slavonska Pozega, which was a rural part of\nCroatia, and my mother was from Zagreb and her family was an old Zagreb family that\nhad originally come from what is now Italy and 1s the extreme border that really is on the\nother side of Radiska and Achilea (ph), and places like that.",
        "Q: And, your mother\u2019s family was a fairly wealthy family?",
        "A: They were a wealthy family.",
        "Q: And, what did her father do?",
        "A: Her father was an architect and actually did all sorts of building both for the \u2014 some\nprivate buildings, but he did a lot of \u2014 for instance, he was building docks in Fiume at the\ntime, and various \u2014 I think maybe some public buildings of one kind or another. I don\u2019t\nthink that he was a particularly inventive or artistic or whatever, but he was a work-a-day\narchitect who always kept his profession, whereas the rest of his family was spending\nmoney like crazy and ended up paupers, many of them, after spending money like mad in\none direction or another. He was always working.",
        "Q: And what was your father doing?",
        "A: My father was an industrialist. I think mostly agricultural. Croatia obviously was a very\nagricult \u2014 mostly, 80 percent agricultural country, and he had alcohol \u2014 and he had an\nalcohol yeast factory which was a very large one, and probably the largest in that part of\nCroatia, and a number of other agricultural refineries and so on.",
        "Q: Since I\u2019m ignorant, what does it mean to have an alcohol yeast factory? What is that?",
        "A: Well, yeast obviously, you know, is made - these we were almost monopolies because\nthere were certain ones, I mean, not many people were producing yeast for making bread.\nAgricultural alcohol means that they would take beets, you know, various corn, for\ninstance, and so on, and it would be refined as alcohol. And for a while, as a matter for\nfact, in Croatia, there was a law where you had to mix alcohol with gasoline, which is\nwhat they\u2019re doing here now, and this was always very protected because there were\nhuge, huge taxes otherwise. But being as it was agricultural, any kind of agricultural stuff\nwas protected by the government because it was sort of beneficial to the state or\nwhatever, or the peasantry or whatever. So, obviously there were lots of land where some\nof this raw material was produced, but also was bought from the peasants as needed. The\nyeast was, you know, shipped around and so on.",
        "Q: So, you were born into a very privileged life?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: So, tell me about \u2014 like, let me first ask you, what is your clearest memory of your\nmother? When you were little, when you were a young person?",
        "A: A very sweet lady getting dressed to go out somewhere elegantly.",
        "Q: So, they were very social?",
        "A: They were very social, but everybody was this way, young people, and it was a social\ntown, and it was a fairly small group, totally mixed \u2014 both Jewish and non-Jewish\npopulation.",
        "Q: Now, were you taken care of primarily by governesses at this time?",
        "A: Yes, but my mother supervised. One of my very early memories was of a German nurse\nwith a \u2014 who were dressed like nuns, and had this long veil. They were special children\u2019s\nnurses. And she was unusually unpleasant, and put me apparently into a dark room, and I\ndo remember that, and the cook saved \u2014 me upstairs, started screaming and the woman\nwas let go immediately, and then there was, I guess, when my brother was born, there\nwas a peasant nanny that came and until my brother\u2019s maybe five, this was there. Then I\ngot an English governess, Miss... her name was... because the second one \u2014 the first one\nwas called Miss \u201cMees Smees\u201d \u2014 Miss Smith \u2014 she was known \u201cMees Smees\u201d\u2019,, who was\nwith us for maybe six months. My brother was throwing tantrums and \u2014 because he\ncouldn\u2019t stand her, and then the nanny came back for \u2014 and stayed forever as part of the\nhousehold. And then there was a Swiss person who was quite unpleasant for about six\nmonths, and then my real English governess who stayed for years, whose name was\nAgnes Coyne. And there, there was something kind of amusing about her because when\nKing Alexander was killed. There was a...",
        "Q: That was in \u201928?",
        "A: No, I think maybe \u00b034, \u201934. There was a regency formed because Peter was too young to\ngovern and one of the \u2014 I mean, the main member of this, of this regency was King\nAlexander\u2019s cousin, Prince Paul, and two other persons \u2014 one was a Slovene and the\nother was a guy buy name of Ivo Perovic, which was a Croatian ban, which was sort of\nlike a governor of a state. He had three children and lived in Zagreb, but then they moved\nback to \u2014 then they moved to Belgrade, and they decided they absolutely had to have our\ngoverness, and contacted her and contacted my mother, and they wanted \u2014 she didn\u2019t\nwant to go. And my mother said, \u201cYou absolutely have to go because we would have\nsanctions against us left and right. You can\u2019t say no.\u201d And finally she went, but\napparently she was so unhappy she phoned us practically every week, and one day\nappeared at our doorstep with her suitcases and my mother had to make up some big\nstory about her being sick, having to move to England, nervous breakdown and so on,\nand she stayed until I guess I was 16.",
        "Q: Where did you eat dinner? Did you eat with your parents? Did you eat -",
        "A: Lunch... The main meal was at noon, and the governess and my brother and I sat at the\ntable with them, and in the evening we sat with them when had dinner with the\ngoverness.",
        "Q: So, do you remember conversations around the table? Were they very inquisitive about\nwhat you had done during the day? Or was this a very adult meal?",
        "A: Both.",
        "Q: Both?",
        "A: Both, but yes, of course, because we often didn\u2019t have school at the same time. Schools\nwere \u2014 school days were three days in the morning, three days in the afternoon from eight\nto one, quarter to one, something like that, and then afterwards we would have private\nclasses of one kind or another at home in German, French, this and that. And, my brother\nmay have gone \u2014 he did not go to the same school as I did, but I\u2019m a little \u2014 I\u2019m already\nhigh school. I'll go back, if you want, to, to primary school.",
        "Q: He\u2019s three years younger.",
        "A: Three years younger, three years younger, yeah. And so I\u2019m not quite sure whether \u2014 I\nthink I\u2019m talking now mostly is-is already in secondary school. Yeah, because, but\notherwise, yeah, we ate at the table. This was mostly for discipline.",
        "Q: In what way?",
        "A: Well, you know, you sit around and slop around in sort of a children\u2019s room, it\u2019s different\nthan when you\u2019re sitting at the table with a meal that was served with white gloves.",
        "Q: So, there were people there who were serving with white gloves?",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: So, did that mean you have to be very prim and proper, as well?",
        "A: Yes. Well, no, listen, because she took off her gloves and we palled around afterwards,\nbut, yeah, it was quite formal. It was quite formal.",
        "Q: Were your parent warm to you? Were they affectionate?",
        "A: Yes. Yes, but also quite disciplinarian, both, yeah.",
        "Q: Were you close with your brother even though he was...?",
        "A: Yes, yes. I mean, as much as you\u2019re close with a boy who\u2019s three years younger than you.\nYou despise them mostly, but yes.",
        "Q: And the friends that you had, were the many school chums that you had, or were...?",
        "A: First of all cousins.",
        "Q: Lots of cousins?",
        "A: Not many, one cousin who is Mia Bauer (ph), who is two and a half younger \u2014 two and a\nhalf years younger than me. There was another one who died who was also three years\nyounger, and then there were extended family \u2014 cousins who were about \u2014 but he was the\noldest, except for two cousins who were from out of town, and then later on \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a\nvery large family. And the Pristers all lived apart, so this was mostly Sternberg part of the\nfamily. Although there was one cousin of the younger ones of the sisters that would have\nbeen \u2014 who was about my age, maybe a year younger or so. Yes, they were very\naffectionate; yes they were strict as far as school work is concerned, as far as manners\nwere concerned, as far as -",
        "Q: Did you like school?",
        "A: Yes, I did. Although, I wasn\u2019t a particularly good student at it.",
        "Q: And, the private lessons that you had at home, what were they?",
        "A: French, later on. Sometimes if I wasn\u2019t doing too well in any subjects, somebody would\ncome and we would work on the Latin and so on. Then I would go out for gym of one\nkind or another, tap dancing.",
        "Q: Tap dancing?",
        "A: Tap dancing at the time of Shirley Temple, I guess, it was the rage. But that was outside.\nI mean, that wasn\u2019t at home.",
        "Q: Did you ever tap dance at home once you got back?",
        "A: Mildly, yes. Yes, I was not particularly good at it.",
        "Q: Go ahead, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: Also, there were gym classes of other kinds. Now, this is kind of interesting. My brother\nwent to the Maccabi, as most Jewish kids did, but I went first to the Sokol. The Sokol is a\npan-Slavistic \u2014 pan-Slavic gym organization and also, I guess, pan-national, pan-Slavistic\nnationalistic organization, that had a lot of calisthenic-type things, and I went to that\nwhich took place \u2014 I can\u2019t remember \u2014 in some \u2014 there was a thing, yes, they had a\nparticular hall in town which was called a Sokolan (ph), and there were dances there as a\nmatter of fact and so on. And, somewhere in the early 30s, maybe \u201932 and so on, they\nhad \u2014 there were things like the Olympics but only Slavic. So, they would come and, I\nmean, I never traveled out of Zagreb for it, but I remember there was a very large\ngathering and people came from Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria and Poland and who\nknows what, and there was this march and we did calisthenics and we did, you know, like\nthe Germans did and so on. There\u2019s these horrendous things in stadiums and in fact there\nwas a stadium built at the time for this particular get together. And then later when I was\nabout 12, again, my brother and others in the family were in the Maccabi, I was a\nmember of the HASK, which was the Crotian academic sports club, Hrvatski akademski\nsportski klub, which still exists. It was a big soccer club and gym, and I did \u2014 what was\nit? \u2014 track, I ran marathons and that kind of thing. It was short marathons, and trained\nwith it, and stuff like that.",
        "Q: So, was your family very Jewish identified in terms of the synagogue, or was this in\nterms of social groups more?",
        "A: My \u2014 they were obviously members of the synagogue. In fact, my mother had a plaque\non, you know, a seat in the synagogue and so on, and they went for, I guess, Yom Kippur\nand the major holidays. We were required to go, both in public high school and so on, on\nSaturday to children services in the synagogue. And it counted \u2014 you had to have an\nexcuse from the rabbi if you didn\u2019t attend.",
        "Q: So, this 1s nationally required.",
        "A: This was nationally required as the Serbs and as the \u2014 the Serb Orthodox \u2014 and the\nCatholic kids had to go to services. This was not all the time, but there was maybe a\nperiod of three, four years where this was really seriously required. And we had religious\nclasses both in public high school and obviously in the Jewish school where I went \u2014 I\nwent to four years to the elementary school, to the Jewish school, where we learned both\nbiblical Hebrew and then later on modern Hebrew, and sang various things and so on. So,\nit was quite interesting as far as that\u2019s concerned. And, once \u2014 and then, during that, as I\nsaid, during the major holidays, the parents went and we went to the synagogue, which\nwas just around the corner from town.",
        "Q: Did you celebrate holidays at home as well?",
        "A: There was a Challah loaf.",
        "Q: On Fridays?",
        "A: No, not on Fridays, on holidays. And for Passover we were usually farmed out to people\nwho knew how to do this better, or well, anyhow \u2014 we went to that and then for\nHannukah, there was a candles and -",
        "Q: What would you call the family? Certainly not orthodox.",
        "A: No...",
        "Q: But traditional or somewhat observant?",
        "A: Traditional.",
        "Q: Traditional?",
        "A: There were some \u2014 I mean, yeah. I suppose so.",
        "Q: It sounds like, from what you\u2019re saying, that you didn\u2019t experience anti-Semitism as you\na kid growing up.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: That you were integrated in the community.",
        "A: Completely.",
        "Q: And do you think this was true of the Jewish population in Zagreb and in Croatia in\ngeneral?",
        "A: I think so. I think so. Yes.",
        "Q: So, you think so.",
        "A: Yes. Pretty much so.",
        "Q: It was very different from a lot of people\u2019s experiences in eastern Europe and central\nEurope.",
        "A: Totally, totally. I\u2019m not talking only about Zagreb, but for instance, my father in\nSlavonska Pozega, his father and the priest of the one leading church there, obviously\nRoman Catholic, used to play cards together daily, and so on. Totally. Not only that, but\nmy aunt was \u2014 this was the one that was a few years younger than my father \u2014 was sent to\nLjubljana to a Malud, I mean, there was a school with was run by nuns, a boarding school\nrun by nuns, which is where she sort of went to finishing school at age 14. She hated it,\nbut that\u2019s where she went, finishing school I guess in German.",
        "Q: Did you see movies as a kid?",
        "A: Yes, sure.",
        "Q: What did you like? Do you remember?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Clark Gable movies. A lot of German movies, of course, until the time came\nwhen we didn\u2019t go to any German movies. It happened \u2014 what was it that was this\nwonderful Clark Gable movie where they were on a train? I forget the name of it. \u201cIt\nHappened One Night\u2019? Yes. That was one I remember.",
        "Q: It\u2019s always odd when I hear people from Europe talking about American movies.",
        "A: Yes, that was one of them. \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d, I think. Any possible Shirley Temple\nmovie that came around.",
        "Q: Were these subtitled?",
        "A: There was subtitles.",
        "Q: But you understood?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, sure, but there were subtitles.",
        "Q: And were you fluent in English?",
        "A: Completely.",
        "Q: Completely?",
        "A: Yeah. The first governess was when I was seven, Mees Smees.",
        "Q: Mees Smees, yes. Culturally, what did you do? Did you go to concerts?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you go to museums?",
        "A: We went to concerts, which were quite frequent and good musical life there. They had \u2014\nmy grandmother had a loge in the opera in the national theater with her name on it. So, I\nhad to go to whatever was appropriate for children, ballet and so on. There was very nice\n\u2014 there was student, afternoon student performances with the school at a very low price,\nand you stood in the back if you had to, and that was permitted. I was always very\npleased to do that. My grandmother had a subscription to various concerts which took\nplace. And the theater of all kinds. The older \u2014 the parents, the grandmother and\ngrandfather \u2014 went to Vienna every season to get clothes because we couldn\u2019t in Zagreb,\nto have them made, and to the opera especially. My grandmother on my father\u2019s side\nremarried. She was a widow. She was married, and her husband was a Croatian Jew, but\nhe was bank director in Vienna, and she was \u2014 she loved being a Croatian, a provincial\nlady, and she actually brought to Vienna a Croat room, a folk room, like a peasant room.\nShe went so far as to bring the wood paneling, cut out the way that they do in Croatia\u2014 a\npeasant room with peasant furniture, peasant dolls, stuff like that, which was kind of\namusing, but she lived there so then from the time I was maybe a year old or so. She died\nwhen I was five, but I remember going visiting there and obviously, my mother and her\nmother used to go every season to Vienna, once a year at least, probably twice.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to ask you about going to England \u2014 but I want to ask you to sort of reflect\nthose years. Do you have any fond memories of your childhood or is it ambivalent?",
        "A: Ambivalent in many ways.",
        "Q: Can you explain that?",
        "A: Yes, I would\u2019ve loved to have been \u2014 I did, I was permitted from time to time to ride the\ntrolley to school, but mostly I walked because that was healthy, but if I had been sick and\nthe weather was dreadful, I would be driven to school, but the car was never permitted to\nstop there. I would emerge behind the corner.",
        "Q: Was that so the people wouldn\u2019t see that you had been driven?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t want it, and it would have been show-off. It would\u2019 ve been immodest for a little\ngirl to be driven.",
        "Q: So, you, yourself remain ambivalent about the kind of privilege you lived in.",
        "A: Yes, yes. It was \u2014 there were a number of well-off families, obviously, but 1t was\nuncomfortable because the schools were totally mixed. You had children who were\npoverty stricken, who got free milk both at the Jewish school and in high school, I mean,\nin secondary school, and it was embarrassing. It was embarrassing when the governess\nwould pick me up. I didn\u2019t like that. Although, oddly, I was with a friend two years ago,\nlast year, two years ago in Zagreb who remembered how disgusted Pippsi was \u2014 Agnes\nCoyne, we called her Pippsi. She said, \u201cNo, she was wonderful.\u201d I said, \u201cHow can you\nsay that? She was a horrible woman.\u201d \u201cNo, no, she was always very nice to me.\u201d You\nknow, it was \u2014 you\u2019re right, it was unpleasant. And when you walked home, if you were\npicked up with friends, everybody, you know, reported back to one\u2019s mother how you \u2014\nwhether you greeted them properly, whether you curtsied, we curtsied. Still, I curtsied\nwhen I came to the States to married women always.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, you were taught to curtsy to-",
        "A: Older women, yeah.",
        "Q: Did it make it difficult for you to make friends because of your -",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: It didn\u2019t?",
        "A: No, I had lots of friends, very good friends 1n all strata, absolutely all strata. They would\ncome to me. I would come to them \u2014 not a problem and not as far as religion was\nconcerned or anything else, no, not at all.",
        "Q: We\u2019re going to stop.",
        "A: Good. Thank you.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk a little bit about your political consciousness before you leave for England.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: And you go to England in 1937.",
        "A: Right. Right.",
        "Q: Are you very politically conscious?",
        "A: Yes, and I was fairly Croatian \u2014 well, first I was very Yugoslav. And then I become quite\nCroatian because they \u2014 mostly because, probably because the pressure from Belgrade\nwas really quite bad. You felt it and everyday life. In fact, if you look at a certificate,\nschool certificate from a public school in Zagreb, 1t was supposed to be in the two\nlanguages. So, you have it in Cyrillic, in Serbian, and you have it in Serbian with Latin\nscript. It went that far. There was a lot of indoctrination, very intensely Yugoslav. I guess\nyou just become \u2014 many of our friends were Croatian, peasant party people, who were\nmostly nice and decent and I don\u2019t think \u2014 they may have been anti-Semitic, but certainly\nnot overtly so. I don\u2019t know, maybe some were. Some were, on the contrary, very less so.\nAnd both my father and my uncle who was a lawyer were very, very \u2014 had friends of all\nkinds. During King Alexander, and later on actually, even Prince Paul\u2019s regime and the\nvarious Serbian \u2014 especially after the death of Alexander, there was a lot of repression,\nand one of the members of my extended family was a young man who was a communist.\nHe was in the same jail as Mose Piyade, and he was killed in the war. There was a whole\ngroup of young Communist activists, leftists, all of them, of course, very idealistic, had\nno idea what it really meant, and who sat in jail. And my uncle, who was a lawyer, was\nthe one who was taking packages and taking care of them, and so on. They were in very,\nvery notorious political prisons. One of them is Lepoglava where they continued giving,\nyou know, that was also later on in jail during the Ustashe regime and so on. So, there\nwas a lot of that going on. I\u2019m trying to think, yeah.",
        "Q: If I can ask you a question.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: How would you characterize being very Yugoslavian Nationalist versus when you talk\nabout becoming Croatian? How does one distinguish?",
        "A: Well...",
        "Q: How would you distinguish?",
        "A: For me, I think this happened when I was maybe I was eleven. I guess you suddenly\nbecame aware of that this was a repressive regime and that people\u2019s friends were being \u2014\nwere being oppressed and also the peasants. At that time, Doctor Macek, who was sort of\nthe leader of the Croatian peasant party and then later on became a member of the\ngovernment, was in the opposition, and you lived in Croatia and not in Belgrade. You\nhave \u2014 a lot of taxes and \u2014 not a lot, most, almost everything went to Belgrade. So, there\nit was [coughs], excuse me, there was a great deal of corruption of one kind or another.\nMoney that was collected in taxes simply disappeared in Belgrade, and public works that\nwere necessary in Croatia never took place. They were done in Belgrade. They weren\u2019t\neven done in Serbia. They were stalled along the way. And, later on, there was a political\n\u2014I keep wanting to say the Spanish word which 1s convenio, but actually they \u2014 the\nCroatian Peasant party was actually now a public party, and it was not anything that was\nrepressed in such a way, and there was a coalition government formed with Doctor\nMacek. And I remember during this, during the election campaign when you\u2019d drive out\nin the countryside, you know, the peasants would yell, \u201cZivio Doktor Macek!\u201d You also\nyelled, \u201cZivio Doktor Macek!\u2019, and so on - May he live long.",
        "Q: And what does that mean?",
        "A: Doctor \u2014 \u201cMay he live long,\u201d I mean, \u201cHail,\u201d or whatever you want to Doctor Macek.\nAnd this \u2014 the Croatian consciousness, which had been really very, very repressed \u2014 and\nmaybe that was one reason why all those Ustashes were successful later on because, you\nknow, of course, they via a Bulgarian assassin killed Alexander, and after that, there was\na very repressive regime in Belgrade which repressed Croatia most of all.",
        "Q: Really? More than any of the other...provinces?",
        "A: Much more, much more.",
        "Q: And did you feel that?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t feel it, no. I did not feel it, but I mean, it was talked about a lot in school. Like,\nfor instance, \u201cGod forbid, Croatia is not the Balkans. The Balkans stop at the Sava\nRiver.\u201d",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes, yes, that kind of stuff.",
        "Q: So, who was Croatia, from that point of view, if not the Balkans? Just Croatia?",
        "A: It was Croatia. And actually, geographically, it does stop there, and that\u2019s how far the\nTurks went. I mean, this is where they were stopped before going, getting into Vienna.",
        "Q: At the same time, Alexander\u2019s assassinated in 1934.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: In 1933, Hitler\u2019s over in Germany. Are you very conscious of this?",
        "A: Yes, yes, completely conscious because I remember \u2014 I remember walking through a\nstreet, I must have been reading. Obviously, I was reading. There was a \u2014 I'll regress a\nlittle bit. Somewhere in 1933 or \u2019?34, my parents went to Chicago \u2014 whenever the World\u2019s\nFair was in Chicago. It may have been in \u201934. Was it?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Somewhere there. Okay, I think it may have been \u201933 or \u201934. When I tell you the next\ndate, you will remember. We were in Slovenia on vacation with Agnes Coyne, Pippsi,\nand a friend of my mother\u2019s, and this was right on the Austrian border, and this was the\nyear when Dolfuss was assassinated in Austria. He was the chancellor at the time. My\nparents got very scared, and phoned Zagreb and somebody came to see, to remove us\nfrom the border of Austria, and that\u2019s when things started becoming \u2014 became obvious\nthat things were going to be happening in Austria. And, I remember the election when\nHitler was elected as chancellor because there was a demonstration in Zagreb, and I\nremember seeing a \u2014 there was a newspaper. I don\u2019t think the paper was edited there, but\nthere was a shop window where the headlines were posted, the front page of one of the\npapers was posted, and I remember seeing this. Then you started talking about anti-\nSemitism and so on, and that\u2019s what I, how I remember this.",
        "Q: You were 12 or 13\u201d?",
        "A: About that, yes.",
        "Q: Do you and your friends talk about this?",
        "A: Very much so. In the first place, we had, very soon after that, refugees coming in. Not\nunder horrendous duress, but wanting to leave Austria, and we had very intimate friends\nthere, which was a mixed marriage. The husband was Jewish. The mother was not\nJewish. They wanted to leave. They came, they stayed with us, and they finally left for\nArgentina. One of the men who were working in my father\u2019s factory. Actually, he was in\ncharge of livestock. He was half German and half Argentine, and as you know, they had a\nbig cattle industry in Argentina, and he was there for years on the farm. The farm was\npart of the factory, as I told you. This was all \u2014 molasses were there and the cows were\neating part of it, and so, this man, who had both German and Argentine citizenship,\nmanaged to get these friends, whose name was Polla (sp), visas to go to Argentina, and\nthey stayed with us in the meantime. And more and more Austrian Jews were coming,\nsitting in coffeehouses. That\u2019s when there started to be some unpleasant remarks were\nmade, \u201cDo we need these German speaking foreigners sitting here?\u201d Then it became,\n\u201cGerman speaking Jews.\u201d And obviously they were staying either in rooming houses or\nhotels or with friends, but they were \u2014 everybody was \u2014it was a coffeehouse society. I\nmean, my mother went to coffeehouse, my father \u2014 not the same one mind you. The men\nplayed cards in one place, and the women had their bridge game someplace else or just\nwent for coffee. So, 1t was a coffeehouse society like Vienna, and so on. You know, here\nthey are talking German. At that point, nobody, none of the Croatian Jews spoke German.\nWe were \u2014 except to them. I mean, it was, \u201cPlease don\u2019t speak German.\u201d And we didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: So, you, at that point, began to feel a certain kind of threat.",
        "A: Absolutely. Absolutely, from that time on, and it was getting more and more. There was\ntalk of Dachau, for instance. There were no killing camps. There were no extermination\ncamps. There were concentration camps and political camps and so on, and we knew of\nthem. We knew that things were starting to happen, and at that point, obviously, we were\n\u2014 oh, and then for instance, we had a subscription to Neue Freie Presse, which then we\ndidn\u2019t want to have anymore. Then, instead of the German papers, the Austrian papers,\nmy father got Swiss papers, and everybody was listening to the radio to see what was\nhappening, and so on. That was very \u2014 that felt threatening already.",
        "Q: Do you see the beginnings of the Ustashe or is it- ?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: At this point?",
        "A: No, not at all, not at all.",
        "Q: Do you have any personal experience with people starting to say something about you as\na Jewish person?",
        "A: No, never.",
        "Q: Never?",
        "A: Never.",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting.",
        "A: Never, and I don\u2019t think anybody else really. Never.",
        "Q: But you decide you will not talk German.",
        "A: Not only I, and there were a lot of people for whom it was hard because their education\nhad been Austro-Hungarian, and there \u2014 and their literary language was not Croatian.\nMine was. I spoke German, but I never -",
        "Q: Was it true for non-Jews as well as Jews the decision not to speak German, or was it\nmainly the Jewish population?",
        "A: I think mainly the Jewish population, yeah, because the upper-middle class, non-Jewish,\nprobably continued. These were remnants of old Austro-Hungarian bureaucracy,\naristocracy and so on, and they spoke German. And there were certain parts of Croatia\nwhere German was spoken almost as an everyday language. It never was with me, but for\ninstance, Osijek, my great-grandmother, spoke Croatian, and very well and correctly, but\nshe was more comfortable in German. But that was the town of Osijek where there was a\ngreat \u2014 by the way, that was a very large Volksdeutsche population around there that had\ncome in \u2014 Slavians that had come in, I don\u2019t know, in the 17\" century, 18\" century, a\nwhole batch of them who then became quislings of the worst sort. But, I mean, there were\nvillages of nothing but German-speaking people in, mostly in Slavonia.",
        "Q: Did you spend any time with these Austrian Jews who were coming through?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: And, how would you characterize them because they\u2019re obviously leaving earlier than the\nEinschluss because you were still...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What is that they think is going to happen, or what...?",
        "A: They are, I don\u2019t know, they were not comfortable. There was one and possibly, now that\nI think of it, these were mostly mixed marriages. There was another very well-off\nindustrialist by the name of Alfred Braun, who was married to a non-Jewish Austrian\nwoman, who took off for Kenya, and he was a business friend of my father\u2019s, and I\nremember them coming on business occasions previously, and then leaving for Kenya\nfrom Yugoslavia, as I remember.",
        "Q: Do you remember young people your age, young teenagers?",
        "A: One of them was \u2014 with families only \u2014 and another thing that happened is we all used to\nwear dirndls, you know Austrian \u2014 not real dirndls because they were too expensive to\nwear \u2014 but, you know, the little aprons and dresses with little puff sleeves. Everybody\nstopped wearing that. My brother had lederhosen. That was \u2014 I still have a picture of him\nas a small child, and then all that disappeared. It was also worn in Slovenia, you know, on\nthe border, but we all stopped wearing stuff like that.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something, does this stop because it\u2019s \u2014 you\u2019re feeling anti-German?",
        "A: Yes. Anti-Austrian at first, and then, yeah.",
        "Q: So, you want no identification in this way?",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Were you, yourself, wondering what \u2014 would there be war, or would there be\nconcentration camps, or would...?",
        "A: There would be...a threat.",
        "Q: Whatever that would be.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You wouldn\u2019t...",
        "A: No, there would be a threat. And we, obviously \u2014 I mean, then later on things started to\ndevelop and Croatia was entirely surrounded by countries to which you couldn\u2019t go in,\neither pro-Nazi or were actually overrun or whatever. So, it was sort of like a little island,\nespecially when the Germans entered Greece, it was very threatening, but that\u2019s much\nlater on.",
        "Q: Now, in the Jewish groups...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: The gymnastic groups...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Is there a lot of talk among the Jewish kids?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: About what all this means?",
        "A: I think so. I think so, yes, sure.",
        "Q: You do remember that, yourself?",
        "A: I remember. Certainly, I remember, and I had a conversation with \u2014 what I didn\u2019t\nremember was brought back to me a couple of years ago, talking to the same friend of\nmine who said, \u201cAh! Your father was so smart and got you out in time.\u201d I said, \u201cYou\ncouldn\u2019t get out.\u201d People didn\u2019t have the means. There were many reasons why you\ncouldn\u2019t get out, and I said \u2014 and she said, \u201cI became aware of that when the first\nAustrian refugees knocked on our door.\u201d I don\u2019t remember anybody knocking on our\ndoor to come and stay, and she said \u201cThat\u2019s when I started pushing my mother,\u201d who, by\nthe way, was married to a non-Jewish Slovene of German descent or Austrian descent\nand so on. Saved them in one way or another, in other ways not. So, of course, we talked\nabout it, of course we did.",
        "Q: Did you remember other people knocking at your door?",
        "A: No, people who came, I mean, yeah.",
        "Q: They knew?",
        "A: They knew. Now, for instance, another group that came was this \u2014 again, this is people\nfrom my father\u2019s hometown, their name was Dierenbach, and they were from Pozega and\ntwo brothers who went and became bankers \u2014 one in Nuremburg, the other in Dresdner.\nThey both work at the Dresdner Bank, both married to very, very German Jewish women.\nI mean, very German, intensely so, and they had \u2014 they didn\u2019t have dual-nationality. They\nwere already German, and the son must have been about 13 at the time. This family came\nback and settled and the boy started learning Croatian, and spoke it. The mother never\nlearned Croatian. And so, they were part of our group. I mean, he became part of fairly\nclose knit \u2014 my cousins, and this boy, especially because they were originally \u2014 the\nparents were originally from my father\u2019s hometown. Yeah, they kept trickling in. There\nweren\u2019t huge boatloads, not boatloads, trainloads of people coming in.",
        "Q: So, why, in 1937, did you go to Oxford, or prepare to go to Oxford, in England?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: My father was always very anglophile and I wanted to go. I didn\u2019t want to be in my\nschool anymore, and later on my brother came. He went also to school there, but that was\nit. That was it.",
        "Q: It had nothing to do with your father worrying that maybe he should get you out, at this\npoint?",
        "A: No. No. No, because I kept coming home.",
        "Q: Back and forth?",
        "A: Back and forth all the time, no. Obviously, we were in England. My family \u2014 I must have\nbeen on vacation or something and we went back \u2014 and a whole bunch of my family \u2014 my\nbrother was still in Zagreb, but a whole bunch of the family was in London at the time of\nMunich. And we all went back, and I remember \u2014 I remember Chamberlain, and I\nremember the French being \u2014 the army was called up. What do you call 1t when an army\nis \u2014mobilized. We went through Paris, because the train you used was the Orient Express.\nThat was the one way of going. There wasn\u2019t anything elite about it. It\u2019s just \u2014 that\u2019s the\ntrain. That was the line. And there was some members of a family who had moved from\nZagreb to somewhere else whose sons were in England already in school, that\u2019s right, at\nthe university both of them, two boys. I suspect maybe there may have been a question in\nthat case of mobilization of kids to the army, and these were boys of the age that they\nwould have been mobilized in Yugoslavia, maybe that\u2019s the reason why they went there,\nbut this was also a family that had a Precepteur, a French male governess, and then an\nEnglish male governess, and they spoke English and they went to school in England, both\nof them. They were Alfred and Erich Miller, their name was. And they were there, their\nparents were there, and two uncles of ours were there, and I guess they came to leave me\nin school. And in fact, I was at Oxford. I was already...",
        "Q: You were there already?",
        "A: I was there already, and they picked me up and we went back because my father \u2014 they\nhadn\u2019t prepared anything. My brother was in Zagreb, going to school quite normally. And\nthen we stayed until things sort of blew over, and I went back with my brother, I\nremember. I may have the \u2014 I may have the dates off a little bit.",
        "Q: As far as I know, you went to Oxford in \u00b037.",
        "A: It must have been earlier, I think \u201936.",
        "Q: You think \u201936?",
        "A: I think it must have been \u201936. Somewhere I have a piece of \u2014 no, it may have been \u201937 \u2014 I\nhave a piece of paper somewhere where my father is asking permission from the Ministry\nof Finance to buy a certain number of foreign currency for my schooling and my\nbrother\u2019s schooling abroad. You had to have it, and you had to show you passed whatever\nexams were necessary to get the next year\u2019s quota of money, of Pound Sterling to export,\nbecause you were not allowed to take any money out of Yugoslavia.",
        "Q: So, do you think before Chamberlain and Munich, which is 1938, that you were already\nat Oxford?",
        "A: Yes, I was already, yes, I was.",
        "Q: Why would you father want you back?",
        "A: The family should be together. That\u2019s why.",
        "Q: Do you think your father, in 1938 or even before, was thinking about how to get the\nwhole family out of Croatia?",
        "A: I think probably so. I think so.",
        "Q: But you were not talking about this with him.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: He didn\u2019t say anything?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So you go back for a few months-",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Before the attack on Poland.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That whole year, almost a whole year.",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re back almost a whole year. Do you see your family at this point, during this\ntime?",
        "A: Yes, probably I went on you know, on leave.",
        "Q: Do you see brother fairly regularly?",
        "A: At Oxford, all the time, every weekend I had to take him and a bunch of other boys for\nlunch because I was the oldest one, and they were entrusted to me. It was disgusting",
        "Q: You were not happy with that?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: It was horrible. They had dreadful uniforms with boaters, you know, with straw hats,\nhorrendous uniforms, and they handed them over to me and I had to turn them back in.",
        "Q: So, how close was St. Edward\u2019s to-",
        "A: Very close. It was at Oxford.",
        "Q: I see. So, the women did not wear anything, but the boys were wearing these -",
        "A: This was high school. This was what they called public school. It was horrendous. I was\nvery embarrassed. I was the one who was taking care of them.",
        "Q: Now, you returned to Zagreb in \u201939.",
        "A: And my brother.",
        "Q: And your brother?",
        "A: And the Englishman that I was sort of engaged to.",
        "Q: Right, so this is the summer right before the attack on Poland.",
        "A: Yes, right, exactly, exactly.",
        "Q: So, we\u2019ll stop the tape now because we\u2019re at the end of the tape.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back, before we get to, in Zagreb in 1939, describe the scene as you\u2019re going\nthrough Paris after Munich. What does that look like?",
        "A: This was just, just, just exactly a day or two after Munich, total chaos with French men\nbeing mobilized, some in uniform, some in half a uniform. The trains were, including the\nOrient Express, complete \u2014 I mean that we \u2014 there was only standing room. People were\nsitting on, on suitcases, and completely and absolutely chaotic. And then when we came\nto Croatia, everything was quiet. I mean, to Yugoslavia.",
        "Q: So, it must have been frightening to see that.",
        "A: It was extremely frightening. It was extremely frightening. In fact, we almost missed the\ntrain because my father was rushing out to get the latest Swiss papers to read it from a\nneutral point of view, and as he was going in, he pushed somebody and he something\nlike, \u201cPardon,\u201d or something \u2014 no, my father said, \u201cPardon\u201d, and the guy said in French,\n\u2018\u201cFichez-moi la paix!\u201d\u2019, and my father\u2019s French wasn\u2019t very good and he thought he was\ntalking about peace, but what the guy was saying to him was, \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d Or\nsomething like that. And, my father said, \u201cOui, oui, j\u2019espere bien,\u201d or something like that.\nThen, we went on. I remember members of the family sitting on suitcases. That\u2019s how-",
        "Q: How crowded it was.",
        "A: How crowded it was in corridors. I mean, my mother and I sat inside in a wagonilit (ph),\nbut it was totally crazy, and I\u2019m trying to think where it was that it sorted petered out, all\nof the craziness, because when we came to Zagreb it was fairly normal, the train, but it\nwas, for two or three hours, it was this chaotic situation.",
        "Q: Now, when you go to Zagreb for this summer of 1939, and your fianc\u00e9 Joseph Heaton -",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: - 1s with you? And you\u2019re a young woman. You\u2019re 18 years old.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: When did you meet Joseph?",
        "A: At Oxford.",
        "Q: At Oxford?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: He was a student there?",
        "A: He had just graduated.",
        "Q: Was he your first boyfriend?",
        "A: No, no, no. Not I mean really boyfriend. None of these were really serious boyfriends.\nThis was a serious boyfriend. This was a serious, engaged boyfriend, so to speak,\nunofficially, I would say, but expected to.",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: How long had you known him?",
        "A: Maybe six months or so. It was pretty fast.",
        "Q: Were you in classes together?",
        "A: No, no, no. The schools were not together. No, he, he \u2014 I had just started, and he had just\ngraduated with a useless degree in history. But, I mean this was an Eton-Christchurch\ntype person, and it was just love. We fell in love.",
        "Q: He was three or four years older than you?",
        "A: More than that, maybe even six.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So, when \u2014",
        "A: No, I know what \u2014 he is \u2014 I know exactly when he was born. He was born in 1917.",
        "Q: 1917?",
        "A: And, I was born in \u201921, four years.",
        "Q: Not bad.",
        "A: Not bad. At that time, no, at that time it was huge, yes.",
        "Q: Had your parents met him?",
        "A: I was bringing him home, yes.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: Yes, and my brother was the chaperone.",
        "Q: And your brother knew him from-?",
        "A: My brother knew him.",
        "Q: Did they like each other?",
        "A: Yes, sure, sure, sure.",
        "Q: So, how was your parents\u2019 response?",
        "A: My father was very positive. My mother was very negative.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. She didn\u2019t \u2014 she wanted me probably to marry a Jewish boy from Zagreb who I\ncould stay home with. This meant to her that I was going to take off and live God only\nknows where, possibly in the colonies. Who knows what? His father, this guy\u2019s father\nhad all sorts of interests. His older brother was what was then called on the Gold Coast.\nHe had graduated, and they had some kind of interest in Africa. So, my mother had these\nvisions of my living somewhere colonial, which really frightened her, I think.",
        "Q: Now, he wasn\u2019t Jewish, and that bothered your mother?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And that bothered your mother, then.",
        "A: I think it may have bothered my mother, yeah.",
        "Q: But she didn\u2019t say that to you directly?",
        "A: No, she intimated it. [laughs]",
        "Q: But her biggest fear was you go live in those crazy colonies?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, in the colonies and for God\u2019s sakes in England, where the climate was so\nhorrible and the bathrooms were so cold. And that kind of stuff, and \u201cWho\u2019s going to\nbring up my child?\u201d By that time in England, people were having a lot of household help,\nlet\u2019s put it that way, and also, on top of it, his parents were divorced, which was another\nhorrible fault. And, yeah, like that. But, my father liked him very much from the word \u2014\nwell, my father was much more anglophile, although my mother spoke absolutely perfect\nEnglish; my father did not.",
        "Q: Do you think that she liked him, but was worried about what he was going to bring you\nto, or do you think she really didn\u2019t like him somehow?",
        "A: I\u2019m trying to think. He was a different culture. He was... No, no, for instance, it bothered\nher \u2014 boys in Zagreb were, you know, very much coat and tie and so on, and he was a\nrowing blue.",
        "Q: He was a what?",
        "A: He was a rowing blue. He was the one who did the Cambridge, Oxford/Cambridge\nrowing team.",
        "Q: I see. So, he was wearing sweaters?",
        "A: He was wearing, yes, sports clothes, which were very, let\u2019s say, informal. It was\ndifferent.",
        "Q: And, that was attractive to you, wasn\u2019t it?",
        "A: I think so, yes, yes, that and being \u2014 not being obvious as I was in Zagreb. He talks\namong other people who didn\u2019t care who I was, that anonymity was very nice. Then I\ncame back and the anonymity was gone.",
        "Q: It was gone?",
        "A: It was gone because I remember \u2014 oh, he did have \u2014 he was wearing a pair of white slacks\nand a white blazer, which is what these people wore, and I was walking down the street\nin Zagreb. And somebody saw him, of my older friends, actually a very well-known\nhistorian, a woman by the name of Fici Despot (ph). She was one who ended up by being\na Croatian leading historian, and she saw us on the street, and somebody asked her, \u201cDid\nyou see Lucie with the guy, with the Englishman?\u201d And she said, \u201cYes.\u201d And she said,\n\u201cWhat did he look like?\u201d And she said, \u201cLike the ice cream man.\u201d So, you know, it was\nlike that.",
        "Q: Was he shocked when he came and saw how your-?",
        "A: No, he came from a very wealthy family. Although the family was divorced and his\nmother lived in the lake district, and so on. So, no.",
        "Q: So, he was perfectly comfortable?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: So, you had a big social life during that summer?",
        "A: Yes, because two days after we were there, or maybe three days after we arrived, four\nother people that we knew from Oxford arrived \u2014 two young men. Two were journalists,\nand two were people that I just knew who had just graduated, who were \u2014 but not friends\nof Joe\u2019s. They met there. He was very jealous, as a matter of fact, but I had made these\narrangements previously, and they came and they were going to go do a tour of the\nBalkans or Europe or whatever afterwards, and they stayed with us. And then there was\nthe invasion of Poland in September, and all of them immediately went to Zagreb to the\nBritish Consulate and immediately \u2014 immediately reported, and the other four took off\nright away, almost immediately, to go to England, and Joe stayed maybe another week\nand went back. That\u2019s the last time I saw him. They put him on the train a week later.",
        "Q: Did you try to convince him not to leave?",
        "A: Oh, no, no, I would have gone myself. We were all very gung-ho to go fight Hitler one\nway or another.",
        "Q: That must have been very sad time for you.",
        "A: It was horrible. I remember it. It was on the railroad station, and of course at that time to\nembrace a man you weren\u2019t married to or whatever, kiss him on the railroad station, my\nparents averted their heads and went off, and it was so on. Maybe I was here and they\nwere 100 meters away. Underneath there\u2019s way, there\u2019s a whole new... I think my mother\nwas relieved.",
        "Q: You think she was relieved?",
        "A: She was relieved. She was very fond of this person who, whose photograph I had, who\nwas more to her liking and also, you know...",
        "Q: But this was not typical to have people who were not married kissing and certainly\nkissing in public.",
        "A: Oh, God, terrible",
        "Q: You learned really terrible things at Oxford.",
        "A: Yes, yes, but then I was supposed to have been engaged to him officially, so to speak.",
        "Q: Right. So, what happens then? You\u2019re \u2014 you were in Zagreb, you\u2019re obviously not going\nback.",
        "A: I can\u2019t go back. I can\u2019t go back to the place. So, then I start taking \u2014 my brother, let\u2019s put\nit that way, had lost a year. In order to get back to high school, he had to go to a private\nschool to make up subjects such as National History, Croatian Language, Yugoslav\nGeography, which was a separate subject and so on, and he went to a private school\nwhich was horrendously terrible for him because only retarded kids went to private\nschools, but he went for a whole year before he could make up and then go to a regular\nhigh school after that. That was really traumatic because \u2014 yeah, I remember that very\nwell. I did odds and ends. I took classes in History of Art. There was some sort of free\nuniversity which was for people who did not \u2014 who were not inscribed, that you could go\nto classes. The British Council was running English classes and I sat in on them for\nlaughs, really, because a friend of mine had gone there and did a course in proficiency in\nEnglish which oddly, somewhere in \u201947, I got the results of the exams. Could you believe\nit? Somebody found them at the British Council after the war through a relative of mine. I\nlearned typing, so I would know something worthwhile and practical for the future. In\nfact, I brought an Olivetti with me on the trip to the United States. I went to these\nridiculous balls that were \u2014 You were launched in Zagreb when you went to a certain\ndance.",
        "Q: And launched, is it -?",
        "A: As a debutante. Until you were 18, you were a snotty-nose that nobody even considered\nas a person. You were a school child, a school girl, and so on, but after the Matura, after\nyou graduated from high school, which I did not there, but I got to be 18 years old, you\nwent to these various balls, and the ball was the, oddly enough, the journalist ball, and\nonce you were at the journalist ball, I guess you were ready to get married maybe.\nAnyhow, then you were in society. Then you can \u2014 I mean, then you were no longer led\nby the hand, although supervised seriously, but you were launched.",
        "Q: Now, these launchings, this is a mixed launching? This is Jewish, Catholic-",
        "A: Oh, absolutely.",
        "Q: Everybody?",
        "A: Completely. Completely absolutely.",
        "Q: And, this was horrendous for you?",
        "A: For me, it was horrendous. It was, you know, first of all, wearing ridiculous clothes that I\nhated with high heels, which I still hate. You had to have these dresses made on the\nwhole, because there was no ready-to-wear, which was standing in front of dressmakers\u2019\nmirrors being prodded hither and yon by mothers, by dressmakers, by couturiers, and so\non. It was hard, but you went.",
        "Q: Did your mother like this?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. That was the duty, this was duty, but my mother \u2014 I was, and I still am,\nhorribly nearsighted. To wear glasses, my God, I mean, you know \u2014 it was torn off of my\nface. So, a number of people as I walked on the street and I didn\u2019t curtsey properly, it was\nreported to my mother, and I didn\u2019t see the poor person who was reporting me. Pictures,\nphotographs were taken of no glasses on, God forbid. It was awful. It was boring. It was\nterrible. I had to stand straight, and I slouch on the whole; I always did. And it was\nboring. It was horribly boring.",
        "Q: So, this was going in evenings.",
        "A: This was going on in evenings.",
        "Q: During the day-",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Or in the evenings when this wasn\u2019t happening-",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Are there people coming to your parents\u2019 house?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: Politicians coming and discussions about-",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: About what\u2019s going on-",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And are you able to-",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: At least observe, or can you participate?",
        "A: Oh, no, I\u2019m there.",
        "Q: You\u2019re there?",
        "A: I\u2019m there.",
        "Q: Can you talk about that?",
        "A: Yes. One of the things that\u2019s going on is you\u2019re listening to Radio Paris. Paris Radio had\na Yugoslav by the name of \u2014 I can\u2019t remember, but I do have his name written down \u2014 he\nwas \u2014 oh, Petrovic, Sveta Petrovic. He had one of these programs, like Voice of America\nhad later on, where he was broadcasting to Yugoslavia and railing against the Germans,\nand then when France fell, he went on \u2014 not to Vichy \u2014 he ended up in the United States,\nbut he followed the French government where he could \u2014 where he was broadcasting, and\nhe ended up in the United States, and I ended up doing translations for the censors here\nfor him, and when he was sick doing his broadcasts for the Royal Yugoslav government,\nwhich was very funny, you were listening to that. You were listening again on the radio\nto neutral radio stations, and there were family councils around the table, and friends.\nWhat\u2019s going to happen now that Hitler\u2019s about to get us all? But, you didn\u2019t know where\nand how. This was \u2014 these were family councils going on among the members of the\nfamilies \u2014 dining rooms or another. It was constant. And people who had lived in the\nprovinces, like the parents of these cousins that were in London, moved to Zagreb to be\nhandy to be able to leave if anybody was able to leave. The major problem was that there\nwere currency restrictions. You couldn\u2019t send any money out. The other problem was that\nmy father was a reserve officer, a captain first class, and he would have had to have\ngotten permission from the army to leave. They were sending mobilizations going on.\nThere wasn\u2019t mobilizing, but there was a \u2014 there was a state of alert, let\u2019s say. My father\n\u2014not my father, anybody, this wasn\u2019t anything exclusive \u2014 had to do every \u2014 I don\u2019t\nremember when you, probably, at various intervals, but at that time, I think, every two\nyears, you had to go and do some active duty as an officer. He was a reserve officer in the\nYugoslav army, and every once in a while, they would pull you for three months or six\nmonths or whatever to re- I don\u2019t know \u2014 to get them up, you know, to whatever was\ngoing to happen. To get them ready for necessary combat, and my father \u2014 this was\nprobably in 1940 \u2014 was in Split for three months doing his military duty, and I had\nnothing to do. So, I came to stay with him in Split, and that was very exciting, very nice\nfirst of all, nobody was supervising me. I was living in a hotel, and I would see him in the\nevening for dinner with the rest of the officers, which was also fun, I must say. One of the\nofficers, there, was the Imam of the Muslim soldiers because, you know, just behind the\nmountain is Bosnia, and there were number of recruits who were Muslim. And I\nremember on one occasion how aware they were of Hitler and anti-Semitism. The Imam\nsaying to my father, \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about anything, Fredo. If they come, I will say\nyou\u2019re Muslim. The main thing has been done already.\u201d So, you know, this 1s \u2014 this is\nwhat \u2014 I think that\u2019s sort of indicative of what the camaraderie was all among them.",
        "Q: Can you explain that because the people who are watching aren\u2019t going to know?",
        "A: Muslims and Jews are of circumcised. That\u2019s what it was.",
        "Q: And, the only men in Europe that who were...",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. Absolutely.",
        "Q: So, what were you doing during the day?",
        "A: Reading, writing letters to Joe Heaton.",
        "Q: So, you were still keeping up obviously this connection-",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: You\u2019re hearing from him?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Absolutely, absolutely.",
        "Q: Was he in Burma?",
        "A: No, he was first in England getting trained, and then he was in India for quite a long time.\nHe was camped in Peshawar, places like that. That was the summer.",
        "Q: That\u2019s very exotic.",
        "A: Yes, very exotic. In India, New Delhi and then, you know, when the heat got horrendous\nthey went to Northwest province, which was Kashmir, I guess.",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re not dating anyone else, right? At this point.",
        "A: Not, dating. I\u2019m going out, yeah, yeah. I\u2019m going out. Everybody knows. Everybody\nknows, but I do go to the darned balls and to coffeehouses and so on, but you know,\nmildly so.",
        "Q: But, now, you were able to spend time with your father alone without all of this social-",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you talk together about \u2014 is he telling you now that he\u2019s trying to figure out a way to\nget you all out?",
        "A: Not at that particular moment, but yes, we talked, because this group was trained to\nwithstand the Italian army, because, you know. Okay, so, obviously, I mean, we know\nwhat they\u2019re getting to, you know, to face. We did talk about it, sure. Then, as I\u2019m\nwalking along in Split looking at shop windows or whatever, maybe palaces, maybe\nDiocletian\u2019s Palace, something more cultural, my high school class turns up on their high\nschool graduation trip, and I joined them, and that was a rather amusing thing because I\nhave all of these dressy clothes. I was dressing 1n the evening in this hotel where they\nwere staying. So, I packed all of that up, and I left 1t with my father who then sent it to\nZagreb, and my father was on duty and a soldier was supposed to escort me to this third-\nclass bus that my class was riding in to go to Dubrovnik, and I made a little suitcase of\nsome kind or other, and this was like five o\u2019clock in the morning, five-thirty in the\nmorning, and suddenly there\u2019s this knock on the door. And I said, \u201cWho 1s it?\u201d in\nCroatian, and the man says, \u201cThe army.\u201d He was some kind of guy who was in \u2014 who my\nfather had sent to pick me up. So, this was the army that was getting me out of bed, and\nleft me there, and I joined this whole group, and then we finally got back to Zagreb on\nsome horrible third-class train, sleeping on the floor, as I was saying how they were\ndoing in Dubrovnik on mattresses on the floor, and that\u2019s what we did.",
        "Q: So, now do you think your father was in Split in 1940?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So, then, you go back to Zagreb.",
        "A: We go back to Zagreb.",
        "Q: Now, is there a sense in Zagreb now for you different from what it was the year before,\ntwo years before, as a Jewish person?",
        "A: Yes, very much.",
        "Q: And, what is that?",
        "A: And my father was very anxious for me to get out, and I know that I had papers. I know\nthat I had to get a piece of paper that said that I was unmarried, which I had notarized. I\nknow that I went to get a birth certificate, which I had translated and notarized \u2014\ntranslated into English and officially notarized to send to England, to have with me. And,\nI actually think that I had a Greek visa, if I\u2019m not mistaken, which \u2014 because Greece was\nnot invaded yet, to go, I guess, via Iraq or something, Turkey, via Iraq to India, which, of\ncourse, never took place, but I do remember getting a Greek visa, and a letter from the\nCounsel General. Those Counsel Generals are very interesting things. There are a number\nof honorary Counsel Generals who were Jewish, and one was a Greek. The other was\nPortuguese, who also gave me a visa, and the other was Uruguayan. These were all\nZagreb Jews, well off in CD cars.",
        "Q: CD?",
        "A: Corps diplomatique, CD on their cars. Diplomatic corp.",
        "Q: When I asked you that it was different for you as a Jewish person-",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: In Zagreb-",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Is that because you could feel a certain kind of anti-Semitism toward Jewish people?",
        "A: I did not feel it.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You just know?",
        "A: You just know. You feel completely surrounded by \u2014 you feel actually jailed. I mean,\nwhere are you going to go? You have to get out. I mean-",
        "Q: So, it\u2019s not that in Croatia-",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: It\u2019s that Croatia is being surrounded -",
        "A: Yes",
        "Q: And, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. Yugoslavia. In Croatia, you already started feeling that you didn\u2019t want to\nbe there when it happened.",
        "Q: Is? Or not?",
        "A: Yes, because I think that there must have been \u2014 there must have been intimations\nalready. I\u2019m not aware of it, but I do know that there must have been some people who\nwere quite happy with what was going on in Germany. I don\u2019t know a personal one. I do\nknow that I met, the day before I left in, let\u2019s say, the Yugoslav portugates (ph), the\nGerman on March 27\", and like on March 28\" or 29\", I was on the main square and\nI ran into two friends of mine from high school, two guys, and I said, \u201cGuys, we\u2019re\nleaving.\u201d Because, by that time, we already had our American visa and everything else,\nand one of them, who was a Communist, who later became director of the Zagreb theater,\nand the other one, who\u2019s father became director of the University under the Ustashe, were\nstanding there, these are my really close friends from school, and they said, \u201cNow you are\nleaving, when we need you?!\u201d I said, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to do without me.\u201d These people were\nactivists, but they didn\u2019t do anything, collaborated.",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019ll stop.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "Q: Lucie, tell me a little bit more about your meeting these two guys. What \u2014 they thought\nthat you would help them in terms of resisting what would happen?",
        "A: Exactly, exactly, they thought I would be very useful. They were both at that time very\nleft-leaning, not party members, but they were left-leaning, and they obviously knew that\nthings were going to happen now, and as I said, \u201cGuys, we\u2019re leaving,\u201d they said, \u201cNow?\nWhen we need you?\u201d \u201cSorry, Pve got to go.\u201d",
        "Q: Why would they have thought you would have been an activist? Was that something that\nyou gave inclinations of?",
        "A: I think so. I think they knew where my heart was, and they knew, I mean, obviously I\nwasn\u2019t a Communist. One of them may have been a member of the party at one time, but\nhe did \u2014 he served in the Croatian Ustashe army. The other one, the other one, whose\nfather was a very famous grammarian, we used his grammar, nowadays I think it\u2019s still\nprobably used. His name was Ivsic, became director in the Zagreb University, so, I mean\nthe University of Zagreb during Ustashe time, no.",
        "Q: So, you wouldn\u2019t call yourself left-leaning?",
        "A: Yes, yes, liberal, left-leaning, liberal left-leaning, okay, yes, yes.",
        "Q: So, you said prior talking to about this incident with the boys, that your father was\nengaged in trying to get you out. So, there must have been different plans that he was\nworking on.",
        "A: There were different plans. Well, I wanted to go and see Joe, but then everything \u2014 it got\nto be almost impossible as various frontiers were closing around us constantly. I mean,\nyou couldn\u2019t go through this, you couldn\u2019t go through that. Then, of course, the fact that\nhe could not have, I mean, my father could not have left the country without getting\npermission from the army. I mean, he was \u2014 they would activate you immediately, and he\nwould have had to get a permit from the army, plus you had to get a permit all together to\nleave the country, I mean, which was a great big do. People couldn\u2019t just say, \u201cWell,\ntomorrow, I\u2019m going to go to Vienna,\u201d or something. You had to get a slew of\ndocuments, and permits, and who knows what, not to mention absolutely no money\nwhatsoever.",
        "Q: You were not allowed to take money.",
        "A: You could not take any money out whatsoever, so what if not that?",
        "Q: Nothing.",
        "A: Nothing, not that. Very little, I think 1t\u2019s probably mentioned in the passports how much.\nI\u2019m not quite sure, but very little. So, the money, at one time, probably in 1941 probably,\n40, \u00b041, my father pro forma sold the big factory where, you know, also where the\ncountry house was to some business friends.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s Ljubljana or not?",
        "A: No, no, no, this is the place is called \u2014 it\u2019s near Zagreb and the village or where the\nfactory was is called Savski Marof, and that country house was called Janusevac, and he\nsold it to some friends in Ljubljana, some business friends in Ljubljana. In fact, I was just\nrecently going through some papers, I saw some stuff about that. And through somebody,\nI don\u2019t know how, he got some money to England, to Switzerland, and a little bit to the\nUnited States. I don\u2019t know how.",
        "Q: Now, you\u2019re saying he sold the factory pro forma, what does that mean?",
        "A: That means that he-",
        "Q: It appears to mean it\u2019s not a real sale.",
        "A: It was a sale with a thing, you know, \u201cWhen things calm down, I'll have it back.\u201d But he\ndid get the money for it.",
        "Q: He did?",
        "A: Yes, he got a serious amount of money, but oddly enough, he had taken a loan on my\nmother\u2019s house which was very valuable, not so much as, you know, a historical house,\nbut it was in the center of the center of town, and the land was very valuable, and he got a\nloan from the \u2014 he took a mortgage, that\u2019s what it is, a mortgage from the Zagreb Bank,\nthe city bank, and was getting ready to send up money somehow underground to the\nStates or to Switzerland or whatever, probably to Switzerland, but my mother said,\n\u201cListen, the president \u2014 I saw the president of the bank on the street, and he really didn\u2019t\ngreet me with as much\u2019, I hate to say deference, but that was the meaning, \u201cas usual.\nWould you return that loan?\u201d Which he did.",
        "Q: So, you knew that when you were \u2014 and you knew this at the time \u2014 that when you were\nleaving that there would be money in various places?",
        "A: Yes, but very little. I thought it was very little, and it was very little, but 1t was enough to\nsort of survive. There was some in Switzerland; that I know.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t really \u2014 no, go ahead.",
        "A: Why and how it was done, I really don\u2019t know, but there was enough to survive.",
        "Q: Now how did you, I mean, did you pack?",
        "A: Yes!",
        "Q: How did you do all this?",
        "A: Yes, the last month \u2014 okay, so we got this American visa which -",
        "Q: You wouldn\u2019t have survived \u2014 let\u2019s describe about that and then -",
        "A: Yes, yes. The Counsel General of the United States \u2014 the consulate was the house next to\nours in, I mean the office of the consulate, next to ours in Zagreb, the house. My father\nwas a hunter. He took the Counsel General hunting \u2014 it wasn\u2019t even the Counsel General,\nit was a Counsel, Mr. Miley, an American, nice middle-class person. My father took him\nhunting. He, I don\u2019t know, he saw in the back of our stable a \u2014 a suit of armor that was,\nyou know, put away, nobody was bothering with. He went crazy with the suit of armor.\nMy father gave him the suit of armor, which was cluttering things up, and I don\u2019t know\nhow authentic or \u2014 it was a suit of armor that probably was authentic, and he was very\nhappy to give us a visa. Now, one reason why this was going on was there were \u2014 as\nnobody could leave Yugoslavia \u2014 quotas \u2014 you know, the visas were given by country\nquotas at the time \u2014 were not being used in Yugoslavia. So, you had masses of quotas\nlying fallow in consulates, and it is very easy to get an immigration visa. And when my\nfather asked for the visa, and the man in the Counsel said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take an\nimmigration visa?\u201d And, my father said, \u201cWhat would I need an immigration visa for?\nI\u2019m going to return, obviously.\u201d And, he said, \u201cOkay, you\u2019 ll return, but take this\nimmigration visa. You never know when it might be handy.\u201d And we got an immigration\nvisa and that\u2019s how it worked. Oh, and at one time, I guess, he did him a favor because he\nbought his Buick. He got a new Buick at the Counsel, and we got his Buick.",
        "Q: His old one?",
        "A: His old one. It wasn\u2019t all that old, but it was certainly not for Yugoslavia, and he \u2014 this\nBuick was very significant, by the way, and he \u2014 so, you know, it was a friendship. It was\na \u2014 for maybe a year and a half, two years, they were \u2014 they went -",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t something very recent?",
        "A: No, no, no, it was a long-term thing that was going on at that time, and he \u2014 yes, okay, we\nhad that, but before that I was thinking we might be going, and that we didn\u2019t get the\nvisa, but they talked about the visa probably a month before that. So, in town, in Zagreb,\nthere were five or six trunks, you know, like \u2014 steamers, huge steamer trucks.",
        "Q: In the house?",
        "A: In the house, all the servants were there including the nanny, the present nanny,\neverybody was there. The dogs were there. There were three dogs running around in\ntown, not out in the country, and by the way, all the furniture and so on from the country\nhouse was in the basement of the house.",
        "Q: Of the house in Zagreb?",
        "A: In our house in Zagreb, yeah, that was taken out. When he sold the factory pro forma, he\ntook \u2014 an uncle of my mother\u2019s stayed in Janusevac, and was going to be running the\nfactory. They didn\u2019t do him in, but he stayed there. So, his furniture was there, but our\nfurniture from the bedroom and stuff like that, that was in the basement, taken by the\nGermans, by the way. Okay. And we were putting into these steamer trunks embroidered\nbed linen and tablecloths and stuff of that kind, could you imagine why we needed that,\nand clothing, four-station clothing. This was \u2014 I mean, four-season, four-season clothing,\nall sorts of junk like that. And then there were suitcases around, and this was all open\nstanding, being filled, so that when the Germans came, they had all packed together, they\njust took it out. It\u2019s amazing.",
        "Q: So, what did you all think? That this would be shipped out somehow?",
        "A: Yes, this would be shipped out. I mean, this is how this was going on with people who\nleft three weeks earlier. There were people who left earlier.",
        "Q: So, what happened -?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was you were within days of the invasion?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, we were days within the invasion. So, this must have been, let\u2019s say, a\nweek before the 27\" of March. That\u2019s about it, but when this happened, and when\nYugoslavia \u2014 they went in Belgrade, the populous starting spitting on the German flag.\nThey took the car of the German ambassador and knocked it over, and then I think they\nput it on fire, and they were yelling all sorts of slogans: \u201cBetter dead than a slave\u201d and\nthat kind of stuff, and in Zagreb there was jubilation.",
        "Q: Because of this tri-part agreement with, with German.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: March 25\"?",
        "A: That\u2019s \u2014 yes, it was March 25\", and on the 27\" was the putsch, yes, they abrogated \u2014 the\npeople abrogated, and on the 28\", we got into our car. We left everything there. We\npacked suitcases.",
        "Q: So, you had some little suitcases?",
        "A: We had \u2014 they weren\u2019t that little. There must have been quite a few because when I think\nabout what I dragged over like typewriters and riding boots, necessary things of that kind,\nand urban coats. [laughs]",
        "Q: Urban coats?",
        "A: An urban coat.",
        "Q: So, it was good it was a Buick with a big trunk.",
        "A: Yeah, and they were quite \u2014 yes, yes, I don\u2019t know big of a trunk. It was a very large car.\nIt was very large. My parents \u2014 so, then, we had the American visa, but my father didn\u2019t\nhave the permission from the army to leave yet, nor did he have an exit visa for\nYugoslavia, an exit permit from Yugoslavia. There\u2019s a piece in the passport, there\u2019s a\nCyrillic thing that says \u201cOfficial Visa\u2019, and he \u2014 and he had to have written in that he was\na delegate on the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, otherwise he couldn\u2019t have gotten\nout, but particularly not the army, because he would have been activated almost\nimmediately. So, we got into our car \u2014 my parents, my brother, I, my uncle \u2014 my father\u2019s\nbrother, who was a lawyer, Felix, and our driver who grew up in my father\u2019s family. His\nname was Josip Levac, who was part Volksdeutsche, but that was \u2014 he was never anti-\nSemitic or anything like that. His father was a cooper. He made barrels for my\ngrandfather\u2019s factory, and this man was schooled by \u2014 my father had him schooled and he\nwent with us to Belgrade. We went through my father\u2019s hometown, which was Slavonska\nPozega, which was where this man was from also, and my father had to report to the\nbarracks. As we drove into the town, we were stopped by the army, by some recruits, and\none stuck the gun into the car, not with the bayonet, but just the muzzle of the gun, and he\nsaid, \u201cLegitimacija\u201d\u2019. We gave him whatever, IDs and so on. So, I gave him my ID. My\nfather showed his army ID, said he was going to the headquarters there, I don\u2019t know\nabout the headquarters, but anyhow to the barracks because this is where he would have\nhad to report to, and when he saw the paper, he called out, \u201cAnybody more literate\naround here?\u201d I\u2019m sure he was illiterate, and couldn\u2019t read it. Okay, so, somebody more\nliterate came and he said, \u201cOkay.\u201d So, we waited for my father in the car while he went to\nthe barracks. I don\u2019t know whether my uncle went along or not. I don\u2019t think so, and\nSepa, I think went to, the chauffer, went to talk to somebody in his family was left over\nthere, and then we proceeded to Belgrade.",
        "Q: Excuse me, was there any doubt that your father would get permission?",
        "A: If they had felt that they wanted to be unpleasant, maybe he would have bribed\nsomebody. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know, but if they had wanted to be unpleasant, if he\nhadn\u2019t had \u2014 he probably had some other paper there that he showed them, that he was\ngoing to Belgrade to do something with \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine it any other way. He must have\nbeen, because it was very recently, he had just very recently done this, you know, training\nin Split not so long ago. And, you know, he probably would\u2019ve survived because all the\nprisoners of war survived, almost all, and just as aside, a friend of ours who was a\nSerbian officer, by the way, who\u2019s father was a general, his wife\u2019s father was general,\nand so on, was a prisoner of war in Germany, and he told me that the Jewish prisoners of\nwar and the Serbs and everybody were together and that one time, the Germans wanted to\nseparate the Jewish prisoners of war from the others, and these people went on strike and\ncalled the Red Cross and who knows what, and they left them together. And almost all of\nthem survived.",
        "Q: What is the atmosphere in the car?",
        "A: Horrendous, awful.",
        "Q: Are you really frightened?",
        "A: Frightened, because you could see things were about to start. We were listening to the\nradio. There were mobilizations. There was army all over, you know, you could see army\nleft and right as you went -",
        "Q: So, you were sure that the Germans -",
        "A: Oh, absolutely, absolutely, there was no doubt in our mind that something would happen.",
        "Q: Your one fear was that you wouldn\u2019t get out soon enough.",
        "A: Absolutely, that was the fear. Plus we had no visa to any country where we could have\ngone through. We had-",
        "Q: You just had the visa-",
        "A: We had the \u2014 no, we had the immigration visa \u2014 no! We got \u2014 oh, yeah, we had the\nimmigration visa. That was it. That was it.",
        "Q: But, you had no way to traverse -",
        "A: We had no other, no way to traverse. I think, if I look in the passport, that all of this was\nobtained in Belgrade, the various consulate and embassies and so on. So, when we came\nto Belgrade, first of all, we had the permission from the army, then they wrote in this\ndelegation thing that he was going as a delegate of the Ministry. Otherwise would have\nnot been able to get there. And we all got these official visas, because you didn\u2019t just get\na visa. You got an official visa. I know that my uncle \u2014 my uncle, I think had an affair\nwith the prime minister\u2019s \u2014 the prime minister\u2019s wife. He was all over the place. He was a\nvery, a popular guy, and had generally all sorts of connections. He was divorced first. He\nwas a likeable, nice guy who had connections, and I think he helped somehow hasten\nthings. We spent one horrendous night. There were two other members of the family, one\nor two \u2014 my aunt\u2019s husband was also a lawyer who was a businessman, who was there in\nBelgrade and I don\u2019t know why, and somebody else. And at the very last minute, we\nfound that there was an industrial or some kind of fair, either industrial fair or an\nagricultural fair or something like that in Budapest, and they were giving visas.",
        "Q: To be able to go?",
        "A: To be able to go, and this was the only \u2014 this was the only \u2014 the only place, the only\nborder you could cross. You couldn\u2019t go anywhere else. The Germans were in Greece\nalready, couldn\u2019t go through Bulgaria, couldn\u2019t go through Italy, couldn\u2019t go through\nAustria via Slovenia. This was the only way to go, and this was some kind of probably\nexcursion visa, I\u2019m not quite sure, but they were giving these visas because there was this\nfair. We spent the night in Belgrade, and the next morning \u2014 naturally Yugoslavia was\ncompleted mobilized by that time \u2014 and decided that the chauffer would help us with the\ncars and go with us to the Hungarian border, and then be able to report back to the family\nwhether we crossed or not. And in the train, my father wrote out an affidavit or\nsomething and said to the chauffer, who clearly was a member of the family, \u201cYou will\nneed to take care of your family. Use this car as a taxi or whatever you want.\u201d And he\ngave him all the papers, and the piece of paper and the letter in which he said that he\nshould take this car, which he did. [laughs] And the very first week, Artukovic, the\nCroatian minister of the interior became, I mean, he became his driver. The car was\nrequisitioned and he became his driver, and stayed with him until the very last, and didn\u2019t\ntell him that he was fleeing, and this poor guy was caught by the British, and Artukovic\ntook off to Argentina and finally ended up here.",
        "Q: So, he -",
        "A: He gets us-",
        "Q: To the train?",
        "A: To the \u2014 no, he gets us to the train, and he goes with us to the border, to the Hungarian\nborder on the train.",
        "Q: To say that the family-",
        "A: That we crossed, yes. At that time, there were German soldiers in the train \u2014 officers and\nsoldiers in the train already going towards Belgrade. There were troop trains.",
        "Q: You mean in the train station, not in your train?",
        "A: No, no, in the train station in Belgrade, this was total chaos, and there were recruits with\npeasants with their wives sitting on packages. I mean, you could hardly make a step. It\nwas total complete chaos. This was the mobilized peasantry that was going to be fighting\nthe Germans, all over the Belgrade station. No, he went \u2014 he left us on the Hungarian\nborder, when the train, just before the train crossed to Hungary. Now, there were German\nofficers on the train already going \u2014 I don\u2019t know where they were going \u2014 but there were\nGerman officers in jackets and everything going up and down in the train, but the war\nhad not been declared yet, and troop trains going in the other direction towards\nYugoslavia. And we arrived in Budapest, got into a nice hotel, and phoned Belgrade and\ntold them, \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d Meanwhile, tried to find out where other members of the family\nwere, the ones who were in Zagreb. Some were getting ready to go to Dubrovnik, which\nthey knew was going to be, if anything happened, it would be Italian, but they were not\nthere yet. Other members of the family stayed in Belgrade, and we talked to them when\nwe got to Switzerland. That night, maybe six hours later, they were bombed.",
        "Q: But, they wouldn\u2019t listen to you?",
        "A: No, no, no. They thought that we were-",
        "Q: They thought you were crazy.",
        "A: They thought we were \u2014 we called them from Budapest and we said, \u201cListen, this is what\nwe saw.\u201d And they said, \u201cYou\u2019re so in panic among us. Leave us alone.\u201d And so on, and\nthe same thing they said when we called them from Switzerland at midnight, and they\nwere bombed six hours later.",
        "Q: When you got to Budapest, you did not have papers for the next stage?",
        "A: I think we had.",
        "Q: You had?",
        "A: I think \u2014 I can look in the passport because I\u2019m thinking there are some \u2014 we went and we\nstayed two nights. We went to Vienna overnight, and those were not so hard to get. There\nwere transit visas to, I think that they, I don\u2019t know whether they still called it Austria,\nprobably Germany. It was Germany already, and we came in the middle of the night, and\nwe got to some kind of dreadful hotel near the railroad station. I know that they stole a\nsuitcase of my brother\u2019s, and immediately at dawn, we got on the train to Switzerland,\nbut did not make it to cross. We had to spend a night in Germany.",
        "Q: And your father was interrogated?",
        "A: And my father was interrogated for hours.",
        "Q: And this is at an inn that you\u2019re staying in?",
        "A: This is at an inn in Austria, right on the border.",
        "Q: And were there Germans in that Inn?",
        "A: There were Germans, German troops, and German officers in that inn, and they were\nsinging one of those lovely war songs about Prince Eugene, that\u2019s a boy, I guess, going to\nBelgrade conquering Belgrade. It\u2019s a march song. It\u2019s a march that we all knew, and it\u2019s\npart of \u2014 I\u2019m trying to think in which one of the classic \u2014 it\u2019s part of a classic composition\nthis is taken from. It\u2019s like a march.",
        "Q: Was your father brutalized?",
        "A: Not at all. He was questioned for a long time, very thoroughly, and as his German was\nvery good, I guess that was part of the thing. He said, \u201cWe are immigrating to the United\nStates, please. Here\u2019s my immigration visa.\u201d The war wasn\u2019t on yet, but I was a very\nthorough in- And my brother and my mother and I were sitting in this inn absolutely\nquaking with fear. It went on for hours.",
        "Q: And he was in the inn?",
        "A: Somewhere in the inn. They took him in the room, a bunch of German officers who came\nand knocked on the door when, you know, in the middle of the night. The way it was, my\nmother and I slept in one room. He and my brother slept in the other. So, he came to tell\nus, and then my brother joined us 1n this room and we waited there.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s change the tape.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "Q: So, was your father \u2014 we were talking about your father\u2019s interrogation.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was he interrogated all night?",
        "A: No, but some three hours at least.",
        "Q: So, it must have been just horrible for you.",
        "A: It was horrendous. We were terrified, and by that time, we had see these troops going. By\nthe way, Vienna, when we got there, was blacked out, and the windows were blacked out\nin the hotel, and so on. There was no light whatsoever. I don\u2019t know how we \u2014 it must\nhave been fairly close, this hotel, to the station because I have a feeling we walked there\nin the dark. We came at night and we left at dawn, and I remember just darkness, and\nthen \u2014 a blackout, a plain blackout.",
        "Q: Where was your Uncle Felix? Did he stay in Belgrade?",
        "A: At that time, he was in Belgrade, yes.",
        "Q: So, he didn\u2019t go with you?",
        "A: No, no, no, he just \u2014 he was in Belgrade, and he stayed in Belgrade.",
        "Q: And having this...relationship...?",
        "A: Yeah, probably just visiting around. I recently found \u2014 two days ago, three days ago \u2014 an\nincredible letter written by the person who was the Uruguayan Consul General who was a\nfriend of his and he tells of this story of how he and a couple of others were fleeing, and\nmy Uncle Felix was already in Italian territory going back because of some love interest\nor something like that, to Zagreb, and how they were jailed and so on.",
        "Q: Did Felix survive?",
        "A: Yes, he survived. He went \u2014 he went \u2014 he remarried. He went \u2014 why he came to the\nUnited States via Cuba, but first on some kind of Ellis Island, Cuban Ellis Island where\nhe spent, it was several months before they would let them out, but he did.",
        "Q: Before we get to Geneva, where you stayed for about a month-",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to ask what\u2019s going to sound like a funny \u2014 what happened to the dogs? You\nhad three dogs.",
        "A: I have absolutely no idea. Everybody, the whole staff was in the house. There was a cook.\nThere was a \u2014 two maids, the nanny.",
        "Q: They were all in the house?",
        "A: They were all in the apartment in Zagreb. They weren\u2019t even, you know -",
        "Q: So, you assume they took care of the dogs. Maybe.",
        "A: I hope so.",
        "Q: You hope so.",
        "A: Yeah, maybe it was Sepa, maybe the chauffer did. No, I hadn\u2019t heard anything. I had no\nidea what happened. I have no idea. There were two Dachshunds and an English Setter I\nbrought in the apartment.",
        "Q: I was a little concerned because -",
        "A: Oh, I was very concerned. I was very concerned. Somebody must have taken them in. I\nmean there were other people there who might have taken them. Somebody who was a\nhunter would have taken them. He was a very bad hunting dog, but he looked as if he\ncould do it.",
        "Q: Was it easy to get into Switzerland? There was no problem?",
        "A: There was a lot of frisking and stuff like that, quite serious.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes, and probably interrogation.",
        "Q: Probably interrogation?",
        "A: Interrogation also.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t experience this.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: It would\u2019ve been your father?",
        "A: My father and probably my mother. I think they \u2014 I think they searched her in various\nmanners.",
        "Q: Did they search you?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Amazingly no.",
        "Q: Because you\u2019re not a kid.",
        "A: I\u2019m not a kid. Nobody touched me, but my mother was searched, both in Spain-",
        "Q: And in Switzerland?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And how about Mario?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: But, he\u2019s-",
        "A: My mother was very embarrassed.",
        "Q: Oh I imagine. Do you begin in Switzerland, once you get through this interrogation-",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And you stay for a month in Geneva-",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Are you feeling a little bit more secure?",
        "A: Yes, yes, but not completely because, I mean, no. Our visa \u2014 our permit to be in\nSwitzerland would\u2019ve run out after a month. We would\u2019ve had to leave. Maybe it would\nhave been possible to prolong it somehow, but I don\u2019t remember how long our permit\nwas in Switzerland, but I \u2014 no, it was important to get going. Plus, the other visas\nwould\u2019 ve run out.",
        "Q: So, you didn\u2019t \u2014 you were in Geneva because your father was trying to get the next set of\npapers, or...?",
        "A: We were in Geneva. Well, first of all, we had to get a French visa. We had to go through\noccupied France which was in a car, which was locked, sealed. It was a sealed car.",
        "Q: A sealed train car?",
        "A: A sealed train car, yeah.",
        "Q: By the way, what was it like in Geneva for that month?",
        "A: We were in a very nice hotel. We were in the Hotel d\u2019 Angleterre which was lovely, but it\nwas very tense. It was extremely tense.",
        "Q: So, here your father had some money.",
        "A: Yes, and there were some people who we knew in Switzerland who had left earlier, who\nwere in the lumber business, and I don\u2019t know what kind of nationality they had, possibly\nthey had some other nationality, not Yugoslav. They were there. My mother\u2019s cousin who\nwas this Baroness de Vateville, who was in \u2014 who lived in Lucerne at the time, my\nmother called her and she came to Geneva in a women\u2019s Swiss Auxiliary uniform\nspeaking Switzer Dietch. It was very funny to hear, but was very helpful. She came and\noffered to help in any way. I don\u2019t know what kind of help it was.",
        "Q: Phone calls?",
        "A: I forgot, naturally. The night that we arrive and called Belgrade at midnight of April 5\"\nor 6\" and speak to the family, and they say everything is quiet, we shouldn\u2019t be crazy.\nSix hours after that they were bombed. This was the first time that I saw my father cry.\nWhen the whole army, everything, collapsed right away. There was no more Yugoslavia.\nI mean, this was such a Blitzkrieg there that this all went to pieces and was really in bad\nshape. I was very happy I was going to go to wherever \u2014 India, or \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to have\nanything to do with that anymore. I wanted out. My mother was very sad, but I don\u2019t\nthink she cried, but my father actually cried, and then the next thing he did, he went to\nBern to talk to the representative of Yugoslavia, and nobody knew what to do. I mean, it\nwas completely unclear what, you know, what was going to happen to Croatia. Not\nCroatia, I mean, what was going to happen, one way or another. It was still Yugoslavia,\ncompletely falling apart, and there was very little news except the bombing Belgrade,\nnothing else. And, then later on, we found out, when we went on, we saw what was\nhappening. When an independent Croatia was declared, but that was later. We went on\nthis sealed train, came to Spain, and at first \u2014 this was very shortly after the Spanish Civil\nWar \u2014 we stayed in a very nice hotel, but it was very obvious that this was very obvious\nthat this was a country that had gone through a war, and it was completely obvious. Crazy\nthing, here we want to go to the Prado, first time we were in Spain, but the Prado is\nclosed. So, we go sit in a caf\u00e9 to have breakfast and there\u2019s some rolls, but it\u2019s obvious\nthat there was a war. I mean, it looked shabby, and then children without limbs started\ncoming to the window of this caf\u00e9 and we\u2019re sitting there having food and asking for\nfood. This was the first time I had seen a country \u2014 I mean, this was a very short time\nafter the civil war in Spain, and these children \u2014 this was the saddest thing about war \u2014\nwithout an arm or without a leg, just holding their hands up, and emaciated, and so we\ntook all the food and gave it to them and walked away. You couldn\u2019t sit and eat because\nof what was going on. We sat pretty much, and walked around a little bit through Madrid,\nbut it was very sad, and it was very empty, and it was very obvious that they had gone\nthrough a war. Then we went to Barcelona and spent a couple of nights in Barcelona and\nwe got on this horrendous bus that got us to Lisbon, and there, I think, we became very\nmuch aware of things are falling out because we didn\u2019t go to a very fancy hotel. We went\nto some kind of pension. It was very nice, but it wasn\u2019t a palace hotel in any place.",
        "Q: Now, are you at all feeling a certain kind of ambivalence? On one hand, happy getting\nout-",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And on the other hand, a certain kind of sadness?",
        "A: Totally, totally, and also you had this feeling in Lisbon, Portugal that this is the spy\ncapital of the world. It was very \u2014 it was eerie. You didn\u2019t know who you could talk to.\nPeople would approach you and say, \u201cI\u2019m going to get you a prolongation of your visa.\nAre you interested? You\u2019re going to get a ticket on such-and-such a ship to go hither and\nyon.\u201d It was bad. And we walked around, but it was a beautiful town we had never been\nto. In Lisbon, we walked around. I have pictures of all dressed up in suits and hats and\nthe works.",
        "Q: So, you have all your luggage.",
        "A: All the luggage, all of that is standing around, yeah. We\u2019re wearing spring suits. I think\nthere\u2019s even a picture of my mother with a fur boa or something like that, a dead fox on\nher. I think so. I\u2019m almost certain. And my brother and I walking there. There were really\nsome quite unsavory characters that would come and ask him, and they\u2019d be helpful in\nthe hotels and everything. But we then started doing some traveling around, and you\nknow, and first of all, we had \u2014 okay, the United States maritime union was having a\nstrike. So, United States\u2019 ships were not going anywhere, and we had reservations on\nsome sort of ship, but || American export. Nothing was else was going on in the rest of\nthe country, I mean, the rest of Europe except for Portugal was at war. So, there were no\nneutral things except Portugal and, I guess, the United States that had ships going back\nand forth to the States. So, there was this maritime strike, and we had to stay longer, and\nthere was danger of, again, our Portuguese visa running out.",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re there for how long? Days? Weeks?",
        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014 three weeks.",
        "Q: Three weeks?",
        "A: Not many. So, my father goes to the consulate or whatever, whatever the Yugoslav\nrepresentation there is, and the poor person who is in charge of it, first of all, whoever\nwas a Croatian employee quit and went to free Croatia, or thought they were \u2014 anyhow,\nthey quit the Yugoslav Consulate, but there still the Yugoslav Consulate. There was a \u2014\nwhat is the insurrection of sailors called, there\u2019s a word for it?",
        "Q: That\u2019s right. It\u2019s a mutiny.",
        "A: Mutiny. There\u2019s a mutiny on Croatian ships that are in the harbor in Lisbon because,\nnaturally, the sailors are Croats. They\u2019re not Serbs. So, these are all Dalmatian Serbs. By\nthat time, there\u2019s a \u2014 those Ustashes have gotten to Zagreb, and it\u2019s obvious what\u2019s going\nto be in Zagreb. So, they went back. They went with their ships. So, this poor person has\nnobody to talk to because, obviously, there\u2019s not \u2014 no connection, no telephone, no\nnothing to Yugoslavia, or ex- Yugoslavia, and so he\u2019s having this conversation with my\nfather. What can he do with this mutiny? This mutiny? And my father said, \u201cLet them go.\nWhat are you going to do with them? You can\u2019t hold them there.\u201d So, he said, \u201cOkay.\u201d\nSo, they took off. The next thing -",
        "Q: Not with the ship?",
        "A: With the ship. They took everything and went back to Croatia.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: As far as I know. I mean, this is \u2014 this is the way it was decided. They were taking the\nship, and they were \u2014 there were a couple of them, I think. I\u2019m not quite sure. Then, they\nhad no money to pay whoever was employed there. No money from Yugoslavia. I don\u2019t\nknow what happened to the rest. So, my father lent him, I think, $500 to pay off the staff.\nThere was some Croats 1n the staff, no doubt, but most of them wanted to go back. For all\nI know, he was a Croat, but maybe not.",
        "Q: But your father is known enough so these people know-",
        "A: No, he goes \u2014 he walks in and he\u2019s got an official visa in his pocket, and-",
        "Q: Of course, he\u2019s a representative of the transport and commerce, right?",
        "A: Yes, yeah, yeah. And so, they have a conversation. So, he gives \u2014 and I have the receipt. I\nrecently found it under the papers. It was little. I think it\u2019s $500, plus a letter which asks\nthat we take along when we get to the ship, a \u2014 well, when we get transportation, to take\nalong a Persian carpet for the representative of Yugoslavia in Washington, D.C., who was\na guy by the name of Protasce (ph) at the time, which I think I saw on one occasion when\nthere still was a Yugoslavia, which we took along. Then, we found somebody who got in\ntouch with us, a family of a French diplomat. I guess it was a small place, and people\nheard who was where, or maybe this Yugoslav woman who I\u2019m going to talk to you\nabout now heard that \u2014 must have gone to the Yugoslav Embassy or Yugoslav\nRepresentation to talk about what\u2019s going to happen to her, and so on. She was married to\na, I think, the cultural attach\u00e9 of France in Portugal, and he was supposed to go back to\nFrance, and they had a little boy. She was originally from Zagreb, and her sister\u2019s\nhusband worked for my father in the yeast factory, the alcohol and yeast factory. And in\nfact, I was wearing a jacket that her sister, who was a weaver, had woven the material for.\nI used that for a long time. And we took this child, and took it to his godparents who were\na Yugoslav \u2014 a Croatian Jew by the name of Alexander and his Russian non-Jewish wife\nwho were in New York already for a year.",
        "Q: So, you had added-",
        "A: We added some, so then there were-",
        "Q: Five of you?",
        "A: Five of us in the cabin plus the rug, maybe not the rug. It may have been somewhere else.",
        "Q: So, this SS Sibornay was the ship...",
        "A: Sibonay, yes.",
        "Q: And what country is the ship from?",
        "A: US, US Export Line. The strike was over.",
        "Q: It was over?",
        "A: The strike was over",
        "Q: And that was the original ship you were supposed to go on?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but it was probably a United States export line ship because they were\ndoing this traverse. It was full of all sorts of flotsam and jetsam from Europe on the ship,\nand then the consul from Pavelic, from Bern and his American wife were also on the\nship. They came later. I mean, they came to Portugal later. So, we had somebody to have,\nto sit at the table with. When we got to Bermuda, it was quite, I mean, there were German\nU-boats there, and they were trying to avoid the U-boats, but the United States was\nneutral. So, we got to Bermuda. The British got on the ship and took off a bunch of\npeople.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, German spies, they said, and so on, maybe 10, 15.",
        "Q: How many people are on the ship with you?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know. It was a big ocean liner, and there was interrogation\nthen. The British looked at all of our passports and so on, but there was no problem\nwhatsoever. They took off a number of people. Some, probably, were perfectly honest,\ndecent people. In fact, one was a German leftist, who then found us in New York. So,\nthey must have obviously let him go.",
        "Q: Now, was the route to go to Bermuda, or they went to-",
        "A: No, no, I think 1t was \u2014 I think it was \u2014 no, they were avoiding probably. I don\u2019t know,\nbecause the only thing that happened in Bermuda 1s that these \u2014 that these British\nofficers-",
        "Q: Interrogated people.",
        "A: Yeah, boarded and interrogated people. And, then, it wasn\u2019t there too long, two hours.",
        "Q: I see, and then-",
        "A: And then directly in New Jersey, Hoboken, I believe.",
        "Q: Hoboken?",
        "A: I believe so, but definitely New Jersey.",
        "Q: Did you see the Statue of Liberty?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You did? Was that great?",
        "A: It was great, and we did not go to any Ellis Island or anything like that. United States\nimmigration people came on board, and interrogated us on board, as I remember.",
        "Q: So, you disembark?",
        "A: We disembarked in New Jersey, got into a taxi, and went into the tunnel, which was very\nimpressive to go through, and my father was saying, \u201cThis 1s under the Hudson which\nwe\u2019re going now.\u201d It was very exciting. We went to 57\" Street and 6\" Avenue to the\nHotel Salisbury, where they had sort of apartments, small, you know.",
        "Q: They had an apartment already?",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t. Actually, yes, because my uncle\u2019s divorced wife had married a Czech\nwho was a schoolmate of hers, and they were in the hotel next door, which is something\ncalled the, next door also on 57\" Street, something like \u2014 not the Berkshire, but\nsomething like that. Also, on 57\" Street between 6\" and 7\" Avenue. There was a\nwonderful automat, Horn and Hardart, where you could put money in and you could get\ncoffee or cocoa and it would go into a cup from out of the wall.",
        "Q: Could you imagine trying to do this without money?",
        "A: No. Maybe yes, up to \u2014 yes, but with a lot of difficulty, probably no Hotel d\u2019 Angleterres\nin Geneva and-",
        "Q: But, your father was also prominent enough that he knew people and he could get a\ncertain recourse that most people couldn\u2019t get.",
        "A: Yes, yes, sure. A lot of \u2014 of course, there were a lot of people including very good friends\nof ours who had children already outside the country. This is a rather interesting thing.\nThis was a very prominent Jewish family. In fact, at one time, the father was the head of\nthe Jewish community in Zagreb, and he had two daughters living in South Carolina, in\nDillon, South Carolina, planted paprika.",
        "Q: Paprika?",
        "A: Paprika, because you couldn\u2019t get any paprika from Hungary anymore so this was the\nbusiness, and they had gone a year earlier to the United States to find out what, you\nknow, where paprika could be \u2014 what would be the best land and climate for paprika and\nthat was Dillon, South Carolina, and they had a paprika plantation, believe it or not. And\nthese parents \u2014 although, my father went to before we left, and they had two daughters\nand family, they could\u2019ve easily come along. People were afraid. These people could\u2019ve\ndone it, and other people that I know could have easily done it, and thought, \u201cOh, no,\nwe'll get out.\u201d So, it was quite strange how this functioned. More people definitely could\nhave helped themselves. I\u2019m not saying young people who had no money, but there were\nvery prominent Jewish and non-Jewish families that could\u2019ve done it.",
        "Q: Was it easy for you to adjust to the United States?",
        "A: I think it was in the beginning. Later on, no.",
        "Q: Later on, no\u201d?",
        "A: Later on I became \u2014 at first, you know, we\u2019re in a hotel that had a kitchenette and a\ncloset. We thought this was absolutely wonderful. We went to a five and ten and bought \u2014\nmy brother and I went to buy things with, you know, with flowers on it, for heaven\u2019s\nsakes, mugs with flowers. We\u2019d never seen it. I thought this was terrific, like four spoons\nand so on. And then my father decided before we moved \u2014 we then moved later on to\nRiverdale, in New York, and my brother went to school there for some time. Fieldstone\nSchool, I think it was called. He bought a car.",
        "Q: Mario?",
        "A: No, my father bought a car. No, Mario, the first summer, was sent to camp in Maine, and\nwe bought a car and got a chauffer, and traveled through New England.",
        "Q: Fabulous.",
        "A: That was fabulous, and then finally when we came back we took apartment. But I\nremember buying the car and having to pay cash because our, whatever account we had,\nbank account was blocked because we were aliens probably.",
        "Q: You're illegal aliens?",
        "A: I think so, for a little bit.",
        "Q: When is your brother \u2014 we have to stop the tape.\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "Q: You came to the United States in 1941. Did you get here in May or June?",
        "A: May.",
        "Q: Now, your brother is still at home.",
        "A: Oh, wait a minute, I\u2019m trying to think, I think 1t would have been early June or May,\nmaybe like you know the manifest is there. We can see it.",
        "Q: Is your brother \u2014 does he volunteer to go into the army?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But are you US citizens?",
        "A: No, but he became as soon as he joined the army, almost immediately.",
        "Q: Was your family wanting him to, or was it okay?",
        "A: It was obvious that they were going to recruit him anyhow.",
        "Q: Even as a foreigner?",
        "A: Yes, and at the time when he got him, he was told to change his name. He was going to\nbe sort of an interpreter, but never was anything. He died in, near Sainte-Me\u00e9re-Eglise,\nwhich was horrible battle in Normandy. He was in Texas and New Jersey and so on, 1s\nwhere he got his basic training, and it \u2014 whoever his officer was said, \u201cListen, 1t would be\na good idea if you changed your name because they can find out this way. It won\u2019t be so\nobvious right away.\u201d And he did, and then my uncle changed his name also, Felix to\nSorel. And I don\u2019t know why because this name, what\u2019s not clear to me is because when I\nwas doing the broadcasting to Yugoslavia, sort of a women\u2019s program, whether I first\nused Sorel, whether my brother first used Sorel, I don\u2019t remember. It was one way like\nthat, except all my friends who heard knew \u2014 it was in Yugoslavia.",
        "Q: And, when did you get the job with Voice of America?",
        "A: That was a fairly interesting thing. There was no Voice of America when I joined. It was\nsomething that was sort of a precursor of OSS, and there was something called, I believe,\nthe analysis section, and I looked at the papers, and I think it was \u201943 maybe, and I was\ndoing some research in \u2014 language research \u2014 at the library in New York, and then there\nwas a Balkan desk where, again, I wasn\u2019t doing much. I was doing translations and\nnothing much. Then, this guy that I told you that was doing the broadcasting from Paris\noriginally, was doing broadcasting in \u2014 it wasn\u2019t even Voice of America, I think it was\nstill part of Coordinated Information, if I\u2019m not mistaken, 1s what it was called. But they\nhad broadcasting facilities. So, from the same place where Voice of America was, he was\nbroadcasting there, and I was translating it into English for the censors. Then, the man got\nsick, and I was the one who was broadcasting, and I had to end the \u2014 I said who I was\nbecause they knew who he was and so on, and I said I was broadcasting in his name, and\nit ended up, \u201cMay God save King Peter forever. May God save forever King Peter of\nYugoslavia.\u201d This was for about six weeks or so, I believe, I was doing it, and then\nfinally something like the Balkan desk was established which was under \u2014 the chief was\nan Albanian, of all things, then there was some Greeks who had been \u2014 they were been\nshuttled back and forth, and I don\u2019t think that we actually broadcast as Voice of America\nin Serbo-Croatian until \u201944 probably, and so that\u2019s that.",
        "Q: So, are you doing this work at the same time that Mario went into the army?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And, how did you \u2014 when did you and your parents hear about this? Was it soon after the\n?",
        "A: Very soon. My mother was at home alone, and a Western Union person came in.",
        "Q: Western Union?",
        "A: Western Union came with a telegram, and I remember I was at the hairdresser after work,\nand I called to say, \u201cI\u2019m coming home. I\u2019m sorry, do you need anything along the way?\u201d\nThen we were living on 102\u2122 and Riverside Drive, and she said, \u201cThis man just handed\nthis.\u201d So, my father was in the mustard business in Brooklyn, and \u2014 which was quite a\nstrange thing, and he came home. It was horrendous. It was horrendous. I can\u2019t tell you\nhow horrendous. On the other hand, it was happening all over. There were several\nfamilies, friends of ours, who had lost, in the States, sons. So, it was in the middle of this\nwhole dreadful trauma for everybody. We weren\u2019t the one that was picked out as the only\none to live through, you know, badly. The training that they had, I don\u2019t even know how\nlong the basic training was, and he was in Germany \u2014 in Britain for a while, and he wrote\na letter that made us know where he was, and he\u2019s buried in Saint-Laurent, you know,\nthat big cemetery.",
        "Q: Have you gone?",
        "A: Oh, several times. I went, the first time I went there, it was still only wooden markers, no\nMogen David there, and then there was one British person who was an administrator, and\nthen of course, it went on to became this super, huge, enormous cemetery which has lost\nsome. I mean, in a way that more moving and impressive, and in another way, it\u2019s less,\nbecause this was, so to speak, raw earth, just lines and lines of wooden crosses, and with\nnames on them, that\u2019s all there was. And then we lived in France in the \u201960s. So, we went\nseveral times. This was a decision my parents made, especially my father. He said, \u201cYou\nknow this will be a grave that will be taking care of. It will not depend on whether you\u2019re\npaying some kind of duty, or somebody should be there to watch this.\u201d And I think it was\na very good decision.",
        "Q: Rather than bringing him home.",
        "A: Yes, because friends of ours did, and that was better for them, and I also have a feeling\nmaybe my father wanted to save my mother more trauma. I think my mother was closer\nto my brother, then \u2014 not closer to him than to me. In a way, I think, she was closer\nbecause we were women, but this was the carrier of the name. So, that counted, and it\nwas an extremely macho society, Yugoslavia, not only, I mean, for everybody, for all\npeople, for all Jews and for everyone, Serbians.",
        "Q: So, in some ways he was more important?",
        "A: Oh, yeah, absolutely. I think maybe I was closer to my father. All together, he was, and\nit\u2019s crazy to say \u201cmama\u2019s boy\u2019, because that\u2019s not, you know, in that sense, but I think he\nwas more \u2014 I think he was independent. I don\u2019t know, maybe because I was older. I have\nno idea. Maybe, because he was better looking than me. He was very good looking\nperson, and I was, for a while there, a very thin child with glasses who was sloppy, and\nthat kind of thing. He was a good looking young man. So, I think \u2014 for a child, and they\nfed him well, and he got round, and I was always scrawny at that time. So, you know. I\nthink that may have been part of it. And Yugoslavia was a country where women walked\nbehind the donkey while their husbands rode. I won\u2019t say in our society, but underlying\nthat. It carries over.",
        "Q: Did it affect your father the way it did your mother?",
        "A: I think it affected my \u2014 my father was a soldier through four years or more, and he knew\nof the horrible possibility existed, and I mean, he didn\u2019t sit in an office during World War\nI. He was in the Russian front among going on, this, that and the other came out.\nAnd, horrible as it is, I think in a way it may have been an interesting experience for him.\nHe told a story which has nothing to do with this, but I just want to mention it. When he\ngot \u2014 I guess this must have been on the Russian/Polish border somewhere, he said that a\nman came to him who was in the Russian army and surrendered, and said that I\u2019m Jew\nsoldier (ph), and so he -my father took him home to Pozega along with his horse, and the\nman stayed I don\u2019t know how long with the family as a prisoner of war. So, he was in a\nnice regiment, hunter\u2019s regiment with nice uniforms, and so on. Although, he was in\ntrenches, and he knew how horrible \u2014 I think it\u2019s a different experience to them than to\nUS.",
        "Q: So, when did you hear about Joseph?",
        "A: He was missing in action for more than a year, the poor soul. We kept writing to each\nother, and suddenly there was no, nothing anymore.",
        "Q: He was writing to you-",
        "A: I was in New York. We were in New York. We were writing practically daily in New\nYork, and there was no answer, and then finally, the mother wrote me, and his insurance\npolicy was written for me, which I find incredible, I mean, they needed it probably less\nthan we did. Maybe he felt I was here, the poor refugee sitting in New York, which was\ntrue, but he made it out to me, and the mother heard \u2014 no, first he was missing in action\nfrom both of us were writing back and forth. Finally, my parents were sending food to\nEngland to her because she was in horrible shape at the time. She married a Colonel\nEnzeing (ph) of all names, and his brother, they couldn\u2019t find him, his brother. He was\nmissing in action. His brother went to look for him, in Burma, and they recognized him\nby his boots a year later in the jungle. This was \u2014 my brother\u2019s death and all of that was at\nthe same time, at about the same time. It was about the same time. For a year, more than\na year, he was missing in action, and something called the Duke of Wellington\u2019s\nregiment, and this is also bizarre to think of.",
        "Q: And, when the war was over, were there any relatives alive?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: In Zagreb?",
        "A: In Zagreb, or in Croatia, far off. Some came back. Some were in camps in Italy. Others\nhad gotten from Italy to Latin America. Here\u2019s another very, very interesting thing about\n\u2014 they were helped by a group of monks, not monks, but religious, an order that was\ncalled San Rafaele, that was formed to help refugees. They help Jews. They helped\nUstashe. They helped Germans. They helped everyone. That was their job, and these\npeople took their passports to Zagreb. The Uruguayan consul had left who was Jewish,\nand was fleeing, and this is the letter I just found of eight pages, left the official seal with\nhis secretary and this order carried the passports to Zagreb under their robes, had them\nstamped, brought them back to Rome, because they had these, they were given exit visas\nfrom Italy and transit visas from Spain. That was my father\u2019s sister, husband, daughter\nand then the young man that she fell in love with and they finally married, and my uncle\nFelix somehow went to Cuba, where he sat in a sort of a holding camp because I guess\nthey didn\u2019t feel like letting people out or couldn\u2019t get enough money out of them. He\nfinally came to the States, and actually my father visited him and he had a Cuban visa at\nthat time, in \u201944 or \u201945. I think it\u2019s stamped in his passport, and then finally Felix got\nmarried to an Italian Jewish woman who was a scientist, and then they ended up in\nCaracas, Venezuela.",
        "Q: Is there anything more you\u2019d like to tell us about your experiences? I know you have a\nfull life afterwards which we can\u2019t go into now.",
        "A: No, of course. A wonderful husband who I met. He was working in Belgrade \u2014 actually,\nit was not Voice of America, it was the United States Information Agency, he established\nthe office for them in Belgrade. Before that, he was an Albania during the war \u2014 Italy,\nAlbania and so on, and we met at Voice of America. He came back to tell us how we\nwere getting, you know, how we were accepted and heard and so on. And we got\nmarried. We have two daughters. We\u2019ve lived all over the place. We lived in Venezuela\nfor I don\u2019t know how many years, six maybe, seven. Then, we came back to New York.\nWe went to Mexico, and then we had 11 years in Paris, then went back to Mexico, and\nnow we\u2019ve been here since \u2014 it\u2019s 14 years?",
        "Q: You were married in 1949.",
        "A: No, before that, \u201947, yeah, and I got my citizenship without him. I had been here the\nlength of time. I didn\u2019t get it \u2014 1t wasn\u2019t any shorter because I had married an American\ncitizen. I got it on my own. I\u2019m very pleased with that.",
        "Q: So, when did you become an American citizen?",
        "A: On the nose, five years after I came here, exactly, \u201946.",

        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Can you describe this?",
        "A: This is Zagreb, and the address is Jelacic Trg, which means Jelacic Square, which is the\nabsolute center of town, and this original house in front, which is the oldest house on that\nsquare, was built somewhere in the 1840s, maybe 1850, a very famous architect called\nFeldinger. When they started building it, Jews were still not allowed to have houses\nwithin the confines of the city, and then after that, by the time they finished, it already\nwas built and my great-grandfather lived there. It was built for two families.",
        "Q: And this picture?",
        "A: This picture is Janusevac, which is our country house built somewhere in the 1840s, and\nSo on, we were one of the last owners, I suppose, and it\u2019s about 15 miles from Zagreb.\nWe stayed there as long as there was no school. Let\u2019s say we stayed there from April\nthrough October, but as there was no central heating, we then went to town and lived on\nJelacic Trg.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And this is the entrance hall of Janusevac, and these two bronze vases or whatever they\nare, are actually from China. This came from somebody, I don\u2019t know, friends whose\nparents were there during the Boxer Rebellion, brought it back, and I don\u2019t know how\nthey came into the family, and in the middle is this round room which we used to call the\nchapel, which \u2014 we called it the chapel because there was a \u2014 not organs, but a\nharmonium \u2014 were there, and it had a nice cupola. As children we used to dance there\nmostly.",
        "Q: This?",
        "A: This is what we used to call the chapel, a round room, and I guess we used to call it the\nchapel because it was there big musical instrument that\u2019s normally in churches, and from\nthat door over leads to a drawing room which is where the piano was, and it led to the\nbalcony, the front balcony.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: This was the main drawing room, I guess. There was some original frescoes up there, but\none of them was missing so, one of them is false. There\u2019s nothing there now. Maybe\nsome shelves. I think my father had them restored, and had one of these painted\noriginally, the one on top maybe \u2014 I have no idea who the painter was of these paintings.\nThis particular stove was from my grandmother\u2019s house in town. I don\u2019t know when it\nwas brought to Janusevac. I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: This is my bedroom, and this is a portrait of my mother at age 17, and that\u2019s the only\nthing that exists. The portrait disappeared and that\u2019s all gone, and there\u2019s a wooden saint\nthere \u2014 I believe it was Saint Christopher. As I said, that\u2019s my bedroom. You can even see\nthe salon, look at that. [New picture] This is the house. This is what the country house\nlooked like after the war. According to one story \u2014 we know that the Germans kept\nammunition in the cellar, and we\u2019re told that they exploded this when they were\nretreating. On the other hand, others said that the Ustashe did it, but who knows? And,\nafter the war, there were fewer and fewer, and fewer bricks because they insisted on\nrebuilding it unnecessarily for my taste, after the war, and the peasants needed to get their\nhouses fixed. So, they just went and got all of the bricks. So, finally they had to build a\nbrickyard to rebuild it, which I think was ridiculous, and now it is apparently an archive\nof the city of Zagreb. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s inside. Dora was there. She was the last one\nthere, and it\u2019s all painted up.",

Behind me is my\nmother, on the left \u2014 no, okay, this is Dragon Mauntner who was killed by the Nazis very\nearly on.

My father gave him this\ncar when we left Yugoslavia, and he became the driver of Artukovic, the Minister of\nInterior for Croatia and he was forced to do that. [New picture] This is my brother Mario\nSternberg who was killed in Sainte-M\u00e9re-Eglise in Normandy, obviously an American\nsoldier. He was three years younger than I was, and I think this was the one formal\npicture we had of him in his uniform.",

When he was working for the United States\ngovernment abroad, they were meant to wear a uniform and they hand sewn-on ranks of\ncaptain and so on, 1n case they were captured because they were working in Belgrade and\nso on, and the Germans were still around. He was 32 or 33 years old, and then worked for\nthe Office of War Information, and later became a journalist. mostly with the Associated\nPress.",

        "A: Lucie Carol Rosenberg.",
        "A: My father\u2019s name was Manfred Sternberg. My mother\u2019s name was Lili. Her maiden name\nwas Prister, P-r-i-s-t-e-r. He was from Slavonska Pozega, which was a rural part of\nCroatia, and my mother was from Zagreb and her family was an old Zagreb family that\nhad originally come from what is now Italy and 1s the extreme border that really is on the\nother side of Radiska and Achilea (ph), and places like that.",

I don\u2019t\nthink that he was a particularly inventive or artistic or whatever, but he was a work-a-day\narchitect who always kept his profession, whereas the rest of his family was spending\nmoney like crazy and ended up paupers, many of them, after spending money like mad in\none direction or another. He was always working.",
        "A: My father was an industrialist. I think mostly agricultural. Croatia obviously was a very\nagricult \u2014 mostly, 80 percent agricultural country, and he had alcohol \u2014 and he had an\nalcohol yeast factory which was a very large one, and probably the largest in that part of\nCroatia, and a number of other agricultural refineries and so on.",
        "A: Well, yeast obviously, you know, is made - these we were almost monopolies because\nthere were certain ones, I mean, not many people were producing yeast for making bread.\nAgricultural alcohol means that they would take beets, you know, various corn, for\ninstance, and so on, and it would be refined as alcohol. And for a while, as a matter for\nfact, in Croatia, there was a law where you had to mix alcohol with gasoline, which is\nwhat they\u2019re doing here now, and this was always very protected because there were\nhuge, huge taxes otherwise. But being as it was agricultural, any kind of agricultural stuff\nwas protected by the government because it was sort of beneficial to the state or\nwhatever, or the peasantry or whatever. So, obviously there were lots of land where some\nof this raw material was produced, but also was bought from the peasants as needed. The\nyeast was, you know, shipped around and so on.",

        "A: Yes, but my mother supervised. One of my very early memories was of a German nurse\nwith a \u2014 who were dressed like nuns, and had this long veil. They were special children\u2019s\nnurses. And she was unusually unpleasant, and put me apparently into a dark room, and I\ndo remember that, and the cook saved \u2014 me upstairs, started screaming and the woman\nwas let go immediately, and then there was, I guess, when my brother was born, there\nwas a peasant nanny that came and until my brother\u2019s maybe five, this was there. Then I\ngot an English governess, Miss... her name was... because the second one \u2014 the first one\nwas called Miss \u201cMees Smees\u201d \u2014 Miss Smith \u2014 she was known \u201cMees Smees\u201d\u2019,, who was\nwith us for maybe six months. My brother was throwing tantrums and \u2014 because he\ncouldn\u2019t stand her, and then the nanny came back for \u2014 and stayed forever as part of the\nhousehold. And then there was a Swiss person who was quite unpleasant for about six\nmonths, and then my real English governess who stayed for years, whose name was\nAgnes Coyne. And there, there was something kind of amusing about her because when\nKing Alexander was killed. There was a...",
        "A: No, I think maybe \u00b034, \u201934. There was a regency formed because Peter was too young to\ngovern and one of the \u2014 I mean, the main member of this, of this regency was King\nAlexander\u2019s cousin, Prince Paul, and two other persons \u2014 one was a Slovene and the\nother was a guy buy name of Ivo Perovic, which was a Croatian ban, which was sort of\nlike a governor of a state. He had three children and lived in Zagreb, but then they moved\nback to \u2014 then they moved to Belgrade, and they decided they absolutely had to have our\ngoverness, and contacted her and contacted my mother, and they wanted \u2014 she didn\u2019t\nwant to go. And my mother said, \u201cYou absolutely have to go because we would have\nsanctions against us left and right. You can\u2019t say no.\u201d And finally she went, but\napparently she was so unhappy she phoned us practically every week, and one day\nappeared at our doorstep with her suitcases and my mother had to make up some big\nstory about her being sick, having to move to England, nervous breakdown and so on,\nand she stayed until I guess I was 16.",
        "A: Lunch... The main meal was at noon, and the governess and my brother and I sat at the\ntable with them, and in the evening we sat with them when had dinner with the\ngoverness.",
        "A: Both.",
        "A: Both, but yes, of course, because we often didn\u2019t have school at the same time. Schools\nwere \u2014 school days were three days in the morning, three days in the afternoon from eight\nto one, quarter to one, something like that, and then afterwards we would have private\nclasses of one kind or another at home in German, French, this and that. And, my brother\nmay have gone \u2014 he did not go to the same school as I did, but I\u2019m a little \u2014 I\u2019m already\nhigh school. I'll go back, if you want, to, to primary school.",
        "A: Three years younger, three years younger, yeah. And so I\u2019m not quite sure whether \u2014 I\nthink I\u2019m talking now mostly is-is already in secondary school. Yeah, because, but\notherwise, yeah, we ate at the table. This was mostly for discipline.",
        "A: Well, you know, you sit around and slop around in sort of a children\u2019s room, it\u2019s different\nthan when you\u2019re sitting at the table with a meal that was served with white gloves.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "A: Yes. Well, no, listen, because she took off her gloves and we palled around afterwards,\nbut, yeah, it was quite formal. It was quite formal.",

        "A: Yes, yes. I mean, as much as you\u2019re close with a boy who\u2019s three years younger than you.\nYou despise them mostly, but yes.",
        "A: First of all cousins.",
        "A: Not many, one cousin who is Mia Bauer (ph), who is two and a half younger \u2014 two and a\nhalf years younger than me. There was another one who died who was also three years\nyounger, and then there were extended family \u2014 cousins who were about \u2014 but he was the\noldest, except for two cousins who were from out of town, and then later on \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a\nvery large family. And the Pristers all lived apart, so this was mostly Sternberg part of the\nfamily. Although there was one cousin of the younger ones of the sisters that would have\nbeen \u2014 who was about my age, maybe a year younger or so. Yes, they were very\naffectionate; yes they were strict as far as school work is concerned, as far as manners\nwere concerned, as far as -",
        "A: Yes, I did. Although, I wasn\u2019t a particularly good student at it.",
        "A: French, later on. Sometimes if I wasn\u2019t doing too well in any subjects, somebody would\ncome and we would work on the Latin and so on. Then I would go out for gym of one\nkind or another, tap dancing.",
        "A: Tap dancing at the time of Shirley Temple, I guess, it was the rage. But that was outside.\nI mean, that wasn\u2019t at home.",
        "A: Mildly, yes. Yes, I was not particularly good at it.",
        "A: Also, there were gym classes of other kinds. Now, this is kind of interesting. My brother\nwent to the Maccabi, as most Jewish kids did, but I went first to the Sokol. The Sokol is a\npan-Slavistic \u2014 pan-Slavic gym organization and also, I guess, pan-national, pan-Slavistic\nnationalistic organization, that had a lot of calisthenic-type things, and I went to that\nwhich took place \u2014 I can\u2019t remember \u2014 in some \u2014 there was a thing, yes, they had a\nparticular hall in town which was called a Sokolan (ph), and there were dances there as a\nmatter of fact and so on. And, somewhere in the early 30s, maybe \u201932 and so on, they\nhad \u2014 there were things like the Olympics but only Slavic. So, they would come and, I\nmean, I never traveled out of Zagreb for it, but I remember there was a very large\ngathering and people came from Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria and Poland and who\nknows what, and there was this march and we did calisthenics and we did, you know, like\nthe Germans did and so on. There\u2019s these horrendous things in stadiums and in fact there\nwas a stadium built at the time for this particular get together. And then later when I was\nabout 12, again, my brother and others in the family were in the Maccabi, I was a\nmember of the HASK, which was the Crotian academic sports club, Hrvatski akademski\nsportski klub, which still exists. It was a big soccer club and gym, and I did \u2014 what was\nit? \u2014 track, I ran marathons and that kind of thing. It was short marathons, and trained\nwith it, and stuff like that.",
        "A: My \u2014 they were obviously members of the synagogue. In fact, my mother had a plaque\non, you know, a seat in the synagogue and so on, and they went for, I guess, Yom Kippur\nand the major holidays. We were required to go, both in public high school and so on, on\nSaturday to children services in the synagogue. And it counted \u2014 you had to have an\nexcuse from the rabbi if you didn\u2019t attend.",
        "A: This was nationally required as the Serbs and as the \u2014 the Serb Orthodox \u2014 and the\nCatholic kids had to go to services. This was not all the time, but there was maybe a\nperiod of three, four years where this was really seriously required. And we had religious\nclasses both in public high school and obviously in the Jewish school where I went \u2014 I\nwent to four years to the elementary school, to the Jewish school, where we learned both\nbiblical Hebrew and then later on modern Hebrew, and sang various things and so on. So,\nit was quite interesting as far as that\u2019s concerned. And, once \u2014 and then, during that, as I\nsaid, during the major holidays, the parents went and we went to the synagogue, which\nwas just around the corner from town.",
        "A: There was a Challah loaf.",
        "A: No, not on Fridays, on holidays. And for Passover we were usually farmed out to people\nwho knew how to do this better, or well, anyhow \u2014 we went to that and then for\nHannukah, there was a candles and -",

I\u2019m not talking only about Zagreb, but for instance, my father in\nSlavonska Pozega, his father and the priest of the one leading church there, obviously\nRoman Catholic, used to play cards together daily, and so on. Totally. Not only that, but\nmy aunt was \u2014 this was the one that was a few years younger than my father \u2014 was sent to\nLjubljana to a Malud, I mean, there was a school with was run by nuns, a boarding school\nrun by nuns, which is where she sort of went to finishing school at age 14.

        "A: We went to concerts, which were quite frequent and good musical life there. They had \u2014\nmy grandmother had a loge in the opera in the national theater with her name on it. So, I\nhad to go to whatever was appropriate for children, ballet and so on. There was very nice\n\u2014 there was student, afternoon student performances with the school at a very low price,\nand you stood in the back if you had to, and that was permitted. I was always very\npleased to do that. My grandmother had a subscription to various concerts which took\nplace. And the theater of all kinds. The older \u2014 the parents, the grandmother and\ngrandfather \u2014 went to Vienna every season to get clothes because we couldn\u2019t in Zagreb,\nto have them made, and to the opera especially. My grandmother on my father\u2019s side\nremarried. She was a widow. She was married, and her husband was a Croatian Jew, but\nhe was bank director in Vienna, and she was \u2014 she loved being a Croatian, a provincial\nlady, and she actually brought to Vienna a Croat room, a folk room, like a peasant room.\nShe went so far as to bring the wood paneling, cut out the way that they do in Croatia\u2014 a\npeasant room with peasant furniture, peasant dolls, stuff like that, which was kind of\namusing, but she lived there so then from the time I was maybe a year old or so. She died\nwhen I was five, but I remember going visiting there and obviously, my mother and her\nmother used to go every season to Vienna, once a year at least, probably twice.",
        "A: Ambivalent in many ways.",
        "A: Yes, I would\u2019ve loved to have been \u2014 I did, I was permitted from time to time to ride the\ntrolley to school, but mostly I walked because that was healthy, but if I had been sick and\nthe weather was dreadful, I would be driven to school, but the car was never permitted to\nstop there. I would emerge behind the corner.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t want it, and it would have been show-off. It would\u2019 ve been immodest for a little\ngirl to be driven.",
        "A: Yes, yes. It was \u2014 there were a number of well-off families, obviously, but 1t was\nuncomfortable because the schools were totally mixed. You had children who were\npoverty stricken, who got free milk both at the Jewish school and in high school, I mean,\nin secondary school, and it was embarrassing. It was embarrassing when the governess\nwould pick me up. I didn\u2019t like that. Although, oddly, I was with a friend two years ago,\nlast year, two years ago in Zagreb who remembered how disgusted Pippsi was \u2014 Agnes\nCoyne, we called her Pippsi. She said, \u201cNo, she was wonderful.\u201d I said, \u201cHow can you\nsay that? She was a horrible woman.\u201d \u201cNo, no, she was always very nice to me.\u201d You\nknow, it was \u2014 you\u2019re right, it was unpleasant. And when you walked home, if you were\npicked up with friends, everybody, you know, reported back to one\u2019s mother how you \u2014\nwhether you greeted them properly, whether you curtsied, we curtsied. Still, I curtsied\nwhen I came to the States to married women always.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Older women, yeah.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: No, I had lots of friends, very good friends 1n all strata, absolutely all strata. They would\ncome to me. I would come to them \u2014 not a problem and not as far as religion was\nconcerned or anything else, no, not at all.",
        "A: Good. Thank you.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: Right. Right.",
        "A: Yes, and I was fairly Croatian \u2014 well, first I was very Yugoslav. And then I become quite\nCroatian because they \u2014 mostly because, probably because the pressure from Belgrade\nwas really quite bad. You felt it and everyday life. In fact, if you look at a certificate,\nschool certificate from a public school in Zagreb, 1t was supposed to be in the two\nlanguages. So, you have it in Cyrillic, in Serbian, and you have it in Serbian with Latin\nscript. It went that far. There was a lot of indoctrination, very intensely Yugoslav. I guess\nyou just become \u2014 many of our friends were Croatian, peasant party people, who were\nmostly nice and decent and I don\u2019t think \u2014 they may have been anti-Semitic, but certainly\nnot overtly so. I don\u2019t know, maybe some were. Some were, on the contrary, very less so.\nAnd both my father and my uncle who was a lawyer were very, very \u2014 had friends of all\nkinds. During King Alexander, and later on actually, even Prince Paul\u2019s regime and the\nvarious Serbian \u2014 especially after the death of Alexander, there was a lot of repression,\nand one of the members of my extended family was a young man who was a communist.\nHe was in the same jail as Mose Piyade, and he was killed in the war. There was a whole\ngroup of young Communist activists, leftists, all of them, of course, very idealistic, had\nno idea what it really meant, and who sat in jail. And my uncle, who was a lawyer, was\nthe one who was taking packages and taking care of them, and so on. They were in very,\nvery notorious political prisons. One of them is Lepoglava where they continued giving,\nyou know, that was also later on in jail during the Ustashe regime and so on. So, there\nwas a lot of that going on. I\u2019m trying to think, yeah.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Well...",
        "A: For me, I think this happened when I was maybe I was eleven. I guess you suddenly\nbecame aware of that this was a repressive regime and that people\u2019s friends were being \u2014\nwere being oppressed and also the peasants. At that time, Doctor Macek, who was sort of\nthe leader of the Croatian peasant party and then later on became a member of the\ngovernment, was in the opposition, and you lived in Croatia and not in Belgrade. You\nhave \u2014 a lot of taxes and \u2014 not a lot, most, almost everything went to Belgrade. So, there\nit was [coughs], excuse me, there was a great deal of corruption of one kind or another.\nMoney that was collected in taxes simply disappeared in Belgrade, and public works that\nwere necessary in Croatia never took place. They were done in Belgrade. They weren\u2019t\neven done in Serbia. They were stalled along the way. And, later on, there was a political\n\u2014I keep wanting to say the Spanish word which 1s convenio, but actually they \u2014 the\nCroatian Peasant party was actually now a public party, and it was not anything that was\nrepressed in such a way, and there was a coalition government formed with Doctor\nMacek. And I remember during this, during the election campaign when you\u2019d drive out\nin the countryside, you know, the peasants would yell, \u201cZivio Doktor Macek!\u201d You also\nyelled, \u201cZivio Doktor Macek!\u2019, and so on - May he live long.",
        "A: Doctor \u2014 \u201cMay he live long,\u201d I mean, \u201cHail,\u201d or whatever you want to Doctor Macek.\nAnd this \u2014 the Croatian consciousness, which had been really very, very repressed \u2014 and\nmaybe that was one reason why all those Ustashes were successful later on because, you\nknow, of course, they via a Bulgarian assassin killed Alexander, and after that, there was\na very repressive regime in Belgrade which repressed Croatia most of all.",
        "A: Much more, much more.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t feel it, no. I did not feel it, but I mean, it was talked about a lot in school. Like,\nfor instance, \u201cGod forbid, Croatia is not the Balkans. The Balkans stop at the Sava\nRiver.\u201d",
        "A: Yes, yes, that kind of stuff.",
        "A: It was Croatia. And actually, geographically, it does stop there, and that\u2019s how far the\nTurks went. I mean, this is where they were stopped before going, getting into Vienna.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, completely conscious because I remember \u2014 I remember walking through a\nstreet, I must have been reading. Obviously, I was reading. There was a \u2014 I'll regress a\nlittle bit. Somewhere in 1933 or \u2019?34, my parents went to Chicago \u2014 whenever the World\u2019s\nFair was in Chicago. It may have been in \u201934. Was it?",
        "A: Somewhere there. Okay, I think it may have been \u201933 or \u201934. When I tell you the next\ndate, you will remember. We were in Slovenia on vacation with Agnes Coyne, Pippsi,\nand a friend of my mother\u2019s, and this was right on the Austrian border, and this was the\nyear when Dolfuss was assassinated in Austria. He was the chancellor at the time. My\nparents got very scared, and phoned Zagreb and somebody came to see, to remove us\nfrom the border of Austria, and that\u2019s when things started becoming \u2014 became obvious\nthat things were going to be happening in Austria. And, I remember the election when\nHitler was elected as chancellor because there was a demonstration in Zagreb, and I\nremember seeing a \u2014 there was a newspaper. I don\u2019t think the paper was edited there, but\nthere was a shop window where the headlines were posted, the front page of one of the\npapers was posted, and I remember seeing this. Then you started talking about anti-\nSemitism and so on, and that\u2019s what I, how I remember this.",
        "A: About that, yes.",
        "A: Very much so. In the first place, we had, very soon after that, refugees coming in. Not\nunder horrendous duress, but wanting to leave Austria, and we had very intimate friends\nthere, which was a mixed marriage. The husband was Jewish. The mother was not\nJewish. They wanted to leave. They came, they stayed with us, and they finally left for\nArgentina. One of the men who were working in my father\u2019s factory. Actually, he was in\ncharge of livestock. He was half German and half Argentine, and as you know, they had a\nbig cattle industry in Argentina, and he was there for years on the farm. The farm was\npart of the factory, as I told you. This was all \u2014 molasses were there and the cows were\neating part of it, and so, this man, who had both German and Argentine citizenship,\nmanaged to get these friends, whose name was Polla (sp), visas to go to Argentina, and\nthey stayed with us in the meantime. And more and more Austrian Jews were coming,\nsitting in coffeehouses. That\u2019s when there started to be some unpleasant remarks were\nmade, \u201cDo we need these German speaking foreigners sitting here?\u201d Then it became,\n\u201cGerman speaking Jews.\u201d And obviously they were staying either in rooming houses or\nhotels or with friends, but they were \u2014 everybody was \u2014it was a coffeehouse society. I\nmean, my mother went to coffeehouse, my father \u2014 not the same one mind you. The men\nplayed cards in one place, and the women had their bridge game someplace else or just\nwent for coffee. So, 1t was a coffeehouse society like Vienna, and so on. You know, here\nthey are talking German. At that point, nobody, none of the Croatian Jews spoke German.\nWe were \u2014 except to them. I mean, it was, \u201cPlease don\u2019t speak German.\u201d And we didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Absolutely. Absolutely, from that time on, and it was getting more and more. There was\ntalk of Dachau, for instance. There were no killing camps. There were no extermination\ncamps. There were concentration camps and political camps and so on, and we knew of\nthem. We knew that things were starting to happen, and at that point, obviously, we were\n\u2014 oh, and then for instance, we had a subscription to Neue Freie Presse, which then we\ndidn\u2019t want to have anymore. Then, instead of the German papers, the Austrian papers,\nmy father got Swiss papers, and everybody was listening to the radio to see what was\nhappening, and so on. That was very \u2014 that felt threatening already.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, not at all, not at all.",
        "A: No, never.",
        "A: Never.",
        "A: Never, and I don\u2019t think anybody else really. Never.",
        "A: Not only I, and there were a lot of people for whom it was hard because their education\nhad been Austro-Hungarian, and there \u2014 and their literary language was not Croatian.\nMine was. I spoke German, but I never -",
        "A: I think mainly the Jewish population, yeah, because the upper-middle class, non-Jewish,\nprobably continued. These were remnants of old Austro-Hungarian bureaucracy,\naristocracy and so on, and they spoke German. And there were certain parts of Croatia\nwhere German was spoken almost as an everyday language. It never was with me, but for\ninstance, Osijek, my great-grandmother, spoke Croatian, and very well and correctly, but\nshe was more comfortable in German. But that was the town of Osijek where there was a\ngreat \u2014 by the way, that was a very large Volksdeutsche population around there that had\ncome in \u2014 Slavians that had come in, I don\u2019t know, in the 17\" century, 18\" century, a\nwhole batch of them who then became quislings of the worst sort. But, I mean, there were\nvillages of nothing but German-speaking people in, mostly in Slavonia.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: They are, I don\u2019t know, they were not comfortable. There was one and possibly, now that\nI think of it, these were mostly mixed marriages. There was another very well-off\nindustrialist by the name of Alfred Braun, who was married to a non-Jewish Austrian\nwoman, who took off for Kenya, and he was a business friend of my father\u2019s, and I\nremember them coming on business occasions previously, and then leaving for Kenya\nfrom Yugoslavia, as I remember.",
        "A: One of them was \u2014 with families only \u2014 and another thing that happened is we all used to\nwear dirndls, you know Austrian \u2014 not real dirndls because they were too expensive to\nwear \u2014 but, you know, the little aprons and dresses with little puff sleeves. Everybody\nstopped wearing that. My brother had lederhosen. That was \u2014 I still have a picture of him\nas a small child, and then all that disappeared. It was also worn in Slovenia, you know, on\nthe border, but we all stopped wearing stuff like that.",
        "A: Yes. Anti-Austrian at first, and then, yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: There would be...a threat.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, there would be a threat. And we, obviously \u2014 I mean, then later on things started to\ndevelop and Croatia was entirely surrounded by countries to which you couldn\u2019t go in,\neither pro-Nazi or were actually overrun or whatever. So, it was sort of like a little island,\nespecially when the Germans entered Greece, it was very threatening, but that\u2019s much\nlater on.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I think so. I think so, yes, sure.",
        "A: I remember. Certainly, I remember, and I had a conversation with \u2014 what I didn\u2019t\nremember was brought back to me a couple of years ago, talking to the same friend of\nmine who said, \u201cAh! Your father was so smart and got you out in time.\u201d I said, \u201cYou\ncouldn\u2019t get out.\u201d People didn\u2019t have the means. There were many reasons why you\ncouldn\u2019t get out, and I said \u2014 and she said, \u201cI became aware of that when the first\nAustrian refugees knocked on our door.\u201d I don\u2019t remember anybody knocking on our\ndoor to come and stay, and she said \u201cThat\u2019s when I started pushing my mother,\u201d who, by\nthe way, was married to a non-Jewish Slovene of German descent or Austrian descent\nand so on. Saved them in one way or another, in other ways not. So, of course, we talked\nabout it, of course we did.",
        "A: No, people who came, I mean, yeah.",
        "A: They knew. Now, for instance, another group that came was this \u2014 again, this is people\nfrom my father\u2019s hometown, their name was Dierenbach, and they were from Pozega and\ntwo brothers who went and became bankers \u2014 one in Nuremburg, the other in Dresdner.\nThey both work at the Dresdner Bank, both married to very, very German Jewish women.\nI mean, very German, intensely so, and they had \u2014 they didn\u2019t have dual-nationality. They\nwere already German, and the son must have been about 13 at the time. This family came\nback and settled and the boy started learning Croatian, and spoke it. The mother never\nlearned Croatian. And so, they were part of our group. I mean, he became part of fairly\nclose knit \u2014 my cousins, and this boy, especially because they were originally \u2014 the\nparents were originally from my father\u2019s hometown. Yeah, they kept trickling in. There\nweren\u2019t huge boatloads, not boatloads, trainloads of people coming in.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: My father was always very anglophile and I wanted to go. I didn\u2019t want to be in my\nschool anymore, and later on my brother came. He went also to school there, but that was\nit. That was it.",
        "A: No. No. No, because I kept coming home.",
        "A: Back and forth all the time, no. Obviously, we were in England. My family \u2014 I must have\nbeen on vacation or something and we went back \u2014 and a whole bunch of my family \u2014 my\nbrother was still in Zagreb, but a whole bunch of the family was in London at the time of\nMunich. And we all went back, and I remember \u2014 I remember Chamberlain, and I\nremember the French being \u2014 the army was called up. What do you call 1t when an army\nis \u2014mobilized. We went through Paris, because the train you used was the Orient Express.\nThat was the one way of going. There wasn\u2019t anything elite about it. It\u2019s just \u2014 that\u2019s the\ntrain. That was the line. And there was some members of a family who had moved from\nZagreb to somewhere else whose sons were in England already in school, that\u2019s right, at\nthe university both of them, two boys. I suspect maybe there may have been a question in\nthat case of mobilization of kids to the army, and these were boys of the age that they\nwould have been mobilized in Yugoslavia, maybe that\u2019s the reason why they went there,\nbut this was also a family that had a Precepteur, a French male governess, and then an\nEnglish male governess, and they spoke English and they went to school in England, both\nof them. They were Alfred and Erich Miller, their name was. And they were there, their\nparents were there, and two uncles of ours were there, and I guess they came to leave me\nin school. And in fact, I was at Oxford. I was already...",
        "A: I was there already, and they picked me up and we went back because my father \u2014 they\nhadn\u2019t prepared anything. My brother was in Zagreb, going to school quite normally. And\nthen we stayed until things sort of blew over, and I went back with my brother, I\nremember. I may have the \u2014 I may have the dates off a little bit.",
        "A: It must have been earlier, I think \u201936.",
        "A: I think it must have been \u201936. Somewhere I have a piece of \u2014 no, it may have been \u201937 \u2014 I\nhave a piece of paper somewhere where my father is asking permission from the Ministry\nof Finance to buy a certain number of foreign currency for my schooling and my\nbrother\u2019s schooling abroad. You had to have it, and you had to show you passed whatever\nexams were necessary to get the next year\u2019s quota of money, of Pound Sterling to export,\nbecause you were not allowed to take any money out of Yugoslavia.",

        "A: At Oxford, all the time, every weekend I had to take him and a bunch of other boys for\nlunch because I was the oldest one, and they were entrusted to me. It was disgusting",
        "A: No.",
        "A: It was horrible. They had dreadful uniforms with boaters, you know, with straw hats,\nhorrendous uniforms, and they handed them over to me and I had to turn them back in.",
        "A: Very close. It was at Oxford.",
        "A: This was high school. This was what they called public school. It was horrendous. I was\nvery embarrassed. I was the one who was taking care of them.",

The trains were, including the\nOrient Express, complete \u2014 I mean that we \u2014 there was only standing room. People were\nsitting on, on suitcases, and completely and absolutely chaotic. And then when we came\nto Croatia, everything was quiet. I mean, to Yugoslavia.",
        "A: It was extremely frightening. It was extremely frightening. In fact, we almost missed the\ntrain because my father was rushing out to get the latest Swiss papers to read it from a\nneutral point of view, and as he was going in, he pushed somebody and he something\nlike, \u201cPardon,\u201d or something \u2014 no, my father said, \u201cPardon\u201d, and the guy said in French,\n\u2018\u201cFichez-moi la paix!\u201d\u2019, and my father\u2019s French wasn\u2019t very good and he thought he was\ntalking about peace, but what the guy was saying to him was, \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d Or\nsomething like that. And, my father said, \u201cOui, oui, j\u2019espere bien,\u201d or something like that.\nThen, we went on. I remember members of the family sitting on suitcases. That\u2019s how-",
        "A: How crowded it was in corridors. I mean, my mother and I sat inside in a wagonilit (ph),\nbut it was totally crazy, and I\u2019m trying to think where it was that it sorted petered out, all\nof the craziness, because when we came to Zagreb it was fairly normal, the train, but it\nwas, for two or three hours, it was this chaotic situation.",

        "A: He was wearing, yes, sports clothes, which were very, let\u2019s say, informal. It was\ndifferent.",
        "A: I think so, yes, yes, that and being \u2014 not being obvious as I was in Zagreb. He talks\namong other people who didn\u2019t care who I was, that anonymity was very nice. Then I\ncame back and the anonymity was gone.",
        "A: It was gone because I remember \u2014 oh, he did have \u2014 he was wearing a pair of white slacks\nand a white blazer, which is what these people wore, and I was walking down the street\nin Zagreb. And somebody saw him, of my older friends, actually a very well-known\nhistorian, a woman by the name of Fici Despot (ph). She was one who ended up by being\na Croatian leading historian, and she saw us on the street, and somebody asked her, \u201cDid\nyou see Lucie with the guy, with the Englishman?\u201d And she said, \u201cYes.\u201d And she said,\n\u201cWhat did he look like?\u201d And she said, \u201cLike the ice cream man.\u201d So, you know, it was\nlike that.",
        "A: No, he came from a very wealthy family. Although the family was divorced and his\nmother lived in the lake district, and so on. So, no.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Yes, because two days after we were there, or maybe three days after we arrived, four\nother people that we knew from Oxford arrived \u2014 two young men. Two were journalists,\nand two were people that I just knew who had just graduated, who were \u2014 but not friends\nof Joe\u2019s. They met there. He was very jealous, as a matter of fact, but I had made these\narrangements previously, and they came and they were going to go do a tour of the\nBalkans or Europe or whatever afterwards, and they stayed with us. And then there was\nthe invasion of Poland in September, and all of them immediately went to Zagreb to the\nBritish Consulate and immediately \u2014 immediately reported, and the other four took off\nright away, almost immediately, to go to England, and Joe stayed maybe another week\nand went back. That\u2019s the last time I saw him. They put him on the train a week later.",
        "A: Oh, no, no, I would have gone myself. We were all very gung-ho to go fight Hitler one\nway or another.",
        "A: It was horrible. I remember it. It was on the railroad station, and of course at that time to\nembrace a man you weren\u2019t married to or whatever, kiss him on the railroad station, my\nparents averted their heads and went off, and it was so on. Maybe I was here and they\nwere 100 meters away. Underneath there\u2019s way, there\u2019s a whole new... I think my mother\nwas relieved.",
        "A: She was relieved. She was very fond of this person who, whose photograph I had, who\nwas more to her liking and also, you know...",
        "A: Oh, God, terrible",
        "A: Yes, yes, but then I was supposed to have been engaged to him officially, so to speak.",
        "A: I can\u2019t go back. I can\u2019t go back to the place. So, then I start taking \u2014 my brother, let\u2019s put\nit that way, had lost a year. In order to get back to high school, he had to go to a private\nschool to make up subjects such as National History, Croatian Language, Yugoslav\nGeography, which was a separate subject and so on, and he went to a private school\nwhich was horrendously terrible for him because only retarded kids went to private\nschools, but he went for a whole year before he could make up and then go to a regular\nhigh school after that. That was really traumatic because \u2014 yeah, I remember that very\nwell. I did odds and ends. I took classes in History of Art. There was some sort of free\nuniversity which was for people who did not \u2014 who were not inscribed, that you could go\nto classes. The British Council was running English classes and I sat in on them for\nlaughs, really, because a friend of mine had gone there and did a course in proficiency in\nEnglish which oddly, somewhere in \u201947, I got the results of the exams. Could you believe\nit? Somebody found them at the British Council after the war through a relative of mine. I\nlearned typing, so I would know something worthwhile and practical for the future. In\nfact, I brought an Olivetti with me on the trip to the United States. I went to these\nridiculous balls that were \u2014 You were launched in Zagreb when you went to a certain\ndance.",
        "A: As a debutante. Until you were 18, you were a snotty-nose that nobody even considered\nas a person. You were a school child, a school girl, and so on, but after the Matura, after\nyou graduated from high school, which I did not there, but I got to be 18 years old, you\nwent to these various balls, and the ball was the, oddly enough, the journalist ball, and\nonce you were at the journalist ball, I guess you were ready to get married maybe.\nAnyhow, then you were in society. Then you can \u2014 I mean, then you were no longer led\nby the hand, although supervised seriously, but you were launched.",
        "A: Oh, absolutely.",
        "A: Completely. Completely absolutely.",
        "A: For me, it was horrendous. It was, you know, first of all, wearing ridiculous clothes that I\nhated with high heels, which I still hate. You had to have these dresses made on the\nwhole, because there was no ready-to-wear, which was standing in front of dressmakers\u2019\nmirrors being prodded hither and yon by mothers, by dressmakers, by couturiers, and so\non. It was hard, but you went.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. That was the duty, this was duty, but my mother \u2014 I was, and I still am,\nhorribly nearsighted. To wear glasses, my God, I mean, you know \u2014 it was torn off of my\nface. So, a number of people as I walked on the street and I didn\u2019t curtsey properly, it was\nreported to my mother, and I didn\u2019t see the poor person who was reporting me. Pictures,\nphotographs were taken of no glasses on, God forbid. It was awful. It was boring. It was\nterrible. I had to stand straight, and I slouch on the whole; I always did. And it was\nboring. It was horribly boring.",

        "A: I\u2019m there.",
        "A: Yes. One of the things that\u2019s going on is you\u2019re listening to Radio Paris. Paris Radio had\na Yugoslav by the name of \u2014 I can\u2019t remember, but I do have his name written down \u2014 he\nwas \u2014 oh, Petrovic, Sveta Petrovic. He had one of these programs, like Voice of America\nhad later on, where he was broadcasting to Yugoslavia and railing against the Germans,\nand then when France fell, he went on \u2014 not to Vichy \u2014 he ended up in the United States,\nbut he followed the French government where he could \u2014 where he was broadcasting, and\nhe ended up in the United States, and I ended up doing translations for the censors here\nfor him, and when he was sick doing his broadcasts for the Royal Yugoslav government,\nwhich was very funny, you were listening to that. You were listening again on the radio\nto neutral radio stations, and there were family councils around the table, and friends.\nWhat\u2019s going to happen now that Hitler\u2019s about to get us all? But, you didn\u2019t know where\nand how. This was \u2014 these were family councils going on among the members of the\nfamilies \u2014 dining rooms or another. It was constant. And people who had lived in the\nprovinces, like the parents of these cousins that were in London, moved to Zagreb to be\nhandy to be able to leave if anybody was able to leave. The major problem was that there\nwere currency restrictions. You couldn\u2019t send any money out. The other problem was that\nmy father was a reserve officer, a captain first class, and he would have had to have\ngotten permission from the army to leave. They were sending mobilizations going on.\nThere wasn\u2019t mobilizing, but there was a \u2014 there was a state of alert, let\u2019s say. My father\n\u2014not my father, anybody, this wasn\u2019t anything exclusive \u2014 had to do every \u2014 I don\u2019t\nremember when you, probably, at various intervals, but at that time, I think, every two\nyears, you had to go and do some active duty as an officer. He was a reserve officer in the\nYugoslav army, and every once in a while, they would pull you for three months or six\nmonths or whatever to re- I don\u2019t know \u2014 to get them up, you know, to whatever was\ngoing to happen. To get them ready for necessary combat, and my father \u2014 this was\nprobably in 1940 \u2014 was in Split for three months doing his military duty, and I had\nnothing to do. So, I came to stay with him in Split, and that was very exciting, very nice\nfirst of all, nobody was supervising me. I was living in a hotel, and I would see him in the\nevening for dinner with the rest of the officers, which was also fun, I must say. One of the\nofficers, there, was the Imam of the Muslim soldiers because, you know, just behind the\nmountain is Bosnia, and there were number of recruits who were Muslim. And I\nremember on one occasion how aware they were of Hitler and anti-Semitism. The Imam\nsaying to my father, \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about anything, Fredo. If they come, I will say\nyou\u2019re Muslim. The main thing has been done already.\u201d So, you know, this 1s \u2014 this is\nwhat \u2014 I think that\u2019s sort of indicative of what the camaraderie was all among them.",
        "A: Muslims and Jews are of circumcised. That\u2019s what it was.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. Absolutely.",

        "A: Yes, very exotic. In India, New Delhi and then, you know, when the heat got horrendous\nthey went to Northwest province, which was Kashmir, I guess.",
        "A: Not, dating. I\u2019m going out, yeah, yeah. I\u2019m going out. Everybody knows. Everybody\nknows, but I do go to the darned balls and to coffeehouses and so on, but you know,\nmildly so.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Not at that particular moment, but yes, we talked, because this group was trained to\nwithstand the Italian army, because, you know. Okay, so, obviously, I mean, we know\nwhat they\u2019re getting to, you know, to face. We did talk about it, sure. Then, as I\u2019m\nwalking along in Split looking at shop windows or whatever, maybe palaces, maybe\nDiocletian\u2019s Palace, something more cultural, my high school class turns up on their high\nschool graduation trip, and I joined them, and that was a rather amusing thing because I\nhave all of these dressy clothes. I was dressing 1n the evening in this hotel where they\nwere staying. So, I packed all of that up, and I left 1t with my father who then sent it to\nZagreb, and my father was on duty and a soldier was supposed to escort me to this third-\nclass bus that my class was riding in to go to Dubrovnik, and I made a little suitcase of\nsome kind or other, and this was like five o\u2019clock in the morning, five-thirty in the\nmorning, and suddenly there\u2019s this knock on the door. And I said, \u201cWho 1s it?\u201d in\nCroatian, and the man says, \u201cThe army.\u201d He was some kind of guy who was in \u2014 who my\nfather had sent to pick me up. So, this was the army that was getting me out of bed, and\nleft me there, and I joined this whole group, and then we finally got back to Zagreb on\nsome horrible third-class train, sleeping on the floor, as I was saying how they were\ndoing in Dubrovnik on mattresses on the floor, and that\u2019s what we did.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We go back to Zagreb.",
        "A: Yes, very much.",
        "A: And my father was very anxious for me to get out, and I know that I had papers. I know\nthat I had to get a piece of paper that said that I was unmarried, which I had notarized. I\nknow that I went to get a birth certificate, which I had translated and notarized \u2014\ntranslated into English and officially notarized to send to England, to have with me. And,\nI actually think that I had a Greek visa, if I\u2019m not mistaken, which \u2014 because Greece was\nnot invaded yet, to go, I guess, via Iraq or something, Turkey, via Iraq to India, which, of\ncourse, never took place, but I do remember getting a Greek visa, and a letter from the\nCounsel General. Those Counsel Generals are very interesting things. There are a number\nof honorary Counsel Generals who were Jewish, and one was a Greek. The other was\nPortuguese, who also gave me a visa, and the other was Uruguayan. These were all\nZagreb Jews, well off in CD cars.",

        "A: Yes",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. Yugoslavia. In Croatia, you already started feeling that you didn\u2019t want to\nbe there when it happened.",
        "A: Yes, because I think that there must have been \u2014 there must have been intimations\nalready. I\u2019m not aware of it, but I do know that there must have been some people who\nwere quite happy with what was going on in Germany. I don\u2019t know a personal one. I do\nknow that I met, the day before I left in, let\u2019s say, the Yugoslav portugates (ph), the\nGerman on March 27\", and like on March 28\" or 29\", I was on the main square and\nI ran into two friends of mine from high school, two guys, and I said, \u201cGuys, we\u2019re\nleaving.\u201d Because, by that time, we already had our American visa and everything else,\nand one of them, who was a Communist, who later became director of the Zagreb theater,\nand the other one, who\u2019s father became director of the University under the Ustashe, were\nstanding there, these are my really close friends from school, and they said, \u201cNow you are\nleaving, when we need you?!\u201d I said, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to do without me.\u201d These people were\nactivists, but they didn\u2019t do anything, collaborated.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: Exactly, exactly, they thought I would be very useful. They were both at that time very\nleft-leaning, not party members, but they were left-leaning, and they obviously knew that\nthings were going to happen now, and as I said, \u201cGuys, we\u2019re leaving,\u201d they said, \u201cNow?\nWhen we need you?\u201d \u201cSorry, Pve got to go.\u201d",
        "A: I think so. I think they knew where my heart was, and they knew, I mean, obviously I\nwasn\u2019t a Communist. One of them may have been a member of the party at one time, but\nhe did \u2014 he served in the Croatian Ustashe army. The other one, the other one, whose\nfather was a very famous grammarian, we used his grammar, nowadays I think it\u2019s still\nprobably used. His name was Ivsic, became director in the Zagreb University, so, I mean\nthe University of Zagreb during Ustashe time, no.",
        "A: Yes, yes, liberal, left-leaning, liberal left-leaning, okay, yes, yes.",
        "A: There were different plans. Well, I wanted to go and see Joe, but then everything \u2014 it got\nto be almost impossible as various frontiers were closing around us constantly. I mean,\nyou couldn\u2019t go through this, you couldn\u2019t go through that. Then, of course, the fact that\nhe could not have, I mean, my father could not have left the country without getting\npermission from the army. I mean, he was \u2014 they would activate you immediately, and he\nwould have had to get a permit from the army, plus you had to get a permit all together to\nleave the country, I mean, which was a great big do. People couldn\u2019t just say, \u201cWell,\ntomorrow, I\u2019m going to go to Vienna,\u201d or something. You had to get a slew of\ndocuments, and permits, and who knows what, not to mention absolutely no money\nwhatsoever.",
        "A: You could not take any money out whatsoever, so what if not that?",
        "A: Nothing, not that. Very little, I think 1t\u2019s probably mentioned in the passports how much.\nI\u2019m not quite sure, but very little. So, the money, at one time, probably in 1941 probably,\n40, \u00b041, my father pro forma sold the big factory where, you know, also where the\ncountry house was to some business friends.",
        "A: No, no, no, this is the place is called \u2014 it\u2019s near Zagreb and the village or where the\nfactory was is called Savski Marof, and that country house was called Janusevac, and he\nsold it to some friends in Ljubljana, some business friends in Ljubljana. In fact, I was just\nrecently going through some papers, I saw some stuff about that. And through somebody,\nI don\u2019t know how, he got some money to England, to Switzerland, and a little bit to the\nUnited States. I don\u2019t know how.",

        "A: Yes, he got a serious amount of money, but oddly enough, he had taken a loan on my\nmother\u2019s house which was very valuable, not so much as, you know, a historical house,\nbut it was in the center of the center of town, and the land was very valuable, and he got a\nloan from the \u2014 he took a mortgage, that\u2019s what it is, a mortgage from the Zagreb Bank,\nthe city bank, and was getting ready to send up money somehow underground to the\nStates or to Switzerland or whatever, probably to Switzerland, but my mother said,\n\u201cListen, the president \u2014 I saw the president of the bank on the street, and he really didn\u2019t\ngreet me with as much\u2019, I hate to say deference, but that was the meaning, \u201cas usual.\nWould you return that loan?\u201d Which he did.",
        "A: Yes, but very little. I thought it was very little, and it was very little, but 1t was enough to\nsort of survive. There was some in Switzerland; that I know.",
        "A: Why and how it was done, I really don\u2019t know, but there was enough to survive.",
        "A: Yes!",
        "A: Yes, the last month \u2014 okay, so we got this American visa which -",
        "A: Yes, yes. The Counsel General of the United States \u2014 the consulate was the house next to\nours in, I mean the office of the consulate, next to ours in Zagreb, the house. My father\nwas a hunter. He took the Counsel General hunting \u2014 it wasn\u2019t even the Counsel General,\nit was a Counsel, Mr. Miley, an American, nice middle-class person. My father took him\nhunting. He, I don\u2019t know, he saw in the back of our stable a \u2014 a suit of armor that was,\nyou know, put away, nobody was bothering with. He went crazy with the suit of armor.\nMy father gave him the suit of armor, which was cluttering things up, and I don\u2019t know\nhow authentic or \u2014 it was a suit of armor that probably was authentic, and he was very\nhappy to give us a visa. Now, one reason why this was going on was there were \u2014 as\nnobody could leave Yugoslavia \u2014 quotas \u2014 you know, the visas were given by country\nquotas at the time \u2014 were not being used in Yugoslavia. So, you had masses of quotas\nlying fallow in consulates, and it is very easy to get an immigration visa. And when my\nfather asked for the visa, and the man in the Counsel said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take an\nimmigration visa?\u201d And, my father said, \u201cWhat would I need an immigration visa for?\nI\u2019m going to return, obviously.\u201d And, he said, \u201cOkay, you\u2019 ll return, but take this\nimmigration visa. You never know when it might be handy.\u201d And we got an immigration\nvisa and that\u2019s how it worked. Oh, and at one time, I guess, he did him a favor because he\nbought his Buick. He got a new Buick at the Counsel, and we got his Buick.",
        "A: His old one. It wasn\u2019t all that old, but it was certainly not for Yugoslavia, and he \u2014 this\nBuick was very significant, by the way, and he \u2014 so, you know, it was a friendship. It was\na \u2014 for maybe a year and a half, two years, they were \u2014 they went -",
        "A: No, no, no, it was a long-term thing that was going on at that time, and he \u2014 yes, okay, we\nhad that, but before that I was thinking we might be going, and that we didn\u2019t get the\nvisa, but they talked about the visa probably a month before that. So, in town, in Zagreb,\nthere were five or six trunks, you know, like \u2014 steamers, huge steamer trucks.",
        "A: In the house, all the servants were there including the nanny, the present nanny,\neverybody was there. The dogs were there. There were three dogs running around in\ntown, not out in the country, and by the way, all the furniture and so on from the country\nhouse was in the basement of the house.",
        "A: In our house in Zagreb, yeah, that was taken out. When he sold the factory pro forma, he\ntook \u2014 an uncle of my mother\u2019s stayed in Janusevac, and was going to be running the\nfactory. They didn\u2019t do him in, but he stayed there. So, his furniture was there, but our\nfurniture from the bedroom and stuff like that, that was in the basement, taken by the\nGermans, by the way. Okay. And we were putting into these steamer trunks embroidered\nbed linen and tablecloths and stuff of that kind, could you imagine why we needed that,\nand clothing, four-station clothing. This was \u2014 I mean, four-season, four-season clothing,\nall sorts of junk like that. And then there were suitcases around, and this was all open\nstanding, being filled, so that when the Germans came, they had all packed together, they\njust took it out. It\u2019s amazing.",
        "A: Yes, this would be shipped out. I mean, this is how this was going on with people who\nleft three weeks earlier. There were people who left earlier.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, we were days within the invasion. So, this must have been, let\u2019s say, a\nweek before the 27\" of March. That\u2019s about it, but when this happened, and when\nYugoslavia \u2014 they went in Belgrade, the populous starting spitting on the German flag.\nThey took the car of the German ambassador and knocked it over, and then I think they\nput it on fire, and they were yelling all sorts of slogans: \u201cBetter dead than a slave\u201d and\nthat kind of stuff, and in Zagreb there was jubilation.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That\u2019s \u2014 yes, it was March 25\", and on the 27\" was the putsch, yes, they abrogated \u2014 the\npeople abrogated, and on the 28\", we got into our car. We left everything there. We\npacked suitcases.",
        "A: We had \u2014 they weren\u2019t that little. There must have been quite a few because when I think\nabout what I dragged over like typewriters and riding boots, necessary things of that kind,\nand urban coats. [laughs]",
        "A: An urban coat.",
        "A: Yeah, and they were quite \u2014 yes, yes, I don\u2019t know big of a trunk. It was a very large car.\nIt was very large. My parents \u2014 so, then, we had the American visa, but my father didn\u2019t\nhave the permission from the army to leave yet, nor did he have an exit visa for\nYugoslavia, an exit permit from Yugoslavia. There\u2019s a piece in the passport, there\u2019s a\nCyrillic thing that says \u201cOfficial Visa\u2019, and he \u2014 and he had to have written in that he was\na delegate on the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, otherwise he couldn\u2019t have gotten\nout, but particularly not the army, because he would have been activated almost\nimmediately. So, we got into our car \u2014 my parents, my brother, I, my uncle \u2014 my father\u2019s\nbrother, who was a lawyer, Felix, and our driver who grew up in my father\u2019s family. His\nname was Josip Levac, who was part Volksdeutsche, but that was \u2014 he was never anti-\nSemitic or anything like that. His father was a cooper. He made barrels for my\ngrandfather\u2019s factory, and this man was schooled by \u2014 my father had him schooled and he\nwent with us to Belgrade. We went through my father\u2019s hometown, which was Slavonska\nPozega, which was where this man was from also, and my father had to report to the\nbarracks. As we drove into the town, we were stopped by the army, by some recruits, and\none stuck the gun into the car, not with the bayonet, but just the muzzle of the gun, and he\nsaid, \u201cLegitimacija\u201d\u2019. We gave him whatever, IDs and so on. So, I gave him my ID. My\nfather showed his army ID, said he was going to the headquarters there, I don\u2019t know\nabout the headquarters, but anyhow to the barracks because this is where he would have\nhad to report to, and when he saw the paper, he called out, \u201cAnybody more literate\naround here?\u201d I\u2019m sure he was illiterate, and couldn\u2019t read it. Okay, so, somebody more\nliterate came and he said, \u201cOkay.\u201d So, we waited for my father in the car while he went to\nthe barracks. I don\u2019t know whether my uncle went along or not. I don\u2019t think so, and\nSepa, I think went to, the chauffer, went to talk to somebody in his family was left over\nthere, and then we proceeded to Belgrade.",
        "A: If they had felt that they wanted to be unpleasant, maybe he would have bribed\nsomebody. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know, but if they had wanted to be unpleasant, if he\nhadn\u2019t had \u2014 he probably had some other paper there that he showed them, that he was\ngoing to Belgrade to do something with \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine it any other way. He must have\nbeen, because it was very recently, he had just very recently done this, you know, training\nin Split not so long ago. And, you know, he probably would\u2019ve survived because all the\nprisoners of war survived, almost all, and just as aside, a friend of ours who was a\nSerbian officer, by the way, who\u2019s father was a general, his wife\u2019s father was general,\nand so on, was a prisoner of war in Germany, and he told me that the Jewish prisoners of\nwar and the Serbs and everybody were together and that one time, the Germans wanted to\nseparate the Jewish prisoners of war from the others, and these people went on strike and\ncalled the Red Cross and who knows what, and they left them together. And almost all of\nthem survived.",
        "A: Horrendous, awful.",
        "A: Frightened, because you could see things were about to start. We were listening to the\nradio. There were mobilizations. There was army all over, you know, you could see army\nleft and right as you went -",
        "A: Oh, absolutely, absolutely, there was no doubt in our mind that something would happen.",
        "A: Absolutely, that was the fear. Plus we had no visa to any country where we could have\ngone through. We had-",
        "A: We had the \u2014 no, we had the immigration visa \u2014 no! We got \u2014 oh, yeah, we had the\nimmigration visa. That was it. That was it.",
        "A: We had no other, no way to traverse. I think, if I look in the passport, that all of this was\nobtained in Belgrade, the various consulate and embassies and so on. So, when we came\nto Belgrade, first of all, we had the permission from the army, then they wrote in this\ndelegation thing that he was going as a delegate of the Ministry. Otherwise would have\nnot been able to get there. And we all got these official visas, because you didn\u2019t just get\na visa. You got an official visa. I know that my uncle \u2014 my uncle, I think had an affair\nwith the prime minister\u2019s \u2014 the prime minister\u2019s wife. He was all over the place. He was a\nvery, a popular guy, and had generally all sorts of connections. He was divorced first. He\nwas a likeable, nice guy who had connections, and I think he helped somehow hasten\nthings. We spent one horrendous night. There were two other members of the family, one\nor two \u2014 my aunt\u2019s husband was also a lawyer who was a businessman, who was there in\nBelgrade and I don\u2019t know why, and somebody else. And at the very last minute, we\nfound that there was an industrial or some kind of fair, either industrial fair or an\nagricultural fair or something like that in Budapest, and they were giving visas.",
        "A: To be able to go, and this was the only \u2014 this was the only \u2014 the only place, the only\nborder you could cross. You couldn\u2019t go anywhere else. The Germans were in Greece\nalready, couldn\u2019t go through Bulgaria, couldn\u2019t go through Italy, couldn\u2019t go through\nAustria via Slovenia. This was the only way to go, and this was some kind of probably\nexcursion visa, I\u2019m not quite sure, but they were giving these visas because there was this\nfair. We spent the night in Belgrade, and the next morning \u2014 naturally Yugoslavia was\ncompleted mobilized by that time \u2014 and decided that the chauffer would help us with the\ncars and go with us to the Hungarian border, and then be able to report back to the family\nwhether we crossed or not. And in the train, my father wrote out an affidavit or\nsomething and said to the chauffer, who clearly was a member of the family, \u201cYou will\nneed to take care of your family. Use this car as a taxi or whatever you want.\u201d And he\ngave him all the papers, and the piece of paper and the letter in which he said that he\nshould take this car, which he did. [laughs] And the very first week, Artukovic, the\nCroatian minister of the interior became, I mean, he became his driver. The car was\nrequisitioned and he became his driver, and stayed with him until the very last, and didn\u2019t\ntell him that he was fleeing, and this poor guy was caught by the British, and Artukovic\ntook off to Argentina and finally ended up here.",
        "A: He gets us-",
        "A: To the \u2014 no, he gets us to the train, and he goes with us to the border, to the Hungarian\nborder on the train.",
        "A: That we crossed, yes. At that time, there were German soldiers in the train \u2014 officers and\nsoldiers in the train already going towards Belgrade. There were troop trains.",
        "A: No, no, in the train station in Belgrade, this was total chaos, and there were recruits with\npeasants with their wives sitting on packages. I mean, you could hardly make a step. It\nwas total complete chaos. This was the mobilized peasantry that was going to be fighting\nthe Germans, all over the Belgrade station. No, he went \u2014 he left us on the Hungarian\nborder, when the train, just before the train crossed to Hungary. Now, there were German\nofficers on the train already going \u2014 I don\u2019t know where they were going \u2014 but there were\nGerman officers in jackets and everything going up and down in the train, but the war\nhad not been declared yet, and troop trains going in the other direction towards\nYugoslavia. And we arrived in Budapest, got into a nice hotel, and phoned Belgrade and\ntold them, \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d Meanwhile, tried to find out where other members of the family\nwere, the ones who were in Zagreb. Some were getting ready to go to Dubrovnik, which\nthey knew was going to be, if anything happened, it would be Italian, but they were not\nthere yet. Other members of the family stayed in Belgrade, and we talked to them when\nwe got to Switzerland. That night, maybe six hours later, they were bombed.",
        "A: No, no, no. They thought that we were-",
        "A: They thought we were \u2014 we called them from Budapest and we said, \u201cListen, this is what\nwe saw.\u201d And they said, \u201cYou\u2019re so in panic among us. Leave us alone.\u201d And so on, and\nthe same thing they said when we called them from Switzerland at midnight, and they\nwere bombed six hours later.",
        "A: I think we had.",
        "A: I think \u2014 I can look in the passport because I\u2019m thinking there are some \u2014 we went and we\nstayed two nights. We went to Vienna overnight, and those were not so hard to get. There\nwere transit visas to, I think that they, I don\u2019t know whether they still called it Austria,\nprobably Germany. It was Germany already, and we came in the middle of the night, and\nwe got to some kind of dreadful hotel near the railroad station. I know that they stole a\nsuitcase of my brother\u2019s, and immediately at dawn, we got on the train to Switzerland,\nbut did not make it to cross. We had to spend a night in Germany.",
        "A: And my father was interrogated for hours.",
        "A: This is at an inn in Austria, right on the border.",
        "A: There were Germans, German troops, and German officers in that inn, and they were\nsinging one of those lovely war songs about Prince Eugene, that\u2019s a boy, I guess, going to\nBelgrade conquering Belgrade. It\u2019s a march song. It\u2019s a march that we all knew, and it\u2019s\npart of \u2014 I\u2019m trying to think in which one of the classic \u2014 it\u2019s part of a classic composition\nthis is taken from. It\u2019s like a march.",
        "A: Not at all. He was questioned for a long time, very thoroughly, and as his German was\nvery good, I guess that was part of the thing. He said, \u201cWe are immigrating to the United\nStates, please. Here\u2019s my immigration visa.\u201d The war wasn\u2019t on yet, but I was a very\nthorough in- And my brother and my mother and I were sitting in this inn absolutely\nquaking with fear. It went on for hours.",
        "A: Somewhere in the inn. They took him in the room, a bunch of German officers who came\nand knocked on the door when, you know, in the middle of the night. The way it was, my\nmother and I slept in one room. He and my brother slept in the other. So, he came to tell\nus, and then my brother joined us 1n this room and we waited there.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, but some three hours at least.",
        "A: It was horrendous. We were terrified, and by that time, we had see these troops going. By\nthe way, Vienna, when we got there, was blacked out, and the windows were blacked out\nin the hotel, and so on. There was no light whatsoever. I don\u2019t know how we \u2014 it must\nhave been fairly close, this hotel, to the station because I have a feeling we walked there\nin the dark. We came at night and we left at dawn, and I remember just darkness, and\nthen \u2014 a blackout, a plain blackout.",
        "A: At that time, he was in Belgrade, yes.",
        "A: No, no, no, he just \u2014 he was in Belgrade, and he stayed in Belgrade.",
        "A: Yeah, probably just visiting around. I recently found \u2014 two days ago, three days ago \u2014 an\nincredible letter written by the person who was the Uruguayan Consul General who was a\nfriend of his and he tells of this story of how he and a couple of others were fleeing, and\nmy Uncle Felix was already in Italian territory going back because of some love interest\nor something like that, to Zagreb, and how they were jailed and so on.",
        "A: Yes, he survived. He went \u2014 he went \u2014 he remarried. He went \u2014 why he came to the\nUnited States via Cuba, but first on some kind of Ellis Island, Cuban Ellis Island where\nhe spent, it was several months before they would let them out, but he did.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I have absolutely no idea. Everybody, the whole staff was in the house. There was a cook.\nThere was a \u2014 two maids, the nanny.",
        "A: They were all in the apartment in Zagreb. They weren\u2019t even, you know -",
        "A: I hope so.",
        "A: Yeah, maybe it was Sepa, maybe the chauffer did. No, I hadn\u2019t heard anything. I had no\nidea what happened. I have no idea. There were two Dachshunds and an English Setter I\nbrought in the apartment.",
        "A: Oh, I was very concerned. I was very concerned. Somebody must have taken them in. I\nmean there were other people there who might have taken them. Somebody who was a\nhunter would have taken them. He was a very bad hunting dog, but he looked as if he\ncould do it.",
        "A: There was a lot of frisking and stuff like that, quite serious.",
        "A: Yes, and probably interrogation.",
        "A: Interrogation also.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: My father and probably my mother. I think they \u2014 I think they searched her in various\nmanners.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Amazingly no.",
        "A: I\u2019m not a kid. Nobody touched me, but my mother was searched, both in Spain-",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: My mother was very embarrassed.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, but not completely because, I mean, no. Our visa \u2014 our permit to be in\nSwitzerland would\u2019ve run out after a month. We would\u2019ve had to leave. Maybe it would\nhave been possible to prolong it somehow, but I don\u2019t remember how long our permit\nwas in Switzerland, but I \u2014 no, it was important to get going. Plus, the other visas\nwould\u2019 ve run out.",
        "A: We were in Geneva. Well, first of all, we had to get a French visa. We had to go through\noccupied France which was in a car, which was locked, sealed. It was a sealed car.",
        "A: A sealed train car, yeah.",
        "A: We were in a very nice hotel. We were in the Hotel d\u2019 Angleterre which was lovely, but it\nwas very tense. It was extremely tense.",
        "A: Yes, and there were some people who we knew in Switzerland who had left earlier, who\nwere in the lumber business, and I don\u2019t know what kind of nationality they had, possibly\nthey had some other nationality, not Yugoslav. They were there. My mother\u2019s cousin who\nwas this Baroness de Vateville, who was in \u2014 who lived in Lucerne at the time, my\nmother called her and she came to Geneva in a women\u2019s Swiss Auxiliary uniform\nspeaking Switzer Dietch. It was very funny to hear, but was very helpful. She came and\noffered to help in any way. I don\u2019t know what kind of help it was.",
        "A: I forgot, naturally. The night that we arrive and called Belgrade at midnight of April 5\"\nor 6\" and speak to the family, and they say everything is quiet, we shouldn\u2019t be crazy.\nSix hours after that they were bombed. This was the first time that I saw my father cry.\nWhen the whole army, everything, collapsed right away. There was no more Yugoslavia.\nI mean, this was such a Blitzkrieg there that this all went to pieces and was really in bad\nshape. I was very happy I was going to go to wherever \u2014 India, or \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to have\nanything to do with that anymore. I wanted out. My mother was very sad, but I don\u2019t\nthink she cried, but my father actually cried, and then the next thing he did, he went to\nBern to talk to the representative of Yugoslavia, and nobody knew what to do. I mean, it\nwas completely unclear what, you know, what was going to happen to Croatia. Not\nCroatia, I mean, what was going to happen, one way or another. It was still Yugoslavia,\ncompletely falling apart, and there was very little news except the bombing Belgrade,\nnothing else. And, then later on, we found out, when we went on, we saw what was\nhappening. When an independent Croatia was declared, but that was later. We went on\nthis sealed train, came to Spain, and at first \u2014 this was very shortly after the Spanish Civil\nWar \u2014 we stayed in a very nice hotel, but it was very obvious that this was very obvious\nthat this was a country that had gone through a war, and it was completely obvious. Crazy\nthing, here we want to go to the Prado, first time we were in Spain, but the Prado is\nclosed. So, we go sit in a caf\u00e9 to have breakfast and there\u2019s some rolls, but it\u2019s obvious\nthat there was a war. I mean, it looked shabby, and then children without limbs started\ncoming to the window of this caf\u00e9 and we\u2019re sitting there having food and asking for\nfood. This was the first time I had seen a country \u2014 I mean, this was a very short time\nafter the civil war in Spain, and these children \u2014 this was the saddest thing about war \u2014\nwithout an arm or without a leg, just holding their hands up, and emaciated, and so we\ntook all the food and gave it to them and walked away. You couldn\u2019t sit and eat because\nof what was going on. We sat pretty much, and walked around a little bit through Madrid,\nbut it was very sad, and it was very empty, and it was very obvious that they had gone\nthrough a war. Then we went to Barcelona and spent a couple of nights in Barcelona and\nwe got on this horrendous bus that got us to Lisbon, and there, I think, we became very\nmuch aware of things are falling out because we didn\u2019t go to a very fancy hotel. We went\nto some kind of pension. It was very nice, but it wasn\u2019t a palace hotel in any place.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Totally, totally, and also you had this feeling in Lisbon, Portugal that this is the spy\ncapital of the world. It was very \u2014 it was eerie. You didn\u2019t know who you could talk to.\nPeople would approach you and say, \u201cI\u2019m going to get you a prolongation of your visa.\nAre you interested? You\u2019re going to get a ticket on such-and-such a ship to go hither and\nyon.\u201d It was bad. And we walked around, but it was a beautiful town we had never been\nto. In Lisbon, we walked around. I have pictures of all dressed up in suits and hats and\nthe works.",
        "A: All the luggage, all of that is standing around, yeah. We\u2019re wearing spring suits. I think\nthere\u2019s even a picture of my mother with a fur boa or something like that, a dead fox on\nher. I think so. I\u2019m almost certain. And my brother and I walking there. There were really\nsome quite unsavory characters that would come and ask him, and they\u2019d be helpful in\nthe hotels and everything. But we then started doing some traveling around, and you\nknow, and first of all, we had \u2014 okay, the United States maritime union was having a\nstrike. So, United States\u2019 ships were not going anywhere, and we had reservations on\nsome sort of ship, but || American export. Nothing was else was going on in the rest of\nthe country, I mean, the rest of Europe except for Portugal was at war. So, there were no\nneutral things except Portugal and, I guess, the United States that had ships going back\nand forth to the States. So, there was this maritime strike, and we had to stay longer, and\nthere was danger of, again, our Portuguese visa running out.",
        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014 three weeks.",
        "A: Not many. So, my father goes to the consulate or whatever, whatever the Yugoslav\nrepresentation there is, and the poor person who is in charge of it, first of all, whoever\nwas a Croatian employee quit and went to free Croatia, or thought they were \u2014 anyhow,\nthey quit the Yugoslav Consulate, but there still the Yugoslav Consulate. There was a \u2014\nwhat is the insurrection of sailors called, there\u2019s a word for it?",
        "A: Mutiny. There\u2019s a mutiny on Croatian ships that are in the harbor in Lisbon because,\nnaturally, the sailors are Croats. They\u2019re not Serbs. So, these are all Dalmatian Serbs. By\nthat time, there\u2019s a \u2014 those Ustashes have gotten to Zagreb, and it\u2019s obvious what\u2019s going\nto be in Zagreb. So, they went back. They went with their ships. So, this poor person has\nnobody to talk to because, obviously, there\u2019s not \u2014 no connection, no telephone, no\nnothing to Yugoslavia, or ex- Yugoslavia, and so he\u2019s having this conversation with my\nfather. What can he do with this mutiny? This mutiny? And my father said, \u201cLet them go.\nWhat are you going to do with them? You can\u2019t hold them there.\u201d So, he said, \u201cOkay.\u201d\nSo, they took off. The next thing -",
        "A: With the ship. They took everything and went back to Croatia.",
        "A: As far as I know. I mean, this is \u2014 this is the way it was decided. They were taking the\nship, and they were \u2014 there were a couple of them, I think. I\u2019m not quite sure. Then, they\nhad no money to pay whoever was employed there. No money from Yugoslavia. I don\u2019t\nknow what happened to the rest. So, my father lent him, I think, $500 to pay off the staff.\nThere was some Croats 1n the staff, no doubt, but most of them wanted to go back. For all\nI know, he was a Croat, but maybe not.",
        "A: No, he goes \u2014 he walks in and he\u2019s got an official visa in his pocket, and-",
        "A: Yes, yeah, yeah. And so, they have a conversation. So, he gives \u2014 and I have the receipt. I\nrecently found it under the papers. It was little. I think it\u2019s $500, plus a letter which asks\nthat we take along when we get to the ship, a \u2014 well, when we get transportation, to take\nalong a Persian carpet for the representative of Yugoslavia in Washington, D.C., who was\na guy by the name of Protasce (ph) at the time, which I think I saw on one occasion when\nthere still was a Yugoslavia, which we took along. Then, we found somebody who got in\ntouch with us, a family of a French diplomat. I guess it was a small place, and people\nheard who was where, or maybe this Yugoslav woman who I\u2019m going to talk to you\nabout now heard that \u2014 must have gone to the Yugoslav Embassy or Yugoslav\nRepresentation to talk about what\u2019s going to happen to her, and so on. She was married to\na, I think, the cultural attach\u00e9 of France in Portugal, and he was supposed to go back to\nFrance, and they had a little boy. She was originally from Zagreb, and her sister\u2019s\nhusband worked for my father in the yeast factory, the alcohol and yeast factory. And in\nfact, I was wearing a jacket that her sister, who was a weaver, had woven the material for.\nI used that for a long time. And we took this child, and took it to his godparents who were\na Yugoslav \u2014 a Croatian Jew by the name of Alexander and his Russian non-Jewish wife\nwho were in New York already for a year.",
        "A: We added some, so then there were-",
        "A: Five of us in the cabin plus the rug, maybe not the rug. It may have been somewhere else.",
        "A: Sibonay, yes.",
        "A: US, US Export Line. The strike was over.",
        "A: The strike was over",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but it was probably a United States export line ship because they were\ndoing this traverse. It was full of all sorts of flotsam and jetsam from Europe on the ship,\nand then the consul from Pavelic, from Bern and his American wife were also on the\nship. They came later. I mean, they came to Portugal later. So, we had somebody to have,\nto sit at the table with. When we got to Bermuda, it was quite, I mean, there were German\nU-boats there, and they were trying to avoid the U-boats, but the United States was\nneutral. So, we got to Bermuda. The British got on the ship and took off a bunch of\npeople.",
        "A: Yeah, German spies, they said, and so on, maybe 10, 15.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know. It was a big ocean liner, and there was interrogation\nthen. The British looked at all of our passports and so on, but there was no problem\nwhatsoever. They took off a number of people. Some, probably, were perfectly honest,\ndecent people. In fact, one was a German leftist, who then found us in New York. So,\nthey must have obviously let him go.",
        "A: No, no, I think 1t was \u2014 I think it was \u2014 no, they were avoiding probably. I don\u2019t know,\nbecause the only thing that happened in Bermuda 1s that these \u2014 that these British\nofficers-",
        "A: Yeah, boarded and interrogated people. And, then, it wasn\u2019t there too long, two hours.",
        "A: And then directly in New Jersey, Hoboken, I believe.",
        "A: I believe so, but definitely New Jersey.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It was great, and we did not go to any Ellis Island or anything like that. United States\nimmigration people came on board, and interrogated us on board, as I remember.",
        "A: We disembarked in New Jersey, got into a taxi, and went into the tunnel, which was very\nimpressive to go through, and my father was saying, \u201cThis 1s under the Hudson which\nwe\u2019re going now.\u201d It was very exciting. We went to 57\" Street and 6\" Avenue to the\nHotel Salisbury, where they had sort of apartments, small, you know.",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t. Actually, yes, because my uncle\u2019s divorced wife had married a Czech\nwho was a schoolmate of hers, and they were in the hotel next door, which is something\ncalled the, next door also on 57\" Street, something like \u2014 not the Berkshire, but\nsomething like that. Also, on 57\" Street between 6\" and 7\" Avenue. There was a\nwonderful automat, Horn and Hardart, where you could put money in and you could get\ncoffee or cocoa and it would go into a cup from out of the wall.",
        "A: No. Maybe yes, up to \u2014 yes, but with a lot of difficulty, probably no Hotel d\u2019 Angleterres\nin Geneva and-",
        "A: Yes, yes, sure. A lot of \u2014 of course, there were a lot of people including very good friends\nof ours who had children already outside the country. This is a rather interesting thing.\nThis was a very prominent Jewish family. In fact, at one time, the father was the head of\nthe Jewish community in Zagreb, and he had two daughters living in South Carolina, in\nDillon, South Carolina, planted paprika.",
        "A: Paprika, because you couldn\u2019t get any paprika from Hungary anymore so this was the\nbusiness, and they had gone a year earlier to the United States to find out what, you\nknow, where paprika could be \u2014 what would be the best land and climate for paprika and\nthat was Dillon, South Carolina, and they had a paprika plantation, believe it or not. And\nthese parents \u2014 although, my father went to before we left, and they had two daughters\nand family, they could\u2019ve easily come along. People were afraid. These people could\u2019ve\ndone it, and other people that I know could have easily done it, and thought, \u201cOh, no,\nwe'll get out.\u201d So, it was quite strange how this functioned. More people definitely could\nhave helped themselves. I\u2019m not saying young people who had no money, but there were\nvery prominent Jewish and non-Jewish families that could\u2019ve done it.",
        "A: I think it was in the beginning. Later on, no.",
        "A: Later on I became \u2014 at first, you know, we\u2019re in a hotel that had a kitchenette and a\ncloset. We thought this was absolutely wonderful. We went to a five and ten and bought \u2014\nmy brother and I went to buy things with, you know, with flowers on it, for heaven\u2019s\nsakes, mugs with flowers. We\u2019d never seen it. I thought this was terrific, like four spoons\nand so on. And then my father decided before we moved \u2014 we then moved later on to\nRiverdale, in New York, and my brother went to school there for some time. Fieldstone\nSchool, I think it was called. He bought a car.",
        "A: No, my father bought a car. No, Mario, the first summer, was sent to camp in Maine, and\nwe bought a car and got a chauffer, and traveled through New England.",
        "A: That was fabulous, and then finally when we came back we took apartment. But I\nremember buying the car and having to pay cash because our, whatever account we had,\nbank account was blocked because we were aliens probably.",
        "A: I think so, for a little bit.\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "A: May.",
        "A: Oh, wait a minute, I\u2019m trying to think, I think 1t would have been early June or May,\nmaybe like you know the manifest is there. We can see it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, but he became as soon as he joined the army, almost immediately.",
        "A: It was obvious that they were going to recruit him anyhow.",
        "A: Yes, and at the time when he got him, he was told to change his name. He was going to\nbe sort of an interpreter, but never was anything. He died in, near Sainte-Me\u00e9re-Eglise,\nwhich was horrible battle in Normandy. He was in Texas and New Jersey and so on, 1s\nwhere he got his basic training, and it \u2014 whoever his officer was said, \u201cListen, 1t would be\na good idea if you changed your name because they can find out this way. It won\u2019t be so\nobvious right away.\u201d And he did, and then my uncle changed his name also, Felix to\nSorel. And I don\u2019t know why because this name, what\u2019s not clear to me is because when I\nwas doing the broadcasting to Yugoslavia, sort of a women\u2019s program, whether I first\nused Sorel, whether my brother first used Sorel, I don\u2019t remember. It was one way like\nthat, except all my friends who heard knew \u2014 it was in Yugoslavia.",
        "A: That was a fairly interesting thing. There was no Voice of America when I joined. It was\nsomething that was sort of a precursor of OSS, and there was something called, I believe,\nthe analysis section, and I looked at the papers, and I think it was \u201943 maybe, and I was\ndoing some research in \u2014 language research \u2014 at the library in New York, and then there\nwas a Balkan desk where, again, I wasn\u2019t doing much. I was doing translations and\nnothing much. Then, this guy that I told you that was doing the broadcasting from Paris\noriginally, was doing broadcasting in \u2014 it wasn\u2019t even Voice of America, I think it was\nstill part of Coordinated Information, if I\u2019m not mistaken, 1s what it was called. But they\nhad broadcasting facilities. So, from the same place where Voice of America was, he was\nbroadcasting there, and I was translating it into English for the censors. Then, the man got\nsick, and I was the one who was broadcasting, and I had to end the \u2014 I said who I was\nbecause they knew who he was and so on, and I said I was broadcasting in his name, and\nit ended up, \u201cMay God save King Peter forever. May God save forever King Peter of\nYugoslavia.\u201d This was for about six weeks or so, I believe, I was doing it, and then\nfinally something like the Balkan desk was established which was under \u2014 the chief was\nan Albanian, of all things, then there was some Greeks who had been \u2014 they were been\nshuttled back and forth, and I don\u2019t think that we actually broadcast as Voice of America\nin Serbo-Croatian until \u201944 probably, and so that\u2019s that.",
        "A: Yeah.\n?",
        "A: Very soon. My mother was at home alone, and a Western Union person came in.",
        "A: Western Union came with a telegram, and I remember I was at the hairdresser after work,\nand I called to say, \u201cI\u2019m coming home. I\u2019m sorry, do you need anything along the way?\u201d\nThen we were living on 102\u2122 and Riverside Drive, and she said, \u201cThis man just handed\nthis.\u201d So, my father was in the mustard business in Brooklyn, and \u2014 which was quite a\nstrange thing, and he came home. It was horrendous. It was horrendous. I can\u2019t tell you\nhow horrendous. On the other hand, it was happening all over. There were several\nfamilies, friends of ours, who had lost, in the States, sons. So, it was in the middle of this\nwhole dreadful trauma for everybody. We weren\u2019t the one that was picked out as the only\none to live through, you know, badly. The training that they had, I don\u2019t even know how\nlong the basic training was, and he was in Germany \u2014 in Britain for a while, and he wrote\na letter that made us know where he was, and he\u2019s buried in Saint-Laurent, you know,\nthat big cemetery.",
        "A: Oh, several times. I went, the first time I went there, it was still only wooden markers, no\nMogen David there, and then there was one British person who was an administrator, and\nthen of course, it went on to became this super, huge, enormous cemetery which has lost\nsome. I mean, in a way that more moving and impressive, and in another way, it\u2019s less,\nbecause this was, so to speak, raw earth, just lines and lines of wooden crosses, and with\nnames on them, that\u2019s all there was. And then we lived in France in the \u201960s. So, we went\nseveral times. This was a decision my parents made, especially my father. He said, \u201cYou\nknow this will be a grave that will be taking care of. It will not depend on whether you\u2019re\npaying some kind of duty, or somebody should be there to watch this.\u201d And I think it was\na very good decision.",
        "A: Yes, because friends of ours did, and that was better for them, and I also have a feeling\nmaybe my father wanted to save my mother more trauma. I think my mother was closer\nto my brother, then \u2014 not closer to him than to me. In a way, I think, she was closer\nbecause we were women, but this was the carrier of the name. So, that counted, and it\nwas an extremely macho society, Yugoslavia, not only, I mean, for everybody, for all\npeople, for all Jews and for everyone, Serbians.",
        "A: Oh, yeah, absolutely. I think maybe I was closer to my father. All together, he was, and\nit\u2019s crazy to say \u201cmama\u2019s boy\u2019, because that\u2019s not, you know, in that sense, but I think he\nwas more \u2014 I think he was independent. I don\u2019t know, maybe because I was older. I have\nno idea. Maybe, because he was better looking than me. He was very good looking\nperson, and I was, for a while there, a very thin child with glasses who was sloppy, and\nthat kind of thing. He was a good looking young man. So, I think \u2014 for a child, and they\nfed him well, and he got round, and I was always scrawny at that time. So, you know. I\nthink that may have been part of it. And Yugoslavia was a country where women walked\nbehind the donkey while their husbands rode. I won\u2019t say in our society, but underlying\nthat. It carries over.",
        "A: I think it affected my \u2014 my father was a soldier through four years or more, and he knew\nof the horrible possibility existed, and I mean, he didn\u2019t sit in an office during World War\nI. He was in the Russian front among going on, this, that and the other came out.\nAnd, horrible as it is, I think in a way it may have been an interesting experience for him.\nHe told a story which has nothing to do with this, but I just want to mention it. When he\ngot \u2014 I guess this must have been on the Russian/Polish border somewhere, he said that a\nman came to him who was in the Russian army and surrendered, and said that I\u2019m Jew\nsoldier (ph), and so he -my father took him home to Pozega along with his horse, and the\nman stayed I don\u2019t know how long with the family as a prisoner of war. So, he was in a\nnice regiment, hunter\u2019s regiment with nice uniforms, and so on. Although, he was in\ntrenches, and he knew how horrible \u2014 I think it\u2019s a different experience to them than to\nUS.",
        "A: He was missing in action for more than a year, the poor soul. We kept writing to each\nother, and suddenly there was no, nothing anymore.",
        "A: I was in New York. We were in New York. We were writing practically daily in New\nYork, and there was no answer, and then finally, the mother wrote me, and his insurance\npolicy was written for me, which I find incredible, I mean, they needed it probably less\nthan we did. Maybe he felt I was here, the poor refugee sitting in New York, which was\ntrue, but he made it out to me, and the mother heard \u2014 no, first he was missing in action\nfrom both of us were writing back and forth. Finally, my parents were sending food to\nEngland to her because she was in horrible shape at the time. She married a Colonel\nEnzeing (ph) of all names, and his brother, they couldn\u2019t find him, his brother. He was\nmissing in action. His brother went to look for him, in Burma, and they recognized him\nby his boots a year later in the jungle. This was \u2014 my brother\u2019s death and all of that was at\nthe same time, at about the same time. It was about the same time. For a year, more than\na year, he was missing in action, and something called the Duke of Wellington\u2019s\nregiment, and this is also bizarre to think of.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: In Zagreb, or in Croatia, far off. Some came back. Some were in camps in Italy. Others\nhad gotten from Italy to Latin America. Here\u2019s another very, very interesting thing about\n\u2014 they were helped by a group of monks, not monks, but religious, an order that was\ncalled San Rafaele, that was formed to help refugees. They help Jews. They helped\nUstashe. They helped Germans. They helped everyone. That was their job, and these\npeople took their passports to Zagreb. The Uruguayan consul had left who was Jewish,\nand was fleeing, and this is the letter I just found of eight pages, left the official seal with\nhis secretary and this order carried the passports to Zagreb under their robes, had them\nstamped, brought them back to Rome, because they had these, they were given exit visas\nfrom Italy and transit visas from Spain. That was my father\u2019s sister, husband, daughter\nand then the young man that she fell in love with and they finally married, and my uncle\nFelix somehow went to Cuba, where he sat in a sort of a holding camp because I guess\nthey didn\u2019t feel like letting people out or couldn\u2019t get enough money out of them. He\nfinally came to the States, and actually my father visited him and he had a Cuban visa at\nthat time, in \u201944 or \u201945. I think it\u2019s stamped in his passport, and then finally Felix got\nmarried to an Italian Jewish woman who was a scientist, and then they ended up in\nCaracas, Venezuela.",
        "A: No, of course. A wonderful husband who I met. He was working in Belgrade \u2014 actually,\nit was not Voice of America, it was the United States Information Agency, he established\nthe office for them in Belgrade. Before that, he was an Albania during the war \u2014 Italy,\nAlbania and so on, and we met at Voice of America. He came back to tell us how we\nwere getting, you know, how we were accepted and heard and so on. And we got\nmarried. We have two daughters. We\u2019ve lived all over the place. We lived in Venezuela\nfor I don\u2019t know how many years, six maybe, seven. Then, we came back to New York.\nWe went to Mexico, and then we had 11 years in Paris, then went back to Mexico, and\nnow we\u2019ve been here since \u2014 it\u2019s 14 years?",
        "A: No, before that, \u201947, yeah, and I got my citizenship without him. I had been here the\nlength of time. I didn\u2019t get it \u2014 1t wasn\u2019t any shorter because I had married an American\ncitizen. I got it on my own. I\u2019m very pleased with that.",
        "A: On the nose, five years after I came here, exactly, \u201946.",
        "A: Thank you very much.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: This is Zagreb, and the address is Jelacic Trg, which means Jelacic Square, which is the\nabsolute center of town, and this original house in front, which is the oldest house on that\nsquare, was built somewhere in the 1840s, maybe 1850, a very famous architect called\nFeldinger. When they started building it, Jews were still not allowed to have houses\nwithin the confines of the city, and then after that, by the time they finished, it already\nwas built and my great-grandfather lived there. It was built for two families.",
        "A: This picture is Janusevac, which is our country house built somewhere in the 1840s, and\nSo on, we were one of the last owners, I suppose, and it\u2019s about 15 miles from Zagreb.\nWe stayed there as long as there was no school. Let\u2019s say we stayed there from April\nthrough October, but as there was no central heating, we then went to town and lived on\nJelacic Trg.",
        "A: And this is the entrance hall of Janusevac, and these two bronze vases or whatever they\nare, are actually from China. This came from somebody, I don\u2019t know, friends whose\nparents were there during the Boxer Rebellion, brought it back, and I don\u2019t know how\nthey came into the family, and in the middle is this round room which we used to call the\nchapel, which \u2014 we called it the chapel because there was a \u2014 not organs, but a\nharmonium \u2014 were there, and it had a nice cupola. As children we used to dance there\nmostly.",
        "A: This is what we used to call the chapel, a round room, and I guess we used to call it the\nchapel because it was there big musical instrument that\u2019s normally in churches, and from\nthat door over leads to a drawing room which is where the piano was, and it led to the\nbalcony, the front balcony.",
        "A: This was the main drawing room, I guess. There was some original frescoes up there, but\none of them was missing so, one of them is false. There\u2019s nothing there now. Maybe\nsome shelves. I think my father had them restored, and had one of these painted\noriginally, the one on top maybe \u2014 I have no idea who the painter was of these paintings.\nThis particular stove was from my grandmother\u2019s house in town. I don\u2019t know when it\nwas brought to Janusevac. I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: This is my bedroom, and this is a portrait of my mother at age 17, and that\u2019s the only\nthing that exists. The portrait disappeared and that\u2019s all gone, and there\u2019s a wooden saint\nthere \u2014 I believe it was Saint Christopher. As I said, that\u2019s my bedroom. You can even see\nthe salon, look at that. [New picture] This is the house. This is what the country house\nlooked like after the war. According to one story \u2014 we know that the Germans kept\nammunition in the cellar, and we\u2019re told that they exploded this when they were\nretreating. On the other hand, others said that the Ustashe did it, but who knows? And,\nafter the war, there were fewer and fewer, and fewer bricks because they insisted on\nrebuilding it unnecessarily for my taste, after the war, and the peasants needed to get their\nhouses fixed. So, they just went and got all of the bricks. So, finally they had to build a\nbrickyard to rebuild it, which I think was ridiculous, and now it is apparently an archive\nof the city of Zagreb. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s inside. Dora was there. She was the last one\nthere, and it\u2019s all painted up.",
        "A: This is a group on my seventh birthday. The woman behind me, the girl behind me, was a\nyear older than the rest of, is still alive. Her son \u2014 her name is Angie Zaus (ph), her son 1s\na professor at Zagreb University. The girl in the sort of sailor suit is Zora Krajce. Her\nfather was a banker. She was killed in the most \u2014 no, she actually committed suicide by\ngoing to lie down with a bunch of people who had some infectious disease because they\ntook away her child and threw it into the Danube, frozen Danube. The girl on the other\nside is somebody by the name of Cerhov (ph), she is alive and living in Israel. The other\ngirl, her name is Rudfeld, and she was a \u2014 she lost her mother, and I don\u2019t know, she was\na classmate. The little one who 1s sitting on the chair, she was in Bergen-Belsen and she\nlost her child there. On the bottom is a cousin of mine with the dark hair, Anica Bauer\nliving in Venezuela. The next is a cousin who died. The next is my brother. The next is\nMia Bauer Pinkas, who is my cousin, who lives in Venezuela and in Geneva and in\nFlorida.",
        "A: This is my father, Manfred Sternberg. He\u2019s wearing the uniform of the Yugoslav army of\nwhich he was a captain in the reserve, and the decorations are Saint Sava and got a\nGeorgia Crown of I don\u2019t which order, but this apparently was with my brother when he\nwas killed in France.",
        "A: The other picture is me in this dress. That\u2019s an evening dress, sitting. Behind me is my\nmother, on the left \u2014 no, okay, this is Dragon Mauntner who was killed by the Nazis very\nearly on. It\u2019s almost legendary what happened to him, and the other is \u2014 on his left is\nZlata Mainic (ph), who was a good friend of mine from childhood on, he became an\nUstashe and then fled to Argentina.",
        "A: This is in a place called Glovidin Adolf which is on the northern Adriatic coast. This was\nin 1939, probably June, early June, and this is Joseph Heaton, who was then my fianc\u00e9,\nwho was an Englishman who was killed in Burma. [New picture] This is Josip Levac,\nknown as Sepa, who was our chauffer, and actually family friend. His father was \u2014\nworked for my grandfather. In the back is my cousin who died. My father gave him this\ncar when we left Yugoslavia, and he became the driver of Artukovic, the Minister of\nInterior for Croatia and he was forced to do that. [New picture] This is my brother Mario\nSternberg who was killed in Sainte-M\u00e9re-Eglise in Normandy, obviously an American\nsoldier. He was three years younger than I was, and I think this was the one formal\npicture we had of him in his uniform.",
        "A: Uh, 19, he might be 20, somewhere there.",
        "A: This is a picture of my mother Lili Sternberg, who was extremely pretentious here, which\nshe was not, taken after the war, and that\u2019s all. It\u2019s somewhere in New York. This was\ntaken in New York.",
        "A: She was very lovely, but she didn\u2019t look like this. She wasn\u2019t really stiff.",
        "A: This is my husband Morris Rosenberg. When he was working for the United States\ngovernment abroad, they were meant to wear a uniform and they hand sewn-on ranks of\ncaptain and so on, 1n case they were captured because they were working in Belgrade and\nso on, and the Germans were still around. He was 32 or 33 years old, and then worked for\nthe Office of War Information, and later became a journalist. mostly with the Associated\nPress.",
        "A: I think he \u2014 he had the uniform. I don\u2019t think so. I think as he came in, he was wearing a\nhorrible hat, green.\nEnd of Tape #6\nConclusion of Interview\n"
