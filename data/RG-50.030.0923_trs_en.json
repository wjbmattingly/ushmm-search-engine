Thank you very much for agreeing to meet with us today, and to share\nyour story. Before I ask all of the questions related to your bio, could you tell me,\nhow do you pronounce your name properly? I\u2019m not sure if I got it.",
        "Answer: That\u2019s wha \u2014 thank you for saying that, I was going to interrupt you. The\ndifferent parts of my family pronounce it differently. I pronounce it in a more\nGerman way, which is Schwarzshield(ph).",
        "Q: Schwarzshield(ph), okay.",
        "A: Cause it comes \u2014 it means black shield, or black coat of arms. However, other\nparts of my family have gone to Schwarzschild. So I am Schwarzshield(ph),\nShimon Schwarzshield(ph).",
        "Q: Schwarzshield(ph), okay. And tell me, was Shimon your name at birth?",
        "A: It wa\u20141it was my name at birth, and then 1-1\u2014 my parents, who were Orthodox\nJewish in a small town, had two lifestyles they lived by. They h \u2014 they \u2014 they had\ntheir Jewish names. My father, for example, was Abraham, and they had their\ntoken to assimilation, their Germanic names, and his Germanic name, if you\u2019ll\npardon the expression, was Adolf.\nApril 23, 2017",
        "Q: Oh no, really?",

        "Q: Siegbert.",
        "A: And then when I came to this country, I changed it to Bert. And one day in \u2014 of\ncourse in California, where else, up in a redwoods trees, I had this flash that said,\nyou've always liked the sound of Shimon, and Bert Schwarzschild is so guttural,\nand I went to all the bay \u2014 I-I went to, almost instinctively to the banks, to the social\nsecurity, everywhere, and I took back Shimon.",
        "Q: And about \u2014",
        "A: And that\u2019s about 20 years ago, or longer.",
        "Q: Oh, so when you were in your 70s already.",
        "A: Pardon? I was \u2014",
        "Q: So \u2014-",
        "A: \u2014 yeah, in my 60s, maybe.",
        "Q: In your 60s.",
        "A: Or somewhere like that.",
        "Q: So \u2014 so you had lived a great portion of your life as Bert.",
        "A: As Bert, that\u2019s right.April 23, 2017",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: I\u2014so, when I Google myself, the-there\u2019s a life at Bert, and a li \u2014 and mor \u2014 the \u2014\nand a more recent life at Shimon.",
        "Q: And just a question of curiosity, I hadn\u2019t heard that before, though I\u2019m sure\nmany, many people did so, that you have a name that 1s reflective of Orthodox\nJudaism, and then another name that is more assimilation \u2014",
        "A: Germanic Siegbert, like sieg heil. I hate to say it, you know.",
        "Q: Can you tell me, wa \u2014 was there a formal way? Did you have to se \u2014 did your\nparents have to have formal documents that had one name, or could they have both?\nBeca \u2014 I ask this, because later \u2014",
        "A: Well, when we first came here, I was Siegbert.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And \u2014 and \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s to the uni \u2014 United States?",
        "A: \u2014I was in the navy, and they used the name of Siegbert. And I \u2014 and believe it\nor not, when we came to this country as refugees, we had enemy a-alien \u2014 we ha \u2014\nwe were classi \u2014 enemy aliens, and we had an enemy alien I.D. card with my\nSiegbert on it, and we were not allowed to leave 25 miles of Jersey City, or have a\nshortwave radio, which 1s kind of an interesting thing about \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 23, 2017",
        "Q: And how long did that last, this enemy alien \u2014",
        "A: It lasted pretty much until I went into the navy, at maybe a \u2014 18, and became \u2014\nand then my parents became derivatives \u2014 got derivative citizenship paper. I\u2019m not\nsure exactly when the enemy alien category stopped. It was there for the war, I\nbelieve, for the duration of the war. So I was in the navy for the duration of the war,\nbut \u2014 but we were classified as enemy aliens.",
        "Q: Do you think you were an enemy alien while you were in the navy?",
        "A: No, I think \u2014 I \u2014 I don\u2019t know what my status was then wa \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 it opened a lot of doors, because once I was in the navy, then my parents were\n\u2014 that gave me citizenship in some strange way, and then my parents were able to \u2014\nthey exped \u2014 were able to expedite getting citizenship papers. They \u2014",
        "Q: And in Germany, do you know whether in Germany there was a way of\nrecording both your Jewish name, and your Germanic type name, officially, or was\nthat they had to choose one or the other?",
        "A: I think that we were in Germany. I was only known as Siegbert, and my father\nwas only known as Adolf. But what happened is, there were also Jewish records,\nbut what happened, what I understand from \u2014 from the archivist who \u2014 who\nrediscovered, and gave me my family tree [break]\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 23, 2017",
        "Q: \u2014 and were allowed to have land. You know, they \u2014 they weren\u2019t allowed to \u2014 I\nmean, in general, under the Russian empire, it was a different system of land\ndistribution, and who owned it. Jews managed estates, but very few had \u2014 were\nfarmers themselves. But it was another form of exclusion.",
        "A: I think that \u2014 that exclusion also went on in \u2014 in my region \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 because even though my parents were cattle dealers, and their parents \u2014 my\nfather\u2019s father was a cattle dealer, they didn\u2019t have big amounts of land. They had \u2014\nthey owned a house, in \u2014 in the village of Dettingen. And then my grandfather mo \u2014\nbought a house in Wertheim, and that\u2019s where my father and his brother moved to,\nto continue their \u2014 their cattle business, even \u2014 even though this meant \u2014 in those\ndays, ha \u2014 being a cattle dealer meant going on a bicycle every morning \u2014",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: \u2014 to all the villages, to find out who \u2014 what farmers were \u2014 were interested in\nselling a cow, or what farmers were interested in buying a cow. So my father \u2014 there\nwere no cars \u2014 he would go out on a bicycle to \u2014 and I would sit on the bicycle if I\nwent out with him, to these different villages. And he would have, in each village,\nhe would have a no \u2014 a non-Jewish schmoozer.",
        "Q: Really?April 23, 2017",
        "A: A man who was like his \u2014 his eyes and ears. And the first thing he would do in\nthe village, he would meet with the schmoozer in a beer garden, and then the\nschmoozer would tell him the latest \u2014 what farmer had his cow, wanted to sell it, or\nwanted to buy one. And then he would get \u2014 the schmoozer would get a commission",
        "Q: I was going to ask, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 if my father bought or sold a cow that he had told him about.",
        "Q: Now, did your father also have competition?",
        "A: Yes, yes, there were other Jews who were also cattle dealers. There weren\u2019t that\nmany in our region, but every Wednesday, there would be a marketplace, right near\nour house, by the river, where all of the people, the \u2014 the cow \u2014 the cattle dealers\nwould bring their cows, and farmers. And then you meet th-the \u2014 the \u2014 the people\nfrom the bigger cities, who were \u2014 worked for meat packing firms would come, and\nthere would be big negotiations, and I would hear them ar-argue over price, and\nthen there would be this \u2014 I would hear this gigantic clap. There were no invoices,\nand no purchase orders, and once that clap took place, the lives of the people were\nbehind this \u2014 this transaction.",
        "Q: Oh, how interesting.",
        "A: And that\u2019s how the cows were bought and sold in \u2014 in the \u2014April 23, 2017",
        "Q: How interesting.",
        "A: \u2014 when I was a kid. And then \u2014 and my father would so-sometimes argue, they\nwould get to so many marks \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 and before they would clap, he would also say, and 10 marks trinkgeld for the\nchildren, which meant, a additional 10 marks for my savings account.",
        "Q: And did he get it?",
        "A: And they would argue over that, and they would be included, and then I would\nfeel good, be \u2014 I never saw the money, because it went into a bank account. But it\nwould include five or 10 marks of trinkgeld for the children.",
        "Q: How cool is that?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: You know, it must have been like a \u2014 I can imagine, as a little kid, to be\naccompanying your father as he does his business is a very important role. And then\nto witness this is also interesting, cause for kids, everything 1s interesting.",
        "A: I know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And actually, you know, my biography that I\u2019m writing, I \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019m titling it,\n\u201cDrinking Krambambuli.\u201d And you probably have never heard of krambambuli,April 23, 2017\nbut what would happen is, when we got to a village, and you got into a tavern, I\nwould be thirsty, and \u2014 and \u2014 and there was a\u2014 ye \u2014 he would sometimes buy me a\nsoda, called Sharbaso(ph), which was the name of the company.",
        "Q: Sharbaso(ph)?",
        "A: Sharbaso(ph). And we \u2014 when I was in Wertheim the last time, the e \u2014 the\ndeputy mayor actually showed me an old advertising, with the name Sharbaso(ph)\non it, 1t doesn\u2019t exist any more. Which was a name of an early pop \u2014 pop drink.",
        "Q: What did it taste like?",
        "A: Well, it was sweet. I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m not sure any more whether it had bubbles in it. I\nthink it had bubbles.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s carbonated.",
        "A: But \u2014 but \u2014 but then he would say, every now and then, either it wasn\u2019t there, or\nhe didn\u2019t want to spend the money on it, and he would say to me, drink wasser wie\ndas liebe vieh und denke es ist Krambambuli. Which translated means, drink\nwater like the dear cows, and think it is Krambambuli, and I never knew what\nKrambambuli was until recently when I Googled it, and I found fe \u2014 [break] \u2014\nand he was depressed, and he never \u2014 he \u2014 he never really learned the language. It\u2019s\na real reversal. My mother was the ballbuster, was up from six a.m. to midnight,\nworking and cleaning the house, and sh \u2014 when we came here, she becameApril 23, 2017\nemancipated. She found a job within days, whereas my father was lucky if he could\nkeep some job in working in a butcher store, a baker, move around sacks of\nsomething, or a night watchman, he had a night watchman job, until some burglars\ncame in and \u2014 while he was asleep on one of the department store beds, and \u2014 an-\nand \u2014 and he was fired from the job, I remember that. My father was \u2014 had a hard\ntime in this country, and my mother was a ballbuster here, she \u2014 she worked from\n10 in the morning til six at night, and took care of all of us, and cooked the suppers\nin advance, or e \u2014 so my father, who would usually be \u2014 often home and\nunemployed, would heat up the stove \u2014 the \u2014 the meals for us when we \u2014 when we\ncame home from school.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: Yeah. So \u2014 so \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s very sad for him, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 so he \u2014 he was a very nostalgic, and very, as I said, romanticist. I wouldn\u2019t say\nthat he was a happy go lucky person; he wasn\u2019t. He was in World War I. He was \u2014\nhe was injured, and he \u2014 an-and he kind of had some physical suffering and pain,\nfrom broken ribs that he \u2014 he had not \u2014 not \u2014 not in a \u2014 1n battle, but he had to take\ncare of some horses, as a soldier, and one of the horses \u2014",
        "Q: Kicked him?April 23, 2017",
        "A: \u2014 kicked him in the ribs. And \u2014 and so \u2014 so a lot of people saw him as sad and\nsardonic. But on Friday night, when we \u2014 because we were Orthodox, we would \u2014\nhe would \u2014 we would lie on the couch, and he would \u2014 we would sing songs, and \u2014\nand \u2014 or he would tell the stories.",
        "Q: That was my next question, is, was he a storyteller?",
        "A: He was a storyteller also.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: A-And \u2014 and he would often read the stories, you know. But \u2014 but he also told\nstories, yeah.",
        "Q: Wa - and was this a difference from how he had been in Germany? From how\nyou remember him from Germany\u2019?",
        "A: You mean when he came here?",
        "Q: Yeah. In Germany, was he a different type of personality?",
        "A: Yes, yes. He \u2014 he still enjoyed being home, he was not a \u2014 you know, he was not\nlike some of the other Germans in the town, who were always walking to the\nmarktplatz and drinking beer in the \u2014 in the taverns. But \u2014 but in this country, he\nbecame very sedate, and in the sense that he \u2014 he would not want to leave the house.\nAnd \u2014 and if we wanted to go to a movie house, my mother, who was so full of\nApril 23, 2017\nenergy, would literally push him off the couch, push him towards the door, put a hat\non his head, to \u2014 to \u2014 to get him to go out with us.",
        "Q: That\u2019s so sad.",
        "A: And \u2014 and he would feel secure at home. He wou \u2014 he would have a stamp \u2014 he\nhad a stamp collection, and he would work on the stamp collection, or \u2014 he wasn\u2019t\nmuch of a reader. I think it was more a kind of a form of depression, you know. He\nwould say \u2014 one of his favorite phrases that I remember is, das wasser hat keine\nbalken, you know.",
        "Q: The water has no \u2014",
        "A: Locks to hold onto for s \u2014 for life support. When we talked about going out \u2014 he\nwould not vote. Well, of course, Jersey City had a very crooked mayor. But he\nwould not vote, and the only \u2014 and what would happen, he\u2019d be \u2014 he would allow\nhimself to be intimidated. The ward [indecipherable] come to our house, and\nwould insist that he go, and he literally would push him out to the precinct voting\nplace. And that\u2019s the only ti \u2014 because he felt all politicians were crooks. But he\nwould allow himself to be somewhat bamboozled, you know. Yeah.",
        "Q: Sad.",
        "A: But he was a very gentle father, and I appreciated that \u2014 that side of his. He\nactually, finally did find a profession again, because his brother and he \u2014 his brotherApril 23, 2017\nwas a housepainter, and they went into partnership again. They were partners in the\ncow business, and they went into partnership painting apartments in New York\nCity. I didn\u2019t know the exact nature of \u2014",
        "Q: Of course not, but \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 0-of \u2014 you know.",
        "Q: \u2014 but you wanted to be part of, you know \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 like \u2014 like you wanted to be part of your brother\u2019s stable.",
        "A: Because I had been such an intrinsic part. Before the Hitler era, and propaganda,\nI would spend a lot of time in their homes, I would do things with them. We \u2014 our\ntown would be flooded every year, and I have this vivid memory, the water from\nthe river would come into the streets, and we would put on \u2014 we would put on our\nstilt \u2014 we would take stilts and we would play in the water, or we\u2019d bicycle through\nthe water, you know. We did all kinds of kid stuff, or we would go up to the\nhaider(ph) where \u2014 and we\u2019d scale the walls of the castle. The castle was broken\ndown. We did things that now are so verboten \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 it isn\u2019t even funny. They reconstructed the castle, it\u2019s called Klein Heidelberg,\nsmall Heidelberg, you know. And it\u2019s now beautiful, and there are concerts and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 23, 2017\nmusical events, and restaur \u2014 restaurants and everything in that castle. But when we\nwere there, was a ruin. And there was fences \u2014 a hole in, that we would go to. It\nwasn\u2019t even covered. And the \u2014 and we were told that \u2014 there were all these\nfolklores, that the \u2014 the robber baron for our castle would kidnap rich merchants,\nput them in the bottom of this dungeon until they got ransom, and if they didn\u2019t get\nransom, they remained \u2014",
        "Q: There.",
        "A: \u2014 remained there. And we used to go and throw rocks down to \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 to\nsee this [phone ringing] \u2014 that\u2019s okay \u2014 to see how long it would take for the rock\nto hit bottom, you know, in this dungeon. [break] \u2014 the glass making factories\nthere, and \u2014 and so they had been expropriated, and they had been refugees, and\nthey had experienced some of the problems that it \u2014 Jews had. So they were\namongst the \u2014 a major initiative to fund and bring back the Jews to Wertheim.",
        "Q: How interesting.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: How interesting.",
        "A: And I met many of them, and one of them, who was one of the big glass\nmanufacturers, and was the founder o-of \u2014 which is now a very famous glass\nmuseum in Wertheim, they \u2014 they offered my family this wonderful mansion\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 23, 2017\noverlooking the castle, and provided us with a VW convertible, because they\nhappened to be on vacation, and they just turned it over for us to utilize. And \u2014 and\n\u2014 and \u2014 and you know, and the other Jews who came back. When I came back \u2014 w-\nwe didn\u2019t all come at once, so there was just maybe like a \u2014 a half a dozen, or a\ndozen families who were wined and dined, and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and we were hosted\nby all these different people in Wertheim, but many of them from the \u2014 the\ncommunity of \u2014 of the \u2014",
        "Q: From Dresden, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 the east r \u2014 the east German emigres \u2014 emigres to Wertheim.",
        "Q: Well, you know, that \u2014 that\u2019s also a story in itself, is that relationship between\nwest Germans and east Germans. And \u2014",
        "A: Or was it a \u2014",
        "Q: Wessie and Ossie.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Particularly when there was still the wall there, and the different world\nexperiences that they had, the different views of one another that they had. And\ndepending on when these people came from Dresden, whether this was right after\nthe war, or before that wall became impermeable. But yes, there was a different\nsensibility, you know, in that country, which is one of the tragedies of it. Let\u2019s turn\nApril 23, 2017\nnow though, to another \u2014 a factual thing, just so that I can anchor this. Were \u2014 did\nyour parents also come back during that time, or was this just you?",
        "A: Very \u2014 it\u2019s very interesting. My brother and I each received invitation. The\nmayor had actually visited my mother and my brother, and \u2014 and \u2014 and my mother\nfell in love with him, actually. But when \u2014 when \u2014 but my family took the initiative,\nI took the initiative. My brother did not, and he refused to go back. For him, it was\nmore an emotional thing. But he had \u2014 he had actually gone to Wertheim as a G.L.,\nhe was part of the occupation force \u2014 forces that occupied Frankfurt, and \u2014 and he\nactually went t \u2014 past Wertheim, but he emotionally felt he could not return. He\nalso \u2014 wa-was a lack of forgiveness involved, also. And my uncle, the uncle I was\ntelling you about, he consider \u2014 called me a traitor for going back. I felt like I had\nunfinished business in Wertheim. I had as much unfinished business in Wertheim\nas the people who were dealing with the guilt complexes had, in inviting us back.\nAnd I felt that I wanted to get past that.",
        "Q: So I have another \u2014",
        "A: And it was \u2014 for me, I felt it was like a transaction \u2014",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 for me to go back, and \u2014 and revisit the place I had left.",
        "Q: And did you find that unfinished business, and were you able to finish it?April 23, 2017",
        "A: Yes. One of the things that I pondered over, and \u2014 and I hope \u2014 well, if you get a\nchance to read my memoirs, I wrote a poem called \u201cReturn to Wertheim.\u201d",
        "Q: Do you know it by heart?",
        "A: I think it\u2019s important, you know, maybe I should \u2014 I \u2014 I would love to read it, it\u2019s\nshort.",
        "Q: I would very much like for you to read it.",
        "A: I'd love to read it and \u2014 and then talk about it, because it \u2014 it sums up \u2014",
        "Q: Let\u2019s do that.",
        "A: \u2014 the range of feelings. Can I do that now?",
        "Q: Absolutely.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Absolutely. Let\u2019s stop for a second.",
        "A: Okay. [break]",

The\nother hundred were killed in the Holocaust, and \u2014 and we hundred, living now\ndispersed, in a modern day diaspora, from Alabama to Zurich. Was it karma, ESP,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 23, 2017\nor just luck, that within days after my moment of rec-reconciliation, I should\nreceive an invitation to return to Wertheim, as a guest of its mayor and its\nresidents, who until now, I had rejected and renounced. I returned to Wertheim\nwith apprehension and hope, to rediscover the memories I had left behind. To\nrediscover the aborted part of my childhood life. To rediscover myself. Now I\nreconnected with my classmates, who I had seen last, when they shunned me, as\nthey were dutily \u2014 dutifully indoctrinated to do in their eugenics classes, from\nwhich I and other Jewish students were excluded, where they were shown drawings\nof evil looking, long-bearded Jewish men, sucking through straw \u2014 straws, a baby\u2019s\nblood, with glee. Now I reconnected with my child within, with the pain I\u2019d felt\nthen, as one or another turned away in mid-play, remembering that I was a Jew, an\nun-Aryan, too. Now they celebrated my return, at a special class reunion, the 10\nyear olds transformed into buxom women and beer bellied men. They listened in\ndisbelief, astonishment, and sadness, to \u2014 to my last experience in Wertheim, at\ntheir hands. Quite different from what they remembered, or their consciences\nallowed them to remember. The gray haired women sobbed, tears streaming down,\nunderstanding their part in the tragedy, realizing that they too had been robbed of\ntheir childhood innocence, feeling \u2014 feeling so long repressed, and hidden from you\n\u2014 from view, by them, me, us. I\u2019ve returned to Wertheim a half dozen times, haveApril 23, 2017\nbeen welcomed by friends old and new, have received and given outpourings of\nhospitality. But occasionally uneasiness and paranoia seizes me, especially when I\nsee old strangers, my age, still envisaged them in a Nazi Brownshirt, or a black SS\nuniform. I resist blurting out, did you leave your uniform at home? Still imagine\nthem once marching and singing [speaks German]. When the Jewish blood spurts\nfrom the knife, then we will all be free. Deep physical wounds leave permanent\nscars. Mental wounds are no different. Their scars are hidden, but there, capable of\nflaring again. My return to Wertheim enabled me to revisit these wounds and scars,\nto look at them closely, to pay attention to them. But also, to see them in\nperspective. I can better deal with them now that I\u2019m more at peace, accepting that\nfor better or worse, a part of me is German. The German of a Hitler, Goebbels,\nBormann, but also the German of a Beethoven, Goethe, Einstown(ph) \u2014 Einstein,\nand Heine.\u201d",

Well, I did a little bit of maybe making\nsome corrections, but by and large, the whole thing came out because I remember\nthat when I read it, I read it in class, you know, we were like in a class, and the\nteacher asked us to read it, and she said that\u2019s a very powerful poem, you should try\nto get \u2014 read it to others, you know?

I walked past my memories, memories of singing, praying,\nchanting, of running, shouting, laughing, respectfully dressed in my young boy\u2019s\nfinest, coming and going in the house of God. Now, 40 years later, not even a wall,\nrubble, or \u2014 or ashes remain, to validate my childhood. The lives of those whoApril 23, 2017\ncongregated each Sabbath, or the lives of those who destroyed it, except the\nbittersweet and awesome memories, and the sterile, white, clean spot, where\nemptiness cannot ease the terrible deed. The synagogue of Laudenbach(ph) is\ngone, but memories linger on, with Jewish survivors and Nazi\u2019s collaborators alike,\nthose few that are still alive, contemplating their own imminent departure, their own\npast, present and future, and the final judgment being made in the hereafter of their\nlives. Sequel: I walk past that empty, holy spot, to the modest cottage across the\nstreet, where my grandparents once lived, and cross the street to pr \u2014 to pray, their\nhouse still standing, as a witness to the past, the sweet and terrible past. Except for\nthe old man in the doorway, who is quizzically eyeing Karl and me. My German\nfriend and neighbor of my childhood, who had driven me to Laudenbach(ph) to\nhelp me revisit my childhood memories. Here\u2019s Jacob\u2019s(ph) grandson from\nAmerica, Karl explained to the old man. He wants to visit his grandfather\u2019s house,\nwith your permission. Could he look inside? The old man\u2019s face went ashen. He\ntrembled, tottered, almost collapsed, then shouted, I paid Jacob(ph) for the house in\nfull. I bought it in good faith, a long time ago. He shut the white, picket gate, to\nkeep out the visiting demon from America, who had come to \u2014 to \u2014 to devour him.\nAfterwards, my friend Karl explained, no doubt that man had been a loyal Nazi,\nrewarded with a purchase of the house, bought cheaply, through blackmail and\nApril 23, 2017\nintimidation, after the terror of Kristallnacht, after the synagogue was torched. I\nleft Laudenbach(ph), resolved never to return, but carrying with me forever, those\nbittersweet memories of a synagogue that once existed, and the simple, sharing,\ncountry Jews, who were once part of my life.

And the\nmain financial initiative came from a group of ger \u2014 of Germans, of Wertheim\nresidents, who were East Germans at the end of the war. They were part of the\nglassmaking industry.

        "A: Okay, it\u2019s called \u201cReturn to Wertheim.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve made my peace with the past,\nmy peace with the Germans. Not with the SS trooper \u2014 troops who goose-stepped\npast our house one dark forbidding night, their black, shiny boots reverberating on\ncobblestones, singing, no, shouting in 0 \u2014 in cadence, when the Jewish blood spurts\nfrom the knife, then we will all be free. The tune has etched itself so deeply in the\ncells and inner rec-recesses of my brain, that I find myself humming the gruesome\nwords, and the musical cadence that emerged together, until I am startled by the\nmemory of that night, and by \u2014 and by my masochistic instinct to remember the\nevent, an epic, that turned me into a scared kid. We fled the bubbling cauldron that\nwas to become the Holocaust, and crossed the Atlantic, to the land of cowboys,\nIndians, and streets paved with gold. To jobless America, in Depression, but\nbreathing the air of freedom. As the family eked out a living, each one of us\nworking for the Yankee dollar, in order to survive and thrive, strangers 1n a strange\nland. I was hurt by our frantic, frenetic exodus, and angry too. I hated everything\nGerman, even though I was German, too. Reminding myself that my family, and the\ntown\u2019s Jewish community, too, had our roots in Wertheim since 1405 A.D., as the\ngravestones testified, before the Nazi bullies toppled and smashed them, as a finalApril 23, 2017\ninsult to the dead. Wasn\u2019t it enough that they had toppled and smashed the lives of\nthe living? I joined the navy to fight the Germans, and was sent to the Pacific, in\ntrue snafu fashion, to fight the Japanese instead. In the postwar era, I shunned\neverything German. I refused to socialize and fraternize with Germans. I refused to\nbuy anything German. I refused to make love to Germans. I refused to ride in a\nGerman car, especially the Volkswagen that Hitler had extolled. Until one day, I\nconfronted myself with this enigma. Hitler stereotyped all Jews, as universally evil,\nto be excised, gassed, eradicated, destroyed. Now, I was stereotyping all Germans,\nshunning and reviling them, finding them all universally guilty, declaring them all\nuniversally responsible for the death of seven million Jewish brethrens. I woke up to\nthe realization that postwar Germans who were born after Hitler, were as guilty of\nthe Holocaust cruelties, as I was guilty of the native American holocaust that\noccurred 100 years ago, right here in California, a bounty on their scalps. Right\nhere, in the good old USA, the land of Washington and Lincoln, the land of\nWounded Knee, and My Lai massacres, and many more. So I made a conscious\ndecision to stop my own brand of blind hate and intolerance. The same kind that I\nexperienced from the Nazi bullies in their time, who shouted obscenities and insults\nat me, without ever bothering to know me. A heavy weight lifted from my\nshoulders, the good vibes that I now felt, must have echoed, reverberated,\nApril 23, 2017\nricocheted around the world, and must have found the psychic antennas on the roof\nof Wertheim city hall, must have been received and heard by Josef Scheuermann,\nWertheim\u2019s democratic mayor, who was scouring the world, searching for the\ntown\u2019s 100 living Jewish survivors, out of \u2014\u2019 [break] \u2014 group therapy, they \u2014 and\nyou know, I didn\u2019t learn very much about how the \u2014 what happened in their lives.\nTha-That maybe \u2014 maybe if I should go back again, that would be something I sh \u2014\nreally should explore, except not \u2014 there\u2019s only one classmate left, and he is sort of\nmy friend and host.

We had a MH \u2014 a department\nstore in the town, Max(ph) Held, h-e-I-d was the name, Max(ph) Held was the\nowner, Held was the department store. And they would have the Brownshirts in\nfront of the Jewish businesses, to censor, or \u2014 anybody who \u2014 any non-Jew who \u2014April 23, 2017\nwho went into the store. And they would economically get back to \u2014 at them. And\nof course, Hitler passed all kinds of laws; one in particular had affected my father,\nthat if you owed any debts to a Jew, you didn\u2019t have to pay back. So my father, his\nbusiness depended on the \u2014 the crop next summer, you know. If a farmer bought a\ncow from him, he would pay the debt back maybe a \u2014 when the \u2014 when the crops\ncame in. So \u2014 so a lot of those farmers stopped doing any business with my father,\nbecause they decided that the law allowed them not to pay my father back. And \u2014\nand I remember, I have this one very vivid memory of waking up like one, two in\nthe morning. We had like a bell, an old fashioned bell which you pull, in front of\nour house. And the bell pulled, and I went to the window, I woke up, and I saw a\nfarmer standing there, with a cow. Because he did not \u2014 he wanted to transact a sale,\nbut he did not want to be seen by anyone \u2014",
        "Q: But he was doing it.",
        "A: \u2014 selling \u2014 doing a transaction with my father. And that was the economic side of\nit, you know. This fre \u2014 person, Karl Stahl(ph), he \u2014 he comes from fa \u2014 he was\nright across the street, he \u2014 he was a carpenter, he had a carpentry shop, and I\npractically lived there.

And his \u2014 his father was a \u2014\nwas a social democrat, so when the \u2014 when everybody started doing, you know, heil\nHitler, you know, that was the greeting, he \u2014 he w \u2014 he \u2014 he refused. He would spit.\nAnd he got away with it, Karl\u2019s father, because Karl was a glider enthusiast, and\nhe learned to \u2014 glider flying, and ultimately he was drafted into \u2014 or joined into the\n\u2014 the \u2014 the air force in \u2014",

And you \u2014 a-and he would, if they heil \u2014 said heil\nHitler, and I remember, as a child him doing that once, he would take his hat off\nand say, griss gott. And he got \u2014 ultimately did get jailed. I don\u2019t know whether it\nwas for doing that very act, but maybe for other non-participation, that he ac \u2014 that\nhe \u2014 where he did not want to join the \u2014 the Nazi machine, like everyone that was\nsupposed to.",

There\u2019s a logic German part of\nme, especially now that I\u2019m 91, where I have to do everything very careful, but I\nthink even earlier, maybe being methodical.

And \u2014 and well, there\u2019s\nanother chapter in my biography, to give you an example. One of the woman who\nwas there, Inga(ph), she\u2019s still alive, and when I went back six months ago, she and\nher daughter, we \u2014 we \u2014 we connected, and all of that. And \u2014 and she was there.\nAnd her husband was the special coordinator of the mayor, to welcome the Jews,\nthat was his job. He was also a correspondent, and a \u2014 a newspaper reporter. And \u2014\nand one day, when we got all the \u2014 we got all this publicity. And my first wife was\nPolish Jewish, you know, and we\u2019re \u2014 and \u2014 and very much more paranoid and\nsuspicious. And \u2014 and we \u2014 I \u2014I felt that \u2014 that we were getting all this \u2014 this\nwelcome mat was almost too much, you know? So I wanted my children to see\nwhat total reality was. I want \u2014 so I\u2014I wanted us to go to Dachau. And I told\nIngrid \u2014 Inga(ph) that we were going to Dachau. This is the woman who 1s the\nwife of the \u2014\nApril 23, 2017",

This is the other thing that\u2019s hard to grasp, you know? Every\ntime \u2014 I think that all the people there, whether they were guilty or not, appreciate\nso much that someone Jewish was willing to go back and \u2014 and \u2014 and have some \u2014",
        "Q: Engagement.",
        "A: \u2014 engagement and acceptance. And whenever I went back, they were maj \u2014\nmajor newspaper stories about my return. And I have no idea who did it, but one\nday I went and discovered I \u2014 that I had a wi \u2014 a Wikipedia, I was on Wikipedia.\nMy suspicion is it was Friedrich(ph), Inga\u2019s(ph) husband, who is a reporter. I \u2014 I\ncan\u2019t imagine. I don\u2019t even know how you get on Wikipedia, you know. And the\nthing that I noticed on there was that it \u2014 at the end of the story of Wertheim, the\n1400s, the 1300s, etcetera, it says, Wertheim is the home of \u2014 of \u2014 of \u2014 of Shimon\nBert Schwarzschild, the famous environmentalist. And I \u2014 I just suspected it had to\nbe him, you know? And \u2014 and on my 90\" birthday, the town archivist did a major\nstory of my \u2014 not only of my family, my current family, he went all the way back to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 23, 2017\n1803, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a\u2014a major story of about three columns, of the life of the\nSchwarzschild family, you know. And I \u2014 I probably am somewhat seduced by\nwhat I see as people who \u2014 not \u2014 it\u2019s not a matter of adulation, it\u2019s people who have\nan appreciation for the fact that I survived, that I\u2019m from Wertheim, and \u2014 and \u2014\nand guilt.

        "Q: Uh-oh.",
        "A: And he was jailed for two weeks. And of \u2014 you know, at that point, all \u2014 all the\nJewish people there, they \u2014 they saw Hitler as some bizarre phenomena, especially\nin Wertheim, because those people had been there for multi, multi, multi-\ngenerations. It would blow over. It was a thing that would blow over. And they \u2014\nand \u2014 and some of them laughed when my father \u2014 and my father decided he did not\nwant to s \u2014 that was when he first decided he\u2019s not going to stay in this\nenvironment. And we had \u2014 we had only one distant relative. It was the widow. She\nwas a southern Jewish belle, who was married to a distant cousin of my father, who\nhad already died in Jersey City. And we wrote \u2014 that\u2019s the only American address\nwe had. And so, my father or my mother wrote a letter to her, Aunt Bertha, and \u2014\nand asked if she would get us a visa, because this is yel \u2014 total misunderstanding of\nApril 23, 2017\nmost people. They think, why did those 900,000 Jews, why didn\u2019t they just go, you\nknow?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Even if you wanted to go, you can\u2019t go unless you have a \u2014 a legal document, to\nallow you out. I mean, after Kristallnacht, some people would flee. And if they had\nnon-Jewish friends who would hide them, they would find their way across the\nborder. But no \u2014 normally, you couldn\u2019t go. So sh \u2014 sh \u2014 he sent this letter asking\nfor a visa, and she had to get it translated, she \u2014 she \u2014",

Y-You \u2014 you had\nApril 23, 2017\nto have your \u2014 a bank account that, you know, in case someone couldn\u2019t make a\nliving.

        "A: That\u2019s a story. You were not al \u2014 Jews were not allowed to leave with any\nmoney. We were able to have a lift \u2014 we had a small \u2014 was a crate, where we had\nsome of our belongings. We didn\u2019t bring furniture, but linen, and you know,\nbelongings of that sort.",
        "Q: Household things, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. But the law was very strict about money, or valuables. And what\nhappened is, my Uncle David, and unc \u2014 the uncle who lived in Wiirzburg,\naccompanied us to the ship in Bremen, at Bremerhaven.

And I got a very high\ngrade. So they send me to what was then the hottest kind of training, which was\nradar and electronic technician training.

That was the time of the kamikazes, who were \u2014 and\n\u2014and they were early warning ships for kamikaze suicide planes. So I was in this\nteam, and my job was, I would be in the \u2014 the raid \u2014 the room which had the radar,\nwas called the CI, combat information center. And I would have a dual earphone\non, and I would watch the blips on the radar, and if \u2014 and if \u2014 and when we saw a \u2014\nan approaching kamikaze, I would man \u2014 I would maneuver that our pilots would\nscramble from the airport \u2014 from the air \u2014 airfield in Okinawa, and my job was to\nmaneuver our plane until it would make contact, radar and eye contact with the\nkamikaze. And then they would say, tally-ho, and my job was over. And \u2014 but you\nknow, it didn\u2019t always work as beautifully as it sounds, because there were many\nkamikazes who crashed into picket ships, because they knew that the picket ships \u2014\nthese were destroyers, all the way al \u2014 all in different spots around the island. They\n109\nApril 23, 2017\nknew that these picket ships were early warning ships.

That\u2019s what I heard the\nfigure was. I haven\u2019t \u2014 I need to Google that, I haven\u2019t Googled that. But as a result\nof that, the navy passed a special, ironclad ordinance that any navy ship that gets\nbelow 40 percent of its fuel, 1t must go get refueled, because of that disaster. And\nso, my picket ship were \u2014 ha \u2014 went below 40 percent. We immediately headed for\nthe island to get refueled. We were just over the horizon when the pick \u2014 the \u2014\nanother ship had been sent out to take our place, got a direct hit from a kamikaze.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 23, 2017\nOn the back of the ship where \u2014 which was my battle station.

Much, much later.

I returned to Wertheim\nwith apprehension and hope, to rediscover the memories I had left behind. To\nrediscover the aborted part of my childhood life. To rediscover myself. Now I\nreconnected with my classmates, who I had seen last, when they shunned me, as\nthey were dutily \u2014 dutifully indoctrinated to do in their eugenics classes, from\nwhich I and other Jewish students were excluded, where they were shown drawings\nof evil looking, long-bearded Jewish men, sucking through straw \u2014 straws, a baby\u2019s\nblood, with glee. Now I reconnected with my child within, with the pain I\u2019d felt\nthen, as one or another turned away in mid-play, remembering that I was a Jew, an\nun-Aryan, too. Now they celebrated my return, at a special class reunion, the 10\nyear olds transformed into buxom women and beer bellied men. They listened in\ndisbelief, astonishment, and sadness, to \u2014 to my last experience in Wertheim, at\ntheir hands. Quite different from what they remembered, or their consciences\nallowed them to remember. The gray haired women sobbed, tears streaming down,\nunderstanding their part in the tragedy, realizing that they too had been robbed of\ntheir childhood innocence, feeling \u2014 feeling so long repressed, and hidden from you\n\u2014 from view, by them, me, us. I\u2019ve returned to Wertheim a half dozen times, haveApril 23, 2017\nbeen welcomed by friends old and new, have received and given outpourings of\nhospitality.

Deep physical wounds leave permanent\nscars. Mental wounds are no different. Their scars are hidden, but there, capable of\nflaring again.

I can better deal with them now that I\u2019m more at peace, accepting that\nfor better or worse, a part of me is German.

Now, 40 years later, not even a wall,\nrubble, or \u2014 or ashes remain, to validate my childhood. The lives of those whoApril 23, 2017\ncongregated each Sabbath, or the lives of those who destroyed it, except the\nbittersweet and awesome memories, and the sterile, white, clean spot, where\nemptiness cannot ease the terrible deed. The synagogue of Laudenbach(ph) is\ngone, but memories linger on, with Jewish survivors and Nazi\u2019s collaborators alike,\nthose few that are still alive, contemplating their own imminent departure, their own\npast, present and future, and the final judgment being made in the hereafter of their\nlives. Sequel: I walk past that empty, holy spot, to the modest cottage across the\nstreet, where my grandparents once lived, and cross the street to pr \u2014 to pray, their\nhouse still standing, as a witness to the past, the sweet and terrible past. Except for\nthe old man in the doorway, who is quizzically eyeing Karl and me. My German\nfriend and neighbor of my childhood, who had driven me to Laudenbach(ph) to\nhelp me revisit my childhood memories. Here\u2019s Jacob\u2019s(ph) grandson from\nAmerica, Karl explained to the old man. He wants to visit his grandfather\u2019s house,\nwith your permission. Could he look inside? The old man\u2019s face went ashen. He\ntrembled, tottered, almost collapsed, then shouted, I paid Jacob(ph) for the house in\nfull. I bought it in good faith, a long time ago. He shut the white, picket gate, to\nkeep out the visiting demon from America, who had come to \u2014 to \u2014 to devour him.\nAfterwards, my friend Karl explained, no doubt that man had been a loyal Nazi,\nrewarded with a purchase of the house, bought cheaply, through blackmail and\nApril 23, 2017\nintimidation, after the terror of Kristallnacht, after the synagogue was torched. I\nleft Laudenbach(ph), resolved never to return, but carrying with me forever, those\nbittersweet memories of a synagogue that once existed, and the simple, sharing,\ncountry Jews, who were once part of my life.

And the\nmain financial initiative came from a group of ger \u2014 of Germans, of Wertheim\nresidents, who were East Germans at the end of the war. They were part of the\nglassmaking industry. They were the craftspeople who lived in the Dresden area.\nAnd when the Russians came and invaded, they fled.

Not with the SS trooper \u2014 troops who goose-stepped\npast our house one dark forbidding night, their black, shiny boots reverberating on\ncobblestones, singing, no, shouting in 0 \u2014 in cadence, when the Jewish blood spurts\nfrom the knife, then we will all be free. The tune has etched itself so deeply in the\ncells and inner rec-recesses of my brain, that I find myself humming the gruesome\nwords, and the musical cadence that emerged together, until I am startled by the\nmemory of that night, and by \u2014 and by my masochistic instinct to remember the\nevent, an epic, that turned me into a scared kid. We fled the bubbling cauldron that\nwas to become the Holocaust, and crossed the Atlantic, to the land of cowboys,\nIndians, and streets paved with gold. To jobless America, in Depression, but\nbreathing the air of freedom. As the family eked out a living, each one of us\nworking for the Yankee dollar, in order to survive and thrive, strangers 1n a strange\nland. I was hurt by our frantic, frenetic exodus, and angry too. I hated everything\nGerman, even though I was German, too. Reminding myself that my family, and the\ntown\u2019s Jewish community, too, had our roots in Wertheim since 1405 A.D., as the\ngravestones testified, before the Nazi bullies toppled and smashed them, as a finalApril 23, 2017\ninsult to the dead. Wasn\u2019t it enough that they had toppled and smashed the lives of\nthe living? I joined the navy to fight the Germans, and was sent to the Pacific, in\ntrue snafu fashion, to fight the Japanese instead. In the postwar era, I shunned\neverything German. I refused to socialize and fraternize with Germans. I refused to\nbuy anything German. I refused to make love to Germans. I refused to ride in a\nGerman car, especially the Volkswagen that Hitler had extolled. Until one day, I\nconfronted myself with this enigma. Hitler stereotyped all Jews, as universally evil,\nto be excised, gassed, eradicated, destroyed. Now, I was stereotyping all Germans,\nshunning and reviling them, finding them all universally guilty, declaring them all\nuniversally responsible for the death of seven million Jewish brethrens. I woke up to\nthe realization that postwar Germans who were born after Hitler, were as guilty of\nthe Holocaust cruelties, as I was guilty of the native American holocaust that\noccurred 100 years ago, right here in California, a bounty on their scalps. Right\nhere, in the good old USA, the land of Washington and Lincoln, the land of\nWounded Knee, and My Lai massacres, and many more. So I made a conscious\ndecision to stop my own brand of blind hate and intolerance. The same kind that I\nexperienced from the Nazi bullies in their time, who shouted obscenities and insults\nat me, without ever bothering to know me. A heavy weight lifted from my\nshoulders, the good vibes that I now felt, must have echoed, reverberated,\nApril 23, 2017\nricocheted around the world, and must have found the psychic antennas on the roof\nof Wertheim city hall, must have been received and heard by Josef Scheuermann,\nWertheim\u2019s democratic mayor, who was scouring the world, searching for the\ntown\u2019s 100 living Jewish survivors, out of \u2014\u2019 [break] \u2014 group therapy, they \u2014 and\nyou know, I didn\u2019t learn very much about how the \u2014 what happened in their lives.\nTha-That maybe \u2014 maybe if I should go back again, that would be something I sh \u2014\nreally should explore, except not \u2014 there\u2019s only one classmate left, and he is sort of\nmy friend and host. And you know, there are a lot of unanswered questions, and \u2014\nand I \u2014 I \u2014I s\u2014 don\u2019t know what a lot of the people were doing. They were all\ncaught up in \u2014 in their lives. My br \u2014 the one classmate who\u2019s left was \u2014 was in \u2014\nconscripted in the army, was sent to Russia, was \u2014 became a prisoner of war for two\nyears, or three years, he was in a Russian \u2014 the worst possible condition Ru-Russian\nprison camp, and he survived, and ultimately he came back. I don\u2019t know whether\nhe joined the Nazi party or not, the chances are, he did. Everybody did. Ye-Ye-Ye \u2014\nI remember that even as a child, if you \u2014 if you wanted to \u2014 th-the \u2014 the bully boys,\nthe Brownshirts, would boycott stores, Jewish stores. We had a MH \u2014 a department\nstore in the town, Max(ph) Held, h-e-I-d was the name, Max(ph) Held was the\nowner, Held was the department store. And they would have the Brownshirts in\nfront of the Jewish businesses, to censor, or \u2014 anybody who \u2014 any non-Jew who \u2014April 23, 2017\nwho went into the store. And they would economically get back to \u2014 at them. And\nof course, Hitler passed all kinds of laws; one in particular had affected my father,\nthat if you owed any debts to a Jew, you didn\u2019t have to pay back. So my father, his\nbusiness depended on the \u2014 the crop next summer, you know. If a farmer bought a\ncow from him, he would pay the debt back maybe a \u2014 when the \u2014 when the crops\ncame in. So \u2014 so a lot of those farmers stopped doing any business with my father,\nbecause they decided that the law allowed them not to pay my father back. And \u2014\nand I remember, I have this one very vivid memory of waking up like one, two in\nthe morning. We had like a bell, an old fashioned bell which you pull, in front of\nour house. And the bell pulled, and I went to the window, I woke up, and I saw a\nfarmer standing there, with a cow.
