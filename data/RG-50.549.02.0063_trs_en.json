        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.\nThis is an interview with Mr. Norman Belfer, conducted by Arwin Donohue, on March\nfirst, 2000. This is tape number one, side A, and this is a follow up interview to a\nvideotaped interview that was conducted with Mr. Belfer, in 1995. So, let\u2019s begin by --\nI\u2019m just going to correct a mistake, it was -- the first interview with Mr. Belfer was done\non May 31\u201c, 1996, on videotape. Okay. I wanted to start by asking you a little bit more,\ngoing back to before the war. I wanted to ask you about your hometown, Wodzislaw?",
        "Answer: Yes.",
        "Q: Is that how you pronounce it?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And I wanted you to say, first of all, something about your family\u2019s history in that\narea.",
        "A: We live in that town, my aunts, and my -- not only my parents, my grandparents were\nborn there. And we were ver -- respected citizens of that town. My grandfather, and my\nfather were running a business, and eventually my brothers helped also, alongside. The\nbusiness was a processing of feathers, and down, which they exported from Poland to the\nUnited States, and -- and several European countries. And during the peace time, that\ntown was a very small -- I\u2019m not certain how many people, but less than 10,000, and\nprimarily Jewish. And I -- I lived there for my first, let\u2019s say 12\" -- 12 years or so.\nSubsequently, I moved to Krakow.",
        "Q: I -- \u2019'm sorry, I\u2019m going to interrupt you a little bit --",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: -- because I don\u2019t want you to feel like you have to repeat what you talked about in the\nvideo. My -- the reason that I asked you about Wodzislaw is that I wondered -- your --\nyour family had a long history in the town. I wondered if you -- after the war, you felt a\nsense of connection with the place, if you ever visited again. Anything more about that.",
        "A: Yes. The only connection about that town was that I went back to Poland only one\ntime. This was a dozen years ago, more or less. I think maybe more. There was a first\nmarch of Holocaust survivors and their children from -- to -- to Auschwitz a-and\nBirkenau, The March of the Living. And I -- I was one of them, and there were many\nothers from United States, and Canada, even Australia, South Africa. There were about\n2,000 young people. College -- college or high school age. And it was a very moving\nexperience. There were very -- dignitaries from Israel, and the former president, Ithzrak\nNavonne. He ray -- he was s-speaking, you know, to us about it, and it\u2019s -- was extremely\nmoving, and very, very upsetting, of course. Wi-With me went our -- one of our sons,\nAndrew went wi-with me on that trip, and also one nephew, Ben Belfer, and two c-\ncousins. And we were received by the Polish government, extremely well. They had all\nkinds of preparations, invited us to the Senate building, gave a couple parties, you know,\ncocktail parties, where we me-met Russian ge -- Russian generals. One of the Russian\ngenerals spoke Yiddish. And also they per -- had a -- performed a Jewish show in one of\ntheir Senate -- what do call them there, Senate building, it was a theater there, a theater\nbuilding. The show was all done ba -- mostly in -- in -- in Yiddish, Jewish, and some in --\nin the -- in Polish. During intermission, I went over to the person who, I was very\nimpressed with her singing. And I ask her how did she learn that, she was quite a young\nperson. She says from -- there was a cantor, before World War Two in Poland, and he --\nhe survived the war, and he had a lot of records, and she learned it from the records, you\nknow. The Polish government gave a special reception, because the following day, I\nremember, after the -- after they had that big performance, we had -- they invited about\n40 people, I was one of them, to the -- the assistant to -- General Yarowzelski, and he\ngave a whole speech about the Jewish people should come back to Poland, they lived\nthere for a thousand years, and since the Jewish people left -- most of them left, they were\n-- culturally, and business-wise, and -- and in many other aspects, you know, were\ncompletely eradicated, you know. There\u2019s no -- no industry, the -- and they had -- a\nmatter of fact, ask everyone what type of profession or business, and when I told them\nwhat my parents used to do, say, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come back, we will build a plant, we\u2019ll\ndo this and that.\u201d So after he gave a whole big speech, the former president of Israel,\nIthzrak Navonne said, \u201cToo little, too late.\u201d He spoke very fluent English. He said, \u201cWhat\nhappened,\u201d and give all kinds of dates, \u201cwhen the Jewish people came back to Poland, as\nthey came to their hometowns, what happened to them?\u201d He said, \u201cOh well, it\u2019s a\ndifferent regime.\u201d He asked, during certain dates, you know, so the -- there were all kinds\nof ordinances, you know, and if people came to the town, they would -- they were either\nshot, or they had to flee town, because their homes were occupied by Polish people, and\nthey didn\u2019t want to -- they felt they may want to reclaim their property. So they had to\nflee. As a matter of fact, a school-mate of mine, he and two other people came back to\ntown. Their house was all mostly demolished, but they had no place to stay, they stayed\nthere. So one late afternoon, they knocked at the door, and my friend opened the door,\nand they shot him. So the other two left, you know. So my memories about it, is I would\nnever want to go back there again. As a matter of fact, yes, I still remember, when I was\nthere, with my son -- in -- in Wodzislaw, my son and my nephew, my cousins, we -- we\nrented a -- a car, you know. And we escorted to the cem -- I didn\u2019t remember where the\ncemetery is -- the Jewish cemetery is. We went to the cemetery, and there was not o-one\ntombstone [indecipherable] not at all. And there was a -- young kids, who were -- they\nsaw a car there, they saw, you know, they saw people dressed differently, whatever. They\ncame over and started -- I said -- you know, we asked him what about the cem -- what\nhappened to the cemetery. They were teenagers, actually. Oh, well they were demolished.\nAnd they -- you want to see res -- where the tombstones are? They were -- they made\nwalkways out of them, they made stables [indecipherable] floors, and so on.",
        "Q: You had family, I assume -- you had family who was buried there, I assume?",
        "A: Yes. I had f -- my grandparents were buried there, and other relatives.",
        "Q: Did you -- while you were there, did you see any people -- any Gentiles you had\nknown before the war?",
        "A: No, but I did meet some pe -- a couple who helped -- that couple -- these were\nchildren of people were -- my parents and three sisters, and two children were -- were\nhiding for a couple months. And the parents were not alive, but I\u2019ve been in touch with\nthe daughter of -- and the son-in-law. They came to visit me, to Warsaw, and we met in\nthe hotel. Of course, I was very warm to them, and I gave them a certain as -- cert-certain\n-- in Poland, it was a substantial amount of money. So a -- they appreciate it, and they --\nthey do write, send me a Christmas card, or -- or write to me from time to time.",
        "Q: You mentioned this family in your first interview, and -- and you also mentioned that\nthey had -- they had disappointed you and your family by really not -- by asking for more\nand more money when they were hiding, and -- and behaving somewhat --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- less than honorably. I\u2019m wondering how you felt about meeting with them after the\nwar?",
        "A: I still f -- had a -- I would say a warm feeling for them, because they did risk their\nlives by helping, and the money, obviously, ha -- we had -- 1 -- if I -- I do remember that,\nwe had a manager in one of our plants in Krakow, you know, manager who managed the\nfeather and down business. He would go every two weeks to the place, and make sure\nhow -- how my parents are, and my -- and the -- and the -- and the sisters, and s -- and the\nchildren. And he would give money to that family for food, and other things, whatever. I\ndon\u2019t know how much. My father felt 1f he has a money with him [indecipherable] the\nmoney wasn\u2019t so much valuable any more, but they would keep some jewelry, or some\ngold coins, or whatever, just for emergency. He was afraid that if he gives it all in one\ntime, maybe the guy -- they were na -- she was always so -- they weren\u2019t sure, maybe, he\nwould get tired of us. And it became also, very impossible to live there for a couple of\nmonths. Was in November, was very cold, they were in -- actually hidden in a bunker, in\nan orchard garden. And two little children, they were tall -- they were taught not to speak,\nand not to cry or anything. It was quite a horrible scene.",
        "Q: I had a question about the manager, too, who had been helping out your family. Was\nhe non-Jewish?",
        "A: He was non-Jewish. He was a Christian. He worked for us for many years, was a very\nloyal person. But right after the war, the German put a trustee, you know. They took out\nall the inventory and shipped it to Germany, you know. But certain materials, they\nwanted to be processed there, so that manager worked there. He taught them. And\nsubsequently, one of my brothers worked there. That -- he felt 1f he helps them and -- and\nso on, he will survive -- it\u2019Il be easier for him to survive the war, you know. But it didn\u2019t\nhelp.",
        "Q: Did you have contact with him after the war, an-and what was his name, with the\nmanager?",
        "A: [indecipherable]. Yes, but we lost con -- he must have passed away after. We did write\nto him, and a matter of fact, we -- from -- at that time we lived in Italy, and we send him\npackages, you know, of certain delicacies, you know, which was not available in Poland.\nBut then we st -- we couldn\u2019t hear from him. His name was Sh-Sh-Trzyna -- T-r-z-y-n-a.\nI don\u2019t remember the first name. I used to call him Mr. Trzyna -- Mr. Trzyna, yeah.",
        "Q: Pm -- \u2019'm wondering, obviously, it was extremely disappointing how little the -- y-y-\nyou had had -- you mentioned in your first interview that your family had had good\nfriends before the war, who were non-Jewish, and that they didn\u2019t, for the most part, help\nduring --during the war.",
        "Q: Didn\u2019t help at all. None of them helped. The only one is that manager who tried to\nhelp as much as he could. And that family who were hiding our parents. But they did it\nalso for money, because before we vacated -- before we knew it\u2019s going to be very tragic,\nbecause we heard wa -- also, there were very little communications, we had no radio, no\nnewspapers, nothing. Couldn\u2019t travel to one village to the next. But there were rumors\nthat -- and there -- some towns, it was very -- the Germans came in, and took a lot of\npeople out, or most of the Jewish people, because they killed some officer, some soldiers,\nwhich was just an excuse, you know. But we heard all this. My parents arranged to --\nwith these Gentile friends, they said, in case of a problem -- that we have a problem, we\nwant to -- we w -- would like to hi -- you to help us, we would like to hide there. And\nthey gave him a lot -- a lot of silver, and anything that was valuable in the house. S-\nSpecial linen, flatware, you know, stuff like this. Whatever they could take out, even\nsome art. We emptied everything out. So this was like a compensation. In addition, we\nmade sure we paid them for the f-food, and we pay -- also f -- whatever else he asked for,\nyou know. It -- but still, wi -- I feel with all that, he was a decent human being.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you, regarding that -- that experience of -- of real disappointment with\nthe fact that these people who had been your friends before the war, really abandoned you\nand your family, an-and so many others. How do you --",
        "A: Right. I had school friends, from high school, you know, in Krakow, and none of them\nreally cont-contacted me, I mean even when still was pretty quiet, they all stayed away,\nyou know?",
        "Q: How do you -- do you feel trusting now, of -- I mean, after having that experience, do\nyou feel that -- that as a Jew, you can really trust -- as a Jew living in America, and as a\nminority --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- a member of a minority --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- an -- do you feel you can trust the majority to do what\u2019s right?",
        "A: Positively, I wa -- I -- am -- definitely would trust -- it\u2019s a different system, you\nknow, in the United States, it\u2019s a democratic system, and every citizen has it\u2019s rights, and\nthe Constitution protects every cit-citizen. S -- but in Poland, although the Jewish people\nlived there over a thousand years, as a matter of fact, there\u2019s -- in that small town,\nWodzislaw, there\u2019s a synagogue which was over a thousand years old. But during the war\nyears, it was -- made a stable out of it, the Germans, you know, kept horses there, and so\non. And everything was destroyed. As a matter of fact, I was told it\u2019s being rebuilt now,\nthey want to attract tourism, and so on, different parts of Poland, yeah. The -- the Polish\npeople in particular are very, very anti-Semitic, and I -- and how can I -- I can explain it\nis, my own family and I had an experience, although we were very respected citizens.\nWhen the Germans came in, the first day they came in, they knocked at every -- they\nwere shooting in front of your house, and there were a lot of screaming, and s -- and so\non. We were -- we were hiding in a warehouse that we owned. And finally they came to\nour door, they were steel doors, they were banging and shooting, and -- and calling in\nGerman, \u201cGet out, you [indecipherable] get out.\u201d You know, and eventually we had to\nget out. They were beating us, and we had to run to a square. And then, they shot several\npeople, put some houses on fire. So people didn\u2019t come out, they put them on fire. And\nwe are all this -- on that square they [indecipherable] on us, several -- maybe it\u2019s couple\nthousand, or several thousand people. Then they left. So once they left, my parents felt\nth-these were the first ones coming in, they were -- had tanks, you know, that we heard.\nSo what -- my parents said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the church, there\u2019s a church nearby.\u201d And we\nwere there only minutes, I don\u2019t know, less than a half hour. The priest himself, in\ncharge, he said, \u201cYou Belfers, you zhid -- you Jews,\u201d you know, \u201cget out.\u201d And actually\npushed us out, you know. Said, [indecipherable]. So we ran to -- we had an uncle, you\nknow, who lived outside -- a little far out -- outs -- outside town. We stayed there for\novernight, a couple nights, I don\u2019t remember, a few days, you know. I\nt calmed down, so we went back to the house. We got -- we got no help, really, to speak\nof. Not only that, I know of cases who were -- some people that I knew were hiding in the\narea, but if a neighbor would know, or found out, that they being hidden, they would\nreport them, you know? And the people, not only the Jewish people got either shot, or\nsent to a concentration camp, or whatever, but also the Gentile. But there was no -- there\nwere -- the Germans got only cooperation from everyone. The church leaders in\nparticular, and it was a bad, bad time, and I can\u2019t explain it even nowadays, why there\nshould be such hate 1n a -- in some people\u2019s mind towards the Jewish people. The Jewish\npeople have contributed a lot, not only in -- in Poland, everywh -- everywhere they lived,\nin -- in many fields, whether it\u2019s medicine, or whether it\u2019s engineering, or -- or -- or so\nmany other important fields. But obviously it goes back so many years, it goes back to --\nit goes back to a thousand years, claiming that things that we did to Christ, which is a lie,\nand even the ner -- the -- the New Testament is not very accurate. Even the Pope recently\nstated that. And as far as Jesus, he was a Jew, he died as a Jew, and he was not killed by\nthe Jewish people, he was killed by the Romans. He may have -- may have -- he may\nhave wanted to do some reforming, or whatever. But why they -- why -- it\u2019s 2,000 years\nlater, why is this being taught, or when -- or when -- that\u2019s why there\u2019s that hate builds\nup, from childhood. They go to churches, they\u2019re [indecipherable] Jews, or other\nreferences to Jew, although it has been removed now from the liturgy, I -- I hope that futu\n-- future generations will not ever have to experience difficulties and obstructions in -- of\njustice and everything, because they have one religion, or another religion. I don\u2019t -- I\ndon\u2019t believe one religion\u2019s better than the other, they\u2019re all the same, they all teach you\nto be a better person. They don\u2019t teach you to hate. And that\u2019s -- that\u2019s my message, in a\nway.",
        "Q: Norman, how did it feel to be back in Poland, after all those years?",
        "A: I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve f-fell -- I couldn\u2019t sleep nights, I was so upset, you know. With all they\ntried to do for us, it\u2019s amazing, they even send someone to the hotel, one officer of the\ngovernment. He introduced himself, and I had met him at the cocktail party. He showed\nme a -- gave me a card, I may have it even, I don\u2019t know. He says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come\nback to Poland? You built the industry. We need you people, we need more culture, we\nneed -- we need help. You were born here,\u201d he says, \u201cI understand you -- your parents,\ngrandparents, great-grandparents all lived in this country. Why do -- why don\u2019t you come\nback?\u201d I said, \u201cWhy not come back? They -- everyone was killed. None of them\nsurvived, except myself and two brothers. One brother was in America at that time on a\nbusiness trip, and that\u2019s why he never came back. Only I and a brother of mine survive.\nAnd yid,\u201d I said, \u201cwhat help did we get? What did we get when we got back -- came\nback?\u201d And so on. \u201cOh, was a different regime, was dif -- it\u2019s different now. As a matter\nof fact,\u201d he said, \u201cthat time, you know, we are not like in Russia. In Russia,\u201d he says, \u201cthe\ngovernment dictates what the people should do, and in Poland, the gover -- the people\ndictate, not the,\u201d -- which we all almost laughed, they were under Russian regime, and --\nbut we felt, how can they even say that, not being afraid to say it, but they probably felt\nnobody\u2019s going to go tell the Russians what they said. But only --",
        "Q: What -- what year was this?",
        "A: I can\u2019t remember. Must be 12 - 14 years, something like this.",
        "Q: So, it was before the --",
        "A: [indecipherable] the Russian regime was still the ware -- already talking about --\nmaybe a year or two later that -- that broke away completely, yeah. It could be one year\nlater, I\u2019m not sure.",
        "Q: Norman, I wanted to ask you about your -- your family, and your siblings, because in\nthe first interview you -- you mentioned that you had, I believe, four sisters, and two\nbrothers, but I wondered if you would name each one of them, and -- and say what their\nages were relative to you. And also say specifically what the fate was of each one, just so\nthat we have the names connected with -- with a -- with what happened to them.",
        "A: My oldest sister, her name was Bluma, which is actually in Yiddish, or German, it\u2019s\nflowers, yeah. And she had I think three children -- I\u2019m not po -- I believe three, either\ntwo or three children, I\u2019m not positive any more, and a husband. Her husband,\n[indecipherable] was a watchmaker, and he had a lot of friends, Christian friends, too.\nAnd one day, when we heard what\u2019s going on, he said he -- he made arrangement with\nsome good friends of his, next town maybe 10 -- 10 -- 12 kilometers from Wodzislaw, to\nthe town called Jarlnoveeitz. It -- it -- this friend came with a big wagon, and -- and\nhorses, you know, in the middle of the ni -- one night, and they loaded up s-stuff,\npersonal belongings, and so on. And while they were traveling out of -- outside\nWodzislaw, maybe a -- one kilometer outside Wodzidslaw, the German SS, or Gestapo,\nwhatever, intercepted them. And they shot them all.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: Was that in -- around 1940 - \u201941?",
        "A: Jus -- let me just think. This must have been 1942, right. When the wa -- it was in the\nfall of \u201942, in the fall time, fall season, yeah.",
        "Q: How much -- how much older was Bluma?",
        "A: Bluma must have been 17 years older than I. About 17 years. So I -- at that time, in --\nin 40 -- 40 --\u201942, I was 19 or 20 years old, you know, tw -- actually I -- about 20 years.",
        "Q: And your next -- the next oldest, after Bluma?",
        "A: The next oldest is Arthur, my brother. He was 16 years older than I.",
        "Q: And we know what happened to him --",
        "A: And he went United States --",
        "Q: -- he came to the United States.",
        "A: -- on a business trip, yes. My next one was my sister Mindla -- Mindla, they call her\nManya, you know, Mindla, yeah. And s -- she -- let\u2019s see, was two years, or one year\nyounger than Arthur, yeah. I would say, she must have been 15 years older, or 14. 14 or\n15 years. Then I have a brother Maurice, who survived the war wi -- with me. But he --\nhe passed away, unfortunately, let\u2019s say about -- almost 20 years ago, yeah. He was much\nmore affected from the war years than I was. He -- his wife and a child, the child was\nonly three or four years old, maybe three years old, was in hiding near Krakow, also\nsome Christian friends. And one day she went shopping to -- for groceries, you know,\nwith the child. She didn\u2019t look specifically Jewish, you know? She spoke very fluent\nPolish, and all that, like -- like a native, of course. Somebody reported to the police while\nshe was walking out of the store. They waited for her, and shot her right -- right there,\nbecause she started to cry and protest. The child, we don\u2019t know. There -- there was a\nwitness that we met, after the war, told us that he was -- he didn\u2019t -- he -- he didn\u2019t\nactually see it, but he was in the same town, hiding, and he -- he was told that the child\nhad just walked away, or whatever. Somebody may have taken the child, they don\u2019t know\nwhat happened. I\u2019ve done a lot of investigation, we can\u2019t find any trace of it. And the\nreason I -- we did some investigation, in po -- in Warsaw, there's a hotel called Belfer. I\nthought, maybe, you never know, you know. I -- through the Red Cross, then through\nfriends of mine who were in Poland. When I was in Poland, I didn\u2019t -- I wasn\u2019t aware of\nthat. May have been built after, when I was in Poland with that mission, you know, to\n[indecipherable] I was told by the Re-Red Cross in a letter, and also by some friends\nsubsequently, that the reason the hotel is called Belfer, Belfer in poli -- in -- 1 -- they -- in\nschool, they called it Belfer like a nickname. Professor they called a Belfer. It\u2019s a pension\nfund for teachers, and they have investment there, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s all -- called Belfer.\nThere\u2019s no relationship. I was about to s-s -- aba -- was Maurice, and I had a -- a sister\ncalled Sheindla, or Sheindo. Schein means pretty, beautiful, you know, it\u2019s -- and sh --\nshe must have been eight -- seven or eight years older than I am -- than I was. She was a\nvery beautiful girl, very, very intelligent, and very high marks always a s -- in school, she\nalways was the top of the class. Then I had another si-sister, Helena, or Hya. She -- she\nmust have been only two years older than I am. Two or three, I\u2019m not sure. She also was\na lovely, lovely girl, and they all are actually -- what -- what tragically happened to my\nsisters, they -- the three sisters, they were in camp wi-with -- with my parents, an-and me,\nand -- and Maurice, in Plaszow -- in Krakow, the concentration camp, Plaszow. And after\nbeing there a year, more or less, they were -- all the women were taken out. We didn\u2019t\nknow where or what. My mother, and my sisters. And one child of -- of -- of my sister\nMindla, she -- her name was Sarah, the little child, and she was maybe eight years old, or\nso. First they took -- there were several hidden children, she was one of them. First they\ntook the children out, then the women, we didn\u2019t know where, what, you know. They\nalways would tell you, \u201cOh, they\u2019re going to a much better camp, and much easier ts --\nit\u2019s overcrowded here.\u201d They had all kinds -- they had a -- schemes developed to fool y --\nus. We had not -- we tried to believe, we had no choice, you know? But not believing was\nworse. But after the war, when we were liberated, we tried to contact -- we met different\npeople in different areas, in different camps, you know, we went to Salzburg, and -- and\nit\u2019s in my tapes, I went to Italy, but I came -- from Italy, I went back to Munich. I heard\nin Munich there were big gathering of survivors, you know, from all over Germany, you\nknow, Austria. And when I came there, I met some people. And they told me that they all\nwere sent to Auschwitz. But subsequently, maybe a -- months, or a year later, was a\nwoman who was a sis -- a friend of my younger sister Helena, and she said, \u201cI was with\nyour three sisters in Denya -- Diensk -- that -- Polish ports, one 1s German, one is Polish.\nYour sisters were there, and I was there, and only days -- ma -- a week or less before the\nRussians came into that section of Poland, they put -- they told the people they -- they\nhad pr -- factories, they were the -- sewing uniforms, they told them that they going to be\nexchanged for German prisoner of war in Sweden. They gave everybody a piece of bread,\nand tried to calm -- this was a way of calming, you know? Put them -- loaded them on\nboats, very a -- packed them in like in cattle cars, you know, the same way. And they say\ngoing to Sweden, but they torpedoed all the boats. We don\u2019t know, there could be 10,000\nof them. Only about a hundred were left to clean up, and th -- one of the hundred was that\nfriend of my sister, yeah.",
        "Q: How did you find her, or how did she find you?",
        "A: In Milan, also, were, at that time -- this was almost a year after the war, there was a\nplace where [indecipherable] where displaced people would stay. It used to be a -- a\nmilitary pl-place, you know, a caserba, you know? And I would -- we already had an\napartment in Milan, we -- that we rented, yeah, my brother and I. So we used to go there,\ndaily almost, just -- just meet some people, see who -- who -- what -- always new people\ncoming there. Many of them were -- intended to go to Israel. Th-They stopped there for\nsome reason. Also to look for other people. She heard -- she was talking to people that\nthe Belfers are here in town, because she met some other pe -- so, one day we came there.\nShe met us, you know. And she told us the whole story, you know. My mother, however,\ndid -- did perish in Auschwitz.",
        "Q: How did you find out about that?",
        "A: Because that\u2019s -- that was obvious because the -- the trains from Plaszow all went to\nAuschwitz, and they segregated the people. Young people looked fit, they put on one\nside, and my mother that time was a -- in the 50\u2019s -- maybe 50 -- 56 or 57, something\nlike that.",
        "Q: So were you sure -- after the war, and you were in Italy, were you sure that your\nmother had perished in Auschwitz?",
        "A: Y-Yes, because the whole -- most of the women were per-perished -- ya -- only\nyoung, fitting w-women they kept. The others were gassed. They told them they going to\nget -- have to shower, the delousing, they called it, they give them new clothes, and they\ngas them, yeah.",
        "Q: I wanted to talk more about that period in -- in Italy, right after the war, and --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you, at that time -- well, you mentioned a little bit about that time in your first\ninterview, and you mentioned how you had first gone to -- from Salzburg to Modena.",
        "A: Mo -- yes.",
        "Q: And I wondered if, in Modena were you living in a DP camp, or --",
        "A: In a DP camp.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yes. Also was -- I emptied out some military building, and we lived there, yes, for\nabout si -- five, six weeks.",
        "Q: And were you getting help from -- from any organization like the JDC, or -- the Joint\nDistribution --",
        "A: UNRRA -- UNRRA.",
        "Q: UNRRA?",
        "A: UNRRA would send packages and so on.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: However, I believe I mentioned in the prior tapes, you know -- video -- video tapes,\nwhile we were there, one American officer, some -- I could speak some E-English,\nbecause I studied English in high school, I -- he took an interest in me. So I told him, you\nknow, I have a brother in -- in New York, but there is no mail, you can\u2019t -- there was no\nmail there, no official mail -- military mail, where they could help me. He says, \u201cWhat is\nhis name, where does he live?\u201d I say, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d My other brother Maurice was with\nme, he says he -- he -- he used to stay at Hotel Broadway in New York, but he doesn\u2019t\nknow where he is now. This officer wrote to Hotel Broadway in New York, and asked\nwhether or no -- whether a name by the -- Arthur Belfer, his name was Artur, but he\nchanged it to Arthur, you know. So, a letter came back, and it -- but -- I wrote the letter,\nand I told him, we are here, we are -- we survive, we\u2019re -- and we don\u2019t know whether\nanybody else survived. We -- we are afraid to -- I\u2019m afraid to say that no one else\nsurvived except me -- I and -- and Maurice. And Maurice wrote a few lines. He s -- he\nwired us 500 dollars, to a bank. I didn\u2019t even -- I didn\u2019t even tell him anything. So, the\nbank knew displaced people, so they walked around with a sign Belfer, sent somebody\nover. So I went over, and I sp -- couldn\u2019t speak to this guy. I tried to speak to him in\nGerman, I was -- I was fluent in German. He couldn\u2019t speak English, I couldn\u2019t spe -- he\ncouldn\u2019t speak Polish, he couldn\u2019t speak Hebrew, so I couldn\u2019t -- so he said -- in Italy,\nthey say come, they say like this. I didn\u2019t know [indecipherable] what it -- what it means.\nFinally he said -- so we went to the bank. My brother and I, then we had a few friends\nwalk with us, too. We went in -- my brother and I went into the bank. They were\n[indecipherable] waited outside, I said, [indecipherable] I didn\u2019t know why, but I -- I\nassumed there was someone. So the manager spoke German. He says, \u201cHebert kinder,\u201d\nyou know. He was very, very -- w-we have money for you, you know, 500 dollars. Said\nokay. \u201cBut, I ca -- I am not going to give you the money now, come after three o\u2019clock.\u201d\nSo, my brother and I say, \u201cWhy after three o\u2019clock, I want the money now.\u201d He says,\n\u201cLeave it kinder,\u201d you know, you\u2019re children, [inaudible]. \u201cIt\u2019s much better come later.\nPll give you now te -- 10 dollars Italian money, you know?\u201d And when we came after\nthree, he told us, you know, the Black Market 1s -- no -- is a -- a thousand lira per dollar,\nand officially it\u2019s a hundred lira, and he paid us out of the Black Market. He saw the way\nwe looked, you know. So he had some compassion, yeah. So after we had all that money,\nwe went -- all the -- the friends, we had [indecipherable] we went to a restaurant, and we\n-- they displayed in the window there, looked like chicken, but a-after we bought it and\nstart eating it, it was rabbit. We had a -- we bought wine and bread. We had a big party,\nyeah. We stayed there another several weeks. They said -- because we -- the reason we\nwent to Italy -- I wanted to go to Israel, and they told us then, the UNRRA had offices of\npeople, you know. People like you who he -- look healthy, and young, you most likely\nwill be intercepted by the British, you know, and the -- when you go by boat, and they\nsend you to Cyprus, because they -- they send a lot of people to Cyprus. So my brother\nand I stay from one camp to another camp. So then we decided we\u2019ll go to Milan. We\natch -- actually hitchhiked to Milan, because we didn\u2019t know where a railroad -- we\ndidn\u2019t know any -- couldn\u2019t -- nobody understood anything pr -- pr --",
        "Q: Before you go into detail about Milan, I just wanted to ask a couple other questions.",
        "A: Surely.",
        "Q: What were the conditions like in the DP camp in Modena?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t too bad. What we were used to wasn\u2019t too bad, you -- they had -- you could\nshower there, you could -- they had bathrooms. We still were wearing a milit -- the -- the\n-- the British and the American army gave us work clothes, you know. The shirts we were\n-- during the war you didn\u2019t change it for a few years, so can you imagine? There, we\nchanged it every two weeks. So, it was a big --",
        "Q: A big step up for you?",
        "A: Yeah. A tremendous sh -- luxu -- luxury.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: By comparison. They key -- the Italians were -- treated us, I have to say, perfectly\nfine. If you w-went to Israel, 1t wouldn\u2019t have treated us nicer. They were very -- when I\nlived in -- I fell in love with the Italian people, really. I would have never come here to\nthe United States, because my broth -- my older brother encouraged me, he needed me,\nhe -- whatever he -- he was sick, and so on. Other that that, I would have never come. We\nhad establish a business there and so on. So we went to Milan.",
        "Q: One more question before Milan.",
        "A: Fine.",
        "Q: Did -- did you have a -- a passion for going to Israel, or wh-what was involved 1n that\ndecision?",
        "A: I had a passion -- a passion to go to Israel, yes. Yeah, I spoke Hebrew that time, and I\nwas -- I just felt we were -- we were so brutalized, and lost everyb -- thing, and every --\nlost my entire family. We just felt -- my brother and I -- but anyway, we came here. But\nw-went to Milan, we a -- we didn\u2019t know what -- we had money, we didn\u2019t know where\nto go, We -- we were -- way we were dressed, they probably wouldn\u2019t let us in a decent\nhotel. We slept on the railroad station. One of -- one of the Italian people, we ask him,\nyou know where we can stay, in -- in German, you know. Many business people in\nEurope spoke German. This -- like now, everybody speaks English in Europe, but they\nused to speak German especially business people, yeah. He said why don\u2019t -- the -- he\nsaid the railroad station were benches covered -- had -- covered th-those, if it rains, or\nwhatever. The next morning, we ga -- went to a public place where you can wash up, and\nshaved. We went out and bought clothes, and we called -- my brother, remembered we\nhave some business friends in Milan, Italian people. He remembered the name, we looked\nup the name. We called e -- the name was Guardini, and Fachikani. They had a lot of --\nmany stores, poultry stores, you know? All over, not only Milan, outside Milan, many\ncity -- many cities or towns. We -- they used to ship feathers to us, to Poland. So we call\nup, they say, \u201cPronto, pronto.\u201d I don\u2019t know what [indecipherable] even I couldn\u2019t -- I\nsaid -- I started s-speaking in German, they didn\u2019t understand, so I hung up. So my\nbrother and I said, \u201cHow do we talk to her? Let\u2019s go buy a dictionary.\u201d Bought a\ndictionary, we wrote out padrona, you know, going on. \u201cBolea polari con padrona,\u201d said,\nand yeah -- so we called again, and afa -- and I asked for Mr. Guardini, you know, Senor\nGuardini, padrona. He came to the phone, and he spoke fluent German. He says, \u201cWhy\ndon\u2019t you visit us, please come up, come up for lunch.\u201d So, we took a tax1, we went up.\nWe tal -- he knew what was going on, but didn\u2019t know -- we told him about our\nexperience. He says -- they took us out for lunch, and during lunch they said, \u201cWe know\nyou have a brother in New York, because he was in correspondence before.\u201d When the\nwar broke out, the first year or two, Italy was not so aligned later with Germans. So, they\nwere in touch from New York -- from -- from Milan, to New York, you know, these\npeople. They said, \u201cYou know, we have a lot of feathers and down accumulated.\u201d During\nthe war years you didn\u2019t do any exporting. \u201cSo why don\u2019t you take some samples and\nsend it to your brother? And this way you can make some money.\u201d [indecipherable] I\nsaid, \u201cBe happy.\u201d She, \u201cCome tomorrow morning [indecipherable] there.\u201d And ship me --\nthat\u2019s how we started making money. Then we became -- we organize a firm, we hired\nsome people. Now, we did some processing also in Milan. We set up equipment, and we\nbought feathers. We traveled all a -- that\u2019s probably what takes me out of depression, you\nknow, trudigu -- faster. We went to Czechoslovakia, to -- we went to Hungary,\nYugoslavia we went. We went -- bought as much feathers as we could get because there\nwas a shortage in the United States after world -- during the -- World War Two, they used\nup all f-feathers and down, only for military use, for sleeping bags. And there was very\nlittle for public -- for private, yeah, people. So a big market for it.",
        "Q: How did it feel to be traveling in -- in countries that -- in H-Hungary, or in\nCzechoslovakia, or Yugoslavia where -- where there had been so much destruction, and -",
        "A: Was just -- we felt -- we want -- you know, I wanted to prove to the world, and I --\nthat\u2019s -- that\u2019s probably why I\u2019m -- we are -- I\u2019m successful, that we are not stupid\npeople, that we have ambitions, and we have knowledge, and -- and underst -- we have\nintelligence, and whatever -- ever did it in my life, after World War -- I did only things --\nnot just to make the money, to -- to show that I\u2019m a decent human being, you know? I\u2019ve\nnever -- I -- I ca -- I -- I be frank, I have a big resentment with the Germans. Maybe more\nfor the Germans than the Poles, although the Poles were pretty bad, of course. And the\nresentment would have been -- lasted much longer if I ever went back to Poland, you\nknow, which [indecipherable] nobody there, or any other. The Italians, for some reason,\nwere so friendly. You know, even when I couldn\u2019t speak English. I remember the first\ntime we asked -- we wanted to go to cort -- coursa teachanase, how we go there? The\nItalians would say, \u201cGo straight here, make a right turn. Oh no, made a mistake.\u201d They\nshowed us, or they took us there, you know? They very, very friendly. We just -- and I\nhad some friends there, eventually. We loved Italy, because we were used to deplorable\ntreatment, so anybody who was nice, we found aba -- w-we fell in love with them. I had -\n- I really loved Italy, and we go there every so often. I -- I love Italy.",
        "Q: What about being in -- in Hungary, for example?",
        "A: We dealt only with the government there. There was no private industry, or\nYugoslavian. Strictly, you know, how many pounds do we have this, that, they made a\nwhole list. We negotiated privately, [indecipherable] on this -- you know, this. We had --\nif we wouldn\u2019t have done this, I think we would have been lost more. I -- we had a one --\nyeah, brother-in-law who survived the war. One of my sister\u2019s -- my sis -- Mindla. And\nhe survive, and he -- he never was himself. He was such a wonderful, nice guy, brilliant.\nBut he was so damaged, he lost two children and a wife, he could never come back.",

        "Q: His last name?",
        "A: Yeah, Finkenstein. Yeah. He was a -- he was a broken man, and he was such -- he\ncame to visit us in Italy, we encouraged him to s -- he say that he couldn\u2019t -- he just\ncouldn\u2019t function too much. He went back to Poland after the war, and he -- and from\nhim we know for sure, he -- he says, \u201cThere\u2019s nobody, nobody.\u201d Eve -- from the same\ntown, only two people survived. No, nobody. Besides his wife and -- and kids, he lost his\nwhole, entire family, no one else survived. His brothers, and others.",
        "A: You were -- so you\u2019re -- you\u2019re in Italy after the war, and you\u2019re just starting to learn -\n- | think you said in the first interview that you -- you were not aware during the war, of\nAuschwitz.",
        "A: No, I wasn\u2019t aware of any camp.",
        "Q: S-So, when you started to learn about what had happened, and the scale of the killings\nthat -- the murders that had taken place, after the war, do you remember the -- how you\nlearned about that, and the effect that it had on you then?",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Could you please repeat it?",
        "Q: Yes. After the war, when you were in Italy, and you started to hear about the camps,\nand what -- and the -- what had happened there, and how many -- h-how many Jews had\nbeen murdered -- Jews, and others too, ho -- do you remember the effect that that news\nhad on you when you learned about it?",
        "A: When I learned about it, I did not know about any -- I mean, I learned about camps\nsubsequently there were many, because I went back to Munich to look for my -- I thought\nmaybe my sisters survived. And there were people [indecipherable] some of the camps.\nWe didn\u2019t know there was organized there. We thought maybe just this happened here,\njust happened in [indecipherable]. They were so organized, they did town by town,\nvillage by village, and there was no communication at all, because peop -- there was no\nradio -- ra -- for ra -- if you had a radio, a death sentence, like arms, or radios. No\nnewspapers. Didn\u2019t know, didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. They kept many things so\nsecretive. This way, there was no uprising to a degree. If we knew how they -- be more\nuprising, even if we had no arms, nobody helped us.

        "Q: This is tape number two, side A, of an interview with Norman Belfer. Wer -- were you\n-- did you have much personal contact with people who were coming from the camps\nwhile you were in Italy, and -- and was -- did you form friendships, for example?",
        "A: Yes, I did make personal contacts with a number of people. Most people left --\nmigrated to the United State, to Canada, to Australia, to -- even some settled 1n Italy,\nwhich I still have one particular friend who lives in Italy, in Milan, and there may be\nmore living there, but I\u2019m not f -- f -- I don\u2019t know them. They all had to s -- make a\nliving, so they all looked for jobs, they looked for some profession, and some even went\nback to school. I knew a doctor, and -- in Great Neck, New York where we live, part\ntime, who went to -- became a medical -- who became a physician, went to medical\nschool in Italy.

Shallite, and I like Kromo,\nnear the Swiss border, you know? That beautiful hotel there, and Straza, and Terrona. I\nknow a lot of it. And southern Italy, there. I knew Ispia, and Capri, and Naples. I-I -- I\nmade a point, the first few years, you know, the fir -- after a couple years I said to my\nbrother, \u201cY -- we have enough money now to -- we don\u2019t have to work so hard. Now,\nlet\u2019s do some traveling, and so on.\u201d And we didn\u2019t have a lot of money, but to us it was a\n-- a lot. We had 10,000 dollars, we -- we were millionaires in Italian liras, you know?\n10,000 dollar was like 10 million liras, you know? So -- so [indecipherable]. So we\ntraveled a lot. We had a -- made a lot of nice friends, some Italians, and non-Italian.",
        "Q: Did you practice Judaism at all?",
        "A: Did I what?",
        "Q: Did you -- did you practice Judaism at all? Did you go to synagogue?",
        "A: Not really. Not really at all. Not at all. Also, I be -- I was interested, and during high\nholidays I would go to a temple there. It was like a Reform temple. But I -- I was angry\nabout this whole thing, you know, other religions. It -- however, it\u2019s -- you get older and\nolder, you start thinking maybe -- I don\u2019t understand, I can\u2019t explain it, but where 1s God?\nWhy have you punished? And so on.",
        "Q: Y -- we didn\u2019t hear anything about your religion, or your religious education before\nthe war. I know that your father was Orthodox, but were -- did you have any natural\ninclination or interest in -- in religious issues, or -- or natural faith as a -- as a young man\u2019?",
        "A: Yes, I was -- as a young man, I was very -- I would say very observant. But I was not\na f -- never was a fanatic, you know. Neither was my father, he was a very Orthodox, but\nhe was -- he di -- but he was active in the business world, and so on. But I went to Yesh-\nYeshiva, you know, before -- til ma -- maybe I was 13 years old, you know? And then I\nwent to Hebrew high school. That\u2019s where I learned spa -- I knew -- I knew Hebrew, but I\ndidn\u2019t know it was a spoken language [indecipherable]. My family all were very learned\nyou know, and very broad minded. And I must have had a very strong background, or\nwhatever. They gave me a lot of -- they brought me up right, obviously. I love people, I\ntrust people, I -- I can read people. Maybe that developed a little [indecipherable] too. I\ncan read who 1s sensi, who isn\u2019t, you know? I lo -- now I say I lost a little bit of it, but I --\nI don\u2019t, know, I can read people. It\u2019s amazing how well.",
        "Q: You think that you could do that during the war, as well, or --",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. Do you think that helped you to survive?",
        "A: Must have, yes. I always kept a straight face, I don\u2019t know [indecipherable] such\nhorrible things, I would not -- some people got very upset, and they would be part of that\nthey were -- they didn\u2019t survive after that, you know? They would cry and scream, or\nwhatever. You had to be made of iron.",
        "Q: Can you say something more about -- about the -- about your religion now, a -- your\nfaith now? It sounded like y -- 1t\u2019s developed.",
        "A: I am -- Iam, I would say, Conservative. In other words, I go to temple only on high\nholidays, and also when I have -- you know, Yahrtzeit, what -- what it means?",
        "Q: Remembrance?",
        "A: Where you go -- yeah -- you -- we -- we approximate our dates when I lost my\nparents, then I go to temple, or my sisters [inaudible]. The one th -- there\u2019s a date, and\nthey -- it\u2019s a memorial day for that person, whatever, I would go. Otherwise, I don\u2019t go.\nWhat I found interesting, I don\u2019t know, very few people know that, when I lived in Italy,\nI had a girlfriend. Her fa -- I met her father, the father was Jewish, the mother was\nGentile. And she was a lovely girl. She told me she\u2019s Christian because her mother\u2019s\nChristian, and her brothers are Jewish, because the father 1s Jewish. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s the only\nplace I\u2019ve heard of is in Italy, yeah. They will go to church, all of them, let\u2019s say\nChristmas, and high holi -- Jewish high holidays all go to temple, to synagogue. That\u2019s --\nand -- and it was very, very normal there, it wasn\u2019t -- there were a number of families like\nthis. I\u2019ve never heard of it in any other place.",
        "Q: Does that -- how do you feel about that now?",
        "A: I think -- I think it\u2019s better than hating each other. It\u2019s a very good compromise, its\u2019 a\nvery good compromise. Because very often I hear you intermarry, and when something\ngoes wrong, they right away pick on religion, yeah. They don\u2019t blame, because he -- you\ndon\u2019t -- well I don\u2019t focus on -- on it, you don\u2019t understand it, but I -- people get angry.\n[indecipherable] call you -- you\u2019re a Jew, or you\u2019re this, or you\u2019re that, you know? Had\nnothing to do with the religion. What I was in -- what amazed me a bi -- the reason I\nloved Italy so much, there was no -- I couldn\u2019t feel any anti-Semitism, none whatsoever. I\ntold people, they ask me, yeah, I say -- I\u2019m a -- a brayer who is Jewish, you know. Some\neven -- I had some Christian friends that we made over the years. I met them during -- in\nthe hotel, you know, when you\u2019re on vacation, became friendly. So they ask me one time,\n\u201cWhere you going for Christmas night, where you going? Which church do you go to?\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cI told you I\u2019m -- I\u2019m a -- a brayer, I\u2019m Jewish.\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019re Jewish? But you\npoli -- you come from Poland.\u201d They don\u2019t understand. Poland all Christians. I say, \u201cYes,\nbut there were some Jews there.\u201d And they don\u2019t -- didn\u2019t matter at all. [indecipherable]\nyears after. As a matter of fact I have one guy who\u2019ve send me a present last ti -- last\nyear. We exchange presents occasionally. Sent some shirts with the name Belfer. There\u2019s\na company, you know, in Italy, they make very fancy sports clothes, and he sent my wife\nand me shirts with Belfer and Belfer, printed in, some logo. So he found it 1n a store in\nMilan, so he felt he has to send it to me. We\u2019re going to see him this summer, too. It\u2019s --\nth-th-the Catholic church actually is the major -- all of the maj -- the major, the pope, and\nall the cardinals, and all this, all operate from Rome. And I couldn\u2019t understand why\nthere\u2019s so little anti-Semitism in -- in Italy, and so much in -- in other parts of the, in\nEurope. I couldn\u2019t understand that. They weren\u2019t preaching it, maybe, at their home base.",
        "Q: Di -- have you had any -- how do you feel about Catholicism in general, I mean,\nhaving lived in a Catholic country, do you think that -- that most Catholics are anti-\nSemitic, and it was just the Italians who weren\u2019t, or --",
        "A: It\u2019s -- it goes by country, so it\u2019s almost -- like Czechoslovakia let say, I know it from\npeople that I knew, and I traveled after the war to Czechoslovakia. There was no -- not\nquarter as much anti-Se-Semitism as in Poland. Maybe because in Poland, there were --\nthe Jews were there longer, for over a thousand years, and there were more Jews there. I\ndon\u2019t -- we don\u2019t know. And also, they were less educated. The Poles were not very well\n-- there were many illiterates, 1t -- maybe than other countries. But see, let\u2019s -- but at the\nsame time, look at the Germans, very -- they\u2019re very -- the most educated people in\nEurope, they were, and what they did, you know. They did it, I think, because the whole\nworld, nobody actually protested, nobody came to help. All -- by -- by being silent is like\nacquiescing. And some even helped. Like a small country like Denmark, they told them\nthe -- you know, to wear -- the Germans told them to wear these Star of David, you\nknow, on their clothes, or whatever. They said no til the king himself put 1t on. And more\ns -- more over Bulgaria was a country where they told the Germans, \u201cIf you co -- if you\ntake one of our citizens out, there\u2019s a war.\u201d They never went in. Other countries let them\nin. And the worst, I feel, was Hungary, you know. They were occupy -- the Russians\noccupied most of Poland, all Poland. They were close to their borders, they were -- still\nwas -- only a few weeks before the war, the entire war was over, they were still sending\npeople in April. The war was over, let\u2019s say, in some parts was over already, they were\nsending Jewish people to Auschwitz. I mean, that\u2019s unheard of. They just\n[indecipherable] us. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s painful to think about it. Why would you do that to another\nhuman being?",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you, you had, as a young man, your education had been interrupted.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you --",
        "A: I never finished high school.",
        "Q: Did you ever have the desire to -- to go back to school, to continue your edu -- your\neducation, or did you ever do that?",
        "A: I did go -- I di -- I had private tutoring in Milan, you know, especially wanted to learn\nItalian. I also started -- took some business courses, and when I came to the U.S., I went\nto -- I became interested in real estate, you know. I -- I attended NYU, New York\nUniversity, you know, has classes for j -- for drawings, and construction methods, and so\non. And -- and also American history. I took courses night -- at night. That\u2019s -- and I self\neducated myself. I -- I read as -- I -- when I have free time, I read, about everything that\u2019s\ngoing on, you know. The New York Times specifically, I read from all cover to cover, in\na way. And my wife 1s very -- she\u2019s very intellectual. As a matter of fact, she is a\nfounding chairman of Fellowship of Christian Jews, in Palm Beach. She been the f --\nshe\u2019s a -- she can -- this organization\u2019s only about maybe six, seven years old, you know.\nShe\u2019s on the board, and [indecipherable]. And Palm Beach itself was very anti-Semitic y-\nyears ago, but it much, much, much less now. We have -- once a year, we have a big ball,\nyou know, and [indecipherable] the Breaker\u2019s Hotel, where many Christian Jews come,\nsit at the same tables. In -- in general, the -- the atmosphere is much, much better than it\nused to be there, because we have a dialog, they see we are not different than they are,\nreally. We have -- here, we have a number of very Christian friends, very lovely people. I\nhope they think of us as much as [indecipherable] very lovely. I -- I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s\nwhy I can never understand the hate it build up. That -- that put a -- it bothers me,\nbecause if you\u2019re not going to be aware of it, like in history, if you\u2019re not aware of it, it\u2019s\ndoomed to repeat itself. In other words, if you don\u2019t learn from the history. So you have\nto try to correct whatever is possible.",
        "Q: Maybe we should talk about how you came to the United States. Do you want to say\nsomething about that?",
        "A: Surely. My brother Arthur would come to Milan, Italy because we lived there, and he\nwanted to buy more and more feathers, so he came every -- every year for awhile, see\nwhat we doing. And we had -- we were well established, and he was on the -- on a\nweekend, he went to the Lido Hotel in Long Beach -- Long Island, you know, he would --\nhe would go there always in the summertime, he and his family. He was swimming, and\nthe undercurrent, he almost drowned. He, and a couple of other people, I -- I believe one\nof them drowned, or -- or two, I\u2019m not sure, really. And he -- they operated on him be-\nbecause he had the lung -- they had to cut part of one of lung off -- he was -- so he asked\nme to come, he wasn\u2019t doing well. Took awhile to get all better. I couldn\u2019t refuse, so\nthat\u2019s how I came. I didn\u2019t like it, really. I went back a few times, just for a short time, to\nvisit my other brother. And finally I met Eleanor, see. And when I met her, so -- of\ncourse, we got engaged, and awhile later, and then we got married, so they went to Italy,\nand I stayed there. We stayed there for five weeks, my brother was calling me after two\nweeks, when are you coming back?",
        "Q: So he really needed you?",
        "A: Yes. When are you coming back? So we star -- I he -- you know, that time, Eleanor\n[indecipherable] her parents heard that you going to Italy, going to Italy, and I\u2019d say that\nthey were not very sophisticated about Europe, you know. Oh. They said, \u201cWhy would\nyou go to Italy, so many places in the United States.\u201d I said, \u201cI like it.\u201d But Eleanor loved\nit, too. I was considering staying back in Italy, coming back. But I had s -- a feeling for\nmy brother, and we got married, and I -- we settled here, you know.",
        "Q: Can you say something more about why you didn\u2019t like the United States, or why it\ndidn\u2019t appeal to you as much as Italy?",
        "A: First off, when I arrived at the piers in New York, the screaming, and the yelling, and\nthe taxi drivers. You have to wait to get a taxi, everybody was trying to get taxis. And the\nnoise, and the overhead west side highway, you know? And there were so many people in\nthe streets, and all types of people, and I just took me -- took me time to get used to it,\nsimple as that. Not I didn\u2019t like it, but I -- I didn\u2019t like the food, either. However, my\nbrother and his family took me out to a steak house, they gave us steak for three people,\nyou know? I remember [indecipherable] I couldn\u2019t -- I wasn\u2019t used to this type of food, I\nliked Italian food. And little things, nothing. Once I learned more about th-this -- the\nAmerican system in amer -- and the way things are done here, I started to love it. It took\nme -- it took me a short time, it took a couple of years. Then I became more used to it,\nyou know. I love it now. I\u2019m very proud to be an American citizen [indecipherable]. I do\nanything that is proper there to any citizen, I don\u2019t care whether they\u2019re -- or what color\nor what religion I-I\u2019m not this way. As a matter of fact, when I came am -- to the United\nStates, I never saw Black children. Where -- I could see Black people aft-after the war,\nbecause in Poland, never -- I never saw a Black person, never. In Italy, you see th -- I saw\nsome, and Germany, cause soldiers, you know still were after the war. But I never saw a\nchild, or a woman. A woman I saw, only in a film, where that -- the, \u201cGone With the\nWind,\u201d had that -- I remember distinctly. I used to go to English movies in Milan, I\nwanted to improve my -- my English. So I ha -- I -- I had no prejudices. I mean, that\u2019s\nhow I was raised, obviously, it comes from childhood.",
        "Q: When did you become a citizen?",
        "A: I became a citizen in -- let\u2019s see -- in \u201952, I believe, 1952. I believe you have to be -- if\nyou\u2019re married to a -- an American citizen, I believe after two years -- is it two or three\nyears, I\u2019m not sure, you become -- I got a passport, yeah. And if you are not a -- if you\u2019re\nnot married to an American, it\u2019s -- takes five years to get a citizenship papers.",
        "Q: And by that point, did you feel very loyal to this cou --",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- or really interested in this --",
        "A: There\u2019s certain things I didn\u2019t like. People were -- some people were -- I find\nEuropean people -- and I\u2019m talking about Italy, I cannot -- I cannot speak about Poland.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: Their behavior -- the behavior was more refined in Europe than in the United States. It\nmay have change now, you know. Matter of fact, American used to dress differently, you\nknow. In Dearborn, I -- I remember, I had the custom made suit for coming to America. I\nthought I want to look proper, you know? And they -- the first thing my brother says,\n\u201cYou look like a greener.\u201d You know what a greener?",
        "Q: Like a greenhorn?",
        "A: Greenhorn.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And this American says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come and buy some suits?\u201d He wanted to go\n-- this was around the year end. So he wanted to go a hotel in the Catskills, he says,\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t dress like this.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go.\u201d I tried on -- everything was so big\n-- I\u2019m sorry -- big, and -- I d -- as -- I couldn\u2019t find an-anything, but that -- so I bought\nsome -- one suit, but I don\u2019t want to buy any more. But also ties, at that time they were\nbig ties, and very loud. I was not used to it, so -- anyway. But I feel in the United States,\nyou don\u2019t have this -- you still have some resentment, and -- but 1t\u2019s more civilized. It\u2019s a\nver -- if there 1s a resentment -- in Europe they were all open, you know, and -- and I\ncontinued, it\u2019s -- it was a continuous problem, you know, whether you\u2019re Jewish, or non-\nJewish, German, or Italian, or this. Even then -- between nations, they were hating each\nother. That\u2019s why they had wars every -- every 25 years, or twen -- every -- a new war.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you just a little bit more about Israel, or wa -- Palestine, wa -- your\nplans to go, and did -- was it difficult to disc -- to change your mind about that, or did --\nhow did -- how did your -- how did that desire to go --",
        "A: I definitely intended to go, I definitely wanted to go there, and so did my brother. We\nfelt that we have been abused, and -- and murdered, you know, and we just wanted to be\nin a Jewish state, you know\u201d? It was not a state yet, but we hoped. We will fight, we were\nready to fight, and do anything, to have a -- a sovereign Jewish state, because we felt\nthen, and now, if we had a Jewish state, this would have never happened. Maybe people\nwould have been killed, but not by the -- by the millions. Nobody he -- you know, even\nthe United States, th-they could have helped, they didn\u2019t help. None of the European\ncountries helped, and -- nobody helped us. And nobody gave us weapons. If anybody had\nweapons, had to turn them in, in the beginning, you know\u201d? The first two years, you hear\nthey would shoot somebody, or put you in jail for nothing, [indecipherable], but then\ngradually became harder and harder. They fooled you in such a way. Very little was\nknown, what was going on. And even the best of your neighbors, some of them, they\nwant -- if they, let\u2019s say, wanted to help, were afraid to help, see? But they\u2019re very few.\nAs a matter of fact, I was in -- at Yad Vashem, it\u2019s going to be two years in j -- this Ju-\nJune, yeah, where [indecipherable] the 50\" anniversary of the state of Israel. I believe\nthat\u2019s when it -- yes, \u201948, yeah. Yad Vashem invited 60 families from Europe who helped\n-- Righteous Gentile, you know?",
        "Q: You mentioned -- we were talking a little bit about -- about Israel --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you want to say about that? Maybe w-was it -- have you always\nfollowed closely the -- the political situation there? For example, when the sic -- six day\nwar came along in -- in 1967, was that an -- was than an important event for you?",
        "A: It was extremely important, because we -- we felt -- I felt that they liberated the land\nthat th-the -- that the Arabs felt is their land, but if you go back in history, a lot of it\nbelonged to Israel. And even now, the dispute about the Gaza Strip, and other areas, you\nknow, that belong to Israel, but Israel is not a state. It\u2019s Palestine, and -- there\u2019s a conflict,\nof course, and I hope they -- they will have a peace tre-treaty, and try to live together, and\nthey\u2019ll be much better off by -- they don\u2019t have to love each other, but at least they should\nco-exist. By co-existing, the Arabs would definitely benefit, and I think even Israel would\nbenefit, having peace, not have to arm itself, and lose people, you know, and -- which is\ncompletely a waste of human life. They can -- but what 1s -- what 1s bad in -- in -- in -- in\nthese Arab countries, like Saudi Arabia has all the money, and other, and Iran, and all\nthis, they all -- they hate each other to -- they don\u2019t hate only Israel, they hate each other.\nIraq, you know? They depressed -- they oppressed the people, and they live like -- all the\nleaders in these countries li-live like kings. You see them when you go to Europe, in\nsome hotels, I\u2019ve met some -- I was in Switzerland maybe 10 years ago. They take entire\nfloors, they come with a whole crew, you know, they all -- a cook, and help, and what\nthey love most, I\u2019ve seen, they go to gambling casinos. They gamble maybe thousands, or\nmillions, who knows? They just -- the disgrace of their own people; instead of building\nthem up, they build themselves up, the leaders themselves. It\u2019s unfortunate. Also the\nmarket, let\u2019s say, the Arab -- because of the standard of living there, their wages are so\nlow by comparison to Israel, or by com -- comparison to European\u2019s standards. And even\ns -- Far East -- the Far East was -- China, or any of these countries, exporting a lot of\ngoods to the United States, because their labor is extremely -- 10 cents an hour. In the\nArab countries some ma -- don\u2019t make more, they\u2019re making less. They could build up\ntheir economies, like Japan did after World War two, and others, with the help of the\nIsraelis, but they -- their leaders are fighting, not even knowing what their -- they want,\nand every [indecipherable] they make, they don\u2019t live up to, you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a\nconstant problem. I hope the new generation will understand that better, be more\neducated, more broadminded, and there\u2019Il be peace in that area, and by having peace in\nthat area, will be peace also in many other areas, because we are interrelated in a way,\none country with a -- with another. I hope th -- Iraq, in particular, and Iran, that they have\nsome new governments, you know, which are more for the people, not for themselves.",
        "Q: When did you first travel to Israel?",
        "A: I went to Israel, I -- I believe the first time in -- in the late 50\u2019s, early six -- yeah, 1960\nI know I was there, you know, 1960 [indecipherable]. That was a time which was very\nunusual. That -- Adolf Eichmann, at that time, when we were in Israel, was brought from\nArgentina, or whatever, and was a big, big celebration, 1n a way. Sort of tragic, but -- that\nthey caught him and brought him to justice. And I was -- the streets were full of people,\nand s -- and was so much excitement about it. Was very -- I wa -- we were very happy to\nbe there, to be -- to have been there, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you follow the trials closely, the Eichmann trials?",
        "A: To a degree, yes, yes I have, definitely. As a matter of fact, we were in Israel the two\nyears ago, I started to tell you about the -- I don\u2019t know whether I finished it. Yad\nVashem invited 60 families from Europe. These 60 families, whose -- who were -- helped\nJews, they didn\u2019t have to be the -- they could have been children, or grandchildren of\nthem, the whole families were invited for the -- they were put up in the Hilton Hotel, a\nvery fine hotel. Made big dinners, and we were -- the big ceremony at Yad Vashem, and\nthe many -- there were dignitaries from different countries, and -- and there was a\ndiscussion, one of the speakers said, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not sure whether it was Netanyahu, or\nsomebody else, during the war, World War two, there were 400 million people in -- in\nEurope, and how many do you think -- Gentiles -- helped Jewish people? Under 14,000.\nA fraction of -- less than one -- a fraction of one percent, you know. In other words, that\u2019s\n-- that tells a lot. The people who -- who were invited, were given special medals, like\n[indecipherable]. They were treated royally, they were invited to the -- to the president\u2019s\nhouse, and that really -- they -- they were so -- so amazed, and some of them say they\nwant to come and s -- and retire there. They were so -- so amazed, yeah. Yes, what I\nwanted to say, we met yes -- we met an elderly lady wi-with her son, from Holland. No --\nnot -- not from Holland, from Austria. She was put in a camp in Auschwitz. She was a\nGerman physician -- Austrian physician who helped Jewish people -- or Jewish friends,\nyou know? She helped them, something, she was put in -- into Auschwitz. And she said\nthat she worked under Mengele, you know? And he experimented with human lives, and\nso on. He gave and she was supposed to give him certain pills to take, you know, make\nsure that they swallow, and so on. A lot of them she did not distribute, she di -- she\ndisposed of it, you know, she -- and so on. Certainly she -- and she even said what -- what\nthe drugs were, certain drugs. She was a very elderly, and she wasn\u2019t in good health, she\nwas wearing a -- sh -- with crutches, you know. But her son was very intelligent. Nice\nman. And he explained the whole -- what meng -- what Mengele, what he did to the\nprisoners, you know. He kept them out nude in that na -- in the -- in the freezing weather,\nto try -- how much you can stand. There all kind of experiments. Whatever she could help\navoiding, she would -- she was risking her own life, but she said she couldn\u2019t say one hu -\n- why one human being could do this to another. And many of these Christians who were\ninvited, they were very loving people. They say what they did to -- to you. They call us\nbrother, and you know, they said -- they even said, you know -- I remember he said, we\nare brethren, beca -- we -- we believe in Jesus, and Jesus was a Jew. They even brought\nup, why would I hate the Jews, you know? He actually -- the Jews with the 10\ncommandments, all kinds. We tried -- they tried to explain their reasoning, tried to find\nwhy would this happen. It\u2019s -- this was quite interesting, and moving, of course.",
        "Q: Maybe this would be a good time for you to talk more about your role with Yad\nVashem, and -- and with the US Holocaust Museum, and how you --",

        "A: [ha -- I have some friends in New York, and this happened, I mean, 30 years ago.\nThey said, you know, the Yad Vashem -- they built -- the government actually supporting\nit. But Israel at that time was not 1n finan -- well, not in very good financial status, and\nthey wanted foreigners who have some means, to help, and w -- they formed an\norganization New York, and I was invited to come and -- and I took an active role in --\nyou know, at meetings and so on, and I became a vice-chairman. Also went to Israel, and\nto the museum on many occasions, to have meetings there s -- and that\u2019s how I got\ninvolved. And once a year we have a meeting in -- in New York, where there are over a\nthou -- 1200 people show up, you know. More, on account of it\u2019s -- the -- this 1s the\nlargest room in New York, the Hilton Hotel, it\u2019s -- that can accommodate up to 1200\npeople, otherwise there would be more. It\u2019s not only survivors, many Americans will\ncome there, and I\u2019m -- I\u2019m active in that organization, I\u2019m active in many other -- several\nothers, there. But that, primarily.",
        "Q: I was wondering whether I -- I saw in your first interview that your mother had told\nyou s -- before she died, that she -- she had told you to talk about -- to survive, and to talk\nabout what had happened.",

        "Q: And I\u2019m wondering how much that -- those words stayed in your mind, and influenced\nyour -- your work, after the war.",
        "A: This -- the words stuck in my mind very -- and still now, you know. Especially during\nthe war years, there was a time at the end of the war year days, the last week of the war\nyears, w-we went through hell, and I -- I could not -- I wanted to give up, I couldn\u2019t give\nup. I -- I mean, I couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t walk any more. I just -- but I was thinking of my\nmother, I have to survive and tell the world what happened. She -- that\u2019s what she told\nme. She told me, you\u2019re the youngest -- and she told it to Maurice, too. Wa -- say -- to\nme, she says, \u201cRemember, you are the youngest, you are the -- you look strong and\nhealthy. You never -- y-you always have been healthy. You eat right, [indecipherable]\u201d --\nyou know, after it happened to my father, you know, the -- they shot my father, that\u2019s --\nthat\u2019s the time she told me. \u201cYou have to tell the world what happened, because this --\nthis is a tragedy that is going to go down in history for -- for hundreds of years, wh-what\nwe see, what they doing to us here. And do your utmost to survive. I am,\u201d she said, \u201cI am\nold.\u201d She was, that time 55 - 57, something that -- I\u2019m not sure, maybe 57, or fi -- or 55.\nAnd that -- that always has been in my head, you know? So when I have an opportunity,\nwe have some Christian friends here in Palm Beach, even they talk about -- talk to me,\nthey -- they indirectly find out I -- I\u2019m a survivor, or -- or Eleanor would say, you know,\n\u201cT -- I\u2019m European, and I am survivor of the war.\u201d So, they want -- some want to know. I\nshowed some of the films, the videotapes, they can\u2019t believe it, you know. They say it\u2019s\nmindboggling, you know, it\u2019s -- but that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s how it was.",
        "Q: When did you start to speak about your experiences during the war? Di -- when you\nmet Eleanor, did you talk to her about it?",
        "A: I told her a little. I told her that I was in a concentration camp, but I didn\u2019t tell her that\nmuch. Gradually, I would tell her more and more, you know.",
        "Q: Was sh -- did she encourage you to talk about it, or discourage you?",

She\u2019s very se --\nvery sensitive, you know, about th-this, you know. She can\u2019t understand why these things\nshould have happened. And a lot of it could have been avoided, but nobody cared. It\u2019s as\nsimple as that. Nobody cared. Y-- with the boats, you know, came to the American\nshores, and sent them back. Most of them perished. And now, anybody wants to come to\nAmerica, comes in. Including criminals can come in. Nobody stops them, to -- the way\nthey stopped civilized people, educated people, and so on.",

        "A: I would tell -- yes, I was honored by Yad Vashem, I would tell my story. As a matter\nof fact, only a couple weeks ago, I was honored here by American Jewish Committee,\nand they wanted me to talk about it, and I did, yeah. And they said they never had such --\nso many people came, and so many money. They raised ever -- they never raised as much\nmoney. Was a fundraiser.

        "A: In Palm Beach, yes. They have a -- usually a dinner, or a -- every year, you know, or\ncocktail reception. And it\u2019s like ADL, you know, Anti-Defamation League is the same\nthing, yeah.",
        "Q: And y-you felt -- was there a time when you -- when you felt like you couldn\u2019t talk\nabout it, and that you were able to later, or how -- how did that happen?",
        "A: I -- [never encouraged it, you know, I never, unless somebody asked me, yes, I would\nhave. But I would never start that. There are many friends who know me for 40 years,\nthey -- they ju -- and they just found out last year, or two years ago, whatever. But it\nbecame more among survivors, after \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d I notice they talk more openly,\neverybody talks more openly. There was -- not they didn\u2019t talk because they were -- they\ndidn\u2019t ha-ha -- crimes they didn\u2019t want to, it was too painful to them to talk about it,\nbecause it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s very hard, you know, God forbid if people lose a whole, entire\nfamily. Parents, sisters, nieces, nephews, friends. It\u2019s just -- it\u2019s -- what I\u2019m saying it, I --\nI don\u2019t understand. I -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s painful, I don\u2019t understand it. But that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- that -\n- that is life, it happened. We have to make sure it does not happen again, and that\u2019s why\nI\u2019m active in that, every organization who fights, bigo -- bigotry, and anti -- not only anti-\nSemitism, anti-Black, anti-thi --whatever. I am strongly against. I support every\norganization that I -- this 1s no -- no rhyme or reason for it, except, I would say -- I would\nsay ignorance. Plain ignorance, and stupidity. We can live in a much better world, why\nfight? Yes, we may have disagreements, or dis -- different approaches to different si --\ncertain problems, but you -- we discuss it. You --you compromise, or you convince the\nother person. Why -- that\u2019s one thing, I never -- since World War -- since I was liberated,\nafter the World War two, I never had a fight with anybody. Never sued anybody, never a\n-- nobody sued me. Except when I had -- about 10 years ago, I had some guy here in\nPalm Beach -- not Palm -- west Palm, whatever, a builder, who -- who took advantage of\nme, anyway. Financially [indecipherable] nothing, you know. He forged statements and\nstuff like this, so -- I\u2019m bigger and better, and I blame myself, I\u2019m very trusting, you\nknow. And this person was recommended to me by my attorney, is why I felt he can trust\n-- but -- but I -- I say, material things are -- I\u2019d never -- ha-have never been a problem to\nme, I could somehow managed. Whatever I did -- I -- I -- I did almost to perfection, you\nknow? And people like to deal with -- with me. My reputation 1s ses -- is great, and -- and\nI -- I hope the future generations will be free of all these prejudices, and mistreatments,\nand so on.",
        "Q: Let me ask you so -- clearly, you\u2019re -- you\u2019ve had a great deal of success with -- with\nyour undertakings in -- in life, and -- and I think that\u2019s not a -- many Holocaust survivors\nhave been very successful after the war.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",

        "A: But ma -- yeah, the majority did not achieve anything. You know, a lot of them -- a lot\nof them I know are poor, and depend on help wi -- from others. You only -- the -- the\nvisible ones, are the ones who have been successful. Because they travel, they go around,\nand they see them at charity dinners, and so on. I think the rea -- I can explain my -- and I\nbelieve I mentioned it before. And I f -- I find every survivor who\u2019s successful, is he\nwants to prove that he\u2019s not treated like an animal, you know. That they\u2019ve been so\nmistreated, they want to prove to the world at large, that they are decent human beings,\nthey\u2019re productive in soc -- in society. They\u2019re knowledgeable about their work,\nwhatever -- whether it\u2019s professional or otherwise. And even as employees, you know,\nmany of them, they try harder, they have to work harder, they had to work, first of all, by\nstarting with -- with nothing, you had to work hard to get up the ladder a little, you know,\nand it\u2019s very hard to make a living. I was successful because -- and my brother, because\nwe had some contacts -- business contacts before one -- most of them didn\u2019t have any.\nHad to -- had to work very hard. I know people with two jobs, you know, for years. But\neventually, they started to make money, and -- and try to live better, and -- and di -- build\nsome trust among business people, or professional people. I know some survivors who\nare wonderful architects, bright as -- or engineers I work with. But we never discuss any\nof it, that stuff, unless I meet them at some of our dinners where they discuss, you know,\nHolocaust matters, and so on.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number three, side A. You mentioned in your videotape interview, you --\nyou said at one point that -- that you -- that during the war, you became numb to the\nviolence after awhile. And I -- I wonder if you could say how you became sensitive. I\nmean, you\u2019re obviously a very sensitive person. Was -- was it a long process to kind of\nget -- move from being numb, to being more sensitive again?",
        "A: The way I felt, obviously, it was -- every bad incident, you know, were -- it like\nmultiplied, worked on you, and you -- you -- you had to feel a | -- that it -- almost, you\ndon\u2019t see it, you know? You had to make believe you don\u2019t see it, because otherwi -- it\nwas -- it -- it was so painful, you had to give up, you know? There were times y-you felt,\nyou know, you\u2019ll jump on one of these SS men, you -- even if he kills you later, you want\nto kick him in his -- some places, you know, and do whatever. But that\u2019s what I mean,\nyou get -- you get so -- you get numb, because you can\u2019t do anything. You can -- y-you,\nit\u2019s not only they\u2019Il kill you, the rule was there, let\u2019s say one prisoner disappeared.\nBecause, we had to line up every morning with the same people, and the same -- you\nknow, to march, you know, there were four or five of us, in width. If one disappeared, 10\npeople were shot. So, we had to police each others, nobody should disappear. Some\npeople even wanted to give up, they would lay down, they rather, instead of running\naway, they just sat down on the floor, and later they killed them, and put them on a truck,\nor whatever. So you become -- that\u2019s what I meant.",
        "Q: Yeah, okay. I under -- I understand that, I -- I think, and I just wondered if -- 1f it was\ndifficult after the war, to -- to come back from that -- that experience of having -- having\nto numb yourself so that -- so that you wouldn\u2019t g -- ex -- so that you\u2019d be able to just\ncontrol yourself.",

        "A: I must have been very, very strong, you know, mentally strong. And if I could have\nseen such atrocities that -- I don\u2019t think -- I don\u2019t want to think about it. If 1t comes to my\nmind, I try to shut off my mind at -- about it. It such -- just -- in-incomprehensible, you\nknow? I don\u2019t know how I did it, I just did it. You know, it\u2019s just -- maybe it\u2019s -- I had\nthat mission from my mother. I had the -- also the anger, to get even with these criminals,\nyou know? And -- and ulti -- mayb -- I wanted to prove to myself, after the war, that I am\n-- [am a decent human being, and I\u2019m better than -- than most of them. And I\u2019m going to\nshow it to the world that I -- I\u2019m a good person. Why would the people who were I-like\nme, or better than me, had to -- had to -- had to die because of being one religion or\nanother religion, or -- it\u2019s -- it -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a crazy, crazy world. Crazy, and no\nsensit -- without any hearts, without any sensitivity. They may have had a mind, but not a\nheart at all. To be a good person, you have to have -- not only you have to have a good\nheart, above all, and a mind, too. That\u2019s all I really can say about tt.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t we go back to after you arrived in the United States, and you -- maybe you\ncan say something about how you -- you established your business.

        "A: Right.",
        "Q: What -- what else happened in those early years?",
        "A: When I came to the United States, I came at the invitation of my brother, who wanted\nme to work with him. At that time, my brother was in the feather and down business, but\nwhen I came, we bought a building on Staten Island, a-and it was formerly Wrigley\nchewing gum building. And since there was a shortage of feathers and down still, we\nwent into -- to manufacture foam rubber. We hired some engineers from Firestone, I\nbelieve Firestone company, and chemists, and we built a plant. Then the Korean war\nbroke out, and there was a shortage of latex. We had to buy latex via Europe, where\nthere\u2019s other cu -- via Canada. We had the -- then they established quotas. So we worked\nfor several years, then we had to sell the plant, you know, for a -- maybe two, three years\nlater. [indecipherable] company [indecipherable]. At that time, my brother and I, we\nstarted investing money in the oil business, in -- in Texas, and Wyoming, and so on. I\ninvested a certain amount of money, and he had most of the money. It didn\u2019t go too well,\nand then I met Eleanor, and I -- around that time, and my brother Maurice came to the\nUnited States, about three years later. And he said, \u201c\u201cWhy you -- ano -- you have been\nlosing money there. Why you stay in the oil business?\u201d The first -- so, and -- I was more\nclose to Maurice, he was close in age, and went through together all the -- all the war\nyears. So, I went back to the feather business, but my brother Arthur stayed in the oil\nbusiness, became very, very, very affluent. Was listed on the New York Stock Exchange,\nand so on, became a public company. And I then went into real estate, into -- used to buy\nsome buildings, renovate them, then I went into -- I had a -- a structural engineer, and --\nand a architect. I had a -- a partner who was an architect. We started building -- put up\nsome buildings, and -- and I became successful with real estate. And my other broth --\nMaurice was -- still in the feather and down business, until he passed away about 18 or 20\nyears after [indecipherable] -- about 20 years, yeah. So his son came in, he was running\nit, and we sold it only a couple years ago. So, I was involved in these two businesses. Did\nI answer -- I hope I answered the question.",
        "Q: It seems that your family stayed very, very close. The -- those who survived, and\nmaybe -- d-do you want to say anything more about your relationship with Maurice, and -\n- after the war?",
        "A: Right. I was much closer to him, yes. My brother Arthur was 16 years older, and he\nhas his ways, a certain way and I didn\u2019t always see it his way, you know\u201d? He was more --\nI was more conservative, he was more -- he -- he would take chances, and so on. But he --\nhe succeeded, you know. And he -- he passed away only about six years ago. He was 86,\nthen, you know?",
        "Q: Did your relation -- I mean, you had been so -- through so much with Maurice during\nthe war --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- di -- was your relationship with him very important to you, afterwards?",
        "A: Yes, I would say so. I don\u2019t know, if I had Maurice, say -- or if Maurice had me there,\nwhether we would even have survived, you know? It just -- just helped each other. A\nmatter of fact, he wasn\u2019t well, I would give him my food, you know, he didn\u2019t\n[indecipherable] food, and vice versa, you know, so on, it\u2019s -- and we always said, we\nmust survive this, and we will -- we will show them. We\u2019ll take revenge on them, what\nkind of revenge, yeah. No, we\u2019ll never go to Germany.",
        "Q: Did you ever talk, beyond that, about your -- about your experiences, or reminisce\ntogether, or was it --",
        "A: W1-with Maurice, yes.",
        "Q: With Mauri --",
        "A: We did, but not too extensively, but we did talk about different -- about the family,\nabout different -- other different things, yes, over the years. We did. We were very close.\nWas close to Arthur, too, but different. He didn\u2019t go through the war years, h-he was -- he\nwas more of a free person, you know\u201d?",
        "Q: You mentioned the Korean war starting.",
        "A: 1950, yeah.",
        "Q: Did -- did you -- did -- did -- did you have a -- a strong feeling about th-the Cold War,\nabout politics in the United States at that time, was that something that you took an\ninterest in?",
        "A: I -- I only was ups -- upset, and I should say, whenever I heard every day, so many\nAmericans were killed, and so many were killed that I was very upset about it. But I\ndidn\u2019t think of politics, took me quite awhile. And I didn\u2019t understand much about the\nsystem. I knew it\u2019s a democratic system, but I didn\u2019t understand the standard, to what\nextent. It took me awhile to -- to recognize every -- everything. And once I recognize it, I\n-- of course I read about it, and spoke to people about, you know, different happenings.\nSee, you get -- you get enlightened.",
        "Q: Was there anything that you can recall that -- that held a particular interest for you? I\nme -- maybe the Civil Rights movement, or McCarthyism, or anything that you can think\nof?",
        "A: I remember about McCarthyism, yes, that I took an interest, and I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve felt that it\nis a -- I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s the right expression, demagogue, you know? He also\naccused people of being Communists without having any knowledge, or enough to prove\nth-that they\u2019re actually Communists. He -- he was a -- I think he was a disgrace to the ga\n-- to -- to the United States, and yeah, I -- I still feel that, if I think about it, h-he wa -- he\nwas doing more harm than ever did good.",
        "Q: When were your -- when was your first child born?",
        "A: My first child was born in \u201953. His name is Andrew, and he\u2019s an attorney, but he\nworks wi-with me in real estate development. We had another son, James. Unfortunately,\nhe -- he -- he drowned. He went on a vacation -- not actually on vacation, he went to fee -\n- Eleanor -- Eleanor, my wife, Eleanor has a sister in Phoenix, and she had -- she has two\nsons, they were -- and -- and James, and Andrew were very close to their sons, they were\na similar age, only a couple years -- the others were a couple of years younger. When\ntheir son George was accepted at University of Colorado, and Eleanor\u2019s sister called up\nJim, he was very -- George was very close to Jim, he said, \u201cYou know my -- my husband\nGeorge,\u201d senior, okay, \u201cwould like to take little George,\u201d they call him, \u201cto -- to college,\nbut he has business appointments, and it\u2019s difficult for him to go away. But like Jim, let\nJim take him, because he likes Jim, so how about Jim?\u201d Eleanor was hesitating for\nawhile. She said, \u201cIll let you know.\u201d She call, ask Jim. Jim would love to go. And he --\nhe said when geor -- when they were here -- during Christmas season they were in Palm\nBeach, and they talked about it, ef -- that he would take him to college. So he went. One\nday, Jim called us up on Friday night, to tell us that -- when he\u2019s coming back from\nColorado, which plane on -- on Sunday, because he had to start school, you know? He\nwent to University of Pennsylvania War-Warton school. He was a year ahead in school,\nyou know, very bright. Come [indecipherable] on Saturday, at four -- four o\u2019clock or so,\nwe got a call from Colorado, or from Phoenix. From Phoenix, probably, that Jimmy\ndrowned. What happened 1s, Jim took George to college, to the university. Then th-they\nrented bicycles, and they drove to a waterway nearby, a few miles away. The waterway\nhad coves for swimmers, and the buoys, you know, that separate the waterway from the\ncoves were not -- weren\u2019t there, because there was a storm a coup -- few days before. So\na boat -- while Jimmy went swimming laps around the cove, a boat came in. There were -\n- there were other kids swimming, a little further, he may have been 20 yards, 10 yards, I\ndon\u2019t know, away from, cause you know, he was an a -- he was on the swimming team,\nas a matter of fact, at the University of Pennsylvania, so -- boat came in, he saw the boat\ncoming in, he took a dive. When he heard the boat passed, he came up, so that he didn\u2019t\nrealize that the skier -- the skier was a woman, she hit him in the head, and he -- he\ndrowned. They thought he took another dive. And the boat never stopped. And he\ndrowned. And you asked -- we had depositions, we asked the husband and wife. First of\nall, on that waterway, they had to sign a statement that they can be only in the waterway,\nthey cannot go into the coves. He violated that. Then, we were in a conference room, I\nwould say less wide than this room, about a little longer, but narrower. We\u2019re sitting at a\nconference table, and there was a -- a pic -- a painting on the wall. So my attorney asked\nher, because she was wearing thick glasses, \u201cCan you tell me what you see in this\npicture?\u201d She said no. \u201cOkay, are these reading glasses?\u201d She said, \u201cNo, these for\ndistance, and sum -- I can\u2019t read with them, they\u2019re mostly for distance.\u201d \u201cYou cannot\nidentify the picture?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cDid you wear these glasses while you were skiing, while\nyou on the skis?\u201d She says no. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wear the glasses?\u201d \u201cI would lose them,\nthey would fall off.\u201d She thought it was a dog swimming. She killed him, actually, you\nknow. And that\u2019s the story about.",

        "A: We press char -- we spent a fortune in legal fee, couldn\u2019t do it. They wouldn -- didn\u2019t\nwant to make a criminal case out of it, because they have too many cases for killing\npeople. Colorado\u2019s a funny state. You know the maximum you get for killing a young\nperson is only 10,000 dollars. We spent maybe 60,000 dollars in legal fees.\n[indecipherable] come there many times, and always they couldn\u2019t do anything. We even\nhad witnesses, you know, that -- we hired a detective to figure out -- our lawyers hired\none to -- the whole report, but didn\u2019t -- it was nothing. They say it was not intended -- the\n-- the intention was not to kill, but whatever. We couldn\u2019t -- we couldn\u2019t get -- there was\nno cooperation by -- even by the court. The ti -- 1t\u2019s an accident, they say. And the kids --\nhis cousin was standing in -- looking at where Jimmy was swimming, and so on, but he\ndidn\u2019t realize it, he\u2019s not going to come back. And the boats left, couldn\u2019t -- you know, it\ntook several days to find him, we had to hire -- we had -- it\u2019s very deep water there.

        "Q: I -- you ma -- I don\u2019t think you mentioned on tape, but something that I was interested\nin -- in hearing you talk a little bit more about, you said when you first moved to Palm\nSprings, that there were --",

Some people say about 30 this -- but I\nremember 25 years ago, that was the case. I know even a person who wanted to check in\nwith his wife, they said no you -- you can\u2019t. Also, the people in -- if you went to stores,\nand so on, you look like you are -- you don\u2019t belong here. They gave that feeling. They\nwere not friendly.",
        "Q: You personally had that feeling when you went to stores sometimes?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have it as much, but people talked about it. Maybe I\u2019m more tolerant than\nothers, you know? And you just sense it. You know, wherever you went, it was -- they\ndidn\u2019t treat you politely. It was an -- little edge, you know? They didn\u2019t want Jewish\npeople to come to Palm Beach. Obviously it used to be, very -- almost no Jews. But as\nthe Jewish people came more and more s-successful, and so they -- they used to go to M-\nMiami, and the sometime Miami too busy, they came here. And now they say many of\nthe Gentiles moving out. They go more north, you know. Some of them, yeah. They don\u2019t\n-- that\u2019s the story. But we never were insulted by anybody, any -- but they were cold to\nus, you know? I didn\u2019t feel any particular pressure, but some people did.",
        "Q: And how -- how did that change? What -- what made that change? Can you --",
        "A: I think we became very active in the hospitals, two hos -- Saint Mary was the\nChristian hospital, and Good Samaritan was more like a private estate operated -- Jewish\npeople, I would say, made major contributions to the hospitals. And eventually the two\nhospital merge. Many Jewish doctors came from -- from New York, or wherever.\nChicago, and so on. And Christians. The hospitals became much more staffed better.\nThey bought equipment, you know. Here, you need a major operation, you couldn\u2019t --\nyou had to go to Miami or New York, or wherever else. Now, the hospitals are very well\nstaffed, very good medical research they\u2019re doing, and they are connected with New\nEngland Hospital, in Massachusetts someplace, and also Mount Sinai, New York.\nVideotape -- they can videotape operations, and there -- there\u2019s a big, big, big change.\nPeople, when they took sick, they used to go to their hometown, back to their own doctor.\nNow, they don\u2019t do it. Plus, we also helped building the Kravitz Center, which 1s a -- a\nplace where they -- they have operas, and they have shows, and -- and all that, and I -- I\nthink it was mostly Christian and Jewish, but a big -- I -- I -- I would say at le -- more\nthan half the money came from Jewish people. There\u2019s a little more -- more culture. I\nwould say they contributed money to the -- to small museums, and s -- and now the Jews,\nand the Gentiles work together in all these places, so it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a very good relation. Once\na year they have a ball for the -- for the hospital, you know? You have -- we have many\nfine Christians, and fine Jewish people meet, and also the Kravitz Center, they meet, have\nspecial gala nights, you know? So at least once, or more than once a year, different artists\ncome from all over -- from all over the -- the country, and -- and Europe. The Moscow\norchestra recently, and the -- some French theater -- what do they call, I forget -- artist\nperforming, and so on.",

And so she\u2019s very, very knowledgeable, and she served for a couple years in\nthe -- they wanted her to stay.

Christian, lovely -- they all -- tell you a -- I find it may be my -- I -- I hope I\u2019m not\nwrong, I find the -- the educated people relate more, cause the Jewish educated people,\nyeah, they have something in -- in common. The uneducated are -- are more hateful, for\nsome reason, on Jews, I don\u2019t know. Ignorance. And that probably is everywhere. They\ndon\u2019t understand that we -- we are people, we are good and bad in every religion, every\nrace, I find they have good and bad people. People who contribute to society, and people\nwho don\u2019t. People who try to make it a wor -- a better world, and people who don\u2019t care,\nor obstruct. But that\u2019s society, that\u2019s -- who knows how many years this will take, how\nmany generations, you know, for this to improve and vanish?

        "A: I will brief -- Pll make it brief.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: In my dream was a I-lady who was a neighbor of ours. She was childless, and she,\nwhen I was young, as a child, maybe even when I was seven, six, seven, she always liked\nto play with me, and see what I\u2019ve done in school, you know, she wa -- she was like my\nsecond mother. She was -- she just li -- we were next door neighbors. I woke -- and she\n[indecipherable] she called me Nockmush. My name was Nochman, my Hebrew name,\nand she called me Nockmush, you know? \u201cNockmush, Nockmush, don\u2019t go there. Don\u2019t\ngo. Listen to me, don\u2019t go,\u201d she told me. \u201cDon\u2019t go to meet these people.\u201d She told me\nseveral times. I woke up. I was suppo-posed to meet these two individuals. I was -- I was\n-- | don\u2019t know what to do. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d I didn\u2019t go, and these two guys, one\nwas Christian, one was Jewish, they -- they had all people getting out of -- from Poland,\nyoung people, military age. They -- they must have bribed some Italian who were in\ncharge of -- they went by -- in Krakow they used to stop, for some reason or another. So\nwhat they would do, they would get uniforms, and bandaged up, let\u2019s say like -- a guy\nlike me, they put [indecipherable] bandaged up, and make believe you can\u2019t talk. They\nput you on the train, you know? Take drove you up there, put you on the train, and you\ncan\u2019t [indecipherable]. That\u2019s what I -- my parents and my brother felt, let somebody at\nleast get out, so they -- maybe you\u2019ll be able to get in touch with Arthur in the United\nStates, and so on. Something -- do something. But I didn\u2019t go. So, now I lived in Italy,\nand after I was there maybe a year, I had a very strong desire to go back to Poland. And --\nand my brother Maurice, too. He di -- I was hesitating a little bit, for one reason, but he\ndefinitely wanted to go. I wanted -- what we wanted to do is, we wanted to -- we -- we\nmarked up where they shot my father, and they -- they left him there, and then we buried\nhim. We -- we measured how f -- how many feet from that tree to this tree, to this\nlocation, that location. And there were two other men [indecipherable] put them in that\nburial place, not just -- so my father came to me, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t come. I -- we were all\nburned, you won\u2019t find any -- you won\u2019t find any ashes even.\u201d All burned. What they did,\nthey excavated men from wher-wherever they were buried, and they put them 1n fa -- put\nthem in one group, and burned them. So I don\u2019t want -- the other reason I didn\u2019t want to\ngo, right after the war, I le -- I learned in Munich, if you go back to Poland, they draft you\n-- if you -- in the 20\u2019s, you know, from 19 to 28, or to 30, I don\u2019t remember exactly. They\ndraft you in the Russian army, they put you. So I was that time 22 years old, so I didn\u2019t\nwant to go. That\u2019s one of the reasons why I never went back to Poland. I don\u2019t want to go\nin the ar -- in the Russian army after all this. And my brother felt -- he\u2019s nine years older,\nhe -- he -- him they don\u2019t want to draft. He looked a little frail, too, that time. He -- they\nprobably wouldn\u2019t ha -- but I -- I -- I felt pretty -- for all that I -- pretty healthy.",
        "Q: Did you ever have any other dreams in your life that were important to you?",

I -- because I don\u2019t even\nremember. I know I had certain dreams, but I don\u2019t remember them. My sisters came to\nme [indecipherable] like -- like not -- I would see my mother or my father in my sleep,\njust like 1t was, you know, 50 years ago. But they don\u2019t usually talk to me.",
        "Q: They just appear?",
        "A: Yeah. But this, actually were words. I -- I\u2019m convinced something must be\nsuperhuman, to -- to -- to have -- to witness that, to experience that. But it happened.\nMaybe somebody\u2019s watching over me.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t you tell again, how -- you said it in the videotape, but it might be more\ncomplete if you said how you found out about what had actually happened to your\nfather\u2019s body.",
        "A: It came in my dream. He came and told me that they burned all of me, and the two\nothers.",
        "Q: But didn\u2019t you have a brother-in-law who -- who had told you that -- cause he -- yeah.",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s right. When my brother-in-law came to Italy then, subsequently, I ask him,\ndid you -- because he returned to Poland, and he was not of military age. And he stayed\nin Poland for maybe a year, or less. At least six months to a year. And I -- we ask him,\ndid you go to -- because he was with us in that brush factory, you know, the -- and he saw\nwhen they took my brother out and two of his, you know, friends. Whoever buried him,\nhe was part of it. Did he ever go back to Plaszow to see about our father, you know? He\nsaid, \u201cYes, I went several times. I found out they ex -- they excavated everybody, and\nthey burned them.\u201d The whole -- they -- when they liquidated Plaszow, before the\nRussian came, there were couple hundred people to clean up. Course, what they did there,\nI -- I think they -- they killed tens of thousand of people there, from med -- I -- I would\nsay mostly Gentile. They brought in from outside the camp. I don\u2019t know for what\ncharges, whether -- they mostly young people. They were -- they brought them on open\ntrucks, because they -- they brought it up to a hill there. And what -- what they did is they\nbeat them, and they had to undress, and they were all -- they -- during the day, they --\nevery -- they were excavating trenches, you know? Maybe a hundred people excavating\nthe -- prepare for loads, and then they buried them, covered them up. So that wa -- they\nexcavated the -- again, and burned them, you know? That\u2019s what I was told by my\nbrother-in-law, yeah.",
        "Q: How did your -- how did Maurice respond when you had that dream? Did he -- did he\ntake it at -- at -- did he believe that it was true, or how --",
        "A: He believed it was true. Because the fact is, that two people were killed.

I -- We don\u2019t know. If\n-- if you\u2019re religious, it\u2019s a message from God, if it\u2019s -- or, they can explain it many other\nway. I don\u2019t know. I would say if -- after the war, I did not believe in God. It took me a\nnumber of years, and I do believe in God. But can I prove things? Of course not. Certain\nthings, but it\u2019s -- but you have to accept it. Eleanor, not having all this experience, she\ndoesn\u2019t believe much in God. She says why -- especially since we lost Jimmy.

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We live in that town, my aunts, and my -- not only my parents, my grandparents were\nborn there. And we were ver -- respected citizens of that town. My grandfather, and my\nfather were running a business, and eventually my brothers helped also, alongside. The\nbusiness was a processing of feathers, and down, which they exported from Poland to the\nUnited States, and -- and several European countries. And during the peace time, that\ntown was a very small -- I\u2019m not certain how many people, but less than 10,000, and\nprimarily Jewish. And I -- I lived there for my first, let\u2019s say 12\" -- 12 years or so.\nSubsequently, I moved to Krakow.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Yes. The only connection about that town was that I went back to Poland only one\ntime. This was a dozen years ago, more or less. I think maybe more. There was a first\nmarch of Holocaust survivors and their children from -- to -- to Auschwitz a-and\nBirkenau, The March of the Living. And I -- I was one of them, and there were many\nothers from United States, and Canada, even Australia, South Africa. There were about\n2,000 young people. College -- college or high school age. And it was a very moving\nexperience. There were very -- dignitaries from Israel, and the former president, Ithzrak\nNavonne. He ray -- he was s-speaking, you know, to us about it, and it\u2019s -- was extremely\nmoving, and very, very upsetting, of course. Wi-With me went our -- one of our sons,\nAndrew went wi-with me on that trip, and also one nephew, Ben Belfer, and two c-\ncousins. And we were received by the Polish government, extremely well. They had all\nkinds of preparations, invited us to the Senate building, gave a couple parties, you know,\ncocktail parties, where we me-met Russian ge -- Russian generals. One of the Russian\ngenerals spoke Yiddish. And also they per -- had a -- performed a Jewish show in one of\ntheir Senate -- what do call them there, Senate building, it was a theater there, a theater\nbuilding. The show was all done ba -- mostly in -- in -- in Yiddish, Jewish, and some in --\nin the -- in Polish. During intermission, I went over to the person who, I was very\nimpressed with her singing. And I ask her how did she learn that, she was quite a young\nperson. She says from -- there was a cantor, before World War Two in Poland, and he --\nhe survived the war, and he had a lot of records, and she learned it from the records, you\nknow. The Polish government gave a special reception, because the following day, I\nremember, after the -- after they had that big performance, we had -- they invited about\n40 people, I was one of them, to the -- the assistant to -- General Yarowzelski, and he\ngave a whole speech about the Jewish people should come back to Poland, they lived\nthere for a thousand years, and since the Jewish people left -- most of them left, they were\n-- culturally, and business-wise, and -- and in many other aspects, you know, were\ncompletely eradicated, you know. There\u2019s no -- no industry, the -- and they had -- a\nmatter of fact, ask everyone what type of profession or business, and when I told them\nwhat my parents used to do, say, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come back, we will build a plant, we\u2019ll\ndo this and that.\u201d So after he gave a whole big speech, the former president of Israel,\nIthzrak Navonne said, \u201cToo little, too late.\u201d He spoke very fluent English. He said, \u201cWhat\nhappened,\u201d and give all kinds of dates, \u201cwhen the Jewish people came back to Poland, as\nthey came to their hometowns, what happened to them?\u201d He said, \u201cOh well, it\u2019s a\ndifferent regime.\u201d He asked, during certain dates, you know, so the -- there were all kinds\nof ordinances, you know, and if people came to the town, they would -- they were either\nshot, or they had to flee town, because their homes were occupied by Polish people, and\nthey didn\u2019t want to -- they felt they may want to reclaim their property. So they had to\nflee. As a matter of fact, a school-mate of mine, he and two other people came back to\ntown. Their house was all mostly demolished, but they had no place to stay, they stayed\nthere. So one late afternoon, they knocked at the door, and my friend opened the door,\nand they shot him. So the other two left, you know. So my memories about it, is I would\nnever want to go back there again. As a matter of fact, yes, I still remember, when I was\nthere, with my son -- in -- in Wodzislaw, my son and my nephew, my cousins, we -- we\nrented a -- a car, you know. And we escorted to the cem -- I didn\u2019t remember where the\ncemetery is -- the Jewish cemetery is. We went to the cemetery, and there was not o-one\ntombstone [indecipherable] not at all. And there was a -- young kids, who were -- they\nsaw a car there, they saw, you know, they saw people dressed differently, whatever. They\ncame over and started -- I said -- you know, we asked him what about the cem -- what\nhappened to the cemetery. They were teenagers, actually. Oh, well they were demolished.\nAnd they -- you want to see res -- where the tombstones are? They were -- they made\nwalkways out of them, they made stables [indecipherable] floors, and so on.",

And the parents were not alive, but I\u2019ve been in touch with\nthe daughter of -- and the son-in-law. They came to visit me, to Warsaw, and we met in\nthe hotel. Of course, I was very warm to them, and I gave them a certain as -- cert-certain\n-- in Poland, it was a substantial amount of money. So a -- they appreciate it, and they --\nthey do write, send me a Christmas card, or -- or write to me from time to time.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: I still f -- had a -- I would say a warm feeling for them, because they did risk their\nlives by helping, and the money, obviously, ha -- we had -- 1 -- if I -- I do remember that,\nwe had a manager in one of our plants in Krakow, you know, manager who managed the\nfeather and down business. He would go every two weeks to the place, and make sure\nhow -- how my parents are, and my -- and the -- and the -- and the sisters, and s -- and the\nchildren. And he would give money to that family for food, and other things, whatever. I\ndon\u2019t know how much. My father felt 1f he has a money with him [indecipherable] the\nmoney wasn\u2019t so much valuable any more, but they would keep some jewelry, or some\ngold coins, or whatever, just for emergency. He was afraid that if he gives it all in one\ntime, maybe the guy -- they were na -- she was always so -- they weren\u2019t sure, maybe, he\nwould get tired of us. And it became also, very impossible to live there for a couple of\nmonths. Was in November, was very cold, they were in -- actually hidden in a bunker, in\nan orchard garden. And two little children, they were tall -- they were taught not to speak,\nand not to cry or anything. It was quite a horrible scene.",
        "A: He was non-Jewish. He was a Christian. He worked for us for many years, was a very\nloyal person. But right after the war, the German put a trustee, you know. They took out\nall the inventory and shipped it to Germany, you know. But certain materials, they\nwanted to be processed there, so that manager worked there. He taught them. And\nsubsequently, one of my brothers worked there. That -- he felt 1f he helps them and -- and\nso on, he will survive -- it\u2019Il be easier for him to survive the war, you know.

        "A: [indecipherable]. Yes, but we lost con -- he must have passed away after. We did write\nto him, and a matter of fact, we -- from -- at that time we lived in Italy, and we send him\npackages, you know, of certain delicacies, you know, which was not available in Poland.\nBut then we st -- we couldn\u2019t hear from him. His name was Sh-Sh-Trzyna -- T-r-z-y-n-a.\nI don\u2019t remember the first name.

We emptied everything out. So this was like a compensation. In addition, we\nmade sure we paid them for the f-food, and we pay -- also f -- whatever else he asked for,\nyou know. It -- but still, wi -- I feel with all that, he was a decent human being.",
        "A: Right. I had school friends, from high school, you know, in Krakow, and none of them\nreally cont-contacted me, I mean even when still was pretty quiet, they all stayed away,\nyou know?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Positively, I wa -- I -- am -- definitely would trust -- it\u2019s a different system, you\nknow, in the United States, it\u2019s a democratic system, and every citizen has it\u2019s rights, and\nthe Constitution protects every cit-citizen. S -- but in Poland, although the Jewish people\nlived there over a thousand years, as a matter of fact, there\u2019s -- in that small town,\nWodzislaw, there\u2019s a synagogue which was over a thousand years old. But during the war\nyears, it was -- made a stable out of it, the Germans, you know, kept horses there, and so\non. And everything was destroyed. As a matter of fact, I was told it\u2019s being rebuilt now,\nthey want to attract tourism, and so on, different parts of Poland, yeah. The -- the Polish\npeople in particular are very, very anti-Semitic, and I -- and how can I -- I can explain it\nis, my own family and I had an experience, although we were very respected citizens.\nWhen the Germans came in, the first day they came in, they knocked at every -- they\nwere shooting in front of your house, and there were a lot of screaming, and s -- and so\non. We were -- we were hiding in a warehouse that we owned. And finally they came to\nour door, they were steel doors, they were banging and shooting, and -- and calling in\nGerman, \u201cGet out, you [indecipherable] get out.\u201d You know, and eventually we had to\nget out. They were beating us, and we had to run to a square. And then, they shot several\npeople, put some houses on fire. So people didn\u2019t come out, they put them on fire. And\nwe are all this -- on that square they [indecipherable] on us, several -- maybe it\u2019s couple\nthousand, or several thousand people. Then they left. So once they left, my parents felt\nth-these were the first ones coming in, they were -- had tanks, you know, that we heard.\nSo what -- my parents said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the church, there\u2019s a church nearby.\u201d And we\nwere there only minutes, I don\u2019t know, less than a half hour. The priest himself, in\ncharge, he said, \u201cYou Belfers, you zhid -- you Jews,\u201d you know, \u201cget out.\u201d And actually\npushed us out, you know. Said, [indecipherable]. So we ran to -- we had an uncle, you\nknow, who lived outside -- a little far out -- outs -- outside town. We stayed there for\novernight, a couple nights, I don\u2019t remember, a few days, you know. I\nt calmed down, so we went back to the house. We got -- we got no help, really, to speak\nof. Not only that, I know of cases who were -- some people that I knew were hiding in the\narea, but if a neighbor would know, or found out, that they being hidden, they would\nreport them, you know? And the people, not only the Jewish people got either shot, or\nsent to a concentration camp, or whatever, but also the Gentile. But there was no -- there\nwere -- the Germans got only cooperation from everyone. The church leaders in\nparticular, and it was a bad, bad time, and I can\u2019t explain it even nowadays, why there\nshould be such hate 1n a -- in some people\u2019s mind towards the Jewish people. The Jewish\npeople have contributed a lot, not only in -- in Poland, everywh -- everywhere they lived,\nin -- in many fields, whether it\u2019s medicine, or whether it\u2019s engineering, or -- or -- or so\nmany other important fields. But obviously it goes back so many years, it goes back to --\nit goes back to a thousand years, claiming that things that we did to Christ, which is a lie,\nand even the ner -- the -- the New Testament is not very accurate. Even the Pope recently\nstated that. And as far as Jesus, he was a Jew, he died as a Jew, and he was not killed by\nthe Jewish people, he was killed by the Romans. He may have -- may have -- he may\nhave wanted to do some reforming, or whatever. But why they -- why -- it\u2019s 2,000 years\nlater, why is this being taught, or when -- or when -- that\u2019s why there\u2019s that hate builds\nup, from childhood. They go to churches, they\u2019re [indecipherable] Jews, or other\nreferences to Jew, although it has been removed now from the liturgy, I -- I hope that futu\n-- future generations will not ever have to experience difficulties and obstructions in -- of\njustice and everything, because they have one religion, or another religion. I don\u2019t -- I\ndon\u2019t believe one religion\u2019s better than the other, they\u2019re all the same, they all teach you\nto be a better person. They don\u2019t teach you to hate.

        "A: I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve f-fell -- I couldn\u2019t sleep nights, I was so upset, you know. With all they\ntried to do for us, it\u2019s amazing, they even send someone to the hotel, one officer of the\ngovernment. He introduced himself, and I had met him at the cocktail party. He showed\nme a -- gave me a card, I may have it even, I don\u2019t know. He says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come\nback to Poland? You built the industry.

As a matter\nof fact,\u201d he said, \u201cthat time, you know, we are not like in Russia. In Russia,\u201d he says, \u201cthe\ngovernment dictates what the people should do, and in Poland, the gover -- the people\ndictate, not the,\u201d -- which we all almost laughed, they were under Russian regime, and --\nbut we felt, how can they even say that, not being afraid to say it, but they probably felt\nnobody\u2019s going to go tell the Russians what they said.

And s -- she -- let\u2019s see, was two years, or one year\nyounger than Arthur, yeah. I would say, she must have been 15 years older, or 14. 14 or\n15 years. Then I have a brother Maurice, who survived the war wi -- with me. But he --\nhe passed away, unfortunately, let\u2019s say about -- almost 20 years ago, yeah. He was much\nmore affected from the war years than I was. He -- his wife and a child, the child was\nonly three or four years old, maybe three years old, was in hiding near Krakow, also\nsome Christian friends. And one day she went shopping to -- for groceries, you know,\nwith the child. She didn\u2019t look specifically Jewish, you know? She spoke very fluent\nPolish, and all that, like -- like a native, of course. Somebody reported to the police while\nshe was walking out of the store. They waited for her, and shot her right -- right there,\nbecause she started to cry and protest. The child, we don\u2019t know. There -- there was a\nwitness that we met, after the war, told us that he was -- he didn\u2019t -- he -- he didn\u2019t\nactually see it, but he was in the same town, hiding, and he -- he was told that the child\nhad just walked away, or whatever. Somebody may have taken the child, they don\u2019t know\nwhat happened. I\u2019ve done a lot of investigation, we can\u2019t find any trace of it. And the\nreason I -- we did some investigation, in po -- in Warsaw, there's a hotel called Belfer. I\nthought, maybe, you never know, you know. I -- through the Red Cross, then through\nfriends of mine who were in Poland. When I was in Poland, I didn\u2019t -- I wasn\u2019t aware of\nthat. May have been built after, when I was in Poland with that mission, you know, to\n[indecipherable] I was told by the Re-Red Cross in a letter, and also by some friends\nsubsequently, that the reason the hotel is called Belfer, Belfer in poli -- in -- 1 -- they -- in\nschool, they called it Belfer like a nickname. Professor they called a Belfer. It\u2019s a pension\nfund for teachers, and they have investment there, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s all -- called Belfer.\nThere\u2019s no relationship. I was about to s-s -- aba -- was Maurice, and I had a -- a sister\ncalled Sheindla, or Sheindo. Schein means pretty, beautiful, you know, it\u2019s -- and sh --\nshe must have been eight -- seven or eight years older than I am -- than I was. She was a\nvery beautiful girl, very, very intelligent, and very high marks always a s -- in school, she\nalways was the top of the class. Then I had another si-sister, Helena, or Hya. She -- she\nmust have been only two years older than I am. Two or three, I\u2019m not sure. She also was\na lovely, lovely girl, and they all are actually -- what -- what tragically happened to my\nsisters, they -- the three sisters, they were in camp wi-with -- with my parents, an-and me,\nand -- and Maurice, in Plaszow -- in Krakow, the concentration camp, Plaszow. And after\nbeing there a year, more or less, they were -- all the women were taken out. We didn\u2019t\nknow where or what. My mother, and my sisters. And one child of -- of -- of my sister\nMindla, she -- her name was Sarah, the little child, and she was maybe eight years old, or\nso. First they took -- there were several hidden children, she was one of them. First they\ntook the children out, then the women, we didn\u2019t know where, what, you know. They\nalways would tell you, \u201cOh, they\u2019re going to a much better camp, and much easier ts --\nit\u2019s overcrowded here.\u201d They had all kinds -- they had a -- schemes developed to fool y --\nus. We had not -- we tried to believe, we had no choice, you know? But not believing was\nworse. But after the war, when we were liberated, we tried to contact -- we met different\npeople in different areas, in different camps, you know, we went to Salzburg, and -- and\nit\u2019s in my tapes, I went to Italy, but I came -- from Italy, I went back to Munich. I heard\nin Munich there were big gathering of survivors, you know, from all over Germany, you\nknow, Austria. And when I came there, I met some people. And they told me that they all\nwere sent to Auschwitz. But subsequently, maybe a -- months, or a year later, was a\nwoman who was a sis -- a friend of my younger sister Helena, and she said, \u201cI was with\nyour three sisters in Denya -- Diensk -- that -- Polish ports, one 1s German, one is Polish.\nYour sisters were there, and I was there, and only days -- ma -- a week or less before the\nRussians came into that section of Poland, they put -- they told the people they -- they\nhad pr -- factories, they were the -- sewing uniforms, they told them that they going to be\nexchanged for German prisoner of war in Sweden. They gave everybody a piece of bread,\nand tried to calm -- this was a way of calming, you know? Put them -- loaded them on\nboats, very a -- packed them in like in cattle cars, you know, the same way. And they say\ngoing to Sweden, but they torpedoed all the boats. We don\u2019t know, there could be 10,000\nof them. Only about a hundred were left to clean up, and th -- one of the hundred was that\nfriend of my sister, yeah.",
        "A: In Milan, also, were, at that time -- this was almost a year after the war, there was a\nplace where [indecipherable] where displaced people would stay. It used to be a -- a\nmilitary pl-place, you know, a caserba, you know? And I would -- we already had an\napartment in Milan, we -- that we rented, yeah, my brother and I. So we used to go there,\ndaily almost, just -- just meet some people, see who -- who -- what -- always new people\ncoming there. Many of them were -- intended to go to Israel. Th-They stopped there for\nsome reason. Also to look for other people. She heard -- she was talking to people that\nthe Belfers are here in town, because she met some other pe -- so, one day we came there.\nShe met us, you know. And she told us the whole story, you know. My mother, however,\ndid -- did perish in Auschwitz.",
        "A: Because that\u2019s -- that was obvious because the -- the trains from Plaszow all went to\nAuschwitz, and they segregated the people. Young people looked fit, they put on one\nside, and my mother that time was a -- in the 50\u2019s -- maybe 50 -- 56 or 57, something\nlike that.",
        "A: Y-Yes, because the whole -- most of the women were per-perished -- ya -- only\nyoung, fitting w-women they kept. The others were gassed. They told them they going to\nget -- have to shower, the delousing, they called it, they give them new clothes, and they\ngas them, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Mo -- yes.",

        "A: UNRRA -- UNRRA.",
        "A: UNRRA would send packages and so on.",
        "A: However, I believe I mentioned in the prior tapes, you know -- video -- video tapes,\nwhile we were there, one American officer, some -- I could speak some E-English,\nbecause I studied English in high school, I -- he took an interest in me. So I told him, you\nknow, I have a brother in -- in New York, but there is no mail, you can\u2019t -- there was no\nmail there, no official mail -- military mail, where they could help me. He says, \u201cWhat is\nhis name, where does he live?\u201d I say, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d My other brother Maurice was with\nme, he says he -- he -- he used to stay at Hotel Broadway in New York, but he doesn\u2019t\nknow where he is now. This officer wrote to Hotel Broadway in New York, and asked\nwhether or no -- whether a name by the -- Arthur Belfer, his name was Artur, but he\nchanged it to Arthur, you know. So, a letter came back, and it -- but -- I wrote the letter,\nand I told him, we are here, we are -- we survive, we\u2019re -- and we don\u2019t know whether\nanybody else survived. We -- we are afraid to -- I\u2019m afraid to say that no one else\nsurvived except me -- I and -- and Maurice. And Maurice wrote a few lines. He s -- he\nwired us 500 dollars, to a bank. I didn\u2019t even -- I didn\u2019t even tell him anything. So, the\nbank knew displaced people, so they walked around with a sign Belfer, sent somebody\nover. So I went over, and I sp -- couldn\u2019t speak to this guy. I tried to speak to him in\nGerman, I was -- I was fluent in German. He couldn\u2019t speak English, I couldn\u2019t spe -- he\ncouldn\u2019t speak Polish, he couldn\u2019t speak Hebrew, so I couldn\u2019t -- so he said -- in Italy,\nthey say come, they say like this. I didn\u2019t know [indecipherable] what it -- what it means.\nFinally he said -- so we went to the bank. My brother and I, then we had a few friends\nwalk with us, too. We went in -- my brother and I went into the bank. They were\n[indecipherable] waited outside, I said, [indecipherable] I didn\u2019t know why, but I -- I\nassumed there was someone. So the manager spoke German. He says, \u201cHebert kinder,\u201d\nyou know. He was very, very -- w-we have money for you, you know, 500 dollars. Said\nokay. \u201cBut, I ca -- I am not going to give you the money now, come after three o\u2019clock.\u201d\nSo, my brother and I say, \u201cWhy after three o\u2019clock, I want the money now.\u201d He says,\n\u201cLeave it kinder,\u201d you know, you\u2019re children, [inaudible]. \u201cIt\u2019s much better come later.\nPll give you now te -- 10 dollars Italian money, you know?\u201d And when we came after\nthree, he told us, you know, the Black Market 1s -- no -- is a -- a thousand lira per dollar,\nand officially it\u2019s a hundred lira, and he paid us out of the Black Market. He saw the way\nwe looked, you know. So he had some compassion, yeah. So after we had all that money,\nwe went -- all the -- the friends, we had [indecipherable] we went to a restaurant, and we\n-- they displayed in the window there, looked like chicken, but a-after we bought it and\nstart eating it, it was rabbit. We had a -- we bought wine and bread. We had a big party,\nyeah. We stayed there another several weeks. They said -- because we -- the reason we\nwent to Italy -- I wanted to go to Israel, and they told us then, the UNRRA had offices of\npeople, you know. People like you who he -- look healthy, and young, you most likely\nwill be intercepted by the British, you know, and the -- when you go by boat, and they\nsend you to Cyprus, because they -- they send a lot of people to Cyprus. So my brother\nand I stay from one camp to another camp. So then we decided we\u2019ll go to Milan. We\natch -- actually hitchhiked to Milan, because we didn\u2019t know where a railroad -- we\ndidn\u2019t know any -- couldn\u2019t -- nobody understood anything pr -- pr --",

They were very -- when I\nlived in -- I fell in love with the Italian people, really. I would have never come here to\nthe United States, because my broth -- my older brother encouraged me, he needed me,\nhe -- whatever he -- he was sick, and so on. Other that that, I would have never come. We\nhad establish a business there and so on. So we went to Milan.",
        "A: Fine.",
        "A: I had a passion -- a passion to go to Israel, yes. Yeah, I spoke Hebrew that time, and I\nwas -- I just felt we were -- we were so brutalized, and lost everyb -- thing, and every --\nlost my entire family. We just felt -- my brother and I -- but anyway, we came here. But\nw-went to Milan, we a -- we didn\u2019t know what -- we had money, we didn\u2019t know where\nto go, We -- we were -- way we were dressed, they probably wouldn\u2019t let us in a decent\nhotel. We slept on the railroad station. One of -- one of the Italian people, we ask him,\nyou know where we can stay, in -- in German, you know. Many business people in\nEurope spoke German. This -- like now, everybody speaks English in Europe, but they\nused to speak German especially business people, yeah. He said why don\u2019t -- the -- he\nsaid the railroad station were benches covered -- had -- covered th-those, if it rains, or\nwhatever. The next morning, we ga -- went to a public place where you can wash up, and\nshaved. We went out and bought clothes, and we called -- my brother, remembered we\nhave some business friends in Milan, Italian people. He remembered the name, we looked\nup the name. We called e -- the name was Guardini, and Fachikani. They had a lot of --\nmany stores, poultry stores, you know? All over, not only Milan, outside Milan, many\ncity -- many cities or towns. We -- they used to ship feathers to us, to Poland. So we call\nup, they say, \u201cPronto, pronto.\u201d I don\u2019t know what [indecipherable] even I couldn\u2019t -- I\nsaid -- I started s-speaking in German, they didn\u2019t understand, so I hung up. So my\nbrother and I said, \u201cHow do we talk to her? Let\u2019s go buy a dictionary.\u201d Bought a\ndictionary, we wrote out padrona, you know, going on. \u201cBolea polari con padrona,\u201d said,\nand yeah -- so we called again, and afa -- and I asked for Mr. Guardini, you know, Senor\nGuardini, padrona. He came to the phone, and he spoke fluent German. He says, \u201cWhy\ndon\u2019t you visit us, please come up, come up for lunch.\u201d So, we took a tax1, we went up.\nWe tal -- he knew what was going on, but didn\u2019t know -- we told him about our\nexperience. He says -- they took us out for lunch, and during lunch they said, \u201cWe know\nyou have a brother in New York, because he was in correspondence before.\u201d When the\nwar broke out, the first year or two, Italy was not so aligned later with Germans. So, they\nwere in touch from New York -- from -- from Milan, to New York, you know, these\npeople. They said, \u201cYou know, we have a lot of feathers and down accumulated.\u201d During\nthe war years you didn\u2019t do any exporting. \u201cSo why don\u2019t you take some samples and\nsend it to your brother? And this way you can make some money.\u201d [indecipherable] I\nsaid, \u201cBe happy.\u201d She, \u201cCome tomorrow morning [indecipherable] there.\u201d And ship me --\nthat\u2019s how we started making money. Then we became -- we organize a firm, we hired\nsome people. Now, we did some processing also in Milan. We set up equipment, and we\nbought feathers. We traveled all a -- that\u2019s probably what takes me out of depression, you\nknow, trudigu -- faster. We went to Czechoslovakia, to -- we went to Hungary,\nYugoslavia we went. We went -- bought as much feathers as we could get because there\nwas a shortage in the United States after world -- during the -- World War Two, they used\nup all f-feathers and down, only for military use, for sleeping bags. And there was very\nlittle for public -- for private, yeah, people. So a big market for it.",
        "A: Was just -- we felt -- we want -- you know, I wanted to prove to the world, and I --\nthat\u2019s -- that\u2019s probably why I\u2019m -- we are -- I\u2019m successful, that we are not stupid\npeople, that we have ambitions, and we have knowledge, and -- and underst -- we have\nintelligence, and whatever -- ever did it in my life, after World War -- I did only things --\nnot just to make the money, to -- to show that I\u2019m a decent human being, you know? I\u2019ve\nnever -- I -- I ca -- I -- I be frank, I have a big resentment with the Germans. Maybe more\nfor the Germans than the Poles, although the Poles were pretty bad, of course. And the\nresentment would have been -- lasted much longer if I ever went back to Poland, you\nknow, which [indecipherable] nobody there, or any other. The Italians, for some reason,\nwere so friendly. You know, even when I couldn\u2019t speak English. I remember the first\ntime we asked -- we wanted to go to cort -- coursa teachanase, how we go there? The\nItalians would say, \u201cGo straight here, make a right turn. Oh no, made a mistake.\u201d They\nshowed us, or they took us there, you know? They very, very friendly. We just -- and I\nhad some friends there, eventually. We loved Italy, because we were used to deplorable\ntreatment, so anybody who was nice, we found aba -- w-we fell in love with them. I had -\n- I really loved Italy, and we go there every so often. I -- I love Italy.",

None of the European\ncountries helped, and -- nobody helped us. And nobody gave us weapons. If anybody had\nweapons, had to turn them in, in the beginning, you know\u201d? The first two years, you hear\nthey would shoot somebody, or put you in jail for nothing, [indecipherable], but then\ngradually became harder and harder. They fooled you in such a way. Very little was\nknown, what was going on. And even the best of your neighbors, some of them, they\nwant -- if they, let\u2019s say, wanted to help, were afraid to help, see? But they\u2019re very few.\nAs a matter of fact, I was in -- at Yad Vashem, it\u2019s going to be two years in j -- this Ju-\nJune, yeah, where [indecipherable] the 50\" anniversary of the state of Israel. I believe\nthat\u2019s when it -- yes, \u201948, yeah. Yad Vashem invited 60 families from Europe who helped\n-- Righteous Gentile, you know?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It was extremely important, because we -- we felt -- I felt that they liberated the land\nthat th-the -- that the Arabs felt is their land, but if you go back in history, a lot of it\nbelonged to Israel. And even now, the dispute about the Gaza Strip, and other areas, you\nknow, that belong to Israel, but Israel is not a state. It\u2019s Palestine, and -- there\u2019s a conflict,\nof course, and I hope they -- they will have a peace tre-treaty, and try to live together, and\nthey\u2019ll be much better off by -- they don\u2019t have to love each other, but at least they should\nco-exist. By co-existing, the Arabs would definitely benefit, and I think even Israel would\nbenefit, having peace, not have to arm itself, and lose people, you know, and -- which is\ncompletely a waste of human life. They can -- but what 1s -- what 1s bad in -- in -- in -- in\nthese Arab countries, like Saudi Arabia has all the money, and other, and Iran, and all\nthis, they all -- they hate each other to -- they don\u2019t hate only Israel, they hate each other.\nIraq, you know? They depressed -- they oppressed the people, and they live like -- all the\nleaders in these countries li-live like kings. You see them when you go to Europe, in\nsome hotels, I\u2019ve met some -- I was in Switzerland maybe 10 years ago. They take entire\nfloors, they come with a whole crew, you know, they all -- a cook, and help, and what\nthey love most, I\u2019ve seen, they go to gambling casinos. They gamble maybe thousands, or\nmillions, who knows? They just -- the disgrace of their own people; instead of building\nthem up, they build themselves up, the leaders themselves. It\u2019s unfortunate. Also the\nmarket, let\u2019s say, the Arab -- because of the standard of living there, their wages are so\nlow by comparison to Israel, or by com -- comparison to European\u2019s standards. And even\ns -- Far East -- the Far East was -- China, or any of these countries, exporting a lot of\ngoods to the United States, because their labor is extremely -- 10 cents an hour. In the\nArab countries some ma -- don\u2019t make more, they\u2019re making less. They could build up\ntheir economies, like Japan did after World War two, and others, with the help of the\nIsraelis, but they -- their leaders are fighting, not even knowing what their -- they want,\nand every [indecipherable] they make, they don\u2019t live up to, you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a\nconstant problem. I hope the new generation will understand that better, be more\neducated, more broadminded, and there\u2019Il be peace in that area, and by having peace in\nthat area, will be peace also in many other areas, because we are interrelated in a way,\none country with a -- with another. I hope th -- Iraq, in particular, and Iran, that they have\nsome new governments, you know, which are more for the people, not for themselves.",

That was a time which was very\nunusual. That -- Adolf Eichmann, at that time, when we were in Israel, was brought from\nArgentina, or whatever, and was a big, big celebration, 1n a way.

Made big dinners, and we were -- the big ceremony at Yad Vashem, and\nthe many -- there were dignitaries from different countries, and -- and there was a\ndiscussion, one of the speakers said, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not sure whether it was Netanyahu, or\nsomebody else, during the war, World War two, there were 400 million people in -- in\nEurope, and how many do you think -- Gentiles -- helped Jewish people? Under 14,000.\nA fraction of -- less than one -- a fraction of one percent, you know. In other words, that\u2019s\n-- that tells a lot. The people who -- who were invited, were given special medals, like\n[indecipherable]. They were treated royally, they were invited to the -- to the president\u2019s\nhouse, and that really -- they -- they were so -- so amazed, and some of them say they\nwant to come and s -- and retire there. They were so -- so amazed, yeah. Yes, what I\nwanted to say, we met yes -- we met an elderly lady wi-with her son, from Holland. No --\nnot -- not from Holland, from Austria. She was put in a camp in Auschwitz. She was a\nGerman physician -- Austrian physician who helped Jewish people -- or Jewish friends,\nyou know? She helped them, something, she was put in -- into Auschwitz. And she said\nthat she worked under Mengele, you know? And he experimented with human lives, and\nso on. He gave and she was supposed to give him certain pills to take, you know, make\nsure that they swallow, and so on. A lot of them she did not distribute, she di -- she\ndisposed of it, you know, she -- and so on. Certainly she -- and she even said what -- what\nthe drugs were, certain drugs. She was a very elderly, and she wasn\u2019t in good health, she\nwas wearing a -- sh -- with crutches, you know. But her son was very intelligent. Nice\nman. And he explained the whole -- what meng -- what Mengele, what he did to the\nprisoners, you know. He kept them out nude in that na -- in the -- in the freezing weather,\nto try -- how much you can stand. There all kind of experiments. Whatever she could help\navoiding, she would -- she was risking her own life, but she said she couldn\u2019t say one hu -\n- why one human being could do this to another. And many of these Christians who were\ninvited, they were very loving people. They say what they did to -- to you. They call us\nbrother, and you know, they said -- they even said, you know -- I remember he said, we\nare brethren, beca -- we -- we believe in Jesus, and Jesus was a Jew. They even brought\nup, why would I hate the Jews, you know? He actually -- the Jews with the 10\ncommandments, all kinds. We tried -- they tried to explain their reasoning, tried to find\nwhy would this happen. It\u2019s -- this was quite interesting, and moving, of course.",

What happened 1s, Jim took George to college, to the university. Then th-they\nrented bicycles, and they drove to a waterway nearby, a few miles away. The waterway\nhad coves for swimmers, and the buoys, you know, that separate the waterway from the\ncoves were not -- weren\u2019t there, because there was a storm a coup -- few days before. So\na boat -- while Jimmy went swimming laps around the cove, a boat came in. There were -\n- there were other kids swimming, a little further, he may have been 20 yards, 10 yards, I\ndon\u2019t know, away from, cause you know, he was an a -- he was on the swimming team,\nas a matter of fact, at the University of Pennsylvania, so -- boat came in, he saw the boat\ncoming in, he took a dive. When he heard the boat passed, he came up, so that he didn\u2019t\nrealize that the skier -- the skier was a woman, she hit him in the head, and he -- he\ndrowned. They thought he took another dive. And the boat never stopped. And he\ndrowned. And you asked -- we had depositions, we asked the husband and wife. First of\nall, on that waterway, they had to sign a statement that they can be only in the waterway,\nthey cannot go into the coves. He violated that. Then, we were in a conference room, I\nwould say less wide than this room, about a little longer, but narrower. We\u2019re sitting at a\nconference table, and there was a -- a pic -- a painting on the wall. So my attorney asked\nher, because she was wearing thick glasses, \u201cCan you tell me what you see in this\npicture?\u201d She said no. \u201cOkay, are these reading glasses?\u201d She said, \u201cNo, these for\ndistance, and sum -- I can\u2019t read with them, they\u2019re mostly for distance.\u201d \u201cYou cannot\nidentify the picture?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cDid you wear these glasses while you were skiing, while\nyou on the skis?\u201d She says no. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wear the glasses?\u201d \u201cI would lose them,\nthey would fall off.\u201d She thought it was a dog swimming. She killed him, actually, you\nknow. And that\u2019s the story about.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: We press char -- we spent a fortune in legal fee, couldn\u2019t do it. They wouldn -- didn\u2019t\nwant to make a criminal case out of it, because they have too many cases for killing\npeople. Colorado\u2019s a funny state. You know the maximum you get for killing a young\nperson is only 10,000 dollars. We spent maybe 60,000 dollars in legal fees.\n[indecipherable] come there many times, and always they couldn\u2019t do anything. We even\nhad witnesses, you know, that -- we hired a detective to figure out -- our lawyers hired\none to -- the whole report, but didn\u2019t -- it was nothing. They say it was not intended -- the\n-- the intention was not to kill, but whatever. We couldn\u2019t -- we couldn\u2019t get -- there was\nno cooperation by -- even by the court. The ti -- 1t\u2019s an accident, they say. And the kids --\nhis cousin was standing in -- looking at where Jimmy was swimming, and so on, but he\ndidn\u2019t realize it, he\u2019s not going to come back. And the boats left, couldn\u2019t -- you know, it\ntook several days to find him, we had to hire -- we had -- it\u2019s very deep water there. We --\nwe had to rent a -- from California, the s -- a special -- what do you call it?\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Un-under the water, yeah, the boat, the -- pardon me?",
        "A: No, it\u2019s -- no, no, it\u2019s --",
        "A: It\u2019s a little -- small submarine, to find him. Took three days. And that\u2019s something we\ncan never, never talk to Eleanor about it, or the people ask how many children, and she\nbreaks down at times. [indecipherable] Yeah, doesn\u2019t want to -- she doesn\u2019t want to say\nwe have three, not four, so --",
        "A: Yeah, he s -- was such a wonderful, bright guy, sweet and --",
        "A: 20.",
        "A: Yeah. Strong. He was one of the best, one the best swimmers at the university. Even\nin -- even in high school, he loved swimming. Good athlete. But --",
        "A: They\u2019re wonderful, yeah.",
        "A: And Lauren 1s -- works -- she was married for a short time, she\u2019s divorced. She works\nin my office as an executive. And then I have Carol, and she 1s married. She\u2019s the\nyoungest, and sh-sh-she has three children, two boys and one girl, they just were visiting\nus here during school vacation. They just left this past Sunday, yeah. They have a boy of\n12, and a boy of 10, and a little girl of five. All lovely, beautiful children.",
        "A: We lived in Forest Hills. No --",
        "A: When I -- when I moved -- yeah, I lived in Brooklyn with --",
        "A: -- my brother, yes. I shared a room with one of my nephews for a few months. They\ndid want me -- I wanted to go to a hotel, but they felt it\u2019d be lonesome, so on, so I stay\nthere. But then I moved to a hotel, Saint George Hotel, in Brooklyn, was an old hotel.\nAnd subsequently, we moved to s -- we built a plant on Staten Island, so I moved to\nStaten Island, rented an apartment there. And then we got married, we moved to Forest\nHills. And we lived in Forest Hills for about five years. We got married in *52, and then\n\u00b057 we moved to Great Neck, we bought a house. And we still -- we don\u2019t have the house\nany more, we sold it in \u201979, so about 21 years ago, yeah. But we have an apartment in\nGreat Neck, yeah, and an apartment here.",
        "A: Palm Beach, yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Because we were told then that the Breaker\u2019s Hotel, 30 years ago, na -- maybe 25\nyears ago, actually did not permit Jews, you know? Some people say about 30 this -- but I\nremember 25 years ago, that was the case. I know even a person who wanted to check in\nwith his wife, they said no you -- you can\u2019t. Also, the people in -- if you went to stores,\nand so on, you look like you are -- you don\u2019t belong here. They gave that feeling. They\nwere not friendly.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have it as much, but people talked about it. Maybe I\u2019m more tolerant than\nothers, you know? And you just sense it. You know, wherever you went, it was -- they\ndidn\u2019t treat you politely. It was an -- little edge, you know? They didn\u2019t want Jewish\npeople to come to Palm Beach. Obviously it used to be, very -- almost no Jews. But as\nthe Jewish people came more and more s-successful, and so they -- they used to go to M-\nMiami, and the sometime Miami too busy, they came here. And now they say many of\nthe Gentiles moving out. They go more north, you know. Some of them, yeah. They don\u2019t\n-- that\u2019s the story. But we never were insulted by anybody, any -- but they were cold to\nus, you know? I didn\u2019t feel any particular pressure, but some people did.",
        "A: I think we became very active in the hospitals, two hos -- Saint Mary was the\nChristian hospital, and Good Samaritan was more like a private estate operated -- Jewish\npeople, I would say, made major contributions to the hospitals. And eventually the two\nhospital merge. Many Jewish doctors came from -- from New York, or wherever.\nChicago, and so on. And Christians. The hospitals became much more staffed better.\nThey bought equipment, you know. Here, you need a major operation, you couldn\u2019t --\nyou had to go to Miami or New York, or wherever else. Now, the hospitals are very well\nstaffed, very good medical research they\u2019re doing, and they are connected with New\nEngland Hospital, in Massachusetts someplace, and also Mount Sinai, New York.\nVideotape -- they can videotape operations, and there -- there\u2019s a big, big, big change.\nPeople, when they took sick, they used to go to their hometown, back to their own doctor.\nNow, they don\u2019t do it. Plus, we also helped building the Kravitz Center, which 1s a -- a\nplace where they -- they have operas, and they have shows, and -- and all that, and I -- I\nthink it was mostly Christian and Jewish, but a big -- I -- I -- I would say at le -- more\nthan half the money came from Jewish people. There\u2019s a little more -- more culture. I\nwould say they contributed money to the -- to small museums, and s -- and now the Jews,\nand the Gentiles work together in all these places, so it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a very good relation. Once\na year they have a ball for the -- for the hospital, you know? You have -- we have many\nfine Christians, and fine Jewish people meet, and also the Kravitz Center, they meet, have\nspecial gala nights, you know? So at least once, or more than once a year, different artists\ncome from all over -- from all over the -- the country, and -- and Europe. The Moscow\norchestra recently, and the -- some French theater -- what do they call, I forget -- artist\nperforming, and so on.",
        "A: [indecipherable] Christian and Jews. She was the -- the first person, with a few other,\nwith some Gentile friends, to start this organization, and sh -- and she was the education\nchairman. She knows a lot about Holocaust, and about general inter-religious, you know,\ndifferences. And so she\u2019s very, very knowledgeable, and she served for a couple years in\nthe -- they wanted her to stay. I discouraged her from staying long, I said, \u201cGive\nsomebody else a chance,\u201d and -- and so on. [indecipherable] felt very dominating, you\nknow? So the one attorney took over, [indecipherable] or Brian, what is it? I can\u2019t\nremember his name, he\u2019s very good, but he also, after two years, he starts his third one\nnow. Christian, lovely -- they all -- tell you a -- I find it may be my -- I -- I hope I\u2019m not\nwrong, I find the -- the educated people relate more, cause the Jewish educated people,\nyeah, they have something in -- in common. The uneducated are -- are more hateful, for\nsome reason, on Jews, I don\u2019t know. Ignorance. And that probably is everywhere. They\ndon\u2019t understand that we -- we are people, we are good and bad in every religion, every\nrace, I find they have good and bad people. People who contribute to society, and people\nwho don\u2019t. People who try to make it a wor -- a better world, and people who don\u2019t care,\nor obstruct. But that\u2019s society, that\u2019s -- who knows how many years this will take, how\nmany generations, you know, for this to improve and vanish? We all want a better --\nbetter -- better world for our children, grandchildren, and so on.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right.",

It was not just imaginary, it was 100\npercent dream, that I was -- I -- if your may -- shall I repeat the story, or you know the\nstory?",
        "A: I will brief -- Pll make it brief.",
        "A: In my dream was a I-lady who was a neighbor of ours. She was childless, and she,\nwhen I was young, as a child, maybe even when I was seven, six, seven, she always liked\nto play with me, and see what I\u2019ve done in school, you know, she wa -- she was like my\nsecond mother. She was -- she just li -- we were next door neighbors. I woke -- and she\n[indecipherable] she called me Nockmush. My name was Nochman, my Hebrew name,\nand she called me Nockmush, you know? \u201cNockmush, Nockmush, don\u2019t go there. Don\u2019t\ngo. Listen to me, don\u2019t go,\u201d she told me. \u201cDon\u2019t go to meet these people.\u201d She told me\nseveral times. I woke up. I was suppo-posed to meet these two individuals. I was -- I was\n-- | don\u2019t know what to do. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d I didn\u2019t go, and these two guys, one\nwas Christian, one was Jewish, they -- they had all people getting out of -- from Poland,\nyoung people, military age. They -- they must have bribed some Italian who were in\ncharge of -- they went by -- in Krakow they used to stop, for some reason or another. So\nwhat they would do, they would get uniforms, and bandaged up, let\u2019s say like -- a guy\nlike me, they put [indecipherable] bandaged up, and make believe you can\u2019t talk. They\nput you on the train, you know? Take drove you up there, put you on the train, and you\ncan\u2019t [indecipherable]. That\u2019s what I -- my parents and my brother felt, let somebody at\nleast get out, so they -- maybe you\u2019ll be able to get in touch with Arthur in the United\nStates, and so on. Something -- do something. But I didn\u2019t go. So, now I lived in Italy,\nand after I was there maybe a year, I had a very strong desire to go back to Poland. And --\nand my brother Maurice, too. He di -- I was hesitating a little bit, for one reason, but he\ndefinitely wanted to go. I wanted -- what we wanted to do is, we wanted to -- we -- we\nmarked up where they shot my father, and they -- they left him there, and then we buried\nhim. We -- we measured how f -- how many feet from that tree to this tree, to this\nlocation, that location. And there were two other men [indecipherable] put them in that\nburial place, not just -- so my father came to me, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t come. I -- we were all\nburned, you won\u2019t find any -- you won\u2019t find any ashes even.\u201d All burned. What they did,\nthey excavated men from wher-wherever they were buried, and they put them 1n fa -- put\nthem in one group, and burned them. So I don\u2019t want -- the other reason I didn\u2019t want to\ngo, right after the war, I le -- I learned in Munich, if you go back to Poland, they draft you\n-- if you -- in the 20\u2019s, you know, from 19 to 28, or to 30, I don\u2019t remember exactly. They\ndraft you in the Russian army, they put you. So I was that time 22 years old, so I didn\u2019t\nwant to go. That\u2019s one of the reasons why I never went back to Poland. I don\u2019t want to go\nin the ar -- in the Russian army after all this. And my brother felt -- he\u2019s nine years older,\nhe -- he -- him they don\u2019t want to draft. He looked a little frail, too, that time. He -- they\nprobably wouldn\u2019t ha -- but I -- I -- I felt pretty -- for all that I -- pretty healthy.",
        "A: No. These two [indecipherable] these are the only two. I believe there 1s something to\ndo it. I have other dreams, similar, not -- not as strong. I -- because I don\u2019t even\nremember. I know I had certain dreams, but I don\u2019t remember them. My sisters came to\nme [indecipherable] like -- like not -- I would see my mother or my father in my sleep,\njust like 1t was, you know, 50 years ago. But they don\u2019t usually talk to me.",
        "A: Yeah. But this, actually were words. I -- I\u2019m convinced something must be\nsuperhuman, to -- to -- to have -- to witness that, to experience that. But it happened.\nMaybe somebody\u2019s watching over me.",
        "A: It came in my dream. He came and told me that they burned all of me, and the two\nothers.",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s right. When my brother-in-law came to Italy then, subsequently, I ask him,\ndid you -- because he returned to Poland, and he was not of military age. And he stayed\nin Poland for maybe a year, or less. At least six months to a year. And I -- we ask him,\ndid you go to -- because he was with us in that brush factory, you know, the -- and he saw\nwhen they took my brother out and two of his, you know, friends. Whoever buried him,\nhe was part of it. Did he ever go back to Plaszow to see about our father, you know? He\nsaid, \u201cYes, I went several times. I found out they ex -- they excavated everybody, and\nthey burned them.\u201d The whole -- they -- when they liquidated Plaszow, before the\nRussian came, there were couple hundred people to clean up. Course, what they did there,\nI -- I think they -- they killed tens of thousand of people there, from med -- I -- I would\nsay mostly Gentile. They brought in from outside the camp. I don\u2019t know for what\ncharges, whether -- they mostly young people. They were -- they brought them on open\ntrucks, because they -- they brought it up to a hill there. And what -- what they did is they\nbeat them, and they had to undress, and they were all -- they -- during the day, they --\nevery -- they were excavating trenches, you know? Maybe a hundred people excavating\nthe -- prepare for loads, and then they buried them, covered them up. So that wa -- they\nexcavated the -- again, and burned them, you know? That\u2019s what I was told by my\nbrother-in-law, yeah.",
        "A: He believed it was true. Because the fact is, that two people were killed. He said,\n\u201cYou -- you -- you were told, you were gi -- were given a warning by -- how to explain\nthat?\u201d Believe in -- believe in God, or -- or -- or some superpower? I -- We don\u2019t know. If\n-- if you\u2019re religious, it\u2019s a message from God, if it\u2019s -- or, they can explain it many other\nway. I don\u2019t know. I would say if -- after the war, I did not believe in God. It took me a\nnumber of years, and I do believe in God. But can I prove things? Of course not. Certain\nthings, but it\u2019s -- but you have to accept it. Eleanor, not having all this experience, she\ndoesn\u2019t believe much in God. She says why -- especially since we lost Jimmy. Says why,\nwhy, why, was such a wonderful boy. We -- we all did things -- right things, and so on.\nAnd -- and I suffered so much, and [indecipherable] you know? So it\u2019s hard to -- I -- I\nkeep telling her I don\u2019t want to hear that, that she shouldn\u2019t discuss it. I believe in it. Why\nI believe in it, I don\u2019t know. Just -- I feel it\u2019s easier maybe on your -- on your mind, and\nyour spirit to believe than not to believe. Because otherwise it -- the whole thing is\nnothing.",
        "A: I love the work that I do. I really do. I like to build buildings. The reason I like it is I\nsee in front of my eyes, take a piece of land that nothing [indecipherable] mud or grass,\nand -- and you build something that is pretty, that people want, and people are happier,\nyou know? Whatever we build, one the biggest pr-pr-prize 1s revenue. I -- only the best\nthat can be done. It\u2019s my nature, and I like to play golf, but I not -- only on weekends, I\nplay golf. And I swim, walk, you know, when I have time. I have a treadmill here. I don\u2019t\n-- | walk more on the treadmill. And I am in good shape. I got -- except for hearing.

I used to\nhave b-big problem with my hands, I couldn\u2019t, I'd say, I could never hold even a cup of\ncoffee or tea, had to hold with both hands. But I was talking to my fingers not to bother\nme.",
        "A: I really said, \u201cGive me a break, don\u2019t bother me.\u201d I used to soak in hot water, in the\nmorning, and at night, you know, that what I -- and massage it, all this.
