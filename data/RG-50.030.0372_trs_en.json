        "Q: Dora, I'd like you to begin by telling me your full name, your date of birth, and where you\nwere born.",
        "A: My name is Dora Kramen Dimitro. I was born in Ashoshok (ph), Poland at that time, in\nJanuary 22, 1922. My father's name was Hierr (ph) Shavival (ph), my mother's name was\nIbella (ph). I was born in Ashoshok (ph) and raised there until the war, I was staying there.\nThen when the war start.",
        "Q: Let's talk a little bit about your family life, your memories before the war, what was it like\nliving in Ashoshok (ph)?",
        "A: The town was a small town but we had a big family from both sides, from my mother's side\nand from my father's side. We was very devoted to each other and personally, my own\nfamily, my mother was born, there was four children, one boy and three girls. My father was\na tailor, he used to work in the house and we had a nice life, a quiet life. We enjoyed our life\nand this was all a part of, I went to school when I was six years old, with my sister Pegilla\n(ph), we went to Wonklis (ph) and we went to a Hebrew school and we went to a Polish\nschool. I learned Polish, I had seven grades, Polish language, and then Hebrew I learned too.\nWhen I finished the seven class school, public school, there wasn't high school 1n this time,\nwe had to go in a bigger town, like to Vilna, this was the nearest town near Ashoshok (ph).\nBut we couldn't afford all this, to go there. After a little while, that was not really, I finished\n36 or 37, I don't remember exactly, this school. And I used to help my father, I learned how\nto sew, and then the war start.",
        "Q: Do you have fond memories of living in this small town?",
        "A: Yes, we belonged to organizations they used to call Betar (ph) and we used to come all the\nyoung people, there was dancing there, and we have a nice time.",
        "Q: What was the overall focus of Betar, why did you join it?",
        "A: This what we planned to go someday to Israel. This was our organization what was working\nfor Israel and we were planning someday to go there. That's why we belonged, and we used\nto come the young people, we used to come in one place, singing and dancing and that's all.\nThis was the all the entertainment what we had there. Sometimes we used to have movies.\nThey used to come from another town and we used to see a picture.",
        "A: The organization though is politically oriented, did they teach you certain things?",
        "A: Yeah, they used to talk about this all the time, to teach us about Israel, what kind of life is\nthere, how it's going on.",
        "Q: I know that the lifestyle there was very different than the lifestyle here so I'm trying to get a\nsense of, I'm trying to picture it, maybe you can help me.",
        "A: Well it was much, how can I say, it's much different how they're raising here the youngsters\nand by us. It was a family, a big family lay, we used to do everything by ourselves, you\nknow because my mother didn't have too much time. There you have to shop and cook and\nclean, everything by yourself, to take care for yourself. When we grow up, we use to, like\nteenagers we used to help the mother, everything in the house. We used to cook, it's not like\nhere, you go out and you buy ready whatever you want, too lazy to cook, you don't want to\nshop, you don't want to cook, you don't want to clean, you're doing something, you're idling\nsomebody, but this wasn't by us, this was complicated. We had to do everything by ourselves\nand let's say 1t used to come, here whatever they want, whatever they need, they're going\nshopping for clothes. We used to have clothes only on the holidays twice a year. Whatever\nwe need, shoes, a dress, a coat. Not really like things what people buying here, let's be, lay\nthere, for occasions, no such a thing this occasions. This is the way. When I went to school I\nhad a uniform, you know what I used to where everytime to school, when I used to come at\nhome I used to change for our plain dress. Maybe I had three or four dresses, that's all. We\ndidn't wear pants or sneakers or something like this. Very plain. But with the food, we had\nour own home, we had a garden we used to plant, you know, like potatoes, onions,\ncucumbers, everything we had for ourself. This was the life but we were very happy. We had\na family, we enjoyed this. We used to go on Shabbos (ph), we used to go to a temple, not a\ntemple, a congregation, a Shabbos (ph) type. And it was a very religious place, orthodox\nplace, we didn't know no other things. We enjoy our lives, I miss the life. Used to come in\nthe Shabbos (ph), Friday night, we had our dinner Friday Shabbos (ph), you know, the whole\nfamily used to sit around the table and we enjoyed the meal, with playing, with everything. It\nwas wonderful. I wish this wouldn't happen. Alright, people are dying, they wouldn't be alive\nalready by this time but still the years what we spent for the Holocaust in the woods, all over,\nin the ghettos, people had a life, they could live with their parents, they could live with their\nfamily to enjoy. When I got married we didn't have nobody, no mother, no father. When I\ngave birth to my children, nobody was with me like I was with my daughter. Sorry. My\nhusband is coming.",
        "Q: Why don't we stop to take a moment. I'm not sure you mentioned how many brothers and\nsisters you had.",
        "A: I had one brother, he was the oldest, and we was three sisters, that's all, this was our whole\nfamily. Then I had uncles, aunts, they had children, a lot of them, from both sides. I can't\neven remember exactly how many there was, but they can't think about this, to tell you 1f you\nneeded exactly the amount, no. Then the community was most a Jewish community and it\nwas very nice, the people. We was living like a quiet life in the community. When I went to\nthe Polish school, there was anti semites, there was. They used to say all the time to us, go to\nPalestine, at that time it wasn't Israel it was Palestine. Every Jew should go to Palestine, not\nto stay here. Naturally they used to come with sandwiches, they used to come with non\nkosher food, so they wanted all the time, we should taste their food, and they knew that we're\nnot allowed. They always start with us, you know, about this. They used to teach on\nSaturdays too. The Jewish people, the Jewish girls and the boys, we didn't go there. We used\nto take by them the lessons after, you know, on Sunday. Sunday was off for everybody but\nnot for us. We used to keep Saturday all the time. That was the life. We had our Saturdays all\nthe time, everything was closed by us, we didn't cook, we didn't clean, we didn't work all\nday, we didn't do nothing, this was a quiet day. Naturally we didn't have no telephones, no\nair conditions, no nothing, nothing at all, so it wasn't, to disconnect something or prepare, it\nwas prepared. We cooked for Saturday, we didn't warm up, we didn't do nothing, just a quiet\nday, just the men, just everybody used to go the synagogue to play and doing nothing. At\nnight after Shabbos, we used to go , like in the days when it was nice we used to\ngo walking and like this we used to come to a warm place, everybody, like the organizations,\nwe used to come and to sing and to dance, that's all, this was life. We used to go to school,\nnaturally to make homework so the days in the middle of the week, it was occupied, we\ndidn't do nothing. Only on Sunday, so Sunday we used to work, we used to do things in the\nhouse to help the parents, to help do things. This was the look of the life, can't compare here.\nFirst of all this was 50 years ago, more than 50 years. So everything was not everything\ngoes, like medication, everything goes ahead, at that time they didn't know nothing. Who\nknew about hearts, about heart attacks, about the applications. A person died, he died, we\ndidn't know from what or when. You see it was one hospital in town and one doctor, and this\ndoctor was on everything. So you can imagine what kind of life it was, but we were healthy,\neverybody was healthy. And we used to eat everything, whatever it was. You couldn't pick.\nAnd that's all, that was the life, until the war start.",
        "Q: Did you have Polish friends, did your family have contact with Polish people?",
        "A: Yes. It used to, first of all we had school. We had to get the homework for Saturday to\nprepare for Monday. So we was with them, in contact. They used to live, they were all\nneighbors, not far from us. And the parents, my father used to make work for the people, for\nthe Polish people, so he knew them, a lot of them. In fact, when the war start, we used to hire\nby them, a few of them, it wasn't too many.",
        "Q: So you had decent relationships?",
        "A: Yes, yes, I wouldn't say no, yes. They used to come, every place was like a market, they used\nto come, the Polish people, to sell things like eggs, butter, cheeses, food, all kinds of things\nand we used to buy from them, a lot of things.",
        "Q: So you weren't afraid of them?",
        "A: No, no, no. We used to live with them fairly, you know, I would say, close with them.",
        "Q: One more question, do you remember, certain things your parents taught you, values, or\nwhen you were being abused in school, what did they teach you, how did they help you?",
        "A: Well it wasn't really abuse like in the school, they never talked about it, they never talked\nabout it. In the beginning we was going to a Hebrew school, so it was only Jewish people,\nyou know, and they teach us with everybody. But then when I went to the Polish school, they\nwas nice too, the Polish teachers, they were nice. They didn't never see the difference\nbetween a Jew or a Polish student, we was the same by them. What else?",
        "Q: I was just wondering if there was anything you could remember that really stuck with you in\nterms of things your parents taught you?",
        "A: I don't remember such a thing, only one thing when we used to go out let's say, they used to\nsay, \"you are coming and this and this time you have to be home, not later\". If we have to\ncome home sometimes later, they used to take off the shoes, they shouldn't here, we open up\nthe door and then we walk in there. Otherwise everything was, whatever they used to say, it\nwas dinner Shabbos, we have to be by the table, the whole family. You never can say, \"no\",\nto them, or \"I wanted to do this\", or \"I wanted to come late\", or \"I want to do this or that\".",
        "Q: Were you a good kid?",
        "A: I would say, not a bad. I used to listen to the parents, whatever they used to say, and I did\nwhatever they used to say. It wasn't broke by us, it wasn't such a thing, like to move out from\nthe house when you are a teenager, or are growing up. You move out from the house when\nyou got married. So this way also, we used to live together in one place.",
        "Q: Now when did life begin to change for you?",
        "A: When the war start, what kind of changes could be?",
        "Q: Up until that point, had you heard about what was going on in Germany, did you know who\nHitler was?",
        "A: Yeah, we find out when it start in Germany in 1939, we knew already that he's killing, that\nhe's doing things, but we couldn't believe, why you should come to us to do this, why? What\nwe did to him? Why you should do this? Then when they start to come in, you know, the\npeople from Germany, they pass by our town and they told us, but still we couldn't believe,\ntill they came to us and it start, the killing. When we saw with our eyes, why you should do\nthis? Why? What we did wrong in our lives? Why he's going to kill the small children, the\nlittle babies and they didn't grow up? Why\u201d Till the last minute, till they start to kill, we saw\nwhat he's going to do. And he said to the people that when they start to take out, for\nAshoshok (ph), for the men, and they did the graves for themselves, and they said to us, to\nthe women, to the children, that he's taking them at war, really he did the nice war. They dig\nthe graves for themselves, so they lied to us, we didn't, we couldn't believe. Then when they\nkilled everybody in Ashoshok (ph), and it was left very little people, when we went to\nLondon.",
        "Q: Okay, I need to stop you because I think we're jumping ahead a little bit. You say, \"when the\nwar started in 1939\". Initially the Germans didn't come in, did they, first didn't you go under\nRussian?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay, maybe you can tell me a little bit what happened and how your life maybe was\ndifferent with the Russians.",
        "A: Well first of all, the Russians came and whatever they saw by us, they was wondering, like\nthings what we had, they didn't had. They had a miserable life too, there in the Russia. You\nknow, they belonged to the government, they wasn't like a boss for himself, for themselves.\nThey're working for them, and whatever they used to give him, clothes, to eat, they had to do\nthis. And when they came to us everything was, we had, you know, normal life, they was\nwondering. They start to buy and to take things what they didn't have, like watches, they\ndidn't saw. We did not buy ourself really expensive things. But they changed first of all the\nlanguage, we didn't know. My father knew, he was in the first war in 1914, he was at the\nwar, so he knew how to speak Russia, French. Of course, he was with those people there so\nhe spoke to them, he used to do things for them. Really we didn't have, we couldn't go like to\nbuy things what we want, not food, not like we had for the Polish people. Really for the\nPolish people, we was our own boss. My father worked in the house and everything we had\nfor ourselves. And they changed all that, they took over everything. All the, you know, the\nstores, we didn't have no more stores for ourselves, they took all that. So this was a lot of\nchange.",
        "Q: Did your father continue his work?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did they allow you to go to synagogue?",
        "A: Yeah, the first time, yeah. We didn't know about this in the first time. But later on, later on\nwe found out that it's going to go down everything for them. In fact, some people, they was\nafraid, I mean whoever had, by them, maybe you know about this, about communism by\nthem. This means they belonged to the government, they couldn't say about something about\nthe government or something for themselves, nothing. This was like they were occupied,\nthey were like in a jail. So we didn't feel comfortable to live and I almost felt like this, but we\nhad to get used to it. They put up, right away they made the stores should belong, they took\nfrom the owners and that they belonged to the government, everything, and they put up their\nown people to work. So it was different but we had to get used to it, to this life. It wasn't that\nfor long.",
        "A: Did you have to learn Russian?",
        "Q: I haven't got the time for this, but soon the Germans came.",
        "A: Do you remember what happened when the Germans came, can you describe that to me?",
        "A: What happened? Before they occupied our town, we weren't, like the killing, the shouting,\nand then they came on the motorcycles in our town. We was very scared, we was all of us\nwas in the houses, we was afraid to go out. They came and they start to talk I think, in\nGerman. My father understood German. It's a little bit similar to Yiddish. But not too much,\na little bit, you can understand what they are talking about. That it's going to be a normal life\nthey start to say, and we're all going to work together, everything is going to be alright. In\nfact my father worked for them for a little while, until they killed him. So when they, I don't\nremember, a few months later they started killing. We didn't have no ghetto at that time.",
        "Q: What was the life like in the interim, did they make you do certain things differently, were\nthere all kinds of new rules?",
        "A: I don't think so.",
        "Q: Did you have to walk on the street, did you have to wear a yellow star?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: That's what I'm trying to get.",
        "A: Yeah, we wore yellow stars so they should know who is a Jew, and we walked on the street\ntoo, not on the sidewalk, between the street and the sidewalk. This was different, because\nthey had to know that we are Jewish.",
        "Q: Were the schools closed? Were the synagogues closed?",
        "A: No, not at that time, no they didn't close yet.",
        "Q: And what about the local people, the Polish, Lithuanian, any of that?",
        "A: They start right away to put them to work with the Germans. They are brothers, they are not\nJews.",
        "Q: Let's stop and change the tape. When we begin I want you to tell me a little bit more about\nwhat your life was like when the Germans came in, and this is now we know as summer of\n1941. We're not starting yet, but also what year, before you knew Polish?",
        "A: Why you have to change?",
        "Q: He has to put in a new tape and then when you put in a new tape you have to set it up, the\nfirst one was over.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: I'm trying to get a sense of what your life was like when the Germans came in, how you\nspent your time, whether they were nasty, whether they treated you okay, whether people\nwere being beaten, if your former school friends or people you did business with, the Polish\npeople, did they still talk to you? What was it like?",
        "A: It was different. They try and, I mean they wasn't so friendly like it used to be, they knew\nabout this, that we're going to get killed, they knew about this. And all the time, before the\nwar they didn't want us, they send us to Palestine, especially now they want us to be killed.\nTo take away everything what we had, to get rid of us, to take our houses, to take the clothes,\nto take jewelry, to take everything. We had our jewelry to hide in a place 1n our house.\nBefore the war when they came they didn't find nothing. They dig it out. And they took away\neverything. They knew about this and they used to say, \"you're going to get killed anyway,\nthe Germans will kill you\". And they did, they knew about this. They hurried and they saw\nthe digging, when they dig the graves, they saw how they getting killed. We hide the knives.",
        "Q: And how did the Germans treat you, how did you spend your time in this few months?",
        "A: We didn't go no place, we were sitting home most of the time. We was afraid to go, to get\nkilled. They could kill us any place and any part of the day. Let's say, I walked, you would\nsay something to them, if they didn't like, they could kill you. Who could stop them, they\ncame for this. So what kind of life, we was happy that we had something to eat. The Polish\npeople they used to come and that time, in the morning was a change with everything. We\nused to give them something, you know, like a dress or material or something for food. We\nwas starving for food already, to survive, that was the life.",
        "Q: So some of the Polish people were sort of helping you?",
        "A: Yeah, they helped in some things, they brought food for us but it's not for nothing, we pay\nthem, it's not with money so we paid with something else, or with jewelry, or with\nsomething, clothes, stuff.",
        "Q: But they were also taking your things?",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah. When the Germans throwed us out from the houses, right away they took\neverything. They didn't take nothing what we could take.",
        "Q: Were people being beaten or killed on the streets during this time?",
        "A: Yeah, it was a few people they killed. It was one person alive, homeless person, so they\nkilled him right away. And this what I remember. Maybe they killed other people too. But it\nwasn't already interested to find out because we were thinking about our lifes, that we're\ngoing to get killed soon. So it wasn't to ask who was killed or who was going to get killed\nbecause I was, we was already on the line to get killed.",
        "Q: Do you remember what your family talked about, if you had any plans?",
        "A: What kind plans? Not lives at all. We was thinking only that they were going to make a\nghetto and we were going to be in ghetto, but by us it was not ghetto, nght away they killed\nthe people. Like we went later to Radun and we was there living for ten months so we was\nliving there in ghetto but not like by us. We was the first one to kill. I don't know why this\nhappened right away, I have no idea.",
        "Q: Tell me what happened.",
        "A: What happened in Ashoshok (ph) you want? When they throwed us out from the house, my\nolder sister, this one which was alive, she was alive at that time, it was before the holidays,\nshe was married shortly, and she went with her husband to his parents there for the holidays,\nSO we was home, me and my sister and my mother, my father. My father went away because\neverybody said that, \"they going to take the men, first the men, and the women, we'll see\nwhat's going to be later\". So he went away and he wasn't with us together so I was only with\nmy mother, with my sister, the younger one. And then came my husband, he was my\nboyfriend there, he was from the same town. He came and the Lithuanians with the, together\nwith the Germans, they throwed us out and they took us, they beat up my mother because\nshe wanted to take something, I don't remember, and we went there to the synagogue. From\nthe other street was my mother's family, we met them all that day there in the synagogue, we\nwas all together, we was there for two days I think, two days and two nights. They took a lot\nof people from our end of town, this calls Alkinique (ph), if you need the name, I don't think\nso, if you need the name, came people too, and we were all brought together until they took\nus on the big place, you know, on the marketplace, and from there they started shooting. So\nfirst they took the men, again, all the men, and they said that they taking them to work but\nmy father wasn't there, so they took all the men and they killed them, naturally. Then they\ncame for the women, it was like afternoon, late afternoon, and they took us all and they put\nus 1n parts, like I was with my mother, with my sister, with my grandmother, with my aunt. I\nhad three or four aunts. And soon we was starting to walk already, came this\nman, the Lithuanian man. He was a policeman. He came over to me, my husband, he wasn't\nmy husband that time, he took him also from the line from the men and he made sure that he\nkilled him. He said that he's taking him to kill him, and he let him go. So before he said to\nhim, take my girl. So he knew me because he used to come to my father, he used to do work\nfor him. So he took, because I'd be from my head, and he said, \"what are you doing here,\ncome with me\". And he took me out and he put me again on the place, on the marketplace,\nand he said to me, \"soon it's going to get dark, go away, run away from here, go wherever\nyou want to go\". He said, \"your boyfriend went away to Aladarin (ph), go also\". So when it\nwas dark, and they went away and they killed them. The whole family. So I didn't have\nnobody from my family, I took one girl, a neighbor girl, and she went with me. She left with\nher sister, mother, but then they went away too, at night. So we was walking the whole night\nand we came back to the same time. Instead to go there to Radun, we came back to\nAshoshok (ph). So one Pollack was walking in a field, you know. So I came to him and I\nsaid, \"where to go\", and he said, \"where are you going, they killed everybody in Ashoshok\n(ph), why are you going there back\"? I said, \"I don't know where to go\". He said, \"go to this\narea, go to that area\". So I was walking, both of us, and we came to Radun, we came to my\nsister there where she was. What I could do? What we can do? Always sit and play and clap,\nwe lost that. Oh god. Then my father came there, we met him, and we was all together for\nthe ten months.",

        "Q: The Polish army.",
        "A: Yes. Then he was, the Polish army was nothing for them, so the Germans, the Germans took\nhim to Germany to our concentration camp and he was there, we was survived, he was\nliberated by the English army.",
        "Q: At the time of this massacre, you were hiding, did you hear the shots or anything?",
        "A: In Ashoshok (ph)? No, we wasn't hiding, we was on the market, we hide everything, where\nwe could go? We couldn't go no place, and we didn't know what was going on. It was so\nstupid to believe them, that they are working. You understand, we couldn't believe that they\nwere going to kill us. Till they killed, till they killed ,",
        "Q: Who were the people responsible, were they Germans, were they Lithuanians?",
        "A: They was working together. The Lithuanians, they helped them. The Germans was maybe\ntwo or three people all together for them. But the rest was the Lithuanians, and they was very\nbad, very bad people.",

        "A: The Pollacks, yes, yes. Some of them, they was working together with them too.",
        "Q: And when the women were all shot, could you hear the noises and everything?",
        "A: No, I didn't hear nothing and I didn't understand nothing that time. You know, like I was, I\ndon't know from where, from another world.",

        "Q: Now maybe you can tell me about what was happening in Radun?",
        "A: Well in Radun, we, what we did, we didn't do nothing, well the men they used to go to work\nfor the Germans, but there was a ghetto. And some of the women they used to take to work\ntoo. I didn't work, no. Then after ten months, somebody told us that this and this night, they\nwere going to start to kill the people. They were going to close up the ghetto, altogether, and\nthey were going to start to kill. So we knew about this already and at night, at night we run\naway.",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little bit about life in the ghetto in Radun, the conditions? One second.",
        "A: Well it was, how can I told you. We was one, two.",
        "Q: If you can tell me a little bit about life in the ghetto, what the conditions?",
        "A: Well there was four families in one house, and the house had I think, one bedroom or two\nbedrooms. We were sleeping on the floors, we were sleeping, you know, we was cooking\ntogether. It was terrible, but we were happy that we are alive. Who thought about us, who\nthink about this, that I haven't got what to eat, or it's not comfortable, or to wash ourself, to\ntake a shower. What kind of showers? What kind of baths? We washed up and that's all in\nour part, and that's it. We was happy with this what we had. As long as giving us life, we had\nthe life. It's not going to happen like in Ashoshok (ph), right away to kill. You see, we had\ntime a little bit here, to think about things. We knew about this, that they were going to kill\nhere too, but we had no choice. As long they give us life here, so we lived here, where is to\ngo? We had no place where to go. In the woods? How can you live in the woods at night, in\nday? I mean when it's cold, it's raining. We lived there, we lived like this, we went through\nthis. So we had no choice, we had to live, till it came the time when we find out that it's\ngoing to make like he was doing, he did in Ashoshok (ph), so that time we ran away. We ran\naway, our family, what there was. My father, my sister with a husband, me, my boyfriend.\nAnd we ran away, that's all. We went away to the woods and we was by Pollacks. And then\nwe came back to Radun, it's still got left a few. But we wasn't there, we was afraid to stay\nthere. And we want to hide, some day by one Pollack, by another, whoever want to keep us,\nwe stay there. We didn't have nothing, we were suffering very much. Not to have to eat, not\nto have where to sleep, so when it was warm, like in the summer time, it was okay. We was\nin the woods. We hide by the Polish people, you know, where they used to keep the horses,\nthe cows, we used to. They used to not see us, we used to come at night and go away at\nnight, otherwise they wouldn't let us stay, they were afraid, but they used to keep people too,\nwhoever paid them, whoever had a lot of money, you know, like gold. They used to take\nonly gold. So one family got killed too, they, the Pollacks killed them. He thought about this,\nwhy you have to keep them and to give them the food and to think maybe the Germans will\ncome and they will kill me, so he killed the whole family, took away everything what they\nhad, the gold, everything. And he buried them. This was a family from our town, from\nAshoshok (ph), so we was afraid too, to stay by them. But sometimes we had no choice, we\nhad to, in the winter time, what to do in the winter time? We had no clothes, we had nothing.\nBut we used to go, the men used to go to the Polish people wherever we knew them, they\nused to ask for a coat, something to wear and something to eat, they used to give us to eat,\nbecause they was afraid. They could burn him too, they did for them what they did for the\nGermans, did to us. Or what they did to us, they could do this. What we got to lose? Our life\nwas ending anyway, every minute, every minute we was thinking, not that we was thinking,\nwe was already to kill. Like it was, we was hiding by one Pollack and he knew about this,\nthat we are there. So one day the Germans came there not far away from there, came over to\nus and he said, \"you have to leave right away, in the middle of the day\". If somebody will see\nus, right away they're going to kill us. But he said, \"you have to leave with no questions\". So\nwe went in the middle of the day, we was going, where to go? One side the Germans, there\nthe Pollacks, they were going to give us out. But we had no choice, to go. We went to the\nwoods, it was not far away.",
        "Q: Let's stop the tape.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: We stopped when we went...",
        "Q: I'll let you continue.",
        "A: We went to Radun and we was hiding every day in another place, it was a terrible time.\nNobody wants to keep us. They were afraid and they didn't want. We haven't got no money,\nwe haven't got no clothes, we haven't got nothing. So it was a very bad time, that was that\ntime. It wasn't so bad with hiding because it was warm. It was summer time because it was\nwhen we went out from Radun was in May, so we had the whole summer, so it wasn't bad,\nto stay in the woods, to go out then, like at night. But the most important was the winter,\nwhat to do for the winter, where to go, if we were going to be alive. And sure enough, we\ndecide, somebody told us, \"but in Grodno, they called the Third Reich (ph)\", that was the\nGermans called this, there the people are living a normal life, they are in the ghettos, but they\nare working and they are living in the houses, you know, they have a normal life. So we\nthought about this and we decided to go there.",
        "Q: How far was that?",
        "A: Far away. Far away from us. Like I would say from Radun to, I don't know exactly, I'd say\nlike to Washington, maybe, maybe farther away. But I can't tell you exactly, I don't know. If\nmy husband, he would tell you exactly. Well anyway, we decide to go there and so me, my\nhusband, he was a boyfriend that time, with my father, we went to Grodno, with his sister,\nmy husband's sister was with, because her husband was from Grodno. So he decided, and he\nsaid, \"we're going to go there\", and he had family there. My sister went with her husband to\nLida, it's a bigger town from Radun, they went there and we went there, so we decided like\nalso, it was in fall, fall we went there to Grodno, and we was there and warm from the\nghettos. So we was there, really they had a normal life.",
        "Q: How did you get there?",
        "A: Oh, we walked a lot. Then we went by, no taxis. The most by well we went from this town, I\ndon't know. Oh, we hired a horse with a Pollack, he took us for a short time, to another town\nwhat is nearer Grodno, so he took us there. We came there, we find another one and we\nwalked a lot, and that's how we came to Grodno.",
        "Q: What was Grodno like?",
        "A: What I saw in Grodno, I saw a little town, the ghetto, but 1t was a big town, it was a very big\ntown, in fact there was two ghettos, in one ghetto they couldn't put all the jews. So like let's\nsay, in the beginning of the town was a ghetto, and then nearer Tanko (ph), nearer Shull (ph),\nwas the other one. I never was in it, I was only in this one, in the one ghetto where we came,\nI was there all the time, with my father and then with mine boyfriend. He was mostly with\nhis sister, with the family, and we was put in a house also from the family, from their side.\nSo we was there for two months, I think, if not more a little bit, I can't give you exactly the\ntime, how long we was there. It was a good time, we had there not bad. The men, they used\nto go to work out of the ghetto, and the women, some women used to work for the Germans,\nbut I never went to work there by them, by the Germans. I was in ghetto, my father was too,\nhe didn't go to work. My boyfriend, he went, he used to go to work. And we had food, we\nhad where to sleep, alright we used to sleep on the floor because how many families in one\nhouse. But it wasn't bad, if he wouldn't start to shoot, to take it out. But there was different\nalready, there was the Jewish people was the, how they called. Well they used to organize, I\nmean with the people, to send them out to work, the Jewish people, like the Jewish\npolicemans, they had a name.",
        "Q: The Huguenots.",
        "A: Huguenot, right. They used to came to the Germans and ask them, we need so many and so\nmany people for work, so they used to send the people. Then when they start already, the\nliquidation in the ghetto, they used to come and they used to say, we need for today, 2000\npeople. And they used to take them to the gas chambers.",
        "Q: How did you know that?",
        "A: Well we find out. We knew about this. So we find places in the ghetto where they used to\nhide. They had like bunkers, you know bunker. So one day before we find out, when my\nboyfriend went to work, they took like seven or eight people and they didn't come back to\nthe ghetto, they run away. They run away to go to the woods. But there was far away from\nthe woods, the Grodno ghetto was far away, it's not like in Ashoshok (ph), so they run away,\nthey didn't come back. So we knew already that it's time. So I find out, a bunker, and I went\nwith my father, and some of them, they didn't let us go in because they had plenty people\nthere. So I said, you must let me. If I'm going to get killed, you're going to get killed too. So\nthey had no choice, we was one and another, a bunker, how big it was. So this was one night,\nthen it was a week later, again, the Huguenot, they came, and they had to give them the\npeople, how many they wanted. And this was going on for a few weeks. So one time, we\ndidn't go to the same bunker every day. One time I find out another place where they hiding,\nso I said to my father, we're not going to this place, it's like I felt like it's no good to go. I\nsaid, \"we're going to another place\". He said to me, \"what is the difference, what makes a\ndifference, a bunker is a bunker to hide someplace\". So we went, sure enough, everybody got\nkilled in this bunker.",
        "Q: Did they get killed by the local population, by the Nazis, do you know? Who?",
        "A: By the Nazis. And the local helped them too. They helped them a lot.",
        "Q: Were the Nazis inside the ghetto often?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. They used to stay in by the gate, there was a gate all around, you know, where\nthe people had to go to work, and where they had to come back. So there was one boy, a\nvery nice looking, very nice, beautiful looking boy. He came from work and they shot him\nwhen he had to come in, for no reason at all. You can talk to nobody, you can ask nobody\nwhy. Why is a crooked letter here, no questions. They took him, they killed him, that's it.",
        "Q: What about the Jewish police, were they good guys or bad guys?",
        "A: Well they thought that they were going to be alive, they were going to let them leave. So\nwhenever they had to take the people, you know, the people used to cry, nobody wants to go.\nWe knew already that they take them to the gas chambers, not like here, they kill them, you\nknow, right away in the graves. They took them there. But they didn't help, they wasn't so\ngood either. Well they was fighting for their own lives, but they were wrong, they kept them\ntill they need them. What they don't need they kill, they killed everybody. So then there came\nto a point when we was in Grodno, it was one morning, I was still sleeping, and my father\nwent out, he used to get up early in the morning. He came back, and I heard already the\nshots, already. He said to me, \"my daughter\", he said, \"my child, get dressed, they killing\nalready, on the streets, they don't take like, you know, like they used to take, they're killing\non the streets\". Get dressed, that's it, this was the last word for him, and when I saw him, I\nnever saw him again. He went out through the door, that's all. I got dressed and I went out,\nand I heard people out screaming, and the shots. So I figured, where shall I go, where to go?\nBefore the war, it was a big place like near there, and they used to keep bread, bread and\nbagels, all kinds of things in a big box, like a very big box, like this, a big box. So I saw the\nbox and I figured, I'm going to go in there. I went in without anything, it was cold already, it\nwas winter, fall. But in Europe comes winter very hard, it's not like here. And there is fall\nand winter. Here is winter, summer, there 1s no fall. So I went in without, just in a dress,\nwithout anything, and I was sitting there. I didn't know what to do, my brains didn't work\nalready. Where was my father, I didn't see him, nobody's there. I heard all those screams and\ncry, that's it. This was in the day time in the morning and this was going until it got a little\ndark, it got darker, it's came the night. And it was already quiet, so I figured, everybody got\nkilled. I was the only one. What I'm going to do there? What I'm going to do, without food,\nwithout clothes, where to go? I'm afraid to go in ghetto, I'm afraid to walk, they're going to\nkill me like everybody they killed. And it was so quiet, and I don't know where to turn. The\ntown is not familiar to me, it's not like Ashoshok (ph) or Radun, where I grow up. It's\neverything 1s to me like, I don't know nobody and I don't know where to go. But then it was\nstart to be already the day time, I was there a whole day and a whole night sitting. And I\nheard like somebody's crying, so I figure, I have to get up, go out anyway sometimes, I can't\nstay here all the time, till I die there? So I went out and I saw one woman and I said to ask,\n\"from where are you coming\"? She said, everybody got killed, nobody's there. \"What are\nyou doing here\"? \"I don't know myself\", she said. I said, \"you saw somebody, some Jews\"?\nShe said, \"they're in a house, I saw a few people, they're still alive\". I went there and I met\nthe people, I met a few there, a brother and a sister. I don't remember already, there was a\nbrother and a sister, and another couple. So I went to them and they said, \"When it's going to\nget dark, very dark at night, we're going to go in\", this was still in ghetto, \"we're going to go\nin outside to Livendore (ph), we were going to get dressed. So I got dressed there, I didn't\nhave nothing, without clothes, without shoes, without anything. I wore boots I find there, you\nknow, what the people that are not there already, with a coat, with a pocketbook. And I got\ndressed and they got dressed and we was waiting till 1t get dark, and as soon it get dark, we\nwas through the window, going 1n couples, you know. To go through the window, to go\noutside the ghetto, and to reach where to go. To go out from the ghetto, and to go out from\nthe town. So as soon, I think I got the third or the fourth, I don't remember exactly, and right\naway I got caught. I got caught, he was a policeman working for the Germans, a Pollack, a\nPolish man. And he said, \"I have to take you to the gestapo\". I said, \"why, why you have to\ntake me? They should kill me, why? What you going to have from this? Listen, I don't have\nnothing, just this what I have on me. I have the coat and I have the boots, and that's all what I\ngot\". I said, \"no money, no clothes, no nothing\". I'm going to leave\", I said, \"you know\nwhat's going on, maybe you did the same thing to them, but what you going to have for this?\nIf they're going to kill me, you going to have on your mind your whole life because you\npersonally took me there. When they took all of them, it's different than when you're taking\none person. I am still so young, what can I give you. If you want I can take off my boots to\ngive you, my coat, and let me go. Let me live, let me go, think about this\". So I don't know,\nmaybe, and I spoke rather nice Polish, and maybe he realized, I don't know, he had a pity on\nme, whatever. I don't know what to say. And Polish he said to me, \" \". This\nmeans, run away. \"Run away , quick, I shouldn't see you\". I start to run but then\nI figure it's no good to run, people going to think, it's going to be, maybe it's a Jew. I put ona\nkerchief, they shouldn't see right away, maybe. They recognized when I talked, they couldn't\nrecognize that I'm a Jewish girl. But you can think about this, you know, you never know,\nand there was very bad people, the Pollacks and the Germans, very bad. Right away, as soon\nas they saw a Jewish person, they give to the Germans, to the gestapo. And I was walking,\nand I don't know where I'm going, where I'm going, I'm still in the town. I have to leave the\ntown, it's night time. So I was going and it start like to snow a little bit, snowing. So I figured\nit's snowing, it's dark, maybe they wouldn't recognize me if I stop to talk to them, to ask\nthem. And I had idea how to go out from the town but I didn't know which way. So I stopped\none Polish woman and I asked her where to go to this place. She told me and I went there.\nAnd I went and I was walking a whole night not knowing where to go and where I'm going\nto go.",
        "Q: What happened to the other people who...",
        "A: They got killed. They all got killed, nobody was alive. I was the only one. There was, I think\nthree couples, yeah. I was the only one. I don't know why and I'll never know.",
        "Q: Did they get killed right there or were they taken to the gestapo?",
        "A: I don't know because I can't tell you because I left. I think not, they didn't got killed right\naway because I knew for myself because he wanted to take me, he didn't kill me right away.\nHe wanted to take me to the gestapo. So I figure that somebody took them too, to the\ngestapo. They didn't kill them right away, on the place. And then I was going and thinking to\nmyself, what to do? God, where shall I go? What to do? If to go to a Pollack, some on the\nway where I walk, they were going to kill me right away because there was bad people. I\ndidn't sleep, I was tired. I was hungry, I wanted to have a little bit water. Where to go, what\nto think. And I was thinking that where I was going, and this time I saw how far away I was,\nwith a slight, because there was snow already, it was winter. And there was going by the\nboth sides, two people, three people. So I was thinking, this can't be the Germans, this 1s all\nthe Pollacks, probably the Pollacks. But I had no choice, I had to go, I had to walk. And I see\nthey coming to me, they coming, they coming. So I took more the kerchief around my head\nand then they was so near to me, they stopped, and they stopped me. And they asking me,\nthey couldn't think that this was a Jewish girl, they thought maybe it's a Polish going from\none house to the other one, to somebody. And they said in Polish, they asking me \"where are\nyou going\"? So the other man came over and he said to me, called me my name. \"You're\nalive, you going from Grodno ghetto\"? So I said, \"yes\". They was going, they are the\npartisans, they had a rifle with them, they had two, in fact they had two rifles. And they were\ngoing to Grodno, to ghetto, to take out one person, they was going to take out his mother and\nthe sister.",
        "Q: I'll let you begin again. Do you have a sense of when this was in time? When this took place\nwhen you left?",
        "A: From Grodno ghetto? When? This was probably in the beginning of '43, early '43. Early '43\nand it was winter time, that makes sense.",
        "Q: I just have one other question before you continue. You told me that your boyfriend, the last\ntime you saw him he was leaving with a work group to go outside the ghetto. Did you know\nhis plans?",
        "A: I knew his plans, he told me from before. That they were planning on running away from\nwork, they were going to go out from ghetto, they were going to go to work, and from there\nthey were going to run away, to go to the partisans, to meet him, but it's a long way they\nhave to go. \"I don't know what you are going to do, try, try\". \"How, and when\", I said, \"I\ndon't know, this we're going to see\". I think that's all.",
        "Q: Alright, I'll let you continue your story. Met up with these people who were coming to find\ntheir family in Grodno, these partisans, yes?",
        "A: If I knew them?",
        "Q: No, you met up with them?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So I'll let you continue.",
        "A: They recognized me and then I recognized them because I had my head down, I was afraid\nto keep up my head and to look at them. And when they recognized me, then I pick up my\nhead and I saw them, and I recognized them too. And they ask me where I was going. They\nknew that I was in Grodno ghetto. I said, \"I don't know where I'm going, where you are\ngoing\"? They said, \"we was planning on going to the ghetto and take out my mother, my\nsister, and other people\". I said, \"It's no use to go to the ghetto, nobody's there already, I was\nprobably the last one\". So they figured, and one, a sister with a brother was with me, but they\nhad to, when I went out from the ghetto, there were two in the group with me, but where they\nare now, I said, \"I don't know, they probably went, they took them to the gestapo\". I had\nluck, I don't know how. I had this luck, what I'm now alive. So they recognized and they\nknew that I'm so tired and hungry.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "Q: Well I think when we stopped the tape you were talking about that, you told these people\ntheir family wasn't there. Let me ask you one question before we continue since we had to\nstop anyway. To your knowledge, when you said, \"nobody was in the ghetto anymore\", are\nyou talking about both of the ghettos in Grodno or just your ghetto?",
        "A: No, I'm talking about this ghetto where I was, I don't know nothing about the other ghetto,\nnothing at all.",
        "Q: Okay, I'll let you continue.",
        "A: So when I met the people, and they was going to the Grodno ghetto to take out the family. So\nI told them that I was probably the last one, I was with a sister and brother together, with\nthem, and they supposed to go also, to run away because in ghetto, nobody was left around,\nonly a few people, these people what I met, and I was lucky that I met them because\notherwise I wouldn't know where to turn and probably I would be killed, some place or in\nghetto, whatever. So I told them what happened with me, with this policeman, what he was\nworking for the gestapo and he wanted to take me. I told them the whole story and I said,\n\"they let me go\", and the rest ones, I said, \"they probably not out\". If they would be out from\nthere, if they would be alive, they would be on the same place where I start to walk, on the\nsame way, to walk I mean, on the same way. But nobody showed up. And then we heard that\nthe people there, the Pollacks, they was talking, that nobody's in ghetto already, and there 1s\nno ghetto. So we went with Pollack to a house and with them, they took me. They occupied\nlike the house, they didn't let nobody, they knew that these is partisans, they didn't let nobody\nto go out, whoever came, a neighbor or somebody, whoever came to the house, they let them\nin, but they didn't let them out. They supposed to stay till the night, till we're going to leave,\nthen they can leave. So the first thing what I had was food because I was hungry, for two\ndays and two nights I didn't eat. I didn't sleep, and they said, \"you got to sleep\", and they was\nstaying, you know, all the time watching. Because if they would let them out, we would be\nalready by the Germans, they would kill us.",
        "Q: What did they tell these neighbors, they told them you were there?",
        "A: Which neighbors? The neighbor, when they came in, one person came in so he saw already,\nhe knew who we were, that's all. They said to him, \"you sit down or lay down, do whatever\nyou want, but you're not opening up the door and you're not going out, until we're going to\nleave\". So sure enough, I went to sleep and they were standing the whole day watching if\nsomebody's coming, or the Germans, you never know. Alright, they didn't have no\ntelephones, they had no communication with them, what to do. They had to go by\nthemselves, you know, to tell that this and this happened and there is partisans, whatever.\nWhen it came at night we left from there, we left to go back, they didn't go already to the\nghetto because they heard from the Polish people too. We went to go to the woods, you\nknow, it wasn't so easy to go because on the way was like Germans standing and Pollacks. It\nwas a Separation between Grodno and the other towns. So they had to go all alone, they\nknew already, they were partisans, and they knew how to go and they took me, you know,\nthey were walking and I was on the sled with the horse. We walked a lot too. And the whole\nnight we was traveling like this, and when it start to be already, we was near the pusha (ph),\nnatcha (ph) pusha (ph), this is the name. A pusha (ph) means the woods there. We came\nthere and I met my boyfriend, my husband and I met other people, what I knew them,\neverybody what I knew, but they weren't in the Grodno ghetto.",
        "Q: Well that must have been a surprise to meet your boyfriend again.",
        "A: Well I knew, when I met these people they told me that he's there. So it started another life, a\nnew life. So we start there and it was winter time. They had already a place what they built\nby themselves, you know, a place for winter because winter time you can't go out, right away\nyou can see that people are walking in the woods and from the woods, and they had to\nprepare food. They prepared food and they prepared everything. And when it came, it was\nalready spring time. And we heard about, that the Germans, they are planning to look for the\npartisans in the pusha (ph), so we had to leave. We had to leave the hiding place, the bunker\nwhere we was all winter. We had to leave this and we went far away from there from this\nplace, but we went to the pusha (ph), to the natcha (ph) pusha (ph) for the\nwhere it's more like woods.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you a few questions about this. You were living in this bunker in the woods\nfor many months in the winter. You stayed inside all the time?",
        "A: Yes, most of the time, yeah.",
        "Q: Stop tape. I'm just trying to get a sense of what it was like in that bunker, what did you eat,\nwhat did people talk about, how did you occupy your minds, what were you thinking? How\ndid you live?",
        "A: It's hard to explain but in my own words I'll try to explain to you. Those people where they\nwere before me, they prepared for the winter, food. They prepared like potatoes, let's say,\nmeat. It was cold, you know, outside, freezing, snow up to here. So they prepared food\nbecause we couldn't go out, if we would go out, right away you can see the footsteps, you\nknow. That's why we was afraid to go out for something. We was living there, whatever we\nhad, it was okay, good, good enough. As long we can survive.",
        "Q: Did you cook in the bunker?",
        "A: Yeah, we cooked.",
        "Q: How big was it?",
        "A: It was very small, how can I?",
        "Q: How many people were in there?",
        "A: It was there, maybe 20 people, ten couples for sure.",
        "Q: Any children?",
        "A: No, no children.",
        "Q: Did you ever go up for air?",
        "A: At night we used to go out, but not far from the place, say near the place because we was\nafraid for the footsteps.",
        "Q: So even the men, everybody stayed inside for most of that time?",
        "A: Yes. At night we used to go out, to fresh up a little bit.",
        "Q: Go to the bathroom?",
        "A: What kind bathroom? The woods, we was living in the woods.",
        "Q: What did you talk about, how did you occupy yourselves?",
        "A: We talk about what to do later on. To go out, to go to the woods or to stay, what to do. We\ndidn't have to think about what to do, we did it, we have to leave the bunker, but it was\nalready spring time, it was nice. As soon as we find out that they are planning to search, to\nlook for us, for the partisans, we left the bunker and we went to the woods.",
        "Q: Did you know whether there were other groups of partisans nearby?",
        "A: There was another group partisans, there was what I told you, the men.",
        "Q: I need you to start that over, it was too noisy, please. Were there other partisans nearby?",
        "A: Yes. This was the other group, without women, only men. And there was Russian people\ntoo. Russian and our people. But they knew too, about us. They had a lot of guns and rifles,\nthose people. We had too, but very little, you know. So they went too, there to the pusha\n(ph), the same thing. But what they did, the Germans, they had other plans to look over, and\nthen they had like a chain like, you know, a lot of Germans with Pollacks, with Lithuanians,\nall of them. And they used to go through the pusha (ph) to find, to look for the people, to\nlook for us. We had no choice where to go. We was sitting near, it was woods, a lot, very\nclose one to another. We was sitting there, me, my husband, my boyfriend that's my\nhusband, my sister, and my brother-in-law. We were sitting like from one side and from the\nother side was another group, three people. Woman with a husband, with a sister. Three\npeople. And we heard that the Germans are there, and they killed them, and we were sitting\nhere. It was like now, I'm talking like an electric storm goes through my body and we was\nonly praying, God help us. They got killed and they went away. They figure that no more is\nin this side, they went, they killed a lot of people that time.",
        "Q: How did your sister, how did you reconnect with your sister, how did she get there?",
        "A: Well she came also, she came also from Lida ghetto, have you heard of Lida? She came\nthere too to the partisan. Yeah. You ask me how my sister came? So she came also from,\nsomebody took her out from the group, from our group, and took her too, there to the\npartisan and we was together. So then we picked up ourselves, where to go again, we had no\nplace where to go. The partisans, they was only the men. They wouldn't take us. We went\nagain to the partisan, they had, you know, rifles, they had guns, they had everything and\nthere was a but they didn't want us. So we went far away, we was going again\nto the Pollacks, maybe they were going to take us for a day or two or something, you know.\nAnd this was going on for the whole summer, until the winter came. Then we was thinking\nwhat to do, where to go. We had a Pollack, this was my brother , but he knew\nhim. We went to him, we went to him and he ask him, he said to him, \"listen, you have to do\nsomething, let us go in, it's winter time, we have no place where to go\". So it was like, he\nsaid, \"alright, you can stay by me for a little while, then I'm going to build for you a place in\nthe woods not far from my house and you're going to stay there for winter\". And he was\nalready belonged to the White Pollacks and he was together with them working. By then\nthey was looking for Jews, to kill them because they wanted, they knew that a lot of Jews\nsurvived after the war from the Nazis, but they don't want should be Jews by the Polish.",
        "Q: When you say, \"white Pollacks\", are you talking about the Polish home army?",
        "A: No, no, this wasn't an army, this was an organization. After the war they made the\norganization, calling themselves White Pollacks.",
        "Q: So it's not the army of .",
        "A: No, I don't think so. They wanted a clean Poland. Poland should be cleaned without Jews,\nand they looked only for the Jewish people. So we was by then, I don't remember exactly\nhow long, but we was by him a short time, and one night he came over and he said, \"you\nknow what, I feel like you should go out\". This was winter time, we didn't go out, he used to\nbring us food. And he used to come, so he came for us and he said, \"let's go to my house, I\nhave prepared a dinner for you, for all of you\". We was so happy to go out and to go to a\nhome, to a house. And really he prepared a dinner for us and we was sitting around the table\nand we just start to eat and we heard the door got so opened up like this, and they start to\nshoot. They start to shoot, we got so scared. I don't know how many people there were, the\nPolish people but right away one of us, we was in this bunker by this Pollack, we was six\npeople, other boys. So one boy probably, he took from him, how was it I don't know because\nit got dark right away. When he shoot, he probably shoot both of them.",
        "Q: Sorry, airplane. Sorry.",
        "A: I don't know where I left.",
        "Q: Well you said that they were knocking on the door.",
        "A: Yeah, the open the door, I'm getting lost when I start to talk like this. And they started\nshooting. And both of them, probably one boy, I don't remember. I think we had a gun or\nsomething we had in the bunker. And he shoot somebody, one of the White Pollacks, and he\nstart to be quiet. It was quiet and nobody was there, they ran away. They got scared and they\nran away. So my husband and my brother-in-law and the other two, they went away. So\nonly me with my sister, what to do, we was staying there, we didn't know what to do. So\nthere was the Polish, the Pollacks, they had big stoves, like a oven, a big oven, and under the\noven they used to have chickens there to raise them. So I said to my sister, \"let's go there\".\nAnd we went there where the chickens was, and it was so high, and we were staying there\nuntil we didn't hear nothing, it was so quiet. So I said to my sister, \"what are we going to do\nthere, let's run\". This was in the middle of the night. It was a frosty night, it was so cold. I\nwas only in one dress, my sister too. And I said, \"we have to run\". We open up a window\nand we went out. We saw, you know, it was a winter night, a frosty night and it was so light,\nlike we saw them from far away. So I said to my sister, \"Jet's run there, probably this was our\npeople\". We ran away, we met my brother-in-law with my husband and here was the cloth\nby him, the blood, you know, was egging, like somebody hit him over the head with a rifle,\nhit him over the head hear and the blood was coming, it was freezing, you know, on him.\nWhat are we going to do, where were we going to go, who knows that you're going to leave?\nNobody knows, you know, knew about this because he had the open head in the back. So he\nsaid, my husband said, \"let's go to this and this Pollack, he's more richer one, maybe he going\nto let us in for the time being, for the night\". So we went in to him and he saw what the blood\nis running from him, and we went away from the White Pollacks, he let us in. He didn't let us\nin the house, God forbid. He let us in where the horses are standing with the cows, but we\nwere happy. We was laying around, you know, my husband, because he was so hurt and the\nblood was running from him. The blood got freezed on him. And take a look, nothing\nhappened to him and nothing happened to us. As long they didn't kill us, didn't happen,\nnothing. We had no sickness, nothing at all. So it came in the day time and he said, \"you\nknow I can't keep you, I would keep you, I'm not sending you now, I know what it is in the\ndaytime, but at night you have to go away\". So where to go? Alright, food he gave us there\nin the place. He gave us an old smock to wear, he sold us. And we went away to another\nPollack, he was living with a sister and with a nephew. They weren't married, they had no\nfamily, only three of them. We went to them and he saw us and he knew us, he knew my\nbrother-in-law more than us because my brother-in-law, they had a store in Radun and he\nused to come there.",
        "Q: We need to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "Q: You were telling me that you had found this Polish person who knew your brother-in-law.",
        "A: Yeah, we went to him, this was already at night. We went to him and we asked him, we\nstopped to talk to him and he promised him, he knew him, that he had a store. That if he had\na store, he must have money, he must have clothes, he must have a lot of things. But he told\nhim, \"we have nothing now\". He told us that, \"it's near the war, we're going to finish soon\".\nHe said, \"let us go into you, take us\". He had like a PD (ph), and he took us there, he took us\nin. So he let us in, 10n the beginning we was by him also, in the, I don't know how they call,\nwhere the horses, where the cows are staying. So we was there for a short time. Then he took\nus and he make us a place upstairs his house, there. It was like a room, a little room, and we\nwere six people there in the room. But he gave us food, he was good to us and every day he\nused to tell us that nobody knew about us, nobody knows, nobody knows nothing.",
        "Q: We're going to have this constantly, how bad is the sound? You tell me. So he made your\nroom, he fed you.",
        "A: Yeah, and he used to tell us all the time, he used to go to the church and there you listen to\nthe people what they saying, that it's going to be the end of the war, soon, soon it's going to\nbe the end. He used to come and tell us everything. And then one day he came and he said,\n\"they saying\", we was by him probably two or three months. He kept us and he feed us\neverything. So he came and he said, somebody told him in church that he has Jewish people.\nSo he came and he told us, he said, \"you know what, I kept you all the time, I can't keep you\nall the time now. From now on, you have to leave. Because what is the use if people know\nalready, they find out, so I'm going to get killed, and you're going to get killed. You better\nfind a place and go away. Find a place, where is the place? But thank God it was already\nspring time. It was already warm, so we had one way, to go to the woods, and this what we\ndid. At night time we left him and we went away. We went away to the woods. And there\nalready it was May, I think. In May it was warm already. Went away in the woods and we\nwas staying there. At night we used to go out to take for food nearby, you know. Not nearby\nbut far away. And there we met other people where they was staying, you know, with\nfamilies. So we were happy already, we met other people. And we used to have, you know, a\nconnection with the Pollacks. They used to say, they used to talk to us saying that the war is\nnear, near to the end, and this was the end really. On July the Russian came in and we was\nfree after this. We was free where to go. We went to Ashoshok (ph).",
        "Q: Can you describe to me what happened when you say, \"the Russians came in\".",
        "A: We was in the woods, came in, the Russian on a horse, on the horses. We recognized them\nthat they were Russians. But we were scared, we didn't know who are these. So they start to\ntalk to us, \"We are Russian, you're going to be free now, the war has ended, you come out.\nCome out. Don't be afraid, come out, go home. Go wherever you want to go, you are free\u201d.\nThat's what he's saying. But we was in the beginning when we saw them, we recognized\nthem that they are Russians, but still we didn't know, you know. They fright in us, the scared\nwas in us, we was afraid. But when they start to talk like this, \"go out, don't be afraid,\nnobody they will do to you something, nobody. We have freed you, go on, go\". We went and\nwe went right over to Ashoshok to our town, nobody was there, the houses was there. I went\nto my house. There was Pollacks leaving, and I was afraid to go in. You know, it was a big\nhouse, and our big table was standing. My father was a tailor, he was a heavy man.\nwas a wooden floor, and he was standing on one place. So he was like, how to\nsay to, like dan (ph), it was the woodan (ph), and I saw the place, you know. I went away\nfrom there, and I never wanted to go to my house where I was born and raised and I lost the\nfamily. So we was a few couples. So we was a few couples, and there was, we find out,\nYaffa's (ph) family came.",
        "Q: Yaffa (ph)?",
        "A: Yaffa (ph) Helia (ph), she was there with the family, with her family, and they was living in\ntheir house, in their own house. So we went to a house nearby, not far away, to my husband's\ncousin, he had a big house, because I didn't want to go to his house and I didn't want to go to\nmy house. So we went there, and we was staying there until we, you know, we met the\nPolish people and they start to talk about everything, what they saw, how all of them got\nkilled, and how they robbed everything, and now they sitting in our houses. And then we\nstart to think what to do, you know, we have to start to work. So my husband went to work,\nhe was as a baker. By then was, they had, his mother used to bake. So he went to a Pollack to\nwork for him, and he worked for a little. Then we was living there, we was thinking what to\ndo, where to go, how to establish our lives. In meantime we heard that the White Pollacks,\nthey are coming to our town. So my husband and the other couple said, \"what they going to\ndo, what? It's after the war, what they going to do\"? So I said, \"they are coming, they said the\nWhite Pollacks are coming, they're going to kill us\". And sure enough. So before this night,\nthis has to happen before the , | said to my husband, \"I'm going there to Yaffialia\n(ph), to this family, I'm afraid to stay there, after all there is a family and he knows where are\nthe people\". But I went with another of the couples, what we are staying together with\nanother person. We went there, we came to them, to this family. And we was waiting, they\nare coming or not? We wasn't sure, but the Pollacks, they said that they are going to come.\nAnd sure enough, they came. It was at night time and they came and they open up like this,\nthe door, and they came in and I heard, and we was on the second floor. There was a house, a\ntwo-family house. It's not really a two family, but they had bedrooms upstairs, and\ndownstairs they had a kitchen, they had everything, you know, in the house. \"We heard\", I\nsaid to the other person, Esther, \"you heard, I heard the shotting there\", and sure enough,\nthey shot her mother, the baby she had on her hands, and they shot them. So I said to her,\n\"they're going to shot us too\". I opened up the door and I jumped from the second floor and I\nsaid, \"it's no use to stay there because they're going to kill us, and we're going to run away,\nwe have a choice\". And sure enough, we run away. I said, \"so I'm going to break a leg, I'm\ngoing to break something, but I'm going to be alive still\". But they didn't come upstairs. We\nran away. They killed the mother with the baby and they went away.",
        "Q: Now I need to ask you a few questions about this. Do you remember when this was?",
        "A: This was October, 1944, October the 20th, I think.",
        "Q: How did you know that Yaffa's (ph) mother and baby brother were killed, how die you know\nthat's who it was?",
        "A: After, after we find out. How do I know, I run away, I didn't know nothing. I thought that\nthey going to, they killed everybody, the whole family.",
        "Q: So you heard the noise and you heard shouting, and you heard shots?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Could you understand, and these were Polish, could you understand what they were saying,\ndid you hear them talking?",
        "A: No, I didn't hear them talking. First of all, we was on second floor, I couldn't hear talking\nthem. But we ran away, I ran, I don't know. I don't know where really. But I heard already\nthat it's quiet. I went home, there to my husband, and he find out already, he came there to\nthe house to find out, because I was there, that they killed the mother and the baby. And this\nwas, that's all, this was the end. After the war, after getting through so much in their lifes,\nand she had the baby there in a bunker, maybe you know about this? No, she didn't tell you\nYaffialia (ph)?",
        "A: You tell me.",
        "Q: Yes, she had the baby there, and they came with the baby, and they had to start a new life,\nand to live. And take a look what happened. They killed them and the father got crazy. He\nwent crazy. From there on we start to look where to go again. I went to my sister in Radun,\nand then we didn't know what to do. We said, \"maybe we'll go\". We went back to Ashoshok\n(ph), we was there for a little while, then we went to Vilna.",
        "Q: I need to ask you this, 1s there anything else that you can remember or you can tell me about,\nany more details about that night at Yaffa's (ph) house, when the Polish people came in, how\ndid you know that they were Polish. Do you have any sense of how many of them there\nwere.",
        "A: What do you mean, \"how do I know are they Polish\"? Who could come to kill, who could\ncome in the middle of the night to kill people? Only the White Pollacks. We knew already,\nsomebody from the Pollacks told us, they are planning to come to kill us. We didn't think\nabout this, why they should come to kill us, why, what for? They took away everything\nalready from us, we didn't have nothing, why they should kill us? You see, if we would take,\nwe believed them, the Pollacks what they was saying, we would run away, naturally. But we\ncouldn't believe them, why they should do this? We didn't take nothing from them, why they\nshould do this?",
        "Q: So some of the people in your town were nice to you and they warned you, but there was this\nother group who wanted to get rid of you?",
        "A: Yeah, and just some little people, what they were nice. But the most, the most were bad.\nThey took our houses right away, they took everything, whatever have got left. You know,\nliving there for generations, for generations. I had a grandfather, a grandmother, a mother.\nYou know, so there must be something, they had something. So how can be, how can they\nbe nice to us, and be polite to us, and help us, they didn't want us. So these few people, what\nthey've got left, they wanted to kill too, and they killed. And you heard what had happened in\nKent, so that happened there too, and they killed a lot of people.",
        "Q: Did you see any of these people?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You just heard them, and you heard the shouting.",
        "A: That's all.",
        "Q: So you decided to go to Vilna.",
        "A: So we went there and we tried to find work, it was very hard to. It was Russian people, and\nLithuania. We didn't know the language, not none of them. But we tried, you know. My\nhusband went to work, he was a tailor, so he find work. And I went to work as a waiter, but I\ndidn't know the language. I used to, they used to come to order, a order, I used to write in\nPolish. But the sentence that came out, Polish words but they came out in Russian, you\nunderstand? I used to go in the kitchen to order the food, and this way I start to learn the\nlanguage. I used to come home and read and, you know, I tried the best only through. And in\nthe beginning it was very hard but they liked me there, and I learned. And then I worked as\na, later on already I worked as a, what do you say, as I gave orders already. You know, and I\nlearned the language and I start to work, and it wasn't so bad, I had good. And I got pregnant,\nin 1950 I gave birth to my daughter and I had in the house always there, you know, a\nwoman. Until they start to talk to go away from Russia. You know, it was a hard life, but in\nLithuania it was easier, the life. They start to take out people, you know, where they used to\nwork, where they had, where they was reached. But they come out to bring them on the\nSiberia, you know. This was a killing too, on the Siberia. Till they opened up with the Polish,\nthey wanted all the Polish people what they've got left, they want them in Poland. And the\nRussian, they let them out, so right away, soon it was this, you know. But then in the papers,\non the radio I heard this. So right away, I said to my husband, \"we have to leave, there's no\nfuture in here\".",
        "Q: Were the Lithuanian people nice to you?",
        "A: I don't know really, not bad. I worked with a Lithuanian, one person, a few of them. They\nwasn't so bad, no I wouldn't say.",
        "Q: And was there any threat that you or your husband would have to go to Siberia?",
        "A: That could be. Could be, they can find all the time, any time. And this was why we were\nafraid. That's why we wanted to get out of there. But usually we was, it wasn't so bad to live\nthere. I was working, my husband worked. We made a lot, I didn't have to stand in line for\nbread, for other things. I used to get easy where I worked, you know. So it wasn't so hard. So\nit wasn't so bad. This was the only thing what I was afraid, they shouldn't send us to Siberia.",
        "Q: Now were you working in a place where there were a lot of Russian officials?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So you got to know them?",
        "A: The director, he was a Jew too, but they didn't speak no Yiddish. He understood, he knew\nwhat I went through and a lot of things I learned from him. He was very nice, in fact when I\nleft, I came and I said to him, \"I have to leave, I'm going away, I'm going to Poland\". I didn't\nsay that I'm going to Israel, I want to go to America. This I couldn't mention, God forbid. So\nI said, \"I'm going away, there 1s, got left from the war, from the family\". I have to go there.\nHe used to say to me, \"why? Take a look you have a good position, you're working, you\nhave everything, whatever you need, why you should go away? Why\"? All the time. \"You're\nnever going to find a life like this\". Sure, I'm never going to find a life like this. To live, to go\nto sleep and to think that maybe somebody knocks on door to take us out and to take us to\nSiberia. For no reason at all. And if I worked, I was afraid at work too. They could put you in\njail for a little nothing. For the littlest nothing. Maybe somebody could say one word on you,\nthat's 1t. This would be enough.",
        "Q: Even though you had this good relationship?",
        "A: Doesn't matter.",
        "Q: And yet you were going to go to Poland, the Poles had been very bad to you.",
        "A: Yeah, I'm going to go into Poland just to go through to Poland, not to stay there, not to live\nthere. I was in Poland, in Russia, for two months I think, then I left for Israel.",
        "Q: How did you arrange this, did someone help you?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: To get to Warsaw to get to Israel?",
        "A: Sure. There was first of all, to Russia to go because we was born and raised, so we could go.\nThey let us go. Understand, we was born, and we had to go to Moscow to take out some\npapers. But we are, we are really Polish people, we was born there and raised there, so they\nlet us go, the Russians. And we think in Poland, we could stay there, they didn't throw us out.\nThey gave us food too. They was very nice there, but we was afraid to stay there. And we\nwas trying to go away.",
        "Q: Who gave you food there?",
        "A: The government.",

        "Q: Jason? It's on the next door porch. Can we drug him? What's he barking at? Okay. You left\noff, you said your sister was beginning to write you letters.",
        "A: I couldn't have the letters by me, so she used to write in the postal center, they used to call, if\nyou're familiar with this. So I used to come in the post office and I used to take out a letter. I\nwas afraid to read there in the building, I used to go around where I didn't see people. And I\nused to read and cry a lot. And I used to tear it in little, little pieces, that's all. And I couldn't\nanswer her, I was afraid because they can come at night and take me out, that's all, take\naway. You know, before Stalin died, he had a plan to take out all the Jews, to take them to\nSiberia and to freeze them there. Not to kill them like the Germans did, but he would freeze\nthem. Because there it's so cold that you can't go out. And he would keep us in a place like\nthis where there's no eat, no nothing, and he would kill all the Jews. So I was all the time,\nyou know, my daughter was born in 1950 and this was in 1953 before he died. So he had this\nplan and they had to start already. And we didn't know what to do, again. It was worse, but\nlike this we had a good life, but we had no future and we was afraid for tomorrow. So when\nhe died he didn't have too much time because he died in 1953 and there was, then was other\npeople took over and the other people was very good, very good to everybody, and we had a\ngood life. Till then I start to write letters to my sister, and she start to write to me, to answer\nme. But to go out it was out of the question, we couldn't go out never, never in life. But then\nwhen they changed, when came the other people in Stalin's place, so they letted out the\nPolish people to go to Poland. This way we went to Poland. And from Poland I wrote\nalready my sister, she knew already that I'm there. I called her, I made a call on her\ntelephone, you know, she should pay. And then she start to take us from Poland to America,\nto United States. But after a little while she find out that she can't take us all, it has to be one\nperson and this is going to take a long, long time until we're going to get the visa. So I said to\nher, and that time they said, \"whoever wants to go to Israel can go free\". So I said to my\nhusband, \"whether it's going plane or it's going a ship, we are going, we are not staying here\nin Poland with the Polish people\". And this what we did. So I didn't wait for my sister till she\nwas going to do everything. We went to Israel, at least I'm safe there, I have got a life. It was\na hard time. It was after a war, we had seen, it was a war, it was very hard. Everything was\nlike you had to get, like for food, you know. It was hard to get to work, everything was hard.\nAnyway my sister helped me, she send me money, she send me packages, and she helped me\na lot. Till she's this was in '57 when we came to Israel, 1957. So it was till\n1959, till my sister made out the papers for us, for all of us. In the beginning she could only\ntake one person, me with my daughter or my husband. I didn't want to leave my husband. Or\nhe didn't want to leave me. So I said to her, I was that we're not going to leave.\nIf to go, to come to you, only all of us. Otherwise we're going to stay in Israel. Now is a bad\ntime but we're going to get through this. We had hard times a lot in our lives, we get through\nthis too. But the only thing, that we are free, we are with Jews, I'm not afraid that they're\ngoing to kill me, that I'm a Jew. Everybody's there, the Jews, but the Arabs, nobody was\nafraid for the Arabs there, that time. Even now, they're not afraid for them. Whatever's going\nto happen's going to happen. But it's our land, it's our place, it's our home. And the biggest\nmistake what I did in my life is when I came here to this country. Maybe God punished me\nfor this. What I went through here, a lot of trouble. And there maybe I would avoid\neverything and wouldn't come to me so much trouble as it came here. I left because I wasn't\nafraid that 1t was a hard time. My husband went to work, and he work, he could work. He\nwent, he never had this, he never worked on this work what he went on, construction.\nAnything. We went there to the people, they're called Sokinote (ph), where they're giving\nspecialty places, you know, office where they're giving fair to work. So they said, on person\nwas sitting, like a heavy man, he said, \"I have all of this work, I can't give you no other one, I\ndon't have it\". So this is the only thing, my husband took the work and the only thing what I\nsaid to him, I said, \"how many times we have to get through everything, to start from the\nbeginning\". And that's what start. We had our home, like they gave us, the government, we\nhad to pay a certain amount money, and they build specially homes for the new come in, and\nwe had already established. I had two bedrooms, and I was so happy, and I was planning to\ngo to work because I couldn't, then my daughter went to school and I was planning to go to\nwork. I could work in these places, you know, as a waiter, I knew already the work. And the\nlanguage, it wasn't for me like it was here, I knew a little bit but I forgot, you know, when I\nwas a child I was. But my daughter went to school and she start to talk right away in\nHebrew, in fact she went to the second grade, and they were happy and I was happy with\nthem. Then all of a sudden came the visa with my sister. I was so unhappy to leave. I left\nonly because I had my sister here, otherwise I would never, never in my life. Here start\nagain, you know. All those with hard times, with everything. Alright, I came to my sister and\nI had by her, I was by her for 11 months, not quite a whole year. I gave birth to my son, and\nwas blessed by her in the house, you know, in 1959. And I wasn't happy, I was unhappy. I\ndidn't have my place. When I start to look for my own place, for apartment, where I used to\ngo, nobody wants me. With two children nobody wants. Nobody wants me. Till I find an\napartment, and my sister used to say, \"why you want to go out\"? It was no good, she was our\nfamily. Like, she had one child only. She had a brand new house, just bought it. When I\ncame, she just moved in. And I didn't feel like to stay there, you know, with a baby. So I\nused to go to find an apartment. One day I went and I find apartment there, it wasn't so nice\napartment. From there she moved out, she left me her apartment, when I'm going to come?\nAnd she paid for a month rent, that time it was $50 rent, you know, in 1959. So I came and I\nwas pregnant, and this was on the third floor or on the fourth floor, I don't remember. And I\nwent there, you know, with my big belly and I saw and there was already Shlowtsy (ph), you\nknow, the blanket people around. And as soon I came out. So my sister said, she saw already\nI mean, I started crying. I said, \"I left a beautiful home, my beautiful house and I was so\nhappy there, why I came here, to climb on the fourth floor\"? I said, \"with a, is going to be\nborn a little baby\"? So she said, \"you don't have to take, you don't have to, you have a place.\nWe're going to find another place, don't worry\".",
        "Q: This was in New York?",
        "A: So then I was looking and looking. Finally I find a place where they let me in, and I said to\nmy sister, she didn't know about this place and I gave the deposits right away. She went\naway and took our deposits, she didn't like the apartment. I had to put in money there, it\nwasn't so nice, she didn't like it. So then we start to look around her. And I find apartment,\nthis was a walk-in apartment. In the beginning she didn't want it also, my sister. But she said,\n\"alright, this one is more like it, okay, you're near me and you'll be with the children,\nwhatever\". She took my daughter to school, you know.",
        "Q: Stop? Not yet. \"You stopped\", you said, \"your sister helped you\", she took your daughter to\nschool, and you started getting adjusted or it was tough?",
        "A: Well I was with a little baby. I couldn't go to work, I couldn't help my husband. He was\nworking for three years day and night, you know, to, he saw that nobody wants us in\napartment, we have to buy something for ourselves. So it was a hard time, I can't say it was\nlight. But thank God, I find an apartment by older people, in a walk-in. They let me in with\nthe two children, and that time I didn't have no television, no nothing. You know, my sister\ngave me a bed and she gave me, you know, I didn't have nothing. Like a table, chairs, to eat,\non what to eat. Well she gave me a lot of stuff so I had, then little by little I bought it for\nmyself. I buyed one piece here or one piece there. And I was there for four years.",
        "Q: What were some of the biggest difficulties when you came to this country?",
        "A: The difficult was, without a language, without money, without everything. We had nobody,\nonly my sister. This was the only help, what I had from my sister. Otherwise, my daughter\nused to come from school, she used to make the homework, and she used to cry, and I was\ncrying with her. \"Why you came here, why you came here, what made you to come here?\nYou don't live with your sister anyway in one house, why you came here? We had already\neverything there, and there was all the Jews. Why you came here, to put me again with other\npeople, I mean non Jews\". All aggressions it was all the time, for the longest time I\nremember. And I used to curse myself what I did, but there was no way to go back. We had\nto do it. I said to my husband, \"we start and we have to finish, and we have to raise the\nchildren, and we have to go on with our lives. Otherwise what it's going to be\"? Then I went\nwhen he was already three years old. My daughter used to come from school at 3:00, I used\nto go at 4:00 at work. I used to work in a factory for chuckalud (ph), the second shift. So I\nused to work.",
        "Q: So it was a tough adjustment being here?",
        "A: Very hard, very hard. To start from the beginning, how many times you can start? How\nmany times? I was 37 years old when I came here and I gave birth to my son. It's a good\nremembering, you know, my whole life. He was born in March and I came in February, just\nin the same day. I came February the sixth, March the sixth he was born. This time to get to,\nto be in hospital for a whole week and talk to the walls. This was good?",
        "Q: What do you think gave you the strength to get through all of this? Is there something in\nyour character that helped you?",
        "A: Well I have a very hard character. And really, I'm not afraid, I'm on?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I'm not afraid for anything. Shut it off a little.",
        "Q: You want to turn it off. So you had a tough constitution.",
        "A: Yeah, very.",
        "Q: Do you think that's something you learned through your, when you were a child, or it's just\nthe way you were?",
        "A: I don't think so, when I was a child it was nothing specially. We was growing up, till I was,\nbut I don't think I didn't went through nothing specially like. I remember when my\ngrandfather died, this I remember. I was staying with him. He had a stroke. Nobody knew\nwhat it was. When he was sick, I used to come and gave him water, you know, but the mouth\nwas on the side. To this day, what I remember when I was a child. Otherwise, nothing.",
        "Q: Maybe your parents respected you independence?",
        "A: When my sister went to school. In Europe they used to start when you were seven years old.\nI was not quite six years, I was five and three quarters, something like this. So I said, I start\nto cry when she went to school. So I said to my mother, \"I want to go to school too\". So I\nremember, my mother said, \"let her go, let her go. She'll be able to go, to make homework,\nlet her go\". I was crying, and I wanted to go, and I went. And I went and I was staying at\nschool with her, with my sister, and we was together all the years through the school. In fact,\nwhen we was in the fifth grade, my sister got sick and she couldn't go to school no more, and\nI went and I finished seven classes.",
        "Q: So you were a willful child?",
        "A: I wasn't so bad. I wasn't too, I mean I didn't gave her a hard time, my parents like naughty\nchildren giving hard times. I never heard of this and I raise like this, my children. They never\nsaid to me, \"no\", or \"I want to do this and I'm going to do it\". And I used to say, \"no way\".",
        "Q: Let me ask you something. During these years, during the Holocaust, did religion play any\nrole in keeping you strong, or did you even know when it was Shabbos (ph)? Or did you pay\nany attention to this?",
        "A: We do pay attention, we do. We used to pray and ask God, he should help us. But then, what\nwe could do? Nothing to do. Why God punish us? Why is God on their place, on the non\nJews place, on the non Jews side, not on our side. What we did wrong? We kept strictly,\nthere was nothing non kosher, I didn't heard this after the war. But before the war, where I\nwas raised in a house, I never heard of this non kosher things, or to do something on\nSaturdays. We never heard of this.",
        "Q: But during the war?",
        "A: During the war was a different thing.",
        "Q: Did you know when holidays were? Did you even know?",
        "A: We knew a little, like Yom Kippur, you know, Yom Kippur, you're not allowed to eat. So we\nwas counting, that it has to be this time, let's say tomorrow. And we had this week before, we\nhad a mistake. So twice we didn't eat, we prayed but we didn't have no books to pray. But\nwhat is the holidays, what is this? What is everything there, where was our God? Where was\nour God? To listen to little babies crying, to be taking away mothers, I mean kids, babies\nfrom mothers. You have to give away your baby to kill them? It's not heard. It was in Spain\nInquisition, you heard about this? I suppose you learn about this. But years and years ago,\nmaybe 2000 years ago, so they killed people because they are Jews. They had a choice, they\ncould get to be non Jews if they wanted to leave. But they didn't want it. So they burned\nthem, you know about this. But we didn't have no choices, we are a Jew, you are a Jew, you\nhave to be killed, that's it. No pity from nobody, from nobody.",
        "Q: Were you angry you were a Jew?",
        "A: Sometimes, sometimes. You know, some girls, I had a friend, Pollack took her, and he raised\nher. She wasn't the same age as I am, as I was. He kept her the whole war. She used to go to\nchurch, she used to pray there. She used to do things whatever he said, whatever he told her.\nAnd she was as a Polish girl. After the war, she came in Ashoshok (ph), to our town, with\nthis man. He was a older man already, and she went back to him. That time soldiers came in\nour town, came a soldier, a young boy. And somebody told him that in this and this, down\nthere lives a Yiddish, Jewish girl. She lives by Pollack and she is a Pollack, she goes to\nchurch and everything. Even there, he took her out. He took her out, he got married to her,\nand he took her to Israel. I went there, I went there by her. If not for him, she would be, she\nwould spend her whole life there with him. Well he gave her life, let's put it this way, he\ngave her life. A lot of people they got married to the Pollacks and they was staying with\nthem. But I don't know if I would do this, I don't think so.",
        "Q: How long after liberation did it take you to start being observant again?",
        "A: A long, long time. We couldn't come to ourself. First of all, you know, as a young girl I was\nso skinny, I didn't have no bust, no nothing. When we came I had worn, I don't know, I didn't\nhave no underwear, no nothing. And excuse me, I got sick. I used to sleep and the water\ngoes. It was hard till I got to myself. I got to eat food better and I realized that it can't be this\ntime, it can't come back any more. And I have to establish my life, and I have to lie, you\nknow. So why from them? And that's what it is. I mean, I looked out for myself and I used to\nsay, \"we have to do it, we have to have a family, we have to have a life\". I don't know who\ntried, maybe my parents, who knows. Because to be honest with you, I couldn't believe in\nGod already, what he did to us.",
        "Q: Okay, I'm going to put in one more tape.\nEnd of Tape #6\nTape #7",
        "Q: Is religion important to you today?",
        "A: It is important because I want the children, they should go in the same footsteps. Otherwise,\nI'll be honest with you. If not for the children, maybe I would be a free person. I'm going\nevery Saturday to the synagogue. My husband goes twice a day now, since he retired. But\nbefore he used to go also only on Saturdays. He used to work on Saturdays because we had\nto make a living. Nobody wants them, they want Saturdays too. And this what we went\nthrough, I wouldn't care too much. But later on when the kids start to go to school, I wanted\nthem, I used to light candles every Friday night. I didn't cook on Shabbos (ph), on Saturdays.\nI used to prepare Fridays. When I used to go to work I used to stay till 2:00 at night on\nThursday night to prepare for the two days food, not to cook, not to do anything. And I used\nto clean and shop, everything in the same day. Used to come from work, go shopping, to\nprepare and cook. That was the life. Then I wanted my daughter should go to Ishiri (ph), they\nwanted a lot of money. Yaffialia (ph) tried for me, I couldn't do it. So I gave her public\nschool, she went to public school. Then when my son was already five years old, I put him in\nIshiri (ph), I find more or less cheaper. I put him in Ishiri (ph), he didn't, he was so connected\nto me like a wire. And I was staying with him, for a whole month I used to go to Ishiri (ph)\nwith him and sitting with him. Till the rabbi came to me and he said, \"It's no use, he's crying,\nhe doesn't want, he doesn't like. Take him home, take and put him some place else\". What I\ndid the mistake is, when I gave him to Ishiri (ph), it was only boys, it was too religious.",
        "Q: you felt it was important to keep up the traditions.",
        "A: Yes. And now I'm keeping up very strongly, very. I don't write on Shabbos (ph), on holidays.",
        "Q: Over the years, especially maybe when your children were a bit younger than they are now,\ndid you talk about your experiences during the Holocaust? Did you tell them about them?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Now do they know?",
        "A: They know, some things. Little things I told them. But I couldn't sit with them and talk about\nthis. I would hurt myself too much. So I didn't talk to them, really. They find out from places,\nfrom movies, from books, from these things. From papers they find out. Then little things I\ntold them where I was, like from Ashoshok (ph), like from Grodno, little things. When I was\nin the woods. So my grandson used to listen to, he wanted I should tell him. But the kids, my\nson, my daughter, especially my daughter, she didn't like me talk about this. But they know\neverything what I went through.",
        "Q: Now.",
        "A: Yeah, you know. My daughter went with me to Washington, to the Holocaust, when I was\nthere, my grandson, and they saw everything.",
        "Q: Let me ask you, I don't know if you've thought about this, but I'm sure that these experiences\nhad a long term impact on the way. I'm trying to get a sense of how these experiences\nimpacted you later maybe in terms of the way you raised your kids, and the way that you live\ntoday. Maybe certain fears you had, certain values.",
        "A: Well I didn't have no fears later on but I was sorry when I had so much trouble, you know,\nhere. I was sorry. I used to say to my husband, \"why I survived? What I have accomplished\nin my life? What I have accomplished\"? I have no joy, no nockis (ph), but maybe that time I\nwas really angry, you know, what I did and why I came here, and what I went through a lot\nhere. Everything from the beginning. How many times you can start? Start and start, and\nwent through everything. But then I figure out, still I have a family, I have to raise them.\nMaybe later on I'm going to have more joy, more nockis (ph), more Yiddish nockis (ph), you\nknow? And that's all, and that's what it is. Now I have all the time with sickness. My\nhusband is a sick man. Last year he was twice in hospital and they put him a pacemaker.\nListen, we're getting older, everything comes out. We are not so strong anymore. We can't\ntake things what I used to take. I said all the time to my daughter, I said, \"what I used to do, I\ncan't do nothing here now. She said, \"you can do it, you are a strong woman, you will be\nstrong with us and with the life\".",
        "Q: Do you think that you raised your children differently because of your experiences than you\nmight of had you a normal background?",
        "A: No, I don't think so.",
        "Q: Are there certain situations you're in, certain noises, certain smells, that remind you of your\nlife in Europe?",
        "A: Sure. The only place is in the house, by me in the house. Every Friday night, this is never\ngoing to go away from me. When I'm lighting the candles, my husband is coming from Shull\n(ph), 1s making Kiddish (ph), you know what Kiddish (ph) 1s. I'm missing. The first years\nwas terrible. Later on, you know, I got used to it. Thought, this has to be, it's not going to\ncome any more. I survived, and I have to live to see a little nockis (ph), for my kids, for my\ngrandchildren. We should only be well. This is my first and the main thing, you know, to live\na few years like human being. To see something. But on the other hand when you are sick,\nyou can't go away, you can't travel far away. Three years ago we was in Israel for the bar\nmitzvah for my grandson. We had a beautiful time, we enjoyed so much. And now, who\nknows? God knows when we're going to go again because you have to go constantly to\ndoctors with medicine, to keep up with appointments. So we happy for this, we getting up in\nthe morning, we get dressed, thank God for this. What is more to ask now? Nothing more. I\nhave my own home, we have a car, we're still driving. We are not so poor. We raised the\nchildren and they are like, we say in Yiddish, \"To Godt and to light\" (ph), you know what it\nmeans? \"To God and to people\". And they are nice children, very devoted to us. My\ndaughter calls me when she goes to work, and at work, and when she comes from work. And\nevery day she's coming, whatever. \"You don't feel good? I'll take you to the doctor and tell\nme the truth. Tell me the truth\". Not all the time I can tell her the truth how I feel because she\nfeels bad too. Beside this, she's a European girl, it's different too. But now you can, I mean\nthe, she's without the accent, so is my son. He was born here. And that's what it is. We still\nstruggle now for the health. Before it was for work, for money, for life to live. And now it's\nfor health. God should give us only a few good years to live.",
        "Q: I'm finished asking you questions. Is there anything else you want to say to conclude this? Or\nanything you want to tell your grandchildren?",
        "A: That I survived. I went through a lot in my life and with God's help, I lived to have my own\nchildren and I lived to have grandchildren. And maybe if God would help me, I should live\nand to see great grandchildren, and to have nockis (ph) from them, from all of them. And\nGod should give us health for another few years, without any trouble, without what I went\nthrough in my life.",

        "A: My name is Dora Kramen Dimitro. I was born in Ashoshok (ph), Poland at that time, in\nJanuary 22, 1922. My father's name was Hierr (ph) Shavival (ph), my mother's name was\nIbella (ph). I was born in Ashoshok (ph) and raised there until the war, I was staying there.\nThen when the war start.",
        "A: The town was a small town but we had a big family from both sides, from my mother's side\nand from my father's side. We was very devoted to each other and personally, my own\nfamily, my mother was born, there was four children, one boy and three girls. My father was\na tailor, he used to work in the house and we had a nice life, a quiet life. We enjoyed our life\nand this was all a part of, I went to school when I was six years old, with my sister Pegilla\n(ph), we went to Wonklis (ph) and we went to a Hebrew school and we went to a Polish\nschool. I learned Polish, I had seven grades, Polish language, and then Hebrew I learned too.\nWhen I finished the seven class school, public school, there wasn't high school 1n this time,\nwe had to go in a bigger town, like to Vilna, this was the nearest town near Ashoshok (ph).\nBut we couldn't afford all this, to go there. After a little while, that was not really, I finished\n36 or 37, I don't remember exactly, this school. And I used to help my father, I learned how\nto sew, and then the war start.",
        "A: Yes, we belonged to organizations they used to call Betar (ph) and we used to come all the\nyoung people, there was dancing there, and we have a nice time.",
        "A: This what we planned to go someday to Israel. This was our organization what was working\nfor Israel and we were planning someday to go there. That's why we belonged, and we used\nto come the young people, we used to come in one place, singing and dancing and that's all.\nThis was the all the entertainment what we had there. Sometimes we used to have movies.\nThey used to come from another town and we used to see a picture.",
        "A: The organization though is politically oriented, did they teach you certain things?",
        "A: Yeah, they used to talk about this all the time, to teach us about Israel, what kind of life is\nthere, how it's going on.",
        "A: Well it was much, how can I say, it's much different how they're raising here the youngsters\nand by us. It was a family, a big family lay, we used to do everything by ourselves, you\nknow because my mother didn't have too much time. There you have to shop and cook and\nclean, everything by yourself, to take care for yourself. When we grow up, we use to, like\nteenagers we used to help the mother, everything in the house. We used to cook, it's not like\nhere, you go out and you buy ready whatever you want, too lazy to cook, you don't want to\nshop, you don't want to cook, you don't want to clean, you're doing something, you're idling\nsomebody, but this wasn't by us, this was complicated. We had to do everything by ourselves\nand let's say 1t used to come, here whatever they want, whatever they need, they're going\nshopping for clothes. We used to have clothes only on the holidays twice a year. Whatever\nwe need, shoes, a dress, a coat. Not really like things what people buying here, let's be, lay\nthere, for occasions, no such a thing this occasions. This is the way. When I went to school I\nhad a uniform, you know what I used to where everytime to school, when I used to come at\nhome I used to change for our plain dress. Maybe I had three or four dresses, that's all. We\ndidn't wear pants or sneakers or something like this. Very plain. But with the food, we had\nour own home, we had a garden we used to plant, you know, like potatoes, onions,\ncucumbers, everything we had for ourself. This was the life but we were very happy. We had\na family, we enjoyed this. We used to go on Shabbos (ph), we used to go to a temple, not a\ntemple, a congregation, a Shabbos (ph) type. And it was a very religious place, orthodox\nplace, we didn't know no other things. We enjoy our lives, I miss the life. Used to come in\nthe Shabbos (ph), Friday night, we had our dinner Friday Shabbos (ph), you know, the whole\nfamily used to sit around the table and we enjoyed the meal, with playing, with everything. It\nwas wonderful. I wish this wouldn't happen. Alright, people are dying, they wouldn't be alive\nalready by this time but still the years what we spent for the Holocaust in the woods, all over,\nin the ghettos, people had a life, they could live with their parents, they could live with their\nfamily to enjoy. When I got married we didn't have nobody, no mother, no father. When I\ngave birth to my children, nobody was with me like I was with my daughter. Sorry. My\nhusband is coming.",
        "A: I had one brother, he was the oldest, and we was three sisters, that's all, this was our whole\nfamily. Then I had uncles, aunts, they had children, a lot of them, from both sides. I can't\neven remember exactly how many there was, but they can't think about this, to tell you 1f you\nneeded exactly the amount, no. Then the community was most a Jewish community and it\nwas very nice, the people. We was living like a quiet life in the community. When I went to\nthe Polish school, there was anti semites, there was. They used to say all the time to us, go to\nPalestine, at that time it wasn't Israel it was Palestine. Every Jew should go to Palestine, not\nto stay here. Naturally they used to come with sandwiches, they used to come with non\nkosher food, so they wanted all the time, we should taste their food, and they knew that we're\nnot allowed. They always start with us, you know, about this. They used to teach on\nSaturdays too. The Jewish people, the Jewish girls and the boys, we didn't go there. We used\nto take by them the lessons after, you know, on Sunday. Sunday was off for everybody but\nnot for us. We used to keep Saturday all the time. That was the life. We had our Saturdays all\nthe time, everything was closed by us, we didn't cook, we didn't clean, we didn't work all\nday, we didn't do nothing, this was a quiet day. Naturally we didn't have no telephones, no\nair conditions, no nothing, nothing at all, so it wasn't, to disconnect something or prepare, it\nwas prepared. We cooked for Saturday, we didn't warm up, we didn't do nothing, just a quiet\nday, just the men, just everybody used to go the synagogue to play and doing nothing. At\nnight after Shabbos, we used to go , like in the days when it was nice we used to\ngo walking and like this we used to come to a warm place, everybody, like the organizations,\nwe used to come and to sing and to dance, that's all, this was life. We used to go to school,\nnaturally to make homework so the days in the middle of the week, it was occupied, we\ndidn't do nothing. Only on Sunday, so Sunday we used to work, we used to do things in the\nhouse to help the parents, to help do things. This was the look of the life, can't compare here.\nFirst of all this was 50 years ago, more than 50 years. So everything was not everything\ngoes, like medication, everything goes ahead, at that time they didn't know nothing. Who\nknew about hearts, about heart attacks, about the applications. A person died, he died, we\ndidn't know from what or when. You see it was one hospital in town and one doctor, and this\ndoctor was on everything. So you can imagine what kind of life it was, but we were healthy,\neverybody was healthy. And we used to eat everything, whatever it was. You couldn't pick.\nAnd that's all, that was the life, until the war start.",
        "A: Yes. It used to, first of all we had school. We had to get the homework for Saturday to\nprepare for Monday. So we was with them, in contact. They used to live, they were all\nneighbors, not far from us. And the parents, my father used to make work for the people, for\nthe Polish people, so he knew them, a lot of them. In fact, when the war start, we used to hire\nby them, a few of them, it wasn't too many.",
        "A: Yes, yes, I wouldn't say no, yes. They used to come, every place was like a market, they used\nto come, the Polish people, to sell things like eggs, butter, cheeses, food, all kinds of things\nand we used to buy from them, a lot of things.",
        "A: No, no, no. We used to live with them fairly, you know, I would say, close with them.",
        "A: Well it wasn't really abuse like in the school, they never talked about it, they never talked\nabout it. In the beginning we was going to a Hebrew school, so it was only Jewish people,\nyou know, and they teach us with everybody. But then when I went to the Polish school, they\nwas nice too, the Polish teachers, they were nice. They didn't never see the difference\nbetween a Jew or a Polish student, we was the same by them. What else?",
        "A: I don't remember such a thing, only one thing when we used to go out let's say, they used to\nsay, \"you are coming and this and this time you have to be home, not later\". If we have to\ncome home sometimes later, they used to take off the shoes, they shouldn't here, we open up\nthe door and then we walk in there. Otherwise everything was, whatever they used to say, it\nwas dinner Shabbos, we have to be by the table, the whole family. You never can say, \"no\",\nto them, or \"I wanted to do this\", or \"I wanted to come late\", or \"I want to do this or that\".",
        "A: I would say, not a bad. I used to listen to the parents, whatever they used to say, and I did\nwhatever they used to say. It wasn't broke by us, it wasn't such a thing, like to move out from\nthe house when you are a teenager, or are growing up. You move out from the house when\nyou got married. So this way also, we used to live together in one place.",
        "A: When the war start, what kind of changes could be?",
        "A: Yeah, we find out when it start in Germany in 1939, we knew already that he's killing, that\nhe's doing things, but we couldn't believe, why you should come to us to do this, why? What\nwe did to him? Why you should do this? Then when they start to come in, you know, the\npeople from Germany, they pass by our town and they told us, but still we couldn't believe,\ntill they came to us and it start, the killing. When we saw with our eyes, why you should do\nthis? Why? What we did wrong in our lives? Why he's going to kill the small children, the\nlittle babies and they didn't grow up? Why\u201d Till the last minute, till they start to kill, we saw\nwhat he's going to do. And he said to the people that when they start to take out, for\nAshoshok (ph), for the men, and they did the graves for themselves, and they said to us, to\nthe women, to the children, that he's taking them at war, really he did the nice war. They dig\nthe graves for themselves, so they lied to us, we didn't, we couldn't believe. Then when they\nkilled everybody in Ashoshok (ph), and it was left very little people, when we went to\nLondon.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well first of all, the Russians came and whatever they saw by us, they was wondering, like\nthings what we had, they didn't had. They had a miserable life too, there in the Russia. You\nknow, they belonged to the government, they wasn't like a boss for himself, for themselves.\nThey're working for them, and whatever they used to give him, clothes, to eat, they had to do\nthis. And when they came to us everything was, we had, you know, normal life, they was\nwondering. They start to buy and to take things what they didn't have, like watches, they\ndidn't saw. We did not buy ourself really expensive things. But they changed first of all the\nlanguage, we didn't know. My father knew, he was in the first war in 1914, he was at the\nwar, so he knew how to speak Russia, French. Of course, he was with those people there so\nhe spoke to them, he used to do things for them. Really we didn't have, we couldn't go like to\nbuy things what we want, not food, not like we had for the Polish people. Really for the\nPolish people, we was our own boss. My father worked in the house and everything we had\nfor ourselves. And they changed all that, they took over everything. All the, you know, the\nstores, we didn't have no more stores for ourselves, they took all that. So this was a lot of\nchange.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, the first time, yeah. We didn't know about this in the first time. But later on, later on\nwe found out that it's going to go down everything for them. In fact, some people, they was\nafraid, I mean whoever had, by them, maybe you know about this, about communism by\nthem. This means they belonged to the government, they couldn't say about something about\nthe government or something for themselves, nothing. This was like they were occupied,\nthey were like in a jail. So we didn't feel comfortable to live and I almost felt like this, but we\nhad to get used to it. They put up, right away they made the stores should belong, they took\nfrom the owners and that they belonged to the government, everything, and they put up their\nown people to work. So it was different but we had to get used to it, to this life. It wasn't that\nfor long.",
        "A: Did you have to learn Russian?",
        "A: Do you remember what happened when the Germans came, can you describe that to me?",
        "A: What happened? Before they occupied our town, we weren't, like the killing, the shouting,\nand then they came on the motorcycles in our town. We was very scared, we was all of us\nwas in the houses, we was afraid to go out. They came and they start to talk I think, in\nGerman. My father understood German. It's a little bit similar to Yiddish. But not too much,\na little bit, you can understand what they are talking about. That it's going to be a normal life\nthey start to say, and we're all going to work together, everything is going to be alright. In\nfact my father worked for them for a little while, until they killed him. So when they, I don't\nremember, a few months later they started killing. We didn't have no ghetto at that time.",
        "A: I don't think so.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yeah, we wore yellow stars so they should know who is a Jew, and we walked on the street\ntoo, not on the sidewalk, between the street and the sidewalk. This was different, because\nthey had to know that we are Jewish.",
        "A: No, not at that time, no they didn't close yet.",
        "A: They start right away to put them to work with the Germans. They are brothers, they are not\nJews.",
        "A: Why you have to change?\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: It was different. They try and, I mean they wasn't so friendly like it used to be, they knew\nabout this, that we're going to get killed, they knew about this. And all the time, before the\nwar they didn't want us, they send us to Palestine, especially now they want us to be killed.\nTo take away everything what we had, to get rid of us, to take our houses, to take the clothes,\nto take jewelry, to take everything. We had our jewelry to hide in a place 1n our house.\nBefore the war when they came they didn't find nothing. They dig it out. And they took away\neverything. They knew about this and they used to say, \"you're going to get killed anyway,\nthe Germans will kill you\". And they did, they knew about this. They hurried and they saw\nthe digging, when they dig the graves, they saw how they getting killed. We hide the knives.",
        "A: We didn't go no place, we were sitting home most of the time. We was afraid to go, to get\nkilled. They could kill us any place and any part of the day. Let's say, I walked, you would\nsay something to them, if they didn't like, they could kill you. Who could stop them, they\ncame for this. So what kind of life, we was happy that we had something to eat. The Polish\npeople they used to come and that time, in the morning was a change with everything. We\nused to give them something, you know, like a dress or material or something for food. We\nwas starving for food already, to survive, that was the life.",
        "A: Yeah, they helped in some things, they brought food for us but it's not for nothing, we pay\nthem, it's not with money so we paid with something else, or with jewelry, or with\nsomething, clothes, stuff.",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah. When the Germans throwed us out from the houses, right away they took\neverything. They didn't take nothing what we could take.",
        "A: Yeah, it was a few people they killed. It was one person alive, homeless person, so they\nkilled him right away. And this what I remember. Maybe they killed other people too. But it\nwasn't already interested to find out because we were thinking about our lifes, that we're\ngoing to get killed soon. So it wasn't to ask who was killed or who was going to get killed\nbecause I was, we was already on the line to get killed.",
        "A: What kind plans? Not lives at all. We was thinking only that they were going to make a\nghetto and we were going to be in ghetto, but by us it was not ghetto, nght away they killed\nthe people. Like we went later to Radun and we was there living for ten months so we was\nliving there in ghetto but not like by us. We was the first one to kill. I don't know why this\nhappened right away, I have no idea.",
        "A: What happened in Ashoshok (ph) you want? When they throwed us out from the house, my\nolder sister, this one which was alive, she was alive at that time, it was before the holidays,\nshe was married shortly, and she went with her husband to his parents there for the holidays,\nSO we was home, me and my sister and my mother, my father. My father went away because\neverybody said that, \"they going to take the men, first the men, and the women, we'll see\nwhat's going to be later\". So he went away and he wasn't with us together so I was only with\nmy mother, with my sister, the younger one. And then came my husband, he was my\nboyfriend there, he was from the same town. He came and the Lithuanians with the, together\nwith the Germans, they throwed us out and they took us, they beat up my mother because\nshe wanted to take something, I don't remember, and we went there to the synagogue. From\nthe other street was my mother's family, we met them all that day there in the synagogue, we\nwas all together, we was there for two days I think, two days and two nights. They took a lot\nof people from our end of town, this calls Alkinique (ph), if you need the name, I don't think\nso, if you need the name, came people too, and we were all brought together until they took\nus on the big place, you know, on the marketplace, and from there they started shooting. So\nfirst they took the men, again, all the men, and they said that they taking them to work but\nmy father wasn't there, so they took all the men and they killed them, naturally. Then they\ncame for the women, it was like afternoon, late afternoon, and they took us all and they put\nus 1n parts, like I was with my mother, with my sister, with my grandmother, with my aunt. I\nhad three or four aunts. And soon we was starting to walk already, came this\nman, the Lithuanian man. He was a policeman. He came over to me, my husband, he wasn't\nmy husband that time, he took him also from the line from the men and he made sure that he\nkilled him. He said that he's taking him to kill him, and he let him go. So before he said to\nhim, take my girl. So he knew me because he used to come to my father, he used to do work\nfor him. So he took, because I'd be from my head, and he said, \"what are you doing here,\ncome with me\". And he took me out and he put me again on the place, on the marketplace,\nand he said to me, \"soon it's going to get dark, go away, run away from here, go wherever\nyou want to go\". He said, \"your boyfriend went away to Aladarin (ph), go also\". So when it\nwas dark, and they went away and they killed them. The whole family. So I didn't have\nnobody from my family, I took one girl, a neighbor girl, and she went with me. She left with\nher sister, mother, but then they went away too, at night. So we was walking the whole night\nand we came back to the same time. Instead to go there to Radun, we came back to\nAshoshok (ph). So one Pollack was walking in a field, you know. So I came to him and I\nsaid, \"where to go\", and he said, \"where are you going, they killed everybody in Ashoshok\n(ph), why are you going there back\"? I said, \"I don't know where to go\". He said, \"go to this\narea, go to that area\". So I was walking, both of us, and we came to Radun, we came to my\nsister there where she was. What I could do? What we can do? Always sit and play and clap,\nwe lost that. Oh god. Then my father came there, we met him, and we was all together for\nthe ten months.",
        "A: My brother was by the Germans, he was at war, when the war start, they took him to Damnia\n(ph).",
        "A: Yes. Then he was, the Polish army was nothing for them, so the Germans, the Germans took\nhim to Germany to our concentration camp and he was there, we was survived, he was\nliberated by the English army.",
        "A: In Ashoshok (ph)? No, we wasn't hiding, we was on the market, we hide everything, where\nwe could go? We couldn't go no place, and we didn't know what was going on. It was so\nstupid to believe them, that they are working. You understand, we couldn't believe that they\nwere going to kill us. Till they killed, till they killed ,",
        "A: They was working together. The Lithuanians, they helped them. The Germans was maybe\ntwo or three people all together for them. But the rest was the Lithuanians, and they was very\nbad, very bad people.",
        "A: No. No. They were Lithuanians, they came from Lithuania, we was Polish, we had the\nPollacks.",
        "A: The Pollacks, yes, yes. Some of them, they was working together with them too.",
        "A: No, I didn't hear nothing and I didn't understand nothing that time. You know, like I was, I\ndon't know from where, from another world.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, Rosh Hashanah night, they took us, supposed to be start the holidays, then they took\nus from the houses and they put us in Eshule (ph).",
        "A: 1941. After Rosh Hashanah, it's supposed to be Monday, Tuesday; Wednesday we was on\nthe place, on the marketplace, and Thursday they start killing, and Friday they finished the\nwomen. That's all, and this was the end.",
        "A: Well in Radun, we, what we did, we didn't do nothing, well the men they used to go to work\nfor the Germans, but there was a ghetto. And some of the women they used to take to work\ntoo. I didn't work, no. Then after ten months, somebody told us that this and this night, they\nwere going to start to kill the people. They were going to close up the ghetto, altogether, and\nthey were going to start to kill. So we knew about this already and at night, at night we run\naway.",
        "A: Well it was, how can I told you. We was one, two.",
        "A: Well there was four families in one house, and the house had I think, one bedroom or two\nbedrooms. We were sleeping on the floors, we were sleeping, you know, we was cooking\ntogether. It was terrible, but we were happy that we are alive. Who thought about us, who\nthink about this, that I haven't got what to eat, or it's not comfortable, or to wash ourself, to\ntake a shower. What kind of showers? What kind of baths? We washed up and that's all in\nour part, and that's it. We was happy with this what we had. As long as giving us life, we had\nthe life. It's not going to happen like in Ashoshok (ph), right away to kill. You see, we had\ntime a little bit here, to think about things. We knew about this, that they were going to kill\nhere too, but we had no choice. As long they give us life here, so we lived here, where is to\ngo? We had no place where to go. In the woods? How can you live in the woods at night, in\nday? I mean when it's cold, it's raining. We lived there, we lived like this, we went through\nthis. So we had no choice, we had to live, till it came the time when we find out that it's\ngoing to make like he was doing, he did in Ashoshok (ph), so that time we ran away. We ran\naway, our family, what there was. My father, my sister with a husband, me, my boyfriend.\nAnd we ran away, that's all. We went away to the woods and we was by Pollacks. And then\nwe came back to Radun, it's still got left a few. But we wasn't there, we was afraid to stay\nthere. And we want to hide, some day by one Pollack, by another, whoever want to keep us,\nwe stay there. We didn't have nothing, we were suffering very much. Not to have to eat, not\nto have where to sleep, so when it was warm, like in the summer time, it was okay. We was\nin the woods. We hide by the Polish people, you know, where they used to keep the horses,\nthe cows, we used to. They used to not see us, we used to come at night and go away at\nnight, otherwise they wouldn't let us stay, they were afraid, but they used to keep people too,\nwhoever paid them, whoever had a lot of money, you know, like gold. They used to take\nonly gold. So one family got killed too, they, the Pollacks killed them. He thought about this,\nwhy you have to keep them and to give them the food and to think maybe the Germans will\ncome and they will kill me, so he killed the whole family, took away everything what they\nhad, the gold, everything. And he buried them. This was a family from our town, from\nAshoshok (ph), so we was afraid too, to stay by them. But sometimes we had no choice, we\nhad to, in the winter time, what to do in the winter time? We had no clothes, we had nothing.\nBut we used to go, the men used to go to the Polish people wherever we knew them, they\nused to ask for a coat, something to wear and something to eat, they used to give us to eat,\nbecause they was afraid. They could burn him too, they did for them what they did for the\nGermans, did to us. Or what they did to us, they could do this. What we got to lose? Our life\nwas ending anyway, every minute, every minute we was thinking, not that we was thinking,\nwe was already to kill. Like it was, we was hiding by one Pollack and he knew about this,\nthat we are there. So one day the Germans came there not far away from there, came over to\nus and he said, \"you have to leave right away, in the middle of the day\". If somebody will see\nus, right away they're going to kill us. But he said, \"you have to leave with no questions\". So\nwe went in the middle of the day, we was going, where to go? One side the Germans, there\nthe Pollacks, they were going to give us out. But we had no choice, to go. We went to the\nwoods, it was not far away.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: We stopped when we went...",
        "A: We went to Radun and we was hiding every day in another place, it was a terrible time.\nNobody wants to keep us. They were afraid and they didn't want. We haven't got no money,\nwe haven't got no clothes, we haven't got nothing. So it was a very bad time, that was that\ntime. It wasn't so bad with hiding because it was warm. It was summer time because it was\nwhen we went out from Radun was in May, so we had the whole summer, so it wasn't bad,\nto stay in the woods, to go out then, like at night. But the most important was the winter,\nwhat to do for the winter, where to go, if we were going to be alive. And sure enough, we\ndecide, somebody told us, \"but in Grodno, they called the Third Reich (ph)\", that was the\nGermans called this, there the people are living a normal life, they are in the ghettos, but they\nare working and they are living in the houses, you know, they have a normal life. So we\nthought about this and we decided to go there.",
        "A: Far away. Far away from us. Like I would say from Radun to, I don't know exactly, I'd say\nlike to Washington, maybe, maybe farther away. But I can't tell you exactly, I don't know. If\nmy husband, he would tell you exactly. Well anyway, we decide to go there and so me, my\nhusband, he was a boyfriend that time, with my father, we went to Grodno, with his sister,\nmy husband's sister was with, because her husband was from Grodno. So he decided, and he\nsaid, \"we're going to go there\", and he had family there. My sister went with her husband to\nLida, it's a bigger town from Radun, they went there and we went there, so we decided like\nalso, it was in fall, fall we went there to Grodno, and we was there and warm from the\nghettos. So we was there, really they had a normal life.",
        "A: Oh, we walked a lot. Then we went by, no taxis. The most by well we went from this town, I\ndon't know. Oh, we hired a horse with a Pollack, he took us for a short time, to another town\nwhat is nearer Grodno, so he took us there. We came there, we find another one and we\nwalked a lot, and that's how we came to Grodno.",
        "A: What I saw in Grodno, I saw a little town, the ghetto, but 1t was a big town, it was a very big\ntown, in fact there was two ghettos, in one ghetto they couldn't put all the jews. So like let's\nsay, in the beginning of the town was a ghetto, and then nearer Tanko (ph), nearer Shull (ph),\nwas the other one. I never was in it, I was only in this one, in the one ghetto where we came,\nI was there all the time, with my father and then with mine boyfriend. He was mostly with\nhis sister, with the family, and we was put in a house also from the family, from their side.\nSo we was there for two months, I think, if not more a little bit, I can't give you exactly the\ntime, how long we was there. It was a good time, we had there not bad. The men, they used\nto go to work out of the ghetto, and the women, some women used to work for the Germans,\nbut I never went to work there by them, by the Germans. I was in ghetto, my father was too,\nhe didn't go to work. My boyfriend, he went, he used to go to work. And we had food, we\nhad where to sleep, alright we used to sleep on the floor because how many families in one\nhouse. But it wasn't bad, if he wouldn't start to shoot, to take it out. But there was different\nalready, there was the Jewish people was the, how they called. Well they used to organize, I\nmean with the people, to send them out to work, the Jewish people, like the Jewish\npolicemans, they had a name.",
        "A: Huguenot, right. They used to came to the Germans and ask them, we need so many and so\nmany people for work, so they used to send the people. Then when they start already, the\nliquidation in the ghetto, they used to come and they used to say, we need for today, 2000\npeople. And they used to take them to the gas chambers.",
        "A: Well we find out. We knew about this. So we find places in the ghetto where they used to\nhide. They had like bunkers, you know bunker. So one day before we find out, when my\nboyfriend went to work, they took like seven or eight people and they didn't come back to\nthe ghetto, they run away. They run away to go to the woods. But there was far away from\nthe woods, the Grodno ghetto was far away, it's not like in Ashoshok (ph), so they run away,\nthey didn't come back. So we knew already that it's time. So I find out, a bunker, and I went\nwith my father, and some of them, they didn't let us go in because they had plenty people\nthere. So I said, you must let me. If I'm going to get killed, you're going to get killed too. So\nthey had no choice, we was one and another, a bunker, how big it was. So this was one night,\nthen it was a week later, again, the Huguenot, they came, and they had to give them the\npeople, how many they wanted. And this was going on for a few weeks. So one time, we\ndidn't go to the same bunker every day. One time I find out another place where they hiding,\nso I said to my father, we're not going to this place, it's like I felt like it's no good to go. I\nsaid, \"we're going to another place\". He said to me, \"what is the difference, what makes a\ndifference, a bunker is a bunker to hide someplace\". So we went, sure enough, everybody got\nkilled in this bunker.",
        "A: By the Nazis. And the local helped them too. They helped them a lot.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. They used to stay in by the gate, there was a gate all around, you know, where\nthe people had to go to work, and where they had to come back. So there was one boy, a\nvery nice looking, very nice, beautiful looking boy. He came from work and they shot him\nwhen he had to come in, for no reason at all. You can talk to nobody, you can ask nobody\nwhy. Why is a crooked letter here, no questions. They took him, they killed him, that's it.",
        "A: Well they thought that they were going to be alive, they were going to let them leave. So\nwhenever they had to take the people, you know, the people used to cry, nobody wants to go.\nWe knew already that they take them to the gas chambers, not like here, they kill them, you\nknow, right away in the graves. They took them there. But they didn't help, they wasn't so\ngood either. Well they was fighting for their own lives, but they were wrong, they kept them\ntill they need them. What they don't need they kill, they killed everybody. So then there came\nto a point when we was in Grodno, it was one morning, I was still sleeping, and my father\nwent out, he used to get up early in the morning. He came back, and I heard already the\nshots, already. He said to me, \"my daughter\", he said, \"my child, get dressed, they killing\nalready, on the streets, they don't take like, you know, like they used to take, they're killing\non the streets\". Get dressed, that's it, this was the last word for him, and when I saw him, I\nnever saw him again. He went out through the door, that's all. I got dressed and I went out,\nand I heard people out screaming, and the shots. So I figured, where shall I go, where to go?\nBefore the war, it was a big place like near there, and they used to keep bread, bread and\nbagels, all kinds of things in a big box, like a very big box, like this, a big box. So I saw the\nbox and I figured, I'm going to go in there. I went in without anything, it was cold already, it\nwas winter, fall. But in Europe comes winter very hard, it's not like here. And there is fall\nand winter. Here is winter, summer, there 1s no fall. So I went in without, just in a dress,\nwithout anything, and I was sitting there. I didn't know what to do, my brains didn't work\nalready. Where was my father, I didn't see him, nobody's there. I heard all those screams and\ncry, that's it. This was in the day time in the morning and this was going until it got a little\ndark, it got darker, it's came the night. And it was already quiet, so I figured, everybody got\nkilled. I was the only one. What I'm going to do there? What I'm going to do, without food,\nwithout clothes, where to go? I'm afraid to go in ghetto, I'm afraid to walk, they're going to\nkill me like everybody they killed. And it was so quiet, and I don't know where to turn. The\ntown is not familiar to me, it's not like Ashoshok (ph) or Radun, where I grow up. It's\neverything 1s to me like, I don't know nobody and I don't know where to go. But then it was\nstart to be already the day time, I was there a whole day and a whole night sitting. And I\nheard like somebody's crying, so I figure, I have to get up, go out anyway sometimes, I can't\nstay here all the time, till I die there? So I went out and I saw one woman and I said to ask,\n\"from where are you coming\"? She said, everybody got killed, nobody's there. \"What are\nyou doing here\"? \"I don't know myself\", she said. I said, \"you saw somebody, some Jews\"?\nShe said, \"they're in a house, I saw a few people, they're still alive\". I went there and I met\nthe people, I met a few there, a brother and a sister. I don't remember already, there was a\nbrother and a sister, and another couple. So I went to them and they said, \"When it's going to\nget dark, very dark at night, we're going to go in\", this was still in ghetto, \"we're going to go\nin outside to Livendore (ph), we were going to get dressed. So I got dressed there, I didn't\nhave nothing, without clothes, without shoes, without anything. I wore boots I find there, you\nknow, what the people that are not there already, with a coat, with a pocketbook. And I got\ndressed and they got dressed and we was waiting till 1t get dark, and as soon it get dark, we\nwas through the window, going 1n couples, you know. To go through the window, to go\noutside the ghetto, and to reach where to go. To go out from the ghetto, and to go out from\nthe town. So as soon, I think I got the third or the fourth, I don't remember exactly, and right\naway I got caught. I got caught, he was a policeman working for the Germans, a Pollack, a\nPolish man. And he said, \"I have to take you to the gestapo\". I said, \"why, why you have to\ntake me? They should kill me, why? What you going to have from this? Listen, I don't have\nnothing, just this what I have on me. I have the coat and I have the boots, and that's all what I\ngot\". I said, \"no money, no clothes, no nothing\". I'm going to leave\", I said, \"you know\nwhat's going on, maybe you did the same thing to them, but what you going to have for this?\nIf they're going to kill me, you going to have on your mind your whole life because you\npersonally took me there. When they took all of them, it's different than when you're taking\none person. I am still so young, what can I give you. If you want I can take off my boots to\ngive you, my coat, and let me go. Let me live, let me go, think about this\". So I don't know,\nmaybe, and I spoke rather nice Polish, and maybe he realized, I don't know, he had a pity on\nme, whatever. I don't know what to say. And Polish he said to me, \" \". This\nmeans, run away. \"Run away , quick, I shouldn't see you\". I start to run but then\nI figure it's no good to run, people going to think, it's going to be, maybe it's a Jew. I put ona\nkerchief, they shouldn't see right away, maybe. They recognized when I talked, they couldn't\nrecognize that I'm a Jewish girl. But you can think about this, you know, you never know,\nand there was very bad people, the Pollacks and the Germans, very bad. Right away, as soon\nas they saw a Jewish person, they give to the Germans, to the gestapo. And I was walking,\nand I don't know where I'm going, where I'm going, I'm still in the town. I have to leave the\ntown, it's night time. So I was going and it start like to snow a little bit, snowing. So I figured\nit's snowing, it's dark, maybe they wouldn't recognize me if I stop to talk to them, to ask\nthem. And I had idea how to go out from the town but I didn't know which way. So I stopped\none Polish woman and I asked her where to go to this place. She told me and I went there.\nAnd I went and I was walking a whole night not knowing where to go and where I'm going\nto go.",
        "A: They got killed. They all got killed, nobody was alive. I was the only one. There was, I think\nthree couples, yeah. I was the only one. I don't know why and I'll never know.",
        "A: I don't know because I can't tell you because I left. I think not, they didn't got killed right\naway because I knew for myself because he wanted to take me, he didn't kill me right away.\nHe wanted to take me to the gestapo. So I figure that somebody took them too, to the\ngestapo. They didn't kill them right away, on the place. And then I was going and thinking to\nmyself, what to do? God, where shall I go? What to do? If to go to a Pollack, some on the\nway where I walk, they were going to kill me right away because there was bad people. I\ndidn't sleep, I was tired. I was hungry, I wanted to have a little bit water. Where to go, what\nto think. And I was thinking that where I was going, and this time I saw how far away I was,\nwith a slight, because there was snow already, it was winter. And there was going by the\nboth sides, two people, three people. So I was thinking, this can't be the Germans, this 1s all\nthe Pollacks, probably the Pollacks. But I had no choice, I had to go, I had to walk. And I see\nthey coming to me, they coming, they coming. So I took more the kerchief around my head\nand then they was so near to me, they stopped, and they stopped me. And they asking me,\nthey couldn't think that this was a Jewish girl, they thought maybe it's a Polish going from\none house to the other one, to somebody. And they said in Polish, they asking me \"where are\nyou going\"? So the other man came over and he said to me, called me my name. \"You're\nalive, you going from Grodno ghetto\"? So I said, \"yes\". They was going, they are the\npartisans, they had a rifle with them, they had two, in fact they had two rifles. And they were\ngoing to Grodno, to ghetto, to take out one person, they was going to take out his mother and\nthe sister.",
        "A: From Grodno ghetto? When? This was probably in the beginning of '43, early '43. Early '43\nand it was winter time, that makes sense.",
        "A: I knew his plans, he told me from before. That they were planning on running away from\nwork, they were going to go out from ghetto, they were going to go to work, and from there\nthey were going to run away, to go to the partisans, to meet him, but it's a long way they\nhave to go. \"I don't know what you are going to do, try, try\". \"How, and when\", I said, \"I\ndon't know, this we're going to see\". I think that's all.",
        "A: If I knew them?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: They recognized me and then I recognized them because I had my head down, I was afraid\nto keep up my head and to look at them. And when they recognized me, then I pick up my\nhead and I saw them, and I recognized them too. And they ask me where I was going. They\nknew that I was in Grodno ghetto. I said, \"I don't know where I'm going, where you are\ngoing\"? They said, \"we was planning on going to the ghetto and take out my mother, my\nsister, and other people\". I said, \"It's no use to go to the ghetto, nobody's there already, I was\nprobably the last one\". So they figured, and one, a sister with a brother was with me, but they\nhad to, when I went out from the ghetto, there were two in the group with me, but where they\nare now, I said, \"I don't know, they probably went, they took them to the gestapo\". I had\nluck, I don't know how. I had this luck, what I'm now alive. So they recognized and they\nknew that I'm so tired and hungry.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: No, I'm talking about this ghetto where I was, I don't know nothing about the other ghetto,\nnothing at all.",
        "A: So when I met the people, and they was going to the Grodno ghetto to take out the family. So\nI told them that I was probably the last one, I was with a sister and brother together, with\nthem, and they supposed to go also, to run away because in ghetto, nobody was left around,\nonly a few people, these people what I met, and I was lucky that I met them because\notherwise I wouldn't know where to turn and probably I would be killed, some place or in\nghetto, whatever. So I told them what happened with me, with this policeman, what he was\nworking for the gestapo and he wanted to take me. I told them the whole story and I said,\n\"they let me go\", and the rest ones, I said, \"they probably not out\". If they would be out from\nthere, if they would be alive, they would be on the same place where I start to walk, on the\nsame way, to walk I mean, on the same way. But nobody showed up. And then we heard that\nthe people there, the Pollacks, they was talking, that nobody's in ghetto already, and there 1s\nno ghetto. So we went with Pollack to a house and with them, they took me. They occupied\nlike the house, they didn't let nobody, they knew that these is partisans, they didn't let nobody\nto go out, whoever came, a neighbor or somebody, whoever came to the house, they let them\nin, but they didn't let them out. They supposed to stay till the night, till we're going to leave,\nthen they can leave. So the first thing what I had was food because I was hungry, for two\ndays and two nights I didn't eat. I didn't sleep, and they said, \"you got to sleep\", and they was\nstaying, you know, all the time watching. Because if they would let them out, we would be\nalready by the Germans, they would kill us.",
        "A: Which neighbors? The neighbor, when they came in, one person came in so he saw already,\nhe knew who we were, that's all. They said to him, \"you sit down or lay down, do whatever\nyou want, but you're not opening up the door and you're not going out, until we're going to\nleave\". So sure enough, I went to sleep and they were standing the whole day watching if\nsomebody's coming, or the Germans, you never know. Alright, they didn't have no\ntelephones, they had no communication with them, what to do. They had to go by\nthemselves, you know, to tell that this and this happened and there is partisans, whatever.\nWhen it came at night we left from there, we left to go back, they didn't go already to the\nghetto because they heard from the Polish people too. We went to go to the woods, you\nknow, it wasn't so easy to go because on the way was like Germans standing and Pollacks. It\nwas a Separation between Grodno and the other towns. So they had to go all alone, they\nknew already, they were partisans, and they knew how to go and they took me, you know,\nthey were walking and I was on the sled with the horse. We walked a lot too. And the whole\nnight we was traveling like this, and when it start to be already, we was near the pusha (ph),\nnatcha (ph) pusha (ph), this is the name. A pusha (ph) means the woods there. We came\nthere and I met my boyfriend, my husband and I met other people, what I knew them,\neverybody what I knew, but they weren't in the Grodno ghetto.",
        "A: Well I knew, when I met these people they told me that he's there. So it started another life, a\nnew life. So we start there and it was winter time. They had already a place what they built\nby themselves, you know, a place for winter because winter time you can't go out, right away\nyou can see that people are walking in the woods and from the woods, and they had to\nprepare food. They prepared food and they prepared everything. And when it came, it was\nalready spring time. And we heard about, that the Germans, they are planning to look for the\npartisans in the pusha (ph), so we had to leave. We had to leave the hiding place, the bunker\nwhere we was all winter. We had to leave this and we went far away from there from this\nplace, but we went to the pusha (ph), to the natcha (ph) pusha (ph) for the\nwhere it's more like woods.",
        "A: Yes, most of the time, yeah.",
        "A: It's hard to explain but in my own words I'll try to explain to you. Those people where they\nwere before me, they prepared for the winter, food. They prepared like potatoes, let's say,\nmeat. It was cold, you know, outside, freezing, snow up to here. So they prepared food\nbecause we couldn't go out, if we would go out, right away you can see the footsteps, you\nknow. That's why we was afraid to go out for something. We was living there, whatever we\nhad, it was okay, good, good enough. As long we can survive.",
        "A: Yeah, we cooked.",
        "A: It was very small, how can I?",
        "A: It was there, maybe 20 people, ten couples for sure.",
        "A: No, no children.",
        "A: At night we used to go out, but not far from the place, say near the place because we was\nafraid for the footsteps.",
        "A: Yes. At night we used to go out, to fresh up a little bit.",
        "A: What kind bathroom? The woods, we was living in the woods.",
        "A: We talk about what to do later on. To go out, to go to the woods or to stay, what to do. We\ndidn't have to think about what to do, we did it, we have to leave the bunker, but it was\nalready spring time, it was nice. As soon as we find out that they are planning to search, to\nlook for us, for the partisans, we left the bunker and we went to the woods.",
        "A: There was another group partisans, there was what I told you, the men.",
        "A: Yes. This was the other group, without women, only men. And there was Russian people\ntoo. Russian and our people. But they knew too, about us. They had a lot of guns and rifles,\nthose people. We had too, but very little, you know. So they went too, there to the pusha\n(ph), the same thing. But what they did, the Germans, they had other plans to look over, and\nthen they had like a chain like, you know, a lot of Germans with Pollacks, with Lithuanians,\nall of them. And they used to go through the pusha (ph) to find, to look for the people, to\nlook for us. We had no choice where to go. We was sitting near, it was woods, a lot, very\nclose one to another. We was sitting there, me, my husband, my boyfriend that's my\nhusband, my sister, and my brother-in-law. We were sitting like from one side and from the\nother side was another group, three people. Woman with a husband, with a sister. Three\npeople. And we heard that the Germans are there, and they killed them, and we were sitting\nhere. It was like now, I'm talking like an electric storm goes through my body and we was\nonly praying, God help us. They got killed and they went away. They figure that no more is\nin this side, they went, they killed a lot of people that time.",
        "A: Well she came also, she came also from Lida ghetto, have you heard of Lida? She came\nthere too to the partisan. Yeah. You ask me how my sister came? So she came also from,\nsomebody took her out from the group, from our group, and took her too, there to the\npartisan and we was together. So then we picked up ourselves, where to go again, we had no\nplace where to go. The partisans, they was only the men. They wouldn't take us. We went\nagain to the partisan, they had, you know, rifles, they had guns, they had everything and\nthere was a but they didn't want us. So we went far away, we was going again\nto the Pollacks, maybe they were going to take us for a day or two or something, you know.\nAnd this was going on for the whole summer, until the winter came. Then we was thinking\nwhat to do, where to go. We had a Pollack, this was my brother , but he knew\nhim. We went to him, we went to him and he ask him, he said to him, \"listen, you have to do\nsomething, let us go in, it's winter time, we have no place where to go\". So it was like, he\nsaid, \"alright, you can stay by me for a little while, then I'm going to build for you a place in\nthe woods not far from my house and you're going to stay there for winter\". And he was\nalready belonged to the White Pollacks and he was together with them working. By then\nthey was looking for Jews, to kill them because they wanted, they knew that a lot of Jews\nsurvived after the war from the Nazis, but they don't want should be Jews by the Polish.",
        "A: No, no, this wasn't an army, this was an organization. After the war they made the\norganization, calling themselves White Pollacks.",
        "A: No, I don't think so. They wanted a clean Poland. Poland should be cleaned without Jews,\nand they looked only for the Jewish people. So we was by then, I don't remember exactly\nhow long, but we was by him a short time, and one night he came over and he said, \"you\nknow what, I feel like you should go out\". This was winter time, we didn't go out, he used to\nbring us food. And he used to come, so he came for us and he said, \"let's go to my house, I\nhave prepared a dinner for you, for all of you\". We was so happy to go out and to go to a\nhome, to a house. And really he prepared a dinner for us and we was sitting around the table\nand we just start to eat and we heard the door got so opened up like this, and they start to\nshoot. They start to shoot, we got so scared. I don't know how many people there were, the\nPolish people but right away one of us, we was in this bunker by this Pollack, we was six\npeople, other boys. So one boy probably, he took from him, how was it I don't know because\nit got dark right away. When he shoot, he probably shoot both of them.",
        "A: I don't know where I left.",
        "A: Yeah, the open the door, I'm getting lost when I start to talk like this. And they started\nshooting. And both of them, probably one boy, I don't remember. I think we had a gun or\nsomething we had in the bunker. And he shoot somebody, one of the White Pollacks, and he\nstart to be quiet. It was quiet and nobody was there, they ran away. They got scared and they\nran away. So my husband and my brother-in-law and the other two, they went away. So\nonly me with my sister, what to do, we was staying there, we didn't know what to do. So\nthere was the Polish, the Pollacks, they had big stoves, like a oven, a big oven, and under the\noven they used to have chickens there to raise them. So I said to my sister, \"let's go there\".\nAnd we went there where the chickens was, and it was so high, and we were staying there\nuntil we didn't hear nothing, it was so quiet. So I said to my sister, \"what are we going to do\nthere, let's run\". This was in the middle of the night. It was a frosty night, it was so cold. I\nwas only in one dress, my sister too. And I said, \"we have to run\". We open up a window\nand we went out. We saw, you know, it was a winter night, a frosty night and it was so light,\nlike we saw them from far away. So I said to my sister, \"Jet's run there, probably this was our\npeople\". We ran away, we met my brother-in-law with my husband and here was the cloth\nby him, the blood, you know, was egging, like somebody hit him over the head with a rifle,\nhit him over the head hear and the blood was coming, it was freezing, you know, on him.\nWhat are we going to do, where were we going to go, who knows that you're going to leave?\nNobody knows, you know, knew about this because he had the open head in the back. So he\nsaid, my husband said, \"let's go to this and this Pollack, he's more richer one, maybe he going\nto let us in for the time being, for the night\". So we went in to him and he saw what the blood\nis running from him, and we went away from the White Pollacks, he let us in. He didn't let us\nin the house, God forbid. He let us in where the horses are standing with the cows, but we\nwere happy. We was laying around, you know, my husband, because he was so hurt and the\nblood was running from him. The blood got freezed on him. And take a look, nothing\nhappened to him and nothing happened to us. As long they didn't kill us, didn't happen,\nnothing. We had no sickness, nothing at all. So it came in the day time and he said, \"you\nknow I can't keep you, I would keep you, I'm not sending you now, I know what it is in the\ndaytime, but at night you have to go away\". So where to go? Alright, food he gave us there\nin the place. He gave us an old smock to wear, he sold us. And we went away to another\nPollack, he was living with a sister and with a nephew. They weren't married, they had no\nfamily, only three of them. We went to them and he saw us and he knew us, he knew my\nbrother-in-law more than us because my brother-in-law, they had a store in Radun and he\nused to come there.",
        "A: Yeah, we went to him, this was already at night. We went to him and we asked him, we\nstopped to talk to him and he promised him, he knew him, that he had a store. That if he had\na store, he must have money, he must have clothes, he must have a lot of things. But he told\nhim, \"we have nothing now\". He told us that, \"it's near the war, we're going to finish soon\".\nHe said, \"let us go into you, take us\". He had like a PD (ph), and he took us there, he took us\nin. So he let us in, 10n the beginning we was by him also, in the, I don't know how they call,\nwhere the horses, where the cows are staying. So we was there for a short time. Then he took\nus and he make us a place upstairs his house, there. It was like a room, a little room, and we\nwere six people there in the room. But he gave us food, he was good to us and every day he\nused to tell us that nobody knew about us, nobody knows, nobody knows nothing.",
        "A: Yeah, and he used to tell us all the time, he used to go to the church and there you listen to\nthe people what they saying, that it's going to be the end of the war, soon, soon it's going to\nbe the end. He used to come and tell us everything. And then one day he came and he said,\n\"they saying\", we was by him probably two or three months. He kept us and he feed us\neverything. So he came and he said, somebody told him in church that he has Jewish people.\nSo he came and he told us, he said, \"you know what, I kept you all the time, I can't keep you\nall the time now. From now on, you have to leave. Because what is the use if people know\nalready, they find out, so I'm going to get killed, and you're going to get killed. You better\nfind a place and go away. Find a place, where is the place? But thank God it was already\nspring time. It was already warm, so we had one way, to go to the woods, and this what we\ndid. At night time we left him and we went away. We went away to the woods. And there\nalready it was May, I think. In May it was warm already. Went away in the woods and we\nwas staying there. At night we used to go out to take for food nearby, you know. Not nearby\nbut far away. And there we met other people where they was staying, you know, with\nfamilies. So we were happy already, we met other people. And we used to have, you know, a\nconnection with the Pollacks. They used to say, they used to talk to us saying that the war is\nnear, near to the end, and this was the end really. On July the Russian came in and we was\nfree after this. We was free where to go. We went to Ashoshok (ph).",
        "A: We was in the woods, came in, the Russian on a horse, on the horses. We recognized them\nthat they were Russians. But we were scared, we didn't know who are these. So they start to\ntalk to us, \"We are Russian, you're going to be free now, the war has ended, you come out.\nCome out. Don't be afraid, come out, go home. Go wherever you want to go, you are free\u201d.\nThat's what he's saying. But we was in the beginning when we saw them, we recognized\nthem that they are Russians, but still we didn't know, you know. They fright in us, the scared\nwas in us, we was afraid. But when they start to talk like this, \"go out, don't be afraid,\nnobody they will do to you something, nobody. We have freed you, go on, go\". We went and\nwe went right over to Ashoshok to our town, nobody was there, the houses was there. I went\nto my house. There was Pollacks leaving, and I was afraid to go in. You know, it was a big\nhouse, and our big table was standing. My father was a tailor, he was a heavy man.\nwas a wooden floor, and he was standing on one place. So he was like, how to\nsay to, like dan (ph), it was the woodan (ph), and I saw the place, you know. I went away\nfrom there, and I never wanted to go to my house where I was born and raised and I lost the\nfamily. So we was a few couples. So we was a few couples, and there was, we find out,\nYaffa's (ph) family came.",
        "A: Yaffa (ph) Helia (ph), she was there with the family, with her family, and they was living in\ntheir house, in their own house. So we went to a house nearby, not far away, to my husband's\ncousin, he had a big house, because I didn't want to go to his house and I didn't want to go to\nmy house. So we went there, and we was staying there until we, you know, we met the\nPolish people and they start to talk about everything, what they saw, how all of them got\nkilled, and how they robbed everything, and now they sitting in our houses. And then we\nstart to think what to do, you know, we have to start to work. So my husband went to work,\nhe was as a baker. By then was, they had, his mother used to bake. So he went to a Pollack to\nwork for him, and he worked for a little. Then we was living there, we was thinking what to\ndo, where to go, how to establish our lives. In meantime we heard that the White Pollacks,\nthey are coming to our town. So my husband and the other couple said, \"what they going to\ndo, what? It's after the war, what they going to do\"? So I said, \"they are coming, they said the\nWhite Pollacks are coming, they're going to kill us\". And sure enough. So before this night,\nthis has to happen before the , | said to my husband, \"I'm going there to Yaffialia\n(ph), to this family, I'm afraid to stay there, after all there is a family and he knows where are\nthe people\". But I went with another of the couples, what we are staying together with\nanother person. We went there, we came to them, to this family. And we was waiting, they\nare coming or not? We wasn't sure, but the Pollacks, they said that they are going to come.\nAnd sure enough, they came. It was at night time and they came and they open up like this,\nthe door, and they came in and I heard, and we was on the second floor. There was a house, a\ntwo-family house. It's not really a two family, but they had bedrooms upstairs, and\ndownstairs they had a kitchen, they had everything, you know, in the house. \"We heard\", I\nsaid to the other person, Esther, \"you heard, I heard the shotting there\", and sure enough,\nthey shot her mother, the baby she had on her hands, and they shot them. So I said to her,\n\"they're going to shot us too\". I opened up the door and I jumped from the second floor and I\nsaid, \"it's no use to stay there because they're going to kill us, and we're going to run away,\nwe have a choice\". And sure enough, we run away. I said, \"so I'm going to break a leg, I'm\ngoing to break something, but I'm going to be alive still\". But they didn't come upstairs. We\nran away. They killed the mother with the baby and they went away.",
        "A: This was October, 1944, October the 20th, I think.",
        "A: After, after we find out. How do I know, I run away, I didn't know nothing. I thought that\nthey going to, they killed everybody, the whole family.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, I didn't hear them talking. First of all, we was on second floor, I couldn't hear talking\nthem. But we ran away, I ran, I don't know. I don't know where really. But I heard already\nthat it's quiet. I went home, there to my husband, and he find out already, he came there to\nthe house to find out, because I was there, that they killed the mother and the baby. And this\nwas, that's all, this was the end. After the war, after getting through so much in their lifes,\nand she had the baby there in a bunker, maybe you know about this? No, she didn't tell you\nYaffialia (ph)?",
        "A: You tell me.",
        "A: What do you mean, \"how do I know are they Polish\"? Who could come to kill, who could\ncome in the middle of the night to kill people? Only the White Pollacks. We knew already,\nsomebody from the Pollacks told us, they are planning to come to kill us. We didn't think\nabout this, why they should come to kill us, why, what for? They took away everything\nalready from us, we didn't have nothing, why they should kill us? You see, if we would take,\nwe believed them, the Pollacks what they was saying, we would run away, naturally. But we\ncouldn't believe them, why they should do this? We didn't take nothing from them, why they\nshould do this?",
        "A: Yeah, and just some little people, what they were nice. But the most, the most were bad.\nThey took our houses right away, they took everything, whatever have got left. You know,\nliving there for generations, for generations. I had a grandfather, a grandmother, a mother.\nYou know, so there must be something, they had something. So how can be, how can they\nbe nice to us, and be polite to us, and help us, they didn't want us. So these few people, what\nthey've got left, they wanted to kill too, and they killed. And you heard what had happened in\nKent, so that happened there too, and they killed a lot of people.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: That's all.",
        "A: So we went there and we tried to find work, it was very hard to. It was Russian people, and\nLithuania. We didn't know the language, not none of them. But we tried, you know. My\nhusband went to work, he was a tailor, so he find work. And I went to work as a waiter, but I\ndidn't know the language. I used to, they used to come to order, a order, I used to write in\nPolish. But the sentence that came out, Polish words but they came out in Russian, you\nunderstand? I used to go in the kitchen to order the food, and this way I start to learn the\nlanguage. I used to come home and read and, you know, I tried the best only through. And in\nthe beginning it was very hard but they liked me there, and I learned. And then I worked as\na, later on already I worked as a, what do you say, as I gave orders already. You know, and I\nlearned the language and I start to work, and it wasn't so bad, I had good. And I got pregnant,\nin 1950 I gave birth to my daughter and I had in the house always there, you know, a\nwoman. Until they start to talk to go away from Russia. You know, it was a hard life, but in\nLithuania it was easier, the life. They start to take out people, you know, where they used to\nwork, where they had, where they was reached. But they come out to bring them on the\nSiberia, you know. This was a killing too, on the Siberia. Till they opened up with the Polish,\nthey wanted all the Polish people what they've got left, they want them in Poland. And the\nRussian, they let them out, so right away, soon it was this, you know. But then in the papers,\non the radio I heard this. So right away, I said to my husband, \"we have to leave, there's no\nfuture in here\".",
        "A: I don't know really, not bad. I worked with a Lithuanian, one person, a few of them. They\nwasn't so bad, no I wouldn't say.",
        "A: That could be. Could be, they can find all the time, any time. And this was why we were\nafraid. That's why we wanted to get out of there. But usually we was, it wasn't so bad to live\nthere. I was working, my husband worked. We made a lot, I didn't have to stand in line for\nbread, for other things. I used to get easy where I worked, you know. So it wasn't so hard. So\nit wasn't so bad. This was the only thing what I was afraid, they shouldn't send us to Siberia.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The director, he was a Jew too, but they didn't speak no Yiddish. He understood, he knew\nwhat I went through and a lot of things I learned from him. He was very nice, in fact when I\nleft, I came and I said to him, \"I have to leave, I'm going away, I'm going to Poland\". I didn't\nsay that I'm going to Israel, I want to go to America. This I couldn't mention, God forbid. So\nI said, \"I'm going away, there 1s, got left from the war, from the family\". I have to go there.\nHe used to say to me, \"why? Take a look you have a good position, you're working, you\nhave everything, whatever you need, why you should go away? Why\"? All the time. \"You're\nnever going to find a life like this\". Sure, I'm never going to find a life like this. To live, to go\nto sleep and to think that maybe somebody knocks on door to take us out and to take us to\nSiberia. For no reason at all. And if I worked, I was afraid at work too. They could put you in\njail for a little nothing. For the littlest nothing. Maybe somebody could say one word on you,\nthat's 1t. This would be enough.",
        "A: Doesn't matter.",
        "A: Yeah, I'm going to go into Poland just to go through to Poland, not to stay there, not to live\nthere. I was in Poland, in Russia, for two months I think, then I left for Israel.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Sure. There was first of all, to Russia to go because we was born and raised, so we could go.\nThey let us go. Understand, we was born, and we had to go to Moscow to take out some\npapers. But we are, we are really Polish people, we was born there and raised there, so they\nlet us go, the Russians. And we think in Poland, we could stay there, they didn't throw us out.\nThey gave us food too. They was very nice there, but we was afraid to stay there. And we\nwas trying to go away.",

        "A: I couldn't have the letters by me, so she used to write in the postal center, they used to call, if\nyou're familiar with this. So I used to come in the post office and I used to take out a letter. I\nwas afraid to read there in the building, I used to go around where I didn't see people. And I\nused to read and cry a lot. And I used to tear it in little, little pieces, that's all. And I couldn't\nanswer her, I was afraid because they can come at night and take me out, that's all, take\naway. You know, before Stalin died, he had a plan to take out all the Jews, to take them to\nSiberia and to freeze them there. Not to kill them like the Germans did, but he would freeze\nthem. Because there it's so cold that you can't go out. And he would keep us in a place like\nthis where there's no eat, no nothing, and he would kill all the Jews. So I was all the time,\nyou know, my daughter was born in 1950 and this was in 1953 before he died. So he had this\nplan and they had to start already. And we didn't know what to do, again. It was worse, but\nlike this we had a good life, but we had no future and we was afraid for tomorrow. So when\nhe died he didn't have too much time because he died in 1953 and there was, then was other\npeople took over and the other people was very good, very good to everybody, and we had a\ngood life. Till then I start to write letters to my sister, and she start to write to me, to answer\nme. But to go out it was out of the question, we couldn't go out never, never in life. But then\nwhen they changed, when came the other people in Stalin's place, so they letted out the\nPolish people to go to Poland. This way we went to Poland. And from Poland I wrote\nalready my sister, she knew already that I'm there. I called her, I made a call on her\ntelephone, you know, she should pay. And then she start to take us from Poland to America,\nto United States. But after a little while she find out that she can't take us all, it has to be one\nperson and this is going to take a long, long time until we're going to get the visa. So I said to\nher, and that time they said, \"whoever wants to go to Israel can go free\". So I said to my\nhusband, \"whether it's going plane or it's going a ship, we are going, we are not staying here\nin Poland with the Polish people\". And this what we did. So I didn't wait for my sister till she\nwas going to do everything. We went to Israel, at least I'm safe there, I have got a life. It was\na hard time. It was after a war, we had seen, it was a war, it was very hard. Everything was\nlike you had to get, like for food, you know. It was hard to get to work, everything was hard.\nAnyway my sister helped me, she send me money, she send me packages, and she helped me\na lot. Till she's this was in '57 when we came to Israel, 1957. So it was till\n1959, till my sister made out the papers for us, for all of us. In the beginning she could only\ntake one person, me with my daughter or my husband. I didn't want to leave my husband. Or\nhe didn't want to leave me. So I said to her, I was that we're not going to leave.\nIf to go, to come to you, only all of us. Otherwise we're going to stay in Israel. Now is a bad\ntime but we're going to get through this. We had hard times a lot in our lives, we get through\nthis too. But the only thing, that we are free, we are with Jews, I'm not afraid that they're\ngoing to kill me, that I'm a Jew. Everybody's there, the Jews, but the Arabs, nobody was\nafraid for the Arabs there, that time. Even now, they're not afraid for them. Whatever's going\nto happen's going to happen. But it's our land, it's our place, it's our home. And the biggest\nmistake what I did in my life is when I came here to this country. Maybe God punished me\nfor this. What I went through here, a lot of trouble. And there maybe I would avoid\neverything and wouldn't come to me so much trouble as it came here. I left because I wasn't\nafraid that 1t was a hard time. My husband went to work, and he work, he could work. He\nwent, he never had this, he never worked on this work what he went on, construction.\nAnything. We went there to the people, they're called Sokinote (ph), where they're giving\nspecialty places, you know, office where they're giving fair to work. So they said, on person\nwas sitting, like a heavy man, he said, \"I have all of this work, I can't give you no other one, I\ndon't have it\". So this is the only thing, my husband took the work and the only thing what I\nsaid to him, I said, \"how many times we have to get through everything, to start from the\nbeginning\". And that's what start. We had our home, like they gave us, the government, we\nhad to pay a certain amount money, and they build specially homes for the new come in, and\nwe had already established. I had two bedrooms, and I was so happy, and I was planning to\ngo to work because I couldn't, then my daughter went to school and I was planning to go to\nwork. I could work in these places, you know, as a waiter, I knew already the work. And the\nlanguage, it wasn't for me like it was here, I knew a little bit but I forgot, you know, when I\nwas a child I was. But my daughter went to school and she start to talk right away in\nHebrew, in fact she went to the second grade, and they were happy and I was happy with\nthem. Then all of a sudden came the visa with my sister. I was so unhappy to leave. I left\nonly because I had my sister here, otherwise I would never, never in my life. Here start\nagain, you know. All those with hard times, with everything. Alright, I came to my sister and\nI had by her, I was by her for 11 months, not quite a whole year. I gave birth to my son, and\nwas blessed by her in the house, you know, in 1959. And I wasn't happy, I was unhappy. I\ndidn't have my place. When I start to look for my own place, for apartment, where I used to\ngo, nobody wants me. With two children nobody wants. Nobody wants me. Till I find an\napartment, and my sister used to say, \"why you want to go out\"? It was no good, she was our\nfamily. Like, she had one child only. She had a brand new house, just bought it. When I\ncame, she just moved in. And I didn't feel like to stay there, you know, with a baby. So I\nused to go to find an apartment. One day I went and I find apartment there, it wasn't so nice\napartment. From there she moved out, she left me her apartment, when I'm going to come?\nAnd she paid for a month rent, that time it was $50 rent, you know, in 1959. So I came and I\nwas pregnant, and this was on the third floor or on the fourth floor, I don't remember. And I\nwent there, you know, with my big belly and I saw and there was already Shlowtsy (ph), you\nknow, the blanket people around. And as soon I came out. So my sister said, she saw already\nI mean, I started crying. I said, \"I left a beautiful home, my beautiful house and I was so\nhappy there, why I came here, to climb on the fourth floor\"? I said, \"with a, is going to be\nborn a little baby\"? So she said, \"you don't have to take, you don't have to, you have a place.\nWe're going to find another place, don't worry\".",
        "A: So then I was looking and looking. Finally I find a place where they let me in, and I said to\nmy sister, she didn't know about this place and I gave the deposits right away. She went\naway and took our deposits, she didn't like the apartment. I had to put in money there, it\nwasn't so nice, she didn't like it. So then we start to look around her. And I find apartment,\nthis was a walk-in apartment. In the beginning she didn't want it also, my sister. But she said,\n\"alright, this one is more like it, okay, you're near me and you'll be with the children,\nwhatever\". She took my daughter to school, you know.",
        "A: Well I was with a little baby. I couldn't go to work, I couldn't help my husband. He was\nworking for three years day and night, you know, to, he saw that nobody wants us in\napartment, we have to buy something for ourselves. So it was a hard time, I can't say it was\nlight. But thank God, I find an apartment by older people, in a walk-in. They let me in with\nthe two children, and that time I didn't have no television, no nothing. You know, my sister\ngave me a bed and she gave me, you know, I didn't have nothing. Like a table, chairs, to eat,\non what to eat. Well she gave me a lot of stuff so I had, then little by little I bought it for\nmyself. I buyed one piece here or one piece there. And I was there for four years.",
        "A: The difficult was, without a language, without money, without everything. We had nobody,\nonly my sister. This was the only help, what I had from my sister. Otherwise, my daughter\nused to come from school, she used to make the homework, and she used to cry, and I was\ncrying with her. \"Why you came here, why you came here, what made you to come here?\nYou don't live with your sister anyway in one house, why you came here? We had already\neverything there, and there was all the Jews. Why you came here, to put me again with other\npeople, I mean non Jews\". All aggressions it was all the time, for the longest time I\nremember. And I used to curse myself what I did, but there was no way to go back. We had\nto do it. I said to my husband, \"we start and we have to finish, and we have to raise the\nchildren, and we have to go on with our lives. Otherwise what it's going to be\"? Then I went\nwhen he was already three years old. My daughter used to come from school at 3:00, I used\nto go at 4:00 at work. I used to work in a factory for chuckalud (ph), the second shift. So I\nused to work.",
        "A: Very hard, very hard. To start from the beginning, how many times you can start? How\nmany times? I was 37 years old when I came here and I gave birth to my son. It's a good\nremembering, you know, my whole life. He was born in March and I came in February, just\nin the same day. I came February the sixth, March the sixth he was born. This time to get to,\nto be in hospital for a whole week and talk to the walls. This was good?",
        "A: Well I have a very hard character. And really, I'm not afraid, I'm on?",
        "A: I'm not afraid for anything. Shut it off a little.",
        "A: Yeah, very.",
        "A: I don't think so, when I was a child it was nothing specially. We was growing up, till I was,\nbut I don't think I didn't went through nothing specially like. I remember when my\ngrandfather died, this I remember. I was staying with him. He had a stroke. Nobody knew\nwhat it was. When he was sick, I used to come and gave him water, you know, but the mouth\nwas on the side. To this day, what I remember when I was a child. Otherwise, nothing.",
        "A: When my sister went to school. In Europe they used to start when you were seven years old.\nI was not quite six years, I was five and three quarters, something like this. So I said, I start\nto cry when she went to school. So I said to my mother, \"I want to go to school too\". So I\nremember, my mother said, \"let her go, let her go. She'll be able to go, to make homework,\nlet her go\". I was crying, and I wanted to go, and I went. And I went and I was staying at\nschool with her, with my sister, and we was together all the years through the school. In fact,\nwhen we was in the fifth grade, my sister got sick and she couldn't go to school no more, and\nI went and I finished seven classes.",
        "A: I wasn't so bad. I wasn't too, I mean I didn't gave her a hard time, my parents like naughty\nchildren giving hard times. I never heard of this and I raise like this, my children. They never\nsaid to me, \"no\", or \"I want to do this and I'm going to do it\". And I used to say, \"no way\".",
        "A: We do pay attention, we do. We used to pray and ask God, he should help us. But then, what\nwe could do? Nothing to do. Why God punish us? Why is God on their place, on the non\nJews place, on the non Jews side, not on our side. What we did wrong? We kept strictly,\nthere was nothing non kosher, I didn't heard this after the war. But before the war, where I\nwas raised in a house, I never heard of this non kosher things, or to do something on\nSaturdays. We never heard of this.",
        "A: During the war was a different thing.",
        "A: We knew a little, like Yom Kippur, you know, Yom Kippur, you're not allowed to eat. So we\nwas counting, that it has to be this time, let's say tomorrow. And we had this week before, we\nhad a mistake. So twice we didn't eat, we prayed but we didn't have no books to pray. But\nwhat is the holidays, what is this? What is everything there, where was our God? Where was\nour God? To listen to little babies crying, to be taking away mothers, I mean kids, babies\nfrom mothers. You have to give away your baby to kill them? It's not heard. It was in Spain\nInquisition, you heard about this? I suppose you learn about this. But years and years ago,\nmaybe 2000 years ago, so they killed people because they are Jews. They had a choice, they\ncould get to be non Jews if they wanted to leave. But they didn't want it. So they burned\nthem, you know about this. But we didn't have no choices, we are a Jew, you are a Jew, you\nhave to be killed, that's it. No pity from nobody, from nobody.",
        "A: Sometimes, sometimes. You know, some girls, I had a friend, Pollack took her, and he raised\nher. She wasn't the same age as I am, as I was. He kept her the whole war. She used to go to\nchurch, she used to pray there. She used to do things whatever he said, whatever he told her.\nAnd she was as a Polish girl. After the war, she came in Ashoshok (ph), to our town, with\nthis man. He was a older man already, and she went back to him. That time soldiers came in\nour town, came a soldier, a young boy. And somebody told him that in this and this, down\nthere lives a Yiddish, Jewish girl. She lives by Pollack and she is a Pollack, she goes to\nchurch and everything. Even there, he took her out. He took her out, he got married to her,\nand he took her to Israel. I went there, I went there by her. If not for him, she would be, she\nwould spend her whole life there with him. Well he gave her life, let's put it this way, he\ngave her life. A lot of people they got married to the Pollacks and they was staying with\nthem. But I don't know if I would do this, I don't think so.",
        "A: A long, long time. We couldn't come to ourself. First of all, you know, as a young girl I was\nso skinny, I didn't have no bust, no nothing. When we came I had worn, I don't know, I didn't\nhave no underwear, no nothing. And excuse me, I got sick. I used to sleep and the water\ngoes. It was hard till I got to myself. I got to eat food better and I realized that it can't be this\ntime, it can't come back any more. And I have to establish my life, and I have to lie, you\nknow. So why from them? And that's what it is. I mean, I looked out for myself and I used to\nsay, \"we have to do it, we have to have a family, we have to have a life\". I don't know who\ntried, maybe my parents, who knows. Because to be honest with you, I couldn't believe in\nGod already, what he did to us.\nEnd of Tape #6\nTape #7",
        "A: It is important because I want the children, they should go in the same footsteps. Otherwise,\nI'll be honest with you. If not for the children, maybe I would be a free person. I'm going\nevery Saturday to the synagogue. My husband goes twice a day now, since he retired. But\nbefore he used to go also only on Saturdays. He used to work on Saturdays because we had\nto make a living. Nobody wants them, they want Saturdays too. And this what we went\nthrough, I wouldn't care too much. But later on when the kids start to go to school, I wanted\nthem, I used to light candles every Friday night. I didn't cook on Shabbos (ph), on Saturdays.\nI used to prepare Fridays. When I used to go to work I used to stay till 2:00 at night on\nThursday night to prepare for the two days food, not to cook, not to do anything. And I used\nto clean and shop, everything in the same day. Used to come from work, go shopping, to\nprepare and cook. That was the life. Then I wanted my daughter should go to Ishiri (ph), they\nwanted a lot of money. Yaffialia (ph) tried for me, I couldn't do it. So I gave her public\nschool, she went to public school. Then when my son was already five years old, I put him in\nIshiri (ph), I find more or less cheaper. I put him in Ishiri (ph), he didn't, he was so connected\nto me like a wire. And I was staying with him, for a whole month I used to go to Ishiri (ph)\nwith him and sitting with him. Till the rabbi came to me and he said, \"It's no use, he's crying,\nhe doesn't want, he doesn't like. Take him home, take and put him some place else\". What I\ndid the mistake is, when I gave him to Ishiri (ph), it was only boys, it was too religious.",
        "A: Yes. And now I'm keeping up very strongly, very. I don't write on Shabbos (ph), on holidays.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: They know, some things. Little things I told them. But I couldn't sit with them and talk about\nthis. I would hurt myself too much. So I didn't talk to them, really. They find out from places,\nfrom movies, from books, from these things. From papers they find out. Then little things I\ntold them where I was, like from Ashoshok (ph), like from Grodno, little things. When I was\nin the woods. So my grandson used to listen to, he wanted I should tell him. But the kids, my\nson, my daughter, especially my daughter, she didn't like me talk about this. But they know\neverything what I went through.",
        "A: Yeah, you know. My daughter went with me to Washington, to the Holocaust, when I was\nthere, my grandson, and they saw everything.",
        "A: Well I didn't have no fears later on but I was sorry when I had so much trouble, you know,\nhere. I was sorry. I used to say to my husband, \"why I survived? What I have accomplished\nin my life? What I have accomplished\"? I have no joy, no nockis (ph), but maybe that time I\nwas really angry, you know, what I did and why I came here, and what I went through a lot\nhere. Everything from the beginning. How many times you can start? Start and start, and\nwent through everything. But then I figure out, still I have a family, I have to raise them.\nMaybe later on I'm going to have more joy, more nockis (ph), more Yiddish nockis (ph), you\nknow? And that's all, and that's what it is. Now I have all the time with sickness. My\nhusband is a sick man. Last year he was twice in hospital and they put him a pacemaker.\nListen, we're getting older, everything comes out. We are not so strong anymore. We can't\ntake things what I used to take. I said all the time to my daughter, I said, \"what I used to do, I\ncan't do nothing here now. She said, \"you can do it, you are a strong woman, you will be\nstrong with us and with the life\".",
        "A: No, I don't think so.",
        "A: Sure. The only place is in the house, by me in the house. Every Friday night, this is never\ngoing to go away from me. When I'm lighting the candles, my husband is coming from Shull\n(ph), 1s making Kiddish (ph), you know what Kiddish (ph) 1s. I'm missing. The first years\nwas terrible. Later on, you know, I got used to it. Thought, this has to be, it's not going to\ncome any more. I survived, and I have to live to see a little nockis (ph), for my kids, for my\ngrandchildren. We should only be well. This is my first and the main thing, you know, to live\na few years like human being. To see something. But on the other hand when you are sick,\nyou can't go away, you can't travel far away. Three years ago we was in Israel for the bar\nmitzvah for my grandson. We had a beautiful time, we enjoyed so much. And now, who\nknows? God knows when we're going to go again because you have to go constantly to\ndoctors with medicine, to keep up with appointments. So we happy for this, we getting up in\nthe morning, we get dressed, thank God for this. What is more to ask now? Nothing more. I\nhave my own home, we have a car, we're still driving. We are not so poor. We raised the\nchildren and they are like, we say in Yiddish, \"To Godt and to light\" (ph), you know what it\nmeans? \"To God and to people\". And they are nice children, very devoted to us. My\ndaughter calls me when she goes to work, and at work, and when she comes from work. And\nevery day she's coming, whatever. \"You don't feel good? I'll take you to the doctor and tell\nme the truth. Tell me the truth\". Not all the time I can tell her the truth how I feel because she\nfeels bad too. Beside this, she's a European girl, it's different too. But now you can, I mean\nthe, she's without the accent, so is my son. He was born here. And that's what it is. We still\nstruggle now for the health. Before it was for work, for money, for life to live. And now it's\nfor health. God should give us only a few good years to live.",
        "A: That I survived. I went through a lot in my life and with God's help, I lived to have my own\nchildren and I lived to have grandchildren. And maybe if God would help me, I should live\nand to see great grandchildren, and to have nockis (ph) from them, from all of them. And\nGod should give us health for another few years, without any trouble, without what I went\nthrough in my life.\nConclusion of Interview\n"
