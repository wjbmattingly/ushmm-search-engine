In Crimea, they met each other and they married later. They were\nmost wonderful people and wonderful life they have. Before Stalin began with\nhis things. With them I finish. Then in the time, I stood, because I was the\nyoungest. I stood with my parents, yet. I was living there yet. The brother, one\nbrother.

She married, at last, you might say.\nShe married maybe in 1924 because the child, what this child, he --. She was\nmarried and her husband died in three months as she was married. So she repeat\nthe life of her mom. Father gone, husband died too. She had this child, three\nmonths, she was pregnant with him. Then he died and she could not -- she has no\nprofession, she could not live. To this time, maybe her grandfather died too. I\ndon\u2019t know really when. She came to her mom, to me, to us. Mom and father.\nHe was not her father, he was stepfather but he was a good man so he took her\nwith the child and told my mom yes, let her live with us. She lived some years\nwith us. Not much, she came to us only when he was born, in a year. So she\ncame in 1927. She used to come but go back. But when she met after her\nmarriage, she came the first time in 1927. Because her child 1s -- he is one year\n27\nwith a half, this Benjamin. One year with the help, she brought, I think. She\nmaybe he died from \u2014 not maybe, she told such.

In that time I was a worker, close\nto the working-class. In \u201927 when father had to come to Petrograd, he took his\nwife, my mom and the child and she did not want to go without, this child.

        "A: It was in Petsnov close to Leningrad. He used to come every Sunday when I\ncame back from Crimea, to meet with me. When I saw him I was not so great\nwith this. I did not want to give him any, I want him to live with me. But he\nthought it is much better for him there so he stayed there. I told him all about and\nthen I wrote him, after 1936 you became as a grown-up. You know all what\nhappened with you. Then he was given in that place, two military schools, special\nfor the war when the war began. Then I knew him, I saw him during the war from\nthe beginning.

The\nwar stopped, finished. He came to -- he wanted to come to Leningrad but he\ncould not come. He stayed there and then he came to St and then he\ncame up with this nice girl. She was Greek, from Greece. But she knew, she\n5\nspecial studied English, she knew English very good. He also studied and he\nstudied so then he married her and he stood there. He\u2019s alive now. It was not so\ngood with his health after the war as also like to get close. Became mom was and\nfather is -- so he was sent to the Crimea because he was a communistic. He could\nnot be a -- so great if he would not be a communist. He was in Elitar in the main\nthing. He was so, that\u2019s why he told me that if I will die, I will die not from\ntuberculosis. No more, such he wrote me. I was with him, not good. Then what\nhappened later. Later, just it was 1936, I told him. It became 19 _, the end of\n1936, Stalin began to do all his things. This happened between our family, very\nbad. On this I will tell you became it 1s with this connect. My eldest sister, they\nlived very good. She went in with him in Leningrad.

They became, she\u2019s a great doctor and\nhe\u2019s a great engineer. And Stalin \u2014 talk about this in another way. Oh, they are\ngreat, too much. No, must be taken to the prison. It began the terrorism. The\nterrorism began. I was not married but I had a great friend in the engineers who\ndid, you knew maybe, the electric stations. Water station,, it was close to\nLeningrad.",
        "A: Yes. Near station. It was . So I was sent there when I finished\nthe institute when I graduate. I make with him a grand . He was a great\nengineer, what is it, 1t was called. ?

Then the child was there but\nhe used to come to me. I could not, I told him we must wait because he was in\nS living, not in Leningrad because he was taken from Leningrad. When\nthe last time, when he left me, he decided to meet and he told me he will come in\nthe beginning of 1937. It was the end of \u201936. He did not come. He did not come\nat all. Then my sister, my sister\u2019s husband was also taken. Then was many\npeople taken to the prison with Stalin, to Siberia and to different things. Many if\nthem were killed in the prison and some were sent to Siberia. Many were sent.\nThat\u2019s why only one year she could live yet good. Then when her husband was\ntaken and before this, it was a great party, I must tell you because it 1s very\nconnected with this. A great party by ome of his students, with whom he studied\nin the academy. He bought a piano and it was very hard in that time to find a\n6\npiano. He was in the waiting for the piano four years or more. So he\ndecided to make a party and he asked all his students who were studying with him\nin the academy.

So they became engineer,\ngreat people, great persons. They ask him who am I, his wife? He told them, bo,\nmy wife would not come and this is my sister of my wife.

Later he told me\nand before I know, the families of some of them. this is the end of these great,\ngreat people, the end. This time when I saw them. That came 1937, the\nbeginning, all were taken to the prison after this party. My, what does this mean\nfor me. My sister\u2019s husband, Boris, was taken too. Then I know \u2014 I began to call\nto this family and to this family and to know about this, about this. He was taken,\nhe was taken, he was taken. What about the children?

Not only they, many families left\nBialystok on this -- the main thing for you. They were going by car, two families\nthere, my sister\u2019s family and the other family and the driver was with them. In the\nway, the Germans began to bomb and bomb and bomb. The bombs were all the\ntime They could not go more. They were afraid of the bombs and they had to\nleave all their things what they have with them in the car. They had to leave the\ncar and to go by foot. To go maybe to the forest, to the wood in the way. Their\ndriver ran away to the forest. He was Polish and he did not want to go more with\nthem. He left them to the forest.

You see and father did not ask this doctor to come but he\nasked a man who was only, who told it would become bad, without any medicine,\nit will become good. You will be good, you will be ---. Such __. But I wasa\nteen. My elder, she was born in first year and I was born in eight year, so seven\nyears I was younger than she was. She was nineteen. When she was eighteen,\nshe left. Yes in \u201919, when she was 18, she left Russia to Petrograd. She left\nKorpus for Petrograd. I stood seven years younger. I was eleven or such was I. I\nwas eleven when she was 18. But what I wanted to tell, about the doctor. The\ndoctor had a son and a daughter. His son became, when he grown up, he was --\nwanted to study. He met my sister and so he loved her. They -- his father was\nbad, as I told you. He left Russia for Palestine. He left Russia and came to\nPalestine. That time was Palestine called, not Israel yet. He, the son wanted to be\n-- to stop the revolution. He wanted to stay here in Russia and he wanted to\nstudy. He went to Petrograd and he entered the academic world, medical\nacademy. . He was already a student of the academy and\nhe was in a correspondence with my sister because he loved her. He invited her\nto come to Petrograd and told her to come to this academy and you will study too.\nShe wanted, not medicine, she wanted literature. She left Korpus. Then about\nthis is a great story I will tell you another time, later, what happened with her later\n26\nabout her life, the main thing. Because she had such an all different life. She\nbecame a doctor and she married. The man was a great engineer. He graduate\nacademy ; academic. (electric engineer), . Then\nthey had a rest. In Crimea, they met each other and they married later. They were\nmost wonderful people and wonderful life they have. Before Stalin began with\nhis things. With them I finish. Then in the time, I stood, because I was the\nyoungest. I stood with my parents, yet. I was living there yet. The brother, one\nbrother. Father did not want to let him go to Petrograd because he told I need a\nworker. I need a helper. So he was helping him anyway. In other way what\nfather did. Then what? I will come to my mom. In this time, my mom\u2019s\ndaughter became also grown up. Because it was in what time, in 1919, my elder\nsister left. She became maybe she married in this time because she was maybe --\nI don\u2019t know, I do mot know really \u2014 but she was born as with all my elder, the\nsister from my mom only. The first marriage, my mom. She was maybe in one \u2014\nmy eldest sister, I don\u2019t know. Maybe in 1919, no, in the beginning of the\ncentury, what is it?",

        "A: In 18 _, maybe \u201998, was she born, or \u201999. She was elder maybe some years\nonly. But to this time, she became grown-up. She married, at last, you might say.\nShe married maybe in 1924 because the child, what this child, he --. She was\nmarried and her husband died in three months as she was married. So she repeat\nthe life of her mom. Father gone, husband died too. She had this child, three\nmonths, she was pregnant with him. Then he died and she could not -- she has no\nprofession, she could not live. To this time, maybe her grandfather died too. I\ndon\u2019t know really when. She came to her mom, to me, to us. Mom and father.\nHe was not her father, he was stepfather but he was a good man so he took her\nwith the child and told my mom yes, let her live with us. She lived some years\nwith us. Not much, she came to us only when he was born, in a year. So she\ncame in 1927. She used to come but go back. But when she met after her\nmarriage, she came the first time in 1927. Because her child 1s -- he is one year\n27\nwith a half, this Benjamin. One year with the help, she brought, I think. She\nmaybe he died from \u2014 not maybe, she told such. He was sick with maybe\ntuberculosis. He gave her sickness to her. She became sick too with tuberculosis.\nIn that time tuberculosis was cured not so good as now. She came, as she was a\nlittle sick and not so great yet but she brought the child. It was in 1927 and\nsuddenly my father has gotten a letter from America. It was the first letter from\nhis children, of the first marriage is. It was in 1927. They left in 1910 and 712.\nSo it passed 17 or 15 years. They became, they had business great. The elterer\nhas this great business. I told you. Machines. They lived already, they were all\nmarried. They have their families and they live good. They invited father to\ncome to them. Maybe I told you about this. He went and he had to go to us in\nPetrograd to tell us, to speak with us about this. To go, not to go, how with --\nabout this.
