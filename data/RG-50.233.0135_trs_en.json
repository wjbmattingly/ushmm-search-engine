Don\u2019t go away. The\nNazis run away. Was no Nazis there so we remained ourselves in the camp, organizing our own\nleadership there and the next day everybody is going on his own. I stayed I think two days and\nwith a group I went to Linz; it\u2019s a big city.

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Working for a Nazis and under their control from their blueprints and everything had to be done\nperfect. If you don\u2019t do perfect they beat you up and they throw you out. I remember one\nincident Nazi came and give the order to make a picture frame. All right a picture frame and I\ngot the measurements. I made the picture frame and I finished. Couple took it and delivered it\nto that SS man and a couple of days he was coming with that picture frame to me, you made it?\nYes. What size? This and this size.

Took that picture frame and bopped it on my head\nand broke it into pieces and I had to do it over, the new picture frame, the bigger size.",
        "A: That\u2019s the worst thing that happened in Gusen during the war.",
        "A: Yeah, out of fear because if you goof up something or you don\u2019t work right so they throw you\nout and I want to stay in a warm shop and they treat us good over there. Sometime we get extra\nplate of soup and survive there.",

Don\u2019t go away. The\nNazis run away. Was no Nazis there so we remained ourselves in the camp, organizing our own\nleadership there and the next day everybody is going on his own. I stayed I think two days and\nwith a group I went to Linz; it\u2019s a big city. And over there again in some kind of barracks where\nwas the Polish, Italians, and Russian farm labors in those barracks. We was over there for a\nwhile.",
        "A: In Gusen, I\u2019d say the most was the Polish and then Spanish, French, Germans, Czechoslovaks\nand we had some Jews there too, not many, but one barrack was the Jews. But they were\ntreated good. They was not treated bad like in Auschwitz.",
        "A: Oh, and we had some Russians, too. Russians we had and Gypsies we had.",
        "A: Prisoners of war.",
        "A: They was all right. They brought them to Gusen from some different camps. So they was\ntreated here now like everyone else, not like prisoner of war but like a prisoner in a camp.",

        "A: And the Gypsies was the same.",
        "A: There too, yeah.",
        "A: In the meantime I didn\u2019t know nothing what happened to them. When I was in Italy and\nthrough the American soldier from New York -- he wrote to his parents in New York and his\nparents with that letter came to my father and my father wrote the letter and through his parents\nsent it back to him in Italy and through the military mail I got the news from Father and he\nwrote me that Mama and Sister is in Siberia.",
        "A: That\u2019s when I was already liberated and I was in Italy.",
        "A: At the end of the war, end of the war and through the American soldier he got the first news that\nI\u2019m alive and I\u2019m in Italy.",
        "A: That was in Linz first American soldiers, yeah, it was couple soldiers came in there and it was\nfrom Detroit and Chicago area and they speak Polish and they was looking for a Polish ex-\nprisoners and I talk with them and then I mentioned that I\u2019m American from New York. Oh,\nyou\u2019re American. Yeah. How come you got here? And we start talking. The next day comes\nthe jeep, Lieutenant and found me, talked to me and they took me to Ragensburg and\nRagensburg I got rid of my camp uniform and get me some soldier\u2019s clothing and special\nstrictly diet. The doctor examined me; strictly diet. Don\u2019t eat this, don\u2019t eat this or you may get\nsick. Do what I told you and after a month or two I was feeling all right. So they put me a little\nbit to work. I was interpreter. I really hated the Germany and everything was theirs, I just\nwanted to run away from there. And here was a group of the Polish and Italians going to Italy.\nSo I decided to go to Italy. I jumped on a train with them and through the Innsbruck we end up\nin Italy in Verona. In Verona again the Polish army got us about twenty Polish ex-prisoners\nfrom camps and from the farmers, laborers, and the Polish army took care of us. All the other\nguys joined the Polish army.
