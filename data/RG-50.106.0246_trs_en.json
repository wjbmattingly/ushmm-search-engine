When they liquidated\nthat little ghetto from the 2000 people that they have left, they took 200 to send them to that\nfactory to work. And the 1800 they dispersed in different camps in Poland. They really took me\nout to be sent to one of those camps.

So finally they decided that we should go down to the krankenlager, to the sick camp.\nAnd the sick camp was that you had those German cuts that was like 30 inches wide. Five\npeople were ina cut. And when we came in. We were all like this. But the people in the camp\nthat were there looked worse than we were. So when we came in. When we came into the camp\nwe just asked them how long was that you became you know they looked like you\u2019re going to a\ndoctor and you see a skeleton. They were a skeleton.

And we stayed, they locked us, they kept us like in the camps.\nThey wouldn\u2019t let, they were afraid to let us out. They were afraid that we would kill all the\nGermans there. So they kept us locked in for quite a while. But we jumped over the fence.",
        "Q: What was your health like at that point?",
        "A: Weak, very weak. Could hardly walk.",
        "Q: Do you know how much you weighed? Then or you don\u2019t.",

        "Q: But you were still growing even though you didn\u2019t\u2019 have enough food. You were still\ngetting bigger, taller I should say.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah I was already like about 14, 15. Yeah. And I have still my teeth, I am so\nlucky you see that. Well we decided to jump the fence because we didn\u2019t\u2019 like the food.",
        "Q: So other teenagers.",
        "A: No they were a little bit more than teenagers. They were all in their 20s, middle 20s.\nthat\u2019s the majority that really stayed alive. And I was at that time they called me the kid. And\nthey kind of, I don\u2019t know if they felt sorry for me that they, eventually they left and that\u2019s a\ndifferent story. But we jumped and we went in there was three or four of us, we went into a\nGerman peasant in a little town which was called in a town, the village was called Auw, next to\nMauthausen. Maybe three or four kilometers away from Mauthausen. Mauthausen was next\nto a village, not to atown. The town of Mauthausen was a little bit further down. and we told\nthe woman that we want food and we want a bed to sleep and a place to wash. Well she did give\nus a place to wash. And we told her what kind of food we want. It was an old lady and she says\nwell I'll give you the food that you want but if you eat that food that you want, you\u2019re going to\ndie. We were underweight and she knew where we came from so she said that\u2019s too fat for you.\nAnd this is why we left the camp too because the Americans didn\u2019t\u2019 feed us the proper food. So\nwe said ok give us whatever you have but we\u2019re hungry. And she did. Little by little she gave us\nfood that she felt without fat. And we stayed with her for a few weeks. Until the Russian, we\nescaped to the Russian side because in Austria we were away, the Russians were quite practically\nnext to, well they were, the Russian army and the American army were kind of together at that\ntime. And just across if you run out from the camp, from Mauthausen, you were on the Russian\nside. But if you were in the camp, you were on the American side. So we were on the Russian\nside. And one night the Russians came in, soldiers came in to the apartment and they knew that\nwe speak German. And we told them we don\u2019t speak Russian. We speak Polish. Never mind\nthey said. We want what do you call it, watches. We want rings, we want all kinds of things.\nSo and you tell the Germans what we want. And I said we can\u2019t do that. Said you better do it.\nSo we did it. We went with them. And we walked into their houses and we told them what they\nwant. And the Germans thought that we splitting with them. And we went into one of the\nhouses that the daughter was going out with the commandant, with the main guy, with the\nRussian. The daughter comes home and she says and the mother tells her that those Jews that live\nat the neighbors brought the Russians in to rob them. (phone rings) Well the daughter called the\nRussian that she walked out, that she was going with and that she was, he was, called him or\nwhatever. And told him that the Jews tried to rob her parents. And she didn\u2019t tell him that the\nRussians tried to rob the parents, but the Jews. So he sends a soldier to tell us you should appear\nin front of him, 5:00 in the morning. So we thought between us if we appear and wake him up at\n5:00 after his binge at night hell shoot us. We decided to run. The woman had two bikes and\nthe neighbor had another two bikes and we told them look we don\u2019t\u2019 want to take it but if you\nwant to give us the bikes because if we don\u2019t I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. Said ok we\ndon\u2019t care.",
        "Q: How many of you were there?",
        "A: Four",
        "Q: There were four of you.",
        "A: So we took the bikes and we started to run all night long and we\u2019re all looking behind us\nif they\u2019re not chasing us. But it was ok. They did not chase us. We finally found the, came into\na little town and the Russians liked the bikes. And they said but I am really too young to ride a\nbike all the way to Vienna. Just cause we were going to up to Vienna. What do you have in\nVienna? I said we might have some relatives. We don\u2019t know. They said ok. Give us the bikes\nbecause you are too young to ride bikes to Vienna. It\u2019s too far. We\u2019ll put you on the trains. They\nwanted the bikes. So they took us to the station and they said wait for a train. The train will\ncome. You go to Vienna. So we gave them the bikes, have no choice. And we waited. And the\ntrain came and we went to Vienna.",
        "Q: And you just get on the train and then you don\u2019t need tickets or anything?",
        "A: No, no there was no tickets in those days. No. Just took a train and we went, came to\nVienna. And we came to Vienna. We got off in Vienna so it\u2019s you cannot walk after 10:00 at\nnight. And we are after 10 so they arrest us and we were coming in.",
        "Q: Who\u2019s the they?",
        "A: The Russians. The soldiers because after that was that you cannot leave your house after\n10:00.",
        "Q: It was after curfew.",
        "A: Curfew yeah. And so we were after the curfew so they took us to the station. And so in\nthe station was a believe it or not a Russian Jewish guy so we spoke in Jewish. He spoke Jewish.",
        "Q: He spoke Yiddish.",
        "A: Yeah so he decided he\u2019s going to send us to a pensione and see to that we should have\nfood and that helped a lot and this is what we did.\n(file 2 \u2014 RG-50.106.0246.02.02; duration: 22:37)\nKatie St. John: This is Katie St. John taking over for Gail Schwartz in the interview of Nathan\nNeiberg on July 24, 2015. So Mr. Neiberg you were telling us that you came to Vienna after the\nwar. So could you tell us a little about that?\nNathan Neiberg: Stayed in Vienna of like a couple of weeks the captain of the post in Vienna,\nthe Russian captain of the post in Vienna assigned us a place to stay in a hotel. And he supplied\nus with food and was very nice to us. After a few weeks I decided to go back to my home town\nin Poland to see who\u2019s left alive. Being in the station train came in from Poland and as the people\nwalked off the train I recognized a few guys that came back from Poland. And I recognized that\nthe war, during the war in the concentration camps. So I walked up to them and said what\u2019s\ngoing on in Poland. And they asked me which town I have come from. And I told them. So they\nsaid don\u2019t go to Poland to see who stayed alive because the Poles don\u2019t look at it, don\u2019t look at\nus welcome. That we should come back there even for a little while. They killed quite a few\nJewish guys that came in to see if their parents are alive or somebody stayed alive in the family.\nSo we advise you not to go back to Poland. But if you want to know go to Hungary. And in,\nthere\u2019s quite a few a lot of Polish Jews that went to Hungary after the war. So go to Hungary.\nFind the, find Budapest. There are camps there. Refugee camps. Inquire there and you\u2019ll know\nmore so there than if you go to Poland, go to your home town. So I decided instead of taking a\ntrain to Poland I took a train to Hungary. In those days there were no, you didn\u2019t have to pay for\nthe seats on the train. You just boarded the train and you just went. And this is what I did. I\ncame into Hungary and I didn\u2019t\u2019 meet there people from my own home town. And they in fact\nthey told me that some of your brothers stayed alive too. But they didn\u2019t know where they are or\nthey didn\u2019t\u2019 see them but they heard from other people that they came across that they feel that\nsome of the Neibergs, Neiberg brothers stayed alive. They don\u2019t know which ones. They might\nhave think about me but they didn\u2019t know. So I stayed a while in Budapest. There was a refugee\ncamp in Budapest also. And then there was that they started to form Zionist groups in the\nrefugee camps with the intentions of eventually going to Israel. At that time it was Palestine. It\nwas not Israel yet there.",
        "Q: And what were the camps like?",
        "A: In Hungary. Decent. Well any place you went after the concentration camps in Germany\nand throughout the war, once it ended, nothing was in comparison to the concentration camps. So\nwhatever you did, it was always a little better then. So the question 1s that how was it. It was\nbetter. But was it good. No, it was just better that you had more food to eat. You weren\u2019t hungry\nand you had some clean clothes to wear. The rest ok.",
        "Q: Is there anything specific that you remember from your time there?",
        "A: From Hungary?",
        "Q: From the refugee camp, yes.",
        "A: From the refugee. Not really, not really. It was normal you know. As I came, as a\nrefugee camp was, which was mainly that you survived, that you\u2019re not in danger of being killed\nand being beaten up or had to go to work. To work that was it was a horrible type of work. But\nanything, you survived in the camps. You couldn\u2019t\u2019 complain for, there was quite a few a lot of\nrefugees that they just welcomed, and they did a decent job at whatever they could. No\ncomplaints. And then from, so I joined one of those Zionist groups. And decide that Zionist, the\nleaders decided that well we it\u2019s time to move on. We left Hungary and strived to reach Italy.",
        "Q: Why Italy?",
        "A: Because from Italy they formed there refugee camps in Italy. That was already refugee\ncamps. And from Italy kind of striving to reach Palestine. That was the last stop before trying to\nreach Palestine. Or you went to France. But we picked Italy. So to reach Italy we had to go\nback to Austria. And we came back to Austria we stayed there for again, for like a month and\nfinally the Jewish brigade that was serving the English army they helped the Jewish group,\nZionist group reaching Italy with their trucks. It was not legal that they did it but they did it.\nThen we went through the Alps from Austria to avoid usual borders. Then we reached northern\nItaly, coming through the Alps. And we were left in Modena, Italy in Modena. It\u2019s close to\nBologna kind of. It\u2019s a nice, nice town. And there was also a Jewish refugee camp kind of that\nthey formed. And we stayed in Bologna a while. Then we left Modena to southern Italy which\nwas Santa Maria. You have it in here.",
        "Q: Oh, in the documents.",
        "A: Yes. And stayed in Santa Maria for a while, naturally with the Zionist groups. And we\ndecided from the Zionist group decided really, the leaders of the Zionist group decided that there\nwas a ship which was called the Moleta and they said that you might leave with that ship. And\nwe left with that ship and we reached Cyprus.",
        "Q: And why that ship?",
        "A: Well that was available. It was that ship was bought through the Zionist groups through\nthe United States. It was a really a kind of a fishing boat you would say more so. But it was an\nenlarged fishing boat, a luxury fishing boat kind of. And we left in the at that particular time was\nthe blockade of the British navy that they wouldn\u2019t let the Jews into Israel, to Palestine, I mean.\nAnd they used to know the kind of route we took from Italy to Palestine and they were\ncontrolling that particular route. And they always used to catch the illegal ships trying to come to\nPalestine. And we were caught by them and we were brought to Haifa. They took us off from\nthe ships that we came on. They were raiding us. Well we had a light fight with them before they\ntook us, took over the ship. We threw at them rotten tomatoes and they got a little angry with us\nbut it was over and they attached us to their ship and brought us into Haifa. In Haifa we had to\nleave the ship that we came on and they transferred us to a, to one of their ships. And they took\nus to Cyprus.",
        "Q: And how many other people were you with?",
        "A: I would say another kind of at 100, between 150 to 100 people that we were.",
        "Q: And you were all taken to Cyprus?",
        "A: Correct yes and we were taken to Cyprus and must be familiar with Cyprus Camps right.\nOk so we stayed in Cyprus for quite a while. From Cyprus when they declared the state of Israel\nnaturally they let us go to come into Israel at that time. And \u2014",
        "Q: While you were in Cyprus what were you doing?",
        "A: While Cyprus was a camp that you just were imprisoned. We were not doing anything\nreally. Except we were doing you know in groups things to send out great teachers from\nPalestine and we used to study the Bible, all these, all kinds of lessons. There was kind of like a\nformed school that whoever wanted to attend was welcome there. This was the major things that\nwe did. There was no work to be done. Yeah there was work that we all had to day, give a day in\nthe kitchen about wash dishes or something of that nature so we all always were available if they\nneeded some people but as far as really working, there was no work.",
        "Q: Just focusing on your education.",
        "A: Correct. Just on education and English supplied the food and it was ok. Can\u2019t complain\nthat they didn\u2019t gas or beat you up there. It was normal way of life, a normal way of life in the\ncamp. Being imprisoned. And naturally we stayed in Cyprus, the Jewish group, in that camp\nuntil they declared the state of Israel. Soon as they declared the state of Israel, they all let us out.\nNot out, they I think the Israeli formed government sent ships to bring us back to Israel. Not\nback but to bring us to Israel.",
        "Q: Were there any kind of big celebrations in the camp?",
        "A: Oh absolutely. Oh yes, great celebrations. Great everybody was just like in heaven. Then\nafter those celebrations the ship came to pick us up. Came in but naturally the majority of us\nwho wanted to been to a kibbutz or just do whatever you want to do. But the majority was we all\nwent in the army. And til the war ended and we became really a country. Then this was the end\nof it.",
        "Q: From there, when did you decide to come to the U.S.?",
        "A: Well I had two brothers here and a sister. And they really wanted, they wanted me to join\nthem which I wasn\u2019t too happy to leave Israel. I liked where I was. I was doing pretty well there.\nBut eventually they convinced me that we should be together. So I had to decide. They were, I\nwas the youngest so I thought they kind of, and I this is when I decided to come to the United\nStates.",
        "Q: About what year was that?",
        "A: 52. Right after the war of the independence, when the war of independence ended.\nWhen I got out from the army at that time.",
        "Q: So you were out from the army maybe deciding what to do next and that\u2019s when \u2014",
        "A: Well I was working already there in Israel.",
        "Q: And what were you doing?",
        "A: I was only working in the port of, in Haifa port for a while. In the administration. And\nfrom there kind of I then took the United States, I decided and that was it.",
        "Q: Did you go by ship?",
        "A: Yes, yes. The usual thing.",
        "Q: Did you go to New York or \u2014",
        "A: No straight to Chicago. Yeah because my two brothers and sister were in Chicago at that\ntime. Naturally I -- And that was the happy ending.",
        "Q: What was it like seeing your siblings again?",
        "A: It was great, it was great together with my family. Eventually got married. And had three\nkids and one of them is sitting right behind me, my daughter. Now she has kids. And that\u2019s\nwhat I did.",
        "Q: My last question to you would be is there anything that you didn\u2019t get a chance to talk\nabout. You want to \u2014",
        "A: No as I think about it, I can send it or something about it. Right?",
        "Q: We can record it right now if",
        "A: No that\u2019s about, that\u2019s about it.\nMan (asks question): The period of time from when you went to Israel and then, your train \u2014",
        "A: We all went to be a soldier. And actually ok, Jack thank you. Thank you yeah, yes.",
        "Q: If you\u2019d like to tell us a little bit about that.",
        "A: Well we had to go into the army, it was no question about it. we were all healthy by that\ntime. We recoup from the camps and so we been coming to Israel. We were all over 18 already.\nI think. And we went, I went into the army and stayed in the Army for a while and by luck they\ntook me into the Navy for a while. So I stayed in the after, stayed in the Navy for most of my\nbeing in the Army really. And",
        "Q: And why the switch from Army to Navy?",
        "A: Well I you know when I was in Italy I did go a little bit to school in Italy. And it was the\nmaritime school, scholastic school in Ancona. SO [had kind of like a test which the Army\nknew about and they needed people that had some type of a, a little education about it so they\nreally picked me and they felt since we haven\u2019t got too many Jewish sailors and you had a little\nbit of schooling about it. So they just picked me and I joined the Navy.",
        "Q: And so what did they have you doing in the Navy?",
        "A: Well I started off as a regular sailor and then I was promoted to be the boson. Boson\nmeant to be the head of the sailors. Kind of, it was a kind of a little rank. And stayed there like\nwell I volunteered for an additional year while I was there. What was my time for, to get out of\nit was, they asked me if I wanted to stay for an additional year. I said well I signed for an\nadditional year. They said, I liked it. And then once the year elapsed, I got into the civilian life\nand that was it. Became you know in the again worked in the administration in the port of Haifa\nuntil I came to the United States.",
        "Q: Is there anything specific from the war of independence you\u2019d like to include?",
        "A: Well it was the war like any other war. You know. it\u2019s nothing special. You got your\nyou know maneuvers and fightings but I was in the Army. The Navy saw very little fightings.\nBecause it was skirmishes but nothing special. Just watched the borders. The water borders on\nthe Mediterranean. And that was, that was the end and then that as I said I got into the\nadministration and worked at Haifa port. That was the end of it.",
        "Q: One more question. I\u2019m curious of people who were Holocaust survivors who were\nfighting in the war of independence. Did their experience in the concentration camp make them\nmore tougher as soldiers. Did they, did you see people who were \u2014",
        "A: We made yes, anger yes, but tougher soldiers no. The sabras was just as tough. As us.\nthey were just as angry and dedicated as we were. We weren\u2019t any more dedicated than they,\nreally born young people at those days in Israel. We were on equal, maybe a little, we were a\nlittle bit maybe more dedicated than the influx of Americans, the few Americans that came in\nand wanted to be officers running the Army. But they did a great job. They did a great job.\nThey were in the American Army and they knew more so about armies than we did. That\u2019s true.",

        "A: Just the clothes on the back and this is, this is the way you have to leave the house. They\ndidn\u2019t allow you to take anything. And little by little we stole a little bit when we worked for the\nsorting the stuff that we took out from the apartments so we you know we used to take whatever\nwe will need, we needed. If they caught you they shot you and they did that to a couple of\nwomen really yeah.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t think, 1t wouldn\u2019t make a difference with them as far as shooting somebody.",
        "A: Yeah didn\u2019t make a difference, that was no big deal.",
        "A: For approximately for eight to nine months. Then they decide --",

        "A: There was plumbing that you took a big pail of water and you washed yourself. But there\nwere no showers or anything of that nature. You were not exactly clean, put it that way. You\ntried your best but you never succeeded. It was always cold water. And there was nowhere, never\nanywhere to warm that water. Because the food came from generally you went, stood in line for,\nfor your soup and your \u2014",

        "A: Into one of those \u2014",
        "A: The rail, yeah. The rail cars. Put a hundred guys in and once and I was just the last one\nbut they closed the doors and they put me with my brother in law in the next wagon. And then I\nwas separated from my brothers because \u2014",
        "A: My no you see, that\u2019s another story. I forgot all about that.",
        "A: When they made the little ghetto, that was where the Jewish quarter used to be before the\nwar. And there we had something like 2000 people that remained to clean the ghetto. So we\nstayed there for like two months and they liquidated that little ghetto. And from that little ghetto\nthey left maybe 200 people that worked for those huts in that big factory. When they liquidated\nthat little ghetto from the 2000 people that they have left, they took 200 to send them to that\nfactory to work. And the 1800 they dispersed in different camps in Poland. They really took me\nout to be sent to one of those camps. When I, when they took me out, I kind of sneaked, tried to\nsneak back in, and the Jewish policeman that watched that nobody should sneak back in, he\nknew me very well. And I knew them and I used to play with his daughter.",
        "A: Yeah, Kornentz. And he saw me sneaking in and he gave me the eye and he said get\nlost. Ana I snuck back into the little ghetto so I stayed with my brothers. My uncle they took\nhim out also at that time. He stayed on and they took him to the, one of the camps, concentration\ncamps in Poland. And I stayed and then as I said they liquidated that small little, they took us to\nthat to the factory, where we were. And I stayed there til I went to Buchenwald.",
        "A: No, I was lucky. I was kind of lucky. Every situation played my way. I wasn\u2019t that smart\nbut since I had brothers that stayed and I going to go to the factory to live. I figured I want to\nstay with them. And I was lucky that that policeman was standing at that time and let me go\nthrough.",
        "A: In that, well it was much better I would say the big factory than Buchenwald.",
        "A: Oh correct. I was in the rail car.",
        "A: No food, no water, no nothing and we were traveling to Buchenwald. It took us like two\ndays maybe more. And we arrived in the evening.",
        "A: No, no we didn\u2019t know. When we came into Buchenwald we didn\u2019t know where we are\nuntil we were told that we are in Buchenwald.",
        "A: The car, we were unloaded and they took us in for shower and two of them, two Jewish\npeople that I knew of the men they knew about the showers, the gas so they just took pills. Two\nof them. But the rest \u2014",
        "A: Yeah they took their lives. Yeah, yeah they took their lives and the rest of us went in for\nshowers and we took those showers, that were showers and then they put us in blocks you know.\nBarracks yeah.",
        "A: They gave us the stripes. The stripes yeah and we go and got, we had to get to one\nbarrack we walked.",
        "A: Yes, yes we had numbers. We had numbers, I couldn\u2019t I don\u2019t remember.",

        "A: Yeah well that\u2019s about it. I knew that I had to wear it.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah I went out like couple of times. It was which they called it Sternbrook. You did",
        "A: Yeah that\u2019s what you did.",
        "A: At that time I was in good shape, I was in good shape, in decent shape. Then I was also\nlucky because right across from our barrack were was a Swedish people or something, from the\nNetherlands. Then they used to get packages from their home town.",
        "A: Prisoners, yeah.",
        "A: No, no they weren\u2019t Jewish. They were Gentile but for some reason I, you don\u2019t know\nwhy they, why they \u2014",
        "A: Something of that nature. And they used to help us. Once in a while they\u2019d throw in\nsomething so we were all kind of lucky too in that respect. But yeah and then it started to go\ndown and down and down. Worse and worse and worse.",
        "A: Correct, yeah.",
        "A: Harder work and then stayed in Buchenwald for a while and then they \u2014",
        "A: In Buchenwald I was kind of like a couple of months and then they say you know\nBuchenwald was a concentration camp. They concentrate the people and they send out from\nBuchenwald. SO I went to Flossberg. That was a brand new camp. Flossberg was near\nLeipzig. And that was and they were building the ammunition factory.",
        "A: No, no. My brother in law was sent out if you\u2019ve ever heard of Schlieben. That was very\nknown camp in Germany. And he went to Schlieben. | didn\u2019t. and I stayed on in Buchenwald.\nI stayed on for another couple of weeks. And they sent me to Flossberg. With 200 Hungarian\nJews that none of them spoke any Yiddish. They spoke one language.",
        "A: Hungarian. And we arrived in Flossberg.",
        "A: Without any relatives. I was all by, on my own at that time.",
        "A: Well no. I just missed them but no frightened I was not. Because what was the\ndifference. We got used to that.",
        "A: Oh yes, absolutely yeah sure. One morning they \u2014",
        "A: No. Stay well. Take care of yourself. What else could you say. And Uri he lived through\nthe war. He went back to Poland and he was killed in Poland by the Poles. In town, in Piotrk\u00e9w.\nSo and as I say I was with 200 Hungarian Jews that none of them spoke any Yiddish and when\nthey took us off the train and we lined up they called up who spoke German. Nobody spoke any\nGermany from like an idiot I raised my hand.",
        "A: Right. So he tells me I should explain them what is, what he was talking to me.",
        "A: Correct. So I tried to tell them I don\u2019t speak no Hungarian. SO he slapped me the minute\nI opened my mouth. You talk when I tell you when to talk.",
        "A: The German, the German guard. So I just shut up and I didn\u2019t say nothing. He says so\naren\u2019t you telling them nothing and I quiet. I\u2019m afraid to answer him. He said say it. In German.\nSo I tell him again. He tells me say whatever you want to say. Talk to them. So I spoke to them\nin Yiddish. That\u2019s about it. I don\u2019t know what, that was it. After I finished he said ok, disperse,\ngo to your barracks. And this is what we did. This is how it ended.",
        "A: So I go to the barracks and I am the guy that speaks, that can understand and we have a\nGerman guy a political prisoner which he is the eldest in the barrack and he runs that barrack and\npractically the captain. And he is a good guy, he\u2019s not a bad guy. He behaves to us very well,\nexcept that when you go out to work and come back you have to \u2014",
        "A: Langer, Kurt Langer. A good guy. He didn\u2019t hurt you or specially he even used to say\nwatch yourself when you go out. So I could never, we never complained on him. But there were\nhunger, great hunger. They didn\u2019t\u2019 feed you well.",
        "A: Practically water for soup. And for a while I was they sent me to the kitchen to wash the\ndishes or what not you know. And then this ended so I had, they sort of sent me to clean up the\nkep, inside the block. The \u2014",
        "A: Barrack. That lasted for a week and then I had to go out to work. And I went out to work\nI came back for the two Kurt Langer, says how was it. I said terrible. He said well, maybe [ll\nfind some work for you here. So he scraped around and this is where I stayed and he saw to it, I\nshould not go out to work anymore. Because I was the youngest in the group and he felt kind of\nsorry, sorry about it. And he kind of helped me out and this is how I stayed on til the end\npractically, two months before the war ended. And they took us \u2014",
        "A: Yeah but before the war, like four months before it ended they, the Russians were very\nclose because it was close to Leipzig. They decided to evacuate us. And we again went in the\ntrain and we are driving around for like three, two, three weeks. Because \u2014",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: Correct, sure. And as we were riding in the trains finally they found a place for us in\nMauthausen. So we came into Mauthausen. And we stayed like two nights in Mauthausen.",
        "A: No because we were, they kind of we was separated from everything. The whole group.\nThey were holding us like two nights. And they \u2014",
        "A: No, no. They took us into the camps. And we stayed like two nights out in the camp.\nOn the outside ---",
        "A: No, no not at that time. And they didn\u2019t. They tried to make up their mind what to do\nwith us. So finally they decided that we should go down to the krankenlager, to the sick camp.\nAnd the sick camp was that you had those German cuts that was like 30 inches wide. Five\npeople were ina cut. And when we came in. We were all like this. But the people in the camp\nthat were there looked worse than we were. So when we came in. When we came into the camp\nwe just asked them how long was that you became you know they looked like you\u2019re going to a\ndoctor and you see a skeleton. They were a skeleton. So we just wanted to find out how long it\ntook them to become skeleton. And luckily it was right towards the end of the war. It was in 45.\nAnd it was already 45 in May. We came in.",
        "A: Very, the end of April. And the Americans came in. The Americans came in. They\nopened up our camp that was the bottom in Mauthausen. And we went out. We didn\u2019t know\nwhat it was but we went out for some reason and they got scared of us.",
        "A: The Americans.",
        "A: Of us yeah because we were not looking like normal people. They just \u2014",
        "A: The tanks and the soldiers they just ran out and closed the camp until they brought in the\nRed Cross or whatever.",
        "A: Well.",
        "A: Oh yeah it was just, it was just you couldn\u2019t believe it. You didn\u2019t, you didn\u2019t\u2019 believe\nwhat happened. You just unbelievable. The holiday and the hollerings and the laughter and the\nyou name it. Crying, that the whole, that\u2019s it was a trying time.",
        "A: Well as they say T\u2019shea.",
        "A: No. No. How would I know English?",
        "A: No really not. No had nothing to do with them.",
        "A: Right, yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, they \u2014",
        "A: Well they clean us up a little bit. They fed us. And they took us out from that camp and\nwe went into the better camp, up. And we stayed, they locked us, they kept us like in the camps.\nThey wouldn\u2019t let, they were afraid to let us out. They were afraid that we would kill all the\nGermans there. So they kept us locked in for quite a while. But we jumped over the fence.",
        "A: Weak, very weak. Could hardly walk.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I got together with some people, with some young people. I was kind of the youngest\nalways for some reason. Was very few, very few my age so I \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah I was already like about 14, 15. Yeah. And I have still my teeth, I am so\nlucky you see that. Well we decided to jump the fence because we didn\u2019t\u2019 like the food.",
        "A: No they were a little bit more than teenagers. They were all in their 20s, middle 20s.\nthat\u2019s the majority that really stayed alive. And I was at that time they called me the kid. And\nthey kind of, I don\u2019t know if they felt sorry for me that they, eventually they left and that\u2019s a\ndifferent story. But we jumped and we went in there was three or four of us, we went into a\nGerman peasant in a little town which was called in a town, the village was called Auw, next to\nMauthausen. Maybe three or four kilometers away from Mauthausen. Mauthausen was next\nto a village, not to atown. The town of Mauthausen was a little bit further down. and we told\nthe woman that we want food and we want a bed to sleep and a place to wash. Well she did give\nus a place to wash. And we told her what kind of food we want. It was an old lady and she says\nwell I'll give you the food that you want but if you eat that food that you want, you\u2019re going to\ndie. We were underweight and she knew where we came from so she said that\u2019s too fat for you.\nAnd this is why we left the camp too because the Americans didn\u2019t\u2019 feed us the proper food. So\nwe said ok give us whatever you have but we\u2019re hungry. And she did. Little by little she gave us\nfood that she felt without fat. And we stayed with her for a few weeks. Until the Russian, we\nescaped to the Russian side because in Austria we were away, the Russians were quite practically\nnext to, well they were, the Russian army and the American army were kind of together at that\ntime. And just across if you run out from the camp, from Mauthausen, you were on the Russian\nside. But if you were in the camp, you were on the American side. So we were on the Russian\nside. And one night the Russians came in, soldiers came in to the apartment and they knew that\nwe speak German. And we told them we don\u2019t speak Russian. We speak Polish. Never mind\nthey said. We want what do you call it, watches. We want rings, we want all kinds of things.\nSo and you tell the Germans what we want. And I said we can\u2019t do that. Said you better do it.\nSo we did it. We went with them. And we walked into their houses and we told them what they\nwant. And the Germans thought that we splitting with them. And we went into one of the\nhouses that the daughter was going out with the commandant, with the main guy, with the\nRussian. The daughter comes home and she says and the mother tells her that those Jews that live\nat the neighbors brought the Russians in to rob them. (phone rings) Well the daughter called the\nRussian that she walked out, that she was going with and that she was, he was, called him or\nwhatever. And told him that the Jews tried to rob her parents. And she didn\u2019t tell him that the\nRussians tried to rob the parents, but the Jews. So he sends a soldier to tell us you should appear\nin front of him, 5:00 in the morning. So we thought between us if we appear and wake him up at\n5:00 after his binge at night hell shoot us. We decided to run. The woman had two bikes and\nthe neighbor had another two bikes and we told them look we don\u2019t\u2019 want to take it but if you\nwant to give us the bikes because if we don\u2019t I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. Said ok we\ndon\u2019t care.",
        "A: Four",
        "A: So we took the bikes and we started to run all night long and we\u2019re all looking behind us\nif they\u2019re not chasing us. But it was ok. They did not chase us. We finally found the, came into\na little town and the Russians liked the bikes. And they said but I am really too young to ride a\nbike all the way to Vienna. Just cause we were going to up to Vienna. What do you have in\nVienna? I said we might have some relatives. We don\u2019t know. They said ok. Give us the bikes\nbecause you are too young to ride bikes to Vienna. It\u2019s too far. We\u2019ll put you on the trains. They\nwanted the bikes. So they took us to the station and they said wait for a train. The train will\ncome. You go to Vienna. So we gave them the bikes, have no choice. And we waited. And the\ntrain came and we went to Vienna.",
        "A: No, no there was no tickets in those days. No. Just took a train and we went, came to\nVienna. And we came to Vienna. We got off in Vienna so it\u2019s you cannot walk after 10:00 at\nnight. And we are after 10 so they arrest us and we were coming in.",
        "A: The Russians. The soldiers because after that was that you cannot leave your house after\n10:00.",
        "A: Curfew yeah. And so we were after the curfew so they took us to the station. And so in\nthe station was a believe it or not a Russian Jewish guy so we spoke in Jewish. He spoke Jewish.",
        "A: Yeah so he decided he\u2019s going to send us to a pensione and see to that we should have\nfood and that helped a lot and this is what we did.\n(file 2 \u2014 RG-50.106.0246.02.02; duration: 22:37)\nKatie St. John: This is Katie St. John taking over for Gail Schwartz in the interview of Nathan\nNeiberg on July 24, 2015. So Mr. Neiberg you were telling us that you came to Vienna after the\nwar. So could you tell us a little about that?\nNathan Neiberg: Stayed in Vienna of like a couple of weeks the captain of the post in Vienna,\nthe Russian captain of the post in Vienna assigned us a place to stay in a hotel. And he supplied\nus with food and was very nice to us. After a few weeks I decided to go back to my home town\nin Poland to see who\u2019s left alive. Being in the station train came in from Poland and as the people\nwalked off the train I recognized a few guys that came back from Poland. And I recognized that\nthe war, during the war in the concentration camps. So I walked up to them and said what\u2019s\ngoing on in Poland. And they asked me which town I have come from. And I told them. So they\nsaid don\u2019t go to Poland to see who stayed alive because the Poles don\u2019t look at it, don\u2019t look at\nus welcome. That we should come back there even for a little while. They killed quite a few\nJewish guys that came in to see if their parents are alive or somebody stayed alive in the family.\nSo we advise you not to go back to Poland. But if you want to know go to Hungary. And in,\nthere\u2019s quite a few a lot of Polish Jews that went to Hungary after the war. So go to Hungary.\nFind the, find Budapest. There are camps there. Refugee camps. Inquire there and you\u2019ll know\nmore so there than if you go to Poland, go to your home town. So I decided instead of taking a\ntrain to Poland I took a train to Hungary. In those days there were no, you didn\u2019t have to pay for\nthe seats on the train. You just boarded the train and you just went. And this is what I did. I\ncame into Hungary and I didn\u2019t\u2019 meet there people from my own home town. And they in fact\nthey told me that some of your brothers stayed alive too. But they didn\u2019t know where they are or\nthey didn\u2019t\u2019 see them but they heard from other people that they came across that they feel that\nsome of the Neibergs, Neiberg brothers stayed alive. They don\u2019t know which ones. They might\nhave think about me but they didn\u2019t know. So I stayed a while in Budapest. There was a refugee\ncamp in Budapest also. And then there was that they started to form Zionist groups in the\nrefugee camps with the intentions of eventually going to Israel. At that time it was Palestine. It\nwas not Israel yet there.",
        "A: In Hungary. Decent. Well any place you went after the concentration camps in Germany\nand throughout the war, once it ended, nothing was in comparison to the concentration camps. So\nwhatever you did, it was always a little better then. So the question 1s that how was it. It was\nbetter. But was it good. No, it was just better that you had more food to eat. You weren\u2019t hungry\nand you had some clean clothes to wear. The rest ok.",
        "A: From Hungary?",
        "A: From the refugee. Not really, not really. It was normal you know. As I came, as a\nrefugee camp was, which was mainly that you survived, that you\u2019re not in danger of being killed\nand being beaten up or had to go to work. To work that was it was a horrible type of work. But\nanything, you survived in the camps. You couldn\u2019t\u2019 complain for, there was quite a few a lot of\nrefugees that they just welcomed, and they did a decent job at whatever they could. No\ncomplaints. And then from, so I joined one of those Zionist groups. And decide that Zionist, the\nleaders decided that well we it\u2019s time to move on. We left Hungary and strived to reach Italy.",
        "A: Because from Italy they formed there refugee camps in Italy. That was already refugee\ncamps. And from Italy kind of striving to reach Palestine. That was the last stop before trying to\nreach Palestine. Or you went to France. But we picked Italy. So to reach Italy we had to go\nback to Austria. And we came back to Austria we stayed there for again, for like a month and\nfinally the Jewish brigade that was serving the English army they helped the Jewish group,\nZionist group reaching Italy with their trucks. It was not legal that they did it but they did it.\nThen we went through the Alps from Austria to avoid usual borders. Then we reached northern\nItaly, coming through the Alps. And we were left in Modena, Italy in Modena. It\u2019s close to\nBologna kind of. It\u2019s a nice, nice town. And there was also a Jewish refugee camp kind of that\nthey formed. And we stayed in Bologna a while. Then we left Modena to southern Italy which\nwas Santa Maria. You have it in here.",
        "A: Yes. And stayed in Santa Maria for a while, naturally with the Zionist groups. And we\ndecided from the Zionist group decided really, the leaders of the Zionist group decided that there\nwas a ship which was called the Moleta and they said that you might leave with that ship. And\nwe left with that ship and we reached Cyprus.",
        "A: Well that was available. It was that ship was bought through the Zionist groups through\nthe United States. It was a really a kind of a fishing boat you would say more so. But it was an\nenlarged fishing boat, a luxury fishing boat kind of. And we left in the at that particular time was\nthe blockade of the British navy that they wouldn\u2019t let the Jews into Israel, to Palestine, I mean.\nAnd they used to know the kind of route we took from Italy to Palestine and they were\ncontrolling that particular route. And they always used to catch the illegal ships trying to come to\nPalestine. And we were caught by them and we were brought to Haifa. They took us off from\nthe ships that we came on. They were raiding us. Well we had a light fight with them before they\ntook us, took over the ship. We threw at them rotten tomatoes and they got a little angry with us\nbut it was over and they attached us to their ship and brought us into Haifa. In Haifa we had to\nleave the ship that we came on and they transferred us to a, to one of their ships. And they took\nus to Cyprus.",
        "A: I would say another kind of at 100, between 150 to 100 people that we were.",
        "A: Correct yes and we were taken to Cyprus and must be familiar with Cyprus Camps right.\nOk so we stayed in Cyprus for quite a while. From Cyprus when they declared the state of Israel\nnaturally they let us go to come into Israel at that time. And \u2014",
        "A: While Cyprus was a camp that you just were imprisoned. We were not doing anything\nreally. Except we were doing you know in groups things to send out great teachers from\nPalestine and we used to study the Bible, all these, all kinds of lessons. There was kind of like a\nformed school that whoever wanted to attend was welcome there. This was the major things that\nwe did. There was no work to be done. Yeah there was work that we all had to day, give a day in\nthe kitchen about wash dishes or something of that nature so we all always were available if they\nneeded some people but as far as really working, there was no work.",
        "A: Correct. Just on education and English supplied the food and it was ok. Can\u2019t complain\nthat they didn\u2019t gas or beat you up there. It was normal way of life, a normal way of life in the\ncamp. Being imprisoned. And naturally we stayed in Cyprus, the Jewish group, in that camp\nuntil they declared the state of Israel. Soon as they declared the state of Israel, they all let us out.\nNot out, they I think the Israeli formed government sent ships to bring us back to Israel. Not\nback but to bring us to Israel.",
        "A: Oh absolutely. Oh yes, great celebrations. Great everybody was just like in heaven. Then\nafter those celebrations the ship came to pick us up. Came in but naturally the majority of us\nwho wanted to been to a kibbutz or just do whatever you want to do. But the majority was we all\nwent in the army. And til the war ended and we became really a country. Then this was the end\nof it.",
        "A: Well I had two brothers here and a sister. And they really wanted, they wanted me to join\nthem which I wasn\u2019t too happy to leave Israel. I liked where I was. I was doing pretty well there.\nBut eventually they convinced me that we should be together. So I had to decide. They were, I\nwas the youngest so I thought they kind of, and I this is when I decided to come to the United\nStates.",
        "A: 52. Right after the war of the independence, when the war of independence ended.\nWhen I got out from the army at that time.",
        "A: Well I was working already there in Israel.",
        "A: I was only working in the port of, in Haifa port for a while. In the administration. And\nfrom there kind of I then took the United States, I decided and that was it.",
        "A: Yes, yes. The usual thing.",
        "A: No straight to Chicago. Yeah because my two brothers and sister were in Chicago at that\ntime. Naturally I -- And that was the happy ending.",
        "A: It was great, it was great together with my family. Eventually got married. And had three\nkids and one of them is sitting right behind me, my daughter. Now she has kids. And that\u2019s\nwhat I did.",
        "A: No as I think about it, I can send it or something about it. Right?",
        "A: No that\u2019s about, that\u2019s about it.\nMan (asks question): The period of time from when you went to Israel and then, your train \u2014",
        "A: We all went to be a soldier. And actually ok, Jack thank you. Thank you yeah, yes.",
        "A: Well we had to go into the army, it was no question about it. we were all healthy by that\ntime. We recoup from the camps and so we been coming to Israel. We were all over 18 already.\nI think. And we went, I went into the army and stayed in the Army for a while and by luck they\ntook me into the Navy for a while. So I stayed in the after, stayed in the Navy for most of my\nbeing in the Army really. And",
        "A: Well I you know when I was in Italy I did go a little bit to school in Italy. And it was the\nmaritime school, scholastic school in Ancona. SO [had kind of like a test which the Army\nknew about and they needed people that had some type of a, a little education about it so they\nreally picked me and they felt since we haven\u2019t got too many Jewish sailors and you had a little\nbit of schooling about it. So they just picked me and I joined the Navy.",
        "A: Well I started off as a regular sailor and then I was promoted to be the boson. Boson\nmeant to be the head of the sailors. Kind of, it was a kind of a little rank. And stayed there like\nwell I volunteered for an additional year while I was there. What was my time for, to get out of\nit was, they asked me if I wanted to stay for an additional year. I said well I signed for an\nadditional year. They said, I liked it. And then once the year elapsed, I got into the civilian life\nand that was it. Became you know in the again worked in the administration in the port of Haifa\nuntil I came to the United States.",
        "A: Well it was the war like any other war. You know. it\u2019s nothing special. You got your\nyou know maneuvers and fightings but I was in the Army. The Navy saw very little fightings.\nBecause it was skirmishes but nothing special. Just watched the borders. The water borders on\nthe Mediterranean. And that was, that was the end and then that as I said I got into the\nadministration and worked at Haifa port. That was the end of it.",
        "A: We made yes, anger yes, but tougher soldiers no. The sabras was just as tough. As us.\nthey were just as angry and dedicated as we were. We weren\u2019t any more dedicated than they,\nreally born young people at those days in Israel. We were on equal, maybe a little, we were a\nlittle bit maybe more dedicated than the influx of Americans, the few Americans that came in\nand wanted to be officers running the Army. But they did a great job. They did a great job.\nThey were in the American Army and they knew more so about armies than we did. That\u2019s true.",
        "A: No, not yet, not yet. No. I spoke a little bit of Italian.",
        "A: I was in school for a little bit yes. I was, as I mentioned, I was in Ancona in this ,",
