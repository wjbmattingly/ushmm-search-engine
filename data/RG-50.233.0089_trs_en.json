        "A: My name is Arthur R. Menke. I was born in Hamburg, Germany, in the year 1927, February\n234,",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t we start off by you telling me a little bit about your childhood and your parents.",
        "A: I had a father whose age was at that time 55 and my mother at that time was 46 and I had a\nsister at the age of 17.",
        "Q: You had one sister? And that was the only sibling?",
        "A: Yes. We lived in a very nice neighborhood in Hamburg, Germany, and we had to leave that\nneighborhood and apartment we lived in because Jews were no longer allowed in that part of\ntown. It was too good for them.",
        "Q: What time frame are you talking about?",
        "A: That was, I would say, in about, \u201938.",
        "Q: \"38?",
        "A: 1938.",
        "Q: Up until that time, I know this is going to be hard to try to remember, especially because you\nwere that young, but do you remember any of the time, around the time that Hitler came to\npower?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Of course, I was born in \u201927 but I vividly remember say around \u00b035 and that\u2019s when\nthe Jews were starting to suffer. And it was maybe around \u201938 when the Jews, like I said, were\nresettled in another part of town and we were not allowed to shop in regular stores. It was\nstores assigned especially to Jews with the merchandise was higher. We were also\nbenches which said \u201cno Jews allowed\u2019. You couldn\u2019t go to a movie. And there were severe\nrestrictions. I\u2019m sure you recall Crystal Night, I don\u2019t think we have to get into that. I\u2019m sure\nyou know that. When the German official was killed in France and that was supposed to be a\npunishment to punish the Jews for that and that\u2019s how Crystal Night originated and at that time\nmy father was taken to a concentration camp near Berlin for six weeks. They came to the house\nto arrest my father and he was at the place of business and ordered my mother not to contact\nhim and they went and arrested him. And he came back after six weeks a broken man. He was\nhardly recognizable. And at that time the Nazis had taken over all German owned businesses\nand they were government run, so my father\u2019s business, he had a small factory producing\nrubber and signs, etc. and that business was taken over by the government and his bank account\nwas taken and we were only allowed to draw a small amount of our own money at the time and\nmy father was forced to work as a laborer packing shoes in a factory.",
        "Q: Do you remember when you were a small child, about this time, was there a lot of anti-Semitic\novertones, by the children, especially?",
        "A: Well, the anti-Semitism, it was a lot worse in smaller towns first. Small villages, as a matter of\nfact, it was so bad that the people who lived in smaller towns went to the bigger cities because\nthere was less anti-Semitism. Now, the German Jew, if you want to use the term integrated, he\nwas not like the Polish Jew who was discriminated by the Poles many, many years before the\nGerman Jew was. And so, the German Jew was a proud German. Like my father fought for\nGermany in 1914-18 and was discharged a proud German soldier defending his country. And\nthe German Jews were dumb enough to believe that what\u2019s happened to the Polish Jews,\nbecause the Polish Jews suffered sooner than the German Jews. \u201cOh, this will never happen to\nus. We are German, first before we are Jewish.\u201d But I recall being taken out of the school, I\nwas enrolled in a German high school called \u201cTalmud Torah\u201d which 1s still standing today.",
        "Q: That was a public high school or a Jewish school?",
        "A: Jewish school. And they also had a girl\u2019s school where my sister went. It was a highlik a real\nfine school and we were well educated. Of course that was too good for the Jews again and the\nbuilding was taken over by the Germans and we were all forced into a small school with the\ngirls. Of course, there was a lot of immigration at that time and my mother saw the handwriting\non the wall and wanted to get out of Germany. But I recall saying to my father, \u201c you don\u2019t\nhave a trade, it would be difficult to start over again\u2019 so they procrastinated until 1t was too late.\nWe did try to leave Germany in the late \u201830\u2019s but it was too late.",
        "Q: You said something earlier about being moved within Hamburg. Was that a ghetto set up in\nHamburg?",
        "A: Not really. It was a neighborhood where more Jewish people lived already.",
        "Q: Before the Nazis?",
        "A: Yes. The neighborhood I lived in was on the other side of the river which was a much nicer\nneighborhood.",
        "Q: And they moved you into",
        "A: Yes. And I was not welcome at the school either, any more, I was going to a public school\nthere.",
        "Q: Do you remember when you moved, what kind of feelings you had at that time?",
        "A: Well, as a child, it didn\u2019t bother us at all. But of course, it was a terrible thing for my parents to\ngo through. As a matter of fact, we had a real nice home at that part of town and at first we all\nlived, the whole family, in a rented room, you know. It was a trauma, at that time already.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s see, you talk a little bit about Kristallnacht, do you remember anything specific about that\nnight that happened to you or your family?",
        "A: Well, I know that all the Jewish businesses were totally destroyed including huge department\nstores like Hecht Company. Hashta is the name all over Germany today and they taken furs and\nthrew them in the river and the people that owned automobiles were destroyed. The strange\npart is that my father\u2019s business was not destroyed because people didn\u2019t realize that my father\nwas a Jew. So his business was not destroyed.",
        "Q: Is there any reason for that, that they might not think that he was a Jew or did they just not\nknow, is that",
        "A: They did not realize that he was a Jew and like I said earlier, the German Jew was first German.\nI want to tell you a little incident. There was a Nazi holiday and of course the Jews would not\ndisplay their flag. My sister and I would make a flag out of a sheet and hang out which my\nparents naturally reeled back in again. Just to give you a sample like there was no difference.",
        "Q: Do you remember much about any friends in school that you had at that time in the\nneighborhood, especially from the children if there were any anti-Semitic",
        "A: Yes, because they were agitated by their parents. We had to wear a Star of David with the name\nJew written in and the letters were made in such a way that they looked like Hebrew, said\nGerman Jew, and it had to be worn on the outer clothes.",
        "Q: From what time was this?",
        "A: That started also in the late \u201830\u2019s. I would say \u00b038 and the kids would throw stones, you know\nkids are cruel and not being allowed to go many places, was a hardship on the kids.",
        "Q: Do you remember what life was like, we\u2019re not talking about a ghetto here but the\nneighborhood you moved to, was it guarded by the Nazis?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Was it free going back and forth?",
        "A: Yes it was. And even at that time there were plenty Germans who were not Nazis but they were\nscared not to be Nazis. I remember as a little boy I worked 1n a little store they were selling\nhealth food and I took the deliveries for him. Beautiful people. But I also remember taking the\npackages to the post office, other kids would tear the labels off, you know, being Jewish, and\ncausing problems and things.",
        "Q: How did you work at this store?",
        "A: It was a little part-time job. After school I worked there. There were Germans that my family\nknew who befriended us who were strictly against the system. I'll tell you how bad it was. One\nchild remarked in school he overheard his parents the night before saying that some law that\nHitler made was ridiculous or, I can\u2019t get the detail; anyway this man, this Christian man,\ngentile man, was arrested by the German Gestapo and eight weeks later his wife received an urn\nof ashes, they killed him. So the kids were scared of their parents. You were not allowed to\nlisten to foreign broadcasts, like England and America were separate, so neighbors would turn\nother neighbors in that they were listening to foreign broadcasts and they were severely\npunished. You inquired of what type of neighborhood it was. Well, it was not a bad\nneighborhood. The living quarters were difficult to find and we didn\u2019t live as nice as we did\nbefore. We didn\u2019t starve. It was just a different type of living. We were under pressure all the\ntime like we were an enemy of your own country. And like I said earlier, a lot of people started\nto deport, they had enough sense to get out of there.",
        "Q: Did a lot of people, were they able to get out? Was it more restricted as time went on?",
        "A: Well, there was a point where Hitler wanted the people to get out. Of course, they had to have\nvisas in order to come to this country. They had to be sponsored. So that sometimes created a\nproblem. You had to have someone. They also had Jewish organizations, I think it was HIAS\nand others that assisted Jews from leaving. And then of course, you had to have a certain\namount of money to leave and since my own bank account, my father\u2019s bank account was taken\nover, at that time, 1t was almost impossible to leave so when we wanted to leave in the late\n\u2018\u00b030\u2019s, we couldn\u2019t leave anymore. My father wanted to go to Australia, that\u2019s what he hoped to\ndo but it didn\u2019t work out.",
        "Q: You talked about freezing your bank accounts. Were you allowed an allowance, is that how it\nworked?",
        "A: To the best of my knowledge, he was allowed a certain amount.",
        "Q: A certain amount a month or a week?",
        "A: Yes, but it wasn\u2019t enough so my father had to work.",
        "Q: You said before that there was no real hunger in this neighborhood that you were in?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. There was food and everything was available and there was food on the\ntable. There was no real hardship like I said earlier, there was only certain stores where Jews\ncould do their shopping. They were state operated.",
        "Q: All the stores they could go to or were certain stores with certain hours.",
        "A: Certain stores at certain hours. They were operated by the state.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t we move on here to your deportation? Tell me a little that. How it happened.",
        "A: It happened you received a letter through the mail. As a matter of fact, the postman knew of\nthese letters and he normally would ring the doorbell when he had mail for us. He didn\u2019t do it\nthis time because he was a decent guy. The contents of the letter would give us an order to\nvacate our apartment within so many hours and we were allowed so many pounds per person to\ntake with us and then we were told in that same letter that we had to take our own key to our\napartment to take to the local police station. I also want to add this that the gold and furs and\nother things, we had to turn in earlier already, anything of value.",
        "Q: They seized your valuables.",
        "A: They seized. Of course, some people didn\u2019t give it all up but there was a drive for that. So\nwhen we received our notice, we bought warm socks. I think we were allowed 100 pounds at\nfirst.",
        "Q: What did you bring, do you remember?",
        "A: You know, a backpack. Sweaters, warm underwear, clothing, extra shoes. And we had to report\nto a Masonic temple. Now I might want to add that the Masonic temple was also against the\nlaw to exist and my father was a mason and he went to secret meetings even.",
        "Q: Freemason?",
        "A: Yes. And we went to this temple, which the inside was all marble and completely destroyed on\nthe inside. And we laid on the floor for the night and the Germans ordered us any cash money\nwe had to turn in, any rings and so on, they made a last little pitch to get the stuff off and that\nwas the first time we were guarded. We were loaded on open trucks and taken to the railroad\nstation and loaded into regular railroad cars, not cattle cars, railroad cars.",
        "Q: They had seats and everything?",
        "A: They had seats and everything in it. They were old cars, most had seats. Some had to lay on\nthe floor. And we traveled I believe it was three days and three nights to Russia.",
        "Q: Let me back track just a little bit. When the letter came, did they give you any indication as to\nwhere you might be going, what you might be doing?",
        "A: I think we were told we were going to the east to work.",
        "Q: Okay, go ahead.",
        "A: Now, I may have mentioned earlier that many transports that arrived in Minsk were killed right\non the spot.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s where you arrived, in Minsk?",
        "A: Yes, Minsk, it was White Russia, German occupational Russia. Most people don\u2019t understand\nthat.",
        "Q: What time frame, what are we talking about, what year?",
        "A: 1940.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s when you were deported?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay, back to Minsk, sorry.",
        "A: In Minsk we were marched, it was very cold, we were marched into an area which was at one\ntime a Russian school. Now we were a transport of a 1,000 people. That Russian school was at\nthat time occupied by Russian Jews. And they had to vacate that building to put us into that\nbuilding. It appeared that at one time it was a fairly modern school. It had running water. The\nfaucets didn\u2019t work, the toilets didn\u2019t work but you could tell it was a regular high school like\nwe almost have in this country. And we already saw a lot of dead people on the ground at this\ntime, Russian Jews that were killed by the Germans that didn\u2019t evacuate the building fast\nenough.",
        "Q: They were in the building or around the grounds?",
        "A: They were in the building. It was part of a ghetto then.",
        "Q: And this was in the wintertime, right?",
        "A: It was in the wintertime. And we then gathered old mattresses and stuff and we stayed 1n that\nbuilding and there was another building, other small out buildings and that\u2019s where we stayed at\nthe time.",
        "Q: Did you go out and work from there, 1s that what you did?",
        "A: The first couple of days I don\u2019t think we did but then we were put to work. As a matter of fact,\nwe had to build our own fences to go around there.\n"

        "A: It happened you received a letter through the mail. As a matter of fact, the postman knew of\nthese letters and he normally would ring the doorbell when he had mail for us. He didn\u2019t do it\nthis time because he was a decent guy. The contents of the letter would give us an order to\nvacate our apartment within so many hours and we were allowed so many pounds per person to\ntake with us and then we were told in that same letter that we had to take our own key to our\napartment to take to the local police station. I also want to add this that the gold and furs and\nother things, we had to turn in earlier already, anything of value.",
        "A: They seized. Of course, some people didn\u2019t give it all up but there was a drive for that. So\nwhen we received our notice, we bought warm socks. I think we were allowed 100 pounds at\nfirst.",
        "A: You know, a backpack. Sweaters, warm underwear, clothing, extra shoes. And we had to report\nto a Masonic temple. Now I might want to add that the Masonic temple was also against the\nlaw to exist and my father was a mason and he went to secret meetings even.",
        "A: Yes. And we went to this temple, which the inside was all marble and completely destroyed on\nthe inside. And we laid on the floor for the night and the Germans ordered us any cash money\nwe had to turn in, any rings and so on, they made a last little pitch to get the stuff off and that\nwas the first time we were guarded. We were loaded on open trucks and taken to the railroad\nstation and loaded into regular railroad cars, not cattle cars, railroad cars.",
        "A: They had seats and everything in it. They were old cars, most had seats. Some had to lay on\nthe floor. And we traveled I believe it was three days and three nights to Russia.",
        "A: I think we were told we were going to the east to work.",
        "A: Now, I may have mentioned earlier that many transports that arrived in Minsk were killed right\non the spot.",
        "A: Yes, Minsk, it was White Russia, German occupational Russia. Most people don\u2019t understand\nthat.",
        "A: 1940.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: In Minsk we were marched, it was very cold, we were marched into an area which was at one\ntime a Russian school. Now we were a transport of a 1,000 people. That Russian school was at\nthat time occupied by Russian Jews. And they had to vacate that building to put us into that\nbuilding. It appeared that at one time it was a fairly modern school. It had running water. The\nfaucets didn\u2019t work, the toilets didn\u2019t work but you could tell it was a regular high school like\nwe almost have in this country. And we already saw a lot of dead people on the ground at this\ntime, Russian Jews that were killed by the Germans that didn\u2019t evacuate the building fast\nenough.",
        "A: They were in the building. It was part of a ghetto then.",
        "A: It was in the wintertime. And we then gathered old mattresses and stuff and we stayed 1n that\nbuilding and there was another building, other small out buildings and that\u2019s where we stayed at\nthe time.",
        "A: The first couple of days I don\u2019t think we did but then we were put to work. As a matter of fact,\nwe had to build our own fences to go around there.\n"
