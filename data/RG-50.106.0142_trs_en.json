        "A: Well, I know for a fact that the Schnogs lived in the region in Germany, in the\nCologne region for several hundred years back. How \u2014 how far back, I think probably\nsomewhere in the 1700\u2019s is how far we\u2019ve been able to trace them. I don\u2019t know the\nexact date and we don\u2019t know exactly the lineage, who \u2014 whose parents they were,\nbut the family goes back at least that far, and probably longer.",

        "A: My mother\u2019s family lived in Germany, wa \u2014 1-in the region just near Poland. We\ndon\u2019t know very much about them. I know only that her grandparents were there, and\nher parents and of course she was.

The name was \u2014 or the person who had founded\nthe business, it was named Lisauer(ph). And they had offices in Cologne as well as in\nsome cities Overseas, Over \u2014 overseas to Germany anyway.",
        "Q: Did your mother work?",
        "A: My mother was employed early in her life as a secretary. When she married my\nfather she stopped working and raised a family, so she was generally a housewife, but\nshe worked for many years as a secretary.",
        "Q: Did you have a large extended family in Cologne or in other parts of the country?",
        "A: We had family, we had certainly, uncles and aunts. My grandparents lived in\nCologne, in a suburb of Cologne. Deutz was the name of the suburb and they owned\nMarch 10, 2001\na house there and we were frequently over there, obviously. I loved my grandparents,\nwe were very close and \u2014",
        "Q: These are your paternal grandparents?",
        "A: Paternal grandparents. My maternal grandparents had died long, long before I was\nborn, and the only member of that family that I remember was my mother\u2019s sister,\nwho was about 10 years older than she was. She lived in Berlin at the time and we\nwent to visit them, but only once and I remember that visit very well, I was quite\nyoung, must have been, oh perhaps four years old or five years old at the oldest and it\nwas an interesting visit because as youngsters the two of us was very \u2014 were very\nexcited to go to Berlin. We went there and when we walked to the house they had a\nlittle dog, and it was a Spitz, I think, terrier. And you opened the dog and the \u2014 door\nand the dog jumped up on us and we were frightened to death, a fear that I had until I\ngot my own dogs some many years later. But that\u2019s the only recollection I have of\nmy maternal relatives.",
        "Q: A-And their names were?",
        "A: Let me see.",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "A: I may not \u2014 I\u2014I should know this.",
        "Q: Well, we\u2019ll come back to it, that\u2019s okay.",
        "A: Probably remember it later.\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "Q: Yeah. Let\u2019s talk a little bit about your family itself. Was it a very \u2014 your\nimmediate family, was it a very religious family, or a secular?",
        "A: That\u2019s an interesting question. As far as I know, we were secular. My \u2014 my\ngrandparents, my grandfather was not terribly religious, but my grandmother was,\nshe was quite observant. My aunt, my father\u2019s sister, her name was Selma, was also, I\nthink, religious. She \u2014 she was a spinster and lived with my gran \u2014 my father\u2019s\nparents. My \u2014 my mother kept a kosher home and as they have told me that during\nthe Hitler years they became more involved with religion than they had been before\nbecause they were s \u2014 ostracized by the German community and therefore drew\ncloser to the Jewish community and there was sort of a \u2014 a renaissance of religion\nduring that period of time amongst Jews and they were a part of that. Were they \u2014\nand my mother would not have kept a kosher home if it weren\u2019t for my grandparents.\nShe did that for them and for \u2014 for my father and then of course, we were brought up\nin that fashion until we came to the United States much later, which time all that was\n\u2014 well, I wouldn\u2019t say all of that was dropped, I think for a few \u2014 a few years here I\nhad religious education, and then we sort of drifted away from the formality of\nreligion, and religion not a terribly important thing in our lives.",
        "Q: Do you remember any specific holidays as a \u2014 in your early childhood in\nGermany? Any memories of those?\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: Oh yes, I remember very vividly going to temple on Simchas Torah, and the\ntemple is Conservative Orthodox, you know, where of course, the women sat upstairs\nin the balcony and the men were worshipping downstairs and as children we were\nwith the men, as boys. And I remember that holiday so well because during the\nservice, the mothers would throw candy down from the balcony, and my brother and\nI did everything we could to gather up as much of it as we could. It was a delight, and\nI remember it very fondly.",
        "Q: What about home ritual, did you observe the Shabbat or Passover?",
        "A: Yes, we observed Shabbat and it was a kosher f \u2014 kosher house, and certainly\nobserved the Passover. And for any child, of course, Hanukkah was the m \u2014 was a\nmajor holiday and that was always celebrated. And one of the things that I do also\nremember, going to my grandparents\u2019 home, they lived in a \u2014 what I could best\ndescribe as a \u2014 looked like a browns \u2014 what a brownstone would look like today.\nThey lived on the lower floors and there was a yard in the back, rectangular yard. It\nwas walled in on three sides, but at the house. And in that little yard, which was just\ndelightful, there was a \u2014 always a sukkah. So on the holiday of Sukkos we would go\nthere and I would marvel at all the interesting things that were hung from the sukkah\nand the \u2014 and then we went to temple from there, and so those were my recollections\nreally, of the holidays.\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Did you live in a Jewish neighborhood or were there \u2014 was it\nmixed?",
        "A: I would say 1-it -- where we lived it was mixed, very, very much so mixed. My\ngrandparents \u2014 Deutz was the \u2014 where they lived was a \u2014 for I guess going back\nmany hundreds of years must have been kind of a ghetto for Jews, a Jewish \u2014a\nJewish area. I -- I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a ghetto in the common sense today, but 1t was an\narea that was populated mostly by Jews, and the synagogue with \u2014 the Cologne\nsynagogue was there, the \u2014 one of the major ones was right in that area, very near by.\nSo they were more \u2014 in a\u2014 in a more Jewish area and my parents and we lived in \u2014 in\na more modern area of \u2014 of Cologne.",
        "Q: What \u2014 what street did you live on?",
        "A: I remember it very well, 1t \u2014 the name of the street was the univeri(ph) \u2014\nUniversitat strasse, University street. And we had an apartment on either the first or\nsecond floor, I don\u2019t quite recall whether 1\u2014 whether it was right on \u2014 no, it was on\nthe ground floor, I\u2019m sure of that. And across the street was a very large park, and \u2014\nwhich was very interesting for my brother and I. We would look out of the window\non \u2014 particularly on weekends and all kinds of interesting things happened. Hot air\nballoons would be \u2014 would be launched from there, and of course there were a\nmultitude of parades, with military music and the \u2014 and the Nazi youth and all of that,\nwhich was for a child at least, an eye opener, interesting to see. We never really were\nMarch 10, 2001\na part of that, as you would understand, but we could see it all going on. It was quite\ncolorful, and \u2014 and interesting.",
        "Q: You were obviously quite young then. Did it mean anything to you to see these\nNazi parades with these flags and uniforms? Or what did 1t mean to you as a young \u2014\nvery young child?",
        "A: Well, we were pretty well indoctrinated as to what the Nazis were doing. Our\nparents did not keep any secrets from us. And we were \u2014 it was there, we felt totally\napart from it. We felt as though we were not welcome to join it. This was for\nGermans and that Jews were not welcome in these \u2014 in these circles, or at least in this\ncrowd. And although we looked on it with interest, and possibly as a child with\nlonging to be a part of something, we knew that it was beyond us to be able to be a\npart of it. Just wasn\u2019t possible, and did we feel ostracized by it? I don\u2019t think so, not\nin that way. I think my feelings were that it would be nice if we could be a part of all\nof this, but no, it was \u2014 it was not \u2014 it was not to be and there was too much fear\nattendant to trying to be a part of that. We knew we wouldn\u2019t \u2014",
        "Q: Because\u201d?",
        "A: We knew we wouldn\u2019t be welcome.",
        "Q: How did you know?",
        "A: Well, we had any number of personalized experiences in that \u2014 this was a time\nwhen we started school, and we were \u2014 we went to a Jewish school, which I think\nMarch 10, 2001\nwa-was already at that time forbidden for Jews to go to the public schools or to the \u2014\nto other schools, we had to be in separate schools. And in those schools, walking\nhome from school, we were often chased by Nazi youth. We made it our business to\nstay out of their way as much as we could because we knew that they would taunt us\nas we went from school back to home. But it didn\u2019t happen all that frequently, just,\nyou know, once \u2014 oh, it\u2019s so difficult for me to remember how often, but it did \u2014 1t \u2014\nall that has to do is happen once and you remember it, as a child. And we did, we just\n\u2014my brother and I learned how to run very fast and we ran. We went \u2014 ran home,\nand that was that, when they bother us.",
        "Q: You \u2014 you used the expression Germans and Jews. Did you not feel German in\nany way\u201d?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have a sense of nationality, not at that age. I kn-knew we lived in \u2014 in the\ncountry that we lived in, which was Germany, Deutschland, that was our country, but\nmy association was that we were really not a part of 1t because of our Jewishness. My\nparents I don\u2019t think had that feeling so much. They felt themselves as being German.\nAnd \u2014 but they made it clear to us how unwelcome the Jews were and I \u2014 there were\nother incidents that I can relate to you where I was \u2014 where I recall how they tried to\nd\u2014to keep Jews out. So, did I feel German? I knew I was there, I had no sense of\nnationality, I was perhaps too young to have that sense of nationality. I do know that\nI was very much interested in geography. My parents spoke often of America and\nMarch 10, 2001\nthat was very interesting for us. You know, where is America and what is happening\nthere, and why is it so great, and \u2014 because they made it sound very, very interesting,\netcetera. And then we learned ab \u2014 all about \u2014 my father was \u2014 tr-traveled a lot. So\nwhen he was abroad and he \u2014 all those years, even during the Nazi period, he was\ntraveling in Great Britain and in Holland and he told us about his trips. And this was\nall very fascinating for us. So, we were in \u2014 I never really had a \u2014 you \u2014 to get back to\nyour original question, I never had a sense of nationality at the time. Fascinating\ninterest with the world and different countries, but no sense of nationalism.",
        "Q: What language did you speak at home?",
        "A: We spoke German. That was the only language that we knew. Just to step back,\nwhich gives you an idea of the \u2014 the way I became aware of being a Jew, and how\nunwelcome we really were, not just from what my parents said, but you would go to\nshops or look, and you would see signs in the store windows, Jews\nungerwurnscht(ph), not wanted. And you felt strange going into those shops,\nalthough shopkeepers often didn\u2019t care. They \u2014 they welcomed you because they \u2014\nyou were after all, a client, you were going to spend some money and they would\nhappily sell you things. But the signs, nevertheless were in the windows and in the\ndoors. One in particular I think goes back. We used to go to a beach on the Rhine and\nmy mother took the two of us, Norbert and myself there quite frequently during the\nsummers and we would enjoy bathing in the Rhine. I wanted to learn how to swim.\nMarch 10, 2001\nThe interesting thing is how they taught swimming in those days, they put the student\non a long string attached to its waist and on a pole and just held them there in the\nwater so that they\u2019d learn how to swim. We were too young for that, but we had the\nwish to learn how and be a part of that. Anyway, we\u2019d go to the \u2014 to the beach quite\nfrequently, and it was a lot of fun. Kids love that, and we loved it. Then one day we\nwent and there was a sign, Juden ungerwurnscht(ph) and my mother -- and I s-saw\nthe sign and my mother pointed it out to us and she went to the proprietor of that\nbeach and se \u2014 and said, what does this mean? I mean, we\u2019ve been coming here for\nyears. Oh, oh, no, it \u2014 she said, this doesn\u2019t apply to you, you can \u2014 you can come,\nbut you know, we have to have these signs. So although we \u2014 we went, the comfort\nlevel of going there suddenly went down several s \u2014 degrees \u2014 more than several\ndegrees, quite a lot and we learned at a young age that we were somehow different,\nthat because we were Jews, we were not part of the general public in \u2014 in Germany.\nWe learned it also when we took trips with my parents on weekends to go to \u2014 th-the\nRhineland has got many, many interesting historical sites and castles etcetera, which\nchildren love to see, and we would go there and often there would be the sign, no\nJews allowed. We sometimes ignored those signs and sometimes it was a little too\nuncomfortable and we just went \u2014 did not go there, or my parents chose not to go\nthere. Perhaps they knew where they were serious about not having Jews and where\nthey weren\u2019t. The Rhineland overall was not \u2014 I don\u2019t think the people in the\nMarch 10, 2001\nRhineland were all that much in love with the Hitler era, that administration, and\nmany of them did not agree with what was going on. But nevertheless, they had to\nlive their lives and they did what they were told, as all good Germans did in those\ndays, but still found ways to tolerate the Jews who lived amongst them. Except for a\nfew. Obviously there were always those who were rabid Nazis and who you had to\nstay out of their way of and \u2014 and for me as a child, particularly the \u2014 the youngsters\nwho were part of the Hitler youth, who m-made it their business if they did s-see\nJews to at least taunt them, if not physically assault them. I don\u2019t remember ever\nbeing physically assaulted, but we did lead fairly normal lives as children, aside from\nthis discrimination. My brother and I used to \u2014 we found our way to the circus once.\nWhen we were supposed to be coming home from school we got on a train and we\nwanted the circus so badly we hopped aboard a streetcar and went out to the circus.\nAnd of course my mother was beside herself, why didn't the boys come home? But\nthose are the kinds of events I think that most children do. You could do this and\nthere was no fear that somebody would harm you and take you away or steal you, or\nwhat have you. You could \u2014 we \u2014 we felt no danger in doing those things. Perhaps\nmy parents were concerned, but my brother and I were not. Then of course, things\ngot a little bit more dicey and \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, we \u2014 we\u2019ll get to that in a minute. Talking about you and your brother, how\nwould you describe yourself? Were you a \u2014 it sounds like you were a little\nMarch 10, 2001\nindependent child there. W-Were you, or were you different from your brother, or\nhow would you characterize each of you?",
        "A: Well we were \u2014 we were close as youngsters, so we did everything together and\nwhen we had a desire to do something, at least we had somebody to do it with. So,\nwe were adventuresome. I don\u2019t think that we were abnormally risqu\u00e9. We did the\nthings we wanted to, but we also hewed to being home and \u2014 and doing our studies\nand listening to the things that we needed to, listen to our parents, and when they said\nja\u2014 do your homework, we did our homework and all those things. So we were not\nwild, as such, but we had our moments when we wanted to go out and have some\nfun, and we did.",
        "Q: Were you an athletic child? A physically strong child?",
        "A: N-Not at that age, we were too young. Athletics didn\u2019t mean very much at age six,\nseven, or five. Four, five, six, seven. [inaudible]",
        "Q: I meant you weren't \u2014 you weren\u2019t frail.",
        "A: No, no, no, by no means. I think we were rather normal in many ways. One of the\nthings that I remember those \u2014 those years, was that it was always difficult for my\nparents to get all the things they needed in the store. Things were in short supply,\nparticularly things like milk, eggs, all kinds of foodstuffs. Germany was not well\nsupplied in those things and there were always shortages and of course we depended\non the goodwill of the Christian shopkeepers, or the German shopkeepers and they \u2014\nMarch 10, 2001\nas I said before, there were always those who made it their business to help out and\nwe found that \u2014 my mother always found means to bring in what we needed to\nsubsist on and all \u2014 often \u2014 I-I don\u2019t remember us starving, I don\u2019t remember us\nhaving any difficulty in \u2014 in getting the things, the substance that we need \u2014 the\nsubsistence things that we needed. I do know, I remember my mother talking about\nhow har -- difficult it was to get these things, and there was one event that I guess\nepitomizes, that we went \u2014 we were going to go to my grandparents in Deutz and we\n\u2014my father loaded us in the car and he had gotten \u2014 apparently in \u2014 in Deutz my\ngrandparents couldn\u2019t get all the food that they wanted and he had gotten some fresh\neggs, which were also in very short supply, he got them in our area, or through his\nfriends there. And we had set off and shortly, I think, before or after we got to the\nbridge that goes across the Rhine to Deutz, a \u2014 another car sides \u2014 hit us from the\nside. It was a major blow and I wound up with a cut on my leg and wound up in the\nhospital, my mother wound up in the hospital with a cut on her scalp. And the only\nones who really got free from it \u2014 Norbert also wound up with something, but not\nvery much. My father was not injured. But during the time, he was so concerned \u2014\nyou know how nervous one gets when something like that happens, his first thought\nwas oh my gosh, the eggs. And he picked them up and he put them in his pocket.\nAnd of course they were all smashed in his pocket. But that gives you the idea of\nhow scarce these foodstuffs were, that he would think of that in a m \u2014 in a moment of\nMarch 10, 2001\npanic or trauma, to save those eggs to get them to the grandparents, which was the\nimportant thing. And we wound up in the hospital at that time, 1n a Catholic hospital,\nand it was Passover, and I remember the \u2014 the nuns in white habit and also in black\nhabit coming, taking care of us and they were very, very nice, we had a doctor, an-\nand I needed some stitches in my leg and it was all done. When they brought up the\nfood, of course, it \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to eat it. It was Passover, we were taught that\nPassover has to be kosher and it has to be matzoh etcetera, so I s \u2014 spoke up and I\nsaid that to the nuns, and they understood it completely and took care of us and\nbrought us what we \u2014 what we would need for that. I do think that the religious\ninstitutions, the hospitals, the Catholic church recognized, at least from that\nexperience, recognized more that there were customs that other \u2014 others hewed to,\nand they respected that. I think they respected any type of religion, as long as it was\nreligion. And so I\u2019ve \u2014 I did not feel that we were badly cared for because we were\nJews, it was \u2014 certainly didn -- didn\u2019t have that feeling at that time.",
        "Q: You said you saw signs, no Jews allowed. What does that mean to a six year old,\nseven year old that knows how to read? Ho-how did \u2014 how \u2014",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 it means that you are somehow an underclass. You are not part of\nsociety as a whole, you are not seen as everybody else. You ask yourself the question\nwhy, but there\u2019s no answer. And you ask your parents, and the parents say your \u2014\nyou\u2019re Jewish. They explain to you a little bit of the history and of the pogroms and\nMarch 10, 2001\nof the many things that Jews have been \u2014 how \u2014 how often they\u2019ve been the \u2014 the\nobject of a pogrom or of discrimination everywhere, and that was in Germany. You\nknow, there was a \u2014 there was always an undercurrent of anti-Semitism in Germany,\nthat predated Hitler. So \u2014 and as a \u2014 as a Jew, you \u2014 what is \u2014 a Jewish child, you\nwere made aware of that when you were very young. I\u2019d like to compare it today, for\ninstance in United States where you have, if you were a black, you would know from\nwhen you were very young, that you are different than the white community, and\nyour parents would tell you about the discrimination, the things they went through.\nThis is the way we were. We knew this when we were young, and so when we saw\nthe signs on the wall, it was just an affirmation of exactly what we already knew or\nwhat our parents had already told us. They certainly didn\u2019t hide it.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Alfred Schnog, conducted by Gail Schwartz. This is tape\nnumber one, side B, and you were talking about a child\u2019s perception and how you\nknew you were different.",
        "A: We-y-yes. We certainly were different and we knew also, during those Hitler\nyears that times were changing. We knew that laws or regulations had been enacted,\nor had been promulgated, and \u2014\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "Q: How did you know, as a child?",
        "A: My parents told us. They were very open. We had a household that was \u2014 they\nkept nothing from us. They assured us of our security and we relied on them for that,\nand believed that, but they also told us what was happening. They told us of many of\nthe people who had been persecuted who were Jews, who \u2014 and there was a lot of\npersecution, there were people who lost their jobs because they couldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t\nwork any longer. Jews were not allowed to have Gentile maids in their homes. All\nthese things happened and we were \u2014 we either saw it and we were \u2014 or they were \u2014\nwe were told about those things. And I remember as a youngster my father kept a\nrevolver. And of course this was very exciting for two young boys, we always\nwanted to see the revolver, and my father showed it to us but he never let us touch it,\nwhich was terrible, we wanted to get our hands on it. But one day we took our car\nand we were visiting our grandparents across the Rhine and my father took that\nrevolver with him and he stopped in the middle of the bridge on the Rhine river. And\nhe took it apart and he started throwing pieces of the gun into the Rhine, one after\nanother. And of course we were curious, why? And we learned that we were \u2014 Jews\nwere not allowed to have weapons and if we did have weapons there would be dire\nconsequences and he was getting rid of it, and that\u2019s it. He was just \u2014 he was not\ngoing to let the Germans have it, for sure, so into the Rhine river 1t went. And maybe\nthat was one less gun that was used 1n the war, who knows. So we \u2014 we knew, and\nMarch 10, 2001\nwe grew up with that, and we went \u2014 and when we went to school we \u2014 we knew we\nwere in a Jewish school, we knew we had friends, obviously, in the Jewish school. In\n1937 - 1938, things got really \u2014 they escalated, they \u2014 the Germans \u2014 the \u2014 the rules\nand the many laws they put forth against the Jews affected us more and more. My\nfather\u2019s company was taken over. It was a Jewish company to begin with,\nLisauer\u2019s(ph), and they \u2014 the Germans appointed a \u2014 a Aryan company to take it\nover. And the Jews could continue to work there to show them how to operate it. And\nmy father, that\u2019s where my father\u2019s employment was, so he continued to work there.\nBut obviously all opportunity for advancement etcetera was gone. And we knew that\ntoo. Then \u2014 it was at that \u2014 during that period of time that my parents said, you know,\nwe can\u2019t continue to live here. Perhaps even earlier. And they started to inquire about\nhow they could get out of Germany. It was very difficult. The quota for America was\ncompletely full, it was years to wait to get \u2014 to get to America, but fortunately my\nfather had connections through his business, in England and in Holland. Particularly\nin Holland he had good friends, we did a lot of business. And so he started making\narrangements to get permission to work and live in Holland, while he was still\nemployed in Germany. We started hearing about concentration camps about that time\nand we knew people who were either living in the neighborhood, or \u2014 or who had\ncome recently from Poland where they had sought refuge in Germany, that the\nGestapo came and picked them up and sent them back. And where were they going?\nMarch 10, 2001\nThey were going to concentration camps. Everybody knew there were concentration\ncamps. Certainly all the Jews knew. What happened there that time, we didn\u2019t know.\nThey were just taken away. And this was kind of a frightening scenario. My parents,\nwho \u2014 I \u2014I\u2014I guess most German Jews who had lived there fo-for many, many\nyears did not fear that they would be taken away one day. It was mostly \u2014 at that\ntime, mostly the immigrants that came into Germany from the east, from \u2014\nprincipally from Poland who were the subject of this. They didn\u2019t \u2014 the Germans just\npicked them up, put them on a train, sent them out. And one day I was in school and\nit really brought it home to me. We were in the middle of a class, and suddenly some\nmen walked into the classroom, and they started calling out names of our fellow\nstudents, and they said come with us, and took them out. And my brother and I, when\nwe got home that day, we asked our parents, this and this 1s what happened. What\nhappened? And they explained it to us. These were the sons of Polish parents who\nhad settled there and sent their kids to the Jewish school where we were and they had\nbeen called by the Gestapo and they had a few hours to get their things and their\nchildren together because they were being transported out. This was frightening for a\nchild, you know, to know that you could be in a class, that somebody could come in\nand order you out, and with your parents you\u2019re going somewhere else. You\u2019re going\nout to some \u2014 someplace, and of course we knew then that they were going to\nconcentration camps, or \u2014\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "Q: H-How did you know that there were concentration camps in the late 30\u2019s?",
        "A: My \u2014 my parents knew, I knew it from my parents. And they \u2014 they had heard of,\nor known, I think, friends and acquaintances who had gone, some of them had been\nreleased and \u2014 at one period or another and they told of the ones that had not been\nreleased that had been sent to various camps. So we knew there were concentration\ncamps. How? I only knew it from my parents.",
        "Q: Did you talk about what was happening with friends, o-other boys outside your\nfamily? Was this a \u2014a topic of conversation among very young children at the time,\nor \u2014",
        "A: No, it really wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t remember having school friends at my house, for\ninstance, or me being at another student\u2019s home. We had recess and we played in the\nschoolyard together and there we had ballgames and all kinds of things that kids do\nin the \u2014 during recess, but when we went home, we went home and we had our life\nwith our family only. We did not have school friends and schoolmates whom we\nplayed with, not at that age.",
        "Q: What about neighborhood children? You said you lived in a mixed neighborhood,\ndid you play with non-Jewish children?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t recall \u2014 I don\u2019t recall that. I \u2014 our time was taken up in going to\nschool, coming back, being with our parents, going with our parents to see our\ngrandparents, going on excursions during weekends, that kind of thing, and I don\u2019t\nMarch 10, 2001\nrecall having any other friends in \u2014 neighborhood friends that we played with or that\nwe saw.",
        "Q: As a six or seven year old, were you afraid of your non-Jewish neighbors?",
        "A: No, we were not afraid of them. We were not afraid of our neighbors. We had\nsome very nice neighbors, I know my parents spoke to the people who lived across\nthe hall and as a matter of fact \u2014 I know for a fact that one of the \u2014 that family lived\nacross the hall, the man was a member of the SA, but he was quite nice. He always\nmade it his business to \u2014 he \u2014 he ran a grocery store or a butcher shop, I\u2019m not sure\nwhich, and when he had something that he could bring, he brought it, gave it to us.\nSo they lived \u2014 these Germans lived two lives. They lived one life in which they paid\nhomage to the Nazi party and everything and the trappings that went with that and\nthey heard the stories about how evil Jews were, and yet they could live across the\nhall from a family of Jews and still find them as decent and honest individuals and\nwork with them. That\u2019s the strange part. And \u2014 that these people could have\npromulgated what they did to the Jews and be a part of that is a \u2014 something that will\nalways be a mystery. Oh, I have lots of theories on that. [inaudible]",
        "Q: We'll get to that.",
        "A: Right.\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "Q: What did Hitler mean to you as a six or a seven year old? Did you hear his \u2014 see\nhis pictures, hear his speeches, what \u2014 what impressions does that make then on a\nvery young child?",
        "A: Well, we saw Hitler in the way that our parents saw him and our grandparents saw\nhim and their friends, and he was the object of ridicule in the Jewish community. As\nthis \u2014 so we \u2014 we had zero respect for Adolf Hitler. He was a menace, I think, for all\nof us in the Jewish community and our parents and our friends. And I had no other\nthoughts, but you know, Adolf Hitler was not the \u2014 we \u2014 we knew that was somebody\nwe should not like, and as a six or seven year old, that was about tt.",
        "Q: Did you have any nightmares, things like that about him?",
        "A: No, none. None whatsoever. What scared us perhaps was the \u2014 th-the police,\ncause they were so unmoving and so \u2014 they had their \u2014 now, how can I describe them\nbest? Autocratic. There was no appealing to them, you know, you \u2014 you \u2014 and in\nGermany, if some -- if a police officer or \u2014 or a [indecipherable] told you something,\nyou did it. There was no appeal from it, it was a person to be feared. And Hitler was\njust the head of this whole establishment, created these people. Now, police were\nnever the kind of people that I could warm up to, and perhaps it comes from those\ndays in Germany. The authority figure \u2014 you know, if you feel that you\u2019re doing\neverything right and you\u2019re suddenly faced with a -- a policeman who\u2019s telling you,\nor giving you authority, you \u2014 th \u2014 there\u2019s always that apprehension, what 1s it that I\nMarch 10, 2001\ndid wrong? And if I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, why 1s he standing here, you know?\nWhy is he poking his nose into my business? And that was pretty much it, we stayed\naway from the police.",
        "Q: Did you see any examples of degradation on the streets, and when you were\noutside of \u2014 degradation of Jews on the streets, you personally see anything?",
        "A: No, I did not. I don\u2019t recall seeing anything like that, except for when \u2014 well, now,\neven when they took the children out of school, they didn\u2019t forcibly tear them apart\nor what have you. I -- my first contact with that sort of thing where there was an\nassault on property or individuals was the night that we left Germany.",
        "Q: Were your parents Zionists in any way? Had they thought about going to\nPalestine?",
        "A: My mother was an very arch Zionist, she wanted very much to go pa \u2014 to\nPalestine. My father was not so much a Zionist. I think there was a period of time\nwhen they would have \u2014 they were looking to get out of Germany because they knew\nthat this was not a place for Jews to be living. But their ties to Germany were so\nstrong and so deep and so ancient that they could not \u2014 I don\u2019t think any \u2014 any of\nthem could believe that th \u2014 it would lead to a matter of life and death. And as long as\nthey could earn a living, this might blow over. After all, knowledge of assaults on\nJews and pogroms had been common knowledge throughout history and this was just\nanother period that they were going through. But as things got worse and worse, they\nMarch 10, 2001\nrecognized they ought to get out. And then the search started, how do \u2014 how do we\nget out. And I know my parents tried to get out to any number of places, South\nAmerica, America, even to Africa. I think they tried to go to Rhodesia once, but that\ndidn't work either.",
        "Q: Was this something they kept informing you of, or did you hear about this later?",
        "A: We knew they were \u2014 sorry. We knew that they were searching. And my interest\nin geography I think may have arisen from that search. I don\u2019t remember specifically\nhow but I do know that they were not happy. We spent time in Holland and of course\nthat\u2019s where we escaped to, really, was to Holland.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And that\u2019s a different story. But that\u2019s generally what my life was like as a\nyoungster.",
        "Q: When you would see a swastika on a flag or a banner, did it evoke any feelings on\nyour part?",
        "A: Well, it was a sign of the authority, the German authority, and did it evoke any\nfeelings at that time? I don\u2019t think so, not at that time. That came a little later, when\npeople started wearing the armband. Then you would sense that they were part of the\ncrowd that really hated Jews and made you feel uncomfortable, didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t\nwant anything to do with you, they didn't want you to be part of their lives and so it\nwas a sign that these were \u2014 these were anti-Semites. I guess in our own way we\nMarch 10, 2001\nknew that the minute we saw that armband it was \u2014 they were part of that authority in\nGermany that we feared. Some time in 1937 \u2014 1938 it became absolutely clear to my\nfather that they had to get out. And my parents, because of his contacts in Holland,\nmade arrangements to seek permission to work in Holland. And since his company\nhad an office in Amsterdam and he had friends, his business acquaintances were very\nclose friends in Amsterdam, that was a logical place to go. So they \u2014 my father had a\n\u2014a-\u2014he\u2019s told me these stories. His company was involved in international trading,\nand as such, they had special permission from the Reichsbank to travel and to make\ndeals in \u2014 abroad. And my father, being a young man at the \u2014 at that time was the one\nwho was assigned that task, to go to Holland and to England, etcetera. And he used\nthis permission, which was in letter form, to travel rather freely. And he would use\nthat for \u2014 to gain permission to enter the -- England or Holland, etcetera. So while he\nwas over there working, he made arrangements to obtain the permission to work in\nHolland, which he did. And when he came back they \u2014 and made the final decision\nthat their \u2014 they were leaving, they said well, we have to go to Holland. We have to\nfind a place to live. We have to see what\u2019s going on, let\u2019s take a month or so. We\u2019re\ngoing to go and we\u2019re going to make these arrangements, then we\u2019ll come back and\nwrap up everything we have and bring it to Holland. So in the summer of ni \u2014 of\n1938, we went by car and my father had his papers with him, so we got \u2014 arrived at\nthe Dutch border and we were stopped. Now, do you have anything to declare, this ca\nMarch 10, 2001\n\u2014 you know, at the German side. And the Dutch side was \u2014 they were standing, they\nwere wide open, no problem over there, but \u2014 and my father said no, we don\u2019t have\nanything to declare and they said, how about the boys? Why are you leaving? And\nmy father said to them, well, you know, they -- we have polio in \u2014 in Cologne. And\nit\u2019s the summer, we want our children to be safe from that, we \u2014 oh, so you have\npolio in Cologne? Well, that means your children were going to have to get a health\ncertificate, because we can\u2019t let you go across the border. Obviously we can\u2019t allow\npolio to spread. Course they knew we were Jewish \u2014 Jews, the passports had all been\nstamped with a J, so they knew. And my father said well, how do I get these\npermissions to get across to Holland, th-the health certificate? They said oh, you\ncan\u2019t get them, you might just as well go back. And he said no, how can we \u2014 then he\ninsisted. He said, well you have to see the [indecipherable] I guess, the county\nexecutive or whatever in that area and he can do it. Well, where can I find him? And\nhe said well, he\u2019s in such and such a town, whatever. And my father took off to get\nthat. In the meantime we stayed there at the border with my mother and they tore our\ncar apart. Literally went through everything to see whether we had anything at all.\nAnd as my mother tells 1t, we had \u2014 we had gotten some gifts from some friends or\nrelatives in Switzerland, the coats and hats and my Aunt Selma had put some\nperfume in the hatband, and they found that, of course, and confiscated it, which\nmade Norbert and I very upset that they would take that away from us. And my\nMarch 10, 2001\nmother said, don\u2019t you worry about it, whatever it is, we can replace it. Let them have\nit. And we waited for my father to come back. Well, as the story goes, my father told\nme, he said he went to see him and he was occupied somewhere and insisted he go in\nand see this county executive, and he walked into his office, and he gave him a quick\nheil Hitler. And he said, why can\u2019t I go across the border, I have my children, they\nhave \u2014 we have polio in \u2014 in Cologne and they insist on having the certificate. And so\nthe fellow said well, you know, if you don\u2019t mind, you know, they \u2014 they have polio\nhere in Holland. If you don\u2019t object to your children being exposed to that, then why\nshould we, and he signed it, gave it to him. So he came back to the border and there\nwe were, everything had been stripped and taken and it was quite late by then. And\nthe \u2014 the Germans were furious, of course, that he had come up with the certificate,\nthey didn\u2019t want him to \u2014 didn\u2019t want to give him that opportunity that \u2014 to leave.\nAnd even though it was very late, the \u2014 and the Dutch border supposedly had closed.\nSo they thought that maybe this was all over, we couldn\u2019t get in any more. And the\nGerman said, okay, you can go, with a smirk on their faces, I guess, knowing that the\nother side was closed. Well, lo and behold, they started drive across and the Dutch\nopened the border and they said, what was going on there? And they said, you know,\nwe seen a lot of this with Jews. We kept the border open for you. So the Dutch were\nextremely decent and wonderful people and we went over and for the next month or\nMarch 10, 2001\nsix weeks we stayed in a \u2014 kind of a resort town on the beach, and \u2014 in Holland.\nSunfort was the name of the reso \u2014 the \u2014 the beach town.",
        "Q: While you were waiting for your father, do you remember that, and what did you",
        "A: Oh, yeah \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 and your brother do? Was it a fearful time? Did you think your father was\nmaybe not going to come back?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember my feelings. I think we trusted our parents explicit \u2014 implicitly\nand had no concern that he wouldn\u2019t come back. We just waited. I had \u2014 honestly I\ndon\u2019t remember. You know, those are things that they leave. I remember \u2014 I\nremember the \u2014 the searching and I remember the fact that they took these silly little\nbottles of perfume, and just waited, and then off we went. And we \u2014 when we were in\nHolland, my pa \u2014 we were at this resort and my parents put Norbert and I into a \u2014 I\nguess best described as a summer camp, my \u2014 which we enjoyed because it was\nbeach, it was the ocean right there and \u2014",
        "Q: Did you know Dutch?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t speak any Dutch. And my parents said \u2014 made certain arrangements,\nthey got whatever necessary arrangements they needed to make in order to \u2014 to make\ntheir final move, and asked our friends to find an apartment for them. And they were\ngoing to go back to Germany and pick up their things and head off. And they said,\nMarch 10, 2001\nyou know boys, I think you should stay here. Because at that time things were really\ngetting bad, it was difficult to get money out of Germany, couldn\u2019t be done any\nlonger. And they didn\u2019t want to put us in harm\u2019s way. But my brother and I became\nabsolutely hysterical. We didn\u2019t want to be separated from our parents, and we raised\nquite a ruckus. So much so that our parents said well, we\u2019ll take you back, we will\nsomehow manage. Something happens to us we\u2019ll all go through it. And we actually\nwent back to Germany.",
        "Q: You boys were seven and a half at the poin \u2014 at this point.",
        "A: That was, that time seven and a half years old, exactly. So back we went to\nCologne and my parents at that time wrapped up what they could. They sent their\nbookcases and some f-furniture, books mostly because they loved books, they loved\nreading, so this was very important for them that they bring their bookcases with\nthem, and sent them off with the moving van. And my father got tickets for \u2014 no, he\ndidn\u2019t get tickets there, they ... he made whatever final arrangements had to be made\nt-to \u2014 to get out. And when the furniture was moved, happened to be on November\neighth, and out we went, the apartment was empty. So we went over to see \u2014 to \u2014 to\nlive in hotel for one \u2014 for one night because the next day we were taking the train,\nand we were [indecipherable] we were going to Holland. So we went over to the\nDome Hotel, which was right across the street from the cathedral in \u2014 in Cologne.\nAnd the Dome Hotel is situated on one of the main shopping streets in the city of\n29March 10, 2001\nCologne, narrow shopping street. And we went to sleep that night, my brother and I. I\nremember that my parents were there in \u2014 in our room as well and at four o\u2019clock in\nthe morning my brother and I were awakened by my parents.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nMarch 10, 2001\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Alfred Schnog. This is tape number two, side A, and you\nwere talking about how you were in the hotel.",
        "A: Right. Well, we were in the Dome Hotel, my brother and I went to sleep. And\nsometime in the middle of the night we were awakened by my mother. And she said\nboys, come here. And we got up and she took us to the window of the hotel and stood\nus between the drapes so that we could look out on the s \u2014 onto the street. And down\nbelow was this noise of shattering glass and \u2014 and we looked down and we saw these\nuniformed individuals, the brown shirts, throwing rocks into the window of the store\nthat was just across the street from the hotel. And there were others inside the store\nthrowing porcelain and glass out on the street, just piling it up, just heaving it out.\nAnd I remember the \u2014 1n the glow of the streetlights, in the yellowish glow of the\nstreetlights and the cobblestone streets and all this stuff just shattering as it hit the\nfloor. And my mother said to me \u2014 sa-said to us, boys, she said, take a look. Never\nforget what you see here. And of course we wanted to know what was happening and\nwe asked what\u2019s happening, and she said, that\u2019s a Jewish store. One of the finest\nstores in crystal and everything and they\u2019re just destroying it. Well, we didn\u2019t know \u2014\nwhat we didn\u2019t know was that not just there, but everywhere, this was going on in\nGermany and this was the night that the synagogues were all burned and the \u2014 what\nMarch 10, 2001\nwe didn\u2019t see, the \u2014 the Jews being rounded up and being ostracized and as they were\ndragged down the streets and all these things. These were things that we learned only\nafterwards. But we did see the carnage that was taking place across the street from\nthis hotel and down this \u2014 this whole street. And in \u2014 it\u2019s something that I don\u2019t think\nI can ever forget, the image of it is so vivid in my mind, the whole thing, it\u2019s \u2014 1t was\nthe first time in all those years that we actually saw violence. We had seen and we\nhad feared all the other things, but this was true violence. And it \u2014 and you know,\nI\u2019ve read a lot about these things since then. The Germans claimed afterwards that it\nwas an uprising on the part of the German people against the Jews. Just remembering\nall those people in uniform, it was no uprising of the people in, I mean it was the \u2014 it\nwas the \u2014 the Hitler youth, the \u2014 the SA, the brown shirts and whoever else wanted to\nparticipate in this, did this. Anyway, in the morning my parents took us to vi \u2014 say\ngoodbye to our grandparents, who were just across the river in Cologne. And the\ngrandparents said, my God are you still here? Get out, get out. And then we learned\nof the carnage that had been happening the rest of the city, and obviously what was\nhappening all over Germany at the time. The synagogue had been burned, the people\nhad been dragged out of their homes and they made fun of them as they \u2014 down the\nstreets and what have you. Elderly people, and \u2014 and they sent us off. They shooed us\nout, but quickly, and said get out. And so my parents went directly to the train station\nfrom there and we got on the train to go to Holland. There were a lot of other Jews on\nMarch 10, 2001\nthe train. Many of them had come from the east, finding their way through. And\nsome of them had, as we found out a few days later, some of them who were actually\non their way to emigrate to the United States were also on the train. And the train\ntook off. What we didn\u2019t know, which we learned shortly thereafter is that the\nGermans has sealed the borders everywhere. And we arrived at the Dutch border.\nPolice boarded the train. All Jews, out of the train. And we were all taken out of the\ntrain, all our baggage off the train, put on a cart, a horse drawn cart without a horse,\nand we were marched to a jail. Best thing I could describe it as, and locked up in a \u2014\nin a room. I remember the room vividly, there we-were quite a number of people in\nthat cell. And I remember the green door and the bars on the door and the window\nand the toilet in the open, which was to be used by everybody there and of course as\nchildren having to use the toilet in front of all these people was something we didn\u2019t\nlike, and I remember the-they shielded us when we had to do so. And we were there\nfor a period of time, I\u2019m not sure how long. My father had some papers with him and\nin \u2014 it\u2014 and he was concerned that the Germans might see those papers and\nmisinterpret them or find them, and he ate them. And for my brother and I, this was a\nmarvel to see. I think maybe made a big impression on us more-so than even going to\njail 1s that my father would eat paper. And these are \u2014 it\u2019s funny, the things that you\nrec-recollect. And sometime within that day or the next day \u2014 it seemed to me it was\nMarch 10, 2001\njust one night that we spent there, but my parents have often said it was almost a\nweek, and I don\u2019t recall that. I think it was just \u2014 I think it was just that \u2014 that night.",
        "Q: Were \u2014 were there other children, or were you boys the only ones?",
        "A: I believe we were the only boys. There were a lot \u2014 there were other people in that\ncell, in that room. Some of them were single men and single women, you know, these\nwere groups. Husband and wife maybe, perhaps families as well. And at one point I\nguess we ha \u2014 my father had an opportunity to speak to the commandant there of \u2014\nwhoever he was. And he explained to him that he was traveling here on business. He\nhad this document from \u2014 still \u2014 the Reichsbank, and that he had \u2014 was going to\nHolland to bid on some very important materials which were needed for the \u2014 the war\neffort in Germany or for the military, and they couldn\u2019t keep us incarcerated because\nhe had to get on with this business. And the man apparently told them well, you\nknow, I have to see \u2014 I \u2014 first thing I have to do 1s feed 3,000 Jews. He said, we'll\ntake care of you after that\u2019s done. But apparently, coincidentally, the \u2014 there was a\nship sailing from Holland for the United States which had booked passage for about a\nthousand Jews who had permission to come to the United States. The Aidam(ph) was\nthe name of the vessel. And apparently this was made known to the German\nauthorities there and they didn\u2019t want to create a situation \u2014 at least we think they\ndidn't want to create a situation where there would become known that they\nprevented Jews from leaving. It would have been politically unwise, maybe created\nMarch 10, 2001\ntoo much of a public relations problem for them. So they decided to let those Jews\nwho had that passage booked, and pay for us to go to Holland to catch that ship, it\nwas sailing from Holland, to go. And my father said, well look, I have my papers for\nHolland. Didn\u2019t have any passage on that ship or anything like that. And somehow he\nmanaged to get us in with this group to go to Holland. And it was just, I think, good\nfortune. There was a point just before we went into this jail where we \u2014 where my\nmother and father were told by the \u2014 whoever was leading us to this ersatz\nconcentration camp that they had put up, or that \u2014 this jail where they were going,\nwhere they were apparently separating or segregating people, where they were going\nto put them and what have you, assign them to some rooms. And they said to my\nparents, they said look, you will go to a concentration camp where you will be safe.\nYour children will go to an orphanage. And of course the minute Norbert and I heard\nthis \u2014 and I recall that too \u2014 we started to raise the roof because we were not going to\nbe separated from our parents. This was \u2014 we were just, I guess frightened. And I\nmean, really scared that we might be separated from them. And my mother said,\nchildren calm down. Nobody is going to separate us from anybody. Before that\nhappens, I will take your lives and mine right here. And she made it known, she was\nvery distinct about it, and she always carried a \u2014 through her lifetime she always\ncarried a paring knife, which she used to peel apples, cause she loved apples. And she\nwas fully prepared to take that knife and cut our throats and her own throat so that\nMarch 10, 2001\nthat wouldn't happen. And it wasn't so strange, because there were people who\nattempted suicide in that jail because they had lost everything, they knew they were\ngoing to be sent to a concentration camp, back where they came from. And there\nwere any number of suicide attempts, some of them perhaps successful, I don\u2019t know.\nAnyway, that was \u2014 in that moment, I don\u2019t know what made the Germans say forget\nabout it, or go on with your \u2014 the way I heard it my mother said, go on, take your\nbrats and get out of here. I\u2019m not sure that that was the case, cause I don\u2019t remember\nthat, but 1t could very well have been. And we went \u2014 we were then on the train with\nall these other people, or we went to the border with all these other people to cross to\ngo into Holland.",
        "Q: Do you know where the jail was located?",
        "A: No. Oh, wait a minute ... I don\u2019t have a recollection of it.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It was on the Dutch border, obviously, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know where. But we got to the\nborder, my father telephoned across and got ahold of his friend and said look, we\u2019re\nhere, get over here fast. We\u2019ve got to get out of here. And they \u2014 they came, they\npicked us up and took us to a \u2014 an inn, I guess, in Holland, where for \u2014 I remember\nmy parents telling me the Dutch couldn\u2019t have been nicer. They saw us, they knew\nwhat had happened, they\u2019d asked all kinds of questions about us. They laid out \u2014 they\nhad a table of food, that was the food \u2014 the kinds of things they \u2014 my parents hadn\u2019t\nMarch 10, 2001\nseen in \u2014 in years in Germany. And their eyes opened and \u2014 and they had even put us\nin a hotel, they had drawn the water in the tub, hot water so they could take a bath\nbecause they apparently had been \u2014 it was a few days before we got out of that jail to\nget across, and it was just a tremendous relief to be out of Germany, and to f\u2014 and be\nin Holland and feel reasonably safe that this was not going to \u2014 that we were going to\nsurvive this \u2014 this thing.",
        "Q: Had you brought anything special with you as a youngster, special possession?\nToys or books, or anything special?",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall that we did. We had some toys and my parents, I\u2019m sure put them\nonboard the moving van when it left Germany and I\u2019m sure that it arrived in Holland\nand that we played with them, but it \u2014 I didn\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t remember carrying anything\nwith us of that nature. What I do remember is the \u2014 sitting in the hotel with \u2014 being\nfed this wonderful food. I\u2019d never eaten fish or I didn't like fish and my parents were\noffering me Dover sole, my God, I\u2019d \u2014 I\u2019d kill to have that t-today, I still do, I love it,\nyou know. But in those days, as a kid, you didn\u2019t want to eat that stuff. And you\nknow, as \u2014 wonderful stories. My parents wanted us to learn Dutch as quickly as\npossible. And they had, in the period of time between when we came back from\nHolland the first time in Germany, and then left finally to leave, they had taken\nDutch lessons from a teacher, local teacher who came over and taught them some\nDutch. And we were sitting on a couch, and behind me on the couch, on the wall was\nMarch 10, 2001\na \u2014 a String with a \u2014 that you could pull and it would ring, it would send off a bell for\nroom service, or for somebody to come. And we had finished eating a meal and my\nparents wanted the hotel to know that so they could come and clear the dishes, and in\n\u2014I guess it\u2019s in Dutch, the name for a bell 1s like English, a bell. And in German bell\n\u2014 belling is to bark, like a dog. So they turned to us, turned to me and they said\nbellmal(ph), or you know, ring the bell. And I looked at them kind of strange, I said,\nwhat do you want me to do? They said it again and I said bow wow. Which was the\nonly thing I understood. Well, it was the hilarity of that moment and the relief of\nbeing \u2014 of having gone through what they had just experienced and gone through,\nthat created a moment of just pure joy. And we laughed so heartily, all of us, and I \u2014\ncourse I di \u2014 first I didn\u2019t know what they were laughing about, but then, you know,\nthe explanation of it all was even \u2014 was quite a good deal of fun for me and \u2014 and \u2014\nand that\u2019s how \u2014 that\u2019s how we got into Holland. And \u2014 and shortly thereafter we\nmoved into an apartment which our friends had gotten for us in Amsterdam in a very,\nvery lovely area. And \u2014 and we, my brother and I went to school there, a Jewish\nschool in Amsterdam. Very, very strict Orthodox Jewish school. We \u2014 I remember\nmy parents \u2014 my mother sent us off to school on the first day with sandwiches, and\nthey had meat on the sandwiches. And so we got there and it was time to go out\nlunch to eat and they discovered that we had meat on the sandwiches and my brother\nand I were made to go outside and eat them there because they were kosher and God\nMarch 10, 2001\nforbid somebody would contaminate their kosher atmosphere with our meat\nsandwiches.",
        "Q: Now, we\u2019re talking December \u00b038?",
        "A: This was in \u2014 probably November, or di\u2014 maybe December, yeah, by that time\nwe were settled, it was December, or j \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And so when I came home I told my parents never to send me to school again\nwith a sandwich that had \u2014 I think it was pot roast, which I loved, on it, you know, 1-\nit had to be vegetarian or \u2014 or some milk substance, cheese or whatever. And \u2014",
        "Q: Were there many immigrant children, you know, non-Dutch Jews \u2014 Jewish\nchildren in your school?",
        "A: Not that I know of, no. There were \u2014 th-the children I came in contact with were\nall Dutch and we learned very, very rapidly the language from them. My brother and\nI spoke Dutch fluently within a matter of weeks. An-And Dutch 1s not such a difficult\nlanguage for somebody who speaks German. So we learned it very rapidly and I\nremember having some of the struggles when you used to sometimes mix my\nGerman words with Dutch, but that was all gone very, very rapidly. And we loved\nHolland, because it \u2014 we lived in a \u2014 we lived on the Zuideramstellaan, which today\nis known as Rooseveltlaan. They changed the name. A big, wide boulevard, divided\ninto four lanes, I guess, three or four lanes. And there was a streetcar in the front and\nMarch 10, 2001\nit was wonderful for my brother and I cause we could walk around the corner and\nrent bicycles. And, you know, for a child the first time to have a bicycle is a lot of fun\nand these were dreadful bikes when you think about it in terms of what a modern\nbicycle looks like, but they were, nevertheless, a lot of fun. And then it was\nwintertime and the canals were frozen and you could go and skate and we went to see\nthat and I remember that so vividly, people skating as far as they wanted to. And not\nanywhere did we as \u2014 s-see a sign Jews were not wanted. No place in Holland. Didn't\nexist. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: What did that do for you?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: What did that do for you?",
        "A: Well, it was just \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether I was \u2014 that I even thought about it. I\nthink it was I just took it for granted, that this was Holland, that it was \u2014 we were \u2014 it\nwas different. There were \u2014 there were no military marches, no \u2014 no police that \u2014 or\nHitler youth that would march around and wave their flags. It was just \u2014 didn\u2019t exist.",
        "Q: Did the Dutch Jewish children accept you?",
        "A: Yes, they certainly did. We had no trouble getting along with the Dutch Jewish\nchildren. My parents were able still, in 1938 - 1939, shortly after they arrived in\nHolland, to get my parents \u2014 my grandparents out of Germany. Now, we know that\nthey must have left without anything, because \u2014 at least my grandparents must have\nMarch 10, 2001\nleft Germany with nothing in their pockets, to speak. We know that \u2014 well, the\nGermans made the Jews pay for all the damage they \u2014 they caused on Kristallnacht,\nthat\u2019s history. And they weren\u2019t allowed to own property, they weren\u2019t \u2014 things\nbecame so oppressive for Jews that my grandfather, I\u2019m sure, sold his house for a\npittance at that time because there was nothing else he could do with it. Whether he\ncould every take the money with him to get it out, I don\u2019t know, I have no idea. But\nthey managed to get them to Holland, and they had an apartment in Amsterdam, not\ntoo far from where we lived. My brother and I used to bicycle down to their place. As\na matter of fact, a-about 10 years ago it 1s now that I was in Amsterdam, I went to see\nwhere we lived, which I r-re-remembered. I\u2019ve been there recently too, and I actually\ntook some pictures of that. And I could find my way still, to my grandparents home,\nit\u2019s so well ingrained in my mind. My parents, the moment they arrived in Holland\nsaid well, we\u2019ve got to start thinking about a little \u2014 getting even further away from\nGermany and finding a \u2014 another place to go because if it can happen there, it can \u2014\nmight happen here. We just don\u2019t feel secure. It was not just that, it was also, I think\nfor economic reasons. You can imagine all the Jews that wound up in Holland, all\nseeking employment. And the competition for my father must have been extremely\nsevere. He was the young man who arrived, he got the dirty jobs. He had to do all the\ntraveling, which in many ways was f \u2014 was good, it helped, because he could \u2014 he\nwent to \u2014 to England quite a great deal. Matter of fact, he even \u2014 he even walked into\nMarch 10, 2001\nthe foreign office in England, offered his services because he was so much aware of\nwhere German industry was and what they needed and what they had to buy, because\nthat was his business, this is what he did. And he ma \u2014 was able later to make use of\nthose connections, when we finally left Holland to come to the United States, he was\n\u2014 that \u2014 that helped him a great deal. But they had \u2014 my parents, during the time that\nthey were in Germany had applied for visas to come to America as did practically\nevery Jew in Germany. And the likelihood of that happening was extremely,\nextremely slim. It was a lottery system and \u2014 and when he \u2014 and when they wound up\nin Holland, my father said you know, I\u2019m going to contact the American embassy in\nStuttgart and we will have our files transferred to Rotterdam. After all, we\u2019re now in\nHolland, doesn\u2019t do us any good to have that file in Stuttgart, why not? So he wrote\nthem a letter and he got the file transferred over there. And I suppose that lot of\nthings came that worked together at that time. There were a lot of people who just\ncouldn\u2019t, even when their number came up for a visa, couldn\u2019t accept it any more\ncause they\u2019d already been transported somewhere else, to the concentration camps, or\nwhat have you. And the quota suddenly opened up enough so that one day \u2014 we were\nin Holland I think for almost a year and a half, two years, close to that. Suddenly he\ngot a call from Rotterdam, Mr. Schnog, bring your family here for a medical exam. If\nyou pass the medical exam you will be able to come to the United States, you\u2019ll get\nyour visa. So they had to make a decision as to whether to stay \u2014 of course they had\nMarch 10, 2001\njobs and they were well settled in Holland, or whether to leave. And after everything\nthat happened in Germany, and I think also because of the severe competition for\njobs in Holland at the time, they decided th-there\u2019s no question about this, let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s\nget out, let\u2019s get as far away from this menace in Germany as we possibly can. And\nthey went to the embassy, we had our physicals, and in two weeks they had a visa to\ncome to the United States. All that excitement, you can well imagine. They started\npacking up their things and making plans. And because they couldn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nwhether they could bring their money out of Holland or whether they had a problem\nwith that, but they decided to book passage first class because they couldn\u2019t do\nanything else with the money, on Cunard. Cunard White Star line from London, or\nLiverpool they sail \u2014 sail from, to the United States. And packed up our things, sent\nthem ahead and suddenly we were leaving Holland. Left f \u2014 said goodbye to my\ngrandparents and we went to the airport, Schiphol, I think it was, pretty sure, and we\nboarded \u2014 and this was during the \u2014 this was already during the war, during the\nPhoney War between England and Germany, because in 1940 England was drawn\ninto the war because the Germans had invaded Poland. There was a \u2014 an agreement\nthat they would \u2014 that England would declare war, and they did.",
        "Q: I-I was going to ask you about that, in September 1\u2018, 1939, did your parents talk\nthat over, were you aware of that?\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: Oh, we \u2014 we were fully aware of world events and what was happening.\nCompletely. My parents were interested in it, I was interested in it and \u2014 and this\nwas, for us, listening to current events was what it was like for American kids our age\nfollowing the baseball season. It was important in our lives. Obviously it had\nenormous amount of \u2014 of importance in our family. So we \u2014 w-we wanted to know.\nWe wa \u2014 and war, 1t \u2014 you know, it was war and we a \u2014 we had gone through the \u2014\nthe Russians, I think, invading Finland, and this was in the news everywhere and as\nchildren you \u2014 you followed this. In fact, we weren\u2019t the only ones, I think all the\nkids in those days, followed that.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Alfred Schnog. This is tape number two, side B, and you\nwere saying as children you were following along what was happening in the\ndifferent countries and in the war. Did it \u2014 did that make you more fearful \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: \u2014 knowing what was happening in other countries?",
        "A: No, it did not. We felt very secure, very safe. We had no concerns. Indeed, my\nparents had no concerns being in Holland, Holland was a neutral and nobody\nexpected that they would be involved or become involved in a war. They hadn\u2019t been\nMarch 10, 2001\nin the first World War and they were \u2014 certainly weren\u2019t going to get involved in this\none. It was a very liberal country and we felt very, very safe there. But I do think that\nthe economic opportunity wasn\u2019t there and this 1s what really proved to be the most\nimportant reason why my parents decided that they should leave and \u2014 and come\nsomewhere else, or go somewhere else.",
        "Q: Now, what about your grandparents? Was there any thought of bringing your\ngrandparents to the United States?",
        "A: Oh yes, of course. We \u2014 we felt we would go ahead, we would get settled and we\nwould then bring them to the United States, they would follow right on along. \\",
        "Q: What did the United States mean to you at that point? What did it represent to\nyou?",
        "A: The United States was America, it was a \u2014 a dream, really. It was something that\nwe had read about. Everything good was in America. This 1s w \u2014 the \u2014 the fame of\nAmerica, of New York, of the skyscrapers, of everything was \u2014 was known to us. It\nwas known to everyone in Europe. We \u2014 an-and it was everybody\u2019s dream to go to\nAmerica at one time or another, to live there or to at least visit. So this was wonderful\nfor us to \u2014 we\u2019re going to go to America. Was just marvelous to \u2014 to contemplate\nthat. So as a child it was great.",
        "Q: You had seen what, pictures in magazines or newspapers or movies?\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: We had seen pictures in magazines. This was mostly what my parents had\nexplained and told us about. It was our imagination working, perhaps overtime. I\nreally don\u2019t think so, I think our imagination had it right. One of the things that was\nso interesting in Holland, so many things happened, as a child this would be\ninteresting, apparently we had a friend, I don\u2019t know whether he was an immigrant\nfrom Germany or what, and we were very much into cars, my brother and I. My\nfather at one time in Germany had owned a \u2014 a lot, a car lot where people would\nbring their old cars and he would disassemble them for the metals, the copper and the\n\u2014all the precious metals that were inside and sell the rest of it off as scrap. And my\nbrother and I often went there and played in the old cars, you know. We\u2019d climb into\nthe cabs and turn the wheels. It was a lot of fun, very enjoyable. So cars were a\npassion for us, we could recognize every automobile on the streets, what it looked\nlike, whether it was an Opal or whether it was a \u2014 a Ford or a Volkswagen or\nwhatever, we knew it all. And in Holland this man came over and he \u2014 was a brand\nnew car, I think it must have been a Nash or something like that, as I recall and it was\na very modern styling for that time and my brother and I were so impressed. Well it\nturned out this fellow had stolen the car and it wasn\u2019t long before they caught him\nand I guess put him in jail, I hope in Holland, not in Germany, but they \u2014 they did. So\nthere were all these adventures. I remember my mother taking us to the tulip fields,\nand seeing that. We \u2014 we spent a week or two weeks of vacation sailing in the\nMarch 10, 2001\nZuiderzee, which at that time was open to the North Sea, which has since been\ndammed in. And we were there with some of my parents\u2019 friends and colleagues,\nacquaintances and we sailed from one town to the \u2014 all around this \u2014 this huge sea.\nAnd it was just marvelous and \u2014 you know, and then one of these old Dutch ships\nwith the \u2014 what do you call them, the sideboards that would go down. They didn\u2019t\nhave a keel, so they had sideboards and we would sail all around. My father was a\nwonderful photographer and he took some beautiful, beautiful pictures of that, some\nof which I may still have, I\u2019m not sure. They\u2019re very wonderful.",
        "Q: Di-Did your family, your folks keep up their religious observance? Were you\nobserving Jewish holidays when you were in Holland?",
        "A: Yes, we were observing Jewish holidays. What became really less and less, the\nneed to maintain a kosher home perhaps was still there in Holland because my\ngrandparents were there, but after that, when we left Holland, that, you know, almost\ndisappeared completely. Anyway, going back, we \u2014 when their number \u2014 the \u2014 when\nthey won the lottery to come to the United States, and it was truly winning the\nlottery, we wound up at the airport there and we climbed aboard a DC-3 type aircraft,\nwhich was all painted orange and the windows were frosted. And the reason for that\nwas this, Holland had declared itself a neutral and their airplanes, their commercial\nplanes, they blocked \u2014 they frosted the windows so that they couldn\u2019t be accused of\nhaving spies on board the airplane looking down at the German fortifications and\nMarch 10, 2001\nthen reporting that out. And we got on this airplane on which my brother and I\nimmediately got sick because it bumped all the way across the English channel and\nwe wound up in England.",
        "Q: Now, what mon \u2014 wha-what month are we talking about?",
        "A: We\u2019re talking about January 1939 \u2014 1940. It was either very late December or\nvery early \u2014 you know, I think it was January. January 1940. Yeah, exactly. And we\narrived and went to stay at the White Hall Hotel on Speaker\u2019s Corner at Hyde Park. I\nremember it very, very well.",
        "Q: Did you know any English at this point?",
        "A: Not a word. Not a word of English. I was fluent in Dutch, I could speak German,\nof course. And what impressed me about England were the barrage balloons. England\nbeing at war, although the air raids had not started, they were flying these barrage\nballoons over London. They were not more than, I would say 200 yards off the\nground, up in the air. So they \u2014 they looked like small blimps floating everywhere.\nAnd all the \u2014 at every intersection where the police had a traffic cop or something,\ntheir \u2014 their huts were all sandbagged in. And they were on a war footing. And this\nimpressed us, my brother and I. The blackout during the night. Cars driving around\nwithout \u2014 with shielded headlights. And \u2014 so I remember that \u2014 that wartime London.\nAnd I \u2014I remember my brother getting sick 1n the hotel, he had caught some \u2014 some\nsomething. What it was I don\u2019t know. But he was there, maybe it was influenza or\nMarch 10, 2001\nsomething like that, and we were stuck in the hotel. And my parents had to stay with\nhim. My father was out \u2014 would go to the \u2014 to his office there in London, he had\nfriends and etcetera. And they sent me out to purchase a bulb for a flashlight, because\nhe needed it at night, everything was blacked out. And they said okay, now you go\ndown Regent Street right here and down a few blocks and you walk into a store, it\u2019s\nabout a block down and you go ask for a light bulb. Of course, they told me this in\nDutch. And I said, well what\u2019s that in English? And they said, well we\u2019ll look it up\nfor you. And they looked it up and they said, well you ask for a bulb. I said bulb?\nAnd she \u2014 yeah. And off I went, I couldn\u2019t speak a word of English. And marched\ndown Regent Street, into the store and I asked for a bulb and managed to get it\nwithout any difficulty. I think it \u2014 that was a interesting and very formative\nexperience for me. It taught me a little bit of independence, that you could go\nanywhere, and you didn\u2019t have to be afraid, that you could make yourself understood,\nno matter what. And \u2014 and for a young \u2014 for a young man that was, I thought, kind of\nmaturing and I came back and we had it. Now, we had to stay, we had to get\npermission in London to stay a little longer because my brother was ill. And they had\nbooked the passage with Cunard line but they hadn\u2019t \u2014 the ship hadn\u2019t been\ndesignated at that time. So my father had to go to the police there to get an extension.\nAnd he called his friends at the foreign office at the time and said here, you know, I\nneed to get an extension, can you help me out? He was afraid that they wouldn\u2019t\nMarch 10, 2001\npermit it. And they said well, just go to the police, don\u2019t worry about it. Just go in\nthere and ask them. And he went there and they said of course, you know, you don\u2019t\nhave any problems here, you can stay as long as you like. This they didn't\nunderstand, or didn\u2019t \u2014 you know, they didn\u2019t expect it. I can\u2019t say they didn\u2019t\nunderstand it, they didn\u2019t expect it. They didn\u2019t expect that you could have so much\nfreedom in \u2014 in any country and there wouldn\u2019t be somebody who would say no, you\ncan\u2019t do this or you can\u2019t \u2014 you \u2014 you must have these papers, or you must go back.\nI\u2019m sorry, you can\u2019t stay, you have to go back to where you came from. Not there.\nAnd these were very comforting for them. My brother and I didn\u2019t \u2014 really weren\u2019t\nconcerned, cause we weren\u2019t aware that these \u2014 that this might be a problem or that\nthey were \u2014 tha-that my parents were concerned about it. But eventually \u2014 of course\nmy brother got better in about three or four weeks and in March, I guess it was, must\nhave been March, we finally told that the \u2014 we would have the passage on the Cunard\nWhite Star liner, the Britannic, and to go to Liverpool on such and such a day and we\nboard \u2014 they didn\u2019t tell us what the name of the ship was because they were afraid\nthat there would be too many \u2014 too much information around and it would get back to\nthe Germans and there was this submarine warfare going on. They didn't want\nanybody to know what ships were in port and when they would be sailing. So they\njust said, come to Liverpool and you\u2019ll be on one of the vessels, the ships.",
        "Q: Were there many German Jews that you were aware of?\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: Yes, there were. There were German Jews who were also setting sail for the\nUnited States at that time. We showed up at Liverpool and we w \u2014 boarded the\nBritannic, and my father had been told when he booked the passage that they would\nbe traveling in convoy across the Atlantic because of the submarine warfare. And we\nexpected that. So next day we set sail. My parents had bought these first class tickets\nand we were in first class. There were \u2014 and this is where it 1s, there were many Jews\nand people who were traveling in steerage, so to speak, and they couldn\u2019t even visit\nus. And we knew some of them, my parents knew some of them, but \u2014 but we as \u2014\nwe were ensconced in very, very luxurious quarters on the ship, and was \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014\nthere\u2019d be these easy chairs on the deck and they would serve bouillon and all kinds\nof goodies, and was wonderful for kids. And indeed, on th \u2014 on the voyage across I\nfell in love with English omelets, jelly omelets, they were wonderful. I la \u2014 had one\nevery day my mother says and I \u2014 I still remember them, they were great. But we got\n\u2014 we were told that we would have to have a lifeboat drill almost daily because of the\nfear of being s \u2014 being attacked by a submarine. And my parents made us sleep in our\nclothes with our shoes next to the bed, and if we heard the foghorn three times, we\nwere to get in \u2014 get those shoes on, don\u2019t tie the laces, just get them on, grab the life\npreservers and report to our lifeboat stations. Course, it never came to that,\nfortunately. But the first day out my father \u2014 we looked around and I was expecting\nto see this huge convoy of ships going across the ocean and I looked outside and\nMarch 10, 2001\nthere wasn\u2019t a ship in sight. And my father went to the captain and said, you know, I\nthought we were traveling convoy, where are all the other ships? And the captain\nsaid, oh that\u2019s nonsense, we are so fast we\u2019d outrace any convoy and we\u2019re going\nacross the ocean. And indeed they did. As a matter of fact they zigzagged all the way\nacross the ocean and I could stand on the tail of the ship and see the wake zigzagging\nacross, to throw off any potential torpedo, I guess, that was directed in our \u2014 1\u2014 to \u2014\ndirected in our direction, so \u2014 and that was the voyage. I remember it and I loved it,\nas any child would, on a big ship. And we arrived in New York and were greeted by\nfriends whom had \u2014 who had preceded us to the United States. Indeed, he was a\npartner of my father\u2019s in that auto wrecking yard at one time. And they took us to the\n\u2014 to the \u2014 to a hotel on Broadway, the Whitehall Hotel. Did I say Whitehall before? Is\nthat the hotel in Great Britain? It\u2019s not the right \u2014 that\u2019s not the right name. The one\nin Great Britain was \u2014",
        "Q: What -- what \u2014 what --",
        "A: No, it was the whiteh \u2014 Whitehall Hotel in New York.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It was on Hundredth Street and Broadway.",
        "Q: Wh-When did you \u2014 when did you land in the United States?",
        "A: On April 1, 1940 we landed in the United States, and \u2014\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "Q: What \u2014 what was your \u2014 were your folks still in communication with \u2014 to your\ngrandparents?",
        "A: Yes, yes they were.",
        "Q: By \u2014 and how?",
        "A: Well, they could communicate, there was certainly correspondence by letter and\nyou could even telephone still, or \u2014 Holland was a \u2014 still a neutral at that time and it\nwas certainly possible to communicate with them. And when we moved into the ho \u2014\nhotel on \u2014 on Broadway and Hundredth Street \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, ju-just a moment. When you were on the boat, any other children? Did you\nplay with other children?",
        "A: No. There were no other children that I remember on the boat with us. Just other\npassengers from any number of places. I don\u2019t remember really any of them\nparticularly, we were [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did people exchange stories? Other \u2014 other passengers exchange stories about\ntheir backgrounds?",
        "A: They may have, but none that I recall. I\u2014 no idea. Anyway, we came to the States\nand we were ensconced in the Whitehall Hotel on Broadway and Hundredth Street\nand my mother took us right away over to the nearest school, enrolled us in school\nand we didn\u2019t speak any \u2014 a word of English, again. And \u2014\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "Q: What was it like to arrive in the United States? The boat docks and you got off.\nDid it mean anything to a\u2014 a youngster of nine years old?",
        "A: I remember being on the side of the ship and my parents said look, there\u2019s the\nStatue of Liberty. And I looked, and so help me, I didn\u2019t see it. It was the \u2014 must\nhave been right under my nose, but I didn\u2019t see it. I don\u2019t know where I was looking,\nmaybe they were pointing awkwardly and I just looking around at all the other ships\nin the harbor, etcetera. It\u2019s skipped, completely. And we pulled into the pier and we\ncleared through customs in \u2014 almost instantly.",
        "Q: Did you notice any change in your folks when they put their feet \u2014 foot \u2014 put \u2014\nwhen they put their feet down on American soil?",
        "A: No, th \u2014 I think everybody was smiles, that I remember. It was a happy time. We \u2014\nwe were met by the \u2014 our acquaintances here and they said come, we take you to\nyour hotel and they took us with all our luggage on the subway. Through the\nturnstiles. Now, I don\u2019t know whether you remember the old fashioned turnstiles, but\nthey were \u2014 in the subways \u2014 but they were these wooden affairs that looked like very\nbig, huge, heavy propellers that you would push around. And we\u2019d had to drag\nthrough these things. But be \u2014 but even bef \u2014 before that, we \u2014 we had to get\nsomething to eat so they took us to the automat. Well for us, we\u2019ve never seen\nanything like this. First of all, there was so much food of everything, every kind that\nwe could ever want. And then, to be able to just put coins into a machine and have\nMarch 10, 2001\nthese things pop out was marvelous. We \u2014 we enjoyed that. And we wound up, as I\nsay, at the end of the subway ride in the \u2014 in the hotel. My next recollection I think\nwas mostly in the school where I could \u2014 was way ahead of the rest of the class in\nmathematics and way behind in understanding anything that was going on, because\nmy Dutch didn\u2019t help me much, my English didn\u2019t help me much. And \u2014 but we \u2014 we\nmanaged. We got along for a couple of months. It was, I think April, May, then\nschool \u2014 June and school was out and \u2014 and that was that. Now, lots of things\nhappened in between. We arrived on April first here in the United States. In early\nMay I believe it was, the Germans overran Holland. And that happened so quickly\nthat we did not have time, my parents did not have time to get my grandparents out of\nHolland. And although we didn\u2019t know it at that time, they were, shortly after the\nGermans walked in, they were taken on the train and transported to, as I finally\nlearned after visiting the Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, they lost their lives in\nSobibor. And when that happened, we don\u2019t know. Some time in the war years.\nWhether it was early on or later on, we just \u2014 I just don\u2019t know. I know my parents\nbecame aware of it sometime during the \u2014 1n the period between 1940 and 1944, that\nthey were gone. Actually maybe \u2014 no, it was just about then, I guess.",
        "Q: So they lost contact with \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "Q: \u2014 your grandparents right away?",
        "A: Yes, as soon as the Germans were in, that was almost impossible to communicate.\nThere was still some correspondence coming through because he \u2014 America was not\nat war with Germany. So you could still get some mail and they did, I think, until the\n\u2014 until the war broke out in 1941. So there was still some correspondence for a period\nof time and then after that. So it must have been in either 1942 or \u201943 that they were\ngrabbed with all the other Jews who were in Holland and deported. My brother and I\nwere sent to summer camp in the United States and shortly after we \u2014 that summer,\nthe year that we arrived, we went to the YMHA camp. Funny. And it was Surprise\nLake camp was the name of it. As it turns out, Anita, who I\u2019m married to right now\nalso went to that camp. Of course, we didn\u2019t know each other then. She was younger\nthan I. But \u2014",
        "Q: Was it in the country?",
        "A: Yes, it was in the country, and \u2014 Cold Springs, is it? Or something like that. And\nthey left us there in \u2014 where the \u2014 for \u2014 for I guess six weeks, for the summertime.\nAnd we were old enough at that time not to object to being without our parents, I\nguess. And we \u2014 and I guess two or three weeks after summer camp started, they\ncame up to visit us. And they came and they went to our counselor and they said,\nhow are the boys doing? And the counselor said well, what do you mean how are\nthey doing? They\u2019re fine. No, that\u2019s not what we mean, I mean how are they getting\nMarch 10, 2001\nalong with the other children? He said they get along okay. Well but, my parents\nsaid, they don\u2019t speak English. And the counselor said, of course they speak English.\nHe never knew that we couldn\u2019t speak English. And within a matter of literally\nweeks, we learned enough, learned English sufficiently so that no \u2014 nobody ever\nknew that we didn\u2019t sp \u2014 that we weren\u2019t English speaking to begin with. And I\nalways feel that such submersion for young people is probably the best way to learn a\nlanguage. It really 1s.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t have a German accent or anything like that?",
        "A: No, no, no accent. Well, I \u2014 certainly not a German accent. Well, I think one of\nthe reasons that we picked up the language was \u2014 so quickly was because we moved\nfrom Germany to Holland, we learned Dutch in a relatively short period of time\nbecause Dutch is also very similar to German. But Dutch also has a huge number of\nEnglish words in its language. So the transition was an easy one. Go from German to\nDutch to English. It was quite easy, at least for me and I think it helped enormously\nto \u2014 to have that progression. So here we were in the United States and we could\nspeak English and shortly after that summer my parents \u2014",
        "Q: Were there other immigrant children in the camp?",
        "A: No, not that I know of. Oh, there may have been, but I didn\u2019t know about it. I had\nno \u2014 no knowledge of it.\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "Q: Di-Did you tell the other children where you were born and some of the things\nyou had lived through?",
        "A: Don\u2019t remember recalling or saying anything to them. My brother and I were in\nthe same bunk. We spoke to each other, obviously and we just kept our ears open to\nwhat was going on and what was being said.",
        "Q: In German you spoke to each other?",
        "A: No, no, in \u2014 1n the bunk, in here. Th \u2014 in German, I \u2014 no, we spoke Dutch. If we\ndid speak, we spoke Dutch. We didn\u2019t want to speak German.",
        "Q: Why not?",
        "A: Ger \u2014 Germans were anathema in the United States at that time and we didn\u2019t\nwant to have the kind of discrimination experienced against us because we were\nGerman and German speaking. We wanted \u2014 we didn\u2019t want anything to do with\nGermans. Germans were a pariah and we didn\u2019t want to be part of the pariah. If\npeople noticed that we spoke German, they might take offense.",
        "Q: That\u2019s quite sophisticated for a nine year old.",
        "A: Not if you\u2019re accustomed to \u2014 not if you\u2019ve been accustomed to having that sort of\nthing done to you as a Jew in Germany. You were accustomed to it. You would know\nthat if you were just different than anybody else, if you wa \u2014 if you were different,\nyou better be somebody different who everybody liked, not somebody different\nwhom \u2014 whom everybody despised. So being Germans was not on the top of our list,\nMarch 10, 2001\nbut we spoke Dutch, and that was okay. See, Holland was still very friendly, they\nweren't tainted with Nazi persona, so we said okay, we \u2014 we were speaking Dutch,\nand that was at that time our major language. We came back from camp \u2014 because\nmy parents didn\u2019t speak Dutch at home and we no longer spoke Dutch, we spoke\nEnglish at that time. We promptly dropped Dutch and now I recall very, very little of\nDutch. Very little. \u2019've been back several times. I can probably read some of it and\nunderstand a little, but I don\u2019t speak it at all the way I did as a child when I was very,\nvery fluent in it. But German, strangely enough, being the mother tongue, I\nremember and I can understand it. So that was that.",
        "Q: So they you came back after the summer and you started school again?",
        "A: Yes. By that time my parents had moved to Forest Hills.",
        "Q: Queens?",
        "A: Queens. And \u2014 an apartment there and we went to school there. I guess it was\nthere, for the first time in America that I experienced that anti-Semitism was not a\nphenomenon that afflicted Europe alone. Because we were in the \u2014 I guess the third\ngrade in the school, public school in Forest Hills. Very lovely school, P.S. three. And\nI remember that it must have been one of the national holidays and my parents had\npinned an American flag to my lapel and my brother\u2019s lapel and we went off to\nschool. And I'll never forget it, but the teacher, knowing that we were immigrants,\nhad made a remark that you shouldn\u2019t be wearing that flag, you are not really\nMarch 10, 2001\nAmericans, or what have you. Something along those lines. And my mother took\ntremendous offense, she went to school and really \u2014 she was a very outspoken\nwoman, and she was quite outspoken about that sort of thing and said so. But more\nthan that, during our growing up years here, we had occasion to go with our parents.\nWhen we were a little bit older we went on holiday with them. And one of the trips\nthat we took was up to the Adirondacks.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nMarch 10, 2001\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Alfred Schnog. This is tape number three, side A, and you\nwere going up to the Adirondacks with your family.",
        "A: My parents had arranged to rent a cabin on Trout Lake, near Bolton Landing 1n \u2014\nin the Lake George region of the Adirondacks. And they had packed provisions to\ntake up with them, put them in the car and we headed up north. And when we arrived\nat the cabin it was truly a horrible place. The place was overrun with bugs. The\nmattresses were rotten and it was the kind of place that 1t would have been difficult to\nstay at in any circumstances. So my mother said, I don\u2019t care what we have with us \u2014\nand in those days we didn\u2019t have such great refrigeration, so we said we \u2014 we\u2019 ll just\nhave to go find someplace else to stay. They didn\u2019t realize is that every place there\nwas jam packed and during the summer you couldn\u2019t find a place. What we didn\u2019t\nrealize til we saw it were the restricted signs. And there were \u2014 came in any number\nof forms. There were either just plain restricted, a sign that said restricted, which\neverybody knew meant no Jews, or churches nearby which meant essentially the\nsame thing. And it came as a \u2014 a Surprise to me, or perhaps not as a surprise because\nof what we\u2019d been through. But my parents managed to ignore those things and live\nwith it and possibly they could ignore it because they had so much experience in\nGermany ignoring it. But it left its mark. Certainly left 1ts mark on me, that anti-\nMarch 10, 2001\nSemitism in whatever form, perhaps not as virulent as 1t was in Germany could exist\nanywhere, and indeed, it does exist almost everywhere. So \u2014",
        "Q: When did you take this trip the Adirondacks?",
        "A: When? Do to the \u2014 I \u2014 this must have been in \u2014 I must have \u2014 I was \u2014 I was older.",
        "Q: Was it still during the war?",
        "A: Oh yes. It was still during the war. We had saved gasoline coupons and whatever\nto \u2014 to make it, because gasoline was severely rationed during the war. I think I must\nhave been about 14 years old at the time, which would have been in 1900 and \u2014 well,\nmaybe 13 or four \u2014 1945 \u2014 \u201944 - \u201945, in that \u2014 in that period of time. I think maybe in\n\u2014I must have been 13 at the time, I\u2019m pretty sure it was. And we \u2014 we traveled\naround trying to find a place to stay, and not because of the restricted signs we\ncouldn\u2019t stay, it was just simply they were full, couldn\u2019t take anybody. And we\nwound up at a \u2014 right opposite where we had rented this cabin at a \u2014 at a \u2014 turned out\nto be a Jewish camp, summer camp. And we walked in, the camp hadn\u2019t started yet,\nbut the owners were there and my parents asked whether they could stay there over\nthe ni \u2014 overnight and they said oh, stay as long as you like. They saw two boys and\nobviously it was \u2014 they could sign up two campers, which indeed they did, so we\nwound up spending our summers there for the next four or five years and 1t was\nwonderful experience for us, and a nice part of the country and we got to know a lot\nMarch 10, 2001\nof interesting people and made a lot of friends, some of whom I still see today, and \u2014\nwent to camp with us.",
        "Q: What was the name of your camp?",
        "A: Camp \u2014 name was Camp Waldman and I don\u2019t think it exists today. I think it\u2019s\nbeen sold, I don\u2019t know who owns it or what. But the owner was a fellow named\nCharlie Garland who lived in Glens Falls, he was a baker. And they were wonderful\npeople, very friendly and so here was this really strange combination of anti-Semitic\nsigns on the roads going up to Lake George, and here this tremendous welcoming o-\nof a camp that it was run by Jews and obviously these people were extremely well\naccepted in their community, because we got to know them quite well, they were\nknown all over the area. So all these things happened together and 1-1-it was a strange\nmixture, really, and it \u2014 it -- it puzzled me at the time and it still puzzles me today,\nhow these two things can coexist.",
        "Q: Speaking about being 13 or 14, did you and your brother have a Bar-Mitzvah?",
        "A: Yes, we were \u2014",
        "Q: Could you tell a li \u2014 a little bit about that?",
        "A: Oh yes. When my \u2014 when we moved in here and we became \u2014 we were 11 or 12\nyears old, my parents said, well boys, you \u2014 you know, you have to think about your\nBar-Mitzvah, and we went to a Jewish synagogue in Rego Park. Today it\u2019s a very\nlarge synagogue, at that time it was a small shul, very Orthodox and we went to\nMarch 10, 2001\nSunday school, and we \u2014 and Hebrew school and like every good American boy we\nhated it. Despised it. In fact we \u2014 we spent our time doing mischief rather than paying\nattention to the class. I remember sticking a girl\u2019s bobby pin in the light socket and\nblowing out the lights in the whole place, in the synagogue. But it was \u2014 and no \u2014 and\nwhat amazed me most was the teacher came over to me, are you okay? She was more\nconcerned about me than I wa \u2014 she thought something had blown out of the wall,\nyou know. Aft \u2014 and I was totally responsible for the whole thing. But, it was about\nthat time that my father learned about the death of our \u2014 of my grandparents. And he,\nhaving been brought up very religiously, he went every morning and every night to \u2014\nto the minyan to \u2014 to the shul, and Norbert and I accompanied him. We went every\nsingle day with him for that \u2014 for that year of morning. And we learned our Bar-\nMitzvah lessons and had a \u2014 went through a regular Bar-Mitzvah at that shul. It was a\nvery nice time, we an \u2014 we loved the day, we loved being there, we loved \u2014 you\nknow, when you\u2019re \u2014 when you go through a Bar-Mitzvah, it\u2019s a wonderful thing for\na child. It\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s n\u2014 the learning and the stepping up to it is horrible, you hate it,\nevery minute of it. But when the day arrives and you manage your way through it, the\npride that you feel, and the \u2014 is exhilarating. And we \u2014 we really did enjoy that\nimmensely.",
        "Q: Was it hard for you to go through it without your grandparents and knowing what\nhappened to your grandparents?\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I gave it very much thought. It may have been very hard for my\nparents to realize that this was happening without their parents being there, but we\nhad accepted the death of the grandparents and didn\u2019t even think about the fact that\nthey weren\u2019t there, or \u2014 we didn't look back. I think that\u2019s more of an adult thing.\nYou \u2014 you do that when you have more [indecipherable] we were more concerned\nabout how well we would do in reciting the Haftorah and the Torah portions and how\n\u2014 and what might happen afterwards because we had \u2014 all my parents friends would\ncome over to the house afterwards and we would be on display, obviously for them\nand \u2014 and we\u2019d have to recite the blessings before the meals and the \u2014 and after the\nmeal and all of this, which was important to our parents that we know those things,\nand \u2014 you know, and we did know them and have long since forgotten.",
        "Q: Were you very devastated when you found out about your grandparents?",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 I had very fond memories of my grandparents and yes, I was \u2014 I can\u2019t\nsay that it was devastating, it was a loss. And I\u2019ve thought about it many times, you\nmiss them. But it was probably the f \u2014 the first time that \u2014 you know, there was so\nmuch death that you heard about in those days, so many stories of how people died.\nAnd by that time we were old enough to understand, and to know that this was\nhappening. And so it wasn\u2019t a \u2014 a total surprise and it wasn\u2019t totally devastating. You\nsort of knew that they were going to be caught up in it and that was that. [\u2014-I-I\nremember that we \u2014 none of us held out hope that they would ever get out. Perhaps\nMarch 10, 2001\nwe hoped because they were in Holland that they somehow might be safe from the \u2014\nfrom what was happening in Germany. But it was just a hope, and didn\u2019t turn out to\nbe the case, and that wasn\u2019t all too surprising, because we had \u2014 we had heard of\nother case, of other people in Holland who had lost their lives, who\u2019d been sent to\nconcentration camps and were no \u2014 no longer alive. Not just that, but people had\ncommitted suicide because of the struggles they were going through and they just\ncouldn\u2019t live with it any longer. There were many who did that.",
        "Q: Did your parents keep in touch with other relatives?",
        "A: Yes, they did, they kept in touch with those relatives they had, we had. There were\n\u2014 we had \u2014 my father had some relatives who had moved to Holland as well, who had\nmanaged to escape because they were \u2014 had become Dutch citizens, they escaped to\nAruba and Curacao and still live there. And it\u2019s quite a large family that\u2019s down there\nand they\u2019ve done very well. They \u2014 I think they own the agency to distribute Toyota\ncars on those islands. Nice people, I\u2019ve met some of them. We haven\u2019t been down\nthere but we\u2019ve \u2014 they\u2019ve been in New York and when I \u2014 certainly if I go down\nthere, the name Schnog will be all over the island, as it is, you know. So yes, we\u2019ve\nmanaged to keep in \u2014 somewhat in touch with those relatives.",
        "Q: So now you\u2019re a teenager, did you have many American friends, were you totally\naccepted, except for that teacher who commented about the flag?\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: Oh, no, we never had any trouble with that, our \u2014 our \u2014 many of our teachers were\nJewish themselves and at that stage nobody knew any longer that we were\nimmigrants. We spoke English without too much of a trace of an accent. And we\nwere good students, we had a lot of friends, very close friends. And wa \u2014 I guess we\nwere almost normal teenagers that time, we \u2014 I don\u2019t remember \u2014 I remember that I\ndid very well in school, I loved my teachers. I think the next most troubling thing in\nmy life was the fact that some of my teachers were involved in the McCarthy si \u2014 era\nsituation, that thing. You know, when we grew up in those days, we were very\nliberal, almost Socialistic \u2014 I would say Socialistic. And we \u2014 a-and our teachers\nwere very liberal, very bright. Well, we admired them and they were \u2014 enormously.\nMy math teachers, my science teachers, there was \u2014 th-those were the classes I really\nadored, I loved them, and the \u2014 and they taught us so much and taught us a love for\nlearning. I had a Latin teacher who I was very fond of, who was very fond of me\nbecause she passed me despite the fact that my brother was the one who did all the\nwork and I did all the copying. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did you stay in public schools?",
        "A: Yes, we stayed in public school, went to Forest Hills High School and graduated\nin Forest Hills High School. And then went to \u2014 we were \u2014 went to college, went to\nCornell University, where we both took an engineering course. Which was probably\nthe first big mistake I made in my life, but nevertheless, you know, in those days you\nMarch 10, 2001\nstuck with what you started and you finished it. And if you changed, somehow it was\nan admission of failure in one direction. At least I perceived it that way. I was maybe\ntoo immature to realize otherwise. So I stuck with engineering and got my degree,\nbut might have been much, much happier in a liberal arts environment.",
        "Q: Le-Let\u2019s go back a little bit. What was it like when you were 14 and a half and the\nwar was over?",
        "A: Well, there was tremendous joy when the war was over, and \u2014 you know, we\njoined in every celebration that \u2014 that had anything to do with destr \u2014 destroying\nNazism and Hitler. In every way, we just \u2014 all of America did and we were in the\nforefront of it, we did it just the same way, we hated this dictator. And we laughed at\nall the comical songs that were written at the time about Hitler, etcetera. And when\nthe war was over \u2014 you know, we\u2019d \u2014 we\u2019d \u2014 as children at that age, we dreamt about\ngoing into the army and fighting. We wanted \u2014 that was \u2014 that was very important to\nus. We were too young and our parents probably would have been horrified at the\nthought of it, but we\u2019d have dreams about this. We wanted to be in the army, to be a\npart of this, to fight as a soldier in \u2014 1n America. Not \u2014 not that we had any feeling\nbecause we immigrated and we came from Germany we had to do this, but simply\nbecause we were patriotic Americans. Extremely patriotic, as was everybody in those\ndays. I mean, there were kids in our school, in our high school who lied about their\nage to get \u2014 to go \u2014 to get into the Marines, or to get into the army, or what have you.\nMarch 10, 2001\nMy brother and I were very young, we looked young. We could never have passed 17\nor 18 to be able to get into the army, so we \u2014 it never dawned on us even to try. But if\nthe war had gone on, we would have au \u2014 we \u2014 I\u2019m sure we would have been in the\nforefront of volunteering to \u2014 to go into it, and we felt it was an obligation that we\nhad, to serve in America. So when the war was over, it was quite great. We wanted to\nknow all about what was \u2014 what had happened, where \u2014 what was left in Germany.\nMy parents actually went over and they saw what was left. This was [indecipherable |",
        "Q: When \u2014 when did \u2014 when did they go back?",
        "A: They \u2014 shortly after the war, it was either in 1940 \u2014 it probably was \u2014 I would\nguess it was in 1946, I would guess. Might have been 1945, but I think that might\nhave been too early. It must have been early in 1946, and Europe was devastated.\nAnd they went to Cologne and saw all the devastation that had been wrecked on the\nGerman cities by the continuous bombing. And they saw \u2014 they saw some of the\npeople who lived there, or recognized them when they came back. A story that my\nmother and father tell \u2014 told, they went to Cologne and they looked up a couple who\nwas \u2014 they had run the grocery store, I guess, there. And they went and asked about\nthem, and they still were running a grocery store. And they went over there to \u2014 and\nthey looked in the window there, I guess they were running a pastry shop or\nsomething like that. And the woman who ran the shop, and my parents knew, looked\nout the window and saw my mother and she turned pale. She said, Mrs. Schnog, Frau\nMarch 10, 2001\nSchnog, is that you? And my mother came in and said yes, it\u2019s me, we\u2019re back. How\nare you? Tell me, how did you survive? And they were, as my mother said, very\ndecent people caught up in this horror story with the Germans, they \u2014 many of them\ncouldn\u2019t do anything out of fear that something would happen to them. Indeed, my\nfather tells the story about a man who couldn\u2019t keep his mouth shut, he says, and he\nlived in Deutz near my grandparents. He was Christian, he hated the Nazis. He let\neverybody know that these \u2014 Hitler and these Nazis would ruin Germany. And\nwhat\u2019d they do? They caught him, they cut his head off. So that kind of terror visited\non a population brings about so much fear, that people shrink away. No wonder they\nput signs in their windows, no Jews. If they didn\u2019t, God knows what would have\nhappened to them, in their own minds. So there were a lot of \u2014 a lot of Germans who\ndidn\u2019t willingly participate in this, who did so I think out of fear, and what reprisals\nmight be visited on them. There were some of course, who went right along with it,\nwho \u2014 who thought Hitler was the last word and you know, this is \u2014 this 1s the new\nSiegfried, the \u2014 the hero of German mythology is going to \u2014 th-the vag \u2014 the Wagner\npeople, all this romanticism that really isn\u2019t romanticism, it\u2019s just pure Germanic.\nAnd those are the ones who Hitler really appealed to.",
        "Q: How \u2014 when did you become a citizen and what was it like for you?",
        "A: Oh, interesting, yes. When my parents arrived here they immediately applied for\ncitizenship and it was a five year waiting period. Five years passed and they were\nMarch 10, 2001\ncalled before a judge and I re-remember going with them before the judge and the\nswearing in. And they were just thrilled, as I was, and \u2014 to become an American\ncitizen. This was a dream that had come true for them. And shortly thereafter, we \u2014\nmy brother and I became citizens by derivation. So we also were called and we were\nsworn in. And I, of course, have that certificate and it\u2019s something we\u2019re all very\nproud of, and we \u2014 listen, this country saved our lives. The fact that we got over here\nmay have been pure luck, or it may have been God\u2019s doing. I don\u2019t think it was that, I\nthink it was just plain luck and a little bit of fortitude and a little bit of courage on the\npart of my father, and seeing what was happening and \u2014 well, but to escape so many\ntimes from \u2014 slip though at the last moment, always the last to arrive before the doors\nshut, 1s something that amazes me. I am now probably the only survivor of my\nimmediate family because my brother passed away at 54, he had pancreatic cancer\nand died. My mother died in \u2014 when she was 90 \u2014 91 \u2014 90 years old. My father died\nof the Alzheimer\u2019s disease in \u2014 when he was 84. But I often ask myself, you know,\nwhy am I here longer than the other? Why ar \u2014 why aren\u2019t there more of us who\nmanaged it? But you -- when I think about some of the stories that you read about\npeople who don\u2019t believe or who refuse to accept the fact that there was a Holocaust\nat all, it\u2019s something that I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2014 number one, I don\u2019t understand it. Number\ntwo, I ga \u2014 these are the kinds of people \u2014 the kinds of people who \u2014 who \u2014 whose\nthought process 1s so shallow, the same one who Hitler was able to \u2014 to inveigle to\nMarch 10, 2001\nbring into his party. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s a horror and so anything that \u2014 you know, history\nis something that lives only with people who have lived it themselves. Those that\nhaven\u2019t, except for the few who educate themselves, who will read history and will\nbe able to understand it, for \u2014 except for those, people not only forget, but it has no\nmeaning for them. They read a history book. There was World War II, it lasted from\nthis date to that date. This 1s what s \u2014 took place, but 1t means nothing. It means\nabsolutely nothing. When I was a child I talked to my grandfather and I asked him\nabout World War I. My grandfather served in the German army in World War I, and\nhe told me stories. He told me the story one day of an airplane that came and dropped\ntwo bombs in Cologne, and I was impressed. But World War I had no meaning to\nme. Not from what was relayed to me. It meant nothing. World War II, yes, had\nevery meaning. I was too closely involved. You know, look at our children today.\nThey look back and they come to me and they want to know a little bit about World\nWar II, I can tell them certain things about World War II, but it won\u2019t have any\nmeaning for them. They are much closer to the last war we fought in, the desert or in\nperhaps Vietnam if they\u2019re a little older and went through that era. But even that\npasses, and if they don\u2019t inform themselves and don\u2019t reach back and read the history\nand in \u2014 get involved a little bit more closely into what \u2014 perhaps into people\u2019s lives,\nor into \u2014 there have been some wonderful books written about World War II. If they\ndon\u2019t read that, or if they \u2014 if you haven\u2019t read \u201cAII Quiet on the Western Front,\u201d you\nMarch 10, 2001\nwould not really understand the abhorrence of war that came out of World War I.\nAnd I think that\u2019s missing today and much of that is missing and it\u2019s too bad, it really\nis and I think this is the kind of thing that fosters the thoughts that the Holocaust\nnever happened. And it sure did. There was one other vignette that\u2019s rather\ninteresting. A few years ago, here in America, my parents were living in Florida and\nmy mother \u2014 I came down to Florida to go to attend an affair of some sort. I\u2019ve\nforgotten whether it was a formal affair or whether we were just going out for \u2014 for\ndinner. And I was over at her apartment, we were chatting and I was getting dressed.\nI was staying with her. And I had forgotten to bring my cufflinks. And I said, Mom,\nyou know, I don\u2019t have any cufflinks, did Dad have any? And she said yeah, yeah,\nwait a minute, I have something for you. And she brought out a pair of silver\ncufflinks. She said these \u2014 these will do fine. And I looked at them and I said, yes\nthey will, where\u2019d Dad get these? She said, well, it\u2019s an interesting story, I have to\ntell you about it. And she said, when your father was young, about to be Bar-\nMitzvahed, 13 years old, there was a \u2014 your grandfather, Arnold, rented a room in his\nhouse to a German soldier, an officer. And he used that room to entertain his\ngirlfriend. And he was a very nice gentleman and he knew your father was being Bar-\nMitzvahed, so he purchased those cufflinks for your father as a Bar-Mitzvah gift.\nAnd, she said to me, you\u2019d be interested in knowing the name of that German officer.\nAnd I said, yeah, well who was he? She said, his name was von Stauffenberg. And I\nMarch 10, 2001\nstar \u2014 I was startled; von Stauffenberg was the general who took part in the\nassassination attempt against Hitler in the latter stages of the war. So history touches\nyou, no matter where you are, at one point or another, and here in a pair of cufflinks,\nit reaches back and it touches you. And it\u2019s these kinds of stories that make history\nalive. I hope I can pass all these things on to my children that they\u2019Il remember it. I\ndon\u2019t know whether I \u2014 I have myself been back to Germany on several occasions.\nI\u2019ve been there on business and I\u2019ve met people in Germany. And you can\u2019t help,\nwhen you meet one of the older generation, my generation, you can\u2019t help but\nwonder where they were in those years between \u201938 and \u00b044, what they were doing,\nwhether they took part in any of the atrocities that were visited on the Jews. But you\nhesitate to ask. Maybe my parents weren\u2019t so afraid. Maybe they did ask, a few\ntimes. But I\u2019ve never asked. I\u2019ve met some of the younger people and they don\u2019t\nreally have a recollection of it, and in that case perhaps it\u2019s good for them, for\nGermany. One of the interesting trips that we recently took, we went a cruise and\nwound up \u2014 up in the \u2014 in the Baltic. And we would up in Rostock. And there they\nhad a bus trip to Berlin. Well, for the people who were on the cruise, and there were a\ngroup of Jewish people on the cruise who wanted to s \u2014 particularly see the\nsynagogue in Berlin. My wife and I didn\u2019t have an overriding interest to do that, but\nthey needed to gather enough people together to \u2014 to put a busload together and we\nvolunteered to join them. And so we went into Berlin.\nMarch 10, 2001\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Alfred Schnog. This is tape number three, side B and you\nwere on this trip going into Berlin.",
        "A: Right. So, as I say, we volunteered to go along with them, and we went into Berlin\nand we had a German guide, a young woman, very knowledgeable, who took us\naround and showed us the highlights in Berlin and the tour. And the tour a \u2014 the\ncenterpiece of the tour was going to see Checkpoint Charlie, and what used to be East\nGermany and the wall, this small section that they preserved for histo \u2014 for history.\nAnd very little was remembered by the guide of \u2014 or was told to any of us about\nWorld War II and what happened in Berlin during that period of time, period of\nyears. It was interesting observation for me, because the young Germans were more \u2014\nmuch more affected, and understandably so, by the separ \u2014 the \u2014 the separation of\neast and the \u2014 Germany and West Germany and the hardships that the eastern\nGermany \u2014 Germans experienced, and the fact that they were separated from their\nfamilies and couldn\u2019t see each other, and the \u2014 the wall and the suicides that resulted\nfrom that, or people who were killed trying to escape. And this was foremost in their\nminds, this was how horrible things were during those years. They didn\u2019t look back\nto World War II and what happened then. That was not part of their being, their\nMarch 10, 2001\nsubstance, their \u2014 their memory, and \u2014 except for one instance, which I found highly\ninteresting. She told us, the guide, that she was taking us to the university in Berlin.\nAnd we got out and there was this very large square, quadrangle in the center of the\nuniversity. And we marched out to the middle of this square and mostly cobblestones\nand in the middle was a square. I don\u2019t know, I would say it was the size of, oh,\nmaybe three meters by three meters, so about \u2014 roughly about thr \u2014 a little more than\nthree yards by three yards square, and glass, right in the ground. You kn \u2014 you know,\nit was part of the \u2014 the ground, it wa \u2014 it wasn\u2019t raised in any fashion. And she\ngathered everybody around this glass square that was cut into the ground and she\nsaid, would you please look down and tell me what you see? And we looked down\nand what we could see under the glass were empty bookcases around the square and\nshe asked whether we knew what that was. And of course being all Jews, many of us\ndid know exactly what it was. It\u2019s a representation and a memorial of the book\nburning, where the Nazis had burned all the books. An \u2014 and that that would be there\nin \u2014 at the University of Berlin, well I thought was extremely interesting. The fact\nthat she knew about it and that she was willing to tell us about it, even though it was\nnot on her tour and that she wasn\u2019t expected to show us this, was very interesting for\nus. Then we wound up \u2014 which they clearly avoided because they saved it for the last\npart of the day, we wound up at the Jewish synagogue there, which was burned by\nthe Germans, probably on Kristallnacht, and \u2014 and restored. Now it\u2019s no longer being\nMarch 10, 2001\nused as a Synagogue cause it was violated as religious ground. But we stood outside.\nThere\u2019s a museum right next door to it where we could go in for a few minutes and\nsee what there was, we really didn\u2019t have much time. But there were two plaques on\nthe outside of the synagogue explaining what had happened and how it was restored,\netcetera. And most of my fellow cruise members couldn\u2019t read German etcetera, so I\nwound up being the one who read the plaques for them and translated it for them, and\nthey were quite moved by it. And I was pleased to be able to open their eyes to this\nand to be able to read them. Now I think they were, strangely enough, more affected\nby it than I was, because I had been through it, I had seen it. I think it was more of a\nshock to most of these people this actually happened and that this is where it took\nplace and these are the \u2014 the memorials to it. So I\u2014I found that trip very enlightening\nand I guess more so from the point of youth that the Germans today are, just like\neverybody else in the world, they are obsessed with the history of today and not with\nthe history of yesterday.",
        "Q: Can we get back to your life? You finished college \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- as an engineering student.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And then what happened?\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: Well, I was an engineering student and I had at that time \u2014 during my time at\ncollege, the Korean war broke out. And we \u2014 obviously we wanted to f \u2014 at that time\nfinish our education, so we joined the ROTC program at college. And we finished\nour engineering degree and graduated as lieutenants in the United States Army and\nwent right away into service. We had an obligation to serve at least two years of\nactive duty, at which time \u2014",
        "Q: This is 1953?",
        "A: This was 1953. \u201954, actually. And we \u2014 we thought we might be able to get a nice\nplush assignment, maybe go to Japan, which was very interesting, or I thought, my\ngoodness, you know, I\u2019m fluent in German, maybe they could send me to Germany,\nyou know, I could \u2014 would be a wonderful opportunity. Well, of course the United\nStates Army doesn\u2019t think in those terms. Nor did they know or did they think in the\nterms that I was an engineer, a graduate, they could have put me into any number of\npositions where that would have been useful. No, I was in the ordinance corps and I\nwas going to be \u2014 and I had that \u2014 you know, they had all these electronic things, they\ncould have easily put me into that and helped, but no, no, I\u2019m going to Korea and\nthat\u2019s that. So off we went, my brother and I both went to Korea. Fortunately we\nwent shortly after Eisenhower had made his historic visit to Korea and the war was \u2014\nthe fighting had stopped. And we were there just shortly afterwards. So the country\nwas extremely poor, Korea, and it wa \u2014 had been destroyed and we wound up at the \u2014\nMarch 10, 2001\nat an army depot near Incheon, [indecipherable] city. ? ve since been back and you\ncan\u2019t recognize it any more, the country has boomed economically and \u2014 of course\nnot in North Korea, but at least in South Korea it has. And we spent \u2014 I spent two\nyears there. My brother was stationed up on the DMZ, the demilitarized zone at the\ntime, and we\u2019d see each other occasionally, I would fly up with friends of mines who\nwere pilots and \u2014 and in \u2014 in the army. They would fly me up in these sal \u2014 small\nplanes and I\u2019d visit him or -- and he would return the visit. Sometimes we\u2019d \u2014 got our\nJeeps and drove up through these rutted roads and dust and \u2014 and it was a\u2014 it was a\nboring existence cause there was nothing to do, and Korea was cold and miserable.\nThe rats were the size of \u2014 well, pigs. They were huge, and you\u2019d live with them.\nThere were a lot of \u2014 there were a lot of people who had been displaced by the war, a\nlot of orphans in orphanages, which you know, just tore your heart out. And as\nsoldiers and as officers, we did what we could to help out these orphanages. We\ncollected from our troops and from the re \u2014 other officers to help these people, and\nthey were very grateful, they were \u2014 for everything that we could do there. They\u2019re a\ntough people, the Koreans, they really are and they manage to survive. But it \u2014 you\nreally \u2014 it was not the kind of service that I expected in the United States Army. I\nexpected, you know, World War II, you\u2019re going to go out, fight, right? But no, no,\nno, nothing like that. Met a lot of people and learned a little bit about the average\nAmerican, and how much \u2014 how important the average American is to America\u2019s\nMarch 10, 2001\nlife, and how basically good they are, despite \u2014 da \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter what their level\nof education is. It really didn\u2019t matter and there were people \u2014 I was \u2014 one of the jobs\nthat was assigned to me, I was a commander of a depot supply company there and\none of the other jobs I had was to \u2014 was for the education, I was the education officer\nfor the battalion and we had many, many sergeants, people who had worked their\nway up through the ranks, who barely had an education above a grade school level.\nAnd we furnished them with additional \u2014 with \u2014 with schools and tried to bring them\nand as well as many of the \u2014 the enlisted men up to at least a grade level or a high\nschool level education. But it didn\u2019t matter how educated they were, they were\nbasically very, very good people, very honest people. I had a group of sergeants who\nI got along with extremely, extremely well. They did things for me \u2014 at that time\nthere was absolutely no accountability for supplies in the United States Army. And\nwhen I was \u2014 when I signed \u2014 when I took over the command of my company, I\nsigned off on things I didn\u2019t know I had, or didn\u2019t know existed and \u2014 and when it\nfinally came time for me to turn the company over to the next officer that would take\nover, I had to do a \u2014 an inventory really, what th \u2014 what the heck did we have and\nwhat did I sign for, and you know, I\u2019m responsible for this, have to sign it back. And\nthere were \u2014 there was a Jeep in there that I remember that I never even knew existed.\nAnd \u2014 and we had \u2014 and we had some things that we had so much in excess of that it\nshouldn\u2019t have been there, but I se \u2014 I said to one of my sergeants, I \u2014 what \u2014 what\nMarch 10, 2001\nare we going to do about this, or where\u2019s this Jeep? He said oh please lieutenant, he\nsaid, don\u2019t worry about it, just bring the guy over tomorrow morning, we\u2019ll take care\nof it. So in the morning I came over with a new officer and I introduced him to my\nstaff and I said okay, would you \u2014 h-here is our inventory, would you sign off on it\nplease? And we start looking around and when he checked it off and we went outside\nand there is this Jeep sitting there and I look at the inventory list and the serial\nnumber, everything 1s just exactly the way it should be. And I said hm, I guess it\nmust have been somewhere, but \u2014 and the fellow signed off and everything was just\nperfect. And when he left I pulled out a bottle that I had there and I said, look\ngentlemen, the s \u2014 the sergeants \u2014 well, you know, I guess this is goodbye. I want you\nto have a drink and \u2014 and we exchanged pleasantries, had a drink and I said, now\nwait a minute sergeant, I said, where the hell\u2019d that Jeep come from? And he said sir,\nhe said, in about five minutes we have to return it to battalion A, and we\u2019ve got to\nrepaint the thing. So it\u2019s that kind of thing. Everybody would help everybody out.",
        "Q: Di-Did putting on an American army uniform bring back any memories of\nGerman uniforms?",
        "A: No, not at all, not at all. The way I saw and perceived the Germans were almost\nlike the \u2014 theatrical costumes, theatrical people. They were so outlandish in their\nstyle of dress with their epaulets and their \u2014 and their polished boots and their \u2014 you\nknow, you don\u2019t get this in the United States Army. I hope not, I hope we never will.\nMarch 10, 2001\nAnd it did not, it did n \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2014I never even thought of it in that fashion, never\nequated my service in the army with what \u2014 what I saw in Germany, never. So then\nwe were finished with our service in the army after 14 months, came back to the\nUnited States and I at that stage had a choice to make in my career as to whether I\nwanted to be an engineer for the rest of my life, or whether I wanted to try something\nelse. And I knew \u2014 had known really all along that engineering was not my calling.\nAnd Is \u2014I said, well you know, it\u2019s something I can always go back to. But I went to\nsee my father and I said dad, you know, can you get me a job with your company? I\nwant to get into sales or something where I deal with people. And just to see whether\nI like that. I can always go back to engineering. And he said sure, and he got me a\njob. I essentially went to work for my father\u2019s company. My brother, who graduated\nCornell as an electrical engineer as I did, was pretty close to being top in his class. I \u2014\nI was, I guess, the goof off and he was the one who a-applied himself. Not only did\nhe apply himself, he had a calling for engineering. He was a lot like my father, my\nfather always wanted to be an engineer and never had the opportunity. My brother\nhad the opportunity and made the most of it. He immediately went to work as an\nengineer when he got out of the army and wound up in the \u2014 in the optics field in\nengineering. Interestingly enough, one of the highlights of his career was that he\ntestified before Congress. Malcolm Wallop\u2019s committee, which at the time was\nlooking into the feasibility of space and using space for military purposes. And my\nMarch 10, 2001\nbrother, along with four other engineers, or three other engineers, I guess, were called\nbefore the committee to testify. They were known as the Gang of Four.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I have a book that actually states that. And I think he had a lot to do at that\ntime in persuading Ronald Reagan to go ahead with his space missile programs. So\nhere you have a young man who was brought up in Germany, who escaped with his\nlife testifying before Congress, I think it\u2019s amazing, and \u2014 that he accomplished all of\nthat. He was instrumental in designing the mirrors and the optics for the first space \u2014\nastronomical space obs \u2014 observatory, which they shot up into space, it worked very\nwell. He was working on the Hubble when he died and my nephews and nieces say,\nyou know, if Norbert had been around to finish that job with everybody, they\nwouldn\u2019t have had the trouble they did with the Hubble. Well, you know, that may\nbe, it may not be, who knows, but he \u2014 he spent his career doing that and was quite,\nquite proud of it, and he should have been.",
        "Q: Did you keep up a close relationship as you all became adults?",
        "A: We kept up a relationship. Was it close? My brother and I are totally different\npersonalities \u2014 we were. And it was difficult for him to express his inner thoughts and\nto open up to people. And I think also difficult for him to open up his feelings toward\nme, or with me. We certainly kept up contacts through all those years. His children\nMarch 10, 2001\nare now as close to me as my own children are, particularly his son, who I think has\nmore in common with me than my own son. Their \u2014",

        "A: Not terribly much, no. I think he had his recollections and I had mine. No, I don\u2019t\nthink so. We \u2014 more \u2014 we kept up more with the kinds of things that happened later\nin our lives when we came to America. Our camp experiences and the time there,\nlet\u2019s say, perhaps the \u2014 some of the years that we spent in the army together. Not so\nmuch as to what happened in Germany and \u2014 and in \u2014 1n Holland prior years.",
        "Q: So you went to work for your father?",
        "A: Went to work, yes.",
        "Q: And did you stay in the long \u2014 a long time?",
        "A: I worked for my father and we \u2014 I was stationed up in Boston for awhile learning\nhow to become a steel scrap trader. And it was very difficult. I had problems dealing\nwith New Englanders because they were so difficult to talk with, you know, they\ndidn't open up. I \u2014 I think one of the things I learned there was that sometimes it\u2019s\ngood to keep your mouth shut. I never forget the time I had to persuade a New\nEngland scrap dealer to sell me a carload of scrap, because we were going to ship it\nMarch 10, 2001\noff to \u2014 on a ship com \u2014 sailing out of Boston. And he was selling all his scrap to a\ncompetitor. And so I went in to see him \u2014 Leroy was his name. And I said \u2014 I\nintroduced myself and I told him who I worked for and I said, I\u2019d like to buy your\nscrap and I gave him my sales pitch, this is what I want, this 1s what I\u2019m ready to pay\nfor it and I really would like to start and I hope you can give us a chance, and what\nhave you. And then I had made my pitch, I said, what do you think? And he didn\u2019t\nanswer. He just sat there. And for awhile I said to myself, well, should I say\nsomething, or shouldn\u2019t I? And I said, you know, I\u2019ve just said everything that I need\nto say. If he\u2019s not going to reply to me, just keep your mouth shut, sit. For once in\nyour lifetime, don\u2019t say anything. So I sat there what was an interminable amount of\ntime and I don\u2019t know how long it was, maybe four or five minutes or so, which 1s\nridiculous, you know, you\u2019re sitting there and you\u2019re wondering what you\u2019re going to\ndo, and beginning to sweat. Should I get up and leave, what? And he suddenly said,\nyup, okay. Now, I don\u2019t know what he was thinking about, I have no idea. And I\nwon\u2019t ever question it. But that was that, I said thank you and I left and I sent him the\norder and that was that. So I learned a lot from that experience. I stayed with that\ncompany, I wasn\u2019t happy there in New England, and moved back to New York and\nmet Ben Livingston, who was an elderly man, was my father\u2019s partner for some\nyears. And we \u2014 and I got into the import and export business in \u2014 in \u2014 in steel. It was\nin the new steel business. And in 1962 he retired from the company. And I know he\nMarch 10, 2001\nwas \u2014 he was not happy retiring, he was an active man. He was in his 70\u2019s, but\nwanted to continue to work, which is very interesting because I feel exactly the same\nway today and I\u2019m probably about the same age he was when he retired. And so, with\nmy father\u2019s help, I spoke with Ben Livingston and we put together three people and\nwe Said, let\u2019s go out in business and start the business. And I figured that Ben\nLivingston had a good reputation in the field. If he stayed active in the business for\njust three years, we\u2019d have enough grounding in order to be able to \u2014 to run the\nbusiness without him. Well, we did. We went out, found a small office in the Lincoln\nbuilding in New York and went to work with three of us, myself, an associate of\nmine and Ben Livingston, the younger associate. And we started to build the\ncompany. And in three years Ben Livingston showed no signs of retiring and he was\nas \u2014 he\u2019s \u2014 he was \u2014 h-he lived until he was 89 years old. He came into the office\nevery single day. He was no longer active in the daily trading, but he became a very\nclose friend of mine and we were able to talk to each other and pass information back\nand forth f-for \u2014 for many years. We \u2014 I finally took over as the president of the\ncompany and it was extremely successful, 1t worked out quite well. Into \u2014 one of the\ninteresting incidents I\u2019Il never forget with Ben Livingston, he was in his 80\u2019s already\nand found it difficult to get around. He was using a cane. He was a big man, heavy,\nand he would start losing some of his agility. And I was in the office talking to him, I\nwas going to take a trip to Argentina, a business trip and I sat down and I told him\nMarch 10, 2001\nwhat I was going to do, and how we were going to get around, we had a problem\nthere, and discussed the problem with him and how best to solve it. Suddenly the\nlights went out in the building and we were on the \u2014 that time on the 21 floor of the\nLincoln building. And I said okay, let\u2019s sit around, let\u2019s see what happens. And half\nan hour passed and the lights didn\u2019t come back on. And I said, you know,\nsomething\u2019s going on. We called up and we found out the whole east coast was\nblacked out. I don\u2019t know whether you remember the big blackout. And I said Ben, I\ndon\u2019t know whether we\u2019re going to get home. The trains aren\u2019t running, everything is\nclosed down. I just made a telephone call, the whole east coast is blacked out. I don\u2019t\n\u2014 can\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t think I can leave you here. And he said well, you know something, I \u2014\nif you'll help me I \u2014 let\u2019s go up to my club. He was a memory of the Harmony Club\nup on Fifth Avenue, which was up on 60\" Street. And I said, all right, come on, I\u20191l\nhelp you. And we \u2014 poor fellow, he walked down 21 flights of stairs with his cane,\nand we started walking uptown. It was an extraordinary night. You know, people\ndidn\u2019t know what was happening, it was the height of the Cold War, people thought\nthat the Russians were sending missiles over and bombing America and we were\ngoing to be attacked any moment, and there were all kinds of fears everywhere.\nPeople were praying, it was just unbelievable what was happening in New York City.\nAnd we were walking up Fifth Avenue, straight up Fifth Avenue. And Ben got pretty\ntired. We were up near 50\" Street and he was kind of exhausted by this time, and\nMarch 10, 2001\nthere was Saint Patrick\u2019s Cathedral right there next to us. And I said Ben, you know,\nwhy don\u2019t we go inside and sit down, you know, you can use a spell of rest, and I \u2014\nand he said you know AI, that\u2019s a good idea, let\u2019s go. So we went to Saint Patrick\u2019s\ncathe \u2014 Cathedral, which was amazing. It was lit up by candles and people, you\nknow, they were afraid, they didn\u2019t know what was happening and they were praying\nand 1-it was an extraordinary sight. And we sat down, we just sat and relaxed for\nawhile until \u2014 and I observed all this, the people crying, people in fear, people not\nknowing where they were going to go, people just resting like we were. And finally\nBen said okay, I think I\u2019m up to going a little bit further. And we marched from there\nthe next 10 blocks to get up to the Harmony Club. We walked in and he said, come\non up to the second floor. We went up to the second floor, wherever it was and there\nwere these huge leather chairs. And we just plopped down and he said okay, now\nwhat will you drink? And we had some scotch and really just enjoyed that evening.\nAnd eventually I think I found my way home by \u2014 I left Ben there, I knew he was\ntaken care of and I found my way home with a group of other guys in a taxi that\nnight. That\u2019s what I remember about Ben Livingston then.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re still in this \u2014 in the same business?",
        "A: Yeah, the business was \u2014 went quite well for many, many years and in 1991 we\nhad some very bad luck, we \u2014 we had a \u2014 an operation with, or a \u2014 a joint venture\nwith an organization, we started a company in Puerto Rico with a man who would \u2014\nMarch 10, 2001\nwe thought we could trust and as often these things happen, we couldn\u2019t. The \u2014 the\ntrust was not \u2014 was not well placed, and we lost an awful lot of money na \u2014 in that\nparticular year, so much so that we had to go out of business [indecipherable]. And\nwe joined \u2014 we \u2014 what we wound up doing was set \u2014 discharging our employees,\nwhich I think was probably one of the most difficult things I\u2019ve ever had to do, let\npeople go, tell them that we just couldn\u2019t carry on. And we went \u2014 we joined a \u2014\nanother organization, Stemcor at the time, whom we sold ourselves to for practically\nnothing because they didn\u2019t believe we could do anything. So we said okay, we\u2019 ll\nmake a deal with you. Here\u2019s what we want to earn and if we don\u2019t earn it, you don\u2019t\npay us anything. So we were at risk and if we lost money we were prepared to make\nit up to them. And so we went to work for them and it didn\u2019t take very long, we hit it\njust right and in three years we had recovered practically everything we lost on the\nother company. It was \u2014 we did exceedingly well. And it came time to renegotiate the\ncontract and we renegotiated it and then \u2014 for two \u2014 for two more years. And then\nthey got kind of jealous by how much we were making, and you know, th-these\nthings happen. We got into arguments about why aren\u2019t you paying us and they\nwanted to create all kinds of reserves. Well, you \u2014 you \u2014 we\u2019re not going to pay you\nnow and we\u2019ll pay you later and we said no. And after two years we closed that up.\nActually, there was a lawsuit that resulted from the \u2014 the closing of the Livingston\norganization. The banks has lost some money in that transaction as well.\n89March 10, 2001\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nMarch 10, 2001\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Alfred Schnog. It is tape number four, side A, and you were\ntalking about your professional career.",
        "A: Yeah, so we \u2014 we were working for this organization, the name was Stemcor and\nwe had, when we joined them we did exceedingly well, we had renegotiated our\ncontract. And we were also involved at the time, together with Stemcor in a legal\nmatter, which stemmed from the old business. And I remember the president of that\ncompany, Ralph Oppenheimer came over to see me and we went to see \u2014 talk\nsettlement with the opposing parties, who were the banks. And the judge demanded\nthat we settle for, I think a million dollars was the settlement \u2014 would be. And I\nremember taking the train back with Oppenheimer from the \u2014 from the courthouse to\nNew York City. And he said, Alfred, you are going to pay your share of this. And we\nhad had an agreement that we would not, if there was such a situation we would not\nhave to participate in it. And I said no, we\u2019re not. We have an agreement and we\u2019re\ngoing to stick to our agreement. We stuck to ours, now you stick to yours. And he\nsaid well, you know, if you don\u2019t, I will not renew your contract. And I said all right,\nif that\u2019s the way you feel. So I\u2014I believe I said, that\u2019ll suit me just fine. You know, I\nwas sick and tired of that \u2014 running into that kind of an argument with him. And I\nkind of felt I must have a lot of my mother and father in me, because they would\nMarch 10, 2001\nhave done the same thing. They would have said no, a deal\u2019s a deal. Let\u2019s live by it.\nAnd so we left Stemcor. We then proceeded to have three more years with another\nBritish company where we managed for them the organization. And as of the\nbeginning of last year, Anita and I have been conducting the business on our own.\nWe \u2014 th-that business end that they didn\u2019t want \u2014 that they had to pull out of the\norganization because they had problems in Russia because of the economic problems\nthat the Russians had. So the English really said th \u2014 we need to get out, we need to\nhave somebody buy us out. And we couldn\u2019t find anybody to buy them out so they\ndecided well then we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll leave you and we\u2019 run it ourselves and maybe close\nit up, though I don\u2019t know what they planned to do with it. But we started our own\nbusiness as of the end of \u2014 at the beginning of this year. And we\u2019re \u2014 just the two of\nus are operating it. That\u2019s very, very \u2014 it\u2019s a lot of fun, and we enjoy it, it\u2019s our life\nand \u2014 and we continue to carry that on. That\u2019s been successful, so \u2014 you know.",
        "Q: Do you take any business trips to Germany?",

I\u2019d\nlike to take Anita to Germany, I\u2019d like to introduce her to the things that I saw and\ntake her to some of the places that I remember. Where my grandparents lived. The\nRhine where I went swimming, which I don\u2019t think you can do today. It\u2019s like putting\nyour silver spoon into a cup of coffee and watching it melt, you know. And of course\nMarch 10, 2001\nto Holland, Anita has been to Holland, I took her there. But I would like to do that,\nyes, an-and I will.",

So we have 10\ngrandchildren altogether between the two of us. So there\u2019s a lot to be thankful for.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk now a little bit about your thoughts and feelings. Do \u2014 do you think you\nwould be a different man today than if you had had a different childhood than you\ndid and ha-had to go through the things that you did? The difficult times.",
        "A: Absolutely, I think I would be very different. I think that history and your\nupbringing, your experiences as a young \u2014 as a young man do form your later life.\nMarch 10, 2001\nYou know, you can\u2019t purge yourself of the knowledge and the feelings. They stay\nwith you all your life. And no matter how young you are when you experience these\nthings, they remain with you. They remain with you. I don\u2019t think that I would ever\nfeel entirely comfortable or at all comfortable in any place where Jews were looked\nat as inferior or being something less than what the rest of the citizenry of whatever\ncountry that is, was. I don\u2019t think that I would have formed my feelings of social\njustice if I had not gone through what I went through. Perhaps I would have. I guess a\nlot depends on the kind of education you have, on your parents and how they feel. I\nam enormously offended by people who unfairly oppress others in \u2014 in any manner,\nand object to it violently when I \u2014 when it\u2019s so. I \u2014 so all those things come from, I\nthink, my past. I have no patience for people who try to bully others in any shape or\nform. I think that also stems from my childhood. And I have a deep sense that history\nsomehow will repeat itself someplace in the same way, and my God, we have seen it\nin our lifetime. We\u2019ve seen the oppression that are visited on people everywhere in\nthe world. They may not be oppression of \u2014 of the Christians against Jews or \u2014 or the\nNazis against \u2014 committing genocide against any number of people. But you do have\nit, you have it \u2014 you had it in \u2014 in Bosnia very recently. You ha -- it\u2019s happening all\nover the world, it\u2019s happening in Indonesia now. It\u2019s \u2014 and I have no patience for\nthat. I \u2014 a-and \u2014 and I know what people come away with who live through such\ntimes. How we had it in our own hemisphere. Y-You do have to feel for the Cubans\nMarch 10, 2001\nwho were displaced by Castro. Certainly some of the things that happened to them\nwere totally unfair to them. So all those \u2014 all those things and how I feel about them\ncame about by what happened in my lifetime.",
        "Q: When you were young, you \u2014 you had some experiences where you, you know,\nsaw th \u2014 you saw parades or you saw symbols that were very repugnant to you. Is\nthere anything today that triggers that in you? Any sights, or any sounds that you\nsometimes hear flash back to your very early childhood?",
        "A: I think them \u2014 that kind of militarism, certainly it exists. It existed in Russia under\nthe communist regime. It probably exists in North Korea today, etcetera. But it \u2014 it\nexisted in Germany in a very, very special way, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2014 1-it\u2019s exactly\nthe same thing. The Germans made a specialty of it, and they did so historically for\nmany, many, many years. I mean, you go back to Bismarck and even back further,\nthe \u2014 the Prussians and their \u2014 y-you can go back to \u2014 to Middle Ages and the \u2014 the\nGermans and their \u2014 their mythology of \u2014 was always the \u2014 the hero worship and the\nloyalty to \u2014 to anything but \u2014 but a democratic society. They just didn\u2019t have that in\nthem, they were \u2014 th-they \u2014 they were st \u2014 they were the strong, the \u2014 the people\nmade of steel, the ones who would show the rest of the world exactly how \u2014 how it\nwould operate and I don\u2019t know whether it was \u2014 1-it sort of looked Wagnerian. I\u2019m\nsure it is in many ways. German philosophy is replete with this sort of thing, of \u2014 of\nthe super race, which 1s what Hitler really played on. I don\u2019t see that elsewhere in the\nMarch 10, 2001\nworld, I am not seeing it elsewhere in the world. Sure, people think we\u2019re better than\nyou are. There\u2019s a group in the \u2014 in Africa, when one ethnic group tries to annihilate\nanother, sure they think they\u2019re better than they are, but they don\u2019t try to set\nthemselves up as a super race, as somebody that could dominate the world, and the\nGermans always managed to do that, or they have in the last 150 years anyway. Or\nmaybe not so right now, but they did before that. And so this militarism that I saw\nthere and experienced there, I think is unique, or was, at least in my view, was unique\nto Germany.",
        "Q: When your children were growing up, and they were five, six, seven, eight, when\nthey were the age that you were when you had to leave, di \u2014 was that a difficult time\nfor you? Did it bring back those times?",
        "A: No, no. Never thought about it. Never, never thought about it. We\u2019ve told our\nchildren what I experienced, but I think it was very, very far removed from their\nlives. Now \u2014",
        "Q: Was your first wife born in America?",
        "A: Yes, she was. Nancy has talked at great length to my mother, and they were very\nclose. So she has had the opportunity to experience first hand from her, at least, or\nlet\u2019s say secondhand, what transpired, and I think it has affected her. Also, her life in\nIsrael, she has certainly come across many, many people who experienced much\nmore traumatic events than I did, and whether they were all relayed to her, or\nMarch 10, 2001\nwhether she learned anything from them, I don\u2019t know, but the opportunity certainly\nwas there for her to do so. My son I don\u2019t think really thinks about it. He knows that\nhis grandparents came from Germany, that they left on Kristallnacht and that they\nhad to get out and that many of the family was caught up in the Holocaust and lost\ntheir lives. But I\u2019ve never questioned him about it, how he things about it, and maybe\nI should, but maybe it\u2019s a failure of parenting on my part, that this is not such an\nimportant thing in his life or such an important thing in the grandchildren\u2019s lives. I\u2019d\nlike to make it that way but I\u2019m not sure that you can. I really don\u2019t think you can. I\nthink there has to be a \u2014 an interest and if that interest is spawned at some stage or\nanother by them, by their education or by what they experience, then it may be\nmeaningful and then they\u2019Il come and ask. One would hope they would, and I\u2019d be\nprepared, of course to discuss it with them in any way they wished. But I\u2019m not sure\nthat that will ever happen. It\u2019s not likely.",
        "Q: D-Do you feel German in any way now?",
        "A: Not at all. Not at all. I grew up in America. My \u2014 I feel as American as anybody\nwho has been born here. I don\u2019t feel German. People ask me where I\u2019m from, I\u2019m\nmore likely to say that I grew up in Forest Hills, I\u2019m not likely to say that \u2019'm from\nGermany. Sometimes when I\u2019m abroad and people ask me where I\u2019m from, I ee \u2014 I \u2014\nI might say that. I don\u2019t know why, I guess maybe it might impress the people that\nI\u2019m talking to, so it depends who the audience 1s and what I choose to let them know,\nMarch 10, 2001\nor if I feel it might make an impression, but 1t seldom makes an impression. I think\nthey are much more likely and \u2014 to look at America the way I did when I was a\nyoungster, and they idolize it. It\u2019s a culture that has, the American culture has \u2014 has\ngone all over the world, much, much more so than it was when I was in Germany. So\nwe Americanized the world. Well, that\u2019s a good thing.",
        "Q: Are you angry that you had to go through what you did as a very young child\nbecause you were Jewish and that you lost all these relatives because they were\nJewish and there\u2019re other people who didn\u2019t have to do that, people in America your\nage, who were born in America. You angry about that?",
        "A: I don\u2019t harbor any anger at all in that respect, no. I understand that people go\nthrough \u2014 have different experiences. There are many Americans who have gone\nthrough very traumatic experiences of their own. May not be of the s-same nature,\nbut certainly they \u2014 not everybody lives an I \u2014 an idealistic life, they have their own \u2014\nthey have problems, etcetera, and they \u2014 they\u2019re very meaning \u2014 meaningful in their\nlives, just like my adventures in Germany, and my leaving was very meaningful in\nmine. So, do I have an a \u2014 do I have anger? No, none \u2014 none whatsoever, none, none.\nThe only anger that I harbor are those people who deny that it ever happened. And\nthose who by their ignorance want to propagate that sort of thinking. The Fascist\ngroups that arise, the intolerance that you sometimes see in people, that angers me.\nBut I think it angers many Americans, not just those who left Germany.\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Were you in any way active in the Civil Rights movement here in the\n60\u2019s and 70\u2019s?",
        "A: No, no, I didn\u2019t participate in any active fashion there. We saw what was\nhappening, of course, and I think we rooted for the right side, but aside from a\nrooting interest and a \u2014 a-and looking at some of the things that were going on and\nabhorring it, the \u2014 the \u2014 the standoff at the colleges and etcetera. These were \u2014 that it\nwas happening was probably very good for America, that it \u2014 that all this existed, that\nthat kind of discrimination existed here was not a surprise to me because I had known\nit existed, and here a country was going through it and was purging itself of it,\nhopefully. You see, I think the difference between American society and German\nsociety is that in Germany under Hitler, institutionalized discrimination and hate and\nmade it a government policy. I don\u2019t think that can happen here, not under our\nConstitution and under our laws. And not only can\u2019t it happen here, the country was\nfounded on the basis of exactly not allowing that sort of thing. The Constitution was\nwritten with this in mind, by people who were very farsighted, many years ago. This\nwasn\u2019t the case in Germany. So there\u2019s a tremendous difference here, there and \u2014 no.\nI don\u2019t \u2014 I really don\u2019t think that there 1s a parallel to be drawn between what has\nhappened here in the Civil Rights movement to what happened in Germany, there is\nno parallel.",
        "Q: What are your feelings about the state of Israel?\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m a Jew. I believe that the state of Israel was a \u2014 was heaven sent for the\nJews all over the world. I\u2019m fully in support of a Jewish nationality and a state,\ntotally. I don\u2019t like what I see is happening. We can\u2019t make peace with our neighbors\nin the Middle East, which is a sad, sad state of affairs. I\u2019m concerned that there will\nnever be peace in the Middle East. There are just too many hatreds dating back too\nmany years that these things cannot be forgotten by the people who are involved in it,\nfor them. For the Palestinians, this is their Holocaust. May not be of the same\nmagnitude, but it\u2019s not any easier for them. And I don\u2019t think that the state of Israel\nhas done what it can to relieve that. I think they can do more. Now, whether the\nArabs will allow them, you know, these are the questions that are tearing at\neverybody today. You know, we can blame each other back and forth for a thousand\nthings and find all kinds of excuses why it isn\u2019t done, but some \u2014 somewhere,\nsomebody has to sit down with somebody in th other side and they have to talk sense\nto each other. And will that ever happen? I don\u2019t know. I sure hope it will and I\u2019m an\noptimist and I think eventually it may. Maybe not in our lifetime, but hopefully it\nwill, although, as I said before, I\u2019m an optimist there, but I\u2019m a pessimist as to\nwhether it\u2019ll ever happen.",
        "Q: What were your thoughts during the Eichmann trial?",
        "A: About what?",
        "Q: During \u2014 during the Eichmann trial.\n100March 10, 2001",
        "A: I think these people epitomized the hateful Germans. Eichmann was a \u2014 a\nmurderer. So were so many others, so many who escaped to Argentina and lived their\nlives out in luxury in the \u2014 in the \u2014 the resort towns of Bariloche and in Montevideo\nand places like that. I am sorry that we couldn\u2019t put them all on trial the way we did\nEichmann. And do I resent those people? Yes, I do. I\u2019m sorry we can\u2019t put them all to\ndeath, even today. And if we find them, we should shame them in every way we\npossibly can, no matter how old they are. They murdered a \u2014 a whole people.\nGenocide. I have no patience for that. And if I harbor hate, it\u2019s against people like\nthat. People like Milosevic too, who was just a incarnation of a \u2014 of \u2014 of these types.\nThey should be put on trial as quickly as we can get our hands on them. Now whether\nthe world as a community can do that, who knows?",
        "Q: Do you feel that you lost any part of your childhood, you were so young when you\nhad to leave?",
        "A: Honestly no. My childhood from my \u2014 from my formative years was spent here in\nAmerica and didn\u2019t lose any of it. I was a happy child. I was \u2014 my family made sure\nthat I was secure, despite the fact of what we were living through. And despite the\nfact what I observed, I never, never felt a personal threat. So no, I didn't miss\nanything in my childhood.",
        "Q: Before we conclude, is there any message you want to give to your grandchildren\non the tape? Anything you want to say?\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: Yes. It would be wonderful if all, or even any one of them took an interest in those\nyears, those very important years. Ill speak directly to them, you certainly came\nfrom at least one parent who lived through history. And it behooves you to know a\nlittle bit about your background and where you came from and why you are here at\nall, cause at any time in those early years, when I was younger than you are now \u2014 or\nmaybe not, maybe some of you are just about the age that I am now \u2014 that I was then,\nanything could have happened that it would have made life very, very different, it\nwould have \u2014 you would never have been born if it weren\u2019t for the fact that your\ngreat-grandfather had the foresight to find his \u2014 and the struggle and the ability to\nfind his way out of Germany. And there\u2019s another thing I think that you should\nremember. What happened then was the act of a government in concert with its\npeople. You have an obligation to look, and to take part and to observe your\ngovernment in action, to be certain that something like this can never happen where\nyou live. You have that obligation and you must use whatever effort you have, or\nwhatever influence you have to see to it that justice for all 1s a part of your life and is\na part of the national life wherever you may be living at. So do that.",
        "Q: Well that\u2019s a wonderful note to end on unless there\u2019s anything else you wanted to\nsay before we finish.",
        "A: No, I think you \u2014 you well covered everything. Yes, there is one other thing I have\nto say. I said we stayed at the Whitehall Hotel in London, it was not the Whitehall, it\n102March 10, 2001\nwas the Cumberland Hotel on Speaker\u2019s corner and the Hyde Park corner. And that\u2019s\nimportant, I don\u2019t like to make mistakes.",

How \u2014 how far back, I think probably\nsomewhere in the 1700\u2019s is how far we\u2019ve been able to trace them.

My maternal grandparents had died long, long before I was\nborn, and the only member of that family that I remember was my mother\u2019s sister,\nwho was about 10 years older than she was. She lived in Berlin at the time and we\nwent to visit them, but only once and I remember that visit very well, I was quite\nyoung, must have been, oh perhaps four years old or five years old at the oldest and it\nwas an interesting visit because as youngsters the two of us was very \u2014 were very\nexcited to go to Berlin. We went there and when we walked to the house they had a\nlittle dog, and it was a Spitz, I think, terrier. And you opened the dog and the \u2014 door\nand the dog jumped up on us and we were frightened to death, a fear that I had until I\ngot my own dogs some many years later.

        "A: That\u2019s an interesting question. As far as I know, we were secular. My \u2014 my\ngrandparents, my grandfather was not terribly religious, but my grandmother was,\nshe was quite observant. My aunt, my father\u2019s sister, her name was Selma, was also, I\nthink, religious. She \u2014 she was a spinster and lived with my gran \u2014 my father\u2019s\nparents. My \u2014 my mother kept a kosher home and as they have told me that during\nthe Hitler years they became more involved with religion than they had been before\nbecause they were s \u2014 ostracized by the German community and therefore drew\ncloser to the Jewish community and there was sort of a \u2014 a renaissance of religion\nduring that period of time amongst Jews and they were a part of that. Were they \u2014\nand my mother would not have kept a kosher home if it weren\u2019t for my grandparents.\nShe did that for them and for \u2014 for my father and then of course, we were brought up\nin that fashion until we came to the United States much later, which time all that was\n\u2014 well, I wouldn\u2019t say all of that was dropped, I think for a few \u2014 a few years here I\nhad religious education, and then we sort of drifted away from the formality of\nreligion, and religion not a terribly important thing in our lives.",
        "A: Oh yes, I remember very vividly going to temple on Simchas Torah, and the\ntemple is Conservative Orthodox, you know, where of course, the women sat upstairs\nin the balcony and the men were worshipping downstairs and as children we were\nwith the men, as boys. And I remember that holiday so well because during the\nservice, the mothers would throw candy down from the balcony, and my brother and\nI did everything we could to gather up as much of it as we could. It was a delight, and\nI remember it very fondly.",
        "A: Yes, we observed Shabbat and it was a kosher f \u2014 kosher house, and certainly\nobserved the Passover. And for any child, of course, Hanukkah was the m \u2014 was a\nmajor holiday and that was always celebrated. And one of the things that I do also\nremember, going to my grandparents\u2019 home, they lived in a \u2014 what I could best\ndescribe as a \u2014 looked like a browns \u2014 what a brownstone would look like today.\nThey lived on the lower floors and there was a yard in the back, rectangular yard. It\nwas walled in on three sides, but at the house. And in that little yard, which was just\ndelightful, there was a \u2014 always a sukkah. So on the holiday of Sukkos we would go\nthere and I would marvel at all the interesting things that were hung from the sukkah\nand the \u2014 and then we went to temple from there, and so those were my recollections\nreally, of the holidays.\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: I would say 1-it -- where we lived it was mixed, very, very much so mixed. My\ngrandparents \u2014 Deutz was the \u2014 where they lived was a \u2014 for I guess going back\nmany hundreds of years must have been kind of a ghetto for Jews, a Jewish \u2014a\nJewish area. I -- I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a ghetto in the common sense today, but 1t was an\narea that was populated mostly by Jews, and the synagogue with \u2014 the Cologne\nsynagogue was there, the \u2014 one of the major ones was right in that area, very near by.\nSo they were more \u2014 in a\u2014 in a more Jewish area and my parents and we lived in \u2014 in\na more modern area of \u2014 of Cologne.",
        "A: I remember it very well, 1t \u2014 the name of the street was the univeri(ph) \u2014\nUniversitat strasse, University street. And we had an apartment on either the first or\nsecond floor, I don\u2019t quite recall whether 1\u2014 whether it was right on \u2014 no, it was on\nthe ground floor, I\u2019m sure of that. And across the street was a very large park, and \u2014\nwhich was very interesting for my brother and I. We would look out of the window\non \u2014 particularly on weekends and all kinds of interesting things happened. Hot air\nballoons would be \u2014 would be launched from there, and of course there were a\nmultitude of parades, with military music and the \u2014 and the Nazi youth and all of that,\nwhich was for a child at least, an eye opener, interesting to see. We never really were\nMarch 10, 2001\na part of that, as you would understand, but we could see it all going on. It was quite\ncolorful, and \u2014 and interesting.",
        "A: Well, we were pretty well indoctrinated as to what the Nazis were doing. Our\nparents did not keep any secrets from us. And we were \u2014 it was there, we felt totally\napart from it. We felt as though we were not welcome to join it. This was for\nGermans and that Jews were not welcome in these \u2014 in these circles, or at least in this\ncrowd. And although we looked on it with interest, and possibly as a child with\nlonging to be a part of something, we knew that it was beyond us to be able to be a\npart of it. Just wasn\u2019t possible, and did we feel ostracized by it? I don\u2019t think so, not\nin that way. I think my feelings were that it would be nice if we could be a part of all\nof this, but no, it was \u2014 it was not \u2014 it was not to be and there was too much fear\nattendant to trying to be a part of that. We knew we wouldn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: We knew we wouldn\u2019t be welcome.",
        "A: Well, we had any number of personalized experiences in that \u2014 this was a time\nwhen we started school, and we were \u2014 we went to a Jewish school, which I think\nMarch 10, 2001\nwa-was already at that time forbidden for Jews to go to the public schools or to the \u2014\nto other schools, we had to be in separate schools. And in those schools, walking\nhome from school, we were often chased by Nazi youth. We made it our business to\nstay out of their way as much as we could because we knew that they would taunt us\nas we went from school back to home. But it didn\u2019t happen all that frequently, just,\nyou know, once \u2014 oh, it\u2019s so difficult for me to remember how often, but it did \u2014 1t \u2014\nall that has to do is happen once and you remember it, as a child. And we did, we just\n\u2014my brother and I learned how to run very fast and we ran. We went \u2014 ran home,\nand that was that, when they bother us.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have a sense of nationality, not at that age. I kn-knew we lived in \u2014 in the\ncountry that we lived in, which was Germany, Deutschland, that was our country, but\nmy association was that we were really not a part of 1t because of our Jewishness. My\nparents I don\u2019t think had that feeling so much. They felt themselves as being German.\nAnd \u2014 but they made it clear to us how unwelcome the Jews were and I \u2014 there were\nother incidents that I can relate to you where I was \u2014 where I recall how they tried to\nd\u2014to keep Jews out. So, did I feel German? I knew I was there, I had no sense of\nnationality, I was perhaps too young to have that sense of nationality. I do know that\nI was very much interested in geography. My parents spoke often of America and\nMarch 10, 2001\nthat was very interesting for us. You know, where is America and what is happening\nthere, and why is it so great, and \u2014 because they made it sound very, very interesting,\netcetera. And then we learned ab \u2014 all about \u2014 my father was \u2014 tr-traveled a lot. So\nwhen he was abroad and he \u2014 all those years, even during the Nazi period, he was\ntraveling in Great Britain and in Holland and he told us about his trips. And this was\nall very fascinating for us. So, we were in \u2014 I never really had a \u2014 you \u2014 to get back to\nyour original question, I never had a sense of nationality at the time. Fascinating\ninterest with the world and different countries, but no sense of nationalism.",
        "A: We spoke German. That was the only language that we knew. Just to step back,\nwhich gives you an idea of the \u2014 the way I became aware of being a Jew, and how\nunwelcome we really were, not just from what my parents said, but you would go to\nshops or look, and you would see signs in the store windows, Jews\nungerwurnscht(ph), not wanted. And you felt strange going into those shops,\nalthough shopkeepers often didn\u2019t care. They \u2014 they welcomed you because they \u2014\nyou were after all, a client, you were going to spend some money and they would\nhappily sell you things. But the signs, nevertheless were in the windows and in the\ndoors. One in particular I think goes back. We used to go to a beach on the Rhine and\nmy mother took the two of us, Norbert and myself there quite frequently during the\nsummers and we would enjoy bathing in the Rhine. I wanted to learn how to swim.\nMarch 10, 2001\nThe interesting thing is how they taught swimming in those days, they put the student\non a long string attached to its waist and on a pole and just held them there in the\nwater so that they\u2019d learn how to swim. We were too young for that, but we had the\nwish to learn how and be a part of that. Anyway, we\u2019d go to the \u2014 to the beach quite\nfrequently, and it was a lot of fun. Kids love that, and we loved it. Then one day we\nwent and there was a sign, Juden ungerwurnscht(ph) and my mother -- and I s-saw\nthe sign and my mother pointed it out to us and she went to the proprietor of that\nbeach and se \u2014 and said, what does this mean? I mean, we\u2019ve been coming here for\nyears. Oh, oh, no, it \u2014 she said, this doesn\u2019t apply to you, you can \u2014 you can come,\nbut you know, we have to have these signs. So although we \u2014 we went, the comfort\nlevel of going there suddenly went down several s \u2014 degrees \u2014 more than several\ndegrees, quite a lot and we learned at a young age that we were somehow different,\nthat because we were Jews, we were not part of the general public in \u2014 in Germany.\nWe learned it also when we took trips with my parents on weekends to go to \u2014 th-the\nRhineland has got many, many interesting historical sites and castles etcetera, which\nchildren love to see, and we would go there and often there would be the sign, no\nJews allowed. We sometimes ignored those signs and sometimes it was a little too\nuncomfortable and we just went \u2014 did not go there, or my parents chose not to go\nthere. Perhaps they knew where they were serious about not having Jews and where\nthey weren\u2019t. The Rhineland overall was not \u2014 I don\u2019t think the people in the\nMarch 10, 2001\nRhineland were all that much in love with the Hitler era, that administration, and\nmany of them did not agree with what was going on. But nevertheless, they had to\nlive their lives and they did what they were told, as all good Germans did in those\ndays, but still found ways to tolerate the Jews who lived amongst them. Except for a\nfew. Obviously there were always those who were rabid Nazis and who you had to\nstay out of their way of and \u2014 and for me as a child, particularly the \u2014 the youngsters\nwho were part of the Hitler youth, who m-made it their business if they did s-see\nJews to at least taunt them, if not physically assault them. I don\u2019t remember ever\nbeing physically assaulted, but we did lead fairly normal lives as children, aside from\nthis discrimination. My brother and I used to \u2014 we found our way to the circus once.\nWhen we were supposed to be coming home from school we got on a train and we\nwanted the circus so badly we hopped aboard a streetcar and went out to the circus.\nAnd of course my mother was beside herself, why didn't the boys come home? But\nthose are the kinds of events I think that most children do. You could do this and\nthere was no fear that somebody would harm you and take you away or steal you, or\nwhat have you. You could \u2014 we \u2014 we felt no danger in doing those things. Perhaps\nmy parents were concerned, but my brother and I were not. Then of course, things\ngot a little bit more dicey and \u2014\nMarch 10, 2001\nindependent child there. W-Were you, or were you different from your brother, or\nhow would you characterize each of you?",
        "A: Well we were \u2014 we were close as youngsters, so we did everything together and\nwhen we had a desire to do something, at least we had somebody to do it with. So,\nwe were adventuresome. I don\u2019t think that we were abnormally risqu\u00e9. We did the\nthings we wanted to, but we also hewed to being home and \u2014 and doing our studies\nand listening to the things that we needed to, listen to our parents, and when they said\nja\u2014 do your homework, we did our homework and all those things. So we were not\nwild, as such, but we had our moments when we wanted to go out and have some\nfun, and we did.",
        "A: N-Not at that age, we were too young. Athletics didn\u2019t mean very much at age six,\nseven, or five. Four, five, six, seven. [inaudible]",
        "A: No, no, no, by no means. I think we were rather normal in many ways. One of the\nthings that I remember those \u2014 those years, was that it was always difficult for my\nparents to get all the things they needed in the store. Things were in short supply,\nparticularly things like milk, eggs, all kinds of foodstuffs. Germany was not well\nsupplied in those things and there were always shortages and of course we depended\non the goodwill of the Christian shopkeepers, or the German shopkeepers and they \u2014\nMarch 10, 2001\nas I said before, there were always those who made it their business to help out and\nwe found that \u2014 my mother always found means to bring in what we needed to\nsubsist on and all \u2014 often \u2014 I-I don\u2019t remember us starving, I don\u2019t remember us\nhaving any difficulty in \u2014 in getting the things, the substance that we need \u2014 the\nsubsistence things that we needed. I do know, I remember my mother talking about\nhow har -- difficult it was to get these things, and there was one event that I guess\nepitomizes, that we went \u2014 we were going to go to my grandparents in Deutz and we\n\u2014my father loaded us in the car and he had gotten \u2014 apparently in \u2014 in Deutz my\ngrandparents couldn\u2019t get all the food that they wanted and he had gotten some fresh\neggs, which were also in very short supply, he got them in our area, or through his\nfriends there. And we had set off and shortly, I think, before or after we got to the\nbridge that goes across the Rhine to Deutz, a \u2014 another car sides \u2014 hit us from the\nside. It was a major blow and I wound up with a cut on my leg and wound up in the\nhospital, my mother wound up in the hospital with a cut on her scalp. And the only\nones who really got free from it \u2014 Norbert also wound up with something, but not\nvery much. My father was not injured. But during the time, he was so concerned \u2014\nyou know how nervous one gets when something like that happens, his first thought\nwas oh my gosh, the eggs. And he picked them up and he put them in his pocket.\nAnd of course they were all smashed in his pocket. But that gives you the idea of\nhow scarce these foodstuffs were, that he would think of that in a m \u2014 in a moment of\nMarch 10, 2001\npanic or trauma, to save those eggs to get them to the grandparents, which was the\nimportant thing. And we wound up in the hospital at that time, 1n a Catholic hospital,\nand it was Passover, and I remember the \u2014 the nuns in white habit and also in black\nhabit coming, taking care of us and they were very, very nice, we had a doctor, an-\nand I needed some stitches in my leg and it was all done. When they brought up the\nfood, of course, it \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to eat it. It was Passover, we were taught that\nPassover has to be kosher and it has to be matzoh etcetera, so I s \u2014 spoke up and I\nsaid that to the nuns, and they understood it completely and took care of us and\nbrought us what we \u2014 what we would need for that. I do think that the religious\ninstitutions, the hospitals, the Catholic church recognized, at least from that\nexperience, recognized more that there were customs that other \u2014 others hewed to,\nand they respected that. I think they respected any type of religion, as long as it was\nreligion. And so I\u2019ve \u2014 I did not feel that we were badly cared for because we were\nJews, it was \u2014 certainly didn -- didn\u2019t have that feeling at that time.",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 it means that you are somehow an underclass. You are not part of\nsociety as a whole, you are not seen as everybody else. You ask yourself the question\nwhy, but there\u2019s no answer. And you ask your parents, and the parents say your \u2014\nyou\u2019re Jewish. They explain to you a little bit of the history and of the pogroms and\nMarch 10, 2001\nof the many things that Jews have been \u2014 how \u2014 how often they\u2019ve been the \u2014 the\nobject of a pogrom or of discrimination everywhere, and that was in Germany. You\nknow, there was a \u2014 there was always an undercurrent of anti-Semitism in Germany,\nthat predated Hitler. So \u2014 and as a \u2014 as a Jew, you \u2014 what is \u2014 a Jewish child, you\nwere made aware of that when you were very young. I\u2019d like to compare it today, for\ninstance in United States where you have, if you were a black, you would know from\nwhen you were very young, that you are different than the white community, and\nyour parents would tell you about the discrimination, the things they went through.\nThis is the way we were. We knew this when we were young, and so when we saw\nthe signs on the wall, it was just an affirmation of exactly what we already knew or\nwhat our parents had already told us. They certainly didn\u2019t hide it.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: We-y-yes. We certainly were different and we knew also, during those Hitler\nyears that times were changing. We knew that laws or regulations had been enacted,\nor had been promulgated, and \u2014\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: My parents told us. They were very open. We had a household that was \u2014 they\nkept nothing from us. They assured us of our security and we relied on them for that,\nand believed that, but they also told us what was happening. They told us of many of\nthe people who had been persecuted who were Jews, who \u2014 and there was a lot of\npersecution, there were people who lost their jobs because they couldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t\nwork any longer. Jews were not allowed to have Gentile maids in their homes. All\nthese things happened and we were \u2014 we either saw it and we were \u2014 or they were \u2014\nwe were told about those things. And I remember as a youngster my father kept a\nrevolver. And of course this was very exciting for two young boys, we always\nwanted to see the revolver, and my father showed it to us but he never let us touch it,\nwhich was terrible, we wanted to get our hands on it. But one day we took our car\nand we were visiting our grandparents across the Rhine and my father took that\nrevolver with him and he stopped in the middle of the bridge on the Rhine river. And\nhe took it apart and he started throwing pieces of the gun into the Rhine, one after\nanother. And of course we were curious, why? And we learned that we were \u2014 Jews\nwere not allowed to have weapons and if we did have weapons there would be dire\nconsequences and he was getting rid of it, and that\u2019s it. He was just \u2014 he was not\ngoing to let the Germans have it, for sure, so into the Rhine river 1t went. And maybe\nthat was one less gun that was used 1n the war, who knows. So we \u2014 we knew, and\nMarch 10, 2001\nwe grew up with that, and we went \u2014 and when we went to school we \u2014 we knew we\nwere in a Jewish school, we knew we had friends, obviously, in the Jewish school. In\n1937 - 1938, things got really \u2014 they escalated, they \u2014 the Germans \u2014 the \u2014 the rules\nand the many laws they put forth against the Jews affected us more and more. My\nfather\u2019s company was taken over. It was a Jewish company to begin with,\nLisauer\u2019s(ph), and they \u2014 the Germans appointed a \u2014 a Aryan company to take it\nover. And the Jews could continue to work there to show them how to operate it. And\nmy father, that\u2019s where my father\u2019s employment was, so he continued to work there.\nBut obviously all opportunity for advancement etcetera was gone. And we knew that\ntoo. Then \u2014 it was at that \u2014 during that period of time that my parents said, you know,\nwe can\u2019t continue to live here. Perhaps even earlier. And they started to inquire about\nhow they could get out of Germany. It was very difficult. The quota for America was\ncompletely full, it was years to wait to get \u2014 to get to America, but fortunately my\nfather had connections through his business, in England and in Holland. Particularly\nin Holland he had good friends, we did a lot of business. And so he started making\narrangements to get permission to work and live in Holland, while he was still\nemployed in Germany. We started hearing about concentration camps about that time\nand we knew people who were either living in the neighborhood, or \u2014 or who had\ncome recently from Poland where they had sought refuge in Germany, that the\nGestapo came and picked them up and sent them back. And where were they going?\nMarch 10, 2001\nThey were going to concentration camps. Everybody knew there were concentration\ncamps. Certainly all the Jews knew. What happened there that time, we didn\u2019t know.\nThey were just taken away. And this was kind of a frightening scenario. My parents,\nwho \u2014 I \u2014I\u2014I guess most German Jews who had lived there fo-for many, many\nyears did not fear that they would be taken away one day. It was mostly \u2014 at that\ntime, mostly the immigrants that came into Germany from the east, from \u2014\nprincipally from Poland who were the subject of this. They didn\u2019t \u2014 the Germans just\npicked them up, put them on a train, sent them out. And one day I was in school and\nit really brought it home to me. We were in the middle of a class, and suddenly some\nmen walked into the classroom, and they started calling out names of our fellow\nstudents, and they said come with us, and took them out. And my brother and I, when\nwe got home that day, we asked our parents, this and this 1s what happened. What\nhappened? And they explained it to us. These were the sons of Polish parents who\nhad settled there and sent their kids to the Jewish school where we were and they had\nbeen called by the Gestapo and they had a few hours to get their things and their\nchildren together because they were being transported out. This was frightening for a\nchild, you know, to know that you could be in a class, that somebody could come in\nand order you out, and with your parents you\u2019re going somewhere else. You\u2019re going\nout to some \u2014 someplace, and of course we knew then that they were going to\nconcentration camps, or \u2014\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: My \u2014 my parents knew, I knew it from my parents. And they \u2014 they had heard of,\nor known, I think, friends and acquaintances who had gone, some of them had been\nreleased and \u2014 at one period or another and they told of the ones that had not been\nreleased that had been sent to various camps. So we knew there were concentration\ncamps. How? I only knew it from my parents.",
        "A: No, it really wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t remember having school friends at my house, for\ninstance, or me being at another student\u2019s home. We had recess and we played in the\nschoolyard together and there we had ballgames and all kinds of things that kids do\nin the \u2014 during recess, but when we went home, we went home and we had our life\nwith our family only. We did not have school friends and schoolmates whom we\nplayed with, not at that age.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t recall \u2014 I don\u2019t recall that. I \u2014 our time was taken up in going to\nschool, coming back, being with our parents, going with our parents to see our\ngrandparents, going on excursions during weekends, that kind of thing, and I don\u2019t\nMarch 10, 2001\nrecall having any other friends in \u2014 neighborhood friends that we played with or that\nwe saw.",
        "A: No, we were not afraid of them. We were not afraid of our neighbors. We had\nsome very nice neighbors, I know my parents spoke to the people who lived across\nthe hall and as a matter of fact \u2014 I know for a fact that one of the \u2014 that family lived\nacross the hall, the man was a member of the SA, but he was quite nice. He always\nmade it his business to \u2014 he \u2014 he ran a grocery store or a butcher shop, I\u2019m not sure\nwhich, and when he had something that he could bring, he brought it, gave it to us.\nSo they lived \u2014 these Germans lived two lives. They lived one life in which they paid\nhomage to the Nazi party and everything and the trappings that went with that and\nthey heard the stories about how evil Jews were, and yet they could live across the\nhall from a family of Jews and still find them as decent and honest individuals and\nwork with them. That\u2019s the strange part. And \u2014 that these people could have\npromulgated what they did to the Jews and be a part of that is a \u2014 something that will\nalways be a mystery. Oh, I have lots of theories on that. [inaudible]",
        "A: Right.\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: Well, we saw Hitler in the way that our parents saw him and our grandparents saw\nhim and their friends, and he was the object of ridicule in the Jewish community. As\nthis \u2014 so we \u2014 we had zero respect for Adolf Hitler. He was a menace, I think, for all\nof us in the Jewish community and our parents and our friends. And I had no other\nthoughts, but you know, Adolf Hitler was not the \u2014 we \u2014 we knew that was somebody\nwe should not like, and as a six or seven year old, that was about tt.",
        "A: No, none. None whatsoever. What scared us perhaps was the \u2014 th-the police,\ncause they were so unmoving and so \u2014 they had their \u2014 now, how can I describe them\nbest? Autocratic. There was no appealing to them, you know, you \u2014 you \u2014 and in\nGermany, if some -- if a police officer or \u2014 or a [indecipherable] told you something,\nyou did it. There was no appeal from it, it was a person to be feared. And Hitler was\njust the head of this whole establishment, created these people. Now, police were\nnever the kind of people that I could warm up to, and perhaps it comes from those\ndays in Germany. The authority figure \u2014 you know, if you feel that you\u2019re doing\neverything right and you\u2019re suddenly faced with a -- a policeman who\u2019s telling you,\nor giving you authority, you \u2014 th \u2014 there\u2019s always that apprehension, what 1s it that I\nMarch 10, 2001\ndid wrong? And if I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, why 1s he standing here, you know?\nWhy is he poking his nose into my business? And that was pretty much it, we stayed\naway from the police.",
        "A: No, I did not. I don\u2019t recall seeing anything like that, except for when \u2014 well, now,\neven when they took the children out of school, they didn\u2019t forcibly tear them apart\nor what have you. I -- my first contact with that sort of thing where there was an\nassault on property or individuals was the night that we left Germany.",
        "A: My mother was an very arch Zionist, she wanted very much to go pa \u2014 to\nPalestine. My father was not so much a Zionist. I think there was a period of time\nwhen they would have \u2014 they were looking to get out of Germany because they knew\nthat this was not a place for Jews to be living. But their ties to Germany were so\nstrong and so deep and so ancient that they could not \u2014 I don\u2019t think any \u2014 any of\nthem could believe that th \u2014 it would lead to a matter of life and death. And as long as\nthey could earn a living, this might blow over. After all, knowledge of assaults on\nJews and pogroms had been common knowledge throughout history and this was just\nanother period that they were going through. But as things got worse and worse, they\nMarch 10, 2001\nrecognized they ought to get out. And then the search started, how do \u2014 how do we\nget out. And I know my parents tried to get out to any number of places, South\nAmerica, America, even to Africa. I think they tried to go to Rhodesia once, but that\ndidn't work either.",
        "A: We knew they were \u2014 sorry. We knew that they were searching. And my interest\nin geography I think may have arisen from that search. I don\u2019t remember specifically\nhow but I do know that they were not happy. We spent time in Holland and of course\nthat\u2019s where we escaped to, really, was to Holland.",
        "A: And that\u2019s a different story. But that\u2019s generally what my life was like as a\nyoungster.",
        "A: Well, it was a sign of the authority, the German authority, and did it evoke any\nfeelings at that time? I don\u2019t think so, not at that time. That came a little later, when\npeople started wearing the armband. Then you would sense that they were part of the\ncrowd that really hated Jews and made you feel uncomfortable, didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t\nwant anything to do with you, they didn't want you to be part of their lives and so it\nwas a sign that these were \u2014 these were anti-Semites. I guess in our own way we\nMarch 10, 2001\nknew that the minute we saw that armband it was \u2014 they were part of that authority in\nGermany that we feared. Some time in 1937 \u2014 1938 it became absolutely clear to my\nfather that they had to get out. And my parents, because of his contacts in Holland,\nmade arrangements to seek permission to work in Holland. And since his company\nhad an office in Amsterdam and he had friends, his business acquaintances were very\nclose friends in Amsterdam, that was a logical place to go. So they \u2014 my father had a\n\u2014a-\u2014he\u2019s told me these stories. His company was involved in international trading,\nand as such, they had special permission from the Reichsbank to travel and to make\ndeals in \u2014 abroad. And my father, being a young man at the \u2014 at that time was the one\nwho was assigned that task, to go to Holland and to England, etcetera. And he used\nthis permission, which was in letter form, to travel rather freely. And he would use\nthat for \u2014 to gain permission to enter the -- England or Holland, etcetera. So while he\nwas over there working, he made arrangements to obtain the permission to work in\nHolland, which he did. And when he came back they \u2014 and made the final decision\nthat their \u2014 they were leaving, they said well, we have to go to Holland. We have to\nfind a place to live. We have to see what\u2019s going on, let\u2019s take a month or so. We\u2019re\ngoing to go and we\u2019re going to make these arrangements, then we\u2019ll come back and\nwrap up everything we have and bring it to Holland. So in the summer of ni \u2014 of\n1938, we went by car and my father had his papers with him, so we got \u2014 arrived at\nthe Dutch border and we were stopped. Now, do you have anything to declare, this ca\nMarch 10, 2001\n\u2014 you know, at the German side. And the Dutch side was \u2014 they were standing, they\nwere wide open, no problem over there, but \u2014 and my father said no, we don\u2019t have\nanything to declare and they said, how about the boys? Why are you leaving? And\nmy father said to them, well, you know, they -- we have polio in \u2014 in Cologne. And\nit\u2019s the summer, we want our children to be safe from that, we \u2014 oh, so you have\npolio in Cologne? Well, that means your children were going to have to get a health\ncertificate, because we can\u2019t let you go across the border. Obviously we can\u2019t allow\npolio to spread. Course they knew we were Jewish \u2014 Jews, the passports had all been\nstamped with a J, so they knew. And my father said well, how do I get these\npermissions to get across to Holland, th-the health certificate? They said oh, you\ncan\u2019t get them, you might just as well go back. And he said no, how can we \u2014 then he\ninsisted. He said, well you have to see the [indecipherable] I guess, the county\nexecutive or whatever in that area and he can do it. Well, where can I find him? And\nhe said well, he\u2019s in such and such a town, whatever. And my father took off to get\nthat. In the meantime we stayed there at the border with my mother and they tore our\ncar apart. Literally went through everything to see whether we had anything at all.\nAnd as my mother tells 1t, we had \u2014 we had gotten some gifts from some friends or\nrelatives in Switzerland, the coats and hats and my Aunt Selma had put some\nperfume in the hatband, and they found that, of course, and confiscated it, which\nmade Norbert and I very upset that they would take that away from us. And my\nMarch 10, 2001\nmother said, don\u2019t you worry about it, whatever it is, we can replace it. Let them have\nit. And we waited for my father to come back. Well, as the story goes, my father told\nme, he said he went to see him and he was occupied somewhere and insisted he go in\nand see this county executive, and he walked into his office, and he gave him a quick\nheil Hitler. And he said, why can\u2019t I go across the border, I have my children, they\nhave \u2014 we have polio in \u2014 in Cologne and they insist on having the certificate. And so\nthe fellow said well, you know, if you don\u2019t mind, you know, they \u2014 they have polio\nhere in Holland. If you don\u2019t object to your children being exposed to that, then why\nshould we, and he signed it, gave it to him. So he came back to the border and there\nwe were, everything had been stripped and taken and it was quite late by then. And\nthe \u2014 the Germans were furious, of course, that he had come up with the certificate,\nthey didn\u2019t want him to \u2014 didn\u2019t want to give him that opportunity that \u2014 to leave.\nAnd even though it was very late, the \u2014 and the Dutch border supposedly had closed.\nSo they thought that maybe this was all over, we couldn\u2019t get in any more. And the\nGerman said, okay, you can go, with a smirk on their faces, I guess, knowing that the\nother side was closed. Well, lo and behold, they started drive across and the Dutch\nopened the border and they said, what was going on there? And they said, you know,\nwe seen a lot of this with Jews. We kept the border open for you. So the Dutch were\nextremely decent and wonderful people and we went over and for the next month or\nMarch 10, 2001\nsix weeks we stayed in a \u2014 kind of a resort town on the beach, and \u2014 in Holland.\nSunfort was the name of the reso \u2014 the \u2014 the beach town.",
        "A: Oh, yeah \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember my feelings. I think we trusted our parents explicit \u2014 implicitly\nand had no concern that he wouldn\u2019t come back. We just waited. I had \u2014 honestly I\ndon\u2019t remember. You know, those are things that they leave. I remember \u2014 I\nremember the \u2014 the searching and I remember the fact that they took these silly little\nbottles of perfume, and just waited, and then off we went. And we \u2014 when we were in\nHolland, my pa \u2014 we were at this resort and my parents put Norbert and I into a \u2014 I\nguess best described as a summer camp, my \u2014 which we enjoyed because it was\nbeach, it was the ocean right there and \u2014",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t speak any Dutch. And my parents said \u2014 made certain arrangements,\nthey got whatever necessary arrangements they needed to make in order to \u2014 to make\ntheir final move, and asked our friends to find an apartment for them. And they were\ngoing to go back to Germany and pick up their things and head off. And they said,\nMarch 10, 2001\nyou know boys, I think you should stay here. Because at that time things were really\ngetting bad, it was difficult to get money out of Germany, couldn\u2019t be done any\nlonger. And they didn\u2019t want to put us in harm\u2019s way. But my brother and I became\nabsolutely hysterical. We didn\u2019t want to be separated from our parents, and we raised\nquite a ruckus. So much so that our parents said well, we\u2019ll take you back, we will\nsomehow manage. Something happens to us we\u2019ll all go through it. And we actually\nwent back to Germany.",
        "A: That was, that time seven and a half years old, exactly. So back we went to\nCologne and my parents at that time wrapped up what they could. They sent their\nbookcases and some f-furniture, books mostly because they loved books, they loved\nreading, so this was very important for them that they bring their bookcases with\nthem, and sent them off with the moving van. And my father got tickets for \u2014 no, he\ndidn\u2019t get tickets there, they ... he made whatever final arrangements had to be made\nt-to \u2014 to get out. And when the furniture was moved, happened to be on November\neighth, and out we went, the apartment was empty. So we went over to see \u2014 to \u2014 to\nlive in hotel for one \u2014 for one night because the next day we were taking the train,\nand we were [indecipherable] we were going to Holland. So we went over to the\nDome Hotel, which was right across the street from the cathedral in \u2014 in Cologne.\nAnd the Dome Hotel is situated on one of the main shopping streets in the city of\n29March 10, 2001\nCologne, narrow shopping street. And we went to sleep that night, my brother and I. I\nremember that my parents were there in \u2014 in our room as well and at four o\u2019clock in\nthe morning my brother and I were awakened by my parents.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nMarch 10, 2001\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Right. Well, we were in the Dome Hotel, my brother and I went to sleep. And\nsometime in the middle of the night we were awakened by my mother. And she said\nboys, come here. And we got up and she took us to the window of the hotel and stood\nus between the drapes so that we could look out on the s \u2014 onto the street. And down\nbelow was this noise of shattering glass and \u2014 and we looked down and we saw these\nuniformed individuals, the brown shirts, throwing rocks into the window of the store\nthat was just across the street from the hotel. And there were others inside the store\nthrowing porcelain and glass out on the street, just piling it up, just heaving it out.\nAnd I remember the \u2014 1n the glow of the streetlights, in the yellowish glow of the\nstreetlights and the cobblestone streets and all this stuff just shattering as it hit the\nfloor. And my mother said to me \u2014 sa-said to us, boys, she said, take a look. Never\nforget what you see here. And of course we wanted to know what was happening and\nwe asked what\u2019s happening, and she said, that\u2019s a Jewish store. One of the finest\nstores in crystal and everything and they\u2019re just destroying it. Well, we didn\u2019t know \u2014\nwhat we didn\u2019t know was that not just there, but everywhere, this was going on in\nGermany and this was the night that the synagogues were all burned and the \u2014 what\nMarch 10, 2001\nwe didn\u2019t see, the \u2014 the Jews being rounded up and being ostracized and as they were\ndragged down the streets and all these things. These were things that we learned only\nafterwards. But we did see the carnage that was taking place across the street from\nthis hotel and down this \u2014 this whole street. And in \u2014 it\u2019s something that I don\u2019t think\nI can ever forget, the image of it is so vivid in my mind, the whole thing, it\u2019s \u2014 1t was\nthe first time in all those years that we actually saw violence. We had seen and we\nhad feared all the other things, but this was true violence. And it \u2014 and you know,\nI\u2019ve read a lot about these things since then. The Germans claimed afterwards that it\nwas an uprising on the part of the German people against the Jews. Just remembering\nall those people in uniform, it was no uprising of the people in, I mean it was the \u2014 it\nwas the \u2014 the Hitler youth, the \u2014 the SA, the brown shirts and whoever else wanted to\nparticipate in this, did this. Anyway, in the morning my parents took us to vi \u2014 say\ngoodbye to our grandparents, who were just across the river in Cologne. And the\ngrandparents said, my God are you still here? Get out, get out. And then we learned\nof the carnage that had been happening the rest of the city, and obviously what was\nhappening all over Germany at the time. The synagogue had been burned, the people\nhad been dragged out of their homes and they made fun of them as they \u2014 down the\nstreets and what have you. Elderly people, and \u2014 and they sent us off. They shooed us\nout, but quickly, and said get out. And so my parents went directly to the train station\nfrom there and we got on the train to go to Holland. There were a lot of other Jews on\nMarch 10, 2001\nthe train. Many of them had come from the east, finding their way through. And\nsome of them had, as we found out a few days later, some of them who were actually\non their way to emigrate to the United States were also on the train. And the train\ntook off. What we didn\u2019t know, which we learned shortly thereafter is that the\nGermans has sealed the borders everywhere. And we arrived at the Dutch border.\nPolice boarded the train. All Jews, out of the train. And we were all taken out of the\ntrain, all our baggage off the train, put on a cart, a horse drawn cart without a horse,\nand we were marched to a jail. Best thing I could describe it as, and locked up in a \u2014\nin a room. I remember the room vividly, there we-were quite a number of people in\nthat cell. And I remember the green door and the bars on the door and the window\nand the toilet in the open, which was to be used by everybody there and of course as\nchildren having to use the toilet in front of all these people was something we didn\u2019t\nlike, and I remember the-they shielded us when we had to do so. And we were there\nfor a period of time, I\u2019m not sure how long. My father had some papers with him and\nin \u2014 it\u2014 and he was concerned that the Germans might see those papers and\nmisinterpret them or find them, and he ate them. And for my brother and I, this was a\nmarvel to see. I think maybe made a big impression on us more-so than even going to\njail 1s that my father would eat paper. And these are \u2014 it\u2019s funny, the things that you\nrec-recollect. And sometime within that day or the next day \u2014 it seemed to me it was\nMarch 10, 2001\njust one night that we spent there, but my parents have often said it was almost a\nweek, and I don\u2019t recall that. I think it was just \u2014 I think it was just that \u2014 that night.",
        "A: I believe we were the only boys. There were a lot \u2014 there were other people in that\ncell, in that room. Some of them were single men and single women, you know, these\nwere groups. Husband and wife maybe, perhaps families as well. And at one point I\nguess we ha \u2014 my father had an opportunity to speak to the commandant there of \u2014\nwhoever he was. And he explained to him that he was traveling here on business. He\nhad this document from \u2014 still \u2014 the Reichsbank, and that he had \u2014 was going to\nHolland to bid on some very important materials which were needed for the \u2014 the war\neffort in Germany or for the military, and they couldn\u2019t keep us incarcerated because\nhe had to get on with this business. And the man apparently told them well, you\nknow, I have to see \u2014 I \u2014 first thing I have to do 1s feed 3,000 Jews. He said, we'll\ntake care of you after that\u2019s done. But apparently, coincidentally, the \u2014 there was a\nship sailing from Holland for the United States which had booked passage for about a\nthousand Jews who had permission to come to the United States. The Aidam(ph) was\nthe name of the vessel. And apparently this was made known to the German\nauthorities there and they didn\u2019t want to create a situation \u2014 at least we think they\ndidn't want to create a situation where there would become known that they\nprevented Jews from leaving. It would have been politically unwise, maybe created\nMarch 10, 2001\ntoo much of a public relations problem for them. So they decided to let those Jews\nwho had that passage booked, and pay for us to go to Holland to catch that ship, it\nwas sailing from Holland, to go. And my father said, well look, I have my papers for\nHolland. Didn\u2019t have any passage on that ship or anything like that. And somehow he\nmanaged to get us in with this group to go to Holland. And it was just, I think, good\nfortune. There was a point just before we went into this jail where we \u2014 where my\nmother and father were told by the \u2014 whoever was leading us to this ersatz\nconcentration camp that they had put up, or that \u2014 this jail where they were going,\nwhere they were apparently separating or segregating people, where they were going\nto put them and what have you, assign them to some rooms. And they said to my\nparents, they said look, you will go to a concentration camp where you will be safe.\nYour children will go to an orphanage. And of course the minute Norbert and I heard\nthis \u2014 and I recall that too \u2014 we started to raise the roof because we were not going to\nbe separated from our parents. This was \u2014 we were just, I guess frightened. And I\nmean, really scared that we might be separated from them. And my mother said,\nchildren calm down. Nobody is going to separate us from anybody. Before that\nhappens, I will take your lives and mine right here. And she made it known, she was\nvery distinct about it, and she always carried a \u2014 through her lifetime she always\ncarried a paring knife, which she used to peel apples, cause she loved apples. And she\nwas fully prepared to take that knife and cut our throats and her own throat so that\nMarch 10, 2001\nthat wouldn't happen. And it wasn't so strange, because there were people who\nattempted suicide in that jail because they had lost everything, they knew they were\ngoing to be sent to a concentration camp, back where they came from. And there\nwere any number of suicide attempts, some of them perhaps successful, I don\u2019t know.\nAnyway, that was \u2014 in that moment, I don\u2019t know what made the Germans say forget\nabout it, or go on with your \u2014 the way I heard it my mother said, go on, take your\nbrats and get out of here. I\u2019m not sure that that was the case, cause I don\u2019t remember\nthat, but 1t could very well have been. And we went \u2014 we were then on the train with\nall these other people, or we went to the border with all these other people to cross to\ngo into Holland.",
        "A: No. Oh, wait a minute ... I don\u2019t have a recollection of it.",
        "A: It was on the Dutch border, obviously, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know where. But we got to the\nborder, my father telephoned across and got ahold of his friend and said look, we\u2019re\nhere, get over here fast. We\u2019ve got to get out of here. And they \u2014 they came, they\npicked us up and took us to a \u2014 an inn, I guess, in Holland, where for \u2014 I remember\nmy parents telling me the Dutch couldn\u2019t have been nicer. They saw us, they knew\nwhat had happened, they\u2019d asked all kinds of questions about us. They laid out \u2014 they\nhad a table of food, that was the food \u2014 the kinds of things they \u2014 my parents hadn\u2019t\nMarch 10, 2001\nseen in \u2014 in years in Germany. And their eyes opened and \u2014 and they had even put us\nin a hotel, they had drawn the water in the tub, hot water so they could take a bath\nbecause they apparently had been \u2014 it was a few days before we got out of that jail to\nget across, and it was just a tremendous relief to be out of Germany, and to f\u2014 and be\nin Holland and feel reasonably safe that this was not going to \u2014 that we were going to\nsurvive this \u2014 this thing.",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall that we did. We had some toys and my parents, I\u2019m sure put them\nonboard the moving van when it left Germany and I\u2019m sure that it arrived in Holland\nand that we played with them, but it \u2014 I didn\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t remember carrying anything\nwith us of that nature. What I do remember is the \u2014 sitting in the hotel with \u2014 being\nfed this wonderful food. I\u2019d never eaten fish or I didn't like fish and my parents were\noffering me Dover sole, my God, I\u2019d \u2014 I\u2019d kill to have that t-today, I still do, I love it,\nyou know. But in those days, as a kid, you didn\u2019t want to eat that stuff. And you\nknow, as \u2014 wonderful stories. My parents wanted us to learn Dutch as quickly as\npossible. And they had, in the period of time between when we came back from\nHolland the first time in Germany, and then left finally to leave, they had taken\nDutch lessons from a teacher, local teacher who came over and taught them some\nDutch. And we were sitting on a couch, and behind me on the couch, on the wall was\nMarch 10, 2001\na \u2014 a String with a \u2014 that you could pull and it would ring, it would send off a bell for\nroom service, or for somebody to come. And we had finished eating a meal and my\nparents wanted the hotel to know that so they could come and clear the dishes, and in\n\u2014I guess it\u2019s in Dutch, the name for a bell 1s like English, a bell. And in German bell\n\u2014 belling is to bark, like a dog. So they turned to us, turned to me and they said\nbellmal(ph), or you know, ring the bell. And I looked at them kind of strange, I said,\nwhat do you want me to do? They said it again and I said bow wow. Which was the\nonly thing I understood. Well, it was the hilarity of that moment and the relief of\nbeing \u2014 of having gone through what they had just experienced and gone through,\nthat created a moment of just pure joy. And we laughed so heartily, all of us, and I \u2014\ncourse I di \u2014 first I didn\u2019t know what they were laughing about, but then, you know,\nthe explanation of it all was even \u2014 was quite a good deal of fun for me and \u2014 and \u2014\nand that\u2019s how \u2014 that\u2019s how we got into Holland. And \u2014 and shortly thereafter we\nmoved into an apartment which our friends had gotten for us in Amsterdam in a very,\nvery lovely area. And \u2014 and we, my brother and I went to school there, a Jewish\nschool in Amsterdam. Very, very strict Orthodox Jewish school. We \u2014 I remember\nmy parents \u2014 my mother sent us off to school on the first day with sandwiches, and\nthey had meat on the sandwiches. And so we got there and it was time to go out\nlunch to eat and they discovered that we had meat on the sandwiches and my brother\nand I were made to go outside and eat them there because they were kosher and God\nMarch 10, 2001\nforbid somebody would contaminate their kosher atmosphere with our meat\nsandwiches.",
        "A: This was in \u2014 probably November, or di\u2014 maybe December, yeah, by that time\nwe were settled, it was December, or j \u2014",
        "A: And so when I came home I told my parents never to send me to school again\nwith a sandwich that had \u2014 I think it was pot roast, which I loved, on it, you know, 1-\nit had to be vegetarian or \u2014 or some milk substance, cheese or whatever. And \u2014",
        "A: Not that I know of, no. There were \u2014 th-the children I came in contact with were\nall Dutch and we learned very, very rapidly the language from them. My brother and\nI spoke Dutch fluently within a matter of weeks. An-And Dutch 1s not such a difficult\nlanguage for somebody who speaks German. So we learned it very rapidly and I\nremember having some of the struggles when you used to sometimes mix my\nGerman words with Dutch, but that was all gone very, very rapidly. And we loved\nHolland, because it \u2014 we lived in a \u2014 we lived on the Zuideramstellaan, which today\nis known as Rooseveltlaan. They changed the name. A big, wide boulevard, divided\ninto four lanes, I guess, three or four lanes. And there was a streetcar in the front and\nMarch 10, 2001\nit was wonderful for my brother and I cause we could walk around the corner and\nrent bicycles. And, you know, for a child the first time to have a bicycle is a lot of fun\nand these were dreadful bikes when you think about it in terms of what a modern\nbicycle looks like, but they were, nevertheless, a lot of fun. And then it was\nwintertime and the canals were frozen and you could go and skate and we went to see\nthat and I remember that so vividly, people skating as far as they wanted to. And not\nanywhere did we as \u2014 s-see a sign Jews were not wanted. No place in Holland. Didn't\nexist. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: Well, it was just \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether I was \u2014 that I even thought about it. I\nthink it was I just took it for granted, that this was Holland, that it was \u2014 we were \u2014 it\nwas different. There were \u2014 there were no military marches, no \u2014 no police that \u2014 or\nHitler youth that would march around and wave their flags. It was just \u2014 didn\u2019t exist.",
        "A: Yes, they certainly did. We had no trouble getting along with the Dutch Jewish\nchildren. My parents were able still, in 1938 - 1939, shortly after they arrived in\nHolland, to get my parents \u2014 my grandparents out of Germany. Now, we know that\nthey must have left without anything, because \u2014 at least my grandparents must have\nMarch 10, 2001\nleft Germany with nothing in their pockets, to speak. We know that \u2014 well, the\nGermans made the Jews pay for all the damage they \u2014 they caused on Kristallnacht,\nthat\u2019s history. And they weren\u2019t allowed to own property, they weren\u2019t \u2014 things\nbecame so oppressive for Jews that my grandfather, I\u2019m sure, sold his house for a\npittance at that time because there was nothing else he could do with it. Whether he\ncould every take the money with him to get it out, I don\u2019t know, I have no idea. But\nthey managed to get them to Holland, and they had an apartment in Amsterdam, not\ntoo far from where we lived. My brother and I used to bicycle down to their place. As\na matter of fact, a-about 10 years ago it 1s now that I was in Amsterdam, I went to see\nwhere we lived, which I r-re-remembered. I\u2019ve been there recently too, and I actually\ntook some pictures of that. And I could find my way still, to my grandparents home,\nit\u2019s so well ingrained in my mind. My parents, the moment they arrived in Holland\nsaid well, we\u2019ve got to start thinking about a little \u2014 getting even further away from\nGermany and finding a \u2014 another place to go because if it can happen there, it can \u2014\nmight happen here. We just don\u2019t feel secure. It was not just that, it was also, I think\nfor economic reasons. You can imagine all the Jews that wound up in Holland, all\nseeking employment. And the competition for my father must have been extremely\nsevere. He was the young man who arrived, he got the dirty jobs. He had to do all the\ntraveling, which in many ways was f \u2014 was good, it helped, because he could \u2014 he\nwent to \u2014 to England quite a great deal. Matter of fact, he even \u2014 he even walked into\nMarch 10, 2001\nthe foreign office in England, offered his services because he was so much aware of\nwhere German industry was and what they needed and what they had to buy, because\nthat was his business, this is what he did. And he ma \u2014 was able later to make use of\nthose connections, when we finally left Holland to come to the United States, he was\n\u2014 that \u2014 that helped him a great deal. But they had \u2014 my parents, during the time that\nthey were in Germany had applied for visas to come to America as did practically\nevery Jew in Germany. And the likelihood of that happening was extremely,\nextremely slim. It was a lottery system and \u2014 and when he \u2014 and when they wound up\nin Holland, my father said you know, I\u2019m going to contact the American embassy in\nStuttgart and we will have our files transferred to Rotterdam. After all, we\u2019re now in\nHolland, doesn\u2019t do us any good to have that file in Stuttgart, why not? So he wrote\nthem a letter and he got the file transferred over there. And I suppose that lot of\nthings came that worked together at that time. There were a lot of people who just\ncouldn\u2019t, even when their number came up for a visa, couldn\u2019t accept it any more\ncause they\u2019d already been transported somewhere else, to the concentration camps, or\nwhat have you. And the quota suddenly opened up enough so that one day \u2014 we were\nin Holland I think for almost a year and a half, two years, close to that. Suddenly he\ngot a call from Rotterdam, Mr. Schnog, bring your family here for a medical exam. If\nyou pass the medical exam you will be able to come to the United States, you\u2019ll get\nyour visa. So they had to make a decision as to whether to stay \u2014 of course they had\nMarch 10, 2001\njobs and they were well settled in Holland, or whether to leave. And after everything\nthat happened in Germany, and I think also because of the severe competition for\njobs in Holland at the time, they decided th-there\u2019s no question about this, let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s\nget out, let\u2019s get as far away from this menace in Germany as we possibly can. And\nthey went to the embassy, we had our physicals, and in two weeks they had a visa to\ncome to the United States. All that excitement, you can well imagine. They started\npacking up their things and making plans. And because they couldn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nwhether they could bring their money out of Holland or whether they had a problem\nwith that, but they decided to book passage first class because they couldn\u2019t do\nanything else with the money, on Cunard. Cunard White Star line from London, or\nLiverpool they sail \u2014 sail from, to the United States. And packed up our things, sent\nthem ahead and suddenly we were leaving Holland. Left f \u2014 said goodbye to my\ngrandparents and we went to the airport, Schiphol, I think it was, pretty sure, and we\nboarded \u2014 and this was during the \u2014 this was already during the war, during the\nPhoney War between England and Germany, because in 1940 England was drawn\ninto the war because the Germans had invaded Poland. There was a \u2014 an agreement\nthat they would \u2014 that England would declare war, and they did.\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: Oh, we \u2014 we were fully aware of world events and what was happening.\nCompletely. My parents were interested in it, I was interested in it and \u2014 and this\nwas, for us, listening to current events was what it was like for American kids our age\nfollowing the baseball season. It was important in our lives. Obviously it had\nenormous amount of \u2014 of importance in our family. So we \u2014 w-we wanted to know.\nWe wa \u2014 and war, 1t \u2014 you know, it was war and we a \u2014 we had gone through the \u2014\nthe Russians, I think, invading Finland, and this was in the news everywhere and as\nchildren you \u2014 you followed this. In fact, we weren\u2019t the only ones, I think all the\nkids in those days, followed that.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, it did not. We felt very secure, very safe. We had no concerns. Indeed, my\nparents had no concerns being in Holland, Holland was a neutral and nobody\nexpected that they would be involved or become involved in a war. They hadn\u2019t been\nMarch 10, 2001\nin the first World War and they were \u2014 certainly weren\u2019t going to get involved in this\none. It was a very liberal country and we felt very, very safe there. But I do think that\nthe economic opportunity wasn\u2019t there and this 1s what really proved to be the most\nimportant reason why my parents decided that they should leave and \u2014 and come\nsomewhere else, or go somewhere else.",
        "A: Oh yes, of course. We \u2014 we felt we would go ahead, we would get settled and we\nwould then bring them to the United States, they would follow right on along. \\",
        "A: The United States was America, it was a \u2014 a dream, really. It was something that\nwe had read about. Everything good was in America. This 1s w \u2014 the \u2014 the fame of\nAmerica, of New York, of the skyscrapers, of everything was \u2014 was known to us. It\nwas known to everyone in Europe. We \u2014 an-and it was everybody\u2019s dream to go to\nAmerica at one time or another, to live there or to at least visit. So this was wonderful\nfor us to \u2014 we\u2019re going to go to America. Was just marvelous to \u2014 to contemplate\nthat. So as a child it was great.\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: We had seen pictures in magazines. This was mostly what my parents had\nexplained and told us about. It was our imagination working, perhaps overtime. I\nreally don\u2019t think so, I think our imagination had it right. One of the things that was\nso interesting in Holland, so many things happened, as a child this would be\ninteresting, apparently we had a friend, I don\u2019t know whether he was an immigrant\nfrom Germany or what, and we were very much into cars, my brother and I. My\nfather at one time in Germany had owned a \u2014 a lot, a car lot where people would\nbring their old cars and he would disassemble them for the metals, the copper and the\n\u2014all the precious metals that were inside and sell the rest of it off as scrap. And my\nbrother and I often went there and played in the old cars, you know. We\u2019d climb into\nthe cabs and turn the wheels. It was a lot of fun, very enjoyable. So cars were a\npassion for us, we could recognize every automobile on the streets, what it looked\nlike, whether it was an Opal or whether it was a \u2014 a Ford or a Volkswagen or\nwhatever, we knew it all. And in Holland this man came over and he \u2014 was a brand\nnew car, I think it must have been a Nash or something like that, as I recall and it was\na very modern styling for that time and my brother and I were so impressed. Well it\nturned out this fellow had stolen the car and it wasn\u2019t long before they caught him\nand I guess put him in jail, I hope in Holland, not in Germany, but they \u2014 they did. So\nthere were all these adventures. I remember my mother taking us to the tulip fields,\nand seeing that. We \u2014 we spent a week or two weeks of vacation sailing in the\nMarch 10, 2001\nZuiderzee, which at that time was open to the North Sea, which has since been\ndammed in. And we were there with some of my parents\u2019 friends and colleagues,\nacquaintances and we sailed from one town to the \u2014 all around this \u2014 this huge sea.\nAnd it was just marvelous and \u2014 you know, and then one of these old Dutch ships\nwith the \u2014 what do you call them, the sideboards that would go down. They didn\u2019t\nhave a keel, so they had sideboards and we would sail all around. My father was a\nwonderful photographer and he took some beautiful, beautiful pictures of that, some\nof which I may still have, I\u2019m not sure. They\u2019re very wonderful.",
        "A: Yes, we were observing Jewish holidays. What became really less and less, the\nneed to maintain a kosher home perhaps was still there in Holland because my\ngrandparents were there, but after that, when we left Holland, that, you know, almost\ndisappeared completely. Anyway, going back, we \u2014 when their number \u2014 the \u2014 when\nthey won the lottery to come to the United States, and it was truly winning the\nlottery, we wound up at the airport there and we climbed aboard a DC-3 type aircraft,\nwhich was all painted orange and the windows were frosted. And the reason for that\nwas this, Holland had declared itself a neutral and their airplanes, their commercial\nplanes, they blocked \u2014 they frosted the windows so that they couldn\u2019t be accused of\nhaving spies on board the airplane looking down at the German fortifications and\nMarch 10, 2001\nthen reporting that out. And we got on this airplane on which my brother and I\nimmediately got sick because it bumped all the way across the English channel and\nwe wound up in England.",
        "A: We\u2019re talking about January 1939 \u2014 1940. It was either very late December or\nvery early \u2014 you know, I think it was January. January 1940. Yeah, exactly. And we\narrived and went to stay at the White Hall Hotel on Speaker\u2019s Corner at Hyde Park. I\nremember it very, very well.",
        "A: Not a word. Not a word of English. I was fluent in Dutch, I could speak German,\nof course. And what impressed me about England were the barrage balloons. England\nbeing at war, although the air raids had not started, they were flying these barrage\nballoons over London. They were not more than, I would say 200 yards off the\nground, up in the air. So they \u2014 they looked like small blimps floating everywhere.\nAnd all the \u2014 at every intersection where the police had a traffic cop or something,\ntheir \u2014 their huts were all sandbagged in. And they were on a war footing. And this\nimpressed us, my brother and I. The blackout during the night. Cars driving around\nwithout \u2014 with shielded headlights. And \u2014 so I remember that \u2014 that wartime London.\nAnd I \u2014I remember my brother getting sick 1n the hotel, he had caught some \u2014 some\nsomething. What it was I don\u2019t know. But he was there, maybe it was influenza or\nMarch 10, 2001\nsomething like that, and we were stuck in the hotel. And my parents had to stay with\nhim. My father was out \u2014 would go to the \u2014 to his office there in London, he had\nfriends and etcetera. And they sent me out to purchase a bulb for a flashlight, because\nhe needed it at night, everything was blacked out. And they said okay, now you go\ndown Regent Street right here and down a few blocks and you walk into a store, it\u2019s\nabout a block down and you go ask for a light bulb. Of course, they told me this in\nDutch. And I said, well what\u2019s that in English? And they said, well we\u2019ll look it up\nfor you. And they looked it up and they said, well you ask for a bulb. I said bulb?\nAnd she \u2014 yeah. And off I went, I couldn\u2019t speak a word of English. And marched\ndown Regent Street, into the store and I asked for a bulb and managed to get it\nwithout any difficulty. I think it \u2014 that was a interesting and very formative\nexperience for me. It taught me a little bit of independence, that you could go\nanywhere, and you didn\u2019t have to be afraid, that you could make yourself understood,\nno matter what. And \u2014 and for a young \u2014 for a young man that was, I thought, kind of\nmaturing and I came back and we had it. Now, we had to stay, we had to get\npermission in London to stay a little longer because my brother was ill. And they had\nbooked the passage with Cunard line but they hadn\u2019t \u2014 the ship hadn\u2019t been\ndesignated at that time. So my father had to go to the police there to get an extension.\nAnd he called his friends at the foreign office at the time and said here, you know, I\nneed to get an extension, can you help me out? He was afraid that they wouldn\u2019t\nMarch 10, 2001\npermit it. And they said well, just go to the police, don\u2019t worry about it. Just go in\nthere and ask them. And he went there and they said of course, you know, you don\u2019t\nhave any problems here, you can stay as long as you like. This they didn't\nunderstand, or didn\u2019t \u2014 you know, they didn\u2019t expect it. I can\u2019t say they didn\u2019t\nunderstand it, they didn\u2019t expect it. They didn\u2019t expect that you could have so much\nfreedom in \u2014 in any country and there wouldn\u2019t be somebody who would say no, you\ncan\u2019t do this or you can\u2019t \u2014 you \u2014 you must have these papers, or you must go back.\nI\u2019m sorry, you can\u2019t stay, you have to go back to where you came from. Not there.\nAnd these were very comforting for them. My brother and I didn\u2019t \u2014 really weren\u2019t\nconcerned, cause we weren\u2019t aware that these \u2014 that this might be a problem or that\nthey were \u2014 tha-that my parents were concerned about it. But eventually \u2014 of course\nmy brother got better in about three or four weeks and in March, I guess it was, must\nhave been March, we finally told that the \u2014 we would have the passage on the Cunard\nWhite Star liner, the Britannic, and to go to Liverpool on such and such a day and we\nboard \u2014 they didn\u2019t tell us what the name of the ship was because they were afraid\nthat there would be too many \u2014 too much information around and it would get back to\nthe Germans and there was this submarine warfare going on. They didn't want\nanybody to know what ships were in port and when they would be sailing. So they\njust said, come to Liverpool and you\u2019ll be on one of the vessels, the ships.\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: Yes, there were. There were German Jews who were also setting sail for the\nUnited States at that time. We showed up at Liverpool and we w \u2014 boarded the\nBritannic, and my father had been told when he booked the passage that they would\nbe traveling in convoy across the Atlantic because of the submarine warfare. And we\nexpected that. So next day we set sail. My parents had bought these first class tickets\nand we were in first class. There were \u2014 and this is where it 1s, there were many Jews\nand people who were traveling in steerage, so to speak, and they couldn\u2019t even visit\nus. And we knew some of them, my parents knew some of them, but \u2014 but we as \u2014\nwe were ensconced in very, very luxurious quarters on the ship, and was \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014\nthere\u2019d be these easy chairs on the deck and they would serve bouillon and all kinds\nof goodies, and was wonderful for kids. And indeed, on th \u2014 on the voyage across I\nfell in love with English omelets, jelly omelets, they were wonderful. I la \u2014 had one\nevery day my mother says and I \u2014 I still remember them, they were great. But we got\n\u2014 we were told that we would have to have a lifeboat drill almost daily because of the\nfear of being s \u2014 being attacked by a submarine. And my parents made us sleep in our\nclothes with our shoes next to the bed, and if we heard the foghorn three times, we\nwere to get in \u2014 get those shoes on, don\u2019t tie the laces, just get them on, grab the life\npreservers and report to our lifeboat stations. Course, it never came to that,\nfortunately. But the first day out my father \u2014 we looked around and I was expecting\nto see this huge convoy of ships going across the ocean and I looked outside and\nMarch 10, 2001\nthere wasn\u2019t a ship in sight. And my father went to the captain and said, you know, I\nthought we were traveling convoy, where are all the other ships? And the captain\nsaid, oh that\u2019s nonsense, we are so fast we\u2019d outrace any convoy and we\u2019re going\nacross the ocean. And indeed they did. As a matter of fact they zigzagged all the way\nacross the ocean and I could stand on the tail of the ship and see the wake zigzagging\nacross, to throw off any potential torpedo, I guess, that was directed in our \u2014 1\u2014 to \u2014\ndirected in our direction, so \u2014 and that was the voyage. I remember it and I loved it,\nas any child would, on a big ship. And we arrived in New York and were greeted by\nfriends whom had \u2014 who had preceded us to the United States. Indeed, he was a\npartner of my father\u2019s in that auto wrecking yard at one time. And they took us to the\n\u2014 to the \u2014 to a hotel on Broadway, the Whitehall Hotel. Did I say Whitehall before? Is\nthat the hotel in Great Britain? It\u2019s not the right \u2014 that\u2019s not the right name. The one\nin Great Britain was \u2014",
        "A: No, it was the whiteh \u2014 Whitehall Hotel in New York.",
        "A: It was on Hundredth Street and Broadway.",
        "A: On April 1, 1940 we landed in the United States, and \u2014\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: Yes, yes they were.",
        "A: Well, they could communicate, there was certainly correspondence by letter and\nyou could even telephone still, or \u2014 Holland was a \u2014 still a neutral at that time and it\nwas certainly possible to communicate with them. And when we moved into the ho \u2014\nhotel on \u2014 on Broadway and Hundredth Street \u2014",
        "A: No. There were no other children that I remember on the boat with us. Just other\npassengers from any number of places. I don\u2019t remember really any of them\nparticularly, we were [indecipherable]",
        "A: They may have, but none that I recall. I\u2014 no idea. Anyway, we came to the States\nand we were ensconced in the Whitehall Hotel on Broadway and Hundredth Street\nand my mother took us right away over to the nearest school, enrolled us in school\nand we didn\u2019t speak any \u2014 a word of English, again. And \u2014\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: I remember being on the side of the ship and my parents said look, there\u2019s the\nStatue of Liberty. And I looked, and so help me, I didn\u2019t see it. It was the \u2014 must\nhave been right under my nose, but I didn\u2019t see it. I don\u2019t know where I was looking,\nmaybe they were pointing awkwardly and I just looking around at all the other ships\nin the harbor, etcetera. It\u2019s skipped, completely. And we pulled into the pier and we\ncleared through customs in \u2014 almost instantly.",
        "A: No, th \u2014 I think everybody was smiles, that I remember. It was a happy time. We \u2014\nwe were met by the \u2014 our acquaintances here and they said come, we take you to\nyour hotel and they took us with all our luggage on the subway. Through the\nturnstiles. Now, I don\u2019t know whether you remember the old fashioned turnstiles, but\nthey were \u2014 in the subways \u2014 but they were these wooden affairs that looked like very\nbig, huge, heavy propellers that you would push around. And we\u2019d had to drag\nthrough these things. But be \u2014 but even bef \u2014 before that, we \u2014 we had to get\nsomething to eat so they took us to the automat. Well for us, we\u2019ve never seen\nanything like this. First of all, there was so much food of everything, every kind that\nwe could ever want. And then, to be able to just put coins into a machine and have\nMarch 10, 2001\nthese things pop out was marvelous. We \u2014 we enjoyed that. And we wound up, as I\nsay, at the end of the subway ride in the \u2014 in the hotel. My next recollection I think\nwas mostly in the school where I could \u2014 was way ahead of the rest of the class in\nmathematics and way behind in understanding anything that was going on, because\nmy Dutch didn\u2019t help me much, my English didn\u2019t help me much. And \u2014 but we \u2014 we\nmanaged. We got along for a couple of months. It was, I think April, May, then\nschool \u2014 June and school was out and \u2014 and that was that. Now, lots of things\nhappened in between. We arrived on April first here in the United States. In early\nMay I believe it was, the Germans overran Holland. And that happened so quickly\nthat we did not have time, my parents did not have time to get my grandparents out of\nHolland. And although we didn\u2019t know it at that time, they were, shortly after the\nGermans walked in, they were taken on the train and transported to, as I finally\nlearned after visiting the Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, they lost their lives in\nSobibor. And when that happened, we don\u2019t know. Some time in the war years.\nWhether it was early on or later on, we just \u2014 I just don\u2019t know. I know my parents\nbecame aware of it sometime during the \u2014 1n the period between 1940 and 1944, that\nthey were gone. Actually maybe \u2014 no, it was just about then, I guess.",
        "A: Yeah.\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: Yes, as soon as the Germans were in, that was almost impossible to communicate.\nThere was still some correspondence coming through because he \u2014 America was not\nat war with Germany. So you could still get some mail and they did, I think, until the\n\u2014 until the war broke out in 1941. So there was still some correspondence for a period\nof time and then after that. So it must have been in either 1942 or \u201943 that they were\ngrabbed with all the other Jews who were in Holland and deported. My brother and I\nwere sent to summer camp in the United States and shortly after we \u2014 that summer,\nthe year that we arrived, we went to the YMHA camp. Funny. And it was Surprise\nLake camp was the name of it. As it turns out, Anita, who I\u2019m married to right now\nalso went to that camp. Of course, we didn\u2019t know each other then. She was younger\nthan I. But \u2014",
        "A: Yes, it was in the country, and \u2014 Cold Springs, is it? Or something like that. And\nthey left us there in \u2014 where the \u2014 for \u2014 for I guess six weeks, for the summertime.\nAnd we were old enough at that time not to object to being without our parents, I\nguess. And we \u2014 and I guess two or three weeks after summer camp started, they\ncame up to visit us. And they came and they went to our counselor and they said,\nhow are the boys doing? And the counselor said well, what do you mean how are\nthey doing? They\u2019re fine. No, that\u2019s not what we mean, I mean how are they getting\nMarch 10, 2001\nalong with the other children? He said they get along okay. Well but, my parents\nsaid, they don\u2019t speak English. And the counselor said, of course they speak English.\nHe never knew that we couldn\u2019t speak English. And within a matter of literally\nweeks, we learned enough, learned English sufficiently so that no \u2014 nobody ever\nknew that we didn\u2019t sp \u2014 that we weren\u2019t English speaking to begin with. And I\nalways feel that such submersion for young people is probably the best way to learn a\nlanguage. It really 1s.",
        "A: No, no, no accent. Well, I \u2014 certainly not a German accent. Well, I think one of\nthe reasons that we picked up the language was \u2014 so quickly was because we moved\nfrom Germany to Holland, we learned Dutch in a relatively short period of time\nbecause Dutch is also very similar to German. But Dutch also has a huge number of\nEnglish words in its language. So the transition was an easy one. Go from German to\nDutch to English. It was quite easy, at least for me and I think it helped enormously\nto \u2014 to have that progression. So here we were in the United States and we could\nspeak English and shortly after that summer my parents \u2014",
        "A: No, not that I know of. Oh, there may have been, but I didn\u2019t know about it. I had\nno \u2014 no knowledge of it.\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: Don\u2019t remember recalling or saying anything to them. My brother and I were in\nthe same bunk. We spoke to each other, obviously and we just kept our ears open to\nwhat was going on and what was being said.",
        "A: No, no, in \u2014 1n the bunk, in here. Th \u2014 in German, I \u2014 no, we spoke Dutch. If we\ndid speak, we spoke Dutch. We didn\u2019t want to speak German.",
        "A: Ger \u2014 Germans were anathema in the United States at that time and we didn\u2019t\nwant to have the kind of discrimination experienced against us because we were\nGerman and German speaking. We wanted \u2014 we didn\u2019t want anything to do with\nGermans. Germans were a pariah and we didn\u2019t want to be part of the pariah. If\npeople noticed that we spoke German, they might take offense.",
        "A: Not if you\u2019re accustomed to \u2014 not if you\u2019ve been accustomed to having that sort of\nthing done to you as a Jew in Germany. You were accustomed to it. You would know\nthat if you were just different than anybody else, if you wa \u2014 if you were different,\nyou better be somebody different who everybody liked, not somebody different\nwhom \u2014 whom everybody despised. So being Germans was not on the top of our list,\nMarch 10, 2001\nbut we spoke Dutch, and that was okay. See, Holland was still very friendly, they\nweren't tainted with Nazi persona, so we said okay, we \u2014 we were speaking Dutch,\nand that was at that time our major language. We came back from camp \u2014 because\nmy parents didn\u2019t speak Dutch at home and we no longer spoke Dutch, we spoke\nEnglish at that time. We promptly dropped Dutch and now I recall very, very little of\nDutch. Very little. \u2019've been back several times. I can probably read some of it and\nunderstand a little, but I don\u2019t speak it at all the way I did as a child when I was very,\nvery fluent in it. But German, strangely enough, being the mother tongue, I\nremember and I can understand it. So that was that.",
        "A: Yes. By that time my parents had moved to Forest Hills.",
        "A: Queens. And \u2014 an apartment there and we went to school there. I guess it was\nthere, for the first time in America that I experienced that anti-Semitism was not a\nphenomenon that afflicted Europe alone. Because we were in the \u2014 I guess the third\ngrade in the school, public school in Forest Hills. Very lovely school, P.S. three. And\nI remember that it must have been one of the national holidays and my parents had\npinned an American flag to my lapel and my brother\u2019s lapel and we went off to\nschool. And I'll never forget it, but the teacher, knowing that we were immigrants,\nhad made a remark that you shouldn\u2019t be wearing that flag, you are not really\nMarch 10, 2001\nAmericans, or what have you. Something along those lines. And my mother took\ntremendous offense, she went to school and really \u2014 she was a very outspoken\nwoman, and she was quite outspoken about that sort of thing and said so. But more\nthan that, during our growing up years here, we had occasion to go with our parents.\nWhen we were a little bit older we went on holiday with them. And one of the trips\nthat we took was up to the Adirondacks.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nMarch 10, 2001\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: My parents had arranged to rent a cabin on Trout Lake, near Bolton Landing 1n \u2014\nin the Lake George region of the Adirondacks. And they had packed provisions to\ntake up with them, put them in the car and we headed up north. And when we arrived\nat the cabin it was truly a horrible place. The place was overrun with bugs. The\nmattresses were rotten and it was the kind of place that 1t would have been difficult to\nstay at in any circumstances. So my mother said, I don\u2019t care what we have with us \u2014\nand in those days we didn\u2019t have such great refrigeration, so we said we \u2014 we\u2019 ll just\nhave to go find someplace else to stay. They didn\u2019t realize is that every place there\nwas jam packed and during the summer you couldn\u2019t find a place. What we didn\u2019t\nrealize til we saw it were the restricted signs. And there were \u2014 came in any number\nof forms. There were either just plain restricted, a sign that said restricted, which\neverybody knew meant no Jews, or churches nearby which meant essentially the\nsame thing. And it came as a \u2014 a Surprise to me, or perhaps not as a surprise because\nof what we\u2019d been through. But my parents managed to ignore those things and live\nwith it and possibly they could ignore it because they had so much experience in\nGermany ignoring it. But it left its mark. Certainly left 1ts mark on me, that anti-\nMarch 10, 2001\nSemitism in whatever form, perhaps not as virulent as 1t was in Germany could exist\nanywhere, and indeed, it does exist almost everywhere. So \u2014",
        "A: When? Do to the \u2014 I \u2014 this must have been in \u2014 I must have \u2014 I was \u2014 I was older.",
        "A: Oh yes. It was still during the war. We had saved gasoline coupons and whatever\nto \u2014 to make it, because gasoline was severely rationed during the war. I think I must\nhave been about 14 years old at the time, which would have been in 1900 and \u2014 well,\nmaybe 13 or four \u2014 1945 \u2014 \u201944 - \u201945, in that \u2014 in that period of time. I think maybe in\n\u2014I must have been 13 at the time, I\u2019m pretty sure it was. And we \u2014 we traveled\naround trying to find a place to stay, and not because of the restricted signs we\ncouldn\u2019t stay, it was just simply they were full, couldn\u2019t take anybody. And we\nwound up at a \u2014 right opposite where we had rented this cabin at a \u2014 at a \u2014 turned out\nto be a Jewish camp, summer camp. And we walked in, the camp hadn\u2019t started yet,\nbut the owners were there and my parents asked whether they could stay there over\nthe ni \u2014 overnight and they said oh, stay as long as you like. They saw two boys and\nobviously it was \u2014 they could sign up two campers, which indeed they did, so we\nwound up spending our summers there for the next four or five years and 1t was\nwonderful experience for us, and a nice part of the country and we got to know a lot\nMarch 10, 2001\nof interesting people and made a lot of friends, some of whom I still see today, and \u2014\nwent to camp with us.",
        "A: Camp \u2014 name was Camp Waldman and I don\u2019t think it exists today. I think it\u2019s\nbeen sold, I don\u2019t know who owns it or what. But the owner was a fellow named\nCharlie Garland who lived in Glens Falls, he was a baker. And they were wonderful\npeople, very friendly and so here was this really strange combination of anti-Semitic\nsigns on the roads going up to Lake George, and here this tremendous welcoming o-\nof a camp that it was run by Jews and obviously these people were extremely well\naccepted in their community, because we got to know them quite well, they were\nknown all over the area. So all these things happened together and 1-1-it was a strange\nmixture, really, and it \u2014 it -- it puzzled me at the time and it still puzzles me today,\nhow these two things can coexist.",
        "A: Yes, we were \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes. When my \u2014 when we moved in here and we became \u2014 we were 11 or 12\nyears old, my parents said, well boys, you \u2014 you know, you have to think about your\nBar-Mitzvah, and we went to a Jewish synagogue in Rego Park. Today it\u2019s a very\nlarge synagogue, at that time it was a small shul, very Orthodox and we went to\nMarch 10, 2001\nSunday school, and we \u2014 and Hebrew school and like every good American boy we\nhated it. Despised it. In fact we \u2014 we spent our time doing mischief rather than paying\nattention to the class. I remember sticking a girl\u2019s bobby pin in the light socket and\nblowing out the lights in the whole place, in the synagogue. But it was \u2014 and no \u2014 and\nwhat amazed me most was the teacher came over to me, are you okay? She was more\nconcerned about me than I wa \u2014 she thought something had blown out of the wall,\nyou know. Aft \u2014 and I was totally responsible for the whole thing. But, it was about\nthat time that my father learned about the death of our \u2014 of my grandparents. And he,\nhaving been brought up very religiously, he went every morning and every night to \u2014\nto the minyan to \u2014 to the shul, and Norbert and I accompanied him. We went every\nsingle day with him for that \u2014 for that year of morning. And we learned our Bar-\nMitzvah lessons and had a \u2014 went through a regular Bar-Mitzvah at that shul. It was a\nvery nice time, we an \u2014 we loved the day, we loved being there, we loved \u2014 you\nknow, when you\u2019re \u2014 when you go through a Bar-Mitzvah, it\u2019s a wonderful thing for\na child. It\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s n\u2014 the learning and the stepping up to it is horrible, you hate it,\nevery minute of it. But when the day arrives and you manage your way through it, the\npride that you feel, and the \u2014 is exhilarating. And we \u2014 we really did enjoy that\nimmensely.\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I gave it very much thought. It may have been very hard for my\nparents to realize that this was happening without their parents being there, but we\nhad accepted the death of the grandparents and didn\u2019t even think about the fact that\nthey weren\u2019t there, or \u2014 we didn't look back. I think that\u2019s more of an adult thing.\nYou \u2014 you do that when you have more [indecipherable] we were more concerned\nabout how well we would do in reciting the Haftorah and the Torah portions and how\n\u2014 and what might happen afterwards because we had \u2014 all my parents friends would\ncome over to the house afterwards and we would be on display, obviously for them\nand \u2014 and we\u2019d have to recite the blessings before the meals and the \u2014 and after the\nmeal and all of this, which was important to our parents that we know those things,\nand \u2014 you know, and we did know them and have long since forgotten.",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 I had very fond memories of my grandparents and yes, I was \u2014 I can\u2019t\nsay that it was devastating, it was a loss. And I\u2019ve thought about it many times, you\nmiss them. But it was probably the f \u2014 the first time that \u2014 you know, there was so\nmuch death that you heard about in those days, so many stories of how people died.\nAnd by that time we were old enough to understand, and to know that this was\nhappening. And so it wasn\u2019t a \u2014 a total surprise and it wasn\u2019t totally devastating. You\nsort of knew that they were going to be caught up in it and that was that. [\u2014-I-I\nremember that we \u2014 none of us held out hope that they would ever get out. Perhaps\nMarch 10, 2001\nwe hoped because they were in Holland that they somehow might be safe from the \u2014\nfrom what was happening in Germany. But it was just a hope, and didn\u2019t turn out to\nbe the case, and that wasn\u2019t all too surprising, because we had \u2014 we had heard of\nother case, of other people in Holland who had lost their lives, who\u2019d been sent to\nconcentration camps and were no \u2014 no longer alive. Not just that, but people had\ncommitted suicide because of the struggles they were going through and they just\ncouldn\u2019t live with it any longer. There were many who did that.",
        "A: Yes, they did, they kept in touch with those relatives they had, we had. There were\n\u2014 we had \u2014 my father had some relatives who had moved to Holland as well, who had\nmanaged to escape because they were \u2014 had become Dutch citizens, they escaped to\nAruba and Curacao and still live there. And it\u2019s quite a large family that\u2019s down there\nand they\u2019ve done very well. They \u2014 I think they own the agency to distribute Toyota\ncars on those islands. Nice people, I\u2019ve met some of them. We haven\u2019t been down\nthere but we\u2019ve \u2014 they\u2019ve been in New York and when I \u2014 certainly if I go down\nthere, the name Schnog will be all over the island, as it is, you know. So yes, we\u2019ve\nmanaged to keep in \u2014 somewhat in touch with those relatives.\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: Oh, no, we never had any trouble with that, our \u2014 our \u2014 many of our teachers were\nJewish themselves and at that stage nobody knew any longer that we were\nimmigrants. We spoke English without too much of a trace of an accent. And we\nwere good students, we had a lot of friends, very close friends. And wa \u2014 I guess we\nwere almost normal teenagers that time, we \u2014 I don\u2019t remember \u2014 I remember that I\ndid very well in school, I loved my teachers. I think the next most troubling thing in\nmy life was the fact that some of my teachers were involved in the McCarthy si \u2014 era\nsituation, that thing. You know, when we grew up in those days, we were very\nliberal, almost Socialistic \u2014 I would say Socialistic. And we \u2014 a-and our teachers\nwere very liberal, very bright. Well, we admired them and they were \u2014 enormously.\nMy math teachers, my science teachers, there was \u2014 th-those were the classes I really\nadored, I loved them, and the \u2014 and they taught us so much and taught us a love for\nlearning. I had a Latin teacher who I was very fond of, who was very fond of me\nbecause she passed me despite the fact that my brother was the one who did all the\nwork and I did all the copying. And \u2014",
        "A: Yes, we stayed in public school, went to Forest Hills High School and graduated\nin Forest Hills High School. And then went to \u2014 we were \u2014 went to college, went to\nCornell University, where we both took an engineering course. Which was probably\nthe first big mistake I made in my life, but nevertheless, you know, in those days you\nMarch 10, 2001\nstuck with what you started and you finished it. And if you changed, somehow it was\nan admission of failure in one direction. At least I perceived it that way. I was maybe\ntoo immature to realize otherwise. So I stuck with engineering and got my degree,\nbut might have been much, much happier in a liberal arts environment.",
        "A: Well, there was tremendous joy when the war was over, and \u2014 you know, we\njoined in every celebration that \u2014 that had anything to do with destr \u2014 destroying\nNazism and Hitler. In every way, we just \u2014 all of America did and we were in the\nforefront of it, we did it just the same way, we hated this dictator. And we laughed at\nall the comical songs that were written at the time about Hitler, etcetera. And when\nthe war was over \u2014 you know, we\u2019d \u2014 we\u2019d \u2014 as children at that age, we dreamt about\ngoing into the army and fighting. We wanted \u2014 that was \u2014 that was very important to\nus. We were too young and our parents probably would have been horrified at the\nthought of it, but we\u2019d have dreams about this. We wanted to be in the army, to be a\npart of this, to fight as a soldier in \u2014 1n America. Not \u2014 not that we had any feeling\nbecause we immigrated and we came from Germany we had to do this, but simply\nbecause we were patriotic Americans. Extremely patriotic, as was everybody in those\ndays. I mean, there were kids in our school, in our high school who lied about their\nage to get \u2014 to go \u2014 to get into the Marines, or to get into the army, or what have you.\nMarch 10, 2001\nMy brother and I were very young, we looked young. We could never have passed 17\nor 18 to be able to get into the army, so we \u2014 it never dawned on us even to try. But if\nthe war had gone on, we would have au \u2014 we \u2014 I\u2019m sure we would have been in the\nforefront of volunteering to \u2014 to go into it, and we felt it was an obligation that we\nhad, to serve in America. So when the war was over, it was quite great. We wanted to\nknow all about what was \u2014 what had happened, where \u2014 what was left in Germany.\nMy parents actually went over and they saw what was left. This was [indecipherable |",
        "A: They \u2014 shortly after the war, it was either in 1940 \u2014 it probably was \u2014 I would\nguess it was in 1946, I would guess. Might have been 1945, but I think that might\nhave been too early. It must have been early in 1946, and Europe was devastated.\nAnd they went to Cologne and saw all the devastation that had been wrecked on the\nGerman cities by the continuous bombing. And they saw \u2014 they saw some of the\npeople who lived there, or recognized them when they came back. A story that my\nmother and father tell \u2014 told, they went to Cologne and they looked up a couple who\nwas \u2014 they had run the grocery store, I guess, there. And they went and asked about\nthem, and they still were running a grocery store. And they went over there to \u2014 and\nthey looked in the window there, I guess they were running a pastry shop or\nsomething like that. And the woman who ran the shop, and my parents knew, looked\nout the window and saw my mother and she turned pale. She said, Mrs. Schnog, Frau\nMarch 10, 2001\nSchnog, is that you? And my mother came in and said yes, it\u2019s me, we\u2019re back. How\nare you? Tell me, how did you survive? And they were, as my mother said, very\ndecent people caught up in this horror story with the Germans, they \u2014 many of them\ncouldn\u2019t do anything out of fear that something would happen to them. Indeed, my\nfather tells the story about a man who couldn\u2019t keep his mouth shut, he says, and he\nlived in Deutz near my grandparents. He was Christian, he hated the Nazis. He let\neverybody know that these \u2014 Hitler and these Nazis would ruin Germany. And\nwhat\u2019d they do? They caught him, they cut his head off. So that kind of terror visited\non a population brings about so much fear, that people shrink away. No wonder they\nput signs in their windows, no Jews. If they didn\u2019t, God knows what would have\nhappened to them, in their own minds. So there were a lot of \u2014 a lot of Germans who\ndidn\u2019t willingly participate in this, who did so I think out of fear, and what reprisals\nmight be visited on them. There were some of course, who went right along with it,\nwho \u2014 who thought Hitler was the last word and you know, this is \u2014 this 1s the new\nSiegfried, the \u2014 the hero of German mythology is going to \u2014 th-the vag \u2014 the Wagner\npeople, all this romanticism that really isn\u2019t romanticism, it\u2019s just pure Germanic.\nAnd those are the ones who Hitler really appealed to.",
        "A: Oh, interesting, yes. When my parents arrived here they immediately applied for\ncitizenship and it was a five year waiting period. Five years passed and they were\nMarch 10, 2001\ncalled before a judge and I re-remember going with them before the judge and the\nswearing in. And they were just thrilled, as I was, and \u2014 to become an American\ncitizen. This was a dream that had come true for them. And shortly thereafter, we \u2014\nmy brother and I became citizens by derivation. So we also were called and we were\nsworn in. And I, of course, have that certificate and it\u2019s something we\u2019re all very\nproud of, and we \u2014 listen, this country saved our lives. The fact that we got over here\nmay have been pure luck, or it may have been God\u2019s doing. I don\u2019t think it was that, I\nthink it was just plain luck and a little bit of fortitude and a little bit of courage on the\npart of my father, and seeing what was happening and \u2014 well, but to escape so many\ntimes from \u2014 slip though at the last moment, always the last to arrive before the doors\nshut, 1s something that amazes me. I am now probably the only survivor of my\nimmediate family because my brother passed away at 54, he had pancreatic cancer\nand died. My mother died in \u2014 when she was 90 \u2014 91 \u2014 90 years old. My father died\nof the Alzheimer\u2019s disease in \u2014 when he was 84. But I often ask myself, you know,\nwhy am I here longer than the other? Why ar \u2014 why aren\u2019t there more of us who\nmanaged it? But you -- when I think about some of the stories that you read about\npeople who don\u2019t believe or who refuse to accept the fact that there was a Holocaust\nat all, it\u2019s something that I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2014 number one, I don\u2019t understand it. Number\ntwo, I ga \u2014 these are the kinds of people \u2014 the kinds of people who \u2014 who \u2014 whose\nthought process 1s so shallow, the same one who Hitler was able to \u2014 to inveigle to\nMarch 10, 2001\nbring into his party. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s a horror and so anything that \u2014 you know, history\nis something that lives only with people who have lived it themselves. Those that\nhaven\u2019t, except for the few who educate themselves, who will read history and will\nbe able to understand it, for \u2014 except for those, people not only forget, but it has no\nmeaning for them. They read a history book. There was World War II, it lasted from\nthis date to that date. This 1s what s \u2014 took place, but 1t means nothing. It means\nabsolutely nothing. When I was a child I talked to my grandfather and I asked him\nabout World War I. My grandfather served in the German army in World War I, and\nhe told me stories. He told me the story one day of an airplane that came and dropped\ntwo bombs in Cologne, and I was impressed. But World War I had no meaning to\nme. Not from what was relayed to me. It meant nothing. World War II, yes, had\nevery meaning. I was too closely involved. You know, look at our children today.\nThey look back and they come to me and they want to know a little bit about World\nWar II, I can tell them certain things about World War II, but it won\u2019t have any\nmeaning for them. They are much closer to the last war we fought in, the desert or in\nperhaps Vietnam if they\u2019re a little older and went through that era. But even that\npasses, and if they don\u2019t inform themselves and don\u2019t reach back and read the history\nand in \u2014 get involved a little bit more closely into what \u2014 perhaps into people\u2019s lives,\nor into \u2014 there have been some wonderful books written about World War II. If they\ndon\u2019t read that, or if they \u2014 if you haven\u2019t read \u201cAII Quiet on the Western Front,\u201d you\nMarch 10, 2001\nwould not really understand the abhorrence of war that came out of World War I.\nAnd I think that\u2019s missing today and much of that is missing and it\u2019s too bad, it really\nis and I think this is the kind of thing that fosters the thoughts that the Holocaust\nnever happened. And it sure did. There was one other vignette that\u2019s rather\ninteresting. A few years ago, here in America, my parents were living in Florida and\nmy mother \u2014 I came down to Florida to go to attend an affair of some sort. I\u2019ve\nforgotten whether it was a formal affair or whether we were just going out for \u2014 for\ndinner. And I was over at her apartment, we were chatting and I was getting dressed.\nI was staying with her. And I had forgotten to bring my cufflinks. And I said, Mom,\nyou know, I don\u2019t have any cufflinks, did Dad have any? And she said yeah, yeah,\nwait a minute, I have something for you. And she brought out a pair of silver\ncufflinks. She said these \u2014 these will do fine. And I looked at them and I said, yes\nthey will, where\u2019d Dad get these? She said, well, it\u2019s an interesting story, I have to\ntell you about it. And she said, when your father was young, about to be Bar-\nMitzvahed, 13 years old, there was a \u2014 your grandfather, Arnold, rented a room in his\nhouse to a German soldier, an officer. And he used that room to entertain his\ngirlfriend. And he was a very nice gentleman and he knew your father was being Bar-\nMitzvahed, so he purchased those cufflinks for your father as a Bar-Mitzvah gift.\nAnd, she said to me, you\u2019d be interested in knowing the name of that German officer.\nAnd I said, yeah, well who was he? She said, his name was von Stauffenberg. And I\nMarch 10, 2001\nstar \u2014 I was startled; von Stauffenberg was the general who took part in the\nassassination attempt against Hitler in the latter stages of the war. So history touches\nyou, no matter where you are, at one point or another, and here in a pair of cufflinks,\nit reaches back and it touches you. And it\u2019s these kinds of stories that make history\nalive. I hope I can pass all these things on to my children that they\u2019Il remember it. I\ndon\u2019t know whether I \u2014 I have myself been back to Germany on several occasions.\nI\u2019ve been there on business and I\u2019ve met people in Germany. And you can\u2019t help,\nwhen you meet one of the older generation, my generation, you can\u2019t help but\nwonder where they were in those years between \u201938 and \u00b044, what they were doing,\nwhether they took part in any of the atrocities that were visited on the Jews. But you\nhesitate to ask. Maybe my parents weren\u2019t so afraid. Maybe they did ask, a few\ntimes. But I\u2019ve never asked. I\u2019ve met some of the younger people and they don\u2019t\nreally have a recollection of it, and in that case perhaps it\u2019s good for them, for\nGermany. One of the interesting trips that we recently took, we went a cruise and\nwound up \u2014 up in the \u2014 in the Baltic. And we would up in Rostock. And there they\nhad a bus trip to Berlin. Well, for the people who were on the cruise, and there were a\ngroup of Jewish people on the cruise who wanted to s \u2014 particularly see the\nsynagogue in Berlin. My wife and I didn\u2019t have an overriding interest to do that, but\nthey needed to gather enough people together to \u2014 to put a busload together and we\nvolunteered to join them. And so we went into Berlin.\nMarch 10, 2001\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: Right. So, as I say, we volunteered to go along with them, and we went into Berlin\nand we had a German guide, a young woman, very knowledgeable, who took us\naround and showed us the highlights in Berlin and the tour. And the tour a \u2014 the\ncenterpiece of the tour was going to see Checkpoint Charlie, and what used to be East\nGermany and the wall, this small section that they preserved for histo \u2014 for history.\nAnd very little was remembered by the guide of \u2014 or was told to any of us about\nWorld War II and what happened in Berlin during that period of time, period of\nyears. It was interesting observation for me, because the young Germans were more \u2014\nmuch more affected, and understandably so, by the separ \u2014 the \u2014 the separation of\neast and the \u2014 Germany and West Germany and the hardships that the eastern\nGermany \u2014 Germans experienced, and the fact that they were separated from their\nfamilies and couldn\u2019t see each other, and the \u2014 the wall and the suicides that resulted\nfrom that, or people who were killed trying to escape. And this was foremost in their\nminds, this was how horrible things were during those years. They didn\u2019t look back\nto World War II and what happened then. That was not part of their being, their\nMarch 10, 2001\nsubstance, their \u2014 their memory, and \u2014 except for one instance, which I found highly\ninteresting. She told us, the guide, that she was taking us to the university in Berlin.\nAnd we got out and there was this very large square, quadrangle in the center of the\nuniversity. And we marched out to the middle of this square and mostly cobblestones\nand in the middle was a square. I don\u2019t know, I would say it was the size of, oh,\nmaybe three meters by three meters, so about \u2014 roughly about thr \u2014 a little more than\nthree yards by three yards square, and glass, right in the ground. You kn \u2014 you know,\nit was part of the \u2014 the ground, it wa \u2014 it wasn\u2019t raised in any fashion. And she\ngathered everybody around this glass square that was cut into the ground and she\nsaid, would you please look down and tell me what you see? And we looked down\nand what we could see under the glass were empty bookcases around the square and\nshe asked whether we knew what that was. And of course being all Jews, many of us\ndid know exactly what it was. It\u2019s a representation and a memorial of the book\nburning, where the Nazis had burned all the books. An \u2014 and that that would be there\nin \u2014 at the University of Berlin, well I thought was extremely interesting. The fact\nthat she knew about it and that she was willing to tell us about it, even though it was\nnot on her tour and that she wasn\u2019t expected to show us this, was very interesting for\nus. Then we wound up \u2014 which they clearly avoided because they saved it for the last\npart of the day, we wound up at the Jewish synagogue there, which was burned by\nthe Germans, probably on Kristallnacht, and \u2014 and restored. Now it\u2019s no longer being\nMarch 10, 2001\nused as a Synagogue cause it was violated as religious ground. But we stood outside.\nThere\u2019s a museum right next door to it where we could go in for a few minutes and\nsee what there was, we really didn\u2019t have much time. But there were two plaques on\nthe outside of the synagogue explaining what had happened and how it was restored,\netcetera. And most of my fellow cruise members couldn\u2019t read German etcetera, so I\nwound up being the one who read the plaques for them and translated it for them, and\nthey were quite moved by it. And I was pleased to be able to open their eyes to this\nand to be able to read them. Now I think they were, strangely enough, more affected\nby it than I was, because I had been through it, I had seen it. I think it was more of a\nshock to most of these people this actually happened and that this is where it took\nplace and these are the \u2014 the memorials to it. So I\u2014I found that trip very enlightening\nand I guess more so from the point of youth that the Germans today are, just like\neverybody else in the world, they are obsessed with the history of today and not with\nthe history of yesterday.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: Well, I was an engineering student and I had at that time \u2014 during my time at\ncollege, the Korean war broke out. And we \u2014 obviously we wanted to f \u2014 at that time\nfinish our education, so we joined the ROTC program at college. And we finished\nour engineering degree and graduated as lieutenants in the United States Army and\nwent right away into service. We had an obligation to serve at least two years of\nactive duty, at which time \u2014",
        "A: This was 1953. \u201954, actually. And we \u2014 we thought we might be able to get a nice\nplush assignment, maybe go to Japan, which was very interesting, or I thought, my\ngoodness, you know, I\u2019m fluent in German, maybe they could send me to Germany,\nyou know, I could \u2014 would be a wonderful opportunity. Well, of course the United\nStates Army doesn\u2019t think in those terms. Nor did they know or did they think in the\nterms that I was an engineer, a graduate, they could have put me into any number of\npositions where that would have been useful. No, I was in the ordinance corps and I\nwas going to be \u2014 and I had that \u2014 you know, they had all these electronic things, they\ncould have easily put me into that and helped, but no, no, I\u2019m going to Korea and\nthat\u2019s that. So off we went, my brother and I both went to Korea. Fortunately we\nwent shortly after Eisenhower had made his historic visit to Korea and the war was \u2014\nthe fighting had stopped. And we were there just shortly afterwards. So the country\nwas extremely poor, Korea, and it wa \u2014 had been destroyed and we wound up at the \u2014\nMarch 10, 2001\nat an army depot near Incheon, [indecipherable] city. ? ve since been back and you\ncan\u2019t recognize it any more, the country has boomed economically and \u2014 of course\nnot in North Korea, but at least in South Korea it has. And we spent \u2014 I spent two\nyears there. My brother was stationed up on the DMZ, the demilitarized zone at the\ntime, and we\u2019d see each other occasionally, I would fly up with friends of mines who\nwere pilots and \u2014 and in \u2014 in the army. They would fly me up in these sal \u2014 small\nplanes and I\u2019d visit him or -- and he would return the visit. Sometimes we\u2019d \u2014 got our\nJeeps and drove up through these rutted roads and dust and \u2014 and it was a\u2014 it was a\nboring existence cause there was nothing to do, and Korea was cold and miserable.\nThe rats were the size of \u2014 well, pigs. They were huge, and you\u2019d live with them.\nThere were a lot of \u2014 there were a lot of people who had been displaced by the war, a\nlot of orphans in orphanages, which you know, just tore your heart out. And as\nsoldiers and as officers, we did what we could to help out these orphanages. We\ncollected from our troops and from the re \u2014 other officers to help these people, and\nthey were very grateful, they were \u2014 for everything that we could do there. They\u2019re a\ntough people, the Koreans, they really are and they manage to survive. But it \u2014 you\nreally \u2014 it was not the kind of service that I expected in the United States Army. I\nexpected, you know, World War II, you\u2019re going to go out, fight, right? But no, no,\nno, nothing like that. Met a lot of people and learned a little bit about the average\nAmerican, and how much \u2014 how important the average American is to America\u2019s\nMarch 10, 2001\nlife, and how basically good they are, despite \u2014 da \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter what their level\nof education is. It really didn\u2019t matter and there were people \u2014 I was \u2014 one of the jobs\nthat was assigned to me, I was a commander of a depot supply company there and\none of the other jobs I had was to \u2014 was for the education, I was the education officer\nfor the battalion and we had many, many sergeants, people who had worked their\nway up through the ranks, who barely had an education above a grade school level.\nAnd we furnished them with additional \u2014 with \u2014 with schools and tried to bring them\nand as well as many of the \u2014 the enlisted men up to at least a grade level or a high\nschool level education. But it didn\u2019t matter how educated they were, they were\nbasically very, very good people, very honest people. I had a group of sergeants who\nI got along with extremely, extremely well. They did things for me \u2014 at that time\nthere was absolutely no accountability for supplies in the United States Army. And\nwhen I was \u2014 when I signed \u2014 when I took over the command of my company, I\nsigned off on things I didn\u2019t know I had, or didn\u2019t know existed and \u2014 and when it\nfinally came time for me to turn the company over to the next officer that would take\nover, I had to do a \u2014 an inventory really, what th \u2014 what the heck did we have and\nwhat did I sign for, and you know, I\u2019m responsible for this, have to sign it back. And\nthere were \u2014 there was a Jeep in there that I remember that I never even knew existed.\nAnd \u2014 and we had \u2014 and we had some things that we had so much in excess of that it\nshouldn\u2019t have been there, but I se \u2014 I said to one of my sergeants, I \u2014 what \u2014 what\nMarch 10, 2001\nare we going to do about this, or where\u2019s this Jeep? He said oh please lieutenant, he\nsaid, don\u2019t worry about it, just bring the guy over tomorrow morning, we\u2019ll take care\nof it. So in the morning I came over with a new officer and I introduced him to my\nstaff and I said okay, would you \u2014 h-here is our inventory, would you sign off on it\nplease? And we start looking around and when he checked it off and we went outside\nand there is this Jeep sitting there and I look at the inventory list and the serial\nnumber, everything 1s just exactly the way it should be. And I said hm, I guess it\nmust have been somewhere, but \u2014 and the fellow signed off and everything was just\nperfect. And when he left I pulled out a bottle that I had there and I said, look\ngentlemen, the s \u2014 the sergeants \u2014 well, you know, I guess this is goodbye. I want you\nto have a drink and \u2014 and we exchanged pleasantries, had a drink and I said, now\nwait a minute sergeant, I said, where the hell\u2019d that Jeep come from? And he said sir,\nhe said, in about five minutes we have to return it to battalion A, and we\u2019ve got to\nrepaint the thing. So it\u2019s that kind of thing. Everybody would help everybody out.",
        "A: No, not at all, not at all. The way I saw and perceived the Germans were almost\nlike the \u2014 theatrical costumes, theatrical people. They were so outlandish in their\nstyle of dress with their epaulets and their \u2014 and their polished boots and their \u2014 you\nknow, you don\u2019t get this in the United States Army. I hope not, I hope we never will.\nMarch 10, 2001\nAnd it did not, it did n \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2014I never even thought of it in that fashion, never\nequated my service in the army with what \u2014 what I saw in Germany, never. So then\nwe were finished with our service in the army after 14 months, came back to the\nUnited States and I at that stage had a choice to make in my career as to whether I\nwanted to be an engineer for the rest of my life, or whether I wanted to try something\nelse. And I knew \u2014 had known really all along that engineering was not my calling.\nAnd Is \u2014I said, well you know, it\u2019s something I can always go back to. But I went to\nsee my father and I said dad, you know, can you get me a job with your company? I\nwant to get into sales or something where I deal with people. And just to see whether\nI like that. I can always go back to engineering. And he said sure, and he got me a\njob. I essentially went to work for my father\u2019s company. My brother, who graduated\nCornell as an electrical engineer as I did, was pretty close to being top in his class. I \u2014\nI was, I guess, the goof off and he was the one who a-applied himself. Not only did\nhe apply himself, he had a calling for engineering. He was a lot like my father, my\nfather always wanted to be an engineer and never had the opportunity. My brother\nhad the opportunity and made the most of it. He immediately went to work as an\nengineer when he got out of the army and wound up in the \u2014 in the optics field in\nengineering. Interestingly enough, one of the highlights of his career was that he\ntestified before Congress. Malcolm Wallop\u2019s committee, which at the time was\nlooking into the feasibility of space and using space for military purposes. And my\nMarch 10, 2001\nbrother, along with four other engineers, or three other engineers, I guess, were called\nbefore the committee to testify. They were known as the Gang of Four.",
        "A: And I have a book that actually states that. And I think he had a lot to do at that\ntime in persuading Ronald Reagan to go ahead with his space missile programs. So\nhere you have a young man who was brought up in Germany, who escaped with his\nlife testifying before Congress, I think it\u2019s amazing, and \u2014 that he accomplished all of\nthat. He was instrumental in designing the mirrors and the optics for the first space \u2014\nastronomical space obs \u2014 observatory, which they shot up into space, it worked very\nwell. He was working on the Hubble when he died and my nephews and nieces say,\nyou know, if Norbert had been around to finish that job with everybody, they\nwouldn\u2019t have had the trouble they did with the Hubble. Well, you know, that may\nbe, it may not be, who knows, but he \u2014 he spent his career doing that and was quite,\nquite proud of it, and he should have been.",
        "A: We kept up a relationship. Was it close? My brother and I are totally different\npersonalities \u2014 we were. And it was difficult for him to express his inner thoughts and\nto open up to people. And I think also difficult for him to open up his feelings toward\nme, or with me. We certainly kept up contacts through all those years. His children\nMarch 10, 2001\nare now as close to me as my own children are, particularly his son, who I think has\nmore in common with me than my own son. Their \u2014",

        "A: Not terribly much, no. I think he had his recollections and I had mine. No, I don\u2019t\nthink so. We \u2014 more \u2014 we kept up more with the kinds of things that happened later\nin our lives when we came to America. Our camp experiences and the time there,\nlet\u2019s say, perhaps the \u2014 some of the years that we spent in the army together. Not so\nmuch as to what happened in Germany and \u2014 and in \u2014 1n Holland prior years.",
        "A: Went to work, yes.",
        "A: I worked for my father and we \u2014 I was stationed up in Boston for awhile learning\nhow to become a steel scrap trader. And it was very difficult. I had problems dealing\nwith New Englanders because they were so difficult to talk with, you know, they\ndidn't open up. I \u2014 I think one of the things I learned there was that sometimes it\u2019s\ngood to keep your mouth shut. I never forget the time I had to persuade a New\nEngland scrap dealer to sell me a carload of scrap, because we were going to ship it\nMarch 10, 2001\noff to \u2014 on a ship com \u2014 sailing out of Boston. And he was selling all his scrap to a\ncompetitor. And so I went in to see him \u2014 Leroy was his name. And I said \u2014 I\nintroduced myself and I told him who I worked for and I said, I\u2019d like to buy your\nscrap and I gave him my sales pitch, this is what I want, this 1s what I\u2019m ready to pay\nfor it and I really would like to start and I hope you can give us a chance, and what\nhave you. And then I had made my pitch, I said, what do you think? And he didn\u2019t\nanswer. He just sat there. And for awhile I said to myself, well, should I say\nsomething, or shouldn\u2019t I? And I said, you know, I\u2019ve just said everything that I need\nto say. If he\u2019s not going to reply to me, just keep your mouth shut, sit. For once in\nyour lifetime, don\u2019t say anything. So I sat there what was an interminable amount of\ntime and I don\u2019t know how long it was, maybe four or five minutes or so, which 1s\nridiculous, you know, you\u2019re sitting there and you\u2019re wondering what you\u2019re going to\ndo, and beginning to sweat. Should I get up and leave, what? And he suddenly said,\nyup, okay. Now, I don\u2019t know what he was thinking about, I have no idea. And I\nwon\u2019t ever question it. But that was that, I said thank you and I left and I sent him the\norder and that was that. So I learned a lot from that experience. I stayed with that\ncompany, I wasn\u2019t happy there in New England, and moved back to New York and\nmet Ben Livingston, who was an elderly man, was my father\u2019s partner for some\nyears. And we \u2014 and I got into the import and export business in \u2014 in \u2014 in steel. It was\nin the new steel business. And in 1962 he retired from the company. And I know he\nMarch 10, 2001\nwas \u2014 he was not happy retiring, he was an active man. He was in his 70\u2019s, but\nwanted to continue to work, which is very interesting because I feel exactly the same\nway today and I\u2019m probably about the same age he was when he retired. And so, with\nmy father\u2019s help, I spoke with Ben Livingston and we put together three people and\nwe Said, let\u2019s go out in business and start the business. And I figured that Ben\nLivingston had a good reputation in the field. If he stayed active in the business for\njust three years, we\u2019d have enough grounding in order to be able to \u2014 to run the\nbusiness without him. Well, we did. We went out, found a small office in the Lincoln\nbuilding in New York and went to work with three of us, myself, an associate of\nmine and Ben Livingston, the younger associate. And we started to build the\ncompany. And in three years Ben Livingston showed no signs of retiring and he was\nas \u2014 he\u2019s \u2014 he was \u2014 h-he lived until he was 89 years old. He came into the office\nevery single day. He was no longer active in the daily trading, but he became a very\nclose friend of mine and we were able to talk to each other and pass information back\nand forth f-for \u2014 for many years. We \u2014 I finally took over as the president of the\ncompany and it was extremely successful, 1t worked out quite well. Into \u2014 one of the\ninteresting incidents I\u2019Il never forget with Ben Livingston, he was in his 80\u2019s already\nand found it difficult to get around. He was using a cane. He was a big man, heavy,\nand he would start losing some of his agility. And I was in the office talking to him, I\nwas going to take a trip to Argentina, a business trip and I sat down and I told him\nMarch 10, 2001\nwhat I was going to do, and how we were going to get around, we had a problem\nthere, and discussed the problem with him and how best to solve it. Suddenly the\nlights went out in the building and we were on the \u2014 that time on the 21 floor of the\nLincoln building. And I said okay, let\u2019s sit around, let\u2019s see what happens. And half\nan hour passed and the lights didn\u2019t come back on. And I said, you know,\nsomething\u2019s going on. We called up and we found out the whole east coast was\nblacked out. I don\u2019t know whether you remember the big blackout. And I said Ben, I\ndon\u2019t know whether we\u2019re going to get home. The trains aren\u2019t running, everything is\nclosed down. I just made a telephone call, the whole east coast is blacked out. I don\u2019t\n\u2014 can\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t think I can leave you here. And he said well, you know something, I \u2014\nif you'll help me I \u2014 let\u2019s go up to my club. He was a memory of the Harmony Club\nup on Fifth Avenue, which was up on 60\" Street. And I said, all right, come on, I\u20191l\nhelp you. And we \u2014 poor fellow, he walked down 21 flights of stairs with his cane,\nand we started walking uptown. It was an extraordinary night. You know, people\ndidn\u2019t know what was happening, it was the height of the Cold War, people thought\nthat the Russians were sending missiles over and bombing America and we were\ngoing to be attacked any moment, and there were all kinds of fears everywhere.\nPeople were praying, it was just unbelievable what was happening in New York City.\nAnd we were walking up Fifth Avenue, straight up Fifth Avenue. And Ben got pretty\ntired. We were up near 50\" Street and he was kind of exhausted by this time, and\nMarch 10, 2001\nthere was Saint Patrick\u2019s Cathedral right there next to us. And I said Ben, you know,\nwhy don\u2019t we go inside and sit down, you know, you can use a spell of rest, and I \u2014\nand he said you know AI, that\u2019s a good idea, let\u2019s go. So we went to Saint Patrick\u2019s\ncathe \u2014 Cathedral, which was amazing. It was lit up by candles and people, you\nknow, they were afraid, they didn\u2019t know what was happening and they were praying\nand 1-it was an extraordinary sight. And we sat down, we just sat and relaxed for\nawhile until \u2014 and I observed all this, the people crying, people in fear, people not\nknowing where they were going to go, people just resting like we were. And finally\nBen said okay, I think I\u2019m up to going a little bit further. And we marched from there\nthe next 10 blocks to get up to the Harmony Club. We walked in and he said, come\non up to the second floor. We went up to the second floor, wherever it was and there\nwere these huge leather chairs. And we just plopped down and he said okay, now\nwhat will you drink? And we had some scotch and really just enjoyed that evening.\nAnd eventually I think I found my way home by \u2014 I left Ben there, I knew he was\ntaken care of and I found my way home with a group of other guys in a taxi that\nnight. That\u2019s what I remember about Ben Livingston then.",
        "A: Yeah, the business was \u2014 went quite well for many, many years and in 1991 we\nhad some very bad luck, we \u2014 we had a \u2014 an operation with, or a \u2014 a joint venture\nwith an organization, we started a company in Puerto Rico with a man who would \u2014\nMarch 10, 2001\nwe thought we could trust and as often these things happen, we couldn\u2019t. The \u2014 the\ntrust was not \u2014 was not well placed, and we lost an awful lot of money na \u2014 in that\nparticular year, so much so that we had to go out of business [indecipherable]. And\nwe joined \u2014 we \u2014 what we wound up doing was set \u2014 discharging our employees,\nwhich I think was probably one of the most difficult things I\u2019ve ever had to do, let\npeople go, tell them that we just couldn\u2019t carry on. And we went \u2014 we joined a \u2014\nanother organization, Stemcor at the time, whom we sold ourselves to for practically\nnothing because they didn\u2019t believe we could do anything. So we said okay, we\u2019 ll\nmake a deal with you. Here\u2019s what we want to earn and if we don\u2019t earn it, you don\u2019t\npay us anything. So we were at risk and if we lost money we were prepared to make\nit up to them. And so we went to work for them and it didn\u2019t take very long, we hit it\njust right and in three years we had recovered practically everything we lost on the\nother company. It was \u2014 we did exceedingly well. And it came time to renegotiate the\ncontract and we renegotiated it and then \u2014 for two \u2014 for two more years. And then\nthey got kind of jealous by how much we were making, and you know, th-these\nthings happen. We got into arguments about why aren\u2019t you paying us and they\nwanted to create all kinds of reserves. Well, you \u2014 you \u2014 we\u2019re not going to pay you\nnow and we\u2019ll pay you later and we said no. And after two years we closed that up.\nActually, there was a lawsuit that resulted from the \u2014 the closing of the Livingston\norganization. The banks has lost some money in that transaction as well.\n89March 10, 2001\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nMarch 10, 2001\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: Yeah, so we \u2014 we were working for this organization, the name was Stemcor and\nwe had, when we joined them we did exceedingly well, we had renegotiated our\ncontract. And we were also involved at the time, together with Stemcor in a legal\nmatter, which stemmed from the old business. And I remember the president of that\ncompany, Ralph Oppenheimer came over to see me and we went to see \u2014 talk\nsettlement with the opposing parties, who were the banks. And the judge demanded\nthat we settle for, I think a million dollars was the settlement \u2014 would be. And I\nremember taking the train back with Oppenheimer from the \u2014 from the courthouse to\nNew York City. And he said, Alfred, you are going to pay your share of this. And we\nhad had an agreement that we would not, if there was such a situation we would not\nhave to participate in it. And I said no, we\u2019re not. We have an agreement and we\u2019re\ngoing to stick to our agreement. We stuck to ours, now you stick to yours. And he\nsaid well, you know, if you don\u2019t, I will not renew your contract. And I said all right,\nif that\u2019s the way you feel. So I\u2014I believe I said, that\u2019ll suit me just fine. You know, I\nwas sick and tired of that \u2014 running into that kind of an argument with him. And I\nkind of felt I must have a lot of my mother and father in me, because they would\nMarch 10, 2001\nhave done the same thing. They would have said no, a deal\u2019s a deal. Let\u2019s live by it.\nAnd so we left Stemcor. We then proceeded to have three more years with another\nBritish company where we managed for them the organization. And as of the\nbeginning of last year, Anita and I have been conducting the business on our own.\nWe \u2014 th-that business end that they didn\u2019t want \u2014 that they had to pull out of the\norganization because they had problems in Russia because of the economic problems\nthat the Russians had. So the English really said th \u2014 we need to get out, we need to\nhave somebody buy us out. And we couldn\u2019t find anybody to buy them out so they\ndecided well then we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll leave you and we\u2019 run it ourselves and maybe close\nit up, though I don\u2019t know what they planned to do with it. But we started our own\nbusiness as of the end of \u2014 at the beginning of this year. And we\u2019re \u2014 just the two of\nus are operating it. That\u2019s very, very \u2014 it\u2019s a lot of fun, and we enjoy it, it\u2019s our life\nand \u2014 and we continue to carry that on. That\u2019s been successful, so \u2014 you know.",
        "A: I\u2014no, not now. I did and \u2014 but it\u2019s been some years now since I\u2019ve done that. I\u2019d\nlike to take Anita to Germany, I\u2019d like to introduce her to the things that I saw and\ntake her to some of the places that I remember. Where my grandparents lived. The\nRhine where I went swimming, which I don\u2019t think you can do today. It\u2019s like putting\nyour silver spoon into a cup of coffee and watching it melt, you know. And of course\nMarch 10, 2001\nto Holland, Anita has been to Holland, I took her there. But I would like to do that,\nyes, an-and I will.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019ve had \u2014 this is my second marriage. My first marriage, I married in \u2014\nwhen I was quite young, 22 years old, 1953 and had two children and divorced after\n35 years of marriage, then married Anita after the divorce became final, about three\nyears later. And we\u2019ve been married now exactly 10 years, and happily so.",
        "A: Well, Andrew, who is now fif \u2014 44. And Nancy, who is now 42.",
        "A: And we have \u2014 I have five grandchildren. Andrew has three children, two boys\nand a girl, and my daughter has two children a boy and a girl and we love them\ndearly. Anita, my wife, has two children as well, and one of her children has four\nchildren and one of \u2014 and the other child just had his first. So we have 10\ngrandchildren altogether between the two of us. So there\u2019s a lot to be thankful for.",
        "A: Absolutely, I think I would be very different. I think that history and your\nupbringing, your experiences as a young \u2014 as a young man do form your later life.\nMarch 10, 2001\nYou know, you can\u2019t purge yourself of the knowledge and the feelings. They stay\nwith you all your life. And no matter how young you are when you experience these\nthings, they remain with you. They remain with you. I don\u2019t think that I would ever\nfeel entirely comfortable or at all comfortable in any place where Jews were looked\nat as inferior or being something less than what the rest of the citizenry of whatever\ncountry that is, was. I don\u2019t think that I would have formed my feelings of social\njustice if I had not gone through what I went through. Perhaps I would have. I guess a\nlot depends on the kind of education you have, on your parents and how they feel. I\nam enormously offended by people who unfairly oppress others in \u2014 in any manner,\nand object to it violently when I \u2014 when it\u2019s so. I \u2014 so all those things come from, I\nthink, my past. I have no patience for people who try to bully others in any shape or\nform. I think that also stems from my childhood. And I have a deep sense that history\nsomehow will repeat itself someplace in the same way, and my God, we have seen it\nin our lifetime. We\u2019ve seen the oppression that are visited on people everywhere in\nthe world. They may not be oppression of \u2014 of the Christians against Jews or \u2014 or the\nNazis against \u2014 committing genocide against any number of people. But you do have\nit, you have it \u2014 you had it in \u2014 in Bosnia very recently. You ha -- it\u2019s happening all\nover the world, it\u2019s happening in Indonesia now. It\u2019s \u2014 and I have no patience for\nthat. I \u2014 a-and \u2014 and I know what people come away with who live through such\ntimes. How we had it in our own hemisphere. Y-You do have to feel for the Cubans\nMarch 10, 2001\nwho were displaced by Castro. Certainly some of the things that happened to them\nwere totally unfair to them. So all those \u2014 all those things and how I feel about them\ncame about by what happened in my lifetime.",
        "A: I think them \u2014 that kind of militarism, certainly it exists. It existed in Russia under\nthe communist regime. It probably exists in North Korea today, etcetera. But it \u2014 it\nexisted in Germany in a very, very special way, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2014 1-it\u2019s exactly\nthe same thing. The Germans made a specialty of it, and they did so historically for\nmany, many, many years. I mean, you go back to Bismarck and even back further,\nthe \u2014 the Prussians and their \u2014 y-you can go back to \u2014 to Middle Ages and the \u2014 the\nGermans and their \u2014 their mythology of \u2014 was always the \u2014 the hero worship and the\nloyalty to \u2014 to anything but \u2014 but a democratic society. They just didn\u2019t have that in\nthem, they were \u2014 th-they \u2014 they were st \u2014 they were the strong, the \u2014 the people\nmade of steel, the ones who would show the rest of the world exactly how \u2014 how it\nwould operate and I don\u2019t know whether it was \u2014 1-it sort of looked Wagnerian. I\u2019m\nsure it is in many ways. German philosophy is replete with this sort of thing, of \u2014 of\nthe super race, which 1s what Hitler really played on. I don\u2019t see that elsewhere in the\nMarch 10, 2001\nworld, I am not seeing it elsewhere in the world. Sure, people think we\u2019re better than\nyou are. There\u2019s a group in the \u2014 in Africa, when one ethnic group tries to annihilate\nanother, sure they think they\u2019re better than they are, but they don\u2019t try to set\nthemselves up as a super race, as somebody that could dominate the world, and the\nGermans always managed to do that, or they have in the last 150 years anyway. Or\nmaybe not so right now, but they did before that. And so this militarism that I saw\nthere and experienced there, I think is unique, or was, at least in my view, was unique\nto Germany.",
        "A: No, no. Never thought about it. Never, never thought about it. We\u2019ve told our\nchildren what I experienced, but I think it was very, very far removed from their\nlives. Now \u2014",
        "A: Yes, she was. Nancy has talked at great length to my mother, and they were very\nclose. So she has had the opportunity to experience first hand from her, at least, or\nlet\u2019s say secondhand, what transpired, and I think it has affected her. Also, her life in\nIsrael, she has certainly come across many, many people who experienced much\nmore traumatic events than I did, and whether they were all relayed to her, or\nMarch 10, 2001\nwhether she learned anything from them, I don\u2019t know, but the opportunity certainly\nwas there for her to do so. My son I don\u2019t think really thinks about it. He knows that\nhis grandparents came from Germany, that they left on Kristallnacht and that they\nhad to get out and that many of the family was caught up in the Holocaust and lost\ntheir lives. But I\u2019ve never questioned him about it, how he things about it, and maybe\nI should, but maybe it\u2019s a failure of parenting on my part, that this is not such an\nimportant thing in his life or such an important thing in the grandchildren\u2019s lives. I\u2019d\nlike to make it that way but I\u2019m not sure that you can. I really don\u2019t think you can. I\nthink there has to be a \u2014 an interest and if that interest is spawned at some stage or\nanother by them, by their education or by what they experience, then it may be\nmeaningful and then they\u2019Il come and ask. One would hope they would, and I\u2019d be\nprepared, of course to discuss it with them in any way they wished. But I\u2019m not sure\nthat that will ever happen. It\u2019s not likely.",
        "A: Not at all. Not at all. I grew up in America. My \u2014 I feel as American as anybody\nwho has been born here. I don\u2019t feel German. People ask me where I\u2019m from, I\u2019m\nmore likely to say that I grew up in Forest Hills, I\u2019m not likely to say that \u2019'm from\nGermany. Sometimes when I\u2019m abroad and people ask me where I\u2019m from, I ee \u2014 I \u2014\nI might say that. I don\u2019t know why, I guess maybe it might impress the people that\nI\u2019m talking to, so it depends who the audience 1s and what I choose to let them know,\nMarch 10, 2001\nor if I feel it might make an impression, but 1t seldom makes an impression. I think\nthey are much more likely and \u2014 to look at America the way I did when I was a\nyoungster, and they idolize it. It\u2019s a culture that has, the American culture has \u2014 has\ngone all over the world, much, much more so than it was when I was in Germany. So\nwe Americanized the world. Well, that\u2019s a good thing.",
        "A: I don\u2019t harbor any anger at all in that respect, no. I understand that people go\nthrough \u2014 have different experiences. There are many Americans who have gone\nthrough very traumatic experiences of their own. May not be of the s-same nature,\nbut certainly they \u2014 not everybody lives an I \u2014 an idealistic life, they have their own \u2014\nthey have problems, etcetera, and they \u2014 they\u2019re very meaning \u2014 meaningful in their\nlives, just like my adventures in Germany, and my leaving was very meaningful in\nmine. So, do I have an a \u2014 do I have anger? No, none \u2014 none whatsoever, none, none.\nThe only anger that I harbor are those people who deny that it ever happened. And\nthose who by their ignorance want to propagate that sort of thinking. The Fascist\ngroups that arise, the intolerance that you sometimes see in people, that angers me.\nBut I think it angers many Americans, not just those who left Germany.\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: No, no, I didn\u2019t participate in any active fashion there. We saw what was\nhappening, of course, and I think we rooted for the right side, but aside from a\nrooting interest and a \u2014 a-and looking at some of the things that were going on and\nabhorring it, the \u2014 the \u2014 the standoff at the colleges and etcetera. These were \u2014 that it\nwas happening was probably very good for America, that it \u2014 that all this existed, that\nthat kind of discrimination existed here was not a surprise to me because I had known\nit existed, and here a country was going through it and was purging itself of it,\nhopefully. You see, I think the difference between American society and German\nsociety is that in Germany under Hitler, institutionalized discrimination and hate and\nmade it a government policy. I don\u2019t think that can happen here, not under our\nConstitution and under our laws. And not only can\u2019t it happen here, the country was\nfounded on the basis of exactly not allowing that sort of thing. The Constitution was\nwritten with this in mind, by people who were very farsighted, many years ago. This\nwasn\u2019t the case in Germany. So there\u2019s a tremendous difference here, there and \u2014 no.\nI don\u2019t \u2014 I really don\u2019t think that there 1s a parallel to be drawn between what has\nhappened here in the Civil Rights movement to what happened in Germany, there is\nno parallel.\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m a Jew. I believe that the state of Israel was a \u2014 was heaven sent for the\nJews all over the world. I\u2019m fully in support of a Jewish nationality and a state,\ntotally. I don\u2019t like what I see is happening. We can\u2019t make peace with our neighbors\nin the Middle East, which is a sad, sad state of affairs. I\u2019m concerned that there will\nnever be peace in the Middle East. There are just too many hatreds dating back too\nmany years that these things cannot be forgotten by the people who are involved in it,\nfor them. For the Palestinians, this is their Holocaust. May not be of the same\nmagnitude, but it\u2019s not any easier for them. And I don\u2019t think that the state of Israel\nhas done what it can to relieve that. I think they can do more. Now, whether the\nArabs will allow them, you know, these are the questions that are tearing at\neverybody today. You know, we can blame each other back and forth for a thousand\nthings and find all kinds of excuses why it isn\u2019t done, but some \u2014 somewhere,\nsomebody has to sit down with somebody in th other side and they have to talk sense\nto each other. And will that ever happen? I don\u2019t know. I sure hope it will and I\u2019m an\noptimist and I think eventually it may. Maybe not in our lifetime, but hopefully it\nwill, although, as I said before, I\u2019m an optimist there, but I\u2019m a pessimist as to\nwhether it\u2019ll ever happen.",
        "A: About what?\n100March 10, 2001",
        "A: I think these people epitomized the hateful Germans. Eichmann was a \u2014 a\nmurderer. So were so many others, so many who escaped to Argentina and lived their\nlives out in luxury in the \u2014 in the \u2014 the resort towns of Bariloche and in Montevideo\nand places like that. I am sorry that we couldn\u2019t put them all on trial the way we did\nEichmann. And do I resent those people? Yes, I do. I\u2019m sorry we can\u2019t put them all to\ndeath, even today. And if we find them, we should shame them in every way we\npossibly can, no matter how old they are. They murdered a \u2014 a whole people.\nGenocide. I have no patience for that. And if I harbor hate, it\u2019s against people like\nthat. People like Milosevic too, who was just a incarnation of a \u2014 of \u2014 of these types.\nThey should be put on trial as quickly as we can get our hands on them. Now whether\nthe world as a community can do that, who knows?",
        "A: Honestly no. My childhood from my \u2014 from my formative years was spent here in\nAmerica and didn\u2019t lose any of it. I was a happy child. I was \u2014 my family made sure\nthat I was secure, despite the fact of what we were living through. And despite the\nfact what I observed, I never, never felt a personal threat. So no, I didn't miss\nanything in my childhood.\nMarch 10, 2001",
        "A: Yes. It would be wonderful if all, or even any one of them took an interest in those\nyears, those very important years. Ill speak directly to them, you certainly came\nfrom at least one parent who lived through history. And it behooves you to know a\nlittle bit about your background and where you came from and why you are here at\nall, cause at any time in those early years, when I was younger than you are now \u2014 or\nmaybe not, maybe some of you are just about the age that I am now \u2014 that I was then,\nanything could have happened that it would have made life very, very different, it\nwould have \u2014 you would never have been born if it weren\u2019t for the fact that your\ngreat-grandfather had the foresight to find his \u2014 and the struggle and the ability to\nfind his way out of Germany. And there\u2019s another thing I think that you should\nremember. What happened then was the act of a government in concert with its\npeople. You have an obligation to look, and to take part and to observe your\ngovernment in action, to be certain that something like this can never happen where\nyou live. You have that obligation and you must use whatever effort you have, or\nwhatever influence you have to see to it that justice for all 1s a part of your life and is\na part of the national life wherever you may be living at. So do that.",
