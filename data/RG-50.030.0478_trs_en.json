        "Q: Good morning, Mr. Krasa.",
        "A: Good morning to you.",
        "Q: May I call you Edgar?",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",
        "Q: Yes? What -- what name were you born with?",
        "A: Edgar. And I always wondered where my German speaking mother came up with Edgar.\nAnd she said it was between Raoul and Edgar, so I said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you picked Edgar.\u201d",
        "Q: And your last name?",
        "A: Krasa, K-r-a-s-a.",
        "Q: Right. And where and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born in the German part of Czechoslovakia, in Karlsbad, call it Sudeten, too. And\nmy upbringing while we were there was in German language. Grade school started in\nGerman, and there was never any animosity among -- that I felt -- between the Czech and\nthe German population, and these were German Nationalists, but Czech citizens,\nCzechoslovakian citizens. And there was no friction between the Germans and the Jews\nuntil I think in 1930, when Hitler came to power, he started to demand of the leaders of\nthat German Nationals -- of those German Nationals, to start to agitate, and complain\nabout oppression by the Czechoslovakian government, and it -- and demand to be\nannexed by the Nazis. And by 1933, it -- three years later, it came to the point where my\nfather as a Jew couldn\u2019t make a living among those Germans. And he moved to Prague.",
        "Q: Can I -- can I go back, so we can go just a little bit more slowly?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What was the date of your birth?",
        "A: February ninth, 1924.",
        "Q: 1924.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. And do you remember growing up -- you -- you moved to Prague in 1933 --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Is that right? So do you remember growing up between 1924 and 1933 in --",
        "A: I do remember.",
        "Q: -- in Karlsbad?",
        "A: My father was born 1877, one of nine children, the oldest of nine children, six boys, three\ngirls. And I am so sorry that I never -- I didn\u2019t know his parents. But I never initiated\nquestions about them, and he -- neither did he. So I don\u2019t know what -- we found out in\nthe archives that his father was a -- had a small store in a -- in a very small town in\ncentral Bohemia. And -- so at age 16, he went to Vienna, to be able to earn some money,\nand he worked himself up to a tremendous position in a textile factory, to the point where\nhe supported his brothers to go to school, and accumulate a dowry for his three sisters. So\nin World War I, he must have been acknowledged by the military as a good\nadministrator, so he became administrator of a hospital in Karlsbad. And there he then\nlater settled. My mother, you didn\u2019t ask about her, but PII tell you anyway.",
        "Q: I was going to.",
        "A: She was born in -- in the German part of Czechoslovakia, and sh -- that family was\nreligious. Not fanatically, but Saturday was no work, I couldn\u2019t go to the barber, have my\nhair cut on Saturday. I don\u2019t remember, I -- they must have been kosher, but the father\u2019s\nside, the Czech Jews, they were very assimilated. They were aware of being Jewish, and\nif they weren\u2019t aware th -- of, this would have made them aware. But the Czech -- Czechs\nwere not antisimic -- not aggressively anti-Semitic. I think they handled the Jews in a\nway that they didn\u2019t know what they are, and how different they are from them, and kept\nthem a little at arm\u2019s length. And some would be very nice to you, and then when you\nturned your back they would say, there goes the dirty Jew. This kind of hidden anti-\nSemitism. But I never -- I never suffered by it.",
        "Q: Your mother was considerably younger than your father, am I right?",
        "A: 18 years younger, and how they met was that she was a born matchmaker, and she\nwanted him -- I don\u2019t know where she met him, she wanted him for a friend of hers. And\nwe met that friend later, and we discovered why he didn\u2019t marry her, she was very dull.\nAnd somehow -- he may have been attracted by a younger woman. I am too, but it\u2019s too\nlate for me. And so they got married, and settled in Karlsbad. But what happened with\nthis excellent job that my father had in Vienna, he saved a lot of money, which he lost\nwhen Austria lost the war. The money became devalued, and somehow he could not\nrecover from that. He --",
        "Q: You mean psychologically he could not recover? [indecipherable]",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what it was, but -- it\u2019s not nice to talk about your father this way, but this is\na matter of fact. He continued to live in the way he lived while he had the money, to I\nthink show in front of other people that he is -- is still up there. But he was very, very\nlower middle class I think I would say, to the point where Mother had to sublet rooms to\nearn some extra income. And then in 1933 we moved to Prague. He went first to look for\na [indecipherable] for a jo -- for an apartment, for a job, and then in October, we moved\nto Prague.",
        "Q: Wh-What was your relationship like with your parents? Were you close with them?",
        "A: Relationship was very good. I -- I started my memoirs by writing, I want this -- I\u2019m\nwriting this for my kids, not for -- for publishing, and thinking back of the relationship\nmy parents, from what I heard, had with their parents, and what my parents had with me,\nand the relationship, and how I was bringing up my kids, and how they bringing up their\nkids, should they laugh, or should I cry? It was -- it was a respectful relationship. Mother\nwas the boss. She was running the family and everybody else. And -- and she come and I\nwasn\u2019t there that minute, I had one coming like this.",
        "Q: She hit you, really?",
        "A: And the second time I was there when she called. I know my sons call their kids 10 times,\ncome, come, come. Then they give up and the kids don\u2019t come. If my wife is listening,\nshe\u2019s going to kill me for this statement. So -- and I discussed this with one of our\ndaughters-in-law, and she says, \u201cYou cannot touch the kids, because they become\nabusive parents themselves.\u201d I didn\u2019t become abusive, and I didn\u2019t become abusive to\nanybody else, and I still loved my mother, and respected her. And I think it made me a --\na straight guy.",
        "Q: Was she warm as we -- I mean, she could be strict, clearly, but was she also warm to\nyou?",
        "A: She was warm and witty, and -- and had many friends, and was liked by others.",
        "Q: So you liked her, also?",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "Q: And was your father, being so much older, was -- was --",
        "A: We had very little -- very little activities together. He went to work, and in the afternoon\nhe -- some of the people sat somewhere playing cards, he never did this. Me, what I did\nwith my kids, skiing, swimming, running, sports, o-or other activities. He was 45 when\nhe got married, and 47 when I was born, and at that time, 47, you were a settled person.",
        "Q: Did you eat dinners together?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Did you eat dinner together --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- did you eat all your meals together?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: And you were an only child?",
        "A: Only child. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so spoiled.",
        "Q: And did you have conversations at dinner, do you remember? As a little kid? Did they\nask you questions, and -- about school, and your friends?",
        "A: In -- opposite what\u2019s happening in England, we were not allowed to talk with a full\nmouth. So while you were eating, and you had the full mouth all the time, there was no\nconversation at the table.",
        "Q: Interesting. So it was very quiet.",
        "A: Yeah. But I -- I did not have many toys. I had one -- what do you call this horse? Rocking\nhorse --",
        "Q: Rocking hor --",
        "A: -- which also could -- you could take off this rocking part and then it was on wheels. And\nwe lived on a street that had a slope, we -- I took the horse up, and -- and rolled down.\nAnd I remember at one point one of the children wanted to have it, I don\u2019t know for what\nreason I wouldn\u2019t give it to him, my mother locked me up in the bathroom the whole\nafternoon as punishment because I was not generous enough. And when she had to go to\nthe bathroom, she went to the neighbor\u2019s bathroom. Very strict, but still lovable.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And loving.",
        "Q: Did you -- did you understand when you were young, before you left for Prague, that\nyour f -- your father -- you really didn\u2019t have a lot of money, but he was trying to behave\nas 1f he had money? I mean, did you understand that there was a f -- confusion?",
        "A: No. I found it out later from Mother.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: N-yeah.",
        "Q: So did you have a maid?",
        "A: We had a maid in the beginning, I remember, and that also had to -- that belonged to the\nstatus. We had to have one, and I remember one summer, she went home, her father\npicked her up with a horse drawn carriage and I went with them to spend some time\nthere, but I don\u2019t know how long. It was a short -- and vacations, while we lived in\nKarlsbad, I spend with Mother\u2019s family in -- nearby, it was 60 kilometers from Karlsbad.\nHer father had a liquor production, which her older brother took over, but her older\nbrother was only a half brother from his -- from her father\u2019s first wife, who died. And\nthen he remarried, and through the second wife he had four daughters.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: And one was a divorced lady, so she can co -- she maintained the household for the older\nbrother, whose wife died on diabetes. I remember her, she was a wonderful wife, but\nwhen I remember now what diet she kept, I don\u2019t wonder that she died early. I had only\none grandmother, of Mother\u2019s -- from Mother\u2019s side, the father died already and she died\nwhen I was three years. And the only thing I remember, she always wore an apron. And\nthe only sentence I remember that she said -- that I remember, was to my mother, \u201cDon\u2019t\nbeat the boy, he\u2019s such a wonderful child.\u201d So that means she started to punish me\nalready before I was three years old. She d -- do it to make a good guy out of -- or a\ndecent person out of me, I don\u2019t know, that was the method, maybe.",
        "Q: Do you remem -- do you remember being hit a lot?",
        "A: Not a lot, no, not a lot, but I had to obey on the second.",
        "Q: And mainly she would slap you in the face?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And the only time Father was hitting me was when I was writing, he insisted on beautiful\nhandwriting. He had two fingers on the right hand injured -- cut off, and in spite of it, his\nhandwriting was like printing. And he didn\u2019t know that there will be typewriters, and\ndictating machines, and computers, so not only should I have a legible handwriting, but\nhe said this 1s a show of character. So that was the thinking at that time.",
        "Q: So how -- so how\u2019s your handwriting now, is it good?",
        "A: Ah, ah, I can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t consider right now -- I -- I print well, I write legibly.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Even my wife will dispute it, but I write legibly, but I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t need it much.",
        "Q: Right, right. Was it a surprise to you that you were going to move to Prague?",
        "A: No, no, I understood that among the Germans the -- the political situation is not good,\nand that -- whether I knew it, it\u2019s because of financial, or economic reasons, or whether it\nis for political, I couldn\u2019t say now exactly what I knew, that we\u2019re moving because the\nGermans were not very good to the Jews.",
        "Q: And it was assumed that in Prague it would be better?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And so you were 11 years old when you moved in 1933?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Was it difficult to adjust?",
        "A: \u00b033 I was nine years old.",
        "Q: Nine, you\u2019re right, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s nine --",
        "A: That\u2019s -- just figured it out --",
        "Q: -- 1924 --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- yeah, no you\u2019re right, I was moving in some other direction. Was it difficult for you,\nwas the move difficult?",
        "A: No. We moved in October and didn\u2019t -- from September one, I went in Karlsbad, to a\nCzech school. That was only -- is about six weeks, but I learned some Czech.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And when I came to Prague, I adjusted.",
        "Q: Pretty good, huh?",
        "A: Yeah, I -- it was one talent I had was picking up languages just by hearing.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: But German and Czech are the only two languages I learned formally --",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Right.",
        "A: -- in schools, grammar, and --",
        "Q: Did you like school?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you have favorite subjects in school?",
        "A: That I don\u2019t remember. Favorite subjects, I was good at arithmetics, and -- and gym.",
        "Q: And gym, yes.",
        "A: But -- but I don\u2019t -- no, I couldn\u2019t tell you exactly that I liked any s -- any -- we had\nmusic, which meant singing the -- the how 1s it called? House -- house -- home -- home\nteacher. Home class, or whatever they call it now. The -- the main teacher, our -- for this\nparticular class. We also --",
        "Q: Oh, you mean a homeroom teacher.",
        "A: Ho-Homeroom, thank you.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Homeroom teacher. And he went with us, he progressed with us, he didn\u2019t stay in one --\nat one grade. He was very nice, and he played the violin, and with him we had the song. I\ndon\u2019t know how many hours a week, but there were hours of --",
        "Q: So you were taught singing? Or was this -- all students were taught?",
        "A: This -- it -- not from -- not -- we weren\u2019t reading music --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- we were just learning it from his -- following his violin.",
        "Q: And what kind of music were you singing, folk songs, or Czech --",
        "A: No, I think Czech -- Czech -- popular Czech songs.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So did you learn anything about classical music?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: No. And did you go -- there must have been concerts, and theater, and opera in Prague.",
        "A: That was later.",
        "Q: That was later.",
        "A: That -- that was later on, yeah. We went to the theater and operas for one Czech choral\n[indecipherable] or whatever it was called. We\u2019re standing in the National Theater, on the\nfourth balcony up, standing.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: A-And it looked so huge. And I don\u2019t know, in \u201994 -- 1994 or \u201895, we went there again,\nand we were -- could afford the orchestra seat, and it looks like it could reach to the last\nrow, it was so small, it was just very high.",
        "Q: Small -- that\u2019s interesting.",
        "A: So all these perspectives have changed since childhood.",
        "Q: Right. Now you were Bar-Mitzvah\u2019d.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: You were Bar-Mitzvah\u2019d in Prague --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- am I right? So that must have been 1935.",
        "A: Mother was dragging us -- I don\u2019t know whether every Friday, but definitely Saturday,\nFather and me to the synagogue. And seemed like an awful long morning, you know?\nAnd interesting that during Yizkor, the prayers for the deceased, the kids were sent out,\ncause they didn\u2019t have anybody deceased there, I think. So we were playing outside, there\nwas a -- a little wooded lawn area in front of the synagogue, and we were sent out, it was\na break. But I never became very religious. I -- there is a feeling of God that she instilled\nin me, and when we get later to these various stages of the Holocaust, it varied in several\ndegrees.",
        "Q: But you said your mother dragged you and your father to the synagogue.",
        "A: Not dragged, she didn\u2019t drag, she said, \u201cWe are going to the synagogue.\u201d And nobody\nopposed her, you know?",
        "Q: I see. But is it -- it isn\u2019t something that necessarily you would have done on your own, or\ndo you think you might have?",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t think I initiated the -- or had the desire to initiate --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- to go to -- to synagogue, or -- I like the -- I liked Purim because they were throwing\ncandies to the kids, and like -- but I was not especially enthusiastic.",
        "Q: And who trained you for the Bar-Mitzvah, do you remember?",
        "A: Yes, I remember him, and I remember his daughter, the -- the Cantor in our shule, I went\nto his house, and he taught me, and later on we were very close with his daughter in\nIsrael.",
        "Q: And did --",
        "A: Shapiro was his name.",
        "Q: Shapiro, Cantor Shapiro.",
        "A: And I -- and I don\u2019t have a good memory for names. I never forget a good looking face,\nespecially on a woman, but the names I do forget.",
        "Q: And did you enjoy being trained by him? Was this something that was interesting to you?",
        "A: You\u2019re asking difficult questions. I don\u2019t know well -- whether I enjoyed it. I know I had\nto go, so I went.",
        "Q: So you went.",
        "A: But it was not, I think a favorite activity that I would had sought on my own.",
        "Q: Do you remember the service?",
        "A: Yes, it was -- was very good, but I don\u2019t remember --",
        "Q: You remember your haftorah?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: But I don\u2019t remember whether and where and if there was a -- something like a party or\nso. I -- no, there were no parties, there were family members and friends were coming,\nand I think it was in my mother\u2019s house, some cake she baked, and coffee she made, and\nthat could have been it. And funny, much later in -- about five, six years ago, I found out\n-- you must have heard of Arnost Lustig?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Living in Washington. He went to the same school, I think two grades lower, and their\neconomic situation was very similar to ours. And he told me, I never knew that, that my\nmother gave him my Bar-Mitzvah suit to wear for his Bar-Mitzvah.",
        "Q: Interesting. And you didn\u2019t know, or you don\u2019t remember?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know that she did, and I -- if she -- if I knew I may not have remembered it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: In -- I remember behind our house in Prague was a sports -- like a stadium, but it was just\na fence and some benches around for the workers -- workers -- sports -- workers sports\nassociation. And we played some soccer there, and in winter they poured some water on\nit, and it was a skating rink. And there was a big hill behind the house and it was -- kids\nwere roaming there. So that was a --",
        "Q: Now, how are things for you in Prague in 1935? This is two years after Hitler has taken\nover Germany, and things must be happening in Czechoslovakia, or didn\u2019t you feel that?",
        "A: \u00b035, nothing happened. I -- as I mentioned, I went to school, and I had no problems\nanybody, anything, except I said there were very few Jews, and there were no Sunday\nschools. The religion was taught once a week, and a rabbi, a priest, and a minister came,\nand in different classrooms, religious education was conducted. But I can only speak for\nthe Jewish education. We learned about the holidays, we learned to read the Hebrew\nalphabet. And at the end of the school year, the upper class dropped out -- it was for all\nthe grades, kids of all grades together. So the upper classes dropped out, a new one came\nin, and we started from the beginning. So I knew very well the holidays, and the alphabet,\nand it was very repetitive. But this was the -- and the religious [indecipherable] the\nCatholic, Protestant and the Jewish were state -- the rabbi was a state employee, the state\nfinanced, but they did not interfere with -- with religion. But it was th -- there were no\ncongregations, or in congregations, dues and fees. You went to whatever synagogue you -\n- you wanted, but you went to the one nearest to your house.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And as I said, was state supported, and so I don\u2019t think there was a great pressure for\nhigher education, in the religious --",
        "Q: Did you have Jewish and non-Jewish friends? Do you remember?",
        "A: Yeah, I had Jewish friends, and I had non-Jewish friends. There were some favorites in\nthe classroom, and the most favorite one I met 1998 in -- in Prague. He\u2019s older now, he\u2019s\nold as I am. But I remember his face so I could ma -- I would recognize him. And looking\nback at the class picture, I recognized several, which means I must have been close, or\nclose with them.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The other faces mean nothing.",
        "Q: We\u2019re going to stop the tape now.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: Edgar, are you -- this is 1935, a little after your Bar-Mitzvah. You were -- you were\ntalking about Arnost Lustig, who had told you that your mother had given him your jac --\nyour suit for his Bar-Mitzvah. Are you conscious of what\u2019s going on in Germany? Do\nyou hear discussions about the Nazis taking over, and what they\u2019re doing? No.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- these difficult things, so I --",
        "Q: And in school --",
        "A: -- I was sheltered from that part of knowledge.",
        "Q: Right. And in school the kids were not talking?",
        "A: No, the only thing -- the only thing that was different in school, after gym, if you took a --\na shower, they all came to look at me, because in Europe, only Jews you get circumcised.",
        "Q: So they all looked at you?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: They all looked at you?",
        "A: They -- no, not all the time --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] right, right.",
        "A: -- at least until they got a good look. So --",
        "Q: Did they say things, or they just wanted to --",

        "A: I told you about the economic situation?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I did, in addition to running my rocking horse, there were a lot of Jewish stores where I\nwent in the afternoon, helping out. There was a -- I don\u2019t know for what purpose, right\nnext door in the basement they were washing bottles, recycled bottles, I think for wine, I\ndon\u2019t know. I was working there, and getting some money. I was delivering with a two\nwheeler, like they have on the market, you know, the -- the za -- vegetable people, a two\nwheeler, deliveries from another store to different people. I was in a --",
        "Q: You mean a two wheel bike with a basket?",

        "Q: Uh-huh, oh I see. Uh-huh.",
        "A: And -- and in another s -- I was helping -- this was a leather -- leather store, raw hides, to\nshelve them and -- and stock -- like a stock boy. In another textile, it was the cleaning up.\nI always got some money, and I remember one store where they gave me some money\njust to get out of there.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I --",
        "Q: But you were a kid.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you were -- wa-was this a typical thing for kids to be doing?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know about any others, but --",
        "Q: And you were earning some money?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you do this a -- do you remember, did you do this on your own, did you decide you\nwanted to do this, or did s -- did your parents --",
        "A: Yeah, it was -- 1t was fun for me to go be among other people and do some work.",
        "Q: So did you continue this --",
        "A: I was -- all my life I was said I\u2019m good with my hand, I was told, use my hand, so --",
        "Q: So you kept doing it.",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: And wa -- what\u2019s the difference, do you think?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think there was a opportunity to that -- in -- in Karlsbad, these were friends of --\nfriends of my parents, maybe they did it just to let me earn some money, or whether they\nreally needed me, I don\u2019t know. But I -- I did -- I did work, and I did some active\nparticipation in the stores.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re going on, you\u2019re 13 years old, you\u2019re 14, you\u2019re 15, right? And life is pretty\nmuch the same, I gather. Now --",
        "A: Yeah, the -- I -- there 1s not -- there were not main -- I can\u2019t remember anything that\u2019s\nworth mentioning, that happened in those years, until ?38, in -- that would be worth\nnoting down, not the --",
        "Q: Well when -- when -- when do you become an apprentice cook?",
        "A: In 1938, it came so far into th -- the pure remember or [indecipherable] with the help of\nBritain and France, the -- they supported the Germans, that the Czech government gives\nup that border area where the majority of German Nationals were. There was a -- a non-\nageression agreement, France and England on this side of Germany, Czechoslovakia on\nthis side, should any -- should one be attacked, the others would assist. And at that time,\nChamberlain and Daladier decided -- I don\u2019t know whether decided, they thought if they\ngive in this little bit to Hitler, they avoid World War II. So not only was, in September\n\u00b038, this border area occupied by the Nazis, they also came beyond the Czech\nfortifications which they had on the border, against the Germans, so now they were\nstanding there naked, without any fa -- without any safety, security or fortifications. So it\nwas anticipated that Hitler\u2019s appetite will grow to the point where he will occupy also the\nCzech lands. And the parents of Jewish teenagers encouraged their kids to learn a trade,\nshould immigration become necessary, they can support themselves with work of their\nhands in a country whose language they don\u2019t know. And then aunt of mine told my\nmother, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have the boy become a cook, so he never has to go hungry?\u201d\nThere was no discussion of -- Mother agreed, so that that was it.",
        "Q: No discussion with you [indecipherable]",
        "A: No discussion about this.",
        "Q: Had you been in the kitchen, did you cook at all, at your house?",
        "A: I -- y-yes, I did, when Mother on her Yahrtzeit went to her 60 kilometer distance town, to\nthe -- her parent\u2019s grave, I cooked for my father. He wasn\u2019t able even to make a cup of\ntea for himself.",
        "Q: And you felt comfortable --",
        "A: I was seven, eight years old, and I --",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: -- was -- simple, preparing the me --",
        "Q: But you felt comfortable in the kitchen?",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I feel comfortable in any room.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Some more than others.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: So -- but that -- I don\u2019t think that had anything to do with it, it was -- she suggested it,\nand I -- her butcher told her about the little buffet, you know, you -- you come in, there\u2019s\na counter with those hot meals, and he suggested I should start my apprenticeship in a\nsmall place, where I get exposed to everything. So I got exposed to bringing coal from\nthe bay -- from the cellar, not only to the kitchen, but also to the third floor where his\nwife lived, where wi -- they lived, and taking down the ashes, and the -- whether they\ndidn\u2019t have yet -- they must have had, but they didn\u2019t use them, vacuum cleaners, so I\ntook the carpet down, and in the yard was a -- a beam, put the carpet over, and by hand\nyou bang it, there was a -- I don\u2019t know whether you ever seen one, it\u2019s a big antique\n[indecipherable] now. I beat the dust out of the carpet, and bring it up. When she went to\nthe market I went behind her with two bags. And I came back in time to go -- opposite\nwas the police station, a theater, and the director or the whatever you call it, of the\nrailroad. And in Europe, it\u2019s fanizer. I remir palladucks.. At 10 o\u2019clock you have a\ngabelfruhstiick, a breakfast with a fork, but you eat it with a spoon, because it consists\nmainly either of goulash soup, or tripe soup, which is a delicacy, I can\u2019t find tripe, they --\nthey don\u2019t -- I love it. Anyway, so you had two carriages, and there were little poles -- but\nthey were not poles like this, but they were like -- like a cup, a large cup, and I went to all\nthese three offices, deliver the soups, just in time to come back at noon to wash the\ndishes, there were three tables in that -- opposite the counter where some workers, or\npeople came and consumed their meal there. So just came back to wash the dishes, and\nthen clean up the -- the kitchen and the floor, and the -- so that was my exposure.",
        "Q: But how old are you, 14?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: 1938 --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- you're doing this, and you\u2019re not going to school?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Was that because you stopped school, or because you weren\u2019t allowed to go to school at\nthis point?",
        "A: No, the school system was such -- there were five grades in grade school, and then you\nhad three compulsory and a fourth voluntary school, it was called -- I don\u2019t know how to\ntranslate it, and it was a -- a public school, it would be equivalent of middle school or\nhigh school here. And then there was a Gymnasium where you had to make an entrance\nexam and pay. That was private and you had to pay. O-Of course I didn\u2019t qualify -- I may\nhave qualified with the exam, but I didn\u2019t qualify with the payment. So I made -- I had\nthe three -- three additional years through the five grades schools, and then came the\ndecision about learning the trade. And so it reminded me of stories that I read. The\naristocrats in central Europe, the Germans, or -- they had the mansions, or castles, and\nthey had over there cooking staff, including pastry chefs and so. And every apprentice\nwas stuffed. Eat, eat, eat. So he gets -- he gets fed up with it, and then he eats very little,\nso he won\u2019t be too expensive by consuming a lot of food later. And this guy tried me on\nplum dumplings. Eat, take, eat, eat. And I ate 79 of them.",
        "Q: 79?",
        "A: 79. But there were 79 pits that I had to spit out, so it was less in -- in actual weight and\nvolume.",
        "Q: In one sitting?",
        "A: In one sitting, and he told me right after that, tomorrow you don\u2019t have to come any\nmore. So -- so I wouldn\u2019t say anything at home, I left at six in the morning, like I will --\nwould go to work.",
        "Q: So he fired you --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- because you did what he said?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: He said eat as much as you want.",
        "A: Yeah. And then he saw it\u2019s too expensive, so --",
        "Q: I see, okay.",
        "A: I left every morning, hunting jobs. I sat -- till eight o\u2019clock I sat in a park, and by eight I\nwent to different restaurants to ask if they need an apprentice. And one day I come home,\nFather sees me in the door, and that\u2019s the other time, besides handwriting that he gave me\na shot. He said, \u201cYou were fired, and you didn\u2019t tell us.\u201d [indecipherable] Luckily on that\nday I found a job. Well, how did he find out? In -- you had to -- I think it was in\nGermany, it was also before the war, in Czechoslovakia that everybody had to be\nregistered at the police station. And when you moved, you had to unregister here, and\nregister there. And we had again, borders, and he went to the police station to register a\nborder, and the waiter\u2019s apprentice came with the soups, and he asked, \u201cHow is Edgar\ndoing?\u201d He says, \u201cI don\u2019t know, he isn\u2019t working a week already, he was fired.\u201d So that\nhe didn\u2019t tolerate, he thought I did something bad. And he first hit and then he asked the\nquestions, that was the system.",
        "Q: He hit first --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- and then he asked.",
        "A: Then he asked.",
        "Q: Did that -- did that hurt you -- I -- I mean, physically it may have hurt you a little bit, but\ndid it hurt you --",
        "A: No, it didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: It didn\u2019t.",
        "A: I -- I felt -- I felt I deceived him by not telling them.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But I didn\u2019t feel bad because I already had a job in a --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- new restaurant, that\u2019s why they needed somebody, it just opened. And it was a\ncombination food establishment. From the street you walked in, and it was the second\nonly in Prague like a semi-self service. You took the tray, and you paid, and you walked\namong -- but there are people behind the counter who gave you what you wanted, and\nyou pay at the end of the counter. And then there was an excellent restaurant, first class\nrestaurant in the -- you walk through a passage, and inside was the restaurant, and up on\nthe -- what here is the second floor, were function rooms. And I learned everything from\nslaughterhouse to fine pastry. It was an excellent restaurant.",
        "Q: Why did they take you, do you think?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Why --",
        "A: Because they just opened, and they were looking for help.",
        "Q: And they were looking for people.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Now, was this a typical way for a -- someone to just decide they\u2019re going to be an\napprentice, and you don\u2019t necessarily apprentice with one person, you apprentice within\nan institution of some kind, you know?",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t know how others decided. They may have inclination for cooking, or\nnecessity, or I d -- I don\u2019t know why others started their apprenticeship. So -- and I\nmoved -- as I said, I worked in the slaughterhouse, I learned to skin cattle, and I --",
        "Q: And who killed them?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Who killed the cattle?",
        "A: Oh, somebody went around --",
        "Q: Somebody --",
        "A: -- with a -- was a -- not a gun, but was something he had in the hand, he pushed the\nbutton and shot the cattle in the head. And it was not kosher, so I learned everything and I\ndon\u2019t know -- now when I pick up a 30 - 35 pound luggage going to the airport, it seems\nvery heavy. I was carrying whole quarters of beef to -- in the -- in town was a\nmarketplace where in the basement, the whole basement was refrigerated. And because\nmeat and beef was not as tender as we have here -- now here, beef is fed with corn, and in\nsix months it\u2019s big enough to be slaughtered. So it means you have tender -- young,\ntender meat. There, it took much longer with grass and hay to feed the cattle, and -- so it\nhad to age. It was hanging three weeks in that uniform temperature. And when you were\nable to scrape off the moss from the meat, it was the right age. And I was on a spiral\nstaircase, I was carrying down whole quarters of beef, I don\u2019t know how I did that.",
        "Q: And you were a kid, too --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- you were not an older guy. Huh.",
        "A: And -- okay, and then the next station was soup, with a soup chef, and then with a\nvegetable chef. And I remember for the soup, he was a young guy, but he was -- he was a\nnasty guy. But not because I was Jew, he was nasty to everybody. I had to cut for soup,\nso there were kettles where they were boiling all the bones, and all the meat that you cut\noff the ends, and what you didn\u2019t want on the portion to be served, and vegetable, and all\nthe -- the peels of the onion, which gives good color to the soup. And as a filler for some\nsoups, was a small dice of vegetable, carrots, celery, theirs was the root celery, and\nparsley and had to cut those in uniform dice by hand, and when I had about this much in a\npot, he came and looked through it and if wasn\u2019t uniform, he threw it in the kettle, and I\nhad to start again. And it -- it 1s a -- it is a good method, you don\u2019t want to work\n[indecipherable] while you do it. You learn to do it perfect. It\u2019s like this, you know, you\nremember it.",
        "Q: Right. So how long would you be at each station learning? When you learned soup --",
        "A: This I don\u2019t remember. Then the grill, and the roast, and then the -- well, braising, you\nknow, because the meat was not as tender as this meat, and in spite of aging, for steaks,\nonly the tenderloin and the sirloin was used. The other pieces were not suitable. So these\nwere -- there\u2019s a goulash and butt roast, you know, braised with -- with gravy. So that\nwas the station where I worked. And of course, not just the beef, there were pork and\nlamb and fish. Yeah, after the slaughterhouse, I was in the basement working with two\nbutchers. They were from those quarters preparing a portion size, whether it was a roast,\nor whether it was steaks to be cut. I worked there before I got to the soups. And then the\nsalad department, and then the pastry. And the pastry was a pastry chef, and a female\nhelper, and she loved me. I was lucky with women. No, she was very nice, she covered\nup for my mistakes, and you know, we were making like a -- a sponge cake, but a little\ndifferent, from 80 eggs. So if you spoil 80 eggs, it was -- labor was cheap that time, and\nfood was expensive. Here it\u2019s different. So she was nice to me, and -- and on the salad I\nworked in, they were th -- the salad was not just salad, it was decorative items like fish in\n-- in aspic, and gelled, and -- a first class place. And -- yeah?",
        "Q: About how long did the ho -- the whole apprenticeship last? Six months, a year?",
        "A: No, the whole apprenticeship went on till spring of 1941.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. One day a week -- I worked six days, and one day a week I went to vocational\nschool where -- that was compulsory, to learn hygiene, and -- and about the foods, about\nthe [indecipherable] and a description of handling, why this way, why that way. And\nwhen I came from school at four o\u2019clock, five o\u2019clock, I had to change into uniform and\nhelp serving dinner. So --",
        "Q: So you worked six days a week?",
        "A: Long days.",
        "Q: Long days.",
        "A: Long days.",
        "Q: One day a week to school.",
        "A: No, work was five days, plus that evening after school, and I had one day off.",
        "Q: And you had one day off. So --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So from 1938 until 1941 --",
        "A: From fall of \u201938 until spring of \u201941 --",
        "Q: \"Al.",
        "A: -- there were two and a half years.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re still being an apprentice?",
        "A: Oh yeah, it was a four year apprenticeship.",
        "Q: Huh. And as a -- at a certain point do you get a particular specialty that you work on more\nthan others, or you keep working at each of these stations?",
        "A: First to learn, you move around, and then if the apprenticeship from the soup post was\nsick, so they took one [indecipherable] and you moved around, and you were able to\nsubstitute in every department. And there was no anti-Semitism. All the time -- in \u201941, the\nowner -- there were two owners, one was more looking at the kitchen, the other one was\nlooking at the other areas. And he was very nice, and he came and said he\u2019s under great\npressure to let me go, and he didn\u2019t expl -- didn\u2019t have to explain to me why, I knew. And\nat that time I couldn\u2019t get a job any more in another restaurant. Now, we were at ni -- it\u2019s\n\"41, you pushed me too far ahead.",
        "Q: Yeah, I did -- yes, I was going to go back now.",
        "A: Six months after the occupation of --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] 1939 March",
        "A: -- the Sudeten, they occupied -- came and occupied the Czech lands.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And [indecipherable] ends, it\u2019s the area of today\u2019s Czech Republic. The Slovaks had a --\nat that time already, a Fascist government, which cooperated with Germany, and were not\noccupied. So --",
        "Q: When does occupation happen in --",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: When does occupation happen?",
        "A: March 15\", 1935 -- ?39. And immediately thereafter they started to apply the -- what they\ncall the Jewish laws, which were actually anti-Jewish laws. I think you have knowledge\nabout them -- about those --",
        "Q: Tell me -- tell me what you remember.",
        "A: The first thing was to identify the Jews, although they ar -- physically identify, and\nphysically and visibly identify, because they had at the police records they had all the\nJews, because at the time you had to give your religion -- I don\u2019t know for whatever\npurpose, but to -- at the police station your registration was your religion known. So the\nfirst thing came this yellow star to wear. And you had to wear it on every piece of\noutwear, so if you took your jacket off, you had to have one on your shirt. And then,\nturning in all the valuables, including wedding rings, which I guess the Germans used to\nfinance their war efforts. Then a radio, so you can\u2019t listen to BBC. Everything was dual\nintent, for the Germans to enrich themselves with those items, and the second purpose\nwas to deprive the Jews of whatever gave them pleasure or resistance. So the radios, so\nyou couldn\u2019t listen to BBC, and then musical instruments had to be turned in. And then\ncame restrictions to travel, you couldn\u2019t go out, get out of your town. [indecipherable]\nYou could not enter public areas like movies, theaters or parks, playgrounds. And Jews\ncould travel in the streetcar only in the last car, on the last platform standing. And there\nwere many more -- oh, ration tickets were issued. There were three kinds of -- for the\nGermans, they were -- we were already somewhat restricted because was a war economy.\nThe Czechs got less, and the Jews got almost a blank paper. And if you were caught with\nsomething that you could not have -- that was not on those tickets, it was -- this was\npunishable. So my parents had my food ration ticket, because I ate at the restaurant. And\nthey get -- had 50 percent more of almost nothing, that\u2019s -- how much that is, I don\u2019t\nknow. Mathematician has to figure that out. But they were better off than some other\npeople.",
        "Q: We -- we\u2019re going to need to --",

        "A: Again? I didn\u2019t see him touch you.",
        "Q: Again. Ah, he didn\u2019t.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: We were talking about the fact that your parents had your r-ration, and you were saying --",
        "A: Food ration tick -- yeah.",
        "Q: -- food ra -- yes, which was 50 percent of nothing, right? But let me -- let me -- let me go\nback before we go forward a little bit. Do you remember the day that the Germans\nmarched in to Prague?",
        "A: Yes, I was standing 1n the sidewalk in my cook\u2019s uniform, horrified to see them. They --\nthat restaurant was on the main --",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: -- through road in Prague, and that -- approaching through there. Everybody was --\npeople were crying, and --",
        "Q: So the Czech -- the Czechs were not like the Austrians?",
        "A: No, definitely not, but there were some who very soon adapted themselves to raising the\narm, and -- yeah, you know, I think the Czechs had the -- I don\u2019t want to sound 1m --\nmissing the right word, but it doesn\u2019t matter. They were not deeply involved in anything\nspiritual, I mean, they were 400 years under the Austrians, under the Hapsburgs before\nWorld War I, then for 20 years -- and they tolerated it and cooperated, and they had to\nlive -- make a living. Then for 20 years they were free, from eight -- 1918 till \u201938, and\nthere were great Czech patriots. And when the Germans occupied, many became\nsympathizers, and collaborants -- collaborators. Then there were again great Czechs after\n\"45. There were fighters for Czech freedom 10 minutes before the war ended, and -- not\n10 minutes, two days. And then the Communists took over, they became the great\nCommunists. And in 1989, the biggest Communists, who were Etta Truff, and -- made all\nthe money and stole all the money, they were the ones, the first ones who privatized state\nenterprises. And with their Communist connections, they got it for almost nothing, and\ntoday they\u2019re millionaires. So they can adjust in the [indecipherable] so, any condition.",
        "Q: And were you frightened when you saw the Germans come in, the Wehrmacht come 1n?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know the full future impact of -- you know, the Germans now occupied the\nCzech lands, that -- that I knew is -- isn\u2019t good. But the full range of impact on the Jews, I\ndid not know, I didn\u2019t -- I knew that Jews in Germany are persecuted and all that, but it\nsomehow didn\u2019t sink in immediately, I am in danger.",
        "Q: And in fact you\u2019re -- from \u00b038 until \u201941, you\u2019re still in the same place.",

        "A: For me, no. For me, not much has changed, no.",
        "Q: Do you think that things changed for your parents more than they changed for you during\nthat period?",
        "A: I -- 1am sure now -- shopping hours were I think twice a week, or three times a week\nfrom five PM till six, or from four PM till six, when everything was already sold out. So\nthere were the --",
        "Q: You mean shopping hours for Jews?",
        "A: For Jews, yeah.",
        "Q: So what did you think, as this young boy, being an apprentice, watching the different\nrestrictions being made, and have to wear -- did you -- you have come to work with a\nJewish star --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. But nothing else affected me, because I didn\u2019t have time to go to movies, and\n-- and I didn\u2019t have time to listen to the radio, and I did not have a musical instrument\nthat I had to give up. So I was not -- I didn\u2019t feel affected negatively.",

        "Q: Only on the street.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Huh. And did you begin to feel something in -- when you were in the back, working with\nthe other pe -- were there other Jews?",
        "A: No, no, the --",
        "Q: You were the -- were the o --",
        "A: No, I was the only Jew.",
        "Q: You were the only Jewish person?",
        "A: And they didn\u2019t look at me, and -- because we didn\u2019t go to the gym.",
        "Q: But they knew you were Jewish?",
        "A: But they knew I am Jewish, and they didn\u2019t treat me worse than the others. There was a\ntough -- tough apprenticeship. I could show you but is showing only up to here, these two\nprong forks that the cooks use? I have several marks on my behind, when I wasn\u2019t\nmoving t -- fast enough.",
        "Q: They would --",
        "A: Yes. So, but not just me --",
        "Q: Was everyone?",
        "A: -- all -- all the apprentices.",
        "Q: And how many apprentices were there by the way, do you know?",
        "A: Oh, there were quite a fe -- they -- on every post was one, at least one, and then there\nwere some who replaced you when you went to school, and there were some additional\nones that were needed at time of serving and y -- lunch and dinner. And there were\nfunctions also. So there were at least eight, nine apprentices.",
        "Q: But I thought you said you did serve sometimes, when you -- when you went back after\nschool in the evening.",
        "A: Yeah, at the -- me -- me -- at the counter where the waiter brought his -- his order, we\nassembled the -- the plates, or that --",

        "Q: Did your father --",
        "A: I am glad you qualified that.",
        "Q: Yes, cause I wasn\u2019t quite sure what you meant. What was your father working at when he\nwas in Prague, what was his job?",
        "A: In Karlsbad he was a salesman for textile because that\u2019s what he knew from Vienna, from\nbefore. And I guess he couldn\u2019t find anything in that line in Prague. So once a salesman,\nalways a salesman, he started to sell coal. And I don\u2019t know whether to individual home\nowners because the truck came and every house had a -- a cellar, with through the\nwindow they put the coal down. I do not know if there were several tenants in the house,\nwhether each one had his own storage for the coal. Wa -- he was -- he was selling coal,\nand it\u2019s cold only half a year, so it\u2019s only about half the income, the yearly income. So --",
        "Q: So things were not easy.",
        "A: I think -- I think he also delivered to fact -- sold to factories and so, which were running\non coal. Oil was not at that time in use for production. I don\u2019t know what electricity was\nmade from, but I\u2019m sure it was from coal, because it was cheap and abundant in\nCzechoslovakia.",
        "Q: And did he keep his job till \u00b041, do you know?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t -- don\u2019t remember. I -- I --",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember. You didn\u2019t own the apartment where you were living?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: You rented the apartment.",
        "A: Rented it.",
        "Q: So, were you getting paid as an apprentice, so that you could --",
        "A: Yes, I did get -- I did get 60 crowns a month, which is two crowns a day, which allowed\nme to go twice to the opera. It was a contribution, was little, small. I think at later years I\ngot little more, but that 60 initial, stayed in my mind.",
        "Q: And did you give most of this money to your parents?",
        "A: All of it.",
        "Q: All of it.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have time to spend it. So after he told me that he can\u2019t keep me, I know I took off\nmy star and I found a job in a resort hotel on the Czech-Bohemian Highlands. I don\u2019t\nremember how I got it, I don\u2019t remember how I got there, I don\u2019t remember the name or\nlocation. I do remember having work there, and what impressed me in my memory 1s that\none day a man came from -- came in and asked me, \u201cAre you a Jew?\u201d I said, \u201cWhy\nwould you want to know?\u201d And he said, \u201cI just was at the police station and I heard them\nsay that at this hotel works a Jew, and they come to pick him up.\u201d So I dropped\neverything, changed my clothes, went to the railroad station and went home. I didn\u2019t even\npick up the money for -- for -- for that period that I didn\u2019t get paid. So that was my -- but\nI -- I don\u2019t remember many details. And I have many such empty windows in my\nmemory. Some -- some unbelievable ones. So then the only job I could get was at the --\nat a --",
        "Q: Tell me something, what is it you think you\u2019re -- you\u2019re not remembering?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember the town, I don\u2019t remember the hotel, the name. I don\u2019t recall like how\nthe kitchen looked. But I know that where I was standing when this man came in and told\nme that they coming to get the Jew.",
        "Q: Maybe the shock of what he said was so great that it blocked out --",
        "A: Yeah. Like people remember when Kennedy was shot, or when 9-11 happened, where\nthey were.",
        "Q: Right. So you went back --",
        "A: I di --",
        "Q: -- right di -- did -- you obviously are not wearing the Jewish star.",
        "A: Not wearing the -- the star on the train.",
        "Q: Do you look Jewish, in terms of what people --",
        "A: Do I?",
        "Q: Well, I have no -- I have no idea what that means. I never knew that that meant.",
        "A: No, I think -- I think the Europeans categorize the people, they -- they recognize the Jews\nby the nose, or other features, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So were you suspicious looking then? Did you --",
        "A: I didn\u2019t act suspiciously, and -- I acted as if I belonged there, and --",
        "Q: Now there\u2019s obviously -- well, this is 1941, have -- have the Germans attacked the Soviet\nUnion by then?",
        "A: Oh yes, in -- 1n \u201939, in the end of \u201939 they attacked Poland.",
        "Q: Poland, right, but the Soviet Union wasn\u2019t coming --",
        "A: And as soon as they had Poland, they broke their pact with the Soviets, and they went on.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The -- the only job is that -- I could get was at a dining hall that the Jewish community --\ncommu -- not the community at large, the community center you would call it, the keela -",
        "Q: Keela, uh-huh.",
        "A: -- 1S -- is maintained for immigrants from Poland, because they couldn\u2019t get the working\npermit, or not to endanger the Czech\u2019s jobs. So the community at large, plus the keela,\nhad to take care of them. Clothes 1s -- was collected, bedding and then other things, and\nthey got a substantial meal at noon at this dining hall. I didn\u2019t mention, when this aunt\ntold my mother I should become a cook, that many times it will be very beneficial to me,\nand maybe some those -- some of those related to me. So the first time was that my\nparents had my ration ticket and I got a good -- good meal. Not 79 dumplings, but I ate a\ngood meal. So I worked there, and thi -- another advantage of it was that I was one of\nonly two Jewish cooks in that whole occupied area.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Which brought me almost to the social level, or importance level of lawyers.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: No, wa -- one of two Jewish cooks, and they were needed.",
        "Q: Maybe more needed than lawyers.",
        "A: So one was already in that dining hall and I was the second.",
        "Q: But was he much older than you, or was he --",
        "A: He was older, he was born in 1919.",
        "Q: But he\u2019s only five years older.",
        "A: More -- yeah, but more experienced --",
        "Q: Yeah. Yes.",
        "A: -- more -- I worked until the fall, when the man who managed this dining hall told me\nthat he was designated to become a member of a council of elders in charge of supply and\nfeeding and economy, in a ghetto to be created to hold all the Jews from the Czech lands.\nAnd he would appreciate if I, as a rarity, one of the two cooks, would volunteer and go\nthere with the very first transport to prepare kitchens, train people so they could be fed\nwhen they arrived by the thousands.",
        "Q: And who was this person?",
        "A: His name was Karl Schliesser, very nice, very nice man.",
        "Q: And about how old did you think he was at the time?",
        "A: Oh, he was a [indecipherable] person I didn\u2019t judge what he -- he already had kids and I\nknow he had a daughter who was older than I was. Anyway, he immediately contradicted\nhimself. He said to ghetto to hold all the Jews. And then he said if I volunteer and come\nwith him, he would protect my parents from being deported further to the east from that\nghetto. As a member of the Council of Elders, he would protect my parents from -- that\nmeans before this ghetto, Terezin, Theresienstadt was created, the officials at the -- at the\nJewish community knew that it\u2019s not going to be a permanent ghetto, it\u2019s going to be a\ntransition station for further deportations.",
        "Q: Did you understa -- did you understand that there was a conflict in what he said, that\nthere was a contradiction? Or did you --",
        "A: No -- I -- I -- I knew that -- immediately that all the Czech Jews would come there, but\nnot all would stay there. And my father was vehemently opposed to my volunteering, you\ndon\u2019t volunteer for something like this, unknown. But I thought -- 1-1n the first instance\nhe said to hold all the Jews of -- so if my turn would come eventually, and if he will be\nable to keep his word, I believed if he c -- will be able, that he would. I\u2019m ahead of the\ngame, and my parents have a chance to stay there -- there was no thought about the\nconcentration camps, and annihilation and then gassing and the -- that was not known\nuntil the very end. Nobody outside the concentration camp knew what\u2019s expecting the\ndeportees upon their arrival in Auschwitz, or wha -- that was not known of Auschwitz --\nand people would not have even believed it and have not believed it later on. There was\n[indecipherable] always optimistic. Now -- and there were some people who were\narrested for political -- by the Germans, opponents. And they later got -- the family\nreceived a card that he died, that family member arrested six months ago, died in\nAuschwitz for -- on a heart attack. So those who came afterwards, and came to\nAuschwitz, wrote back. They couldn\u2019t say, I\u2019m in Auschwitz, but they wrote, in these 30\nallowed words, I am at Uncle Joe\u2019s, or with Uncle Joe, to let them know he\u2019s in\nAuschwitz. But these people have interpreted it, Joe is alive, he is not -- you know,\nalways --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- took the optimistic --",
        "Q: Optimistic, yeah.",
        "A: -- part of the situation. So --",
        "Q: T-Tell me something. Your father was absolutely against it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What did your mother say, since she was a very strong person in the family\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: She was less against it.",
        "Q: She was less against it?",
        "A: Less against it, because I said that, what he promised, and she thought there may be a\nchance. And nobody expected it to be, you will -- okay, you will be displaced, and\nreplaced somewhere else. Nobody had an idea, a military barracks that the families won\u2019t\nbe -- there were ghettos before in Poland, but these were voluntary ghettos where Jews\nhave, on their own will, congregated to be away from the anti-Semites, and felt better and\nsafer, and on their own. So these were voluntary ghettos, and there the Germans just drew\na barbed wire around the district, and they had the ghetto. But people were living\ntogether, maybe crammed, maybe, but fam -- so they made up -- the -- the idea was, we\nwere living elsewhere with only Jews, and just the situation of -- of living arrangement\nwill change.",

        "A: Yeah, I --",
        "Q: -- or was it a difficult decision?",
        "A: -- I -- no, no, I -- I decided, this time I prevailed. And I went to the -- on November 24\",\n1941, with 342 hand-picked men, and we assembled -- we came from home, directly to\nthe railroad station, assembled there, and it was the last time we traveled in a passenger\ntrain.",
        "Q: Oh, you were in a passenger train for that trip?",
        "A: In a passenger train to --",
        "Q: Were you the only cook, o-or that other guy was there --",
        "A: The other one was too.",

        "A: But he did not volunteer. He did not volunteer, and he was put in anyway.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So --",
        "Q: 342 y -- mostly young men?",
        "A: No, these were th -- I -- depends what is young. Today everybody under --",
        "Q: -- is young, right.",
        "A: -- 75 is young for me. But these were accomplished engineers, technicians, plumbers,\ncarpenters. To transform the town, which was a fortress town, built in 1780, with 12\nmeter thick walls, built in octagon, you have seen the plan. And each corner was 1n a --\nshaped in a triangle so you could see the enemy approach, if he did. And the 12 meter\nthick walls, and the moat around it, and the moat was filled on the river that was running\njust by the walls.

        "Q: Yeah, it certainly is.",
        "A: But --",
        "Q: But you really were the only volunteer amongst all of them?",
        "A: Yeah. And later on people volunteered when the husband was taken with one transport\nand the wife volunteered to go with the next hoping to be with him, this -- this were only\nkind -- other kind of volunteerism. So --",
        "Q: So it\u2019s not a calm situation for people, there\u2019s --",
        "A: No, they know -- they -- I don\u2019t know what they thought when they thought they\u2019re going\nto build something and then they come back home.",

        "A: I don\u2019t know that. But I was the -- I think the only one who was told it\u2019s going to be a\nghetto to hold all the Jews, and -- and so on. I think, I\u2019m not sure. It was not a frightful\nsituation, concerned, worried. I think that the prevailed -- the -- the th-thought prevailed,\nwe are going to do a job somewhere and we come back. Because there were before\ngroups sent to certain areas where the German a -- the -- the head, or [indecipherable] or\nwife was residing in a castle and the group was sent there to do the landscaping, and then\nthey came back when it was finished. And there was another group working in the forest,\nI\u2019m not sure what they did there, and they came back. So I think that did example must\nhave been in their mind, because it was not nervous, it -- it was upsetting, taken away\nfrom your wife and kids, but so we were allowed to take with us 110 pounds of luggage.\nAnd it consisted mainly, going into the winter, of warm clothing, and everyone had the\n110 pounds, and two pair of pants, and two jackets, and another coat, and you know, to --\nthe -- to --",

        "A: Or four days later, we -- the whole Council of Elders. And the Council of Elders were the\nofficials at the Jewish community in Prague.",
        "Q: The same Jewish community where you were in the kitchen?",
        "A: Yeah, I didn\u2019t know that when I was in the kitchen, they were in another town -- another\npar -- ch -- part of Prague, in the --",

        "A: So we were brought in to what was called the Sudeten barracks, and when we entered, the\ngates closed behind us. And when we came there, it was open. We came in, and the gates\nclosed. So that was the first time suspicion of some prison type accommodation is\nbeginning. We were assembled on the courtyard, and the commandant was a doctor, I\ndon\u2019t know what kind of a doctor, he was not a cardiologist I know, because he didn\u2019t\nhave a good heart.

        "A: Czech gendarme. And some of them were very good, they felt, you know, that one Czech\nto another, and the re-relation didn\u2019t make a difference. Some were bad, and some were\nafraid to be good.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So there three categories. You had to know with whom you are dealing. So you could go\nout only accompanied by a work detail.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re really in a -- in a rather small area?",
        "A: I was inside the barrack, never got out. I mean, never, for a certain period --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- until it was filled. Anyway, I started to say that until 1938, those barracks were used --\noccupied and used by the military and since the German occupation, there was no\nmilitary in those barracks, they were closed. And of course, they started to deteriorate, a\nlack of maintenance, and weather, and rusty and dusty, and -- and repairs, the floor, the\npipes. So -- but I couldn\u2019t get anybody to help me to prepare the kitchens, because they\nhad their assigned job. Until later they got the idea that it\u2019s good to have some relations\nwith the kitchen under the conditions we were living at, and they came and helped, that\nthey did some manual work, and the engineers did some repair. And they finally got the\none kitchen going. There were two kitchens in the Sudeten.",
        "Q: Two kitchens in the Sudeten. So what ha -- how did people eat when you first came?",
        "A: We were told to take a three day something -- for the first day some sandwiches, and then\nsome non-perishable food like a canned food or so, there was no frozen, or whatever --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- prepared meals. So for three days we took --",
        "Q: Your own food.",
        "A: -- our own food, and we were able on the third day already to prepare a soup, and -- and\nbread was delivered for the 342.",
        "Q: So, did you make the soup because you didn\u2019t have any help? Who made the soup?",
        "A: That wasn\u2019t difficult to make, the soup, that if you did nothing else. That -- that -- the\nother cook was there, we worked together. He was not very enthusiastic about it.",
        "Q: And what did you have, huge -- huge pots?",
        "A: Kettle, like you saw in that picture.",
        "Q: In picture, huge --",
        "A: Huge, yeah, 400 liter, hundred gallon kettles. Some were steam heated from a central\nsteam line, which then had to be augmented, the capacity I mean, of which. And some\nburn coal. So there -- you found -- I\u2019m jumping ahead again. Okay, we\u2019re in that kitchen\nand preparing it and we got ready, and six days later, a transport of thousand people came\nfrom Brno, that\u2019s the capital of Moravia.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And what -- it was the job of the Council of Elders, and now while -- if the Council of\nElder was in Terezin, so there were other officials in Prague, and those big communities,\nthat had to put the thousand people to fill a transport, on German orders. This 1s a terrible\nresponsibility to decide whom you dislocate from their regular life, which was lousy\nalready anyway, but it was something known, and send them away. But what they did,\nthey kept families together. In my case it was negative, because they wanted me to be\ntogether with my parents, so they came three weeks after me, while they otherwise might\nhave, by chance, stayed longer in their accommodations at home.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And this principle prevailed also when transports were put together from Terezin to the\neast.",
        "Q: They would bra -- keep families together.",
        "A: Families together, unless one of the family members were -- was in a job -- it could work\nboth ways -- a job that was necessary either for war industry or -- or for maintenance of\nthe town -- functioning of the town, they either kept the one and send the rest, or they\nkept the whole family back. And I don\u2019t know who and why and how these decisions\nwere made, but these were three ways of people staying in Terezin till the end, or being\nshipped out.",
        "Q: Right. Now, Edgar, you\u2019re 17 years old in 1941 when you\u2019re deported.",
        "A: Yeah, 17 and a half",
        "Q: Seven -- 17 and a half, that\u2019s right, because in February you\u2019re going to be 18.",
        "A: 17 and a half.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right, in 1942.",
        "A: Almost three quarter.",
        "Q: Right. Do you feel as an adult man at this point? I mean, how -- what is it -- who -- who\nare you?",
        "A: It\u2019s hard for me to say, it y -- sounds like bragging, but my wife wa -- brings that up,\nwhereas that it was unbelievable that age 17 and three quarters, I could organize the\nsetting up of the kitchen, and not only that. When that first transport came of -- I don\u2019t\nremember what the other one did.",
        "Q: The other cook?",
        "A: He was the -- yeah, he -- he worked alone, but he did not initiate anything. I think he was\nmad that he was taken out of his regular life. With that first transport, I mention whole\nfamilies came, so I had somebody staff the kitchen with women who knew about food,\nwho knew about preparation of food, understood food, although they never worked for\nthousand people, I -- I -- neither did I. But at least somebody who knows how to handle\nfood -- food. Now, there was flour in -- in the warehouses. There was some sugar, there\nwas some margarine, and interestingly, there was plenty of spices. Pepper, paprika,\ncaraway. I guess that was not a -- an item the Germans were short of. But there was no\nvegetable, there was no fruit. There was occasionally some marmalade, and not to jump\ntoo fast, we started up one kitchen, and then, or after that first transport, every second\nday, third day, another thousand people came. And I don\u2019t remember how many\nthousands that Sudeten held, but when it was full, the Germans decided to separate\nwomen from the men.",
        "Q: So at first when they came to the Sudeten, they were together?",
        "A: Often families together, yeah. And I never went up to look how they a-accommodated\nwith a -- a family occupies one of the three sections of the bunk, or above each other, or -",
        "Q: And how -- how were the -- do you know how the bunks were set up? Is this like a\ndormitory?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Or were there actually separate room? There were not separate rooms, it was all --",
        "A: No, no, there was the -- this military barrack --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- was one long --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- one long room, and then they put up the bunks this way.",
        "Q: So where are you staying?",
        "A: I was staying in one -- one of -- one --",
        "Q: One of these bunks?",
        "A: One of these bunks, yeah. I wasn\u2019t privileged yet, later I had some privileges.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And did you have bunkmates?",
        "A: Yeah. So when they se -- decided to separate the women from the men, they designated\nthe Dresner for the women. That other cook went there, and with the women went girls of\nall ages, and boys under age 15.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Those 15 and older stayed there, and they were assigned jobs.",
        "Q: Stayed in Sudeten.",
        "A: Everyone -- everyone had some job designated.",
        "Q: So Sudeten is first, then Dresden is second?",
        "A: Then Dresner, yeah.",
        "Q: Is it Dresden or dres --",
        "A: Dresner.",
        "Q: Dresner.",
        "A: Dresden 1s the town, and the designation 1s Dresner --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- it\u2019s [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- barracks, it\u2019s instead of an [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And --",
        "Q: Did you also have to set up the kitchens in -- in Dresner?",
        "A: In Dresner he did.",
        "Q: He did.",
        "A: He did. But he stayed there, and when Dresner was full and another barracks was -- the\nkitchen to be set up, I went.",
        "Q: So then who took over in Sudeten? You -- you don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I hope by that time people were already capable of running -- what was interesting, most\nof the so-called head chefs in those kitchens, were former butchers.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Although the -- no meat was handled. Oh yes, when the horse died somewhere in the\nneighborhood, we got it in -- we got it -- we got --",
        "Q: You got in the meat.",
        "A: We got the meat. And if there was a butcher store originally, for the germ -- yeah -- I\u2019m\nhandling it too fast.",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay.",
        "A: We were isolated and walking from barracks to barracks or to the workplace,\naccompanied by gendarmes. By June 1942, the last of these town inhabitants was\nevacuated by the Germans. I don\u2019t know how they were accommodated, whether they\nfound them, but that wasn\u2019t my problem.",
        "Q: Whe -- when -- when in 1942 did this happen? Early?",
        "A: June.",
        "Q: June of 1942?",
        "A: June \u00b042.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And from then on, the gates of the barracks were open, and when you finished your job,\nyour work, your assigned work, you could go with that family and move around without\nbeing accompanied or guarded. So I went from barrack to barracks, and part of just\npreparing the kitchen, was also training people to -- to -- I did get information of what is\nin the -- in the warehouse. And I got information how many people are already living\nthere. So based on that, I made use of supplies for individual barracks, and later on even a\nsophisticated menu, how many grams of what to --",
        "Q: Really? So how did you figure this out? I mean, these are much larger populations than\nyou were ever trained to feed.",
        "A: Yeah. I told you, there\u2019s one -- there were some women who were able to administer the\nkitchen, not just the butchers, and that [indecipherable] it\u2019s -- it\u2019s funny that there was no\nmeat, but the butchers seemed to be the best administrators of a kitchen.",
        "Q: Did -- w-were you the person who was in control of the amount of -- of whatever\ningredients could be sent, whether it was flour, 1t was sugar, it would be sent to this\nbarrack, or that barrack, or this kitchen?",
        "A: That -- that started out this way. Later there were people who were in business, food\nbusiness, so I had stores at -- and groceries and -- and other related business. They\nbecame -- they became the warehouse -- 0-operating the warehouse, and this -- they\ndidn\u2019t got the information, and without my interference or -- or participation, based on\nthe initial set-up, delivered directly to --",
        "Q: And were there equal rations given to each barrack, or were there different -- differences\nin the barracks?",
        "A: Not in the barracks, the difference was -- and that was -- you know, the Council of Elders\nhad very -- they were, so to say, the town administration. They were actually a cabinet,\nthere was a man designated for transportation and for labor and for health and for supply,\nand -- and other departments. But they had very little room for initiative. That was all\nbased on strict rules set by the Germans. However they, where possible, they applied\ntheir own decision making. Like for instance for the children, and that was a little bit\nlater, the -- a children\u2019s kitchen was -- was created, that had more of the food a growing\nchild needs, because children were our future. And they decided those who had hard\nlabor assignments to get more food. Of course, that was taken away from the general\npopulation, but the general population was so large, that the few privileged groups -- and\nit wasn\u2019t privileged, was rewarded appropriately, larger por -- rations. But it did not\nimpact tremendously.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t think it impacted the general population very much?",
        "A: Not much was taken away from all the thousands of the regular population to feed the\nfew -- to improve the ration of the children and the -- those who have hard -- performed\nhard labor. So at -- this way I was hopping from one barrack to another, trying to get the\nmost capable person to stay behind and run it, all while I was 18 - 18 and a half.",
        "Q: Did you feel --",
        "A: Important?",
        "Q: -- important, yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. I -- I don\u2019t think -- I liked to do that. I felt good having a responsibility.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Being trusted and so, yeah, but --",
        "Q: Did -- did you have contact with the Council of the el -- Elders, with Schliesser, after you\ngot there? Was there meet -- for instance, a meeting?",
        "A: It -- it -- not -- really not, really not. He had his jobs to do, and I did mine, and there was\nno -- he did -- except those, as I said, the instructions as to portion size for the kids, and\nthen the decision to create a kit -- a children\u2019s kitchen and a diet kitchen.",
        "Q: What does that mean?",
        "A: What does that mean? That was maybe in the small -- I think it was a p-previous\nrestaurant in -- for the civilians of the -- the kitchen was then, for people who had\ndiabetes or gall bladder or stuff, to give more of one item that they can have, and less of\nsomething that would be harmful to them. You know, a -- a diet within the framework of\navailability.",
        "Q: So give me an idea of the kind of food people will have for breakfast, and then for lunch\nor dinner. And I\u2019m assuming now, given your explanation, that most people in the\ngeneral population, 90 percent or 95 percent of the population, is eating out of these big\nkitchens. Very few people have apartments and cook for themselves, am I correct?",
        "A: That was only very later, and -- and these were only some of the privileged people --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- who had connections to get a room in one of those -- where the -- where the town\npopulation was living, they got one room per family, and they had a little kerosene\ncooker, or so, and --",
        "Q: So would you say it was 10 percent of the population --",
        "A: No, much less.",
        "Q: -- or less -- much less than that?",
        "A: Much less.",
        "Q: Okay. So everybody\u2019s lining up for whatever they\u2019re going to eat, in their -- in their\nbarracks?",
        "A: In the -- except in the -- I -- even -- even in the days when it was snowing, from those\nkettles the food was transferred into barrels, taken out and in the yard, served. And lines\nwere forming, and the -- very soon they made not ration tickets, but meal tickets, which\nthey were printed there somewhere, and all the days of the month on it, and there was one\nperson, called ordnungs Dienst, somebody who kept order with the band, armband, and\nit\u2019s not a s -- what do you call it, it\u2019s -- made holes into these --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- tickets, showing that the person was already there, and to reject him if he came a\nsecond time. And --",
        "Q: So if you lost this ticket, you were in big trouble.",
        "A: Yes. I don\u2019t know what -- what they did if -- they wouldn\u2019t let them starve, but I don\u2019t\nknow what the -- could be only for that month that he was starving, but I -- I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: This -- this organizational part, I -- I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t --",
        "Q: And everyone who had a ticket would get something?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Now if the person with the ladle at the barrel was your friend, you had a chance to get\nlike -- you came with a bigger container, and he may give you two ladles full, or may\nreach lower down to get you some of the sm -- more of the solids. This is something that\nhas developed -- you know, a barter system has developed. There was no money, so\neveryone -- it may not sound nice, but that\u2019s what happened, everyone who had access to\nsomething, like the carpenter had access to wood, the cook had access to food, there were\nworkshops where they worked for the Germans, so s -- that was a mitzvah to steal from\nthe Germans. The other was a little less colorful. The cooks were expected to give their\nfamily little more, but it was not ethical to steal more and get from a carpenter a shelf,\nwhere you put up your shaving stuff, you know? Or --",
        "Q: But -- but it happened?",
        "A: Yes, yes. And it happened in -- in every single department. And what is even less ethical\nwas that only those families who had someone involved in -- in one of those trades where\nyou could schleusse something, that was called also, to -- th-they didn\u2019t say steal, they\nsaid to schleusse it.",
        "Q: That means what? To channel it? To -- to go from one person to another?",
        "A: To -- yeah, in Auschwitz, it was called organizing.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And here was called, to swipe, or whatever. So there was -- there were -- were different\ncategories and levels of -- of f-feeding, and -- and access to the -- you know, you got\nsomeone working in the -- in the clothes warehouse, where the clothes was that was\neither confiscated upon arrival, or if someone died who didn\u2019t have a family, who wanted\nto retain the goods, went to the warehouse. The Germans sent this to Germany for their\nown people, they needed it, or -- while they were at war so long. So if somebody stole\ntheir something [indecipherable] so where, everywhere somebody had something that\nsomebody else wanted, he bartered for or something he wanted or needed, or didn\u2019t need,\nbut got it anyway. Cigarettes were the most valuable barter item. The Germans didn\u2019t\nknow how well they mean to the Jews when they forbid them to smoke. Otherwise they\nwould have brought in a lot of cigarettes.",
        "Q: So how did you get cigarettes?",
        "A: Si -- through some of these good gendarmes.",
        "Q: The Czech gendarmes.",
        "A: You pay them, and some did it even without paying. They contacted your family in\nPrague, and the aunt or whoever, came to the gendarmes home, who lived nearby,\ndelivered the stuff, and he brought it in, and you pick it up at the gate, or so --",
        "Q: And why would they do that? Were they getting paid also [indecipherable] bribe?",
        "A: Some did it for payment, and some did it just out of good heart.",
        "Q: And did cigarettes then become sort of currency inside the ghetto, if you had it, you could\nthen --",
        "A: The -- the most valuable currency.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And there were people who gave up their food in Auschwitz, people died because they --\nthe meager ration they gave for a cigarette. Couldn\u2019t stop smoki --",
        "Q: And this was both men and women, as far as you know? Or more men than women?",
        "A: I -- not many women were smoking, I -- I -- I don\u2019t know. I couldn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know\nabout women, but I know men.",
        "Q: Men. So what -- do you know what might have been the -- the -- the biggest currency for\nwomen in terms of this bartering system, or y -- or you don\u2019t know?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it was lipstick, but I -- I -- I -- I don\u2019t know. Maybe my wife will be able to\ntell you.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Well, we\u2019ll ask her tomorrow. So would you consider this a kind of black market\nsystem as well, or not?",
        "A: Just barter -- barter --",
        "Q: Just bartering.",
        "A: -- barter economy. Bartered with -- with whatever you had, you brought with you, and\ndidn\u2019t use it, and somebody else wanted it. All things that you --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- disappropriated somewhere where you had access to.",
        "Q: Did you smoke?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember in which grade, kids dragged me into the bathroom in school, I was a\nyoung kid still, and gave me a puff of a cigarette, and I coughed so much that I never\ntouched it again. So --",
        "Q: So did that mean that you didn\u2019t have access, or did you sometimes get cigarettes and use\nit to get other things?",
        "A: No, I never got cigarettes, and I never -- I -- I had the -- I had some of the food that I\ncould use, and I tell you how I used it. We are already far ahead, and I wanted also to\nbring out my -- the initi -- the beginning and impact of Schacter on the whole camp, and\non me personally.",
        "Q: Well, we will do that. I -- I still wanted to stay with the kitchens for a little bit, if that was\nokay.",
        "A: Yeah, no, but that started -- he came in December of \u201941, so --",
        "Q: So just a few weeks after you?",
        "A: -- we did -- we didn\u2019t have to go back.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Am I correct to say that your first roommate was a lawyer of some kind?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Introduced you to various people. Was there a lawyer?",
        "A: How do -- yeah, yeah, how do you --",
        "Q: There was an interview that you did.",
        "A: You -- you have your own --",
        "Q: Spies.",
        "A: -- Intelligence network?",
        "Q: Yes. I think we have to stop the tape, but we\u2019re going to start --",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t find anybody of his family.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: His wife was a little bit taking advantage. She -- she bartered with -- with giving favors to\nmen.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. All right, we\u2019ll stop the tape now.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "Q: Edgar, before we get on to your roommates, and -- and your relationship with Schacter, I\nwanted to ask you about what kind of food was -- was served. I mean, it\u2019s a little\noverwhelming for anybody to think of thousands of people being cooked for, under these\nconditions especially.",
        "A: That\u2019s why I tried to introduce Schacter, because we have something in common.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: [coughs] Sorry. He -- I consider him a psychologist without a certificate, or without a\ndiploma. He recognized the -- and I'll come to your question --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- he recognized immediately upon his arrival, the -- that the prison mentality can sink\ninto the people\u2019s mind. That when he came, when the gates were still closed, and he got\neverybody together and encouraged them to sing. And most of the songs were Czech\npopular songs, which most of people knew. And it had a tremendous impact on\neverybody, not just during the time you were singing, and gathers others who were not\nsinging, were sitting there and listening, to the point that not just that hour, hour and a\nhalf, you forgot every -- that the reality of your actual circumstances, but you took with\nyou a little bit of -- like a care package, a -- a spiritual care package to help you carry on\ni-1n -- for the -- until the next time when we sing.",
        "Q: So this was -- he did this in the Sudeten barrack when you first came --",
        "A: The Sudeten in the basement, and not only that, I mentioned to you that the gates were\nclosed, and the women were in another barracks. I don\u2019t know how he managed, he\nappeared in the women\u2019s barracks, and did the same with the women, with the same\nbeneficial impact. So I -- why I represented him before answering your question, I knew\nthat the Czechs lived through their stomach. Even now, this family, when they come to\nvisit, the sister-in-law and the nephews and nieces, food is so meaningful, they come into\nthe house, and they go right, pick up the covers of the pots and -- and then pinch here,\nand pinch there. I tried with those ingredients we had, to make food that\u2019s mainly a Czech\n-- Czech food. Dumplings -- we had flour. I don\u2019t know how, on my request, yeast came\ninto the camp, and we made dumplings, and from this so-called coffee, that was a dark\ngrain, nothing to do with coffee, but it was dark and looked like it, and we cooked it, and\nlet it cool, and at the right temperature, 1f you put in some margarine and whipped it, it\ndidn\u2019t dissolve completely, and it -- you know it didn\u2019t melt. It stayed like little dots of\nmar -- people thought that\u2019s the best sauce on a dumpling they ever ate. And some people\nasked after the war, said, could you make it for me?",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: So this -- in this way I tried to accommodate or improve their mental state with providing\nfood that is close to the Czech stomach. And I say Czech because these people were first\nCzechs, and then they were Jews, then they were -- if not they, then somebody else made\nthem aware that they are Jews.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So in this way I mention Schacter first, because in his way he did work on the Czech\nmind, and I worked on the Czech stomachs.",
        "Q: But I -- I\u2019m still not completely clear on once the kitchens were going 1n all the different\nbarracks, and I assume that all the barracks had their own kitchen, am I correct?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And then there was -- and from the nearby neighborhood of those houses\nwhere the origin population lived, nearest to each barrack, those people were designated\nto this particular barrack.",
        "Q: Right, uh-huh.",
        "A: And then the further -- located further away, for those -- sorry, for those a kitchen was\nbuilt in -- on the main road, and that was only to be delivered to another location, central\nlocation where those able of walking could come to. And from that kitchen also, the ones\nwho couldn\u2019t come were supplied like meals on wheels, Terezin style. So --",
        "Q: You mean, the elderly who couldn\u2019t go --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- or the people who were disabled, who couldn\u2019t go. So d-do you think people starved in\nTerezin?",
        "A: Those who had no connection to, or anything to barter with, or had something but were in\nthe attic and couldn\u2019t get down and mingle, those really -- 1t was -- it\u2019s not starving on the\nstreet falling down, but they, of malnutrition, lack of vitamins and -- and s -- lack of\nappropriate amounts of food, even if it wasn\u2019t the right food, caused them to -- made\nthem susceptible to diseases and we had the best doctors, all the doctors were there.\nThere was a operating room that was brought in from a Jewish hospital in Prague. And if\nyou only need a doctor\u2019s attention, you had the best attention, but if you needed\nmedication, you were [indecipherable]. I had my hernia operated there.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And ne -- didn\u2019t need anything else except a surgeon\u2019s intervention. And I healed, and\nthat was okay. But if you had something, I don\u2019t know, asthma, that they gave you --\ninhale some vapors, hot water or so, hot water vapors, but there was really no medication\nthat --",
        "Q: Did they put you -- they must have put you to sleep with something, did they have ether?",
        "A: I think -- yeah, it was, it was ether.",
        "Q: But no painkillers for after?",
        "A: No. I didn\u2019t any.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t need it.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So there were not people who were lying dead on the street, the way they were in other --\nin other ghettos, as far as you knew?",
        "A: No, no. That -- they were dying in the -- in that -- in the infirmary, or -- or where they\nlived, but it was maybe not direct starving, but starvation induced susceptibility to\ndiseases which put them in pneumonia. Dysentery -- dysentery killed the most people.",
        "Q: But you have very few toilets. You had th -- at the -- as far as I know, at one time the\nmost was about 50,000 people.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But there\u2019s something like 900 or a thousand toilets available. So most people --",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think there were that many. Th -- in the barracks --",
        "Q: You think there were fewer?",
        "A: -- in the barracks -- in the military barracks were not latrines, but the soldiers had there a\nwall of urinals, and then what do you call it, those booth or separations with a toilet. And\nthere were people standing in line. In some areas, where it was necessary, some latrines\nwere built. And I don\u2019t know how they were emptied, and the stuff carried away, or\nsanitized I think, with some -- some carc -- it\u2019s calcium, but it\u2019s not calcium like you take\nfor your bones, it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know how itt is particular --",
        "Q: Lime, of some --",
        "A: L-Lime. Oh, isn\u2019t she wonderful, lime. What would I do without you?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: So -- but still, it was dysenter -- Hana\u2019s grandparents, both of them -- no, was\ngrandmother and -- and this brother of her grandfather came, he -- he was 80 years old\nand he worked as a lumberjack, he was splitting wood for the -- starting the fires in those\nkettles. And there was a [indecipherable] six weeks later he was gone, with diarrhea -- the\ndysentery.",
        "Q: Because they had nothing.",
        "A: Dehydration, you know.",
        "Q: Now, access to water also, was -- was very difficult, yes? People couldn\u2019t wash easily, or\n-- and drink water, or am I [indecipherable]",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how -- you know, in those houses and apartments of the town population,\nthese were not apartments with two or three bathrooms that -- nobody had two bathrooms\nexcept some super rich people in their villas. But here, they -- they must have had --\npossibly, problems. But in the military barracks, there were these -- was these rows of\none huge trough or two in the middle of pipe, water pipe, with --",
        "Q: With faucets?",
        "A: -- with faucets along. And I have a picture at home of one of those ladies\u2019 washrooms.",
        "Q: So Hannover had it? Sudeten?",
        "A: All the bar -- all the barracks --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] they all had it.",
        "A: -- all the military barracks had washrooms. But cold water only.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Which in winter was not very pleasant, but --",
        "Q: When you said that you had -- your first roommate was a lawyer, I don\u2019t know what his\nname was, what does that mean when you say roommate? Were you actually living in a --\nin a separate room?",
        "A: I told you I was a big shot. In eight -- with 18 or 19 years, and I had -- and I don\u2019t know\nhow and where I got it. Could be -- it could have been a part of barter result that some\ncarpenter put a -- a few boards up, separated a bigger -- a smaller room from the rest of\nthe big room, and his wife -- in the Hamburger was a jail for women. I didn\u2019t mention yet\nthat there was a -- the gendarmes was -- were watching outside, and inside was a ghetto\npolice, established by the Council of Elders and they looked like -- under the cap and the\n-- and the yellow armband identifying them as a police.",
        "Q: Were they in uniform?",
        "A: They had some -- they wore black -- I don\u2019t know, but everyone had exactly the same.\nBut you could recognize that he\u2019s of the police formation. The -- how did we get to the\npolice?",
        "Q: Well, I\u2019m asking you about the lawyer.",
        "A: The lawyer, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: So internally there\u2019s -- there\u2019s ghetto police, and his wife --",
        "A: -- okay.",
        "Q: -- you said something --",
        "A: That\u2019s from the wife we came to the police.",
        "Q: But also you said something about the wife in the last tape. Which was that she seemed to\nhave slept around.",
        "A: Did I say that?",
        "Q: Well, you didn\u2019t use those words, but that\u2019s what you were implying.",
        "A: Yeah, okay. This is how she -- I think this is how she got the -- either head of the -- the\njail mistress, or chai -- jail warden in the Dresner. And the jail was the -- when -- 1t was\nused by the military, the barracks, there was a guard room, and there was another room\nwhere they rested if they -- between shifts, or between the guard duties. And there was a -\n- they put up a [indecipherable] and there was a temporary holding jail.",
        "Q: For women?",
        "A: For women. And I don\u2019t know why women were being --",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know?",
        "A: -- jailed. No.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: My mother was jailed, but that was by the Germans. And that was in the Kommandatur,\nwhich was in a bank building and down where the vaults were, they had the jails.",
        "Q: But in male barracks they would also have jails for Jewish men, if they --",
        "A: I think so, I -- I was --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- held in one at the moment of weakness. I -- just for the short time we know each other\nyou must know I\u2019m a very easy going person. And I -- I have tremendous amount of\npatience. But when it comes to the point where I can no longer be patient, I can be a\nmurderer. I can kill. So, I -- I totally lose presence of mind, and just instinct. There were\ntwo very young SS men, they would de -- everybody called them kindergarten. And they\nwere driving the tractors that were pulling the -- the heavy loads, so they were -- because\nthe Jews, they didn\u2019t want to entrust a Jew, that distracts the Jews. And one day they\ncome in front of the Hamburger. There\u2019s an old man going, and one of them -- I -- he\ndidn\u2019t see them, he didn\u2019t take his hat off, or whatever, and they went in and started to\nunload on him, with hitting. I went with a friend, I tore loose, and I knocked them both\ndown to the ground. A normal person wouldn\u2019t do that, but that\u2019s the condition I get in\nwhen it snaps. And they started to shoot, but they were drunk, and it didn\u2019t help. So they\nget the police, grab me in, pull me into their guard room, and the other guy went to the\nhead of the Council of Elders to tell him about it. And he cleaned it up, because those two\nwere drunk and shouldn\u2019t have been there. So somehow I got away. I don\u2019t know how,\nbecause nobody attacks SS men unpunished. So you asked the jail, and I went to\nsideways in saying I was in there. So he was -- he knew about it and he suffered by it, and\nwe consoled each other. And --",
        "Q: Let me -- I -- I said something s -- a little bit coarsely, and I didn\u2019t mean to say it that\nway, when I said that this lawyer\u2019s wife was -- was sleeping around. And what I really\nmean to ask --",
        "A: But that\u2019s another way of saying it.",
        "Q: It is another way, but I -- but I think it\u2019s a more s -- s -- it\u2019s more serious than that. You\nknow, when you were saying that men were smoking, so they could easily use cigarettes\nas a way to barter, is it possible that women had a currency that became very significant\nin Theresienstadt, namely sex.",
        "A: Could have been there, not many, but under those conditions, and not knowing transports\nhave -- were lea -- were leaving, and you don\u2019t know where they go, or -- or what\u2019s\nhappening. So the level of morality sank a little, and people wanted to enjoy as much as\nthey could, and as long as they could. And you did not have to be in love just to perform\nand enjoy. So I don\u2019t know whether, or how many, if so, would have used this as a\ncurrency.",
        "Q: But in any way it\u2019s very complicated, because for some -- for some people, their life\nforce is such that before they die, they want to have affection, and sex. For others it may\nbe using it as a currency, it would be hard to know [indecipherable]",
        "A: I think most of it was just sex.",
        "Q: For itself.",
        "A: As long as -- as long as you\u2019re here, you know you -- there are some certain rooms, or\nyou had the roommate, you tell him get out of here, and so -- but I think it was very little.\nWell, there were young people who -- who -- Hana\u2019s sister got -- Hana\u2019s brother made a\nvery serious acquaintance, and before -- on the day he was deported, 1n the morning, he\nmarried this girl. So there\u2019s a chance that they -- they can go together and she wouldn\u2019t --\nher supervisor wouldn\u2019t let her go, because she worked in the agriculture, which was\nbringing in harvest for the Germans. The agriculture was not for the ghetto, that was for\nthe Germans. So the -- these are the -- sure, there were instances where people fell in love\nwith each other, or shared the -- the sorrow, which then became bearable through nice\ncompanionship. But there was also just this free -- free life before. It may not be again.",
        "Q: Was this shocking to you at the time?",
        "A: No, it was enlightening to me.",
        "Q: It was enlightening to you. True, yeah?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah -- you -- you mean that, this is not just a --",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: Yeah. So this was a learning experience in some way?",
        "A: You\u2019re asking too many questions, I already my --",
        "Q: That\u2019s my job",
        "A: -- [had already my apprenticeship before I went to -- to Terezin. But there, yes, and it\nwas not the barter, it was mutual drive to enjoy as much as possible --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- under the given circumstances, which were not very enjoyable.",
        "Q: Right. Did -- do you think that people in Terezin after \u201940 -- after \u00b042, when -- there must\nbe rumors of what\u2019s going on, at least, that people have a sense that if they\u2019re sent,\nthey\u2019re not going to return? Y -- I mean, and are people afraid, or they s --",
        "A: They may not return to Terezin --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- but they may go to another camp and build, and -- and create a new ghetto, or a new\nlabor -- labor camp, and -- and the Germans kept this ver -- that was the best kept secret.\nFor instance, they ordered, for one time, a thousand men, age 18 to 55, but only men t-\ntransport, that they go somewhere to build a new labor camp. And the next transport, the\nwives of those men were encouraged to volunteer so they can be with their men, and\nthey\u2019re never -- they were never together, because in Auschwitz, the men went one side,\nthe women the other, and there were men who went to the right and to the left, and\nwomen who went to the right and the left. So they never were together again. But it gave\nan impression in the ghetto that they go somewhere, and they going to be together, and\nit\u2019s not so bad.",
        "Q: So 1-- in -- at the end of \u201941 - \u201942 - \u201943, you have no suspicion.",
        "A: Nobody had, even afterwards.",
        "Q: No -- afterw --",
        "A: And when -- when the train opened in Auschwitz, and I saw what Arbeit macht frei in\nAuschwitz, I still did not believe what it is.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I think we\u2019ll get there in -- in more detail --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- when --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- when we get to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Yes. So this lawyer, you remember his name?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What is his name?",
        "A: His name was Otto Freund.",
        "Q: Freund?",
        "A: Freund was a friend.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And he -- already, before he came to Terezin, he Czechisized it because he thought he\nwill function better as a lawyer under a Czech name, and spelled it f-a -- F-r-a-j-t, Frajt.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Frajt. That\u2019s a -- that\u2019s not a Jewish name, so --",
        "Q: And what kind of a guy was he, was he --",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: What kind of a person was he?",
        "A: A very nice, mild mannered, wonderful guy. And I think he suffered knowing what\u2019s\nhappening with his wife, and I think he had no influence, or didn\u2019t want to interfere. He\njust [indecipherable] tolerated it, and he didn\u2019t come back, and I inquired after the war if\nthere are any relatives of his, and couldn\u2019t find anybody.",
        "Q: And is it the case that he knew artists and musicians and that he introduced you to these\npeople, or is that not a connection?",
        "A: This was parallel. He knew some, and also I have recognized that the -- through him, that\nthose -- first the artists, the painters, and then about the musicians, that they had a job\nassigned during the day, the artists were in -- there was a technical office, technical\nbureau where the artists drew the blueprints for the engineers and the -- the technicians,\nand made poster f -- propaganda posters for the Germans. And in -- at night, they were\ndrawing the -- making the drawings of the real life in Terezin, which you may have seen -\n- mainly there\u2019s a book, and more books than one. And they smuggled some of that\nthrough these gendarmes. And there was also, in the agriculture department, they had\nhorses that were drawing -- pulling the -- the carts, and the horses produced manure, and\nthey took that manure out, and underneath, they smuggled out letters, and -- and these\nposters, and so -- so some of those, I don\u2019t know which way they went out, and some\nwere found in Switzerland.",
        "Q: And these were taken out by the sh -- the Czech gendarmes, knowingly?",
        "A: No, I -- no, the -- the Germans found those in Switzerland.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And of course, all the painters were immediately arrested. Some wound on -- wound up\non the small fortress, and some went directly to Auschwitz. And only one of them\nsurvived, it was Haas.",
        "Q: Leo Haas.",
        "A: Leo Haas --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- and I don\u2019t know that Fritta had this three year old child with him, on the small\nfortress. He was then deported from the fortress, and his wife died inside, from illness, at\nthe fortress, and Haas and his wife took care of this three year old boy, and I don\u2019t know\nhow, in the small fortress, a boy could survive. Anyway -- and he calls himself Tomas\nHaas Fritta. Not even frit -- not even Dalzig, Fritta.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, takes the first name, the first nickname.",
        "A: Fritta --",
        "Q: No, Fritta\u2019s the last name.",
        "A: Fritta was Fritz Dalzig, and he signed his drawings as Fritta.",
        "Q: Yeah, Fritta.",
        "A: And --",
        "Q: And that was called the painter\u2019s affair, when they were arrested, 1s that not\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Yup. And Haas survived, because they recognized his capabilities, that can be utilized in\na workshop, where counterfeit American and British money was printed, with which the\nGermans paid their spies in those countries.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. We\u2019re going to have to stop the tape.",
        "A: Yeah, I know, I saw --",
        "Q: You saw.\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "Q: When you were rooming with Frajt, the lawyer, right -- what\u2019s his first name?",
        "A: Otto.",
        "Q: Otto Frajt. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Truly Czech it\u2019s Ota.",
        "Q: Ota?",
        "A: O-t-a.",
        "Q: O-t-a.",
        "A: Otto in Czech is O-t-a.",
        "Q: Okay. So he, as an older person, cause he\u2019s an established lawyer, can introduce you to\nsome of the people who were artists and painters, who were working -- and they were\nworking in Magdeburg, am I correct? Is that where they\u2019re --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: There was -- some was in Magdeburg, but there was -- also was a technical office -- I\u2019ve\nnever seen it, that was not in a barrack, that was --",
        "Q: I -- I see.",
        "A: -- or it was a -- a specially constructed building, I\u2019m not sure that --",
        "Q: But 1s it -- is it through him that you met these --",
        "A: Through him de -- I found out that these people actually doing double duty, and the\nsecond duty was even a more important one than the first one. So I stealed some extra\nfood to them. And this is how we established a relationship, and I still don\u2019t want to\ncreate an idea that they were crazy about me, because I was nobody compared to them,\nthese were established people. That it could have been because of giving them some extra\nfood.",
        "Q: And why did you decide to give them extra food?",
        "A: Because a --",
        "Q: Because of what they were doing?",
        "A: -- the hard laborers got extra, the kids got extra, and there were people coming home\nfrom --from their eight or nine or 10 hours job, and sit down and started to draw till late\ninto the night, what I thought was important material for the future. And I didn\u2019t know\neven that it\u2019s being exported. So I had some -- as I said, sa -- additional emergency\nrations.",
        "Q: And did you --",
        "A: And through Schacter I met the composers. So I did the same for them, because they\nwere sitting at night, and composing, writing.",
        "Q: Did you bring the food to the painters and to the composers, yourself?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And -- and this was dangerous for you, if you were caught. Am I right, or not?",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t think it -- it would have messed up -- would have messed me up, but it wasn\u2019t\ndangerous, because the Germans were not inside the ghetto. There were no guards inside,\nexcept for those dru -- two drunk kids. But -- and there were no gendarmes inside, just\nthe ghetto police. And they didn\u2019t suspect, or -- you carry something.",
        "Q: So they wouldn\u2019t necessarily have checked anything?",
        "A: No, no. It wasn\u2019t dangerous what I did, it was, I said, maybe inappropriate from the\ngeneral point of view, favoring some individuals, but there were [indecipherable] six,\nseven painters.",
        "Q: So would you -- you go to where they were working at night, and give them the food at\nnight, do you remember?",
        "A: Some of them were living at very close quarters, cause -- not far from one another, and\nyes, you we -- the answer Is yes.",
        "Q: So you e --",
        "A: The short answer.",
        "Q: It is. But you\u2019d go at night, would you cook the food special, or would you simply take\nwhat was already there?",
        "A: No, no, no, that was -- that was stuff that -- that was -- I didn\u2019t cook special.",
        "Q: And would you stay --",
        "A: There was nothing to cook special, there were only the big kettles, you know?",
        "Q: Right. Would you stay with them, or would you --",
        "A: Yeah, I -- there were evenings when I stayed with them, but most evenings I spent\nsinging with Schacter.",
        "Q: In the choir?",
        "A: Yeah, we had almost every night the rehearsal.",
        "Q: And was this almost from the beginning?",
        "A: The -- from the beginning was the --",
        "Q: When he came in December?",
        "A: -- the singing in those basements after. And then, after June \u201942, when people could move\nfreely, he assembled the men and the women together in the basement of the military\nheadquarters near -- on the right of the church.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right.",
        "A: And that was during the day, a carpenter shop, and at night we put up some boards like\nthis, and the choir stood there and was singing and rehearsing. As soon as we could get\ntogether, he came up, he had one score of \u201cThe Bartered Bride,\u201d as a very popular Czech\nopera, and started to study with us. The singers had nothing to look at. There was no\nwritten music, there were no way of copying, and no time to copy, and not enough\nqualified people to copy music. So we learned by rote.",
        "Q: So would he sing?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: How -- how would you do it? P -- there was a piano?",
        "A: First there was a harmonium in -- there was a -- there were certain defi -- different de --\nwork details, one of them was movers who have moved heavy loads, really where they\nwere needed, when on the town square, the tents and the barracks weren\u2019t up, where more\nindustry roo -- projects were [indecipherable] production was kept. So these people were\ncarrying, then loading the trucks with the stuff that was assembled. And they were also\nmoving the German -- for the Germans when they -- when some was called off, and the\nnew officer came, the SS or so. He was mo -- they were moving their furniture and the\nluggage, and so. And they discovered somewhere in the room, a old harmonium. So one\nnight they, when it was dark, no moon, they brought the harmonium to that basement.\nAnd first we were playing -- Schacter was playing the harmonium, and then they found a\npiano without legs, and also brought it in, and the carpenters made some legs. Until they\nmade the legs and fastened them, the piano was standing on three crates.",
        "Q: And this was a grand piano?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. What\u2019s a harmonium? What does it look like?",
        "A: Like a -- like a -- we call it in church, the --",
        "Q: Organ?",
        "A: Organ.",
        "Q: A small --",
        "A: A small organ, not with pipes, but you had to pump --",
        "Q: With your feet.",
        "A: -- the air --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- into th -- the pipes were inside the harmonium.",
        "Q: We -- we -- let me go back a little bit. Ho -- how was it that you met Schacter? Did you\nmeet him when he came into the Sudeten barrack?",
        "A: No, I -- I was in the crowd of -- of all the others who went to sing with him, whom he\nencouraged to sing.",
        "Q: And why did you do that? You hadn\u2019t had much singing as a kid. What -- what --",
        "A: I -- at the last three or four months in Prague, before I went to -- you know, this was a\nlunch job, this -- the Jewish communities had free evenings, first time. I -- I joined a\nbarbershop quartet.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: As a bass. And we were singing. I don\u2019t think we were singing for money, we were\nsinging I think only for pleasure. And so I liked singing, and so I definitely volunteered to\nparticipate.",
        "Q: Right, right. But you had been singing more popular music, and now with Schacter, after\nthe popular Czech songs, seeing \u201cThe Bartered Bride\u201d --",
        "A: Well \u201cThe Bartered Bride\u201d is -- is a Czech popular opera --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- and almost everybody knows certain parts of it, and it wasn\u2019t difficult to learn the\nCzech. I -- I had a good ear, and a good voice, so it wasn\u2019t difficult to learn, once it was\nplayed in -- on the piano, to follow through on the --",
        "Q: The -- the lead singers, were these -- there are a lot of professional artists, singers in\nTerezin, were the lead singers more professional people, people who [indecipherable]",
        "A: When you say lead singers, I don\u2019t know what you mean. There were -- there were --",
        "Q: Soloists.",
        "A: -- soloists, yeah.",
        "Q: Soloists.",
        "A: They were from the Czech National Opera, and from the Vienna Opera, and later even\nfrom the Berlin opera.",
        "Q: Right. So you --",
        "A: They brought in German Jews as well, to Terezin.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So you were in the -- in the choir?",
        "A: Yeah, only in the choir.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: [inaudible]",
        "Q: And what was he like in rehearsal?",
        "A: Schacter?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Schacter is a -- was a lovable, pleasant person, until he sat behind the piano, then he\nbecame a tyrant. You were not allowed to look at the guy next to you, or even at the girl\nnext to you. You were not allowed to whisper. You had to focus on his eyes, because he\nwas conducting with his eyes, the hands on the -- on the keys, and his eyes were directing\nthe music. And if he noticed you did -- you\u2019re not attentive, if -- once he yelled at you,\nthe second time he threw you out.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So he --",
        "A: And -- and --",
        "Q: -- treated this very professionally?",
        "A: -- and nee -- nobody minded it, everybody wanted to be part of it. He did nev -- he never\nhad to advertise, people were flocking to him, he had the luxury of auditioning peoples.",
        "Q: And w-was he auditioning people for the choir?",
        "A: Yeah, for the choir, yes.",
        "Q: So were there people with good voices in the choir, tha -- from what you remember\u2019?",
        "A: Yeah, he -- he -- he makes sure you -- he had the unlimited amount of people were\ncoming to him, who wanted to participate.",
        "Q: And how many people ended up in the choir? I know that there were --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how many were doing these individual opera performances, but I know for\nthe Requiem there were 150. He started another Czech opera, and then when German\nJews came, and these were -- the German Jews they were not -- there were very few\nyoung people, very few. Very few young middle class, these were older, upper middle\nclass, and then the -- the prominent ones, the old ones who fought in World War I, with\nwhom the German played a cruel game. They promised them -- or told them, leave\neverything here, your furniture, your money, your belongings, the -- the glass in the\nshowcase. We are bringing you to a spa where you will have no worry. You will have\nmaid service, and room service, and food service, and laundry service. And these guys,\nafter observing three or four or five years, how the Germans treat -- how the Nazis treated\nthe German Jews in Germany, still believed the officer\u2019s word. The -- the reason that they\ncame, at a time when the barracks, and the houses of the town population were already\nfilled, and the only place for them was in the attics of the barracks. They will put straw\nmattresses on the floor, and you can imagine the old people going down to the floor to lay\ndown to sleep, and even worse to get up to sleep. And if you have heard about it, older\npeople have to go to the bathroom more often. So first to get up, and then climb over -- I\nguess these mattresses were one next to the other, to accommodate as many as possible,\nclimb over the people with a dim light, because the light was dim so the rest can sleep.\nAnd go down a flight of stairs, and then still the bathroom was not next to the stairs, still\ngo on. And if they couldn\u2019t hold it, I don\u2019t have to describe you the hygienic and sanitary\nconditions that have developed, which contributed to the acce -- accelerated death rate.\nAnd also, many of them lost will to live. They were de -- they were deceived,\nheartbroken by the German officers and -- to whom they had so much trust. And so many\nsuicides among them, among the old people. And then, as I said, quick deterioration\nthrough lack of sanitation and -- and cleanliness, and that was a very poor sight. But\nSchacter immediately took his Czech Jews, and started to study \u201cMarriage of Figaro,\u201d for\nthe same purpose, to pep up that -- those German prisoners. And \u201cMagic Flute,\u201d and the\nCzech singers were s -- most of the Czechs spoke German, because not only at the -- at\nthe border area, but most Czechs had frequent use for the German language. So German\nwas pretty used among the Czech Jews.",
        "Q: And these were concert versions of the operas?",
        "A: Concert versions, yeah -- no, no costumes, no.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]. And what did you use when you performed? Was that piano that had\nbeen given legs --",
        "A: Just the piano.",
        "Q: Just the piano.",
        "A: Just the piano.",
        "Q: Now, I\u2019m going to go off this topic for just a second, because you mentioned that the old\nGerman Jews often committed su -- many committed suicide. How did they commit\nsuicide? Did they jump out of windows?",
        "A: A window, yeah. And some may have had the -- the -- taken a excessive dose of sleeping\npills, or whatever they still brought with them. They deteriorated a very rapid fa -- rate.",
        "Q: Di -- wi -- I want to continue o-on your relationship and the work with Schacter, but I\nalso wanted to ask you, there were -- there were orchestras in Terezin, there are\ncomposers, there are other conductors, yes?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: So that there is a lot going on. Am I correct?",
        "A: How did it come about? Now there is a -- a saying going around, and you must have\nheard it, that the Germans picked Theresienstadt as a town to show off with. It wasn\u2019t that\nway. I mentioned it among other things in their hometown, they had to turn in their\nmusical instruments, and some didn\u2019t. And some even had the chutzpah, people who will\nread this may know what that means, had the guts to bring those ins -- smuggle those\ninstruments with 1 -- within those 110 pounds, instead of food and clothing, into Terezin,\nbecause they were so -- such ardent musicians, amateurs and professionals, who loved to\nplay, and because everybody thought it\u2019s going to be over in six months. I spoke about\nthe optimism. When the six months were over, they gave themselves another six months.\nSo they played in attics, and in cellars, to stay in shape for when they come out, they\nshould be in the same performance level as they came in. And although there are no --\nwere no Germans in the ghetto, nothing escaped them, they found out. And now a terrific\nfright and concern gripped everyone in the ghetto, because the Germans -- a few\nGermans kept all these thousands of Jews in check by imposing corrective punishment.\nSo what that means, were two kinds, either right away into the transport, with -- and these\npeople were marked, when they were in the transport, in Auschwitz they know who they\nare, and they select them -- direct them to the appropriate side, punishing side, or the\nsmall fortress. So nobody wanted to involve their wife, parents, children, siblings in such\na punishment, so there was a big concern. The head of the Council of Elders, Edelstein\ntold the camp commander why -- I mean, not in this exact wording, I\u2019m paraphrasing,\nwhy would you punish these few people? Look at the amount of talent you have\naccumulated here, why don\u2019t you think of a program where you can utilize them to show\nthe world how well you treat the Jews? That\u2019s when this idea came into being. It was not\na preconceived idea with the Germans before the ghetto was created. So not only were\nthese Jews not punished, and could retain their instruments, more instruments were\nbrought in from Prague, and before they determined how they are going to do -- show the\nworld how well they treat the Jews, they already divide -- devised a beautification\nprogram in anticipation of that, and a free time activities department was created. And in\nthe frame of this orchestras -- jazz has just come to -- to Europe from United States, so\nwe had a five member -- what is it called? Ghetto swingers. Ghetto swingers jazz team.\nThen there were the two musicians who played in the caf\u00e9. One of them was my cousin,\nthe accordionist, he was a piano and accor -- but there he played the accordion, and one\nwas a violinist. And -- and other of the quartets, and unbelievable, not the Germans, and\nnot the Council of Elders could have imagined what\u2019s getting news there. And not only\nmusic, there were theaters -- there were all the actors from -- from all these towns. The\ntheater, cabaret, those are very popular because they were throwing these verbal darts at\nthe Germans, in Czech language. Maybe some even in German, I don\u2019t know about those.\nAnd this was very uplifting, and very helping in -- in really reducing the anxieties of the\nlife that was destined for us. There were lectures. There were 1240 lectures on different\nsubjects. This is based on the notes from that -- that they found from that free activity --\nfree time activity list, by professors, chemists, biologists, rabbis. Nobody went to the\ntemple, but they went there to listen to the rabbi. And people who had no interest in\nchemistry and so, went to j -- just to get diversification, and -- and getting away from --\nfrom this dread life of ghetto. By the way, they called -- you know, Terezin in German is\nTheresienstadt, and the Nazis told these prominent people they go to Theresienbath,\nwhich is a Theresien spa. I didn\u2019t say it when we were on the subject. So it is an unbe --\nthere was more -- more of these cultural activities per capita than in New York or -- or\nanywhere else, in a day. And people after work went, and they -- they shortened their\nsleeping time, because they were not really strong with the -- with the food they were\ngetting, and I don\u2019t take blame for it. I just did what was -- we had. But it was -- it was\nunbelievable, it -- it was -- it grew like mushrooms after the rain.",
        "Q: And was this -- when Schacter came in December and started those little choirs in the\nmen\u2019s barrack, and then the women\u2019s barrack, was -- was that secret at that point, or\nthat\u2019s -- that was okay at that point? Do you remember?",
        "A: Again, there were no Germans in the barracks, and the gendarmes were out at -- outside\nat the gate, and this was happening in the cellar after work. I don\u2019t think it was\nclandestine or illegal, it was just unofficial and --",
        "Q: So that the permission that was gotten because Epstein said something to the Germans\nwas to bring in the instruments?",
        "A: That was only after it was decided that that\u2019s a good idea, we\u2019ll take advantage of it, and\nwe divide -- deci -- devise a program that will help them to project them to the world.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But I don\u2019t understand, they had occupied all of Europe, America was across the Atlantic,\nwhy would they have to care to show a good report card with good behavior or good\ntreatment of the Jews? I -- that\u2019s what I was thinking about, who -- for whom did they\nneed this? They were the masters of the world.",
        "Q: And all of this cultural activity, and intellectual activity started in 1942 as far as you\nremember?",
        "A: End of \u201942.",
        "Q: End of 42.",
        "A: End of \u201942.",
        "Q: Now did you -- besides -- if -- if you were rehearsing as much as --",
        "A: When you say that the -- that -- that [indecipherable] was happening before this okay by\nthe Germans. That was still not secret, but was not official.",
        "Q: Right. And that was performed publicly before it was part of this other plan?",
        "A: That was performed in that cellar, and then 1t was performed in that auditorium of that\nboy\u2019s home that we circled there, next to the town\u2019s square.",
        "Q: Right. Did you also go to performances of other groups, as well as being in rehearsals, or\ndid you [indecipherable] too much?",
        "A: I -- I did, but not too many, because I was -- I -- I f -- I went to cabarets because that was\nreally important to -- you know, when you are -- when you are under the -- somebody\u2019s\nthumb, if you can play a trick on him, makes you happy. So be -- being part of this -- this\nverbal dart throwing gave you even more an uplift than -- than -- than the singing.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Really? Did you -- did you go to lectures?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And did you go to chamber music, or the orchestra performances at all?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything about those performances? What you --",
        "A: No, I went most to piano recitals or sonatas. The --",
        "Q: The violin?",
        "A: Pardon? The violin and piano.",
        "Q: And piano.",
        "A: And there -- there were [indecipherable] Alice Sommer-Herz. She still lives, she is 85 --\n95.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: L-Lives in London. And unfortunately lost a son who was a excellent cellist. I seen him.",
        "Q: And she was a violinist, or she was a pianist?",
        "A: She piano.",
        "Q: Pianist.",
        "A: That -- that was -- that was also very uplifting. And I think by that time they must have,\nwith these all instruments, have -- one or two additional pianos came in.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. This is going to be an odd question. Who tuned the pianos? It\u2019s one thing to\ntune a violin, you can tune it, but were the pianos tuned?",
        "A: Oh, there were tuner --",
        "Q: There were tuners there?",
        "A: Yeah, the musicians themselves, Gideon Klein tuned our piano.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So they sounded -- they sounded good? These were good pianos?",
        "A: Yeah, there wasn\u2019t -- not a -- a -- you know, it\u2019s terrible when you get old, don\u2019t get old.\nWhat -- what happens to me is I had a perfect command of the English language without\never learning, just by hearing and reading. And suddenly in the middle of the sentence, a\nword -- a simple, regular conversation word doesn\u2019t come to mind. And it comes up in\nCzech and in German, the only two languages I learned formally.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: It\u2019s a -- it\u2019s embarrassing, you know?",
        "Q: At least it comes up in some language.",
        "A: Yeah, but you can\u2019t explain it in Czech to an American. So --",
        "Q: We have to stop and change the tape.\nEnd of Tape #6\nTape #7",
        "Q: Edgar, when you were at rehearsals with -- with Schacter, did he rehearse the soloists\nseparately, and then brought you together with the choir? Do you have any recollection?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, no. When -- when the choir was little progressed, then he tried the total\nensemble, yeah.",
        "Q: So you would rehearse separately from the soloists?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did he --",
        "A: They didn\u2019t need as much rehearsing because they were professionals, they have sung\nthese operas several times in their life.",
        "Q: So you guys in the choir needed more rehearsal?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: But you weren\u2019t singing as much as the -- n-not in these operas. In the Requiem you sang\nmore, as a choir than you did the operas. Am I correct, or not?",
        "A: Wherever the part of the --",
        "Q: Chorus.",
        "A: -- choir comes up, we were singing.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did he ever kick anyone out because they were terrible? Not because they were looking\nsideways --",
        "A: Terrible at singing?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: First of all he wouldn\u2019t have -- if he had recognized it in the beginning, he would not\nhave accepted person. And which a -- which was cruel, because everyone deserved a little\nuplift. But he let people be in during the rehearsals, and then for the performance he said,\n\u201cYou better go in the audience and watch.\u201d",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. That -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s as much as he did, but --",
        "Q: Did people get angry at that?",
        "A: I\u2019m sure they did --",
        "Q: I bet they did --",
        "A: I\u2019m sure, yeah --",
        "Q: -- they got angry, yeah. But you -- you stayed for the performances?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you have to get dressed in a particular way?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You just came in whene -- the wa -- any way you were.",
        "A: Then for the performances, you put on your best, and that was the best of the 110 pounds\nyou had brought in.",
        "Q: And you kept the 110 pounds of clothing, they weren\u2019t taken away from you?",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t 110 pounds of clothing, there was food --",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right.",
        "A: -- and there was bedding, and there was --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- other things, shaving, and it -- whatever I brought, I -- I had with me, whatever wasn\u2019t\nworn out, so I still had with me.",
        "Q: I just realized something. So you could bring in shaving cream --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- you could bring in soap, which --",
        "A: But what did you do when it ran out? Yeah.",
        "Q: -- but at some point it ran out, yeah, what happened?",
        "A: So you were shaving just -- soap -- somehow we had soap, I don\u2019t -- I think there was a\nissue, or issuing of soap. As I told you, I don\u2019t remember many details.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: So you f -- you use regular soap just so the razor slides better, and I was shaving at that\ntime with a straight razor. I didn\u2019t have a -- there were -- there were these Gillette double\nbladed razors, but I remember I was shaving with a straight razor.",
        "Q: And toothpaste?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Toothpaste?",
        "A: Toothpaste wasn\u2019t important, a toothbrush was important.",

        "A: It was disagreeable.",
        "Q: It was di --",
        "A: No, I -- I wash --",
        "Q: And -- and you -- and you washed your clothes, or was there laundry?",
        "A: There was a military laundry, and my mother, I mentioned, came three weeks after me,\nand first -- her first job was in a cleaning detail with buckets, and brushes and they were\ncleaning rooms in the children\u2019s home, and in the offices, and I don\u2019t know where --\nwhere else, where cleaning was necessary, and where the regular inhabitants did not\nclean. So -- and then she was in the laundry detail that was outside of town, that was on\nthe way to the small fortress, was a military laundry from -- used by the military before.\nAnd once a month you could put all your dirty stuff in a bag, marked, and give to them,\nand you got it two, three days back.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. And again I had an advantage my stuff could be washed more often, because my\nmother took the bag, and I believe she --",
        "Q: They actually have hot water there?",
        "A: I tell you exactly, I have no idea. I\u2019m sure they did because there was central steam\ncoming from somewhere. I\u2019m sure they did, a militar -- today they wash in cold water so\nthe stuff doesn\u2019t shrink or bleed, but at that time, things were washed in hot water.",
        "Q: Now, it sounds odd to have thousands and thousands of people giving their clothes in this\nghetto, to a central laundry. Doesn\u2019t it seem --",
        "A: Everyone had it in a bag, and it wasn\u2019t taken out of the bag, it was washed in the bag.",
        "Q: In the bag?",
        "A: In the bag.",
        "Q: And you got it back wet? When you got it back -- do you have any idea how the people\ndried their clothes?",
        "A: You better ask my wife, I don\u2019t remember. I never --",
        "Q: You never hung anything.",
        "A: I never had to hang that.",
        "Q: Huh.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, actually my stuff my mother brought, and I don\u2019t know whether she hung it\nsomewhere, or whether she -- she was a very fussy lady. At home I remember when I\nwent for vacation to her siblings, they were -- one day they were s-soaking, the next day\nthey were boiling the stuff, the third day they were washing. And then it was washed,\nthey took it down to the beach -- to the river, spread it out on the lawn and let it bleach in\nthe sun. And when it was dry they made it wet again so it can bleach some more. And --",
        "Q: Lot of work.",
        "A: Lot of work. And when she came to visit and our kids in the white socks ran around\nwithout shoes, the bottom, the sole was gray, even coming out from the washer. She said,\n\u201cYou see? These machines are no good, you have to wash by hand.\u201d So she took the\nsocks and started to wash them in soap. They didn\u2019t come out totally white, but she said,\n\u201cYou see? This is how it\u2019s supposed to look.\u201d What an old fashioned girl.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about your --",
        "A: We should talk about my mother, she\u2019s more interesting than I am.",
        "Q: Yes, yes, no. I -- no, I want to talk about your mother, and they we\u2019ll get back to the --\nthe -- the music. Your parents come a few weeks after you come, right, three weeks, am I\nright?",
        "A: Three weeks. And I was standing on the main street with a -- right in front of the church\nwhen she walked by and she looked at me like said, did you see what you get us into?\nYou know, I read it on her looks.",
        "Q: And she thought that you had brought her there?",
        "A: No, but --",
        "Q: It was -- but because they were keeping families together?",
        "A: They might have -- no, because if I wouldn\u2019t have volunteered, they might have still been\nthere, at home.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And you too.",
        "A: Ye -- yeah. She didn\u2019t say, but I could read it on the looks.",
        "Q: And where did they live when they first came?",
        "A: Mother went to Dresner, and Father went to the Hannover.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: It was already opened at that time.",
        "Q: Right. And your father is about how old at this point, in his 60\u2019s?",
        "A: He was 64 when he went in.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: 60 -- 60 -- yeah, 64 and a half, 64.",
        "Q: And your mother is 18 years younger. Do they both get work right away?",
        "A: He got a job, I don\u2019t know how he discharged it, peeling potatoes. It was a sitting job, and\nthese potatoes were stolen from the pigs, because half of them were rotten. They had not\nonly to peel them, they had to cut away all the rotten part. But if you were hungry you\ncould eat the [indecipherable] and you had some -- filled your stomach. So it was a good\njob for -- for some of the people. I don\u2019t know how he got it, I had no influence in that.\nBut he -- he wasn\u2019t very happy with the whole situation. He -- he sat at home, when he\nretired from working, and after the war, until he went to bed, he sat at home in the living\nroom, with reading, with a tie, jacket and shoes on. He would not make himself\ncomfortable. He always had to be presentable. So for him this life was -- was --",
        "Q: Was really awful.",
        "A: -- was very tough. And Mother, again, did the best under the circumstances, and as I said,\nshe even once was jailed, and -- by the Germans, because the woman from the upper bed\nhad something she shouldn\u2019t have had, or some contraband under the bed, and Mother\nwas on the lowest bed, so she was suspected of -- of is -- that being hers.",
        "Q: Okay, we have -- I\u2019m sorry, I have to interrupt you.",
        "A: That\u2019s a short one.",
        "Q: Sorry for the interruption. Y-You were talking about your mother being arrested because\nthe -- her bunkmate, the third tier, had contraband?",
        "A: Had some contraband underneath, and it was thought that it\u2019s hers, because it was under\nher bed. So she spent three days in the vault area of that commander of SS --\nKommandatur, how do you say that in English?",
        "Q: Commandant?",
        "A: Commandant\u2019s office, whatever.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And --",
        "Q: And was this Sydell\u2019s office? Was he still there or is this later?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember whether --",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know.",
        "A: -- that was on Sydell, or later.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But she -- she came out of it, she was unshaken that anything could happen to her\nbecause God 1s always with her. She --",
        "Q: She wasn\u2019t --",
        "A: She wasn\u2019t shaken --",
        "Q: -- hurt?",
        "A: -- she knew it\u2019s going to come out well, and it did three days later.",
        "Q: Were you worried?",
        "A: Yeah, sure. Father was -- he was falling apart. And -- because th -- you never knew\nwhat\u2019s ge -- you had no impact, and -- on -- on anything like that.",
        "Q: Now, s -- he was living at the opposite end of Terezin from where your mother was?",
        "A: Mother went to visit him, he --",
        "Q: She could visit -- she could go?",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah.",
        "Q: Yes. And so when she didn\u2019t come, he knew that something had happened. Was he\ninformed in some way that she was arrested, do you know?",
        "A: I think through me, we tried to first not tell him, and then we said it, and we said it\u2019s\nnothing, it\u2019s going to come out well. Actually we were lying, because we didn\u2019t know.\nBut -- and then in the end proved that we were -- we were right.",
        "Q: Now were you bringing extra food to your mother and your father? And was this mainly\nin the evening, when they were together? Or don\u2019t y --",
        "A: You made me think. Most of the time, because -- yeah, the Hannover, yes, but I also\noccasionally went to Mother separate and Father separate, but --",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Now, is there a time when they end up living together? No, they never live\ntogether?",
        "A: In Terezin, [indecipherable] no.",
        "Q: In Terezin, that\u2019s what I mean. They don\u2019t. And consequently the three of you are never\nliving together, so that you are all separate.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: Do you see them very often? Almost daily?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, I -- I was -- after all the kitchens were running, I could dedicate myself to --\nas I say, to some of it\u2019s menu making, and -- and -- but I did not have to stay in a kitchen,\nspend a shift, or so --",
        "Q: I see. So where did you eat mainly? Where did you take your meals?",
        "A: Where I was at the moment.",
        "Q: Where you -- so, would you wait in line?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: And where would you go -- the -- where people would go --",
        "A: In --",
        "Q: Just in the kitchen?",
        "A: In the kitchen, yeah.",
        "Q: So essentially you could eat whenever you wanted, as long as food was available?",
        "A: Yeah, sure. Told you that my aunt was right.",
        "Q: Yeah. No, no, for -- for sure she was right. And were your parents -- especially your\nfather, at some point found it advantageous that you had gone first? They -- did he realize\nthe implication?",
        "A: After the war, I found a poem where she writes about it, that they thank for their life to\nme. Which I don\u2019t [indecipherable] I know they\u2019re thankful, grateful for their life, for my\ndecision. They never mentioned it, and never came up and I never asked. But I found it in\none of the birthday poems.",
        "Q: And that you found after the war?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you -- but you were very devoted to them?",
        "A: Yeah, in spite of the hittings.",
        "Q: Right. But they stopped hitting at a certain point, yes?",
        "A: Yeah, when I got bigger than them.",
        "Q: Did they? Were they short people, or they tall people?",
        "A: No, Father was tall. All his brothers were tall, and his sisters, too.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Mother were shorter. Two sisters were little taller, but the rest of the family was medium\nS \u2014",
        "Q: Did they have a sense of humor?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: At least not in my presence. Not in my presence.",
        "Q: When -- when you -- I\u2019m going to come to the Verdi Requiem in a minute, but when you\nthink about -- if you close your eyes and think about walking around Terezin, and think\nabout what people were looking like, and smelling like and what the sounds were like --\nwas it hurt --",
        "A: I don\u2019t think they were smelling bad. People --",
        "Q: You don\u2019t think so?",
        "A: -- tried -- those who were able to move around, took care of their personal hygiene,\nincluding, or in spite of the cold water.",
        "Q: And did people look depressed?",
        "A: They -- I don\u2019t know whether it was depressed. I don\u2019t know whether -- I\u2019m not a\npsychologist, to be able to reco -- but they -- they did not look happy like as if they were\nat home, but it -- they -- the feeling must have been there, that they\u2019re better off than\nthose who are deported somewhere, because they were 60 kilometers from Prague. The\nmajority was -- were Czech speaking people. If they go to the east to Poland, they\u2019ll be\namong Polish people. They don\u2019t know how they will be received, how they will be, how\ntheir life will be with them, where they are the dominant part of the population. And\nthat\u2019s what the Germans Jews complained about, that the Czechs, because they were first\nthere, had the -- the privileged status, as privileged as it can be in a camp. But they -- they\nhad the connection --",
        "Q: Was that an accurate --",
        "A: -- yeah, su -- yeah.",
        "Q: It was an accurate portrayal?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you have any idea how many people understood that if they could be protected, they\nwould not be put in the transport? You felt protected, insofar as --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- one -- one could be --",
        "A: In spite I haven\u2019t been at the end.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So were there --",
        "A: You know, people tried, with connections -- if you knew someone in that office, if you\nknew someone very well, you could go there and say, do something with that card. So\nthey do something, but another family has to go.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So then you would feel -- should feel bad, although they may be going in the next\ntransport, but at that time you did something that -- it wasn\u2019t right. When I speak in\nschools, I had a sixth grader ask me, \u201cDo you feel guilty that you survived?\u201d And that\u2019s a\nheavy question for a sixth grader. And I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t feel guilty, because I would fe -- I\n-- | fe -- I would feel guilty if I would have caused somebody else to die, but I don\u2019t feel\nguilty that I survived, I only feel sad for those who didn\u2019t. And this -- that -- you get\nsome of these tough questions from those kids.",
        "Q: Did you ever feel -- forget guilty, because clearly you didn\u2019t do something against\nanybody, right? But there is a kind of -- I don\u2019t know whether I want to call it moral\ncompromise one makes. You can\u2019t be morally pure in a situation like that. So the fact that\nyou\u2019re protected always means that someone else is unprotected.",
        "A: Yeah. The self preservation --",
        "Q: The self preservation, yeah --",
        "A: No, no, the -- the act, or the thought of self preser --",
        "Q: Is strong.",
        "A: -- preservation, makes you partial to yourself without regard about somebody else.",
        "Q: And that you understood, for a long time.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about the Requiem.",
        "A: No, that comes afterwards. First we have to talk about the inspection of the international\nRed Cross. And the Germans just decided what they will do, and who will be there,\nreport card writer. We found out it\u2019s the international Red Cross, everybody was happy.\nNow, the international Red Cross, they will force them to make it real, a proper, a good\nand beneficial stay here. Give all of us to have a beneficial stay. So it was designated\nwhich way they will led -- be led, on that -- that was the main street between the square\nand the -- and the church. The barracks and tents, where the war industrial production\nwas taking place was all taken down. The girls from the agriculture planted lawn and --\nand flower beds on that square. And the houses on that street all got a face lift, a -- a new\ncoat of paint. And stores were opened, money was printed. Have you seen the money?\nYou must have.",
        "Q: [inaudible].",
        "A: Terezin money in all denominations, and it looks like money of any other country, except\nfor George Washington, there was Moses with the two tablets on it. And there was not\nmuch to do with it, becau -- so they opened the bank, and you could make a -- a savings\naccount, but there was no interest on your money, just to deposit it.",
        "Q: So when did all of that start? The pre -- the -- the preparation for the \u00b044 -- do you know?",
        "A: End of \u00b042, beginning of *43.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s a long period of time?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And there was a shoe store and the clothes store, and I think I told you about it. They put\nthe -- the clothing that was in that warehouse was suddenly put out, put on coat -- a co --\ncoat hangars, and exposed and exhibited in that store, and the shoes, too. And that was\nthat -- the only benefit of that money. You could buy for the -- get the money, because\nafter three years, your shoes wear, and your clothes wear, you have not much to change.\nSo that was a benefit. There was a grocery store, and they were selling there mustard and\nrelish. I don\u2019t know, the Germans must have had a -- a surplus of those two items. But it\nwas a good -- good to -- to vary a taste of your slice of bread that you got.",
        "Q: And who got the -- everybody get the money, or only a certain portion of you?",
        "A: Those who worked.",
        "Q: Those who worked.",
        "A: Those who worked. And you [indecipherable] enough you could take a friend. You paid\nfor tickets for the -- for those performances. And I don\u2019t know what else you could use\nyour money for, the stores, the bank, the -- the [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And you could buy a stamp, that you could send somebody in Prague, which they woos --\nwould use the stamp to send you a food package.",
        "Q: So you could receive food packages?",
        "A: You could get a food package. There\u2019s no guarantee th -- that you get everything that\u2019s in\nthe package.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Some the Germans would steal, and some th -- take out, consider contraband. And you\nknow, if they send a loaf of bread it was cut open to see where there\u2019s anything inside\nthat shouldn\u2019t be there. Like in prisons. And so -- and some was stolen by the people who\nworked in that Terezin Post Office, other Jews. That\u2019s the dark side of the prisoners. And\nso these were the few things I can remember the money was good for.",
        "Q: So if this starts in \u201943, all the preparations, is that when Schacter comes up with the idea\nof the Verdi Requiem?",
        "A: For some reason, in January \u00b043, the last transport was sent away, and here we are in\nJuly, and no transports since January. I have no idea why. Everybody was up and happy,\nthat this is the end of deportations. So he also had got the courage to start to implement\nwhat he was thinking the Requiem, knowing, or at least anticipating that this choir will\nstay together. There was a huge uproar when he came up with that idea. All the scholars\nand professors, and the -- and the bor -- the borders -- the -- the elder -- the -- the Council\nof Elders, they all protested for different reasons. The -- the scholars and the rabbis, why\nwould you as Jews in a Jewish ghetto perform a Catholic mass for the dead, when there\nare comparable works on Jewish themes? [indecipherable] and so, which cannot be\nperformed in -- anywhere in occupied Europe, and this is the only place you could. He\ndid not give in to this. He didn\u2019t say it openly because it was dangerous to say, but I\nknow that he -- his mind was on being -- wanting to be able to sing to the Germans in\nLatin what he couldn\u2019t tell them in German to their face. Like the -- the [indecipherable]\nthe day of wrath, the [indecipherable] that it -- 1-in this book, the names of all the sinners\nare inscribed, and none will escape the punishment. So this -- there were about three or\nfour such occasions. And this is what drove him to get it out of him, and be able, even for\ndistance, in the absentia, to tell the Germans.",
        "Q: You mean whether the Germans were there or not?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Wh -- you\u2019re saying whether the Germans were there or not to hear it.",
        "A: No, yeah, they were not there.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the Council of Elders thought, if the Germans find out the intentions behind this\nperformance, that will really be dangerous for the singers and for him, and maybe even\nimplications for the rest of the population. And --",
        "Q: I ne -- I need to interrupt you, I\u2019m sorry --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- I\u2019m going to stop the tape [indecipherable]",
        "A: Is another oil truck coming 1n?",
        "Q: No.\nEnd of Tape #7\nTape #8",
        "Q: Edgar, you were talking about the council being possibly upset if the German -- I mean --",
        "A: Really upset.",
        "Q: -- upset if the Germans would find out. Now, let me ask you something. You said you\nknow from Schacter what -- what he was really feeling.",
        "A: That was the driving thought behind --",
        "Q: Yes. Yeah, is -- is that because you were rooming with him at this time, and you talked\nwith him?",
        "A: Yeah. This friend of mine, the lawyer, meanwhile was deported, and we found in a attic\nof a house in the a backyard of one of those private houses, that must have been a\nmother-in-law arrangement, and the stairs up to the attic, and with a carpenter connection\nagain, we got a -- a little separation, and we had a room with privacy for the two of us.\nAnd so I was pretty much informed about him, his lifestyle, his thoughts, and his\ndetermination. And --",
        "Q: But let me ask you -- I -- I just want to know -- understand something. You -- did you\nmeet him separately from joining the choir, or only when you joined the choir?",
        "A: Through the choir --",
        "Q: Through [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- we met, and for -- for some reasons, including that I provided some more food for him,\nwe ca -- we came close.",
        "Q: You got together, I see.",
        "A: I still mention, I don\u2019t have any complexes that he would have found in me a -- a level\ncompanion, cause I was a young guy, and his circle were the musi -- social circle were\nthe musicians, the composers, and he had other interests. But we were very close, and\nvery good, and --",
        "Q: And what was the difference in age between the two of you, do you think?",
        "A: He was born 1905, so it was about 19 years.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a big difference, yes. But you -- you spent a lot of time together, I gather?",
        "A: Yeah. Not a -- not a lot. We were both --",
        "Q: Busy.",
        "A: -- during the day we were both working, and then -- he then became part of that free time\ndepartment. And I think his assignment, his job was working within this department so he\ndidn\u2019t have to go somewhere to a -- I don\u2019t know stone quarry, or whatever he worked in\nin that. So that was his day job. And then in the evening, after everybody finished, they\ncame for rehearsal.",
        "Q: So did he tell you ver -- talk to you about wanting to do the Verdi Requiem?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And he told you what --",
        "A: And he said why, that we can\u2019t tell them in German, and I -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it has to come\nout, and this is one way I can get it out. And when he was told about all the dangers, he\ntold everyone in the choir, \u201cIt is assumed to be dangerous to you, to us, to the rest of the\ninmates here. So if you don\u2019t want to be part of it, I don\u2019t feel bad if you leave.\u201d Nobody\nleft.",
        "Q: And what did the council th-think about the danger, that -- that somehow the Nazis would\ndiscover his intention?",
        "A: That if they find out that he -- that the purpose of this was to tell them, you bastards, you\ngoing to get it at one point, that they will not appreciate it.",
        "Q: But let me ask you something, when you read the words of the Verdi Requiem, it\u2019s als --\nthere\u2019s also words of forgive these people, whoever they are, who -- who, and the\nRequiem is speaking about both the wrath of God and begging for forgiveness, so --",
        "A: Yes, so this -- this part we ignored.",
        "Q: But you sang it.",
        "A: And -- yeah, ignored as a -- as a thought --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- that propelled us to do it.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And in saying the -- the Libera me, was interpreted as set me free from here.",
        "Q: So some of it was said for the Jews, and some of it was said against the -- the Nazis, as\nthe interpretation, yes?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: When -- when you were rehearsing, did you feel this kind of emotion, that you -- wh-\nwhen -- just when you\u2019re rehearsing yourself --",
        "A: No, I just felt I\u2019m part of a group that despises the Germans and the Nazis, and that this 1s\nthe best we can do to get even with them within our capabilities.",
        "Q: What was the -- were the rehearsals more intense than when you did \u201cThe Bartered\nBride,\u201d and \u201cThe Magic Flute,\u201d and \u201cThe Marriage of Figaro\u2019\u2019?",
        "A: It was, because it was a different language, and it was much more difficult music.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh, right.",
        "A: And much more concentration was required. And some people who didn\u2019t work in the\nkitchen, were not so well-fed to really dedicate themselves to such a -- that was a hard --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- work on a half empty stomach.",
        "Q: Yes, it\u2019s difficult singing.",
        "A: Yeah. So with the fact that there were no transports, he was encouraged that he\u2019 ll have an\neasy job, as easy as this can be. Th -- I am sure Toscanini would have never undertaken it\nwith -- with well-fed people, to teach them without a score. So it took six weeks -- we\nwere six weeks into the rehearsal when the rumors sprung up the transports will resume.\nSo every time a transport 1s put together, people from different sectors are involved. And\nso the choir members anticipated that some of them will definitely be included in the\ntransport. So they pushed him to make one performance for them, for their hard work, so\nthey can enjoy performing it. And he would not, because it wasn\u2019t up to his standards yet.\nBut then it became known that by September six, 5,000 people will be deported. He\ncouldn\u2019t resist, because he knew a lot of them will be in it, and he made a performance\nfor them and their families and friends, not the o -- open, public sh -- performance.",
        "Q: So this is September \u00b043?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And the irony with this, the sad irony, that these 5,000 people -- about -- he lost about\nhalf the choir, and these people went to Auschwitz and they came there, and they were\ntreated differently than anybody else who came before them and after them. They could\nretain their clothes, they could retain their luggage, and they went into a camp which was\nfrom then on called the family camp. They lived together, not in privacy, but families\nwere together. And they were there for six months, and they were not working, they did\nnot -- and this Freddie Hirsch, he took care of the kids, entertained them and taught them.\nAls -- also made sport with them, and art, and he really took care of the kids. And this\ngroup was held there while the Germans were negotiating with the allies in exchange of\nthe German prisoners of war for these Jews, and also some war material. They wanted\nsome trucks, and -- and of course the allies wouldn\u2019t give the Germans another few\nthousand soldiers that will then turn against them, and trucks that they will use in the war\nagainst them. So when the negotiations fell through, in one night, all of those who were\nstill alive from the 5,000 went into the gas. Was exactly three months -- six months later,\non March eight. And this is also -- on March seventh is the -- was Masaryks\u2019 birthday,\nPresident Masaryk, the first -- the creator of Czechoslovakia. So could be that had\nsomething to do with it, because they were -- they were planning the -- timing some\nthings to coincide with some -- something that gives you a bigger -- a ce -- bor -- bigger\npain.",
        "Q: Was Schacter worried that he was going to be deported at that point?",
        "A: No, hadn\u2019t --",
        "Q: No, because --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Was he protected in some way, do you think?",
        "A: Not that I knew, but those people who put together the transport list had some kind of\ndirectives whom to leave out, as long as it was possible.",
        "Q: And as far as you know, who was it who put together these transport lists?",
        "A: There was a department, it was called evidence. Evidence is where all the files about\nevery single one who came into Terezin was kept. A card with a name, with a transport,\ndate of birth, a transport when they came in, and -- and also the transporting date when\nthey left Terezin. I did after the war search, y -- my parents survived, in spite of\nSchliesser being sent to Auschwitz, and myself, my parents survived. I thought the easiest\nthing would have been if he had written on top of the card -- of their card, do not deport\nit, initial it, that would have been the easiest. I got copies of those cards, there\u2019s nothing\nthere, and I was researching how he did it, because he must have done it, because it\u2019s\ninconceivable that two, old, useless people would stay there, especially before the Red\nCross came, they deported a lot of old people, they wanted only -- they wanted the Red\nCross only to see young, good looking people.",
        "Q: Maybe there was a special section for cards, a different place.",
        "A: So the -- the staff in that office --",
        "Q: Would do it.",
        "A: -- did it.",
        "Q: And was that then approved by the council, or did they just do it themselves?",
        "A: The head of the Council of Elders had to sign the transport list.",
        "Q: List.",
        "A: And then later we get to why he was -- and the whole Council of Elders was sent away.\nHe must have found out where they go, and what\u2019s happening, and their destination, and\nhe refused to sign it. He told the camp commander, you sign it. So he, the camp\ncommander, must have guessed that he knows what\u2019s happening, and didn\u2019t want the\nword to be spread among the inmates because a panic would be created. So the whole\ncouncil left. But even though in September six, and the -- half the choir left, and they\nhave -- they have -- he has recruited new people and started the whole thing from the\nbeginning with them. And he lost one more time, less people, and recruited new and\nstarted a third time with new people. And then in January \u201944 was the first performance.",
        "Q: With the new -- with the new group. Did any of the soloists get deported --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- or was it only among the choir?",
        "A: Maybe some. I didn\u2019t know all of them --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] yeah.",
        "A: -- but those [indecipherable] Schacter did not.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, in -- in the Requiem group --",
        "A: Yeah, no.",
        "Q: -- the soloists did not get deported.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And he had two for each part, should something happen to one, he has a replacement.",
        "Q: Another person.",
        "A: [indecipherable] good organi --",
        "Q: And when you did the September performance, September \u201943, before that first\ndeportation, was that with a piano accompaniment?",
        "A: Everything was only piano --",
        "Q: Only piano.",
        "A: All the time, only piano.",
        "Q: And did he --",
        "A: And when I listen now to a Requiem with a concert, and a -- the -- the trumpets and the\ndrums, I said how -- it seemed to us like -- like absolutely perfect performance, just the\npiano.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And a crappy piano on top of it. How did they bring out all these -- these impressions,\nthese results [indecipherable] of -- that the orchestra can provide.",
        "Q: And did he play the piano, or did he do the conducting and someone else played?",
        "A: No, bu -- there -- during the rehearsal he played the piano, and do -- and during -- in the\nperformance, Gideon Klein played.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: They were very close together.",
        "Q: And did Gideon kli -- Klein ever play at the rehearsals?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s somewhat odd, however, to play only at a performance, and never at a\nrehearsal.",
        "A: Gideon Klein had other work to do --",
        "Q: Yeah, well he\u2019s --",
        "A: -- he -- he was composing --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and he was playing per -- giving performances. Schacter, that\u2019s why I said he didn\u2019t\ntolerate any inattention, because everybody had to look at his eyes, and see when he gets\nthe signal.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything ever going wrong in the concerts?",
        "A: Wrong?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: In the concert?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure it did, but everybody was so grateful for it that -- that either they didn\u2019t notice,\ndidn\u2019t want to notice, didn\u2019t make an impact on them, they were happy to -- to be part of\nit whether active or passive.",
        "Q: Now, once you started giving performances, or Schacter is conducting the performances\nof the Requiem, starting in January \u00b044 -- January \u00b044, right? You give about 14 or 15 --",
        "A: 15, yeah.",
        "Q: 15 performances.",
        "A: And each time with less singers.",
        "Q: So you ne -- he never restarts again, he just accommodates?",
        "A: Only three times. Only three times he started to -- with new people. And then after the\n15\", he was left with 60 singers.",
        "Q: Out of 150.",
        "A: And not the same amount in each voice.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So he didn\u2019t want it. But then came the order from camp commander, that he wants a\nperformance of the Requiem for high SS officials who came from Vienna and Prague,\nfrom Berlin, to shake the hands of the Red Cross people who were also invited -- no\nJews.",
        "Q: This is -- this is Rahm, right?",
        "A: Rahm, yeah. And you know they had to pay homage to the Red Cross [indecipherable]\nand so now, I didn\u2019t know -- he didn\u2019t want to do it with the -- with the regular choir, but\nit was an opportunity he was dreaming of. Not only can he sing it to them for distance,\nbut he has them right in front of him, they are sitting there, and he can really tell them.\nAnd the paradox again is, that we all thought -- we told him, and the Germans were the\nonly ones who knew that we were actually singing our own Requiem. You know, they\nknew where we will end up. They didn\u2019t think that there would be some survivors. So\nthat was a mutual giving it to each other.",
        "Q: And the Germans knew what was being sung, because they knew the Catholic liturgy.",
        "A: I think -- I\u2019m sure, yeah. But I think they -- they thought it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a musical\nperformance, and -- but they also understood the meaning of it, and what\u2019s going to\nhappen with us, that this 1s --",
        "Q: Your own Requiem.",
        "A: Our own eulogy. The -- when this Red Cross came, I couldn\u2019t understand that they accept\nthe German conditions that they will not interview people at random on the street, only\nspecial auditioned people that the Germans prepared to meet them. And they knew that\nthey\u2019re saying lies, but it was again against the threat of the whole family being\nendangered if they refuse. So they did it. But I don\u2019t -- still don\u2019t understand, if you were\npsychologist, rather than philosophy doctor, I would ask you, how is it possible to\naudition, and indoctrinate little kids to the same performance? When they came to the\nplayground, and there were some kids who never been on a playground because they\nwere not allowed at home to go, the little ones. When they came for the chocolate bar that\nwas on the table in front of the playground, the only one uniform was Rahm, and they\nhad to address him uncle, and they, \u201cUncle Rahm, again chocolate?\u201d As if they were\nalready fed up with chocolate, and there were some kids who never knew what chocolate\nwas because it wasn\u2019t on their ration tickets at home. This I don\u2019t understand, how they\ngot the kids to do that. Maybe they told them you\u2019re going to play a theater or whatever.\nBut this were tough for me to understand.",
        "Q: Did you see that? Were you there?",
        "A: No, not --",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: -- not, I didn\u2019t --",
        "Q: Were you told that at the time?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, by the -- the -- those who were in charge of the kids. And the agriculture\nworkers, and my wife among them, dressed in shorts, and nice blouse, marching by with\nthe rake, or the -- the -- the spade over the shoulder, singing happy songs going to work.\nAnd the orchestra was playing in that pavilion on the -- on the sta -- on the town square.\nIt was a real happy town. This doesn\u2019t belong to my li -- yeah, I hear the party. After the\nwar, in -- in Newton was a Harvard philosophy psychology professor who researched to\nwrite a book about the Red Cross, International Red Cross at that time, what they should\nhave done and didn\u2019t do, and they shouldn\u2019t have done and did do. And he was\nresearching it, and I knew about it because I was translating his papers that he brought\nfrom Germany, from Austria, even the French. And at one point he told me he had an\nappointment with the then president of the International Red Cross, Dr. Rossler. In his\noffice, in his factory -- he had aluminum, a huge aluminum factory in Switzerland, and he\ncame there, and the secretary says, \u201cOh, Dr. Rossler called, he apologizes, he\u2019 be an\nhour, hour and a half late from another appointment. Make yourself comfortable in the\nlibrary.\u201d Brought in cup of coffee, said [indecipherable] whatever. And he perused -- and\nhe found documents that he had branch factories in Austria and in Germany where he\nused prisoners from concentration camp. So how much was his enthusiasm to confront\nGermans, the Nazis? Speaks for itself. So --",
        "Q: Were you supposed to be interviewed by anybody during this time? Where -- where were\nyou when they were visiting, did you see them?",
        "A: I -- I was just doing my work, I was not --",
        "Q: Are you surprised that nobody said anything?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. You think that fear was --",
        "A: And I\u2019m sorry they didn\u2019t, but some single guy who didn\u2019t have a family could have\nspilled the beans, but 1t wouldn\u2019t have helped, because this was called the International\nRed Cross, but the seven directors all were Swiss.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: There was no internationality in that.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And so it was very well done, like a real Potemkin village, that the Germans orchestrated.\nBefore that cross -- Red Cross came I mentioned the old people -- a lot of old --\nthousands of old people were deported, and after that, 1t must have been under the\ninfluence of the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto that the Germans did not want it to happen\nin other ghettos as well, so all able bodied people who were not necessary for the war\nindustry, and like agriculture for where they produced for the Germans, and those who\nwere necessary to maintain the functioning of the town, of the ghetto as such, the\nphysical functioning, were all deported, and Schliesser was gone, and I was among -- the\nkitchens were running, so I was no I-longer needed. So that was end of September 44. I\nwent and --",
        "Q: Let me -- let me -- let me hold it for one second. This performance for the Germans, was\nit Germans sitting in the front row?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you can see them, and who -- do you see Eichmann. Is he there?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know Eichmann --",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: -- | -- he -- he jus -- it is said that he was there, but -- and it -- we often heard Eichmann is\nin Terezin, transports will go. They knew that he was in charge of transports. But I never\nsaw him face to face, so I wouldn\u2019t have recognized him among that group.",
        "Q: Now, I know that you reported -- you reported in octo -- October one of 1944.",
        "A: October oneth, okay.",
        "Q: So then [indecipherable] what happens between September -- the perfor -- the -- wait a\nsecond, June -- I\u2019m sorry, June of \u201944 and October? Does Schacter keep you folks\nsinging? There\u2019s a few months there after -- after the Red Cross visit, or is he deported?",
        "A: He was deported after me.",
        "Q: After you.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know -- when I left --",
        "Q: I see, he was still there --",
        "A: -- he was still there, and I didn\u2019t know or think that he will be also deported.",
        "Q: I see. So does the choir -- does he keep working with people? Do you --",
        "A: We -- we went -- after the Red Cross visit, we still did -- we perfor -- we performed, and\nthat was not much of a choir required, Pergolesi\u2019s \u201cLa Serva Padrone\u201d, it was mainly\nsoloists and a small choir, but -- and we were doing mainly get-togethers with anyone\nwho wanted could come and -- and listen.",
        "Q: So it became much more informal?",
        "A: Yeah, informal.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Did you end up learning music? Could you read music by this time?",
        "A: No, but Schacter taught me. He started to teach me to play the piano, then I started to\nread music. And unfortunately, it didn\u2019t go for very long, and after the war I had no\nchance to resume. I had to work to maintain my parents and myself because we had\nnothing except what they had left from the 110 pounds. I had nothing, coming from\nAuschwitz. So there was never an opportunity for me to break and study music.",
        "Q: Right. We have to turn -- change the tape.\nEnd of Tape #8\nTape #9",
        "Q: Edgar, prior to the -- the visit of the Red Cross, which was as far as I know, June 24\",\n1944, di -- th-the painter\u2019s affair, they arrested the pain -- the artist was before that, am I\ncorrect?",
        "A: It was before that.",
        "Q: And so they were deported before the performance?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Was that also surprising to you that that happened?",
        "A: We found out that -- why it happened, I don\u2019t know that -- how -- how it became known,\nbut we found out in the -- on the street that the Germans were [indecipherable] for this.",
        "Q: Right, for the sort of undercover --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. Now, you said that Schacter was a very sweet guy when he wasn\u2019t being a\nconductor, but once he was going to be serious about his music, he was a tyrant. Was he\nalso charismatic? Was he also a very compelling person, or was he just very strict when\nhe was doing his --",
        "A: While we were working?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what do you mean by charismatic.",
        "Q: Well, we --",
        "A: He just was -- he demanded full attention, there was -- there was nothing else but\nrehearsing, and if you wanted to be with him, you had to pay full attention.",
        "Q: I think what I mean is, obviously people wanted to be with him.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t just the music, because you could have somebody in front of you who 1s\nconducting, who you didn\u2019t want to be with, right? I mean, the music alone wouldn\u2019t\nnecessarily be enough if someone wasn\u2019t interesting, or taught you well. I mean, he had\nto have something.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: When he was teaching you piano, was he easier on you?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: He was?",
        "A: This wa -- yeah, well this was -- he was not aiming to make me acam -- academy\nmember, but he was starting to teach me music. Whether it was the relationship that he\nwas easier, but he did not have a -- I don\u2019t think he set a goal for himself where I should\nbe at what time --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- with my piano knowledge, but [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Now didn\u2019t he also give some recitals, piano recitals, or did he accompany people?",
        "A: I think he did accompany some. Not very often, but I don\u2019t think he gave recitals --",
        "Q: Did he compose?",
        "A: -- because there were better pianists than he was.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, than him, uh-huh. And was he a composer also?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: So he was primarily a conductor, yes. Did he ever conduct some of the work of the\ncomposers who were working in Terezin, Olan, or --",
        "A: Very few of those works were presented to the public. They -- they played it, they\nperformed it for the critique of the other musicians only. So those compositions were not\nheard in public in Terezin.",
        "Q: Although \u201cBrundibar\u201d was, wasn\u2019t it?",
        "A: \u201cBrundibar\u201d is another story. That was composed in Prague, still, and when Krasa was\ndeported to Terezin, he left the manuscript with the director of the orphanage, who was a\nmusician himself. And unbeknownst to Krasa, this director, Freundenfeld was his name,\nstudied with the kids \u201cBrundibar,\u201d and performed in Prague.",
        "Q: In Prague.",
        "A: And Krasa had no idea about it.",
        "Q: Huh.",
        "A: So when we came to Prague -- to -- to Terezin, he continued to work with \u201cBrundibar\u201d\nwith an enlarged ensemble, it -- other kids, not just those from the orphanage. And he --\nand Krasa was -- was very happy with it. He did not interfere or participate in anything\nelse, or any of those performances. There was a time when Schacter auditioned -- not\nauditioned, rehearsed with the kids, but he never conducted \u201cBrundibar.\u201d It was always\nthis Freundenfeld.",
        "Q: Huh. So often the person who rehearsed the kids would not necessarily be the one that\nwould --",
        "A: No, it was not very often. This Freundenfeld, he was dedicated to that. There were 55\nperformances of \u201cBrundibar\u2019\u2019.",
        "Q: Of bru -- yes. Did you see it?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you like it?",
        "A: Yeah, it was a -- it was the same -- the same motive as the Requiem, just a smaller\nframework that -- that was the -- especially with a [indecipherable] with the finale, where\nthey sing we have overcome the oppressor, and we won, and victory is at hand. That was\n-- and the Germans didn\u2019t know, because they were singing with -- in Czech. So that was\na similar kind of a resistance, or at least a sole improvement and spiritual enlightenment\nas the --",
        "Q: But what -- from what you explained, it\u2019s clear that the Germans are oppressors, but it\nwas not clear to you or your colleagues that they were murderers.",
        "A: No, that --",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: Now let me -- there was a -- one guy from Terezin went to Auschwitz, and one of the SS\nmen, a disgruntled SS man was a schoolmate in Sudeten. He brought in the SS uniform\nand took him out on a motorcycle from Auschwitz. And he came to Prague -- to Terezin,\nand he spoke with Edelstein, and told him about what\u2019s happening, and nobody would\nbelieve him. This is impossible, it is -- it\u2019s unthinkable. But then there were some other --\nfor instance, those people who were helping load or unload the -- the dep-deportees\nnoticed on the wagons that the -- always the same ones were coming back, you know,\nthey are numbered, coded, numbered. And so one of them knew there is somewhere a\nboard loose behind the frame of the -- of that little window that\u2019s up there, the barred\nwindow. He said, when you arrive, look where, and write it down, and put it in there,\nunder that trimming. And it came back Auschwitz but the person could not describe\nanything back -- because when you come to Auschwitz, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s\nhappening, you know -- know you\u2019re getting a rougher treatment right away, but you\nhave no idea. I know from my own experience.",
        "Q: How did you find out about this man who was taken out of Auschwitz by the -- did you\nfind it out when you were in Terezin or after?",
        "A: After.",
        "Q: After.",
        "A: After.",
        "Q: You think you would have believed him, if he had told you? What do you think?",
        "A: If I had known him as somebody who does not exaggerate, I -- I might have --",
        "Q: When you think about Edelstein just saying it can\u2019t be, when he\u2019s -- finally has before\nhim, someone --",
        "A: It\u2019s odd.",
        "Q: -- do you think about what -- what\u2019s the matter [indecipherable]",
        "A: You could think he wants to make himself interesting, or -- 1t\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s unthinkable to a\nnormal person. Not that I consider myself totally normal, but --",
        "Q: And do you think this is \u201943 or \u201944? Or earlier?",
        "A: Four ya -- \u00b044.",
        "Q: \"44. And are there no other rumors coming through? Nothing?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Nothing is coming through to you because you\u2019re so isolated.",
        "A: No. It was a -- one other person that escaped from Auschwitz, a -- a Rudolph Vrba. I\ndon\u2019t know how he did it, I know that there were a group that dug a hole, and covered it\nup, and put on top something that repels the dogs, so they wouldn\u2019t give it away that they\nare in there. And they -- they escaped -- some of them --",
        "Q: There are four Jews at that time --",
        "A: No.",

        "Q: So what is he -- what -- what do you think he\u2019s thinking?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I think if it is really true, he doesn\u2019t want to have the responsibility. He\nmay have weighed -- like --",
        "Q: And who comes after him?",
        "A: A German, Dr. Epstein. And he was not a -- really a strong person to push for\nimprovement, so -- so he did what he was told, and then he was shot, and the new camp\ncommander was an Austrian SS man, and he put in an Austrian man to be the head of the\ncouncil, Murmelstein. He was not a very nice person. He was very self-centered. And\nafter the war he wound up in the Jewish archives in the Vatican, in the library.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You did.",
        "A: Definitely. They tried their best. Of course, as -- as -- as the carpenter stole a board, and\nthe cook stole a -- a piece of bread or something else, they also did favors for their family\nand maybe even close friends, that were at the -- at the cost of -- of other -- somebody\nelse. I -- I don\u2019t think that anybody under those circumstances would stay totally clean.",

        "Q: Now this was not a passenger train that you went on.",
        "A: No, that was not.",
        "Q: This is a cattle train.",
        "A: It was not any more. And there were a lot of people, about close to 70, and not everybody\ncould sit at the same time, you had to alternate. And if one of the older people fainted, or\ndied, then they lied there, so it took up two additional spaces for someone to sit down.\nAnd -- sorry -- we didn\u2019t know how long we\u2019re going to be on the trip -- on the train, but\nit took three full days and there was no food, and no water in that enclosed truck --\nwagon. There was one -- it was called comfort bucket in the corner, without any privacy,\nand [indecipherable] but you had to go, you had to go. And with 70 people in three days,\nthat bucket was full very quickly, and the same kind of -- of atmosphere there were not --\nas with the old people when they went to the bathroom and couldn\u2019t hold it, 1t was\nhorrendous.",
        "Q: So this is the first time, for you, to be in this situation, that so deteriorated, physically and",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- otherwise, yes?",
        "A: And while we were the -- very soon -- I don\u2019t remember how soon after the door was\nlocked and sealed, two boys from that home for the boys have attached themselves to me.\nI don\u2019t know why, I wasn\u2019t a father figure, but I was a tall guy, and somehow they felt\nconfident. And we stayed together the -- the three days in the wagon. And when the door\nopened, there was -- wild guys came in, 1n those prison uniforms, and started to yell in\nGerman, out, out, out, hurry. I looked back, and I could read backwards, from the back\nthat sign, \u201cArbeit macht frei,\u201d and Auschwitz. But it still didn\u2019t mean anything to me, I\n[indecipherable] we coming to labor camp to do --",
        "Q: You saw a sign that said Auschwitz?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: On -- on that building, the railroad sta -- the railroad -- the -- the railroad station. And one\nof those wild guys saw the two boys who were with me, and he asked them how old are\nyou? And they say 15. He said, \u201cYou are 18.\u201d Without explaining why he said it, and\nwhere they should use it, and was also a man -- well, there were several men supporting\nthemselves on a cane, and the same guy told them, don\u2019t come out with a cane, leave the\ncane here. Also, not saying why, so I\u2019m sure the guy didn\u2019t listen, if he needed a cane to\nsupport themself. And we were put on five abreast lined up, the whole contingent. And\nwe were moving forward, and you can -- forward I saw two SS uniformed men with\nwhite gloves. And when my -- when I was in the first row, they went to the -- through the\nfive, and he just looked at me and waved me to one side. And the boys were next to me,\nhe asked them, \u201cHow old are you?\u201d Now it lit up in their head, and they said 18, and it\nwas their luck because he send them to the good side. So then we were -- when there\nwere enough people together, we were marched along a -- those barbed wire fences. And\nthere was a guard, a SS with a rifle over his shoulder walking at [indecipherable], and I\nnaively asked him, \u201cWhat are those chimneys?\u201d They\u2019re not only smoke coming out, also\nsparks, and flames. I didn\u2019t smell anything, and he said, \u201c\u2018Oh, that\u2019s the bakery, they must\nhave burned the whole load of bread.\u201d",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t smell anything?",
        "A: No. It could be the wind wasn\u2019t coming in my direction.",
        "Q: But you were in Birkenau?",
        "A: Birkenau.",
        "Q: Mm-hm",
        "A: And until we met some veterans, didn\u2019t find out what this -- these chimneys are. We were\nbrought to a huge hall, with nothing in except benches around, and pegs on the wall. And\nthe pegs were numbered, and we were told to take everything off and hang it on a peg,\nand remember the number, so you can get back to your clothes. Till the last moment were\ndeceptions. And everything you have in your pocket, throw -- there\u2019s a blanket on the\nground, throw out everything.",
        "Q: And who\u2019s telling you this? Are these --",
        "A: SS.",
        "Q: SS.",
        "A: These were SS people. Throw everything down. And don\u2019t let us find anything on you,\nyou'll get severely punished. Then we were shaved, every hair on our body, and with me\nthey had a lot of work because top of my head to the big toe, I\u2019m hairy. And --",
        "Q: And they shaved all over your body?",
        "A: All of the body, and then they did it with -- they never changed the blade, that was dull,\nthey were pulling the hair, and ripping the skin, and after that, we were washed down\nwith some disinfectant that burned in those scratches. And then we were brought into\nshower. Hot water, nice showering, after three days in fil -- filth. There was no food the\nthree days, and we still were not eating before the shower. And from there, not coming\nback to the peg, but another door, they chased us out, naked and wet from a hot shower in\nthe cold, wintry night, to another barrack, and then we\u2019re marching along a counter,\nbehind which some prisoners were sitting and throwing at us a pair of pants, a jacket, and\na pair of boots. And the hat to take off -- not a hat, a cap to take off when you meet an SS\nman, it was for no other reason there. And those -- that clothing was without regard to our\nsize. So it was up to us then to exchange it so it fits. And we were brought to a barrack,\nand I\u2019ve no idea where I was in Birkenau, I couldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t identify where we were.\nBut the kids were with me, the two, and we were not working while we were in\nAuschwitz, in Birkenau. During the day we were just in front of the barracks, hanging\naround, loitering they call it. And [indecipherable] we went for the soup and the bread.\nBut every other day, or sometimes every day, and sometimes over three days break,\npeople came to look for workers in their factories. Civilians accompanied by an officer.\nAnd we wanted to get away from those chimneys, so whatever, whoever they were\nlooking for, we applied or [indecipherable] and we got away to a welding job, they were\nlooking for welders. There were 350 of us, and at that point, when we were accepted to\nbecome welders, they started to tattoo us, the numbers.",
        "Q: So your -- how long are you in Auschwitz before --",
        "A: I have no idea, but I know it --",
        "Q: Week? Two weeks?",
        "A: -- | know it wasn\u2019t long.",
        "Q: Wasn\u2019t long. Could have been a few days?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But you were eating?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yes, they were feeding you? So once you s --",
        "A: Yeah, Auschwitz diet.",
        "Q: Right. Worse than the Terezin diet, right?",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: So once you decide that you\u2019re going to say that you\u2019re welders --",
        "A: I said anything I was --",
        "Q: Anything, right.",
        "A: -- but before they came to me, they had their contingent --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So --",
        "Q: So then they tattoo you?",
        "A: Yeah. And now if you were psychology PhD, I would ask you a question, but I have to\nlive without the answer to that. There were three guys doing the tattooing, and I was at\nthe edge of my life, or edge of death, or whatever you call it in Auschwitz, and I went to\nsee which one does it the nicest way. And in that line I lined up. I\u2019ve seen guys with, you\nknow, irregular numbers, b-big ones, small ones, sideways and so. I wanted to have it\nneat.",
        "Q: Can you show us your number?",
        "A: I can show you this, and it\u2019s very regular and neat. It has to be read this way, I don\u2019t\nknow why they didn\u2019t do it here.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: 11636.",
        "Q: It\u2019s E11636.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And from that moment on -- I don\u2019t know when in Auschwitz they called us by a name,\nbut they must have, because people who were with me, I know in alphabetical order, they\nhave either higher or lower number. So --",
        "Q: So you must have been lined up alphabetically.",
        "A: Alphabetically either by name, or they had documents, I -- I\u2019m sure they had documents,\nbecause they came from Terezin, the documents came along.",
        "Q: The documents came to Auschwitz from Terezin, so --",
        "A: Yeah, the names of -- of the deportees.",
        "Q: And were cards made out for you in Auschwitz, do you have any idea?",
        "A: No, nothing was -- I -- I have no -- nobody asked, interviewed, nothing. Th-They may\nhave called my name, I don\u2019t remember that part. Just judging by the fact that I -- those\nwhom I meet, whether their name starts with a lower or higher letter in the alphabet, they\nhave a lower, or higher number of the --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- the tattoo.",
        "Q: I think we have to stop the tape and change tt.\nEnd of Tape #9\nTape #10",
        "Q: So you\u2019re in Auschwitz for a few days. Do you hear the orchestra when people --",
        "A: No, not in Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Not in Auschwitz?",
        "A: No. Although I read later on that they supposedly played upon arrival for the -- for the\narriving prisoners to -- still to give them a -- an impression that they\u2019re coming\nsomewhere to a spa where the orchestra plays for them. But I -- I have not heard or seen\nthe orchestra in Auschwitz.",
        "Q: I see. So when people were going to work, you didn\u2019t hear anything?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And were people near you in the barracks going to work?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Going in and out -- no they weren\u2019t?",
        "A: No that was -- that was just those who waited to be taken away --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- for jobs.",
        "Q: And where were you sent? Aft -- after your tattoo, you weren\u2019t -- you had the same\nclothes, the same shoes, but they just tattooed you?",
        "A: Yeah. And we went to -- by tractor, or we walked, I don\u2019t remember cause I forgot. We\nwent to the train, by whatever method. It was the same cattle wagon, and we were going\nto Gleiwitz, which is nearby, and it also took longer than it should have taken because the\nmilitary transports had priority on the track. That\u2019s why it took three days to go to\nAuschwitz, a trip that shouldn\u2019t have taken longer than five, six hours.",
        "Q: But you -- you were in Auschwitz before the uprising, right?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: The uprising the end of October, so you have left by this time.",
        "A: Yeah, I think so.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So they take you --",
        "A: You mean the crematorium -- yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, the blow up, yes. So you\u2019re by train to Gletwitz. And what happens when\nyou come to Gleiwitz?",
        "A: From Gleiwitz we marched through the streets, into the camp, there\u2019s a huge camp. And\nthe whole camp was -- all inmates in that camp were working in a -- a railroad repair\nshop that was fixing wagons that were damaged by the Royal Air Force on the way to the\nfront. So with my experience, I did get a -- a cutting torch, at the gate, cutting off all the\ndamaged parts of the wagon, and then the wagon went further on to be -- to -- to parts to\nbe measured, and re-install the good parts. And the job had a good side and a bad one.\nEverything 1n life, I guess, has a good and a bad side. The good one was when a wagon\nwith garbage came in, I had the first pick. The bad part was that was in the open gate, and\nwe had nothing, we had no underwear, no socks, just those cotton pants and the -- and the\njacket. And -- very cold. My meister was a -- a Pole -- a German Pole, or a Polish\nGerman. A Pole of German nationality. He wasn\u2019t especially good, but he was one of\nthose who was afraid to be good. He wasn\u2019t -- he wasn\u2019t very bad, but y -- we worked 12\nhour shifts, six days a week, one week day, one week night. And when we went to work\nthere was music in Gleiwitz, and when we came back was music.",
        "Q: Musicians sitting outside, or walking --",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: Where were the musi -- or was the --",
        "A: Next to the gate, standing --",
        "Q: They were standing near the [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- the musicians were standing next to the gate as we came 1n, and if we didn\u2019t march in\nproper step, we were helped by a kick to improve the step. Big guys like me deteriorated\nin Auschwitz much faster than the little skinny ones. I guess our body required more than\nthey were offering, and a lot of pussyboils presented themselves on my back. And the pus\nrubbed off on the jacket, and when it dried, it rubbed back into the wounds. I also had\nsome that were not opened, were -- the skin didn\u2019t break and the pus was pushing, and it\nwas terrible pressure, and they were very painful. And I didn\u2019t want to go to the infirmary\nbecause the Germans didn\u2019t like sick Jews, they liked them less than the healthy Jews. So\n-- but it became unbearable, so I went. And there was a French doctor, I don\u2019t know\nwhether he was a doctor, or just filled the position of a doctor -- a -- a prisoner, and he --\nfor anesthesia he put me down on a table face down, and for anesthesia he used three\nguys, two sitting each on one of my arms, and one sitting on my legs, and he proceeded\nto open those closed -- it was a split second unpleasant, but there was immediate relief,\nthe pressure was gone. So you bite your teeth together, and -- and I went immediately\nback. There was no -- no bandage, no stitches, no nothing, just cut open, relief, and I\nwent back to the barracks, and next shift I went to work.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re welding?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: You\u2019re welding?",
        "A: Welding, no, cutting with a torch. I\u2019m not -- welding is putting things together, I was --",
        "Q: Together, you were cutting things -- and the two boys were also with you?",
        "A: Each one, yeah. In -- one in the carpentry shop, he -- because one worked in -- in Terezin\nin the carpentry shop, cause 15 and older had to work, and one of them was carrying the\nplumber\u2019s toolbox. So -- and they found similar jobs. Whether they said what they did\nbefore, what their experience was -- I couldn\u2019t say what my experience was. And that\nsecond cook was in that same transport, and he came also to Auschwitz into Gleiwitz\nfrom the same camp.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. And so one day on the way home -- there was nothing -- I went -- we went full to\ne-elaborate on that job, other than only once in those 12 hours you were allowed to go to\nthe bathroom. They took your number down, and if you came again, they kicked you out.\nThe guy who was there was called scheiss meister. [indecipherable] to spell it.",
        "Q: She may know how to spell that.",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t know what people did who had diarrhea, but there must have been people with\ndiarrhea. I have no idea. Th -- one day was really, really sick, tired and -- and I -- I really\ncouldn\u2019t perform. So I found a place, and with these radiators with the ribs, you know?\nThere was one that allowed a little space between the wall and itself. I leaned down\nbehind it, and there was nice, warm, and I fell asleep. It wasn\u2019t difficult for me to fall\nasleep until ve been awakened with a -- a rifle butt by an SS man. I think the -- the --\nmy meister must have told the guard that his helper is missing. So he found me. I\u2019m glad\nI\u2019m not bald because I have a very ugly protrusion still, on my head. And so he kicked\nme in the behind and sent me back to work. I was lucky he didn\u2019t deport me. So I did my\nwork again, you know, you get this kind of encouragement with a boot, you continue to\nwork. One day after the shift, we go back to camp, there was a snow on the floor -- on the\nground. And I had wooden shoes, those Dutch wooden clogs, that was the only shoes that\nfitted me, that I got exchange. They were good -- a good and the bad side. The good was\nit insulated from the cold of the ground, but uncomfortable because they were not\nflexible. Walking back to the camp, I see ahead of me a huge -- only maybe it just\nseemed that -- that huge to me, onion on the edge -- on the side of the road. So I look\nback where the guard 1s, and told the guy behind me, step a little bit out of formation,\ncover me. And I bent down, and picked it up and put it in the jacket to take it to camp,\nbecause whatever either one of the three of us found, stole, or otherwise, we shared. So I\ntook it in to share it with them. And we were brought in and lined up on the roll call area\nfor frisking. We were frisked on -- infreque -- not infrequently like little, but\nunannounced because we were working with tools, and we could have made some\nweapon, a knife, or -- or something which the Germans did not like very much. So what\ndo I do with the onion? If I throw it away and don\u2019t say it was me, everybody gets\npunished, the old theme of collective punishment. If I say it was me, they beat me to a\npulp because they won\u2019t believe I found it, they will think I stole -- they will insist I stole\nit. Only one way out, to eat the onion, quickly. This is with the peel and with those little\nroots on it. The eyes were -- tears were coming down my cheeks, and the nose was\nrunning, and sweat in that cold, wintry day, sweat was coming up on my forehead. And\nwhen he ca -- I finished it before he came to me, and I didn\u2019t dare to breathe while he was\nfrisking me. And why I am saying it 1s a day or -- or t -- the next day or the day after,\nthese wounds started to get smaller and less pus-y.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: The one onion did a marvelous job. But it was only one, and we continued days and\nweeks without another onion, so it opened up again, and the -- the pus-y routine has\nreappeared. But it gave me enough respect for onions that I am consuming an awful lot of\nthem, cooked or raw. And recommending it to everybody. I don\u2019t remember much of\nhappenings inside the camp. This other cook, second cook from Prague, he had the\nchutzpah on a -- in -- on the -- on the road in the camp, to stop the camp commander, who\nwas as.o.b. you can say, no? That\u2019s in public. He was the -- previously the commander of\nthe crematorium and the gas chambers in Auschwitz. And here was the lager\nkommandant, always walking with a dog.",
        "Q: And his name, do you know?",
        "A: Yeah, Moll. And he stopped him, he said, \u201cHerr Kommandant, I would like to work in\nmy profession.\u201d And he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s your profession?\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m a cook.\u201d He said,\n\u201cDid you tell 1t when you came into this camp?\u201d He said, \u201cYes.\u201d So next Sunday on the\nroll call, they pull him out and put him into the SS kitchen. I wouldn\u2019t have dared to say\nI\u2019m a cook when I said I\u2019m a welder. I thought, you know -- anyway, he -- I never --\nalready the oldtimers in the kitchen, the veterans, they wouldn\u2019t let him anywhere near,\nand he has to wash dishes, the floor, the tables, just the dirty work. And one afternoon\nthere was some mashed potatoes left from the SS menu, and he made like a decorating\nbag out of paper, and made some decorations like for a cake. And the SS in charge of the\nSS kitchen was a baker, or a -- a -- call 1t baker patisserie, or the fine -- fine baker, you\nknow, the -- how do you call it?",
        "Q: Pastry chef?",
        "A: Pastry chef. What would I do without you? Couldn\u2019t complete the interview. He saw this,\n\u201cWho made this?\u201d And he said, \u201cI did.\u201d \u201cYou did?\u201d He immediately made him the\nproviant meister, which was in the storeroom, giving out to the cooks the -- the food, the -\n- the -- the items to cook. So he had everything, he was in there alone, no other veteran --\nprior veteran. He took care of everyone from Terezin he knew. He saved my life.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: At 4:30 in the morning, behind the barracks, we crawled to that SS kitchen -- and several\npeople, and he threw at us a -- a boiled potato unpeeled, or a piece of bread, or whatever\nwas left over. And when I was at night shift and couldn\u2019t come to the kitchen, he left me\nsome food on the beam in the latrine. Not a very aesthetic place, but who cares? And all\nthese things, whatever he sa -- left there we -- the three of us shared. And I don\u2019t think I\nwould have made it without him. And so now again, nothing extraordinary. I was lucky, I\nwas never present at -- when there was some hangings, or when somebody got 25 or 40\nlashes. I never -- when I -- when we stood in the roll call place, I bent my knees not to\nstick out, because I was tall. Cause they -- the tall ones and those who were in some way\ndifferent than the rest, they pulled out for the nice jobs like cleaning latrines, and so -- so\nyou learn how to survive.",
        "Q: And are you now hearing rumors about the war, that the Russians are getting closer?\nBecause it\u2019s now what, November or December?",
        "A: It was January already.",
        "Q: It was January already by this time, okay.",
        "A: And we did hear faint explosions like bombs and so. And one day at n -- noon -- before\nnoon -- before noon at the factory, over the loudspeaker came an announcement, all\nprisoners assemble where we usually assemble after the shift to go back. And there was\nnot much talking. They counted us and marched us back to the camp. No music was\nplaying. Lined up on the roll call area. After awhile we were sent to the block -- to have -\n- to enjoy our own luxury, each one had a blanket. We brought our blanket and it was a\ngodsend because we could wrap it around and be a little less cold. And soon thereafter we\nwere marched out. That was already afternoon, again without music, and that was the\nbeginning of what they call a death march today. With the kids on my side, we are\ntogether. And there were no more kids, they were already adults, you know, this kind of a\ncircumstance matures a person quickly. And --",
        "Q: Are you still wearing --",
        "A: The shoes.",
        "Q: The -- the wooden shoes?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And so we marched until late at night, and we came to an already abandoned camp,\nevacuated -- another evacuated labor camp. So we were herded in, and right went into the\nbunk and fell asleep. There was no food, no drink. We were able to pick up some of the\ndirty snow from the road. And early morning I was -- it was not -- before dawn, they\nwoke us up, and the Germans insisted that we go as quickly as possible. Now, we noticed\nwhoever fell, couldn\u2019t make it, was shot on the road. On the first day with one of the kids,\nwe were supporting one who couldn\u2019t road -- couldn\u2019t walk any more, you know, the\nshoulder, and under the arm. And we could do it as -- as long as he could move his feet --\nhis legs forward. But then he became totally heavy, we had a dead weight, and we\nourselves were already weak. So we just couldn\u2019t continue to drag him, and then when\nwe heard the shot it was like -- it felt like I was shot, you know, the -- the guy -- I felt\nguilty that time, I felt guilty that I didn\u2019t try more. But it wouldn\u2019t have helped, I could\nhave only weakened myself, and wouldn\u2019t have helped him.",
        "Q: So you both let him go, right?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And then you heard a shot?",
        "A: Yeah. And then the next day after this camp, we were marched again, there was no food,\nno drink. Continued with the dirty snow, and at late at night again, we came to a barn. We\nwere herded in, the -- they -- they closed the barn. And that was nice because there was\nsomething, we didn\u2019t recognize it in the dark, hay or straw. We crawled in and had a\nwarm, soft sleep. On that day my -- on top of the shoe where the laces are -- there are no\nlaces on the wooden, but on where on other shoes are the laces, a little triangular piece\nbroke out, and two sharp corners were digging into my foot. And that was very\nunpleasant. I don\u2019t know where and how I found a piece of wax cloth, I think in that barn\nor around it, and I wrapped my feet into that, and that\u2019s like McDonald uses this\ncheckered tablecloth?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That kind of material. It did not insulate me any more from the cold, but it didn\u2019t hurt like\nthe -- that shoe. But early in the morning on the third day I felt -- I -- I will be one of\nthose shot on the road. I am weak, tired, tough trying to drag my feet. And the kids were\nin -- in fairly good shape, because I mentioned the smaller ones and skinny one tolerated\nit better. So I said, if I stay here, I get shot. I try to escape. Whatever chance I have, I will\ntake it. If it\u2019s 10 percent, I'll take 10 percent of success to escape. And so I told them,\nstay together and help each other if you need to, and I can\u2019t any more, and I have no use\nto you anyway. So we come to a forest, tall forest on both sides of the road, no moon, real\ndark. So that was the moment. I slipped to -- into the ditch on the side of the road. I don\u2019t\nknow why I didn\u2019t encourage the kids to do it too, but I felt I don\u2019t want to be responsible\nin case -- you know, to suggest something where they may suffer. And I laid down in the\nsnow, face down. And there was -- must have been a zealous guard who shot me. And\nwhether it was the dark, or whether it was frozen fingers, I don\u2019t know. He shot me under\nthe arm, and the bullet got stuck in the rib. And the snow -- the -- the blood was color --\nstarting to color the snow, and that was good, because nobody else attempted a second\nshot, that the guy must have had it, you know, but -- so when the column past, I suddenly\nhad strength to pick myself up, and went into the forest, and found like minded people,\nother prisoners who escaped, having been lucky, not getting shot. So we huddled together\nand used the blanket in ma -- outside in -- in January in the forest with this -- just a cotton\nuniform, and I think we all slept, sitting, holding each other. And in the morning we went\nto the edge of the forest, that the road we came from, looking whether we find a sign\nwhere we are, what\u2019s happening. And we see the top of the hill another camp. The gate is\nOpen, no guard in the watch tower, and prisoners walking in and out. So inside the forest\nwe ran -- suddenly we could not only walk, we could run, near to that camp, and we\nasked one of the prisoners, \u201cWell what -- well what is this?\u201d He said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, but\nbefore dawn, all the Germans jumped into car -- into the trucks and took off.\u2019 Didn\u2019t\neven take the time to liquidate the camp, with machine guns, and -- and hand grenades.\nSo what really happened, in that area, a Russian tank force cut a wedge into the German\nfront. And of course they didn\u2019t want to be caught by the Russians, so they jumped in the\ntrucks and left in a hurry. We -- I went into the camp, and saw guys from our camp. I\nsaid, \u201cWhere were you located?\u201d Sort of the last block, because that was the last group\nthat arrived there. And I found the two kids there, and we started to look for food, but we\ndidn\u2019t find any, because those who were there already, they plundered the -- the -- the\npotato storage, and all -- all other storages. But somebody told us there\u2019s, on the side the\nroad, 1s a abandoned village where the German population ran the same way as the SS,\nand there\u2019s food in their pantries. So we went there, not far, and there\u2019s food. Everything\nexcept bread. They must have taken the loaf and bread and ran. The speed at which they\nran wa -- showed itself. That was unfinished food, even unfinished food on the table, and\nthe rest was burned in the oven, or on top of the range. So we had food, and there was no\n-- at that time there was no refrigeration in Europe [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know, a few\npeople may have had a refrigerator, and -- we want to break --",
        "Q: J -- I --",
        "A: -- at the refrigerator, okay.",
        "Q: At the refrigerator, yes.\nEnd of Tape #10\nTape #11",
        "Q: Edgar, you didn\u2019t describe your wound and what happened, because it seems impossible\nthat you were running after a night of bleeding. So what happened when you met these\npeople?",
        "A: I -- after I picked myself up from the ground, I was pr-pressing my arm against the\nwound, and lo and behold, among those in the forest was the French doctor.",
        "Q: Which French doctor?",
        "A: The French doctor from -- that operated on my back.",
        "Q: You\u2019re kidding.",
        "A: No. And anybody who has some function in a concentration camp has different degrees\nof privileges according to the degree of the function. And it must have been his privilege\nto have a pocket knife, which we were not allowed to have. And people see that around\nthis time without other guys, just with snow as a somewhat numbing agent, and he had to\nmake another hole because the bullet was away from where it entered. And he pulled it\nout, wriggling and wiggling. And I continued to do the same thing, holding my arm\nagainst the body until the blood dried, and -- and later on I started to take advantage of\nmy profession, and -- by feeding myself, I gained enough healing power that it healed\nwithout bandages, without stitches.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: There was no -- there wa -- there was no doctor --",
        "Q: Did you eat more onions?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Did you eat more onions?",
        "A: Okay, now we stopped before the bullet -- or that was after the bullet --",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: We stopped in that village, and I mentioned there were no refrigerators used. If this is a\nkosher tape I can\u2019t mention it. People were -- had all kinds of preservation methods of\nfood without refrigerator. So the first thing I found was a -- like a gallon jug glass jar,\nwith roasted pork, covered with rendered lard, which prevents the -- the oxygen reaching\nthe meat, and the meat therefore, does not spoil. And after months of Auschwitz diet, and\nthree days absolutely nothing, I dug into that lard, and ate it like that. No bread, no\nnothing. And I still don\u2019t understand that this didn\u2019t kill me faster than -- than the\nAuschwitz diet. But it had a effec -- had it\u2019s effects. This was a huge place, the -- that\ncamp was called Blechhammer, and it was part of a huge industrial complex. All the\ncamp inmates were working in it -- of forced laborers from occupied countries were\nthere, and POW\u2019s were also there, and were working. We found the camp of the British\nprisoners of war, and for some reason -- they were bombing London, but for some reason\nthey were treating the British POW\u2019s very well. We found in that barrack warm uniforms,\nboots, socks, scarves, caps, coats, and a lot of toilet paper, which saved us from result of\nthe way we were eating. There were 10 of us in -- in one of those barracks, there were\ntwo toilets, one on each end, and that wasn\u2019t enough. So they brought from the village, I\ndon\u2019t know, somewhere, a huge half barrel, like a big whiskey barrel. I put two boards\nacross so four could sit at the same time. That bad it was. I started to improvise cooking,\nand one guy was helping me, and eight did -- the rest of the 10, the eight went to town to\nbring supplies. The one kid I mentioned was working the carpentry shop in Terezin, he\nmade a sled so more stuff could be brought. And there\u2019s one point he brought the whole -\n- took out from one of those houses a kitchen stove, including the pipes. He installed it,\nand then we were really cooking. The Russian soldiers came to eat, to us, because they\ndidn\u2019t get food like that. It was another compliment for the aunt. And we\u2019re cooking till\n10 in the evening, and by 10:15, there wasn\u2019t a bite to be had. That\u2019s how we ate. No --\nno control. And the Russian soldiers told us how wonderful Communism 1s, everybody is\neven, and it\u2019s the best system, until a Jewish officer came, a Russian Jewish officer, said,\n\u201cDon\u2019t believe a word.\u201d We were thinking of Communism, because that\u2019s a -- was\npresented to us as a real equal society, a society of equal people. But he set us straight.\nWe were six weeks in that British barracks, because between where we were, and our\nhome, they were still fighting. You know, from the east front, we were here, and Prague\nwas here, and the Russians were only getting there. So for six weeks we suffered terrible\ndiarrhea. And in spite of it, I gained 79 pounds within six weeks, with my own cooking. I\nsaid -- what\u2019s her name, I fi -- know this -- this diet advertiser, Jenny Craig would have\ngone crazy if she heard that somebody gained 79 pounds in six weeks. And everybody --\nafter six weeks we moved out of there, and went to Katowice -- here come friend of the\nspelling. And they put us up in the schoolhouse where or -- other -- other form of\nprisoners were. And the Polish Red Cross gave us identification papers based on what we\ntold them, because we didn\u2019t have anything to show. But we needed something because\nwe were in the Russian occupied zone, and I don\u2019t know how long we were there. One of\nthe tenant was a chemist, and he found a job in a smoke factory there, to earn some\nmoney. And next day he comes and says, \u201cCome with me, they need a cook in the\nemployees cafeteria, in the manager\u2019s restaurant.\u201d I have absolutely no recollection that I\nworked there, until I read one of the two kids memoirs, where he names the factory. So\nthe name immediately sprang up, and I knew I know it. But even with that knowledge, I\ncould not remember that I worked there. But I must have, because they all told me, and I\nbrought food to the school for them. So -- and I don\u2019 know how long we were there.\nSomehow time is not very noticeable, if you don\u2019t have a calendar, you don\u2019t have a\nroutine, and that responsibility. Okay, and then we picked ourselves up and went home\nby means of freight trains, military trucks, horse-drawn carriages, walking. We were\nalready strengthened -- strong by that time. The day we moved out from that British\nbarrack, the diarrhea stopped like immediately. And our digestive systems started to work\nnormally, cause we didn\u2019t eat like pigs any more. Oh, there was a -- and one story, and\nit\u2019s a funny story, one of the guys came and said down a little past the village 1s a pig\nfarm, and a lot of pigs there, and nobody\u2019s watching them, feeding them. So I found some\n-- a little hammer and a piece of rope, and we said we go down and get ourselves a pig\nwith the sled. And I go there, and there were lots of pigs running around, and they were\nin the building. So I found one, tied a rope to his hind leg, and tied the rope to the -- to\nthat column, the supporting column, and hit him on the head, that\u2019s how you kill pigs.\nBut the hammer was small, and I was not strong enough yet, and when you hit them here,\nit swells up and you can never break his skull any more. So it was screaming there, and\nsuddenly we hear machine gun fire. I -- oh my God, the Germans are back. So we look\nout, and on top of that farm, a Russian column, military column pass by, and one was\nshooting the pigs with a machine gun, and they were throwing them at cars and trucks as\nthey ro -- drove by. And the guy sees me with a knife, and commandeered me to about 12\nor 13 pigs to eviscerate them. They want -- he want only the meat, not the innard. So I did\nthat, and I said, \u201cNow I worked for you, now you come and shoot my pig.\u201d And one of\nthose wanted only the two hind legs, it was a [indecipherable] soldier. So we had one and\na half pig, and a innards from a liver, and the organs from 12 more pigs. I don\u2019t even\nknow how we brought it all on that sled. We were rendering the lard till 10 at night. And\nthere was no worry about refrigeration, it was cold enough. So that -- we consumed all\nthat -- I\u2019m sorry -- okay, we started on our way home from Katowice, and we had to go --\nI told you all the means we went, but I have to turn around to tell you -- to give you the\ndirection. We were here, in Katowice. We went to the Ukraine, to Romania, to Hungary,\nAustria and Prague.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a long trip.",
        "A: Yeah. And in Ukraine was an office of the Joint, and they were giving to Jewish prisoners\nsome onion. But you had to prove that you a Jew, so if you knew a [indecipherable] or\nsomething, a prayer, was fine. If -- some of those who never learned anything, they had to\ntake their pants off to prove they are Jewish. And --",
        "Q: How did women prove they were Jewish?",
        "A: That was my question. That was my question and still 1s. So came to lac -- I think two\ndays after, one day or two days after the war officially ended, and right away I went to\nTerezin to see if my parents are there, and they were there.",
        "Q: Were you shocked?",
        "A: No, 1 -- when something nice happens, you don\u2019t get shocked. I asked Mother, \u201c\u201cWeren\u2019t\nyou worried?\u201d \u201cNo, I knew God wouldn\u2019t do this to me. He will send you back.\u201d Such a\nstrong belief. She didn\u2019t -- it\u2019s [indecipherable] it\u2019s good, I mean a good disposition.",
        "Q: But your father was worried?",
        "A: Father was worried and he was -- he was very excited to see me back.",
        "Q: To see you, yeah.",
        "A: There was meanwhile a quarantine in Terezin because some of the death marchers wor --\nwere brought near there, from Poland to Mauthausen, either through the Czech territory,\nor right outside, where Terezin was the nearest place, so they brought all these sick\npeople in, including the dead. There was a crematorium in Terezin. They started first,\nwhen few people died, individual graves. My grandmother 1s in an individual grave. Then\nmass graves, without -- without coffins because the Germans wouldn\u2019t supply wood for\nthat. And when that wasn\u2019t enough space for mass -- more mass graves, they built a\ncrematorium, and the bodies were cremated. So I [indecipherable] was a quarantine, and\npeople brought in typhoid, and scarlet fever, and all kind. And I must say, my wife, I\ndon\u2019t know how she did it, they were friends from before, that\u2019s when they started to\nbelieve what happened. Her friends she has from before, one in one place with typhoid,\none with the scarlet fever. This one couldn\u2019t eat, so she took his food to the other one,\nand she never got anything, and was lucky. I went home, and started to look for an\napartment, and there was a -- you know, you couldn\u2019t like here go to someone, to a\nlandlord and rent an apartment. That was all operated by a -- a housing cop -- not a\ncooperation, a state housing office. And they didn\u2019t come Tuesday, come Wednesday,\ncome the afternoon, come day after. I said, \u201cWhat the hell happened? The Jews didn\u2019t\ncome back. The Germans you have expelled, what happened to the apartments?\u201d I was\ntoo di -- naive and dumb to know that he wanted some -- something for the apartment. So\nit took almost two weeks before I lost my patience, and I took a chair and banged it on his\ndesk, the desk collapsed, and I said, \u201cAnd you are next.\u201d The -- \u201cWait, wait, wait, maybe\nwe can find something.\u201d In the afternoon I had a apartment and I was mad at myself that I\nwaited with this -- with this extended patience, that I waited that long, I could have had\nan apartment two weeks before. So then my parents came and -- thought you said you\nwanted this after -- at another time, or just so long -- as long as the tape runs?",
        "Q: Well, let\u2019s see, how -- how much more time do we have on the tape? Oh, well let\u2019s\ncontinue a little bit.",
        "A: Yeah. So --",
        "Q: Do you bring -- do you bring your parents from Terezin?",
        "A: I brought the parents from Terezin and now we -- I don\u2019t know where we got some\nfurniture. Maybe the house -- th-the apartment was furnished, I don\u2019t remember the\ndetails. But I took two jobs because I needed to earn enough money for the three of us,\nand provide the things that we did not have after coming back from Terezin. So one job\nwas where I took my apprenticeship, a day job, and then I worked in the evening in a\nrestaurant where they also had the bar. And that -- there I worked at -- at night, and a lot\nof people who returned came to that evening restaurant and to the bar. And in October\n\"46 -- until October \u201946, when I was in inducted into the Czech army as a reserve, in the\nreserves, cause I was older than inducting age, for five months. And somehow, a United\nNations request to the other states was to reduce the military, the numbers in -- of the\npeople in the military. And the easiest -- the Czechs and for others, I guess, was to get rid\nof, was the shortest ones in, because they had not invested a lot of effort into them, and\nthe others were already more valuable by having been trained. So I was let go on the New\nYear\u2019s Eve, 1946. And then I worked in a hotel in Prague. I have a certificate informing\nme and everybody else who wants to look at, that I worked there to their full satisfaction.\nI don\u2019t remember the kitchen, the time that I did work there, the people with whom I\nworked. And it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s an hotel on -- on the Wencel Square. And -- and that\u2019s it, I have\na -- I have a -- a [indecipherable] or certificate that I -- document that I worked there.\nAnyway, in the spring of \u201947, I si --",
        "Q: Don\u2019t you meet somebody New Year\u2019s Eve, on 1946?",
        "A: Oh my God, this woman. Yes, I did, some -- meet somebody. I thought she will tell the\nStory.",
        "Q: But you met Hana, your wife, yes?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: At least the person who became your wife, you didn\u2019t know that [indecipherable |",
        "A: Yeah, one of the friends whom I also met in Terezin after I came back, with a New\nYear\u2019s Eve party in her sister\u2019s apartment, and invited me. I don\u2019t know, I came only\nback from the military, how I found out there is a party, how she got to me, I don\u2019t\nremember that. But I know that I went, and Hana came with somebody, who was another\nfr -- childhood friend, who was much younger than she. A he friend, but not a boyfriend.\nAnd also somebody who came back alone. So they went together, and I don\u2019t -- didn\u2019t\nknow how tough it will be to live with her, but somehow I started a relationship with her.\nAnd I -- I don\u2019t like dancing, but I thought it\u2019s what girl\u2019s like, so I invited her to dance.\nAnd she called the other girl, in whose house we had the party. \u201cEdgar wants us to come -\n- wants you to come to dance.\u201d And she said, \u201cWell why didn\u2019t he call me directly?\u201d She\nsaid, \u201cI don\u2019t know what.\u201d So I was dancing with both of them, and I hate to dance,\nalways did.

But before we -- I\nwent to Switzerland, there\u2019s another thing I don\u2019t like, I don\u2019t like movies, because I can\nsleep cheaper at home. And she insisted she wanted to go to a movie. I said, \u201cI am not\ngoing,\u201d Yes, and she want -- I said, \u201cIf you want to go, you stand in line for the tickets.\u201d\nAnd she did, and she came with the ticket, and I said, \u201cYou know, maybe we should not\ngo, and should go to your apartment, have some other kind of fun.\u201d And that was the end,\nshe walked away, and I didn\u2019t see her until I came back from Switzerland.",

        "Q: Yeah, yeah -- you -- you mean that, this is not just a --",
        "Q: Yeah. So this was a learning experience in some way?",
        "Q: That\u2019s my job",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "Q: Right. Did -- do you think that people in Terezin after \u201940 -- after \u00b042, when -- there must\nbe rumors of what\u2019s going on, at least, that people have a sense that if they\u2019re sent,\nthey\u2019re not going to return? Y -- I mean, and are people afraid, or they s --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: So 1-- in -- at the end of \u201941 - \u201942 - \u201943, you have no suspicion.",

        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: And what kind of a guy was he, was he --",
        "Q: What kind of a person was he?",
        "Q: And is it the case that he knew artists and musicians and that he introduced you to these\npeople, or is that not a connection?",
        "Q: And these were taken out by the sh -- the Czech gendarmes, knowingly?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Leo Haas.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, takes the first name, the first nickname.",
        "Q: No, Fritta\u2019s the last name.",
        "Q: Yeah, Fritta.",
        "Q: And that was called the painter\u2019s affair, when they were arrested, 1s that not\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: Mm-hm. We\u2019re going to have to stop the tape.",
        "Q: You saw.",

        "Q: Otto Frajt. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Ota?",
        "Q: O-t-a.",
        "Q: Okay. So he, as an older person, cause he\u2019s an established lawyer, can introduce you to\nsome of the people who were artists and painters, who were working -- and they were\nworking in Magdeburg, am I correct? Is that where they\u2019re --",
        "Q: No.",
        "Q: I -- I see.",
        "Q: But 1s it -- is it through him that you met these --",
        "Q: And why did you decide to give them extra food?",
        "Q: Because of what they were doing?",
        "Q: And did you --",
        "Q: Did you bring the food to the painters and to the composers, yourself?",
        "Q: And -- and this was dangerous for you, if you were caught. Am I right, or not?",
        "Q: So they wouldn\u2019t necessarily have checked anything?",
        "Q: So would you -- you go to where they were working at night, and give them the food at\nnight, do you remember?",
        "Q: So you e --",
        "Q: It is. But you\u2019d go at night, would you cook the food special, or would you simply take\nwhat was already there?",
        "Q: And would you stay --",
        "Q: Right. Would you stay with them, or would you --",
        "Q: In the choir?",
        "Q: And was this almost from the beginning?",
        "Q: When he came in December?",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right.",
        "Q: So would he sing?",
        "Q: How -- how would you do it? P -- there was a piano?",
        "Q: And this was a grand piano?",
        "Q: Yeah. What\u2019s a harmonium? What does it look like?",
        "Q: Organ?",
        "Q: A small --",
        "Q: With your feet.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: We -- we -- let me go back a little bit. Ho -- how was it that you met Schacter? Did you\nmeet him when he came into the Sudeten barrack?",
        "Q: And why did you do that? You hadn\u2019t had much singing as a kid. What -- what --",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: Right, right. But you had been singing more popular music, and now with Schacter, after\nthe popular Czech songs, seeing \u201cThe Bartered Bride\u201d --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: The -- the lead singers, were these -- there are a lot of professional artists, singers in\nTerezin, were the lead singers more professional people, people who [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Soloists.",
        "Q: Soloists.",
        "Q: Right. So you --",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So you were in the -- in the choir?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: And what was he like in rehearsal?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: So he --",
        "Q: -- treated this very professionally?",
        "Q: And w-was he auditioning people for the choir?",
        "Q: So were there people with good voices in the choir, tha -- from what you remember\u2019?",
        "Q: And how many people ended up in the choir? I know that there were --",
        "Q: And these were concert versions of the operas?",
        "Q: [indecipherable]. And what did you use when you performed? Was that piano that had\nbeen given legs --",
        "Q: Just the piano.",
        "Q: Now, I\u2019m going to go off this topic for just a second, because you mentioned that the old\nGerman Jews often committed su -- many committed suicide. How did they commit\nsuicide? Did they jump out of windows?",
        "Q: Di -- wi -- I want to continue o-on your relationship and the work with Schacter, but I\nalso wanted to ask you, there were -- there were orchestras in Terezin, there are\ncomposers, there are other conductors, yes?",
        "Q: So that there is a lot going on. Am I correct?",
        "Q: And was this -- when Schacter came in December and started those little choirs in the\nmen\u2019s barrack, and then the women\u2019s barrack, was -- was that secret at that point, or\nthat\u2019s -- that was okay at that point? Do you remember?",
        "Q: So that the permission that was gotten because Epstein said something to the Germans\nwas to bring in the instruments?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: And all of this cultural activity, and intellectual activity started in 1942 as far as you\nremember?",
        "Q: End of 42.",
        "Q: Now did you -- besides -- if -- if you were rehearsing as much as --",
        "Q: Right. And that was performed publicly before it was part of this other plan?",
        "Q: Right. Did you also go to performances of other groups, as well as being in rehearsals, or\ndid you [indecipherable] too much?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Really? Did you -- did you go to lectures?",
        "Q: And did you go to chamber music, or the orchestra performances at all?",
        "Q: You did?",
        "Q: Do you remember anything about those performances? What you --",
        "Q: The violin?",
        "Q: And piano.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: And she was a violinist, or she was a pianist?",
        "Q: Pianist.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. This is going to be an odd question. Who tuned the pianos? It\u2019s one thing to\ntune a violin, you can tune it, but were the pianos tuned?",
        "Q: There were tuners there?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So they sounded -- they sounded good? These were good pianos?",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "Q: At least it comes up in some language.",
        "Q: We have to stop and change the tape.",
        "Q: Edgar, when you were at rehearsals with -- with Schacter, did he rehearse the soloists\nseparately, and then brought you together with the choir? Do you have any recollection?",
        "Q: So you would rehearse separately from the soloists?",
        "Q: Did he --",
        "Q: So you guys in the choir needed more rehearsal?",
        "Q: But you weren\u2019t singing as much as the -- n-not in these operas. In the Requiem you sang\nmore, as a choir than you did the operas. Am I correct, or not?",
        "Q: Chorus.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Did he ever kick anyone out because they were terrible? Not because they were looking\nsideways --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: Did people get angry at that?",
        "Q: I bet they did --",
        "Q: -- they got angry, yeah. But you -- you stayed for the performances?",
        "Q: Did you have to get dressed in a particular way?",
        "Q: You just came in whene -- the wa -- any way you were.",
        "Q: And you kept the 110 pounds of clothing, they weren\u2019t taken away from you?",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: I just realized something. So you could bring in shaving cream --",
        "Q: -- you could bring in soap, which --",
        "Q: -- but at some point it ran out, yeah, what happened?",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "Q: And toothpaste?",
        "Q: Toothpaste?",
        "Q: Did you brush your teeth every day?",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "Q: And how did you keep clean with cold water? Did you wash with cold water?",
        "Q: It was di --",
        "Q: And -- and you -- and you washed your clothes, or was there laundry?",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: They actually have hot water there?",
        "Q: Now, it sounds odd to have thousands and thousands of people giving their clothes in this\nghetto, to a central laundry. Doesn\u2019t it seem --",
        "Q: In the bag?",
        "Q: And you got it back wet? When you got it back -- do you have any idea how the people\ndried their clothes?",
        "Q: You never hung anything.",
        "Q: Huh.",
        "Q: Lot of work.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about your --",
        "Q: Yes, yes, no. I -- no, I want to talk about your mother, and they we\u2019ll get back to the --\nthe -- the music. Your parents come a few weeks after you come, right, three weeks, am I\nright?",
        "Q: And she thought that you had brought her there?",
        "Q: It was -- but because they were keeping families together?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And you too.",
        "Q: And where did they live when they first came?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Right. And your father is about how old at this point, in his 60\u2019s?",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "Q: And your mother is 18 years younger. Do they both get work right away?",
        "Q: Was really awful.",
        "Q: Okay, we have -- I\u2019m sorry, I have to interrupt you.",
        "Q: Sorry for the interruption. Y-You were talking about your mother being arrested because\nthe -- her bunkmate, the third tier, had contraband?",
        "Q: Commandant?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And was this Sydell\u2019s office? Was he still there or is this later?",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: She wasn\u2019t --",
        "Q: -- hurt?",
        "Q: Were you worried?",
        "Q: Now, s -- he was living at the opposite end of Terezin from where your mother was?",
        "Q: She could visit -- she could go?",
        "Q: Yes. And so when she didn\u2019t come, he knew that something had happened. Was he\ninformed in some way that she was arrested, do you know?",
        "Q: Now were you bringing extra food to your mother and your father? And was this mainly\nin the evening, when they were together? Or don\u2019t y --",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Now, is there a time when they end up living together? No, they never live\ntogether?",
        "Q: In Terezin, that\u2019s what I mean. They don\u2019t. And consequently the three of you are never\nliving together, so that you are all separate.",
        "Q: Do you see them very often? Almost daily?",
        "Q: I see. So where did you eat mainly? Where did you take your meals?",
        "Q: Where you -- so, would you wait in line?",
        "Q: And where would you go -- the -- where people would go --",
        "Q: Just in the kitchen?",
        "Q: So essentially you could eat whenever you wanted, as long as food was available?",
        "Q: Yeah. No, no, for -- for sure she was right. And were your parents -- especially your\nfather, at some point found it advantageous that you had gone first? They -- did he realize\nthe implication?",
        "Q: And that you found after the war?",
        "Q: So you -- but you were very devoted to them?",
        "Q: Right. But they stopped hitting at a certain point, yes?",
        "Q: Did they? Were they short people, or they tall people?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did they have a sense of humor?",
        "Q: You don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: When -- when you -- I\u2019m going to come to the Verdi Requiem in a minute, but when you\nthink about -- if you close your eyes and think about walking around Terezin, and think\nabout what people were looking like, and smelling like and what the sounds were like --\nwas it hurt --",
        "Q: You don\u2019t think so?",
        "Q: And did people look depressed?",
        "Q: Was that an accurate --",
        "Q: It was an accurate portrayal?",
        "Q: Do you have any idea how many people understood that if they could be protected, they\nwould not be put in the transport? You felt protected, insofar as --",
        "Q: -- one -- one could be --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: So were there --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Did you ever feel -- forget guilty, because clearly you didn\u2019t do something against\nanybody, right? But there is a kind of -- I don\u2019t know whether I want to call it moral\ncompromise one makes. You can\u2019t be morally pure in a situation like that. So the fact that\nyou\u2019re protected always means that someone else is unprotected.",
        "Q: The self preservation, yeah --",
        "Q: Is strong.",
        "Q: And that you understood, for a long time.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about the Requiem.",
        "Q: [inaudible].",
        "Q: So when did all of that start? The pre -- the -- the preparation for the \u00b044 -- do you know?",
        "Q: So it\u2019s a long period of time?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And who got the -- everybody get the money, or only a certain portion of you?",
        "Q: Those who worked.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: So you could receive food packages?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: So if this starts in \u201943, all the preparations, is that when Schacter comes up with the idea\nof the Verdi Requiem?",
        "Q: You mean whether the Germans were there or not?",
        "Q: Wh -- you\u2019re saying whether the Germans were there or not to hear it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: I ne -- I need to interrupt you, I\u2019m sorry --",
        "Q: -- I\u2019m going to stop the tape [indecipherable]",
        "Q: No.",
        "Q: Edgar, you were talking about the council being possibly upset if the German -- I mean --",
        "Q: -- upset if the Germans would find out. Now, let me ask you something. You said you\nknow from Schacter what -- what he was really feeling.",
        "Q: Yes. Yeah, is -- is that because you were rooming with him at this time, and you talked\nwith him?",
        "Q: But let me ask you -- I -- I just want to know -- understand something. You -- did you\nmeet him separately from joining the choir, or only when you joined the choir?",
        "Q: Through [indecipherable]",
        "Q: You got together, I see.",
        "Q: And what was the difference in age between the two of you, do you think?",
        "Q: That\u2019s a big difference, yes. But you -- you spent a lot of time together, I gather?",
        "Q: Busy.",
        "Q: So did he tell you ver -- talk to you about wanting to do the Verdi Requiem?",
        "Q: And he told you what --",
        "Q: And what did the council th-think about the danger, that -- that somehow the Nazis would\ndiscover his intention?",
        "Q: But let me ask you something, when you read the words of the Verdi Requiem, it\u2019s als --\nthere\u2019s also words of forgive these people, whoever they are, who -- who, and the\nRequiem is speaking about both the wrath of God and begging for forgiveness, so --",
        "Q: But you sang it.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: So some of it was said for the Jews, and some of it was said against the -- the Nazis, as\nthe interpretation, yes?",
        "Q: When -- when you were rehearsing, did you feel this kind of emotion, that you -- wh-\nwhen -- just when you\u2019re rehearsing yourself --",
        "Q: What was the -- were the rehearsals more intense than when you did \u201cThe Bartered\nBride,\u201d and \u201cThe Magic Flute,\u201d and \u201cThe Marriage of Figaro\u2019\u2019?",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh, right.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes, it\u2019s difficult singing.",
        "Q: So this is September \u00b043?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Was Schacter worried that he was going to be deported at that point?",
        "Q: No, because --",
        "Q: Was he protected in some way, do you think?",
        "Q: And as far as you know, who was it who put together these transport lists?",
        "Q: Maybe there was a special section for cards, a different place.",
        "Q: Would do it.",
        "Q: And was that then approved by the council, or did they just do it themselves?",
        "Q: List.",
        "Q: With the new -- with the new group. Did any of the soloists get deported --",
        "Q: -- or was it only among the choir?",
        "Q: [indecipherable] yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, in -- in the Requiem group --",
        "Q: -- the soloists did not get deported.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Another person.",
        "Q: And when you did the September performance, September \u201943, before that first\ndeportation, was that with a piano accompaniment?",
        "Q: Only piano.",
        "Q: And did he --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: And did he play the piano, or did he do the conducting and someone else played?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: And did Gideon kli -- Klein ever play at the rehearsals?",
        "Q: So it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s somewhat odd, however, to play only at a performance, and never at a\nrehearsal.",
        "Q: Yeah, well he\u2019s --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything ever going wrong in the concerts?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Now, once you started giving performances, or Schacter is conducting the performances\nof the Requiem, starting in January \u00b044 -- January \u00b044, right? You give about 14 or 15 --",
        "Q: 15 performances.",
        "Q: So you ne -- he never restarts again, he just accommodates?",
        "Q: Out of 150.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: This is -- this is Rahm, right?",
        "Q: And the Germans knew what was being sung, because they knew the Catholic liturgy.",
        "Q: Your own Requiem.",
        "Q: Did you see that? Were you there?",
        "Q: No.",
        "Q: Were you told that at the time?",
        "Q: Were you supposed to be interviewed by anybody during this time? Where -- where were\nyou when they were visiting, did you see them?",
        "Q: Are you surprised that nobody said anything?",
        "Q: No. You think that fear was --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Let me -- let me -- let me hold it for one second. This performance for the Germans, was\nit Germans sitting in the front row?",
        "Q: And you can see them, and who -- do you see Eichmann. Is he there?",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "Q: Now, I know that you reported -- you reported in octo -- October one of 1944.",
        "Q: So then [indecipherable] what happens between September -- the perfor -- the -- wait a\nsecond, June -- I\u2019m sorry, June of \u201944 and October? Does Schacter keep you folks\nsinging? There\u2019s a few months there after -- after the Red Cross visit, or is he deported?",
        "Q: After you.",
        "Q: I see, he was still there --",
        "Q: I see. So does the choir -- does he keep working with people? Do you --",
        "Q: So it became much more informal?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Did you end up learning music? Could you read music by this time?",
        "Q: Right. We have to turn -- change the tape.",
        "Q: Edgar, prior to the -- the visit of the Red Cross, which was as far as I know, June 24\",\n1944, di -- th-the painter\u2019s affair, they arrested the pain -- the artist was before that, am I\ncorrect?",
        "Q: And so they were deported before the performance?",
        "Q: Was that also surprising to you that that happened?",
        "Q: Right, for the sort of undercover --",
        "Q: Yeah. Now, you said that Schacter was a very sweet guy when he wasn\u2019t being a\nconductor, but once he was going to be serious about his music, he was a tyrant. Was he\nalso charismatic? Was he also a very compelling person, or was he just very strict when\nhe was doing his --",
        "Q: Yeah.",

So we were playing outside, there\nwas a -- a little wooded lawn area in front of the synagogue, and we were sent out, it was\na break. But I never became very religious.

The religion was taught once a week, and a rabbi, a priest, and a minister came,\nand in different classrooms, religious education was conducted. But I can only speak for\nthe Jewish education. We learned about the holidays, we learned to read the Hebrew\nalphabet. And at the end of the school year, the upper class dropped out -- it was for all\nthe grades, kids of all grades together. So the upper classes dropped out, a new one came\nin, and we started from the beginning. So I knew very well the holidays, and the alphabet,\nand it was very repetitive.

There was a -- a non-\nageression agreement, France and England on this side of Germany, Czechoslovakia on\nthis side, should any -- should one be attacked, the others would assist. And at that time,\nChamberlain and Daladier decided -- I don\u2019t know whether decided, they thought if they\ngive in this little bit to Hitler, they avoid World War II. So not only was, in September\n\u00b038, this border area occupied by the Nazis, they also came beyond the Czech\nfortifications which they had on the border, against the Germans, so now they were\nstanding there naked, without any fa -- without any safety, security or fortifications. So it\nwas anticipated that Hitler\u2019s appetite will grow to the point where he will occupy also the\nCzech lands.

So I got exposed to bringing coal from\nthe bay -- from the cellar, not only to the kitchen, but also to the third floor where his\nwife lived, where wi -- they lived, and taking down the ashes, and the -- whether they\ndidn\u2019t have yet -- they must have had, but they didn\u2019t use them, vacuum cleaners, so I\ntook the carpet down, and in the yard was a -- a beam, put the carpet over, and by hand\nyou bang it, there was a -- I don\u2019t know whether you ever seen one, it\u2019s a big antique\n[indecipherable] now.

Anyway, so you had two carriages, and there were little poles -- but\nthey were not poles like this, but they were like -- like a cup, a large cup, and I went to all\nthese three offices, deliver the soups, just in time to come back at noon to wash the\ndishes, there were three tables in that -- opposite the counter where some workers, or\npeople came and consumed their meal there.

And then there was a Gymnasium where you had to make an entrance\nexam and pay. That was private and you had to pay. O-Of course I didn\u2019t qualify -- I may\nhave qualified with the exam, but I didn\u2019t qualify with the payment. So I made -- I had\nthe three -- three additional years through the five grades schools, and then came the\ndecision about learning the trade. And so it reminded me of stories that I read. The\naristocrats in central Europe, the Germans, or -- they had the mansions, or castles, and\nthey had over there cooking staff, including pastry chefs and so. And every apprentice\nwas stuffed. Eat, eat, eat. So he gets -- he gets fed up with it, and then he eats very little,\nso he won\u2019t be too expensive by consuming a lot of food later. And this guy tried me on\nplum dumplings.

In -- you had to -- I think it was in\nGermany, it was also before the war, in Czechoslovakia that everybody had to be\nregistered at the police station. And when you moved, you had to unregister here, and\nregister there. And we had again, borders, and he went to the police station to register a\nborder, and the waiter\u2019s apprentice came with the soups, and he asked, \u201cHow is Edgar\ndoing?\u201d He says, \u201cI don\u2019t know, he isn\u2019t working a week already, he was fired.\u201d So that\nhe didn\u2019t tolerate, he thought I did something bad.

And then there was an excellent restaurant, first class\nrestaurant in the -- you walk through a passage, and inside was the restaurant, and up on\nthe -- what here is the second floor, were function rooms. And I learned everything from\nslaughterhouse to fine pastry. It was an excellent restaurant.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t know how others decided. They may have inclination for cooking, or\nnecessity, or I d -- I don\u2019t know why others started their apprenticeship. So -- and I\nmoved -- as I said, I worked in the slaughterhouse, I learned to skin cattle, and I --",
        "A: Pardon?",

        "A: -- with a -- was a -- not a gun, but was something he had in the hand, he pushed the\nbutton and shot the cattle in the head. And it was not kosher, so I learned everything and I\ndon\u2019t know -- now when I pick up a 30 - 35 pound luggage going to the airport, it seems\nvery heavy. I was carrying whole quarters of beef to -- in the -- in town was a\nmarketplace where in the basement, the whole basement was refrigerated. And because\nmeat and beef was not as tender as we have here -- now here, beef is fed with corn, and in\nsix months it\u2019s big enough to be slaughtered. So it means you have tender -- young,\ntender meat. There, it took much longer with grass and hay to feed the cattle, and -- so it\nhad to age. It was hanging three weeks in that uniform temperature. And when you were\nable to scrape off the moss from the meat, it was the right age. And I was on a spiral\nstaircase, I was carrying down whole quarters of beef, I don\u2019t know how I did that.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: And -- okay, and then the next station was soup, with a soup chef, and then with a\nvegetable chef. And I remember for the soup, he was a young guy, but he was -- he was a\nnasty guy. But not because I was Jew, he was nasty to everybody. I had to cut for soup,\nso there were kettles where they were boiling all the bones, and all the meat that you cut\noff the ends, and what you didn\u2019t want on the portion to be served, and vegetable, and all\nthe -- the peels of the onion, which gives good color to the soup. And as a filler for some\nsoups, was a small dice of vegetable, carrots, celery, theirs was the root celery, and\nparsley and had to cut those in uniform dice by hand, and when I had about this much in a\npot, he came and looked through it and if wasn\u2019t uniform, he threw it in the kettle, and I\nhad to start again. And it -- it 1s a -- it is a good method, you don\u2019t want to work\n[indecipherable] while you do it. You learn to do it perfect. It\u2019s like this, you know, you\nremember it.",
        "A: This I don\u2019t remember. Then the grill, and the roast, and then the -- well, braising, you\nknow, because the meat was not as tender as this meat, and in spite of aging, for steaks,\nonly the tenderloin and the sirloin was used. The other pieces were not suitable. So these\nwere -- there\u2019s a goulash and butt roast, you know, braised with -- with gravy. So that\nwas the station where I worked. And of course, not just the beef, there were pork and\nlamb and fish. Yeah, after the slaughterhouse, I was in the basement working with two\nbutchers. They were from those quarters preparing a portion size, whether it was a roast,\nor whether it was steaks to be cut. I worked there before I got to the soups. And then the\nsalad department, and then the pastry. And the pastry was a pastry chef, and a female\nhelper, and she loved me. I was lucky with women. No, she was very nice, she covered\nup for my mistakes, and you know, we were making like a -- a sponge cake, but a little\ndifferent, from 80 eggs. So if you spoil 80 eggs, it was -- labor was cheap that time, and\nfood was expensive. Here it\u2019s different. So she was nice to me, and -- and on the salad I\nworked in, they were th -- the salad was not just salad, it was decorative items like fish in\n-- in aspic, and gelled, and -- a first class place. And -- yeah?",
        "A: No, the whole apprenticeship went on till spring of 1941.",

One day a week -- I worked six days, and one day a week I went to vocational\nschool where -- that was compulsory, to learn hygiene, and -- and about the foods, about\nthe [indecipherable] and a description of handling, why this way, why that way.

        "A: First to learn, you move around, and then if the apprenticeship from the soup post was\nsick, so they took one [indecipherable] and you moved around, and you were able to\nsubstitute in every department. And there was no anti-Semitism. All the time -- in \u201941, the\nowner -- there were two owners, one was more looking at the kitchen, the other one was\nlooking at the other areas. And he was very nice, and he came and said he\u2019s under great\npressure to let me go, and he didn\u2019t expl -- didn\u2019t have to explain to me why, I knew. And\nat that time I couldn\u2019t get a job any more in another restaurant. Now, we were at ni -- it\u2019s\n\"41, you pushed me too far ahead.",

        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: March 15\", 1935 -- ?39. And immediately thereafter they started to apply the -- what they\ncall the Jewish laws, which were actually anti-Jewish laws. I think you have knowledge\nabout them -- about those --",
        "A: The first thing was to identify the Jews, although they ar -- physically identify, and\nphysically and visibly identify, because they had at the police records they had all the\nJews, because at the time you had to give your religion -- I don\u2019t know for whatever\npurpose, but to -- at the police station your registration was your religion known. So the\nfirst thing came this yellow star to wear. And you had to wear it on every piece of\noutwear, so if you took your jacket off, you had to have one on your shirt. And then,\nturning in all the valuables, including wedding rings, which I guess the Germans used to\nfinance their war efforts. Then a radio, so you can\u2019t listen to BBC. Everything was dual\nintent, for the Germans to enrich themselves with those items, and the second purpose\nwas to deprive the Jews of whatever gave them pleasure or resistance. So the radios, so\nyou couldn\u2019t listen to BBC, and then musical instruments had to be turned in. And then\ncame restrictions to travel, you couldn\u2019t go out, get out of your town. [indecipherable]\nYou could not enter public areas like movies, theaters or parks, playgrounds. And Jews\ncould travel in the streetcar only in the last car, on the last platform standing. And there\nwere many more -- oh, ration tickets were issued. There were three kinds of -- for the\nGermans, they were -- we were already somewhat restricted because was a war economy.\nThe Czechs got less, and the Jews got almost a blank paper. And if you were caught with\nsomething that you could not have -- that was not on those tickets, it was -- this was\npunishable. So my parents had my food ration ticket, because I ate at the restaurant. And\nthey get -- had 50 percent more of almost nothing, that\u2019s -- how much that is, I don\u2019t\nknow. Mathematician has to figure that out. But they were better off than some other\npeople.",

They were not deeply involved in anything\nspiritual, I mean, they were 400 years under the Austrians, under the Hapsburgs before\nWorld War I, then for 20 years -- and they tolerated it and cooperated, and they had to\nlive -- make a living. Then for 20 years they were free, from eight -- 1918 till \u201938, and\nthere were great Czech patriots. And when the Germans occupied, many became\nsympathizers, and collaborants -- collaborators. Then there were again great Czechs after\n\"45. There were fighters for Czech freedom 10 minutes before the war ended, and -- not\n10 minutes, two days. And then the Communists took over, they became the great\nCommunists. And in 1989, the biggest Communists, who were Etta Truff, and -- made all\nthe money and stole all the money, they were the ones, the first ones who privatized state\nenterprises. And with their Communist connections, they got it for almost nothing, and\ntoday they\u2019re millionaires. So they can adjust in the [indecipherable] so, any condition.",

It was not a frightful\nsituation, concerned, worried. I think that the prevailed -- the -- the th-thought prevailed,\nwe are going to do a job somewhere and we come back. Because there were before\ngroups sent to certain areas where the German a -- the -- the head, or [indecipherable] or\nwife was residing in a castle and the group was sent there to do the landscaping, and then\nthey came back when it was finished. And there was another group working in the forest,\nI\u2019m not sure what they did there, and they came back. So I think that did example must\nhave been in their mind, because it was not nervous, it -- it was upsetting, taken away\nfrom your wife and kids, but so we were allowed to take with us 110 pounds of luggage.\nAnd it consisted mainly, going into the winter, of warm clothing, and everyone had the\n110 pounds, and two pair of pants, and two jackets, and another coat, and you know, to --\nthe -- to --",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: So we were brought in to what was called the Sudeten barracks, and when we entered, the\ngates closed behind us. And when we came there, it was open. We came in, and the gates\nclosed. So that was the first time suspicion of some prison type accommodation is\nbeginning. We were assembled on the courtyard, and the commandant was a doctor, I\ndon\u2019t know what kind of a doctor, he was not a cardiologist I know, because he didn\u2019t\nhave a good heart. But they assembled us and told us everything we are not allowed to\ndo.",

So the electricity\nand the -- and the water and the sewer, all these -- these people were specialists picked\nfor that job, and some of it was outside --",

        "A: Czech gendarme. And some of them were very good, they felt, you know, that one Czech\nto another, and the re-relation didn\u2019t make a difference. Some were bad, and some were\nafraid to be good.",
        "A: So there three categories. You had to know with whom you are dealing. So you could go\nout only accompanied by a work detail.",
        "A: I was inside the barrack, never got out. I mean, never, for a certain period --",
        "A: -- until it was filled. Anyway, I started to say that until 1938, those barracks were used --\noccupied and used by the military and since the German occupation, there was no\nmilitary in those barracks, they were closed. And of course, they started to deteriorate, a\nlack of maintenance, and weather, and rusty and dusty, and -- and repairs, the floor, the\npipes. So -- but I couldn\u2019t get anybody to help me to prepare the kitchens, because they\nhad their assigned job. Until later they got the idea that it\u2019s good to have some relations\nwith the kitchen under the conditions we were living at, and they came and helped, that\nthey did some manual work, and the engineers did some repair. And they finally got the\none kitchen going. There were two kitchens in the Sudeten.",
        "A: We were told to take a three day something -- for the first day some sandwiches, and then\nsome non-perishable food like a canned food or so, there was no frozen, or whatever --",
        "A: -- prepared meals. So for three days we took --",
        "A: -- our own food, and we were able on the third day already to prepare a soup, and -- and\nbread was delivered for the 342.",
        "A: That wasn\u2019t difficult to make, the soup, that if you did nothing else. That -- that -- the\nother cook was there, we worked together. He was not very enthusiastic about it.",
        "A: Kettle, like you saw in that picture.",
        "A: Huge, yeah, 400 liter, hundred gallon kettles. Some were steam heated from a central\nsteam line, which then had to be augmented, the capacity I mean, of which. And some\nburn coal. So there -- you found -- I\u2019m jumping ahead again. Okay, we\u2019re in that kitchen\nand preparing it and we got ready, and six days later, a transport of thousand people came\nfrom Brno, that\u2019s the capital of Moravia.",
        "A: And what -- it was the job of the Council of Elders, and now while -- if the Council of\nElder was in Terezin, so there were other officials in Prague, and those big communities,\nthat had to put the thousand people to fill a transport, on German orders. This 1s a terrible\nresponsibility to decide whom you dislocate from their regular life, which was lousy\nalready anyway, but it was something known, and send them away. But what they did,\nthey kept families together. In my case it was negative, because they wanted me to be\ntogether with my parents, so they came three weeks after me, while they otherwise might\nhave, by chance, stayed longer in their accommodations at home.",
        "A: And this principle prevailed also when transports were put together from Terezin to the\neast.",
        "A: Families together, unless one of the family members were -- was in a job -- it could work\nboth ways -- a job that was necessary either for war industry or -- or for maintenance of\nthe town -- functioning of the town, they either kept the one and send the rest, or they\nkept the whole family back. And I don\u2019t know who and why and how these decisions\nwere made, but these were three ways of people staying in Terezin till the end, or being\nshipped out.",
        "A: Yeah, 17 and a half",
        "A: 17 and a half.",
        "A: Almost three quarter.",
        "A: It\u2019s hard for me to say, it y -- sounds like bragging, but my wife wa -- brings that up,\nwhereas that it was unbelievable that age 17 and three quarters, I could organize the\nsetting up of the kitchen, and not only that. When that first transport came of -- I don\u2019t\nremember what the other one did.",
        "A: He was the -- yeah, he -- he worked alone, but he did not initiate anything. I think he was\nmad that he was taken out of his regular life. With that first transport, I mention whole\nfamilies came, so I had somebody staff the kitchen with women who knew about food,\nwho knew about preparation of food, understood food, although they never worked for\nthousand people, I -- I -- neither did I. But at least somebody who knows how to handle\nfood -- food. Now, there was flour in -- in the warehouses. There was some sugar, there\nwas some margarine, and interestingly, there was plenty of spices. Pepper, paprika,\ncaraway. I guess that was not a -- an item the Germans were short of. But there was no\nvegetable, there was no fruit. There was occasionally some marmalade, and not to jump\ntoo fast, we started up one kitchen, and then, or after that first transport, every second\nday, third day, another thousand people came. And I don\u2019t remember how many\nthousands that Sudeten held, but when it was full, the Germans decided to separate\nwomen from the men.",
        "A: Often families together, yeah. And I never went up to look how they a-accommodated\nwith a -- a family occupies one of the three sections of the bunk, or above each other, or -",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, no, there was the -- this military barrack --",
        "A: -- was one long --",
        "A: -- one long room, and then they put up the bunks this way.",
        "A: I was staying in one -- one of -- one --",
        "A: One of these bunks, yeah. I wasn\u2019t privileged yet, later I had some privileges.",
        "A: Yeah. So when they se -- decided to separate the women from the men, they designated\nthe Dresner for the women. That other cook went there, and with the women went girls of\nall ages, and boys under age 15.",
        "A: Those 15 and older stayed there, and they were assigned jobs.",
        "A: Everyone -- everyone had some job designated.",
        "A: Then Dresner, yeah.",
        "A: Dresner.",
        "A: Dresden 1s the town, and the designation 1s Dresner --",
        "A: -- it\u2019s [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- barracks, it\u2019s instead of an [indecipherable]",
        "A: And --",
        "A: In Dresner he did.",
        "A: He did. But he stayed there, and when Dresner was full and another barracks was -- the\nkitchen to be set up, I went.",
        "A: I hope by that time people were already capable of running -- what was interesting, most\nof the so-called head chefs in those kitchens, were former butchers.",
        "A: Although the -- no meat was handled. Oh yes, when the horse died somewhere in the\nneighborhood, we got it in -- we got it -- we got --",
        "A: We got the meat. And if there was a butcher store originally, for the germ -- yeah -- I\u2019m\nhandling it too fast.",
        "A: We were isolated and walking from barracks to barracks or to the workplace,\naccompanied by gendarmes. By June 1942, the last of these town inhabitants was\nevacuated by the Germans. I don\u2019t know how they were accommodated, whether they\nfound them, but that wasn\u2019t my problem.",
        "A: June.",
        "A: June \u00b042.",
        "A: And from then on, the gates of the barracks were open, and when you finished your job,\nyour work, your assigned work, you could go with that family and move around without\nbeing accompanied or guarded. So I went from barrack to barracks, and part of just\npreparing the kitchen, was also training people to -- to -- I did get information of what is\nin the -- in the warehouse. And I got information how many people are already living\nthere. So based on that, I made use of supplies for individual barracks, and later on even a\nsophisticated menu, how many grams of what to --",
        "A: Yeah. I told you, there\u2019s one -- there were some women who were able to administer the\nkitchen, not just the butchers, and that [indecipherable] it\u2019s -- it\u2019s funny that there was no\nmeat, but the butchers seemed to be the best administrators of a kitchen.",
        "A: That -- that started out this way. Later there were people who were in business, food\nbusiness, so I had stores at -- and groceries and -- and other related business. They\nbecame -- they became the warehouse -- 0-operating the warehouse, and this -- they\ndidn\u2019t got the information, and without my interference or -- or participation, based on\nthe initial set-up, delivered directly to --",
        "A: Not in the barracks, the difference was -- and that was -- you know, the Council of Elders\nhad very -- they were, so to say, the town administration. They were actually a cabinet,\nthere was a man designated for transportation and for labor and for health and for supply,\nand -- and other departments. But they had very little room for initiative. That was all\nbased on strict rules set by the Germans. However they, where possible, they applied\ntheir own decision making. Like for instance for the children, and that was a little bit\nlater, the -- a children\u2019s kitchen was -- was created, that had more of the food a growing\nchild needs, because children were our future. And they decided those who had hard\nlabor assignments to get more food. Of course, that was taken away from the general\npopulation, but the general population was so large, that the few privileged groups -- and\nit wasn\u2019t privileged, was rewarded appropriately, larger por -- rations. But it did not\nimpact tremendously.",
        "A: Not much was taken away from all the thousands of the regular population to feed the\nfew -- to improve the ration of the children and the -- those who have hard -- performed\nhard labor. So at -- this way I was hopping from one barrack to another, trying to get the\nmost capable person to stay behind and run it, all while I was 18 - 18 and a half.",
        "A: Important?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. I -- I don\u2019t think -- I liked to do that. I felt good having a responsibility.",
        "A: Being trusted and so, yeah, but --",
        "A: It -- it -- not -- really not, really not. He had his jobs to do, and I did mine, and there was\nno -- he did -- except those, as I said, the instructions as to portion size for the kids, and\nthen the decision to create a kit -- a children\u2019s kitchen and a diet kitchen.",
        "A: What does that mean? That was maybe in the small -- I think it was a p-previous\nrestaurant in -- for the civilians of the -- the kitchen was then, for people who had\ndiabetes or gall bladder or stuff, to give more of one item that they can have, and less of\nsomething that would be harmful to them. You know, a -- a diet within the framework of\navailability.",
        "A: That was only very later, and -- and these were only some of the privileged people --",
        "A: -- who had connections to get a room in one of those -- where the -- where the town\npopulation was living, they got one room per family, and they had a little kerosene\ncooker, or so, and --",
        "A: No, much less.",
        "A: Much less.",
        "A: In the -- except in the -- I -- even -- even in the days when it was snowing, from those\nkettles the food was transferred into barrels, taken out and in the yard, served. And lines\nwere forming, and the -- very soon they made not ration tickets, but meal tickets, which\nthey were printed there somewhere, and all the days of the month on it, and there was one\nperson, called ordnungs Dienst, somebody who kept order with the band, armband, and\nit\u2019s not a s -- what do you call it, it\u2019s -- made holes into these --",
        "A: -- tickets, showing that the person was already there, and to reject him if he came a\nsecond time. And --",
        "A: Yes. I don\u2019t know what -- what they did if -- they wouldn\u2019t let them starve, but I don\u2019t\nknow what the -- could be only for that month that he was starving, but I -- I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: This -- this organizational part, I -- I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Now if the person with the ladle at the barrel was your friend, you had a chance to get\nlike -- you came with a bigger container, and he may give you two ladles full, or may\nreach lower down to get you some of the sm -- more of the solids. This is something that\nhas developed -- you know, a barter system has developed. There was no money, so\neveryone -- it may not sound nice, but that\u2019s what happened, everyone who had access to\nsomething, like the carpenter had access to wood, the cook had access to food, there were\nworkshops where they worked for the Germans, so s -- that was a mitzvah to steal from\nthe Germans. The other was a little less colorful. The cooks were expected to give their\nfamily little more, but it was not ethical to steal more and get from a carpenter a shelf,\nwhere you put up your shaving stuff, you know? Or --",
        "A: Yes, yes. And it happened in -- in every single department. And what is even less ethical\nwas that only those families who had someone involved in -- in one of those trades where\nyou could schleusse something, that was called also, to -- th-they didn\u2019t say steal, they\nsaid to schleusse it.",
        "A: To -- yeah, in Auschwitz, it was called organizing.",
        "A: And here was called, to swipe, or whatever. So there was -- there were -- were different\ncategories and levels of -- of f-feeding, and -- and access to the -- you know, you got\nsomeone working in the -- in the clothes warehouse, where the clothes was that was\neither confiscated upon arrival, or if someone died who didn\u2019t have a family, who wanted\nto retain the goods, went to the warehouse. The Germans sent this to Germany for their\nown people, they needed it, or -- while they were at war so long. So if somebody stole\ntheir something [indecipherable] so where, everywhere somebody had something that\nsomebody else wanted, he bartered for or something he wanted or needed, or didn\u2019t need,\nbut got it anyway. Cigarettes were the most valuable barter item. The Germans didn\u2019t\nknow how well they mean to the Jews when they forbid them to smoke. Otherwise they\nwould have brought in a lot of cigarettes.",
        "A: Si -- through some of these good gendarmes.",
        "A: You pay them, and some did it even without paying. They contacted your family in\nPrague, and the aunt or whoever, came to the gendarmes home, who lived nearby,\ndelivered the stuff, and he brought it in, and you pick it up at the gate, or so --",
        "A: Some did it for payment, and some did it just out of good heart.",
        "A: The -- the most valuable currency.",
        "A: And there were people who gave up their food in Auschwitz, people died because they --\nthe meager ration they gave for a cigarette. Couldn\u2019t stop smoki --",
        "A: I -- not many women were smoking, I -- I -- I don\u2019t know. I couldn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know\nabout women, but I know men.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it was lipstick, but I -- I -- I -- I don\u2019t know. Maybe my wife will be able to\ntell you.",
        "A: Just barter -- barter --",
        "A: -- barter economy. Bartered with -- with whatever you had, you brought with you, and\ndidn\u2019t use it, and somebody else wanted it. All things that you --",
        "A: -- disappropriated somewhere where you had access to.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember in which grade, kids dragged me into the bathroom in school, I was a\nyoung kid still, and gave me a puff of a cigarette, and I coughed so much that I never\ntouched it again. So --",
        "A: No, I never got cigarettes, and I never -- I -- I had the -- I had some of the food that I\ncould use, and I tell you how I used it. We are already far ahead, and I wanted also to\nbring out my -- the initi -- the beginning and impact of Schacter on the whole camp, and\non me personally.",
        "A: Yeah, no, but that started -- he came in December of \u201941, so --",
        "A: -- we did -- we didn\u2019t have to go back.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: How do -- yeah, yeah, how do you --",
        "A: You -- you have your own --",
        "A: -- Intelligence network?",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t find anybody of his family.",
        "A: His wife was a little bit taking advantage. She -- she bartered with -- with giving favors to\nmen.\nTape #5",
        "A: That\u2019s why I tried to introduce Schacter, because we have something in common.",
        "A: [coughs] Sorry. He -- I consider him a psychologist without a certificate, or without a\ndiploma. He recognized the -- and I'll come to your question --",
        "A: -- he recognized immediately upon his arrival, the -- that the prison mentality can sink\ninto the people\u2019s mind. That when he came, when the gates were still closed, and he got\neverybody together and encouraged them to sing. And most of the songs were Czech\npopular songs, which most of people knew. And it had a tremendous impact on\neverybody, not just during the time you were singing, and gathers others who were not\nsinging, were sitting there and listening, to the point that not just that hour, hour and a\nhalf, you forgot every -- that the reality of your actual circumstances, but you took with\nyou a little bit of -- like a care package, a -- a spiritual care package to help you carry on\ni-1n -- for the -- until the next time when we sing.",
        "A: The Sudeten in the basement, and not only that, I mentioned to you that the gates were\nclosed, and the women were in another barracks. I don\u2019t know how he managed, he\nappeared in the women\u2019s barracks, and did the same with the women, with the same\nbeneficial impact. So I -- why I represented him before answering your question, I knew\nthat the Czechs lived through their stomach. Even now, this family, when they come to\nvisit, the sister-in-law and the nephews and nieces, food is so meaningful, they come into\nthe house, and they go right, pick up the covers of the pots and -- and then pinch here,\nand pinch there. I tried with those ingredients we had, to make food that\u2019s mainly a Czech\n-- Czech food. Dumplings -- we had flour. I don\u2019t know how, on my request, yeast came\ninto the camp, and we made dumplings, and from this so-called coffee, that was a dark\ngrain, nothing to do with coffee, but it was dark and looked like it, and we cooked it, and\nlet it cool, and at the right temperature, 1f you put in some margarine and whipped it, it\ndidn\u2019t dissolve completely, and it -- you know it didn\u2019t melt. It stayed like little dots of\nmar -- people thought that\u2019s the best sauce on a dumpling they ever ate. And some people\nasked after the war, said, could you make it for me?",
        "A: So this -- in this way I tried to accommodate or improve their mental state with providing\nfood that is close to the Czech stomach. And I say Czech because these people were first\nCzechs, and then they were Jews, then they were -- if not they, then somebody else made\nthem aware that they are Jews.",
        "A: So in this way I mention Schacter first, because in his way he did work on the Czech\nmind, and I worked on the Czech stomachs.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And then there was -- and from the nearby neighborhood of those houses\nwhere the origin population lived, nearest to each barrack, those people were designated\nto this particular barrack.",
        "A: And then the further -- located further away, for those -- sorry, for those a kitchen was\nbuilt in -- on the main road, and that was only to be delivered to another location, central\nlocation where those able of walking could come to. And from that kitchen also, the ones\nwho couldn\u2019t come were supplied like meals on wheels, Terezin style. So --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Those who had no connection to, or anything to barter with, or had something but were in\nthe attic and couldn\u2019t get down and mingle, those really -- 1t was -- it\u2019s not starving on the\nstreet falling down, but they, of malnutrition, lack of vitamins and -- and s -- lack of\nappropriate amounts of food, even if it wasn\u2019t the right food, caused them to -- made\nthem susceptible to diseases and we had the best doctors, all the doctors were there.\nThere was a operating room that was brought in from a Jewish hospital in Prague. And if\nyou only need a doctor\u2019s attention, you had the best attention, but if you needed\nmedication, you were [indecipherable]. I had my hernia operated there.",
        "A: And ne -- didn\u2019t need anything else except a surgeon\u2019s intervention. And I healed, and\nthat was okay. But if you had something, I don\u2019t know, asthma, that they gave you --\ninhale some vapors, hot water or so, hot water vapors, but there was really no medication\nthat --",
        "A: I think -- yeah, it was, it was ether.",
        "A: No. I didn\u2019t any.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no. That -- they were dying in the -- in that -- in the infirmary, or -- or where they\nlived, but it was maybe not direct starving, but starvation induced susceptibility to\ndiseases which put them in pneumonia. Dysentery -- dysentery killed the most people.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think there were that many. Th -- in the barracks --",
        "A: -- in the barracks -- in the military barracks were not latrines, but the soldiers had there a\nwall of urinals, and then what do you call it, those booth or separations with a toilet. And\nthere were people standing in line. In some areas, where it was necessary, some latrines\nwere built. And I don\u2019t know how they were emptied, and the stuff carried away, or\nsanitized I think, with some -- some carc -- it\u2019s calcium, but it\u2019s not calcium like you take\nfor your bones, it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know how itt is particular --",
        "A: L-Lime. Oh, isn\u2019t she wonderful, lime. What would I do without you?",
        "A: So -- but still, it was dysenter -- Hana\u2019s grandparents, both of them -- no, was\ngrandmother and -- and this brother of her grandfather came, he -- he was 80 years old\nand he worked as a lumberjack, he was splitting wood for the -- starting the fires in those\nkettles. And there was a [indecipherable] six weeks later he was gone, with diarrhea -- the\ndysentery.",
        "A: Dehydration, you know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how -- you know, in those houses and apartments of the town population,\nthese were not apartments with two or three bathrooms that -- nobody had two bathrooms\nexcept some super rich people in their villas. But here, they -- they must have had --\npossibly, problems. But in the military barracks, there were these -- was these rows of\none huge trough or two in the middle of pipe, water pipe, with --",
        "A: -- with faucets along. And I have a picture at home of one of those ladies\u2019 washrooms.",
        "A: All the bar -- all the barracks --",
        "A: -- all the military barracks had washrooms. But cold water only.",
        "A: Which in winter was not very pleasant, but --",
        "A: I told you I was a big shot. In eight -- with 18 or 19 years, and I had -- and I don\u2019t know\nhow and where I got it. Could be -- it could have been a part of barter result that some\ncarpenter put a -- a few boards up, separated a bigger -- a smaller room from the rest of\nthe big room, and his wife -- in the Hamburger was a jail for women. I didn\u2019t mention yet\nthat there was a -- the gendarmes was -- were watching outside, and inside was a ghetto\npolice, established by the Council of Elders and they looked like -- under the cap and the\n-- and the yellow armband identifying them as a police.",
        "A: They had some -- they wore black -- I don\u2019t know, but everyone had exactly the same.\nBut you could recognize that he\u2019s of the police formation. The -- how did we get to the\npolice?",
        "A: The lawyer, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: -- okay.",
        "A: That\u2019s from the wife we came to the police.",
        "A: Did I say that?",
        "A: Yeah, okay. This is how she -- I think this is how she got the -- either head of the -- the\njail mistress, or chai -- jail warden in the Dresner. And the jail was the -- when -- 1t was\nused by the military, the barracks, there was a guard room, and there was another room\nwhere they rested if they -- between shifts, or between the guard duties. And there was a -\n- they put up a [indecipherable] and there was a temporary holding jail.",
        "A: For women. And I don\u2019t know why women were being --",
        "A: -- jailed. No.",
        "A: My mother was jailed, but that was by the Germans. And that was in the Kommandatur,\nwhich was in a bank building and down where the vaults were, they had the jails.",
        "A: I think so, I -- I was --",
        "A: -- held in one at the moment of weakness. I -- just for the short time we know each other\nyou must know I\u2019m a very easy going person. And I -- I have tremendous amount of\npatience. But when it comes to the point where I can no longer be patient, I can be a\nmurderer. I can kill. So, I -- I totally lose presence of mind, and just instinct. There were\ntwo very young SS men, they would de -- everybody called them kindergarten. And they\nwere driving the tractors that were pulling the -- the heavy loads, so they were -- because\nthe Jews, they didn\u2019t want to entrust a Jew, that distracts the Jews. And one day they\ncome in front of the Hamburger. There\u2019s an old man going, and one of them -- I -- he\ndidn\u2019t see them, he didn\u2019t take his hat off, or whatever, and they went in and started to\nunload on him, with hitting. I went with a friend, I tore loose, and I knocked them both\ndown to the ground. A normal person wouldn\u2019t do that, but that\u2019s the condition I get in\nwhen it snaps. And they started to shoot, but they were drunk, and it didn\u2019t help. So they\nget the police, grab me in, pull me into their guard room, and the other guy went to the\nhead of the Council of Elders to tell him about it. And he cleaned it up, because those two\nwere drunk and shouldn\u2019t have been there. So somehow I got away. I don\u2019t know how,\nbecause nobody attacks SS men unpunished. So you asked the jail, and I went to\nsideways in saying I was in there. So he was -- he knew about it and he suffered by it, and\nwe consoled each other. And --",
        "A: But that\u2019s another way of saying it.",
        "A: Could have been there, not many, but under those conditions, and not knowing transports\nhave -- were lea -- were leaving, and you don\u2019t know where they go, or -- or what\u2019s\nhappening. So the level of morality sank a little, and people wanted to enjoy as much as\nthey could, and as long as they could. And you did not have to be in love just to perform\nand enjoy. So I don\u2019t know whether, or how many, if so, would have used this as a\ncurrency.",
        "A: I think most of it was just sex.",
        "A: As long as -- as long as you\u2019re here, you know you -- there are some certain rooms, or\nyou had the roommate, you tell him get out of here, and so -- but I think it was very little.\nWell, there were young people who -- who -- Hana\u2019s sister got -- Hana\u2019s brother made a\nvery serious acquaintance, and before -- on the day he was deported, 1n the morning, he\nmarried this girl. So there\u2019s a chance that they -- they can go together and she wouldn\u2019t --\nher supervisor wouldn\u2019t let her go, because she worked in the agriculture, which was\nbringing in harvest for the Germans. The agriculture was not for the ghetto, that was for\nthe Germans. So the -- these are the -- sure, there were instances where people fell in love\nwith each other, or shared the -- the sorrow, which then became bearable through nice\ncompanionship. But there was also just this free -- free life before. It may not be again.",
        "A: No, it was enlightening to me.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: You\u2019re asking too many questions, I already my --",
        "A: -- [had already my apprenticeship before I went to -- to Terezin. But there, yes, and it\nwas not the barter, it was mutual drive to enjoy as much as possible --",
        "A: -- under the given circumstances, which were not very enjoyable.",
        "A: They may not return to Terezin --",
        "A: -- but they may go to another camp and build, and -- and create a new ghetto, or a new\nlabor -- labor camp, and -- and the Germans kept this ver -- that was the best kept secret.\nFor instance, they ordered, for one time, a thousand men, age 18 to 55, but only men t-\ntransport, that they go somewhere to build a new labor camp. And the next transport, the\nwives of those men were encouraged to volunteer so they can be with their men, and\nthey\u2019re never -- they were never together, because in Auschwitz, the men went one side,\nthe women the other, and there were men who went to the right and to the left, and\nwomen who went to the right and the left. So they never were together again. But it gave\nan impression in the ghetto that they go somewhere, and they going to be together, and\nit\u2019s not so bad.",
        "A: Nobody had, even afterwards.",
        "A: And when -- when the train opened in Auschwitz, and I saw what Arbeit macht frei in\nAuschwitz, I still did not believe what it is.",
        "A: I think we\u2019ll get there in -- in more detail --",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: His name was Otto Freund.",
        "A: Freund was a friend.",
        "A: And he -- already, before he came to Terezin, he Czechisized it because he thought he\nwill function better as a lawyer under a Czech name, and spelled it f-a -- F-r-a-j-t, Frajt.",
        "A: Frajt. That\u2019s a -- that\u2019s not a Jewish name, so --",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: A very nice, mild mannered, wonderful guy. And I think he suffered knowing what\u2019s\nhappening with his wife, and I think he had no influence, or didn\u2019t want to interfere. He\njust [indecipherable] tolerated it, and he didn\u2019t come back, and I inquired after the war if\nthere are any relatives of his, and couldn\u2019t find anybody.",

And in -- at night, they were\ndrawing the -- making the drawings of the real life in Terezin, which you may have seen -\n- mainly there\u2019s a book, and more books than one. And they smuggled some of that\nthrough these gendarmes. And there was also, in the agriculture department, they had\nhorses that were drawing -- pulling the -- the carts, and the horses produced manure, and\nthey took that manure out, and underneath, they smuggled out letters, and -- and these\nposters, and so -- so some of those, I don\u2019t know which way they went out, and some\nwere found in Switzerland.",

        "A: No, no. It wasn\u2019t dangerous what I did, it was, I said, maybe inappropriate from the\ngeneral point of view, favoring some individuals, but there were [indecipherable] six,\nseven painters.",

        "A: -- the singing in those basements after. And then, after June \u201942, when people could move\nfreely, he assembled the men and the women together in the basement of the military\nheadquarters near -- on the right of the church.",
        "A: And that was during the day, a carpenter shop, and at night we put up some boards like\nthis, and the choir stood there and was singing and rehearsing. As soon as we could get\ntogether, he came up, he had one score of \u201cThe Bartered Bride,\u201d as a very popular Czech\nopera, and started to study with us. The singers had nothing to look at. There was no\nwritten music, there were no way of copying, and no time to copy, and not enough\nqualified people to copy music. So we learned by rote.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: First there was a harmonium in -- there was a -- there were certain defi -- different de --\nwork details, one of them was movers who have moved heavy loads, really where they\nwere needed, when on the town square, the tents and the barracks weren\u2019t up, where more\nindustry roo -- projects were [indecipherable] production was kept. So these people were\ncarrying, then loading the trucks with the stuff that was assembled. And they were also\nmoving the German -- for the Germans when they -- when some was called off, and the\nnew officer came, the SS or so. He was mo -- they were moving their furniture and the\nluggage, and so. And they discovered somewhere in the room, a old harmonium. So one\nnight they, when it was dark, no moon, they brought the harmonium to that basement.\nAnd first we were playing -- Schacter was playing the harmonium, and then they found a\npiano without legs, and also brought it in, and the carpenters made some legs. Until they\nmade the legs and fastened them, the piano was standing on three crates.",

You were not allowed to look at the guy next to you, or even at the girl\nnext to you. You were not allowed to whisper. You had to focus on his eyes, because he\nwas conducting with his eyes, the hands on the -- on the keys, and his eyes were directing\nthe music. And if he noticed you did -- you\u2019re not attentive, if -- once he yelled at you,\nthe second time he threw you out.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And -- and --",

        "A: Yeah, for the choir, yes.",
        "A: Yeah, he -- he -- he makes sure you -- he had the unlimited amount of people were\ncoming to him, who wanted to participate.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how many were doing these individual opera performances, but I know for\nthe Requiem there were 150. He started another Czech opera, and then when German\nJews came, and these were -- the German Jews they were not -- there were very few\nyoung people, very few. Very few young middle class, these were older, upper middle\nclass, and then the -- the prominent ones, the old ones who fought in World War I, with\nwhom the German played a cruel game. They promised them -- or told them, leave\neverything here, your furniture, your money, your belongings, the -- the glass in the\nshowcase. We are bringing you to a spa where you will have no worry. You will have\nmaid service, and room service, and food service, and laundry service. And these guys,\nafter observing three or four or five years, how the Germans treat -- how the Nazis treated\nthe German Jews in Germany, still believed the officer\u2019s word. The -- the reason that they\ncame, at a time when the barracks, and the houses of the town population were already\nfilled, and the only place for them was in the attics of the barracks. They will put straw\nmattresses on the floor, and you can imagine the old people going down to the floor to lay\ndown to sleep, and even worse to get up to sleep. And if you have heard about it, older\npeople have to go to the bathroom more often. So first to get up, and then climb over -- I\nguess these mattresses were one next to the other, to accommodate as many as possible,\nclimb over the people with a dim light, because the light was dim so the rest can sleep.\nAnd go down a flight of stairs, and then still the bathroom was not next to the stairs, still\ngo on. And if they couldn\u2019t hold it, I don\u2019t have to describe you the hygienic and sanitary\nconditions that have developed, which contributed to the acce -- accelerated death rate.\nAnd also, many of them lost will to live. They were de -- they were deceived,\nheartbroken by the German officers and -- to whom they had so much trust. And so many\nsuicides among them, among the old people. And then, as I said, quick deterioration\nthrough lack of sanitation and -- and cleanliness, and that was a very poor sight. But\nSchacter immediately took his Czech Jews, and started to study \u201cMarriage of Figaro,\u201d for\nthe same purpose, to pep up that -- those German prisoners. And \u201cMagic Flute,\u201d and the\nCzech singers were s -- most of the Czechs spoke German, because not only at the -- at\nthe border area, but most Czechs had frequent use for the German language. So German\nwas pretty used among the Czech Jews.",
        "A: Concert versions, yeah -- no, no costumes, no.",
        "A: Just the piano.",
        "A: Just the piano.",
        "A: A window, yeah. And some may have had the -- the -- taken a excessive dose of sleeping\npills, or whatever they still brought with them. They deteriorated a very rapid fa -- rate.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: How did it come about? Now there is a -- a saying going around, and you must have\nheard it, that the Germans picked Theresienstadt as a town to show off with. It wasn\u2019t that\nway. I mentioned it among other things in their hometown, they had to turn in their\nmusical instruments, and some didn\u2019t. And some even had the chutzpah, people who will\nread this may know what that means, had the guts to bring those ins -- smuggle those\ninstruments with 1 -- within those 110 pounds, instead of food and clothing, into Terezin,\nbecause they were so -- such ardent musicians, amateurs and professionals, who loved to\nplay, and because everybody thought it\u2019s going to be over in six months. I spoke about\nthe optimism. When the six months were over, they gave themselves another six months.\nSo they played in attics, and in cellars, to stay in shape for when they come out, they\nshould be in the same performance level as they came in. And although there are no --\nwere no Germans in the ghetto, nothing escaped them, they found out. And now a terrific\nfright and concern gripped everyone in the ghetto, because the Germans -- a few\nGermans kept all these thousands of Jews in check by imposing corrective punishment.\nSo what that means, were two kinds, either right away into the transport, with -- and these\npeople were marked, when they were in the transport, in Auschwitz they know who they\nare, and they select them -- direct them to the appropriate side, punishing side, or the\nsmall fortress. So nobody wanted to involve their wife, parents, children, siblings in such\na punishment, so there was a big concern. The head of the Council of Elders, Edelstein\ntold the camp commander why -- I mean, not in this exact wording, I\u2019m paraphrasing,\nwhy would you punish these few people? Look at the amount of talent you have\naccumulated here, why don\u2019t you think of a program where you can utilize them to show\nthe world how well you treat the Jews? That\u2019s when this idea came into being. It was not\na preconceived idea with the Germans before the ghetto was created. So not only were\nthese Jews not punished, and could retain their instruments, more instruments were\nbrought in from Prague, and before they determined how they are going to do -- show the\nworld how well they treat the Jews, they already divide -- devised a beautification\nprogram in anticipation of that, and a free time activities department was created. And in\nthe frame of this orchestras -- jazz has just come to -- to Europe from United States, so\nwe had a five member -- what is it called? Ghetto swingers. Ghetto swingers jazz team.\nThen there were the two musicians who played in the caf\u00e9. One of them was my cousin,\nthe accordionist, he was a piano and accor -- but there he played the accordion, and one\nwas a violinist. And -- and other of the quartets, and unbelievable, not the Germans, and\nnot the Council of Elders could have imagined what\u2019s getting news there. And not only\nmusic, there were theaters -- there were all the actors from -- from all these towns. The\ntheater, cabaret, those are very popular because they were throwing these verbal darts at\nthe Germans, in Czech language. Maybe some even in German, I don\u2019t know about those.\nAnd this was very uplifting, and very helping in -- in really reducing the anxieties of the\nlife that was destined for us. There were lectures. There were 1240 lectures on different\nsubjects. This is based on the notes from that -- that they found from that free activity --\nfree time activity list, by professors, chemists, biologists, rabbis. Nobody went to the\ntemple, but they went there to listen to the rabbi. And people who had no interest in\nchemistry and so, went to j -- just to get diversification, and -- and getting away from --\nfrom this dread life of ghetto. By the way, they called -- you know, Terezin in German is\nTheresienstadt, and the Nazis told these prominent people they go to Theresienbath,\nwhich is a Theresien spa. I didn\u2019t say it when we were on the subject. So it is an unbe --\nthere was more -- more of these cultural activities per capita than in New York or -- or\nanywhere else, in a day. And people after work went, and they -- they shortened their\nsleeping time, because they were not really strong with the -- with the food they were\ngetting, and I don\u2019t take blame for it. I just did what was -- we had. But it was -- it was\nunbelievable, it -- it was -- it grew like mushrooms after the rain.",
        "A: Again, there were no Germans in the barracks, and the gendarmes were out at -- outside\nat the gate, and this was happening in the cellar after work. I don\u2019t think it was\nclandestine or illegal, it was just unofficial and --",
        "A: That was only after it was decided that that\u2019s a good idea, we\u2019ll take advantage of it, and\nwe divide -- deci -- devise a program that will help them to project them to the world.",
        "A: But I don\u2019t understand, they had occupied all of Europe, America was across the Atlantic,\nwhy would they have to care to show a good report card with good behavior or good\ntreatment of the Jews? I -- that\u2019s what I was thinking about, who -- for whom did they\nneed this? They were the masters of the world.",
        "A: End of \u201942.",
        "A: End of \u201942.",
        "A: When you say that the -- that -- that [indecipherable] was happening before this okay by\nthe Germans. That was still not secret, but was not official.",

        "A: I -- I did, but not too many, because I was -- I -- I f -- I went to cabarets because that was\nreally important to -- you know, when you are -- when you are under the -- somebody\u2019s\nthumb, if you can play a trick on him, makes you happy. So be -- being part of this -- this\nverbal dart throwing gave you even more an uplift than -- than -- than the singing.",

        "A: She piano.",
        "A: That -- that was -- that was also very uplifting. And I think by that time they must have,\nwith these all instruments, have -- one or two additional pianos came in.",

        "A: Yeah, the musicians themselves, Gideon Klein tuned our piano.",
        "A: Yeah, there wasn\u2019t -- not a -- a -- you know, it\u2019s terrible when you get old, don\u2019t get old.\nWhat -- what happens to me is I had a perfect command of the English language without\never learning, just by hearing and reading. And suddenly in the middle of the sentence, a\nword -- a simple, regular conversation word doesn\u2019t come to mind. And it comes up in\nCzech and in German, the only two languages I learned formally.",

        "A: So you were shaving just -- soap -- somehow we had soap, I don\u2019t -- I think there was a\nissue, or issuing of soap. As I told you, I don\u2019t remember many details.",
        "A: So you f -- you use regular soap just so the razor slides better, and I was shaving at that\ntime with a straight razor. I didn\u2019t have a -- there were -- there were these Gillette double\nbladed razors, but I remember I was shaving with a straight razor.",

The\nmajority was -- were Czech speaking people. If they go to the east to Poland, they\u2019ll be\namong Polish people. They don\u2019t know how they will be received, how they will be, how\ntheir life will be with them, where they are the dominant part of the population.

We found out it\u2019s the international Red Cross, everybody was happy.\nNow, the international Red Cross, they will force them to make it real, a proper, a good\nand beneficial stay here. Give all of us to have a beneficial stay. So it was designated\nwhich way they will led -- be led, on that -- that was the main street between the square\nand the -- and the church. The barracks and tents, where the war industrial production\nwas taking place was all taken down. The girls from the agriculture planted lawn and --\nand flower beds on that square.

        "A: Yeah, yeah.",

They put\nthe -- the clothing that was in that warehouse was suddenly put out, put on coat -- a co --\ncoat hangars, and exposed and exhibited in that store, and the shoes, too. And that was\nthat -- the only benefit of that money. You could buy for the -- get the money, because\nafter three years, your shoes wear, and your clothes wear, you have not much to change.\nSo that was a benefit. There was a grocery store, and they were selling there mustard and\nrelish. I don\u2019t know, the Germans must have had a -- a surplus of those two items. But it\nwas a good -- good to -- to vary a taste of your slice of bread that you got.",
        "A: Those who worked.",

And so -- and some was stolen by the people who\nworked in that Terezin Post Office, other Jews. That\u2019s the dark side of the prisoners.

        "A: For some reason, in January \u00b043, the last transport was sent away, and here we are in\nJuly, and no transports since January. I have no idea why. Everybody was up and happy,\nthat this is the end of deportations. So he also had got the courage to start to implement\nwhat he was thinking the Requiem, knowing, or at least anticipating that this choir will\nstay together. There was a huge uproar when he came up with that idea. All the scholars\nand professors, and the -- and the bor -- the borders -- the -- the elder -- the -- the Council\nof Elders, they all protested for different reasons. The -- the scholars and the rabbis, why\nwould you as Jews in a Jewish ghetto perform a Catholic mass for the dead, when there\nare comparable works on Jewish themes? [indecipherable] and so, which cannot be\nperformed in -- anywhere in occupied Europe, and this is the only place you could. He\ndid not give in to this. He didn\u2019t say it openly because it was dangerous to say, but I\nknow that he -- his mind was on being -- wanting to be able to sing to the Germans in\nLatin what he couldn\u2019t tell them in German to their face. Like the -- the [indecipherable]\nthe day of wrath, the [indecipherable] that it -- 1-in this book, the names of all the sinners\nare inscribed, and none will escape the punishment. So this -- there were about three or\nfour such occasions. And this is what drove him to get it out of him, and be able, even for\ndistance, in the absentia, to tell the Germans.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: No, yeah, they were not there.",
        "A: And the Council of Elders thought, if the Germans find out the intentions behind this\nperformance, that will really be dangerous for the singers and for him, and maybe even\nimplications for the rest of the population. And --",

        "A: Is another oil truck coming 1n?\nEnd of Tape #7\nTape #8",
        "A: Really upset.",
        "A: That was the driving thought behind --",
        "A: Yeah. This friend of mine, the lawyer, meanwhile was deported, and we found in a attic\nof a house in the a backyard of one of those private houses, that must have been a\nmother-in-law arrangement, and the stairs up to the attic, and with a carpenter connection\nagain, we got a -- a little separation, and we had a room with privacy for the two of us.\nAnd so I was pretty much informed about him, his lifestyle, his thoughts, and his\ndetermination. And --",
        "A: Through the choir --",
        "A: -- we met, and for -- for some reasons, including that I provided some more food for him,\nwe ca -- we came close.",
        "A: I still mention, I don\u2019t have any complexes that he would have found in me a -- a level\ncompanion, cause I was a young guy, and his circle were the musi -- social circle were\nthe musicians, the composers, and he had other interests. But we were very close, and\nvery good, and --",
        "A: He was born 1905, so it was about 19 years.",
        "A: Yeah. Not a -- not a lot. We were both --",
        "A: -- during the day we were both working, and then -- he then became part of that free time\ndepartment. And I think his assignment, his job was working within this department so he\ndidn\u2019t have to go somewhere to a -- I don\u2019t know stone quarry, or whatever he worked in\nin that. So that was his day job. And then in the evening, after everybody finished, they\ncame for rehearsal.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And he said why, that we can\u2019t tell them in German, and I -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it has to come\nout, and this is one way I can get it out. And when he was told about all the dangers, he\ntold everyone in the choir, \u201cIt is assumed to be dangerous to you, to us, to the rest of the\ninmates here. So if you don\u2019t want to be part of it, I don\u2019t feel bad if you leave.\u201d Nobody\nleft.",
        "A: That if they find out that he -- that the purpose of this was to tell them, you bastards, you\ngoing to get it at one point, that they will not appreciate it.",
        "A: Yes, so this -- this part we ignored.",
        "A: And -- yeah, ignored as a -- as a thought --",
        "A: -- that propelled us to do it.",
        "A: And in saying the -- the Libera me, was interpreted as set me free from here.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: No, I just felt I\u2019m part of a group that despises the Germans and the Nazis, and that this 1s\nthe best we can do to get even with them within our capabilities.",
        "A: It was, because it was a different language, and it was much more difficult music.",
        "A: And much more concentration was required. And some people who didn\u2019t work in the\nkitchen, were not so well-fed to really dedicate themselves to such a -- that was a hard --",
        "A: -- work on a half empty stomach.",
        "A: Yeah. So with the fact that there were no transports, he was encouraged that he\u2019 ll have an\neasy job, as easy as this can be. Th -- I am sure Toscanini would have never undertaken it\nwith -- with well-fed people, to teach them without a score. So it took six weeks -- we\nwere six weeks into the rehearsal when the rumors sprung up the transports will resume.\nSo every time a transport 1s put together, people from different sectors are involved. And\nso the choir members anticipated that some of them will definitely be included in the\ntransport. So they pushed him to make one performance for them, for their hard work, so\nthey can enjoy performing it. And he would not, because it wasn\u2019t up to his standards yet.\nBut then it became known that by September six, 5,000 people will be deported. He\ncouldn\u2019t resist, because he knew a lot of them will be in it, and he made a performance\nfor them and their families and friends, not the o -- open, public sh -- performance.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And the irony with this, the sad irony, that these 5,000 people -- about -- he lost about\nhalf the choir, and these people went to Auschwitz and they came there, and they were\ntreated differently than anybody else who came before them and after them. They could\nretain their clothes, they could retain their luggage, and they went into a camp which was\nfrom then on called the family camp. They lived together, not in privacy, but families\nwere together. And they were there for six months, and they were not working, they did\nnot -- and this Freddie Hirsch, he took care of the kids, entertained them and taught them.\nAls -- also made sport with them, and art, and he really took care of the kids. And this\ngroup was held there while the Germans were negotiating with the allies in exchange of\nthe German prisoners of war for these Jews, and also some war material. They wanted\nsome trucks, and -- and of course the allies wouldn\u2019t give the Germans another few\nthousand soldiers that will then turn against them, and trucks that they will use in the war\nagainst them. So when the negotiations fell through, in one night, all of those who were\nstill alive from the 5,000 went into the gas. Was exactly three months -- six months later,\non March eight. And this is also -- on March seventh is the -- was Masaryks\u2019 birthday,\nPresident Masaryk, the first -- the creator of Czechoslovakia. So could be that had\nsomething to do with it, because they were -- they were planning the -- timing some\nthings to coincide with some -- something that gives you a bigger -- a ce -- bor -- bigger\npain.",
        "A: No, hadn\u2019t --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Not that I knew, but those people who put together the transport list had some kind of\ndirectives whom to leave out, as long as it was possible.",
        "A: There was a department, it was called evidence. Evidence is where all the files about\nevery single one who came into Terezin was kept. A card with a name, with a transport,\ndate of birth, a transport when they came in, and -- and also the transporting date when\nthey left Terezin. I did after the war search, y -- my parents survived, in spite of\nSchliesser being sent to Auschwitz, and myself, my parents survived. I thought the easiest\nthing would have been if he had written on top of the card -- of their card, do not deport\nit, initial it, that would have been the easiest. I got copies of those cards, there\u2019s nothing\nthere, and I was researching how he did it, because he must have done it, because it\u2019s\ninconceivable that two, old, useless people would stay there, especially before the Red\nCross came, they deported a lot of old people, they wanted only -- they wanted the Red\nCross only to see young, good looking people.",
        "A: So the -- the staff in that office --",
        "A: -- did it.",
        "A: The head of the Council of Elders had to sign the transport list.",
        "A: And then later we get to why he was -- and the whole Council of Elders was sent away.\nHe must have found out where they go, and what\u2019s happening, and their destination, and\nhe refused to sign it. He told the camp commander, you sign it. So he, the camp\ncommander, must have guessed that he knows what\u2019s happening, and didn\u2019t want the\nword to be spread among the inmates because a panic would be created. So the whole\ncouncil left. But even though in September six, and the -- half the choir left, and they\nhave -- they have -- he has recruited new people and started the whole thing from the\nbeginning with them. And he lost one more time, less people, and recruited new and\nstarted a third time with new people. And then in January \u201944 was the first performance.",
        "A: No.",

        "A: And a crappy piano on top of it. How did they bring out all these -- these impressions,\nthese results [indecipherable] of -- that the orchestra can provide.",
        "A: No, bu -- there -- during the rehearsal he played the piano, and do -- and during -- in the\nperformance, Gideon Klein played.",

        "A: Wrong?",
        "A: In the concert?",
        "A: I\u2019m sure it did, but everybody was so grateful for it that -- that either they didn\u2019t notice,\ndidn\u2019t want to notice, didn\u2019t make an impact on them, they were happy to -- to be part of\nit whether active or passive.",
        "A: 15, yeah.",
        "A: And each time with less singers.",
        "A: Only three times. Only three times he started to -- with new people. And then after the\n15\", he was left with 60 singers.",
        "A: And not the same amount in each voice.",
        "A: So he didn\u2019t want it. But then came the order from camp commander, that he wants a\nperformance of the Requiem for high SS officials who came from Vienna and Prague,\nfrom Berlin, to shake the hands of the Red Cross people who were also invited -- no\nJews.",
        "A: Rahm, yeah. And you know they had to pay homage to the Red Cross [indecipherable]\nand so now, I didn\u2019t know -- he didn\u2019t want to do it with the -- with the regular choir, but\nit was an opportunity he was dreaming of. Not only can he sing it to them for distance,\nbut he has them right in front of him, they are sitting there, and he can really tell them.\nAnd the paradox again is, that we all thought -- we told him, and the Germans were the\nonly ones who knew that we were actually singing our own Requiem. You know, they\nknew where we will end up. They didn\u2019t think that there would be some survivors. So\nthat was a mutual giving it to each other.",
        "A: I think -- I\u2019m sure, yeah. But I think they -- they thought it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a musical\nperformance, and -- but they also understood the meaning of it, and what\u2019s going to\nhappen with us, that this 1s --",
        "A: Our own eulogy. The -- when this Red Cross came, I couldn\u2019t understand that they accept\nthe German conditions that they will not interview people at random on the street, only\nspecial auditioned people that the Germans prepared to meet them. And they knew that\nthey\u2019re saying lies, but it was again against the threat of the whole family being\nendangered if they refuse. So they did it. But I don\u2019t -- still don\u2019t understand, if you were\npsychologist, rather than philosophy doctor, I would ask you, how is it possible to\naudition, and indoctrinate little kids to the same performance? When they came to the\nplayground, and there were some kids who never been on a playground because they\nwere not allowed at home to go, the little ones. When they came for the chocolate bar that\nwas on the table in front of the playground, the only one uniform was Rahm, and they\nhad to address him uncle, and they, \u201cUncle Rahm, again chocolate?\u201d As if they were\nalready fed up with chocolate, and there were some kids who never knew what chocolate\nwas because it wasn\u2019t on their ration tickets at home. This I don\u2019t understand, how they\ngot the kids to do that. Maybe they told them you\u2019re going to play a theater or whatever.\nBut this were tough for me to understand.",

        "A: -- not, I didn\u2019t --",

And the agriculture\nworkers, and my wife among them, dressed in shorts, and nice blouse, marching by with\nthe rake, or the -- the -- the spade over the shoulder, singing happy songs going to work.\nAnd the orchestra was playing in that pavilion on the -- on the sta -- on the town square.\nIt was a real happy town. This doesn\u2019t belong to my li -- yeah, I hear the party. After the\nwar, in -- in Newton was a Harvard philosophy psychology professor who researched to\nwrite a book about the Red Cross, International Red Cross at that time, what they should\nhave done and didn\u2019t do, and they shouldn\u2019t have done and did do. And he was\nresearching it, and I knew about it because I was translating his papers that he brought\nfrom Germany, from Austria, even the French. And at one point he told me he had an\nappointment with the then president of the International Red Cross, Dr. Rossler. In his\noffice, in his factory -- he had aluminum, a huge aluminum factory in Switzerland, and he\ncame there, and the secretary says, \u201cOh, Dr. Rossler called, he apologizes, he\u2019 be an\nhour, hour and a half late from another appointment. Make yourself comfortable in the\nlibrary.\u201d Brought in cup of coffee, said [indecipherable] whatever. And he perused -- and\nhe found documents that he had branch factories in Austria and in Germany where he\nused prisoners from concentration camp.

        "A: Yeah, informal.",
        "A: No, but Schacter taught me. He started to teach me to play the piano, then I started to\nread music. And unfortunately, it didn\u2019t go for very long, and after the war I had no\nchance to resume. I had to work to maintain my parents and myself because we had\nnothing except what they had left from the 110 pounds. I had nothing, coming from\nAuschwitz.

He brought in the SS uniform\nand took him out on a motorcycle from Auschwitz. And he came to Prague -- to Terezin,\nand he spoke with Edelstein, and told him about what\u2019s happening, and nobody would\nbelieve him. This is impossible, it is -- it\u2019s unthinkable. But then there were some other --\nfor instance, those people who were helping load or unload the -- the dep-deportees\nnoticed on the wagons that the -- always the same ones were coming back, you know,\nthey are numbered, coded, numbered. And so one of them knew there is somewhere a\nboard loose behind the frame of the -- of that little window that\u2019s up there, the barred\nwindow. He said, when you arrive, look where, and write it down, and put it in there,\nunder that trimming. And it came back Auschwitz but the person could not describe\nanything back -- because when you come to Auschwitz, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s\nhappening, you know -- know you\u2019re getting a rougher treatment right away, but you\nhave no idea.

And they say 15. He said, \u201cYou are 18.\u201d Without explaining why he said it, and\nwhere they should use it, and was also a man -- well, there were several men supporting\nthemselves on a cane, and the same guy told them, don\u2019t come out with a cane, leave the\ncane here. Also, not saying why, so I\u2019m sure the guy didn\u2019t listen, if he needed a cane to\nsupport themself. And we were put on five abreast lined up, the whole contingent. And\nwe were moving forward, and you can -- forward I saw two SS uniformed men with\nwhite gloves. And when my -- when I was in the first row, they went to the -- through the\nfive, and he just looked at me and waved me to one side. And the boys were next to me,\nhe asked them, \u201cHow old are you?\u201d Now it lit up in their head, and they said 18, and it\nwas their luck because he send them to the good side. So then we were -- when there\nwere enough people together, we were marched along a -- those barbed wire fences. And\nthere was a guard, a SS with a rifle over his shoulder walking at [indecipherable], and I\nnaively asked him, \u201cWhat are those chimneys?\u201d They\u2019re not only smoke coming out, also\nsparks, and flames.

        "A: And until we met some veterans, didn\u2019t find out what this -- these chimneys are. We were\nbrought to a huge hall, with nothing in except benches around, and pegs on the wall. And\nthe pegs were numbered, and we were told to take everything off and hang it on a peg,\nand remember the number, so you can get back to your clothes. Till the last moment were\ndeceptions. And everything you have in your pocket, throw -- there\u2019s a blanket on the\nground, throw out everything.",
        "A: SS.",
        "A: These were SS people. Throw everything down. And don\u2019t let us find anything on you,\nyou'll get severely punished. Then we were shaved, every hair on our body, and with me\nthey had a lot of work because top of my head to the big toe, I\u2019m hairy. And --",
        "A: All of the body, and then they did it with -- they never changed the blade, that was dull,\nthey were pulling the hair, and ripping the skin, and after that, we were washed down\nwith some disinfectant that burned in those scratches. And then we were brought into\nshower. Hot water, nice showering, after three days in fil -- filth. There was no food the\nthree days, and we still were not eating before the shower. And from there, not coming\nback to the peg, but another door, they chased us out, naked and wet from a hot shower in\nthe cold, wintry night, to another barrack, and then we\u2019re marching along a counter,\nbehind which some prisoners were sitting and throwing at us a pair of pants, a jacket, and\na pair of boots. And the hat to take off -- not a hat, a cap to take off when you meet an SS\nman, it was for no other reason there. And those -- that clothing was without regard to our\nsize. So it was up to us then to exchange it so it fits. And we were brought to a barrack,\nand I\u2019ve no idea where I was in Birkenau, I couldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t identify where we were.\nBut the kids were with me, the two, and we were not working while we were in\nAuschwitz, in Birkenau. During the day we were just in front of the barracks, hanging\naround, loitering they call it. And [indecipherable] we went for the soup and the bread.\nBut every other day, or sometimes every day, and sometimes over three days break,\npeople came to look for workers in their factories. Civilians accompanied by an officer.\nAnd we wanted to get away from those chimneys, so whatever, whoever they were\nlooking for, we applied or [indecipherable] and we got away to a welding job, they were\nlooking for welders. There were 350 of us, and at that point, when we were accepted to\nbecome welders, they started to tattoo us, the numbers.",

        "A: Yeah. And now if you were psychology PhD, I would ask you a question, but I have to\nlive without the answer to that. There were three guys doing the tattooing, and I was at\nthe edge of my life, or edge of death, or whatever you call it in Auschwitz, and I went to\nsee which one does it the nicest way. And in that line I lined up. I\u2019ve seen guys with, you\nknow, irregular numbers, b-big ones, small ones, sideways and so. I wanted to have it\nneat.",
        "A: I can show you this, and it\u2019s very regular and neat. It has to be read this way, I don\u2019t\nknow why they didn\u2019t do it here.",

        "A: Yeah.",

It was the same cattle wagon, and we were going\nto Gleiwitz, which is nearby, and it also took longer than it should have taken because the\nmilitary transports had priority on the track. That\u2019s why it took three days to go to\nAuschwitz, a trip that shouldn\u2019t have taken longer than five, six hours.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, I think so.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: You mean the crematorium -- yeah.",
        "A: From Gleiwitz we marched through the streets, into the camp, there\u2019s a huge camp. And\nthe whole camp was -- all inmates in that camp were working in a -- a railroad repair\nshop that was fixing wagons that were damaged by the Royal Air Force on the way to the\nfront. So with my experience, I did get a -- a cutting torch, at the gate, cutting off all the\ndamaged parts of the wagon, and then the wagon went further on to be -- to -- to parts to\nbe measured, and re-install the good parts. And the job had a good side and a bad one.\nEverything 1n life, I guess, has a good and a bad side. The good one was when a wagon\nwith garbage came in, I had the first pick. The bad part was that was in the open gate, and\nwe had nothing, we had no underwear, no socks, just those cotton pants and the -- and the\njacket. And -- very cold. My meister was a -- a Pole -- a German Pole, or a Polish\nGerman. A Pole of German nationality. He wasn\u2019t especially good, but he was one of\nthose who was afraid to be good. He wasn\u2019t -- he wasn\u2019t very bad, but y -- we worked 12\nhour shifts, six days a week, one week day, one week night. And when we went to work\nthere was music in Gleiwitz, and when we came back was music.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Next to the gate, standing --",
        "A: -- the musicians were standing next to the gate as we came 1n, and if we didn\u2019t march in\nproper step, we were helped by a kick to improve the step. Big guys like me deteriorated\nin Auschwitz much faster than the little skinny ones. I guess our body required more than\nthey were offering, and a lot of pussyboils presented themselves on my back. And the pus\nrubbed off on the jacket, and when it dried, it rubbed back into the wounds. I also had\nsome that were not opened, were -- the skin didn\u2019t break and the pus was pushing, and it\nwas terrible pressure, and they were very painful. And I didn\u2019t want to go to the infirmary\nbecause the Germans didn\u2019t like sick Jews, they liked them less than the healthy Jews. So\n-- but it became unbearable, so I went. And there was a French doctor, I don\u2019t know\nwhether he was a doctor, or just filled the position of a doctor -- a -- a prisoner, and he --\nfor anesthesia he put me down on a table face down, and for anesthesia he used three\nguys, two sitting each on one of my arms, and one sitting on my legs, and he proceeded\nto open those closed -- it was a split second unpleasant, but there was immediate relief,\nthe pressure was gone. So you bite your teeth together, and -- and I went immediately\nback. There was no -- no bandage, no stitches, no nothing, just cut open, relief, and I\nwent back to the barracks, and next shift I went to work.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Welding, no, cutting with a torch. I\u2019m not -- welding is putting things together, I was --",
        "A: Each one, yeah. In -- one in the carpentry shop, he -- because one worked in -- in Terezin\nin the carpentry shop, cause 15 and older had to work, and one of them was carrying the\nplumber\u2019s toolbox. So -- and they found similar jobs. Whether they said what they did\nbefore, what their experience was -- I couldn\u2019t say what my experience was. And that\nsecond cook was in that same transport, and he came also to Auschwitz into Gleiwitz\nfrom the same camp.",
        "A: Yeah. And so one day on the way home -- there was nothing -- I went -- we went full to\ne-elaborate on that job, other than only once in those 12 hours you were allowed to go to\nthe bathroom. They took your number down, and if you came again, they kicked you out.\nThe guy who was there was called scheiss meister. [indecipherable] to spell it.",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t know what people did who had diarrhea, but there must have been people with\ndiarrhea. I have no idea. Th -- one day was really, really sick, tired and -- and I -- I really\ncouldn\u2019t perform. So I found a place, and with these radiators with the ribs, you know?\nThere was one that allowed a little space between the wall and itself. I leaned down\nbehind it, and there was nice, warm, and I fell asleep. It wasn\u2019t difficult for me to fall\nasleep until ve been awakened with a -- a rifle butt by an SS man. I think the -- the --\nmy meister must have told the guard that his helper is missing. So he found me. I\u2019m glad\nI\u2019m not bald because I have a very ugly protrusion still, on my head. And so he kicked\nme in the behind and sent me back to work. I was lucky he didn\u2019t deport me. So I did my\nwork again, you know, you get this kind of encouragement with a boot, you continue to\nwork. One day after the shift, we go back to camp, there was a snow on the floor -- on the\nground. And I had wooden shoes, those Dutch wooden clogs, that was the only shoes that\nfitted me, that I got exchange. They were good -- a good and the bad side. The good was\nit insulated from the cold of the ground, but uncomfortable because they were not\nflexible. Walking back to the camp, I see ahead of me a huge -- only maybe it just\nseemed that -- that huge to me, onion on the edge -- on the side of the road. So I look\nback where the guard 1s, and told the guy behind me, step a little bit out of formation,\ncover me. And I bent down, and picked it up and put it in the jacket to take it to camp,\nbecause whatever either one of the three of us found, stole, or otherwise, we shared. So I\ntook it in to share it with them. And we were brought in and lined up on the roll call area\nfor frisking. We were frisked on -- infreque -- not infrequently like little, but\nunannounced because we were working with tools, and we could have made some\nweapon, a knife, or -- or something which the Germans did not like very much. So what\ndo I do with the onion? If I throw it away and don\u2019t say it was me, everybody gets\npunished, the old theme of collective punishment. If I say it was me, they beat me to a\npulp because they won\u2019t believe I found it, they will think I stole -- they will insist I stole\nit. Only one way out, to eat the onion, quickly. This is with the peel and with those little\nroots on it. The eyes were -- tears were coming down my cheeks, and the nose was\nrunning, and sweat in that cold, wintry day, sweat was coming up on my forehead. And\nwhen he ca -- I finished it before he came to me, and I didn\u2019t dare to breathe while he was\nfrisking me. And why I am saying it 1s a day or -- or t -- the next day or the day after,\nthese wounds started to get smaller and less pus-y.",
        "A: The one onion did a marvelous job. But it was only one, and we continued days and\nweeks without another onion, so it opened up again, and the -- the pus-y routine has\nreappeared. But it gave me enough respect for onions that I am consuming an awful lot of\nthem, cooked or raw. And recommending it to everybody. I don\u2019t remember much of\nhappenings inside the camp. This other cook, second cook from Prague, he had the\nchutzpah on a -- in -- on the -- on the road in the camp, to stop the camp commander, who\nwas as.o.b. you can say, no? That\u2019s in public. He was the -- previously the commander of\nthe crematorium and the gas chambers in Auschwitz. And here was the lager\nkommandant, always walking with a dog.",
        "A: Yeah, Moll. And he stopped him, he said, \u201cHerr Kommandant, I would like to work in\nmy profession.\u201d And he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s your profession?\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m a cook.\u201d He said,\n\u201cDid you tell 1t when you came into this camp?\u201d He said, \u201cYes.\u201d So next Sunday on the\nroll call, they pull him out and put him into the SS kitchen. I wouldn\u2019t have dared to say\nI\u2019m a cook when I said I\u2019m a welder. I thought, you know -- anyway, he -- I never --\nalready the oldtimers in the kitchen, the veterans, they wouldn\u2019t let him anywhere near,\nand he has to wash dishes, the floor, the tables, just the dirty work. And one afternoon\nthere was some mashed potatoes left from the SS menu, and he made like a decorating\nbag out of paper, and made some decorations like for a cake. And the SS in charge of the\nSS kitchen was a baker, or a -- a -- call 1t baker patisserie, or the fine -- fine baker, you\nknow, the -- how do you call it?",
        "A: Pastry chef. What would I do without you? Couldn\u2019t complete the interview. He saw this,\n\u201cWho made this?\u201d And he said, \u201cI did.\u201d \u201cYou did?\u201d He immediately made him the\nproviant meister, which was in the storeroom, giving out to the cooks the -- the food, the -\n- the -- the items to cook. So he had everything, he was in there alone, no other veteran --\nprior veteran. He took care of everyone from Terezin he knew. He saved my life.",
        "A: At 4:30 in the morning, behind the barracks, we crawled to that SS kitchen -- and several\npeople, and he threw at us a -- a boiled potato unpeeled, or a piece of bread, or whatever\nwas left over. And when I was at night shift and couldn\u2019t come to the kitchen, he left me\nsome food on the beam in the latrine. Not a very aesthetic place, but who cares? And all\nthese things, whatever he sa -- left there we -- the three of us shared. And I don\u2019t think I\nwould have made it without him. And so now again, nothing extraordinary. I was lucky, I\nwas never present at -- when there was some hangings, or when somebody got 25 or 40\nlashes. I never -- when I -- when we stood in the roll call place, I bent my knees not to\nstick out, because I was tall. Cause they -- the tall ones and those who were in some way\ndifferent than the rest, they pulled out for the nice jobs like cleaning latrines, and so -- so\nyou learn how to survive.",
        "A: It was January already.",
        "A: And we did hear faint explosions like bombs and so. And one day at n -- noon -- before\nnoon -- before noon at the factory, over the loudspeaker came an announcement, all\nprisoners assemble where we usually assemble after the shift to go back. And there was\nnot much talking. They counted us and marched us back to the camp. No music was\nplaying. Lined up on the roll call area. After awhile we were sent to the block -- to have -\n- to enjoy our own luxury, each one had a blanket. We brought our blanket and it was a\ngodsend because we could wrap it around and be a little less cold. And soon thereafter we\nwere marched out. That was already afternoon, again without music, and that was the\nbeginning of what they call a death march today. With the kids on my side, we are\ntogether. And there were no more kids, they were already adults, you know, this kind of a\ncircumstance matures a person quickly. And --",
        "A: The shoes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And so we marched until late at night, and we came to an already abandoned camp,\nevacuated -- another evacuated labor camp. So we were herded in, and right went into the\nbunk and fell asleep. There was no food, no drink. We were able to pick up some of the\ndirty snow from the road. And early morning I was -- it was not -- before dawn, they\nwoke us up, and the Germans insisted that we go as quickly as possible. Now, we noticed\nwhoever fell, couldn\u2019t make it, was shot on the road. On the first day with one of the kids,\nwe were supporting one who couldn\u2019t road -- couldn\u2019t walk any more, you know, the\nshoulder, and under the arm. And we could do it as -- as long as he could move his feet --\nhis legs forward. But then he became totally heavy, we had a dead weight, and we\nourselves were already weak. So we just couldn\u2019t continue to drag him, and then when\nwe heard the shot it was like -- it felt like I was shot, you know, the -- the guy -- I felt\nguilty that time, I felt guilty that I didn\u2019t try more. But it wouldn\u2019t have helped, I could\nhave only weakened myself, and wouldn\u2019t have helped him.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. And then the next day after this camp, we were marched again, there was no food,\nno drink. Continued with the dirty snow, and at late at night again, we came to a barn. We\nwere herded in, the -- they -- they closed the barn. And that was nice because there was\nsomething, we didn\u2019t recognize it in the dark, hay or straw. We crawled in and had a\nwarm, soft sleep. On that day my -- on top of the shoe where the laces are -- there are no\nlaces on the wooden, but on where on other shoes are the laces, a little triangular piece\nbroke out, and two sharp corners were digging into my foot. And that was very\nunpleasant. I don\u2019t know where and how I found a piece of wax cloth, I think in that barn\nor around it, and I wrapped my feet into that, and that\u2019s like McDonald uses this\ncheckered tablecloth?",
        "A: That kind of material. It did not insulate me any more from the cold, but it didn\u2019t hurt like\nthe -- that shoe. But early in the morning on the third day I felt -- I -- I will be one of\nthose shot on the road. I am weak, tired, tough trying to drag my feet. And the kids were\nin -- in fairly good shape, because I mentioned the smaller ones and skinny one tolerated\nit better. So I said, if I stay here, I get shot. I try to escape. Whatever chance I have, I will\ntake it. If it\u2019s 10 percent, I'll take 10 percent of success to escape. And so I told them,\nstay together and help each other if you need to, and I can\u2019t any more, and I have no use\nto you anyway. So we come to a forest, tall forest on both sides of the road, no moon, real\ndark. So that was the moment. I slipped to -- into the ditch on the side of the road. I don\u2019t\nknow why I didn\u2019t encourage the kids to do it too, but I felt I don\u2019t want to be responsible\nin case -- you know, to suggest something where they may suffer. And I laid down in the\nsnow, face down. And there was -- must have been a zealous guard who shot me. And\nwhether it was the dark, or whether it was frozen fingers, I don\u2019t know. He shot me under\nthe arm, and the bullet got stuck in the rib. And the snow -- the -- the blood was color --\nstarting to color the snow, and that was good, because nobody else attempted a second\nshot, that the guy must have had it, you know, but -- so when the column past, I suddenly\nhad strength to pick myself up, and went into the forest, and found like minded people,\nother prisoners who escaped, having been lucky, not getting shot. So we huddled together\nand used the blanket in ma -- outside in -- in January in the forest with this -- just a cotton\nuniform, and I think we all slept, sitting, holding each other. And in the morning we went\nto the edge of the forest, that the road we came from, looking whether we find a sign\nwhere we are, what\u2019s happening. And we see the top of the hill another camp. The gate is\nOpen, no guard in the watch tower, and prisoners walking in and out. So inside the forest\nwe ran -- suddenly we could not only walk, we could run, near to that camp, and we\nasked one of the prisoners, \u201cWell what -- well what is this?\u201d He said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, but\nbefore dawn, all the Germans jumped into car -- into the trucks and took off.\u2019 Didn\u2019t\neven take the time to liquidate the camp, with machine guns, and -- and hand grenades.\nSo what really happened, in that area, a Russian tank force cut a wedge into the German\nfront. And of course they didn\u2019t want to be caught by the Russians, so they jumped in the\ntrucks and left in a hurry. We -- I went into the camp, and saw guys from our camp. I\nsaid, \u201cWhere were you located?\u201d Sort of the last block, because that was the last group\nthat arrived there. And I found the two kids there, and we started to look for food, but we\ndidn\u2019t find any, because those who were there already, they plundered the -- the -- the\npotato storage, and all -- all other storages. But somebody told us there\u2019s, on the side the\nroad, 1s a abandoned village where the German population ran the same way as the SS,\nand there\u2019s food in their pantries. So we went there, not far, and there\u2019s food. Everything\nexcept bread. They must have taken the loaf and bread and ran. The speed at which they\nran wa -- showed itself. That was unfinished food, even unfinished food on the table, and\nthe rest was burned in the oven, or on top of the range. So we had food, and there was no\n-- at that time there was no refrigeration in Europe [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know, a few\npeople may have had a refrigerator, and -- we want to break --",
        "A: -- at the refrigerator, okay.\nEnd of Tape #10\nTape #11",
        "A: I -- after I picked myself up from the ground, I was pr-pressing my arm against the\nwound, and lo and behold, among those in the forest was the French doctor.",
        "A: The French doctor from -- that operated on my back.",
        "A: No. And anybody who has some function in a concentration camp has different degrees\nof privileges according to the degree of the function. And it must have been his privilege\nto have a pocket knife, which we were not allowed to have. And people see that around\nthis time without other guys, just with snow as a somewhat numbing agent, and he had to\nmake another hole because the bullet was away from where it entered. And he pulled it\nout, wriggling and wiggling. And I continued to do the same thing, holding my arm\nagainst the body until the blood dried, and -- and later on I started to take advantage of\nmy profession, and -- by feeding myself, I gained enough healing power that it healed\nwithout bandages, without stitches.",
        "A: There was no -- there wa -- there was no doctor --",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Okay, now we stopped before the bullet -- or that was after the bullet --",
        "A: We stopped in that village, and I mentioned there were no refrigerators used. If this is a\nkosher tape I can\u2019t mention it. People were -- had all kinds of preservation methods of\nfood without refrigerator. So the first thing I found was a -- like a gallon jug glass jar,\nwith roasted pork, covered with rendered lard, which prevents the -- the oxygen reaching\nthe meat, and the meat therefore, does not spoil. And after months of Auschwitz diet, and\nthree days absolutely nothing, I dug into that lard, and ate it like that. No bread, no\nnothing. And I still don\u2019t understand that this didn\u2019t kill me faster than -- than the\nAuschwitz diet. But it had a effec -- had it\u2019s effects. This was a huge place, the -- that\ncamp was called Blechhammer, and it was part of a huge industrial complex. All the\ncamp inmates were working in it -- of forced laborers from occupied countries were\nthere, and POW\u2019s were also there, and were working. We found the camp of the British\nprisoners of war, and for some reason -- they were bombing London, but for some reason\nthey were treating the British POW\u2019s very well. We found in that barrack warm uniforms,\nboots, socks, scarves, caps, coats, and a lot of toilet paper, which saved us from result of\nthe way we were eating. There were 10 of us in -- in one of those barracks, there were\ntwo toilets, one on each end, and that wasn\u2019t enough. So they brought from the village, I\ndon\u2019t know, somewhere, a huge half barrel, like a big whiskey barrel. I put two boards\nacross so four could sit at the same time. That bad it was. I started to improvise cooking,\nand one guy was helping me, and eight did -- the rest of the 10, the eight went to town to\nbring supplies. The one kid I mentioned was working the carpentry shop in Terezin, he\nmade a sled so more stuff could be brought. And there\u2019s one point he brought the whole -\n- took out from one of those houses a kitchen stove, including the pipes. He installed it,\nand then we were really cooking. The Russian soldiers came to eat, to us, because they\ndidn\u2019t get food like that. It was another compliment for the aunt. And we\u2019re cooking till\n10 in the evening, and by 10:15, there wasn\u2019t a bite to be had. That\u2019s how we ate. No --\nno control. And the Russian soldiers told us how wonderful Communism 1s, everybody is\neven, and it\u2019s the best system, until a Jewish officer came, a Russian Jewish officer, said,\n\u201cDon\u2019t believe a word.\u201d We were thinking of Communism, because that\u2019s a -- was\npresented to us as a real equal society, a society of equal people. But he set us straight.\nWe were six weeks in that British barracks, because between where we were, and our\nhome, they were still fighting. You know, from the east front, we were here, and Prague\nwas here, and the Russians were only getting there. So for six weeks we suffered terrible\ndiarrhea. And in spite of it, I gained 79 pounds within six weeks, with my own cooking. I\nsaid -- what\u2019s her name, I fi -- know this -- this diet advertiser, Jenny Craig would have\ngone crazy if she heard that somebody gained 79 pounds in six weeks. And everybody --\nafter six weeks we moved out of there, and went to Katowice -- here come friend of the\nspelling. And they put us up in the schoolhouse where or -- other -- other form of\nprisoners were. And the Polish Red Cross gave us identification papers based on what we\ntold them, because we didn\u2019t have anything to show. But we needed something because\nwe were in the Russian occupied zone, and I don\u2019t know how long we were there. One of\nthe tenant was a chemist, and he found a job in a smoke factory there, to earn some\nmoney. And next day he comes and says, \u201cCome with me, they need a cook in the\nemployees cafeteria, in the manager\u2019s restaurant.\u201d I have absolutely no recollection that I\nworked there, until I read one of the two kids memoirs, where he names the factory. So\nthe name immediately sprang up, and I knew I know it. But even with that knowledge, I\ncould not remember that I worked there. But I must have, because they all told me, and I\nbrought food to the school for them. So -- and I don\u2019 know how long we were there.\nSomehow time is not very noticeable, if you don\u2019t have a calendar, you don\u2019t have a\nroutine, and that responsibility. Okay, and then we picked ourselves up and went home\nby means of freight trains, military trucks, horse-drawn carriages, walking. We were\nalready strengthened -- strong by that time. The day we moved out from that British\nbarrack, the diarrhea stopped like immediately. And our digestive systems started to work\nnormally, cause we didn\u2019t eat like pigs any more. Oh, there was a -- and one story, and\nit\u2019s a funny story, one of the guys came and said down a little past the village 1s a pig\nfarm, and a lot of pigs there, and nobody\u2019s watching them, feeding them. So I found some\n-- a little hammer and a piece of rope, and we said we go down and get ourselves a pig\nwith the sled. And I go there, and there were lots of pigs running around, and they were\nin the building. So I found one, tied a rope to his hind leg, and tied the rope to the -- to\nthat column, the supporting column, and hit him on the head, that\u2019s how you kill pigs.\nBut the hammer was small, and I was not strong enough yet, and when you hit them here,\nit swells up and you can never break his skull any more. So it was screaming there, and\nsuddenly we hear machine gun fire. I -- oh my God, the Germans are back. So we look\nout, and on top of that farm, a Russian column, military column pass by, and one was\nshooting the pigs with a machine gun, and they were throwing them at cars and trucks as\nthey ro -- drove by. And the guy sees me with a knife, and commandeered me to about 12\nor 13 pigs to eviscerate them. They want -- he want only the meat, not the innard. So I did\nthat, and I said, \u201cNow I worked for you, now you come and shoot my pig.\u201d And one of\nthose wanted only the two hind legs, it was a [indecipherable] soldier. So we had one and\na half pig, and a innards from a liver, and the organs from 12 more pigs. I don\u2019t even\nknow how we brought it all on that sled. We were rendering the lard till 10 at night. And\nthere was no worry about refrigeration, it was cold enough. So that -- we consumed all\nthat -- I\u2019m sorry -- okay, we started on our way home from Katowice, and we had to go --\nI told you all the means we went, but I have to turn around to tell you -- to give you the\ndirection. We were here, in Katowice. We went to the Ukraine, to Romania, to Hungary,\nAustria and Prague.",
        "A: Yeah. And in Ukraine was an office of the Joint, and they were giving to Jewish prisoners\nsome onion. But you had to prove that you a Jew, so if you knew a [indecipherable] or\nsomething, a prayer, was fine. If -- some of those who never learned anything, they had to\ntake their pants off to prove they are Jewish. And --",
        "A: That was my question. That was my question and still 1s. So came to lac -- I think two\ndays after, one day or two days after the war officially ended, and right away I went to\nTerezin to see if my parents are there, and they were there.",
        "A: No, 1 -- when something nice happens, you don\u2019t get shocked. I asked Mother, \u201c\u201cWeren\u2019t\nyou worried?\u201d \u201cNo, I knew God wouldn\u2019t do this to me. He will send you back.\u201d Such a\nstrong belief. She didn\u2019t -- it\u2019s [indecipherable] it\u2019s good, I mean a good disposition.",
        "A: Father was worried and he was -- he was very excited to see me back.",
        "A: There was meanwhile a quarantine in Terezin because some of the death marchers wor --\nwere brought near there, from Poland to Mauthausen, either through the Czech territory,\nor right outside, where Terezin was the nearest place, so they brought all these sick\npeople in, including the dead. There was a crematorium in Terezin. They started first,\nwhen few people died, individual graves. My grandmother 1s in an individual grave. Then\nmass graves, without -- without coffins because the Germans wouldn\u2019t supply wood for\nthat. And when that wasn\u2019t enough space for mass -- more mass graves, they built a\ncrematorium, and the bodies were cremated. So I [indecipherable] was a quarantine, and\npeople brought in typhoid, and scarlet fever, and all kind. And I must say, my wife, I\ndon\u2019t know how she did it, they were friends from before, that\u2019s when they started to\nbelieve what happened. Her friends she has from before, one in one place with typhoid,\none with the scarlet fever. This one couldn\u2019t eat, so she took his food to the other one,\nand she never got anything, and was lucky. I went home, and started to look for an\napartment, and there was a -- you know, you couldn\u2019t like here go to someone, to a\nlandlord and rent an apartment. That was all operated by a -- a housing cop -- not a\ncooperation, a state housing office. And they didn\u2019t come Tuesday, come Wednesday,\ncome the afternoon, come day after. I said, \u201cWhat the hell happened? The Jews didn\u2019t\ncome back. The Germans you have expelled, what happened to the apartments?\u201d I was\ntoo di -- naive and dumb to know that he wanted some -- something for the apartment. So\nit took almost two weeks before I lost my patience, and I took a chair and banged it on his\ndesk, the desk collapsed, and I said, \u201cAnd you are next.\u201d The -- \u201cWait, wait, wait, maybe\nwe can find something.\u201d In the afternoon I had a apartment and I was mad at myself that I\nwaited with this -- with this extended patience, that I waited that long, I could have had\nan apartment two weeks before. So then my parents came and -- thought you said you\nwanted this after -- at another time, or just so long -- as long as the tape runs?",
        "A: Yeah. So --",
        "A: I brought the parents from Terezin and now we -- I don\u2019t know where we got some\nfurniture. Maybe the house -- th-the apartment was furnished, I don\u2019t remember the\ndetails. But I took two jobs because I needed to earn enough money for the three of us,\nand provide the things that we did not have after coming back from Terezin. So one job\nwas where I took my apprenticeship, a day job, and then I worked in the evening in a\nrestaurant where they also had the bar. And that -- there I worked at -- at night, and a lot\nof people who returned came to that evening restaurant and to the bar. And in October\n\"46 -- until October \u201946, when I was in inducted into the Czech army as a reserve, in the\nreserves, cause I was older than inducting age, for five months. And somehow, a United\nNations request to the other states was to reduce the military, the numbers in -- of the\npeople in the military. And the easiest -- the Czechs and for others, I guess, was to get rid\nof, was the shortest ones in, because they had not invested a lot of effort into them, and\nthe others were already more valuable by having been trained. So I was let go on the New\nYear\u2019s Eve, 1946. And then I worked in a hotel in Prague. I have a certificate informing\nme and everybody else who wants to look at, that I worked there to their full satisfaction.\nI don\u2019t remember the kitchen, the time that I did work there, the people with whom I\nworked. And it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s an hotel on -- on the Wencel Square. And -- and that\u2019s it, I have\na -- I have a -- a [indecipherable] or certificate that I -- document that I worked there.\nAnyway, in the spring of \u201947, I si --",
        "A: Oh my God, this woman. Yes, I did, some -- meet somebody. I thought she will tell the\nStory.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, one of the friends whom I also met in Terezin after I came back, with a New\nYear\u2019s Eve party in her sister\u2019s apartment, and invited me. I don\u2019t know, I came only\nback from the military, how I found out there is a party, how she got to me, I don\u2019t\nremember that. But I know that I went, and Hana came with somebody, who was another\nfr -- childhood friend, who was much younger than she. A he friend, but not a boyfriend.\nAnd also somebody who came back alone. So they went together, and I don\u2019t -- didn\u2019t\nknow how tough it will be to live with her, but somehow I started a relationship with her.\nAnd I -- I don\u2019t like dancing, but I thought it\u2019s what girl\u2019s like, so I invited her to dance.\nAnd she called the other girl, in whose house we had the party. \u201cEdgar wants us to come -\n- wants you to come to dance.\u201d And she said, \u201cWell why didn\u2019t he call me directly?\u201d She\nsaid, \u201cI don\u2019t know what.\u201d So I was dancing with both of them, and I hate to dance,\nalways did. But I thought it\u2019s -- you know, instead of the other introductory sentences.\nAnd then the second time I said, \u201c\u201cWould you like to come without a chaperone?\u201d And\nsomehow we did, and we had a relationship until, I think a few weeks, I don\u2019t know. I\ndon\u2019t know about time, she -- she remembers better. She remembers even -- she said she\ncould never -- you won\u2019t have a problem [indecipherable]. She even remembers what I\nsupposedly promised 53 years ago. She still [indecipherable]. I have [indecipherable]\ncook, I want to be a good cook, and there was not much to cook with in Czechoslovakia\nafter the war. So I wrote to the Swiss Chamber of Commerce that I would like to work\nthere in the coming season, and I started in -- to work in Switzerland. But before we -- I\nwent to Switzerland, there\u2019s another thing I don\u2019t like, I don\u2019t like movies, because I can\nsleep cheaper at home. And she insisted she wanted to go to a movie. I said, \u201cI am not\ngoing,\u201d Yes, and she want -- I said, \u201cIf you want to go, you stand in line for the tickets.\u201d\nAnd she did, and she came with the ticket, and I said, \u201cYou know, maybe we should not\ngo, and should go to your apartment, have some other kind of fun.\u201d And that was the end,\nshe walked away, and I didn\u2019t see her until I came back from Switzerland.",
        "A: Yeah, I don\u2019t know why, but some -- something told me to --",
        "A: -- go -- to go and see her.",
        "A: Yeah, and then she proposed and wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer, so --",
