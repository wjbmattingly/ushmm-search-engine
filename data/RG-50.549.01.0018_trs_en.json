        "Question: Why don't we start by saying, just say you're name and where we are\nright now.",
        "Answer: Well my name is Felix Horn. | was born in Poland, in Lublin. And lama\nsurvivor. | was liberated in 1945 and after liberation | went searching for anyone\nwho might be still alive from my family so | returned to my hometown, Lublin. Which\nis in the middle of Poland. It is one of the rather bigger, larger cities. There were\n140,000 people prior to the war. Out of this at least half of it, 70,000 people\ncomprised of Jewish population. My family, a rather assimilated family and they all\nperished, all prior to 1945 when Lublin ghetto was destroyed and all went to, as far\nas | know, to the concentration camp, My-don-ick (ph). | came back to Lublin in\n1945 and there was already some Jewish life present in Lublin, mainly from people\nwho had returned from Russia, who escaped the war, escaped the Nazis and went\nto Soviet Russia and survived the war over there. | met some of my acquaintances,\nsome friends even from my school days, but not from my school per se since | was\nonly Jewish student in a Catholic school. And as anybody else you register and you\nleft notes on the walls and then anybody who talked to you, look | am here, if you\nhear anything from this and that please let me know, and to my surprise, | found two\nUncles, they survived the war. One survived being hidden by a Polish family. He\nused to be an officer in Polish Air Force prior to the war, which was very, very\nuncommon. And he was looking for the property that belonged to my grandparents\nFelix Horn 2\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 2\nactually, thinking everybody perished so he can probably take over the property.\nOne of my favorite Uncles. Another Uncle, his younger brother, survived in\nYugoslavia. He escaped the Nazis in Eastern Poland and he was a musician. He\norganized a military band for Marshal Teito (ph) of Yugoslavia. And that's how he\ngot into the partisan group and so on and he spent all the time until 1945 when |\nfound him in my home town too. Everybody came home looking for survivors. And\nhe attempted to take me with him to Yugoslavia since we found that nobody else\nsurvived the war, which my parents and my sister, all my Uncles, cousins,\nnumerous people. And he couldn't get me legally to Yugoslavia since | was not so-\ncalled blood relative. I'm only a nephew. If | be his brother or his child it would be\ndifferent. So | couldn't go with him so | was left in Poland again. My Uncle was not\nparticularly close to me after the war anyway. And we didn't find too many things in\ncommon. However, | didn't know what to do with myself. | remember | promised\nmy Mom that if | survived | would make all attempt | can to resume my education. |\ndid have two years of medical school, until 1941. Between 1939 and 1941. And\nthen | had to interrupt for obvious reasons, and then the decision had to be made.\nShould | go make a living somehow, | was hungry? | had a wife. We were married\nin Warsaw ghetto. And, or go to school. We couldn't afford, both of us were young,\nto go to school. How's going to support us? So | didn't Know what to do. |\nFelix Horn 3\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 3\nin a kind of a confused frame of mind but my first Uncle\ncame to rescue. He gave me some gold coins to sell in the black market and buy\nfood, and do whatever | wanted to.",
        "Q: Who did this?",
        "A: My Uncle who survived in Poland. He was the officer of Polish Air Force. | used\nthe coins for about two years to survive. | didn't do nothing. It was, situation very\nchaotic in Poland. The Communists took over. The only chance was to go to\nschool. So | thought, well, there's time to do it. | registered, | had saved all my\ndocuments, they were buried. All my documents except my High School Degree,\nwhich somehow was lost. But | did have my University Degrees, my University\nbooks, and attendance in the classes, and fortunately all the professors from my\nformer University in Luneburg called Woolf (ph), they moved to Western Poland at\nthat time, and | decided to move to Breslau, , former German\nterritory, where the same professor of my former school, Woolf (ph), resided now in\nthe same town. So | registered with no problem whatsoever. The papers were\nokay. The only thing is there was another Jewish student with me, don't recall\nexactly where he came from, but the remarks | heard in the class. It was, another\ntwo Jews. Hitler didn't kill all of you? You know, and the class was so annoying, not\nannoying but frightening even. And the common trend was at that time the refugees\nFelix Horn 4\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 4\ncoming back from Russia to Poland, not finding no purpose living in Poland, they all\nwere going West.",
        "Q: Let me ask you about that a little bit, just the atmosphere in Poland at that time.\nThe Nazis were gone, but as you're describing, it was still not a very friendly\nenvironment for Jews.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little bit more about what that was like? What that felt like\u2019?",
        "A: Well, just to mention here that | was raised in a rather very modern Jewish home,\nalthough my home was kosher. Just because kosher was believed to be healthier\nand free of any contamination and so on. But my father was very progressive man.\nFirst he was a locksmith then he became an architect with night education and so\non. He was a modern person. And we were living away from the Jewish center\nmostly so | had a formal Jewish education. | had a teacher come to my home\nteaching me religion, Torah, you know, Hum-ish (ph), all the biblical stories and so\non. | never spoke Yiddish though. My parents spoke Yiddish to each other. |\nbrought from school, | was going to a Catholic school, Yiddish was foreign to me.\nBut | did understand everything they were saying but they were talking to me in\nPolish. | was so comfortable, my Polish is really impeccable. Poles have difficult\ntime to look at me, | have Semitic look though. And then my Polish is so different\nFelix Horn 9)\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 5\nthan the Jews in Poland. You can spot a Jew during the war, they looked super. In\nother words, they looked like typical Pole, Nordic type. Blonde, blue eyes, etc. |\nhave a very short nose and the way they walked and so on you can tell the\ndifference. Jews were walking more as bent , kind of scared\na little bit. Even peaceful time, they are looking left and right. Someone might be\nhitting them or attack them or something. It didn't have to be a problem. You could\nbe hit by one person, only two people, but young hooligans. Boys. Seven, nine, ten\nyears old throwing stones, hitting with a piece of anything, an iron pipe, or whatever.\nSo, you know, | was different. | was straight. My Polish was impeccable as they\nsay but they knew who | was because | did return to my original name, which is not\nclassical Polish but its not Jewish or Yiddish either. Horn is really rather German or\nDutch. Van Horn, Von Horn, they are German names. So there was a little\nconfusion, wanted to know who | am. No one dared to ask\nme exactly, are you a Jew or not? But then shortly in classes | didn't hide it. | didn't\nhave no reason to hide it anymore. | was hiding all those years. So then they come\nand seek it, who | am. So there was people, | still have quite a few friends, Polish\nfriends. But many of them were for safety or security reasons, to say, shy away\nfrom me. They exchange words with me rather polite and so on but not very\ncordial. So | felt very uncomfortable. And then during the pilgrim in Kielce in Poland\nFelix Horn 6\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 6\n| got fired to existing situation, you know, and we felt, we felt very insecure. And\nbeing young, saying what am | going to do in Poland? | couldn't live in a country\nthat | didn't have a grave to go to. We had nobody left. My Uncle went back to\nYugoslavia. The other one converted to Christianity, the first one. They had\nnothing to do with Judaism, they had nothing to do with me either because | was\nJewish. Not that he hated the Jews. No. Why did he do it? | don't know. We\nnever talked about it. He was not a person | could have a dialogue with anyway.\nWhen | left | didn't say good-bye to him, he was not very interested. So talking to a\nfew other students of other departments in University, the University\nschool, philosophical department, so on and so on. We\ntalked about it and | inquire how they feel about it? What would they do? Would\nthey stay here? What are their plans actually? They were all in the same boat.",
        "Q: These were other Jewish students?",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: These were other Jewish students or?",
        "A: Who?",
        "Q: That you were speaking with about this.",
        "A: Some of them. But most of them not. But they admitted who they are. They\nwere Jewish and so on. And we all agreed that probably it is time to leave. It would\nFelix Horn 7\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 7\nhave to be illegal. There was no legal way for them to have left. You didn't have no\nvisa. You have nobody over seas to send us legal papers. Besides those papers\nwould take ages before you get legal entry, you know. Even after you get you're\nvisa you might take five, ten years. Some of my friends had to go to Sweden\nbecause it was much faster to get out of Sweden to the United States they say than\nwait in Poland for you're number to come up and not to be recognized, especially if\nyou're a Jew. And so | organized a student Kibbutz (ph), an academic Kibbutz (ph)\nof students. And | think in Hebrew they call it Kibbutz acadamime (ph) if | recall\ncorrectly, what | was told. | was not good at Hebrew either. | read Hebrew, | read\nmy Prayer Book and so on but | don't understand them. | read automatically. |\nknow the text, what it means, but not word by word. But my wife speaks Hebrew.\nAnd we elected to leave and we made contact with some what they call a Bree-ha\n(ph), | don't know if you're familiar with that word? Bree-ha (ph) is a group of young,\nJewish people. The avant-garde of the Pal-mach (ph), of the Jewish driving force of\ninformation of Israeli Armed Forces. Those are the young people who are politically\ninvolved in Zionist organizations and they are pioneering, collecting the remnants of\nwhatever is left over for the Jewish people to go back to Palestine at that time.\nThere was no Israel yet. And this was one of the stages, first to get us out of the\nhostile Poland where people didn't want to give us back nothing what we had. Asa\nFelix Horn 8\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 8\nmatter of fact all my furniture was given to some neighbors and so on. They refused\nto give me anything, you know? They belonged to us. The fur coats and radios,\ninstead of give to the Nazis we give to the Poles. They did not have to relinquish\ntheir status. And we gave to them, good idea, that if we survived we'd get\nsomething back, at least something. Talking about silverware, the candelabra that\nwere a few hundred years old, heavy, tall. All those things perished of course.\nThey, when they found out that | am alive, you know, they said the Germans took it,\nthey had to sell it, some of them. They couldn't survive. Anyway, it was immaterial\nanymore to me, | lost more than that. And with this we made a contact with the bra-\nha (ph) and on a given night all gathered and by train we are going to a little town\nnear the border. From there we were met by a group of people, we never really\nintroduced before. They knew about us though. And with their help and their\ncontacts with the border police and so on, they just looked the other way. We went\nright across the border to Czechoslovakia. Don't forget, this was, at that time it was\n1946. Still people coming and going to Poland, looking for family. From Poland to\nVienna, Austria, Czechoslovakia. Looking for some. survivors, different\nconcentration camp. So the guards at the border were not very religious in stopping\npeople. Even if they seen somebody. There was no invasion or so, there was a\npeaceful type of a bi-directional type of movement, you know. But anyway, as a\nFelix Horn 9\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 9\ngroup maybe we would create suspicion so we were able to get from\nCzechoslovakia. They put us on trucks to Vienna. And then over there we were\nmet by a group of Zionists, all Zionists. And they were very\ninstrumental. Thanks to them, they saved us in the beginning. First they had\ncontact with the local authorities, also notorious. Don't forget they had a lot of\ninfluence because Austrian authorities were more Nazi than the German Nazis. So\nthey were very, very guilty during the war, what happened. So for that reason alone\nprobably they tried to collaborate with the Jewish organizations. First we got a\nschool to our disposal. We have no home so they give us a whole school, big room,\nand there were twenty or twenty-one of us, two married couples and some girls and\nsome boys. So we had to divide the one huge room, it was like a theater of some\nkind or an auditorium, with sheets, wires, and we cover, you know, separate, like\nsmall cubicles. We had the beds over there like military beds. And it was very\ncomfortable really. And they took all of our documents, I'm talking about student\nbooks and our academically type of documentation, and they translate everything\nfor us into German. And they, having some contacts at the University, we didn't\nhave to go to a very rigorous type of screening or so, as long as our documents\nwere in order, then they segregated us into different facilities and who ever was in\nmedicine, some were first time that they started the University. | was already a third\nFelix Horn 10\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 10\nyear medical school student, fourth year. | had one year after the war in Poland so\nthis would be my fourth year. But medicine in Vienna was seven years so | still had\nfour, five, six, four more years to go. In German, that | never handled. | spoke\nFrench. | speak Slavic languages, Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, never German. But |\nlearn it fast. And they were accepted, they accepted all my former papers and\nexams | passed. Maybe because we were survivors. I'm sure there was some\nbearing to it, you know? They did not let us suffer, they wanted to make it as\nsmooth as a transition until they knew, around this new medical school, as they\ncould. Which | was very grateful for. We had no tuition. American Joint provided\nthis. And then we received food, they provide food for us too. So we were like a\nlittle Kubbutz (ph), student group, living and doing nothing but study so we were not\nhungry. And that's, slowly we got ourselves kind of use to the new surroundings,\nnew people. We met some friends who were there before us from Poland. Some\nof them Viennese Jewish students, one. We were very close. I'm sure we're much\ncloser now than if this would have happened before the war. Because we have\nsomething in common, we're all Jews and we all lost somebody. There was not one\nperson who was not victimized by loosing his family or part of his family.\nFelix Horn 11\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 11",
        "Q: Let me just ask you did people in that situation you're in, with people with that\nbackground, did you all talk about, did you compare experiences much? Talk about\nwhat had happened?",
        "A: Yes. | think our experiences were different. Everybody had a different story to\ntell. And, someone came from Russia, some had survived in the labor camps in\nRomania, some students survived in ghettos in Hungary and they were beaten and\nso they were persecuted, but they survived. And someone survived in their families\neven, like a sister or two brothers or one parent survived, you know? But always\nsomeone had somebody that he lost, he or she lost, you know? But we had\ncommon ground because we belonged to the same group of people. We were\nJews, we are students, but we got there different ways, by different routes, you\nknow? And everybody had their own stories. We sit at night and talk and talk and\ntalk. And everybody was not fascinated because this was a tragic story to be\nfascinated with, but it proved the just human will to survive and the question was,\nhow did you survive? Until today | ask myself the same question, how did | survive?\n| don't know. There was nothing that you are smart, that you knew what to do. If\nyou turn left it was you're death but | didn't know that. You turn right, you survive. If\nyou walked out during the day no one stopped you. At night, they shoot you. So it's\nhard to say. Is that fate? | never believe in fate, but | don't know. Some of my\nFelix Horn 12\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 12\nIndian colleagues, physicians, right now who is very, , he\nbelieve fate is something of, some external thing. He tried to convince me, this was\ninscribed in the Book upstairs, that | would survive. Well, | can't prove it, let's prove\nthat. But | had many, many days and nights of doubt if | will. The only sad story\nwas, if | perish this second, this minute, why didn't | perish earlier? Why should |\nhave to suffer all the time, you know? But we had one goal, to go ahead and study\nwas the number one. Most of us promised our parents, we want the memory of our\nparents not let down. | personally promised my Mom before they took her away to\nconcentration camp that if | escaped from the ghetto, my town Lublin, she had\nasked me that | had to promise to her, if | ever survive. She apologized, she cannot\nhelp me anymore, that | will never forget to go back to school. To make a better\nperson of myself. And | promise her. My Mom was an opera singer. She was very\ndisappointed when | decide to go to medicine. My Dad, after he became an\narchitect, he was upset | won't be an architect. | play violin so | try to compromise. |\ndrew, I've been drawing beautiful pictures of buildings, talent from my father, that |\ngot accustomed to seeing everyday. And to them, the best writer, clearly, printing\nand so on, you know, | draw things beautiful, | paint. So | do lots of things, so in\nmemory of my Mom that | still play music. Maybe this gives a little peace, that |\ndidn't let her down completely. But | felt since | was 13, that's all | want to do. |\nFelix Horn 13\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 13\nremember sick little boy. He was at that time maybe seven or eight, | don't\nremember his age exactly. | was maybe 13 or so, and he was getting shots and he\nwas so sick. There was a clinic, we couldn't afford a private doctor, we go to poor\npeople's clinic. And | felt if | could help that kid, if | could do something for him but |\ndidn't know what | could do. But that give me the idea that | would like to go to\nmedicine. Didn't know what I'm going to do in medicine but | like to be a doctor.\nAnyway, | have no regrets. | am happy | am, I'm almost not anymore, I'm retired\nnow, private practice.",
        "Q: Another question | have about, there you are in you're sort of student Kabbutz\n(ph) as you describe it, and all these people who survived this experience. Do you\nthink that, and it sounds like you're all very diligent in you're studies, I'm wondering\nwhether because of the experience, because you survived, whether that was part of\nthe motivation to do this? To make sure you became a doctor? Or for the other\nstudents to make sure that they did what they intended to do? I'm guessing maybe\npeople were even more serious than they might have been?",
        "A: I'll give you a surprising answer, no.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: | Knew what | wanted to be when | was 13, war or no war. | knew what | wanted\nto be. But the war forced me more of less to definitely not forget about it, and the\nFelix Horn 14\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 14\nfact that | promised my Mom that | will. Although if | could have physically, been\nable to, | would have done it anyway. So | don't believe that my personal\nexperiences had any bearing or influence. Although, | have to admit, that because\nof the course of events after the war it came easy for me in terms of, everything was\nfacilitated for me. The Zionist organization, American Joint, they paid for that and |\ndidn't have worry about expenses, food, shelter. We even had\nnights of fun, a little singing and someone playing harmonica\nand so on. Little things. But | really don't believe that this reinforced it, tortured me\nand so on. | would have done it anyway. | know myself. | know. | am a very\ndetermined person. | would have done it anyway, yeah, unless | was sick or\nsomething, but | would have done it. | think that my wife's Uncle that we discovered\nafter the war in Vienna, him being in New York, he wrote us a letter. | never met\nhim before. He was not my Uncle, he was a distant Uncle to my wife, when he\nwrote us, \"Don't you ever come back to the United States with doubt about\ncompleting you're education.\u201d And again, this was no doubt in my mind that |\nwanted to complete it anyway, but definitely if | want to go to Israel, my wife felt,\nwhich is not true, we're not in pioneering type of mood anymore. We're young but\nstill we're physically devastated. And to be a pioneer, go to Israel now, fight from\nbeginning. Again, she felt maybe life in the States would be easier for us. Do we\nFelix Horn 15\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 15\ndeserve a better life? Do we deserve a life better than our parents maybe had? |\ndon't have the answer to it. | would say, yes, why should we? But common sense\nand logic convinced me my wife was correct.",
        "Q: If | could stop you again for a second, | am curious about again you and you're\nwife and also the people you're with now in this new environment. If you could tell\nme a little more about, was it a big topic of conversation, whether or not to go to\nIsrael? Was there debate about that? Were there people determined to do it?\nWhether you had discussions or even arguments about that?",
        "A: Right. Well some group of our friends discovered some relatives in South\nAmerica, in Argentina and Paraguay. Another one discovered family in Australia,\ndistant family. They knew of. They never met them, like this distant Uncle that left\nPoland before the war yet, before they were born maybe. They knew of them\nbecause they remember their parents reading letters and so on. They seen pictures\nbut they never met them personally. To them they were strangers. So some of\nthem had friends or family in Canada, and so on. Some of them in the United\nStates. | would say the majority of us, perhaps more than 50% of the group, fell\nwith Israel. We felt more secure going to Israel. Not in terms of our lives, secure\nterms in no one would attack you from behind again and hit you, be anti-Semitic is\nall. You might be killed by a bomb, by a grenade, by an action, whatever, if you go\nFelix Horn 16\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 16\nto army, but you're in your own country. No one can make a\nto you, . But you Know we thought someday, sooner or later,\nafter the war we were optimistic. Things would work out somehow, sooner or later\nthere has to be peace. And we didn't predict what is going to happen, what is going\nto happen right now? But at that time, and this was my idea to go to Israel. In Israel\nmedicine was not exactly a favored profession. But this was my idea to do. But\nthen finally my wife said, well, if we go to Israel and we won't be able to make it\nthere, how are we going to get to the United States? Almost physically and\nfinancially impossible. But if we got to the United States, we cannot make it here.\nWe can always make it and they will help us, make illegal.\nWe can always do that. Which made common sense to me. And against my better\njudgment though, | consented. We probably should consider that as a more\npractical thing. And | betray my thought, maybe in a sense, that | was kind of\ngeared toward Israel. My years, the few years | was in Vienna and in school that is\nwhere | am going to go. But the common sense prevailed and then maybe the\nconvenience, and we got older a little bit at that time, and we are looking for a little\neasier life. No one says its going to be an easier life in the United States, which |\nfound out they, found it was true. It was not easy at all. | never worked so hard in\nmy life. But | was looking forward to it then, you know?\nFelix Horn 17\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 17",
        "Q: To?",
        "A: To come to the States.",
        "Q: But you're saying you felt you betrayed yourself a little bit by not going to Israel?",
        "A: Yes because | was geared to go to Israel. | just felt that's my place to go.\nMentally, you know? Although my parents were not Zionists. My Dad was a Bund-\nist (oh) which was a Socialist. And my cousin who was a young, what do they call\nit? A Scha-bo-tin-ski (ph) man, you heard about it, it's ultra right. Nationalist. My\nDad, showing me my cousin when we're young, dressed in a brown shirt with a belt.\nAnd the belt across his chest with a hat. Looked like a young Hitler uniform, like a\nNazi. He said, \"Look at you're cousin. That's a Jewish Hitler unit.\u201d And down on\nme and always was embedded in my mind, by saying Israel doesn't mean it has to\nbe all like my nephew there. There's going to be the , there's\ngoing to be all kinds of people. And | could contribute to the well being of Israel in\nmy own way. | discover my Judaism, so to say. Because | was raised, | knew | was\nJewish but | was going to a Catholic school, so | was kind of like a little odd type of\nan individual. | knew | was Jewish. | had Hanukkah at home and Christmas tree.\nMy Catholic friends come into, to my parents it didn't mean nothing. They knew |\nwas Jewish and they knew they are Jewish. They were Yiddish speaking, but they\nwere very progressive people. And my father didn't believe in Israel. Free Israel,\nFelix Horn 18\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 18\nPalestine, he was a Socialist. He believed that they should build a future where\nthey are. Fight for their right to work and so on. But this was before he became an\narchitect. | remember he was lucky, he was a more professional. Before he was a\nlocksmith, he was a worker. So maybe that's why he believe in it, all his colleagues,\nall with the same group of people, same professions, that's what they were fighting\nfor. But | knew. If my father would have survived the war, he would change his\npolitical views too. It was a different theatre after the war. | mean, you cannot fight\nfor certain ideology that either was in bankruptcy, although it was premature to say\nthat. | say that now after , but | didn't believe that you can\nsuppress human feelings and tell him what to do. You're going to be a clerk, or\nyou're going to be a whatever, a machinist, or a truck driver. | wanted to be what |\nwanted to be. It wouldn't be right to tell you what to be. And in this kind of\nenvironment, my father was promoting and so on, there was less freedom probably\nof choice, and so on. So | knew right away, | was too young to be politically\ninvolved at that time. Although today people at the age of like 17, 18, 19, they have\ncertain convictions, political . . .[End of Side 1 of Tape 1]. . . and so on and they\nmature more. Sure they can change their views. On the other hand, they go in one\ndirection they were raised or maybe they are convinced they are doing the right\nthing. So | discovered that | want to be Jewish, | am Jewish and | won't deny that, |\nFelix Horn 19\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 19\nsuppress this all those years. Suppressed to survive. Now | don't have no need to\nsuppress it. But which direction to go? In Judaism, | didn't know that yet because |\nwas like a newcomer to this kind of a thing. | was never raised in a Jewish\n. That Yiddish was my tongue and going to the shul (ph), the\nsynagogue all the time. | going once a year with my father because my father had\nto go because my grandfather looked at it, you know? He had to go. But again, |\nfelt | developed my own things. My own life when | get older. And of course | was\ninfluenced by the course of events, no question about it. See? So talking, going\nback to a group of my friends, which are still, we are like a family. We still are very\nclose friends. We see each other, even people in Australia or so, we are meeting\neach other maybe every five years or every year, every two years. | go to Israel.\nHalf of my class eventually left for Israel. | will never forget the moment where the\nfirst airline, EL-AL plane landed in Vienna to transport the remains of Theodore\nHershel (ph), was buried in Vienna. And | was one of the delegates honored to\ncarry on my right shoulder. There were eight students of us, carried the casket to\nthe airport, from the cemetery to the airport. And this was, the rest of my life | will\nremember that. | have pictures of it, too even. You know, we had nothing, we were\nas poor as poor could be, but | felt we were happy. We were happy. We live with\nthe memory of our past, our families, our parents. . As any\nFelix Horn 20\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 20\nyoungster will tell you, his parents were the greatest. Mine were too. But anyway,\nso about 50% of my group went to Israel and they established themselves there and\nthey did very well. And we elected to go to the States. | was at the end of my\nstudy. There was one professor of , who was an old, old Nazi. He\nwas about, close to 90 years old. Klein (ph) was about 88, 89. No one knew for\nsure his age, he looked like 120. He lost three sons on the Russian Front. And he\nflunked every Jew going for an exam in front of him. There was no, and these were\nthe smartest kids, flunked the first time. So |, there was another assistant professor\nwho was giving the exams too, but not while the old man was still there. And he\nwas never taking vacations. So | decided, a few of us decided, we'll go and get it\nover with. We're going to flunk anyway. We didn't even study, we're going to flunk,\nwith or without studying, we are going to flunk. And sure enough, we flunked\n, all of us. And then summer vacation started. This was about July,\nschool didn't start until the end of September, beginning of October, | think the\nbeginning of October. So | had one more exam to take. This was the final thing. |\nfinished all the studies. | had to repeat, there were things | was allowed to repeat it\nif | flunk. | was called to the American Embassy in Vienna, that my visa arrived and\n| have two weeks to go. There was a young lady there, | said, \"No. I'm very\nhonored with it and | didn't expect this to come so fast but | have a little problem.\u201d |\nFelix Horn 21\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 21\ntold her, | flunked one exam. And | have to repeat the exam. But it is summer\nvacation, now the school is closed. And the next one, the first one, and with my\nconnection with the secretary of the University, only connection where you had to\nhave preferential date on an exam, | would be the first one because I'll be leaving\nfor the United States. And | said | have to wait until October. And she tells me,\n\"How are you sure that you're going to pass it?\" And | said, \"Well, I'm not sure but |\nhope | pass it because | study now, if | didn't study and. . .\", | told her the story.\nShe was very uncomfortable and very upset about it. She was very hostile. She\nsaid, \"| lost a son in Korea. And he would like to come back home, but he's dead.\nHere you are given a chance to come to the United States and you're rejecting it?\" |\nsaid, \"I'm not rejecting it. But you don't understand. That's my whole life. | will\nstudy, | promised my Mom.\" And | had to study and I'm going to finish it whether\nyou like it or not. If 1 go or | don't go. | cannot go. My Uncle, that | had just\ndiscovered, a new Uncle, told me, don't you ever come here without you're diploma.\nYou'll be nobody. What am | going to do? Come to the States and dig ditches? In\nmemory of my parents | will never do that. If not I'll go to Israel. | told her this. |\nwant to go to the United States. My wife wants to go. We don't have no family.\nShe just discovered a family, an Aunt and an Uncle. Somebody we can call our\nfamily. And | don't understand that you are so difficult. | don't know. Is this a law,\nFelix Horn 22\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 22\nthat you have to do that? Or is it flexible? | didn't have anybody to talk for me in the\nEmbassy. | didn't have a lawyer, | didn't have no body, just myself. Me and my\nwife. My wife was crying. And she didn't respond to us so we got out and walked\naway, walked out. And this was the end of our dreams. We told our friends. They\nsaid, don't worry about it. We'll go to Israel. So | was already set to go to Israel.\nSure enough, what happened? My good old professor got sick. During the end of\nvacation. And sure enough, the assistant professor that we adored was in charge\nof exams. | think it was something like the 3rd or 4th of October, | took the exam.\nAnd sure enough | passed it. And | got my diploma with a formal ceremony, the\nUniversity of Vienna. My Uncle send me a tuxedo, his old tuxedo. We were\ngraduated without robes. The professors were wearing robes, we wore tuxedos.\nSome with tails some with tuxedos. And | graduate and started to say good-bye to\nall my friends in Vienna. Didn't know to go to Israel probably. All of a sudden | got\ntelephone call from the American Embassy in Vienna. This lady was replaced by\nsomebody else. They knew my story. There was no problem at all. She was just a\nbitter person because she lost her son. And maybe my age, | don't know, | never\nseen him. And maybe she was just devastated by it and she took the anger, | knew\nit is not a personal thing. But she was an angry person, she had a tragic event. |\nhad tragedy all my life, since the war. But this other person was _ very\nFelix Horn 23\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 23\nunderstanding, very warm. And she said, this other lady said to me, \"There was no\nproblem at all.\" Even the first time. And this happens quite often, that things will be\nchanged, dates and so on. Asked me when I'll be ready to go? | said, | am ready to\ngo any time from now and just packed and that's it. And so we said good-bye to a\nlot of friends. Some were disappointed that we didn't go to Israel. And some went\nto South America, Australia and so on. We promised we are going to keep in touch\nwith each other. Because we were one family. We went through our youth, the\nformative ages actually without our parents, without somebody from our direct\nfamily. We create our own family. If my friend was like a brother to me, his wife\nwas like a sister to me. And we had two couples on the list were single, they were\nalways looking up at us. Although we are not the oldest, not at all. But we married\nvery young, my wife was less than 16, we got married in Warsaw ghetto. So we\nhad certain authority because being married, you know? It carries certain weight, at\nleast within our group. And those were the happiest days, outside my youth of\ncourse. The second stage of my life. And here we are, we knocked at the door of\nUnited States.",
        "Q: Let me just ask you, how did you, when you came over how did you come over?\nOn a ship?\nFelix Horn 24\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 24",
        "A: Yes. Well we were separated me and my wife. They took us to a camp in\nGermany, in Hannover. Men were separated and women separate. We could see\neach other during the day. Otherwise we are confined to separate rooms and so\non.",
        "Q: What kind of camp was this?",
        "A: It was some form of labor camp or something. It was not a concentration camp\nbefore, no. It was labor. Barracks, you know? And it was like an office, big building\n| remember. And | was a young doctor without any experience yet, just a piece of\npaper, that's all. And | was assigned to check some of the immigrants who were\nsuppose to go to the United States, for the inflectional diseases or any lice and other\nthings, things like this. And we're waiting for arrival of a ship. And | remember the\nname of the ship. It was a military transport ship normally carrying something like\n300 or 400 soldiers or military men. But 1,800 people were on that ship. |\nremember the wait for a small ship, General Blachfort (oh) was the name, you don't\nforget that. And I've got to tell you, being on that ship, like in three weeks | think we\nwere in the camp before the ship arrived, and we boarded the ship. It took us about\n10 or 11 days through the Atlantic, it was November. And the sea was very unruly.\nWe were sick, seasick, all of us. On top of that, | never ate ham with raisins. Not\nthat | was Kosher. | ate ham, but not the raisins. Polish culinary thing didn't allow\nFelix Horn 25\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 25\nsweet in ham. Ham was always with spices or salt and so on, but not with sweet,\nnot normally with ham. So when | just took this, tasted the ham, it got me sick to my\nstomach. And anyway we survived the war, we survived worse things than that, so\nwe survived the trip too. And my wife's Aunt expected us at the port in New York\nand was a distinguished lady, beautiful person. Elegant, never seen such elegance\nfor years. And turned out that she was instrumental in having us moved to a hotel,\nto some kind of a gathering thing for the, old immigrants were going to. They pay\nfor the room, the hotel. There was a big suite. So with one room, some other\npeople, another room, you know? But it was very nice. They paid for this. And\nthen we got introduced to each other, with my wife's family. Her husband, who was\nthe one that | wrote to and he wrote to me. And after all those years he wrote very\nbeautiful Polish and my English was very bad, very bad. It was tragic. | didn't know\ntoo much at all. And they had two daughters. And of course you invite you're poor\nrelatives to the house. They lived on Sth Avenue in New York. We are not properly\ndressed for that kind of encounter but that's all we had. The only thing | brought\nwas a big case with books that's what | had. Otherwise, | looked like a rook sack.\nNothing. | didn't have no suits, no shoes, just what we had with us. And they had\ntwo daughters, two beautiful girls. And | felt very uncomfortable and she introduced\nus aS DP's. Displaced Persons. Like embarrassed that we are part of the family.\nFelix Horn 26\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 26\nAnd we were invited for dinner there. And when my wife came in and put her coat\nin the closet and when we left for the hotel she found $20.00 in the pocket. | was\nvery upset about it. | didn't learn the American way. Is this the American way? To\nput $20.00 in you're pocket? | think this was an insult. | could use that money, no\nquestion about that. The way it was done, | didn't know what to do. How to do.\nMaybe afraid | wouldn't take it if they proposed, you know? Besides, we are getting\nfood in the hotel, | needed the money. | did need the money really. My wife very\nsoon got a job, right there in New York. She spoke some English, among\nimmigrants she spoke several languages, fluent in German of course, and in Polish.\nAnd she speak Spanish too. And she could be like an interpreter, helping the\nAmerican to distribute the refugees to go left, right, wherever\nthey needed to go. Giving information, translating and so on. And she was paid for\nit. Not much, but she was paid enough to get a bus and pay a bus. And | talked to\nthis Uncle whom | adored. He was really a fascinating person. And | took to him\nright away, he showed me his heart, he opened up completely. A man that | never\nmet before. Never heard of me. His brother-in-law was a Director of American Joint\nin Warsaw, prior to the war.",
        "Q: Director of?\nFelix Horn 27\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 27",
        "A: My wife's Uncle. His brother-in-law. You know, his wife and my wife's Aunt in\nWarsaw, they were sisters. And the husband of her Aunt in Warsaw, he's that\nAmerican, he direct American Joint in Warsaw. You know, Joint Committee,\nAmerican Joint?",
        "Q: Joint Committee of?",
        "A: Well American Joint was an organization helping the Jews.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He was a very big, important figure, pre-war, in Poland, of course. Anyway, we\nsat and talked and so on. He asked me to go to register, where young doctors went\nto register, in New York. You have to do something with yourself there, you've got\nyou're diploma, now you're going to be a doctor. | don't know what that means\nreally, yet. And | went to register. | had to wait in line, not on a line, there was about\n300 or 400 people, all doctors. Young doctors like me. And it was where someone\ntakes you're name and give you some options, hospitals in New York, in Brooklyn,\nyou name it. And | look at this. In the meantime | had to go there by subway and\nthe transportation there, in New York, people, | never was in a city of 10 or 11\nmillion people. And to me | was in Vienna, which was 2 1/2 or 3 million people, was\na huge city. By comparison to Poland, Vienna was a metropolis. | came to New\nYork, | was totally lost. And | was uncomfortable. A little scared too. What am |\nFelix Horn 28\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 28\ngoing to do here? How can | live in a big city like this? And then | didn't like it. |\nwanted to go to a small town. And | talked to my Uncle, my wife's Uncle, he said,\n\"You're right. | suggest you be, you'll find yourself better in a small town.\u201d And they\nsend me to Jewish Committee in New York City with my dilemma. And | found a\nvery listening ear there in an older lady who listened to my story and she said, \"You\nknow what? You should maybe stay in one of the bigger cities, in New York State\nmaybe, you'll be not too far from you're Uncle, just in case you need that contact\nwith him and so on, and maybe you'll find yourself even more comfortable and feel\nmore secure that way.\u201d So | said, \"Well, fine.\u201d She asked me, \"Where do you want\nto go?\" | said, \"| don't know.\" She opened a book, an Atlas, a map. | put my finger\non it. Rochester, New York. She said that's a good city, University City, she said.\nShe made arrangements with Jewish Committee in Rochester to expect us there.\nThey assign us to a German speaking family that they sub-let a room in their house.\nWe could speak German, it was easy. And we went. With our big suitcase, one\nsuitcase with books. | had a medical instrument there which | brought with me, |\nwanted to be a pathologist. We called it a micro-tomb (ph), it's outdated now. |\nbrought them from Vienna, it was world famous in those days. That's one thing |\nbrought with me. So we stayed with, | felt good already. | felt\n. They had a long car and the streets, there was no traffic,\nFelix Horn 29\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 29\nthere was no subway. | mean, you could talk to you're neighbors, you know? You\ncould walk around. It was great. And after maybe a week or so of staying there my\nwife got a job. Got a job working at Woolworth's. Selling donuts. Behind the\ncounter, selling donuts. She would bring in $6.00 each night, for nothing. And she\nwas telling me her experiences at work. She worked with a lot of African-American\nand some minorities, but not as many that, well they were lower class American\npeople, white people, but some of them didn't even finish High School, and so on.\nVery soon she was, she graduated from the University of Vienna, she was an\neducated person. They discovered she was a very intelligent woman, so they\nmoved her right to the office with the bookkeeping department. And she was taking\norders and supplies and so on. | remember she told me one day they had some\ndevice, you count together six donuts of sugar donuts, six donuts with chocolate,\nthey had to use the machine to add it up and she didn't need to. She added it up in\nher head, and say it's $1.97. They would look at her, how do you know? Well |\nfigured it out. | don't know, my brain. Anyway, they discovered she's smart and\nthat's how she got the job. At least she got a paying job. Now | felt more insecure\nthan ever. Myself, | didn't know what to do myself. So talking to my benefactors,\nthe German-Jewish family that we stayed with, they say, \"You know what? I'll\nintroduce you to our German doctor. He is from Germany, a Jewish doctor in\nFelix Horn 30\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 30\nGermany. Maybe he can help you because you're a doctor, he's a doctor. He has\ncontacts and maybe he tell you what's next step.\" Because we don't know what to\ntell you. And the Jewish Committee, they were awaiting any assistance, if | need\nanything they will, but they want to leave me alone and see what | want to do. | met\nthis German doctor. He say, \"You know what? Let me talk to the Chief of Staff of\none of the hospitals, which was the University Hospital, he's on staff. Let me talk to\nhim and see what he suggests.\" | said, \"Fine.\" \"In the meantime, | have a lot of\nGerman people, my patients, if you want to come and help me in my office here?\" |\nsaid, \"| don't have a license yet to practice medicine here.\u201d He said, \"I won't let you\npractice medicine. You assist me, help me with the x-ray department, x-rays and\nmoving the files and so on, and I'll pay you for it.\u201d | said, \"Okay.\" So | felt better yet,\nyou know? And one day he came back to me, this German doctor, and he said to\nme, \"You know what? | made an appointment for you with the Chief of Staff. He\nspeaks a little German. He is Jewish, but he has a resident who speaks fluent\nGerman, so he will be there when you are there.\" | said, \"Fine.\" He brought me in,\nhe picked me up and brought me there, he said he would pick me up later. When |\nwalked in, he spoke very broken. My English was just as bad as his German. But\nthe German resident was there, German-speaking. American of German\nextraction. And at first he wanted to know my life story. Being a Jew, knew I'ma\nFelix Horn 31\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 31\nsurvivor. He wanted to know the whole story. And we're sitting there for four hours.\nHe asked for lunch to be brought to his office there. We had lunch together. And\nfinally said, he released the resident to go away, and he said, \"You speak German, |\nunderstand what you're talking about. | maybe don't speak as good but | can\nunderstand.\" And he was fascinated with my story, wanted to know all the story.\nAnd | thought he felt guilty for some reason, | don't know why. Maybe because here\nhe has his whole family here, survived. | found out later he had a son of my age\nwho was a young doctor too, and maybe he felt sorry for me, you know? That! was\nso physically, mentally devastated. And in the meantime | found out that its almost\nimpossible to get accepted in that hospital as an intern because American boys,\ninterns, medical students, have in advance, a year in advance, have to file their\ndocumentation and so on in the hospital of their choice and its like a lottery. Either\nthey take you or not. The hospital has a choice of taking the best. So |, it looked\nlike the situation was very grim, that | might not be able to get in there even. Beside\n| cannot give, this was February, February of 1951. We arrived in November of\n1950, in New York. For February, 1951, right. And the year doesn't start until June,\nthe end of June or July ist is when the academic year start in the hospital, new\ninterns come in. So | told him in German plainly, | said, well, | see that it's probably\nis hopeless for me to even, since | don't speak English, | don't understand the\nFelix Horn 32\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 32\nnurses. How can | talk to patients? He said, \"Well, you got since February, until\nJuly 1st to pick up you're English.\" \"And what are you going to do?\" \"I'm going to\nintroduce you to two ladies, they speak fluent German. They will be you're personal\nteachers, they will teach you English for nothing.\" Two spinsters. And that's the\npaper | want you to sign. | was so suspicious, | wanted to know what | am signing.\nWhat am | signing? You're signing that you want to be an intern, didn't you? | said,\nyes. So you sign that you agree to be an intern. | said, but, | haven't taken the\nexam. You don't have to take no exam, | am the boss here. | am the Director. You\ndon't have to take an exam. You would have passed the exam, he told me. He\nlooked at my books and my and he said, you deserve to be\nhere. If you're English is going to improve you'll be okay. He was like a God sent\nperson to me. And my Archangel was the German resident. Wherever | was he\nwas with me. Where he was, | was his tail, you know? And when they were making\nrounds in the hospital, | was first the Chief resident, then the middle resident, then\nthe Junior resident, then the Senior intern. | was finally the Junior Intern, | was the\ntail end of the procession, and the nurses between. So | never even heard all the\ndiscussion that took place when making rounds in the a hospital. The door would\nopen, only the front of the group could participate in the discussion. | couldn't even\nhear from a distance. But | listened as much as | could. Wrote some notes in\nFelix Horn 33\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 33\nGerman. Enough that when the rounds finished, | went to the record, hospital of the\npatient, | made copies of certain things. And at night with one bulb on me, | would\nlook in a German dictionary, | was translating. That's how | learned medical\nterminology, how to converse with a patient, how to make a diagnosis, what tests\nyou do, and so on. It was so different than | was use to in Vienna. But in Vienna, all\nfairness, | never was an intern. | graduated and | was shipped right away. So |\ndidn't have the exposure to the hospital in the practical type medicine, you know?\nBut there was a double hazard here, no language and no experience. And | had\nvery little time to pick up my English. Anyway, but to make a long story short, the\ntwo old ladies, they were beautiful old ladies, they taught me English. It was a\npractical English, | never had a formal English education of course. But | bought a\nradio from the first money | made, and my wife, and | listen phonetically to\neverything. And not to music, listen to people talking. To get acquainted with. Oh, |\nforgot to mention, when | lived in New York before we left for register, for twenty-five\ncents | went to a movie on 42\"\u00a2 Street. | stayed there from 9:00 am until about 5:00\nor 6:00 PM, my wife was working as a translator, right? | was there, not watching\nthe movie, | didn't understand nothing, but | would listen to the phonetics, people\ntalking. And after their third time around | understood what they were talking about.\nFelix Horn 34\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 34\nThen I'd comprehend some, some of the mimics, some of the interaction, and |\nunderstood.",
        "Q: So you watched the same movie three times?",
        "A: No. Me, myself? Oh yes, | did. Only to listen. | watched, | was not interested in\nthe movie, | didn't Know, but | wanted to hear people talking. Maybe | could stay in\nthe park someplace but | couldn't force anybody to sit with me and talk for eight\nhours with me. Here, in the movie, they talked. So | could listen, for twenty-five\ncents. And if | had fifty cents, | put twenty-five cents into a saving thing, a little piggy\nbank, and for the first money | bought a radio. | managed $7.00 so | bought a radio.\nAnd at night | listened to the radio too, not to music, just to people talking. A talk\nshow or something. | listen to all people talk. That's what | was, | was hungry. |\nwant to know that. And | knew | had to meet a deadline. It's like a prisoner who has\nonly the sense of the death. He is going to be executed in four months. My\nexecution was in four months, either | pass it or | don't pass it. And | didn't want to\nthink about it. What's going to happen if | don't pass it? What am | going to do? |\nknow my wife's Uncle would not let us down, maybe he would send me some\nbusiness or someplace or so. But this was not my cup of tea, | wanted one thing\nonly and that's what | wanted to do. And things got, it, what do you call it? With\nperseverance. And there were days we were really didn't think we were going to\nFelix Horn 35\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 35\nmake it, financially and otherwise. We were hungry, not hungry while interned, but\nwe didn't eat meat for months, just vegetables, we couldn't afford any. But we were\nnot hungry for meat, once a week when | became an intern, we were invited to\nhospital cafeteria, the family. Like an intern could bring his family, like a wife and\nchildren. Our son was born then, in Rochester. And we came to the hospital and\nhad a fiesta, a beautiful dinner. Turkey, for almost three years, every Sunday,\nturkey. Finally, after three years, | hated turkey. But I, at least | had meat. And we\nmet the other young families, wives of other colleagues of mine. And they all knew\nmy story eventually because my resident spoke German told everybody. They did\nnot shy away from me, they were so nice, they were so warm, they were so\nassuring. They invited me, they were very well-to-do young people. Their families\nwere very wealthy. Each one has a sports car and so on. | looked at them, will |\never live long enough to have that? But they invited me to country clubs, you know.\nWhen they partied, | am their colleague. They invited me and my wife. How am |\ngoing to go there? | have no transportation. | have no money for bus. | mean, it\nwas twenty-five cents a bus, one way. It was fifty cents, both ways is $1.00. $1.00\nis a lot of money, so we couldn't go. This is not the problem yet. What are we going\nto wear? | didn't have a decent, | had hospital uniforms, but | cannot go to a country\nclub party, and no money to buy it. My wife didn't have a dress either. So what did |\nFelix Horn 36\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 36\ndo? | told them I'm sorry, my wife doesn't feel good. She's sick. | cannot go. Well\ncome yourself. Is she that sick? She belongs in a hospital. No, she's not that sick.\nWell then you can go. | cannot leave her alone. She doesn't have nobody to help\nher, if she needs a glass of water or so. Well, they understood. But the fact was |\nwas invited. | was treated like equal. And | was reassured. And | gained a kind of\nsecurity right away. | felt good. And | was not afraid no more and | knew | can\nmake it probably. What happened to my wife? She had parties too. She worked\nthere. Eventually, by the way, she switched jobs, she got a better job at Blue\nCross/Blue Shield. My wife had some medical education, | think it was two years of\nmedical school. She didn't like it though so she quit, she went...\nEnd of Tape 1\nFelix Horn 37\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 37\nTape 2",
        "A: .. . to politics, economy. She is excellent at this. Really tops. So she had the\nexperience of medical terminology, she had a job, worked for Blue Shield. They\ninvited her to a party. Same story. She told them | don\u2019t feel good so she cannot\ngo. And so we kind of navigating for a few years, three years or so. Until | finished\nmy residency. And then it was time to move further. We discover our good friend\nwho's, her parents, my parents were friends when they were single yet, came from\nSweden, she survived the war in Russia. She came back to Poland after | left\nPoland. And she found out that | was alive. So she found an Aunt in Buffalo, New\nYork. She contacted her Aunt who send the papers to Warsaw, but she had to\nleave Warsaw, Poland to Sweden in order to be eligible for transfer to the United\nStates. That's how it was at that time. She arrived. She was in Buffalo, New York,\nwhere her Aunt use to reside. And she found out | was in Rochester. And they\ncame to visit me with her husband. She lost her first husband, which | never met,\nand the second husband that she met in 1945, they married, he was like my\nbrother. He's dead now. So we are good friends. After | finish my residency,\ninternship in Rochester, we elected to go to Buffalo, New York. At least we have a\nvery personal friend, bring back the old days, you know? Part of our happy days\nyet, and part of our family really. Because her parents were friends of my parents.\nFelix Horn 38\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 38\nAnd she worked at the Cancer Institute, Rosewell Park. She\nalready. | came to Buffalo, New York. | was already after internship, | spoke\nEnglish and so on. And | began working in the hospital as a resident. And started\nsaving a little money, or | was making some more money. And | bought myself a\ncar already, | had new Chevy | bought myself. | have to retract something. Going\nback to Rochester, | mentioned | had a big case with books and a micro-tomb (ph).\nWhen | was in Rochester, one of the pathologist at the University, when he heard\nmy story from the Chief of Staff, who was a surgeon, he said he heard | wanted to\nbe a pathologist. He approached me, if | would like to continue it. But in the\nmeantime, | lost the vision in my left eye during the war, when | was beaten by the\nGermans, so | could not use a binocular microscope. And pathologists have to use\nbinocular. So this was, | was professionally handicapped so | said no. So | said,\nbut you know what? | have a micro-tomb (ph), if you want it you could use it for the\nUniversity. He said, you mean you have a micro-tomb (ph) set from Vienna? | said,\nyes. You know, we've tried to get this for years but during the war we couldn't get it,\nand so on. He said, definitely. Are you sure you want to get rid of this? | said, yes,\n| want to give it to him. Not to him, to the University. | mean, the University was\ngood to me. They accepted me as an orphan, practically an orphan, and they\nalready put me on my feet. | wanted this, it's a little thing | can do. No way. No\nFelix Horn 39\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 39\nway. We are a University, we have a budget, we'll pay for it. They insisted on it,\ninsist on it. But even not, | had so much money, | even bought a car, a used car. A\nPlymouth, 1947. | remember that. This was 1952, | think. A five-year-old car. A\nPlymouth, for that micro-tomb (ph), you see? Okay.",
        "Q: And then you were able to go to parties after that?",
        "A: [Laughter] Now | could go to parties, right.",
        "Q: As long as you've gone back a little bit, | want to, just before we pick up with you\nin Buffalo, but | want to go back for a second. I'm very curious if you can remember,\nyou talked about coming over on the ship and coming into New York Harbor. I'm\nvery curious if you can remember the day when you actually first entered the Harbor\nin New York? What was it like on the ship? What was it like coming into the\nHarbor? Or you're first impressions?",
        "A: | only remember one thing. | was sick from eating that raisins with ham. |\nremember, or hot dogs with raisins or sweet things, marmalade, so | was safe from\nthis and plastic food and so on, but | see the Ellis Island,\nwhich | knew all about. But this was a holiday, it was a very memorable day for us.\nMaybe symbolic. | remember | said | don't know if | should believe in fate or not. It\nwas Thanksgiving Day. Still today, our Thanksgiving Day is a very important\nholiday for the whole family. Children, us. And for us particularly. This was a\nFelix Horn 40\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 40\nholiday, | don't remember what day it was, but it was Thanksgiving Day, | remember\nthat. And | don't know what to tell you. It was a huge port, the harbor you know?\nSeeing all the immigrants, the refugees spilling out like, you know, on the port, you\nknow, and going through the control, which was nothing. They asked me what |\nhad, a big, huge case of books. | said, asked them if they wanted to open it and in\nthe few words | knew of English, he said, no, no, no. They knew we were refugees\nin trouble, what would we have? Nothing. We have no clothes even. And then, but\nthey opened this and the trust, the people, you know, the official clerk like the\ncustoms, | mean, it was not like searching us or asking personal questions, nothing\nof that kind. Of course we had to go through health control. This was very strict\nbecause there were many immigrants coming who had tuberculosis. In those days,\nwe had to have x-rays taken at the German camp before we boarded the ship. And\nif there was any scar they wouldn't let you through. You had to stay, be treated\nthere in Germany, and you were just delaying you're arrival in the United States,\nafter some time, I'd say a year, six months to a year, you stayed in that camp there.\nThat's why | stalled. | talked to some doctors there because | was a little doctor\nalready. And our chest x-rays were negative, it was fine, so we didn't have no\nproblem with this. The only thing was annoying me, at the time the custom control\nand so on, entry, legal entry in the United States, | had to sign that | was never a\nFelix Horn 41\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 41\nNazi. This was beyond understanding. | had to sign | was never a Nazi? Well later\n| found out that some of the Nazis in the United States, imports from Balcan (ph)\ncountries, you know, false papers, there were many Nazis and many were\nacknowledged by our government. | found out our government paid even some\nNazi collaborators in Europe, right after the war. The Butcher of Lyons, for\nexample, he was in solid with the CIA. Of course | understand she was being paid\nlike $50,000.00 a year. | don't know why. This was obviously after a certain period\nof time, all the secret things were legalized. People opened the archives. That's\nwhere | found out, reading things about it. But it brought back memories. | had to\nsign that | was never a Nazi. | didn't know why.",
        "Q: Did you ask the person? | mean, why should | have to sign?",
        "A: No, that's just the procedure. To sign it. | would understand if this was, at that\ntime it wasn't even such a hostile territory, , not yet. They\nwere really partners in the war, you know, allies. But if | would have to sign | was\nnot a Communist, | understand. Maybe | would understand that. But that | was not\na Nazi? How could | be a Nazi being a Jew? Of course, even if some Jews were\ncollaborating with Nazis, there were some in the concentration camps. But not\nbecause, the Germans used them only, of course, right? But a Nazi would never\nallow those Jews to become Nazis. They just used them for their dirty work, that's\nFelix Horn 42\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 42\nall. There were some Jews collaborators, of course. Jewish Police in Warsaw\nghetto, for example. But anyway, it didn't effect me that much, but they just, for\nyears, it just lingered in my mind. Why did | have to do that? Why sign it, you\nknow? And then | was wondering, those German Nazis you read here and there,\nUkrainian discovered now, Deb-yan-uk (ph) for example, you know, that was\narrested and sent to Israel eventually. He was exonerated, not by the United States\nbut by Israel. So that's, it stuck in my memory, | would say. But otherwise, the\nAmerican way of openness, people friendly, New York City, they are too busy\nsometimes for us and that's something that bothered me, but | didn't blame them\nbecause they are American, because the style of life was in New York. 10 million\npeople. | mean, nobody has no time to be too nice to you because, they are nice if\nyou stop them, but | remember in Europe | asked a cab driver to go to the highest\noffice for some information, about medicine and so on, and |\nasked him how to get there. He said, \"| don't know, but if you want to hop in my cab\nI'll take you there.\" And | was thinking about it, you know? He didn't want to tell me\nwhere to go, | was walking, | couldn't afford a bus. But he didn't want to tell me\nwhere it is. But if | pay for the taxi, he would take me. There are few things, but it\u2019s\na lower class people. But he was not hostile. He was not unfriendly. He was not,\nhe was himself, that's how he was. | learned to just ignore those things eventually.\nFelix Horn 43\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 43\nBut the few little things, | was talking in my mind, you know? But overall my\nexperience coming to the United States, overall, was nothing but highly positive.\nAnd | am saying that in a truthful manner, that | don't recall any bitterness. | never\nencountered any rough treatment or anti-Semitic even type of thing. Never had it,\nno.",
        "Q: How long did it take to go through the customs? Was it a few days one day and .\n..?",
        "A: No, this was almost a day. In fact, early in the morning, | think they started at\n6:00 in the morning | think. Because | remember they walked us out quite early. In\nthe cabin, of course, we were sleeping in hammocks on the ship. We didn't sleep,\nwe were just vegetating in those things. And they, | think by late afternoon we were\nall done. And they deposited that huge crate that we had and then | remember\nmeeting my wife's Aunt from a distance, dressed in a hat and so on, which was\nmaybe 3:00 or 4:00 PM at that time. It took us about six or eight hours maybe, at\nthe most.",
        "Q: So actually when you got to finally leave there and actually go into the city it was\nstill Thanksgiving?",
        "A: That's correct.",
        "Q: It was still the holiday so the streets are probably empty, | guess?\nFelix Horn 44\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 44",
        "A: There was nothing, there was nothing on the street, correct. The streets were\nempty. The whole port was empty. There were some ships here and there but\nthere was no traffic there, no. We were not usual immigrants, not because, we are\ndisplaced people so we came on government ship, you know, military ship. And we\nfound a lot of support from the crew. We were crowded, we were so crowded.\nThere was no room to sit because we were 1,800 people on 300 or 400 capacity\npeople, you know. And we didn't stay long there, of course, we were taken away\nright away to this hotel.",
        "Q: Were people having any sort of Thanksgiving dinner? Did you have that that first\nnight or not? Do you remember?",
        "A: You mean that night when we, only on the ship. This was the day that we\narrived, is that what you mean? That's when we had the ham, raisins, the sweet\nthings which I, they told us it was because of the holiday. Normally we wouldn't get\nit either. And | thought, gee, | wonder what they eat on non-holidays? | got so sick\nfrom that. | love ham, ham | love, but not sweet ham. Not with raisins. But you\nknow for a man who was hungry so many years, you know? Surprising how |\ndistaste the ham with raisins. | was not hungry anymore really. In Vienna | was not\nhungry. No, we were well fed and our American Joint was supporting us very well.",
        "Q: So let's go back now, you're in, you go to Buffalo?\nFelix Horn 45\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 45",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: What year is this? Do you remember?",
        "A: This is 1953. Right. | worked in the hospital and | didn't know what to do.\nShould | go into practice after internship? Should | go to residency? Residency\nwas another four years. | decided | can't sit. First | want to be a plastic surgeon. To\nbe a plastic surgeon you have to take four years training and | have to be American\nborn or American graduate of an American school in those days. And | was told |\nwould never make it, forget about it. So | decide to get a job in the hospital, so |\nworked in the hospital as a house physician. And | was getting nice money,\n$250.00 a month, that was a lot of money. You could buy a suit, pair of shoes. My\nwife could buy a dress, in a cheap store like Marshall's here or TJ Max. But it was\nnew. We never had new stuff before. In Vienna, we're getting clothes handed to us\nfrom American Joint. Some of it's donated merchandise, you know, but we're\nhappy, lucky to get it. There was nice stuff but, and we met a lot of people in the\nsame boat as us. Some professional, some not professional. Some worked in the\nfactories, some worked in the offices, you know, from Europe. So we, since we met\npeople from my country, from Poland, you more or less cling to each other.\nDifferent city maybe, but we're closer than anybody else. And they are about the\nsame age. So we had about a ton of friends, a ton. Many, many friends from\nFelix Horn 46\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 46\ndifferent parts of Poland. Some from Vienna even. And | met, in Buffalo, a friend of\nmine from Vienna, who left Vienna, he was a journalist, to the United States as an\nimmigrant, a few years later. He didn't know I'll be in Buffalo and he was in Buffalo.\n| met him once in a gathering of my friends, and we knew each other from Vienna.\nSo we dressed like one family, spoke the same language, although we all spoke\nEnglish at that time. Kids were little, about the same age, they played together.\nThe wives had something to do. But my wife, like our parents, felt she should stay\nhome with the kids. And by that time she was pregnant with my second child, | had\na daughter that you met today. And she was born in Buffalo. My son was born in\nRochester.",
        "Q: Oh, well let's go back then. When was you're son born? What year?",
        "A: My son was born in 1952, August 28, 1952. | was in Rochester at that time. |\nwas an intern.",
        "Q: And you named him what?",
        "A: Genisty (ph) Hospital in Rochester, New York, right.",
        "Q: And what was the name of you're son?",
        "A: Of my son?",
        "Q: Yes.\nFelix Horn 47\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 47",
        "A: Gerald David. David after my wife's little brother that perished. That we think\nsurvived the war, now, we just found out.",
        "Q: Oh really?",
        "A: We think we found out. We're not sure yet. We cannot find him yet. But we\nfound, and later maybe.",
        "Q: Or, | don't know, we could just talk about it now, because let me just say for the\ntape here, in you're video interview, you and you're wife, you both tell the stories of\nhow you lost him from this basically this fake resort that the Nazis tricked people to\ngoing to and that. Now, when you did the video which was two or three years ago, |\nbelieve, right?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: At the time you were both convinced that he had not survived.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: So now you're saying you've gotten some new news?",
        "A: About a year ago, we went to a friend of ours here from Warsaw who just found\nher twin brother after fifty plus years. Not knowing he survived, by pure accident,\nshe found him. So we met him. And my wife talked to him and she said, you know\nwhat? | have a little brother who was, when the war started she was seven, he was\nat that time nine years old. He was born in 1933, her little brother was born in 1933.\nFelix Horn 48\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 48\nSo in 1943 or 1944, , | don't remember exactly now. And he\nwas at that time 10 or 11 years old. So he perished. So anyway, talking to this\nfriend now, he said, why don't you write a letter to such and such an office in\nWarsaw, Poland? They have lists of many people, they survived camps and so on.\nWhy don't you do that? My wife did. Never got a response. The man who runs\nthis is an American boy who runs a certain foundation, | think the name is Linder\n(ph) Foundation in Warsaw. Who send a list of survivors in this camp that we know\nhe went to. And his name, Arian name, not real name, Arian name, is listed as\nsurvivor of that camp. This list is from dates from 1946. The year of birth is the\nsame. But the day and month is not clear, that's a copy of a copy of a copy. We\ncannot decode the day and the month, but 1933. His name was Roman Kolvolski\n(ph). So we wrote, we put everything in motion right now. We wrote to Israel. We\nwrote to Sweden. We wrote to England, to Australia, to Switzerland, Austria,\nGermany, to what they call the villa-goot-mach-home (ph), in case he survived he\nmight be collecting rent from German government. So we wrote to Israel, to\nAvrasham (ph), wrote to Israel, different offices there. The Israeli Historical\nDocumentation Office who's Director is a friend of mine from Vienna. And when |\nwrote him about the whole situation, he put every motion he could, the German\nConsulate is a personal friend, so he is very much assisting him in trying to, Red\nFelix Horn 49\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 49\nCross, International Cross, , you name it, everything that's\nknown to maybe get some help from, we wrote to them. As a matter of fact we just\ndedicated a plague for my parents in our Temple. My parents, my sister. And we\nare already reserving a plague for her parents, her brother, when this come about.\nSo | eliminated his name from it. We only sent for her parents, we know they\nperished. And we still hope maybe we'll find him, but it is a very difficult part now,\nhow to find him? He might have changed his name. He might be dead by now. He\ncould be now sixty-some years old, 1933, he would be 63 years old. He could have\ndied, natural causes. He could change his name to a different name. Maybe he\nchanges religion, does not want to have nothing to do with Judaism. | mean, there's\nvery, all these remote possibilities that we don't know. But we don't lose hope. We\ndo everything we can. We will go anyplace. My wife doesn't want to go back to\nPoland, she would go to Poland right now if she would find something. So we're just\nkeeping our hands and our hearts open, that maybe he's alive and hopefully, all\nthose years that we wasted not doing nothing about him because, in 1945 we\nregistered in Poland and also they knew where we are and so on, and there was no\ninformation. The Communists did on purpose, did not provide any communication\nwith people that survived the war. They didn't want that, see? So all the notes that\nFelix Horn 50\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 50\nwere left in Poland, in the different offices and so on, | understand they were\ndestroyed by the Communists, you know? So nobody will find out that, you know?",
        "Q: How long ago was it that you saw this list with his name on it? Was it this year?",
        "A: It was about one year. We see each other quite often now. The twin brother of\nthe young lady?",
        "Q: Yeah, but you saw this list that showed the brother's name on it. How long ago\nwas that?",
        "A: Oh, he mailed to us from Warsaw recently, about a month ago or so.",
        "Q: Oh, just a month ago?",
        "A: Yeah. And we started everything about a month ago. And my son, through the\nInternet, he's a computer wizard, found some 11 people from that concentration\ncamp. And we've called them long distance, some are from New York, some from\nAnnapolis, some are from Michigan, but they never knew him. They did not know\nhim. They were older people, he was a little boy at that time. But it's obvious he\nsurvived because his name appear as a registered person in 1946. Unless, by\nsheer coincidence, the same first name, last name, Roman Kolvolski (ph) is\nidentical with his false papers were, not false, they were real papers, but on an Arian\nname. We got it through the Polish underground, for a young boy who died and\nthey never recorded a death. So the birth certificate could be used again by Polish\nFelix Horn 51\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 51\nunderground to save people. That's how we got the birth certificate, from my wife's\nlittle brother. So it's possible that someone else had the same first name, last\nname. The same year of birth? That would be such a coincidence. So we firmly\nbelieve that he's alive. Or he was alive anyway, we have to find out. So we do the\nbest we can. We just got a letter from Sweden, our friend who puts ads in\nnewspapers, and the Jewish organization there, and so far nothing. So, so far we\nsee no answers to it yet. But we're not losing hope.",
        "Q: So that was just a month ago. After all this time, all these years, | mean it must\nmake you feel a lot of emotions | would imagine?",
        "A: No question about it, no question about it. We don't give up hope. We live with\nhope all our lives. That's what brought us where we are right now. If not hope, of\ncourse, probably would take a gun and shoot myself. Why everybody was being\nkilled, you know?",
        "Q: Does it make you feel any regret or sadness that maybe he was around all this\ntime? You just didn't know it?",
        "A: Yes, guilt feelings. | feel very guilty, yeah. | feel guilty that, but searching my\nmind, logically thinking, | don't know what | could have done. We did leave traces of\nour life, our names, where we are going to be, where we are and so on. And that's\nall we could have done. My wife found her Uncle by accident. One of our students\nFelix Horn 52\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 52\nwas on a train in Austria and sitting on the bench with somebody, they found out,\noh, where are you from? Oh, I'm from Vienna. But you don't speak, you're German\nis with an accent. Says, yes, I'm not Viennese born. Said, so what country are you\nfrom? Poland. Oh, I'm from Poland too. So, you know, that talking to each other\nturns out one was a_ survivor of concentration camp. That was\nour group. So he says, what town are you from? So he told\nhim. I'm a student. What towns are the students from? So he said, mentioned\nseveral towns that, Warsaw, Lublin, Lublin. | had a cousin that use to be in Lublin,\nthen she live in Warsaw. So the student says, what's her name, do you remember\nher name? He didn't remember her name. So he said, I'll tell you, we only have\none couple from Lublin. Her name is, he mentioned my wife's name. He almost\nfainted. It's her cousin. My wife found a cousin from Warsaw who survived the\nconcentration camp. He was on a train going from Germany, from one town to\nanother town, by accident run into this student who is part of our group of students,\nand that's how we found out each other. And since that time, through him, my wife\nfound out she has an Aunt in New York. He knew about the Aunt because his\nmother was the sister of the Aunt in Europe. It was very close, you understand? So\nmy wife found out through the cousin that, he's still alive, in New York, of course we\nare in contact with him, not as much as we should maybe but we are. He's very,\nFelix Horn 53\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 53\nvery ultra, ultra orthodox and we're not as religious so it doesn't fit his philosophy\nyou know, but he was very helpful to us and still a family. It's her cousin. I'm sure\nmy wife would tell you more details about him in her statements, okay?",
        "Q: Well | wish you luck. | hope you're able to...",
        "A: We are praying, we hope that we will.",
        "Q: Let's go back to you're story. You're first child is born in Rochester in, | forget\nwhich year that you said?",
        "A: Gerald David Horn. Then my daughter was Linda Sue Horn. She was born in\nBuffalo, New York. She was born May 13, on Mother's Day at that time, it was\nMother's Day, May 13 in 1956. So she's, that's 40 years old now. Well we slowly\ngaining ground and creating a family. We feel more secure. | had a job, | was\nworking in a hospital. My wife was a full-time homemaker. Two kids now. She was\nthree weeks old, she had pneumonia, she was hospitalized, we were scared we\nwould lose her and so on, but things got to be fine. One negative aspect of my\nrelationship in America with some of the landlords is when she was born, it was in\nMay, he turned off the heat. It was cold in Buffalo. Very cold. It was very cold, and\n| come home with a newborn baby. She caught a cold. And I'm not trying to blame\nour landlord for it. It was cold, the viruses, you know? But the temperature was\ndefinitely below the normal. Normally people use to have their places heated at that\nFelix Horn 54\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 54\ntime. And when | complained, couldn't you heat our apartment with my newborn\nbaby that's just come home, she was a little low weight, he said, no, no. | need\nyou're apartment now because my family is coming and we need an apartment so |\nwant you to move out anyway. So | thought I'd wait until you're baby maybe gets\nslightly bigger than | want to approach you on it anyway. So | seen there's no point\ndiscussing things so | found an apartment not too far, through my friends and so on.\nVery lovely apartment. They were American Polish people, not Jewish, that\nnobody want to take a newborn baby in at that time. And they were the only people.\n| was knocking the doors, from door to door. They accepted us with a newborn\nbaby. Until today, they are just like, my daughter still call them my grandma. She's\nnow, for eight years, this lady now, she lost her husband in the meantime. We lived\ndownstairs, they lived upstairs. Like a family together. And they, we worship them,\nuntil today, she's a widow now. Were trying to assist her a little bit, we help her.\nShe remarried but they are up in age, sick and so on. So we, they are our dear, not\nonly benefactors, but friends. They're on the weddings with the kids, her children,\nSO we are good friends until today. As a matter of fact, when Washington D.C. on\nour testimony for the Museum, we invited by her daughter, this lady from Buffalo,\nwho lives near Washington, her mother's there, and stay with us for a few days.\nShe was raising our Linda, my daughter. So we are very close with them, yeah. So\nFelix Horn 95\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 55\nafter a few years in Buffalo, three years or so, it was about 1959, 1960, | had to take\nby Boards, | didn't have a license yet. | worked in the hospital, that's all. So | was\nstudying and there were two States. Not each state approved . . .[End of Side 1 of\nTape 2]. . . foreign graduates at that time. Don't forget, this was a time after the\nwar. American physicians were in the Army and they needed doctors here so they\nwanted all the doctors in the hospital, because there was no one to serve in the\nhospital, there were not enough doctors. So when | worked in the hospital in Buffalo\nthey didn't want to let me go either. But | didn't want to build a future working in the\nhospital until one day they won't need you no more, | want to be on my own. So |\nhad to take, make the license anyway. Besides time legally would have changed\nand | wouldn't get a license to even work in a hospital, which eventually turned out\nto be so. So | decided to quit the hospital. | was studying. And two states were\naccepting foreign graduates, which one was Ohio and one was Illinois. So |\nthought, well, let me take a trip to Chicago, take a look. | came to Chicago, | fell in\nlove with Chicago. | was on Lake Shore. | remember staying in a hotel on La Salle\nStreet. And | just looked around, a beautiful city. Downtown was beautiful. State\nStreet was beautiful in those days. Different than now. And | was given a letter of\nrecommendation by one of my colleagues, a doctor in Buffalo, to one of the doctors\nin another family, personal friends in Chicago, so | had someone to talk to at least.\nFelix Horn 56\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 56\nSo | called them up and became friends right away. Both of them were from Poland\ntoo so it made me feel more close at home, more or less. One physician was\npracticing already here. The other party, he was a CPA. And they introduced me to\ntheir pediatrician, an American born, and so | make already a few acquaintences.\nJust being a visitor to Chicago. | fell in love with Chicago. | said, that's the city |\nwant to. | went back home. | started studying very hard and in 1959, forgot what\nmonth, October | think, | came to Chicago to take my exams, my Board. And while\ntaking my exams, | seen somebody from a distance, during the intermission, that |\nthought | seen a ghost. And | screamed spontaneously, not thinking, his first name.\nHis name was Bolick (ph). \"Bolick (ph)?\" The person jumped, turned around, didn't\nknow who called him because he changed his name for many years already.\nNobody knew his name, except | did because he was my classmate in Lee-boof\n(ph), Lemberg when | was taking first and second in medicine. We roomed together\nin dormitory. | didn't Know he had survived the war. When | approached him, he\nlook at me, he did not know who | was. And | recognized him right away. | said,\n\"Well let me tell you, | won't tell you who | am, but I'll bring some few little facts to\nmaybe wake up you're memory. Do you remember City of Lee-boof (ph),\nLemberg?\" He said, \"Yes.\" He knew that | was somebody that, | Knew him. And\nhe was pale like he was going to faint. And | was so emotionally upset and I, myself\nFelix Horn of\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 57\n| didn't know how to behave. And | wouldn't let him get away from me, | was just\nhugging him and he hugged me but he didn't know whom he was hugging. Finally |\ntold him who | was. He couldn't believe it. He didn't recognize me. He hugged me\nand kissed me and so on. Turned out he lives in the South someplace, in the South\nsomeplace, in the | think, someplace. Birmingham, Alabama, that's\nwhere it was, yeah. And he come in here to take his Board, same as | did. Well\nanyway, I'd like to tell you, he passed the Boards too. He moved to Chicago. |\ncame back home. | gathered my family and | said to them, we are moving to\nChicago. But before that | have to go back to Chicago, find a place for us. So | was\nintroduced to a few other doctors, different hospitals here. Edgewater Hospital is\none of them. Some of them were looking for a partner. | had a license, | felt very\ngood. | felt very secure. That's the most important paper in my life. And they, no\none wanted to be my partner. But | was so naive, | didn't know you need lawyers,\nwrite a contract, all those things. His word was fine for me, you know? And | move\nmy family to this area on the basis of his promise, his word, that's all. His office was\nin the suburb of Chicago, in River Grove. He helped me find myself an apartment in\nElmwood Park, which was about 10 minutes or so, 15 minute drive from his office\nand his house. Nice, third story apartment, two bedrooms, modern, elegant, very\nfine. He promised me a salary. Never heard so much money before, which turned\nFelix Horn 58\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 58\nout to be not that much, but to me it was a lot. And | sign a contract for six months,\nonly | didn't know what I'm going to do, an option, take another six month. And we\nmoved to Chicago. | introduced my wife to those friends that | was introduced to by\nmy friends from Buffalo, this CPA and this other doctor. And right away the ladies\ngot busy and they introduced other ladies from Poland too, so in no time we knew\nSO many people, had so many friends. In the meantime, a new Temple in Emerald\nPark, actually River Forest, found out that we are newcomers and survivors, they\nasked us to join them there. One was Orthodox, the other one was Reform. | didn't\nfeel like joining, further | couldn't afford anything yet. They told me not to worry\nabout it, not to, but | didn't want to go for that. And some of the people came to us,\nvisited us, living in Emerald Park, now our neighbors. Not too many Jewish people\nlived there, mostly Italian, , but they were very nice to us. Everybody\nwas nice. And she introduce us and took my wife to the University and to the\nMuseum. We lived in Vienna, there was nothing but music and Museums, you\nknow, the whole city is nothing but culture. How Nazis could develop in so high a\nsophisticated society as Austria, people are so intelligent. Everybody with a degree.\nThere's no bums there. Everybody had a degree. The guy who was sweeping the\ncity had a University degree. | mean, it was not uncommon that a barber had a\nUniversity degree, but never practiced whatever he was studying. Highly intellectual\nFelix Horn 59\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 59\ncountry. But vicious. They were more vicious, it was vicious Nazis, more than the\nGermans. See? But anyway, she introduced us, this lady from the Synagogue, to\nmany people and so on. In the meantime, | found out that my associate, that | was\nsuppose to be his partner, did not tell me the whole truth. And when | found out\nfrom the hospital, some of my colleagues knew Carl, said, \"You know, we know\nyou're partner very well. Do you have a contract with him?\" | said, \"A contract?\nWhat for? He told me I'm his partner.\u201d He look at me like I'm an imbecile. He said,\n\"What do you mean he told you? How do you know, how long have you known\nhim?\" \"Well, | just met him.\u201d \"You know what? Ask him to sign a contract.\u201d So it\nstarted to dawn on me, maybe | should do that. | talk to my wife. \"Why should |\nsign a contract?\" She said, \"Well, we're living in a legal society today. Maybe that's\nthe right thing to do.\u201d So | approached him. In the meantime, he was taking special\nto residency in anesthesia, | was running the office, the practice. Behind my back\nhe tried to sell the practice to somebody. He told me if | work for him for two years |\ncan take over his practice. | have no money, | couldn't buy nothing. | had nothing.\nAnd the money he promised was good, you know? So, | said, \"I want to sign a\ncontract.\u201d He said, \"Look, | don't want to sign a contract\", he said to me. \"Because |\nmight not like you. You only work for me, what? Two or three months already.\"\nMaybe, what, two or three months, you already know. People like me, | like you're\nFelix Horn 60\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 60\npatients, they like me too. Your busy, we're busy. You don't bother doing night calls\nno more. | do all the night calls. That you told the patient over the phone she has\nflu turned out to be acute gall bladder disease, gall bladder attack, have to wake up\nat 2:00 in the morning, you operate on the patient at night. | do dirty work. |\ndeserve a contract now. Well | don't know if | like you're work. If | don't like you,\nyou'll go the next day. | said, you mean you won't give me ,\nNo, this is something, no. There are plenty of guys like you out there, coming from\nEurope, from South America. There are so many refugee doctors, you know? So |\nsaid, you know what, | have to think it over. | don't care what you do, he says. You\nare working for me now, you're being paid. And he always paid me on time. All ofa\nsudden, one day he got a telephone call from a doctor, are you Dr. Horn? | said,\nyes. You know, funny, because | understand that you are a physician in practice\nwith Dr. So-and-so. | said, yes. He said, because he just approached me. Are you\nplanning to take over the practice? | said, well that's what he told me. After he\nfinishes residency on anesthesia, | am running his practice so he will have income.\nHe's paying a salary on me, but after these two years | am taking over the practice.\n| don't know, he approached me, he wants to sell the practice to me. He want me to\nbuy it. | said, he never said nothing to me like this. No. Why would he do that? He\npromised me the practice. | was so naive. | couldn't believe it. | didn't learn those\nFelix Horn 61\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 61\nthings, the tricks of, in medicine you're not a businessman, we're not businessmen.\nIn medicine you wake up in the middle of the night, they need you, you go there. If\nthey don't pay, they don't pay. So they say, send me a bill, you send a bill, you\nnever collect anyway. Most people don't know. But this was not the issue here.\nSome poor people, | wouldn't let them down because they cannot pay. | mean, this\nwas medicine. And he said, you know, | better, don't touch that thing. Fine. |\nappreciate it, | won't buy it. | want to assure, | won't step on you're toes. When he,\nthis doctor came in that evening to the office after his courses in the hospital, and |\nsaid to him, you know what? | want a signed contract tonight, | said. And then he\nsaid, what about if | don't? Then I'm walking out right now. Right now you're\nwalking out? What are you going to do? He started laughing. | said, don't laugh.\nDon't worry about it. | survived worse thing than this. I'm not worrying about it, |\nhave a license. I'll have my own office. Ha-ha-ha-ha. He started laughing. He\nsaid, you know you cannot start a practice like this today. There are so many\ndoctors coming, you know you're crazy. You'll never survive. | said, well | won't let\nyou worry about it. | worry about myself. And | said good-bye. Next day, he calls\nme. Aren't you going to the office? | said, no. There are people coming in. That's\ntoo bad. Remember what you told me? If you don't like me, next day I'm gone. No\ntwo weeks notice. | told you, | don't like you, I'm gone. Good-bye. My God, this\nFelix Horn 62\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 62\nwas it. | went to the hospital that | was on staff and | told the Director that | am no\nmore an associate of this given doctor. He said, oh we know all about it. | was\nsurprised less than three months. So | said, what should | do then? | mean, | would\nlike to open my own practice. Yeah, but see if you open your own practice, you\nhave to re-apply to the staff again. And you are on your own. Before you only were\naccepted because you are an associate of Dr. so-and-so. But I'll have some use for\nyou, see. In order to be accepted that will cost you $25,000.00. | said, | don't have\nthat kind of money. | only worked three months, | barely pay my rent. Well, I'm\nsorry then. You cannot be accepted. Forget about bothering with application. You\nwouldn't believe it. | learned the American reality in medicine from then on. | was\ngoing from hospital to hospital. Like a club, they all wanted the same thing.\nLutheran General wanted $20,000.00. Gottlieb (ph) wanted $20,00.00. And\nhospital, | won't mention no names, they want no money\nfrom me but the Director of the hospital is a physician. He said, every patient you\nadmit to this hospital, if you are working the emergency room or you are on call,\npeople come in without a doctor, they call you. If you wiggle up to that patient, you\npay me half, whatever comes from that patient. | said, what? | never heard this\nbefore. What do you mean? For what? Pay you for what? Are you going to work\nwith me on that patient? No, no, you don't understand. We do you a favor. You're\nFelix Horn 63\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 63\ngoing to get into a given situation, you'll have to wait for a patient. You be patient,\nright away, you go work the emergency room. A patient would come in. Whatever\ncomes to me, hospitalize, the fee is going to be $200.00, you pay me $100.00. |\nsaid, well how am | going to do the taxes? | mean, what do you mean? Why? |\ndon't understand it. Well, you'll learn fast. That's what it is. Think it over, let me\nknow. | quit. What | did, | moved away from the whole area | was before. | didn't\nwant no one accusing me of being a competitor, so | worked in a strange street on\nHarlem Avenue, near between Edison and Belmont. It was a brand new medical\noffice. | see it empty. | knock at the door, walked in. The Director was an American\ndentist, Dr. DeRome (ph) of French ancestry or so. | introduced myself. | told him\nthe whole story. | am anewcomer to Chicago, | don't know a soul here. | am not on\nstaff at the hospital anymore. | was, | told him, | worked three months for another\ndoctor, which | was very disappointed. | would like to open an office. | have no\nmoney to pay for rent. Not now. | have no patients either. And | was wondering,\nmaybe if you listen to my story, maybe you can help me? A man | never met\nbefore. No one introduced me to him, | just Knocked at the door. He had seven\nsuites in the building. A brand new building. Only two offices were taken. And his\nwas the third. There were four vacant. What do you want? Take a look at the\noffices. Which office do you want? | said, well wait a minute. We have to make\nFelix Horn 64\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 64\nsome financial understanding. How is it going to be? He said, well you told me.\nYou don't have any money. So | said, well, so what are you going to do? Well | will\nlet you work until you can make some money. | said, but | don't know how long it\nwill take me. | don't have no patients, | don't Know anybody. If you have no money\nyou're not going to pay me. And you be the one to decide what you can pay me. |\ndidn't believe what | hear. A man | never met before. He liked me. | liked him right\naway. He was like a father image to me. | was young. | was 39, this was 1960, |\nwas 40. And he was, maybe at that time, maybe 75 or so. And | picked out that\noffice. And he advised me, | will do it for you. The local paper, he put a note with\nmy picture in it. A new doctor and the . You were allowed no\nadvertisement in those days. Now you can advertise. Only to introduce you, an\nintroduction type of a thing. Family practice, general practitioner and my picture. |\nwas suppose to open the office 1st of September. The middle of August, after | left\nthe other office, two days later, from the old office | worked from, my other doctor,\nthere was a pharmacist next door to it. The Chief Pharmacist, the owner, calls me.\nDr. Horn, | have many patients from this doctor's office, asking about what\nhappened to you, where are you? And | don't know what to do. | said, how did you\nfind me there? Well, | have my ways. | am here, am |? I'm talking to you. | found\nyou, right? | said, yes, you did. | read in the paper. You put ad in the paper,\nFelix Horn 65\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 65\nintroductory? Yeah. So he says, | know where you are. But what schedule, can |\ntell them? | said, no, | don't think so because then he will accuse me of taking his\npatients away. Look, but they are not going back to him. They told me that. They\ngo to a different doctor. Might as well to, they like you, they want to come stay with\nyou. | said, okay. | didn't have no furniture yet. | had one chair and my satchel\nbag. That's all | had, one chair. And like making house calls, you know, you don't\nneed much, just you're bag. Stethoscope, all you're little instruments you got there,\nyou know, percussion hammer and tongue depressor and ;\nokay? All those things | had, so | put the patient on the chair and | had my bag on\nthe floor, that's how | started. | had a big window there so mostly | looked through\nthe window, looking at the traffic. Nothing else. The patient paid me. | didn't have\nno stationary, nothing yet. That's how it started. Well making a long story short, in\nthree months | was so busy | didn't know what to do with myself. | was so\noverworked. My colleague doctor, asked me to make for\nthem, they are too busy making house calls. So I'm making\nfor them. | had people pay a nursing homes, so Sundays and Wednesdays on my\nday off | was making calls at nursing homes. Nights, | was delivering babies and at\nnights | was making house calls and so on. People are in wheelchairs, they couldn't\ncome to the office. It was nothing urgent, of course. | picked my times. | will do it\nFelix Horn 66\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 66\nWednesdays or Sundays or at night, you know, when | have time. And they were\ngrateful that | come in because their doctor would prescribe over the telephone. |\nwas taught never do that. You make one mistake you will be regretting it and it was\ntrue. | felt if they have no money to pay, that's fine. But | have to make a house call\nto see them, to treat them. | would not treat them over the phone. Even if | knew\nthe people, you don't know what's wrong over the phone, they talk a different story.\nYou cannot treat on the symptoms, you have to find out what's wrong with them.\nAnd after three months, | was so busy, one day, who knocks on my door? Uncle\nSam. IRS. They want to see my books. What happened? | took a trip to Europe\nfor six weeks and on the cruise | never felt how do rich people feel? You go ona\ncruise? | drove to New York, | had a new Oldsmobile, convertible. | left the car in a\nparking garage there on a pier, they do this specially. | boarded the ship, Gilda\nFrance, a new French boat. If paradise were something as close as this was then\nwe're in heaven. And when | come back, my colleague said, Felix, you Know, we\nthought you were a smart kid. But you're stupid. You work three months, you took\noff for six weeks, you destroyed everything you made it. American people don't like\nthat. That's a on them. | said, wait a minute, | didn't offend\nnobody. | left another doctor, a colleague of mine, in the next building. He was\nwilling to see my patients and he didn't have nobody to cover for him so we cover\nFelix Horn 67\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 67\neach other now. So he said, they are going to my colleague. | said, | know\n. Well, | came back, you know what? | could not cover all\nmy patients, they call me, | was so busy. Uncle Sam went through my books. The\nonly thing that cost me is my CPA, my accountant because he costs me $500.00 at\na time, you had to take them out for dinner or lunch or something, it costs me\n$500.00, his time he spend with them going over my books. And this only time was\nchecked by IRS since 1950, forty-six years in this country. | worked. Every penny\nwas accounted to it. | am one of the biggest American patriots. | am one of, on this\nblock right here that you see, I'm the only European born, American citizen, a real\npatriot who has flag out. And then he'll leave holidays, no. But I've got to tell you, |\nwas busy, | practice, you know. My life was good to me. I'm glad what! got | got on\nmy own. | have cherished memories of my wife's family, Uncle and every\nsupportive to us. They help me buy my first house. They give me $5,000.00 on\naccount of it. | didn't want to take the money from them so they give us a loan and\nthey said, listen, if it takes you a year, two, three, five to pay back, fine. No interest\ncharged. They didn't charge me interest. | didn't want it even, but with two kids, you\nknow. It was hard with kids to find apartments, so on. So! buy a house. That's the\nonly house we owned. That's the house we bought in 1960.",
        "Q: This house?\nFelix Horn 68\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 68",
        "A: This house, yeah. We raised two kids here in this house. And we believed that\neducation was of utmost importance. All of us, the whole family, even my daughter-\nin-law, son-in-law, all University graduates. My son is a physician, he's a top notch\nspecialist and he's an ophthalmologist, laser specialist. My daughter, Northwestern\nUniversity graduate cum laude. Both my kids. And my daughter-in-law is a\nPodiatrist. My son-in-law is a Doctor of Philosophy, he's a Director, works for the\nState, Director of School Systems. You know? And we have four grandchildren\nnow. I'll be married now 54 years December, on the 13th of December, fifty-four\nyears married to the same girl. We are very happy, very happy family. My kids are\nmy best friends and | know | am their best friend. And | achieved what | wanted to.\nThe only regret that | have, my parents. They never lived to see it, you know?\nThat's still the problem. And now, of course, hopefully we'll find maybe my wife's\nlittle brother. We'll look for little brother, little brother. He\nwas with us. We feel guilty because we let him go. But when the streets, we had\nnothing, no place to go. When you can be shot any minute and find us, anyone\nmoving on the street at dark, you know, they are going to\nstop, no arrest. They kill you. There was no one below us on the street, you know,\nso we knew. And this looked so prime, we wanted to go with him, but they wanted\n$1,000.00 per person from us. We didn't have that money so we couldn't go. Do\nFelix Horn 69\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 69\nyou believe that, that doesn't sound real. And the only reason, how he went,\nbecause the person in charge there, a German SS or somebody, his mistress was\nmy wife's girlfriend from school. And she took him with her. We knew that Sadie,\nshe goes there. We knew that's safe. But everybody wanted to get in there.\nEverybody went there. If you had money you went there. And people who had no\nmoney like us, they didn't accept us, so we didn't go.",
        "Q: Yes. Let's say for the record here that this story and all is in you're video, so if\npeople ever want to go back and get the whole story, you and you're wife both tell it\nin you're video. So | just wanted to put that on the record. Let me ask you a couple\nof things. Are you retired now?",
        "A: Well | retired from private practice already ten years, exactly two days ago, on\nthe 15th of August, which was ten years | retired. See, | was witnessing the\ntransformation of American medicine since | started to what it is right now. And |\ndidn't see eye to eye wants going on. And | have to live with that. And | don't think |\ncould stomach it. | could not understand it. | could not live with myself to, | was 26\nyears in practice, and | want to walk out with my head straight. | don't want to lie to\nmy patients. If | had to lie to my patients, they cannot be hospitalized, or if they are\nin the hospital, to be kicked out of the hospital sooner than | would expect to, | had\nto lie to them, that they are ready to go. Because officially, it's not the truth. And |\nFelix Horn 70\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 70\nfelt that sooner or later something is going to happen to them and | said, look, my\nson is married, he's in practice. My daughter is married. And so, it's only me and\nmy wife, the two of us. We have a home, a little home. For the two of us, it's more\nthan enough. So, why should I? In the meantime, some of my competitors, a\nyoung woman, spread the rumor that | want to sell the practice, to create a panic in\nmy patients. And | had no intention yet, at that time. | was just toying with the idea,\nbut one day a patient called me, he said, Dr. Horn, is it true you're selling you're\npractice? You're quitting? | said, who told you that? Oh, Kathy, my neighbor goes\nto Dr. so-and-so and this doctor, a woman doctor, told her. | said, no that's not true.\nLet me find out why she say that. And | approached this woman doctor and she\ndenied it at first, but finally she admitted it. She heard some patient said something,\nwhatever, she wanted to buy my practice. So you know, it gave me the idea,\nmaybe it's the right thing to do. And that's what crystallized, one night | talked to my\nwife, | said, you know what? What do we need it for? By the time | get home to eat\ndinner, 11:00 at night. | never see my kids growing up. | was too busy. | had to, |\ndidn't have nobody else. We had no parents, grandparents, nobody to take care of\nthem. We had three or four babysitters and my wife was a babysitter all the time\nbecause she was a homemaker full time. Until the kids grew up, then she went to\nUniversity also. She will tell you her story herself. Right here in Chicago, she\nFelix Horn 71\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 71\ngraduated from the University. When the kids were going to school, she asked her\nMom, let me see you're grades. | thought maybe it\u2019s the right thing to do. And | hit\nthe jackpot. Why? | have heard the hospital. | asked them, I'm ready to quit\npractice here. A hospital use to buy practices. They want to get the patients. |\nbelonged to two hospitals at that time. One in Displanes (ph), Catholic Hospital,\nwhich always was good in Catholic surroundings. And the other one, in City, was\nold. You have to go to Northwest Hospital in the city. We should have the best\nreputation, but resurrection to cover this hospital. So | approached the hospital and\nthey want to buy my practice. Thinking that by this, there was some restrictions at\nthat time with Media-care, they thought more patients would come and they would\nfill up the hospital so they can survive. Because many hospitals closed up, they\ncouldn't survive. So they bought my practice and they sold everything. They sold\nmy practice, my equipment, my accounts receivable, my building. American\nTelephone and Wire wanted to buy my clinic too. Not for medical purposes, the\nlocation was something they needed. The size of it's . But |\nsaid, | cannot sell the physical plan without the interior because all my money is in\nthe records and so on. My patients, you know? So | didn't sell it to them, but the\nhospital bought it. | did very well, invested some money and so on. And I'm more\ncomfortable. After two months in being home, not doing nothing, my other hospital\nFelix Horn 72\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 72\nin the found out and | am one of the founders, the Holy\nFamily Hospital in Desplains (ph). To this dentist, my benefactor at the office, who,\nhis family lived in Displanes (ph), he said, Dr. Horn, | will send you to the hospital\nand they will ask you for no money. And it was true. Jewish Hospital's want money\nfrom me. They didn't care if | starve or not. Catholic Hospital gave me an\nopportunity. | became a step-member, without a penny. And | am very, very\ndedicated to this hospital. I've done a lot of free work for the hospital, for the poor.\nCatholic charities. Being Jewish, | admit who | am. They all know about it. Our\nChairman of Private Practice, , that's a Jewish doctor and\nthere are not too many Jewish doctors in those days. Now there are more. | feel\ngood there. So! worked at Hospital. So they found out. They said, Felix, we have\na Clinic in Wheeling, it belongs to our hospital. We lost one of our doctors, just\ndecided to quit. And we know you so we don't have to go trial and leave, you want\nto start tomorrow, you're welcome to. Not only this, but we would appreciate if you\ncould help us out. | said, | don't know...\nEnd of Tape 2\nFelix Horn 73\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 73\nTape 3",
        "A: .. . if | want to walk-in clinic. | was use to my, the loyalty of my patients. Walk-in\nclinic is like a clinic, people walk in with a chip on their shoulder, you don't know who\nthey are, what they want. Drug addicts and they want dope and all these things,\nyou know? | was not looking for work at this time, not in this stage of the game.\nAnd now | was comfortable, financially and so on. But | was, | missed the contact.\nHuman contact. | missed it. | never told my wife that, but | delivered 4,500 babies\nin family practice. | have babies that grew up, that we were invited recently to their\nweddings, that | delivered. And my mother told me once, Dr. Horn, we use to live\nwith my daughter, she told me that if you ever live long enough and my daughter\ngets married and if you be invited to the wedding, you'll come. Well the moment of\ntruth is here. She is getting married and we want you there. We were there. Let\nme tell you. There's no money paid for the emotions for everything we went\nthrough. Three hundred people. The standing ovations. | am met by some\npatients, friends of my former patients too. That you know is worth it. All those\nyears and sleepless nights, no food. Not food because you can have no time to eat\nmany times. And it was, money didn't mean that much. But that retribution, that\ncontribution in the human emotions, you know, what | got back for it paid me for\neverything, everything. | am very grateful for that and that's my pay back. And |\nFelix Horn 14\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 74\nsaid, that's okay, I'll go to the clinic. But you know what? I'll maybe work with a chip\non my shoulder because | know something about clinics, you know? But this is not\nclinic someplace in the South side here or so, its not in a suburb and so on, and you\nknow what? | liked that. | liked it, | worked for five years. They closed the clinic up\nfor five years, there were five doctors there. | recommend some of my colleagues\nto work there. | was the only one they transferred to the Hospital proper, they\nopened the same thing in the Hospital. And they let the other doctors go. |'m still\nworking there. So | work on a part-time basis for the clinic. In the meantime, the\nhospital needed somebody to do what we call utilization review. Which is exactly\nwhat | touched up on before, in that we check on patients unjustly hospitalized,\nunnecessarily. Meaning that they could have it done, the treatment, as out-patient.\nX-ray of the stomach, you don't have to be in the hospital to have an x-ray of the\nstomach, but in old days you were hospitalized because insurance paid only if you\nwere in the hospital. Otherwise, they don't pay no x-rays. So older people didn't\nwant to go into hospital, that's why insurance companies knew, if this old lady wants\nto go to the hospital, | mean she's probably sick or she deserves that, right? But\ntoday is different. You might be very sick but as long as you can do it as an out-\npatient, they do as an out-patient. So | am like a medical policeman now. | am\nchecking the records of other physicians, looking at the quality care issues. Looking\nFelix Horn 75\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 75\nif they are justly hospitalized or if they are unnecessarily staying in the hospital after\nthey did this job with their doctor. It happens quite often. Not to the fault of the\nhospital or the doctor, fault of the families. It\u2019s a big, legal type of a component\ninvolved here, that the family is using legal track as a blackmail. Three daughters\nhave a mother in the hospital. The doctor discharged her, goes to nursing home.\nThey cannot decide which nursing home. $600.00 a day costs the room. She could\nbe in a nursing home already, the hospital will give you 24 hours to decide which\nhome. But one says one home, the other one wants the other home. Meanwhile\ni's four days already, nothing done for the patient. And Medi-care doesn't pay for\nthe bill because nothing has been done. The hospital is loosing money. So we\nenter here, talk to the family. Look, we're sorry, you have to take you're mother to,\notherwise you are liable for the bill now, from that day on, nothing done for you're\nmother because you argue which nursing home you want to take. What's you're\ndecision? The day will come, | know, the girl is going to tell them which nursing\nhome to go to. Now you have a choice here. No, no, no. One day her death.\nWhat do you mean? We're going to talk to my attorney, talking to my lawyer. Say\nlook, | am in a official government position here, this medical position, and | am not\nafraid of a lawyer. | don't do nothing illegal. You do something illegal. You demand\nsomething which doesn't belong to you no more. You're spending government's\nFelix Horn 76\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 76\nmoney. There are taxpayers money being paid for you're mother, that she could be\nin a nursing home that costs a fraction of it. But Medi-care is going to pay for extra\nmonths at least. And this kind of a thing, you know, you got a lot of hostility,\nconfrontation type of situations with people. But that's part of life. | get use to it. It's\na job and | think I'm doing the right thing. | do not like what's going on. Even when |\ndo that, doesn't mean | approve it.",
        "Q: Yeah. We can, after we're done with this interview, we can have our own private\ndiscussion, the way the health care system is going. | want to ask you some other\nthings, just based on you're experience. You had two children in the \u201850's and now\nthey are grown, or whatever. And you are, you and you're wife are both survivors of\nthe Holocaust. I'm wondering when and how did you first talk about that with you're\nchildren? How did it come up? How did they learn you're story? What, how do you\nfeel that you're relationship with you're children, how did that effect it, if it did\u2019?",
        "A: When we moved to Chicago it was about 1960. We moved to Chicago, my son\nwas eight years old at that time. We moved to this house. He made friends with a\nlittle boy across the street, across the alley. We don't know, an alley actually, but it\nuse to be an alley there. Sunday they were playing together. The same age and\nthey are friends until today, all those years. One is in a different city right now, but\nanyway, we were friends. We cling to people easily because, | don't know, maybe\nFelix Horn 77\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 77\nwe are more extrovert. Is it because of the war? | don't know. | constantly say to\nmyself, how would | be if not for the war? But one episode stuck to my mind. That\none Sunday afternoon, maybe 4 or 5 PM, his name was Mickey, the little boy was\nMickey. His parents, American-Polish decent, American born. They were playing.\nAll of a sudden, my boy, eight years old, comes and started crying. | said, why are\nyou crying? What happened? Sunday, | was home. | play with Mickey. So what\nhappened? Did he hit you? No, he didn't hit me. Well, why are you crying? Well\nhe had to go away, he says. Why are you crying? He had to go away, where is he\ngoing? He's going to his grandpa. For dinner. His parents, his two sisters and him\nare going. And | want to go to grandpa for dinner too. | said, well, you cannot go to\nhis grandpa because you don't know them and they don't know you. You don't\nexpect to be invited. He was an eight year old kid, pretty smart and understands\nsomeone. He says, where's my grandpa? That's how it started. Until then he\nnever asked for it. | would never talk to him about it. And that's how it started. So |\ntold him that we have some pictures of my grandfather and you're grandfather,\nyou're Mom's father. And we have pictures of the grandparents, my parents and\nher parents. The only picture | don't have is my sister's. Didn't have it. So | show\nhim the pictures and he asked what happened. He couldn't understand, what mean\nNazis and so on. But! told him they perished during the war, they were killed by\nFelix Horn 78\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 78\nmean people, German people, Nazis, by Nazis. He asked what are Nazis? So |\ntold him, but he did not comprehend too much of it, you know? But he knew they\nwere dead, he knew what death means, being, going to the funerals and so on. So\nhe more or less was satisfied for a while only. But this was coming up more often\nthan, again, ask the same question, why can't | see my Aunt or my grandma? And |\nsaid, well, they are not alive no more. Where is this, which cemetery are they\nburied? | said, well, there's no cemetery. He says, what do you mean? How do\nyou be dead and not be buried? So how are you going to explain to a youngster\nlike this, you perish and you have no place to worship the grave. So | told him that\nin those days there were mean people in Germany. They tried to kill all the Jews\nand they killed my parents and you're Mom's parents and my sister and they didn't\nbury them they burned them to ashes. And what they made out of ashes were\ndifferent things, fabrics, and they made soap and so on. And he couldn't\nunderstand it. And this would go on for many, a few years until he was maybe, 14,\n13 or 14, that's what really penetrated what happened. But interesting, since that\ntime, when we made our testimony at the Holocaust Museum in Washington, my\nson and my daughter all have their own copies. We have one. My son has three\ncopies. My daughter, they had three volumes. And they didn't want to talk about it\nno more. But he became such an anti-Nazi. He just, it's had that influence on him,\nFelix Horn 79\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 79\nthat injustice was done to his grandparents, that he never met, that he missed in his\nyouth, you know? Because the happiness is, if Mom don't want to give it, ask you're\ngrandma. There's some, even T-shirts, seeing the writing on the, on that. If you're\nparents are too strict with you, you're grandparents always allow you to do what you\nwant to do. And he always felt that he missed something on it, you know, he\nmissed out. But then he would never talk about it, he never wanted to touch the\nsubject at all.",
        "Q: When did he stop talking about it with you? When he was younger or recently?",
        "A: No, no, no. We didn't talk about the subject since he was about 14, 15, | would\nsay. He knew all about it, since that time he is quite acquainted, politically\norientated with what he knows all about, he knows Holocaust, and he was in\nWashington. And my daughter was recently again with my wife in Holocaust\nMuseum, so they are acquainted. He does not want to discuss it. He refused to\ntalk about it because he has, he tells me, | said why don't you want to talk about it?\nl, as a victim of the system, | feel strong enough to face up, to talk about it. | break\ndown here and there if | talk about some things. Mainly if | talk about my parents.\nUnbelievable relationship | had with my parents, unbelievable. But | think we have\nthe same relationship, with me and my children. And he's said, you know Dad, I'll\nlook at those tapes after you have passed away. | won't touch them as long as\nFelix Horn 80\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 80\nyou're with us, | don't want to look at it. | want to enjoy every minute of it, at present.\nAnd all of a sudden, on his own initiative, he elected to have a father/son once a\nmonth dinner. Father/son only. Me and him going after work or some meeting,\ntogether, without his family, without my family, only me and him. | think what\ntriggered the whole thing is one of my personal friends recently passed away, also a\nsurvivor, from Germany, a German Jew. And his son is my son's best friends. And\nthe trauma that his friend, the son of my friend, went through made my son realize\nhow fragile is life. Don't take it for granted. We're here today, and don't know how\nlong. And he wanted to enjoy my presence, our presence, as long as he lives. He\ndoesn't want to tarnish anything with any bad memories, anything, what will come\nup with the discussions and so on. He knows the history. He knows the story of our\nsurvival. He has the tapes in his possession. So sooner or later, he is just delaying\nthe truth. Although he knows the truth, but he's not ready to face up to it. And | am\nnot pushing it. | don't know if | am right or wrong, but | think it would be wrong trying\nto push something that he's not ready to accept right now. He knows the truth, he\nknows that. And he knows what he lost in his childhood by missing his\ngrandparents. Nobody came back. There's no way we can replace it. | miss it too.\nMore, because it was not my grandparents, | miss my parents. | was 17 when | lost\nthem. | was not ready for an independent life. And he knows that, so he's fortunate,\nFelix Horn 81\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 81\nhe's older. He is now 43, 44. He's an adult man. But he doesn't want to face up to\nit. And I'm not going to disturb that kind of a status quo.",
        "Q: Okay. You know, I've read some in the past, some books of, sort of biographies\nof Holocaust survivors and families. And in some families the situation has resulted\nin some forms of tension, you know, where the children feel an extra burden\ntowards their parents. And in some cases, the parents, because of all they've lost,\nyou know?",
        "A: How would you explain this? | mean, | am at a loss to understand that.",
        "Q: Well, you know, every family is different and different people react in different\nways. When people interact, anything can happen really. It sounds like, from what\nyou're describing, this is, nothing like this has ever come up here.",
        "A: No, never. As a matter of fact, | did expect maybe there would be pity or a little\nsorrow with what | had to go through. My children, our children, consider us heroes.\nAnd | told them, I'm not a hero. Whatever | did to survive was not deliberate. It\nwas pure accidental, fate, you name it, whatever you want to. | didn't deserve any\nprice for something that | didn't deserve. | didn't. I'm here, but not because | done\nsomething about it. Maybe if | used common sense and logic, maybe | wouldn't be\nhere today. Maybe it was spontaneous and reflexive, | would say. A reflex, you\nknow? Jump instead of stand or sit or so, whatever. | don't know. But my kids\nFelix Horn 82\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 82\nalways, and my personal friends, American friends, my colleague doctor in the\nhospital, they are full of admiration for me. | still, this disturbs me, | don't know why.\n| didn't do nothing to deserve this thing. | am here and | am a very fortunate\nperson. | am here because | cherished life. My whole family since early, youth will\nall cherish life and want to make the best out of it. We try not to waste our life on\nridiculous things. On something that my, life is short. Or even if its long, its not long\nenough. And if you waste you're time in life and do certain things that you might\nregret, you cannot turn the clock back again. So there was one thing that | got from\nmy parents, from my father, he was a strict disciplinarian. And | always respect him\nfor it. And | was penalized many times when | was a kid. | never held it against him\nbecause | always deserved it. Whatever | got | deserved it. He loved me in his own\nway and | knew this was love, that's why he disciplined me and so on. | never\ncomplained. | took it like a man. And | cried when | was little. | cried but | never\ncomplained. And | think it made me more mature, a little harder person maybe,\nmore understanding of other people. It taught me fairness, straightforwardness,\nhonesty. And direct, going right directly in front of you. | never, | always believe,\nthere's no such a thing, | was taught by my Dad, that you cannot achieve in you're\nlife if you badly wanted to. If you badly want to do something in you're life, be\nsomething you want to be, you have to make that effort. Nobody is going to give it\nFelix Horn 83\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 83\nto you. You get all assistance, help, etcetera, yes, but you have to do it yourself.\nDon't expect nobody to give it to you. And always remember to be responsible for\nyour own actions. That's your responsibility, don't blame nobody else for your\nproblems. You cook your own dinner, you make your own life. You go to sleep the\nway you make your bed. That's what I've always taught him, that's so true. | still\nbelieve today, that's what | tried to instill in my children, the same type of a thing.\nAnd | have no regrets. | think | ama very fortunate man. | ama very happy man. |\nlove life. | like my people, an extrovert. | have countless number of friends, all over\nthe world, and | mean literally. Literally, from all over. Australia, South America,\nyou name it, Canada, Europe, all over Europe, Sweden, Italy, Spain. All over\nEngland, we have friends all over Paris, we're going to Paris right now to visit of a\nyoung widow, our personal friends. | mean, it's just like a sister to me. So we\ncreate our own families. That's sort of like a spontaneous, physiological type of a\nreflex. You don't have a family, you make your own family. Many of the kids of our\nfriends call me Uncle Felix. Some call me Papa. Some grandchildren. And | love\nit. That's, my kids call my friends the same way because that's how they grew up\nhere, because there was nobody else. We create our own family. Not by law, by\nour physiological needs. And that can replace, it didn't replace really, but at least it\ndid done something to replace our lost ones, you know? So many of my friends,\nFelix Horn 84\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 84\nAmerican born, don't understand it. They ask me, my colleague , he ask\nme, Felix, tell me, I'm American born, three or four generation. Where did | go\nwrong? | have four sons and nothing but grief. | try to do my best and | think I'm a\ngood parent. My wife is a good mother, and so on. They didn't have to worry about\nnothing, and so on. And nothing but grief. Breaking the law, among other things,\nyou know, | won't go into detail, but tell me one thing? What is it? Where did | go\nwrong? What is it? You came here with nothing, with nobody, no language, no\nfamily, no money, nobody. Look at you're kids, University graduates. And, in the\nmeantime there are a few other doctors, other Jewish doctors, also came from\nIsrael and refugees and so on, look at this. They are all, the kids are educated, they\nare not wealthy people at all. But, what is it? What do you have that we don't\nhave? | don't know what to tell them. | thought fora moment maybe that's why the\nanti-Semitism in some countries is, because of that. In Germany, the professional\nis, the Jewish professionals is the lawyers, the bankers, the doctors and so on.\nMusicians, poets, literary. | mean, people just, was it jealousy? Was it\ncompetitiveness? What is it? | don't know. But it appears to be a certain type of a\ndislike to that person. And that because they are different, different because of\nreligion, they're Jews. That's probably contributed to the rise of anti-Semitism, out\nof other factors of course, the economies and so on. And historically, of course, you\nFelix Horn 85\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 85\nknow, what else is new? This goes back into time of Jesus, so | told him | don't\nknow what to tell you. Maybe |, of course, maybe its from generation to generation.\n| instill my children what | was taught by my parents. | don't know where you fail?\nMaybe if I've got the whole life story in front of me in front of you, or you're parents\nyet, when you grow up, maybe there was something missing there. | don't know. |\nam not a psychologist and | don't understand it myself. I'm asimple person. |ama\nprofessional man, in my line of business, | know what I'm doing, and so on. But this\nis beyond my way of thinking. | cannot explain it, I'm not a psychologist. But there's\nsomething there, maybe genetically, | don't know. Now we're coming back\neveryday reading about those genes here and there so who knows? Maybe they\ncome to it and drug addicts have some defective gene too, | don't Know. Coming\nback now to many Alzheimer's, is not something that you did yourself but its part of\nour physiology, something breaks down and . But as long as\nit lasts my life is beautiful. | am very happy. | do my little part, what | can. | do go\nplaces, Universities, | talk. This summer, | spent most of the summer at Aurora\nUniversity out of Chicago talking to young students about my life story. | am not an\nexpert on Holocaust but | am a victim of the Holocaust and | have the right to tell my\nstory if | want to, if someone wants to listen to it. | won't force myself on nobody. |\nwas invited by the History Department. | have faced up to a hostile audience,\nFelix Horn 86\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 86\nAfrican-American, most of them. Maybe 60 or 70 percent, the rest were white. 19,\n21, 22 years old. Who told me why should, one of the young ladies, African-\nAmerican lady, that upset me, why should | believe your story? Because you say\nso? | said, no. First of all, no one forced me to come here and | didn't force you to\ncome here either. You do believe me or you don't believe me. | cannot convince\nyou of it. You don't even have a number, she said. | said, see it proves how little\nyou know about the Second World War. How much you know about the Holocaust.\nThat's why I'm here, to maybe enlighten you a little bit. | was never in concentration\ncamp to be there long enough to have a number. | was only one night, one\nconcentration camp. They took me to work. | escape right away, like a rabbit. |\nhad no number on it. Well, maybe you're lying. | said, well the only thing you can\ntake is my word for it. If you ask my family tree is very short. Because | am the only\none alive, the oldest one is me. Next is my wife and my children. | don't know\ngrandparents. My wife has no grandparents. No sisters, no brothers. Maybe you\nnever had it. Well, are you going to deny everything? You denied it at the\n. | said, if | will tell you, wait a minute | said, if | would tell you\nthat slavery never existed. Now wait a minute. Did you live at that time when\nslavery was there? You are only 19 or 20 years old. So you didn't live in those\ndays, did you? So you expect me to take you're word for it? Well, it's in all the\nFelix Horn 87\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 87\nbooks. | said, so is the Holocaust. We have pictures of the General Eisenhower's\narmy, from the concentration camps, the corpses lined up, piled up and so on. You\nthink this is... Well that's something you say that's a Jewish publication. | said,\nyou believe that Jews manufactured all those things? You think they would have to\ndo it? See? You are skeptical? | am skeptical too. There was never a slavery.\nOh, no way. Sure there was. | said, so was Holocaust. Take it or leave it. But if\nyou listen to Farrakhan all the time, you find out that you're brains is going to\nbrainwashed. But if you listen to people like me, not only to me, other people like\nme, we don't know each other even. | would tell a similar story. Different in certain\nways because each one survived in different ways, different location, different\nnationality and so on. But it is true. If you don't want to accept it, | am not here to\npenalize you, convince you that it\u2019s the truth. If tell me , itis\nthe truth. This was it.",
        "Q: When was this talk or class?",
        "A: Aurora University, last summer.",
        "Q: Last summer?",
        "A: Yeah. As a matter of fact, they asked me if | come this summer again but | got\nmore work to do now so | have less time, but her name is, the teacher or the\nprofessor's name is Palmer. She talked to me. What happened is there was an\nFelix Horn 88\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 88\nexhibit of a Warsaw ghetto exhibit at University of Aurora. | was commissioned by\none of the sculptors, which is Cop-sure-a-etchie (ph), a woman from Evison (ph),\nAmerican-born, who is doing the exhibit on Warsaw ghetto. Well the debris and\nbreaks and the barb wire and so on. And she wanted someone to tell the story of\nthe background of it, the train, the sound of the trains and the cars taking people,\nthe cattle cars taking them to concentration camps. And if you heard about the Rig-\nla-baum (ph), a diary in Warsaw? He was an activist who was writing day by day\noccurrences in Warsaw ghetto. And he finally buried all his manuscripts in milk\ncans, three milk cans. Two of them were recovered, one is missing. And she\nwanted me to read from his archive, this story from day to day, what transpired at\nWarsaw ghetto. So | ask her, why me? You can have any of the theatre people,\nyou know, actors with their diction and so on to do this. An exceptional job. She\nsaid, no. | want the authentic thing, you were there. And | was in Warsaw ghetto.\nYou were there. You were a witness of it. | want you're accent because its\nauthentic. | don't want a good voice. So she wanted this. So | went there. So |\ntaped this thing and | had to see it and listen to my own voice then. It was really\nimpressive, | say that the whole exhibit. And the history class was coming to visit\nand this Miss Palmer met me there and we talked about it. Signed your name, and\nso on. And it says, the title of it, the exhibit, and then voice by Felix Horn, survivor of\nFelix Horn 89\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 89\nWarsaw ghetto. So she was fascinated with it, she contacted me here and | made\nseveral trips there. And | told her one more time | will be glad to do it again, but\nright now...",
        "Q: I'm curious about that whole encounter you talk about with the young woman\nwho didn't believe the Holocaust. I'm wondering how, when something like that\nhappens, when that's over, how that makes you feel?",
        "A: There were other discussions with other people and very little input from the\nBlack students. More input from the white students. There was input from a white\nman who was standing by, joined the whole thing, nothing to do with the school,\nnothing to do with me, | never met him before. Turned out that he was a Polish, not\nJewish, victim of Holocaust. He was released from one of the, liberated from one of\nthe concentration camps as a Polish laborer. He lost his whole family. His father\nwas Official, some official in Polish government, first one to go. The Germans first\ntook the dangerous people, who are people with Army, officers, you know?\nLawyers and so on. Intelligencia (ph), you Know? And he was there and listening to\nthis whole discussion and he raised his hand. | didn't Know who the guy was. |\nfound out later about his background. And he said, | listen to the whole story. |\ndon't know this gentleman, pointing at me, but my name is so-and-so and | live now\nin Aurora. | live only few blocks away from the University. He introduced him, who\nFelix Horn 90\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 90\nhe was. He was a retired man, he worked at one of the factories there, a factory\nman. And he had a number on the arm and he is missing some of the toes. He\nwas beaten in the concentration camp by the Germans, he was not working enough\nand so on. He was beaten and he lost his shoes, well not shoes, they were woolen\ntype of a thing, with a pipe. They smashed his toes and then given no medical\ntreatment. They became gangrenous and fell off completely. And then the inmates\ntreated him a little bit, secretly and so on, he saved the foot actually. But he said, |\ndon't know the man from Adam, but you don't have to believe me either. Just\nbecause | have a number doesn't mean nothing. My father didn't have a number.\nHe's dead. By the Germans, by the Nazis. My brother didn't have a number, he\nwas shot by the Nazis. You will see his corpse, you say well he died natural death?\nOr somebody robbed him maybe? Well, that's not true. But no one is going to\nforce you to believe it. If you don't want to believe it you never will believe it. But\nthe day will come, you'll find out, it is the truth. Just like Dr. Horn said about the\nslavery. We all know it was true. There was slavery, of course there was. But see,\namazing that you who didn't live in the days of slavery insist there was slavery. And\nhere you're confronting a person who lived through the Holocaust, my\ncontemporary, right? He don't believe me, that | am there. And this was a dilemma.\nAnd | don't know how much | convince . . . [End of Side 1 of Tape 3]. . . her of\nFelix Horn 91\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 91\ncourse, but | think the teacher, the professor, Palmer, was very impressed with this.\nShe called me many times. She was very impressed. Just because she had\ntype of a confrontation. A person was there. Which was,\neventually, the younger people when they look at the videos and that's all. Look at\nour faces, our voices. But they'll be computers or so, but they are not human being.",
        "Q: Let me ask you one thing, | was just thinking about where we are. You're in\nLincolnwood, which is as far as | know a few blocks from Skokie, basically?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: A lot of Jewish people here and a lot of Holocaust survivors here.",
        "A: Right. The first march against the Nazis was here.",
        "Q: Well | was going to bring that up. In the late 1970's when the Nazis were trying\nto march here, you were here?",
        "A: Right. Correct. | was here.",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: | didn't face up to it. We didn't Know nothing about it until later. As a matter of\nfact, the leader of this Nazi was a Jew. You know about that I'm sure?",
        "Q: Well you know, I'm not from this area, so | didn't know. | think | remember this\nvaguely that he is like part Jewish or something?\nFelix Horn 92\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 92",
        "A: Part Jewish, right. His father was Jewish, not his mother. According to the\nJewish laws, if the mother is not Jewish you're not Jewish. But there was a\npassport of his father, passport, he went to Israel then, it was in Hebrew. | mean, it\nwas Palestine at that time, it was a Hebrew in English. And\nhis faith was Jewish. So his father was Jewish. He was very antagonistic, that\nleader of the Nazi, when people found out his father was Jewish.",
        "Q: Yes. So my question is, | mean, here you are living in this area. It's, by then it is\n30-some years after the war. You've made this whole life. You had these horrible\nearly experiences. Here you are in a suburb of Chicago and you have these people\nparading around in Nazi uniforms and whatever. I'm just curious what that must\nhave stirred up, even if just the memories?",
        "A: Yes, no question about it. At first, | couldn't understand it. | was aware of it. In\nCanada there is an anti-hate law. | couldn't understand why we don't have that kind\nof a law in this country. That freedom of speech, that's fine. That's a beautiful thing.\nBut there has to be a limit to freedom of speech. If you have freedom of speech,\nwell, it can lead to hate, lead to crime. Like burning the churches right now, the\nblack churches. | don't want that freedom of speech if people can face up to me\nand hate me and talk to me in derogatory remarks and so on and being the same\nthing, what | remember now as younger. | feel, that's the country | came for? To\nFelix Horn 93\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 93\nme this is, until today this is very hard to swallow. | understand it but it's hard to\nswallow. Because Canada, it matters too, they do have an anti-crime, anti-hate law.\nEven Germany, the birth of National Socialism, has anti-crime. We have, this guy |\nforgot his name, it starts with \"L\", American, printing the Neo-Nazi literature, here.\nHe can do it freely without any punishment. Bring it to Germany, he is arrested over\nthere for breaking the law.\nOther: Hello?",
        "Q: Hi.",
        "A: And to me this is beyond understanding. Until today, | am not in total agreement\nwith the whole thing. | don't Know what to do about it. But | feel that freedom of\nspeech is very important, yes, but not to the situation. By\nleading to total chaos and . Of course, you have a right to do\nthose things. By the right gives you the right providing you do things that doesn't\nhurt nobody else. You're right to express yourself, yes. Peacefully. Not to kill\nsomeone, not to cause a riot or something like this. Marching, you can peacefully\npass through or convince legislators to pass laws that you believe in and maybe |\ndon't, if you can go through that, that is the way, that's all right, that's fine. But to\nhate, slander and so on, or a Neo-Nazi march, | don't believe that they deserve that\nprivilege. | mean, freedom of speech. | feel that we are reaching, that America\nFelix Horn 94\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 94\nliving today is not the same country that | came to. It's different. And | guess | need\nto get use to it but I'm not talking about the crime now, that things were not present\nat that time, drugs and so on. I'm talking about the political innovations and change\nof climates and so on. And | feel those things, people are misinterpreting the\nConstitution. They use the Constitution for their own personal beliefs and they bend\nthe Constitution they way they want to. They convince our lawmakers of bending it\ntoo. Talking about separation of church and state and so on. But people now try to\nbend it and so on because they live in the country where the Pilgrims and so on\nwhat to escape execution and so on. So they do understand, that's why we have\nthis separation, because where they came from there was no separation, that's why\nthey had to leave the country. They were persecuted. Here in this country we don't\nsupport the working, believe what you want to believe, as long as you don't go and\nkill somebody, don't hurt somebody else. You can believe whatever you want to as\nlong as you do no harm to somebody else. To children particularly. Even if you\nteach or preach certain dogmas, that's hurting the children. | feel that our\nConstitution is abused by a certain group of people. And you will find always those\ngroups of people who find people who fund it and the money talks, you know? Who\nreally have a purpose in the whole thing, quietly and so on. And they undermine our\nDemocracy. I'm worrying about it. | am. | worry about my grandchildren. How safe\nFelix Horn 95\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 95\nare they in this country now? And will they be as safe as | was when | was a kid? |\ndon't know. I'm not sure. Even my daughter, wanting to be a veterinarian, and |\nwas told not in certain terms. If you're not a farmer who donate money to the vet\nschool and if you are not a born American, forget about it. And then they didn't want\nto tell me if you're a Jew, just don't bother. See? But this was the life, true life was\nin those days. But not that our government, our country believed in and promoted it.\nBut the people did. | was amazed with the amount of anti-Semitism in this country.\nAmazed how much. This little village, before my arrival here and right after the\nSecond World War, there were signs on the front lawn, dogs and Jews not\npermitted.",
        "Q: When you came here?",
        "A: When | came here, right. The owner of Lincolnwood (ph) was a German. He\nowned huge farms, multi-millionaire. He died of course. His park is, Prussels, the\npark is named after him. He subdivided, blah, blah, blah and so on. There were no\nJews here before. was the first, where Jews were there, before\nLincolnwood (ph) became. But slowly, use to making in-roads and some of the\ngentlepeople didn't like some Jews so they started selling their houses. So the\nJews were buying it. So like the Jews living in Rogers Park, going to the suburbs,\nyou know? Different minorities comes in. And that's what, | understand, | was not\nFelix Horn 96\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 96\nhere at that time. | never seen that sign but | was told by my colleagues, Jewish\ndoctors, who never could live here. They told me, no one wanted to sell them a\nhouse or a plot to build anything. They were unwelcome. There were a lot of\nchurches, there was never a Synagogue here. Now we have some.",
        "Q: | want to go back and ask you one thing. You told me the story about when\nyou're son was playing with the neighbor kid and then came in and he was about\neight or so then. And that's the first time the subject came up. I'm just curious, that\nyou and you're wife are both survivors. You're here, you're having kids. Did you\never have any discussion about how you would handle this subject with you're\nchildren? Because, you must have thought it was, it had to come up at some time?",
        "A: Yes, it did. Of course, | imagine | did in a minor way, but | don't remember in\ndetail. But | Know one thing. It came up once when they were older, when we got\nsome invitation to some symposium on children of survivors, something like this.\nThey had to undergo counseling, through psychological evaluations, and so on. |\nnever found that need in my family. | never, not that | am blind to it, | am open to\nany kind of a consultation or if there is need to it. | never felt my kids were deprived\nof any security, love, affection, ect. Just because what we went through? We\nnever, we didn't dwell on this maybe. Maybe in the very early, formative ages of our\nchildren we didn't want to hurt them. And this was a cruel thing and we wanted to\nFelix Horn 97\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 97\nspare them to those things. We felt that maybe in time when they are more mature\nand more responsible and more secure then we can have a dialogue on this thing.\nBut, interesting enough, when they became more mature they were not open to this\nkind of discussion at all. They, my son don't want to talk about it. And | try for many\ntimes to approach him and so on. And he said that | know you're story, | Know\neverything. It hurts me inside. | don't want to talk about it. But he's a very well\nbalanced person. He is not, outward he is not, or psychologically, a handicapped\nperson, emotional or otherwise. He is secure. He is responsible. He is very well\nknown physician and consultant, you know? He has a secure family. He has two\nlovely little girls, daughters. He married a gentile girl who is of German extraction. |\ndon't know how many generations, three or four generations, so, but he made it\nclear. He fell in love with her, she fell in love with him. As much as hurts him, he\nwill never hurt his parents and marry a gentile, German girl unless she converts.\nShe said, look, it's not my fault | was born of German extraction. Which is true. But\nher parents and grandparents and great-grandparents born in this country,\nAmericans. The German is only by the name, name was Griner, which is a German\nname. It could be a Jewish name too. The fact that | am not Jewish is not my fault\neither. But this they are, they are people too. But | am nota religious person. If this\nwill make you happy. And she converted. She is more Jewish than my wife. Friday\nFelix Horn 98\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 98\nshe lights candles. Kids go to synagogue, to temple. We join synagogue because\nof my kids. To same synagogue. They joined but they waited four years to be\naccepted. It cost a lot of money, like an introduction there because there was such\na waiting list. And that synagogue, they want to belong. One day we got a call from\nthe Rabbi, Dr. Horn? Yes? You're son is a member of our congregation now. We\nwould like to meet you. | said, will you want us to be a member? He said, well, we'll\ntalk about that. We want to meet you in person first, want to know you're story. |\nwould like to listen to you first. And we set up a date and we met in his office there,\nin the synagogue. He roughly just got our story and so on. He said he would be\nmore than pleased if we would join the congregation. | said, first thing | cannot\nafford that money that my son paid you. | am retired, | said, and!|... Money is not\nthe issue here, he said. You don't have to pay nothing, he said. | want you to be in\nthe congregation, you're son is in the congregation with. So we belong there.",
        "Q: How about with you're daughter?",
        "A: My daughter-in-law or my daughter?",
        "Q: No, you're daughter. And you told me the story of what happened with you're\nson and how the whole subject of the Holocaust came up and how it's gone with\nyou're son. You haven't mentioned you're daughter. How is that?\nFelix Horn 99\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 99",
        "A: She is more open to it, we talked many times. My daughter, she went to Israel\nmore than once, twice or three times already. She wants to go through it again.\nShe is more digging into the past than my son. She is different person, totally\ndifferent. She doesn't dwell on it though. No, she doesn't. But she is, she grabs\nwhatever little she get from the history, from us, the parents, grandparents, so on.\nShe wants part of it, you Know? She is clinging to it. But she is very secure too.\nShe doesn't dwell on it, she doesn't talk about it all the time and so on. Among\nfriends and so on, they all Know she's proud of who she is, daughter of survivors.\nAnd she's not embarrassed. Because | know some of my friends children are\nembarrassed about their parents being survivors. That's sad.",
        "Q: They are embarrassed?",
        "A: Embarrassed that their parents are survivors. They are poor, they were poor, no\nfamilies. Because their friends are rich and American-born and so on. It's a social\nlevel type of a thing. They are like a lower kind of people. But this was not with our\nkids. No, | never, they always stood their ground and as | say, | feel that we are\nvery well leveled families and my kids had no need for it. But someday, | am sure,\nafter | die, |am sure my son is going to keep his promise. He is going to look into it\nin details. The only thing | might say, yeah, but it would be better if you do it now\nwhile | am alive. You can get some questions, you're not going to talk to the tape.\nFelix Horn 100\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 100\nThe tape won't be talking to you. You have to listen to the tape, that's the only thing\nyou get. Information. But with no dialogue. Here, you've got you're father still alive.\nBut he doesn't, he said, Dad, | cannot do it. I'm sorry, | cannot face up to it. He\nwishes he could take away from me the hurt and he cannot do that, no how. How\ncan you do it? Not talking about it? That's what he thinks, by not talking, it is\nminimizing my hurting. | don't dwell on it either. | went back to Poland, | went back\nto my High School. | was the only Jew in a Catholic High School. | play violin in\nchurch choir in Poland. And some Polish people, all the known facts about Poles\nduring the war, what they did against the Jews. | won't repeat it because they were\nthe willing executioners of Hitler. But they saved my life and my wife's life. They got\nme out of Warsaw ghetto, Polish people. Underground, Polish underground. For\nmoney, of course. It turned out to be no money, we buried, you know the story from\nthe tape. We had a buried treasure and it turned out to be someone robbed it.\nAnyway, Polish people help us survive. And they definitely helped me. Totally\nunselfish, with any profit, no profit, nothing. So! am very, | have to be fair to it. And\n| went to Poland, | wanted to see my High School. | was treated beautifully when |\nwas a kid there. | remember when, it was the most beautiful years of my life. My\nparents and my school. And my High School still stands. And | found the book with\nmy picture in it, in the High School. | didn't know their fiftieth reunion, | didn't know\nFelix Horn 101\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 101\nthey know | was surviving and, so | had the guts to go back and | went to the\nconcentration, Majdanek, where my parents perished. | had to go there because\nthey were there, but that's all. There's no trace left of nothing. | went to other\nconcentration camp, Auschwitz, etcetera. We went to the former ghetto area and\nWarsaw where some Jewish people sell remnants, old, a few of them left over yet\nnow. Pitiful sight. And my wife cannot face up to it. She cannot do it. She hates\nthem so much, what they did to the Jews. She doesn't want no part, she doesn't\nwant to listen or speak Polish. She doesn't want to read Polish books. She doesn't\nwant to look at Polish movies. She doesn't want to go to Polish restaurants and so\non. You know, she is obsessed with it. | am too, but | reflect different on those\nthings. | may be stronger than she is. | can control my emotions. | can go, maybe\nserve my purpose, because it brings back memory and no one can give it to me, |\ncannot buy it. | go there and | grab it. And | made that 3,000 or 4,000 mile trip for\nthat only thing, to sit on old bench | was sitting on as a student. | am an emotional\nperson and | may be, | have compassion for those days. Because those were my\nhappy days. And | am willing to do it again now because probably this will be my\nlast trip. And some of my friends, Jewish friends from the same town wants to go\nwith me because our wives don't want to. But it depends, some people go to a\npsychiatrist, they have medication. They have the release of their turbulence and |\nFelix Horn 102\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 102\nget a release by doing what | am doing. And this gives me peace of mind. As much\nof peace you can get.",
        "Q: When did you go back to Poland?",
        "A: About 16 years ago. The only time.",
        "Q: So, 1980?",
        "A: Yeah, 1979 or 1980, | don\u2019t remember exactly. | think 1980, yeah.",
        "Q: Just before a lot of things started to change there.",
        "A: Communists were still there.",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: And | felt very uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable with the passport and the\nborder, on the airport, they opened my passport, looked at my picture, it was empty.\nIt was a new passport. They are looking for Israeli stamps. They were, oh, they\nwere, if you weren't from Israel they wouldn't let you in. You know, the stamped\nvisa. So | made sure | got a new passport. Clean, nothing there. And the guard\ndidn't say a word, just look at me, look at the empty pages. My picture, empty\npages. He the pages through, empty, blank, blank, blank. He look at me,\nhe look at this line of people behind me, maybe fifteen minutes like this, standing\nand waiting. And | was getting a little uncomfortable. Because | heard nasty things\nabout the Communists in those days. Didn't say nothing. Gave me a stamp.\nFelix Horn 103\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 103\nWithout saying a word, pointed out to go through and I'm in Poland. But it was not\nthe most comfortable feeling | had. Now is different. Now they have so-called\nDemocracy, but in today, Jews and Poles, | just got it today. | read an article,\nHungary, Romania, Estonia, giving back Jewish property to owners. Poland, not\neven . Don't even prepare a bill or law to return the Jewish property to\nthem. So they grabbed what the Germans took away, robbery, and they keep it.\nSee, Poland. So there's many things that I've got to be proud about being born in\nPoland, but things got, | am not a Pollack.",
        "Q: And you're planning to go back again, you say, with you're family?",
        "A: Wonderful time. That's going to be my last trip. | go alone even, | go. | will go.",
        "Q: Are you going to go to the same places that you did the last time?",
        "A: Right, right. Yeah. | have a drive to go. You know when | went to the High\nSchool and the orderly there opened the class, it was during summer vacation and\nthe classes were not open. The secretary was there and so on and they called the\nguy with the keys to open the room that I, you know | closed my eyes. | sit down. |\nopened my eyes. | thought | turned to 1935. Sixty years. This were the days, 1935\n| was in school. The same benches. The same class, the same room. Just like |\nnever missed it, | never left. And the guy with the keys, the orderly, the janitor,\nstanding with respect outside, closed the door a little and let me sit and meditate on\nFelix Horn 104\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 104\nthe bench that | sat on as a student. He understood it very well. And he said, didn't\ndisturb me. And when | left | gave him $10.00. He didn't want to take any money\nfrom me. He said, it would be sacrilegious, he said. He knows how | feel. He\nknows, he knew my story, you know, Jewish and so on. | was the last graduate\nbefore the war, then the school was closed. And there was only, when the war end,\nwhen the war started, there were only two Jews in my class, my school. | was one\nand another Jew who lives in Chicago right now, found him after the war, he\nsurvived the war in Russia. He was in my High School. The only second Jew. And\nin those days, there was nothing but school, education. Where you get it, is it Jesuit\nschool, other school, you get the education. And this was a drive, there was such a\nhealthy competition. The cousins, everybody had to outdo the other one. | played\nviolin, | was painting, so my cousin was doing the same thing. We tried to out do\neach other. It was such a healthy thing. There was nothing else to do in those\ndays. There was no fun like the kids have today and going to different places,\nthings, parks, if you go to park they beat the hell out of you. If you were Jewish and\nwent to the park, the students, University students, beat the Jews in the park. They\nlet the Jews in. Oh, | was beaten up many times. But not by my colleagues. My\ncolleagues, | was their Jew. Their Jew. No one had the right to touch me. | was\ntheir Jew, they loved me, they treated me, they saved my life. They helped me with\nFelix Horn 105\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 105\nthe false papers during the war. They helped me. With the risk of their own life.\nThere was a Gestapo walked in the room, who was sitting there. He was a\nshoemaker. | took my shoe off, he said, here, give me a shoe, he put a nail in my\nheel. And the guy said, these here are two Jews running? And the lady said, what\nJews? There are no more Jews here. What Jews? Jews are gone. So he left. It\nwas the mother of my classmate from that High School. They saved my life. That's\none episode only. And there are many of them, | didn't describe all of them.\nBecause | cannot do in three hours or four hours of testimony, to give you all the\ndetails. They were righteous gentiles, yes, they risked their life and | question, are\nwe Jews, would we be ready to make that sacrifice, to threaten you're life to save\nanother Pole? | don't know. | ask myself the same question, could | do that?\nSomebody would say, oh, they are dumb Pollacks, that's why they did it. Because\nsmart people would not do it. But that's wrong to say that. There are many\nintelligent people who done it, because that's the right thing to do. There are certain\nrules in life. Is it a right or is it a belief? Is it a religion, maybe?\nWhatever. What is the right thing to do, what is the wrong thing to do? They done\nwhat they believed was the right thing to do. And | cannot knock them, those\npeople deserve their place rightfully in history. That's why | cannot generalize all the\nFelix Horn 106\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 106\nPoles. But obviously Hitler Knew where to build those concentration camps\nbecause he found a lot of helpers.",
        "Q: Right. And who to make guard too. You've mentioned Ukrainians a lot in you're\nvideo tape.",

        "A: It was not a very happy note. | don't need the world to learn anything from the\nSecond World War, from the Holocaust. Learn nothing. And history repeats itself.\nHowever said it before was right. It is going to repeat itself. I'm from, start from old\nages, middle ages, same thing right now. When Eichmann asked Hitler at the\nConference in 1942 in Germany, before the Final Solution, when Hitler\noutlined the plan, what he wanted to do with the Jews, he was agreeable but he\nsaid one question, to Hitler. | think | mentioned that in my testimony too. Do you\nknow anything about the Armenian Holocaust? And Eichmann said, no. See?\nHere you are. There was Armenian Holocaust. Turks annihilating Armenian people\nin 1905, | think. 1905, 1915 yeah. Kids were never taught in school about, they\nFelix Horn 107\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 107\nwere not in Turkey. But in Germany, in Poland, | was never taught that. | just found\nout about it when | heard this thing. You know what? After the Second World War,\nafter Holocaust, fifty years, seventy-five years, people forget about it and they will\nnot like to discuss it no more. And | am reaching that point now, | see that. Letters\nto the editors, | see people saying, we know, Holocaust, Holocaust, Schmol-o-caust,\nenough, enough, enough. How much longer are you going to talk about it? Well, |\nhate to say that, from the lower class of people, not very intelligent people, would\nwrite that kind of a letter to an editor, you know? But they resent, non-Jews dwell\non this kind of thing. And they don't want Jews to dwell on it either. But they don't\nunderstand the pain inflicted by that. How can you forget that? As, who said it?\nViselle (ph)? Forgive? Yes. Forget? Never. True. You might forgive, | never\nforgive. | won't forgive, | won't forgive. But what does it mean, | won't forgive? So |\npay my own choices, | don't want to associate with German people and so on.\nThere are innocent German now, you youngsters today, it's not their fault. They are\nnot, because they are grandchildren of the perpetrators. But to children | might\nforgive, little children. My generation Germans | won't forgive because they are\nwilling witnesses and participant in the Holocaust. Do you read the book by, what's\nhis name? Lucy? Lucy? | have the book upstairs. | have it upstairs. By Galahan\n(ph) is the name, | forgot his name. Hitler's Willing Executioners. Proving that all\nFelix Horn 108\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 108\nGerman participate, willingly or unwillingly. Getting support, getting fur coats,\ngetting radios. They knew it belonged to somebody, they knew from whom. By not\nbeing anti-Jews, but they are accepting those things, they are participant in it, they\nwere quiet about it, they were peaceful. So, it is so true. | agree. | read the book.\nVery difficult book for me to read. Difficult because it's the professor from Harvard\nwho is the writer, a highly intelligent man and psychologist. And | had to read it like\na science book, not a novel. It's hard to digest it you know? But it's so true. So |\nbelieve today the people didn't learn nothing. It is repeating itself right now, this\nmoment. And it's going to repeat itself again. One stops, another country starts\nmurdering their own people. Is it Rwanda? Is it Bosnia? Is it in Libya? Or is it in\nSouth Arabia now? | mean, wherever you turn around you will find the same thing.\nKnow it's going to happen again. And that's rather depressing fact that | have to\nlearn to live with it. The only, maybe positive out of it is that my life is going to end\nsoon and | probably won't be witness to another Holocaust maybe. But | worry\nabout my children and my grandchildren. That's what | worry about, yes. | am\nrather pessimistic. | am an extrovert, | am. And basically | am a person with hope\nand so on, and in this respect | am rather pessimistic.

        "Q: Another question | have about, there you are in you're sort of student Kabbutz",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: If | could stop you again for a second, | am curious about again you and you're\nwife and also the people you're with now in this new environment. If you could tell\nme a little more about, was it a big topic of conversation, whether or not to go to\nIsrael? Was there debate about that? Were there people determined to do it?\nWhether you had discussions or even arguments about that?",
        "Q: To?",
        "Q: But you're saying you felt you betrayed yourself a little bit by not going to Israel?",
        "Q: Let me just ask you, how did you, when you came over how did you come over?\nOn a ship?",
        "Q: What kind of camp was this?",
        "Q: Director of?",
        "Q: Joint Committee of?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So you watched the same movie three times?",
        "Q: And then you were able to go to parties after that?",
        "Q: As long as you've gone back a little bit, | want to, just before we pick up with you",
        "Q: Did you ask the person? | mean, why should | have to sign?",
        "Q: How long did it take to go through the customs? Was it a few days one day and .\n..?",
        "Q: So actually when you got to finally leave there and actually go into the city it was\nstill Thanksgiving?",
        "Q: It was still the holiday so the streets are probably empty, | guess?",
        "Q: Were people having any sort of Thanksgiving dinner? Did you have that that first\nnight or not? Do you remember?",
        "Q: So let's go back now, you're in, you go to Buffalo?",
        "Q: What year is this? Do you remember?",
        "Q: Oh, well let's go back then. When was you're son born? What year?",
        "Q: And you named him what?",
        "Q: And what was the name of you're son?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Oh really?",
        "Q: Or, | don't know, we could just talk about it now, because let me just say for the",
        "Q: At the time you were both convinced that he had not survived.",
        "Q: So now you're saying you've gotten some new news?",
        "Q: How long ago was it that you saw this list with his name on it? Was it this year?",
        "Q: Yeah, but you saw this list that showed the brother's name on it. How long ago",
        "Q: Oh, just a month ago?",
        "Q: So that was just a month ago. After all this time, all these years, | mean it must",
        "Q: Does it make you feel any regret or sadness that maybe he was around all this",
        "Q: Well | wish you luck. | hope you're able to...",
        "Q: Let's go back to you're story. You're first child is born in Rochester in, | forget",
        "Q: This house?",
        "Q: Yes. Let's say for the record here that this story and all is in you're video, so if\npeople ever want to go back and get the whole story, you and you're wife both tell it\nin you're video. So | just wanted to put that on the record. Let me ask you a couple\nof things. Are you retired now?",
        "Q: Yeah. We can, after we're done with this interview, we can have our own private\ndiscussion, the way the health care system is going. | want to ask you some other\nthings, just based on you're experience. You had two children in the \u201850's and now\nthey are grown, or whatever. And you are, you and you're wife are both survivors of\nthe Holocaust. I'm wondering when and how did you first talk about that with you're\nchildren? How did it come up? How did they learn you're story? What, how do you\nfeel that you're relationship with you're children, how did that effect it, if it did\u2019?",
        "Q: When did he stop talking about it with you? When he was younger or recently?",
        "Q: Okay. You know, I've read some in the past, some books of, sort of biographies",
        "Q: Well, you know, every family is different and different people react in different",
        "Q: When was this talk or class?",
        "Q: Last summer?",
        "Q: I'm curious about that whole encounter you talk about with the young woman\nwho didn't believe the Holocaust. I'm wondering how, when something like that\nhappens, when that's over, how that makes you feel?",
        "Q: Let me ask you one thing, | was just thinking about where we are. You're in\nLincolnwood, which is as far as | know a few blocks from Skokie, basically?",
        "Q: A lot of Jewish people here and a lot of Holocaust survivors here.",
        "Q: Well | was going to bring that up. In the late 1970's when the Nazis were trying\nto march here, you were here?",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "Q: Well you know, I'm not from this area, so | didn't know. | think | remember this\nvaguely that he is like part Jewish or something?",
        "Q: Yes. So my question is, | mean, here you are living in this area. It's, by then it is",
        "Q: Hi.",
        "Q: When you came here?",
        "Q: | want to go back and ask you one thing. You told me the story about when\nyou're son was playing with the neighbor kid and then came in and he was about\neight or so then. And that's the first time the subject came up. I'm just curious, that\nyou and you're wife are both survivors. You're here, you're having kids. Did you\never have any discussion about how you would handle this subject with you're\nchildren? Because, you must have thought it was, it had to come up at some time?",
        "Q: How about with you're daughter?",
        "Q: No, you're daughter. And you told me the story of what happened with you're\nson and how the whole subject of the Holocaust came up and how it's gone with\nyou're son. You haven't mentioned you're daughter. How is that?",
        "Q: They are embarrassed?",
        "Q: When did you go back to Poland?",
        "Q: So, 1980?",
        "Q: Just before a lot of things started to change there.",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "Q: And you're planning to go back again, you say, with you're family?",
        "Q: Are you going to go to the same places that you did the last time?",
        "Q: Right. And who to make guard too. You've mentioned Ukrainians a lot in you're\nvideo tape.",
        "Q: We've spent a good time, we've actually been talking now for almost three hours\nand | want to thank you for you're time. And before we turn the machines off, any\nlast thing you want to add or anything you want to say that hasn't come up or that\nyou want to expand upon?",
        "Q: It's surprising actually given so much of what you're story has been like,\nespecially since coming over here. And you've said yourself, in many ways, you've\nhad very good fortune and you've had a very good life.",
        "Q: But it's interesting that you're final conclusions are so pessimistic.",

        "Answer: Well my name is Felix Horn. | was born in Poland, in Lublin. And lama\nsurvivor. | was liberated in 1945 and after liberation | went searching for anyone\nwho might be still alive from my family so | returned to my hometown, Lublin. Which\nis in the middle of Poland. It is one of the rather bigger, larger cities. There were\n140,000 people prior to the war. Out of this at least half of it, 70,000 people\ncomprised of Jewish population. My family, a rather assimilated family and they all\nperished, all prior to 1945 when Lublin ghetto was destroyed and all went to, as far\nas | know, to the concentration camp, My-don-ick (ph). | came back to Lublin in\n1945 and there was already some Jewish life present in Lublin, mainly from people\nwho had returned from Russia, who escaped the war, escaped the Nazis and went\nto Soviet Russia and survived the war over there. | met some of my acquaintances,\nsome friends even from my school days, but not from my school per se since | was\nonly Jewish student in a Catholic school. And as anybody else you register and you\nleft notes on the walls and then anybody who talked to you, look | am here, if you\nhear anything from this and that please let me know, and to my surprise, | found two\nUncles, they survived the war. One survived being hidden by a Polish family. He\nused to be an officer in Polish Air Force prior to the war, which was very, very\nuncommon. And he was looking for the property that belonged to my grandparents\nFelix Horn 2\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 2\nactually, thinking everybody perished so he can probably take over the property.\nOne of my favorite Uncles. Another Uncle, his younger brother, survived in\nYugoslavia. He escaped the Nazis in Eastern Poland and he was a musician. He\norganized a military band for Marshal Teito (ph) of Yugoslavia. And that's how he\ngot into the partisan group and so on and he spent all the time until 1945 when |\nfound him in my home town too. Everybody came home looking for survivors. And\nhe attempted to take me with him to Yugoslavia since we found that nobody else\nsurvived the war, which my parents and my sister, all my Uncles, cousins,\nnumerous people. And he couldn't get me legally to Yugoslavia since | was not so-\ncalled blood relative. I'm only a nephew. If | be his brother or his child it would be\ndifferent. So | couldn't go with him so | was left in Poland again. My Uncle was not\nparticularly close to me after the war anyway. And we didn't find too many things in\ncommon. However, | didn't know what to do with myself. | remember | promised\nmy Mom that if | survived | would make all attempt | can to resume my education. |\ndid have two years of medical school, until 1941. Between 1939 and 1941. And\nthen | had to interrupt for obvious reasons, and then the decision had to be made.\nShould | go make a living somehow, | was hungry? | had a wife. We were married\nin Warsaw ghetto. And, or go to school. We couldn't afford, both of us were young,\nto go to school. How's going to support us? So | didn't Know what to do. |\nFelix Horn 3\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 3\nin a kind of a confused frame of mind but my first Uncle\ncame to rescue. He gave me some gold coins to sell in the black market and buy\nfood, and do whatever | wanted to.",
        "A: My Uncle who survived in Poland. He was the officer of Polish Air Force. | used\nthe coins for about two years to survive. | didn't do nothing. It was, situation very\nchaotic in Poland. The Communists took over. The only chance was to go to\nschool. So | thought, well, there's time to do it. | registered, | had saved all my\ndocuments, they were buried. All my documents except my High School Degree,\nwhich somehow was lost. But | did have my University Degrees, my University\nbooks, and attendance in the classes, and fortunately all the professors from my\nformer University in Luneburg called Woolf (ph), they moved to Western Poland at\nthat time, and | decided to move to Breslau, , former German\nterritory, where the same professor of my former school, Woolf (ph), resided now in\nthe same town. So | registered with no problem whatsoever. The papers were\nokay. The only thing is there was another Jewish student with me, don't recall\nexactly where he came from, but the remarks | heard in the class. It was, another\ntwo Jews. Hitler didn't kill all of you? You know, and the class was so annoying, not\nannoying but frightening even. And the common trend was at that time the refugees\nFelix Horn 4\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 4\ncoming back from Russia to Poland, not finding no purpose living in Poland, they all\nwere going West.\nThe Nazis were gone, but as you're describing, it was still not a very friendly\nenvironment for Jews.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, just to mention here that | was raised in a rather very modern Jewish home,\nalthough my home was kosher. Just because kosher was believed to be healthier\nand free of any contamination and so on. But my father was very progressive man.\nFirst he was a locksmith then he became an architect with night education and so\non. He was a modern person. And we were living away from the Jewish center\nmostly so | had a formal Jewish education. | had a teacher come to my home\nteaching me religion, Torah, you know, Hum-ish (ph), all the biblical stories and so\non. | never spoke Yiddish though. My parents spoke Yiddish to each other. |\nbrought from school, | was going to a Catholic school, Yiddish was foreign to me.\nBut | did understand everything they were saying but they were talking to me in\nPolish. | was so comfortable, my Polish is really impeccable. Poles have difficult\ntime to look at me, | have Semitic look though. And then my Polish is so different\nFelix Horn 9)\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 5\nthan the Jews in Poland. You can spot a Jew during the war, they looked super. In\nother words, they looked like typical Pole, Nordic type. Blonde, blue eyes, etc. |\nhave a very short nose and the way they walked and so on you can tell the\ndifference. Jews were walking more as bent , kind of scared\na little bit. Even peaceful time, they are looking left and right. Someone might be\nhitting them or attack them or something. It didn't have to be a problem. You could\nbe hit by one person, only two people, but young hooligans. Boys. Seven, nine, ten\nyears old throwing stones, hitting with a piece of anything, an iron pipe, or whatever.\nSo, you know, | was different. | was straight. My Polish was impeccable as they\nsay but they knew who | was because | did return to my original name, which is not\nclassical Polish but its not Jewish or Yiddish either. Horn is really rather German or\nDutch. Van Horn, Von Horn, they are German names. So there was a little\nconfusion, wanted to know who | am. No one dared to ask\nme exactly, are you a Jew or not? But then shortly in classes | didn't hide it. | didn't\nhave no reason to hide it anymore. | was hiding all those years. So then they come\nand seek it, who | am. So there was people, | still have quite a few friends, Polish\nfriends. But many of them were for safety or security reasons, to say, shy away\nfrom me. They exchange words with me rather polite and so on but not very\ncordial. So | felt very uncomfortable. And then during the pilgrim in Kielce in Poland\nFelix Horn 6\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 6\n| got fired to existing situation, you know, and we felt, we felt very insecure. And\nbeing young, saying what am | going to do in Poland? | couldn't live in a country\nthat | didn't have a grave to go to. We had nobody left. My Uncle went back to\nYugoslavia. The other one converted to Christianity, the first one. They had\nnothing to do with Judaism, they had nothing to do with me either because | was\nJewish. Not that he hated the Jews. No. Why did he do it? | don't know. We\nnever talked about it. He was not a person | could have a dialogue with anyway.\nWhen | left | didn't say good-bye to him, he was not very interested. So talking to a\nfew other students of other departments in University, the University\nschool, philosophical department, so on and so on. We\ntalked about it and | inquire how they feel about it? What would they do? Would\nthey stay here? What are their plans actually? They were all in the same boat.",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: Who?",
        "A: Some of them. But most of them not. But they admitted who they are. They\nwere Jewish and so on. And we all agreed that probably it is time to leave. It would\nFelix Horn 7\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 7\nhave to be illegal. There was no legal way for them to have left. You didn't have no\nvisa. You have nobody over seas to send us legal papers. Besides those papers\nwould take ages before you get legal entry, you know. Even after you get you're\nvisa you might take five, ten years. Some of my friends had to go to Sweden\nbecause it was much faster to get out of Sweden to the United States they say than\nwait in Poland for you're number to come up and not to be recognized, especially if\nyou're a Jew. And so | organized a student Kibbutz (ph), an academic Kibbutz (ph)\nof students. And | think in Hebrew they call it Kibbutz acadamime (ph) if | recall\ncorrectly, what | was told. | was not good at Hebrew either. | read Hebrew, | read\nmy Prayer Book and so on but | don't understand them. | read automatically. |\nknow the text, what it means, but not word by word. But my wife speaks Hebrew.\nAnd we elected to leave and we made contact with some what they call a Bree-ha\n(ph), | don't know if you're familiar with that word? Bree-ha (ph) is a group of young,\nJewish people. The avant-garde of the Pal-mach (ph), of the Jewish driving force of\ninformation of Israeli Armed Forces. Those are the young people who are politically\ninvolved in Zionist organizations and they are pioneering, collecting the remnants of\nwhatever is left over for the Jewish people to go back to Palestine at that time.\nThere was no Israel yet. And this was one of the stages, first to get us out of the\nhostile Poland where people didn't want to give us back nothing what we had. Asa\nFelix Horn 8\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 8\nmatter of fact all my furniture was given to some neighbors and so on. They refused\nto give me anything, you know? They belonged to us. The fur coats and radios,\ninstead of give to the Nazis we give to the Poles. They did not have to relinquish\ntheir status. And we gave to them, good idea, that if we survived we'd get\nsomething back, at least something. Talking about silverware, the candelabra that\nwere a few hundred years old, heavy, tall. All those things perished of course.\nThey, when they found out that | am alive, you know, they said the Germans took it,\nthey had to sell it, some of them. They couldn't survive. Anyway, it was immaterial\nanymore to me, | lost more than that. And with this we made a contact with the bra-\nha (ph) and on a given night all gathered and by train we are going to a little town\nnear the border. From there we were met by a group of people, we never really\nintroduced before. They knew about us though. And with their help and their\ncontacts with the border police and so on, they just looked the other way. We went\nright across the border to Czechoslovakia. Don't forget, this was, at that time it was\n1946. Still people coming and going to Poland, looking for family. From Poland to\nVienna, Austria, Czechoslovakia. Looking for some. survivors, different\nconcentration camp. So the guards at the border were not very religious in stopping\npeople. Even if they seen somebody. There was no invasion or so, there was a\npeaceful type of a bi-directional type of movement, you know. But anyway, as a\nFelix Horn 9\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 9\ngroup maybe we would create suspicion so we were able to get from\nCzechoslovakia. They put us on trucks to Vienna. And then over there we were\nmet by a group of Zionists, all Zionists. And they were very\ninstrumental. Thanks to them, they saved us in the beginning. First they had\ncontact with the local authorities, also notorious. Don't forget they had a lot of\ninfluence because Austrian authorities were more Nazi than the German Nazis. So\nthey were very, very guilty during the war, what happened. So for that reason alone\nprobably they tried to collaborate with the Jewish organizations. First we got a\nschool to our disposal. We have no home so they give us a whole school, big room,\nand there were twenty or twenty-one of us, two married couples and some girls and\nsome boys. So we had to divide the one huge room, it was like a theater of some\nkind or an auditorium, with sheets, wires, and we cover, you know, separate, like\nsmall cubicles. We had the beds over there like military beds. And it was very\ncomfortable really. And they took all of our documents, I'm talking about student\nbooks and our academically type of documentation, and they translate everything\nfor us into German. And they, having some contacts at the University, we didn't\nhave to go to a very rigorous type of screening or so, as long as our documents\nwere in order, then they segregated us into different facilities and who ever was in\nmedicine, some were first time that they started the University. | was already a third\nFelix Horn 10\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 10\nyear medical school student, fourth year. | had one year after the war in Poland so\nthis would be my fourth year. But medicine in Vienna was seven years so | still had\nfour, five, six, four more years to go. In German, that | never handled. | spoke\nFrench. | speak Slavic languages, Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, never German. But |\nlearn it fast. And they were accepted, they accepted all my former papers and\nexams | passed. Maybe because we were survivors. I'm sure there was some\nbearing to it, you know? They did not let us suffer, they wanted to make it as\nsmooth as a transition until they knew, around this new medical school, as they\ncould. Which | was very grateful for. We had no tuition. American Joint provided\nthis. And then we received food, they provide food for us too. So we were like a\nlittle Kubbutz (ph), student group, living and doing nothing but study so we were not\nhungry. And that's, slowly we got ourselves kind of use to the new surroundings,\nnew people. We met some friends who were there before us from Poland. Some\nof them Viennese Jewish students, one. We were very close. I'm sure we're much\ncloser now than if this would have happened before the war. Because we have\nsomething in common, we're all Jews and we all lost somebody. There was not one\nperson who was not victimized by loosing his family or part of his family.\nFelix Horn 11\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 11",
        "A: Yes. | think our experiences were different. Everybody had a different story to\ntell. And, someone came from Russia, some had survived in the labor camps in\nRomania, some students survived in ghettos in Hungary and they were beaten and\nso they were persecuted, but they survived. And someone survived in their families\neven, like a sister or two brothers or one parent survived, you know? But always\nsomeone had somebody that he lost, he or she lost, you know? But we had\ncommon ground because we belonged to the same group of people. We were\nJews, we are students, but we got there different ways, by different routes, you\nknow? And everybody had their own stories. We sit at night and talk and talk and\ntalk. And everybody was not fascinated because this was a tragic story to be\nfascinated with, but it proved the just human will to survive and the question was,\nhow did you survive? Until today | ask myself the same question, how did | survive?\n| don't know. There was nothing that you are smart, that you knew what to do. If\nyou turn left it was you're death but | didn't know that. You turn right, you survive. If\nyou walked out during the day no one stopped you. At night, they shoot you. So it's\nhard to say. Is that fate? | never believe in fate, but | don't know. Some of my\nFelix Horn 12\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 12\nIndian colleagues, physicians, right now who is very, , he\nbelieve fate is something of, some external thing. He tried to convince me, this was\ninscribed in the Book upstairs, that | would survive. Well, | can't prove it, let's prove\nthat. But | had many, many days and nights of doubt if | will. The only sad story\nwas, if | perish this second, this minute, why didn't | perish earlier? Why should |\nhave to suffer all the time, you know? But we had one goal, to go ahead and study\nwas the number one. Most of us promised our parents, we want the memory of our\nparents not let down. | personally promised my Mom before they took her away to\nconcentration camp that if | escaped from the ghetto, my town Lublin, she had\nasked me that | had to promise to her, if | ever survive. She apologized, she cannot\nhelp me anymore, that | will never forget to go back to school. To make a better\nperson of myself. And | promise her. My Mom was an opera singer. She was very\ndisappointed when | decide to go to medicine. My Dad, after he became an\narchitect, he was upset | won't be an architect. | play violin so | try to compromise. |\ndrew, I've been drawing beautiful pictures of buildings, talent from my father, that |\ngot accustomed to seeing everyday. And to them, the best writer, clearly, printing\nand so on, you know, | draw things beautiful, | paint. So | do lots of things, so in\nmemory of my Mom that | still play music. Maybe this gives a little peace, that |\ndidn't let her down completely. But | felt since | was 13, that's all | want to do. |\nFelix Horn 13\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 13\nremember sick little boy. He was at that time maybe seven or eight, | don't\nremember his age exactly. | was maybe 13 or so, and he was getting shots and he\nwas so sick. There was a clinic, we couldn't afford a private doctor, we go to poor\npeople's clinic. And | felt if | could help that kid, if | could do something for him but |\ndidn't know what | could do. But that give me the idea that | would like to go to\nmedicine. Didn't know what I'm going to do in medicine but | like to be a doctor.\nAnyway, | have no regrets. | am happy | am, I'm almost not anymore, I'm retired\nnow, private practice.\n(ph) as you describe it, and all these people who survived this experience. Do you\nthink that, and it sounds like you're all very diligent in you're studies, I'm wondering\nwhether because of the experience, because you survived, whether that was part of\nthe motivation to do this? To make sure you became a doctor? Or for the other\nstudents to make sure that they did what they intended to do? I'm guessing maybe\npeople were even more serious than they might have been?",
        "A: I'll give you a surprising answer, no.",
        "A: | Knew what | wanted to be when | was 13, war or no war. | knew what | wanted\nto be. But the war forced me more of less to definitely not forget about it, and the\nFelix Horn 14\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 14\nfact that | promised my Mom that | will. Although if | could have physically, been\nable to, | would have done it anyway. So | don't believe that my personal\nexperiences had any bearing or influence. Although, | have to admit, that because\nof the course of events after the war it came easy for me in terms of, everything was\nfacilitated for me. The Zionist organization, American Joint, they paid for that and |\ndidn't have worry about expenses, food, shelter. We even had\nnights of fun, a little singing and someone playing harmonica\nand so on. Little things. But | really don't believe that this reinforced it, tortured me\nand so on. | would have done it anyway. | know myself. | know. | am a very\ndetermined person. | would have done it anyway, yeah, unless | was sick or\nsomething, but | would have done it. | think that my wife's Uncle that we discovered\nafter the war in Vienna, him being in New York, he wrote us a letter. | never met\nhim before. He was not my Uncle, he was a distant Uncle to my wife, when he\nwrote us, \"Don't you ever come back to the United States with doubt about\ncompleting you're education.\u201d And again, this was no doubt in my mind that |\nwanted to complete it anyway, but definitely if | want to go to Israel, my wife felt,\nwhich is not true, we're not in pioneering type of mood anymore. We're young but\nstill we're physically devastated. And to be a pioneer, go to Israel now, fight from\nbeginning. Again, she felt maybe life in the States would be easier for us. Do we\nFelix Horn 15\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 15\ndeserve a better life? Do we deserve a life better than our parents maybe had? |\ndon't have the answer to it. | would say, yes, why should we? But common sense\nand logic convinced me my wife was correct.",
        "A: Right. Well some group of our friends discovered some relatives in South\nAmerica, in Argentina and Paraguay. Another one discovered family in Australia,\ndistant family. They knew of. They never met them, like this distant Uncle that left\nPoland before the war yet, before they were born maybe. They knew of them\nbecause they remember their parents reading letters and so on. They seen pictures\nbut they never met them personally. To them they were strangers. So some of\nthem had friends or family in Canada, and so on. Some of them in the United\nStates. | would say the majority of us, perhaps more than 50% of the group, fell\nwith Israel. We felt more secure going to Israel. Not in terms of our lives, secure\nterms in no one would attack you from behind again and hit you, be anti-Semitic is\nall. You might be killed by a bomb, by a grenade, by an action, whatever, if you go\nFelix Horn 16\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 16\nto army, but you're in your own country. No one can make a\nto you, . But you Know we thought someday, sooner or later,\nafter the war we were optimistic. Things would work out somehow, sooner or later\nthere has to be peace. And we didn't predict what is going to happen, what is going\nto happen right now? But at that time, and this was my idea to go to Israel. In Israel\nmedicine was not exactly a favored profession. But this was my idea to do. But\nthen finally my wife said, well, if we go to Israel and we won't be able to make it\nthere, how are we going to get to the United States? Almost physically and\nfinancially impossible. But if we got to the United States, we cannot make it here.\nWe can always make it and they will help us, make illegal.\nWe can always do that. Which made common sense to me. And against my better\njudgment though, | consented. We probably should consider that as a more\npractical thing. And | betray my thought, maybe in a sense, that | was kind of\ngeared toward Israel. My years, the few years | was in Vienna and in school that is\nwhere | am going to go. But the common sense prevailed and then maybe the\nconvenience, and we got older a little bit at that time, and we are looking for a little\neasier life. No one says its going to be an easier life in the United States, which |\nfound out they, found it was true. It was not easy at all. | never worked so hard in\nmy life. But | was looking forward to it then, you know?\nFelix Horn 17\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 17",
        "A: To come to the States.",
        "A: Yes because | was geared to go to Israel. | just felt that's my place to go.\nMentally, you know? Although my parents were not Zionists. My Dad was a Bund-\nist (oh) which was a Socialist. And my cousin who was a young, what do they call\nit? A Scha-bo-tin-ski (ph) man, you heard about it, it's ultra right. Nationalist. My\nDad, showing me my cousin when we're young, dressed in a brown shirt with a belt.\nAnd the belt across his chest with a hat. Looked like a young Hitler uniform, like a\nNazi. He said, \"Look at you're cousin. That's a Jewish Hitler unit.\u201d And down on\nme and always was embedded in my mind, by saying Israel doesn't mean it has to\nbe all like my nephew there. There's going to be the , there's\ngoing to be all kinds of people. And | could contribute to the well being of Israel in\nmy own way. | discover my Judaism, so to say. Because | was raised, | knew | was\nJewish but | was going to a Catholic school, so | was kind of like a little odd type of\nan individual. | knew | was Jewish. | had Hanukkah at home and Christmas tree.\nMy Catholic friends come into, to my parents it didn't mean nothing. They knew |\nwas Jewish and they knew they are Jewish. They were Yiddish speaking, but they\nwere very progressive people. And my father didn't believe in Israel. Free Israel,\nFelix Horn 18\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 18\nPalestine, he was a Socialist. He believed that they should build a future where\nthey are. Fight for their right to work and so on. But this was before he became an\narchitect. | remember he was lucky, he was a more professional. Before he was a\nlocksmith, he was a worker. So maybe that's why he believe in it, all his colleagues,\nall with the same group of people, same professions, that's what they were fighting\nfor. But | knew. If my father would have survived the war, he would change his\npolitical views too. It was a different theatre after the war. | mean, you cannot fight\nfor certain ideology that either was in bankruptcy, although it was premature to say\nthat. | say that now after , but | didn't believe that you can\nsuppress human feelings and tell him what to do. You're going to be a clerk, or\nyou're going to be a whatever, a machinist, or a truck driver. | wanted to be what |\nwanted to be. It wouldn't be right to tell you what to be. And in this kind of\nenvironment, my father was promoting and so on, there was less freedom probably\nof choice, and so on. So | knew right away, | was too young to be politically\ninvolved at that time. Although today people at the age of like 17, 18, 19, they have\ncertain convictions, political . . .[End of Side 1 of Tape 1]. . . and so on and they\nmature more. Sure they can change their views. On the other hand, they go in one\ndirection they were raised or maybe they are convinced they are doing the right\nthing. So | discovered that | want to be Jewish, | am Jewish and | won't deny that, |\nFelix Horn 19\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 19\nsuppress this all those years. Suppressed to survive. Now | don't have no need to\nsuppress it. But which direction to go? In Judaism, | didn't know that yet because |\nwas like a newcomer to this kind of a thing. | was never raised in a Jewish\n. That Yiddish was my tongue and going to the shul (ph), the\nsynagogue all the time. | going once a year with my father because my father had\nto go because my grandfather looked at it, you know? He had to go. But again, |\nfelt | developed my own things. My own life when | get older. And of course | was\ninfluenced by the course of events, no question about it. See? So talking, going\nback to a group of my friends, which are still, we are like a family. We still are very\nclose friends. We see each other, even people in Australia or so, we are meeting\neach other maybe every five years or every year, every two years. | go to Israel.\nHalf of my class eventually left for Israel. | will never forget the moment where the\nfirst airline, EL-AL plane landed in Vienna to transport the remains of Theodore\nHershel (ph), was buried in Vienna. And | was one of the delegates honored to\ncarry on my right shoulder. There were eight students of us, carried the casket to\nthe airport, from the cemetery to the airport. And this was, the rest of my life | will\nremember that. | have pictures of it, too even. You know, we had nothing, we were\nas poor as poor could be, but | felt we were happy. We were happy. We live with\nthe memory of our past, our families, our parents. . As any\nFelix Horn 20\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 20\nyoungster will tell you, his parents were the greatest. Mine were too. But anyway,\nso about 50% of my group went to Israel and they established themselves there and\nthey did very well. And we elected to go to the States. | was at the end of my\nstudy. There was one professor of , who was an old, old Nazi. He\nwas about, close to 90 years old. Klein (ph) was about 88, 89. No one knew for\nsure his age, he looked like 120. He lost three sons on the Russian Front. And he\nflunked every Jew going for an exam in front of him. There was no, and these were\nthe smartest kids, flunked the first time. So |, there was another assistant professor\nwho was giving the exams too, but not while the old man was still there. And he\nwas never taking vacations. So | decided, a few of us decided, we'll go and get it\nover with. We're going to flunk anyway. We didn't even study, we're going to flunk,\nwith or without studying, we are going to flunk. And sure enough, we flunked\n, all of us. And then summer vacation started. This was about July,\nschool didn't start until the end of September, beginning of October, | think the\nbeginning of October. So | had one more exam to take. This was the final thing. |\nfinished all the studies. | had to repeat, there were things | was allowed to repeat it\nif | flunk. | was called to the American Embassy in Vienna, that my visa arrived and\n| have two weeks to go. There was a young lady there, | said, \"No. I'm very\nhonored with it and | didn't expect this to come so fast but | have a little problem.\u201d |\nFelix Horn 21\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 21\ntold her, | flunked one exam. And | have to repeat the exam. But it is summer\nvacation, now the school is closed. And the next one, the first one, and with my\nconnection with the secretary of the University, only connection where you had to\nhave preferential date on an exam, | would be the first one because I'll be leaving\nfor the United States. And | said | have to wait until October. And she tells me,\n\"How are you sure that you're going to pass it?\" And | said, \"Well, I'm not sure but |\nhope | pass it because | study now, if | didn't study and. . .\", | told her the story.\nShe was very uncomfortable and very upset about it. She was very hostile. She\nsaid, \"| lost a son in Korea. And he would like to come back home, but he's dead.\nHere you are given a chance to come to the United States and you're rejecting it?\" |\nsaid, \"I'm not rejecting it. But you don't understand. That's my whole life. | will\nstudy, | promised my Mom.\" And | had to study and I'm going to finish it whether\nyou like it or not. If 1 go or | don't go. | cannot go. My Uncle, that | had just\ndiscovered, a new Uncle, told me, don't you ever come here without you're diploma.\nYou'll be nobody. What am | going to do? Come to the States and dig ditches? In\nmemory of my parents | will never do that. If not I'll go to Israel. | told her this. |\nwant to go to the United States. My wife wants to go. We don't have no family.\nShe just discovered a family, an Aunt and an Uncle. Somebody we can call our\nfamily. And | don't understand that you are so difficult. | don't know. Is this a law,\nFelix Horn 22\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 22\nthat you have to do that? Or is it flexible? | didn't have anybody to talk for me in the\nEmbassy. | didn't have a lawyer, | didn't have no body, just myself. Me and my\nwife. My wife was crying. And she didn't respond to us so we got out and walked\naway, walked out. And this was the end of our dreams. We told our friends. They\nsaid, don't worry about it. We'll go to Israel. So | was already set to go to Israel.\nSure enough, what happened? My good old professor got sick. During the end of\nvacation. And sure enough, the assistant professor that we adored was in charge\nof exams. | think it was something like the 3rd or 4th of October, | took the exam.\nAnd sure enough | passed it. And | got my diploma with a formal ceremony, the\nUniversity of Vienna. My Uncle send me a tuxedo, his old tuxedo. We were\ngraduated without robes. The professors were wearing robes, we wore tuxedos.\nSome with tails some with tuxedos. And | graduate and started to say good-bye to\nall my friends in Vienna. Didn't know to go to Israel probably. All of a sudden | got\ntelephone call from the American Embassy in Vienna. This lady was replaced by\nsomebody else. They knew my story. There was no problem at all. She was just a\nbitter person because she lost her son. And maybe my age, | don't know, | never\nseen him. And maybe she was just devastated by it and she took the anger, | knew\nit is not a personal thing. But she was an angry person, she had a tragic event. |\nhad tragedy all my life, since the war. But this other person was _ very\nFelix Horn 23\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 23\nunderstanding, very warm. And she said, this other lady said to me, \"There was no\nproblem at all.\" Even the first time. And this happens quite often, that things will be\nchanged, dates and so on. Asked me when I'll be ready to go? | said, | am ready to\ngo any time from now and just packed and that's it. And so we said good-bye to a\nlot of friends. Some were disappointed that we didn't go to Israel. And some went\nto South America, Australia and so on. We promised we are going to keep in touch\nwith each other. Because we were one family. We went through our youth, the\nformative ages actually without our parents, without somebody from our direct\nfamily. We create our own family. If my friend was like a brother to me, his wife\nwas like a sister to me. And we had two couples on the list were single, they were\nalways looking up at us. Although we are not the oldest, not at all. But we married\nvery young, my wife was less than 16, we got married in Warsaw ghetto. So we\nhad certain authority because being married, you know? It carries certain weight, at\nleast within our group. And those were the happiest days, outside my youth of\ncourse. The second stage of my life. And here we are, we knocked at the door of\nUnited States.\nFelix Horn 24\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 24",
        "A: Yes. Well we were separated me and my wife. They took us to a camp in\nGermany, in Hannover. Men were separated and women separate. We could see\neach other during the day. Otherwise we are confined to separate rooms and so\non.",
        "A: It was some form of labor camp or something. It was not a concentration camp\nbefore, no. It was labor. Barracks, you know? And it was like an office, big building\n| remember. And | was a young doctor without any experience yet, just a piece of\npaper, that's all. And | was assigned to check some of the immigrants who were\nsuppose to go to the United States, for the inflectional diseases or any lice and other\nthings, things like this. And we're waiting for arrival of a ship. And | remember the\nname of the ship. It was a military transport ship normally carrying something like\n300 or 400 soldiers or military men. But 1,800 people were on that ship. |\nremember the wait for a small ship, General Blachfort (oh) was the name, you don't\nforget that. And I've got to tell you, being on that ship, like in three weeks | think we\nwere in the camp before the ship arrived, and we boarded the ship. It took us about\n10 or 11 days through the Atlantic, it was November. And the sea was very unruly.\nWe were sick, seasick, all of us. On top of that, | never ate ham with raisins. Not\nthat | was Kosher. | ate ham, but not the raisins. Polish culinary thing didn't allow\nFelix Horn 25\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 25\nsweet in ham. Ham was always with spices or salt and so on, but not with sweet,\nnot normally with ham. So when | just took this, tasted the ham, it got me sick to my\nstomach. And anyway we survived the war, we survived worse things than that, so\nwe survived the trip too. And my wife's Aunt expected us at the port in New York\nand was a distinguished lady, beautiful person. Elegant, never seen such elegance\nfor years. And turned out that she was instrumental in having us moved to a hotel,\nto some kind of a gathering thing for the, old immigrants were going to. They pay\nfor the room, the hotel. There was a big suite. So with one room, some other\npeople, another room, you know? But it was very nice. They paid for this. And\nthen we got introduced to each other, with my wife's family. Her husband, who was\nthe one that | wrote to and he wrote to me. And after all those years he wrote very\nbeautiful Polish and my English was very bad, very bad. It was tragic. | didn't know\ntoo much at all. And they had two daughters. And of course you invite you're poor\nrelatives to the house. They lived on Sth Avenue in New York. We are not properly\ndressed for that kind of encounter but that's all we had. The only thing | brought\nwas a big case with books that's what | had. Otherwise, | looked like a rook sack.\nNothing. | didn't have no suits, no shoes, just what we had with us. And they had\ntwo daughters, two beautiful girls. And | felt very uncomfortable and she introduced\nus aS DP's. Displaced Persons. Like embarrassed that we are part of the family.\nFelix Horn 26\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 26\nAnd we were invited for dinner there. And when my wife came in and put her coat\nin the closet and when we left for the hotel she found $20.00 in the pocket. | was\nvery upset about it. | didn't learn the American way. Is this the American way? To\nput $20.00 in you're pocket? | think this was an insult. | could use that money, no\nquestion about that. The way it was done, | didn't know what to do. How to do.\nMaybe afraid | wouldn't take it if they proposed, you know? Besides, we are getting\nfood in the hotel, | needed the money. | did need the money really. My wife very\nsoon got a job, right there in New York. She spoke some English, among\nimmigrants she spoke several languages, fluent in German of course, and in Polish.\nAnd she speak Spanish too. And she could be like an interpreter, helping the\nAmerican to distribute the refugees to go left, right, wherever\nthey needed to go. Giving information, translating and so on. And she was paid for\nit. Not much, but she was paid enough to get a bus and pay a bus. And | talked to\nthis Uncle whom | adored. He was really a fascinating person. And | took to him\nright away, he showed me his heart, he opened up completely. A man that | never\nmet before. Never heard of me. His brother-in-law was a Director of American Joint\nin Warsaw, prior to the war.\nFelix Horn 27\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 27",
        "A: My wife's Uncle. His brother-in-law. You know, his wife and my wife's Aunt in\nWarsaw, they were sisters. And the husband of her Aunt in Warsaw, he's that\nAmerican, he direct American Joint in Warsaw. You know, Joint Committee,\nAmerican Joint?",
        "A: Well American Joint was an organization helping the Jews.",
        "A: He was a very big, important figure, pre-war, in Poland, of course. Anyway, we\nsat and talked and so on. He asked me to go to register, where young doctors went\nto register, in New York. You have to do something with yourself there, you've got\nyou're diploma, now you're going to be a doctor. | don't know what that means\nreally, yet. And | went to register. | had to wait in line, not on a line, there was about\n300 or 400 people, all doctors. Young doctors like me. And it was where someone\ntakes you're name and give you some options, hospitals in New York, in Brooklyn,\nyou name it. And | look at this. In the meantime | had to go there by subway and\nthe transportation there, in New York, people, | never was in a city of 10 or 11\nmillion people. And to me | was in Vienna, which was 2 1/2 or 3 million people, was\na huge city. By comparison to Poland, Vienna was a metropolis. | came to New\nYork, | was totally lost. And | was uncomfortable. A little scared too. What am |\nFelix Horn 28\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 28\ngoing to do here? How can | live in a big city like this? And then | didn't like it. |\nwanted to go to a small town. And | talked to my Uncle, my wife's Uncle, he said,\n\"You're right. | suggest you be, you'll find yourself better in a small town.\u201d And they\nsend me to Jewish Committee in New York City with my dilemma. And | found a\nvery listening ear there in an older lady who listened to my story and she said, \"You\nknow what? You should maybe stay in one of the bigger cities, in New York State\nmaybe, you'll be not too far from you're Uncle, just in case you need that contact\nwith him and so on, and maybe you'll find yourself even more comfortable and feel\nmore secure that way.\u201d So | said, \"Well, fine.\u201d She asked me, \"Where do you want\nto go?\" | said, \"| don't know.\" She opened a book, an Atlas, a map. | put my finger\non it. Rochester, New York. She said that's a good city, University City, she said.\nShe made arrangements with Jewish Committee in Rochester to expect us there.\nThey assign us to a German speaking family that they sub-let a room in their house.\nWe could speak German, it was easy. And we went. With our big suitcase, one\nsuitcase with books. | had a medical instrument there which | brought with me, |\nwanted to be a pathologist. We called it a micro-tomb (ph), it's outdated now. |\nbrought them from Vienna, it was world famous in those days. That's one thing |\nbrought with me. So we stayed with, | felt good already. | felt\n. They had a long car and the streets, there was no traffic,\nFelix Horn 29\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 29\nthere was no subway. | mean, you could talk to you're neighbors, you know? You\ncould walk around. It was great. And after maybe a week or so of staying there my\nwife got a job. Got a job working at Woolworth's. Selling donuts. Behind the\ncounter, selling donuts. She would bring in $6.00 each night, for nothing. And she\nwas telling me her experiences at work. She worked with a lot of African-American\nand some minorities, but not as many that, well they were lower class American\npeople, white people, but some of them didn't even finish High School, and so on.\nVery soon she was, she graduated from the University of Vienna, she was an\neducated person. They discovered she was a very intelligent woman, so they\nmoved her right to the office with the bookkeeping department. And she was taking\norders and supplies and so on. | remember she told me one day they had some\ndevice, you count together six donuts of sugar donuts, six donuts with chocolate,\nthey had to use the machine to add it up and she didn't need to. She added it up in\nher head, and say it's $1.97. They would look at her, how do you know? Well |\nfigured it out. | don't know, my brain. Anyway, they discovered she's smart and\nthat's how she got the job. At least she got a paying job. Now | felt more insecure\nthan ever. Myself, | didn't know what to do myself. So talking to my benefactors,\nthe German-Jewish family that we stayed with, they say, \"You know what? I'll\nintroduce you to our German doctor. He is from Germany, a Jewish doctor in\nFelix Horn 30\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 30\nGermany. Maybe he can help you because you're a doctor, he's a doctor. He has\ncontacts and maybe he tell you what's next step.\" Because we don't know what to\ntell you. And the Jewish Committee, they were awaiting any assistance, if | need\nanything they will, but they want to leave me alone and see what | want to do. | met\nthis German doctor. He say, \"You know what? Let me talk to the Chief of Staff of\none of the hospitals, which was the University Hospital, he's on staff. Let me talk to\nhim and see what he suggests.\" | said, \"Fine.\" \"In the meantime, | have a lot of\nGerman people, my patients, if you want to come and help me in my office here?\" |\nsaid, \"| don't have a license yet to practice medicine here.\u201d He said, \"I won't let you\npractice medicine. You assist me, help me with the x-ray department, x-rays and\nmoving the files and so on, and I'll pay you for it.\u201d | said, \"Okay.\" So | felt better yet,\nyou know? And one day he came back to me, this German doctor, and he said to\nme, \"You know what? | made an appointment for you with the Chief of Staff. He\nspeaks a little German. He is Jewish, but he has a resident who speaks fluent\nGerman, so he will be there when you are there.\" | said, \"Fine.\" He brought me in,\nhe picked me up and brought me there, he said he would pick me up later. When |\nwalked in, he spoke very broken. My English was just as bad as his German. But\nthe German resident was there, German-speaking. American of German\nextraction. And at first he wanted to know my life story. Being a Jew, knew I'ma\nFelix Horn 31\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 31\nsurvivor. He wanted to know the whole story. And we're sitting there for four hours.\nHe asked for lunch to be brought to his office there. We had lunch together. And\nfinally said, he released the resident to go away, and he said, \"You speak German, |\nunderstand what you're talking about. | maybe don't speak as good but | can\nunderstand.\" And he was fascinated with my story, wanted to know all the story.\nAnd | thought he felt guilty for some reason, | don't know why. Maybe because here\nhe has his whole family here, survived. | found out later he had a son of my age\nwho was a young doctor too, and maybe he felt sorry for me, you know? That! was\nso physically, mentally devastated. And in the meantime | found out that its almost\nimpossible to get accepted in that hospital as an intern because American boys,\ninterns, medical students, have in advance, a year in advance, have to file their\ndocumentation and so on in the hospital of their choice and its like a lottery. Either\nthey take you or not. The hospital has a choice of taking the best. So |, it looked\nlike the situation was very grim, that | might not be able to get in there even. Beside\n| cannot give, this was February, February of 1951. We arrived in November of\n1950, in New York. For February, 1951, right. And the year doesn't start until June,\nthe end of June or July ist is when the academic year start in the hospital, new\ninterns come in. So | told him in German plainly, | said, well, | see that it's probably\nis hopeless for me to even, since | don't speak English, | don't understand the\nFelix Horn 32\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 32\nnurses. How can | talk to patients? He said, \"Well, you got since February, until\nJuly 1st to pick up you're English.\" \"And what are you going to do?\" \"I'm going to\nintroduce you to two ladies, they speak fluent German. They will be you're personal\nteachers, they will teach you English for nothing.\" Two spinsters. And that's the\npaper | want you to sign. | was so suspicious, | wanted to know what | am signing.\nWhat am | signing? You're signing that you want to be an intern, didn't you? | said,\nyes. So you sign that you agree to be an intern. | said, but, | haven't taken the\nexam. You don't have to take no exam, | am the boss here. | am the Director. You\ndon't have to take an exam. You would have passed the exam, he told me. He\nlooked at my books and my and he said, you deserve to be\nhere. If you're English is going to improve you'll be okay. He was like a God sent\nperson to me. And my Archangel was the German resident. Wherever | was he\nwas with me. Where he was, | was his tail, you know? And when they were making\nrounds in the hospital, | was first the Chief resident, then the middle resident, then\nthe Junior resident, then the Senior intern. | was finally the Junior Intern, | was the\ntail end of the procession, and the nurses between. So | never even heard all the\ndiscussion that took place when making rounds in the a hospital. The door would\nopen, only the front of the group could participate in the discussion. | couldn't even\nhear from a distance. But | listened as much as | could. Wrote some notes in\nFelix Horn 33\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 33\nGerman. Enough that when the rounds finished, | went to the record, hospital of the\npatient, | made copies of certain things. And at night with one bulb on me, | would\nlook in a German dictionary, | was translating. That's how | learned medical\nterminology, how to converse with a patient, how to make a diagnosis, what tests\nyou do, and so on. It was so different than | was use to in Vienna. But in Vienna, all\nfairness, | never was an intern. | graduated and | was shipped right away. So |\ndidn't have the exposure to the hospital in the practical type medicine, you know?\nBut there was a double hazard here, no language and no experience. And | had\nvery little time to pick up my English. Anyway, but to make a long story short, the\ntwo old ladies, they were beautiful old ladies, they taught me English. It was a\npractical English, | never had a formal English education of course. But | bought a\nradio from the first money | made, and my wife, and | listen phonetically to\neverything. And not to music, listen to people talking. To get acquainted with. Oh, |\nforgot to mention, when | lived in New York before we left for register, for twenty-five\ncents | went to a movie on 42\"\u00a2 Street. | stayed there from 9:00 am until about 5:00\nor 6:00 PM, my wife was working as a translator, right? | was there, not watching\nthe movie, | didn't understand nothing, but | would listen to the phonetics, people\ntalking. And after their third time around | understood what they were talking about.\nFelix Horn 34\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 34\nThen I'd comprehend some, some of the mimics, some of the interaction, and |\nunderstood.",
        "A: No. Me, myself? Oh yes, | did. Only to listen. | watched, | was not interested in\nthe movie, | didn't Know, but | wanted to hear people talking. Maybe | could stay in\nthe park someplace but | couldn't force anybody to sit with me and talk for eight\nhours with me. Here, in the movie, they talked. So | could listen, for twenty-five\ncents. And if | had fifty cents, | put twenty-five cents into a saving thing, a little piggy\nbank, and for the first money | bought a radio. | managed $7.00 so | bought a radio.\nAnd at night | listened to the radio too, not to music, just to people talking. A talk\nshow or something. | listen to all people talk. That's what | was, | was hungry. |\nwant to know that. And | knew | had to meet a deadline. It's like a prisoner who has\nonly the sense of the death. He is going to be executed in four months. My\nexecution was in four months, either | pass it or | don't pass it. And | didn't want to\nthink about it. What's going to happen if | don't pass it? What am | going to do? |\nknow my wife's Uncle would not let us down, maybe he would send me some\nbusiness or someplace or so. But this was not my cup of tea, | wanted one thing\nonly and that's what | wanted to do. And things got, it, what do you call it? With\nperseverance. And there were days we were really didn't think we were going to\nFelix Horn 35\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 35\nmake it, financially and otherwise. We were hungry, not hungry while interned, but\nwe didn't eat meat for months, just vegetables, we couldn't afford any. But we were\nnot hungry for meat, once a week when | became an intern, we were invited to\nhospital cafeteria, the family. Like an intern could bring his family, like a wife and\nchildren. Our son was born then, in Rochester. And we came to the hospital and\nhad a fiesta, a beautiful dinner. Turkey, for almost three years, every Sunday,\nturkey. Finally, after three years, | hated turkey. But I, at least | had meat. And we\nmet the other young families, wives of other colleagues of mine. And they all knew\nmy story eventually because my resident spoke German told everybody. They did\nnot shy away from me, they were so nice, they were so warm, they were so\nassuring. They invited me, they were very well-to-do young people. Their families\nwere very wealthy. Each one has a sports car and so on. | looked at them, will |\never live long enough to have that? But they invited me to country clubs, you know.\nWhen they partied, | am their colleague. They invited me and my wife. How am |\ngoing to go there? | have no transportation. | have no money for bus. | mean, it\nwas twenty-five cents a bus, one way. It was fifty cents, both ways is $1.00. $1.00\nis a lot of money, so we couldn't go. This is not the problem yet. What are we going\nto wear? | didn't have a decent, | had hospital uniforms, but | cannot go to a country\nclub party, and no money to buy it. My wife didn't have a dress either. So what did |\nFelix Horn 36\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 36\ndo? | told them I'm sorry, my wife doesn't feel good. She's sick. | cannot go. Well\ncome yourself. Is she that sick? She belongs in a hospital. No, she's not that sick.\nWell then you can go. | cannot leave her alone. She doesn't have nobody to help\nher, if she needs a glass of water or so. Well, they understood. But the fact was |\nwas invited. | was treated like equal. And | was reassured. And | gained a kind of\nsecurity right away. | felt good. And | was not afraid no more and | knew | can\nmake it probably. What happened to my wife? She had parties too. She worked\nthere. Eventually, by the way, she switched jobs, she got a better job at Blue\nCross/Blue Shield. My wife had some medical education, | think it was two years of\nmedical school. She didn't like it though so she quit, she went...\nEnd of Tape 1\nFelix Horn 37\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 37\nTape 2",
        "A: .. . to politics, economy. She is excellent at this. Really tops. So she had the\nexperience of medical terminology, she had a job, worked for Blue Shield. They\ninvited her to a party. Same story. She told them | don\u2019t feel good so she cannot\ngo. And so we kind of navigating for a few years, three years or so. Until | finished\nmy residency. And then it was time to move further. We discover our good friend\nwho's, her parents, my parents were friends when they were single yet, came from\nSweden, she survived the war in Russia. She came back to Poland after | left\nPoland. And she found out that | was alive. So she found an Aunt in Buffalo, New\nYork. She contacted her Aunt who send the papers to Warsaw, but she had to\nleave Warsaw, Poland to Sweden in order to be eligible for transfer to the United\nStates. That's how it was at that time. She arrived. She was in Buffalo, New York,\nwhere her Aunt use to reside. And she found out | was in Rochester. And they\ncame to visit me with her husband. She lost her first husband, which | never met,\nand the second husband that she met in 1945, they married, he was like my\nbrother. He's dead now. So we are good friends. After | finish my residency,\ninternship in Rochester, we elected to go to Buffalo, New York. At least we have a\nvery personal friend, bring back the old days, you know? Part of our happy days\nyet, and part of our family really. Because her parents were friends of my parents.\nFelix Horn 38\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 38\nAnd she worked at the Cancer Institute, Rosewell Park. She\nalready. | came to Buffalo, New York. | was already after internship, | spoke\nEnglish and so on. And | began working in the hospital as a resident. And started\nsaving a little money, or | was making some more money. And | bought myself a\ncar already, | had new Chevy | bought myself. | have to retract something. Going\nback to Rochester, | mentioned | had a big case with books and a micro-tomb (ph).\nWhen | was in Rochester, one of the pathologist at the University, when he heard\nmy story from the Chief of Staff, who was a surgeon, he said he heard | wanted to\nbe a pathologist. He approached me, if | would like to continue it. But in the\nmeantime, | lost the vision in my left eye during the war, when | was beaten by the\nGermans, so | could not use a binocular microscope. And pathologists have to use\nbinocular. So this was, | was professionally handicapped so | said no. So | said,\nbut you know what? | have a micro-tomb (ph), if you want it you could use it for the\nUniversity. He said, you mean you have a micro-tomb (ph) set from Vienna? | said,\nyes. You know, we've tried to get this for years but during the war we couldn't get it,\nand so on. He said, definitely. Are you sure you want to get rid of this? | said, yes,\n| want to give it to him. Not to him, to the University. | mean, the University was\ngood to me. They accepted me as an orphan, practically an orphan, and they\nalready put me on my feet. | wanted this, it's a little thing | can do. No way. No\nFelix Horn 39\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 39\nway. We are a University, we have a budget, we'll pay for it. They insisted on it,\ninsist on it. But even not, | had so much money, | even bought a car, a used car. A\nPlymouth, 1947. | remember that. This was 1952, | think. A five-year-old car. A\nPlymouth, for that micro-tomb (ph), you see? Okay.",
        "A: [Laughter] Now | could go to parties, right.\nin Buffalo, but | want to go back for a second. I'm very curious if you can remember,\nyou talked about coming over on the ship and coming into New York Harbor. I'm\nvery curious if you can remember the day when you actually first entered the Harbor\nin New York? What was it like on the ship? What was it like coming into the\nHarbor? Or you're first impressions?",
        "A: | only remember one thing. | was sick from eating that raisins with ham. |\nremember, or hot dogs with raisins or sweet things, marmalade, so | was safe from\nthis and plastic food and so on, but | see the Ellis Island,\nwhich | knew all about. But this was a holiday, it was a very memorable day for us.\nMaybe symbolic. | remember | said | don't know if | should believe in fate or not. It\nwas Thanksgiving Day. Still today, our Thanksgiving Day is a very important\nholiday for the whole family. Children, us. And for us particularly. This was a\nFelix Horn 40\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 40\nholiday, | don't remember what day it was, but it was Thanksgiving Day, | remember\nthat. And | don't know what to tell you. It was a huge port, the harbor you know?\nSeeing all the immigrants, the refugees spilling out like, you know, on the port, you\nknow, and going through the control, which was nothing. They asked me what |\nhad, a big, huge case of books. | said, asked them if they wanted to open it and in\nthe few words | knew of English, he said, no, no, no. They knew we were refugees\nin trouble, what would we have? Nothing. We have no clothes even. And then, but\nthey opened this and the trust, the people, you know, the official clerk like the\ncustoms, | mean, it was not like searching us or asking personal questions, nothing\nof that kind. Of course we had to go through health control. This was very strict\nbecause there were many immigrants coming who had tuberculosis. In those days,\nwe had to have x-rays taken at the German camp before we boarded the ship. And\nif there was any scar they wouldn't let you through. You had to stay, be treated\nthere in Germany, and you were just delaying you're arrival in the United States,\nafter some time, I'd say a year, six months to a year, you stayed in that camp there.\nThat's why | stalled. | talked to some doctors there because | was a little doctor\nalready. And our chest x-rays were negative, it was fine, so we didn't have no\nproblem with this. The only thing was annoying me, at the time the custom control\nand so on, entry, legal entry in the United States, | had to sign that | was never a\nFelix Horn 41\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 41\nNazi. This was beyond understanding. | had to sign | was never a Nazi? Well later\n| found out that some of the Nazis in the United States, imports from Balcan (ph)\ncountries, you know, false papers, there were many Nazis and many were\nacknowledged by our government. | found out our government paid even some\nNazi collaborators in Europe, right after the war. The Butcher of Lyons, for\nexample, he was in solid with the CIA. Of course | understand she was being paid\nlike $50,000.00 a year. | don't know why. This was obviously after a certain period\nof time, all the secret things were legalized. People opened the archives. That's\nwhere | found out, reading things about it. But it brought back memories. | had to\nsign that | was never a Nazi. | didn't know why.",
        "A: No, that's just the procedure. To sign it. | would understand if this was, at that\ntime it wasn't even such a hostile territory, , not yet. They\nwere really partners in the war, you know, allies. But if | would have to sign | was\nnot a Communist, | understand. Maybe | would understand that. But that | was not\na Nazi? How could | be a Nazi being a Jew? Of course, even if some Jews were\ncollaborating with Nazis, there were some in the concentration camps. But not\nbecause, the Germans used them only, of course, right? But a Nazi would never\nallow those Jews to become Nazis. They just used them for their dirty work, that's\nFelix Horn 42\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 42\nall. There were some Jews collaborators, of course. Jewish Police in Warsaw\nghetto, for example. But anyway, it didn't effect me that much, but they just, for\nyears, it just lingered in my mind. Why did | have to do that? Why sign it, you\nknow? And then | was wondering, those German Nazis you read here and there,\nUkrainian discovered now, Deb-yan-uk (ph) for example, you know, that was\narrested and sent to Israel eventually. He was exonerated, not by the United States\nbut by Israel. So that's, it stuck in my memory, | would say. But otherwise, the\nAmerican way of openness, people friendly, New York City, they are too busy\nsometimes for us and that's something that bothered me, but | didn't blame them\nbecause they are American, because the style of life was in New York. 10 million\npeople. | mean, nobody has no time to be too nice to you because, they are nice if\nyou stop them, but | remember in Europe | asked a cab driver to go to the highest\noffice for some information, about medicine and so on, and |\nasked him how to get there. He said, \"| don't know, but if you want to hop in my cab\nI'll take you there.\" And | was thinking about it, you know? He didn't want to tell me\nwhere to go, | was walking, | couldn't afford a bus. But he didn't want to tell me\nwhere it is. But if | pay for the taxi, he would take me. There are few things, but it\u2019s\na lower class people. But he was not hostile. He was not unfriendly. He was not,\nhe was himself, that's how he was. | learned to just ignore those things eventually.\nFelix Horn 43\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 43\nBut the few little things, | was talking in my mind, you know? But overall my\nexperience coming to the United States, overall, was nothing but highly positive.\nAnd | am saying that in a truthful manner, that | don't recall any bitterness. | never\nencountered any rough treatment or anti-Semitic even type of thing. Never had it,\nno.",
        "A: No, this was almost a day. In fact, early in the morning, | think they started at\n6:00 in the morning | think. Because | remember they walked us out quite early. In\nthe cabin, of course, we were sleeping in hammocks on the ship. We didn't sleep,\nwe were just vegetating in those things. And they, | think by late afternoon we were\nall done. And they deposited that huge crate that we had and then | remember\nmeeting my wife's Aunt from a distance, dressed in a hat and so on, which was\nmaybe 3:00 or 4:00 PM at that time. It took us about six or eight hours maybe, at\nthe most.",
        "A: That's correct.\nFelix Horn 44\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 44",
        "A: There was nothing, there was nothing on the street, correct. The streets were\nempty. The whole port was empty. There were some ships here and there but\nthere was no traffic there, no. We were not usual immigrants, not because, we are\ndisplaced people so we came on government ship, you know, military ship. And we\nfound a lot of support from the crew. We were crowded, we were so crowded.\nThere was no room to sit because we were 1,800 people on 300 or 400 capacity\npeople, you know. And we didn't stay long there, of course, we were taken away\nright away to this hotel.",
        "A: You mean that night when we, only on the ship. This was the day that we\narrived, is that what you mean? That's when we had the ham, raisins, the sweet\nthings which I, they told us it was because of the holiday. Normally we wouldn't get\nit either. And | thought, gee, | wonder what they eat on non-holidays? | got so sick\nfrom that. | love ham, ham | love, but not sweet ham. Not with raisins. But you\nknow for a man who was hungry so many years, you know? Surprising how |\ndistaste the ham with raisins. | was not hungry anymore really. In Vienna | was not\nhungry. No, we were well fed and our American Joint was supporting us very well.\nFelix Horn 45\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 45",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: This is 1953. Right. | worked in the hospital and | didn't know what to do.\nShould | go into practice after internship? Should | go to residency? Residency\nwas another four years. | decided | can't sit. First | want to be a plastic surgeon. To\nbe a plastic surgeon you have to take four years training and | have to be American\nborn or American graduate of an American school in those days. And | was told |\nwould never make it, forget about it. So | decide to get a job in the hospital, so |\nworked in the hospital as a house physician. And | was getting nice money,\n$250.00 a month, that was a lot of money. You could buy a suit, pair of shoes. My\nwife could buy a dress, in a cheap store like Marshall's here or TJ Max. But it was\nnew. We never had new stuff before. In Vienna, we're getting clothes handed to us\nfrom American Joint. Some of it's donated merchandise, you know, but we're\nhappy, lucky to get it. There was nice stuff but, and we met a lot of people in the\nsame boat as us. Some professional, some not professional. Some worked in the\nfactories, some worked in the offices, you know, from Europe. So we, since we met\npeople from my country, from Poland, you more or less cling to each other.\nDifferent city maybe, but we're closer than anybody else. And they are about the\nsame age. So we had about a ton of friends, a ton. Many, many friends from\nFelix Horn 46\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 46\ndifferent parts of Poland. Some from Vienna even. And | met, in Buffalo, a friend of\nmine from Vienna, who left Vienna, he was a journalist, to the United States as an\nimmigrant, a few years later. He didn't know I'll be in Buffalo and he was in Buffalo.\n| met him once in a gathering of my friends, and we knew each other from Vienna.\nSo we dressed like one family, spoke the same language, although we all spoke\nEnglish at that time. Kids were little, about the same age, they played together.\nThe wives had something to do. But my wife, like our parents, felt she should stay\nhome with the kids. And by that time she was pregnant with my second child, | had\na daughter that you met today. And she was born in Buffalo. My son was born in\nRochester.",
        "A: My son was born in 1952, August 28, 1952. | was in Rochester at that time. |\nwas an intern.",
        "A: Genisty (ph) Hospital in Rochester, New York, right.",
        "A: Of my son?\nFelix Horn 47\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 47",
        "A: Gerald David. David after my wife's little brother that perished. That we think\nsurvived the war, now, we just found out.",
        "A: We think we found out. We're not sure yet. We cannot find him yet. But we\nfound, and later maybe.\ntape here, in you're video interview, you and you're wife, you both tell the stories of\nhow you lost him from this basically this fake resort that the Nazis tricked people to\ngoing to and that. Now, when you did the video which was two or three years ago, |\nbelieve, right?",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: About a year ago, we went to a friend of ours here from Warsaw who just found\nher twin brother after fifty plus years. Not knowing he survived, by pure accident,\nshe found him. So we met him. And my wife talked to him and she said, you know\nwhat? | have a little brother who was, when the war started she was seven, he was\nat that time nine years old. He was born in 1933, her little brother was born in 1933.\nFelix Horn 48\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 48\nSo in 1943 or 1944, , | don't remember exactly now. And he\nwas at that time 10 or 11 years old. So he perished. So anyway, talking to this\nfriend now, he said, why don't you write a letter to such and such an office in\nWarsaw, Poland? They have lists of many people, they survived camps and so on.\nWhy don't you do that? My wife did. Never got a response. The man who runs\nthis is an American boy who runs a certain foundation, | think the name is Linder\n(ph) Foundation in Warsaw. Who send a list of survivors in this camp that we know\nhe went to. And his name, Arian name, not real name, Arian name, is listed as\nsurvivor of that camp. This list is from dates from 1946. The year of birth is the\nsame. But the day and month is not clear, that's a copy of a copy of a copy. We\ncannot decode the day and the month, but 1933. His name was Roman Kolvolski\n(ph). So we wrote, we put everything in motion right now. We wrote to Israel. We\nwrote to Sweden. We wrote to England, to Australia, to Switzerland, Austria,\nGermany, to what they call the villa-goot-mach-home (ph), in case he survived he\nmight be collecting rent from German government. So we wrote to Israel, to\nAvrasham (ph), wrote to Israel, different offices there. The Israeli Historical\nDocumentation Office who's Director is a friend of mine from Vienna. And when |\nwrote him about the whole situation, he put every motion he could, the German\nConsulate is a personal friend, so he is very much assisting him in trying to, Red\nFelix Horn 49\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 49\nCross, International Cross, , you name it, everything that's\nknown to maybe get some help from, we wrote to them. As a matter of fact we just\ndedicated a plague for my parents in our Temple. My parents, my sister. And we\nare already reserving a plague for her parents, her brother, when this come about.\nSo | eliminated his name from it. We only sent for her parents, we know they\nperished. And we still hope maybe we'll find him, but it is a very difficult part now,\nhow to find him? He might have changed his name. He might be dead by now. He\ncould be now sixty-some years old, 1933, he would be 63 years old. He could have\ndied, natural causes. He could change his name to a different name. Maybe he\nchanges religion, does not want to have nothing to do with Judaism. | mean, there's\nvery, all these remote possibilities that we don't know. But we don't lose hope. We\ndo everything we can. We will go anyplace. My wife doesn't want to go back to\nPoland, she would go to Poland right now if she would find something. So we're just\nkeeping our hands and our hearts open, that maybe he's alive and hopefully, all\nthose years that we wasted not doing nothing about him because, in 1945 we\nregistered in Poland and also they knew where we are and so on, and there was no\ninformation. The Communists did on purpose, did not provide any communication\nwith people that survived the war. They didn't want that, see? So all the notes that\nFelix Horn 50\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 50\nwere left in Poland, in the different offices and so on, | understand they were\ndestroyed by the Communists, you know? So nobody will find out that, you know?",
        "A: It was about one year. We see each other quite often now. The twin brother of\nthe young lady?\nwas that?",
        "A: Oh, he mailed to us from Warsaw recently, about a month ago or so.",
        "A: Yeah. And we started everything about a month ago. And my son, through the\nInternet, he's a computer wizard, found some 11 people from that concentration\ncamp. And we've called them long distance, some are from New York, some from\nAnnapolis, some are from Michigan, but they never knew him. They did not know\nhim. They were older people, he was a little boy at that time. But it's obvious he\nsurvived because his name appear as a registered person in 1946. Unless, by\nsheer coincidence, the same first name, last name, Roman Kolvolski (ph) is\nidentical with his false papers were, not false, they were real papers, but on an Arian\nname. We got it through the Polish underground, for a young boy who died and\nthey never recorded a death. So the birth certificate could be used again by Polish\nFelix Horn 51\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 51\nunderground to save people. That's how we got the birth certificate, from my wife's\nlittle brother. So it's possible that someone else had the same first name, last\nname. The same year of birth? That would be such a coincidence. So we firmly\nbelieve that he's alive. Or he was alive anyway, we have to find out. So we do the\nbest we can. We just got a letter from Sweden, our friend who puts ads in\nnewspapers, and the Jewish organization there, and so far nothing. So, so far we\nsee no answers to it yet. But we're not losing hope.\nmake you feel a lot of emotions | would imagine?",
        "A: No question about it, no question about it. We don't give up hope. We live with\nhope all our lives. That's what brought us where we are right now. If not hope, of\ncourse, probably would take a gun and shoot myself. Why everybody was being\nkilled, you know?\ntime? You just didn't know it?",
        "A: Yes, guilt feelings. | feel very guilty, yeah. | feel guilty that, but searching my\nmind, logically thinking, | don't know what | could have done. We did leave traces of\nour life, our names, where we are going to be, where we are and so on. And that's\nall we could have done. My wife found her Uncle by accident. One of our students\nFelix Horn 52\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 52\nwas on a train in Austria and sitting on the bench with somebody, they found out,\noh, where are you from? Oh, I'm from Vienna. But you don't speak, you're German\nis with an accent. Says, yes, I'm not Viennese born. Said, so what country are you\nfrom? Poland. Oh, I'm from Poland too. So, you know, that talking to each other\nturns out one was a_ survivor of concentration camp. That was\nour group. So he says, what town are you from? So he told\nhim. I'm a student. What towns are the students from? So he said, mentioned\nseveral towns that, Warsaw, Lublin, Lublin. | had a cousin that use to be in Lublin,\nthen she live in Warsaw. So the student says, what's her name, do you remember\nher name? He didn't remember her name. So he said, I'll tell you, we only have\none couple from Lublin. Her name is, he mentioned my wife's name. He almost\nfainted. It's her cousin. My wife found a cousin from Warsaw who survived the\nconcentration camp. He was on a train going from Germany, from one town to\nanother town, by accident run into this student who is part of our group of students,\nand that's how we found out each other. And since that time, through him, my wife\nfound out she has an Aunt in New York. He knew about the Aunt because his\nmother was the sister of the Aunt in Europe. It was very close, you understand? So\nmy wife found out through the cousin that, he's still alive, in New York, of course we\nare in contact with him, not as much as we should maybe but we are. He's very,\nFelix Horn 53\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 53\nvery ultra, ultra orthodox and we're not as religious so it doesn't fit his philosophy\nyou know, but he was very helpful to us and still a family. It's her cousin. I'm sure\nmy wife would tell you more details about him in her statements, okay?",
        "A: We are praying, we hope that we will.\nwhich year that you said?",
        "A: Gerald David Horn. Then my daughter was Linda Sue Horn. She was born in\nBuffalo, New York. She was born May 13, on Mother's Day at that time, it was\nMother's Day, May 13 in 1956. So she's, that's 40 years old now. Well we slowly\ngaining ground and creating a family. We feel more secure. | had a job, | was\nworking in a hospital. My wife was a full-time homemaker. Two kids now. She was\nthree weeks old, she had pneumonia, she was hospitalized, we were scared we\nwould lose her and so on, but things got to be fine. One negative aspect of my\nrelationship in America with some of the landlords is when she was born, it was in\nMay, he turned off the heat. It was cold in Buffalo. Very cold. It was very cold, and\n| come home with a newborn baby. She caught a cold. And I'm not trying to blame\nour landlord for it. It was cold, the viruses, you know? But the temperature was\ndefinitely below the normal. Normally people use to have their places heated at that\nFelix Horn 54\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 54\ntime. And when | complained, couldn't you heat our apartment with my newborn\nbaby that's just come home, she was a little low weight, he said, no, no. | need\nyou're apartment now because my family is coming and we need an apartment so |\nwant you to move out anyway. So | thought I'd wait until you're baby maybe gets\nslightly bigger than | want to approach you on it anyway. So | seen there's no point\ndiscussing things so | found an apartment not too far, through my friends and so on.\nVery lovely apartment. They were American Polish people, not Jewish, that\nnobody want to take a newborn baby in at that time. And they were the only people.\n| was knocking the doors, from door to door. They accepted us with a newborn\nbaby. Until today, they are just like, my daughter still call them my grandma. She's\nnow, for eight years, this lady now, she lost her husband in the meantime. We lived\ndownstairs, they lived upstairs. Like a family together. And they, we worship them,\nuntil today, she's a widow now. Were trying to assist her a little bit, we help her.\nShe remarried but they are up in age, sick and so on. So we, they are our dear, not\nonly benefactors, but friends. They're on the weddings with the kids, her children,\nSO we are good friends until today. As a matter of fact, when Washington D.C. on\nour testimony for the Museum, we invited by her daughter, this lady from Buffalo,\nwho lives near Washington, her mother's there, and stay with us for a few days.\nShe was raising our Linda, my daughter. So we are very close with them, yeah. So\nFelix Horn 95\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 55\nafter a few years in Buffalo, three years or so, it was about 1959, 1960, | had to take\nby Boards, | didn't have a license yet. | worked in the hospital, that's all. So | was\nstudying and there were two States. Not each state approved . . .[End of Side 1 of\nTape 2]. . . foreign graduates at that time. Don't forget, this was a time after the\nwar. American physicians were in the Army and they needed doctors here so they\nwanted all the doctors in the hospital, because there was no one to serve in the\nhospital, there were not enough doctors. So when | worked in the hospital in Buffalo\nthey didn't want to let me go either. But | didn't want to build a future working in the\nhospital until one day they won't need you no more, | want to be on my own. So |\nhad to take, make the license anyway. Besides time legally would have changed\nand | wouldn't get a license to even work in a hospital, which eventually turned out\nto be so. So | decided to quit the hospital. | was studying. And two states were\naccepting foreign graduates, which one was Ohio and one was Illinois. So |\nthought, well, let me take a trip to Chicago, take a look. | came to Chicago, | fell in\nlove with Chicago. | was on Lake Shore. | remember staying in a hotel on La Salle\nStreet. And | just looked around, a beautiful city. Downtown was beautiful. State\nStreet was beautiful in those days. Different than now. And | was given a letter of\nrecommendation by one of my colleagues, a doctor in Buffalo, to one of the doctors\nin another family, personal friends in Chicago, so | had someone to talk to at least.\nFelix Horn 56\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 56\nSo | called them up and became friends right away. Both of them were from Poland\ntoo so it made me feel more close at home, more or less. One physician was\npracticing already here. The other party, he was a CPA. And they introduced me to\ntheir pediatrician, an American born, and so | make already a few acquaintences.\nJust being a visitor to Chicago. | fell in love with Chicago. | said, that's the city |\nwant to. | went back home. | started studying very hard and in 1959, forgot what\nmonth, October | think, | came to Chicago to take my exams, my Board. And while\ntaking my exams, | seen somebody from a distance, during the intermission, that |\nthought | seen a ghost. And | screamed spontaneously, not thinking, his first name.\nHis name was Bolick (ph). \"Bolick (ph)?\" The person jumped, turned around, didn't\nknow who called him because he changed his name for many years already.\nNobody knew his name, except | did because he was my classmate in Lee-boof\n(ph), Lemberg when | was taking first and second in medicine. We roomed together\nin dormitory. | didn't Know he had survived the war. When | approached him, he\nlook at me, he did not know who | was. And | recognized him right away. | said,\n\"Well let me tell you, | won't tell you who | am, but I'll bring some few little facts to\nmaybe wake up you're memory. Do you remember City of Lee-boof (ph),\nLemberg?\" He said, \"Yes.\" He knew that | was somebody that, | Knew him. And\nhe was pale like he was going to faint. And | was so emotionally upset and I, myself\nFelix Horn of\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 57\n| didn't know how to behave. And | wouldn't let him get away from me, | was just\nhugging him and he hugged me but he didn't know whom he was hugging. Finally |\ntold him who | was. He couldn't believe it. He didn't recognize me. He hugged me\nand kissed me and so on. Turned out he lives in the South someplace, in the South\nsomeplace, in the | think, someplace. Birmingham, Alabama, that's\nwhere it was, yeah. And he come in here to take his Board, same as | did. Well\nanyway, I'd like to tell you, he passed the Boards too. He moved to Chicago. |\ncame back home. | gathered my family and | said to them, we are moving to\nChicago. But before that | have to go back to Chicago, find a place for us. So | was\nintroduced to a few other doctors, different hospitals here. Edgewater Hospital is\none of them. Some of them were looking for a partner. | had a license, | felt very\ngood. | felt very secure. That's the most important paper in my life. And they, no\none wanted to be my partner. But | was so naive, | didn't know you need lawyers,\nwrite a contract, all those things. His word was fine for me, you know? And | move\nmy family to this area on the basis of his promise, his word, that's all. His office was\nin the suburb of Chicago, in River Grove. He helped me find myself an apartment in\nElmwood Park, which was about 10 minutes or so, 15 minute drive from his office\nand his house. Nice, third story apartment, two bedrooms, modern, elegant, very\nfine. He promised me a salary. Never heard so much money before, which turned\nFelix Horn 58\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 58\nout to be not that much, but to me it was a lot. And | sign a contract for six months,\nonly | didn't know what I'm going to do, an option, take another six month. And we\nmoved to Chicago. | introduced my wife to those friends that | was introduced to by\nmy friends from Buffalo, this CPA and this other doctor. And right away the ladies\ngot busy and they introduced other ladies from Poland too, so in no time we knew\nSO many people, had so many friends. In the meantime, a new Temple in Emerald\nPark, actually River Forest, found out that we are newcomers and survivors, they\nasked us to join them there. One was Orthodox, the other one was Reform. | didn't\nfeel like joining, further | couldn't afford anything yet. They told me not to worry\nabout it, not to, but | didn't want to go for that. And some of the people came to us,\nvisited us, living in Emerald Park, now our neighbors. Not too many Jewish people\nlived there, mostly Italian, , but they were very nice to us. Everybody\nwas nice. And she introduce us and took my wife to the University and to the\nMuseum. We lived in Vienna, there was nothing but music and Museums, you\nknow, the whole city is nothing but culture. How Nazis could develop in so high a\nsophisticated society as Austria, people are so intelligent. Everybody with a degree.\nThere's no bums there. Everybody had a degree. The guy who was sweeping the\ncity had a University degree. | mean, it was not uncommon that a barber had a\nUniversity degree, but never practiced whatever he was studying. Highly intellectual\nFelix Horn 59\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 59\ncountry. But vicious. They were more vicious, it was vicious Nazis, more than the\nGermans. See? But anyway, she introduced us, this lady from the Synagogue, to\nmany people and so on. In the meantime, | found out that my associate, that | was\nsuppose to be his partner, did not tell me the whole truth. And when | found out\nfrom the hospital, some of my colleagues knew Carl, said, \"You know, we know\nyou're partner very well. Do you have a contract with him?\" | said, \"A contract?\nWhat for? He told me I'm his partner.\u201d He look at me like I'm an imbecile. He said,\n\"What do you mean he told you? How do you know, how long have you known\nhim?\" \"Well, | just met him.\u201d \"You know what? Ask him to sign a contract.\u201d So it\nstarted to dawn on me, maybe | should do that. | talk to my wife. \"Why should |\nsign a contract?\" She said, \"Well, we're living in a legal society today. Maybe that's\nthe right thing to do.\u201d So | approached him. In the meantime, he was taking special\nto residency in anesthesia, | was running the office, the practice. Behind my back\nhe tried to sell the practice to somebody. He told me if | work for him for two years |\ncan take over his practice. | have no money, | couldn't buy nothing. | had nothing.\nAnd the money he promised was good, you know? So, | said, \"I want to sign a\ncontract.\u201d He said, \"Look, | don't want to sign a contract\", he said to me. \"Because |\nmight not like you. You only work for me, what? Two or three months already.\"\nMaybe, what, two or three months, you already know. People like me, | like you're\nFelix Horn 60\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 60\npatients, they like me too. Your busy, we're busy. You don't bother doing night calls\nno more. | do all the night calls. That you told the patient over the phone she has\nflu turned out to be acute gall bladder disease, gall bladder attack, have to wake up\nat 2:00 in the morning, you operate on the patient at night. | do dirty work. |\ndeserve a contract now. Well | don't know if | like you're work. If | don't like you,\nyou'll go the next day. | said, you mean you won't give me ,\nNo, this is something, no. There are plenty of guys like you out there, coming from\nEurope, from South America. There are so many refugee doctors, you know? So |\nsaid, you know what, | have to think it over. | don't care what you do, he says. You\nare working for me now, you're being paid. And he always paid me on time. All ofa\nsudden, one day he got a telephone call from a doctor, are you Dr. Horn? | said,\nyes. You know, funny, because | understand that you are a physician in practice\nwith Dr. So-and-so. | said, yes. He said, because he just approached me. Are you\nplanning to take over the practice? | said, well that's what he told me. After he\nfinishes residency on anesthesia, | am running his practice so he will have income.\nHe's paying a salary on me, but after these two years | am taking over the practice.\n| don't know, he approached me, he wants to sell the practice to me. He want me to\nbuy it. | said, he never said nothing to me like this. No. Why would he do that? He\npromised me the practice. | was so naive. | couldn't believe it. | didn't learn those\nFelix Horn 61\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 61\nthings, the tricks of, in medicine you're not a businessman, we're not businessmen.\nIn medicine you wake up in the middle of the night, they need you, you go there. If\nthey don't pay, they don't pay. So they say, send me a bill, you send a bill, you\nnever collect anyway. Most people don't know. But this was not the issue here.\nSome poor people, | wouldn't let them down because they cannot pay. | mean, this\nwas medicine. And he said, you know, | better, don't touch that thing. Fine. |\nappreciate it, | won't buy it. | want to assure, | won't step on you're toes. When he,\nthis doctor came in that evening to the office after his courses in the hospital, and |\nsaid to him, you know what? | want a signed contract tonight, | said. And then he\nsaid, what about if | don't? Then I'm walking out right now. Right now you're\nwalking out? What are you going to do? He started laughing. | said, don't laugh.\nDon't worry about it. | survived worse thing than this. I'm not worrying about it, |\nhave a license. I'll have my own office. Ha-ha-ha-ha. He started laughing. He\nsaid, you know you cannot start a practice like this today. There are so many\ndoctors coming, you know you're crazy. You'll never survive. | said, well | won't let\nyou worry about it. | worry about myself. And | said good-bye. Next day, he calls\nme. Aren't you going to the office? | said, no. There are people coming in. That's\ntoo bad. Remember what you told me? If you don't like me, next day I'm gone. No\ntwo weeks notice. | told you, | don't like you, I'm gone. Good-bye. My God, this\nFelix Horn 62\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 62\nwas it. | went to the hospital that | was on staff and | told the Director that | am no\nmore an associate of this given doctor. He said, oh we know all about it. | was\nsurprised less than three months. So | said, what should | do then? | mean, | would\nlike to open my own practice. Yeah, but see if you open your own practice, you\nhave to re-apply to the staff again. And you are on your own. Before you only were\naccepted because you are an associate of Dr. so-and-so. But I'll have some use for\nyou, see. In order to be accepted that will cost you $25,000.00. | said, | don't have\nthat kind of money. | only worked three months, | barely pay my rent. Well, I'm\nsorry then. You cannot be accepted. Forget about bothering with application. You\nwouldn't believe it. | learned the American reality in medicine from then on. | was\ngoing from hospital to hospital. Like a club, they all wanted the same thing.\nLutheran General wanted $20,000.00. Gottlieb (ph) wanted $20,00.00. And\nhospital, | won't mention no names, they want no money\nfrom me but the Director of the hospital is a physician. He said, every patient you\nadmit to this hospital, if you are working the emergency room or you are on call,\npeople come in without a doctor, they call you. If you wiggle up to that patient, you\npay me half, whatever comes from that patient. | said, what? | never heard this\nbefore. What do you mean? For what? Pay you for what? Are you going to work\nwith me on that patient? No, no, you don't understand. We do you a favor. You're\nFelix Horn 63\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 63\ngoing to get into a given situation, you'll have to wait for a patient. You be patient,\nright away, you go work the emergency room. A patient would come in. Whatever\ncomes to me, hospitalize, the fee is going to be $200.00, you pay me $100.00. |\nsaid, well how am | going to do the taxes? | mean, what do you mean? Why? |\ndon't understand it. Well, you'll learn fast. That's what it is. Think it over, let me\nknow. | quit. What | did, | moved away from the whole area | was before. | didn't\nwant no one accusing me of being a competitor, so | worked in a strange street on\nHarlem Avenue, near between Edison and Belmont. It was a brand new medical\noffice. | see it empty. | knock at the door, walked in. The Director was an American\ndentist, Dr. DeRome (ph) of French ancestry or so. | introduced myself. | told him\nthe whole story. | am anewcomer to Chicago, | don't know a soul here. | am not on\nstaff at the hospital anymore. | was, | told him, | worked three months for another\ndoctor, which | was very disappointed. | would like to open an office. | have no\nmoney to pay for rent. Not now. | have no patients either. And | was wondering,\nmaybe if you listen to my story, maybe you can help me? A man | never met\nbefore. No one introduced me to him, | just Knocked at the door. He had seven\nsuites in the building. A brand new building. Only two offices were taken. And his\nwas the third. There were four vacant. What do you want? Take a look at the\noffices. Which office do you want? | said, well wait a minute. We have to make\nFelix Horn 64\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 64\nsome financial understanding. How is it going to be? He said, well you told me.\nYou don't have any money. So | said, well, so what are you going to do? Well | will\nlet you work until you can make some money. | said, but | don't know how long it\nwill take me. | don't have no patients, | don't Know anybody. If you have no money\nyou're not going to pay me. And you be the one to decide what you can pay me. |\ndidn't believe what | hear. A man | never met before. He liked me. | liked him right\naway. He was like a father image to me. | was young. | was 39, this was 1960, |\nwas 40. And he was, maybe at that time, maybe 75 or so. And | picked out that\noffice. And he advised me, | will do it for you. The local paper, he put a note with\nmy picture in it. A new doctor and the . You were allowed no\nadvertisement in those days. Now you can advertise. Only to introduce you, an\nintroduction type of a thing. Family practice, general practitioner and my picture. |\nwas suppose to open the office 1st of September. The middle of August, after | left\nthe other office, two days later, from the old office | worked from, my other doctor,\nthere was a pharmacist next door to it. The Chief Pharmacist, the owner, calls me.\nDr. Horn, | have many patients from this doctor's office, asking about what\nhappened to you, where are you? And | don't know what to do. | said, how did you\nfind me there? Well, | have my ways. | am here, am |? I'm talking to you. | found\nyou, right? | said, yes, you did. | read in the paper. You put ad in the paper,\nFelix Horn 65\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 65\nintroductory? Yeah. So he says, | know where you are. But what schedule, can |\ntell them? | said, no, | don't think so because then he will accuse me of taking his\npatients away. Look, but they are not going back to him. They told me that. They\ngo to a different doctor. Might as well to, they like you, they want to come stay with\nyou. | said, okay. | didn't have no furniture yet. | had one chair and my satchel\nbag. That's all | had, one chair. And like making house calls, you know, you don't\nneed much, just you're bag. Stethoscope, all you're little instruments you got there,\nyou know, percussion hammer and tongue depressor and ;\nokay? All those things | had, so | put the patient on the chair and | had my bag on\nthe floor, that's how | started. | had a big window there so mostly | looked through\nthe window, looking at the traffic. Nothing else. The patient paid me. | didn't have\nno stationary, nothing yet. That's how it started. Well making a long story short, in\nthree months | was so busy | didn't know what to do with myself. | was so\noverworked. My colleague doctor, asked me to make for\nthem, they are too busy making house calls. So I'm making\nfor them. | had people pay a nursing homes, so Sundays and Wednesdays on my\nday off | was making calls at nursing homes. Nights, | was delivering babies and at\nnights | was making house calls and so on. People are in wheelchairs, they couldn't\ncome to the office. It was nothing urgent, of course. | picked my times. | will do it\nFelix Horn 66\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 66\nWednesdays or Sundays or at night, you know, when | have time. And they were\ngrateful that | come in because their doctor would prescribe over the telephone. |\nwas taught never do that. You make one mistake you will be regretting it and it was\ntrue. | felt if they have no money to pay, that's fine. But | have to make a house call\nto see them, to treat them. | would not treat them over the phone. Even if | knew\nthe people, you don't know what's wrong over the phone, they talk a different story.\nYou cannot treat on the symptoms, you have to find out what's wrong with them.\nAnd after three months, | was so busy, one day, who knocks on my door? Uncle\nSam. IRS. They want to see my books. What happened? | took a trip to Europe\nfor six weeks and on the cruise | never felt how do rich people feel? You go ona\ncruise? | drove to New York, | had a new Oldsmobile, convertible. | left the car in a\nparking garage there on a pier, they do this specially. | boarded the ship, Gilda\nFrance, a new French boat. If paradise were something as close as this was then\nwe're in heaven. And when | come back, my colleague said, Felix, you Know, we\nthought you were a smart kid. But you're stupid. You work three months, you took\noff for six weeks, you destroyed everything you made it. American people don't like\nthat. That's a on them. | said, wait a minute, | didn't offend\nnobody. | left another doctor, a colleague of mine, in the next building. He was\nwilling to see my patients and he didn't have nobody to cover for him so we cover\nFelix Horn 67\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 67\neach other now. So he said, they are going to my colleague. | said, | know\n. Well, | came back, you know what? | could not cover all\nmy patients, they call me, | was so busy. Uncle Sam went through my books. The\nonly thing that cost me is my CPA, my accountant because he costs me $500.00 at\na time, you had to take them out for dinner or lunch or something, it costs me\n$500.00, his time he spend with them going over my books. And this only time was\nchecked by IRS since 1950, forty-six years in this country. | worked. Every penny\nwas accounted to it. | am one of the biggest American patriots. | am one of, on this\nblock right here that you see, I'm the only European born, American citizen, a real\npatriot who has flag out. And then he'll leave holidays, no. But I've got to tell you, |\nwas busy, | practice, you know. My life was good to me. I'm glad what! got | got on\nmy own. | have cherished memories of my wife's family, Uncle and every\nsupportive to us. They help me buy my first house. They give me $5,000.00 on\naccount of it. | didn't want to take the money from them so they give us a loan and\nthey said, listen, if it takes you a year, two, three, five to pay back, fine. No interest\ncharged. They didn't charge me interest. | didn't want it even, but with two kids, you\nknow. It was hard with kids to find apartments, so on. So! buy a house. That's the\nonly house we owned. That's the house we bought in 1960.\nFelix Horn 68\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 68",
        "A: This house, yeah. We raised two kids here in this house. And we believed that\neducation was of utmost importance. All of us, the whole family, even my daughter-\nin-law, son-in-law, all University graduates. My son is a physician, he's a top notch\nspecialist and he's an ophthalmologist, laser specialist. My daughter, Northwestern\nUniversity graduate cum laude. Both my kids. And my daughter-in-law is a\nPodiatrist. My son-in-law is a Doctor of Philosophy, he's a Director, works for the\nState, Director of School Systems. You know? And we have four grandchildren\nnow. I'll be married now 54 years December, on the 13th of December, fifty-four\nyears married to the same girl. We are very happy, very happy family. My kids are\nmy best friends and | know | am their best friend. And | achieved what | wanted to.\nThe only regret that | have, my parents. They never lived to see it, you know?\nThat's still the problem. And now, of course, hopefully we'll find maybe my wife's\nlittle brother. We'll look for little brother, little brother. He\nwas with us. We feel guilty because we let him go. But when the streets, we had\nnothing, no place to go. When you can be shot any minute and find us, anyone\nmoving on the street at dark, you know, they are going to\nstop, no arrest. They kill you. There was no one below us on the street, you know,\nso we knew. And this looked so prime, we wanted to go with him, but they wanted\n$1,000.00 per person from us. We didn't have that money so we couldn't go. Do\nFelix Horn 69\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 69\nyou believe that, that doesn't sound real. And the only reason, how he went,\nbecause the person in charge there, a German SS or somebody, his mistress was\nmy wife's girlfriend from school. And she took him with her. We knew that Sadie,\nshe goes there. We knew that's safe. But everybody wanted to get in there.\nEverybody went there. If you had money you went there. And people who had no\nmoney like us, they didn't accept us, so we didn't go.",
        "A: Well | retired from private practice already ten years, exactly two days ago, on\nthe 15th of August, which was ten years | retired. See, | was witnessing the\ntransformation of American medicine since | started to what it is right now. And |\ndidn't see eye to eye wants going on. And | have to live with that. And | don't think |\ncould stomach it. | could not understand it. | could not live with myself to, | was 26\nyears in practice, and | want to walk out with my head straight. | don't want to lie to\nmy patients. If | had to lie to my patients, they cannot be hospitalized, or if they are\nin the hospital, to be kicked out of the hospital sooner than | would expect to, | had\nto lie to them, that they are ready to go. Because officially, it's not the truth. And |\nFelix Horn 70\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 70\nfelt that sooner or later something is going to happen to them and | said, look, my\nson is married, he's in practice. My daughter is married. And so, it's only me and\nmy wife, the two of us. We have a home, a little home. For the two of us, it's more\nthan enough. So, why should I? In the meantime, some of my competitors, a\nyoung woman, spread the rumor that | want to sell the practice, to create a panic in\nmy patients. And | had no intention yet, at that time. | was just toying with the idea,\nbut one day a patient called me, he said, Dr. Horn, is it true you're selling you're\npractice? You're quitting? | said, who told you that? Oh, Kathy, my neighbor goes\nto Dr. so-and-so and this doctor, a woman doctor, told her. | said, no that's not true.\nLet me find out why she say that. And | approached this woman doctor and she\ndenied it at first, but finally she admitted it. She heard some patient said something,\nwhatever, she wanted to buy my practice. So you know, it gave me the idea,\nmaybe it's the right thing to do. And that's what crystallized, one night | talked to my\nwife, | said, you know what? What do we need it for? By the time | get home to eat\ndinner, 11:00 at night. | never see my kids growing up. | was too busy. | had to, |\ndidn't have nobody else. We had no parents, grandparents, nobody to take care of\nthem. We had three or four babysitters and my wife was a babysitter all the time\nbecause she was a homemaker full time. Until the kids grew up, then she went to\nUniversity also. She will tell you her story herself. Right here in Chicago, she\nFelix Horn 71\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 71\ngraduated from the University. When the kids were going to school, she asked her\nMom, let me see you're grades. | thought maybe it\u2019s the right thing to do. And | hit\nthe jackpot. Why? | have heard the hospital. | asked them, I'm ready to quit\npractice here. A hospital use to buy practices. They want to get the patients. |\nbelonged to two hospitals at that time. One in Displanes (ph), Catholic Hospital,\nwhich always was good in Catholic surroundings. And the other one, in City, was\nold. You have to go to Northwest Hospital in the city. We should have the best\nreputation, but resurrection to cover this hospital. So | approached the hospital and\nthey want to buy my practice. Thinking that by this, there was some restrictions at\nthat time with Media-care, they thought more patients would come and they would\nfill up the hospital so they can survive. Because many hospitals closed up, they\ncouldn't survive. So they bought my practice and they sold everything. They sold\nmy practice, my equipment, my accounts receivable, my building. American\nTelephone and Wire wanted to buy my clinic too. Not for medical purposes, the\nlocation was something they needed. The size of it's . But |\nsaid, | cannot sell the physical plan without the interior because all my money is in\nthe records and so on. My patients, you know? So | didn't sell it to them, but the\nhospital bought it. | did very well, invested some money and so on. And I'm more\ncomfortable. After two months in being home, not doing nothing, my other hospital\nFelix Horn 72\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 72\nin the found out and | am one of the founders, the Holy\nFamily Hospital in Desplains (ph). To this dentist, my benefactor at the office, who,\nhis family lived in Displanes (ph), he said, Dr. Horn, | will send you to the hospital\nand they will ask you for no money. And it was true. Jewish Hospital's want money\nfrom me. They didn't care if | starve or not. Catholic Hospital gave me an\nopportunity. | became a step-member, without a penny. And | am very, very\ndedicated to this hospital. I've done a lot of free work for the hospital, for the poor.\nCatholic charities. Being Jewish, | admit who | am. They all know about it. Our\nChairman of Private Practice, , that's a Jewish doctor and\nthere are not too many Jewish doctors in those days. Now there are more. | feel\ngood there. So! worked at Hospital. So they found out. They said, Felix, we have\na Clinic in Wheeling, it belongs to our hospital. We lost one of our doctors, just\ndecided to quit. And we know you so we don't have to go trial and leave, you want\nto start tomorrow, you're welcome to.

        "A: .. . if | want to walk-in clinic. | was use to my, the loyalty of my patients. Walk-in\nclinic is like a clinic, people walk in with a chip on their shoulder, you don't know who\nthey are, what they want. Drug addicts and they want dope and all these things,\nyou know? | was not looking for work at this time, not in this stage of the game.\nAnd now | was comfortable, financially and so on. But | was, | missed the contact.\nHuman contact. | missed it. | never told my wife that, but | delivered 4,500 babies\nin family practice. | have babies that grew up, that we were invited recently to their\nweddings, that | delivered. And my mother told me once, Dr. Horn, we use to live\nwith my daughter, she told me that if you ever live long enough and my daughter\ngets married and if you be invited to the wedding, you'll come. Well the moment of\ntruth is here. She is getting married and we want you there. We were there. Let\nme tell you. There's no money paid for the emotions for everything we went\nthrough. Three hundred people. The standing ovations. | am met by some\npatients, friends of my former patients too. That you know is worth it. All those\nyears and sleepless nights, no food. Not food because you can have no time to eat\nmany times. And it was, money didn't mean that much. But that retribution, that\ncontribution in the human emotions, you know, what | got back for it paid me for\neverything, everything. | am very grateful for that and that's my pay back. And |\nFelix Horn 14\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 74\nsaid, that's okay, I'll go to the clinic. But you know what? I'll maybe work with a chip\non my shoulder because | know something about clinics, you know? But this is not\nclinic someplace in the South side here or so, its not in a suburb and so on, and you\nknow what? | liked that. | liked it, | worked for five years. They closed the clinic up\nfor five years, there were five doctors there. | recommend some of my colleagues\nto work there. | was the only one they transferred to the Hospital proper, they\nopened the same thing in the Hospital. And they let the other doctors go. |'m still\nworking there. So | work on a part-time basis for the clinic. In the meantime, the\nhospital needed somebody to do what we call utilization review. Which is exactly\nwhat | touched up on before, in that we check on patients unjustly hospitalized,\nunnecessarily. Meaning that they could have it done, the treatment, as out-patient.\nX-ray of the stomach, you don't have to be in the hospital to have an x-ray of the\nstomach, but in old days you were hospitalized because insurance paid only if you\nwere in the hospital. Otherwise, they don't pay no x-rays. So older people didn't\nwant to go into hospital, that's why insurance companies knew, if this old lady wants\nto go to the hospital, | mean she's probably sick or she deserves that, right? But\ntoday is different. You might be very sick but as long as you can do it as an out-\npatient, they do as an out-patient. So | am like a medical policeman now. | am\nchecking the records of other physicians, looking at the quality care issues. Looking\nFelix Horn 75\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 75\nif they are justly hospitalized or if they are unnecessarily staying in the hospital after\nthey did this job with their doctor. It happens quite often. Not to the fault of the\nhospital or the doctor, fault of the families. It\u2019s a big, legal type of a component\ninvolved here, that the family is using legal track as a blackmail. Three daughters\nhave a mother in the hospital. The doctor discharged her, goes to nursing home.\nThey cannot decide which nursing home. $600.00 a day costs the room. She could\nbe in a nursing home already, the hospital will give you 24 hours to decide which\nhome. But one says one home, the other one wants the other home. Meanwhile\ni's four days already, nothing done for the patient. And Medi-care doesn't pay for\nthe bill because nothing has been done. The hospital is loosing money. So we\nenter here, talk to the family. Look, we're sorry, you have to take you're mother to,\notherwise you are liable for the bill now, from that day on, nothing done for you're\nmother because you argue which nursing home you want to take. What's you're\ndecision? The day will come, | know, the girl is going to tell them which nursing\nhome to go to. Now you have a choice here. No, no, no. One day her death.\nWhat do you mean? We're going to talk to my attorney, talking to my lawyer. Say\nlook, | am in a official government position here, this medical position, and | am not\nafraid of a lawyer. | don't do nothing illegal. You do something illegal. You demand\nsomething which doesn't belong to you no more. You're spending government's\nFelix Horn 76\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 76\nmoney. There are taxpayers money being paid for you're mother, that she could be\nin a nursing home that costs a fraction of it. But Medi-care is going to pay for extra\nmonths at least. And this kind of a thing, you know, you got a lot of hostility,\nconfrontation type of situations with people. But that's part of life. | get use to it. It's\na job and | think I'm doing the right thing. | do not like what's going on. Even when |\ndo that, doesn't mean | approve it.",
        "A: When we moved to Chicago it was about 1960. We moved to Chicago, my son\nwas eight years old at that time. We moved to this house. He made friends with a\nlittle boy across the street, across the alley. We don't know, an alley actually, but it\nuse to be an alley there. Sunday they were playing together. The same age and\nthey are friends until today, all those years. One is in a different city right now, but\nanyway, we were friends. We cling to people easily because, | don't know, maybe\nFelix Horn 77\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 77\nwe are more extrovert. Is it because of the war? | don't know. | constantly say to\nmyself, how would | be if not for the war? But one episode stuck to my mind. That\none Sunday afternoon, maybe 4 or 5 PM, his name was Mickey, the little boy was\nMickey. His parents, American-Polish decent, American born. They were playing.\nAll of a sudden, my boy, eight years old, comes and started crying. | said, why are\nyou crying? What happened? Sunday, | was home. | play with Mickey. So what\nhappened? Did he hit you? No, he didn't hit me. Well, why are you crying? Well\nhe had to go away, he says. Why are you crying? He had to go away, where is he\ngoing? He's going to his grandpa. For dinner. His parents, his two sisters and him\nare going. And | want to go to grandpa for dinner too. | said, well, you cannot go to\nhis grandpa because you don't know them and they don't know you. You don't\nexpect to be invited. He was an eight year old kid, pretty smart and understands\nsomeone. He says, where's my grandpa? That's how it started. Until then he\nnever asked for it. | would never talk to him about it. And that's how it started. So |\ntold him that we have some pictures of my grandfather and you're grandfather,\nyou're Mom's father. And we have pictures of the grandparents, my parents and\nher parents. The only picture | don't have is my sister's. Didn't have it. So | show\nhim the pictures and he asked what happened. He couldn't understand, what mean\nNazis and so on. But! told him they perished during the war, they were killed by\nFelix Horn 78\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 78\nmean people, German people, Nazis, by Nazis. He asked what are Nazis? So |\ntold him, but he did not comprehend too much of it, you know? But he knew they\nwere dead, he knew what death means, being, going to the funerals and so on. So\nhe more or less was satisfied for a while only. But this was coming up more often\nthan, again, ask the same question, why can't | see my Aunt or my grandma? And |\nsaid, well, they are not alive no more. Where is this, which cemetery are they\nburied? | said, well, there's no cemetery. He says, what do you mean? How do\nyou be dead and not be buried? So how are you going to explain to a youngster\nlike this, you perish and you have no place to worship the grave. So | told him that\nin those days there were mean people in Germany. They tried to kill all the Jews\nand they killed my parents and you're Mom's parents and my sister and they didn't\nbury them they burned them to ashes. And what they made out of ashes were\ndifferent things, fabrics, and they made soap and so on. And he couldn't\nunderstand it. And this would go on for many, a few years until he was maybe, 14,\n13 or 14, that's what really penetrated what happened. But interesting, since that\ntime, when we made our testimony at the Holocaust Museum in Washington, my\nson and my daughter all have their own copies. We have one. My son has three\ncopies. My daughter, they had three volumes. And they didn't want to talk about it\nno more. But he became such an anti-Nazi. He just, it's had that influence on him,\nFelix Horn 79\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 79\nthat injustice was done to his grandparents, that he never met, that he missed in his\nyouth, you know? Because the happiness is, if Mom don't want to give it, ask you're\ngrandma. There's some, even T-shirts, seeing the writing on the, on that. If you're\nparents are too strict with you, you're grandparents always allow you to do what you\nwant to do. And he always felt that he missed something on it, you know, he\nmissed out. But then he would never talk about it, he never wanted to touch the\nsubject at all.",
        "A: No, no, no. We didn't talk about the subject since he was about 14, 15, | would\nsay. He knew all about it, since that time he is quite acquainted, politically\norientated with what he knows all about, he knows Holocaust, and he was in\nWashington. And my daughter was recently again with my wife in Holocaust\nMuseum, so they are acquainted. He does not want to discuss it. He refused to\ntalk about it because he has, he tells me, | said why don't you want to talk about it?\nl, as a victim of the system, | feel strong enough to face up, to talk about it. | break\ndown here and there if | talk about some things. Mainly if | talk about my parents.\nUnbelievable relationship | had with my parents, unbelievable. But | think we have\nthe same relationship, with me and my children. And he's said, you know Dad, I'll\nlook at those tapes after you have passed away. | won't touch them as long as\nFelix Horn 80\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 80\nyou're with us, | don't want to look at it. | want to enjoy every minute of it, at present.\nAnd all of a sudden, on his own initiative, he elected to have a father/son once a\nmonth dinner. Father/son only. Me and him going after work or some meeting,\ntogether, without his family, without my family, only me and him. | think what\ntriggered the whole thing is one of my personal friends recently passed away, also a\nsurvivor, from Germany, a German Jew. And his son is my son's best friends. And\nthe trauma that his friend, the son of my friend, went through made my son realize\nhow fragile is life. Don't take it for granted. We're here today, and don't know how\nlong. And he wanted to enjoy my presence, our presence, as long as he lives. He\ndoesn't want to tarnish anything with any bad memories, anything, what will come\nup with the discussions and so on. He knows the history. He knows the story of our\nsurvival. He has the tapes in his possession. So sooner or later, he is just delaying\nthe truth. Although he knows the truth, but he's not ready to face up to it. And | am\nnot pushing it. | don't know if | am right or wrong, but | think it would be wrong trying\nto push something that he's not ready to accept right now. He knows the truth, he\nknows that. And he knows what he lost in his childhood by missing his\ngrandparents. Nobody came back. There's no way we can replace it. | miss it too.\nMore, because it was not my grandparents, | miss my parents. | was 17 when | lost\nthem. | was not ready for an independent life. And he knows that, so he's fortunate,\nFelix Horn 81\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 81\nhe's older. He is now 43, 44. He's an adult man. But he doesn't want to face up to\nit. And I'm not going to disturb that kind of a status quo.\nof Holocaust survivors and families. And in some families the situation has resulted\nin some forms of tension, you know, where the children feel an extra burden\ntowards their parents. And in some cases, the parents, because of all they've lost,\nyou know?",
        "A: How would you explain this? | mean, | am at a loss to understand that.\nways. When people interact, anything can happen really. It sounds like, from what\nyou're describing, this is, nothing like this has ever come up here.",
        "A: No, never. As a matter of fact, | did expect maybe there would be pity or a little\nsorrow with what | had to go through. My children, our children, consider us heroes.\nAnd | told them, I'm not a hero. Whatever | did to survive was not deliberate. It\nwas pure accidental, fate, you name it, whatever you want to. | didn't deserve any\nprice for something that | didn't deserve. | didn't. I'm here, but not because | done\nsomething about it. Maybe if | used common sense and logic, maybe | wouldn't be\nhere today. Maybe it was spontaneous and reflexive, | would say. A reflex, you\nknow? Jump instead of stand or sit or so, whatever. | don't know. But my kids\nFelix Horn 82\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 82\nalways, and my personal friends, American friends, my colleague doctor in the\nhospital, they are full of admiration for me. | still, this disturbs me, | don't know why.\n| didn't do nothing to deserve this thing. | am here and | am a very fortunate\nperson. | am here because | cherished life. My whole family since early, youth will\nall cherish life and want to make the best out of it. We try not to waste our life on\nridiculous things. On something that my, life is short. Or even if its long, its not long\nenough. And if you waste you're time in life and do certain things that you might\nregret, you cannot turn the clock back again. So there was one thing that | got from\nmy parents, from my father, he was a strict disciplinarian. And | always respect him\nfor it. And | was penalized many times when | was a kid. | never held it against him\nbecause | always deserved it. Whatever | got | deserved it. He loved me in his own\nway and | knew this was love, that's why he disciplined me and so on. | never\ncomplained. | took it like a man. And | cried when | was little. | cried but | never\ncomplained. And | think it made me more mature, a little harder person maybe,\nmore understanding of other people. It taught me fairness, straightforwardness,\nhonesty. And direct, going right directly in front of you. | never, | always believe,\nthere's no such a thing, | was taught by my Dad, that you cannot achieve in you're\nlife if you badly wanted to. If you badly want to do something in you're life, be\nsomething you want to be, you have to make that effort. Nobody is going to give it\nFelix Horn 83\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 83\nto you. You get all assistance, help, etcetera, yes, but you have to do it yourself.\nDon't expect nobody to give it to you. And always remember to be responsible for\nyour own actions. That's your responsibility, don't blame nobody else for your\nproblems. You cook your own dinner, you make your own life. You go to sleep the\nway you make your bed. That's what I've always taught him, that's so true. | still\nbelieve today, that's what | tried to instill in my children, the same type of a thing.\nAnd | have no regrets. | think | ama very fortunate man. | ama very happy man. |\nlove life. | like my people, an extrovert. | have countless number of friends, all over\nthe world, and | mean literally. Literally, from all over. Australia, South America,\nyou name it, Canada, Europe, all over Europe, Sweden, Italy, Spain. All over\nEngland, we have friends all over Paris, we're going to Paris right now to visit of a\nyoung widow, our personal friends. | mean, it's just like a sister to me. So we\ncreate our own families. That's sort of like a spontaneous, physiological type of a\nreflex. You don't have a family, you make your own family. Many of the kids of our\nfriends call me Uncle Felix. Some call me Papa. Some grandchildren. And | love\nit. That's, my kids call my friends the same way because that's how they grew up\nhere, because there was nobody else. We create our own family. Not by law, by\nour physiological needs. And that can replace, it didn't replace really, but at least it\ndid done something to replace our lost ones, you know? So many of my friends,\nFelix Horn 84\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 84\nAmerican born, don't understand it. They ask me, my colleague , he ask\nme, Felix, tell me, I'm American born, three or four generation. Where did | go\nwrong? | have four sons and nothing but grief. | try to do my best and | think I'm a\ngood parent. My wife is a good mother, and so on. They didn't have to worry about\nnothing, and so on. And nothing but grief. Breaking the law, among other things,\nyou know, | won't go into detail, but tell me one thing? What is it? Where did | go\nwrong? What is it? You came here with nothing, with nobody, no language, no\nfamily, no money, nobody. Look at you're kids, University graduates. And, in the\nmeantime there are a few other doctors, other Jewish doctors, also came from\nIsrael and refugees and so on, look at this. They are all, the kids are educated, they\nare not wealthy people at all. But, what is it? What do you have that we don't\nhave? | don't know what to tell them. | thought fora moment maybe that's why the\nanti-Semitism in some countries is, because of that. In Germany, the professional\nis, the Jewish professionals is the lawyers, the bankers, the doctors and so on.\nMusicians, poets, literary. | mean, people just, was it jealousy? Was it\ncompetitiveness? What is it? | don't know. But it appears to be a certain type of a\ndislike to that person. And that because they are different, different because of\nreligion, they're Jews. That's probably contributed to the rise of anti-Semitism, out\nof other factors of course, the economies and so on. And historically, of course, you\nFelix Horn 85\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 85\nknow, what else is new? This goes back into time of Jesus, so | told him | don't\nknow what to tell you. Maybe |, of course, maybe its from generation to generation.\n| instill my children what | was taught by my parents. | don't know where you fail?\nMaybe if I've got the whole life story in front of me in front of you, or you're parents\nyet, when you grow up, maybe there was something missing there. | don't know. |\nam not a psychologist and | don't understand it myself. I'm asimple person. |ama\nprofessional man, in my line of business, | know what I'm doing, and so on. But this\nis beyond my way of thinking. | cannot explain it, I'm not a psychologist. But there's\nsomething there, maybe genetically, | don't know. Now we're coming back\neveryday reading about those genes here and there so who knows? Maybe they\ncome to it and drug addicts have some defective gene too, | don't Know. Coming\nback now to many Alzheimer's, is not something that you did yourself but its part of\nour physiology, something breaks down and . But as long as\nit lasts my life is beautiful. | am very happy. | do my little part, what | can. | do go\nplaces, Universities, | talk. This summer, | spent most of the summer at Aurora\nUniversity out of Chicago talking to young students about my life story. | am not an\nexpert on Holocaust but | am a victim of the Holocaust and | have the right to tell my\nstory if | want to, if someone wants to listen to it. | won't force myself on nobody. |\nwas invited by the History Department. | have faced up to a hostile audience,\nFelix Horn 86\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 86\nAfrican-American, most of them. Maybe 60 or 70 percent, the rest were white. 19,\n21, 22 years old. Who told me why should, one of the young ladies, African-\nAmerican lady, that upset me, why should | believe your story? Because you say\nso? | said, no. First of all, no one forced me to come here and | didn't force you to\ncome here either. You do believe me or you don't believe me. | cannot convince\nyou of it. You don't even have a number, she said. | said, see it proves how little\nyou know about the Second World War. How much you know about the Holocaust.\nThat's why I'm here, to maybe enlighten you a little bit. | was never in concentration\ncamp to be there long enough to have a number. | was only one night, one\nconcentration camp. They took me to work. | escape right away, like a rabbit. |\nhad no number on it. Well, maybe you're lying. | said, well the only thing you can\ntake is my word for it. If you ask my family tree is very short. Because | am the only\none alive, the oldest one is me. Next is my wife and my children. | don't know\ngrandparents. My wife has no grandparents. No sisters, no brothers. Maybe you\nnever had it. Well, are you going to deny everything? You denied it at the\n. | said, if | will tell you, wait a minute | said, if | would tell you\nthat slavery never existed. Now wait a minute. Did you live at that time when\nslavery was there? You are only 19 or 20 years old. So you didn't live in those\ndays, did you? So you expect me to take you're word for it? Well, it's in all the\nFelix Horn 87\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 87\nbooks. | said, so is the Holocaust. We have pictures of the General Eisenhower's\narmy, from the concentration camps, the corpses lined up, piled up and so on. You\nthink this is... Well that's something you say that's a Jewish publication. | said,\nyou believe that Jews manufactured all those things? You think they would have to\ndo it? See? You are skeptical? | am skeptical too. There was never a slavery.\nOh, no way. Sure there was. | said, so was Holocaust. Take it or leave it. But if\nyou listen to Farrakhan all the time, you find out that you're brains is going to\nbrainwashed. But if you listen to people like me, not only to me, other people like\nme, we don't know each other even. | would tell a similar story. Different in certain\nways because each one survived in different ways, different location, different\nnationality and so on. But it is true. If you don't want to accept it, | am not here to\npenalize you, convince you that it\u2019s the truth. If tell me , itis\nthe truth. This was it.",
        "A: Aurora University, last summer.",
        "A: Yeah. As a matter of fact, they asked me if | come this summer again but | got\nmore work to do now so | have less time, but her name is, the teacher or the\nprofessor's name is Palmer. She talked to me. What happened is there was an\nFelix Horn 88\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 88\nexhibit of a Warsaw ghetto exhibit at University of Aurora. | was commissioned by\none of the sculptors, which is Cop-sure-a-etchie (ph), a woman from Evison (ph),\nAmerican-born, who is doing the exhibit on Warsaw ghetto. Well the debris and\nbreaks and the barb wire and so on. And she wanted someone to tell the story of\nthe background of it, the train, the sound of the trains and the cars taking people,\nthe cattle cars taking them to concentration camps. And if you heard about the Rig-\nla-baum (ph), a diary in Warsaw? He was an activist who was writing day by day\noccurrences in Warsaw ghetto. And he finally buried all his manuscripts in milk\ncans, three milk cans. Two of them were recovered, one is missing. And she\nwanted me to read from his archive, this story from day to day, what transpired at\nWarsaw ghetto. So | ask her, why me? You can have any of the theatre people,\nyou know, actors with their diction and so on to do this. An exceptional job. She\nsaid, no. | want the authentic thing, you were there. And | was in Warsaw ghetto.\nYou were there. You were a witness of it. | want you're accent because its\nauthentic. | don't want a good voice. So she wanted this. So | went there. So |\ntaped this thing and | had to see it and listen to my own voice then. It was really\nimpressive, | say that the whole exhibit. And the history class was coming to visit\nand this Miss Palmer met me there and we talked about it. Signed your name, and\nso on. And it says, the title of it, the exhibit, and then voice by Felix Horn, survivor of\nFelix Horn 89\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 89\nWarsaw ghetto.

        "A: There were other discussions with other people and very little input from the\nBlack students. More input from the white students. There was input from a white\nman who was standing by, joined the whole thing, nothing to do with the school,\nnothing to do with me, | never met him before. Turned out that he was a Polish, not\nJewish, victim of Holocaust. He was released from one of the, liberated from one of\nthe concentration camps as a Polish laborer. He lost his whole family. His father\nwas Official, some official in Polish government, first one to go. The Germans first\ntook the dangerous people, who are people with Army, officers, you know?\nLawyers and so on. Intelligencia (ph), you Know? And he was there and listening to\nthis whole discussion and he raised his hand. | didn't Know who the guy was. |\nfound out later about his background. And he said, | listen to the whole story. |\ndon't know this gentleman, pointing at me, but my name is so-and-so and | live now\nin Aurora. | live only few blocks away from the University. He introduced him, who\nFelix Horn 90\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 90\nhe was. He was a retired man, he worked at one of the factories there, a factory\nman. And he had a number on the arm and he is missing some of the toes. He\nwas beaten in the concentration camp by the Germans, he was not working enough\nand so on. He was beaten and he lost his shoes, well not shoes, they were woolen\ntype of a thing, with a pipe. They smashed his toes and then given no medical\ntreatment. They became gangrenous and fell off completely. And then the inmates\ntreated him a little bit, secretly and so on, he saved the foot actually. But he said, |\ndon't know the man from Adam, but you don't have to believe me either. Just\nbecause | have a number doesn't mean nothing. My father didn't have a number.\nHe's dead. By the Germans, by the Nazis. My brother didn't have a number, he\nwas shot by the Nazis. You will see his corpse, you say well he died natural death?\nOr somebody robbed him maybe? Well, that's not true. But no one is going to\nforce you to believe it. If you don't want to believe it you never will believe it. But\nthe day will come, you'll find out, it is the truth. Just like Dr. Horn said about the\nslavery. We all know it was true. There was slavery, of course there was. But see,\namazing that you who didn't live in the days of slavery insist there was slavery. And\nhere you're confronting a person who lived through the Holocaust, my\ncontemporary, right? He don't believe me, that | am there. And this was a dilemma.\nAnd | don't know how much | convince . . .

        "A: Right. Correct. | was here.",
        "A: | didn't face up to it. We didn't Know nothing about it until later. As a matter of\nfact, the leader of this Nazi was a Jew. You know about that I'm sure?\nFelix Horn 92\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 92",
        "A: Part Jewish, right. His father was Jewish, not his mother. According to the\nJewish laws, if the mother is not Jewish you're not Jewish. But there was a\npassport of his father, passport, he went to Israel then, it was in Hebrew. | mean, it\nwas Palestine at that time, it was a Hebrew in English. And\nhis faith was Jewish. So his father was Jewish. He was very antagonistic, that\nleader of the Nazi, when people found out his father was Jewish.\n30-some years after the war. You've made this whole life. You had these horrible\nearly experiences. Here you are in a suburb of Chicago and you have these people\nparading around in Nazi uniforms and whatever. I'm just curious what that must\nhave stirred up, even if just the memories?",
        "A: Yes, no question about it. At first, | couldn't understand it. | was aware of it. In\nCanada there is an anti-hate law. | couldn't understand why we don't have that kind\nof a law in this country. That freedom of speech, that's fine. That's a beautiful thing.\nBut there has to be a limit to freedom of speech. If you have freedom of speech,\nwell, it can lead to hate, lead to crime. Like burning the churches right now, the\nblack churches. | don't want that freedom of speech if people can face up to me\nand hate me and talk to me in derogatory remarks and so on and being the same\nthing, what | remember now as younger. | feel, that's the country | came for? To\nFelix Horn 93\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 93\nme this is, until today this is very hard to swallow. | understand it but it's hard to\nswallow. Because Canada, it matters too, they do have an anti-crime, anti-hate law.\nEven Germany, the birth of National Socialism, has anti-crime. We have, this guy |\nforgot his name, it starts with \"L\", American, printing the Neo-Nazi literature, here.\nHe can do it freely without any punishment. Bring it to Germany, he is arrested over\nthere for breaking the law.\nOther: Hello?",
        "A: And to me this is beyond understanding. Until today, | am not in total agreement\nwith the whole thing. | don't Know what to do about it. But | feel that freedom of\nspeech is very important, yes, but not to the situation. By\nleading to total chaos and . Of course, you have a right to do\nthose things. By the right gives you the right providing you do things that doesn't\nhurt nobody else. You're right to express yourself, yes. Peacefully. Not to kill\nsomeone, not to cause a riot or something like this. Marching, you can peacefully\npass through or convince legislators to pass laws that you believe in and maybe |\ndon't, if you can go through that, that is the way, that's all right, that's fine. But to\nhate, slander and so on, or a Neo-Nazi march, | don't believe that they deserve that\nprivilege. | mean, freedom of speech. | feel that we are reaching, that America\nFelix Horn 94\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 94\nliving today is not the same country that | came to. It's different. And | guess | need\nto get use to it but I'm not talking about the crime now, that things were not present\nat that time, drugs and so on. I'm talking about the political innovations and change\nof climates and so on. And | feel those things, people are misinterpreting the\nConstitution. They use the Constitution for their own personal beliefs and they bend\nthe Constitution they way they want to. They convince our lawmakers of bending it\ntoo. Talking about separation of church and state and so on. But people now try to\nbend it and so on because they live in the country where the Pilgrims and so on\nwhat to escape execution and so on. So they do understand, that's why we have\nthis separation, because where they came from there was no separation, that's why\nthey had to leave the country. They were persecuted. Here in this country we don't\nsupport the working, believe what you want to believe, as long as you don't go and\nkill somebody, don't hurt somebody else. You can believe whatever you want to as\nlong as you do no harm to somebody else. To children particularly. Even if you\nteach or preach certain dogmas, that's hurting the children. | feel that our\nConstitution is abused by a certain group of people. And you will find always those\ngroups of people who find people who fund it and the money talks, you know? Who\nreally have a purpose in the whole thing, quietly and so on. And they undermine our\nDemocracy. I'm worrying about it. | am. | worry about my grandchildren. How safe\nFelix Horn 95\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 95\nare they in this country now? And will they be as safe as | was when | was a kid? |\ndon't know. I'm not sure. Even my daughter, wanting to be a veterinarian, and |\nwas told not in certain terms. If you're not a farmer who donate money to the vet\nschool and if you are not a born American, forget about it. And then they didn't want\nto tell me if you're a Jew, just don't bother. See? But this was the life, true life was\nin those days. But not that our government, our country believed in and promoted it.\nBut the people did. | was amazed with the amount of anti-Semitism in this country.\nAmazed how much. This little village, before my arrival here and right after the\nSecond World War, there were signs on the front lawn, dogs and Jews not\npermitted.",
        "A: When | came here, right. The owner of Lincolnwood (ph) was a German. He\nowned huge farms, multi-millionaire. He died of course. His park is, Prussels, the\npark is named after him. He subdivided, blah, blah, blah and so on. There were no\nJews here before. was the first, where Jews were there, before\nLincolnwood (ph) became. But slowly, use to making in-roads and some of the\ngentlepeople didn't like some Jews so they started selling their houses. So the\nJews were buying it. So like the Jews living in Rogers Park, going to the suburbs,\nyou know? Different minorities comes in. And that's what, | understand, | was not\nFelix Horn 96\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 96\nhere at that time. | never seen that sign but | was told by my colleagues, Jewish\ndoctors, who never could live here. They told me, no one wanted to sell them a\nhouse or a plot to build anything. They were unwelcome. There were a lot of\nchurches, there was never a Synagogue here. Now we have some.",
        "A: Yes, it did. Of course, | imagine | did in a minor way, but | don't remember in\ndetail. But | Know one thing. It came up once when they were older, when we got\nsome invitation to some symposium on children of survivors, something like this.\nThey had to undergo counseling, through psychological evaluations, and so on. |\nnever found that need in my family. | never, not that | am blind to it, | am open to\nany kind of a consultation or if there is need to it. | never felt my kids were deprived\nof any security, love, affection, ect. Just because what we went through? We\nnever, we didn't dwell on this maybe. Maybe in the very early, formative ages of our\nchildren we didn't want to hurt them. And this was a cruel thing and we wanted to\nFelix Horn 97\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 97\nspare them to those things. We felt that maybe in time when they are more mature\nand more responsible and more secure then we can have a dialogue on this thing.\nBut, interesting enough, when they became more mature they were not open to this\nkind of discussion at all. They, my son don't want to talk about it. And | try for many\ntimes to approach him and so on. And he said that | know you're story, | Know\neverything. It hurts me inside. | don't want to talk about it. But he's a very well\nbalanced person. He is not, outward he is not, or psychologically, a handicapped\nperson, emotional or otherwise. He is secure. He is responsible. He is very well\nknown physician and consultant, you know? He has a secure family. He has two\nlovely little girls, daughters. He married a gentile girl who is of German extraction. |\ndon't know how many generations, three or four generations, so, but he made it\nclear. He fell in love with her, she fell in love with him. As much as hurts him, he\nwill never hurt his parents and marry a gentile, German girl unless she converts.\nShe said, look, it's not my fault | was born of German extraction. Which is true. But\nher parents and grandparents and great-grandparents born in this country,\nAmericans. The German is only by the name, name was Griner, which is a German\nname. It could be a Jewish name too. The fact that | am not Jewish is not my fault\neither. But this they are, they are people too. But | am nota religious person. If this\nwill make you happy. And she converted. She is more Jewish than my wife. Friday\nFelix Horn 98\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 98\nshe lights candles. Kids go to synagogue, to temple. We join synagogue because\nof my kids. To same synagogue. They joined but they waited four years to be\naccepted. It cost a lot of money, like an introduction there because there was such\na waiting list. And that synagogue, they want to belong. One day we got a call from\nthe Rabbi, Dr. Horn? Yes? You're son is a member of our congregation now. We\nwould like to meet you. | said, will you want us to be a member? He said, well, we'll\ntalk about that. We want to meet you in person first, want to know you're story. |\nwould like to listen to you first. And we set up a date and we met in his office there,\nin the synagogue. He roughly just got our story and so on. He said he would be\nmore than pleased if we would join the congregation. | said, first thing | cannot\nafford that money that my son paid you. | am retired, | said, and!|...

        "A: Embarrassed that their parents are survivors. They are poor, they were poor, no\nfamilies. Because their friends are rich and American-born and so on. It's a social\nlevel type of a thing. They are like a lower kind of people. But this was not with our\nkids. No, | never, they always stood their ground and as | say, | feel that we are\nvery well leveled families and my kids had no need for it. But someday, | am sure,\nafter | die, |am sure my son is going to keep his promise. He is going to look into it\nin details. The only thing | might say, yeah, but it would be better if you do it now\nwhile | am alive. You can get some questions, you're not going to talk to the tape.\nFelix Horn 100\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 100\nThe tape won't be talking to you. You have to listen to the tape, that's the only thing\nyou get. Information. But with no dialogue. Here, you've got you're father still alive.\nBut he doesn't, he said, Dad, | cannot do it. I'm sorry, | cannot face up to it. He\nwishes he could take away from me the hurt and he cannot do that, no how. How\ncan you do it? Not talking about it? That's what he thinks, by not talking, it is\nminimizing my hurting. | don't dwell on it either. | went back to Poland, | went back\nto my High School. | was the only Jew in a Catholic High School. | play violin in\nchurch choir in Poland. And some Polish people, all the known facts about Poles\nduring the war, what they did against the Jews. | won't repeat it because they were\nthe willing executioners of Hitler. But they saved my life and my wife's life. They got\nme out of Warsaw ghetto, Polish people. Underground, Polish underground. For\nmoney, of course. It turned out to be no money, we buried, you know the story from\nthe tape. We had a buried treasure and it turned out to be someone robbed it.\nAnyway, Polish people help us survive. And they definitely helped me. Totally\nunselfish, with any profit, no profit, nothing. So! am very, | have to be fair to it. And\n| went to Poland, | wanted to see my High School. | was treated beautifully when |\nwas a kid there. | remember when, it was the most beautiful years of my life. My\nparents and my school. And my High School still stands. And | found the book with\nmy picture in it, in the High School. | didn't know their fiftieth reunion, | didn't know\nFelix Horn 101\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 101\nthey know | was surviving and, so | had the guts to go back and | went to the\nconcentration, Majdanek, where my parents perished. | had to go there because\nthey were there, but that's all. There's no trace left of nothing. | went to other\nconcentration camp, Auschwitz, etcetera. We went to the former ghetto area and\nWarsaw where some Jewish people sell remnants, old, a few of them left over yet\nnow. Pitiful sight. And my wife cannot face up to it. She cannot do it. She hates\nthem so much, what they did to the Jews. She doesn't want no part, she doesn't\nwant to listen or speak Polish. She doesn't want to read Polish books.

You know, she is obsessed with it. | am too, but | reflect different on those\nthings. | may be stronger than she is. | can control my emotions. | can go, maybe\nserve my purpose, because it brings back memory and no one can give it to me, |\ncannot buy it. | go there and | grab it. And | made that 3,000 or 4,000 mile trip for\nthat only thing, to sit on old bench | was sitting on as a student. | am an emotional\nperson and | may be, | have compassion for those days. Because those were my\nhappy days. And | am willing to do it again now because probably this will be my\nlast trip. And some of my friends, Jewish friends from the same town wants to go\nwith me because our wives don't want to. But it depends, some people go to a\npsychiatrist, they have medication.

He was in my High School. The only second Jew. And\nin those days, there was nothing but school, education. Where you get it, is it Jesuit\nschool, other school, you get the education. And this was a drive, there was such a\nhealthy competition. The cousins, everybody had to outdo the other one. | played\nviolin, | was painting, so my cousin was doing the same thing. We tried to out do\neach other. It was such a healthy thing. There was nothing else to do in those\ndays. There was no fun like the kids have today and going to different places,\nthings, parks, if you go to park they beat the hell out of you. If you were Jewish and\nwent to the park, the students, University students, beat the Jews in the park. They\nlet the Jews in. Oh, | was beaten up many times. But not by my colleagues.

It\nwas the mother of my classmate from that High School. They saved my life. That's\none episode only. And there are many of them, | didn't describe all of them.\nBecause | cannot do in three hours or four hours of testimony, to give you all the\ndetails.

        "A: It was not a very happy note. | don't need the world to learn anything from the\nSecond World War, from the Holocaust. Learn nothing. And history repeats itself.\nHowever said it before was right. It is going to repeat itself. I'm from, start from old\nages, middle ages, same thing right now. When Eichmann asked Hitler at the\nConference in 1942 in Germany, before the Final Solution, when Hitler\noutlined the plan, what he wanted to do with the Jews, he was agreeable but he\nsaid one question, to Hitler. | think | mentioned that in my testimony too. Do you\nknow anything about the Armenian Holocaust? And Eichmann said, no. See?\nHere you are. There was Armenian Holocaust. Turks annihilating Armenian people\nin 1905, | think. 1905, 1915 yeah. Kids were never taught in school about, they\nFelix Horn 107\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 107\nwere not in Turkey. But in Germany, in Poland, | was never taught that. | just found\nout about it when | heard this thing. You know what? After the Second World War,\nafter Holocaust, fifty years, seventy-five years, people forget about it and they will\nnot like to discuss it no more. And | am reaching that point now, | see that. Letters\nto the editors, | see people saying, we know, Holocaust, Holocaust, Schmol-o-caust,\nenough, enough, enough. How much longer are you going to talk about it? Well, |\nhate to say that, from the lower class of people, not very intelligent people, would\nwrite that kind of a letter to an editor, you know? But they resent, non-Jews dwell\non this kind of thing. And they don't want Jews to dwell on it either. But they don't\nunderstand the pain inflicted by that. How can you forget that? As, who said it?\nViselle (ph)? Forgive? Yes. Forget? Never. True. You might forgive, | never\nforgive. | won't forgive, | won't forgive. But what does it mean, | won't forgive? So |\npay my own choices, | don't want to associate with German people and so on.\nThere are innocent German now, you youngsters today, it's not their fault. They are\nnot, because they are grandchildren of the perpetrators. But to children | might\nforgive, little children.

They knew it belonged to somebody, they knew from whom. By not\nbeing anti-Jews, but they are accepting those things, they are participant in it, they\nwere quiet about it, they were peaceful. So, it is so true. | agree. | read the book.\nVery difficult book for me to read. Difficult because it's the professor from Harvard\nwho is the writer, a highly intelligent man and psychologist. And | had to read it like\na science book, not a novel. It's hard to digest it you know? But it's so true. So |\nbelieve today the people didn't learn nothing. It is repeating itself right now, this\nmoment. And it's going to repeat itself again. One stops, another country starts\nmurdering their own people. Is it Rwanda? Is it Bosnia? Is it in Libya? Or is it in\nSouth Arabia now? | mean, wherever you turn around you will find the same thing.\nKnow it's going to happen again. And that's rather depressing fact that | have to\nlearn to live with it. The only, maybe positive out of it is that my life is going to end\nsoon and | probably won't be witness to another Holocaust maybe. But | worry\nabout my children and my grandchildren. That's what | worry about, yes. | am\nrather pessimistic. | am an extrovert, | am. And basically | am a person with hope\nand so on, and in this respect | am rather pessimistic.
