NESSE GODIN\nPage l\nNesse Godin interview, 2/13/95\nSWB: Nesse, I think that a good place to start would be at\nthe point in the death march when you ended up in the barn,\nso if you could just take me into that part.\nNESSE GODIN: As I mentioned to you before, after the death\nmarch, we were round up in a place with the name of Zhinof.\nWe pushed in into a barn, I do not know how many of us were\nleft dead on the road. We may have been about 600 when we\narrived there. But for the three weeks that we were there,\nthere were more dead bodies in the hold that they dug than\npeople in the barn. I tell you, it was just a terrible\nterrible sight. Uh, it came a point at that time when I\nreally prayed to be one of the dead. But that real was\ndifferent. March 10, 1945, we were liberated by the Russian\narmy. Actually, the people were taking, the Russians were\ntaking over that area, and they found us there.\nSWB: Describe to me some of the things that happened in\nthat barn, before they came.\nNESSE GODIN: Before we were liberated, or that particular\nday?\nSWB: Before you were liberated leading up to that",
        "particular day.\nNESSE GODIN: When we came in actually to the barn, they,\nthe Nazis ordered 50 women out, they gave them shovels, they\ntold them to dig two giant holes. We thought that we were\nbeing lined up and shot, as in previous, that's what\nhappened. But the Nazis had different plans for us. One\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 Int. NESSE GODIN\nPage 2\nhole served as a bathroom, they put some sticks on. And the\nother hole served as a grave. Every morning, the dead were\nordered to be taken out, they were had to be under as naked,\nbecause the clothing could be recycled, but the people were\ndumped into the hole. Food was given to us very Jlittle.\nYou see the Germans did not get at that point allocation\nfood for us for the prisoners. It was up to the village to\nsupply some food for us. People just died from hunger,\ntyphoid, dysentery. I tell you, the mountain of bodies\noutside were dead, but the people inside looked dead also.\nIf we were just living zombies, skeletons covered with skin.\nAnd that particular day, before the Russians found us, in\nthe morning, when um, the men that were in charge to take",
        "out the dead, took the bodies out, came back into the barn\nand said to us, no guards. Some of the women said, let's\nrun to the village. Now you know we couldn't even walk, we\nwere so sick. Somebody else says, there is SS men hiding\nbehind the barn. The minute we start to walk, they're going\nto shoot us. But we didn't know that we were, that there\nwere no more guards, they ran away. All day long we sat in\nthat barn not knowing that our guards are run = away. At\nnight we heard the sound of boots. Now you know for us\nSurvivors, the sound of boots we shiver. And then we heard\nthe Russian language, and there was the Russian army and the\nsoldiers were telling us that they took over the area. They\ncan not stay with us, but in the next day or so, their\nbackup units will come, the medics and they will help us.\nNow that night, I tell you, I cried. I remember I cried.\nAnd you know, 50 years almost, from March 10 till now, and I\nstill don't know why I cried. Did I cry because I felt\nsorry for me? Did I cry for my family that was so brutally\nkilled? You know it was just something that people said,\nyou must have been very happy when you were liberated. But\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 Int. NESSE GODIN\nPage 3",
        "I remember that sadness in my heart not knowing, not having\na home where to go to, not having a family.\nSWB: So that night they did basically nothing for you\nexcept tell you you were free.\nNESSE GODIN: Uh, well, uh, some soldiers gave us a bite of\nbread and they said to us we are afraid to give you food, if\nwe give you too much, you may get very sick. So, don't run\nto the village, don't eat too much, we are going to come\nwith the medics and tell you exactly. Now many people right\nafter liberation died because they ate a whole slice of\nbread. Our stomachs were so shrunken. We couldn't digest\nany more, too much food. So they really, that's all they\ndid that night.\nSWB: Did you talk with the other girls, or you just cried\nor... do you remember what other people did.\nNESSE GODIN: There were different different reactions.\nSome people jumped for joy, some people applauded, I heard\napplause to the Russians. The people that knew how to speak\nRussian had a little conversation trying to find out if\nother places were liberated. Don't forget, I was from\nthirteen to seventeen, from the age of thirteen to seventeen\nghetto, concentration camp, labor camp, death march. I\nwasn't really educated enough to understand what was\nhappening.",
        "SWB: Now describe to me your physical condition. What did\nyou look like?\nNESSE GODIN: I tell you what I looked like. I weighed at\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 Int. NESSE GODIN\nPage 4\nliberation sixty-nine pounds. I'm not a very short lady. I\ndon't know how tall I was at that time, how much I = grew\nduring the war, when uh, I am five four and a half now. Can\nyou imagine sixty-nine pounds? My face was swollen because\nI was beaten up severely on the death march. My hands\u2019 had\nfrostbite, my toes were black from frost, I had one dress, a\nblanket that was wrapped around my _ body. Between the\nblanket and the dress, my ba- body was wrapped around with\nstraw. Somehow we found straw on the ground and we tried to\ninsulate ourselves with it. Uh, let me tell you how I saw\nmyself a few days after liberation. I have not seen myself\nin a mirror for almost two years. A few days after we were\nfree, the Russians carried us, bodily actually to the\nvillage, put us in little houses, until the makeshift\nhospital was made. And as I was laying in one of those\nhouses on a straw sack, I saw a door with a window pane.",
        "And I thought I'm free, let me look outside, how the free\nworld looks. But as I looked through that little window\npane, I saw a reflection. A reflection of the most horrible\nthat anyone can imagine. A skeleton covered with skin, with\nbig blue eyes. And as I turned to look whose reflection I\nsaw, I realized that was my reflection. This is how I\nlooked.\nSWB: Where did you think that you would go in those first\nfew days.\nNESSE GODIN: A few days later, I was taken to that\nmakeshift hospital that was set up in the little village of\nCrenof. I was there with typhoid, dysentery, uh, treatment\nfor my uh toes, my scar on my face, my wound at that time.\nI was there for six weeks. I was there the longest. Then,\nthe people that were in charge of that hospital called me in\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 Int. NESSE GODIN\nPage 5\nthat little room that they called an office, and they said\nto me, now you can leave. And I looked at them and I said,\nwhere do I go? I don't have anyone to call. I don't have a",
        "home, I don't have a country, I don't have a family. So the\nperson at the desk looked at the women in back of me and\nthey asked her, where are you from. She said from\nLithuania. So I- they assigned me to be her ward, because I\nwas seventeen, I was underage, I became this woman's\u2019 ward.\nStranger, I never met her before. She was very kind. And\nthat's how we started out on a journey, supposedly to go\nback to Lithuania. You could not buy a ticket and travel\nwherever you wanted. You have to go where the trains were\ngoing to. Trains are traveling east and west, Russian\narmies were uh traveling, they were uh, uh taking all kinds\nof machinery from Germany towards Russia. And we had those\nfreight trains.\nSWB: Wait, we have to put another roll on.\n[CAMERA RELOAD]\n[CR#2 ]\nSWB: Okay, let's back up and tell me how the trains were\ngoing and how you...\nNESSE GODIN: Okay so I wound up with this lady that, whose\nward I was. And we had to hop different trains because\nthere was no way that you could buy a ticket or go directly\nto anywhere we planning to go. Trains were going east and\nwest and north, and those were trains that the Russian\narmies were moving from one side to the other. Also freight",

NESSE GODIN\nPage 6\nwe hopped those trains, we were, they allowed us to do_ so,\nand we ran from one place to another. We wound up in the\ncity of Loge, Poland. By that time it was May already. I\nremember well because I was still on one of those trains\nwhen the war stopped. So I know it was May. When we\narrived in the small uh area in that area of Loge, that\nshelter that they had, there were already help set up. You\nknow we human beings are really wonderful people. There was\nthe Red Cross, Christian relief, the highest helping, uh,\ngiving us a little food, telling us where we can go uh for\nto sleep over. In that large room, I remember there were\nbig posters around, where you were supposed to sign in and\nlet people know where you're from in case somebody from your\nfamily comes to the place, they should know if you're there.\nSWB: What did you find.\nNESSE GODIN: Okay. One day, I, as I looked at that poster\nand it said Lithuania, I signed my name somewhere on the",
        "bottom of that poster. All night I was wondering, I. said\nwho iS going to bend down and read it on the bottom of the\nposter. Now you can see I was seventeen but not too wise.\nSo the next morning I was very anxious to get back to that\nshelter and to sign my name up high so where people could\nsee it on eye level. And I was writing my name, Nesse\nGalbring, that was my maiden name. A lady was standing next\nto me and asked me, she said which Galbring are you from\nChelay, I don't remember you. You see we had a Galbring, a\nShoemaker, a d- uh a Tailor and my parents had a dairy\nstore. They sold butter and milk. And I told her I= said\nI'm Galbring from the dairy business. Oh, she said, Nesse,\nthat's you, you look so bad. And when I looked at that\nwomen I recognized her. She was a strong lady before the\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 Int.

My mom_ was\nseparated from me in the concentration camp. She said, yes,\nthey took a little bit stronger women to another camp and\nshe's right now ina little shelter in this-and-this\u2019 small",
        "village near the border of Poland and Germany. When I heard\nthat, I couldn't believe the women because she wasn't\nmentally stable. But still I thought maybe it is true. So,\nI go to my lady whose ward I am, I said, he- her name was\nHanna, I said Hanna, we have to go back, back to the German\nborder. She said, your crazy child, who goes\u2019. back,\neverybody goes forward. I said but, somebody told me that\nmy mom is alive and she is there in that village. She said,\nIT am not going with you. She took out the piece of paper\nthat she's in charge of me, she tore it to pieces, she said,\nnow go to the desk, tell them you're eighteen years. old,\nthey'll give you another document, and if you want to go,\ngo. So, everybody's traveling east and traveling west.\nArrived in that little village, I found the shelter, I\nwalked in, and there were ladies from my home town that I\nrecognized, and after they asked me who I was because they\ncould not recognize me, they said, oh Nesse, your mom heard\nthat you were alive and you were in Loge, she went to\u2019 look\nfor you. Can you imagine, she went one way, I came _ the\nother. Took me about two or three weeks, I really don't\nremember, to get back in Loge, where I was reunited with my\nmom.\nSWB: Tell me about the moments of getting reunited.\nNESSE GODIN: I tell you exactly how it was because I'll\nnever ever forget that.

There were\nwomen that came and actually bodily showed you where the\nShelter was. And there was a red-headed woman from my\nhometown, standing there at the train, and when she saw me\nshe said, Nesse, I'm gonna take you to your mother. I said,\nhow do you know me? She said yes, we heard that you were\nhere and you went to look for her and we thought y-she\nwould-you would come back. She took me up two flights or\nthree flights of stairs, I don't remember anymore. Here, I\ncould hardly move my feet because they were frozen. I don't\nknow how I walked up those stairs. She knocked on the door,\nshe said Mrs. Galbring, I brought you your daughter. And\nthe woman left. And what I remember, the door opening up,\nand there was no lights, I don't know why, maybe it was\nstill, uh bombed there, it was a candle burning, and there\nwas my mother. She looked frail, but she looked the same.\nShe, from the age of 45 to 46, she didn't change really.\nBut she did not recognize me. My head was still shaved, my\nface was still swollen, wrapped around with rags, and at\nthat point I still had very terrible clothes. on. Some\nRussian soldier gave me an old coat. I had a pair of men's",
        "shoes on and I just remember her saying okay, take off your\ncoat. And here is my mother, I was so anxious to hug her,\nand after I took off all that junk from me, she said I did\nnot recognize you my child. And needless to say, we were\nvery lucky. So few found mothers and found children, I was\nreally very lucky.\nSWB: Now I want to go back and ask you specific things\nabout getting liberated and getting disinfected, did they\ngive you a toothbrush, tell me about things like that.\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 Int.

Um, you know we are\ngrateful to every soldier that came in, whether it was\nFrench or English or Russian or a wonderful American\nsoldiers that came in and talked to us like human _ beings.\nBut really did anybody send armies to liberate us? They\nfound us there. Whether it was in the American zone or the\nFrench, they found us in those camps. Now in my particular,\nas I told you, the first units went through, they really",
        "gave us crumbs of bread I remember just and saying, ah _ we\ndon't have ourselves, and we don't want to give you too much\nso you don't get sick. Now as I told you before, the next\nday, the few that were a little bit healthier had walked to\nthe village. I really cannot, don't know whether it was a\nmile or a mile and a half. It was not, it, we could see the\nvillage, it was within walking distance. I personally could\nnot walk. A Russian soldier carried me on his arms and\nbrought me to that little house. After being in that little\nhouse for two days, where we were given a little bit of\nfood, they stopped in every house and gave a little bit of\nsoup a few times a day. Then that makeshift hospital was\ncreated. I remember they brought me in to the hospital. I\nremember them shaving my hair, all over my body. I remember\na burning sensation of DDT or some other kind of\ndisinfectant. And then I didn't remember anything else for\nthree days. I was unconscious. When I woke up, I remember\nthe Russian doctor asking me my name, my age, where I'm\nfrom, and holding my hands, and giving me hope that I'm\nfree, that I'll be okay, that they'll take care of me.

Did you run into a\nteacher from your hometown right after liberation.\nNESSE GODIN: Yes I did.\nSWB: Tell me about that.\nNESSE GODIN: In the barn, in the barn, there was, very\nclose to me there was a woman that I thought looked very\nfamiliar. And after talking to her, I realized that she was\none of my teachers, cause we didn't recognize each other.\nSo, somehow, we got a little bit closer, because that was\nthe only person that I could relate to that I felt like it\nwas my family. So when the Russian soldier carried me, she\nsaid to him, please, I, don't separate us, that's all we\nhave each other. So he brought her in that same house that\nI was, she was put on the same straw sack, you know, not the\nmattress, we didn't have mattresses, it was like a sack of\nStraw.

[laughs] There was\nno hunger strike for anybody, but there was a hunger strike\nfor me. Uh, after I was getting better really, and one day\nI thought, I don't have anybody. My last friend is\u2019 dead,\nthat teacher. Now what do I need to live for. It's really\nno use for me to continue. So I thought if I would continue\nnot to eat, maybe I would die and be with all my dear people\nthat are not here no more. But somebody in the next bed\ntold on me, and then they started to watch me and make sure",
        "that I'm eating. I see you learned quite a bit about me.\nSWB: Okay, now, tell me how you and your mother came to go\nto Feldafing.\nNESSE GODIN: Uh, how did we come to go to Feldafing. We\ndecided that there was no purpose for us to go back to\nLithuania. Lithuania was a already Communist country, so we\nhung around in the city of Loge, thinking in case somebody\nelse of the family will survive or somebody that we know,\npeople started about talking about Palestine or that time\nhow it was called it was not Israel yet. And by the later\npart of May or beginning of June, men started to come that\nwere liberated in Dachau. And uh I remember a young\u2019 man\ncoming with a whole list, saying that they send out, w- I\ndon't know how many, half a dozen, uh, men to go and see if\nany of the families are alive, they should try to reunite\nsomehow. On that list was my brother's name, Hreskel\nGalpering, who was liberated in Dachau. He sent word that\nin case any of the family is there, that young men will meet\nany of the family, they should tell them that we should try\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 Int. NESSE GODIN\nPage 12",
        "to get to the American zone. Now before I continue let me\ntell you. When we were brought to the concentration camp\nthe last words that we were sent to each other, was in case\nwe survived that hell, our meeting point should be back home\nin Lithuania. So each of us had that idea in case somebody\nelse comes back we should go to Lithuania. But that's why\nmy brother also remembered it and made sure that in case\nsomeone of the family is alive, we should try to go. Now in\ntha- if you look through history at that time, you will see\nit really was not too difficult to go over border, walk\nacross the border, especially for survivors. We, they could\ntell we are survivors. Somehow a group of people we, uh,\nsomebody said that the best way to get over to the American\nzone would be through Berlin. Because in Berlin, they had\nthe Russian zone, the French zone, the English zone, the\nAmerican zone. Now uh I remembered riding on a truck and\nwalking by foot. We wound up in one of the zones, I think,\nI don't really remember anymore whether it was the English\nzone or the French zone, and we just walked over to the\nAmerican zone. And there we registered and um, if you had\nfamily, they helped you to get reunited. And when we told\nthem that we heard that my brother is in Feldafing, ah, they\nactually brought us there. So, we wound up in _ uh, uh,\nOctober of 1945, we arrived in Feldafing. Took a long time\nfor us to get there. You can see from sometime in June till\nOctober. So it wasn't a easy thing, you know, you went from\none place to another, you had to wait for documents, for\npapers, for.. In the time from June till October, I met my",
        "husband-to-be. And he joined us and before we actually\narrived in Feldafing, Jack and I were married.\nSWB: In 1945. So tell me a little about that.\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 Int. NESSE GODIN\nPage 13\nNESSE GODIN: Well this is always, especially children in\nthe school when I talk to them about my experiences, they\nask me how did you meet your husband. And I always tell\nthem sincerely, in those days, you needed each other. My\nhusband is a survivor of the holocaust. He doesn't even\nhave a distant cousin. Um, there was a long story behind it\nhow I met him. He was a friend of a friend of my, one of my\nuncles by marriage on my father's side. And when we\u2019 found\nthese people in the city of Loge, I mean we, my mom, and I\nfound this uncle and his friend, we became a little bit like\na family unit. And that's who we traveled with from Loge to\nthe American zone. Um, at one point, I remember in Loge, my\nmother saying to me, uh, Nessele, that's an endearing word\nfor your name Nesse, Nessele, you know we are two women\nalone. I think it would be a good idea if one of us\u2019 would",
        "get married. Now my mom was 46 years old, and I thought in\nmy heart, why would she want to get married? She has me. I\nwas angry. But the next thing out of my mother's mouth was,\nmy child, I had a wonderful husband, I don't think I will\nmarry again, but I think you should marry, look here is a\nfew guys, they are all very nice. Choose one and get\nmarried, we'll have a man that will help us and take care of\nus. So honestly, I just looked at Jack and I thought he was\ncute, and I, many times I ask him, I say Jack, who proposed,\nhow did we decide to get married. Um, I don't remember\nkissing him before we got married. I don't remember us\nbeing in love before we got married. We needed each other.\nBut let me tell you, we are married a long time.

What I remember of Feldafing. When I\ncame to Feldafing I was curious, it looked a beautiful place",
        "with villas, with a golf course, with tennis courts, with\nsome barracks down the town, and I was told at that time\nthat this was a resort place for SS men to come and enjoy\nthemselves and have a good time. It was a small little\ntown, the town itself was maybe ten blocks long. A small\ntown, small European town, very pretty, very nice, and as\nyou went down to the area where we called the DP camp was,\nah you still saw those beautiful villas, you saw the\nbeautiful trees, the beautiful area. But you have to\nunderstand, I- we were not given a villa. In that villa,\nten families had to live.\nSWB: Okay, we've got to reload.\n[CAMERA RELOAD]\n[CR#4]\nNESSE GODIN: ....to be good human beings, what, what if you\ndon't love each other or hate each other or abuse each\nother, what can happen. And many times I don't say those\nthings. But God forbid if I am in the audience, and _ some\nperson that just wants to discredit me or discredit the\nHolocaust, and when I get angry, they hear the worst of the\nworst. And sometime[?] I said I never said that. How come\nall of a sudden I say that. And then I realize that I\nprotect myself by not even saying that.\n[SYNC MARK #4]",

NESSE GODIN\nPage 15\nthe DP camps.\nNESSE GODIN: Yeah. So, what I started to say, those villas\nwere beautiful, but you have to understand if we were\nassigned a place in the villa that meant that ten families\ninstead of one lived in that pretty house. Uh, for\ninstance, my brother was there already with his wife to be,\nor she was his wife already actually maybe. And they had\none room. Now when we came, my mom and my husband and I, we\nwere just given two beds in the kitchen. And the kitchen\nwas used by the rest of the ten families. So it was, yes,\nthe place looked beautiful. But we were still crammed into\nsmall places. We still, ris- had to go down to the main\nkitchen to get the food, cause at the beginning they did not\ngive you, for each family separate ration. You still had to\ngo to the main kitchen with your little coupon to get your\nfood. You also received a coupon for a pair of shoes, let's\nSay. You went to that special place where they assigned you",
        "that you can get a coat, or if you needed a dress, or if you\nneeded something else. So, yes we were free, but we were\nstill in like organized living.\nSWB: What else about the conditions, were there other\nthings that were similar to how your life had been before.\nNESSE GODIN: Well, it- it- every thing 1S in comparison.\nNaturally you, when you start to compare to the\nconcentration camp or the ghetto or the labor camp, this was\nheaven. But if you compare to normal lifestyle, this was\nstill a camp. You still had a curfew, you were not allowed\nto go to the little town after a certain time. That, at the\nbeginning. Later as time went on, I was in Feldafing five\nyears. So later on was different. We alread- some of the\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 Int. NESSE GODIN\nPage 16\npeople had already little jobs in the little town, some\npeople worked within the camp, some people uh went to\nschool, so things changed, but at the beginning it was very\norganized living. We still were told we're not allowed to\ngo uh out, we were not allowed to. And then we didn't have",
        "money to go, let's say if somebody wanted to take a ride to\nMunich. Unless they assigned you a ticket to go for a\ncertain purpose, like if I had to go with my face to the\ndoctor in Munich, I had the ticket to go.
