        "A: The whole situation \u2014 yes, everybody was afraid what \u2014 you know, there was no\nanswer and no question. We couldn\u2019t ask because nobody knew anything. Because\nlike I said, there was no information as far as the Jewish people were in \u2014 ina\nconcentration \u2014 or other than what we heard in Poland, which it was close to us,\nthat there is Germans \u2014 the SS was killing Jewish people. But the Warsaw ghetto\nuprising, we did not her \u2014 we didn\u2019t hear anything.

And as we were going, there were overseers, which we \u2014\nthey called them kapos and they were Jewish people and they said, you see that\nsmoke? Do you smell it? And they said, that\u2019s gas chamber, okay? We didn\u2019t know\nnothing about it, we never even heard there\u2019s such a thing as gas chambers. So he\nsaid, they\u2019re burning bodies. One who died and one who was killed. And as we\nwalked in on the right side into the camp, we looked back and we saw my parents,\nmy father, my mother and sister with the little children, well that was the last time I\ndid see them. And when we got into the camp, the \u2014 well, they call it the living\ncamp. And as \u2014 we stayed there a couple days when a kapo man came over and he\nsaid, when you want to get out of here, 1f somebody asks for volunteers, say yes.\nAnd if they tell you that you want a what \u2014 what \u2014 you know, what trade, carpenter,\nOctober 18, 1993\nbricklayer, whatever they\u2019re \u2014 tell them that you know all of it. You are a carpenter,\nyou\u2019re a bricklayer, you\u2019re everything. If that\u2019s what they ask for it, because they\ndidn\u2019t use you what they asked, they just wanted volunteers. And that\u2019s when we\nwere shipped out, not that, you know, it was a couple weeks later, they shipped us\nout to ow \u2014 to Warsaw ghetto.",

        "A: Oh, it was in the same day.",

        "Q: How come you and your father were not put in the male column?",

        "A: On the floor.",
        "Q: Can you describe?",

I mean, I\u2019m not sure exactly what it is, but I would\nsay, you know, at least between a one month or two months, you know, that\u2019s all.\nThat\u2019s why we are not tattooed, because they said that one who 1s there four or five\nor six months, they tattooed those people. Now my friend who was from my area in\n\u2014 in Czechoslovakia, she stayed there almost eight months. She \u2014 they put her to\nOctober 18, 1993\nwork in the crematorium and she got the numbers and she told me that \u2014 that she\ncannot talk to nobody because she saw her mother and father coming down on a\nramp, dead, and it \u2014 she explained it why I did not have the what you call, the\ntattoo. And after that other people told me why we don\u2019t, but I have the number. I\nnever forget that, it\u2019s 88841. And my brother had 8842.",

And if you\nwalked on the main line, there was the sewer \u2014 not, I wouldn\u2019t say sewer, but water\ndrainage, and \u2014 and we used to drink water. Whether it was clean or dirty or\ninfected, we didn't think about it, nor did we care about it. All we knew because we\nwere thirsty. And then one time, one \u2014 one time we got to a water and we just ran\ninto the water and \u2014 clothes and all and drinking and \u2014 an-and bathing and just name\nit, we did in the water. Then they wa \u2014 some of them wanted to swim away from it,\nand they were killed in the water. We got out of it, and I think that was the last time\nthat we had water that I know of, is when we were at the river. And then we walked\nabout a couple more days. And they said pretty soon we going to go into a\u2014 no, I\nthink \u2014 I think we were about \u2014 I would say about maybe three or 400 mi \u2014\nkilometers we walked. Then they put us on the train. Where it was, I couldn\u2019t tell\nyou.",
        "Q: When you were walking, until they put you on the train, did you come across\nvillages or little towns?",
        "A: No, we did not, we used strictly the roads. There was never villages or towns,\nnever.\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t see any of the local population?",
        "A: None whatsoever, no, none whatsoever.",
        "Q: Who gave you food to eat?",
        "A: Whatever they \u2014 what you call th-the trucks or cars were bringing it out there,\nwhat little it was, because you know, I \u2014 I was told there was 11,800 people that\nwalking.",
        "Q: 11,000 people?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: All of them from the Warsaw \u2014",
        "A: Ghetto. I mean, there was also other buildings, you know, other than ours. And\nth-that\u2019s what they told us. Now, I cou \u2014 I-I only go what people said and \u2014 and we\nwere \u2014 arrived very few of them in \u2014 in what you call, Dachau.",
        "Q: Now, before we get there, how did people react to one another during this\nmarch? Were they helping each other?",
        "A: Yes, myself and my brother was hel-helping a-an older gentleman who so \u2014 who\n\u2014 it just so happened he was a rabbi and we carried him so long, so far. After that he\ncould not even walk and we dragged him a little bit, but he just fell down and you\ncouldn\u2019t bend down and try to help him, cause they would kill you the same way.\nAnd so we walked, and I \u2014 we heard a shot.\nOctober 18, 1993\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: Okay, we were \u2014 we were talking about your marching from \u2014 from Warsaw\ntowards Germany, and I asked you if people were helping each other and jus \u2014",
        "A: Yes, e-e-everybody, you know, who \u2014 who needed some help, they had an arm,\nyou know and \u2014 and try to support him by walking. One who could not, like I said,\nfell down \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 Fell down.",
        "A: \u2014 and you could not do anything, we had to just walk and leave him behind. And\nI heard \u2014 this is just what I said, I heard that only about 11 \u2014 1800 or 2800 survived\nand all the rest of them died on the way. This is what people told us. Now, I\ncouldn\u2019t say whether I counted them, because I didn\u2019t, you couldn\u2019t do that. But I\njust going by them and \u2014 and like the gentleman said, that he \u2014 you know, when he\nwalked into Dachau that the \u2014 the whole street was lined up with dead people on\nthe floor. So I couldn\u2019t tell you that, but he said and then they said that it\u2019s about\n180 people survived. Now I\u2014I-\u2014I couldn\u2019t say that I counted them, but I just go\nwhat people told us.",
        "Q: Yeah, but \u2014 but you\u2019re pretty c-certain there were about 11,000 who were there \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s what they told us, and now that\u2019s \u2014 we \u2014 we had 11,800 people.\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "Q: And how many arrived in Dachau?",
        "A: Well, you see, there was more than one group, but that \u2014 in the group that I came\nin \u2014",
        "Q: In your group.",
        "A: \u2014 there was 18 \u2014 180 people survived.",
        "Q: Out of how many\u201d?",
        "A: Of 11,000.",
        "Q: 11,000, my goodness. How did people feel during that march? I mean \u2014",
        "A: You know, we wasn\u2019t talking to each other, other than what\u2019s going to happen to\nus, and many times you were thinking about just hide in the bushes, maybe some\nPolish farmer, or Polish partisans will come and help. And \u2014 but nobody was daring\nenough to do that because, like I said, some people wanted to do it in the water, and\nthey shot them. So everybody was afraid to do anything, and I wa \u2014 just so\nhappened I was with my brother and I just couldn\u2019t take a chance on anything. We\nfigure we gonna survive one way or the other. And thank God we survived.",
        "Q: So you were hopeful for \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: You said that you walked and then they put you on the train.",
        "A: On the train.\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "Q: For how many days did you walk?",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t tell exactly because you know, that time, the counting wasn\u2019t there,\nbut it was quite a few days, was quite a few days. We slept outside in the cool\nweather, but we slept good because we bundled up among each, you know, instead\nof being just one or two of them, was eight, 10 people got together and \u2014 and\nwarmed each other up.",
        "Q: What was the name of the town from which you took the train? You don\u2019t\nremember.",
        "A: Like I said, we were not even close to the town so we couldn\u2019t even see what it\nwas.",
        "Q: Ma-",
        "A: The on \u2014 the only thing we knew, that we saw some buildings, but where or\nwhat, I couldn\u2019t tell. Nobody, I mean anybody was on that trip, could tell you what\nthe town\u2019s name is.",
        "Q: And so you got on the train, how long was the train ride? This \u2014 this train ride to\nDachau.",
        "A: I would say from \u2014 tha \u2014 to Dachau was a couple of days.",
        "Q: And how was your physical health during that period?\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "A: Mine was good because as a kid I was a hard worker and \u2014 and \u2014 and good\ncondition, because we were working all day and so my physical condition was good\nbecause I was used to hard life at home, like I said, we lived that way. And so I had\nno problem in that respect. Many people are \u2014 were passing out because they had no\n\u2014 also I, as a\u2014 as a young man I was a sportsman. I was a soccer player, I was a\nrunner and so on, so I was in good condition in that respect, and so was my brother.\nBut other people was with us, they were just falling out. Naturally, some were older\nthan we are. We were that \u2014 you know, I was \u2014 that was what, about 20 years old,\nand so I wa \u2014 I \u2014 like I said, in my prime, in that condition.",
        "Q: I meant to ask you when you went from \u2014 from Uzhorod to \u2014 to Auschwitz \u2014",
        "A: Auschwitz.",
        "Q: \u2014 and then from Auschwitz to Poland and now to Dachau, were you the whole\ntime with the same people that left Uzhorod with you?",
        "A: No, not the same people. There was \u2014 you see, in \u2014 in that train was other than\nUzhorod. There was surrounding areas and they brought them also into the camps,\nso let\u2019s \u2014 I would say surrounding area, yes. And that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the people who was\nthere.",
        "Q: And these are the people that eventually you got to Dachau?",
        "A: Yes, mm-hm.\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "Q: Tell us about Dachau.",
        "A: Now, in Dachau \u2014",
        "Q: Tell us when you arrived there, and \u2014",
        "A: When we arrived to Dachau, there was people greeting us and some of them\nsaid welcome to death camp. And I said, what camp? He said, death camp. Well, I\ndidn\u2019t know what he is talking about it til I found out, you see that chimney over\nthere? He said that\u2019s where all the people wind up who stays in here. Well, we\ndidn\u2019t know nothing, they gave us a bed, and they allowed us to go in a bath house.\nWarm, hot water bath. And then they said if e\u2014 you know, we gonna have some\nfood in the kitchen \u2014 which, they gave us food.",
        "Q: Who were the people who greeted you in Dachau?",
        "A: Prisoners.",
        "Q: So the prisoners told you it was a death camp?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Were the prisoners Jewish, or \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: They were mixed?\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "A: He was a\u2014 a\u2014a-\u2014 what you call a preacher I wasn\u2019t sure, a Catholic, or\nwhatever it 1s, but that was a preacher, cause he still had that collar, only the collar\non his neck. Otherwise he had the same striped uniform, you know, and \u2014 and he\ngreeted us and he said I\u2019m not Jewish, he said \u2014 he told us right away that he wasn\u2019t\nJewish. There was many over there 1-1-1n a religious group that were arrested by the\nGerman government.",
        "Q: All right, so tell us some more about Dachau.",
        "A: And then we st \u2014 like I said, we stayed a few days, I\u2019m not so sure how long\nbecause we were so tired, and \u2014 and as \u2014 a \u2014 if they allowed us, we were just laying\nand sleeping. Then one day they called and they said, where anybody wants to\nvolunteer to go work in \u2014 1n the underground factory \u2014 building, a factory. And no\none experienced what the man in \u2014 in Auschwitz said, the first thing you do 1s get\nout a ca\u2014a death camp. And exactly that\u2019s what we did, and we got to a small\ntown, what they call Mildorf(ph). And from Mildorf(ph) we had to walk to the\ncamp, which was in the forest, I would say maybe five, no more than eight\nkilometers from there, and they had the cabins. You know, I \u2014 we call them\nbunkers, cause all 1t was 1-1s \u2014 is a roof over it and concrete, everything else\nconcrete. The place that you sleep and \u2014 and sit, or whatever, or walk, it was\nOctober 18, 1993\nnothing but concrete. And we stayed there a few days you know, til they took us\nworking out the camp.",
        "Q: Outside of Mildorf(ph)?",
        "A: Outside of Mildorf(ph), yeah, that was also outside Mildorf(ph). There was an\nunderground factory they were building, and we were \u2014",
        "Q: And what were they doing there?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know that because it was just in the process of building that \u2014 the\nplace up. And what it is \u2014 was, that people were standing on steel, what you call \u2014",
        "Q: Beams?",
        "A: \u2014 platform, or \u2014 or \u2014 or shape, then we poured concrete. And if you were not\ncareful and you fell in there, the concrete buried you instantly because it was\nflowing, the concrete, continuously. And it \u2014 that\u2019s the place where I got badly hurt,\nwhen a train, a construction train hit me in my chest and ruptured my ribs,\npunctured my lung and almost killed me. But I survived. God, I believed in God,\nand it helped me. And there was one German worker who had a hat on, they called\nhim Toten Kopf, which translation mean dead head. And he helped me with little\nfood there was in the underground, while I was in the camp, in the working camp,\nwhen I was going a\u2014 I\u2014I came out every day to walk back because they counted\nthe people when they came and when they left, make it sure that there 1s everybody\nOctober 18, 1993\nthere. But every morning when we walked there, which was seven days a week and\nsometimes working 12 - 14 - 15 hours a day, that\u2019s including in walking and\neverything else, and I was most of the time in the bunker, underground and 1n the\ndark, cause I couldn\u2019t breathe. Finally, I got better. And \u2014 and also it was a problem\nin the camp because they threw me out from the barrack because I was moaning\nfrom pain all night long and I couldn\u2019t \u2014 they couldn\u2019t sleep and they f \u2014 they felt\nthat they are so tired that they just cannot take my, what you call misery and \u2014 and\nsound, or pain, cause that would have made them more s \u2014 what you call vulnerable\nto their \u2014 to their work and because they were so tired. Even then we didn't have\nsleep. And many people died there too, in the working place, if not on the what you\ncall, on the march. Cause it was, you know, every day marching to work and from\nwork and lunch. Lunch hour was in a section and we knew what time. When the\nhorn sounded, you\u2019re supposed to go to the \u2014 what they call a \u2014 a lun \u2014 a lunch area.\nAnd people used to always slowly work their way in closer \u2014 closer to their lunch,\nbecause if you didn\u2019t, there was just a si\u2014 one hour time you had to feed I don\u2019t\nknow how many hundreds of people. So natural, you were trying to get closer.\nWhen you were closer you ran to it if you were lucky, you know, and they used to\nput in a \u2014a ladle in that soup, and come out with a potato and he puts it back and\nyou get nothing but water. It has one or two potatoes in it and they showed it\nOctober 18, 1993\neverybody else what it 1s, but never got it. But they showed what it was. But\nanything was cooked, what little was in it, and it \u2014 a-and a little bit, it did help. And\nto prove that it did help, I\u2019m here today.",
        "Q: So you essentially helped the Germans build this underground factory.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I want to go back to your accident, when that train hit you.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How did it exactly happen?",
        "A: There was a Russian prisoner who was driving that little train. And then he\nwanted to put it in reverse, because he was in a standing position, he wanted to put\nit in reverse, and we were around there. And it, instead of reverse, it jumped in drive\nand it jumped \u2014 I was so close to it, that the edge of the train hit my rib, and it \u2014",
        "Q: So it was an accident?",
        "A: Oh yeah, that was th \u2014 an accident, 1t was not on purpose [indecipherable] and I\nstill have the thing sticking out over here, even though I had the operation, they\nremoved part of it, not to \u2014 you know, punctured it. But there was a doctor who did\nhelp me, not an official doctor \u2014",
        "Q: At the time? At th \u2014",
        "A: At the camp, you know \u2014\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "Q: At mi \u2014 at Misseldorf(ph).",
        "A: Ye-Yes, and he said, let me do something for you and he put his hand and pulled\nout the rib. I almost died in the pain from that alone. And he said now, the blood\nstarted \u2014 stopped running, as it did before. And like I said, everything, it was just\nworking my way, bu \u2014",
        "Q: Was it a Jewish doctor?",
        "A: Yeah \u2014 oh yes, he was a prisoner.",
        "Q: Also a prisoner.",
        "A: Yes. But like I said, we didn\u2019t have no doctors, not officially. We didn\u2019t even\nvolunte \u2014",
        "Q: [indecipherable] he was a Jewish doctor from \u2014",
        "A: He was a Jewish doctor from our area, yes. And he is the one who pulled it out.\nAnd people said, you know, they pronounced me already dead, and I got up in the\nbroad sunlight and I saw the stars, but I announced that I\u2019m not dead, I\u2019m alive. But\nthe blood was just spilling out of my mouth. And you know, what we saw in movies\nand all that, a-all the time, when the person was shot and the blood was coming out\nthe mouth, that \u2014 the sign was, that\u2019s it. And so did \u2014 I thought so too, and\neverybody else around that way.",
        "Q: But you were taken care of by your friend \u2014 by your fellow prisoners?\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "A: Yes, but this German, he w \u2014 he was a worker over there, he 1s the one who\nreally helped me, he gave me some food every day. Not much, because he didn\u2019t\nhave too much either.",
        "Q: Was he a guard?",
        "A: No, he was a working guy. He was \u2014 looks like a penalized worker, because you\ndidn\u2019t see no civilians, Germans working in that camp. But whatever there was, an\noverseer, or \u2014 or what \u2014 he was not working like we did, but in the same area, so I \u2014\nI couldn\u2019t tell what he was, but I figure he was maybe penalized and put in there\nworking with us, even though supervising. What position, I couldn\u2019t tell because he\nwouldn\u2019t tell me nothing, other than he said he is sorry what they doing to us.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, and \u2014 but he covered for you for the few days that you couldn\u2019t work?",
        "A: He wa \u2014 yes, he took me down in the \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in the bunker every day and he\nsaid, you stay here until I come after you. And he used to come down and got me\nout just before the work was over. So when there was a roll call, I had to lift my\nhand up and said aye, you know, he count so and so, everybody else by name. And\nsometimes they just counted how many people, and they \u2014 each \u2014 each group had\n40 - 50 of them, and you better have 50. One was missing, we stayed there til they\nfind the body or the person.",
        "Q: Sure. And how long were you in Dachau or Misseldorf(ph), or \u2014\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "A: Mildorf(ph)? I was in Mildorf(ph) til the last day when the Americans were\nalready close by and some of the guard were talking to each other, you know, that\nth-the Americans are already in \u2014 1n \u2014 close by in Munich and all that. So we knew\nthat it is coming, so they wanted to take us some death camp, and they told us, get\nready, we going into the \u2014 on that train, you know.",
        "Q: The Germans?",
        "A: The Germans told us, yeah. The SS.",
        "Q: When di \u2014 what time of year was it?",
        "A: That was in \u2014 in April, in \u00b044.",
        "Q: No, no, *45.",
        "A: I mean *45. I me \u2014",
        "Q: April \u00b045, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, \u201945. And then he said, everybody goes to the train. And we walk \u2014 a-and\nwe \u2014 and we were close, and as we were driving, I don\u2019t know how many miles, not\ntoo many miles, but the American planes attacked the train. And they thought\nmaybe an army train, whatever it is, and the SS took off, the guards, and so did we.\nWe opened the train \u2014 one of them was opened, somebody opened ours because\nevery train was opened, and we were scattered in the forest, but it didn\u2019t last too\nlong because after the plane flew out, the SS guard came back and picked us up and\nOctober 18, 1993\nwalked us back. Now, we were afraid that they \u2014 what we heard about in \u2014 in \u2014\nwhen we were in \u2014 still in \u2014 in our home country, that the SS took civilians in the\nforest and they killed them in the forest. And so we figured that\u2019s it. But as we were\nwalking, it was getting darker and we \u2014 my brother, myself and my brother-in-law, I\ntold them we gonna jump into the gutter, which was filled up with water, and we\nswam down about maybe two or three kilometers and we got up and we walked into\na farmhouse. And that\u2019s \u2014 we stayed til the liberation \u2014 the Americans came in \u2014\nwith the farmer\u2019s approval and knowledge, because he caught us a couple days\nearlier, that we ate the food what they were serving to the pigs. And they were\nmaking so much noise, they knew that something is wrong in their pig house,\nbecause they never made that much noise. So he caught us, but did not give us up.\nHe s \u2014 he told us what to do and where to stay, til the SS were coming back and\nlooking in all the farmhouses. And that\u2019s when the American came in.",
        "Q: And how many people were in your group? Just you and your brother and\nbrother-in-law?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, so just the three of you \u2014",
        "A: No, only that \u2014 in that one, or \u2014 there was others, without our knowledge. You\nknow, there was \u2014 well, there was quite a few all around it.\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But were \u2014",
        "Q: But in that little house, that was just you and your brother \u2014",
        "A: And my brother, a-and my brother-in-law.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. How were you treated by the \u2014 the German guards 1n \u2014 in \u2014 when you\nwere in camp in Mildorf(ph)?",
        "A: Oh no, the SS \u2014 the SS were SS in every guard. They did not treat you right. You\ncouldn\u2019t ask question, and for instance, one time I walked to a SS, a what you call a\nguardhouse, and working on the \u2014 on \u2014 on the field, and he was eating pudding.\nAnd he looked at me and he just threw the pudding on the grass. And he didn\u2019t say\nhere take it. He could have \u2014 you know, he could have done that, but that would\nhave been a \u2014 a\u2014 a goodwill gesture. And so I walked over there and I put it in my\nshirt, which was nothing but a cement sack and I walked back to my brother. And\nwe ate the pudding from my sack. And \u2014 and that \u2014 that was something that he \u2014 he\n\u2014 it was out of this world for the simple reason, we never had anything in those \u2014 in\nthat time that I was in a camp that was sweet, and that was sweet. And that was just\na few days before we were liberated.",

Whatever the reason it is, it happens \u2014 it just so happened\nnow in Russia is the same way with the Orthodox Ukrainian, with the Muslims\nover there, or Yugoslavia, the Serb, and the Muslim. So it could and it does happen.\nBut as far how I feel about it, I think the world could have stopped it and I feel that\npartly President Roosevelt was also like against the Jewish people, which I feel it\nwa \u2014 you know, that\u2019s what everybody else feels the same way about it, because he\nsent the ship back and the Germans figured nobody wanted, so might as well kill us.",

My hand was broken\nand my wrist, and my back, like I said, is like a map. So that\u2019s was one thing. The\nsecond, when I\u2019m in a speaking engagement, I feel all if I sleep, I dream sometimes,\nbut I try to get away from it because it \u2014 it brings bad memories. So \u2014 but I have to\ntalk about it for the simple reason I get it \u2014 I get it out of my system and I feel a\nhundred percent better.

So she thought that I have a heart attack, and I said no, I don\u2019t have a\nOctober 18, 1993\nheart attack, I have muscle spasm attack in my leg and in my heart. And when \u2014 I\ncouldn\u2019t breathe, but the leg paralyzed. I had to roll off the bed and roll into the\nkitchen and get the, what you call the circulation back in my legs.

        "Q: Why did \u2014 why did they beat you, for what reason did they beat you?",
        "A: There is no such a thing as a reason for them, for any reason or no reason. They\njust came by and they hit you. Maybe I was in his way, or he just wanted to let me\nknow he is there.",

And my son, who was\nvery much active and supportive of the museum, and my younger daughter, who is\nsometimes my spokesperson, she can tell you my story as good as I am because she\nheard it so many times from me, that if \u2014 one time I missed my appointment at\nhome with the TV crew, she was the one who gave my interview, and they\naccepted. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s how well they know.\nOctober 18, 1993",

That\u2019s the only thing.\nBut applied for it now, when they came out again, the German government said that\nthey have 175 million dollars to give away and so I applied for it, but so far I didn\u2019t\nhear nothing from them.",

Also, I have letters from \u2014 at least\n500 letters from schools, from children, from teachers and all that, that they never\nknew that that\u2019s happen. You know, children don\u2019t \u2014",

        "A: And this is \u2014 the people ask me, do you hate? What \u2014 and I ask one time, what\u2019s\nthat? They said, you know, you hate, you don\u2019t like him. Hate does not exist in our\nsociety as far as the Jewish people is, because we [indecipherable] from history,\nthe only thing we teach is remember. Because if I hate somebody, 1s only hurts me.\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt the other party. He doesn\u2019t know and he doesn\u2019t care. So people were\nso surprised that I don\u2019t hate. No, I have a German girl, works in a \u2014 an office that I\nused to be on the board in there and we became very good friends. And she knows\nthat, that I don\u2019t hate her. A matter of fact, her boss is a German Jew, and \u2014 and he\naccepted her, cause she is a very nice person. She was a young girl, she must have\nbeen about 12 \u2014 13 years old. She could have been responsible, something with her\nfather or \u2014 or grandfather, or uncle, or whatever it is. So you can\u2019t hate everybody.\nAnd like I said, there was many good Germans too.

        "Q: Did you know any\u2019?",
        "A: Yes, I did. And like even \u2014 like I said, after the liberation, and it\u2019s not that they\nwould [indecipherable] they were saying this way, that they were told if they ever\nhelp any Jewish person, or any prisoner, they will be killed with their whole family.\nSo it was threaten, and let\u2019s face it, that goes the same way like was in Russia. Your\nfamily was in jeopardy if you said something against the government, the same way\nin any other country. So I would say there was many that, like I said, in our\nhometown, when we worked with the army, which was army, German army, they\nwere not hateful, they were not bad. They never touched us, never. And they told us\nthat they don\u2019t want to join the SS because they are nothing but murderers.",

        "A: The next day, when we ask the overseer, the kapos, that what they doing with\nour parents, and he said your parents are dead. If they were old, they are dead the\nsame day, some the next day and it got to us to the point that we were lifeless, like \u2014\nlike no feeling.

        "A: Oh, some people, I couldn\u2019t tell who, but they were talking about it, what they\nheard, that people coming from Poland over the border that \u2014 that they\u2019re killing\nthe Jewish people in \u2014 special in \u2014 they were talking about Warsaw.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, they told us to get out. One who could get out, because there was still dead\nbodies in the train. And then they said men and boys on one side, women and\nchildren on the other side. And as we were going, there were overseers, which we \u2014\nthey called them kapos and they were Jewish people and they said, you see that\nsmoke? Do you smell it? And they said, that\u2019s gas chamber, okay? We didn\u2019t know\nnothing about it, we never even heard there\u2019s such a thing as gas chambers. So he\nsaid, they\u2019re burning bodies. One who died and one who was killed. And as we\nwalked in on the right side into the camp, we looked back and we saw my parents,\nmy father, my mother and sister with the little children, well that was the last time I\ndid see them. And when we got into the camp, the \u2014 well, they call it the living\ncamp. And as \u2014 we stayed there a couple days when a kapo man came over and he\nsaid, when you want to get out of here, 1f somebody asks for volunteers, say yes.\nAnd if they tell you that you want a what \u2014 what \u2014 you know, what trade, carpenter,\nOctober 18, 1993\nbricklayer, whatever they\u2019re \u2014 tell them that you know all of it. You are a carpenter,\nyou\u2019re a bricklayer, you\u2019re everything. If that\u2019s what they ask for it, because they\ndidn\u2019t use you what they asked, they just wanted volunteers. And that\u2019s when we\nwere shipped out, not that, you know, it was a couple weeks later, they shipped us\nout to ow \u2014 to Warsaw ghetto.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, not there. No, not there. There \u2014 when we were inside, in the camp, they told\nus to go in a\u2014aroom, and undress completely naked.",
        "A: Oh, it was in the same day.",
        "A: But it was in the camp when they told us to take off the clothes and just put\neverything else in there and come out naked. Then they gave us \u2014 a little bit later\nthey gave us what you call a pair of pants and a jacket. That\u2019s all we had.\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "A: When we separated on \u2014 on the train.",
        "A: When you got \u2014 when we arrived to Auschwitz and got off the train, that\u2019s the\nlast time we see them.",
        "A: Because my father was old and had a beard and you could tell that he was not a\nworking man. He was too old to \u2014 you know, to work. He was in his 60\u2019s.",
        "A: One, and my sister, because she had a little child in her hand. So she was on \u2014 on\n\u2014 on the left hand side.",
        "A: My younger brother.",
        "A: Yeah, Sol.",

        "A: Yeah.\nOctober 18, 1993",

        "A: My sister name what \u2014 whi-which survived, was Mulvina(ph) and Helen.",
        "A: And they were \u2014 they \u2014 they were also \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, they were also on the left hand side because women were separated from\nthe men right then and there. Well, they went into \u2014 further down, and they\nseparated the young ones from the old ones.",
        "A: The \u2014 yeah, there was two lanes, but a little bit further down where the women\nwere, they\u2019re not in the same camp as the men.",
        "A: On the floor.",
        "A: Ho, you see, there was no problem for me for the simple reason, we were a big\nfamily and we only had three rooms, a kitchen, a \u2014 a \u2014 a bedroom, a living room\nand a dining room all in one, so we slept all on the floor. Only my mother, my\nfather and my oldest sister slept in bed.\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "A: That was home, but we slept on the floor, so I was used to it and \u2014 and \u2014 and\nfood, what we ate, sometimes there was none, it didn\u2019t bother, and that\u2019s why we\ncould take the condition, because we were used to it. And let\u2019s say this much, that\nwe were not picayune about what we ate. We ate as long as it was food, edible and\ngood.",
        "A: Now a -\u2014 that I couldn\u2019t tell you because it was a big cabin and there was\nhundreds of them in there. So I couldn\u2019t tell exactly what 1t wa \u2014 how many it was.",
        "A: Now they have \u2014 in \u2014 in there, in Auschwitz, there was not so bad that th-the \u2014\nthe \u2014 a few days that we were over there we gave every \u2014 you know, everyth \u2014 we\nhad sometimes once, sometimes twice a day we had food.",
        "A: No, we didn't stay too long. I mean, I\u2019m not sure exactly what it is, but I would\nsay, you know, at least between a one month or two months, you know, that\u2019s all.\nThat\u2019s why we are not tattooed, because they said that one who 1s there four or five\nor six months, they tattooed those people. Now my friend who was from my area in\n\u2014 in Czechoslovakia, she stayed there almost eight months. She \u2014 they put her to\nOctober 18, 1993\nwork in the crematorium and she got the numbers and she told me that \u2014 that she\ncannot talk to nobody because she saw her mother and father coming down on a\nramp, dead, and it \u2014 she explained it why I did not have the what you call, the\ntattoo. And after that other people told me why we don\u2019t, but I have the number. I\nnever forget that, it\u2019s 88841. And my brother had 8842.",
        "A: No, tha-that tha \u2014 they gave you the number on your shirt.",
        "A: But they didn\u2019t give it to me on my hand, because like I said, I was a very short\ntime there.",
        "A: Yes, then they tattooed.",
        "A: Neither my sisters are \u2014 two sisters have \u2014 are tattooed because they were taken\nin a different section.",
        "A: Oh yes. Not \u2014 no, in Auschwitz we didn\u2019t work, no. In Auschwitz we just\nstayed in a barrack and always called roll call back and forth just to keep you\noccupied. No, only in Warsaw ghetto we were working.\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "A: Not in Auschwitz, we didn\u2019t work, no.",
        "A: Yes, we saw it \u2014 one, and we were inform by the people already there what\u2019s\ngoing on. They said look, the chimney, the black, the smoke, the smell. That\u2019s\nwhere they put the bodies, they\u2019re burning it, because there\u2019s no place to put them.\nThat\u2019s when we knew that that\u2019s a death camp. And that\u2019s all, we couldn\u2019t do\nnothing, so we stayed there on in the barracks, or \u2014 outside we couldn\u2019t roam\naround, only when they called us the roll call, and they called us quite a few times a\nday.",
        "A: Yes, mm-hm.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, just in between one or two months. I\u2019m not exactly\nsure, but we were a very short time over there, cause we wanted to go what \u2014 what\nOctober 18, 1993\nthe kapo said, volunteer to get out. So I couldn\u2019t say that \u2014 no, [indecipherable]\nwould say between one or \u2014 or \u2014 or two months, somewhere around there.",
        "A: No, when they \u2014 when they called out for volunteers and the kapo told me to do\nexactly \u2014 go and say you are a bricklayer or whatever it is. And so my brother did\nthe same thing. I had a brother who was a painter, so he said he was a painter, and\nwe were accepted.",
        "A: And then, in a few days, they put us on a train taking us to Warsaw.",
        "A: No, I couldn\u2019t describe, but I think we made it in \u2014 1-1-in \u2014 in one day.",
        "A: That time they gave us food before we entered that, you know, the boxcars, and\nthen when we got to Warsaw, in be \u2014 1-in between there they stopped and they gave\nus some water and they told us to get out and \u2014 and use a washroom, whatever it is\nand then we had water. That\u2019s all we had.",
        "A: Now on that trip, about 800.\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "A: Only men, only men.",
        "A: Yeah, by then we had the prisoners\u2019 uniform on.",
        "A: Oh yes, that\u2019s what I said, you know, we had to be naked. We got that, but like I\nsaid, you know, we had it on, uniform, the first day we arrived in Auschwitz, they \u2014\nthey changed. They took all \u2014 everything we had, civilian clothes and threw it in\none box. And then they told us to go outside and we stayed there naked til they\ncalled and \u2014 and gave you their uniform, striped uniform.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It was in \u2014 I think it was May or end of May.",
        "A: \u00b044.",
        "A: Oh, we just got with the train and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and from the train they told us \u2014\nwe arrived there, destination and we walked into the camp. And to \u2014 and after the\ncamp they said separate men and go in \u2014 in different barracks and take a place\nOctober 18, 1993\nwhere we gonna sleep. So there was nothing but wooden bunkers, you just took a \u2014\na \u2014 a Space. There was two on the bottom and two on the top and my brother and\nmyself, we took the bottom part and that\u2019s where we stayed til we had to walk to\nGermany.",
        "A: Yes, there first \u2014",
        "A: In the ghetto.",
        "A: Well, they told us while we walked in there and you could see the houses all\ndemolished and we learned that already in Auschwitz that the Warsaw ghetto was\ndestroyed. It was an uprising. So when we walked in there you could tell because\nevery building was destroyed, every one of them.",
        "A: There was no name, that \u2014 that was just the Warsaw ghetto.",
        "A: The only name I know is Warsaw ghetto.\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "A: We were working at tearing down houses and a bricklayer \u2014 and the bricks, we\npile them in the front and they said they were sending it to Germany.",
        "A: Now there they gave us food while we were working. They gave us food. They\ngave us breakfast and lunch and supper, they gave us there.",
        "A: Oh, in the morning we got up about six o\u2019clock and then we had to line up and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and wait for breakfast. Once you were through with it, within an hour we were\nin line to go to the workplace, which was \u2014 it depends what section they took.\nSometimes, you know, about maybe 30 minutes or an hour we \u2014 we got there,\nsometimes two hours, as \u2014 depends the distance we had walk, you know, do the\ncleaning. But I also have \u2014 we had good news. While I was working in the house,\nwe found money.",
        "A: Go \u2014 in a\u2014 a -\u2014 the buildings that was destroyed.\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "A: Not in the ghetto, outside the ghetto, we didn't work in the ghetto. Outside the\nghetto. And we found gold pieces.",
        "A: Yes. It was quite a few thousand gold \u2014 20 dollar gold pieces, but you couldn\u2019t\ntake it in because the guard or \u2014 there were \u2014 law was, when you come in, you keep\nthe shoes and your belt and the clothes you leave it on the ground, and the guard\nwent through with it, feeling what you got in your pocket. So I couldn\u2019t bring\nnothing in til I met a Polish what they call a worker, who was bringing in\n[indecipherable] supplies, whate \u2014 whatever it is, horse and buggy. And we\nstopped him and we ask him can we get a belt, wide and double thickness. And he\nsaid oh yes, he said, but it would cost you a thousand dollars.",
        "A: A thousand dollars, and we had paper money, which we u \u2014 we gave him a\nthousand dollars and I put the 20 dollar gold pieces in the belt, which went in 40\ndollars at a time. 40 20\u2019s, but \u2014 you know, 40 gold pieces you could put in the belt.\nAnd that\u2019s how I went in to the camp. And one guard asked if he found anything, he\nwould give us bread. So I told him I had \u2014 I found one gold piece, what would I\nget? He said a loaf of bread. And I was buying bread for a 20 dollar gold piece, a\nloaf of bread, which was enough for my brother, myself and my brother-in-law who\nOctober 18, 1993\nwas with us there too. Oh my bra \u2014 what I call him brother-in-law because he\u2019s wa\n\u2014 was my brother\u2019s brother-in-law, but we called him brother-in-law anyway.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Not outside the ghetto, outside of the camp.",
        "A: Yeah. The camp was in the ghetto.",
        "A: Yeah, in \u2014 1-1-in \u2014 in the ghetto \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that\u2019s right, working, mm-hm.",
        "A: Because our was what you call encircled camp with high wires and guards at\nevery section; there was machine guns set up, so we couldn\u2019t do nothing or try to\neven get out of there.",
        "A: Sometimes 10 - 12 hours.\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "A: You could not \u2014 you could not, other than in the, what you call, barracks, you\ncould talk to each other. Outside you could not get a \u2014 an \u2014 an \u2014 and form like a\ngroup. You couldn\u2019t do that, that was not allowed. Inside, yes, but you couldn\u2019t\nform no group. Only thing we did is people were trying to do is make up a \u2014 what\nyou call a song and do \u2014 keep us what you call, happy. Which we learned that few\nof them, I don\u2019t know if you ever heard about it [speaks foreign language here].\nDid you ever hear about it?",
        "A: Okay then. And that\u2019s what we were singing all the time. And it kept us a little\nbit more excited and the feeling as \u2014 as otherwise, you know, it would be just the\nother way around, would drag you down, but that song really kept us going.",
        "A: In the Warsaw we stayed til about September or October, because we heard the\nrumor also \u2014 rumor, that the Russians are closing in on Poland, getting closer and\ncloser to Warsaw. So they told us to get together and take what you got, which we\ndidn\u2019t have nothing.",
        "A: The SS, or the guards.",
        "A: And we will march. What they didn\u2019t tell us where or how long, but we marched\nand we marched.",
        "A: That was in September or October, somewhere around there.",
        "A: Yeah, in the autumn, you know.",
        "A: Yes, we walked. And as we were walking, people were falling out. If he was\nalive, he was shot. If he pretended he wasn\u2019t alive, he was shot anyway to make it\nsure that he was dead.",
        "A: No, they told us we\u2019re walking toward Germany, that\u2019s all we knew. And I\ndidn\u2019t know Poland or Warsaw, anywhere, which way we going. All I knew is that\nwe were walking toward Germany.",
        "A: I couldn't tell you that, but it was quite a few days.\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "A: From sunlight to almost darkness. Sometimes we stopped earlier and just like the\nman was saying, we were using whatever y \u2014 tools you had to make a hole and get\nsome water out of the field to drink it because there was no water. And if you\nwalked on the main line, there was the sewer \u2014 not, I wouldn\u2019t say sewer, but water\ndrainage, and \u2014 and we used to drink water. Whether it was clean or dirty or\ninfected, we didn't think about it, nor did we care about it. All we knew because we\nwere thirsty. And then one time, one \u2014 one time we got to a water and we just ran\ninto the water and \u2014 clothes and all and drinking and \u2014 an-and bathing and just name\nit, we did in the water. Then they wa \u2014 some of them wanted to swim away from it,\nand they were killed in the water. We got out of it, and I think that was the last time\nthat we had water that I know of, is when we were at the river. And then we walked\nabout a couple more days. And they said pretty soon we going to go into a\u2014 no, I\nthink \u2014 I think we were about \u2014 I would say about maybe three or 400 mi \u2014\nkilometers we walked. Then they put us on the train. Where it was, I couldn\u2019t tell\nyou.",
        "A: No, we did not, we used strictly the roads. There was never villages or towns,\nnever.\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "A: None whatsoever, no, none whatsoever.",

        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Ghetto. I mean, there was also other buildings, you know, other than ours. And\nth-that\u2019s what they told us. Now, I cou \u2014 I-I only go what people said and \u2014 and we\nwere \u2014 arrived very few of them in \u2014 in what you call, Dachau.",
        "A: Yes, myself and my brother was hel-helping a-an older gentleman who so \u2014 who\n\u2014 it just so happened he was a rabbi and we carried him so long, so far. After that he\ncould not even walk and we dragged him a little bit, but he just fell down and you\ncouldn\u2019t bend down and try to help him, cause they would kill you the same way.\nAnd so we walked, and I \u2014 we heard a shot.\nOctober 18, 1993\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",

And\nI heard \u2014 this is just what I said, I heard that only about 11 \u2014 1800 or 2800 survived\nand all the rest of them died on the way. This is what people told us. Now, I\ncouldn\u2019t say whether I counted them, because I didn\u2019t, you couldn\u2019t do that. But I\njust going by them and \u2014 and like the gentleman said, that he \u2014 you know, when he\nwalked into Dachau that the \u2014 the whole street was lined up with dead people on\nthe floor.

And \u2014 but nobody was daring\nenough to do that because, like I said, some people wanted to do it in the water, and\nthey shot them. So everybody was afraid to do anything, and I wa \u2014 just so\nhappened I was with my brother and I just couldn\u2019t take a chance on anything. We\nfigure we gonna survive one way or the other.

        "A: He was a\u2014 a\u2014a-\u2014 what you call a preacher I wasn\u2019t sure, a Catholic, or\nwhatever it 1s, but that was a preacher, cause he still had that collar, only the collar\non his neck. Otherwise he had the same striped uniform, you know, and \u2014 and he\ngreeted us and he said I\u2019m not Jewish, he said \u2014 he told us right away that he wasn\u2019t\nJewish. There was many over there 1-1-1n a religious group that were arrested by the\nGerman government.",
        "A: And then we st \u2014 like I said, we stayed a few days, I\u2019m not so sure how long\nbecause we were so tired, and \u2014 and as \u2014 a \u2014 if they allowed us, we were just laying\nand sleeping. Then one day they called and they said, where anybody wants to\nvolunteer to go work in \u2014 1n the underground factory \u2014 building, a factory. And no\none experienced what the man in \u2014 in Auschwitz said, the first thing you do 1s get\nout a ca\u2014a death camp. And exactly that\u2019s what we did, and we got to a small\ntown, what they call Mildorf(ph). And from Mildorf(ph) we had to walk to the\ncamp, which was in the forest, I would say maybe five, no more than eight\nkilometers from there, and they had the cabins. You know, I \u2014 we call them\nbunkers, cause all 1t was 1-1s \u2014 is a roof over it and concrete, everything else\nconcrete. The place that you sleep and \u2014 and sit, or whatever, or walk, it was\nOctober 18, 1993\nnothing but concrete. And we stayed there a few days you know, til they took us\nworking out the camp.",
        "A: Outside of Mildorf(ph), yeah, that was also outside Mildorf(ph). There was an\nunderground factory they were building, and we were \u2014",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know that because it was just in the process of building that \u2014 the\nplace up. And what it is \u2014 was, that people were standing on steel, what you call \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 platform, or \u2014 or \u2014 or shape, then we poured concrete. And if you were not\ncareful and you fell in there, the concrete buried you instantly because it was\nflowing, the concrete, continuously. And it \u2014 that\u2019s the place where I got badly hurt,\nwhen a train, a construction train hit me in my chest and ruptured my ribs,\npunctured my lung and almost killed me. But I survived. God, I believed in God,\nand it helped me. And there was one German worker who had a hat on, they called\nhim Toten Kopf, which translation mean dead head. And he helped me with little\nfood there was in the underground, while I was in the camp, in the working camp,\nwhen I was going a\u2014 I\u2014I came out every day to walk back because they counted\nthe people when they came and when they left, make it sure that there 1s everybody\nOctober 18, 1993\nthere. But every morning when we walked there, which was seven days a week and\nsometimes working 12 - 14 - 15 hours a day, that\u2019s including in walking and\neverything else, and I was most of the time in the bunker, underground and 1n the\ndark, cause I couldn\u2019t breathe. Finally, I got better. And \u2014 and also it was a problem\nin the camp because they threw me out from the barrack because I was moaning\nfrom pain all night long and I couldn\u2019t \u2014 they couldn\u2019t sleep and they f \u2014 they felt\nthat they are so tired that they just cannot take my, what you call misery and \u2014 and\nsound, or pain, cause that would have made them more s \u2014 what you call vulnerable\nto their \u2014 to their work and because they were so tired. Even then we didn't have\nsleep. And many people died there too, in the working place, if not on the what you\ncall, on the march. Cause it was, you know, every day marching to work and from\nwork and lunch. Lunch hour was in a section and we knew what time. When the\nhorn sounded, you\u2019re supposed to go to the \u2014 what they call a \u2014 a lun \u2014 a lunch area.\nAnd people used to always slowly work their way in closer \u2014 closer to their lunch,\nbecause if you didn\u2019t, there was just a si\u2014 one hour time you had to feed I don\u2019t\nknow how many hundreds of people. So natural, you were trying to get closer.\nWhen you were closer you ran to it if you were lucky, you know, and they used to\nput in a \u2014a ladle in that soup, and come out with a potato and he puts it back and\nyou get nothing but water. It has one or two potatoes in it and they showed it\nOctober 18, 1993\neverybody else what it 1s, but never got it. But they showed what it was. But\nanything was cooked, what little was in it, and it \u2014 a-and a little bit, it did help. And\nto prove that it did help, I\u2019m here today.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: There was a Russian prisoner who was driving that little train. And then he\nwanted to put it in reverse, because he was in a standing position, he wanted to put\nit in reverse, and we were around there. And it, instead of reverse, it jumped in drive\nand it jumped \u2014 I was so close to it, that the edge of the train hit my rib, and it \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, that was th \u2014 an accident, 1t was not on purpose [indecipherable] and I\nstill have the thing sticking out over here, even though I had the operation, they\nremoved part of it, not to \u2014 you know, punctured it. But there was a doctor who did\nhelp me, not an official doctor \u2014",
        "A: At the camp, you know \u2014\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "A: Ye-Yes, and he said, let me do something for you and he put his hand and pulled\nout the rib. I almost died in the pain from that alone. And he said now, the blood\nstarted \u2014 stopped running, as it did before. And like I said, everything, it was just\nworking my way, bu \u2014",
        "A: Yeah \u2014 oh yes, he was a prisoner.",
        "A: Yes. But like I said, we didn\u2019t have no doctors, not officially. We didn\u2019t even\nvolunte \u2014",
        "A: He was a Jewish doctor from our area, yes. And he is the one who pulled it out.\nAnd people said, you know, they pronounced me already dead, and I got up in the\nbroad sunlight and I saw the stars, but I announced that I\u2019m not dead, I\u2019m alive. But\nthe blood was just spilling out of my mouth. And you know, what we saw in movies\nand all that, a-all the time, when the person was shot and the blood was coming out\nthe mouth, that \u2014 the sign was, that\u2019s it. And so did \u2014 I thought so too, and\neverybody else around that way.\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "A: Yes, but this German, he w \u2014 he was a worker over there, he 1s the one who\nreally helped me, he gave me some food every day. Not much, because he didn\u2019t\nhave too much either.",
        "A: No, he was a working guy. He was \u2014 looks like a penalized worker, because you\ndidn\u2019t see no civilians, Germans working in that camp. But whatever there was, an\noverseer, or \u2014 or what \u2014 he was not working like we did, but in the same area, so I \u2014\nI couldn\u2019t tell what he was, but I figure he was maybe penalized and put in there\nworking with us, even though supervising. What position, I couldn\u2019t tell because he\nwouldn\u2019t tell me nothing, other than he said he is sorry what they doing to us.",
        "A: He wa \u2014 yes, he took me down in the \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in the bunker every day and he\nsaid, you stay here until I come after you. And he used to come down and got me\nout just before the work was over. So when there was a roll call, I had to lift my\nhand up and said aye, you know, he count so and so, everybody else by name. And\nsometimes they just counted how many people, and they \u2014 each \u2014 each group had\n40 - 50 of them, and you better have 50. One was missing, we stayed there til they\nfind the body or the person.\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "A: Mildorf(ph)? I was in Mildorf(ph) til the last day when the Americans were\nalready close by and some of the guard were talking to each other, you know, that\nth-the Americans are already in \u2014 1n \u2014 close by in Munich and all that. So we knew\nthat it is coming, so they wanted to take us some death camp, and they told us, get\nready, we going into the \u2014 on that train, you know.",
        "A: The Germans told us, yeah. The SS.",
        "A: That was in \u2014 in April, in \u00b044.",
        "A: I mean *45. I me \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, \u201945. And then he said, everybody goes to the train. And we walk \u2014 a-and\nwe \u2014 and we were close, and as we were driving, I don\u2019t know how many miles, not\ntoo many miles, but the American planes attacked the train. And they thought\nmaybe an army train, whatever it is, and the SS took off, the guards, and so did we.\nWe opened the train \u2014 one of them was opened, somebody opened ours because\nevery train was opened, and we were scattered in the forest, but it didn\u2019t last too\nlong because after the plane flew out, the SS guard came back and picked us up and\nOctober 18, 1993\nwalked us back. Now, we were afraid that they \u2014 what we heard about in \u2014 in \u2014\nwhen we were in \u2014 still in \u2014 in our home country, that the SS took civilians in the\nforest and they killed them in the forest. And so we figured that\u2019s it. But as we were\nwalking, it was getting darker and we \u2014 my brother, myself and my brother-in-law, I\ntold them we gonna jump into the gutter, which was filled up with water, and we\nswam down about maybe two or three kilometers and we got up and we walked into\na farmhouse. And that\u2019s \u2014 we stayed til the liberation \u2014 the Americans came in \u2014\nwith the farmer\u2019s approval and knowledge, because he caught us a couple days\nearlier, that we ate the food what they were serving to the pigs. And they were\nmaking so much noise, they knew that something is wrong in their pig house,\nbecause they never made that much noise. So he caught us, but did not give us up.\nHe s \u2014 he told us what to do and where to stay, til the SS were coming back and\nlooking in all the farmhouses. And that\u2019s when the American came in.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, only that \u2014 in that one, or \u2014 there was others, without our knowledge. You\nknow, there was \u2014 well, there was quite a few all around it.\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "A: But were \u2014",
        "A: And my brother, a-and my brother-in-law.",
        "A: Oh no, the SS \u2014 the SS were SS in every guard. They did not treat you right. You\ncouldn\u2019t ask question, and for instance, one time I walked to a SS, a what you call a\nguardhouse, and working on the \u2014 on \u2014 on the field, and he was eating pudding.\nAnd he looked at me and he just threw the pudding on the grass. And he didn\u2019t say\nhere take it. He could have \u2014 you know, he could have done that, but that would\nhave been a \u2014 a\u2014 a goodwill gesture. And so I walked over there and I put it in my\nshirt, which was nothing but a cement sack and I walked back to my brother. And\nwe ate the pudding from my sack. And \u2014 and that \u2014 that was something that he \u2014 he\n\u2014 it was out of this world for the simple reason, we never had anything in those \u2014 in\nthat time that I was in a camp that was sweet, and that was sweet. And that was just\na few days before we were liberated.\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "A: It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s ou \u2014 there\u2019s no word to describe, nor to tell how does it feel to know\nthat the American \u2014 the Americans, you know, were the soldiers, we didn\u2019t know\ndifferent because we couldn\u2019t understand English. But luckily there was \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, we went \u2014 we wen \u2014 we ran to them, we hugged them, and \u2014 and \u2014 and\nthey, you know, tried to, what you call, restrain us to the point they\u2019re hold it, now\nhold it, everything is all right, you\u2019re safe. But the first thing they ask about who is\nsick, what ch \u2014 you know, what \u2014 what\u2019s the problem and so on. And we said food,\nfood, and food. And that\u2019s what we got \u2014 we got from the Americans, plenty food.\nWe had \u2014 matter of fact, we ate to the time that we fell asleep. We were tired and\nhungry. When we were full we just fell asleep over there and \u2014 and \u2014 and stayed\nthere til the next day, which they always ask us what we want to do. And I told\nthem that I want to go back to Czechoslovakia to look for my family, because I\nknew I had a big family. I knew I couldn\u2019t find my father, my mother, my sister, but\nI had younger people. And sure enough, I found my brother, who was a staff captain\nin the Czechoslovakian army. Then I heard from him that one of my brother who\nwas a paratrooper in the Czech army was shot in the air after liberated my\nhometown. Then I found out that two of my sisters were alive also in my\nhometown. And then I have another brother in Budapest. So I traveled from one\nOctober 18, 1993\nend to the other, and I told my younger brother to stay here and I'll try to get the\nfamily together in one place that I know. And that\u2019s how we did what you call got \u2014\nget at a family. I had clothes which I had to give up for my sisters because the\nRussians arrested my sisters, for whatever reason I don\u2019t know, but I went in there\nand they wanted to get my \u2014",

        "A: No.",
        "A: I still had the same \u2014 still had the same clothes on, they didn\u2019t give us clothes.",

There was no \u2014 no \u2014 no money\nexchanged as far as the trains is concerned. But that was so many people and so\nmany army inside there, the only place you could go on the top and even that was\nfull.",

Well we got there \u2014 we wanted\nto go to Prague. From there we got on top of the train and we got to Prague, and\nOctober 18, 1993\nthe first thing we did, we looked up the Jewish community section, because we\nknew that there has to be, because I\u2019m not the only one who survived, so some are \u2014\nthey have to get together and find out, or get information how to get where. And\nsure enough, we found out that I had a brother in Bratislava, which is the capital\ncity of Slovakia. And we again, on the train, on top of the train, we got to\nCzechoslovakia, and they told us where he is, also went to the Jewish community.",
        "A: In\u20141in Bratislava and they told us where. Meanwhile he told us that here is a\nplace that you\u2019re gonna stay while you stay here, and there was food, kitchen,\neverything else, Jewish people who were survivors or hidden, whatever, there\u2019s \u2014\nthey were cooking food there for everybody. And we slipped \u2014 slept in the\napartment there. But anyway, went to see my brother \u2014",

        "A: Yes, they gave me money, not too much, but you see, we didn\u2019t have to buy\nnothing, because everybody was very helpful, even non-Jewish people if you s \u2014 if\nOctober 18, 1993\nyou said you know, what you are and where you come from and all that. So people\nhelped you if you wanted something. Some people gave me apple, some people\ngave me oranges, because they knew I didn\u2019t have a chance to get that. But anyway,\nI went to see my brother.",

I\u2019m your brother. And he looked at me and he said, which one? Cause we had \u2014\nthere was eight of us. And I se \u2014 I told him, I said Baylor. And he started to cry and\nwe all cried, and my younger brother with me over there. And we had \u2014 I mean,\nexcitement 1-1-in my body, I could feel like \u2014 like the blood just circulating with \u2014\nwith the speed in me, and then he was telling me about it that he heard that I \u2014 our\ntwo sisters in my hometown and he could not leave his position, even though he\ncould have gone easily there. So he told me to go and then he said, I heard that\nthere\u2019s one brother in Budapest, and so I went around in my hometown and picked\nup my two sisters and my brother was in Budapest, I took him \u2014 took them over\nthere and then we turn around and went back to Czechoslovakia, into what you call\nBratislava because my brother was there. We stayed \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, and we sta \u2014 stayed there a very short time, then we went up to Prague\nand from Prague they told us that we could have a house if we wanted in the\nSudeten, maybe you heard about the Sudeten.",
        "A: Okay. And I got a house what belonged to postmaster in that section, and we\nstayed in that house until we decided that we want to go back to Germany because\nwe heard that from there they\u2019re going to Israel and what \u2014 America. So we signed\non for both ways and I wind up going to Australia.

But some people were 1n business \u2014 some people were in business.\nBut they gave you food, and you got clothes, so much clothes and what \u2014 what you\nneeded. And then there was a place where you went and cleaned your laundry. I\nmean, it was a normal life in the sense that you didn\u2019t have to worry about anything.\nAnd the \u2014",
        "A: 1950 \u2014 1950 \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 because after th \u2014 after that, at the end of 1950 and then I went into what you\ncall Bremerhaven because I stayed there for awhile and I come out here in 1951 in\nJanuary.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: 7\u00b051.",
        "A: Oh, that was a big \u2014 big story, you see, my brother and my sister, they came in\n1949.\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "A: Somebody \u2014 somebody gave a \u2014 a story that, you know, one of the person that I\nwould not let him play with me soccer. He got mad and he went to the consul and\ntold them that I was a communist. And I asked the consul general, when was I a\ncommunist? And he said I don\u2019t know. I said, before the war I was 14 years old, and\nafter the war I couldn\u2019t be, because I was always \u2014 almost like 1n a prison\n[indecipherable]. So it took a little while and finally he acknowledged that there\nwas nothing but a false rumor and they gave me the paper to apply again, you know,\nand \u2014 and \u2014 and I was within a few \u2014 a couple weeks, I was ready to go. And then I\nwent to Bremerhaven and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 took about 11 \u2014 11 days to come to your country, cause I messed \u2014 missed my\nbrother\u2019s wedding. I had arrived here Monday and his wedding was Sunday.",
        "A: January.",
        "A: Chicago. I had my mother\u2019s brothers, two brothers, the one who sponsored us,\nand that\u2019s where we stayed til everybody got married, and this is why I wa\u2014 I\u2019m\nhere, because my cousin is over here, or \u2014 or her grandchildren.\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "A: I feel that it is nothing we could have done, but the world as a whole, yes, it\ncould have done. And I felt, as I\u2019m speaking in an engagement, that what happened\nto us, it could happen to other people, because people are fighting not a war, but\nalways a religious war. Whatever the reason it is, it happens \u2014 it just so happened\nnow in Russia is the same way with the Orthodox Ukrainian, with the Muslims\nover there, or Yugoslavia, the Serb, and the Muslim. So it could and it does happen.\nBut as far how I feel about it, I think the world could have stopped it and I feel that\npartly President Roosevelt was also like against the Jewish people, which I feel it\nwa \u2014 you know, that\u2019s what everybody else feels the same way about it, because he\nsent the ship back and the Germans figured nobody wanted, so might as well kill us.",
        "A: I always felt Jewish, I always was proud that I am Jewish, and I\u2019ve been\napproach so many time by so many people to convert and I told them that I was\nborn a Jew, I am living as a Jew and I will die as a Jew. I\u2019m a very proud Jew. I\nwould never change with anybody.",
        "A: I beg your pardon?",
        "A: Ah, yes, it does affect me many ways. First is I was beaten up very badly and so\nit have the pain, like my knees, which both has to be replaced. My hand was broken\nand my wrist, and my back, like I said, is like a map. So that\u2019s was one thing. The\nsecond, when I\u2019m in a speaking engagement, I feel all if I sleep, I dream sometimes,\nbut I try to get away from it because it \u2014 it brings bad memories. So \u2014 but I have to\ntalk about it for the simple reason I get it \u2014 I get it out of my system and I feel a\nhundred percent better. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing that, in the speaking engagement.",
        "A: Oh, when I was in the camp, working \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, sometimes with a si\u2014 a\u2014a-\u2014a pick, sometime with a shovel. And\nmany times with a gun butt.",
        "A: The back.",
        "A: Uh-huh. And I never said that \u2014 that I had muscle spasm in my heart and muscle\nspasm in my legs. I was married almost 17 years that when my wife caught me one\ntime in the kitchen on the floor laying, and she turned on the light and I was actually\npale gray. So she thought that I have a heart attack, and I said no, I don\u2019t have a\nOctober 18, 1993\nheart attack, I have muscle spasm attack in my leg and in my heart. And when \u2014 I\ncouldn\u2019t breathe, but the leg paralyzed. I had to roll off the bed and roll into the\nkitchen and get the, what you call the circulation back in my legs. And it\u2019s even\ntoday, I have it for 50 years. Almost 50 \u2014",
        "A: There is no such a thing as a reason for them, for any reason or no reason. They\njust came by and they hit you. Maybe I was in his way, or he just wanted to let me\nknow he is there.",
        "A: Oh yes. When they were in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 around 10 years old, I felt that it\u2019s time for\nthem to know what I went through, that \u2014 what they knew, I was in a concentration\ncamp, but not the details and as we watched some films, they were talking in\nGerman, they always asked me to translate what they saying, and that\u2019s when I was\ntelling them ho \u2014 and what I did and what they did to me. And my son, who was\nvery much active and supportive of the museum, and my younger daughter, who is\nsometimes my spokesperson, she can tell you my story as good as I am because she\nheard it so many times from me, that if \u2014 one time I missed my appointment at\nhome with the TV crew, she was the one who gave my interview, and they\naccepted. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s how well they know.\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "A: A operation?",
        "A: No, I did not apply. I \u2014 I oh \u2014 when I was in Germany one time, I went to the\nJewish organization and they gave me a few hundred dollars. But in this country\nwhen everybody else signed up, I don\u2019t know why, but I just didn\u2019t do it, and \u2014 but\na couple years ago, I applied for a hardship fund and they gave me 3,000 \u2014 no,\n5,000 German mark, and \u2014 which was about 3,000 dollars. That\u2019s the only thing.\nBut applied for it now, when they came out again, the German government said that\nthey have 175 million dollars to give away and so I applied for it, but so far I didn\u2019t\nhear nothing from them.",
        "A: No, no, I think I just about told everything what had happened to me, wheth-\nwhether major or minor, but that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s just about what it is. I \u2014 I think I said\neverything there is to be said, as far as the story that \u2014 you know, that it happened to\nme.\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "A: You\u2019re welcome. And I hope people will hear it and read it, but like I said, I \u2014\nyou know, I have newspaper people come out to my house. There was a Passover\nthey came into my house [indecipherable] paper. If you want me to send you those\nthings, you know, I\u2019ll be glad to send it to you. Also, I have letters from \u2014 at least\n500 letters from schools, from children, from teachers and all that, that they never\nknew that that\u2019s happen. You know, children don\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: And this is \u2014 the people ask me, do you hate? What \u2014 and I ask one time, what\u2019s\nthat? They said, you know, you hate, you don\u2019t like him. Hate does not exist in our\nsociety as far as the Jewish people is, because we [indecipherable] from history,\nthe only thing we teach is remember. Because if I hate somebody, 1s only hurts me.\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt the other party. He doesn\u2019t know and he doesn\u2019t care. So people were\nso surprised that I don\u2019t hate. No, I have a German girl, works in a \u2014 an office that I\nused to be on the board in there and we became very good friends. And she knows\nthat, that I don\u2019t hate her. A matter of fact, her boss is a German Jew, and \u2014 and he\naccepted her, cause she is a very nice person. She was a young girl, she must have\nbeen about 12 \u2014 13 years old. She could have been responsible, something with her\nfather or \u2014 or grandfather, or uncle, or whatever it is. So you can\u2019t hate everybody.\nAnd like I said, there was many good Germans too. And \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014\nOctober 18, 1993",
        "A: Yes, I did. And like even \u2014 like I said, after the liberation, and it\u2019s not that they\nwould [indecipherable] they were saying this way, that they were told if they ever\nhelp any Jewish person, or any prisoner, they will be killed with their whole family.\nSo it was threaten, and let\u2019s face it, that goes the same way like was in Russia. Your\nfamily was in jeopardy if you said something against the government, the same way\nin any other country. So I would say there was many that, like I said, in our\nhometown, when we worked with the army, which was army, German army, they\nwere not hateful, they were not bad. They never touched us, never. And they told us\nthat they don\u2019t want to join the SS because they are nothing but murderers.",
        "A: The next day, when we ask the overseer, the kapos, that what they doing with\nour parents, and he said your parents are dead. If they were old, they are dead the\nsame day, some the next day and it got to us to the point that we were lifeless, like \u2014\nlike no feeling. You just walking in the air and \u2014 and they said you have to get used\nto it and you have to go on living. Either you gonna live or you gonna die here, you\ngot the choice. And we decided to live.",
        "A: Atrived there, that\u2019s correct.\nOctober 18, 1993",
