        "Q: Ivo, would you tell us your name please?",
        "A: Ivo Herzer.",
        "Q: And where and when were you born?",
        "A: Uh, I was born Zagreb, Yugoslavia, on February 5, 1925.",
        "Q: OK. What is, tell us something about Zagreb and what it was like to grow up there.",
        "A: Zagreb is the capital of Croatia. It is one of the six republics in today's Yugoslavia. Uh, it had\na population, Jewish population of 10,000 out of 200,000. Uh, and uh, it was uh, it's a city\nthat resembles Vienna to some extent in its atmosphere because it was in the Austro-\nHungarian part for so many centuries.",
        "Q: Tell me about, what was it like for you. How, where did your family live, in what part, and\nwas it a Jewish quarter? What was it like?",
        "A: There was no Jewish quarter.",
        "Q: OK.",
        "A: There was no ghetto. There had never been any ghetto there. The Jews lived, uh, all over.\nUh, we lived downtown in my grandfather's house. My parents were born in Yugoslavia\nalready, but not my grandparents. The Jews of Zagreb were strongly Zionist. And as far as\nthe religious preference, they were...they practiced conservative Judaism. We were\nAshkenazi, as opposed to the Sephardic Jews of eastern Yugoslavia--in Serbia, in Bosnia[-\nHercegovina], in Montenegro. The total Jewish community of Yugoslavia before the war\nwas about 70,000. As I said, with very strong ties to Eretz Israel at that time.",
        "Q: What about your family? Who made up your, your family?",
        "A: I have no brothers or sisters. And uh, I never met my, uh, grandparents, except one\ngrandmother. So it was just my parents and I. My father was, uh, an employee in an\ninsurance company. We were middle-class, comfortable. There were no signs of overt\nantisemitism there. There was antisemitism but 1t was kept more or less under the surface;\nand especially in the main part of Yugoslavia--in Serbia--there was no anti-semitism,\nbecause the Jews embraced the idea of Yugoslavia rather than separate nations. And so there\nwas no government-sponsored antisemitism. However, a Jew could not become a professor\nin the university, or get a government position or a high government position. This was\nunderstood. Unless you're baptized himself or herself. But otherwise, we were left alone.\nThere was inter-marriage, and there were friendships with the, uh, gentiles. It was quite a\ncomfortable life for the middle-class.",
        "Q: What kind of a schooling did you have?",
        "A: I went to the Jewish elementary school. We had in those days four years of elementary\neducation which was sectarian. So I went to the Jewish elementary school and then it was\nfollowed by eight years of high school, of European high school. I only finished six, because\nthe war came. The Germans attacked when I was just finishing the sixth...uh, sixth year or\nsixth grade.",
        "Q: What was that high school like? This was a secular high school?",
        "A: This was a secular high school, which had a very strict, fixed curriculum embracing all fields\nof science, at least three languages, uh, including Latin. There was Latin, French and\nGerman were obligatory, besides Serbo-Croatian. Religion was taught in separate classes to\nthe Jews, the Catholics, the Moslems, the Orthodox, and so on. So religion was actually the\nmain subject; and if you didn't pass religion, you didn't pass that whole year. It was typical\nEuropean, the educational system. No mercy, no promotion--unless you really passed.",
        "Q: Did you enjoy it?",
        "A: Yes, I...] enjoyed it; because I... was lucky. I was a good student, so it wasn't too difficult for\nme. But this wasn't really a public education where everybody participated, like in the United\nStates. Most of the population did not participate in this type of high school. Uh, there was a\nhigh rate of illiteracy, and, uh, education was not at all wide-spread in Yugoslavia of those\ndays. So this was somewhat of an elite group that went to this type of high school.",
        "Q: You talked about there not being official antisemitism but that antisemitism was sort of felt.\nDid you encounter any such incidents when you were growing up?",
        "A: I really didn't encounter any incident, except in sometimes perhaps a remark, uh, by a teacher\nwho would meet us Jewish children going to our religion class, to another classroom. He\nwould say something. \"Here come the chosen people.\" It was sort of sarcastic, but 1t was...1t\nwas that sort of thing. Or, uh, if, uh, in the streets sometimes children would shout, \"Jew, go\nto Palestine,\" and so on. But I personally did not encounter any strong antisemitic, uh,\nincident. However, there was at least one group, and it's the main group. There was a\npolitical party, underground, a fascist party which was antisemitic. And they did write\ngraffiti and publish slogans, and so on. And they were the Croatian Nationalist Separatists,\nwho didn't want Yugoslavia at all. They wanted independent Croatia, Catholic Croatia; and\nthey were fiercely antisemitic. But they lived mostly in exile. In the inter-war years, they\nlived in Italy and Germany--which countries gave them asylum hoping that someday, as it\nhappened, they could bring them back into Yugoslavia and install them in this Croatian state,\nwhich would then be a satellite of the Axis powers. So there was always the underground;\nand it's a feeling of impending antisemitic, uh, doom. But in everyday life, it wasn't felt as\nmuch as it might have been in other parts of Europe.",
        "Q: What happened when the war broke out?",
        "A: When the war broke out in 1939, Yugoslavia was neutral. And uh, in 1940 Italy attacked\nGreece, and could not achieve a victory there. Germany wanted Greece out of the way. In\nfact, Germany wanted the Balkans secured; because Germany planned to attack the Soviet\nUnion. The Germans pressured the Yugoslav government of the time to let German troops\ngo through Yugoslavia, so that they can then attack Greece. The Yugoslav government\nagreed, but there was a coup which overthrew that government. This was in Serbia. An anti-\nFascist, anti-Nazi coup; and they installed a new government which was openly anti-\nGerman. It was 1n defiance, direct defiance of Hitler. And in response to that, in April 1941,\nhe ordered that Yugoslavia be attacked. Germany and Italy and Hungary and Bulgaria all\nattacked Yugoslavia, and defeated its army 1n about fourteen days. And that Croatian state\nwas then established under the name the \"Independent State of Croatia.\" And the exiled\nnationalists, antisemites, came back to govern that state. They called themselves \"UstaSa.\"\nThat means, uh, \"Men of the Uprising.\" And immediately, within the first week, they began\nto introduce anti-Jewish legislation. Not only Jews, but also the Serbs. Orthodox Serbs were\nreally on their list of destruction. And Gypsies.",
        "Q: Tell us what was in that legislation and how did it affect you?",
        "A: The legislation was sweeping. The Jews, there was a curfew. The Jews had to wear a yellow,\nuh, piece of cloth on the shoulder and in the back with the, uh, word, with the initial for\n\"Jew\" in Yugoslav. They were, of course, thrown out of all jobs; and even out of apartments\nin a certain section of the city. They had to surrender cameras, radios, and so on. It was a\npreliminary, it was a set of measures to isolate the Jews and completely, uh, cow the Jewish\npopulation into numbness. Because it was very sudden. Almost upon arrival of these...of the\nUstaSa. And, selectively, they took certain groups--such as some lawyers--and executed\nthem as being Communists. And they began some deportations. There...those were times,\nthey were somewhat chaotic. I mean, it was a new state. There was chaos. The UstaSa were\nnot that organized. There was a struggle between the Germans and Italians, diplomatic\nstruggle, for the control of that state. And the Germans won that control. The Italians, who\nhad banked on that, lost even though the Italians also got a piece of Yugoslavia. In other\nwords, it is important to understand that after the victory over Yugoslavia, the Axis powers\ndismembered Yugoslavia. There was no more Yugoslavia as a state. There was the\nIndependent State of Croatia; Serbia was occupied by Germany; western Yugoslavia--that 1s,\nSlovenia--was divided between the Germans and Italians. And most important, for my story,\nthe Italians occupied that Adriatic coast of Yugoslavia and most of the islands. They also\nannexed part of that coast--the best part, the richest for tourism--Dalmatia, and made it part\nof Italy. So that was the situation. The Jews in Croatia [were] being slowly herded together,\nand taken to various camps. At one time, there were some thirteen or fourteen camps\noperating in Croatia. The Germans were not in these camps. This was all...they were all run\nby the UstaSa. The, uh, savagerity that was practiced in these camps was such that even the\nGermans were horrified. In their internal memoranda, they called it the \"Balkan bestiality.\"\nAt one point--I don't remember the exact date, in July that same year--a transport was being\nformed. In other words, again Jews were being arrested, to be transported to an island where\nthey all perished. I was arrested on a certain day. And I was then sixteen at the time. The\nagent detective who came to arrest me, the Croatian, had my name on his list and not my\nfather's name. This was unusual. And my father protested and said that it must be a mistake.\nHe wanted to substitute himself for me, saying that \"You probably mean me, and not my\nson.\" The detective insisted, \"No, it says Ivo Herzer and I have to take him.\" So my father\nsaid, \"Well, I'll come with you.\" Of course, he couldn't go into that transitory camp; and so I\nwas taken there. This was on the outskirts of the city of Zagreb, where fairs were held\nusually. And there were several hundred Jewish families with babies, complete families,\npushed against the wall. And machine guns--heavy machine guns--were manned by the\nUstaSa, aimed at this mass of Jews who were...we had to respond to a roll call about every\nhour. We didn't know at all what would happen. Now we know what happened to that\ntransport. As I said, they were taken to the island of Pag, P - A - G; and they all perished\nthere under horrible circumstances. I was just lucky; because during the evening roll call,\nwhen my name came up, the UstaSa officer in charge said, \"Are you here alone?\" Since they\nhad families. I said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Take your things and go home.\" Just like that. He\ncould have easily said, \"Bring his family.\" He didn't. Now this was past curfew time. I had\nno paper in my hand to prove that I had a right to be anywhere. And so I ran home; and I\nwasn't...no patrol found me. I was lucky. And my parents thought they had lost me already.\nAnd they couldn't believe their eyes when I just burst in upon them. It was then that my\nparents decided that we must do something. Try to escape. But escape where? The partisans\nwere not yet active. Yugoslavia was surrounded by countries that were already under\nGerman domination. How could we, ordinary middle-class people, escape? And then the\ndecision was made. Let us try to somehow escape to the Italian zone in Yugoslavia. Maybe\nthe Italians will let us in. Maybe they're not as bad as the Germans. Because we didn't really\nknow anything about Fascist Italy. Since the Jewish community in Zagreb was oriented\ntoward Austria and the German-speaking Europe, Italy was the place to go for a vacation\nmaybe. But the fundamental difference between Fascism and Nazism, as far as Jews were\nconcerned, was unknown to us. To us, this was a gamble. And my father obtained some sort\nof pass which could be gotten for some money. It was just a pass that said that we could be\nlet out of Croatia, but didn't guarantee any entry anywhere. With this pass, without the\nyellow signs--which was a great risk--we left in July 1941 by train for the border. We wanted\nto go actually to the city of Split--Spalato, in Italian--which then was in Dalmatia, which\nthen became Italy. And we thought if we reached that city somehow, as many Jews did, we\nwould be safe--provided the Italians don't turn us back. On the way to Spalato, however,\nsome troubles developed to the railroad. It seems that some guerillas must have blown up the\ntracks. The train was turned back; and we landed in a city which was the worst place to be.\nAnd this was the city of the Croatian Nationalists, where the UstaSa movement was born--the\ncity of Gospi_--in a desolate part of the country with curfews, patrols, and a concentration\ncamp for Jews just outside of Gosp1_. We didn't know that, but there it was. The three of us,\nplus perhaps six or seven other Jews whom we knew who tried to do the same thing, we\ncoalesced into a small group, milling around at the station and then trying to go into town.\nIt's a small town. On the way, we just knocked on a door--the first peasant house we saw.\nFortunately, this was a house owned by an old Serb woman. And the Serbs were, at that\ntime, again persecuted by the Croatians, just like the Jews. So she understood our plight. But\nshe was afraid of harboring us. She said she could keep us only for so many hours. We sat\nthere. We...we stayed in the house not knowing what to do. We couldn't go back to Zagreb.\nWe couldn't go forward. We had false documents. We were lost. To all intents and purposes,\nit seemed a completely impossible situation. But again, we were lucky in that there was an\nItalian garrison in that town--as there were Italian garrisons all over the region which was not\nfar from the sea, from the coast. At...we just ...we saw three Italian soldiers, or maybe four. I\nspoke a little Italian, almost nothing; and my father a little, because he took Italian in his high\nschool days. We just approached these soldiers, just on the wild chance that they might help\nus. And we told them two words: \"ebrei\"--which means Jews, [and] \"paura\"--fear. They\nimmediately understood, because they knew what was going on--as we now know. And they\ntold us to quickly go back to the house, \"calma\"--calm, and they would bring their sergeant.\nTheir sergeant came. He spoke some French, and uh, we...we knew French. It was easier to\ncommunicate. He said, \"Stay here. I'll see if I can get maybe a pass for you, to get you into\nItaly.\" And he left. We didn't believe him. We thought he just said nice things. How would\nhe, who 1s he, didn't want any money. He never knew us, but he came back. He said he\ncouldn't get a pass for us; but at midnight he will come with a few soldiers and he will put us\non an Italian military train. And there...and doing that would be enough to smuggle us into\nItaly proper. Again, we were quite skeptical. Why would he do that? But he did. And this\nwas unforgettable. Uh, at night Italian soldiers carrying our bags and rucksacks, marching\nus--protectively--to the railroad station with this sergeant, waiting for an Italian military\ntrain. When the train came, he told us to get in; and he himself boarded the train. Now, the\ntrain was full of Italian soldiers who immediately gave room to the...to my mother and other\nladies in the small group, offered us some food. And I think he just said, \"These are\nrefugees.\" And as soon as you heard the word...he said the word \"refugee\" to Italians, they\nimmediately...their hearts melted. Whether it was an Italian refugee or a Jewish refugee,\ndidn't matter. They didn't protest. After all, we were civilians. We had no right to be on that\ntrain at all. Then, at the border, there were difficulties. Now, I'm talking about the border\nwith Italy proper; because that whole scheme of getting to Split, in Dalmatia, had to be\nabandoned. He wanted us to go to the city of Flume [Croatian: Rijeka], from where we\ncould go Trieste--which was then Italy--and we would be safe. He got us across the border.\nThey didn't know what to do with us, so they put us into the Customs House. He went to the\nauthorities and said, \"Here are these refugees; they haven't had anything to eat or drink.\nThey've got to be given something.\" And some women's organization came, and they gave\nus orangeade and sandwiches to eat. And we stayed there almost a whole day. He left us,\nbecause he was assured by the authorities that we could stay. He shook hands with us and\nleft. We never knew his name. However, at night, we were surprised. The authorities really\ndid not allow us to stay. They put us back on a train and pushed us back into Croatia. We\npleaded with the, uh, Italian military police, the Carabinieri, to give us back our documents,\nsuch as they were, so the UstaSa would not see that we are being pushed back as Jews.\nMaybe that way we could escape, go back and try again. And the Carabinieri complied with\nour requests. So we made it back again, and we went all the way to Zagreb. We were totally\nexhausted. It was the most foolish thing to do, but we didn't really know what to do. And\nwhen we came to our apartment--this was only a few days later--it had already been taken. In\nthe meantime, they came to search for us, to arrest all of us. Not having found us, they gave\nthe apartment to a functionary of the UstaSa, who lived there. And the neighbors told us to\njust run away, because they were looking for us, as they were for other Jews. So we went\nagain, and tried the same thing again. This time we made it across the border.",
        "Q: How did you get across the border?",
        "A: We got off the train just before the border. We went to a village--again at random--and\nknocked on a door. And a peasant woman opened up. We actually told her who we were,\nthat we were looking...we had money, we were looking for someone to smuggle us across\nthe border. We knew that near the border, there were always smugglers. That is, there was\nalways traffic from Italy into Yugoslavia and back; and that possibly the peasants would\nknow some secret path. And it was true. Uh, this, uh, woman knew some people who took us\nacross the border. We were not alone. We were also again in a group maybe of ten, twelve\npeople. Not just the three of us. This time we made it. And we lived in a town near Fiume,\u2019\nin Italy, for one month. Hiding. But the Italian police found us after one month. They\narrested my father and myself, kept us in for one night. The Police Commissioner was very\nembarrassed. And that was after the sergeant, the experience with the sergeant, which told us\nsomething about the Italians. Now the Commissioner of Police, when my father and I were\nbrought to his office, he got up and he shook hands with us and asked us to sit down. This\nwas not the Commissioner of Police that we expected to see. And he told us that he has no\npower to do anything, but he will leave our cell door open-- unlocked--as a symbol that we\nare not really prisoners. In the morning, we will be reunited with our wives and mothers.\nThere were other Jews in that same town. They were all picked up. And so there was a\nsizable group of us. We were being marched to a bus. And we thought, \"My God. Again\nthey're going to push us back into Croatia.\" But they didn't do it. By that time--and we know\nthis now--their policy has changed ...had changed. The policy of returning Jews or not letting\nthem stay lasted only in the very first weeks of the UstaSa regime. Once the Italians\ngrasped...understood what was going on with the Jews and the Serbs, and the Gypsies, they\ndid not push anybody anymore across the border. They engaged in intense activity as to\nwhat's to be done. But we have documents today that clearly show that neither the Governor\nof Dalmatia nor the Italian General [ Vittorio] Ambrosio 1n charge of the Second Army on\nthat territory had any intentions to return us into the UstaSa hands. So the bus took us to\nformer resort town of Cirquenizza--C-I-R-Q-U-E-N-I-Z-Z-A [Croatian: Crikvenica]--\nwhere, uh, we used to go for summer vacation, as many others. It was the headquarters of the\nFifth Corps. By that time there were some fifty or sixty, a small group of refugees. We\n' In an article published in Midstream in June/July 1983, Mr. Herzer identified this town as SuSak,\na suburb of Firume.\nsettled there and we had, of course, representatives. My father was one of the oldest among\nthe refugees. He spoke some Italian, so naturally he represented us. He went to the Major in\ncharge of civilian affairs. He received him as if he were a friend. He said, \"You are\nprotected, and you are under Italian protection. Give us your names, your addresses. The\nUstaSa, who have the civil authority, won't be able to do you any physical harm.\" As an\nexample, the UstaSa did not want to give us ration cards. The Italians forced them to give us\nration cards. The UstaSa said we have to wear those signs--again, yellow signs. The Italians\ntold us, \"Well, let them have that. We must give in on some point. But physically, they will\nnot be able to harm you, deport you, or put you in jail.\" Now, our numbers increased;\nbecause my experience roughly speaking was repeated in many cases. Between four and five\nthousand Croatian Jews--almost all that survived--found their way to the Italian occupation\nzone in Yugoslavia. Either to the zone--we were in a zone, not yet in Italy--or to the annexed\npart of Yugoslavia, which was much safer. There were no Croatians there at all. But we were\nsafe. All came and started a very extraordinary period in my life, because we developed\nclose relations with the Italian army. Italian officers started dating Jewish girls. Uh, the\nItalian major came to play bridge with my parents and another Jewish lady. He brought me\ndictionaries. They brought us food. Uh, there were two things that stand out. One, that two\nweeks roughly I think after our arrival in Crikvenica was Yom Kippur. And, uh, somehow\nthe Italian major--whose name was Cipolla--learned this high holiday was at hand. He called\nmy father, and told him that he had reserved a school room for the services. He abolished the\ncurfew; because this was a war zone, due to guerrilla activity. He abolished the, uh, the ban\non assembly which they had. You had to special permission if you had... As you normally\nhave to have, in areas of martial law. And so we actually could celebrate Yom Kippur. And\nhe sent a lieutenant as his representative, who gave a little speech. It was incredible.",
        "Q: How many people were there? And describe the scene. We're talking about Yom Kippur,\nKol Nidre in a school house?",
        "A: Yeah. This... (PAUSE) I don't think there were more than thirty, forty people there at the\ntime. The numbers increased, but this was very early. This was somewhere in October '41. It\nwas still early. October '41. It wasn't an elaborate service, but... And I don't even know and\nremember who held the services, who actually led; but there is always somebody you can\nfind, among thirty Jews, somebody who would be able to do it. We could read, after all,\nHebrew. We... somebody had, uh, the prayer books. And this was, of course, morally and\npsychologically, a tremendous boost. And shortly thereafter, we had another proof that they\nwent--the Italians--beyond accepting us, or receiving us, or protecting us; when they invited\nall of us to a performance given for the Italian troops by an Italian military group of\nentertainers. And they gave us the place of honor, the first row. And, uh, it was really, I must\nsay, uh, a...a moment that I can't forget. When, uh, we stood up. The Italian national anthem\nwas played. The anthem of an Axis power, of the closest ally of Germany. And here are\ntwenty, thirty Jews as their guests of honor. We couldn't understand it. It was just like a\ndream. This situation existed until November '42. Almost a year. We studied Italian. We felt\nsafe. We, of course, wrote furiously to those who survived the initial deportations to come to\nthe zone in...1n whatever way possible. The connections established with the Italian officers--\nthat is, the connections we establish with them--were very productive. Because these officers\nwere able to go, of course, anywhere in Croatia. Wherever they wanted to. And they would\ngo by trucks and cars; and bring the parents, bring the sisters and bring the relatives of the\nJews who were already in their zone.",
        "Q: And they did that?",
        "A: And they did that. They even used armored cars, in a fake exercise, military exercise; and\nthey did it at first on their own and spontaneously, without informing too much their very\nhigh authorities. So that the evidence is episodic, it's in anecdotes. But it is known that so\nmany, that today there is no question that this was... It started from the lower ranks of the\nArmy, just as our sergeant and many other such sergeants or lieutenants. But then it became\na policy. It... 1t received complete approval by the highest levels of the Army and the Italian\nForeign Ministry; which we, of course, did not know then. But we know today. Now, we\ncould guess that the pressure on Italians that the Germans and Croatians exercised for our\nextradition was enormous. What right do they have to protect Jews who are not Italian\ncitizens? Because we really had nothing whatsoever in common with Italy. And they fought\nback diplomatically until November '42, when they felt they have to do something--\notherwise, they would have to yield to the Germans or the Croatians. They decided to put all\nthe Jews in the Yugoslav zones under the occupation into a camp. Plus several hotels, those\nregions that were very far from the camp. Tell the Germans we are in a camp. Tell the\nGermans that a census 1s being taken to see if any... any one of us might have some claims to\nItalian citizenship, because Italian citizens were protected. Jewish are not, all the time, at the\ntime. There were even some Italian Jews living in Germany, and the Germans would not\ntouch them. So the Italians used that as a pretext. This was part of a plan, of a consciously\ndesigned plan by a so-called rescue committee headed by the highest officials of the Italian\nForeign Ministry--Pietromarchi, D'Aj eta,\u2019 Ducci, several other names, all known today, in\nthe Foreign Ministry*--decided that the Jews would not be turned over to the Germans\nanywhere the Italians had control of the territory. The Italian Army cooperated with this\nwhole-heartedly. In November '42, the Italians arrested all of us, put us on trucks, and we\nwere taken to this camp--still Croatian Yugoslav territory, but under Italian flag. We didn't\nknow again; we thought maybe this 1s just a stage before our being turned over to the\nCroatians. And, unfortunately, there were two people committed suicide; and the morale was\nvery low. And the Italian commander of...of the Second Army, which is a very high official,\nhe came personally to the camp to give us a speech to reassure us that we would be\n* Count Luca Pietromarchi was head of the Occupied Territories Department of the Italian Foreign\nMinistry.\n* Count Blasco Lanzo d'Ajeta was Bureau Chief under Foreign Minister Ciano.\n* Including Vittorio Castellani, who served as liaison officer between the Second Army and the\nForeign Ministry.\nprotected. \"As long as that flag flies there, nobody can touch the camp.\" And we were told\nthat we were free within the camp to organize ourselves; which we did. They gave us the\npossibility of having a school--elementary and high school--synagogue, social hall. Medical\nfacilities were 1n...1n the camp were primitive, but all serious cases--and there were many--\nwere taken outside the camp into the Italian military hospital. So that, while the camp itself\nwas an ex-Yugoslav, uh, military base for the cavalry--so that we really lived in stables--but\nit...conditions were harsh but quite tolerable. There was no physical threat. There was no\noutright hunger; even though the rations were quite small. But we had opportunity to buy\nfood, extra food. There were people with means who were allowed to contribute, and then\nsomeone would go to Italy and bring food. The Italian Jewish organizations helped us,\nbecause they were allowed to function under Mussolini. So that while we didn't have the\nideal nutrition, nobody really starved. After all, we did go to school. I studied English;\nbesides, many other people studied the chess. Our evenings were free, and it wasn't the worst\nway to spend your days in World War II. Without there, you had the storm of the Final\nSolution not so many miles away from us. To think today that there were one million\nchildren perished; and here, under the Italian flag, we studied Latin and history and the\nItalian language and philosophy... It's still incredible that it happened.",
        "Q: How did your family manage in this, under these sparse conditions? What did your parents\ndo? What did you do? Did your father work, for instance?",
        "A: No. My father owned a third of the house where we lived. Two sisters and my father, and we\nsold the house about two weeks before the Germans attacked. And so we had some capital.\nMy father was near 60, at the time; my mother, much younger. So there was no work. There\nwas only... In Cirquenizza, before we were in the camp, we lived from...from the money that\nwe got for the house. And in the camp, we had some extra money; but there was no work.\nEverybody had to do something only to maintain the camp. The main thing 1s that my...my\nrecollection is that there was no fear, because we didn't see any maltreatment, any\nmistreatment of anyone, any torture, any beating. I...because I went to school, I was detailed\nto the ...to clean, to the cleaning of the grounds--as were other students. But Italian soldiers\nalso had to work doing the same tasks. So I had a broom; and the Italian soldier had a broom.\nWe worked together. It was this kind of thing that it's hard to imagine. It was a concentration\ncamp, in that it was surrounded by barbed wire; but one where we did not want to leave. In\nthe country, there were people still--late arrivals--who petitioned the Italian authorities to\nsend them to the camp, because it was the only safe place to be--for Jews. (PAUSE) I was\nalso growing up, in a sense, in those years; because I was sixteen when the whole thing\nstarted in 19--at the end. I tried to continue living sort of as a goody-goody student; because\nit was tough to study Latin and so on under those circumstances. But as I say, the feeling of\nsecurity was such that it compensated for all the hardship. For example, we celebrated\nPassover 1943. I found a document where the Italian command approved celebration of\nPassover in the camp. But we had the camp commandant and the other officers as our guests;\nand they sat in the first row of the social hall, where there were chairs. We had musical\nentertainment. There were many people in the camp, of course, who could play musical\ninstruments. There were some singers. The Italians were starved for this; because they were\ngenerally...the officers were quite well educated. And here they had an opportunity to listen\nto Italian opera and Italian songs. And so, it wasn't really a relationship of captors to\ncaptured. It was quite close. Again, it would not have been a bad thing for us or anybody\nto...to...to live the war--as terrible as it was--in that way. Unfortunately, there were always\nother events pressing that rendered our situation precarious. 1943--just to give a quick\noverview, in January '43 was Stalingrad. Great reverse for the Germans. Not much later the\nloss of Africa, North Africa. The Italians realized that the Allies would invade Italy. The\nItalian army might be pulled back. And they started to worry what would they do with us.\nThey decided to then concentrate all the Jews, not just in the camp where we were--which\nwas one of about two thousand people--but there were also other smaller camps. Not really\ncamps: there were Jewish groups 1n hotels around the Dubrovnik in the south. To\nconcentrate all the Jews in one camp on the island of Arbe [Croatian: Rab]. This island was\nYugoslav island. It is still Yugoslavia today; but then it was annexed to Italy. To remove us\nfrom the Croatian authorities completely. They proceeded to do this in July 1943. And that\ncamp--again the numbers, they still... No one knows how many there were, because the\nItalians always quote ...quoted lower numbers to the Germans than the turnovers are the\nJews. Said no there were more of us; but I think it was something like three to four thousand\nin this one large camp in Arbe. July '43 was also the month when Mussolini fell; and\nSeptember 8th, Italy surrendered to the Allies. And that was the moment of the great danger\nfor us, because the Italians surrendered. The camp now was free. The Italian Army did not\nmanage to arrange for our transfer to Italy proper. The soldiers just threw away their\nweapons and left. We were free; but the Germans and the UstaSa were not so far. And that\nwas the moment of great danger for us. Fortunately, Tito's partisans took over that island for\na while. And in that interim period, most of the...by far, of the camp inmates either went to\nthe mountains, to the mainland; or, as we did, went south toward Anglo-American-occupied\nItaly. Some are trying to reach Italy in December on the Adriatic, which was pretty fool-\nhardy to...to try. But we did. Two hundred people could not make it. They were old and sick;\nand they were found by the Germans and taken to Auschwitz. But, as I said, the great\nmajority of us--almost three thousand-- survived, thanks to the Italian intervention and\nprotection in the years '41 to '43. Which they practiced in the south of France, and in Greece,\ntoo.\n(Technical Conversation)\nTAPE #2\n(Technical Conversation)",
        "Q: Ivo, let's pick up, uh, with your story of moving south. Uh, the camp had been opened and\nyou were free. Did you have any contact with Tito's Partisans yourself?",
        "A: Uh, very, very little. Very little.\n(PAUSE)\n(Technical conversation)",
        "Q: The camp is opened. Some of you went north. Your family now is heading south.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: OK. Tell us about it.",
        "A: We, we knew that the Allies had landed not only in Sicily, but also southern Italy. So that the\nline from Bari, the major city on the Adriatic coast, was already in Anglo-American hands.\nNow to get there, one had to go quite some distance--uh, island-hopping, so to say, because\nthere are many islands, in the midst of uncertainty. Who is on the next island? How is the\npopulation? Are they pro-German, pro-UstaSa, or what? Everywhere we went, we saw white\nflags. The poor people on those islands who suffered hunger anyway, they wanted to say\nthey surrendered to whoever comes. They're not going to fight. They were small islands, and\nI think that helped us. We didn't come as...we just came as a small group. And it's not clear to\nme how my parents and other, uh, grown-ups managed to arrange. I know it was money to\npay someone to take us in a small boat to the next island. The conditions were bad. It was\nDecember, and the Adriatic was not, uh, a very calm sea at that time. But this was also good,\nbecause German patrols didn't go out very much. So we managed to reach a large island of\nVis, V -I- S. On that island there were some British torpedo boats and Partisans; but at that\ntime, the Partisans were Stalinists. Did not allow any contact with the British, so that we\ncould not contact them. Fortunately, there were other refugees--not Jewish refugees, but just\nrefugees. People from...running away from the horrible conditions of the multiple civil wars\nwithin Yugoslavia. There were Quislings, the Partisans, the Chetniks and all the other groups\nfighting each other; and many people just couldn't stand it anymore. So that island was full\nof refugees. And all I can remember is that at one point all of us were picked up by a British\nship military ship. Actually, it was a passenger ship which they requisitioned. And it brought\nus to Bari. But the British would not let us off the ship in Bari. They directed us to Taranto,\nall the way in the south of Italy. And from there, we were taken to camps again. The British\nhad camps at the very heel of Italy. And so we landed again in camps. We were fed. We\nwere safe. And the fate that the British ordained for us was to transfer us to Egypt, to some\ncamps...tent camps outside Cairo. The problem is...was that we were then surrounded by\nrefugees; and among those refugees were also former UstaSa and elements. Because the war\nwas coming to a close; and those days people would then run simply and cross and defect\nfrom one side to the winning side. And we decided to get out of that camp in Italy now. And\nthat was possible. We had to sign some papers; and then by train came to Bari, Italy--which\nwas under the British Eighth Army. So that this was really then the liberation, in a sense, for\nme. We were then safe.",
        "Q: What did you do in Bari? You were \u2014_\u2014_\u2014sain. Bar\u2019?",
        "A: In Bari, the British Army employed masses of refugees--and later also Italians, who were\nonly considered co-belligerents--for all kinds of duties, from menial to duties of translators. I\ngot a job within one week with the British Field Security as translator and typist; because I\nknew English by that time, having studied very hard 1n the Italian camp. I didn't know what\nit sounded like, but I still knew it. But by that time I knew Italian and Serb-Croatian and\nGerman; and there were always questions and documents and, uh, interrogations of...of\nprisoners. And it was chaotic, to say the least, also in that time. And they needed somebody\nto do it. So that was a job which then paid and gave us rations. It was very easy, in a way, it\nseemed, to make a living. My mother got a job. She worked for a British outfit called Toch-\nH (ph), which served tea and crumpets to the British officers and commissioned...non-\ncommissioned officers, too. So she got a job there because she knew English from before.\nAnd finally, my father even found employment in censorship. Uh, they had a vast\nCensorship Office; uh, and he would read all these letters. And sometimes letters by people\nthat he knew. And he would just say, \"Hello, here are my greetings,\" and \"Why are you\nwriting so much?,\" or whatever. Those were very good times. Now we were in Italy. Uh, all\nI thought of was to resume my life somehow. But as I say, there was, of course, physical\nsafety. And then the gratitude we felt toward the Italians, and the way the Italians even then\nreceived us. I, uh, studied for my high school, for Italian high school final exam--which is\nnot very easy. So I studied at night with a professor while I worked. And, uh, again, they ...1n\nthe test, the test they gave me, the oral test, they chose questions that they knew I would\nanswer with greater ease than some others. They didn't ask me obscure questions about\nItalian history, but something that they felt I could answer. So their attitude toward refugees\nare people in trouble carried through. Even though at that time, for example, there were great\ndifficulties with Yugoslavia; because Yugoslavia wanted Trieste. And we were... Yugoslavs\nwould have been enemies of Italy. And they never were very friendly, because the two\ncountries have always had a great deal of difficulty because of Dalmatia--coveted by Italy,\nand so on. And yet, on a personal level, I never experienced that. I spoke very good Italian,\nwhich helped; because if you speak Italian, the Italians generally will feel this is quite an\nhonor to them. Somebody took the trouble to study the language. So my difficulties were\nover. But I didn't yet quite realize how rare the Italian gesture was, because the full impact of\nthe Holocaust was not known. I'm talking now about 1944, '45. It wasn't known. It came out\ndifferently and slowly; and gradually, one realized what...what really happened. And what\ncould have happened to us.",
        "Q: Bari. You stayed in Bari for how long?",
        "A: I stayed in Bari from January '44 'til 1946, somewhere '46.",
        "Q: Where did you live?",
        "A: Lived in the middle of a city, in an apartment. The apartment was assigned to us by the\nBritish military authorities that assigned empty apartments to refugees. Because many\nItalians had fled. Fled the bombing; or many Fascists fled, thinking that they would be\npunished if caught. So there were many apartments free. So we lived there in this assigned\napartment. I'm sure the rent was almost zero. I worked, in the beginning; and this was\nenough to feed us, because I got rations plus money. And I then got another job. After the\njob with the Field Security, I got a job teaching English to Yugoslav partisans who were in\nhospitals all around Bari. So I worked for the British Council, which 1s like the Voice of\nAmerica. It is a similar organization. Uh, and they paid quite well. So I...we were able to\nreally be independent.",
        "Q: It sounds as if you lived really fairly comfortably.",
        "A: Yes, I...I think we...we did. Because with two of us working, and then three of us working,\nsurely. Then came the end of the war; and then the British Council closed its doors, and I\nwent to Rome. Someone told me go the American Joint Distribution Committee. I went\nthere, and it was early in the formation of the Joint. I'm using the word \"Joint\" - it's the\nAmerican Joint Distribution. Was...and they said, \"Yes, you can. You'll work for us. If you\nknow these languages, fine.\" So I moved to Rome; and my parents then moved later, a little\nbit later. And I worked for the Joint Distribution Committee from '46 until '48. I was an\nadministrative secretary in the HaSharot Department. We dealt with the refugees of the, of\nthe Brichah, the...the Jewish survivors of the Holocaust who sought to go to Palestine--later\nIsrael. They reached Italy from Poland or Russia, from all the other camps; but before that,\nthey were housed in various places 1n Italy. And then they would generally secretly embark\nand hope not to be intercepted by the British and taken to Cyprus. Well, I worked in that\ndepartment, in an administrative capacity to somebody; and did translations and dictations\nand so on, visiting those HaSharot, listening to...to what they needed, their needs, their\nrequests, making out requisitions and so on. This was until 1948.",
        "Q: Tell me... Talk about the Joint during this period. You were really in the middle of all this.\nWhat was the organization itself like during this period and what kinds of things did you do?\nLet's talk about the organization first. What it was like? How big was it? How active were\nthe people who worked for it?",
        "A: The upper management came from the United States; and, uh, the, uh, middle management\nand support staff was all recruited from refugees. Not so much locally, not...not the Italians;\nbut refugees, uh, who came from various countries of Europe. The Yugoslavs were very\nnumerous, because obviously there were many Yugoslavs who found themselves in Italy.\nBut there were Poles, and Germans and Austrians, and so on. There was a very mixed staff.\nThe activities that had to deal with the actual illegal immigration were not known to me.\nThey...I mean, they...they kept it well hidden. I mean, I did not overtly have you know\nanything. I... only surmised that something was going on; when suddenly, two HaSharot\nwere closed and nobody was there. But it had to be done this way, because the British of\ncourse didn't just want to intercept the immigrants or potential immigrants at sea. But they\npressured the Italian government to use their police surveillance to prevent the embarkation\nof Jews bent on...on breaking the blockade to Palestine. So it had to be really kept very\nsecret. And I know it was because none...none of the co-workers that I remember knew\nanything about it. There were a few individuals, I remember, who were Sabras; and they\nwere, I think, in charge of that. And they did not have a clear job. It was never clear to me\nwhat they were doing; but they spoke perfect Hebrew, and they looked to me like the kind of\nguys who could and would organize and had no fear. Very decisive men, who could not only\nlead a meeting but also lead people at night through a mine field. That much I...I still\nremember; but I didn't have direct, any direct work. I didn't take part in that.(PAUSE) The\nquestion was for everyone, when the war ended, what do to, where to go. We didn't want to\ngo back to Yugoslavia--which was at that time not just Communist, but Stalinist Communist.\nAnd we just couldn't. Certainly my father would not go, and I would do whatever he said. At\nthat time, I wasn't on my own; and I never had any desire to go there. The question was\nPalestine or Israel on one hand, or the New World. But out of Europe. Many people wanted\nout, just out. And, uh, I received a Hillel B'nai B'rith scholarship 1n '48, which then decided.\nAnd the decision was made then for me, obviously, that I could go and study, make up the\nlost time. Because somehow, in the narrow vision, that's all I saw--that I lost these years, and\nI had to make them up. That was the main thing. Especially after the shock--which was a big\nshock to me--that now that I survived, I really couldn't go back. Because I always wanted to\ngo back. I mean, in my dreams or in my feelings and hopes, that if I survive, the war is over,\nwe're only a few miles from Zagreb, we will go back. And I'll find some friends; and, uh,\nsomehow you go back. I never thought of really leaving while I was under the Italian\ncontrol. But then afterwards, it became clear that there was no back, that there were no\nfriends. Because Croatia, that independent state of Croatia we talked about, the Ustasa\nCroatia, contained about thirty thousand Jews. But no more than, uh, fifteen percent\nsurvived. So really, even apart from the regime, there was no real going back.",
        "Q: It must have been very hard.",
        "A: This was very hard. It was very, uh...in a way it was, to realize that you're 1n exile, in a sense.\nBecause it is, after all, we couldn't go back. We could have. But in 1948, when Tito broke\nwith Soviets and allowed the Jews to leave, practically all Yugoslav Jews left for Israel. Not\nall, but practically all. They just weren't happy there. But not because of any antisemitism,\nbut just the conditions. After all, the conditions were just the way they are today in Poland or\nEast Germany and so on.",
        "Q: So you had this B'nai B'rith scholarship?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: To where?",
        "A: To the University of Illinois. I said I wanted to study engineering. And, uh, then they gave\nscholarship to quite a few individuals who had to prove that they knew English, and so on\nand so on, and finished high school. Which wasn't easy in Europe to achieve. But they\nchoose...they chose the school; and they sent me to the University of Illinois in 1948. And I,\nuh, studied electrical engineering, and I graduated in 1951 because I had some courses. I...I\nwent to University in Bari and took some engineering courses also. So they recognized that.\nAnd I went summers, and speeded up.",
        "Q: Did your parents come with you, and how?",
        "A: No. That was probably the worst thing, uh, in our lives. That we were together during the\nwar, and could not really be together afterwards. Because they were...applied for, on a quota,\nfor a visa to get to the United States; and, uh, there was a spot on my father's lungs. And an\nAmerican doctor said this is TB. And from that moment on--no matter what other doctors\nsaid or what other tests were conducted showing that it's a dead process, not an active\nprocess, because my father was a heavy smoker--that original decision could not be\nrescinded. But my mother was forced to come here so she would not loose her place. She\ncame in 1949 to the United States. Had to leave him there. In 1949, he was already 66 years\nold; and he could never get this entry visa, even though later on he came as a visitor. My\nmother went there from back to Italy. By that time, they had no more money. They had no\nmore way; you know, it was difficult. I was going to school here, and so they were getting\nsome help from, uh, United Nations refugee organization, UNRRA. But we had relatives in\nIsrael, and they told them to come. So they went to Israel in 1954. And I became a citizen\nhere in 1955, and so I was able to then leave and go and visit them. But, uh, those were great\nefforts. And I tried to... You know, the x-ray pictures were sent to me; and I showed them to\ndoctors here, and they were all unanimous and said, \"No, this is obviously not an open\nprocess. And even if it were, so what? I mean, the man can be put into a hospital in under\nobservation.\" But they wouldn't let him in. This was part of a...at that time, of an effort to let\nas few Jews in as possible; which according to ...which is...which was true according to, uh,\nresearch that was done much later. I myself came under the displaced persons law, because I\ncame as a student. Even that was not easy, because for me to come to the United States I had\nto have a student visa. I couldn't get an immigrant's visa, because I...my...my number wasn't\nup. To get a student's visa, you have to have a national passport. So that if you commit a\ncrime, the United States can send you back. But I had no national passport. I had to renounce\nmy Yugoslav citizenship. I was stateless. How can you then get a student visa? So again, the\nItalians said, \"Well, we'll give you a statement that we will let you into Italy if the Americans\npush you out.\" And that should convince the Consul that he could give me the visa; which\nthey did.",
        "Q: So you came here. You went to school.",
        "A: I went to school in Illinois; and stayed one more year to get a Master's. I almost got it, but I\ndidn't quite get it. And then I went to New York from, uh, Illinois and started working.",
        "Q: As an engineer?",
        "A: As an engineer. And then got other degrees at night; which was for many years I got the\nMaster's, and so on. And then slowly thinking and rethinking all those events, I became more\nand more interested in--not only my past, but in this aspect of the...the rescue. The...the\nItalian story.",
        "Q: Thank you. It's quite a story. Ivo, I'd like to back up a minute. The island-hopping you did in\norder to get to Bari, from the camp to Bari. Can you describe it in a little more detail? Uh, we\ndon't uh... Did people take out sailboats? Did you do this at night? How was this done?",
        "A: This was mostly...mostly small motor boats and sail boats. Mostly. It's all I remember. There\nwere maybe five or six islands, when I was island-hopping, before the big one. I remember,\non one island we were so...we were tired. We somehow found our way to...to the local\nteachers--a married couple. They gave us their bedroom to use for that night. I don't know\nhow, because I was not involved. It was all, again, in the hands of, you know, my father.\nThere was always a leader in a group; because we were a part of a small group of people.\nAnd then there was another group and they came to the same island, and so you have a\ngroup, so to say, travelling. And the last big hop to the big island, where the British were,\nthere we had a big boat--70-ton fishing boat. And, uh, the sea was very bad, and there were\ntoo many of us. It was awful. What they did is, they left the older people in the hold; and us,\nthe younger ones, they lashed us with ropes on the...uh on the deck, so we wouldn't be\nwashed away by the waves. And the sea was mined; but the mines were much deeper than\nthis small boat, relatively small boat. Seventy tons is not very big. So we were also safe that\nway. And I actually, again, profited by that; because being out in fresh air, even though there\nwere waves and it was scary, but I didn't get so sick as the people down in the hold. But I\ndon't have any clear specific, you know, incident to relate.",
        "Q: And you have no sense of how this was organized, or how it was done?",
        "A: It was done... No, it was done on a day-by-day. There was no...that we would line\nsomewhere. So the man who, the local fisherman or someone, who brought us there would\nbe paid; and we...we tried to sleep somewhere on the ground, or some house or school. And\nthen, maybe, find somebody else. Again, we have some money or clothes. I remember, we\ngave some clothes. In fact, my Bar Mitzvah blue suit was given away, I think, on one of\nthese islands--as a contribution which was more important than money; because money\nreally didn't mean much at that rate. People, again, wanted clothes, gold, food and so on. But\nI don't have any specifics; recollections of an interesting incident.",
        "Q: When the British interned you, as it were, uh, again... How... You never, in fact, got taken to\nEgypt. You were...you were... what was that like? You were under the British control.",
        "A: We were in a camp.",
        "Q: What was that camp like? The British camp.",
        "A: We were housed in hotels and abandoned villas. We slept on the floor, stone floor. Uh, 1t was\ntypical refugee, refugee-type situation. You know, if you can imagine the Red Cross... When\npeople are evacuated--the disaster, you know, make-shift quarters. But we were fed. Uh, and\nI don't know how many people there were; but I think this was a pretty large camp. It wasn't\nonly Jews. In fact, mostly non-Jewish refugees from Yugoslavia. Uh, we heard--but we were\nnot told, we heard-- this is in rumors, that the camp was destined for El Saff. That was the\nplace somewhere outside Cairo. And I remember my father said, \"No. Not one more camp. If\nwe can get out of here, let's get out of here. Somehow we will be able to live in Italy.\"\nBecause uh again, this wasn't something that we knew, but we felt it's...it's possible. It will be\npossible to make a...to exist, rather than in the camp. Only proved to be true. But we had no\ncontact with the outside world. Although there was... I'm sure that many things were going\non; and Jewish organizations might have been active, the Italian-Jewish. I didn't know, I did\nnot know that. I was still a little dizzy. I was...\nEND OF VIDEOTAPE\n... Well, the main thought is that I'm glad now that, uh, that the Italian contribution to the\nrescue is now becoming known. Even though it involved few people, compared to the\ntremendous tragedy of the Jewish nation. Still, there were so few positive episodes 1n the\nHolocaust that this one had to be recorded, made known. And I'm glad now that I see that\nbooks are coming out and articles, research 1s being done; that this is finally, after 40 years,\nbecoming known.",

        "A: There was no Jewish quarter.",
        "A: There was no ghetto. There had never been any ghetto there. The Jews lived, uh, all over.\nUh, we lived downtown in my grandfather's house. My parents were born in Yugoslavia\nalready, but not my grandparents. The Jews of Zagreb were strongly Zionist. And as far as\nthe religious preference, they were...they practiced conservative Judaism. We were\nAshkenazi, as opposed to the Sephardic Jews of eastern Yugoslavia--in Serbia, in Bosnia[-\nHercegovina], in Montenegro. The total Jewish community of Yugoslavia before the war\nwas about 70,000. As I said, with very strong ties to Eretz Israel at that time.",
        "A: I have no brothers or sisters. And uh, I never met my, uh, grandparents, except one\ngrandmother. So it was just my parents and I. My father was, uh, an employee in an\ninsurance company. We were middle-class, comfortable. There were no signs of overt\nantisemitism there. There was antisemitism but 1t was kept more or less under the surface;\nand especially in the main part of Yugoslavia--in Serbia--there was no anti-semitism,\nbecause the Jews embraced the idea of Yugoslavia rather than separate nations. And so there\nwas no government-sponsored antisemitism. However, a Jew could not become a professor\nin the university, or get a government position or a high government position. This was\nunderstood. Unless you're baptized himself or herself. But otherwise, we were left alone.\nThere was inter-marriage, and there were friendships with the, uh, gentiles. It was quite a\ncomfortable life for the middle-class.",
        "A: I went to the Jewish elementary school. We had in those days four years of elementary\neducation which was sectarian. So I went to the Jewish elementary school and then it was\nfollowed by eight years of high school, of European high school. I only finished six, because\nthe war came. The Germans attacked when I was just finishing the sixth...uh, sixth year or\nsixth grade.",
        "A: This was a secular high school, which had a very strict, fixed curriculum embracing all fields\nof science, at least three languages, uh, including Latin. There was Latin, French and\nGerman were obligatory, besides Serbo-Croatian. Religion was taught in separate classes to\nthe Jews, the Catholics, the Moslems, the Orthodox, and so on. So religion was actually the\nmain subject; and if you didn't pass religion, you didn't pass that whole year. It was typical\nEuropean, the educational system. No mercy, no promotion--unless you really passed.",
        "A: Yes, I...] enjoyed it; because I... was lucky. I was a good student, so it wasn't too difficult for\nme. But this wasn't really a public education where everybody participated, like in the United\nStates. Most of the population did not participate in this type of high school. Uh, there was a\nhigh rate of illiteracy, and, uh, education was not at all wide-spread in Yugoslavia of those\ndays. So this was somewhat of an elite group that went to this type of high school.",
        "A: I really didn't encounter any incident, except in sometimes perhaps a remark, uh, by a teacher\nwho would meet us Jewish children going to our religion class, to another classroom. He\nwould say something. \"Here come the chosen people.\" It was sort of sarcastic, but 1t was...1t\nwas that sort of thing. Or, uh, if, uh, in the streets sometimes children would shout, \"Jew, go\nto Palestine,\" and so on. But I personally did not encounter any strong antisemitic, uh,\nincident. However, there was at least one group, and it's the main group. There was a\npolitical party, underground, a fascist party which was antisemitic. And they did write\ngraffiti and publish slogans, and so on. And they were the Croatian Nationalist Separatists,\nwho didn't want Yugoslavia at all. They wanted independent Croatia, Catholic Croatia; and\nthey were fiercely antisemitic. But they lived mostly in exile. In the inter-war years, they\nlived in Italy and Germany--which countries gave them asylum hoping that someday, as it\nhappened, they could bring them back into Yugoslavia and install them in this Croatian state,\nwhich would then be a satellite of the Axis powers. So there was always the underground;\nand it's a feeling of impending antisemitic, uh, doom. But in everyday life, it wasn't felt as\nmuch as it might have been in other parts of Europe.",
        "A: When the war broke out in 1939, Yugoslavia was neutral. And uh, in 1940 Italy attacked\nGreece, and could not achieve a victory there. Germany wanted Greece out of the way. In\nfact, Germany wanted the Balkans secured; because Germany planned to attack the Soviet\nUnion. The Germans pressured the Yugoslav government of the time to let German troops\ngo through Yugoslavia, so that they can then attack Greece. The Yugoslav government\nagreed, but there was a coup which overthrew that government. This was in Serbia. An anti-\nFascist, anti-Nazi coup; and they installed a new government which was openly anti-\nGerman. It was 1n defiance, direct defiance of Hitler. And in response to that, in April 1941,\nhe ordered that Yugoslavia be attacked. Germany and Italy and Hungary and Bulgaria all\nattacked Yugoslavia, and defeated its army 1n about fourteen days. And that Croatian state\nwas then established under the name the \"Independent State of Croatia.\" And the exiled\nnationalists, antisemites, came back to govern that state. They called themselves \"UstaSa.\"\nThat means, uh, \"Men of the Uprising.\" And immediately, within the first week, they began\nto introduce anti-Jewish legislation. Not only Jews, but also the Serbs. Orthodox Serbs were\nreally on their list of destruction. And Gypsies.",
        "A: The legislation was sweeping. The Jews, there was a curfew. The Jews had to wear a yellow,\nuh, piece of cloth on the shoulder and in the back with the, uh, word, with the initial for\n\"Jew\" in Yugoslav. They were, of course, thrown out of all jobs; and even out of apartments\nin a certain section of the city. They had to surrender cameras, radios, and so on. It was a\npreliminary, it was a set of measures to isolate the Jews and completely, uh, cow the Jewish\npopulation into numbness. Because it was very sudden. Almost upon arrival of these...of the\nUstaSa. And, selectively, they took certain groups--such as some lawyers--and executed\nthem as being Communists. And they began some deportations. There...those were times,\nthey were somewhat chaotic. I mean, it was a new state. There was chaos. The UstaSa were\nnot that organized. There was a struggle between the Germans and Italians, diplomatic\nstruggle, for the control of that state. And the Germans won that control. The Italians, who\nhad banked on that, lost even though the Italians also got a piece of Yugoslavia. In other\nwords, it is important to understand that after the victory over Yugoslavia, the Axis powers\ndismembered Yugoslavia. There was no more Yugoslavia as a state. There was the\nIndependent State of Croatia; Serbia was occupied by Germany; western Yugoslavia--that 1s,\nSlovenia--was divided between the Germans and Italians. And most important, for my story,\nthe Italians occupied that Adriatic coast of Yugoslavia and most of the islands. They also\nannexed part of that coast--the best part, the richest for tourism--Dalmatia, and made it part\nof Italy. So that was the situation. The Jews in Croatia [were] being slowly herded together,\nand taken to various camps. At one time, there were some thirteen or fourteen camps\noperating in Croatia. The Germans were not in these camps. This was all...they were all run\nby the UstaSa. The, uh, savagerity that was practiced in these camps was such that even the\nGermans were horrified. In their internal memoranda, they called it the \"Balkan bestiality.\"\nAt one point--I don't remember the exact date, in July that same year--a transport was being\nformed. In other words, again Jews were being arrested, to be transported to an island where\nthey all perished. I was arrested on a certain day. And I was then sixteen at the time. The\nagent detective who came to arrest me, the Croatian, had my name on his list and not my\nfather's name. This was unusual. And my father protested and said that it must be a mistake.\nHe wanted to substitute himself for me, saying that \"You probably mean me, and not my\nson.\" The detective insisted, \"No, it says Ivo Herzer and I have to take him.\" So my father\nsaid, \"Well, I'll come with you.\" Of course, he couldn't go into that transitory camp; and so I\nwas taken there. This was on the outskirts of the city of Zagreb, where fairs were held\nusually. And there were several hundred Jewish families with babies, complete families,\npushed against the wall. And machine guns--heavy machine guns--were manned by the\nUstaSa, aimed at this mass of Jews who were...we had to respond to a roll call about every\nhour. We didn't know at all what would happen. Now we know what happened to that\ntransport. As I said, they were taken to the island of Pag, P - A - G; and they all perished\nthere under horrible circumstances. I was just lucky; because during the evening roll call,\nwhen my name came up, the UstaSa officer in charge said, \"Are you here alone?\" Since they\nhad families. I said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Take your things and go home.\" Just like that. He\ncould have easily said, \"Bring his family.\" He didn't. Now this was past curfew time. I had\nno paper in my hand to prove that I had a right to be anywhere. And so I ran home; and I\nwasn't...no patrol found me. I was lucky. And my parents thought they had lost me already.\nAnd they couldn't believe their eyes when I just burst in upon them. It was then that my\nparents decided that we must do something. Try to escape. But escape where? The partisans\nwere not yet active. Yugoslavia was surrounded by countries that were already under\nGerman domination. How could we, ordinary middle-class people, escape? And then the\ndecision was made. Let us try to somehow escape to the Italian zone in Yugoslavia. Maybe\nthe Italians will let us in. Maybe they're not as bad as the Germans. Because we didn't really\nknow anything about Fascist Italy. Since the Jewish community in Zagreb was oriented\ntoward Austria and the German-speaking Europe, Italy was the place to go for a vacation\nmaybe. But the fundamental difference between Fascism and Nazism, as far as Jews were\nconcerned, was unknown to us. To us, this was a gamble. And my father obtained some sort\nof pass which could be gotten for some money. It was just a pass that said that we could be\nlet out of Croatia, but didn't guarantee any entry anywhere. With this pass, without the\nyellow signs--which was a great risk--we left in July 1941 by train for the border. We wanted\nto go actually to the city of Split--Spalato, in Italian--which then was in Dalmatia, which\nthen became Italy. And we thought if we reached that city somehow, as many Jews did, we\nwould be safe--provided the Italians don't turn us back. On the way to Spalato, however,\nsome troubles developed to the railroad. It seems that some guerillas must have blown up the\ntracks. The train was turned back; and we landed in a city which was the worst place to be.\nAnd this was the city of the Croatian Nationalists, where the UstaSa movement was born--the\ncity of Gospi_--in a desolate part of the country with curfews, patrols, and a concentration\ncamp for Jews just outside of Gosp1_. We didn't know that, but there it was. The three of us,\nplus perhaps six or seven other Jews whom we knew who tried to do the same thing, we\ncoalesced into a small group, milling around at the station and then trying to go into town.\nIt's a small town. On the way, we just knocked on a door--the first peasant house we saw.\nFortunately, this was a house owned by an old Serb woman. And the Serbs were, at that\ntime, again persecuted by the Croatians, just like the Jews. So she understood our plight. But\nshe was afraid of harboring us. She said she could keep us only for so many hours. We sat\nthere. We...we stayed in the house not knowing what to do. We couldn't go back to Zagreb.\nWe couldn't go forward. We had false documents. We were lost. To all intents and purposes,\nit seemed a completely impossible situation. But again, we were lucky in that there was an\nItalian garrison in that town--as there were Italian garrisons all over the region which was not\nfar from the sea, from the coast. At...we just ...we saw three Italian soldiers, or maybe four. I\nspoke a little Italian, almost nothing; and my father a little, because he took Italian in his high\nschool days. We just approached these soldiers, just on the wild chance that they might help\nus. And we told them two words: \"ebrei\"--which means Jews, [and] \"paura\"--fear. They\nimmediately understood, because they knew what was going on--as we now know. And they\ntold us to quickly go back to the house, \"calma\"--calm, and they would bring their sergeant.\nTheir sergeant came. He spoke some French, and uh, we...we knew French. It was easier to\ncommunicate. He said, \"Stay here. I'll see if I can get maybe a pass for you, to get you into\nItaly.\" And he left. We didn't believe him. We thought he just said nice things. How would\nhe, who 1s he, didn't want any money. He never knew us, but he came back. He said he\ncouldn't get a pass for us; but at midnight he will come with a few soldiers and he will put us\non an Italian military train. And there...and doing that would be enough to smuggle us into\nItaly proper. Again, we were quite skeptical. Why would he do that? But he did. And this\nwas unforgettable. Uh, at night Italian soldiers carrying our bags and rucksacks, marching\nus--protectively--to the railroad station with this sergeant, waiting for an Italian military\ntrain. When the train came, he told us to get in; and he himself boarded the train. Now, the\ntrain was full of Italian soldiers who immediately gave room to the...to my mother and other\nladies in the small group, offered us some food. And I think he just said, \"These are\nrefugees.\" And as soon as you heard the word...he said the word \"refugee\" to Italians, they\nimmediately...their hearts melted. Whether it was an Italian refugee or a Jewish refugee,\ndidn't matter. They didn't protest. After all, we were civilians. We had no right to be on that\ntrain at all. Then, at the border, there were difficulties. Now, I'm talking about the border\nwith Italy proper; because that whole scheme of getting to Split, in Dalmatia, had to be\nabandoned. He wanted us to go to the city of Flume [Croatian: Rijeka], from where we\ncould go Trieste--which was then Italy--and we would be safe. He got us across the border.\nThey didn't know what to do with us, so they put us into the Customs House. He went to the\nauthorities and said, \"Here are these refugees; they haven't had anything to eat or drink.\nThey've got to be given something.\" And some women's organization came, and they gave\nus orangeade and sandwiches to eat. And we stayed there almost a whole day. He left us,\nbecause he was assured by the authorities that we could stay. He shook hands with us and\nleft. We never knew his name. However, at night, we were surprised. The authorities really\ndid not allow us to stay. They put us back on a train and pushed us back into Croatia. We\npleaded with the, uh, Italian military police, the Carabinieri, to give us back our documents,\nsuch as they were, so the UstaSa would not see that we are being pushed back as Jews.\nMaybe that way we could escape, go back and try again. And the Carabinieri complied with\nour requests. So we made it back again, and we went all the way to Zagreb. We were totally\nexhausted. It was the most foolish thing to do, but we didn't really know what to do. And\nwhen we came to our apartment--this was only a few days later--it had already been taken. In\nthe meantime, they came to search for us, to arrest all of us. Not having found us, they gave\nthe apartment to a functionary of the UstaSa, who lived there. And the neighbors told us to\njust run away, because they were looking for us, as they were for other Jews. So we went\nagain, and tried the same thing again. This time we made it across the border.",
        "A: We got off the train just before the border. We went to a village--again at random--and\nknocked on a door. And a peasant woman opened up. We actually told her who we were,\nthat we were looking...we had money, we were looking for someone to smuggle us across\nthe border. We knew that near the border, there were always smugglers. That is, there was\nalways traffic from Italy into Yugoslavia and back; and that possibly the peasants would\nknow some secret path. And it was true. Uh, this, uh, woman knew some people who took us\nacross the border. We were not alone. We were also again in a group maybe of ten, twelve\npeople. Not just the three of us. This time we made it. And we lived in a town near Fiume,\u2019\nin Italy, for one month. Hiding. But the Italian police found us after one month. They\narrested my father and myself, kept us in for one night. The Police Commissioner was very\nembarrassed. And that was after the sergeant, the experience with the sergeant, which told us\nsomething about the Italians. Now the Commissioner of Police, when my father and I were\nbrought to his office, he got up and he shook hands with us and asked us to sit down. This\nwas not the Commissioner of Police that we expected to see. And he told us that he has no\npower to do anything, but he will leave our cell door open-- unlocked--as a symbol that we\nare not really prisoners. In the morning, we will be reunited with our wives and mothers.\nThere were other Jews in that same town. They were all picked up. And so there was a\nsizable group of us. We were being marched to a bus. And we thought, \"My God. Again\nthey're going to push us back into Croatia.\" But they didn't do it. By that time--and we know\nthis now--their policy has changed ...had changed. The policy of returning Jews or not letting\nthem stay lasted only in the very first weeks of the UstaSa regime. Once the Italians\ngrasped...understood what was going on with the Jews and the Serbs, and the Gypsies, they\ndid not push anybody anymore across the border. They engaged in intense activity as to\nwhat's to be done. But we have documents today that clearly show that neither the Governor\nof Dalmatia nor the Italian General [ Vittorio] Ambrosio 1n charge of the Second Army on\nthat territory had any intentions to return us into the UstaSa hands. So the bus took us to\nformer resort town of Cirquenizza--C-I-R-Q-U-E-N-I-Z-Z-A [Croatian: Crikvenica]--\nwhere, uh, we used to go for summer vacation, as many others. It was the headquarters of the\nFifth Corps. By that time there were some fifty or sixty, a small group of refugees. We\n' In an article published in Midstream in June/July 1983, Mr. Herzer identified this town as SuSak,\na suburb of Firume.\nsettled there and we had, of course, representatives. My father was one of the oldest among\nthe refugees. He spoke some Italian, so naturally he represented us. He went to the Major in\ncharge of civilian affairs. He received him as if he were a friend. He said, \"You are\nprotected, and you are under Italian protection. Give us your names, your addresses. The\nUstaSa, who have the civil authority, won't be able to do you any physical harm.\" As an\nexample, the UstaSa did not want to give us ration cards. The Italians forced them to give us\nration cards. The UstaSa said we have to wear those signs--again, yellow signs. The Italians\ntold us, \"Well, let them have that. We must give in on some point. But physically, they will\nnot be able to harm you, deport you, or put you in jail.\" Now, our numbers increased;\nbecause my experience roughly speaking was repeated in many cases. Between four and five\nthousand Croatian Jews--almost all that survived--found their way to the Italian occupation\nzone in Yugoslavia. Either to the zone--we were in a zone, not yet in Italy--or to the annexed\npart of Yugoslavia, which was much safer. There were no Croatians there at all. But we were\nsafe. All came and started a very extraordinary period in my life, because we developed\nclose relations with the Italian army. Italian officers started dating Jewish girls. Uh, the\nItalian major came to play bridge with my parents and another Jewish lady. He brought me\ndictionaries. They brought us food. Uh, there were two things that stand out. One, that two\nweeks roughly I think after our arrival in Crikvenica was Yom Kippur. And, uh, somehow\nthe Italian major--whose name was Cipolla--learned this high holiday was at hand. He called\nmy father, and told him that he had reserved a school room for the services. He abolished the\ncurfew; because this was a war zone, due to guerrilla activity. He abolished the, uh, the ban\non assembly which they had. You had to special permission if you had... As you normally\nhave to have, in areas of martial law. And so we actually could celebrate Yom Kippur. And\nhe sent a lieutenant as his representative, who gave a little speech. It was incredible.",
        "A: Yeah. This... (PAUSE) I don't think there were more than thirty, forty people there at the\ntime. The numbers increased, but this was very early. This was somewhere in October '41. It\nwas still early. October '41. It wasn't an elaborate service, but... And I don't even know and\nremember who held the services, who actually led; but there is always somebody you can\nfind, among thirty Jews, somebody who would be able to do it. We could read, after all,\nHebrew. We... somebody had, uh, the prayer books. And this was, of course, morally and\npsychologically, a tremendous boost. And shortly thereafter, we had another proof that they\nwent--the Italians--beyond accepting us, or receiving us, or protecting us; when they invited\nall of us to a performance given for the Italian troops by an Italian military group of\nentertainers. And they gave us the place of honor, the first row. And, uh, it was really, I must\nsay, uh, a...a moment that I can't forget. When, uh, we stood up. The Italian national anthem\nwas played. The anthem of an Axis power, of the closest ally of Germany. And here are\ntwenty, thirty Jews as their guests of honor. We couldn't understand it. It was just like a\ndream. This situation existed until November '42. Almost a year. We studied Italian. We felt\nsafe. We, of course, wrote furiously to those who survived the initial deportations to come to\nthe zone in...1n whatever way possible. The connections established with the Italian officers--\nthat is, the connections we establish with them--were very productive. Because these officers\nwere able to go, of course, anywhere in Croatia. Wherever they wanted to. And they would\ngo by trucks and cars; and bring the parents, bring the sisters and bring the relatives of the\nJews who were already in their zone.",
        "A: And they did that. They even used armored cars, in a fake exercise, military exercise; and\nthey did it at first on their own and spontaneously, without informing too much their very\nhigh authorities. So that the evidence is episodic, it's in anecdotes. But it is known that so\nmany, that today there is no question that this was... It started from the lower ranks of the\nArmy, just as our sergeant and many other such sergeants or lieutenants. But then it became\na policy. It... 1t received complete approval by the highest levels of the Army and the Italian\nForeign Ministry; which we, of course, did not know then. But we know today. Now, we\ncould guess that the pressure on Italians that the Germans and Croatians exercised for our\nextradition was enormous. What right do they have to protect Jews who are not Italian\ncitizens? Because we really had nothing whatsoever in common with Italy. And they fought\nback diplomatically until November '42, when they felt they have to do something--\notherwise, they would have to yield to the Germans or the Croatians. They decided to put all\nthe Jews in the Yugoslav zones under the occupation into a camp. Plus several hotels, those\nregions that were very far from the camp. Tell the Germans we are in a camp. Tell the\nGermans that a census 1s being taken to see if any... any one of us might have some claims to\nItalian citizenship, because Italian citizens were protected. Jewish are not, all the time, at the\ntime. There were even some Italian Jews living in Germany, and the Germans would not\ntouch them. So the Italians used that as a pretext. This was part of a plan, of a consciously\ndesigned plan by a so-called rescue committee headed by the highest officials of the Italian\nForeign Ministry--Pietromarchi, D'Aj eta,\u2019 Ducci, several other names, all known today, in\nthe Foreign Ministry*--decided that the Jews would not be turned over to the Germans\nanywhere the Italians had control of the territory. The Italian Army cooperated with this\nwhole-heartedly. In November '42, the Italians arrested all of us, put us on trucks, and we\nwere taken to this camp--still Croatian Yugoslav territory, but under Italian flag. We didn't\nknow again; we thought maybe this 1s just a stage before our being turned over to the\nCroatians. And, unfortunately, there were two people committed suicide; and the morale was\nvery low. And the Italian commander of...of the Second Army, which is a very high official,\nhe came personally to the camp to give us a speech to reassure us that we would be\n* Count Luca Pietromarchi was head of the Occupied Territories Department of the Italian Foreign\nMinistry.\n* Count Blasco Lanzo d'Ajeta was Bureau Chief under Foreign Minister Ciano.\n* Including Vittorio Castellani, who served as liaison officer between the Second Army and the\nForeign Ministry.\nprotected. \"As long as that flag flies there, nobody can touch the camp.\" And we were told\nthat we were free within the camp to organize ourselves; which we did. They gave us the\npossibility of having a school--elementary and high school--synagogue, social hall. Medical\nfacilities were 1n...1n the camp were primitive, but all serious cases--and there were many--\nwere taken outside the camp into the Italian military hospital. So that, while the camp itself\nwas an ex-Yugoslav, uh, military base for the cavalry--so that we really lived in stables--but\nit...conditions were harsh but quite tolerable. There was no physical threat. There was no\noutright hunger; even though the rations were quite small. But we had opportunity to buy\nfood, extra food. There were people with means who were allowed to contribute, and then\nsomeone would go to Italy and bring food. The Italian Jewish organizations helped us,\nbecause they were allowed to function under Mussolini. So that while we didn't have the\nideal nutrition, nobody really starved. After all, we did go to school. I studied English;\nbesides, many other people studied the chess. Our evenings were free, and it wasn't the worst\nway to spend your days in World War II. Without there, you had the storm of the Final\nSolution not so many miles away from us. To think today that there were one million\nchildren perished; and here, under the Italian flag, we studied Latin and history and the\nItalian language and philosophy... It's still incredible that it happened.",
        "A: No. My father owned a third of the house where we lived. Two sisters and my father, and we\nsold the house about two weeks before the Germans attacked. And so we had some capital.\nMy father was near 60, at the time; my mother, much younger. So there was no work. There\nwas only... In Cirquenizza, before we were in the camp, we lived from...from the money that\nwe got for the house. And in the camp, we had some extra money; but there was no work.\nEverybody had to do something only to maintain the camp. The main thing 1s that my...my\nrecollection is that there was no fear, because we didn't see any maltreatment, any\nmistreatment of anyone, any torture, any beating. I...because I went to school, I was detailed\nto the ...to clean, to the cleaning of the grounds--as were other students. But Italian soldiers\nalso had to work doing the same tasks. So I had a broom; and the Italian soldier had a broom.\nWe worked together. It was this kind of thing that it's hard to imagine. It was a concentration\ncamp, in that it was surrounded by barbed wire; but one where we did not want to leave. In\nthe country, there were people still--late arrivals--who petitioned the Italian authorities to\nsend them to the camp, because it was the only safe place to be--for Jews. (PAUSE) I was\nalso growing up, in a sense, in those years; because I was sixteen when the whole thing\nstarted in 19--at the end. I tried to continue living sort of as a goody-goody student; because\nit was tough to study Latin and so on under those circumstances. But as I say, the feeling of\nsecurity was such that it compensated for all the hardship. For example, we celebrated\nPassover 1943. I found a document where the Italian command approved celebration of\nPassover in the camp. But we had the camp commandant and the other officers as our guests;\nand they sat in the first row of the social hall, where there were chairs. We had musical\nentertainment. There were many people in the camp, of course, who could play musical\ninstruments. There were some singers. The Italians were starved for this; because they were\ngenerally...the officers were quite well educated. And here they had an opportunity to listen\nto Italian opera and Italian songs. And so, it wasn't really a relationship of captors to\ncaptured. It was quite close. Again, it would not have been a bad thing for us or anybody\nto...to...to live the war--as terrible as it was--in that way. Unfortunately, there were always\nother events pressing that rendered our situation precarious. 1943--just to give a quick\noverview, in January '43 was Stalingrad. Great reverse for the Germans. Not much later the\nloss of Africa, North Africa. The Italians realized that the Allies would invade Italy. The\nItalian army might be pulled back. And they started to worry what would they do with us.\nThey decided to then concentrate all the Jews, not just in the camp where we were--which\nwas one of about two thousand people--but there were also other smaller camps. Not really\ncamps: there were Jewish groups 1n hotels around the Dubrovnik in the south. To\nconcentrate all the Jews in one camp on the island of Arbe [Croatian: Rab]. This island was\nYugoslav island. It is still Yugoslavia today; but then it was annexed to Italy. To remove us\nfrom the Croatian authorities completely. They proceeded to do this in July 1943. And that\ncamp--again the numbers, they still... No one knows how many there were, because the\nItalians always quote ...quoted lower numbers to the Germans than the turnovers are the\nJews. Said no there were more of us; but I think it was something like three to four thousand\nin this one large camp in Arbe. July '43 was also the month when Mussolini fell; and\nSeptember 8th, Italy surrendered to the Allies. And that was the moment of the great danger\nfor us, because the Italians surrendered. The camp now was free. The Italian Army did not\nmanage to arrange for our transfer to Italy proper. The soldiers just threw away their\nweapons and left. We were free; but the Germans and the UstaSa were not so far. And that\nwas the moment of great danger for us. Fortunately, Tito's partisans took over that island for\na while. And in that interim period, most of the...by far, of the camp inmates either went to\nthe mountains, to the mainland; or, as we did, went south toward Anglo-American-occupied\nItaly. Some are trying to reach Italy in December on the Adriatic, which was pretty fool-\nhardy to...to try. But we did. Two hundred people could not make it. They were old and sick;\nand they were found by the Germans and taken to Auschwitz. But, as I said, the great\nmajority of us--almost three thousand-- survived, thanks to the Italian intervention and\nprotection in the years '41 to '43. Which they practiced in the south of France, and in Greece,\ntoo.\n(Technical Conversation)\nTAPE #2\n(Technical Conversation)",
        "A: Uh, very, very little. Very little.\n(PAUSE)\n(Technical conversation)",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We, we knew that the Allies had landed not only in Sicily, but also southern Italy. So that the\nline from Bari, the major city on the Adriatic coast, was already in Anglo-American hands.\nNow to get there, one had to go quite some distance--uh, island-hopping, so to say, because\nthere are many islands, in the midst of uncertainty. Who is on the next island? How is the\npopulation? Are they pro-German, pro-UstaSa, or what? Everywhere we went, we saw white\nflags. The poor people on those islands who suffered hunger anyway, they wanted to say\nthey surrendered to whoever comes. They're not going to fight. They were small islands, and\nI think that helped us. We didn't come as...we just came as a small group. And it's not clear to\nme how my parents and other, uh, grown-ups managed to arrange. I know it was money to\npay someone to take us in a small boat to the next island. The conditions were bad. It was\nDecember, and the Adriatic was not, uh, a very calm sea at that time. But this was also good,\nbecause German patrols didn't go out very much. So we managed to reach a large island of\nVis, V -I- S. On that island there were some British torpedo boats and Partisans; but at that\ntime, the Partisans were Stalinists. Did not allow any contact with the British, so that we\ncould not contact them. Fortunately, there were other refugees--not Jewish refugees, but just\nrefugees. People from...running away from the horrible conditions of the multiple civil wars\nwithin Yugoslavia. There were Quislings, the Partisans, the Chetniks and all the other groups\nfighting each other; and many people just couldn't stand it anymore. So that island was full\nof refugees. And all I can remember is that at one point all of us were picked up by a British\nship military ship. Actually, it was a passenger ship which they requisitioned. And it brought\nus to Bari. But the British would not let us off the ship in Bari. They directed us to Taranto,\nall the way in the south of Italy. And from there, we were taken to camps again. The British\nhad camps at the very heel of Italy. And so we landed again in camps. We were fed. We\nwere safe. And the fate that the British ordained for us was to transfer us to Egypt, to some\ncamps...tent camps outside Cairo. The problem is...was that we were then surrounded by\nrefugees; and among those refugees were also former UstaSa and elements. Because the war\nwas coming to a close; and those days people would then run simply and cross and defect\nfrom one side to the winning side. And we decided to get out of that camp in Italy now. And\nthat was possible. We had to sign some papers; and then by train came to Bari, Italy--which\nwas under the British Eighth Army. So that this was really then the liberation, in a sense, for\nme. We were then safe.",
        "A: In Bari, the British Army employed masses of refugees--and later also Italians, who were\nonly considered co-belligerents--for all kinds of duties, from menial to duties of translators. I\ngot a job within one week with the British Field Security as translator and typist; because I\nknew English by that time, having studied very hard 1n the Italian camp. I didn't know what\nit sounded like, but I still knew it. But by that time I knew Italian and Serb-Croatian and\nGerman; and there were always questions and documents and, uh, interrogations of...of\nprisoners. And it was chaotic, to say the least, also in that time. And they needed somebody\nto do it. So that was a job which then paid and gave us rations. It was very easy, in a way, it\nseemed, to make a living. My mother got a job. She worked for a British outfit called Toch-\nH (ph), which served tea and crumpets to the British officers and commissioned...non-\ncommissioned officers, too. So she got a job there because she knew English from before.\nAnd finally, my father even found employment in censorship. Uh, they had a vast\nCensorship Office; uh, and he would read all these letters. And sometimes letters by people\nthat he knew. And he would just say, \"Hello, here are my greetings,\" and \"Why are you\nwriting so much?,\" or whatever. Those were very good times. Now we were in Italy. Uh, all\nI thought of was to resume my life somehow. But as I say, there was, of course, physical\nsafety. And then the gratitude we felt toward the Italians, and the way the Italians even then\nreceived us. I, uh, studied for my high school, for Italian high school final exam--which is\nnot very easy. So I studied at night with a professor while I worked. And, uh, again, they ...1n\nthe test, the test they gave me, the oral test, they chose questions that they knew I would\nanswer with greater ease than some others. They didn't ask me obscure questions about\nItalian history, but something that they felt I could answer. So their attitude toward refugees\nare people in trouble carried through. Even though at that time, for example, there were great\ndifficulties with Yugoslavia; because Yugoslavia wanted Trieste. And we were... Yugoslavs\nwould have been enemies of Italy. And they never were very friendly, because the two\ncountries have always had a great deal of difficulty because of Dalmatia--coveted by Italy,\nand so on. And yet, on a personal level, I never experienced that. I spoke very good Italian,\nwhich helped; because if you speak Italian, the Italians generally will feel this is quite an\nhonor to them. Somebody took the trouble to study the language. So my difficulties were\nover. But I didn't yet quite realize how rare the Italian gesture was, because the full impact of\nthe Holocaust was not known. I'm talking now about 1944, '45. It wasn't known. It came out\ndifferently and slowly; and gradually, one realized what...what really happened. And what\ncould have happened to us.",
        "A: I stayed in Bari from January '44 'til 1946, somewhere '46.",
        "A: Lived in the middle of a city, in an apartment. The apartment was assigned to us by the\nBritish military authorities that assigned empty apartments to refugees. Because many\nItalians had fled. Fled the bombing; or many Fascists fled, thinking that they would be\npunished if caught. So there were many apartments free. So we lived there in this assigned\napartment. I'm sure the rent was almost zero. I worked, in the beginning; and this was\nenough to feed us, because I got rations plus money. And I then got another job. After the\njob with the Field Security, I got a job teaching English to Yugoslav partisans who were in\nhospitals all around Bari. So I worked for the British Council, which 1s like the Voice of\nAmerica. It is a similar organization. Uh, and they paid quite well. So I...we were able to\nreally be independent.",
        "A: Yes, I...I think we...we did. Because with two of us working, and then three of us working,\nsurely. Then came the end of the war; and then the British Council closed its doors, and I\nwent to Rome. Someone told me go the American Joint Distribution Committee. I went\nthere, and it was early in the formation of the Joint. I'm using the word \"Joint\" - it's the\nAmerican Joint Distribution. Was...and they said, \"Yes, you can. You'll work for us. If you\nknow these languages, fine.\" So I moved to Rome; and my parents then moved later, a little\nbit later. And I worked for the Joint Distribution Committee from '46 until '48. I was an\nadministrative secretary in the HaSharot Department. We dealt with the refugees of the, of\nthe Brichah, the...the Jewish survivors of the Holocaust who sought to go to Palestine--later\nIsrael. They reached Italy from Poland or Russia, from all the other camps; but before that,\nthey were housed in various places 1n Italy. And then they would generally secretly embark\nand hope not to be intercepted by the British and taken to Cyprus. Well, I worked in that\ndepartment, in an administrative capacity to somebody; and did translations and dictations\nand so on, visiting those HaSharot, listening to...to what they needed, their needs, their\nrequests, making out requisitions and so on. This was until 1948.",
        "A: The upper management came from the United States; and, uh, the, uh, middle management\nand support staff was all recruited from refugees. Not so much locally, not...not the Italians;\nbut refugees, uh, who came from various countries of Europe. The Yugoslavs were very\nnumerous, because obviously there were many Yugoslavs who found themselves in Italy.\nBut there were Poles, and Germans and Austrians, and so on. There was a very mixed staff.\nThe activities that had to deal with the actual illegal immigration were not known to me.\nThey...I mean, they...they kept it well hidden. I mean, I did not overtly have you know\nanything. I... only surmised that something was going on; when suddenly, two HaSharot\nwere closed and nobody was there. But it had to be done this way, because the British of\ncourse didn't just want to intercept the immigrants or potential immigrants at sea. But they\npressured the Italian government to use their police surveillance to prevent the embarkation\nof Jews bent on...on breaking the blockade to Palestine. So it had to be really kept very\nsecret. And I know it was because none...none of the co-workers that I remember knew\nanything about it. There were a few individuals, I remember, who were Sabras; and they\nwere, I think, in charge of that. And they did not have a clear job. It was never clear to me\nwhat they were doing; but they spoke perfect Hebrew, and they looked to me like the kind of\nguys who could and would organize and had no fear. Very decisive men, who could not only\nlead a meeting but also lead people at night through a mine field. That much I...I still\nremember; but I didn't have direct, any direct work. I didn't take part in that.(PAUSE) The\nquestion was for everyone, when the war ended, what do to, where to go. We didn't want to\ngo back to Yugoslavia--which was at that time not just Communist, but Stalinist Communist.\nAnd we just couldn't. Certainly my father would not go, and I would do whatever he said. At\nthat time, I wasn't on my own; and I never had any desire to go there. The question was\nPalestine or Israel on one hand, or the New World. But out of Europe. Many people wanted\nout, just out. And, uh, I received a Hillel B'nai B'rith scholarship 1n '48, which then decided.\nAnd the decision was made then for me, obviously, that I could go and study, make up the\nlost time. Because somehow, in the narrow vision, that's all I saw--that I lost these years, and\nI had to make them up. That was the main thing. Especially after the shock--which was a big\nshock to me--that now that I survived, I really couldn't go back. Because I always wanted to\ngo back. I mean, in my dreams or in my feelings and hopes, that if I survive, the war is over,\nwe're only a few miles from Zagreb, we will go back. And I'll find some friends; and, uh,\nsomehow you go back. I never thought of really leaving while I was under the Italian\ncontrol. But then afterwards, it became clear that there was no back, that there were no\nfriends. Because Croatia, that independent state of Croatia we talked about, the Ustasa\nCroatia, contained about thirty thousand Jews. But no more than, uh, fifteen percent\nsurvived. So really, even apart from the regime, there was no real going back.",
        "A: This was very hard. It was very, uh...in a way it was, to realize that you're 1n exile, in a sense.\nBecause it is, after all, we couldn't go back. We could have. But in 1948, when Tito broke\nwith Soviets and allowed the Jews to leave, practically all Yugoslav Jews left for Israel. Not\nall, but practically all. They just weren't happy there. But not because of any antisemitism,\nbut just the conditions. After all, the conditions were just the way they are today in Poland or\nEast Germany and so on.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: To the University of Illinois. I said I wanted to study engineering. And, uh, then they gave\nscholarship to quite a few individuals who had to prove that they knew English, and so on\nand so on, and finished high school. Which wasn't easy in Europe to achieve. But they\nchoose...they chose the school; and they sent me to the University of Illinois in 1948. And I,\nuh, studied electrical engineering, and I graduated in 1951 because I had some courses. I...I\nwent to University in Bari and took some engineering courses also. So they recognized that.\nAnd I went summers, and speeded up.",
        "A: No. That was probably the worst thing, uh, in our lives. That we were together during the\nwar, and could not really be together afterwards. Because they were...applied for, on a quota,\nfor a visa to get to the United States; and, uh, there was a spot on my father's lungs. And an\nAmerican doctor said this is TB. And from that moment on--no matter what other doctors\nsaid or what other tests were conducted showing that it's a dead process, not an active\nprocess, because my father was a heavy smoker--that original decision could not be\nrescinded. But my mother was forced to come here so she would not loose her place. She\ncame in 1949 to the United States. Had to leave him there. In 1949, he was already 66 years\nold; and he could never get this entry visa, even though later on he came as a visitor. My\nmother went there from back to Italy. By that time, they had no more money. They had no\nmore way; you know, it was difficult. I was going to school here, and so they were getting\nsome help from, uh, United Nations refugee organization, UNRRA. But we had relatives in\nIsrael, and they told them to come. So they went to Israel in 1954. And I became a citizen\nhere in 1955, and so I was able to then leave and go and visit them. But, uh, those were great\nefforts. And I tried to... You know, the x-ray pictures were sent to me; and I showed them to\ndoctors here, and they were all unanimous and said, \"No, this is obviously not an open\nprocess. And even if it were, so what? I mean, the man can be put into a hospital in under\nobservation.\" But they wouldn't let him in. This was part of a...at that time, of an effort to let\nas few Jews in as possible; which according to ...which is...which was true according to, uh,\nresearch that was done much later. I myself came under the displaced persons law, because I\ncame as a student. Even that was not easy, because for me to come to the United States I had\nto have a student visa. I couldn't get an immigrant's visa, because I...my...my number wasn't\nup. To get a student's visa, you have to have a national passport. So that if you commit a\ncrime, the United States can send you back. But I had no national passport. I had to renounce\nmy Yugoslav citizenship. I was stateless. How can you then get a student visa? So again, the\nItalians said, \"Well, we'll give you a statement that we will let you into Italy if the Americans\npush you out.\" And that should convince the Consul that he could give me the visa; which\nthey did.",
        "A: I went to school in Illinois; and stayed one more year to get a Master's. I almost got it, but I\ndidn't quite get it. And then I went to New York from, uh, Illinois and started working.",
        "A: As an engineer. And then got other degrees at night; which was for many years I got the\nMaster's, and so on. And then slowly thinking and rethinking all those events, I became more\nand more interested in--not only my past, but in this aspect of the...the rescue. The...the\nItalian story.",
        "A: This was mostly...mostly small motor boats and sail boats. Mostly. It's all I remember. There\nwere maybe five or six islands, when I was island-hopping, before the big one. I remember,\non one island we were so...we were tired. We somehow found our way to...to the local\nteachers--a married couple. They gave us their bedroom to use for that night. I don't know\nhow, because I was not involved. It was all, again, in the hands of, you know, my father.\nThere was always a leader in a group; because we were a part of a small group of people.\nAnd then there was another group and they came to the same island, and so you have a\ngroup, so to say, travelling. And the last big hop to the big island, where the British were,\nthere we had a big boat--70-ton fishing boat. And, uh, the sea was very bad, and there were\ntoo many of us. It was awful. What they did is, they left the older people in the hold; and us,\nthe younger ones, they lashed us with ropes on the...uh on the deck, so we wouldn't be\nwashed away by the waves. And the sea was mined; but the mines were much deeper than\nthis small boat, relatively small boat. Seventy tons is not very big. So we were also safe that\nway. And I actually, again, profited by that; because being out in fresh air, even though there\nwere waves and it was scary, but I didn't get so sick as the people down in the hold. But I\ndon't have any clear specific, you know, incident to relate.",
        "A: It was done... No, it was done on a day-by-day. There was no...that we would line\nsomewhere. So the man who, the local fisherman or someone, who brought us there would\nbe paid; and we...we tried to sleep somewhere on the ground, or some house or school. And\nthen, maybe, find somebody else. Again, we have some money or clothes. I remember, we\ngave some clothes. In fact, my Bar Mitzvah blue suit was given away, I think, on one of\nthese islands--as a contribution which was more important than money; because money\nreally didn't mean much at that rate. People, again, wanted clothes, gold, food and so on. But\nI don't have any specifics; recollections of an interesting incident.",
        "A: We were in a camp.",
        "A: We were housed in hotels and abandoned villas. We slept on the floor, stone floor. Uh, 1t was\ntypical refugee, refugee-type situation. You know, if you can imagine the Red Cross... When\npeople are evacuated--the disaster, you know, make-shift quarters. But we were fed. Uh, and\nI don't know how many people there were; but I think this was a pretty large camp. It wasn't\nonly Jews. In fact, mostly non-Jewish refugees from Yugoslavia. Uh, we heard--but we were\nnot told, we heard-- this is in rumors, that the camp was destined for El Saff. That was the\nplace somewhere outside Cairo. And I remember my father said, \"No. Not one more camp. If\nwe can get out of here, let's get out of here. Somehow we will be able to live in Italy.\"\nBecause uh again, this wasn't something that we knew, but we felt it's...it's possible. It will be\npossible to make a...to exist, rather than in the camp. Only proved to be true. But we had no\ncontact with the outside world. Although there was... I'm sure that many things were going\non; and Jewish organizations might have been active, the Italian-Jewish. I didn't know, I did\nnot know that. I was still a little dizzy. I was...\nEND OF VIDEOTAPE\n... Well, the main thought is that I'm glad now that, uh, that the Italian contribution to the\nrescue is now becoming known. Even though it involved few people, compared to the\ntremendous tragedy of the Jewish nation. Still, there were so few positive episodes 1n the\nHolocaust that this one had to be recorded, made known. And I'm glad now that I see that\nbooks are coming out and articles, research 1s being done; that this is finally, after 40 years,\nbecoming known.",
