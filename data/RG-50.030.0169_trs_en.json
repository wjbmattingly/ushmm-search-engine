        "Question: Would you tell me your name please?",
        "Answer: My name is Judah Nadich.",
        "Question: OK. And where and when were you born?",
        "Answer: I was born in the city of Baltimore on May 13, 1912.",
        "Question: And what was your uh position, please?",
        "Answer: I'm, what positions I had uh (as a rabbi) as a rabbi? I, my first pulpit was in uh the city\nof Buffalo, New York, Temple Beth David. From there I went to Chicago where I was co-rabbi\nwith the distinguished Rabbi Solomon Goldman at the Synagogue. Uh in Chicago I\nenlisted in the Army. After the war I worked briefly for the JDC and the UJA, about a year and a\nhalf. And then resuming my rabbinic career, I went to uh Israel in Brookline where I\nserved for ten years, and then I came to New York, where I was rabbi of the Park Avenue\nSynagogue from 1957 to 1987.",
        "Question: Thank you. Let's go back a little bit...",
        "Answer: Incidentally, I want to tell you I wasn't fired in 1987. I retired.",
        "Question: OK. (laughter). That's just fine. Uh tell me a little bit, where did you go to school?\nWhere, how did you, how did you get into the rabbi ?",
        "Answer: Well, when I was fourteen years old I received a scholarship from the Baltimore\nTorah where I had been studying to take me to the Yeshiva in New York, then on the\nLower East Side. Subsequently it came to be known as Yeshiva University. I was in the student\nbody when we moved uptown to Washington Heights, where the Yeshiva University is presently\nlocated. I studied in the Yeshiva for five and a half years, graduating first from its high school.\nLater going to uh the College of the City of New York, at night and to Johns Hopkins during the\nsummers and after uh studying at the Yeshiva for a period of five and a half years, I have been\ngraduated also from college, I entered the Jewish Theological Seminary of America where I was\nordained a rabbi in 1936, and at the same time that I went to the Seminary I went to Columbia.\nGot my Master's in the Department of History, studying under Baron (ph) and in 1936 I\ngot my Master's Degree from Columbia as well. Subsequently I earned uh a Doctorate of uh\nHebrew Literature\nfrom the Seminary and a Doctor of Divinity ;",
        "Question: Thank you. Uh, as a young man, as a young rabbi, uh what were the circumstances\nthat brought you into the Army?",
        "Answer: Ah, well, uh I was uh serving as a rabbi in Chicago at the time of Pearl Harbor. And I\nrecall listening to the radio on December the 7th, 1941, and hearing that the Japanese had\nbombed Pearl Harbor, and I knew instinctively that I wanted to be a part of what was going to\nhappen. We had been reading in the press uh about Kristallnacht some time before, not too long\nbefore, and we knew that uh there, there was some kind of persecution against the Jews under\nthe, the Nazis, so I felt sure, that I wanted to enlist as a chaplain. And enlist I did not long, after\nPearl Harbor, and I was uh admitted to the Army in Chicago and ordered to report at uh Fort\nBragg in North Carolina on uh May the 2nd, 1942.",
        "Question: OK. Tell me about those first weeks at Fort Bragg.",
        "Answer: Well, they were I suppose I should say difficult weeks for a person who had never\nknown anything about the military. My father hadn't even allowed me to be a Boy Scout\nbecause he was afraid I might like, I might like military things and uh get to like to wearing a\nuniform and marching. Uh my father you can see was uh a pacifist and indeed uh he was more\nthan that. He was a member of the , and that was the first Jewish school that I\nwent to at the age of four, the Schula (ph). Uh but uh those first days and weeks at uh\nFort Bragg were days of learning. Uh learning a totally new world. And so, for example, the\nvery first day that I arrived, I knew that I was supposed to report to the Commanding General. I\nwent to his office, knocked on the door. I hear a \"come in\". I walked in and not knowing that I\nshould do anything differently, I walked up to his desk where he was seated, and uh put out my\nhand to shake hands with him. And uh he looked at me with a smile on his face, and uh he was a\nvery kind and compassionate man he said chaplain, we don't do things that way in the Army.\nNow what you will do is you go out, come back in again. As soon as you're inside the door, you\ncome to attention and salute, and say, Chaplain Nadich reporting for duty, sir. I uh was shame-\nfaced, but I walked out of the room, knocked on the door again, came back into the room, did\nexactly as he had told me, and from that point on, he took me in hand. He uh got hold of a young\nofficer and told him to spend the next day with me, to teach me about military courtesy, the\ncourtesies of the service, and how to march in a military parade, for the very next day I was to\nmarch in a military parade behind the commanding general as a member of his staff. Well, I,\nfortunately I learned quickly and so uh it wasn't long before I was a regular member of the Army.",
        "Question: What were the circumstances that uh sent you overseas?",
        "Answer: Ah. I was at Fort Bragg for only seventy days, when I received orders to report to Fort\nHamilton, Brooklyn, New York, for overseas shipment to Army Post Office, APO 887. I quickly\nascertained that APO 887 was London. And I was rather pleased to go to that part of the world.\nI proceeded to Fort uh Hamilton in Brooklyn and after waiting for ten days, I was shipped by uh\nbya\nuh Dutch freighter which was a part of a convoy of 55 ships and after sailing 24 days on the high\nseas, uh the convoy reached Liverpool. I learned afterwards, incidentally, that uh another\nchaplain who had far more experience than I, who had been in the Army Reserve in peace time,\nuh was first asked to go and he thought better of it. He declined and I was tapped as the next\nman, and I was glad to go.",
        "Question: So you landed...",
        "Answer: We landed in Liverpool. I reported as I had been instructed to do at Cheltham (ph)\nwhich was our service of supply headquarters, and after a day or two in Cheltham and going\nthrough the uh routine, the red tape, I was assigned to the northern, the northern Ireland Bay\nSection which was located just outside the city of Belfast. The reason for my being sent there,\nsince I was the first Jewish chaplain ordered to the European theater, was because our first\nAmerican troops were stationed in Northern Ireland, and an armored headquarters, a corps\nheadquarters, and uh two infantry divisions, and I immediately began visiting every camp, every\nmilitary camp to search out Jewish soldiers and officers, and to arrange for services and for\nwhatever, whatever other service I could render to the soldiers of Jewish faith.",
        "Question: You had told me at lunch something about the particular way in which you solved a\nburial...",
        "Answer: Oh yes, oh yes. As a matter of fact the immediate reason for the uh request by General\nEisenhower for a, an American Army Jewish chaplain to be dispatched immediately to the\nEuropean theater, was because there was some kind of a problem that could have become a uh\ncause-c\u00e9lebre. Uh a Jewish soldier had had been killed in a uh motor, Army motor motor vehicle\naccident and since there was no American Army Jewish chaplain at the time, the uh rabbi in\nBelfast, Rabbi , was asked whether he would officiate at the funeral service, the burial\nservice for this Jewish soldier. And he was very quick to respond of course he would be pleased\nto oblige, but he said that he would insist that this Jewish soldier be buried in a Jewish cemetery\nas 1s provided for by Jewish law, and he even offered to provide a grave in the cemetery of his\ncongregation in Belfast. The Army authorities told him that according to Army regulations,\nevery American Army soldier overseas who would have to be buried in a foreign, in foreign soil,\nwould have to be buried in an American Army, a military cemetery because after the war would\nbe over, the remains of these soldiers, at the request of their families, would be returned to the\nUnited States, would be returned home. The Irish rabbi said that he, he could not officiate under\nthose circumstances, and since the military were concerned for the feelings and the good opinion\nof the civilian population, uh the American military authorities saw the need immediately for a,\nan American Army Jewish chaplain. Hence the request for such a chaplain and therefore I was\ndispatched.",
        "Question: . How long were you in Ireland?",
        "Answer: Uh I was in Ireland for approximately, well say August to November, and uh I I was uh\nordered from Ireland to England uh when uh I appeared at the various camps one uh fine\nmorning to visit the troops, and to my amazement the camps were empty. I did not know where\nthe troops had gone, but later I learned they had been shipped of course secretly for the invasion\nof North Africa. Soon after that I was ordered to England and since I was still the only free, that\nis non-assigned to a division, Jewish chaplain, I was ordered to the American Military Cemetery\nat Brookwood in Surry, not far from London, and I was uh stationed with the American\ndetachment uh who took care of burials at their uh quarters in the town of Wilking (ph). We\nactually occupied a a small inn in Wilking. At the cemetery I would officiate at all Jewish\nfunerals on Mondays and Thursdays. The other days of the week, I would get a military vehicle\nand a driver from southern base headquarters in Salisbury, and cover one slice of England. I had\ncarved up England into various slices so that I would be able to visit each area once a month. In\neach Army headquarters or hospital, I would find a Jewish officer or non-commissioned officer\nor private who would know how to conduct a Jewish service, give him prayer books and other\nreligious supplies, have him conduct the services each week, but I would show up once a month\nto uh be of help, to conduct a monthly service, and to help with any problems that might arise.\nAs more Jewish chaplains arrived in the United Kingdom, I would assign them to take parts of\nEngland or, and Scotland, and thus my own territory would be decreased as time went on. But I\nwent as far as Glasgow and again to Belfast, and in all parts of England and to some parts of\nWales.",
        "Question: How long did this go on?",
        "Answer: Uh this uh continued for about a year while I was stationed in Surry, near London, and\nthen for the second year I was stationed in London proper uh at American Army Headquarters uh\nin London uh at uh at or near Grosvenor (ph) Square.",
        "Question: And what did you do from ?",
        "Answer: And there I was uh a chaplain in the office of the theater chaplain, who was a Roman\nCatholic monsignor, . His deputy was an Episcopalian chaplain, Edwin Carter,\nJr., uh known familiarly as Nick Carter, and I was the uh the one Jewish chaplain at theater\nheadquarters, and I was given the assignment of uh G3 \u00a9 that is I was in charge of all religious\nsupplies there and later on in France.",
        "Question: What did it mean to be in charge of religious supplies? What are some of the things\nyou had to do?",
        "Answer: Uh well uh I recall particularly in France where my job was more difficult, uh that I\nhad to uh obtain for Catholic chaplains, mass kits for example, and uh hymnals, and hymnals as\nwell for Protestant chaplains. Uh I had to uh visit uh vineyards (ph) who had been approved by\nthe local French Catholic bishop, uh that is whose wine was approved for, for use in mass, and I\nwould uh taste the various wines to make sure that I got a good tasting wine for my friends who\nwere uh Catholic chaplains, and I would uh buy the uh the wines for Catholic mass, and I\nsupplied\nuh Protestant and Catholic chaplains and Jewish chaplains with all of their needs. Even going so\nfar as to supply New Testaments in German for German prisoners of war. That I got a special\nkick out of, that a rabbi should be supplying German prisoners of war with New Testaments in\nGerman.",
        "Question: OK. How did you get from England to Paris? What were the circumstances?",
        "Answer: Well, from England to Paris, uh I was uh flown over in a small plane together with a\nnumber of other officers, and we landed on an air strip in Normandy. The uh German troops and\nuh I told you were not that far away, and indeed as our plane landed on the air strip in Normandy\nuh Ger...German artillery began shelling the air strip. We were asked to uh leave the plane as\nquickly as possible and to run for cover, and uh of course I followed orders very quickly. And\nuh in the process I lost a brand new officer's trench coat that I had just purchased in London\nbefore departure for France.",
        "Question: You took up duties in Paris. What was your role in Paris? What was your title and\nwhat was your role?",
        "Answer: Ah, in in Paris I was uh, my title was Deputy to the Theater Chaplain. Not the senior\ndeputy. That was still Nick Carter. But I was deputy to the senior chaplain in the theater to the\ntheater chaplain, Father Terrnand (ph) for Jewish affairs, so that when a new Jewish chaplain\nwould arrive from the States, I was to assign him to his new location. Uh I was still uh G3,\ndistributing religious supplies, and I was a Jewish chaplain at that time, in the beginning the only\nJewish chaplain uh in the area, and of course we moved uh after the breakthrough at St. Lowe\n(ph) we moved into Paris as Paris was captured. In Paris I first met with the the survivors in\nParis. Uh and uh my position there was to be of immediate help to the survivors because for\nmost of them I was the first contact they had with the Jewish community outside. And I was a\nsignal to them that uh the American Jewish community was there, at least in the person of this\none rabbi, this one chaplain.",
        "Question: Can you describe it? Describe your first meeting with a, with the group of survivors?",
        "Answer: Uh, my first meeting with the survivors happened in a rather interesting way. I uh took\na jeep and drove to the area where I had been told Jews had been living, the area known as the\n, the little place. And I flew my Jewish chaplain's flag from the jeep. Uh you may\nknow that the uh Jewish chaplain's flag consisted of a dark blue background, and in the center\nthere was the Jewish chaplain's insignia, consisting of the Ten Commandments, the two tablets\nof the Ten Commandments. Above the tablets, uh the uh six-pointed Star of David. It didn't\ntake long before some people came out and recognized, of course, the Jewish symbols, and\nbegan to talk to me. And they noticed on the lapels of my Army uh uniform the same insignia.\nAnd they began to ask me who I was, what was I doing there. It didn't take long before a crowd\nhad assembled. And some of them thought I should talk to a small committee of Jewish leaders\nthat had already been created to be of help to the Jewish survivors of Paris. Now where did these\nJews come from who had survived the German occupation of Paris? Most of them had fled\nduring the German occupation, or just prior to it, to the south of France where the Italians were\nin charge. The south of France was under Italian occupation. The Italians were never as rigid or\nsevere in their governance of their territory as were the Germans. And so it was easier for a Jew\nto hide himself in the south of France, in the area under Italian orders. And so when the war was\nover and Paris was liberated, very quickly these Jews came back out of hiding from the south of\nFrance. There were a few who had indeed been hidden in Paris itself. And who had\nmiraculously survived. Now I was brought to this committee that was meeting uh in a house that\nthey had taken over as a Jewish community headquarters. And they uh spoke to me uh and told\nme of their problems and their needs. And among other things they quickly gave to me uh a\nbatch of uh the yellow star that the Jews of France had to wear, on which of course was the\nFrench word , Jew. And uh I brought those yellow stars back to America. Uh but uh\nthey told me that their immediate need was to open a soup kitchen or soup kitchens, uh that food\nwas in short supply. They also would like to open they told me a free loan society. Uh I\ncommunicated with uh the uh Joint Distribution Committee in New York, through military\nchannels, and I was cabled from the JDC but through the Jewish Welfare Board which was the\nonly organization set up to deal with American Army Jewish chaplains. Through the JWB I\nreceived $10,000 from the JDC. That $10,000 was used by this committee of Jews in France to\nopen the first soup kitchens in Paris and to start the first Jewish free loan society that would\nenable uh small Jewish shop keepers and artisans to start up work again. Uh that uh didn't end\nmy uh relationship with the Jews who had survived. I met with the committee very often, until\nthe JDC opened its own headquarters on the Rue de in Paris uh but throughout my year\nin Paris, every morning virtually, there were as many as thirty to thirty-five Jews, Parisian Jews\nor French Jews, who found themselves in Paris, who lined up in the hall outside of my Army\noffice at the Hotel Majestique which was American Army headquarters in Paris. Each one of\nwhom had his own story that he wanted to tell me, to communi...communicate with relatives,\nparticularly relatives in America, to try to find relatives or problems of all kinds.",
        "Question: You told me about a very special service that you conducted (ah, yes) in Paris. Let's\ntalk about that.",
        "Answer: Yes. One of the most thrilling experiences I had in Paris during that year was to uh\nplay a part in the first service that was held after the liberation of Paris in what is called the\nRothchild Synagogue on uh uh Rue de la Victoire (ph). Uh it's formal title is really the, La\nGrande Synagogue and that synagogue was packed with French Jews, many of whom were\nwomen wearing black. And with American Army soldiers, most of whom were still wearing\nbattle dress, their helmets on their heads, battle uniforms, their guns left in the lobby of the\nsynagogue. And I had the great privilege of uh preaching in French and speaking afterwards in\nEnglish and I remember to this day that as I would come to the end of a sentence or the end of a\nparagraph as I was speaking, and as I paused to draw my breath, I could hear the gentle sobbing,\nparticularly of women in the congregation. My French address, my English address, each was\npunctuated by the crying of people in the congregation, and it was an experience that I shall\nnever forget. They were crying for those who would never return to Paris, those who had been\nkilled by the Nazis. They were crying for all that they had lost during the years of the German\noccupation of France. That was a very moving service. Nobody who attended it will ever forget\nit.\n(SHORT PAUSE)",
        "Question: Somewhere after, while you were still in Paris, I believe you were ordered to go to a\ncere...a ceremony\u201d?",
        "Answer: Oh yes. Uh I was ordered to appear as the representative of General Eisenhower at a\nceremony for French martyrs who had been killed by the Nazis and who had been buried in a\nmass grave in a French cemetery just outside of Paris. Uh General DeGaulle was to be the\nprinciple speaker but General Eisenhower had been asked to send a representative and the order\nhad come to the theater chaplain to dispatch a chaplain who could speak French. So I was told to\ngo. And I went. And there was quite a crowd there and we were ready to start the ceremony\nwhen suddenly there was a tremendous noise of bullets and artillery shells flying around us, past\nus in all directions, and there was a great deal of screaming of course. Everybody there was\ncertain that the Germans who at that time were not too far away from Paris, that the Germans\nmust have returned. That they were surrounding the cemetery. That their target was General\nDeGaulle, and incidentally anybody else who was there. And therefore all of the shooting. And\nI quickly dodged behind a tall monument, and a little bo...little French boy ran past me. I grabbed\nhim and pulled him down beside me. He had become separated from his mother. He was\ncrying, and I held him near me all throughout the uh shooting. When it suddenly got quiet again,\nall of us left the cemetery quickly. It was only the next day that I learned through the French\npress that what had happened was that on the railroad tracks just outside the cemetery, the\nGermans had left two carloads of ammunition, shells, bullets of all description, and spontaneous\ncombustion had started this tremendous racket of all the bullets and shells being fired and uh we\nwere just very fortunate that uh we weren't killed. I never got to give my uh carefully prepared\ntalk in French.",
        "Question: What else were you doing in Paris at that time?",
        "Answer: Oh, uh I must tell you of something in which I took great pleasure. I, I mentioned\nearlier that I was in charge of all religious supplies for the American Army on the continent of\nEurope. And months before Passover I realized that we would need matzo (ph) for the American\nJewish troops. And when I went to the Quartermaster General he informed me of course as ...\nEND OF TAPE\n..that but that uh if I could locate a matzoth factory in England I could order as much matzo as I\nwanted, that it would be charged on reverse-lend-lease, and he added since the British are not\ngoing to pay us in total (ph) anyhow, order as much matzo as you want. We'll charge it to\nreverse-lend-lease and the British will pay for it. I took him at his word. I gave that English\nmatzo factory that I had discovered the largest order it had ever received. When the matzo came\nsailing across the Channel to Paris to me, it filled an entire liberty ship, which rode high in the\nwaters of the English Channel and the matzo was delivered to Paris. I distributed it to all of the\nJewish chaplains then serving with the American Army for further distribution to American\nJewish troops, for the various Passover that would be held. Incidentally I held my\nPassover Seder for six thousand troops in the Lido in Paris, on the Champs d'Elysee, the largest\nnightclub in Paris, an odd place to have a seder but it worked out very well. No nightclub acts\nbut a seder each night for three thousand soldiers, three thousand the first night, three thousand\nthe second night of Passover. But I had a great deal of matzo left over, so I distributed it first to\nthe Jews of Paris and I gave matzo to the Jewish chaplains with the free French troops, the free\nCzech soldiers, the free Polish Army, and distributed the rest of the matzo to Jewish civilians in\nFrance and Belgium because food, bread in part...1n particular, was not easy to purchase. It\ncouldn't be found in in any great measure, and matzo could be eaten not only during the eight\ndays of Passover of course, but throughout the year. So that was my big order of matzo, and its\ndistribution. Further when came and there was a need for and for\npalm branches used during the festival services of the Feast of Tabernacles, again the\nQuartermaster General obliged me by arranging to have it on reverse-lend-lease and the British\nagain paid for it. And the uh and were purchased in what was then Palestine,\nflown to Egypt, an..by British planes, flown from Egypt to Paris, once again by British planes,\nand I had enough to distribute to all parts of the American Army wherever troops were located.\n(SHORT PAUSE)",
        "Question: OK. You were in France for quite a while.",
        "Answer: I was in France for a year. (Um-hum) And I traveled incidentally to uh all parts of\nnorthern France, Belgium, and eastern France to meet with the Jewish chaplains, particularly\nthose serving with the uh front line infantry and armored force divisions.",
        "Question: What did you see as you traveled in the way of survivors, Jewish survivors, in France?",
        "Answer: Well, uh interestingly enough, in a number of French communities, small groups of\nJews returned and the American Army Jewish chaplains did an extraordinary piece of work in\nhelping them. Uh I think of Chaplain, the late Chaplain Isaac Kline (ph) in and many\nJewish chaplains in various Jewish commun...in various Jewish communities in France who first\nbrought the returning Jews the necessities of life-food, medical supplies, medical treatment\nthrough Army medical officers and the where-with-all, the necessities for daily living and then\nhelped reconstruct the communities. Uh these Jewish chaplains would write back to their home\ncommunities, to their home synagogue and ask the members of their synagogues to collect\nclothing and children's toys and soap and various other items that would be needed by uh the\nbeginnings of Jewish communities\nin different parts of France and Belgium. And the communities responded generously.\nHundreds of packages would arrive for a single Jewish chaplain. And he would distribute the\ncontents to the Jews in the community where he was. And Jewish chaplains went further. They\nhelped rebuild synagogues and Jewish community centers so that Jewish communal life began\nonce again in these communities, albeit with far fewer Jews than had been there before. This I\nwitnessed as I traveled through various parts of especially of northern and eastern France and\nBelgium.",
        "Question: Was it at this time that you first met up with representatives of the Brichah (ph)?",
        "Answer: Ah, I'm glad you asked that question. Uh I first met with the representatives of the\nBrichah when I was still stationed in Paris. And I was approached one day by one of them who\ncame to my office at the American Army Headquarters, the Hotel Majestique, and who told me\nuh that he was involved with some other Jews from Palestine in helping to bring Jewish\nsurvivors to ports in southern France. He told me that other comrades of his were working\nelsewhere to bring Jewish survivors to ports in southern Italy. From these French and Italian\nports, the plan was that these survivors would board ships and would be brought to the coast of\nPalestine. Now this was prohibited by the British who were still in control of Palestine, and so\nthese ships were called illegal ships. This was called quote \"illegal immigration\" unquote, uh but\nthese men and women were working to save Jewish lives. This particular man who came to my\noffice in Paris told me that a group of a few hundred, he mentioned possibly as many as eight\nhundred, would be moved soon from a southern French port. Could I possibly help with getting\nfood supplies because even had they the money, it would have been very difficult to buy food in\nFrance at that particular time in history. So I said I would inquire and find out what I could. At\nthe Officers\u2019 Mess that evening, I spoke to an officer who was working at uh the Quartermaster\nGeneral's office. I asked him if he could help me. He said as a matter of fact uh there was a\nlarge supply that filled several warehouses in Paris of prisoner of war parcels that had been sent\nfrom the United States during the war that were to be shipped to Switzerland. From there the\nInternational Red Cross would send them to American prisoners of war in Germany. Now these\nparcels were full of food of high quality and they, they were particularly chosen kinds of food for\nthe nutrition that they would provide to those who would eat them. The war had just been ended\nin Europe, and the American prisoners of war had been transhipped to French ports and had been\nsent back home. Uh this food was still in the warehouses in Paris, was appearing in the French\nblack market\u2014in other words\nthe parcels were being stolen from the warehouses and uh this uh American officer said to me if\nyou go to the Quartermaster General and ask for these parcels for the prisoners of war, they\nmight be given to you. I followed his advice. I went to the Quartermaster General. I told him\nthere was need to send uh to ship uh uh Jewish survivors from one place to another without\nmentioning any particular locations. He wasn't interested in asking which locations. I said to\nhim I know that there are these prison of war parcels that soon will rot, that are showing up in the\nFrench black market. Would he sign papers enabling me to take control of those prisoner of war\nparcels? He was relieved to get rid of the headache and he said just make out the orders and I\nshall sign them, five copies. He made out the orders and for the next several days, trucks of the\nBrichah were moving these prisoner of war parcels from the warehouses, the several warehouses\nin Paris, to their own channels for shipment ultimately to southern French ports to go on so-\ncalled illegal ships to Palestine. By the way, there were a number of American Army Jewish\nchaplains who helped the Brichah in similar fashion. There were those who obtained medical\nsupplies for these ships. There were those who even obtained ammunition to be taken aboard the\nships. Indeed wherever there were Jewish chaplains stationed in France, if they were contacted\nby the men or women of the Brichah, they found ways of helping the members of the Brichah.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Question: Uh how did the Brichah get their trucks? Do you know?",
        "Answer: I'm not uh privy to that information. I really can't answer that. I don't know whether\nthey bought them. They did have certain funds. They could have bought them. Uh trucks were\nnot too hard I imagine because gasoline was still rationed. When there's rationing of gasoline\nand gasoline is difficult to obtain and it's very expensive, people who own trucks are not so\nanxious to use them.",
        "Question: Did you help the Brichah in any other way at this time?",
        "Answer: Ah yes. I helped the Brichah later on after I was ordered to Germany to American\nArmy Headquarters in Frankfurt.",
        "Question: OK. Let's talk about Frankfurt, uh unless there's something else you want to add\nabout France.",
        "Answer: About France? No, not necessarily. (OK. What...) Oh yes, I, there is. I must tell you\nthat uh I made a number of friends among Jewish survivors in Paris. I was invited to preach in\nuh several synagogues during the High Holy Days and uh during the festivals and on different\nSabbaths, and as a result of the preaching, I met a number of French Jews who invited me to\ntheir homes. And thus I got to know a number of them, and my friendship with several of them\nhas continued to this day. They have visited America and I and my children have visited them in\nFrance. And similarly with friends among British Jews in London.",
        "Question: How did you get, why did you go from France to Frankfurt, Germany?",
        "Answer: Well, after a year in Paris I received orders commanding me to go to American Army\nHeadquarters in Frankfurt. And to report for duties as an advisor to the Commanding General uh\ndash, General Eisenhower, dash, uh to advise him on Jewish affairs. And uh I flew from Paris to\nuh, no\u2014I didn't fly. I took the American military train which was an overnight train that ran\nbetween Paris and Frankfurt. Paris was our rear headquarters. Frankfurt was our forward\nheadquarters. So I went by train overnight to Frankfurt.",
        "Question: OK. Can you give me a little bit of background about uh suddenly being appointed an\nadvisor?",
        "Answer: As to why this came to be?",
        "Question: How did this come to be?",
        "Answer: This was, that's uh a question of interest because uh there was no such position ever\nbefore uh in the American Army or indeed in any other army. An advisor to a commanding\ngeneral with regard to Jewish problems. And there, it's interesting as to how it came to pass.\nThe war, American war correspondents had reported during the summer of 1945, and their\nreports were read by Americans in New York, Chicago, elsewhere, in the 1n the daily press, that\nJewish survivors of the concentration camps in Germany and Austria were being badly treated.\nAnd as a result President Truman appointed uh Dean Earl G. Harrison who was Dean of the Law\nSchool of the University of Pennsylvania, to make an inspection trip. He came in July of 1945.\nHis aid was Dr. Joseph J. Schwartz fortunately. He was the very able European director of the\nJoint Distribution Committee. And when Dean Harrison returned to the United States toward the\nend of July, he made a report that was highly critical of the American Army uh in Germany and\nof the manner in which they were taking care of Jewish survivors. And at the beginning of\nAugust there was a Zionist conference held in London, the first such conference since the last\nworld Zionist conference of 1939. This was uh the beginning of August 1945. Uh several of us\nchaplains were lucky enough to get to London to attend that Zionist conference and we told the\ndelegates, particularly I remember Rabbi Stephen S. Weiss (ph) of what we had seen in Germany\nand uh Dr. Weiss, uh at the suggestion of one of the chaplains, the late Rabbi Robert Marcus\n(ph), uh sent a dispatch through the American Embassy in London to General Eisenhower,\nsuggesting the appointment of a Jewish chaplain as a liaison officer to coordinate the work being\ndone to help the Jewish survivors in Germany. Uh General Eisenhower two days later replied to\nRabbi Weiss on the 9th of August that uh he did not agree with the suggestion, that uh there\ncould be no appointment of a Jewish liaison officer because liaison officers were at his\nheadquarters representing various nations. There was a French liaison officer. There was a\nPolish liaison officer. A Czech liaison officer. But there couldn't be a reli...a religious liaison\nofficer. Well, uh Gen...General Eisenhower had already received from General Marshall, the\nChief of Staff, several days before this a communication telling him that the report of Dean Earl\nG. Harrison was very critical of the American Army in Germany but on the 10th of August, the\nday after Eisenhower had replied to Rabbi Weiss, he received a cable from Secretary of War\nStimpson telling him that the report of Dean Harrison severely condemned the American Army,\nthat something had to be done. General Eisenhower, the very same day, replied to Secretary of\nWar Stimpson that only yesterday he had turned down the suggestion to appoint a Jewish liaison\nofficer. Now he was going to appoint a chaplain, an Army chaplain, to advise him and to\ncoordinate whatever was being done to help Jewish survivors who had been found in the German\nconcentration camps. So that's how the position came to be created. And that's why I got the\norders in Paris to proceed during the third week of August at all full speed to Frankfurt.",
        "Question: What did you find when you arrived in Frankfurt?",
        "Answer: Well, uh I uh I found that the Army had planned uh fully as to what to do with any\nsurvivors who might be found in German concentration camps. There had been set up a\ncombined displaced persons executive, which was a large office staffed by a number of officers.\nThere was a general who was in charge, General Nicholson. Uh this combined DP executive\nwas under the general command of uh the G5 on General Eisenhower's staff, General Adcock\n(ph), and they were doing a good job in following the plans that had been prepared a long time\nbefore. Those plans said simply that the survivors found in German concentration camps should\nbe quickly sent back to the lands of their origin. And indeed French and, and Belgian and Greek\nand other nationals found in the concentration camps within ninety days were sent back to their\nhomelands. But what the planners had not thought of was number one there would be German\nJews and Austrian Jews and\nHungarian Jews who came from countries that were considered enemy countries by the\nAmerican Army, so they were enemy nationalists, and nobody had planned for enemy\nnationalists to be found in the concentration camps. The irony was that the Germans, the\nHungarians, uh the Austrians had deprived these Jews of their German, Austrian, Hungarian\ncitizenship, but now they were given that citizenship again because to do otherwise would be to\nfollow the practice of of the Nazis. And so they were enemy nationalists. That was one\nproblem. The second problem was, and this was a far greater problem, the planners, the military\nplanners had never contemplated the possibility that there would be survivors who were, who\nwould be Jews who would refuse to return to the lands of their origin. Polish Jews. Ukrainian\nJews. Lithuanian, Estonian Jews. Uh Hungarian Jews. Romanian Jews. Because they knew\nthat their homes, their businesses that they once had had in their lands of origin had been seized\nby their erstwhile neighbors. They knew also that in many cases their former non-Jewish\nneighbors had cooperated with the Nazis in turning in their Jewish neighbors. Indeed in helping\nthe Nazis ship their Jewish neighbors to death camps. They knew that it would be dangerous\neven to return to the lands of their origin. They were concerned less their neighbors now in\npossession of Jewish homes and businesses attack them, as indeed happened. Moreover,\npsychologically these Jews, survivors of German concentration camps, knew that the very land,\nthe very soil where they had once lived was now a soil that absorbed the blood of their children\nand their parents and their spouses. That the very air was polluted with the smoke of the\ncrematoria where Jews had been burned. They had no desire to return to the lands from which\nthey had come. Now it was the problems of these Jews in particular that had not been thought of\nin advance. Therefore the Army indeed did not take care properly of these Jewish survivors. It\nwasn't until the 22nd of August when General Eisenhower issued an order that the Army take\ncare of these survivors and that so-called enemy nationals who were Jewish and who had\nsuffered under the Nazis should be taken care of as victims of the Nazis, that the whole situation\nwas turned around. And a part of that turning around of the situation involved my being ordered\nto take on the duties of visiting these camps, seeing what the conditions were, bringing back my\nreports to General Eisenhower or in his absence to his Chief of Staff, General Walter Beetle\nSmith. And to recommend changes in whatever conditions had to be changed.",
        "Question: At this point we're going to break and change tapes.",
        "Answer: Fine.\nEND OF TAPE",
        "Question: OK. Uh we've begun. You were, you have been assigned to Eisenhower and you\nhave arrived. Uh can you tell me, what was your first assignment?",
        "Answer: Well, my first assignment was to meet of course with the uh uh officers who were the\nstaff of the combined displaced persons executive. And I spent oh the better part of a week uh\nlearning what my job was to, to consist of. I read through a lot of uh files and I had long\ndiscussions uh with uh the several officers who were a part of the combined DP executive and\nthen I uh compiled for myself a list of questions that would be a questionnaire for me when I\nwould arrive in a displaced persons camp. The questions would have to do with uh housing,\nfood, sanitary conditions, medical conditions, health of people and uh the like and where did\nthese people want to go. What did they see as the solution, the ultimate solution to their\nproblems. So armed with this questionnaire, I started off on my first tour. And I went first to\nBavaria uh then under the command of the 3 Army, whose commanding general was General\nGeorge Patton. And uh General Patton had appointed a Major Schaffer (ph) as his displaced\npersons officer on his staff in Munich, which was the headquarters of the 3rd Army. Well, I\nwent to Bavaria and I headed first for Feldafing (ph). Now why Feldafing? Because in the\nreport of Dean Harrison, Feldafing had been praised. Indeed uh Dean Harrison had stated that\nFeldafing should be the model for other DP camps in the American zone of Germany. I went to\nFeldafing. I found uh over five thousand Jews there and the Army contingent in charge was\nheaded by a Lieutenant Irving Smith. Now Irving Smith was a very able and efficient Army\nofficer. He was Jewish. He was sympathetic to the plight of the survivors. And yet the Jews of\nthe camp voiced to me through a committee whom they had chosen, their complaints about\nLieutenant Smith. Why? Well, because he issued orders without consulting with the committee.\nHe, well that that was his job. He was an Army officer. And he wasn't trained to be in charge of\na group of civilians in dire need. But as I went around through the camp with the committee, the\nJewish committee, I was appalled by what I had seen. Why was I so upset? Because Feldafing,\nwhich had been held up by Dean Harrison as the model camp, was severely over-crowded.\nThere were uh a number of, of uh barracks that were completely unfit for human habitation. The\nbarracks were in many cases uh housing with poor roofing so that whenever it rained everything\ninside would get wet. Certainly as I thought of the coming winter, people couldn't be housed in,\nunder such conditions. In addition, there was severe crowding in all of the barracks where the\nJews were living. Remember, this was not a concentration camp. The Jews had been moved out\nof the concentration camp soon after the liberation, and had been put into this kind of housing,\nwhich had been constructed originally for foreign workers who had come into Germany, who\ncame into Germany from such countries uh as Poland and Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia and\nHungary. Many of them were brought by the Germans as slave labor to work in German\nindustry while the Germans themselves were in the German Army. Some had volunteered to\ncome because of their sympathy with the Germans. Well, now these foreign workers were also\ndisplaced persons. They claimed the status of displaced persons. And their housing that had\nbeen used for them was now being used by Jewish displaced persons. And I thought the\nconditions in, in Feldafing were deplorable. And I wondered how bad could the conditions be\nelsewhere if Feldafing had been praised by Dean Harrison as a model DP camp. I found out why\nHarrison praised Feldafing, and that was because Feldafing at that time was almost unique in that\nit was an all-Jewish camp. Now other camps where Jewish survivors were being housed were\ncamps where non-Jews were also being housed. Who were these non-Jews? They were the\nforeign workers I mentioned a moment ago. In many cases they were sympathetic to the Jews,\nbut in most cases they were anti-Jewish. Many of them were, had been sympathetic to the Nazi\ncause, had volunteered to come as workers to Germany. Moreover they had been fed well and\nhoused well and clothed well, all through the years of the war and what the Jewish survivors of\nconcentration camps required was not what they needed. And to give the Jews in the camps\nwhere they were housed with the non-Jews special treatment, more food than the others got,\nbetter clothing than the others had gotten, more medical attention than the others received, would\nbe unthinkable. It would, it could create riots, that the Jews were getting special treatment.\nNever mind that the Jews needed the special attention. It was the Jews who had suffered under\nthe Nazi severely in the concentration camps, not the foreign workers. But 1t was an impossible\nsituation. So what Dean Harrison had recommended was that camps should be set up with\nFeldafing as a model, that is they should be all Jewish camps and they should have a Jewish\ncommittee who would work together with whoever was in charge of the camps, whether it would\nbe uh a military group or an company or workers from the Joint Distribution Committee\nwho were by now being permitted to come into Germany, and to work in the camps, and General\nEisenhower in that famous order of his of August 22nd also ordered that camps be made\navailable for Jews alone, that non-Jews be removed from those camps and sent back as quickly\nas possible to the homelands from which they had come. And that was a great step forward\nbecause that permitted additional special treatment for Jewish survivors. And when I came back\nto headquarters in Frankfurt, and I uh made my first recommendations, first orally to General\nNicholson (ph), General Adcock and very quickly to General uh General Walter Beetle Smith,\nEisenhower's Chief of Staff, later to be Ambassador of the United States to the Soviet Union and\nSecretary of State, my first reports included a number of recommendations. One with regard to\nthe crowding, that more and better housing be obtained. Uh secondly, with regard to food, uh\ntwo thousand calories a day which was an improvement over what the Jews in the camps had\ngotten earlier under the American Army treatment, that two thousand calories a day was not\nsufficient to build up people who had been suffering from malnutrition for years. In addition, the\ntwo thousand calories did not provide sufficient nutrition. The diet was not a balanced diet. And\nI made another recommendation that was of vital importance to the Jews in the camps in\nBavaria, including Feldafing. Namely, that they saw that their camps were surrounded by barbed\nwire. Uh that irritated them to no end because in the concentration camps under the Nazis, their\ncamps had also been surrounded by barbed wire. Moreover, under the orders of General Patton,\na pass system existed in each camp under which no more than a certain percentage of Jews in the\ncamps would get passes enabling them to leave the camp for a certain number of hours. The\nJews in the camps looked out and saw Germans who were, were the enemies of the Americans,\nGermans who had placed them in concentration camps, walking freely on the roads, on the\nhighways. They were not behind barbed wire. They didn't have, have to ask anybody for a pass\nto walk around freely. They, the Jews, who had been so severely treated by the Germans, were\nstill behind barbed wire and had to ask for permission to have a few hours of freedom outside the\nDP camp. Well, uh I must say that uh General Eisenhower acted quickly on all these\nrecommendations. Orders were done quickly to General Patton to correct these situations and I\nhad a uh vivid illustration of how at least in one instance if not in others, the orders were not\ncarried out by General Patton. Generally speaking, had Eisenhower's orders beginning with his\nAugust 22nd initial order correcting the situation been carried out on all the lower levels of\ncommand, the situation for Jewish survivors in Germany would have changed radically quickly.\nUnfortunately there was a wide gap between the headquarters in Frankfurt and the military units\ndealing with the Jewish displaced persons, and with all the intermediary levels through which the\norders had to pass, including General Patton's headquarters in Munich. And so, for example,\nwhen I went back again on my second trip to Bavaria, the Jews complained to me that the barbed\nwire still existed. The pass system had not been changed, and when I came back to Frankfurt, I\nreported that to General Walter Beetle Smith. Soon afterwards I came into the anteroom to\nGeneral Eisenhower Eisen-uh-hower's headquarters, to his office, and I saw General Patton\nsitting in the anteroom at eight o'clock in the morning when the Army day began in Germany,\nand I knew that I must be the reason for his being there. I had reported that he had not carried\nout Eisenhower's order with regard to the removal of the pass system and the barbed wire. I saw\nhim sitting there with his pearl-handled pistols, one on each side of him, with his shiny helmet\nand boots. He glared at me with distaste and I beat a quick diplomatic retreat out of the office.\nLater General Smith told me that what had happened was that when he had reported to\nEisenhower that I had said that Patton had not carried out the orders about the removal of the\nbarbed wire and the pass system, Eisenhower had instructed General Smith to call General\nPatton to have him report the following morning at eight o'clock. General Patton had to ride\novernight from Munich to Frankfurt to be there at eight o'clock in the morning, and later when\nGeneral Eisenhower saw him, General Eisenhower said to Patton after reminding him of the\nbarbed wire and the pass system and his not carrying out Eisenhower's orders with regard to\nthem, General Eisenhower asked him, George, why don't you do something for these Jews? And\nGeneral Patton replied thinking that he was talking to his buddy, his close friend with whom he\nhad gone to school at West Point, he replied uh Eisenhower, in a jocular way, well, why the hell\nshould I. And Eisenhower lost his temper, which he normally kept under control, and retorted,\nwell, God damn it, if for no other reason than because I have ordered you to. Now shortly after\nthat General Patton was relieved of command of the 3rd Army and was given the command of\nthe 15th Army, with headquarters at Bad Nauheim (ph). I don't know why that happened, but the\n15th Army was only a paper Army. It consisted of no troops, only of the headquarters. The\ngeneral story as uh told by newspaper correspondents, the war correspondents and by the movie\nabout General Patton, was that he had slapped a soldier in a military hospital in Sicily, charging\nhim with malingering. But the question asks itself, why should Eisenhower have waited so long\nto punish Patton for something that had happened a long time before. I'm not saying that this\nincident of the barbed wire and pass system were the immediate cause of Patton's demotion, but\nI'm guessing that it may have played some part in it.",
        "Question: OK. Uh you were so involved in all of this, and you were going to the camps. Did\nyou have contact again with the Brichah during this period to help you at all?",
        "Answer: I had contact with Brichah. I found them in various places in Germany and later when I\nwent into the American zone of Austria and I soon gradually came to be a kind of a\ncommunications factor in their operations. Scattered as they were in different areas of Germany\nand Austria, it was very difficult for them to communicate with each other. It was impossible for\nthem to give reports to a representative of the Jewish agency in London. At this particular time\nis was Mosha (ph) , later Mosha (ph) . But I was situated at American Army\nheadquarters in Frankfurt, and I could communicate by telephone with all parts of Europe, so\nthat I could speak to in London and to various members of Brichah in different parts of\nGermany or Austria, and bring reports from the Brichah men and women to and his\nrequests to the members of Brichah, so that I played a small role there uh acting as a kind of uha\ncommunications headquarters for Brichah. Of course I continued on my rounds of the DP camps\nregularly, week in, week out. Not only in Bavaria but in all other parts of the American zone of\nGermany, and at this time too, I had the good fortune of welcoming a delegation of Jewish\nsurvivors from Bergen-Belsen in the British zone of Germany. Uh they came to meet with me to\nfind out what was happening in the American zone of Germany with survivors, to tell me what\nwas happening in Bergen-Belsen under the British zone, and among them I remember was\nRosen and the lady , a physician who was later to become his wife, and\nseveral other leaders of the Jewish committee of survivors in Bergen-Belsen. Incidentally, the\nJews of London, the leaders of the British, British Jewry, wanted also to have an advisor, a\nJewish advisor, appointed to General Montgomery, who was the British commanding general in\nthe British zone of Germany. They asked me for any kind of papers, military orders that might\nbe uh copied by them and sent to General Montgomery to, to see if he would not create a similar\nposition in the British zone of Germany. General Montgomery refused point blank. But I\ncontinued visiting, meeting with Jewish chaplains, who once again were doing a remarkable\npiece of work in helping Jewish survivors. Uh Chaplain Gunther (ph) had found a\nnumber of Hungarian Jewish women wandering across the countryside. They had been brought\nto Germany as a part of a slave labor force, and upon liberation didn't know where to go or what\nto do. Similarly with other American Jewish chaplains, wherever they were. Chaplain Robert\nMarcus (ph), Chaplain Hershell Shactor (ph), and particularly Chaplain Abraham Klossner (ph)\nstationed in Munich who was of inestimable value in helping the Jews in Munich create the\ncentral organization of the Jews of Bavaria whose name was later changed to the Jews of\nGermany. I had sent Chaplain Klossner on a thirty-day order to Dachau where he was to help\nwith the survivors in Dachau. He did that. He did not come back after thirty days. Uh the uh\nfield hospital that had been stationed by the American Army in Dachau to help save as many\nlives as possible of the survivors, moved on. He remained behind. He was attached to no no\nrican military unit, which was altogether contrary to American military orders. He remained on\nhis own, finding shelter and food on his own with the Jewish survivors in Munich, but he was of\nextraordinary assistance in helping the Jews, the displaced persons, Jewish displaced persons, in\nMunich and throughout Bavaria. I cannot pay too much tribute to him and to the other\nAmerican Army Jewish chaplains...(how much)...oh incidentally, excuse me for interrupting you,\nI was almost court martialed because of Klossner because my boss, the theater chaplain, Father\n, learned that I had ordered Klossner who was one of the last American Army Jewish\nchaplains to arrive in that batch of thirty who arrived after the war was actually over. Chaplain\nElia Bonen (ph) who had been with uh the 42nd Rainbow Division that had liberated Dachau,\nhad helped as much as possible while his troops were still in the area of Dachau, but he\ntelephoned me to say he was moving on from Dachau with his troops to Salzburg in Austria, and\nthat I should send somebody to help the Jewish survivors in Dachau. Chaplain uh Abe Klossner\nhad just arrived. I had nowhere really to send him so I ordered him for thirty days to the\nAmerican field hospital that was remaining in Dachau. When the theater chaplain learned of\nwhat I had done, that I had not at the end of thirty days seen to it that Chaplain Klossner should\nbe ordered to another military unit elsewhere, threatened to have me court martialed uh but\nfortunately I talked my way out of it.",
        "Question: How?",
        "Answer: How did I talk myself out of it? By fast talk and also because by this time I had been\ngreatly involved\u2014I was still in Paris at the time \u00a9 I had been greatly involved in service to the\nJewish survivors in Paris, to Jewish lay leaders in Paris, and he might have been just a little bit\nafraid to court martial a chaplain on his staff who had contacts, he knew, not only with civilians\nin Paris but with the Jewish community back in New York, with the heads of the Jewish Welfare\nBoard and the Joint Distribution Committee. There might have been a row created had he done\nit, so he thought the better of it.",
        "Question: Can you (cough), sorry, can you talk a little bit about, you've had these relations with\nBrichah. You're working with the Army. To what extent did the Army turn a blind eye to what\nyou and the Brichah were doing about making sure that supplies got through, etc.?",
        "Answer: Ah that's very interesting. I told you already about the Quartermaster General in Paris\nwho did not ask questions he might have asked as to how many displaced persons were moving,\nwhere were they moving from, where were they moving to he didn't ask the questions. In\naddition, when Jewish chaplains obtained medical supplies and sanitation supplies and even\nammunition for the Brichah, it was with the cooperation usually of their military superiors.\nWhen uh I met General Hume in Austria, and on behalf of the Brichah I asked him where would\nbe a good place for survivors to cross the border. He said this is altogether unofficial and if you\nare ever asked, you never heard it from me, but he took me to the wall map and he showed me a\npoint where it would be a good place to cross the border. Incidentally, he gave me an article that\nwas printed as a brochure that he had written some years before, of Moses as the first great\nmilitary commander who took care of medical and sanitation requirements for an army on the\nmarch. And it was quite a learned article that he had written, long before World War Two had\nstarted. He gave me a copy that I treasure to this day. Now later on, there is a similar story in\nconnection with what happened in Vienna. When I came to Vienna, and first I met with General\nMark Clark who was the American general in command of Austria. I paid my courtesy call. He\nwanted to make certain that I had not come at the express orders of Eisenhower because\nEisenhower was not in command of Germany. I told him I had simply come to see how well the\nAmerican Army under his command was taking care of Jewish survivors in the Austrian camps.\nWhen I came to Vienna and I visited the Rothchild Hospital, which was kind of a way-station for\nthe Brichah, where they housed Jewish\nsurvivors who were being brought from Poland across Yugoslavia through Broto...through\nBrotoslovia (ph), across the border into the Russian zone of Austria, and then into the American\nzone of Austria, and then into the American zone of Germany. I met members of the Brichah\nthere who said they have a very important matter in which they asked my help. They explained\nthat a border crossing from Yugoslavia into the Russian ....in Austria.\nEND OF TAPE\n... who had come there from Poland. They wanted to know if that Russian crossing point was\nclosed permanently or whether it would be opened again, the reason being that they had made all\nkinds of preparations before they used that crossing point. Money had been passed from hand to\nhand to make sure that it would be safe to bring Jewish refugees across that border crossing\npoint. Now it was closed. Would they have to open another border crossing point with the\nrequired payment of sufficient funds, with making certain that it was militarily safe? I said how\ncould I help. They said that by coincidence, a sheer coincidence, there was a Russian officer\nwho was an aid to the Russian commanding general in Vienna. This Russian officer's name was\nthe same as my last name, Nadich. This Russian Jew had come from the Ukraine, that they\nplanned having a party in the apartment of one of the members of Brichah in honor of the two\nNadichs, the one who was on the staff of the Russian commanding general, and the one who was\nthe advisor to the American commanding general, that they would supply us both with plenty of\nvodka, that I should ply my colleague with drinks until I would get the answer, if he knew the\nanswer. So the party took place. I was pleased to meet my colleague with the same name. We\nspoke about the Jewish conditions in the Ukraine. He told me of his great concern, his great fear\nabout his return after the war to the Ukraine. The Nazis had been there for several years and had\npoisoned the minds of those who had not been antisemitic before. He didn't know what would\nbefall the surviving Russian Jews if they were to return to the Ukraine. Gradually we got around\nto the subject in which I was interested. I discussed with him the crossing point from Yugoslavia\ninto the Russian zone of Austria. By this time I neglected to mention before we began to talk\nprivately, the other members of the Brichah had had left the room, and the two of us were left\nalone. And I tried to keep up with him glass for glass with the vodka and then he gave me, he\nactually knew the answer and he gave it to me. No, he said. That crossing is closed temporarily,\nonly for a few days. Next week it will be opened again. As soon as I got what I wanted, I\ncontinued filling his glass but I stopped drinking, and soon the members of the Brichah came\ninto the room, and the party was over and then I conveyed to\nthem the information they wanted.",
        "Question: Quite a story.",
        "Answer: Yes. That was an interesting experience that I had and I must say it was very, very\ndifficult for me. Difficult because I wasn't certain that I could successfully keep up with the\nRussian Nadich in the drinking the vodka. And I wanted to make sure that my mind would\nremain clear until I got the information I was charged to get. But it worked. It worked.",
        "Question: Where did you go from there?",
        "Answer: Where did I go from there?",
        "Question: Yeah. The party was overt...",
        "Answer: The party was over. I visited several camps in Austria, wrote reports about them also\nfor General Eisenhower and for General Clark. General Clark had told me that he and General\nEisenhower were taking a brief, well-earned vacation in the south of France in early August,\nwhen the cables began flying from Washington about the report of Dean Earl Harrison that\ncondemned the American Army for not adequately taking care of Jewish survivors in the\nAmerican zone of Germany, and Eisenhower returned at once to Frankfurt and Mark Clark\nreturned to Vienna. Interestingly I met, in 1971, General Mark Clark's son. I was on my way to\nJapan and Viet Nam to hold torah convocations for the American Army chaplains serving in the\nPacific and in Viet Nam and I called upon the commanding general of the American Army in the\nPacific at his headquarters in Honolulu and he was the son of General Mark Clark. And he asked\nme about my meetings with his father in Vienna in 1945. I visited with my friend, my very close\nfriend whom I really loved, uh Chaplain Elia Bonen (ph) with the 42nd Division, now at\nheadquarters in Salzburg. I visited DP camps in various parts of Germany, including the large\none at Linz. And then...(Tell me...) Then I returned to what was my proper base of operations,\nthe American zone of, of Germany, Austria...",
        "Question: What condition did you find the survivors in these camps?",
        "Answer: That's a very important question. What condition did I find the survivors in in the\nvarious camps in Germany and Austria? I speak particularly of the camps in Germany because I\nvisited them not once but a number of times. The housing was not adequate. The amount of\nfood they were getting was not sufficient. They needed much better clothing, especially warmer\nclothing and decent shoes for the oncoming winter. They required all kinds of assistance so that\nthey could work again. In the various camps, and I think particularly, I remember particularly\nLandsberg, work shops were set up under the supervision of some of the Jewish displaced\npersons themselves. For example in Landsberg, Jacob O'Likesky (ph) who had been the head of\nthe program of the art in Lithuania and therefore had the experience in setting up workshops and\nsupervising them. O'Likesky headed setting up workshops in the DP camp at Landsberg, but he\nneeded tools. He need implements. He needed machinery, and I asked for the requisitioning of\nthat from German sources. In addition there were German, there were Jewish musicians in the\nDP camps. They wanted to play their instruments again, but they had no instruments. They\nwanted to give concerts again in the DP camps, and so I asked that violins and uh wind\ninstruments and string instruments and percussion instruments be requisitioned from German\nsources of supply, and they were. They needed athletic equipment, sports supplies. They\nwanted to play what they called football, but we play soccer. I don't mean all of them did, but\nthere were sufficient numbers of younger men, and we requisitioned these supplies for them.\nAnd there was hardly an aspect of living conditions where they didn't need supplies of all kinds.\nGradually, as the weeks went by, the situation in the camps improved, bit by bit, week after\nweek. They continued their improvement during the three months that I was at work in Germany\nand they continued their improvement even afterwards under the civilian advisors to General\nEisenhower.",
        "Question: You uh had all these duties, but in addition you had a very import event. I believe Ben\nGurion (ph) came.",

        "Question: Would you tell us about Ben Gurion's visit with Eisenhower, please, and how did that\nhappen and what was your involvement in it?",
        "Answer: Well, by uh sheer accident, I was awarded the uh by the French government, the Croix\nde Guerre (ph) and I was asked to obtain the uh, oh I got\u2014I see the puzzle in your face I was\nawarded the Croix de Guerre because of my help to the French Jewish survivors during the year\nthat I was in Paris and I was asked to come from Frankfurt to Paris, to the Hotel de\nwhere the medal would be given to me by uh General deGaulle. I asked permission\nfrom my military superiors. I was granted the permission, and I was to go to Paris for one day. I\ntook the night train to Paris. I came into Paris. I had heard that Ben Gurion was in Paris. I\nfound out where he was, at a certain hotel. I came to see him there, after the ceremony with the\naward of the medal, and sometime before that\u2014this explains how I knew that he was in Paris\u2014I\nhad been asked by General Eisenhower's office to comment about a request they had received\nfrom a certain Mr. David Ben Gurion connected with the Jewish Agency for Palestine, who\nasked for permission to enter the\nAmerican zone of Germany. And my comment was that it would be very valuable for\npermission to be granted because his very presence would raise the morale of the Jewish\nsurvivors in the American zone of Germany in the DP camps. So permission was granted. I\ncalled upon General Eisenhower at his hotel room in Paris on that day that I had come for the\nCroix de Guerre. I learned that he was scheduled to take the night American Army military train\nto Frankfurt. I told him I would meet him on the railroad platform. I got there early. I found out\nthat I was to uh be given a bedroom on the train with uh an American major. At that time I also\nhad the rank of major and uh officers of field rank were given bedrooms, so uh I looked for the\ncommander of the train that happened by coincidence he was an American Army captain who\nwas Jewish. When I, when uh Ben Gurion arrived, I asked him where he was to be on the train,\nand he said that he was to be uh in the coach sitting up all night with uh American Army\nsoldiers. So I went to see the captain commanding the train, and I said to him, do you see that\nman with a shock of white hair on the platform. The uh captain said yes. I said his name is Ben\nGurion. Does that mean anything to you? And uh, he David Ben Gurion's room said no. I said\nwell, uh he's the head of all the Jews of\nPalestine. And he shouldn't be asked to sit up all night long in the coach. He said what do you\nwant me to do. I said well, you tell the other major in the bedroom with me uh that there's an\nemergency, that there's a distinguished guest of the American Army on the train, that uh you're\nvery sorry but the major would have to leave the bedroom. And uh happily the captain followed\nmy advice and Ben Gurion was ushered into my bedroom after the unfortunate major departed.\nDavid Ben Gurion then continued to ply me with questions about the Jewish displaced persons.\nThe major thrust of his questions was, were these people who are completely broken, were they\nhospital cases? Would they have mental problems for as long as they would live, or were they\nvaluable human material who could become important citizens in Palestine in the Jewish\ncommunity? And I assured him for, for from all that I had learned that they were indeed in the\nlater category, that they survived because they were strong, that those who were weaker\nunfortunately did not survive. They were strong both physically and psychically. And that was\nbecause of their strength and their will and their determination that they were able to survive.\nWe talked until two o'clock in the morning, until we both fell asleep. In the morning I took him,\nafter the train landed, after the train arrived in, in uh Frankfurt, I took him first to uh be\nregistered, to be signed in, to the American Army mess. We had breakfast. Then I took him to\nGeneral Eisenhower's suite of offices. General Eisenhower was not there at the time. He was on\na field trip. But I introduced him to General Walter Beetle Smith, saying General Smith, if there\nwere a Jewish state now, I would be introducing the prime minister of that state. That was uh no\ngreat feat on my part. Of course Ben Gurion was the leading Jew of the Jewish community and\nit was a foregone conclusion that if there were to be a Jewish state, he would be at its head. I\nwas later told by General Smith that when he introduced him to General Eisenhower, that\nGeneral Eisenhower was greatly impressed by this man, Ben Gurion, and that he reported to\nGeneral Smith that he was very much taken by him. He asked Ben Gurion to visit the camps\nand of course Ben Gurion had come for that purpose, and to report to General Eisenhower upon\nhis findings after his tour would be over. Well after I had introduced him to General Walter\nBeetle Smith, and we had had lunch, I took uh David Ben Gurion to his first DP camp, to\nZilesheim (ph), which was not far from Frankfurt, near the German townofH __. In\nZilesheim\u2014I would come often because it was close to Frankfurt\u2014the people there were\naccustomed to my coming in with an American Army vehicle, and a number of them saw me\ncome in this time too. A few of them came over to say hello. They happened to peer inside my\ncar in the back seat and they saw something that was incredible to them. They knew the picture\nof Ben Gurion, but they couldn't by the wildest stretch of their imagination imagine that he\nwould be there in their camp in Germany. They began to scream \u201cBen Gurion, Ben Gurion. As\nothers heard the shouts, they came running, and I was afraid of a riot and I cried out, my friends,\nplease show Ben Gurion the discipline of which you are capable. You go around and tell all the\npeople in the camp that David Ben Gurion is here and that he will speak to them. Let them\ncome to the assembly hall. They ran. They gathered up the people who were there. They came\nto the assembly hall and when Ben Gurion and I reached the assembly hall, we went to the back\nof the stage. The assembly hall was quickly filled. The windows and doors were flung open so\nthat people who couldn't get in, who couldn't fi...get even into the standing room which was\ncompletely full, could at least hear standing outside the windows and the doors. And I came out\nto introduce Eisenhower. As the two of us came on the stage, the large throng of people rose and\nthe people began to sing the Hatikvah (ph) and as they sang the Hatikvah, many of them burst\ninto weeping. And I must confess that Eisenhower...that David Ben Gurion and I also wept for\nthe Jews in that assembly hall. At that moment, that DP camp, their liberation was complete.\nThey had dreamed most of them of some day getting to Palestine. Here, in the form of Ben\nGurion, Palestine had come to them. The Nazi nightmare was ended. They were free. They\nwere now in touch with their brothers in . And when the weeping subsided, Ben\nGurion spoke to them, movingly. He continued to break down and the Jews listening continued\nto sob. It was one of the most moving experiences in my life. And to my dying day, I shall not\nforget it. He then asked to meet with the leaders of the committee chosen by the residents of\nZilesheim. The first time I had come to that camp there were only two hundred and fifty Jews\nthere, but the numbers quickly grew to five thousand. That night we met with the committee of\nthe Jewish leaders of Zilesheim. Again he hurled questions at them. Were they able to come to\nPalestine? Did they want to come to Palestine? I knew that in my questionnaire that I had asked\nin the camps, approximately three quarters of them wanted to come to Palestine. They wanted to\nlive for the first time in their lives as a majority in a in a Jewish country, that they could no\nlonger be concerned about any future nightmare. And the remaining 25% wanted to go either to\nthe United States or Canada or to South America or to Australia and he he also wanted to know\nthe answer to an important question that he put to them. I knew it was a test question. He said to\nthem, if we of the Jewish agency were to issue an order that on a certain day all the Jews in the\nDP camps of Germany should march out of those camps, march across borders to ports in\nsouthern Italy, would you follow such a command, knowing that you would be ordered by the\nAmerican military to return to your camps, that you would be shot at by perhaps by Italian\nborder police, that 1t might cost you your lives? Would you follow such an order? And to a man\nthey answered, give the order. We will follow it. Ben Gurion told me afterwards he was\nextremely pleased by the metal of the survivors. His first meeting with survivors, and he saw\nwhat they were like. Unhappily, I could not accompany him on the rest of his tour of DP camps\nbecause I had been informed that same day that the civilian advisor invited by General\nEisenhower when he issued the order appointing me as his military advisor on Jewish affairs,\nthe civilian advisor appointed by President Truman was soon to arrive in Frankfurt from the\nUnited States. He was Judge Simon H. Rifkin (ph), then of the Federal bench.",
        "Question: What did you do then? Where...",
        "Answer: Well uh, Ben Gurion went on his way to cover the major DP camps. I went to the\nrailroad station to meet Judge Rifkin who was arriving on the military train from Paris, and later\nI learned that when Ben Gurion came back, and I saw him again when he came back to Army\nheadquarters in Frankfurt before he departed, he gave General Eisenhower, as the general had\nrequested, a report on his findings. He requested certain things that the Jewish DPs had asked of\nme which I knew could not happen. For example, he asked that the Jews be taken out of the DP\ncamps, that whole German villages should be requisitioned for them, that the German occupants\nof the housing in those villages be evicted, and that the, the Jewish displaced persons be brought\nto take the houses of the Germans evicted from their homes in these villages. I knew that would\nbe turned down by Eisenhower, and I myself never made that recommendation. Ben Gurion did.\nAnd Eisenhower turned it down. But another request by Eisenhower was honored by\nEisen...another request by Ben Gurion to Eisenhower was honored by the general. He asked that\nteams of Jews from the then called Palestine be permitted to enter the DP camps to serve on the\nstaffs of those administering the camps, people, JDC people, to be of help to the Jews in\nthese camps in several ways. To teach them agriculture so that they would be able to become\nfarmers when they would eventually arrive in Palestine. To teach them Hebrew so that they\ncould speak the language of the Jews of Palestine before they got there and other similar tasks.\nAnd Eisenhower indeed agreed to that request, and Jews were brought from Palestine and\nbrought into the camps to serve these functions and any other functions that they had in mind.\nAnd of course they prepared the Jews in these camps for the eventual immigration from the\ncamps to Palestine.",
        "Question: OK. On that note we're going to stop, pause and change tapes.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nEND OF TAPE\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Question: OK. Uh can you at this point tell me something about General Eisenhower and your\nrelationship with him? What was he like?",
        "Answer: I'm glad you asked that question. Uh General Eisenhower, I learned years later when\nhe received an honorary degree at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, spoke of the fact\nthat he and his brothers were raised by their mother on the stories of what he called the Old\nTestament, and he grew up believing that the Jews were indeed the chosen people. And that they\nwere the first to bring to humanity the divine message of ethics and morality. I got to know him\nthrough the humanitarian approach that he took to the improvement of the Jewish survivors in\nthe DP camps in Germany. At the very beginning he cut through what was a gordion (ph) knot\nwith which generals at American Army headquarters were wrestling for a long time. The\ngordion knot consisted of the old question, who are the Jews. A question that has been given\nmuch attention by scholars of all kinds. Are the Jews a nation? Are they a religious grouping?\nAre they arace? Are they a people? On the one hand it was argued that the Jews could not be\ngiven special attention in the DP camps because you couldn't look upon them as Jews. There\nwere either German nationals or Austrian nationals or Polish nationals or Czech nationals. And\nif you were to look upon them as Jews and deprive them of their nationality, were you not doing\nthe same thing that the Nazis had done, of robbing them of their citizenship, and looking upon\nthem as a racial group. On the other hand, how could you help them if you did not look upon\nthem as a special separate group. Well, Eisenhower cut through that gordion knot and when he\nreceived these several communications from Washington, from General Marshall, from\nSecretary Stimpson, and I must stress from President Truman, that the situation must be\ncorrected, Eisenhower at once made up his mind he was going to\nstop with all of this argument, all of this debate, and he was going to treat the Jews as a separate\ngroup. And German Jews and Austrian Jews and Italian Jews were no longer to be enemy\nnationals, but victims, and to be treated as victims of the Nazis and the Jews who didn't want to\ngo back to their homelands, they were to be treated as a special group, given special help,\nbrought back to the level of ordinary common place health of human beings and because he did\nthat, I credit him with the speedy rehabilitation of the Jewish survivors. He came to speak at the\nPark Avenue Synagogue at my invitation in May of 1965. By that time he had been President of\nthe United States, and he was living in Gettysburg. I telephoned him and I asked him would he\ncome to speak at a special service at my synagogue commemorating the 20th anniversary of the\nliberation of the German concentration camps by the American Army under his command. He\nagreed to come. In introducing him to my congregation, I said to them, I want to tell you one\nstory about this man which will be sufficient to tell you about his character, his humanitarianism,\nand his answer to the difficult Jewish problem. I said when we, when the German arm...when\nthe American Army liberated the concentration camps in Germany, there were definitions of who\nwas a displaced person. Who was a displaced person who would benefit from housing, food,\nclothing and all the rest under the aegis of the American Army. The displaced person was\ndefined as a survivor, 1n this case particularly a Jewish survivor, liberated in a concentration\ncamp on German soil. But soon there came into the American zone of Germany, other Jews.\nJews who had been in hiding in Poland. Jews who had been shoved back by the Russians behind\nthe front lines, all the way back to Siberia, an action that actually saved their lives. Now these\nJews came back in large numbers from Siberia to Poland. They found that their homes and their\nbusinesses could not be reclaimed. They discovered that their loved ones had been murdered by\nthe Nazis and the Polish or Ukrainian or Lithuanian helpers and they no longer wanted to try to\nmake out, to make a new life where they had originally lived. And spontaneously they started a\ntrek from Poland to the American zone of Germany, later organized and assisted by the men and\nwomen of the Brichah.",
        "Question: How did Eisenhower react to this?",
        "Answer: Ah, this is a major point that I wanted to make. When these Jews started coming\nacross the borders to enter the American zone of Germany, Eisenhower was asked by the\ncommanders on lower levels, what shall we do with these refugees who are coming into our zone\nin such large numbers. I was asked for a recommendation. The recommendation of course was\nthat they be admitted into the DP camps in the American zone of Germany. General Eisenhower\napproved that recommendation. Eighty thousand Jews came in, and Eisenhower, by that one\norder of approval, contributed to the saving of eighty thousand Jewish lives. Now my friendship\nwith him continued after the war. I was asked to help write items of interest in his campaign for\nthe presidency, such as his Rosh Hashanah message during the campaign. My wife and I were\ninvited to the Inauguration. Before that time I was invited to give an invocation at the\nRepublican National Convention that had that had nominated him. I had him at my synagogue,\nbut before that I had visited him at Gettysburg at his farm, so we remained 1n close contact all\nthrough the years.",
        "Question: How did Eisenhower, did you and Eisenhower at the time you made this\nrecommendation, did you talk to him face to face? What did he say to you?",
        "Answer: I did not in most instances have the opportunity of speaking to him face to face. I did\noften. I did have the privilege of coming to his office, speaking to him face to face, most of the\ntimes answering his questions. When he was not in his office, and that was, that occurred\nfrequently, he would be out on a field trip, then my conversations were with the second in\ncommand, his chief of staff General Walter Beetle Smith.",
        "Question: Did Eisenhower ever talk to you about the Jews and his feelings about Jews?",
        "Answer: I did have occasion to hear such remarks from Eisenhower. He always spoke in an\naffirmative fashion. He always condemned every kind of bigotry and prejudice. He hated what\nthe Nazis had done. He issued orders, after he had first visited Dachau, that American military\ncommanders should bring their units to see Dachau so that the troops might know what they had\nbeen fighting against. He visited Feldafing on Yom Kippur, spoke to the Jews assembled there,\ntold them of his high admiration for them, for the Jewish people and for Judaism, and urged them\nto keep their hope high, that they still had a future. Eisenhower was that kind of personality.",
        "Question: Thank you. OK. When you had been relieved of your post and Judge Rifkin came in\nyour place, uh what did you do?",
        "Answer: Well the first thing I did was to escort Judge Rifkin on a tour of all the camps, to\nintroduce him to all of my contacts among the Jews in the camps, to tell them that he was the\nperson for them to speak to afterwards. I returned to the United States on a troop transport and\nuh I came back to the United States at the end of November, beginning of December in 1945.\nBefore my return I had been visited at my headquarters in uh Frankfurt by uh Major Edward\nWarburg (ph) who was at that time the president of the Joint Distribution Committee, and he was\ngood enough to invite me. After I would be discharged from the Army, to become a member of\nthe staff of the JDC. He even suggested that I would be appointed Director of JDC operations in\nGermany, after I would spend at least a month or so with my family back home. But I returned\nto the United States. Soon afterwards I was asked to speak at the annual meeting of the Joint\nDistribution Committee in New York. I was full of vehement indignation at what I had seen. I\nhad, I contrasted that with what I had found among American Jews when I returned. There was\nvery little awareness among American Jews of what had happened to their fellow Jews in\nEurope. Very few were aware of it, and very few were concerned about it, naturally, because\nthey didn't know. So I was angry and at my uh, I was asked to speak at the annual meeting of the\nJDC and I'm afraid that I gave voice to my anger at that meeting, but to my surprise I was asked\nto give an address the following week at the annual meeting of the United Jewish Appeal to take\nplace in Atlantic City where an unheard of goal was to be proclaimed, a goal of $100,000,000 to\nbe raised during 1946 among the Jews of the United States. Of course I uh accepted the\ninvitation. I addressed the UJA Conference in\nAtlantic City the following week, and I was asked the next morning to have breakfast with the\nleaders of the JDC and the UJA who were there at that conference, and at the breakfast table I\nwas told that I was being relieved of the employment I was to have with the JDC. Instead I was\nasked to accept employment with the United Jewish Appeal and to be a speaker for the hundred\nmillion dollar campaign from which of course the JDC would be receiving its funds. And I\nagreed and for the next six months I spoke in forty different states of the country. I had no place\nI could call my home. I just went from town to town, city to city, and spoke at UJA fund raising\nmeetings. According to the calculations that I kept myself, some $20,000,000 were raised at\nthose meetings. The JDC then asked me to return to Europe, to visit the DP camps in Germany,\nAustria, Italy, once again to bring myself up to date on what had happened and then to go to\nSouth Africa where I was to spend four months in South Africa, what were then called Southern\nand Northern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe and Zambia, and to raise funds there for the South\nAfrican Jewish War Appeal, the agency that then transmitted its funds to the Joint Distribution\nCommittee for work among the Jewish survivors in Europe. I spent a brief while in America. I\nmet the young lady at that time to whom I became engaged after three weeks. Sadly I departed\non my mission for the JDC to Europe, from there to South Africa where I met the most generous\nJews I had as yet met in my career. South African Jews gave generously, very generously, and I\nmade friends among them, friends to this day, and similarly with the Jews, the few Jews in\nZimbabwe and Zambia. I went as far north as what was then called Livingston, in northern\nRhodesia and now Zambia, and of course as far south as Capetown. And I spoke in every city,\ntown and dork (ph) in which there were seventy Jews or more. And happily the South African\nJewish War Appeal reported that the campaign was very successful. I returned to the United\nStates. I got married, happily, and then I worked for the United Jewish Appeal in the New York\nCity campaign for six months. Then tired of not having had a home for myself for a good\nnumber of years, my wife and I settled down in the town of Brookline, Massachusetts, where I\naccepted a congregation, Israel, in Brookline. And so I started my life as a rabbi once\nagain.",

I walked in and not knowing that I\nshould do anything differently, I walked up to his desk where he was seated, and uh put out my\nhand to shake hands with him. And uh he looked at me with a smile on his face, and uh he was a\nvery kind and compassionate man he said chaplain, we don't do things that way in the Army.\nNow what you will do is you go out, come back in again. As soon as you're inside the door, you\ncome to attention and salute, and say, Chaplain Nadich reporting for duty, sir. I uh was shame-\nfaced, but I walked out of the room, knocked on the door again, came back into the room, did\nexactly as he had told me, and from that point on, he took me in hand. He uh got hold of a young\nofficer and told him to spend the next day with me, to teach me about military courtesy, the\ncourtesies of the service, and how to march in a military parade, for the very next day I was to\nmarch in a military parade behind the commanding general as a member of his staff. Well, I,\nfortunately I learned quickly and so uh it wasn't long before I was a regular member of the Army.",
        "Answer: Ah. I was at Fort Bragg for only seventy days, when I received orders to report to Fort\nHamilton, Brooklyn, New York, for overseas shipment to Army Post Office, APO 887. I quickly\nascertained that APO 887 was London. And I was rather pleased to go to that part of the world.\nI proceeded to Fort uh Hamilton in Brooklyn and after waiting for ten days, I was shipped by uh\nbya\nuh Dutch freighter which was a part of a convoy of 55 ships and after sailing 24 days on the high\nseas, uh the convoy reached Liverpool. I learned afterwards, incidentally, that uh another\nchaplain who had far more experience than I, who had been in the Army Reserve in peace time,\nuh was first asked to go and he thought better of it. He declined and I was tapped as the next\nman, and I was glad to go.",
        "Answer: We landed in Liverpool. I reported as I had been instructed to do at Cheltham (ph)\nwhich was our service of supply headquarters, and after a day or two in Cheltham and going\nthrough the uh routine, the red tape, I was assigned to the northern, the northern Ireland Bay\nSection which was located just outside the city of Belfast. The reason for my being sent there,\nsince I was the first Jewish chaplain ordered to the European theater, was because our first\nAmerican troops were stationed in Northern Ireland, and an armored headquarters, a corps\nheadquarters, and uh two infantry divisions, and I immediately began visiting every camp, every\nmilitary camp to search out Jewish soldiers and officers, and to arrange for services and for\nwhatever, whatever other service I could render to the soldiers of Jewish faith.",
        "Answer: Oh yes, oh yes. As a matter of fact the immediate reason for the uh request by General\nEisenhower for a, an American Army Jewish chaplain to be dispatched immediately to the\nEuropean theater, was because there was some kind of a problem that could have become a uh\ncause-c\u00e9lebre. Uh a Jewish soldier had had been killed in a uh motor, Army motor motor vehicle\naccident and since there was no American Army Jewish chaplain at the time, the uh rabbi in\nBelfast, Rabbi , was asked whether he would officiate at the funeral service, the burial\nservice for this Jewish soldier. And he was very quick to respond of course he would be pleased\nto oblige, but he said that he would insist that this Jewish soldier be buried in a Jewish cemetery\nas 1s provided for by Jewish law, and he even offered to provide a grave in the cemetery of his\ncongregation in Belfast. The Army authorities told him that according to Army regulations,\nevery American Army soldier overseas who would have to be buried in a foreign, in foreign soil,\nwould have to be buried in an American Army, a military cemetery because after the war would\nbe over, the remains of these soldiers, at the request of their families, would be returned to the\nUnited States, would be returned home. The Irish rabbi said that he, he could not officiate under\nthose circumstances, and since the military were concerned for the feelings and the good opinion\nof the civilian population, uh the American military authorities saw the need immediately for a,\nan American Army Jewish chaplain. Hence the request for such a chaplain and therefore I was\ndispatched.",
        "Answer: Uh I was in Ireland for approximately, well say August to November, and uh I I was uh\nordered from Ireland to England uh when uh I appeared at the various camps one uh fine\nmorning to visit the troops, and to my amazement the camps were empty. I did not know where\nthe troops had gone, but later I learned they had been shipped of course secretly for the invasion\nof North Africa. Soon after that I was ordered to England and since I was still the only free, that\nis non-assigned to a division, Jewish chaplain, I was ordered to the American Military Cemetery\nat Brookwood in Surry, not far from London, and I was uh stationed with the American\ndetachment uh who took care of burials at their uh quarters in the town of Wilking (ph). We\nactually occupied a a small inn in Wilking. At the cemetery I would officiate at all Jewish\nfunerals on Mondays and Thursdays. The other days of the week, I would get a military vehicle\nand a driver from southern base headquarters in Salisbury, and cover one slice of England. I had\ncarved up England into various slices so that I would be able to visit each area once a month. In\neach Army headquarters or hospital, I would find a Jewish officer or non-commissioned officer\nor private who would know how to conduct a Jewish service, give him prayer books and other\nreligious supplies, have him conduct the services each week, but I would show up once a month\nto uh be of help, to conduct a monthly service, and to help with any problems that might arise.\nAs more Jewish chaplains arrived in the United Kingdom, I would assign them to take parts of\nEngland or, and Scotland, and thus my own territory would be decreased as time went on. But I\nwent as far as Glasgow and again to Belfast, and in all parts of England and to some parts of\nWales.",
        "Answer: Uh this uh continued for about a year while I was stationed in Surry, near London, and\nthen for the second year I was stationed in London proper uh at American Army Headquarters uh\nin London uh at uh at or near Grosvenor (ph) Square.",
        "Answer: And there I was uh a chaplain in the office of the theater chaplain, who was a Roman\nCatholic monsignor, .

        "Answer: Uh well uh I recall particularly in France where my job was more difficult, uh that I\nhad to uh obtain for Catholic chaplains, mass kits for example, and uh hymnals, and hymnals as\nwell for Protestant chaplains.

        "Answer: Well, from England to Paris, uh I was uh flown over in a small plane together with a\nnumber of other officers, and we landed on an air strip in Normandy.

We were asked to uh leave the plane as\nquickly as possible and to run for cover, and uh of course I followed orders very quickly. And\nuh in the process I lost a brand new officer's trench coat that I had just purchased in London\nbefore departure for France.",
        "Answer: Ah, in in Paris I was uh, my title was Deputy to the Theater Chaplain. Not the senior\ndeputy. That was still Nick Carter. But I was deputy to the senior chaplain in the theater to the\ntheater chaplain, Father Terrnand (ph) for Jewish affairs, so that when a new Jewish chaplain\nwould arrive from the States, I was to assign him to his new location. Uh I was still uh G3,\ndistributing religious supplies, and I was a Jewish chaplain at that time, in the beginning the only\nJewish chaplain uh in the area, and of course we moved uh after the breakthrough at St. Lowe\n(ph) we moved into Paris as Paris was captured. In Paris I first met with the the survivors in\nParis. Uh and uh my position there was to be of immediate help to the survivors because for\nmost of them I was the first contact they had with the Jewish community outside. And I was a\nsignal to them that uh the American Jewish community was there, at least in the person of this\none rabbi, this one chaplain.",
        "Answer: Uh, my first meeting with the survivors happened in a rather interesting way. I uh took\na jeep and drove to the area where I had been told Jews had been living, the area known as the\n, the little place. And I flew my Jewish chaplain's flag from the jeep. Uh you may\nknow that the uh Jewish chaplain's flag consisted of a dark blue background, and in the center\nthere was the Jewish chaplain's insignia, consisting of the Ten Commandments, the two tablets\nof the Ten Commandments. Above the tablets, uh the uh six-pointed Star of David. It didn't\ntake long before some people came out and recognized, of course, the Jewish symbols, and\nbegan to talk to me. And they noticed on the lapels of my Army uh uniform the same insignia.\nAnd they began to ask me who I was, what was I doing there. It didn't take long before a crowd\nhad assembled. And some of them thought I should talk to a small committee of Jewish leaders\nthat had already been created to be of help to the Jewish survivors of Paris. Now where did these\nJews come from who had survived the German occupation of Paris? Most of them had fled\nduring the German occupation, or just prior to it, to the south of France where the Italians were\nin charge. The south of France was under Italian occupation. The Italians were never as rigid or\nsevere in their governance of their territory as were the Germans. And so it was easier for a Jew\nto hide himself in the south of France, in the area under Italian orders. And so when the war was\nover and Paris was liberated, very quickly these Jews came back out of hiding from the south of\nFrance. There were a few who had indeed been hidden in Paris itself. And who had\nmiraculously survived. Now I was brought to this committee that was meeting uh in a house that\nthey had taken over as a Jewish community headquarters. And they uh spoke to me uh and told\nme of their problems and their needs. And among other things they quickly gave to me uh a\nbatch of uh the yellow star that the Jews of France had to wear, on which of course was the\nFrench word , Jew. And uh I brought those yellow stars back to America. Uh but uh\nthey told me that their immediate need was to open a soup kitchen or soup kitchens, uh that food\nwas in short supply. They also would like to open they told me a free loan society. Uh I\ncommunicated with uh the uh Joint Distribution Committee in New York, through military\nchannels, and I was cabled from the JDC but through the Jewish Welfare Board which was the\nonly organization set up to deal with American Army Jewish chaplains. Through the JWB I\nreceived $10,000 from the JDC. That $10,000 was used by this committee of Jews in France to\nopen the first soup kitchens in Paris and to start the first Jewish free loan society that would\nenable uh small Jewish shop keepers and artisans to start up work again. Uh that uh didn't end\nmy uh relationship with the Jews who had survived. I met with the committee very often, until\nthe JDC opened its own headquarters on the Rue de in Paris uh but throughout my year\nin Paris, every morning virtually, there were as many as thirty to thirty-five Jews, Parisian Jews\nor French Jews, who found themselves in Paris, who lined up in the hall outside of my Army\noffice at the Hotel Majestique which was American Army headquarters in Paris. Each one of\nwhom had his own story that he wanted to tell me, to communi...communicate with relatives,\nparticularly relatives in America, to try to find relatives or problems of all kinds.",
        "Answer: Yes. One of the most thrilling experiences I had in Paris during that year was to uh\nplay a part in the first service that was held after the liberation of Paris in what is called the\nRothchild Synagogue on uh uh Rue de la Victoire (ph). Uh it's formal title is really the, La\nGrande Synagogue and that synagogue was packed with French Jews, many of whom were\nwomen wearing black. And with American Army soldiers, most of whom were still wearing\nbattle dress, their helmets on their heads, battle uniforms, their guns left in the lobby of the\nsynagogue. And I had the great privilege of uh preaching in French and speaking afterwards in\nEnglish and I remember to this day that as I would come to the end of a sentence or the end of a\nparagraph as I was speaking, and as I paused to draw my breath, I could hear the gentle sobbing,\nparticularly of women in the congregation. My French address, my English address, each was\npunctuated by the crying of people in the congregation, and it was an experience that I shall\nnever forget. They were crying for those who would never return to Paris, those who had been\nkilled by the Nazis. They were crying for all that they had lost during the years of the German\noccupation of France. That was a very moving service. Nobody who attended it will ever forget\nit.\n(SHORT PAUSE)",
        "Answer: Oh yes. Uh I was ordered to appear as the representative of General Eisenhower at a\nceremony for French martyrs who had been killed by the Nazis and who had been buried in a\nmass grave in a French cemetery just outside of Paris. Uh General DeGaulle was to be the\nprinciple speaker but General Eisenhower had been asked to send a representative and the order\nhad come to the theater chaplain to dispatch a chaplain who could speak French. So I was told to\ngo. And I went. And there was quite a crowd there and we were ready to start the ceremony\nwhen suddenly there was a tremendous noise of bullets and artillery shells flying around us, past\nus in all directions, and there was a great deal of screaming of course. Everybody there was\ncertain that the Germans who at that time were not too far away from Paris, that the Germans\nmust have returned. That they were surrounding the cemetery. That their target was General\nDeGaulle, and incidentally anybody else who was there. And therefore all of the shooting. And\nI quickly dodged behind a tall monument, and a little bo...little French boy ran past me. I grabbed\nhim and pulled him down beside me. He had become separated from his mother. He was\ncrying, and I held him near me all throughout the uh shooting. When it suddenly got quiet again,\nall of us left the cemetery quickly. It was only the next day that I learned through the French\npress that what had happened was that on the railroad tracks just outside the cemetery, the\nGermans had left two carloads of ammunition, shells, bullets of all description, and spontaneous\ncombustion had started this tremendous racket of all the bullets and shells being fired and uh we\nwere just very fortunate that uh we weren't killed. I never got to give my uh carefully prepared\ntalk in French.",
        "Answer: Oh, uh I must tell you of something in which I took great pleasure. I, I mentioned\nearlier that I was in charge of all religious supplies for the American Army on the continent of\nEurope. And months before Passover I realized that we would need matzo (ph) for the American\nJewish troops. And when I went to the Quartermaster General he informed me of course as ...\nEND OF TAPE\n..that but that uh if I could locate a matzoth factory in England I could order as much matzo as I\nwanted, that it would be charged on reverse-lend-lease, and he added since the British are not\ngoing to pay us in total (ph) anyhow, order as much matzo as you want. We'll charge it to\nreverse-lend-lease and the British will pay for it. I took him at his word. I gave that English\nmatzo factory that I had discovered the largest order it had ever received. When the matzo came\nsailing across the Channel to Paris to me, it filled an entire liberty ship, which rode high in the\nwaters of the English Channel and the matzo was delivered to Paris. I distributed it to all of the\nJewish chaplains then serving with the American Army for further distribution to American\nJewish troops, for the various Passover that would be held. Incidentally I held my\nPassover Seder for six thousand troops in the Lido in Paris, on the Champs d'Elysee, the largest\nnightclub in Paris, an odd place to have a seder but it worked out very well. No nightclub acts\nbut a seder each night for three thousand soldiers, three thousand the first night, three thousand\nthe second night of Passover. But I had a great deal of matzo left over, so I distributed it first to\nthe Jews of Paris and I gave matzo to the Jewish chaplains with the free French troops, the free\nCzech soldiers, the free Polish Army, and distributed the rest of the matzo to Jewish civilians in\nFrance and Belgium because food, bread in part...1n particular, was not easy to purchase. It\ncouldn't be found in in any great measure, and matzo could be eaten not only during the eight\ndays of Passover of course, but throughout the year. So that was my big order of matzo, and its\ndistribution. Further when came and there was a need for and for\npalm branches used during the festival services of the Feast of Tabernacles, again the\nQuartermaster General obliged me by arranging to have it on reverse-lend-lease and the British\nagain paid for it. And the uh and were purchased in what was then Palestine,\nflown to Egypt, an..by British planes, flown from Egypt to Paris, once again by British planes,\nand I had enough to distribute to all parts of the American Army wherever troops were located.\n(SHORT PAUSE)",
        "Answer: I was in France for a year. (Um-hum) And I traveled incidentally to uh all parts of\nnorthern France, Belgium, and eastern France to meet with the Jewish chaplains, particularly\nthose serving with the uh front line infantry and armored force divisions.",
        "Answer: Well, uh interestingly enough, in a number of French communities, small groups of\nJews returned and the American Army Jewish chaplains did an extraordinary piece of work in\nhelping them. Uh I think of Chaplain, the late Chaplain Isaac Kline (ph) in and many\nJewish chaplains in various Jewish commun...in various Jewish communities in France who first\nbrought the returning Jews the necessities of life-food, medical supplies, medical treatment\nthrough Army medical officers and the where-with-all, the necessities for daily living and then\nhelped reconstruct the communities. Uh these Jewish chaplains would write back to their home\ncommunities, to their home synagogue and ask the members of their synagogues to collect\nclothing and children's toys and soap and various other items that would be needed by uh the\nbeginnings of Jewish communities\nin different parts of France and Belgium. And the communities responded generously.\nHundreds of packages would arrive for a single Jewish chaplain. And he would distribute the\ncontents to the Jews in the community where he was. And Jewish chaplains went further. They\nhelped rebuild synagogues and Jewish community centers so that Jewish communal life began\nonce again in these communities, albeit with far fewer Jews than had been there before. This I\nwitnessed as I traveled through various parts of especially of northern and eastern France and\nBelgium.",
        "Answer: Ah, I'm glad you asked that question. Uh I first met with the representatives of the\nBrichah when I was still stationed in Paris. And I was approached one day by one of them who\ncame to my office at the American Army Headquarters, the Hotel Majestique, and who told me\nuh that he was involved with some other Jews from Palestine in helping to bring Jewish\nsurvivors to ports in southern France. He told me that other comrades of his were working\nelsewhere to bring Jewish survivors to ports in southern Italy. From these French and Italian\nports, the plan was that these survivors would board ships and would be brought to the coast of\nPalestine. Now this was prohibited by the British who were still in control of Palestine, and so\nthese ships were called illegal ships. This was called quote \"illegal immigration\" unquote, uh but\nthese men and women were working to save Jewish lives. This particular man who came to my\noffice in Paris told me that a group of a few hundred, he mentioned possibly as many as eight\nhundred, would be moved soon from a southern French port. Could I possibly help with getting\nfood supplies because even had they the money, it would have been very difficult to buy food in\nFrance at that particular time in history. So I said I would inquire and find out what I could. At\nthe Officers\u2019 Mess that evening, I spoke to an officer who was working at uh the Quartermaster\nGeneral's office. I asked him if he could help me. He said as a matter of fact uh there was a\nlarge supply that filled several warehouses in Paris of prisoner of war parcels that had been sent\nfrom the United States during the war that were to be shipped to Switzerland. From there the\nInternational Red Cross would send them to American prisoners of war in Germany. Now these\nparcels were full of food of high quality and they, they were particularly chosen kinds of food for\nthe nutrition that they would provide to those who would eat them. The war had just been ended\nin Europe, and the American prisoners of war had been transhipped to French ports and had been\nsent back home. Uh this food was still in the warehouses in Paris, was appearing in the French\nblack market\u2014in other words\nthe parcels were being stolen from the warehouses and uh this uh American officer said to me if\nyou go to the Quartermaster General and ask for these parcels for the prisoners of war, they\nmight be given to you. I followed his advice. I went to the Quartermaster General. I told him\nthere was need to send uh to ship uh uh Jewish survivors from one place to another without\nmentioning any particular locations. He wasn't interested in asking which locations. I said to\nhim I know that there are these prison of war parcels that soon will rot, that are showing up in the\nFrench black market. Would he sign papers enabling me to take control of those prisoner of war\nparcels? He was relieved to get rid of the headache and he said just make out the orders and I\nshall sign them, five copies. He made out the orders and for the next several days, trucks of the\nBrichah were moving these prisoner of war parcels from the warehouses, the several warehouses\nin Paris, to their own channels for shipment ultimately to southern French ports to go on so-\ncalled illegal ships to Palestine. By the way, there were a number of American Army Jewish\nchaplains who helped the Brichah in similar fashion. There were those who obtained medical\nsupplies for these ships. There were those who even obtained ammunition to be taken aboard the\nships. Indeed wherever there were Jewish chaplains stationed in France, if they were contacted\nby the men or women of the Brichah, they found ways of helping the members of the Brichah.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Answer: I'm not uh privy to that information. I really can't answer that. I don't know whether\nthey bought them. They did have certain funds. They could have bought them. Uh trucks were\nnot too hard I imagine because gasoline was still rationed. When there's rationing of gasoline\nand gasoline is difficult to obtain and it's very expensive, people who own trucks are not so\nanxious to use them.",
        "Answer: Ah yes. I helped the Brichah later on after I was ordered to Germany to American\nArmy Headquarters in Frankfurt.",
        "Answer: About France? No, not necessarily. (OK. What...) Oh yes, I, there is. I must tell you\nthat uh I made a number of friends among Jewish survivors in Paris. I was invited to preach in\nuh several synagogues during the High Holy Days and uh during the festivals and on different\nSabbaths, and as a result of the preaching, I met a number of French Jews who invited me to\ntheir homes. And thus I got to know a number of them, and my friendship with several of them\nhas continued to this day. They have visited America and I and my children have visited them in\nFrance. And similarly with friends among British Jews in London.",
        "Answer: Well, after a year in Paris I received orders commanding me to go to American Army\nHeadquarters in Frankfurt. And to report for duties as an advisor to the Commanding General uh\ndash, General Eisenhower, dash, uh to advise him on Jewish affairs. And uh I flew from Paris to\nuh, no\u2014I didn't fly. I took the American military train which was an overnight train that ran\nbetween Paris and Frankfurt. Paris was our rear headquarters. Frankfurt was our forward\nheadquarters. So I went by train overnight to Frankfurt.",
        "Answer: As to why this came to be?",
        "Answer: This was, that's uh a question of interest because uh there was no such position ever\nbefore uh in the American Army or indeed in any other army. An advisor to a commanding\ngeneral with regard to Jewish problems. And there, it's interesting as to how it came to pass.\nThe war, American war correspondents had reported during the summer of 1945, and their\nreports were read by Americans in New York, Chicago, elsewhere, in the 1n the daily press, that\nJewish survivors of the concentration camps in Germany and Austria were being badly treated.\nAnd as a result President Truman appointed uh Dean Earl G. Harrison who was Dean of the Law\nSchool of the University of Pennsylvania, to make an inspection trip. He came in July of 1945.\nHis aid was Dr. Joseph J. Schwartz fortunately. He was the very able European director of the\nJoint Distribution Committee. And when Dean Harrison returned to the United States toward the\nend of July, he made a report that was highly critical of the American Army uh in Germany and\nof the manner in which they were taking care of Jewish survivors. And at the beginning of\nAugust there was a Zionist conference held in London, the first such conference since the last\nworld Zionist conference of 1939. This was uh the beginning of August 1945. Uh several of us\nchaplains were lucky enough to get to London to attend that Zionist conference and we told the\ndelegates, particularly I remember Rabbi Stephen S. Weiss (ph) of what we had seen in Germany\nand uh Dr. Weiss, uh at the suggestion of one of the chaplains, the late Rabbi Robert Marcus\n(ph), uh sent a dispatch through the American Embassy in London to General Eisenhower,\nsuggesting the appointment of a Jewish chaplain as a liaison officer to coordinate the work being\ndone to help the Jewish survivors in Germany. Uh General Eisenhower two days later replied to\nRabbi Weiss on the 9th of August that uh he did not agree with the suggestion, that uh there\ncould be no appointment of a Jewish liaison officer because liaison officers were at his\nheadquarters representing various nations. There was a French liaison officer. There was a\nPolish liaison officer. A Czech liaison officer. But there couldn't be a reli...a religious liaison\nofficer. Well, uh Gen...General Eisenhower had already received from General Marshall, the\nChief of Staff, several days before this a communication telling him that the report of Dean Earl\nG. Harrison was very critical of the American Army in Germany but on the 10th of August, the\nday after Eisenhower had replied to Rabbi Weiss, he received a cable from Secretary of War\nStimpson telling him that the report of Dean Harrison severely condemned the American Army,\nthat something had to be done. General Eisenhower, the very same day, replied to Secretary of\nWar Stimpson that only yesterday he had turned down the suggestion to appoint a Jewish liaison\nofficer. Now he was going to appoint a chaplain, an Army chaplain, to advise him and to\ncoordinate whatever was being done to help Jewish survivors who had been found in the German\nconcentration camps. So that's how the position came to be created. And that's why I got the\norders in Paris to proceed during the third week of August at all full speed to Frankfurt.",
        "Answer: Well, uh I uh I found that the Army had planned uh fully as to what to do with any\nsurvivors who might be found in German concentration camps. There had been set up a\ncombined displaced persons executive, which was a large office staffed by a number of officers.\nThere was a general who was in charge, General Nicholson. Uh this combined DP executive\nwas under the general command of uh the G5 on General Eisenhower's staff, General Adcock\n(ph), and they were doing a good job in following the plans that had been prepared a long time\nbefore. Those plans said simply that the survivors found in German concentration camps should\nbe quickly sent back to the lands of their origin. And indeed French and, and Belgian and Greek\nand other nationals found in the concentration camps within ninety days were sent back to their\nhomelands. But what the planners had not thought of was number one there would be German\nJews and Austrian Jews and\nHungarian Jews who came from countries that were considered enemy countries by the\nAmerican Army, so they were enemy nationalists, and nobody had planned for enemy\nnationalists to be found in the concentration camps. The irony was that the Germans, the\nHungarians, uh the Austrians had deprived these Jews of their German, Austrian, Hungarian\ncitizenship, but now they were given that citizenship again because to do otherwise would be to\nfollow the practice of of the Nazis. And so they were enemy nationalists. That was one\nproblem. The second problem was, and this was a far greater problem, the planners, the military\nplanners had never contemplated the possibility that there would be survivors who were, who\nwould be Jews who would refuse to return to the lands of their origin. Polish Jews. Ukrainian\nJews. Lithuanian, Estonian Jews. Uh Hungarian Jews. Romanian Jews. Because they knew\nthat their homes, their businesses that they once had had in their lands of origin had been seized\nby their erstwhile neighbors. They knew also that in many cases their former non-Jewish\nneighbors had cooperated with the Nazis in turning in their Jewish neighbors. Indeed in helping\nthe Nazis ship their Jewish neighbors to death camps. They knew that it would be dangerous\neven to return to the lands of their origin. They were concerned less their neighbors now in\npossession of Jewish homes and businesses attack them, as indeed happened. Moreover,\npsychologically these Jews, survivors of German concentration camps, knew that the very land,\nthe very soil where they had once lived was now a soil that absorbed the blood of their children\nand their parents and their spouses. That the very air was polluted with the smoke of the\ncrematoria where Jews had been burned. They had no desire to return to the lands from which\nthey had come. Now it was the problems of these Jews in particular that had not been thought of\nin advance. Therefore the Army indeed did not take care properly of these Jewish survivors. It\nwasn't until the 22nd of August when General Eisenhower issued an order that the Army take\ncare of these survivors and that so-called enemy nationals who were Jewish and who had\nsuffered under the Nazis should be taken care of as victims of the Nazis, that the whole situation\nwas turned around. And a part of that turning around of the situation involved my being ordered\nto take on the duties of visiting these camps, seeing what the conditions were, bringing back my\nreports to General Eisenhower or in his absence to his Chief of Staff, General Walter Beetle\nSmith. And to recommend changes in whatever conditions had to be changed.",
        "Answer: Fine.\nEND OF TAPE",
        "Answer: Well, my first assignment was to meet of course with the uh uh officers who were the\nstaff of the combined displaced persons executive.

I read through a lot of uh files and I had long\ndiscussions uh with uh the several officers who were a part of the combined DP executive and\nthen I uh compiled for myself a list of questions that would be a questionnaire for me when I\nwould arrive in a displaced persons camp. The questions would have to do with uh housing,\nfood, sanitary conditions, medical conditions, health of people and uh the like and where did\nthese people want to go. What did they see as the solution, the ultimate solution to their\nproblems. So armed with this questionnaire, I started off on my first tour. And I went first to\nBavaria uh then under the command of the 3 Army, whose commanding general was General\nGeorge Patton. And uh General Patton had appointed a Major Schaffer (ph) as his displaced\npersons officer on his staff in Munich, which was the headquarters of the 3rd Army. Well, I\nwent to Bavaria and I headed first for Feldafing (ph). Now why Feldafing? Because in the\nreport of Dean Harrison, Feldafing had been praised. Indeed uh Dean Harrison had stated that\nFeldafing should be the model for other DP camps in the American zone of Germany. I went to\nFeldafing. I found uh over five thousand Jews there and the Army contingent in charge was\nheaded by a Lieutenant Irving Smith. Now Irving Smith was a very able and efficient Army\nofficer. He was Jewish. He was sympathetic to the plight of the survivors. And yet the Jews of\nthe camp voiced to me through a committee whom they had chosen, their complaints about\nLieutenant Smith. Why? Well, because he issued orders without consulting with the committee.\nHe, well that that was his job. He was an Army officer. And he wasn't trained to be in charge of\na group of civilians in dire need. But as I went around through the camp with the committee, the\nJewish committee, I was appalled by what I had seen. Why was I so upset? Because Feldafing,\nwhich had been held up by Dean Harrison as the model camp, was severely over-crowded.\nThere were uh a number of, of uh barracks that were completely unfit for human habitation. The\nbarracks were in many cases uh housing with poor roofing so that whenever it rained everything\ninside would get wet. Certainly as I thought of the coming winter, people couldn't be housed in,\nunder such conditions. In addition, there was severe crowding in all of the barracks where the\nJews were living. Remember, this was not a concentration camp. The Jews had been moved out\nof the concentration camp soon after the liberation, and had been put into this kind of housing,\nwhich had been constructed originally for foreign workers who had come into Germany, who\ncame into Germany from such countries uh as Poland and Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia and\nHungary. Many of them were brought by the Germans as slave labor to work in German\nindustry while the Germans themselves were in the German Army. Some had volunteered to\ncome because of their sympathy with the Germans. Well, now these foreign workers were also\ndisplaced persons. They claimed the status of displaced persons. And their housing that had\nbeen used for them was now being used by Jewish displaced persons. And I thought the\nconditions in, in Feldafing were deplorable. And I wondered how bad could the conditions be\nelsewhere if Feldafing had been praised by Dean Harrison as a model DP camp. I found out why\nHarrison praised Feldafing, and that was because Feldafing at that time was almost unique in that\nit was an all-Jewish camp. Now other camps where Jewish survivors were being housed were\ncamps where non-Jews were also being housed. Who were these non-Jews? They were the\nforeign workers I mentioned a moment ago. In many cases they were sympathetic to the Jews,\nbut in most cases they were anti-Jewish. Many of them were, had been sympathetic to the Nazi\ncause, had volunteered to come as workers to Germany. Moreover they had been fed well and\nhoused well and clothed well, all through the years of the war and what the Jewish survivors of\nconcentration camps required was not what they needed. And to give the Jews in the camps\nwhere they were housed with the non-Jews special treatment, more food than the others got,\nbetter clothing than the others had gotten, more medical attention than the others received, would\nbe unthinkable. It would, it could create riots, that the Jews were getting special treatment.\nNever mind that the Jews needed the special attention. It was the Jews who had suffered under\nthe Nazi severely in the concentration camps, not the foreign workers. But 1t was an impossible\nsituation. So what Dean Harrison had recommended was that camps should be set up with\nFeldafing as a model, that is they should be all Jewish camps and they should have a Jewish\ncommittee who would work together with whoever was in charge of the camps, whether it would\nbe uh a military group or an company or workers from the Joint Distribution Committee\nwho were by now being permitted to come into Germany, and to work in the camps, and General\nEisenhower in that famous order of his of August 22nd also ordered that camps be made\navailable for Jews alone, that non-Jews be removed from those camps and sent back as quickly\nas possible to the homelands from which they had come. And that was a great step forward\nbecause that permitted additional special treatment for Jewish survivors. And when I came back\nto headquarters in Frankfurt, and I uh made my first recommendations, first orally to General\nNicholson (ph), General Adcock and very quickly to General uh General Walter Beetle Smith,\nEisenhower's Chief of Staff, later to be Ambassador of the United States to the Soviet Union and\nSecretary of State, my first reports included a number of recommendations. One with regard to\nthe crowding, that more and better housing be obtained. Uh secondly, with regard to food, uh\ntwo thousand calories a day which was an improvement over what the Jews in the camps had\ngotten earlier under the American Army treatment, that two thousand calories a day was not\nsufficient to build up people who had been suffering from malnutrition for years. In addition, the\ntwo thousand calories did not provide sufficient nutrition. The diet was not a balanced diet. And\nI made another recommendation that was of vital importance to the Jews in the camps in\nBavaria, including Feldafing. Namely, that they saw that their camps were surrounded by barbed\nwire. Uh that irritated them to no end because in the concentration camps under the Nazis, their\ncamps had also been surrounded by barbed wire. Moreover, under the orders of General Patton,\na pass system existed in each camp under which no more than a certain percentage of Jews in the\ncamps would get passes enabling them to leave the camp for a certain number of hours. The\nJews in the camps looked out and saw Germans who were, were the enemies of the Americans,\nGermans who had placed them in concentration camps, walking freely on the roads, on the\nhighways. They were not behind barbed wire. They didn't have, have to ask anybody for a pass\nto walk around freely. They, the Jews, who had been so severely treated by the Germans, were\nstill behind barbed wire and had to ask for permission to have a few hours of freedom outside the\nDP camp. Well, uh I must say that uh General Eisenhower acted quickly on all these\nrecommendations. Orders were done quickly to General Patton to correct these situations and I\nhad a uh vivid illustration of how at least in one instance if not in others, the orders were not\ncarried out by General Patton. Generally speaking, had Eisenhower's orders beginning with his\nAugust 22nd initial order correcting the situation been carried out on all the lower levels of\ncommand, the situation for Jewish survivors in Germany would have changed radically quickly.\nUnfortunately there was a wide gap between the headquarters in Frankfurt and the military units\ndealing with the Jewish displaced persons, and with all the intermediary levels through which the\norders had to pass, including General Patton's headquarters in Munich. And so, for example,\nwhen I went back again on my second trip to Bavaria, the Jews complained to me that the barbed\nwire still existed. The pass system had not been changed, and when I came back to Frankfurt, I\nreported that to General Walter Beetle Smith. Soon afterwards I came into the anteroom to\nGeneral Eisenhower Eisen-uh-hower's headquarters, to his office, and I saw General Patton\nsitting in the anteroom at eight o'clock in the morning when the Army day began in Germany,\nand I knew that I must be the reason for his being there. I had reported that he had not carried\nout Eisenhower's order with regard to the removal of the pass system and the barbed wire. I saw\nhim sitting there with his pearl-handled pistols, one on each side of him, with his shiny helmet\nand boots. He glared at me with distaste and I beat a quick diplomatic retreat out of the office.\nLater General Smith told me that what had happened was that when he had reported to\nEisenhower that I had said that Patton had not carried out the orders about the removal of the\nbarbed wire and the pass system, Eisenhower had instructed General Smith to call General\nPatton to have him report the following morning at eight o'clock. General Patton had to ride\novernight from Munich to Frankfurt to be there at eight o'clock in the morning, and later when\nGeneral Eisenhower saw him, General Eisenhower said to Patton after reminding him of the\nbarbed wire and the pass system and his not carrying out Eisenhower's orders with regard to\nthem, General Eisenhower asked him, George, why don't you do something for these Jews? And\nGeneral Patton replied thinking that he was talking to his buddy, his close friend with whom he\nhad gone to school at West Point, he replied uh Eisenhower, in a jocular way, well, why the hell\nshould I. And Eisenhower lost his temper, which he normally kept under control, and retorted,\nwell, God damn it, if for no other reason than because I have ordered you to. Now shortly after\nthat General Patton was relieved of command of the 3rd Army and was given the command of\nthe 15th Army, with headquarters at Bad Nauheim (ph). I don't know why that happened, but the\n15th Army was only a paper Army. It consisted of no troops, only of the headquarters. The\ngeneral story as uh told by newspaper correspondents, the war correspondents and by the movie\nabout General Patton, was that he had slapped a soldier in a military hospital in Sicily, charging\nhim with malingering. But the question asks itself, why should Eisenhower have waited so long\nto punish Patton for something that had happened a long time before. I'm not saying that this\nincident of the barbed wire and pass system were the immediate cause of Patton's demotion, but\nI'm guessing that it may have played some part in it.",
        "Answer: I had contact with Brichah. I found them in various places in Germany and later when I\nwent into the American zone of Austria and I soon gradually came to be a kind of a\ncommunications factor in their operations. Scattered as they were in different areas of Germany\nand Austria, it was very difficult for them to communicate with each other. It was impossible for\nthem to give reports to a representative of the Jewish agency in London. At this particular time\nis was Mosha (ph) , later Mosha (ph) . But I was situated at American Army\nheadquarters in Frankfurt, and I could communicate by telephone with all parts of Europe, so\nthat I could speak to in London and to various members of Brichah in different parts of\nGermany or Austria, and bring reports from the Brichah men and women to and his\nrequests to the members of Brichah, so that I played a small role there uh acting as a kind of uha\ncommunications headquarters for Brichah. Of course I continued on my rounds of the DP camps\nregularly, week in, week out. Not only in Bavaria but in all other parts of the American zone of\nGermany, and at this time too, I had the good fortune of welcoming a delegation of Jewish\nsurvivors from Bergen-Belsen in the British zone of Germany. Uh they came to meet with me to\nfind out what was happening in the American zone of Germany with survivors, to tell me what\nwas happening in Bergen-Belsen under the British zone, and among them I remember was\nRosen and the lady , a physician who was later to become his wife, and\nseveral other leaders of the Jewish committee of survivors in Bergen-Belsen. Incidentally, the\nJews of London, the leaders of the British, British Jewry, wanted also to have an advisor, a\nJewish advisor, appointed to General Montgomery, who was the British commanding general in\nthe British zone of Germany. They asked me for any kind of papers, military orders that might\nbe uh copied by them and sent to General Montgomery to, to see if he would not create a similar\nposition in the British zone of Germany. General Montgomery refused point blank. But I\ncontinued visiting, meeting with Jewish chaplains, who once again were doing a remarkable\npiece of work in helping Jewish survivors. Uh Chaplain Gunther (ph) had found a\nnumber of Hungarian Jewish women wandering across the countryside. They had been brought\nto Germany as a part of a slave labor force, and upon liberation didn't know where to go or what\nto do. Similarly with other American Jewish chaplains, wherever they were. Chaplain Robert\nMarcus (ph), Chaplain Hershell Shactor (ph), and particularly Chaplain Abraham Klossner (ph)\nstationed in Munich who was of inestimable value in helping the Jews in Munich create the\ncentral organization of the Jews of Bavaria whose name was later changed to the Jews of\nGermany. I had sent Chaplain Klossner on a thirty-day order to Dachau where he was to help\nwith the survivors in Dachau. He did that. He did not come back after thirty days. Uh the uh\nfield hospital that had been stationed by the American Army in Dachau to help save as many\nlives as possible of the survivors, moved on. He remained behind. He was attached to no no\nrican military unit, which was altogether contrary to American military orders. He remained on\nhis own, finding shelter and food on his own with the Jewish survivors in Munich, but he was of\nextraordinary assistance in helping the Jews, the displaced persons, Jewish displaced persons, in\nMunich and throughout Bavaria. I cannot pay too much tribute to him and to the other\nAmerican Army Jewish chaplains...(how much)...oh incidentally, excuse me for interrupting you,\nI was almost court martialed because of Klossner because my boss, the theater chaplain, Father\n, learned that I had ordered Klossner who was one of the last American Army Jewish\nchaplains to arrive in that batch of thirty who arrived after the war was actually over. Chaplain\nElia Bonen (ph) who had been with uh the 42nd Rainbow Division that had liberated Dachau,\nhad helped as much as possible while his troops were still in the area of Dachau, but he\ntelephoned me to say he was moving on from Dachau with his troops to Salzburg in Austria, and\nthat I should send somebody to help the Jewish survivors in Dachau. Chaplain uh Abe Klossner\nhad just arrived. I had nowhere really to send him so I ordered him for thirty days to the\nAmerican field hospital that was remaining in Dachau. When the theater chaplain learned of\nwhat I had done, that I had not at the end of thirty days seen to it that Chaplain Klossner should\nbe ordered to another military unit elsewhere, threatened to have me court martialed uh but\nfortunately I talked my way out of it.",
        "Answer: How did I talk myself out of it? By fast talk and also because by this time I had been\ngreatly involved\u2014I was still in Paris at the time \u00a9 I had been greatly involved in service to the\nJewish survivors in Paris, to Jewish lay leaders in Paris, and he might have been just a little bit\nafraid to court martial a chaplain on his staff who had contacts, he knew, not only with civilians\nin Paris but with the Jewish community back in New York, with the heads of the Jewish Welfare\nBoard and the Joint Distribution Committee. There might have been a row created had he done\nit, so he thought the better of it.",
        "Answer: Ah that's very interesting. I told you already about the Quartermaster General in Paris\nwho did not ask questions he might have asked as to how many displaced persons were moving,\nwhere were they moving from, where were they moving to he didn't ask the questions. In\naddition, when Jewish chaplains obtained medical supplies and sanitation supplies and even\nammunition for the Brichah, it was with the cooperation usually of their military superiors.\nWhen uh I met General Hume in Austria, and on behalf of the Brichah I asked him where would\nbe a good place for survivors to cross the border. He said this is altogether unofficial and if you\nare ever asked, you never heard it from me, but he took me to the wall map and he showed me a\npoint where it would be a good place to cross the border. Incidentally, he gave me an article that\nwas printed as a brochure that he had written some years before, of Moses as the first great\nmilitary commander who took care of medical and sanitation requirements for an army on the\nmarch. And it was quite a learned article that he had written, long before World War Two had\nstarted. He gave me a copy that I treasure to this day. Now later on, there is a similar story in\nconnection with what happened in Vienna. When I came to Vienna, and first I met with General\nMark Clark who was the American general in command of Austria. I paid my courtesy call. He\nwanted to make certain that I had not come at the express orders of Eisenhower because\nEisenhower was not in command of Germany. I told him I had simply come to see how well the\nAmerican Army under his command was taking care of Jewish survivors in the Austrian camps.\nWhen I came to Vienna and I visited the Rothchild Hospital, which was kind of a way-station for\nthe Brichah, where they housed Jewish\nsurvivors who were being brought from Poland across Yugoslavia through Broto...through\nBrotoslovia (ph), across the border into the Russian zone of Austria, and then into the American\nzone of Austria, and then into the American zone of Germany. I met members of the Brichah\nthere who said they have a very important matter in which they asked my help. They explained\nthat a border crossing from Yugoslavia into the Russian ....in Austria.\nEND OF TAPE\n... who had come there from Poland. They wanted to know if that Russian crossing point was\nclosed permanently or whether it would be opened again, the reason being that they had made all\nkinds of preparations before they used that crossing point. Money had been passed from hand to\nhand to make sure that it would be safe to bring Jewish refugees across that border crossing\npoint. Now it was closed. Would they have to open another border crossing point with the\nrequired payment of sufficient funds, with making certain that it was militarily safe? I said how\ncould I help. They said that by coincidence, a sheer coincidence, there was a Russian officer\nwho was an aid to the Russian commanding general in Vienna. This Russian officer's name was\nthe same as my last name, Nadich. This Russian Jew had come from the Ukraine, that they\nplanned having a party in the apartment of one of the members of Brichah in honor of the two\nNadichs, the one who was on the staff of the Russian commanding general, and the one who was\nthe advisor to the American commanding general, that they would supply us both with plenty of\nvodka, that I should ply my colleague with drinks until I would get the answer, if he knew the\nanswer. So the party took place. I was pleased to meet my colleague with the same name. We\nspoke about the Jewish conditions in the Ukraine. He told me of his great concern, his great fear\nabout his return after the war to the Ukraine. The Nazis had been there for several years and had\npoisoned the minds of those who had not been antisemitic before. He didn't know what would\nbefall the surviving Russian Jews if they were to return to the Ukraine. Gradually we got around\nto the subject in which I was interested. I discussed with him the crossing point from Yugoslavia\ninto the Russian zone of Austria. By this time I neglected to mention before we began to talk\nprivately, the other members of the Brichah had had left the room, and the two of us were left\nalone. And I tried to keep up with him glass for glass with the vodka and then he gave me, he\nactually knew the answer and he gave it to me. No, he said. That crossing is closed temporarily,\nonly for a few days. Next week it will be opened again. As soon as I got what I wanted, I\ncontinued filling his glass but I stopped drinking, and soon the members of the Brichah came\ninto the room, and the party was over and then I conveyed to\nthem the information they wanted.",
        "Answer: Yes. That was an interesting experience that I had and I must say it was very, very\ndifficult for me. Difficult because I wasn't certain that I could successfully keep up with the\nRussian Nadich in the drinking the vodka. And I wanted to make sure that my mind would\nremain clear until I got the information I was charged to get. But it worked. It worked.",
        "Answer: Where did I go from there?",
        "Answer: The party was over. I visited several camps in Austria, wrote reports about them also\nfor General Eisenhower and for General Clark. General Clark had told me that he and General\nEisenhower were taking a brief, well-earned vacation in the south of France in early August,\nwhen the cables began flying from Washington about the report of Dean Earl Harrison that\ncondemned the American Army for not adequately taking care of Jewish survivors in the\nAmerican zone of Germany, and Eisenhower returned at once to Frankfurt and Mark Clark\nreturned to Vienna. Interestingly I met, in 1971, General Mark Clark's son. I was on my way to\nJapan and Viet Nam to hold torah convocations for the American Army chaplains serving in the\nPacific and in Viet Nam and I called upon the commanding general of the American Army in the\nPacific at his headquarters in Honolulu and he was the son of General Mark Clark. And he asked\nme about my meetings with his father in Vienna in 1945. I visited with my friend, my very close\nfriend whom I really loved, uh Chaplain Elia Bonen (ph) with the 42nd Division, now at\nheadquarters in Salzburg. I visited DP camps in various parts of Germany, including the large\none at Linz. And then...(Tell me...) Then I returned to what was my proper base of operations,\nthe American zone of, of Germany, Austria...",
        "Answer: That's a very important question. What condition did I find the survivors in in the\nvarious camps in Germany and Austria? I speak particularly of the camps in Germany because I\nvisited them not once but a number of times. The housing was not adequate. The amount of\nfood they were getting was not sufficient. They needed much better clothing, especially warmer\nclothing and decent shoes for the oncoming winter. They required all kinds of assistance so that\nthey could work again. In the various camps, and I think particularly, I remember particularly\nLandsberg, work shops were set up under the supervision of some of the Jewish displaced\npersons themselves. For example in Landsberg, Jacob O'Likesky (ph) who had been the head of\nthe program of the art in Lithuania and therefore had the experience in setting up workshops and\nsupervising them. O'Likesky headed setting up workshops in the DP camp at Landsberg, but he\nneeded tools. He need implements. He needed machinery, and I asked for the requisitioning of\nthat from German sources. In addition there were German, there were Jewish musicians in the\nDP camps. They wanted to play their instruments again, but they had no instruments. They\nwanted to give concerts again in the DP camps, and so I asked that violins and uh wind\ninstruments and string instruments and percussion instruments be requisitioned from German\nsources of supply, and they were. They needed athletic equipment, sports supplies. They\nwanted to play what they called football, but we play soccer. I don't mean all of them did, but\nthere were sufficient numbers of younger men, and we requisitioned these supplies for them.\nAnd there was hardly an aspect of living conditions where they didn't need supplies of all kinds.\nGradually, as the weeks went by, the situation in the camps improved, bit by bit, week after\nweek. They continued their improvement during the three months that I was at work in Germany\nand they continued their improvement even afterwards under the civilian advisors to General\nEisenhower.",
        "Answer: Oh yes, yes.",
        "Answer: Well, by uh sheer accident, I was awarded the uh by the French government, the Croix\nde Guerre (ph) and I was asked to obtain the uh, oh I got\u2014I see the puzzle in your face I was\nawarded the Croix de Guerre because of my help to the French Jewish survivors during the year\nthat I was in Paris and I was asked to come from Frankfurt to Paris, to the Hotel de\nwhere the medal would be given to me by uh General deGaulle. I asked permission\nfrom my military superiors. I was granted the permission, and I was to go to Paris for one day. I\ntook the night train to Paris. I came into Paris. I had heard that Ben Gurion was in Paris. I\nfound out where he was, at a certain hotel. I came to see him there, after the ceremony with the\naward of the medal, and sometime before that\u2014this explains how I knew that he was in Paris\u2014I\nhad been asked by General Eisenhower's office to comment about a request they had received\nfrom a certain Mr. David Ben Gurion connected with the Jewish Agency for Palestine, who\nasked for permission to enter the\nAmerican zone of Germany. And my comment was that it would be very valuable for\npermission to be granted because his very presence would raise the morale of the Jewish\nsurvivors in the American zone of Germany in the DP camps. So permission was granted. I\ncalled upon General Eisenhower at his hotel room in Paris on that day that I had come for the\nCroix de Guerre. I learned that he was scheduled to take the night American Army military train\nto Frankfurt. I told him I would meet him on the railroad platform. I got there early. I found out\nthat I was to uh be given a bedroom on the train with uh an American major. At that time I also\nhad the rank of major and uh officers of field rank were given bedrooms, so uh I looked for the\ncommander of the train that happened by coincidence he was an American Army captain who\nwas Jewish. When I, when uh Ben Gurion arrived, I asked him where he was to be on the train,\nand he said that he was to be uh in the coach sitting up all night with uh American Army\nsoldiers. So I went to see the captain commanding the train, and I said to him, do you see that\nman with a shock of white hair on the platform. The uh captain said yes. I said his name is Ben\nGurion. Does that mean anything to you? And uh, he David Ben Gurion's room said no. I said\nwell, uh he's the head of all the Jews of\nPalestine. And he shouldn't be asked to sit up all night long in the coach. He said what do you\nwant me to do. I said well, you tell the other major in the bedroom with me uh that there's an\nemergency, that there's a distinguished guest of the American Army on the train, that uh you're\nvery sorry but the major would have to leave the bedroom. And uh happily the captain followed\nmy advice and Ben Gurion was ushered into my bedroom after the unfortunate major departed.\nDavid Ben Gurion then continued to ply me with questions about the Jewish displaced persons.\nThe major thrust of his questions was, were these people who are completely broken, were they\nhospital cases? Would they have mental problems for as long as they would live, or were they\nvaluable human material who could become important citizens in Palestine in the Jewish\ncommunity? And I assured him for, for from all that I had learned that they were indeed in the\nlater category, that they survived because they were strong, that those who were weaker\nunfortunately did not survive. They were strong both physically and psychically. And that was\nbecause of their strength and their will and their determination that they were able to survive.\nWe talked until two o'clock in the morning, until we both fell asleep. In the morning I took him,\nafter the train landed, after the train arrived in, in uh Frankfurt, I took him first to uh be\nregistered, to be signed in, to the American Army mess. We had breakfast. Then I took him to\nGeneral Eisenhower's suite of offices. General Eisenhower was not there at the time. He was on\na field trip. But I introduced him to General Walter Beetle Smith, saying General Smith, if there\nwere a Jewish state now, I would be introducing the prime minister of that state. That was uh no\ngreat feat on my part. Of course Ben Gurion was the leading Jew of the Jewish community and\nit was a foregone conclusion that if there were to be a Jewish state, he would be at its head. I\nwas later told by General Smith that when he introduced him to General Eisenhower, that\nGeneral Eisenhower was greatly impressed by this man, Ben Gurion, and that he reported to\nGeneral Smith that he was very much taken by him. He asked Ben Gurion to visit the camps\nand of course Ben Gurion had come for that purpose, and to report to General Eisenhower upon\nhis findings after his tour would be over. Well after I had introduced him to General Walter\nBeetle Smith, and we had had lunch, I took uh David Ben Gurion to his first DP camp, to\nZilesheim (ph), which was not far from Frankfurt, near the German townofH __. In\nZilesheim\u2014I would come often because it was close to Frankfurt\u2014the people there were\naccustomed to my coming in with an American Army vehicle, and a number of them saw me\ncome in this time too. A few of them came over to say hello. They happened to peer inside my\ncar in the back seat and they saw something that was incredible to them. They knew the picture\nof Ben Gurion, but they couldn't by the wildest stretch of their imagination imagine that he\nwould be there in their camp in Germany. They began to scream \u201cBen Gurion, Ben Gurion. As\nothers heard the shouts, they came running, and I was afraid of a riot and I cried out, my friends,\nplease show Ben Gurion the discipline of which you are capable. You go around and tell all the\npeople in the camp that David Ben Gurion is here and that he will speak to them. Let them\ncome to the assembly hall. They ran. They gathered up the people who were there. They came\nto the assembly hall and when Ben Gurion and I reached the assembly hall, we went to the back\nof the stage. The assembly hall was quickly filled. The windows and doors were flung open so\nthat people who couldn't get in, who couldn't fi...get even into the standing room which was\ncompletely full, could at least hear standing outside the windows and the doors. And I came out\nto introduce Eisenhower. As the two of us came on the stage, the large throng of people rose and\nthe people began to sing the Hatikvah (ph) and as they sang the Hatikvah, many of them burst\ninto weeping. And I must confess that Eisenhower...that David Ben Gurion and I also wept for\nthe Jews in that assembly hall. At that moment, that DP camp, their liberation was complete.\nThey had dreamed most of them of some day getting to Palestine. Here, in the form of Ben\nGurion, Palestine had come to them. The Nazi nightmare was ended. They were free. They\nwere now in touch with their brothers in . And when the weeping subsided, Ben\nGurion spoke to them, movingly. He continued to break down and the Jews listening continued\nto sob. It was one of the most moving experiences in my life. And to my dying day, I shall not\nforget it. He then asked to meet with the leaders of the committee chosen by the residents of\nZilesheim. The first time I had come to that camp there were only two hundred and fifty Jews\nthere, but the numbers quickly grew to five thousand. That night we met with the committee of\nthe Jewish leaders of Zilesheim. Again he hurled questions at them. Were they able to come to\nPalestine? Did they want to come to Palestine? I knew that in my questionnaire that I had asked\nin the camps, approximately three quarters of them wanted to come to Palestine. They wanted to\nlive for the first time in their lives as a majority in a in a Jewish country, that they could no\nlonger be concerned about any future nightmare. And the remaining 25% wanted to go either to\nthe United States or Canada or to South America or to Australia and he he also wanted to know\nthe answer to an important question that he put to them. I knew it was a test question. He said to\nthem, if we of the Jewish agency were to issue an order that on a certain day all the Jews in the\nDP camps of Germany should march out of those camps, march across borders to ports in\nsouthern Italy, would you follow such a command, knowing that you would be ordered by the\nAmerican military to return to your camps, that you would be shot at by perhaps by Italian\nborder police, that 1t might cost you your lives? Would you follow such an order? And to a man\nthey answered, give the order. We will follow it. Ben Gurion told me afterwards he was\nextremely pleased by the metal of the survivors. His first meeting with survivors, and he saw\nwhat they were like. Unhappily, I could not accompany him on the rest of his tour of DP camps\nbecause I had been informed that same day that the civilian advisor invited by General\nEisenhower when he issued the order appointing me as his military advisor on Jewish affairs,\nthe civilian advisor appointed by President Truman was soon to arrive in Frankfurt from the\nUnited States. He was Judge Simon H. Rifkin (ph), then of the Federal bench.",
        "Answer: Well uh, Ben Gurion went on his way to cover the major DP camps. I went to the\nrailroad station to meet Judge Rifkin who was arriving on the military train from Paris, and later\nI learned that when Ben Gurion came back, and I saw him again when he came back to Army\nheadquarters in Frankfurt before he departed, he gave General Eisenhower, as the general had\nrequested, a report on his findings. He requested certain things that the Jewish DPs had asked of\nme which I knew could not happen. For example, he asked that the Jews be taken out of the DP\ncamps, that whole German villages should be requisitioned for them, that the German occupants\nof the housing in those villages be evicted, and that the, the Jewish displaced persons be brought\nto take the houses of the Germans evicted from their homes in these villages. I knew that would\nbe turned down by Eisenhower, and I myself never made that recommendation. Ben Gurion did.\nAnd Eisenhower turned it down. But another request by Eisenhower was honored by\nEisen...another request by Ben Gurion to Eisenhower was honored by the general. He asked that\nteams of Jews from the then called Palestine be permitted to enter the DP camps to serve on the\nstaffs of those administering the camps, people, JDC people, to be of help to the Jews in\nthese camps in several ways. To teach them agriculture so that they would be able to become\nfarmers when they would eventually arrive in Palestine. To teach them Hebrew so that they\ncould speak the language of the Jews of Palestine before they got there and other similar tasks.\nAnd Eisenhower indeed agreed to that request, and Jews were brought from Palestine and\nbrought into the camps to serve these functions and any other functions that they had in mind.\nAnd of course they prepared the Jews in these camps for the eventual immigration from the\ncamps to Palestine.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Answer: I'm glad you asked that question. Uh General Eisenhower, I learned years later when\nhe received an honorary degree at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, spoke of the fact\nthat he and his brothers were raised by their mother on the stories of what he called the Old\nTestament, and he grew up believing that the Jews were indeed the chosen people. And that they\nwere the first to bring to humanity the divine message of ethics and morality. I got to know him\nthrough the humanitarian approach that he took to the improvement of the Jewish survivors in\nthe DP camps in Germany. At the very beginning he cut through what was a gordion (ph) knot\nwith which generals at American Army headquarters were wrestling for a long time. The\ngordion knot consisted of the old question, who are the Jews. A question that has been given\nmuch attention by scholars of all kinds. Are the Jews a nation? Are they a religious grouping?\nAre they arace? Are they a people? On the one hand it was argued that the Jews could not be\ngiven special attention in the DP camps because you couldn't look upon them as Jews. There\nwere either German nationals or Austrian nationals or Polish nationals or Czech nationals. And\nif you were to look upon them as Jews and deprive them of their nationality, were you not doing\nthe same thing that the Nazis had done, of robbing them of their citizenship, and looking upon\nthem as a racial group. On the other hand, how could you help them if you did not look upon\nthem as a special separate group. Well, Eisenhower cut through that gordion knot and when he\nreceived these several communications from Washington, from General Marshall, from\nSecretary Stimpson, and I must stress from President Truman, that the situation must be\ncorrected, Eisenhower at once made up his mind he was going to\nstop with all of this argument, all of this debate, and he was going to treat the Jews as a separate\ngroup. And German Jews and Austrian Jews and Italian Jews were no longer to be enemy\nnationals, but victims, and to be treated as victims of the Nazis and the Jews who didn't want to\ngo back to their homelands, they were to be treated as a special group, given special help,\nbrought back to the level of ordinary common place health of human beings and because he did\nthat, I credit him with the speedy rehabilitation of the Jewish survivors. He came to speak at the\nPark Avenue Synagogue at my invitation in May of 1965. By that time he had been President of\nthe United States, and he was living in Gettysburg. I telephoned him and I asked him would he\ncome to speak at a special service at my synagogue commemorating the 20th anniversary of the\nliberation of the German concentration camps by the American Army under his command. He\nagreed to come. In introducing him to my congregation, I said to them, I want to tell you one\nstory about this man which will be sufficient to tell you about his character, his humanitarianism,\nand his answer to the difficult Jewish problem. I said when we, when the German arm...when\nthe American Army liberated the concentration camps in Germany, there were definitions of who\nwas a displaced person. Who was a displaced person who would benefit from housing, food,\nclothing and all the rest under the aegis of the American Army. The displaced person was\ndefined as a survivor, 1n this case particularly a Jewish survivor, liberated in a concentration\ncamp on German soil. But soon there came into the American zone of Germany, other Jews.\nJews who had been in hiding in Poland. Jews who had been shoved back by the Russians behind\nthe front lines, all the way back to Siberia, an action that actually saved their lives. Now these\nJews came back in large numbers from Siberia to Poland. They found that their homes and their\nbusinesses could not be reclaimed. They discovered that their loved ones had been murdered by\nthe Nazis and the Polish or Ukrainian or Lithuanian helpers and they no longer wanted to try to\nmake out, to make a new life where they had originally lived. And spontaneously they started a\ntrek from Poland to the American zone of Germany, later organized and assisted by the men and\nwomen of the Brichah.",
        "Answer: Ah, this is a major point that I wanted to make. When these Jews started coming\nacross the borders to enter the American zone of Germany, Eisenhower was asked by the\ncommanders on lower levels, what shall we do with these refugees who are coming into our zone\nin such large numbers. I was asked for a recommendation. The recommendation of course was\nthat they be admitted into the DP camps in the American zone of Germany. General Eisenhower\napproved that recommendation. Eighty thousand Jews came in, and Eisenhower, by that one\norder of approval, contributed to the saving of eighty thousand Jewish lives. Now my friendship\nwith him continued after the war. I was asked to help write items of interest in his campaign for\nthe presidency, such as his Rosh Hashanah message during the campaign. My wife and I were\ninvited to the Inauguration. Before that time I was invited to give an invocation at the\nRepublican National Convention that had that had nominated him. I had him at my synagogue,\nbut before that I had visited him at Gettysburg at his farm, so we remained 1n close contact all\nthrough the years.",
        "Answer: I did not in most instances have the opportunity of speaking to him face to face. I did\noften. I did have the privilege of coming to his office, speaking to him face to face, most of the\ntimes answering his questions. When he was not in his office, and that was, that occurred\nfrequently, he would be out on a field trip, then my conversations were with the second in\ncommand, his chief of staff General Walter Beetle Smith.",
        "Answer: I did have occasion to hear such remarks from Eisenhower. He always spoke in an\naffirmative fashion. He always condemned every kind of bigotry and prejudice. He hated what\nthe Nazis had done. He issued orders, after he had first visited Dachau, that American military\ncommanders should bring their units to see Dachau so that the troops might know what they had\nbeen fighting against. He visited Feldafing on Yom Kippur, spoke to the Jews assembled there,\ntold them of his high admiration for them, for the Jewish people and for Judaism, and urged them\nto keep their hope high, that they still had a future. Eisenhower was that kind of personality.",
        "Answer: Well the first thing I did was to escort Judge Rifkin on a tour of all the camps, to\nintroduce him to all of my contacts among the Jews in the camps, to tell them that he was the\nperson for them to speak to afterwards. I returned to the United States on a troop transport and\nuh I came back to the United States at the end of November, beginning of December in 1945.\nBefore my return I had been visited at my headquarters in uh Frankfurt by uh Major Edward\nWarburg (ph) who was at that time the president of the Joint Distribution Committee, and he was\ngood enough to invite me. After I would be discharged from the Army, to become a member of\nthe staff of the JDC. He even suggested that I would be appointed Director of JDC operations in\nGermany, after I would spend at least a month or so with my family back home. But I returned\nto the United States. Soon afterwards I was asked to speak at the annual meeting of the Joint\nDistribution Committee in New York. I was full of vehement indignation at what I had seen. I\nhad, I contrasted that with what I had found among American Jews when I returned. There was\nvery little awareness among American Jews of what had happened to their fellow Jews in\nEurope. Very few were aware of it, and very few were concerned about it, naturally, because\nthey didn't know. So I was angry and at my uh, I was asked to speak at the annual meeting of the\nJDC and I'm afraid that I gave voice to my anger at that meeting, but to my surprise I was asked\nto give an address the following week at the annual meeting of the United Jewish Appeal to take\nplace in Atlantic City where an unheard of goal was to be proclaimed, a goal of $100,000,000 to\nbe raised during 1946 among the Jews of the United States. Of course I uh accepted the\ninvitation. I addressed the UJA Conference in\nAtlantic City the following week, and I was asked the next morning to have breakfast with the\nleaders of the JDC and the UJA who were there at that conference, and at the breakfast table I\nwas told that I was being relieved of the employment I was to have with the JDC. Instead I was\nasked to accept employment with the United Jewish Appeal and to be a speaker for the hundred\nmillion dollar campaign from which of course the JDC would be receiving its funds. And I\nagreed and for the next six months I spoke in forty different states of the country. I had no place\nI could call my home. I just went from town to town, city to city, and spoke at UJA fund raising\nmeetings. According to the calculations that I kept myself, some $20,000,000 were raised at\nthose meetings. The JDC then asked me to return to Europe, to visit the DP camps in Germany,\nAustria, Italy, once again to bring myself up to date on what had happened and then to go to\nSouth Africa where I was to spend four months in South Africa, what were then called Southern\nand Northern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe and Zambia, and to raise funds there for the South\nAfrican Jewish War Appeal, the agency that then transmitted its funds to the Joint Distribution\nCommittee for work among the Jewish survivors in Europe. I spent a brief while in America. I\nmet the young lady at that time to whom I became engaged after three weeks. Sadly I departed\non my mission for the JDC to Europe, from there to South Africa where I met the most generous\nJews I had as yet met in my career. South African Jews gave generously, very generously, and I\nmade friends among them, friends to this day, and similarly with the Jews, the few Jews in\nZimbabwe and Zambia. I went as far north as what was then called Livingston, in northern\nRhodesia and now Zambia, and of course as far south as Capetown. And I spoke in every city,\ntown and dork (ph) in which there were seventy Jews or more. And happily the South African\nJewish War Appeal reported that the campaign was very successful. I returned to the United\nStates. I got married, happily, and then I worked for the United Jewish Appeal in the New York\nCity campaign for six months. Then tired of not having had a home for myself for a good\nnumber of years, my wife and I settled down in the town of Brookline, Massachusetts, where I\naccepted a congregation, Israel, in Brookline. And so I started my life as a rabbi once\nagain.",
