        "Q: You -- no, your first husband\u2019s name.",
        "A: -- I was a b -- I was a businesswoman and he was on Hasharah, I met a rich man. And I fell in\nlove and I forgot from Nathan Kalman, and I got married with this man. The war -- so I got\nfriends and he got the lumberyard. So I asked him if they will take little money what I have for\ninterest. He said yes, but you have to learn a little bit to count wood to help us in the -- in the\nlumberyard, cause we got Germans in Poland and only Germans, they are build houses and from\nthem we make the living. So he didn\u2019t steal from them. If he came with a plan from the engineer,\nso we gave him a little less than the engineer marked, but we didn\u2019t took the money for it\nbecause in the other side a Gentile got the same lumberyard and if we wouldn\u2019t give him\ncheaper, he wouldn\u2019t come to us. So then I came to my friends who told me, we need somebody\nto help us. So I went for three months to them, because this is another town Woot is another\ntown, and I helped them. So when the war start we got afraid. The Germans [indecipherable] a-\nasked th-th-the materials, they came right away. So my husband went with them to Russia. If not\nto ga -- would got killed anyway. They didn\u2019t came -- not one came back, or they died there or\nthey killed them, who knows?",
        "Q: What was your first husband\u2019s name?",
        "A: Rosenthal.",
        "Q: And his first name?",
        "A: Aron. Aron, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s talk now about the beginning of the war, do you remember the very beginning and",
        "A: Everything I remember.",
        "Q: Can you describe --",
        "A: A Friday --",
        "Q: -- exactly what happened?",
        "A: A Friday in the morning I was washing the floor and I heard like noise. This place when --\nwhere we lived was close from a highway. I opened the door, I saw horses, wagons, soldiers, and\nI wasn\u2019t afraid. I stood in the door and I looked. They were all passing, and I was standing and\nlooking. But they didn\u2019t anything to us, nothing. For hours they walked and walked and walked\nand walked. So I got tired, I walked into the house. My mother lived across the street. She came\nover and she said, you know, I am afraid to stay here. Let\u2019s go to my youngest sister\u2019s in-laws,\nthey live more the Jews together, let\u2019s go to them. What the Jews gonna do? We will be between\nthem. So I said, that\u2019s a good idea, but let\u2019s wait for a few days, let\u2019s take a little bit with us, we\ncan walk out like this. I got a small baby.",
        "Q: You had a baby by then?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: When was your baby born?",
        "A: My baby was born \u201939 -- \u201939, January 25\".",
        "Q: What was your baby\u2019s name?",
        "A: Yankov, after my father. And so --",
        "Q: Did you wait a few days?",
        "A: Yes, and I got the radio in the door and I heard in the radio Alexandria was a special place for\nthe [indecipherable] Hassidim, they got [indecipherable] there. So I heard on the radio\nAlexandria is to -- lost -- how you saying, they -- they chased them out from over there. So I\nopened the door and I looked, I saw Jews. Womens childrens, with packages -- not like today,\nsuitcases, packages. I stood and I stopped one and I said, what\u2019s going on? She said, don\u2019t you\nknow? They chased us out from the city. They had to leave everything, only what I had behi --\nbe -- be -- close to the hand, that stuff I took. And we don\u2019t know where we are going. I was\nthinking maybe the people don\u2019t know what they talking, but how to believe? So I got a neighbor\nin the same house. He was a educated man and he read the papers, listened to the news. I said,\nMr. Shejak, come out, take a look. He was in the back. Take a look what\u2019s going on outside. He\ncame out with his wife, with his two sons. He stopped one man, he stopped another man, he\nstopped a third man. He said, it\u2019s no good. They have to leave. So I walked over to my mother\nand I said to mama, you know what\u2019s going on? Alexandria, the Jews from Alexandria are\nmoving out, they can\u2019t stay any longer there. So she said okay, let\u2019s go. Yeah, in the meantime,\nwe heard airplanes. I didn\u2019t saw the bombs, but people said they throwed down either a bomb or\ntwo, but I didn\u2019t hear it and I didn\u2019t saw it. So I took th-th-the important things and we went to\nmine si -- younger sister\u2019s in-laws. And we stood there. Over there we heard bombs and they had\nshooting, they had [indecipherable], we had everything. But a few days when the Germans\nsettled in Lodz was a little quiet so we went back home. On way, on two days, they hanged 10\nJews. This was in a cheaper neighborhood, but the most poor Jews lived this -- in this\nneighborhood. And the Jews was the most religious, and a few rich. So the 10 Jews hanged a few\ndays to show the Jews in Lodz what\u2019s going to happen. So that time was time to run out to -- to\nRussia, and I was the one, but I said to my whole family, even to my older brother, I still have a\nfew dollars. From the bank I couldn\u2019t take out, but was a Gentile family, I don\u2019t know if they\nwere anti-Semitic or not, they dealed with Jews to make a dollar. So she said, I can go into the\nbank. Give me the book and I will bring. I think she bringed a little bit, how much she took for\nherself, I don\u2019t know. She gave me a few dollars, that I remember like now.\nA2: Zlotys.",
        "A: Zlotys, yeah. So I said to my mother and to my brother, let\u2019s take a little bit [indecipherable]\npossibly, and let\u2019s go to Russia. So my mother said, the childrens wouldn\u2019t say kaddish after\n[indecipherable] and I don\u2019t want to eat treif and I don\u2019t want to go to Russia. So I got a small\nbaby by myself, I couldn\u2019t go. I should, I was able, but I was staying with the family. So later,\nmy youngest sister went to see Russia. So she was with a very nice Gentile man, and she was --\nshe was pregnant the time. And she was laying by the border a few days and she came back and\nshe said to me, Chanka, forget about Russia, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on over there. The\nGermans are staying there too, and they\u2019re [indecipherable] together with the anti-Semitishi\nPolacks and they\u2019re beating the Jews to death, they\u2019re taking away everything. I said to her, let\nthem take away everything, but let\u2019s come alive to Russia. We are gonna build up a little bit and\nwe will be alive. But she said I\u2019m not going any more. She got the baby in the ghetto, was\nterrible. I was working in the [indecipherable] do you know what\u2019s on there? This was the\neducated boys, they stepped in in the police and you were working for the SS. They knew the --\nwhich places to show them to take out the leftover -- th-th-the -- everything from the Jews, so\nthey ma -- they built up our beautiful can-cantina and the SS came down t-to eat and they --\nsome they came to eat, was outside a 200 girl -- womens -- girls, because they need workers and\nI was standing in the line. I don\u2019t know if this is from God, or this was luck, or my father, they\npicked me and I worked in the canteen.",
        "Q: So when did you go into the ghetto?",
        "A: To the ghetto, 1940. 1940. The ghetto was closed 1940. From the beginning I was doing\nbusiness, I bought cheese for my dau -- for my sister\u2019s in-laws and I bring them in. I have a\nblock to [indecipherable] to make only sweet stuff. So how much I asked, for the cheese, he gave\nme. So I was thinking, tomorrow I [indecipherable] ask double. So tomorrow I came, was no\nmore cheese, was closed the ghetto and that\u2019s all.",
        "Q: What was it -- can you describe in the beginning the ghetto, what -- what your living\nconditions were like, who were you living with, how much room did you have?",
        "A: A room. You got one room for a whole family. So my mother was with three childrens, I was\nwith the baby, my sister with her husband with a baby, my brother with the wife with a baby. But\nthis was a big room, we managed. We were together. Later, my yo -- my younger brother saw\nit\u2019s not good, we gonna die anyway, from starvation. So he signed himself to go to work. So his\nwife went over to her mother, while my brother went to Poznan. This was the worst place what\nthey killed the Jews there.",
        "Q: Wh-Which brother was this?",
        "A: This was Moishe, the third one. So Moishe wrote us a letter. He said, I [indecipherable] you\nknow Koplevich. This was a neighbor, a good friend. In the war, people what they maked the\nnice living, but in the wartime we got mixed up, we didn\u2019t know what to do, so she sent with her\nhusband back to Tomaszow Mazowiecki with -- with the merchandise, with -- with the clothes,\nwith everything. So he died there with the clothes, and we died here they didn\u2019t got clothes, so\nhe -- th-th-the boy was starving, so he signed his name to go to -- to go to Poznan. So over there\nhe died, and my bur -- my brother buried him. So my brother got luck. A German girl falled in\nlove with him -- he was a very religious boy, but he changed later. She brought him back to\nghetto. But in the ghetto was a place what nobody was able to go in, only Rimkowsky with the\npolice, with the SS. She brought him into this place. She walked over to Rimkowsky, she said, I\nwant you to give him a good job. And don\u2019t send him out. And he gave him a good job and he\nhelped us a little bit, yes. But anyway, the ghetto liquidate, he went with his wife and the child,\nthey didn\u2019t came back.",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019re at 1940 --",
        "A: This was 19 -- 1945 and the ghetto liquidated --",
        "Q: No, no, no --",
        "A: -- no, ni -- 1944.",
        "Q: Yeah. But le-let\u2019s -- let\u2019s move back a little bit that you -- you began in the ghetto, you were\nall living together.",
        "A: Oh, it was terrible, the ghetto was terrible, terrible.",
        "Q: What about the food situation?",
        "A: That\u2019s what I\u2019m telling you. I worked in the canteen.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: [helped a little bit.",
        "Q: What did you do?",
        "A: I -- I -- we got frozen potatoes, so I said to my brother-in-law, to my sister\u2019s husband, you\nstay by the window and you watch. If nobody\u2019s ga -- walking around, and I will prepare a sack\nwith a little bit potatoes and I will give you up from the window, because this is anyway going to\nthe garbage. I did. So my mother was grounding this on a grounder and making a soup from it,\nso they got something to eat. Later they liquidate the canteen, so he gave me -- the manager from\nthe canteen was a very nice man. So he said Chanka, I gonna give you a good place, you gonna\ngo into our kitchen. And he gave me a good kitchen [indecipherable] over there to most -- to\nbringed in -- the planes came into [indecipherable] and the mans was emptying the trains and a\nlittle bit poor workers three-quarter dead people came for the soup there too, and I worked there.\nAnd that time they brought from Germany, from [indecipherable] from Czechoslovakia, from --\nthe most from Germany, Czechoslovakia -- we got someplace else? No, Germany, ch-\nCzechoslovakia, they brought in the Jews, naked, barefoot and the German Jews wasn\u2019t used to a\nlife like we got in Poland. They got all convenience, they got beautiful life. I was there and I\nsaw. What can I tell you? I got sick from seeing the way like they were dying like flies.",
        "Q: This was in the ghetto?",
        "A: In the ghetto. They wasn\u2019t used to go outside to the bathroom, they got inside. And Poland\nwas very cold because this is very close to Russia, 24 hours from the Russia border. So I was\nwatching a couple, they were standing outside and they got a little bit hot water in a thermos, and\nthey got cold hand, they were -- so his pants was on the floor, he wasn\u2019t able to pick up her pa --\nunderwear, so I said, I will -- gonna walk out and I will see to -- what I can do to get -- I walked\nout. The man was dying in -- in -- in -- in -- so I pulled up the pants. I told him, hold the pants\nand walk into the place because they gave them little rooms from the Polish people. And to her, I\nhelped her pick up th-the pants. Almost -- she didn\u2019t drop that, but I wasn\u2019t able to -- to carry\nthem. And my job was to give them three times a day, soups. So believe me, I\u2019m not making my\nname nice, or myself nice. I put in in each soup a hamburger. We had to make for them a\nhamburger, but I put in another one. They blessed me. I was afraid, I told them, go, go. Go, don\u2019t\nbless me, now go, go, because I was afraid the manager will hear. But he found out, but he did\nnothing to me, anything. I don\u2019t know what happened to him, they took him out with his wife.\nHe was [indecipherable] Rabinovich, he was a nice man. And he didn\u2019t tell me anything, he saw\nwhat I\u2019m doing. So I worked on [indecipherable] a few months. So my sister got a friend, the\nmother and the father, I don\u2019t know if they died, or they killed them, so the two girls were left in\nthe house and they were starving, cold. The water was freezing in the houses. I got frozen water\nin my house, too. My little boy was laying in bed, locked it outside, the lock and I put a coloring\nbook on a -- a tray, but his -- [indecipherable] was so --",
        "Q: Cold?",
        "A: [sobbing] was running. And I told him, I said, Yankovek, if somebody will knock in the door,\ndon\u2019t answer. He was so smart, he was so afraid. He didn\u2019t answer it. But the doctor, I told him\nfor I\u2019m putting the key because he got a little hole in the right side in the lung. So the doctor\ncame, he took the key, he opened him -- examined him, and he said to -- he said, Yankovek,\ndon\u2019t eat up your mother\u2019s bread, because your mother\u2019s gonna die and who is gonna take care\nof you? Because he couldn\u2019t eat his soups because he was sick, so I gave him my piece of bread.\nBut from that time on he didn't want it. He said, Mama, I am afraid, I don\u2019t want it. I said\nYankovek, I have food, I\u2019m eating. I\u2019m eating carrots, I\u2019m eating vegetables, I\u2019m eating. Well, to\nmake short the story I -- the canteen got closed, the kitchens, they maked a little less, we got a --\na little more so [indecipherable] how it was [indecipherable] yeah, they start to send out from\nLodz, the ghetto, the people. So every day we got less at work. One time I looked down and I\u2019m\nby myself. But I had to prepare the potatoes for tomorrow. And I took out the pails from the\npotatoes to the garbage. I saw a man is walking down, but I wasn\u2019t afraid because the light was -\n- wasn\u2019t [indecipherable] anyway. So I don\u2019t think -- I wasn\u2019t thinking if it\u2019s a Jew or\n[indecipherable] a Gentile, or nothing. I did my work and I closed the door. And I was wearing\nwooden shoes and a scarf over my head and a black coat what I got for my wedding. And I had\nto pass the cemetery. Today if you would give me the whole world money, I wouldn\u2019t walk on a\ncemetery, but that time I was so careful because was costas, you know, like -- like growing hard\n[indecipherable] like little peas. So [indecipherable] so I [indecipherable] touched my coat. So I\nwas afraid [indecipherable] so I took my coat like this and this way I walked, so nothing touched\nme, and I came out to the road and I came home. My mother was sitting and saying\n[indecipherable]. We -- we got a [indecipherable] from [indecipherable] this was a very big\n[indecipherable] I wer -- this wasn\u2019t -- he lees -- lived in Tredia. We were on his grave. They\nlived in -- 21 year in Israel and she was praying for me to come home to the baby. So I came\nhome, I bringed with me a little bit. \u2019'd bring with me a little bit. If they would catch me, they\nwould give me right away to the Germans, but I wasn\u2019t thinking of anything. I bring -- I got in\nthat dress a pocket in here, a pocket in here, so I got the -- a little meatball in here, a little\nmeatball in here, something else, maybe two. So I gave my mother and I gave a half to my\nsister\u2019s boy, little boy and to mine. Later, they liquidate over there, too. So, if I walked out to\nwork, I wasn\u2019t sure if I will come back because they -- how you say [indecipherable] so if -- they\nwas looking for people. So they hop from the street, so I never was sure if I will come back. But\nI don\u2019t know, maybe because I was good to my parents, I came home. One time was\n[indecipherable] loss, only police and firemens, high officials with the wives, they could stay. So\nI got a neighbor on the first floor-- not educated people, they didn\u2019t know an-any Yiddishkeit,\nand we were friends with them. Her husband was a fireman. Well she -- and I got -- received a\nletter to come with my little baby out from -- from Lodz to death. In the meantime, she came up\nand she said, Chanka, will you do me a favor? My husband is very sick. I think he has\npneumonia, I can\u2019t leave him alone. Go to the matzos -- they are -- they were baking matzos, so\nonly the police and the firemens need to go to the matzos. So I came there on Dunkelman, not on\nmy name, on her name. And he came to look. A man -- he became a policeman and he was our\nneighbor and he showed me a list, he said, I would like to break my -- my legs. I have to go to\ntake a few womens with childrens. I saw my name, but I didn\u2019t told him anything. So I was\nwalking with this [indecipherable] because he was a policeman. And her -- her father was -- they\nlived upstairs [indecipherable] bring down their sick father, they throw them into the wagon.\nAnd we were staying back in -- baking the matzos. But later we got afraid they gonna take us\ntoo. So we walked out and I walked into -- excuse me, a toilet and -- and this was in the winter, it\nwas very cold, and this was frozen. And I looked in, was dark, and I was staying on that, but I\nfeel something in the back, but tot -- I didn\u2019t touch it, I didn\u2019t get -- I was staying til was a little\nbit -- I hear th-th -- th-th-the [indecipherable] and I was staying there til [indecipherable]. And I\nmaked up with my sister, if the window will be open a little bit, I can come in. If the window\nwouldn\u2019t be open, I can\u2019t -- shouldn\u2019t come in. So a policeman came in to take me. So the janitor\ndidn\u2019t saw me and a neighbor was taking in my little boy to hide him. So he was sure I am gone.\nSo he said no, this woman with the baby is gone. So they walked away. But I came and my sister\nfalled asleep and she forgot to open the window. So I was walking back. I came again, the\nwindow is closed. But I came again, the little window was open. And I came in [indecipherable]\nshe kissed me, she hugged me. They took out Chaim, her husband, they took out everybody.\nThank God you are here. What\u2019s going to happen with us, what\u2019s happen together. I said listen,\nthis is not [indecipherable] we have to something. She said, what can we do? To drink poison? I\nsaid the best thing would be. The best thing. But anyway, in the evening I went back to the place\nto bake the matzos under Dunkelman\u2019s name. So I met there a girl what her husband was a\njanitor. And on this place were doctors from Czechoslovakia and he maked a living from them\nbecause he bringed the -- the vegetables, the potatoes, the coals for them, and they paid him. So I\ntold a lie, I said listen, I am living with my sister, with my brother-in-law and we can\u2019t get along\nand I would like to find a place to go to. She said, come over to my house. I have three beds. I\u2019m\nlonely. So this girl took me in and I was sleeping with her a few days, but we both got in fight\nand we both packed two sacks and they get -- and they went by themselves to that. And they got\na good life because it got all the doctors from Czechoslovakia. They maked the living from them.\nAnd she was working for the matzos. So I was alone in the house. They came into the house,\nthey asked me for the people [indecipherable] I said they come later, later, but la -- I couldn\u2019t, I\nwas afraid to stay there, so I went back to my sister. But I forgot the meantime to tell you. One\ntime I went to work and I came home and I got only my little boy in the house. They took out my\nfamily. And my little boy, they left a piece of bread, maybe an inch and a half on the window. He\nwas kissing the piece of bread not to eat, only to feel like the crumbs. So my little boy was two\nyears old, he said Mama, don\u2019t eat up Laiva -- Laiva\u2019s bread, he will come back. He\u2019s hungry.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: So that time, they liquidate the ghetto.",
        "Q: When was that, what month?",
        "A: This is -- was 1944.",
        "Q: What month?",
        "A: A month. [indecipherable] Before they liquidate the ghetto, my brother Moishe worked in the\n[indecipherable] radio. This was the best job in ghetto, like with the police. He was very good to\nus. So, in the ghetto they put us in, in our house, downstairs was a movie. So on the roof was a\nlittle wall, and I got black material because we got afraid of the money, so we work materials. So\nI bought a material, was -- was on one side shiny, on the other side was -- this was an expensive\nmaterial. So I there was putting in a few dollars in case we gonna go to work because we were\nthinking they\u2019re going to send us to work, so they will sell this to the Gentile people, we will\nhave a piece of bread for us, for the childrens. So we took a pail of water, I got a bread, and my\nsister got a bread and we went up on the roof and we covered ourselves with the black ma --\nmala -- material under the wall, and I said quietly, Yankovek, do you want a piece of bread? He\nwas speaking Polish. He said, no Mama, I am afraid. We wouldn\u2019t have it tomorrow and the\nGermans gonna kill us. No more, be quiet, don\u2019t talk. So we were laying and I heard some noise\non the steps. I was thinking they coming to take us, but Moishe came. And quietly he called us,\nand we heard Moishe. Moishe said, be quiet, you need bread, I have a kilo bread. I said, Moishe,\nwe still have a bread. If you need the kilo bread -- no, he said, save the kilo bread, but don\u2019t go\ndown because [indecipherable] now downstairs and catching the ch -- the childrens from all\nover. So we were still s-staying down the wall, til was quiet. My brother came and he told us we\ncan come into the house. So we came into the house, they put the childrens to the beds. We have\nourself are tired, frozen, cold, okay. A-And to work -- no, no more work. We were waiting for\nMoishe to come to tell us what to do. But all night Moishe didn't came. Another night Moishe\ncame in the dark and he said, maybe for tonight you should go up again on the roof, because it\u2019s\nnot clear. We don\u2019t know what -- what\u2019s going to happen, maybe they gonna take us, we don\u2019t\nknow. So we went up again on the roof, house was quiet, nothing happened. So in the morning\nvery early he came and he said, bring down the childrens, put them to bed. So we went -- yeah.\nSo mine sister went into the [indecipherable] and he gave her all the breads for my mother with\nthe childrens, because they didn\u2019t got -- close the carts. They didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t got the time to\nclose off first everybody. So she brought up four breads, I don\u2019t remember, or five breads, a little\nbit flour, a little bit this, a little bit this. So we said to each other, now we are eating up our\nbrother, sister and our mother. But not long was taking, a few days and we had to leave the\nghetto. We were -- they sent us over to the other side. So we walked into my s -- sister\u2019s in-laws.",
        "Q: What month was this?",
        "A: This was 1945, in August --\nA2: \u00b044.",
        "A: Four -- 44, in August. Over there we were sitting a few days. Came in a gentleman to look at\nthis place because they had saved 800 people to stay in the ghetto. So my sister was asking him a\nfavor, to let us stay in the basement. So he walked out because he was afraid and he didn\u2019t tell\nus, I think he didn\u2019t answer, he walked out, that\u2019s all. Later came in a policeman, but not -- not to\ntake us, to talk with us because he saw he is in dangerous position too. He said, you know, I had\nvery bad news. They sending us to a place where over there they\u2019re gonna kill our childrens first,\nour parents and later they\u2019re gonna kill us. But we had to go by ourselves with our childrens to\nthe trains and to go to Auschwitz. But my little boy was feeling he is going to die, because he\nloved me and I gave away a bread for our can of conserviate meat. Do you know what I mean\nconserviate? This was lot like sardines, let\u2019s say, meat. So I said, Yankovek, I would like to give\nyou a piece of bread with meat. No, Mama, I can\u2019t eat. He couldn\u2019t eat and he didn\u2019t eat. So we\nwere on trains from cattles. No windows, nothing. Now that you couldn\u2019t breathe.",
        "Q: This is you and your son, and --",
        "A: My little boy, my sister with her little boy, and people from the ghetto.",
        "Q: But that was the only family members you were with?",
        "A: No, no, no, no. We got on -- I got left with my sister and my little boy and her, we both, but\nwith the people from the ghetto. This was -- this I never forget, our sister and our brother, they\nwere so touched to each other. She cried the whole way, he died in the train. What happened to\nthis little girl, I don\u2019t know. Was so crowded we couldn\u2019t breathe, we couldn\u2019t move, nothing.\nFinally we came out to Auschwitz the middle of the night.",
        "Q: How -- do you know how many days you were on -- on trains?",
        "A: On th-the -- the train was going a day and a night, half a night, yeah, it came in.",
        "Q: Did they give you any food?",
        "A: Ah, food. I\u2019m telling you they pushed us in to die there because wasn\u2019t able to breathe, my\nlittle boy couldn\u2019t breathe. I was pushing a little bit the people away, it was a selfish, to make a\nlittle bit air pocket [indecipherable] little boys. So when the opened the wagons to come out,\nJewish people -- Jewish mens worked us. They called them -- how the name was? How --\nA2: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Ah, [indecipherable]. They were -- now, when I\u2019m thinking over, I\u2019m not mad at them\nbecause they were -- they saw the dead for the eyes and they knew we are going to that, so they\ntook away all everything from us to save a little bit for them. They got girlfriends there, they\nwere suffering, but living, but we were expecting the same thing. So they took away everything\nfrom me, and I stood with my [indecipherable] with my sister, so I got the ring, the wedding\nring, I got afraid, I throw it away, because they were beating to death. I got, I think, five sterling\npounds [indecipherable] but I got my wedding, I was saving. I throw this away. My father gave\nus each 20 dollars gold. We throw this away. So meantime we were staying and thinking with\nmy sister, what to do. I saw [indecipherable] here, came in, came close to us, a good looking\nwoman, not too old, in her late 50\u2019s. And she said to us, take me for your mother. I will watch\nyour childrens. Maybe you\u2019ll get sent you to work, I will take care on your childrens and we will\nbe a family. And my sister and I said okay. So this woman stood with us. Later came to us the\nmans from the trains and he said, give the two childrens to the lady, you come with me. So the\nlady took the two little boys by the hands, and I said to my little boy, Yankovek, I will come to\nsee you. He said, I still have the voice in my ears, Mama, you never came to me. You afraid for\nthe Germans. I said, Yankovek, I will come. I will break iron. I will come to see you. I never\ncame. I never see him no more. So this man put us to young people what he send to work. This\nwas a little bit a mensch. So he was thinking he can save us. So he put us -- but I cut my hair,\nthey cut off [indecipherable] hair. I don\u2019t know how it was, somebody came over and he cut off\nmy hair. And my sister didn\u2019t recognize me so she start to scream, who has my sister. They said\nyour sister 1s standing by you. No, this [indecipherable] I said, and now you\u2019re crying about\nhair? I don\u2019t care how I look. So I took off my coat, I throw it away because the coat got full.\nAnd I was staying. And I met a teacher, but I got a night school with her, Socha, such a nice\nlady. So she said, we will be together. I said, Socha, I am happy. I am so happy I am thankful to\nGod to be with you together with my sister. And we stood together and came a lady close to us\nand she called us the names, but I didn\u2019t recognize her. And this was our cousin [indecipherable |\nyeah, she didn't got the baby. In ghetto she got the baby. So she sent her mother with the baby\nshe got -- they got a big store, they got good pinozo. And she was a educated woman too. So she\nsent her mother to Piotrk6w Trybunalski. Over there wasn\u2019t the Third Reich, so she was thinking\nwith the money her mother will save the baby, she\u2019s a young woman, she will go to work. So she\nsaid to me and my sister, can I be with you together? I said, it\u2019s a honor. I am happy you saw us,\nbecause I wouldn\u2019t recognize you. You put us dresses I can tell you s -- years, and I wouldn\u2019t\nnever get through. Dresses, long to the ground, big like this, no hair. We looked like -- like he\ncalled us, Jerusalem putin. So in a few minutes, not long, Mengele came with the -- how the\nname from her? I\u2019m forgetting. She was the worst woman I -- I -- Mengele with his helper, I will\nremind my name. He was wearing white gloves to here, not deep, short gloves. He got a little\nstick in his fingers and he turned around like this, we had to take off the dresses, naked. He\nlooked over the body, if we don\u2019t have anything on the body. It was two sides, he said -- sec --\nhow you saying, selected -- sele -- one on this side, and one on this side. So me and my sister\nmaked up we don\u2019t care, but let\u2019s go together. So my sister went to one side and I went to the\nother side. But I was that time still with my mind. When he turned with the back [indecipherable |\nI moved and I was by my sister. But this cousin got afraid, so she was over there. And the --\nSocha, when I tried to move, I said Socha, do. So she did the same thing and she went over with\nus. So we are together. I says, and now I don\u2019t care. If we gonna go to the gas chambers let\u2019s go\ntogether. If we\u2019re gonna go to work, let\u2019s go together. But this cousin, I never forget what she\ntold me. She knew she 1s going to the gas chambers, but she couldn\u2019t make. So they took us to\ntake a shower and they took them to the same place, but the other group they pushed in in a place\nthat was glass windows. So they saw it\u2019s no good, so they breaked up the door. So they pushed\nin more people what they got to go to work. So my sister was so smart, she said, Hannah come\ncloser here [speaks Polish here]. So we went all the [indecipherable] my sister a -- a little bit\nfarther, but I saw that was going on. So they locked the door, we didn\u2019t saw them any more. Us\nthey put in in cold water, and in the water was charko, this is the name in Polish. But this was a\nchemical, charko. The smell was like from matches, when you lighting a match.",
        "Q: Sulfur, like sulfur.",
        "A: Yeah. So they gave us a bath there and they gave us again dresses, again big -- I don\u2019t know,\none\u2019s got a dress til here, naked the bottom. I got a dress til [indecipherable]. They gave me a\npair of shoes, I\u2019m suffering still to-today. Hollander -- do you know from Hollander shoes, what\nthey harm is about? They gave me --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] the clogs --",
        "A: But they wasn\u2019t too big, so -- and I was walking in them. So I have til today, sick my -- my --\nmy feet. So they took us on place, again a -- a bath -- again a shower, again a shower, agai --\nmaybe 10 showers in one day. Every minute out the dress, everyone out the dress. This was\nMengele and Erma -- Erma, I never forget her. So the last moment, they gave us a cup of soup,\nthey put in five, like this, not like this. Like a line. So the first girl took the pot. The pot maybe\nwas about two quarts, or two and a half a quart. So my sister said Hannah [speaks Polish] run\nand take a little soup from the -- but I was waiting til she\u2019s gonna share. But the other one\ncatched, the other one -- so my daughter -- my sister said, Hannah, I can\u2019t catch for me and you,\nI gonna catch for myself, catch too. But when I runned over, I had to clean with my hand the\nrest, that\u2019s what I got. So I said to my sister, listen, if we gonna stay in Auschwitz a few days\nlonger, we gonna drop dead here anyway. Let\u2019s stay in a group from young people, and we will\nsee what\u2019s gonna happen. She said that\u2019s an idea. And so she went with us. We stood in the\ngroup, they murdered us again with baths, again with showers, again with baths, til they bringed\nus a kilo bread, a piece of bologna and a piece of margarine. So my sister said, now Hannah, we\nare going to walk, and SS mens walked with us about 20 minutes, and I walked in the shoes. And\nI saw trains [indecipherable] and I was okay, but I don\u2019t know maybe the di-di-di -- they bring us\nthat -- to other gas chambers, let\u2019s be a train. But the c-cattle trains. They pushed us in. We ate\nup the bread and on the -- with the [indecipherable] with the margarine. They put in a pail in\ncase, excuse me, for the need. And a SS man was sitting in each [indecipherable] watching us,\nbut when he walked out, he locked us outside. But anyway, we didn't got anything to do. We\ndidn\u2019t ate, we didn\u2019t drink, we didn\u2019t have nothing to do. So he was coming back in an hour, he\nate something [indecipherable] he came in, he was sitting in wa -- but I -- thirsty I was. So we\ngot very little windows like in here, but more buts -- pardon me, smaller. So was raining, I\nsticked out the tongue and I -- I got a few drops rain. So girls behind me were pulling my short\nlittle hair, but I didn\u2019t pull, I don\u2019t care, I am not going away til I dra -- have to get a few drops\nof water. Okay, I was sitting, sleeping, sitting, we were traveling a few days, maybe a week with\nno food, with no water, with nothing. We came to a place -- we came to a place, so he gave us\nstriped dresses. He gave us straw sacks and straw to make like -- like mattresses.",
        "Q: Mattress.",
        "A: So I said to my sister, at least we will have where to lay down. But he was a murder. He start\nto beat -- t-to beat us up to that.",
        "Q: Do you know the name of this place?",
        "A: The place? Valdersluss, yes. So he showed us to be good, if not he 1s -- can -- is able to do the\nsame thing what Auschwitz, va -- he was a murder, but they hanged him anyway, yeah. So he\ngave us two days not to go to work, so we furnished everything, like he said. He gave us\nunderwear, like [indecipherable] you understand what I said to him? Like an undershirt, but\nlonger a little bit, let\u2019s say to the knee. Later he gave us a band, like a brassiere, but no brassiere,\nSO We were -- and --",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: The -- the Lagerfithrers?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know the name, no I -- I -- we didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t know a -- nobody didn\u2019t know the\nname. We got a Oberscharfuhrer, he was a little bit better, but he was afraid of the Lagerfihrer.\nThe Lagerfthrer was a murder. The face, when you looked at his face, you was able to see the\nmurderskeit. The Oberscharfthrer -- and he wasn\u2019t -- he talked a [indecipherable] poli -- nice, he\nsaid, [indecipherable] it\u2019s gonna come a time you will be free. But when he was, he was s-\nscreaming, cursing, calling bad names, yeah. He was a old man, the Oberscharfthrer, he was in\nhis 70\u2019s, but the Lagerfuihrer was a young -- ab-ab -- in his 40\u2019s -- 30\u2019s -- late 30\u2019s. So two days,\ntwo SS mens came and they put us in five, like this, in five, and he said -- he talked to us nice\n[indecipherable] like Germans. He said, and now we are going three kilmetre to the place what\nwe going to start to walk. And behave yourself, I wouldn\u2019t beat you, only you have to walk.\nBecause the Lagerfthrer will come to see. Okay, we walked -- yeah, in the morning he gave us\nlike eight ounces bread with a coffee. The coffee was not coffee. Okay, so the bread yeah, and\nhere we got the cabinets. Found a piece of -- of wire, a piece of string. So w-we put everything\nhere and this was our cabinets. So we went to work. So the first time he told us to dig holes.\nLater we found out this is going to be shelters. But the Lagerfiihrer came into ours and he didn't\nlike we took small amounts on the shovel. He showed us to pick up a shovel full. If he would\nstay with us, nobody would be alive, but we got luck, he stood an hour, a half an hour and he\nleft, so we go back to little bit, little bit. Okay. But was very cold. And I cried to myself. So\nSocha came over to me, she said, why you crying? I says, Socha, I am freezing. I don\u2019t care any\nmore alive. She said, Hannah, my mother told me [speaks Polish here] Do you understand this?\nThe whole body will became like the nose. So she came two hours later and asked me, I said,\nstill not [Polish]. But I became [Polish], yes. I worked in the cold winds, in the cold snows and\nthe cold rains. My dress was never dry, all the time wet. I was sleeping 1n it to dry, but never\ndried. So we worked there, we got the soup, and we came home, we got the soup. He stood --\nthis he did wa -- right. Of course, the Jewish capos, they gave us the top, the water, for them they\nsaved the bottom, th-the -- the [Polish] the -- the vegetables, or the [Polish]. But he stood so she\nhad to mix. So I got a little potato, a little bit cabbage, a little bit [indecipherable] okay. But if he\nwasn't, then they [indecipherable] so we got water. So I worked in this place, in a salt mine, in a\nsalt mine. I was digging out [indecipherable] from the water to full up iron wagons, the name\nwas from the wagons [indecipherable]. This is like little trains, one was touched to the other, and\nthey were on lines and -- yeah, lines. So I got five or six together and I had to full up all the six\nand to push them to the place. Later I kept over, yeah, and I had to come back. But I -- when we\ncame to work, right away he said [speaks foreign language here] and I have til today neuralge in\nmy head, neuralge in my gums, neuralge in my ears, because the wind, the rain, all the time wet.\nBut over there I didn\u2019t suffered. I never got a headache, I never got a toothache. They pulled\nmine teeth there with -- with -- what\u2019s that st -- plines -- plienses. I didn\u2019t got blood poison, I\ndidn\u2019t got anything, they put the camp, I think, six in the bottom for -- yeah. If the girls were\nscreaming, he pulled more. So I was thinking, get away, it\u2019s no good, so I was holding like this,\nso he pulled only six and four, okay. What else we got. Yeah, later they took us to a salt mine.\nThis place was very dangerous. The man [indecipherable] was bringing us down with the\nelevator, was a man in his late 80\u2019s. He said, my God [indecipherable] 50 years here, I never\nbring down womens. God be with them. We came down, what can I tell you? That th-the\n[indecipherable] better for us than to -- okay, he came over with the lamp in the front, he showed\nus what to do. So he picked me to push up -- they got prepared in the daytime, I think\n[indecipherable] were prepared for us. So was -- the salt was cut in pieces, big pieces, smaller\npieces. So sliding [indecipherable] was going up on electricity. But I had to go so fast, if not this\npiece what I moved first would come back and kill me. So I was a little bit with energy and I\npulled fast up. But I had to stop a little bit, so that one time it got up but a watchma -- SS man,\nbut he didn\u2019t pushed us so fast. But he watched us if he heard walking, because in the salt mine\nyou heard walking because was quiet, he said [speaks foreign language here]. So when I heard,\nso I pushed up. To work a whole night, to push up pieces, about 10 - 15 pounds was vi -- I would\n-- | would drop dead. So I finished a night, thank God. We got wooden shoes, outside was snow.\nThe snow sticked to the -- to the wood, so we wouldn\u2019t able to walk sn -- nice. So the SS man\nbeat up. If this one don\u2019t [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know how my husband 1s forcing me to keep\nup kosher. I don\u2019t know. So when walked, the five, we walk -- we watched each other, because if\none from the five was a little crooked, he beat up all the five. So we were holding us fast and\nthank God we made home [indecipherable]. But what I saw, I never forget. But -- but I don\u2019t\nknow what kind people, the Germans were educated people, high educated people, how they can\ndo this, to kill people alive with kicking. So I working in salts mine a few days. Another day they\ngave me something else, another day he gave me something else, but we had to take off the\ndresses, was very hot. But water we bring with us because the salt was making thirsty, but no\nfood. In the nighttime no, but in the morning when we came we got our soup with the piece of\nbread and he told us to go to bed, to sleep. But I saw the salt mine is not good either. So I was a\nbusinesswoman. I put in a few piece of salt in my -- in mine cabinet, and I was thinking with my\nsister we gonna change salt for something else because we didn\u2019t got salt there. So \u2019'da--a\ncousin from mine sister\u2019s husband came over and she said, do you have salt? I said yes. She said,\nI have a few customers, they working in the kitchen. I will bring you bread. [indecipherable]\ntook out the whole -- the whole how you say [Polish] and I gave her. Til today she isn\u2019t showing\nup. If she is alive, let her be alive, I don\u2019t care. Okay. Later they took us [indecipherable] was\nvery hard. Again li -- to put the full up the [speaks Polish]\nA2: The lorries.",
        "A: The lorries. So dirt, not from the water, dirt, stones, and we -- I wa-was full of -- got five, six,\nand they told me what, to push them and to empty them and come back. So I worked with my\nsister, and my sister, she was looking only for news. Then she saw -- then she saw a man, she\nstopped him and she asked him, do you think we will come out from here? The one man said to\nus, yes, but fight. I said, what do you mean fight? From where can -- where can I take food to\neat? Grass, was grass. I would eat grass, was grass. So this man got a friend, so my sister talked\nto one and I talked to other one. A few days later I met one, I said, where is your friend? He\u2019s\ngone. A few days later this other one didn\u2019t came, so we didn't got to ask anybody, okay. But the\nman what he walked [indecipherable] with us, he was not dead. He said [speaks Polish] to take a\nbreak, a few minutes. He said, I don\u2019t care if [indecipherable] you Lagerfihrer. If he will come, I\nwill talk to him.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: -- I will talk to him. But he didn\u2019t came. So later he told us, okay, go back to work. So we\nstart again to fill up the dirt. Believe me, they didn't -- they didn\u2019t need the work, only to -- to\nmurder us. Only to murder us, okay. One time they took me to another group. So this SS man\nwas alone, if he -- if he wa -- if so -- if the SS was alone, was much better. If was two or three,\nwas [indecipherable] one was showing off to the other he\u2019s taking better care. So he said one\nthing. I want you to be quiet. I will take you into a room. If you will stay in the room, I will\nwatch outside if the Lagerfuhrer is coming. And he kept us a whole day in the room because\nraining and snowing and this was in the woods. And we had to -- to clean the woods, to pick up\nthe little branches to put together. So we were sitting in the room a whole day til was dark, he\ntook us home. Okay. And now, on the same place we came every day to work, so was many\nnations there. But other nations, they got better than we had. So we saw our clean -- came from -\n- from garbage, but clean, new. Was foo -- food. And we got in the back little cans from the\nmeat, I don\u2019t know from where we took them. So everybody walked over and fi -- and I did, too.\nLater they called the -- up Lagerftihrer and they told him what we did, but he didn\u2019t -- he didn't\nsaid anything to us. When we came home -- so my sister was very smart, she said mum --\nHannah don\u2019t stay in the first line and don\u2019t stay in the last line, so we will -- we will be able to\nsee what they are doing with the first line. So who got the can, he was giving over the head,\nbecause he knew with the can -- so I was very fast, I throwed away the can. So he saw everybody\nwas throwing away the cans, but anyway, he hit me, til today I have my ear damaged, but not\nbad. I\u2019m -- I can hear, I\u2019m not deaf. Okay. [phone ringing, tape break]. I\u2019m ca -- taking a little\nmag -- from everything, because to sit, to talk from everything, you will sit with me two years,\nand no writer 1s able to write a book if he wasn\u2019t in there. In between the camps was [speaks\nPolish] a difference. Some camps got a little better, some camps got bitter like worse than death.\nSo a woman cut up a piece from the undershirt and she was making a band around the head. And\nthis Lagerfuhrer checked all the time after the laundry, the -- the underwear. So he saw a shirt cut\noff a piece. So when we came back from work he\u2019s -- he didn\u2019t let us in. So I saw and now is\nsomething going on. So I took mine towel, because I was freezing, I put on my towel, and I was\nafraid if he is going to check and see me with the towel, is he going to kill me? I was so fast, I\nthrowed away the towel. [indecipherable] else did the same thing. But he is going to go into my\nroom and he s -- will see I didn\u2019t got the towel, so he will find me, so he will say what I did. I did\nnot right, but I -- I did too. So finally in a few minutes, he found the woman with the little piece\non the hat. And he took it in and he let us in. So I looked -- I looked -- in one second I was in the\nhouse and I took from another bed a towel and I put on my bed the towel. So I took from an old\nwoman, a very nice, intelligent woman, a old woman, I took the towel from her. So I said to her,\nlisten, he would believe you, because you were -- you was in the kitchen, so don\u2019t cry. If\nsomebody took, he will save -- he will try to save his life. She understood me. I took the t -- I\ntook the towel. So he gave I don\u2019t know how many with a rubber pipe on her two muscles, naked\nmuscles. The cuts was deep more than a quarter of a inch. This woman was screaming a half a\nnight, the rest of, I think she died. Because I tell you the truth, to go to look, I wasn\u2019t able. To\nhelp, I couldn\u2019t. So I was thinking, she\u2019s dying now, later I will die. I walked out of th -- and to\nwork, I came back, she wasn\u2019t there. I think she died [indecipherable] throwed her to -- to -- to\nsomeplace and that\u2019s it, okay. This was one. And now Erma and Mengele took me to work. I was\nwatching them very careful because I was afraid of the two murders. They got a shepherd, a\nGerman shepherd. He was trained like a SS man. They didn\u2019t told him anything, only they\nlooked. He went to this woman what they looked. He didn\u2019t left her before he -- she was dead. In\nthe most was Hungarian womens, because the Polish we were able to suffer, but not the\nHungarians. The Hungarians got a little better than we got, not in the camp, before the war. With\neducation, with life, with everything. They got a -- a better life than we got. So the whole time I\nheard screaming [indecipherable] the Polish people, they didn\u2019t cry, they didn\u2019t scream, only\nShema Israel, and that\u2019s it. So with us was a little girl from 14 years. Up to the wall what he took\nme, I will explain to you, but I don\u2019t know how to say. In German the [indecipherable] we got\nbranches with leaves, with wire and we was tying to each other and making a carpet to cover the\nroofs against the air raid. So this little girl was with us. So Erma took a piece of paper and she\nmaked a little bag and she put in black whole peppers. She went to -- over to the little girl and\nshe gave her peppers to eat. From the beginning the girl was crying Mamashi, Papashi,\nBubbashi, Zeidashi, God. Later she throwed her down and she opened her little bag and pushed\nher into the mouth. And the little girl had to swallow this. Later she kicked her with her feet to\nthe wall, and she tooked us out of this place to another place. Okay, what else? I -- I -- \u2019m\ntelling you the -- the most things, because to tell you stories, we never get through, because I\u2019m\ntalking with my husband and I would -- don\u2019t believe in it. I said Nathan, this is true? This can\nhappen? To be six wa -- weeks with no water and not to take a bath a whole year? This can be\ntrue? My husband said, I can\u2019t believe by myself, but I went through. Later -- yes. I was in a\nblock, the col -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the rooms what we all -- blocks.",
        "Q: How many people in a room?",
        "A: A thousand. They pushed in how ma -- how many they put? We were laying like herring,\npressed. In the nighttime the Ukrainians came in to take off that you wouldn\u2019t -- shoes too. So\nwe were w-walking barefoot to [indecipherable] and the snow. Screamed? They would kill us.\nSo they -- to come in in the night and they took off the shoes from us. So over there was a girl\nfrom Czechoslovakia, her name was Pessella. Believe me, I didn't make my life a\n[indecipherable] I didn\u2019t, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to make. But if you would Pessella here and you\nwould give me a knife, I would able to stay to [indecipherable] small pieces for months til she\nwould die. Such a murder, with -- from the Germans you wouldn\u2019t able to find, never. She was\nbeating us to death. So in the nighttime they took us out for say l\u2019appel. Say l\u2019appel they were\ncounting us. Rain, snowing, we were staying hours til the SS man came to count us. So when the\nSS man came, she showed off. She said the [indecipherable]. You understand this? What are\ntibel?\nA2: Devil.",
        "A: The devil will kill us. He said [indecipherable] because he got mad, because she\n[indecipherable] us, you Jewish too. He said, [indecipherable] you too. So she closed her pisk.\nSo the SS man took us to work. So I was thinking with my sister not to go into this block any\nmore, because this was -- I -- I more than truly killed her. I more than truly. I never saw in my\nlife such a murder. And she was fat. Big [indecipherable] they got everything. They got the\nmens, they got sex, they got everything there. Only th-the -- the -- the stubovas, blochovas, the\n[indecipherable] they make the life, they are, yes. They were making a life on our -- on our --\nthey were eating us up. They didn\u2019t gave us this ration what he gave us. The Pessella was\n[indecipherable]. Nice hair, no, but she was a murder, my God. How can be between Jews such a\n[indecipherable]? Okay, I more than sure they killed her. Hundred percent. Even she went back\nto Czechoslovakia, over there the -- killed her, because this was the worst blochova\n[indecipherable]. So I walked into another block. Was a lock -- they didn\u2019t recognized if you\nbelonged here, you belonged there, only they count every time the -- yeah, numbers we had. So I\nwalked in with my sister to another block. Not a -- a-all of them were good, but not like Pessella.\nThey were beating -- they got sticks from five, six meters and they\u2019re all giving over the heads\nlike this and another one got the a -- a -- open head. But Pessella was the worst. So I was sitting\nwith my dau -- with my daughter, God bless her til 120 -- with mine sister, my sister died in\nspring, after the war. We were [indecipherable] the 15th of April liberated and my sister got TB\nall over the body. So they took her to Sweden and she died June the 17\", 1945, 27 years old. So\nthat smart girl, how she worked for our parents. She was the best from all of us, from our\nparents. For each holiday I asked a coat, a dress, shoes, but not she. But what she did when I was\noutside, she put on -- she was very close to me, she put on my dress. And I walked in the street\nand I saw she\u2019s wearing my dress. Not in the street I wouldn\u2019t make nothing. When I came\nhome, I start to fight with her. So my father said, do me a favor, take a few dollars and go\noutside, buy material and make for yourself a dress and a coat. You know what this girl did? She\ntook the few dollars, she bought for my father -- this was for special Hassidic people, a\n[indecipherable] summer -- summer coat, let\u2019s say and for my mother a coat and she got 80 cents\nleft over, she bought Skombra. Skombra was the best sardines in our country, we got good\nsardines, better than we have here, from [indecipherable] the good. So this was 80 cents, so she\nbought for 80 cents father -- for my father the Skombras. This what she did for our parents and\nfor our small, little boy. I didn\u2019t. I was working, I gave in the money, but all the time I asked, I\nneed a dress, I need shoes, I need a coat and I got. But she never asked, never. But when she\nwent out, she put a -- she put on mines. So I said, I can be the good one too. I am th-th-the -- the\nbad one because I am asking for clothes, we didn\u2019t got enough money. And you don\u2019t want it,\nyou [indecipherable] you wearing mines. So we got a fight all over this, yes.",
        "Q: Any other stories before liberation?",
        "A: Before liberation? Oy, I will prepare, I will prepare more. I have so much. Sometimes when\nI\u2019m not sleeping, I\u2019m thinking over if this is true, if such educated, high educated people like the\nGermans, they were the first educated people. China was the first, but the modern country was\nGermany and they were able to do people like that. But one thing I will tell you when\n[indecipherable] when I was liberated, I wasn\u2019t able to walk, I was laying on the floor. So I was\nliberated by the British. So a soldier gave me a newspaper and I was so dumb, I didn't save this\nnewpas -- newspaper. In the newspaper I read about 400 years ago, this same thing happened to\nFrankfurt am Main. They throwed out the childrens from the windows, they throwed out the\nfurnitures from the windows. The -- the chambers in [indecipherable] you still able to see what\nthey put in the Jews. So the -- th-the walls having openings. So in the wintertime they were\nfreezing, they got typhoid, they got lice and they didn\u2019t got nothing to eat. So were two mens,\nAdolf Stoecker was Hitler. Adolf Stoecker and who was the other one, Nathan?\nA2: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I do rem -- remind myself. The other one was secretly going to rich friends and collecting\nmoney, three quarter from the population from Frankfurt am Main died, but the leftover, he took\nout from the chambers, you can see the chambers still today in Wiesbaum , this is very close to\nFrankfurt am Main, I was there, I saw it. And he gave each a little bit money and he told them to\ngo to look to the apartments if they are empty, to go in and he helped them to go in a little\nbusiness to build up again a life. Petmilch was the good one. Adolf Stoecker was Hitler, Petmilch\nwas saving the rest, few Jews what they left -- were leftover from the get -- from the chambers,\nno gas chambers, only chambers they were laying with no food, with no a -- with no sanitary.\nThey died of typhus, they died from starvation. A few got leftover, so he took them out and he\nsaved the few Jews, Petmilch. And I got the newspaper and why I didn\u2019t save the newspaper like\nthis, but I was very sick, very sick.",
        "Q: Tell us more about the liberation, the day of liberation.",
        "A: Yes. They took us one time to carry stones.",
        "Q: This is the British?",
        "A: I was in Bergen-Belsen, and I was re -- by the British in Bergen-Belsen. Frankfurt was\nAmerica, but Bergen-Belsen was the British. We didn\u2019t got so good after war by the British here,\nwe didn\u2019t got enough wood. So we were carrying five bricks, three, four, five blocks.",
        "Q: This is after liberation?",
        "A: No, this was before the liberation. So some girls got weak. I got weak by myself. So they let\ndown the bricks. You know what they did to them? They punished them, they had to put the --\nthe hand to -- in the back and to carry the bricks in the back. And if they wouldn\u2019t able to bring\nto the place the ba -- there, they punished them, I don\u2019t know them any more and I didn\u2019t -- I\ndidn\u2019t see them any more. Okay, this is what. Later, they took me to dig trees. So I was digging\ntrees with the woods. So I was very careful, the wood -- the -- the trees were batti -- 10 me-\nmeters high, eight meters high, very high. So sometimes we got SS la -- SS men started -- helped\na little bit. We got a big stick with a hook to put in the hook in the tree and to pull, but to make to\nfall [indecipherable] wood. But some of them were murders. They rushed you, so you forgot that\nthe bu -- that the tree falls [indecipherable] and they -- they killed her. So I was careful, I was\nwatching which way the tree is going, so I was standing on the other side. And I runned away\nand I left the stick with the hook in the tree. So one time he came over to me and he said, don\u2019t\ndo this again. If not I will punish you. You must take out the hook before the tree 1s falling.\nOkay. I said danke schoen [indecipherable] okay. Later, a few days later we got a nice little bit --\na -- nice trees were prepared and I didn\u2019t know they\u2019re burning over there the bodies\n[indecipherable] in Bergen-Belsen we didn't got gas chambers. But we were putting the trees like\nthis. In the middle, we put in the dead bodies. So when I passed with the group to work, I saw\nmens working. So one was screaming Lodz [indecipherable]. So old man said Lodz, I said Lodz.\nAnd he told me the name. This was one place what they got the nice ta -- beautiful s -- woolen\nsweaters. Very rich, modern Hassidic people. So I asked him if he 1s, and he said yes. When I\npassed back, he was dead. He worked so hard there, okay. So later, they piled up the dead people\ntil -- til [indecipherable]. So they got me to bring the dead people closer. So they put in blankets\n-- | had to put in blankets, four girls. What I saw, I am falling. I -- I-I am fall. So I said to the\nthree girls, listen. Listen, let\u2019s look around. If we will see nobody, run away. He is dead anyway.\nSo we left the dead body, we runned away. But where can I hide? Every day they were looking\nfor -- fo-for the girls to carry the dead body to bring there to-to -- to the trees. So every time we\ndid the same thing. How long we were able to -- how -- not to pick up on, to reach off -- yeah. So\nthe -- the blanket got a hole, so he falled out, the dead. So we runned away again. We couldn\u2019t\npick up the dead, we couldn\u2019t do anything, we runned away. But we got [indecipherable] after\nwe did [indecipherable]. Later -- yeah, one time I saw a man with a little knife and he cut the\nmuscle from the dead out. But I wasn\u2019t smart enough to think he\u2019s gonna eat ous -- this, or to\ncook, I don\u2019t know. Later I saw another one, he cut the belly, he took th -- a liver. At that time I\nwasn\u2019t afraid of the dead, I wasn\u2019t afraid of -- of anything, nothing was bothering me. Okay.\nAfter we -- so, we got concentration Bergen-Belsen, a city Bergen-Belsen, a military camp\nBergen-Belsen. So brought us over to the military camp. So at least we got showers. So one day\nwas for the mens to shower, one day was for the womens and we got sinks to wash a little bit\n[indecipherable]. And, excuse me, I got diarrhea because I was running to the kitchen. And a\nEnglish soldier gave me -- from a can, was very fat, cabbage with th -- with -- with fat, and I ate\nthis and I shouldn\u2019t because I was in sad shape. So I got very, very bad diarrhea. And I was\nsitting in the woods and I took three breaks like this and I got a can [indecipherable] was like\ngraham crackers. So ge -- ga -- ba -- he gave us in the morning for breakfast two crackers with a\nlittle bit chocolate cocoa, but I will tell you what the Jews did to the cocoa. The kitchens what\nthey cooked the -- th-the cocoa for us, they didn\u2019t put in this what the English give them, they\nsold to the Germans for diamonds and for money. And for us they give a little bit water. The\ncrackers, the two, they had to give us. Okay. We were marching, because we were starving, later\nthey put out garbage cans, but clean ones, new ones, with meat, with noodles, what this was\nstaying a whole day outside, was mushy, but I didn\u2019t got [indecipherable] I ate. But our Jews,\nlisten, it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s good to go to the synagogue, the Jews, not to eat from one plate, on a\nseparate plate that nothing will take the bigger piece. The Jews make the [indecipherable] there.\nTh-the -- the Jews, but they were still a little bit healthier, they walked into the kitchens to work,\nso they make money, they sold to the Germans. They took diamonds and gold and everything.\nThe rabbi from England, he took home a whole set with gold and diamonds. I wasn\u2019t afraid,\nwhen he came in, the doctor, I was very sick. So I got luck, a doctor from Holland, a very young\nman, he was in the army, he came in and he saw I have water a-all over my body.",
        "Q: Where -- where was this now?",
        "A: Bergen-Belsen.",
        "Q: In the town of Bergen-Belsen?",
        "A: In -- in -- in this -- not town --",
        "Q: The military?",
        "A: -- in boy -- in the military. So he said to me, I will bring pills for the water, but for the iron I\ndon\u2019t have pills in here. So I said to him, the Germans runned out on the drugstores, so they\nemptied the drugstores [indecipherable] the rabbi -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the doctors go to the\ndrugstores to take the leftover what they left. He looked at me and he didn\u2019t answer me. But he\nleft a note for the blochova. Blochova was the leader from the -- from the house. She was still in\ngood shape after they were talking about her too, but I don\u2019t know. She was from Pietkow -- a\nnote to give to the rabbi from England. Kaplan was the rabbi, he was the army rabbi, to give me\na white bread, to give me a little bit milk and a little bit meat. So the rabbi came to see me. See,\nhe brought for me a piece of meat and a potato, a little bit soup, and he told me, he said listen,\nthis is kosher, this is teah, but no Shochet. I said to him, and now I don\u2019t care about anything, I\nwould like to go out from bed. If I would be able to walk out from bed, I would help myself. So I\n-- the potato I ate, the soup I drank, but the meat was so dry and hard, like a rock. So I said,\nthank you, Rabbi, I can\u2019t even eat it. He said, I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t have a grounder, I can\u2019t do\nanything more. Thank you. Okay. So the doctor came in and he ask me, I said, yes, the rabbi\n[indecipherable] me a meal, but a meal I can\u2019t eat because the meat is so hard and dry, I couldn\u2019t\neat. So he left another note. This doctor sent home a prescription to his family -- the war was still\ngoing on [indecipherable] for iron pills, and he gave me iron pills what his family sent to him.",
        "Q: Do you remember his name?",
        "A: No, no. Hoita shtabi. Every day I said to him, Doctor, hoita shtabi. So I walked in the street\nwhen I got a little bit better, I still got what -- I still wa-was bit like this. So he walked with\nfriends, he stopped me and he stopped the friends. He said to them, this lady said to me every\nday hoita shtabi. Take a look. Isn\u2019t she looking good? Okay. But this way I went to --",
        "Q: What does that expression mean that you -- the hoita shtabi, what is --",
        "A: Today I gonna die.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: I met a girl and I met my brother\u2019s -- a friend and they were planning to go to Poland to see if\nwe have left over something. I said, I will go with you, and I went and I was sick and we traveled\ntwo weeks. But, in each city we had to go to see, let\u2019s say like in there the [indecipherable] like\nthe mayor. So we went in to the mayor and we asked him to give us food.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: -- okay. So we went in to the mayor. We ask people where he 1s located, they told us, we went\nto him. He gave us food, bread, bologna or salami and -- and not butter, margarine. So we\nwalked into a store to try to say [indecipherable] I don\u2019t have. So the man said, please go out. I\ngonna check that. So she was afraid, she was bringing more than t -- we got on the -- on -- on --\non the piece of paper. Okay. We finished this, we went to another city again to the -- the mayor.\nSo we got food to eat til Czechoslovakia. We came into Czechoslovakia, the police took us by\nthe border. I saw people with yellow stars and I was like this, he said, don\u2019t worry. This is the\npeople what they did to you. We put them the yellow stars and give [indecipherable] working,\nlike you. Okay. So we asked them we would like to come into the city. He said no, you can\u2019t\ncome into the city, you have to see a doctor before. So I got luck. They took me in to a doctor,\nbut he came with a -- two days before from concentration camp. He saw I am sick and I told him\nI am going to Poland. So I got the wooden shoes, but [indecipherable] so I got tight with wire.\nStockings I didn\u2019t got on. I don\u2019t know if this was his girlfriend or this was his wife, he told her\nto give me up her stockings, she brought up her stockings. He asked a policeman to go and bring\nme a pair shoes. He went, he brought the shoes. He told him bigger ones. Okay [indecipherable]\nmens shoes. And he told him to bring us to a place, to give us good -- prepare a good night\u2019s\nsleep and to give us something to eat. He didn\u2019t got nothing, only a few potatoes, I think. That\u2019s\nwhat he got, he gave us, and we slept good. In the morning we walked out from over there,\nbecause we were free, no policemen, the doctor said I am okay. So I saw a stand staying outside\nlike in Europe with the vegetables on. So I wasn't able to -- first of all I didn't got the money. So\nI went over closer to look. So the [indecipherable] was such a good woman, she took from\neverything and she put in mine bag, because I was making a bag from --\nA2: [indecipherable]",
        "A: [indecipherable] A blanket. I have to tell you, I -- I cut out a hole and I got the skirt. From the\nleftover I make the jacket. Believe me, the sleeve what should be at the top, I got on the bottom.\nI wasn\u2019t a dressmaker. And from the leftover I was making a bag. I's -- had no money, because\n[indecipherable] in Polish 1s a little [indecipherable] okay. So we walked to a train -- we were\nwalked in in a train and I walked into the train but this was a nice train. I walked into the train, I\nsaw a good looking man was dressed in leather, a very short jacket, nice pants and he looked to\nme Yiddish, but I didn\u2019t said anything. The other one, I saw he is ous. And they were playing\nnice there, accordion nice, and singing nice. So this good looking gentleman asked us where we\nare going. Well, we told him we are from concentration camp, we would like to go to Poland, to\nLodz to see if we will have somebody. So he came over very slowly and he said, I am\n[indecipherable]. [indecipherable] means Jewish. I said, are you a [indecipherable]? He said yes.\nThis man sent the other one to bring bread, food. He was sitting with us on the train til the train\nstart to move.

I\nwill do for you everything, you give me the names. But we didn\u2019t listen to him. So he gave me a\nfew packs cigarettes, but the Russian cigarettes wasn\u2019t so expensive like the Americans. But\nanyway, a few cents I got. And he gave me, I don\u2019t remember, 400 zloty, I think I brought with\nme, he gave me. [indecipherable] came to Poland for two days enough, okay.",

        "A: Okay. So when I came to Poland with the girl, so a friend from the block -- from the block,\nfrom Bergen-Belsen gave me an address from her brother-in-law, but he was a very religious\nman, her f -- her father was a mohel. So when I came into this place -- so this place looked like\nthis, mort with stones til the ceiling in the middle room. His bed was a iron bed but no legs, on s\n-- on bricks, covered he was with a black blanket. The pillow -- I can\u2019t tell you, I don\u2019t know\nwhat color the pillow got. But I saw a man [indecipherable] religious, what we gonna do here?\nAnd so he said, don\u2019t worry. I am a baker. I am going away for the whole night. In the daytime\nyou both can sleep here, and in the morning I will come and you -- I will give you\n[indecipherable] you will cook our soup and we will eat together. In the morning I opened my\neyes, I saw the man 1s praying and two peyat with him, he wa -- is from the religious people.\nAnd a full table with [indecipherable]. I didn\u2019t saw this for years. He said to us, ladies, you can\nclose the door and get dressed and say [indecipherable] and come in and eat rolls. We did it. We\nate a few rolls he gave us, I don\u2019t know how much money. We go -- went to the store, we bought\nbarley, we bought [indecipherable] beans, potatoes and we came up, he got a big pot and we\nmake a bu -- a big pot with soup. I think he got a little bit oil, too. And he was so happy with the\n-- with the -- with the soup, he blessed us. So in the daytime I was with her walking outside. So I\nwalked and I saw a young man follows us, because after the war the po -- the Polish people\nkilled the Jews what they came back from concentration camp. So I passed the other side. I saw\nhe is passing too. I said, and now we are dead. I said, I don\u2019t want to walk no longer. I will stay\nand I will see what\u2019s -- what\u2019s going to happen. This boy came closer and he called in my name.\nI forgot his name. I said, you was a yeshiva boy. How come this you are going and now wi-with\n[indecipherable]? No Jews never did it.

And I opened the door. She was\n[indecipherable]. And this boy was such a nice boy. He asked me if I have money. I said, I don\u2019t\nneed money, no. He said, I -- I need something. I said no, I have two breads. And I forgot to tell\nyou, this Russian told the Russian other one to give us enough bro -- bro -- bread, so I got two\nbreads and I was afraid to touch the breads because he told me I will starve in then -- in Lodz.\nAnd I told him I have two breads. He said, I am engaged and I will get married this week and I\nam going to Germany. He 1s leaving with his wife to Germany. He came out with his girlfriend\nand she brought a bag with cookies, with candies [indecipherable]. And he ask me again if I need\nmoney. I said no. I think he left something under the pillow, I think so, but I fa -- I can\u2019t --\nforget. But my fr -- girlfriend said, do you know who wa -- who wa -- who is alive? I looked at\nher, I was thinking she is going to say something -- she said, Chaim.

[indecipherable] said thank God, I -- but I said Chaim,\nyou must take her in here too, because she is sleeping in a hallway and the rain is coming\nthrough to her bed. But he said okay. So she came in and we were sleeping. To be honest with\nyou, I didn\u2019t got nothing to put on, so he -- I told him my sister died, I told him. So he was\nthinking I will marry him. See, he was so good, he said [speaks Polish here] I don\u2019t know if he\nbought a nightgown, or I went out to buy a nightgown, I bought a nightgown. And -- no, I think\nmy girlfriend gave me.

Only thing I know, I have the -- that letter from Stockholm. So I was foolish, I didn\u2019t\nmark my -- the address. I gave him the letter and I don\u2019t have the address for where my sister is\nburied. I gave him the letter from Stockholm what I received. She died the -- June the 17\", and\nwhere she is buried.

I told him I can\u2019t sew, I\ndon\u2019t know sewing. And this was an electric machine, I never saw an electric machine. I took a\nstop -- I put on round. And the girls didn\u2019t know I\u2019m Polish because Scranton is coal mines, most\nare Polish, so they heard my Polish, so they were friendly to me. So he bringed me to bri -- make\nsleeves, a seam. This he showed me, I was able -- but he didn't told me this 1s coming in shades.\nThis was coming one, one, two, two.

My Malka\u2019s two childrens are good\nswimmers. Okay, so I gave them a good time, we traveled six days. So they looked fa -- so we\nbought -- I wa -- they -- we walked into the stores, they picked what they liked and we got in --\non -- on the highways we got tables, and I got a paper tablecloths, and tho -- I pleased them to\nbuy the stuff what they liked and we were eating. One day Maxie said, in Holiday Inn is a sale\ntoday, you can eat how much you want, I don\u2019t think -- two dollars or three dollars. So I walked\nin with my husband, and I said, listen, it\u2019s not kosher, we wouldn\u2019t eat, let them eat. So the two\nchildrens, they got wild. They were running back and forth and eating and eating and eating and\neating. I paid, I don\u2019t know six dollars or five dollar. So a man from this place came over to us\nand he said, so we have kosher salami and we have kosher bologna and you can have something\nto eat in here. So we took bologna and salami the kosher. bread, we were eating and I took -- I\nbought more on the way and they got a good time and we went. Later we go -- go -- going to the\nstores. We were going to cities, and the stores, but one time we got a little accident. We walked\ninto a little city not far from Tucson, Arizona, but this was only black. And we came into a hotel\nwith black [indecipherable] and I was afraid to walk out and I was afraid to stay. But I was\nthinking with my husband, we will sit the whole night and watch wi -- the childrens, we will pay\nfor the night and tomorrow we gonna walk out, but was Saturday.

So he said, listen, not far from here 1s a\nrabbi. But to be honest with you, we didn't go to the rabbi. We were waiting til the evening.\nWhat happened? We got a ti -- a flat -- a flat tire, I think, we stopped in this little city. So we got\nfixed the car and we traveled -- we trave -- [tape break] -- we went to Tucson. My Maxie was\nlonesome for the friends from Scranton, Pennsylvania. He went back to our friend. I paid him not\nmuch and he finished the high school in Tucson, Arizona.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So he went back and he finished high school. So we were residents in Tucson, Arizona, so I\ngot very cheap college, so I bought him to Tucson, he got mad because his friends went to Penn\nState and he was thinking I gonna send him, but I said, Maxie, I don\u2019t have the money, Daddy\u2019s\nsick, I\u2019m the supporter. Over there I made 110, in here I\u2019m making 50 dollars. Is one factory in\nthe whole city, so you ha -- must go here. So he got his [indecipherable] here, he was mad, but\nhe went to -- to the university. Okay. Malka finished the high school in Tucson, Arizona. Malka\nwas a honor student, she got a scholarship. My son got 20 points from psychology. From this he\ngot free from Vietnam, but for spite he didn\u2019t worked in the university like he worked in the high\nschool, so he make B plus, so Malka was fighting with him, she said, don\u2019t you know that\nMama\u2019s sick? Can\u2019t you make the plus? He said, I don\u2019t want to be the best student. But\nanyway, he traveled. When he got Bachelor degree, he walked out from the university and he\ntraveled to Europe and he got a friend in Holland. The friend went for a doctor there. I don\u2019t\nknow why he went to Holland, but he -- yeah, so when he walked out from, the dean of the men\ncalled me, he said, Mrs. Kalman, Max walked out and he\u2019s gonna go to Vietnam. And Max left\nTucson, Arizona. He didn\u2019t told me where he is going. Two days later I received, Maxie has to\ncome to stay here [indecipherable] I went over to my doctor to help me because I got cancer, I\ngot operation that time. He said, what I can do, I will do. I gonna call up the dean of the men, but\nthis wasn\u2019t enough. So th-the -- the first letter was 10 days, tomorrow I got another letter in two\ndays. So I announce on the radio, and I look on -- for Max Kalmanowicz all over. So he came\nover, he said, what\u2019s the matter with you people? I said, Max, where are you? In\n[indecipherable]. Stay. Wait for a man til he will take you to the police, or he will bring the\npoliceman to you. Then come with the policeman to Tucson, Arizona. If not you\u2019re gonna go to\nVietnam, you can -- you can -- you are not able to ha -- to -- to -- to -- to carry a gun. He got\nscared. He listened to me, he came to Tucson, Arizona with the policeman. But God bless my\ndaughter and my husband, they didn\u2019t tell me, he went to Phoenix, Phoenix is the capital. And\nover there the dean of the men took out from Scranton, his record from the high school and he\ngot the 20 points from psychology, he got free from the army. Okay, so later Maxie went back to\n-- yeah. So yo -- he wrote me a letter from Holland. He said, Mum, I\u2019m coming back to the\nuniversity. And Is -- I wrote him right away back, he -- I -- I will take maybe some\n[indecipherable] or what. I said listen, don\u2019t make this for me. Do this for you. If not you\u2019re\ngoing to go to a factory like I and Dad, and I don\u2019t want it -- you to go to a factory. In our\ncountry I wouldn\u2019t go to a factory, I was able to do something else.

And Malka got\nmarried and I left Tucson, Arizona, I sold the house and I moved to Israel because I got to please\nmy husband. He said about the States, I gonna stay in -- in America?

He -- he\nchanged, he is now making commercials and writing movies. But not -- not much money, he\nisn\u2019t making much money. The commercials was good, but 10 years ago.

My doctor -- they called my doctor, she said to the nurse, go over, take a\nlook what\u2019s happened to Chanka. But in the meantime I dressed myself and I walked out and I\nwas afraid to pass the street because I was shaking. So I asked a lady, I said, are you crossing\nthis street? She said yes.

Right away. I can tell you again, no writer in this\nworld, to me, to read a book from concentration camp is a nothing. Only if a man what he was in\nconcentration camp and he was in ghetto from 1939 til 1945, yes, this book you should read, this\nis true. But not all the camps were the same. Was worser and a little bit milder. I was in the\nworst. I was Auschwitz, I was in Bergen-Belsen. Bergen-Belsen was a camp not to talk. Six\nmonths, I was six there, at Bergen-Belsen. How I survived, I don\u2019t know. My daughter -- my\nsister died. My daughter til 120. She died in Sweden. So what else you da -- you remind me a\nlittle bit because I\u2019m a little, you know.",

        "A: A Friday --",
        "A: A Friday in the morning I was washing the floor and I heard like noise. This place when --\nwhere we lived was close from a highway. I opened the door, I saw horses, wagons, soldiers, and\nI wasn\u2019t afraid. I stood in the door and I looked. They were all passing, and I was standing and\nlooking. But they didn\u2019t anything to us, nothing. For hours they walked and walked and walked\nand walked. So I got tired, I walked into the house. My mother lived across the street. She came\nover and she said, you know, I am afraid to stay here. Let\u2019s go to my youngest sister\u2019s in-laws,\nthey live more the Jews together, let\u2019s go to them. What the Jews gonna do? We will be between\nthem. So I said, that\u2019s a good idea, but let\u2019s wait for a few days, let\u2019s take a little bit with us, we\ncan walk out like this. I got a small baby.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: My baby was born \u201939 -- \u201939, January 25\".",
        "A: Yankov, after my father. And so --",
        "A: Yes, and I got the radio in the door and I heard in the radio Alexandria was a special place for\nthe [indecipherable] Hassidim, they got [indecipherable] there. So I heard on the radio\nAlexandria is to -- lost -- how you saying, they -- they chased them out from over there. So I\nopened the door and I looked, I saw Jews. Womens childrens, with packages -- not like today,\nsuitcases, packages. I stood and I stopped one and I said, what\u2019s going on? She said, don\u2019t you\nknow? They chased us out from the city. They had to leave everything, only what I had behi --\nbe -- be -- close to the hand, that stuff I took. And we don\u2019t know where we are going. I was\nthinking maybe the people don\u2019t know what they talking, but how to believe? So I got a neighbor\nin the same house. He was a educated man and he read the papers, listened to the news. I said,\nMr. Shejak, come out, take a look. He was in the back. Take a look what\u2019s going on outside. He\ncame out with his wife, with his two sons. He stopped one man, he stopped another man, he\nstopped a third man. He said, it\u2019s no good. They have to leave. So I walked over to my mother\nand I said to mama, you know what\u2019s going on? Alexandria, the Jews from Alexandria are\nmoving out, they can\u2019t stay any longer there. So she said okay, let\u2019s go. Yeah, in the meantime,\nwe heard airplanes. I didn\u2019t saw the bombs, but people said they throwed down either a bomb or\ntwo, but I didn\u2019t hear it and I didn\u2019t saw it. So I took th-th-the important things and we went to\nmine si -- younger sister\u2019s in-laws. And we stood there. Over there we heard bombs and they had\nshooting, they had [indecipherable], we had everything. But a few days when the Germans\nsettled in Lodz was a little quiet so we went back home. On way, on two days, they hanged 10\nJews. This was in a cheaper neighborhood, but the most poor Jews lived this -- in this\nneighborhood. And the Jews was the most religious, and a few rich. So the 10 Jews hanged a few\ndays to show the Jews in Lodz what\u2019s going to happen. So that time was time to run out to -- to\nRussia, and I was the one, but I said to my whole family, even to my older brother, I still have a\nfew dollars. From the bank I couldn\u2019t take out, but was a Gentile family, I don\u2019t know if they\nwere anti-Semitic or not, they dealed with Jews to make a dollar. So she said, I can go into the\nbank. Give me the book and I will bring. I think she bringed a little bit, how much she took for\nherself, I don\u2019t know. She gave me a few dollars, that I remember like now.\nA2: Zlotys.",
        "A: Zlotys, yeah. So I said to my mother and to my brother, let\u2019s take a little bit [indecipherable]\npossibly, and let\u2019s go to Russia. So my mother said, the childrens wouldn\u2019t say kaddish after\n[indecipherable] and I don\u2019t want to eat treif and I don\u2019t want to go to Russia. So I got a small\nbaby by myself, I couldn\u2019t go. I should, I was able, but I was staying with the family. So later,\nmy youngest sister went to see Russia. So she was with a very nice Gentile man, and she was --\nshe was pregnant the time. And she was laying by the border a few days and she came back and\nshe said to me, Chanka, forget about Russia, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on over there. The\nGermans are staying there too, and they\u2019re [indecipherable] together with the anti-Semitishi\nPolacks and they\u2019re beating the Jews to death, they\u2019re taking away everything. I said to her, let\nthem take away everything, but let\u2019s come alive to Russia. We are gonna build up a little bit and\nwe will be alive. But she said I\u2019m not going any more. She got the baby in the ghetto, was\nterrible. I was working in the [indecipherable] do you know what\u2019s on there? This was the\neducated boys, they stepped in in the police and you were working for the SS. They knew the --\nwhich places to show them to take out the leftover -- th-th-the -- everything from the Jews, so\nthey ma -- they built up our beautiful can-cantina and the SS came down t-to eat and they --\nsome they came to eat, was outside a 200 girl -- womens -- girls, because they need workers and\nI was standing in the line. I don\u2019t know if this is from God, or this was luck, or my father, they\npicked me and I worked in the canteen.",
        "A: To the ghetto, 1940. 1940. The ghetto was closed 1940. From the beginning I was doing\nbusiness, I bought cheese for my dau -- for my sister\u2019s in-laws and I bring them in. I have a\nblock to [indecipherable] to make only sweet stuff. So how much I asked, for the cheese, he gave\nme. So I was thinking, tomorrow I [indecipherable] ask double. So tomorrow I came, was no\nmore cheese, was closed the ghetto and that\u2019s all.",
        "A: A room. You got one room for a whole family. So my mother was with three childrens, I was\nwith the baby, my sister with her husband with a baby, my brother with the wife with a baby. But\nthis was a big room, we managed. We were together. Later, my yo -- my younger brother saw\nit\u2019s not good, we gonna die anyway, from starvation. So he signed himself to go to work. So his\nwife went over to her mother, while my brother went to Poznan. This was the worst place what\nthey killed the Jews there.",
        "A: This was Moishe, the third one. So Moishe wrote us a letter. He said, I [indecipherable] you\nknow Koplevich. This was a neighbor, a good friend. In the war, people what they maked the\nnice living, but in the wartime we got mixed up, we didn\u2019t know what to do, so she sent with her\nhusband back to Tomaszow Mazowiecki with -- with the merchandise, with -- with the clothes,\nwith everything. So he died there with the clothes, and we died here they didn\u2019t got clothes, so\nhe -- th-th-the boy was starving, so he signed his name to go to -- to go to Poznan. So over there\nhe died, and my bur -- my brother buried him. So my brother got luck. A German girl falled in\nlove with him -- he was a very religious boy, but he changed later. She brought him back to\nghetto. But in the ghetto was a place what nobody was able to go in, only Rimkowsky with the\npolice, with the SS. She brought him into this place. She walked over to Rimkowsky, she said, I\nwant you to give him a good job. And don\u2019t send him out. And he gave him a good job and he\nhelped us a little bit, yes. But anyway, the ghetto liquidate, he went with his wife and the child,\nthey didn\u2019t came back.",
        "A: This was 19 -- 1945 and the ghetto liquidated --",
        "A: -- no, ni -- 1944.",
        "A: Oh, it was terrible, the ghetto was terrible, terrible.",
        "A: That\u2019s what I\u2019m telling you. I worked in the canteen.",
        "A: [helped a little bit.",
        "A: I -- I -- we got frozen potatoes, so I said to my brother-in-law, to my sister\u2019s husband, you\nstay by the window and you watch. If nobody\u2019s ga -- walking around, and I will prepare a sack\nwith a little bit potatoes and I will give you up from the window, because this is anyway going to\nthe garbage. I did. So my mother was grounding this on a grounder and making a soup from it,\nso they got something to eat. Later they liquidate the canteen, so he gave me -- the manager from\nthe canteen was a very nice man. So he said Chanka, I gonna give you a good place, you gonna\ngo into our kitchen. And he gave me a good kitchen [indecipherable] over there to most -- to\nbringed in -- the planes came into [indecipherable] and the mans was emptying the trains and a\nlittle bit poor workers three-quarter dead people came for the soup there too, and I worked there.\nAnd that time they brought from Germany, from [indecipherable] from Czechoslovakia, from --\nthe most from Germany, Czechoslovakia -- we got someplace else? No, Germany, ch-\nCzechoslovakia, they brought in the Jews, naked, barefoot and the German Jews wasn\u2019t used to a\nlife like we got in Poland. They got all convenience, they got beautiful life. I was there and I\nsaw. What can I tell you? I got sick from seeing the way like they were dying like flies.",
        "A: In the ghetto. They wasn\u2019t used to go outside to the bathroom, they got inside. And Poland\nwas very cold because this is very close to Russia, 24 hours from the Russia border. So I was\nwatching a couple, they were standing outside and they got a little bit hot water in a thermos, and\nthey got cold hand, they were -- so his pants was on the floor, he wasn\u2019t able to pick up her pa --\nunderwear, so I said, I will -- gonna walk out and I will see to -- what I can do to get -- I walked\nout. The man was dying in -- in -- in -- in -- so I pulled up the pants. I told him, hold the pants\nand walk into the place because they gave them little rooms from the Polish people. And to her, I\nhelped her pick up th-the pants. Almost -- she didn\u2019t drop that, but I wasn\u2019t able to -- to carry\nthem. And my job was to give them three times a day, soups. So believe me, I\u2019m not making my\nname nice, or myself nice. I put in in each soup a hamburger. We had to make for them a\nhamburger, but I put in another one. They blessed me. I was afraid, I told them, go, go. Go, don\u2019t\nbless me, now go, go, because I was afraid the manager will hear. But he found out, but he did\nnothing to me, anything. I don\u2019t know what happened to him, they took him out with his wife.\nHe was [indecipherable] Rabinovich, he was a nice man. And he didn\u2019t tell me anything, he saw\nwhat I\u2019m doing. So I worked on [indecipherable] a few months. So my sister got a friend, the\nmother and the father, I don\u2019t know if they died, or they killed them, so the two girls were left in\nthe house and they were starving, cold. The water was freezing in the houses. I got frozen water\nin my house, too. My little boy was laying in bed, locked it outside, the lock and I put a coloring\nbook on a -- a tray, but his -- [indecipherable] was so --",
        "A: [sobbing] was running. And I told him, I said, Yankovek, if somebody will knock in the door,\ndon\u2019t answer. He was so smart, he was so afraid. He didn\u2019t answer it. But the doctor, I told him\nfor I\u2019m putting the key because he got a little hole in the right side in the lung. So the doctor\ncame, he took the key, he opened him -- examined him, and he said to -- he said, Yankovek,\ndon\u2019t eat up your mother\u2019s bread, because your mother\u2019s gonna die and who is gonna take care\nof you? Because he couldn\u2019t eat his soups because he was sick, so I gave him my piece of bread.\nBut from that time on he didn't want it. He said, Mama, I am afraid, I don\u2019t want it. I said\nYankovek, I have food, I\u2019m eating. I\u2019m eating carrots, I\u2019m eating vegetables, I\u2019m eating. Well, to\nmake short the story I -- the canteen got closed, the kitchens, they maked a little less, we got a --\na little more so [indecipherable] how it was [indecipherable] yeah, they start to send out from\nLodz, the ghetto, the people. So every day we got less at work. One time I looked down and I\u2019m\nby myself. But I had to prepare the potatoes for tomorrow. And I took out the pails from the\npotatoes to the garbage. I saw a man is walking down, but I wasn\u2019t afraid because the light was -\n- wasn\u2019t [indecipherable] anyway. So I don\u2019t think -- I wasn\u2019t thinking if it\u2019s a Jew or\n[indecipherable] a Gentile, or nothing. I did my work and I closed the door. And I was wearing\nwooden shoes and a scarf over my head and a black coat what I got for my wedding. And I had\nto pass the cemetery. Today if you would give me the whole world money, I wouldn\u2019t walk on a\ncemetery, but that time I was so careful because was costas, you know, like -- like growing hard\n[indecipherable] like little peas. So [indecipherable] so I [indecipherable] touched my coat. So I\nwas afraid [indecipherable] so I took my coat like this and this way I walked, so nothing touched\nme, and I came out to the road and I came home. My mother was sitting and saying\n[indecipherable]. We -- we got a [indecipherable] from [indecipherable] this was a very big\n[indecipherable] I wer -- this wasn\u2019t -- he lees -- lived in Tredia. We were on his grave. They\nlived in -- 21 year in Israel and she was praying for me to come home to the baby. So I came\nhome, I bringed with me a little bit. \u2019'd bring with me a little bit. If they would catch me, they\nwould give me right away to the Germans, but I wasn\u2019t thinking of anything. I bring -- I got in\nthat dress a pocket in here, a pocket in here, so I got the -- a little meatball in here, a little\nmeatball in here, something else, maybe two. So I gave my mother and I gave a half to my\nsister\u2019s boy, little boy and to mine. Later, they liquidate over there, too. So, if I walked out to\nwork, I wasn\u2019t sure if I will come back because they -- how you say [indecipherable] so if -- they\nwas looking for people. So they hop from the street, so I never was sure if I will come back. But\nI don\u2019t know, maybe because I was good to my parents, I came home. One time was\n[indecipherable] loss, only police and firemens, high officials with the wives, they could stay. So\nI got a neighbor on the first floor-- not educated people, they didn\u2019t know an-any Yiddishkeit,\nand we were friends with them. Her husband was a fireman. Well she -- and I got -- received a\nletter to come with my little baby out from -- from Lodz to death. In the meantime, she came up\nand she said, Chanka, will you do me a favor? My husband is very sick. I think he has\npneumonia, I can\u2019t leave him alone. Go to the matzos -- they are -- they were baking matzos, so\nonly the police and the firemens need to go to the matzos. So I came there on Dunkelman, not on\nmy name, on her name. And he came to look. A man -- he became a policeman and he was our\nneighbor and he showed me a list, he said, I would like to break my -- my legs. I have to go to\ntake a few womens with childrens. I saw my name, but I didn\u2019t told him anything. So I was\nwalking with this [indecipherable] because he was a policeman. And her -- her father was -- they\nlived upstairs [indecipherable] bring down their sick father, they throw them into the wagon.\nAnd we were staying back in -- baking the matzos. But later we got afraid they gonna take us\ntoo. So we walked out and I walked into -- excuse me, a toilet and -- and this was in the winter, it\nwas very cold, and this was frozen. And I looked in, was dark, and I was staying on that, but I\nfeel something in the back, but tot -- I didn\u2019t touch it, I didn\u2019t get -- I was staying til was a little\nbit -- I hear th-th -- th-th-the [indecipherable] and I was staying there til [indecipherable]. And I\nmaked up with my sister, if the window will be open a little bit, I can come in. If the window\nwouldn\u2019t be open, I can\u2019t -- shouldn\u2019t come in. So a policeman came in to take me. So the janitor\ndidn\u2019t saw me and a neighbor was taking in my little boy to hide him. So he was sure I am gone.\nSo he said no, this woman with the baby is gone. So they walked away. But I came and my sister\nfalled asleep and she forgot to open the window. So I was walking back. I came again, the\nwindow is closed. But I came again, the little window was open. And I came in [indecipherable]\nshe kissed me, she hugged me. They took out Chaim, her husband, they took out everybody.\nThank God you are here. What\u2019s going to happen with us, what\u2019s happen together. I said listen,\nthis is not [indecipherable] we have to something. She said, what can we do? To drink poison? I\nsaid the best thing would be. The best thing. But anyway, in the evening I went back to the place\nto bake the matzos under Dunkelman\u2019s name. So I met there a girl what her husband was a\njanitor. And on this place were doctors from Czechoslovakia and he maked a living from them\nbecause he bringed the -- the vegetables, the potatoes, the coals for them, and they paid him. So I\ntold a lie, I said listen, I am living with my sister, with my brother-in-law and we can\u2019t get along\nand I would like to find a place to go to. She said, come over to my house. I have three beds. I\u2019m\nlonely. So this girl took me in and I was sleeping with her a few days, but we both got in fight\nand we both packed two sacks and they get -- and they went by themselves to that. And they got\na good life because it got all the doctors from Czechoslovakia. They maked the living from them.\nAnd she was working for the matzos. So I was alone in the house. They came into the house,\nthey asked me for the people [indecipherable] I said they come later, later, but la -- I couldn\u2019t, I\nwas afraid to stay there, so I went back to my sister. But I forgot the meantime to tell you. One\ntime I went to work and I came home and I got only my little boy in the house. They took out my\nfamily. And my little boy, they left a piece of bread, maybe an inch and a half on the window. He\nwas kissing the piece of bread not to eat, only to feel like the crumbs. So my little boy was two\nyears old, he said Mama, don\u2019t eat up Laiva -- Laiva\u2019s bread, he will come back. He\u2019s hungry.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",

        "A: A month. [indecipherable] Before they liquidate the ghetto, my brother Moishe worked in the\n[indecipherable] radio. This was the best job in ghetto, like with the police. He was very good to\nus. So, in the ghetto they put us in, in our house, downstairs was a movie. So on the roof was a\nlittle wall, and I got black material because we got afraid of the money, so we work materials. So\nI bought a material, was -- was on one side shiny, on the other side was -- this was an expensive\nmaterial. So I there was putting in a few dollars in case we gonna go to work because we were\nthinking they\u2019re going to send us to work, so they will sell this to the Gentile people, we will\nhave a piece of bread for us, for the childrens. So we took a pail of water, I got a bread, and my\nsister got a bread and we went up on the roof and we covered ourselves with the black ma --\nmala -- material under the wall, and I said quietly, Yankovek, do you want a piece of bread? He\nwas speaking Polish. He said, no Mama, I am afraid. We wouldn\u2019t have it tomorrow and the\nGermans gonna kill us. No more, be quiet, don\u2019t talk. So we were laying and I heard some noise\non the steps. I was thinking they coming to take us, but Moishe came. And quietly he called us,\nand we heard Moishe. Moishe said, be quiet, you need bread, I have a kilo bread. I said, Moishe,\nwe still have a bread. If you need the kilo bread -- no, he said, save the kilo bread, but don\u2019t go\ndown because [indecipherable] now downstairs and catching the ch -- the childrens from all\nover. So we were still s-staying down the wall, til was quiet. My brother came and he told us we\ncan come into the house. So we came into the house, they put the childrens to the beds. We have\nourself are tired, frozen, cold, okay. A-And to work -- no, no more work. We were waiting for\nMoishe to come to tell us what to do. But all night Moishe didn't came. Another night Moishe\ncame in the dark and he said, maybe for tonight you should go up again on the roof, because it\u2019s\nnot clear. We don\u2019t know what -- what\u2019s going to happen, maybe they gonna take us, we don\u2019t\nknow. So we went up again on the roof, house was quiet, nothing happened. So in the morning\nvery early he came and he said, bring down the childrens, put them to bed. So we went -- yeah.\nSo mine sister went into the [indecipherable] and he gave her all the breads for my mother with\nthe childrens, because they didn\u2019t got -- close the carts. They didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t got the time to\nclose off first everybody. So she brought up four breads, I don\u2019t remember, or five breads, a little\nbit flour, a little bit this, a little bit this. So we said to each other, now we are eating up our\nbrother, sister and our mother. But not long was taking, a few days and we had to leave the\nghetto. We were -- they sent us over to the other side. So we walked into my s -- sister\u2019s in-laws.",

So my sister was asking him a\nfavor, to let us stay in the basement. So he walked out because he was afraid and he didn\u2019t tell\nus, I think he didn\u2019t answer, he walked out, that\u2019s all. Later came in a policeman, but not -- not to\ntake us, to talk with us because he saw he is in dangerous position too. He said, you know, I had\nvery bad news. They sending us to a place where over there they\u2019re gonna kill our childrens first,\nour parents and later they\u2019re gonna kill us. But we had to go by ourselves with our childrens to\nthe trains and to go to Auschwitz. But my little boy was feeling he is going to die, because he\nloved me and I gave away a bread for our can of conserviate meat. Do you know what I mean\nconserviate? This was lot like sardines, let\u2019s say, meat. So I said, Yankovek, I would like to give\nyou a piece of bread with meat. No, Mama, I can\u2019t eat. He couldn\u2019t eat and he didn\u2019t eat. So we\nwere on trains from cattles. No windows, nothing. Now that you couldn\u2019t breathe.",

This was -- this I never forget, our sister and our brother, they\nwere so touched to each other. She cried the whole way, he died in the train. What happened to\nthis little girl, I don\u2019t know. Was so crowded we couldn\u2019t breathe, we couldn\u2019t move, nothing.\nFinally we came out to Auschwitz the middle of the night.",

        "A: Ah, food. I\u2019m telling you they pushed us in to die there because wasn\u2019t able to breathe, my\nlittle boy couldn\u2019t breathe. I was pushing a little bit the people away, it was a selfish, to make a\nlittle bit air pocket [indecipherable] little boys. So when the opened the wagons to come out,\nJewish people -- Jewish mens worked us. They called them -- how the name was? How --\nA2: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Ah, [indecipherable]. They were -- now, when I\u2019m thinking over, I\u2019m not mad at them\nbecause they were -- they saw the dead for the eyes and they knew we are going to that, so they\ntook away all everything from us to save a little bit for them. They got girlfriends there, they\nwere suffering, but living, but we were expecting the same thing. So they took away everything\nfrom me, and I stood with my [indecipherable] with my sister, so I got the ring, the wedding\nring, I got afraid, I throw it away, because they were beating to death. I got, I think, five sterling\npounds [indecipherable] but I got my wedding, I was saving. I throw this away. My father gave\nus each 20 dollars gold. We throw this away. So meantime we were staying and thinking with\nmy sister, what to do. I saw [indecipherable] here, came in, came close to us, a good looking\nwoman, not too old, in her late 50\u2019s. And she said to us, take me for your mother. I will watch\nyour childrens. Maybe you\u2019ll get sent you to work, I will take care on your childrens and we will\nbe a family. And my sister and I said okay. So this woman stood with us. Later came to us the\nmans from the trains and he said, give the two childrens to the lady, you come with me. So the\nlady took the two little boys by the hands, and I said to my little boy, Yankovek, I will come to\nsee you. He said, I still have the voice in my ears, Mama, you never came to me. You afraid for\nthe Germans. I said, Yankovek, I will come. I will break iron. I will come to see you. I never\ncame. I never see him no more. So this man put us to young people what he send to work. This\nwas a little bit a mensch. So he was thinking he can save us. So he put us -- but I cut my hair,\nthey cut off [indecipherable] hair. I don\u2019t know how it was, somebody came over and he cut off\nmy hair. And my sister didn\u2019t recognize me so she start to scream, who has my sister. They said\nyour sister 1s standing by you. No, this [indecipherable] I said, and now you\u2019re crying about\nhair? I don\u2019t care how I look. So I took off my coat, I throw it away because the coat got full.\nAnd I was staying. And I met a teacher, but I got a night school with her, Socha, such a nice\nlady. So she said, we will be together. I said, Socha, I am happy. I am so happy I am thankful to\nGod to be with you together with my sister. And we stood together and came a lady close to us\nand she called us the names, but I didn\u2019t recognize her. And this was our cousin [indecipherable |\nyeah, she didn't got the baby. In ghetto she got the baby. So she sent her mother with the baby\nshe got -- they got a big store, they got good pinozo. And she was a educated woman too. So she\nsent her mother to Piotrk6w Trybunalski. Over there wasn\u2019t the Third Reich, so she was thinking\nwith the money her mother will save the baby, she\u2019s a young woman, she will go to work. So she\nsaid to me and my sister, can I be with you together? I said, it\u2019s a honor. I am happy you saw us,\nbecause I wouldn\u2019t recognize you. You put us dresses I can tell you s -- years, and I wouldn\u2019t\nnever get through. Dresses, long to the ground, big like this, no hair. We looked like -- like he\ncalled us, Jerusalem putin. So in a few minutes, not long, Mengele came with the -- how the\nname from her? I\u2019m forgetting. She was the worst woman I -- I -- Mengele with his helper, I will\nremind my name. He was wearing white gloves to here, not deep, short gloves. He got a little\nstick in his fingers and he turned around like this, we had to take off the dresses, naked. He\nlooked over the body, if we don\u2019t have anything on the body. It was two sides, he said -- sec --\nhow you saying, selected -- sele -- one on this side, and one on this side. So me and my sister\nmaked up we don\u2019t care, but let\u2019s go together. So my sister went to one side and I went to the\nother side. But I was that time still with my mind. When he turned with the back [indecipherable |\nI moved and I was by my sister. But this cousin got afraid, so she was over there. And the --\nSocha, when I tried to move, I said Socha, do. So she did the same thing and she went over with\nus. So we are together. I says, and now I don\u2019t care. If we gonna go to the gas chambers let\u2019s go\ntogether. If we\u2019re gonna go to work, let\u2019s go together. But this cousin, I never forget what she\ntold me. She knew she 1s going to the gas chambers, but she couldn\u2019t make. So they took us to\ntake a shower and they took them to the same place, but the other group they pushed in in a place\nthat was glass windows. So they saw it\u2019s no good, so they breaked up the door. So they pushed\nin more people what they got to go to work. So my sister was so smart, she said, Hannah come\ncloser here [speaks Polish here]. So we went all the [indecipherable] my sister a -- a little bit\nfarther, but I saw that was going on. So they locked the door, we didn\u2019t saw them any more. Us\nthey put in in cold water, and in the water was charko, this is the name in Polish. But this was a\nchemical, charko. The smell was like from matches, when you lighting a match.",
        "A: Yeah. So they gave us a bath there and they gave us again dresses, again big -- I don\u2019t know,\none\u2019s got a dress til here, naked the bottom. I got a dress til [indecipherable]. They gave me a\npair of shoes, I\u2019m suffering still to-today. Hollander -- do you know from Hollander shoes, what\nthey harm is about? They gave me --",
        "A: But they wasn\u2019t too big, so -- and I was walking in them. So I have til today, sick my -- my --\nmy feet. So they took us on place, again a -- a bath -- again a shower, again a shower, agai --\nmaybe 10 showers in one day. Every minute out the dress, everyone out the dress. This was\nMengele and Erma -- Erma, I never forget her. So the last moment, they gave us a cup of soup,\nthey put in five, like this, not like this. Like a line. So the first girl took the pot. The pot maybe\nwas about two quarts, or two and a half a quart. So my sister said Hannah [speaks Polish] run\nand take a little soup from the -- but I was waiting til she\u2019s gonna share. But the other one\ncatched, the other one -- so my daughter -- my sister said, Hannah, I can\u2019t catch for me and you,\nI gonna catch for myself, catch too. But when I runned over, I had to clean with my hand the\nrest, that\u2019s what I got. So I said to my sister, listen, if we gonna stay in Auschwitz a few days\nlonger, we gonna drop dead here anyway. Let\u2019s stay in a group from young people, and we will\nsee what\u2019s gonna happen. She said that\u2019s an idea. And so she went with us. We stood in the\ngroup, they murdered us again with baths, again with showers, again with baths, til they bringed\nus a kilo bread, a piece of bologna and a piece of margarine. So my sister said, now Hannah, we\nare going to walk, and SS mens walked with us about 20 minutes, and I walked in the shoes. And\nI saw trains [indecipherable] and I was okay, but I don\u2019t know maybe the di-di-di -- they bring us\nthat -- to other gas chambers, let\u2019s be a train. But the c-cattle trains. They pushed us in. We ate\nup the bread and on the -- with the [indecipherable] with the margarine. They put in a pail in\ncase, excuse me, for the need. And a SS man was sitting in each [indecipherable] watching us,\nbut when he walked out, he locked us outside. But anyway, we didn't got anything to do. We\ndidn\u2019t ate, we didn\u2019t drink, we didn\u2019t have nothing to do. So he was coming back in an hour, he\nate something [indecipherable] he came in, he was sitting in wa -- but I -- thirsty I was. So we\ngot very little windows like in here, but more buts -- pardon me, smaller. So was raining, I\nsticked out the tongue and I -- I got a few drops rain. So girls behind me were pulling my short\nlittle hair, but I didn\u2019t pull, I don\u2019t care, I am not going away til I dra -- have to get a few drops\nof water. Okay, I was sitting, sleeping, sitting, we were traveling a few days, maybe a week with\nno food, with no water, with nothing. We came to a place -- we came to a place, so he gave us\nstriped dresses. He gave us straw sacks and straw to make like -- like mattresses.",
        "A: So I said to my sister, at least we will have where to lay down. But he was a murder. He start\nto beat -- t-to beat us up to that.",
        "A: The place? Valdersluss, yes. So he showed us to be good, if not he 1s -- can -- is able to do the\nsame thing what Auschwitz, va -- he was a murder, but they hanged him anyway, yeah. So he\ngave us two days not to go to work, so we furnished everything, like he said. He gave us\nunderwear, like [indecipherable] you understand what I said to him? Like an undershirt, but\nlonger a little bit, let\u2019s say to the knee. Later he gave us a band, like a brassiere, but no brassiere,\nSO We were -- and --",
        "A: The -- the Lagerfithrers?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know the name, no I -- I -- we didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t know a -- nobody didn\u2019t know the\nname. We got a Oberscharfuhrer, he was a little bit better, but he was afraid of the Lagerfihrer.\nThe Lagerfthrer was a murder. The face, when you looked at his face, you was able to see the\nmurderskeit. The Oberscharfthrer -- and he wasn\u2019t -- he talked a [indecipherable] poli -- nice, he\nsaid, [indecipherable] it\u2019s gonna come a time you will be free. But when he was, he was s-\nscreaming, cursing, calling bad names, yeah. He was a old man, the Oberscharfthrer, he was in\nhis 70\u2019s, but the Lagerfuihrer was a young -- ab-ab -- in his 40\u2019s -- 30\u2019s -- late 30\u2019s. So two days,\ntwo SS mens came and they put us in five, like this, in five, and he said -- he talked to us nice\n[indecipherable] like Germans. He said, and now we are going three kilmetre to the place what\nwe going to start to walk. And behave yourself, I wouldn\u2019t beat you, only you have to walk.\nBecause the Lagerfthrer will come to see. Okay, we walked -- yeah, in the morning he gave us\nlike eight ounces bread with a coffee. The coffee was not coffee. Okay, so the bread yeah, and\nhere we got the cabinets. Found a piece of -- of wire, a piece of string. So w-we put everything\nhere and this was our cabinets. So we went to work. So the first time he told us to dig holes.\nLater we found out this is going to be shelters. But the Lagerfiihrer came into ours and he didn't\nlike we took small amounts on the shovel. He showed us to pick up a shovel full. If he would\nstay with us, nobody would be alive, but we got luck, he stood an hour, a half an hour and he\nleft, so we go back to little bit, little bit. Okay. But was very cold. And I cried to myself. So\nSocha came over to me, she said, why you crying? I says, Socha, I am freezing. I don\u2019t care any\nmore alive. She said, Hannah, my mother told me [speaks Polish here] Do you understand this?\nThe whole body will became like the nose. So she came two hours later and asked me, I said,\nstill not [Polish]. But I became [Polish], yes. I worked in the cold winds, in the cold snows and\nthe cold rains. My dress was never dry, all the time wet. I was sleeping 1n it to dry, but never\ndried. So we worked there, we got the soup, and we came home, we got the soup. He stood --\nthis he did wa -- right. Of course, the Jewish capos, they gave us the top, the water, for them they\nsaved the bottom, th-the -- the [Polish] the -- the vegetables, or the [Polish]. But he stood so she\nhad to mix. So I got a little potato, a little bit cabbage, a little bit [indecipherable] okay. But if he\nwasn't, then they [indecipherable] so we got water. So I worked in this place, in a salt mine, in a\nsalt mine. I was digging out [indecipherable] from the water to full up iron wagons, the name\nwas from the wagons [indecipherable]. This is like little trains, one was touched to the other, and\nthey were on lines and -- yeah, lines. So I got five or six together and I had to full up all the six\nand to push them to the place. Later I kept over, yeah, and I had to come back. But I -- when we\ncame to work, right away he said [speaks foreign language here] and I have til today neuralge in\nmy head, neuralge in my gums, neuralge in my ears, because the wind, the rain, all the time wet.\nBut over there I didn\u2019t suffered. I never got a headache, I never got a toothache. They pulled\nmine teeth there with -- with -- what\u2019s that st -- plines -- plienses. I didn\u2019t got blood poison, I\ndidn\u2019t got anything, they put the camp, I think, six in the bottom for -- yeah. If the girls were\nscreaming, he pulled more. So I was thinking, get away, it\u2019s no good, so I was holding like this,\nso he pulled only six and four, okay. What else we got. Yeah, later they took us to a salt mine.\nThis place was very dangerous. The man [indecipherable] was bringing us down with the\nelevator, was a man in his late 80\u2019s. He said, my God [indecipherable] 50 years here, I never\nbring down womens. God be with them. We came down, what can I tell you? That th-the\n[indecipherable] better for us than to -- okay, he came over with the lamp in the front, he showed\nus what to do. So he picked me to push up -- they got prepared in the daytime, I think\n[indecipherable] were prepared for us. So was -- the salt was cut in pieces, big pieces, smaller\npieces. So sliding [indecipherable] was going up on electricity. But I had to go so fast, if not this\npiece what I moved first would come back and kill me. So I was a little bit with energy and I\npulled fast up. But I had to stop a little bit, so that one time it got up but a watchma -- SS man,\nbut he didn\u2019t pushed us so fast. But he watched us if he heard walking, because in the salt mine\nyou heard walking because was quiet, he said [speaks foreign language here]. So when I heard,\nso I pushed up. To work a whole night, to push up pieces, about 10 - 15 pounds was vi -- I would\n-- | would drop dead. So I finished a night, thank God. We got wooden shoes, outside was snow.\nThe snow sticked to the -- to the wood, so we wouldn\u2019t able to walk sn -- nice. So the SS man\nbeat up. If this one don\u2019t [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know how my husband 1s forcing me to keep\nup kosher. I don\u2019t know. So when walked, the five, we walk -- we watched each other, because if\none from the five was a little crooked, he beat up all the five. So we were holding us fast and\nthank God we made home [indecipherable]. But what I saw, I never forget. But -- but I don\u2019t\nknow what kind people, the Germans were educated people, high educated people, how they can\ndo this, to kill people alive with kicking. So I working in salts mine a few days. Another day they\ngave me something else, another day he gave me something else, but we had to take off the\ndresses, was very hot. But water we bring with us because the salt was making thirsty, but no\nfood. In the nighttime no, but in the morning when we came we got our soup with the piece of\nbread and he told us to go to bed, to sleep. But I saw the salt mine is not good either. So I was a\nbusinesswoman. I put in a few piece of salt in my -- in mine cabinet, and I was thinking with my\nsister we gonna change salt for something else because we didn\u2019t got salt there. So \u2019'da--a\ncousin from mine sister\u2019s husband came over and she said, do you have salt? I said yes. She said,\nI have a few customers, they working in the kitchen. I will bring you bread. [indecipherable]\ntook out the whole -- the whole how you say [Polish] and I gave her. Til today she isn\u2019t showing\nup. If she is alive, let her be alive, I don\u2019t care. Okay. Later they took us [indecipherable] was\nvery hard. Again li -- to put the full up the [speaks Polish]\nA2: The lorries.",
        "A: The lorries. So dirt, not from the water, dirt, stones, and we -- I wa-was full of -- got five, six,\nand they told me what, to push them and to empty them and come back. So I worked with my\nsister, and my sister, she was looking only for news. Then she saw -- then she saw a man, she\nstopped him and she asked him, do you think we will come out from here? The one man said to\nus, yes, but fight. I said, what do you mean fight? From where can -- where can I take food to\neat? Grass, was grass. I would eat grass, was grass. So this man got a friend, so my sister talked\nto one and I talked to other one. A few days later I met one, I said, where is your friend? He\u2019s\ngone. A few days later this other one didn\u2019t came, so we didn't got to ask anybody, okay. But the\nman what he walked [indecipherable] with us, he was not dead. He said [speaks Polish] to take a\nbreak, a few minutes. He said, I don\u2019t care if [indecipherable] you Lagerfihrer. If he will come, I\nwill talk to him.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: -- I will talk to him. But he didn\u2019t came. So later he told us, okay, go back to work. So we\nstart again to fill up the dirt. Believe me, they didn't -- they didn\u2019t need the work, only to -- to\nmurder us. Only to murder us, okay. One time they took me to another group. So this SS man\nwas alone, if he -- if he wa -- if so -- if the SS was alone, was much better. If was two or three,\nwas [indecipherable] one was showing off to the other he\u2019s taking better care. So he said one\nthing. I want you to be quiet. I will take you into a room. If you will stay in the room, I will\nwatch outside if the Lagerfuhrer is coming. And he kept us a whole day in the room because\nraining and snowing and this was in the woods. And we had to -- to clean the woods, to pick up\nthe little branches to put together. So we were sitting in the room a whole day til was dark, he\ntook us home. Okay. And now, on the same place we came every day to work, so was many\nnations there. But other nations, they got better than we had. So we saw our clean -- came from -\n- from garbage, but clean, new. Was foo -- food. And we got in the back little cans from the\nmeat, I don\u2019t know from where we took them. So everybody walked over and fi -- and I did, too.\nLater they called the -- up Lagerftihrer and they told him what we did, but he didn\u2019t -- he didn't\nsaid anything to us. When we came home -- so my sister was very smart, she said mum --\nHannah don\u2019t stay in the first line and don\u2019t stay in the last line, so we will -- we will be able to\nsee what they are doing with the first line. So who got the can, he was giving over the head,\nbecause he knew with the can -- so I was very fast, I throwed away the can. So he saw everybody\nwas throwing away the cans, but anyway, he hit me, til today I have my ear damaged, but not\nbad. I\u2019m -- I can hear, I\u2019m not deaf. Okay. [phone ringing, tape break]. I\u2019m ca -- taking a little\nmag -- from everything, because to sit, to talk from everything, you will sit with me two years,\nand no writer 1s able to write a book if he wasn\u2019t in there. In between the camps was [speaks\nPolish] a difference. Some camps got a little better, some camps got bitter like worse than death.\nSo a woman cut up a piece from the undershirt and she was making a band around the head. And\nthis Lagerfuhrer checked all the time after the laundry, the -- the underwear. So he saw a shirt cut\noff a piece. So when we came back from work he\u2019s -- he didn\u2019t let us in. So I saw and now is\nsomething going on. So I took mine towel, because I was freezing, I put on my towel, and I was\nafraid if he is going to check and see me with the towel, is he going to kill me? I was so fast, I\nthrowed away the towel. [indecipherable] else did the same thing. But he is going to go into my\nroom and he s -- will see I didn\u2019t got the towel, so he will find me, so he will say what I did. I did\nnot right, but I -- I did too. So finally in a few minutes, he found the woman with the little piece\non the hat. And he took it in and he let us in. So I looked -- I looked -- in one second I was in the\nhouse and I took from another bed a towel and I put on my bed the towel. So I took from an old\nwoman, a very nice, intelligent woman, a old woman, I took the towel from her. So I said to her,\nlisten, he would believe you, because you were -- you was in the kitchen, so don\u2019t cry. If\nsomebody took, he will save -- he will try to save his life. She understood me. I took the t -- I\ntook the towel. So he gave I don\u2019t know how many with a rubber pipe on her two muscles, naked\nmuscles. The cuts was deep more than a quarter of a inch. This woman was screaming a half a\nnight, the rest of, I think she died. Because I tell you the truth, to go to look, I wasn\u2019t able. To\nhelp, I couldn\u2019t. So I was thinking, she\u2019s dying now, later I will die. I walked out of th -- and to\nwork, I came back, she wasn\u2019t there. I think she died [indecipherable] throwed her to -- to -- to\nsomeplace and that\u2019s it, okay. This was one. And now Erma and Mengele took me to work. I was\nwatching them very careful because I was afraid of the two murders. They got a shepherd, a\nGerman shepherd. He was trained like a SS man. They didn\u2019t told him anything, only they\nlooked. He went to this woman what they looked. He didn\u2019t left her before he -- she was dead. In\nthe most was Hungarian womens, because the Polish we were able to suffer, but not the\nHungarians. The Hungarians got a little better than we got, not in the camp, before the war. With\neducation, with life, with everything. They got a -- a better life than we got. So the whole time I\nheard screaming [indecipherable] the Polish people, they didn\u2019t cry, they didn\u2019t scream, only\nShema Israel, and that\u2019s it. So with us was a little girl from 14 years. Up to the wall what he took\nme, I will explain to you, but I don\u2019t know how to say. In German the [indecipherable] we got\nbranches with leaves, with wire and we was tying to each other and making a carpet to cover the\nroofs against the air raid. So this little girl was with us. So Erma took a piece of paper and she\nmaked a little bag and she put in black whole peppers. She went to -- over to the little girl and\nshe gave her peppers to eat. From the beginning the girl was crying Mamashi, Papashi,\nBubbashi, Zeidashi, God. Later she throwed her down and she opened her little bag and pushed\nher into the mouth. And the little girl had to swallow this. Later she kicked her with her feet to\nthe wall, and she tooked us out of this place to another place. Okay, what else? I -- I -- \u2019m\ntelling you the -- the most things, because to tell you stories, we never get through, because I\u2019m\ntalking with my husband and I would -- don\u2019t believe in it. I said Nathan, this is true? This can\nhappen? To be six wa -- weeks with no water and not to take a bath a whole year? This can be\ntrue? My husband said, I can\u2019t believe by myself, but I went through. Later -- yes. I was in a\nblock, the col -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the rooms what we all -- blocks.",
        "A: A thousand. They pushed in how ma -- how many they put? We were laying like herring,\npressed. In the nighttime the Ukrainians came in to take off that you wouldn\u2019t -- shoes too. So\nwe were w-walking barefoot to [indecipherable] and the snow. Screamed? They would kill us.\nSo they -- to come in in the night and they took off the shoes from us. So over there was a girl\nfrom Czechoslovakia, her name was Pessella. Believe me, I didn't make my life a\n[indecipherable] I didn\u2019t, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to make. But if you would Pessella here and you\nwould give me a knife, I would able to stay to [indecipherable] small pieces for months til she\nwould die. Such a murder, with -- from the Germans you wouldn\u2019t able to find, never. She was\nbeating us to death. So in the nighttime they took us out for say l\u2019appel. Say l\u2019appel they were\ncounting us. Rain, snowing, we were staying hours til the SS man came to count us. So when the\nSS man came, she showed off. She said the [indecipherable]. You understand this? What are\ntibel?\nA2: Devil.",
        "A: The devil will kill us. He said [indecipherable] because he got mad, because she\n[indecipherable] us, you Jewish too. He said, [indecipherable] you too. So she closed her pisk.\nSo the SS man took us to work. So I was thinking with my sister not to go into this block any\nmore, because this was -- I -- I more than truly killed her. I more than truly. I never saw in my\nlife such a murder. And she was fat. Big [indecipherable] they got everything. They got the\nmens, they got sex, they got everything there. Only th-the -- the -- the stubovas, blochovas, the\n[indecipherable] they make the life, they are, yes. They were making a life on our -- on our --\nthey were eating us up. They didn\u2019t gave us this ration what he gave us. The Pessella was\n[indecipherable]. Nice hair, no, but she was a murder, my God. How can be between Jews such a\n[indecipherable]? Okay, I more than sure they killed her. Hundred percent. Even she went back\nto Czechoslovakia, over there the -- killed her, because this was the worst blochova\n[indecipherable]. So I walked into another block. Was a lock -- they didn\u2019t recognized if you\nbelonged here, you belonged there, only they count every time the -- yeah, numbers we had. So I\nwalked in with my sister to another block. Not a -- a-all of them were good, but not like Pessella.\nThey were beating -- they got sticks from five, six meters and they\u2019re all giving over the heads\nlike this and another one got the a -- a -- open head. But Pessella was the worst. So I was sitting\nwith my dau -- with my daughter, God bless her til 120 -- with mine sister, my sister died in\nspring, after the war. We were [indecipherable] the 15th of April liberated and my sister got TB\nall over the body. So they took her to Sweden and she died June the 17\", 1945, 27 years old. So\nthat smart girl, how she worked for our parents. She was the best from all of us, from our\nparents. For each holiday I asked a coat, a dress, shoes, but not she. But what she did when I was\noutside, she put on -- she was very close to me, she put on my dress. And I walked in the street\nand I saw she\u2019s wearing my dress. Not in the street I wouldn\u2019t make nothing. When I came\nhome, I start to fight with her. So my father said, do me a favor, take a few dollars and go\noutside, buy material and make for yourself a dress and a coat. You know what this girl did? She\ntook the few dollars, she bought for my father -- this was for special Hassidic people, a\n[indecipherable] summer -- summer coat, let\u2019s say and for my mother a coat and she got 80 cents\nleft over, she bought Skombra. Skombra was the best sardines in our country, we got good\nsardines, better than we have here, from [indecipherable] the good. So this was 80 cents, so she\nbought for 80 cents father -- for my father the Skombras. This what she did for our parents and\nfor our small, little boy. I didn\u2019t. I was working, I gave in the money, but all the time I asked, I\nneed a dress, I need shoes, I need a coat and I got. But she never asked, never. But when she\nwent out, she put a -- she put on mines. So I said, I can be the good one too. I am th-th-the -- the\nbad one because I am asking for clothes, we didn\u2019t got enough money. And you don\u2019t want it,\nyou [indecipherable] you wearing mines. So we got a fight all over this, yes.",
        "A: Before liberation? Oy, I will prepare, I will prepare more. I have so much. Sometimes when\nI\u2019m not sleeping, I\u2019m thinking over if this is true, if such educated, high educated people like the\nGermans, they were the first educated people. China was the first, but the modern country was\nGermany and they were able to do people like that. But one thing I will tell you when\n[indecipherable] when I was liberated, I wasn\u2019t able to walk, I was laying on the floor. So I was\nliberated by the British. So a soldier gave me a newspaper and I was so dumb, I didn't save this\nnewpas -- newspaper. In the newspaper I read about 400 years ago, this same thing happened to\nFrankfurt am Main. They throwed out the childrens from the windows, they throwed out the\nfurnitures from the windows. The -- the chambers in [indecipherable] you still able to see what\nthey put in the Jews. So the -- th-the walls having openings. So in the wintertime they were\nfreezing, they got typhoid, they got lice and they didn\u2019t got nothing to eat. So were two mens,\nAdolf Stoecker was Hitler. Adolf Stoecker and who was the other one, Nathan?\nA2: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I do rem -- remind myself. The other one was secretly going to rich friends and collecting\nmoney, three quarter from the population from Frankfurt am Main died, but the leftover, he took\nout from the chambers, you can see the chambers still today in Wiesbaum , this is very close to\nFrankfurt am Main, I was there, I saw it. And he gave each a little bit money and he told them to\ngo to look to the apartments if they are empty, to go in and he helped them to go in a little\nbusiness to build up again a life. Petmilch was the good one. Adolf Stoecker was Hitler, Petmilch\nwas saving the rest, few Jews what they left -- were leftover from the get -- from the chambers,\nno gas chambers, only chambers they were laying with no food, with no a -- with no sanitary.\nThey died of typhus, they died from starvation. A few got leftover, so he took them out and he\nsaved the few Jews, Petmilch. And I got the newspaper and why I didn\u2019t save the newspaper like\nthis, but I was very sick, very sick.",
        "A: Yes. They took us one time to carry stones.",
        "A: I was in Bergen-Belsen, and I was re -- by the British in Bergen-Belsen. Frankfurt was\nAmerica, but Bergen-Belsen was the British. We didn\u2019t got so good after war by the British here,\nwe didn\u2019t got enough wood. So we were carrying five bricks, three, four, five blocks.",
        "A: No, this was before the liberation. So some girls got weak. I got weak by myself. So they let\ndown the bricks. You know what they did to them? They punished them, they had to put the --\nthe hand to -- in the back and to carry the bricks in the back. And if they wouldn\u2019t able to bring\nto the place the ba -- there, they punished them, I don\u2019t know them any more and I didn\u2019t -- I\ndidn\u2019t see them any more. Okay, this is what. Later, they took me to dig trees. So I was digging\ntrees with the woods. So I was very careful, the wood -- the -- the trees were batti -- 10 me-\nmeters high, eight meters high, very high. So sometimes we got SS la -- SS men started -- helped\na little bit. We got a big stick with a hook to put in the hook in the tree and to pull, but to make to\nfall [indecipherable] wood. But some of them were murders. They rushed you, so you forgot that\nthe bu -- that the tree falls [indecipherable] and they -- they killed her. So I was careful, I was\nwatching which way the tree is going, so I was standing on the other side. And I runned away\nand I left the stick with the hook in the tree. So one time he came over to me and he said, don\u2019t\ndo this again. If not I will punish you. You must take out the hook before the tree 1s falling.\nOkay. I said danke schoen [indecipherable] okay. Later, a few days later we got a nice little bit --\na -- nice trees were prepared and I didn\u2019t know they\u2019re burning over there the bodies\n[indecipherable] in Bergen-Belsen we didn't got gas chambers. But we were putting the trees like\nthis. In the middle, we put in the dead bodies. So when I passed with the group to work, I saw\nmens working. So one was screaming Lodz [indecipherable]. So old man said Lodz, I said Lodz.\nAnd he told me the name. This was one place what they got the nice ta -- beautiful s -- woolen\nsweaters. Very rich, modern Hassidic people. So I asked him if he 1s, and he said yes. When I\npassed back, he was dead. He worked so hard there, okay. So later, they piled up the dead people\ntil -- til [indecipherable]. So they got me to bring the dead people closer. So they put in blankets\n-- | had to put in blankets, four girls. What I saw, I am falling. I -- I-I am fall. So I said to the\nthree girls, listen. Listen, let\u2019s look around. If we will see nobody, run away. He is dead anyway.\nSo we left the dead body, we runned away. But where can I hide? Every day they were looking\nfor -- fo-for the girls to carry the dead body to bring there to-to -- to the trees. So every time we\ndid the same thing. How long we were able to -- how -- not to pick up on, to reach off -- yeah. So\nthe -- the blanket got a hole, so he falled out, the dead. So we runned away again. We couldn\u2019t\npick up the dead, we couldn\u2019t do anything, we runned away. But we got [indecipherable] after\nwe did [indecipherable]. Later -- yeah, one time I saw a man with a little knife and he cut the\nmuscle from the dead out. But I wasn\u2019t smart enough to think he\u2019s gonna eat ous -- this, or to\ncook, I don\u2019t know. Later I saw another one, he cut the belly, he took th -- a liver. At that time I\nwasn\u2019t afraid of the dead, I wasn\u2019t afraid of -- of anything, nothing was bothering me. Okay.\nAfter we -- so, we got concentration Bergen-Belsen, a city Bergen-Belsen, a military camp\nBergen-Belsen. So brought us over to the military camp. So at least we got showers. So one day\nwas for the mens to shower, one day was for the womens and we got sinks to wash a little bit\n[indecipherable]. And, excuse me, I got diarrhea because I was running to the kitchen. And a\nEnglish soldier gave me -- from a can, was very fat, cabbage with th -- with -- with fat, and I ate\nthis and I shouldn\u2019t because I was in sad shape. So I got very, very bad diarrhea. And I was\nsitting in the woods and I took three breaks like this and I got a can [indecipherable] was like\ngraham crackers. So ge -- ga -- ba -- he gave us in the morning for breakfast two crackers with a\nlittle bit chocolate cocoa, but I will tell you what the Jews did to the cocoa. The kitchens what\nthey cooked the -- th-the cocoa for us, they didn\u2019t put in this what the English give them, they\nsold to the Germans for diamonds and for money. And for us they give a little bit water. The\ncrackers, the two, they had to give us. Okay. We were marching, because we were starving, later\nthey put out garbage cans, but clean ones, new ones, with meat, with noodles, what this was\nstaying a whole day outside, was mushy, but I didn\u2019t got [indecipherable] I ate. But our Jews,\nlisten, it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s good to go to the synagogue, the Jews, not to eat from one plate, on a\nseparate plate that nothing will take the bigger piece. The Jews make the [indecipherable] there.\nTh-the -- the Jews, but they were still a little bit healthier, they walked into the kitchens to work,\nso they make money, they sold to the Germans. They took diamonds and gold and everything.\nThe rabbi from England, he took home a whole set with gold and diamonds. I wasn\u2019t afraid,\nwhen he came in, the doctor, I was very sick. So I got luck, a doctor from Holland, a very young\nman, he was in the army, he came in and he saw I have water a-all over my body.",
        "A: Bergen-Belsen.",
        "A: In -- in -- in this -- not town --",
        "A: -- in boy -- in the military. So he said to me, I will bring pills for the water, but for the iron I\ndon\u2019t have pills in here. So I said to him, the Germans runned out on the drugstores, so they\nemptied the drugstores [indecipherable] the rabbi -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the doctors go to the\ndrugstores to take the leftover what they left. He looked at me and he didn\u2019t answer me. But he\nleft a note for the blochova. Blochova was the leader from the -- from the house. She was still in\ngood shape after they were talking about her too, but I don\u2019t know. She was from Pietkow -- a\nnote to give to the rabbi from England. Kaplan was the rabbi, he was the army rabbi, to give me\na white bread, to give me a little bit milk and a little bit meat. So the rabbi came to see me. See,\nhe brought for me a piece of meat and a potato, a little bit soup, and he told me, he said listen,\nthis is kosher, this is teah, but no Shochet. I said to him, and now I don\u2019t care about anything, I\nwould like to go out from bed. If I would be able to walk out from bed, I would help myself. So I\n-- the potato I ate, the soup I drank, but the meat was so dry and hard, like a rock. So I said,\nthank you, Rabbi, I can\u2019t even eat it. He said, I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t have a grounder, I can\u2019t do\nanything more. Thank you. Okay. So the doctor came in and he ask me, I said, yes, the rabbi\n[indecipherable] me a meal, but a meal I can\u2019t eat because the meat is so hard and dry, I couldn\u2019t\neat. So he left another note. This doctor sent home a prescription to his family -- the war was still\ngoing on [indecipherable] for iron pills, and he gave me iron pills what his family sent to him.",
        "A: No, no. Hoita shtabi. Every day I said to him, Doctor, hoita shtabi. So I walked in the street\nwhen I got a little bit better, I still got what -- I still wa-was bit like this. So he walked with\nfriends, he stopped me and he stopped the friends. He said to them, this lady said to me every\nday hoita shtabi. Take a look. Isn\u2019t she looking good? Okay.

So we\nwalked into a store to try to say [indecipherable] I don\u2019t have. So the man said, please go out. I\ngonna check that. So she was afraid, she was bringing more than t -- we got on the -- on -- on --\non the piece of paper. Okay. We finished this, we went to another city again to the -- the mayor.\nSo we got food to eat til Czechoslovakia. We came into Czechoslovakia, the police took us by\nthe border. I saw people with yellow stars and I was like this, he said, don\u2019t worry. This is the\npeople what they did to you. We put them the yellow stars and give [indecipherable] working,\nlike you. Okay. So we asked them we would like to come into the city. He said no, you can\u2019t\ncome into the city, you have to see a doctor before. So I got luck. They took me in to a doctor,\nbut he came with a -- two days before from concentration camp. He saw I am sick and I told him\nI am going to Poland. So I got the wooden shoes, but [indecipherable] so I got tight with wire.\nStockings I didn\u2019t got on. I don\u2019t know if this was his girlfriend or this was his wife, he told her\nto give me up her stockings, she brought up her stockings. He asked a policeman to go and bring\nme a pair shoes. He went, he brought the shoes. He told him bigger ones. Okay [indecipherable]\nmens shoes. And he told him to bring us to a place, to give us good -- prepare a good night\u2019s\nsleep and to give us something to eat. He didn\u2019t got nothing, only a few potatoes, I think. That\u2019s\nwhat he got, he gave us, and we slept good. In the morning we walked out from over there,\nbecause we were free, no policemen, the doctor said I am okay. So I saw a stand staying outside\nlike in Europe with the vegetables on. So I wasn't able to -- first of all I didn't got the money. So\nI went over closer to look.

I's -- had no money, because\n[indecipherable] in Polish 1s a little [indecipherable] okay. So we walked to a train -- we were\nwalked in in a train and I walked into the train but this was a nice train. I walked into the train, I\nsaw a good looking man was dressed in leather, a very short jacket, nice pants and he looked to\nme Yiddish, but I didn\u2019t said anything. The other one, I saw he is ous. And they were playing\nnice there, accordion nice, and singing nice. So this good looking gentleman asked us where we\nare going.

He said don\u2019t worry about the rash, I have a rash on my face, but you gonna give\nblood and urine. If this is -- will be good, I will take you in -- in my department. So I took two\ndays, three days, I came in. He said yes, you gonna stay here. So I got a year and a half nursing\nschool in Germany, and I worked with this doctor, but I was very sick. So he said to me, Chanka,\ndon\u2019t go to Israel. You don\u2019t have the medicine what you need, you don\u2019t have the food what\nyou need, and over there you wouldn't work days, you gonna work nights. You have to lay -- you\nhave to sleep and to relax and to come back to a little bit help. So my brother was preparing for -\n- my brother did business on Black Market, he make money. He prepare two pianos and two\nfridgerators and furnitures to the kitchen and the boxes was wood to make to build a -- a -- a-- a\nplace. He sold us everything for [indecipherable]. And every -- maybe this gonna look to you\nfoolish. My brother came to say to us goodbye because he would come to us, because we were\nprepared. And he brought us presents to say goodbye. In the main night my father came and he\ntook my hands, he said, where you going? It\u2019s not a place for you. In the morning I said Nathan,\nI am not going. But I don\u2019t have the rights to stop you. Because he was a Hasharah, you know\nwhat Hasharah. He was starving. And he was preparing to go to -- to Israel and now you can go,\nI don\u2019t have the rights to stop. But, if you will find a place, I will wait and I will stay here. So my\nhusband didn\u2019t go. They sold us everything [indecipherable]. But was hard for us to come to -- to\nAmerica, so I went to the Jewish committee and they gave us two indexes, two [indecipherable]\ncards from a brother and a sister.

Later my\nhusband got sick and I still -- I was making nice money from the beginning the man what he took\nme in, he is dead, but [indecipherable] he gave me such a hard time. I told him I can\u2019t sew, I\ndon\u2019t know sewing. And this was an electric machine, I never saw an electric machine. I took a\nstop -- I put on round. And the girls didn\u2019t know I\u2019m Polish because Scranton is coal mines, most\nare Polish, so they heard my Polish, so they were friendly to me. So he bringed me to bri -- make\nsleeves, a seam. This he showed me, I was able -- but he didn't told me this 1s coming in shades.\nThis was coming one, one, two, two. So I took one, two, one, three, one, four, was a -- a picnic.\n90 pair sleeves, til I came blue wi-with navy. So I checked with the Polish girl, what I\u2019m doing?\nShe said, don\u2019t worry, give the whole 90. So the girls ripped apart and they put together, and she\nsaid -- they talked Polish, nobody would be able to understand them, but I understood. She said,\ntake one, one, two, two, to take there. But across me was sitting a girl, she was Italian. She\nlooked like Jewish, I was thinking she is Jewish. So she was squealing and he came over, he\ngave me a hard time. He said, do you think we making -- we making -- money\u2019s coming from the\nsky? You\u2019re taking 75 cents from nothing? I cried. So Ho-Howard Dixtane came over and he\ntold the girls in English to tell me he isn\u2019t the boss, he is the boss, not to cry. What I gonna tell\nyou? In six weeks I received a check for 45 dollars. I walked into the office, with my English\nand I said, 20? 45? She said, Hannah, you maked 45 dollars. I couldn\u2019t understand. I said 20, I\nhave to receive 20 dollars. 25. Hannah, go home. You made 45 dollars. So I was thinking, if I\u2019m\nable to make 45, I will make more. So I start to rush. I was making 110 dollars in Scranton,\nPennsylvania for Howard Dixtane, but my husband -- yeah, and I bought a home by the park. My\nchildrens went to the Hebrew day school now and a private school because I didn't like the\nPolish people to get my childrens to a public.",
        "A: My house? On Vine Street, close to park. Beautiful, six apartments. We worked very hard.\nMalka was nine years old she was helping us to put floors. I maked a beautiful home because my\nchildrens went to the Hebrew day school with rich childrens, so I know they will be ashamed to\ninvite friends, so I built up first a home for them. I put carpets wall to wall, we met a friend, not a\nfriend, he was from the same city and I told him I\u2019m working here. He said you can come and\ntake furnitures, you will pay off. I made it, I did, he put on th-the carpets, I got a beautiful home.\nSo little by little my husband got very sick. He got -- he got emphysema and -- and asthma. He\nchoked. And he worked on a place what they got union, he make more money than I did. So they\nsend him to -- to Penn State hospital and he got over there a checkup and they said Nathan, if\nyou got a checkup in here there\u2019s nothing wrong. But I saw the man is choking, he can\u2019t eat. So I\ngot -- we got a -- a doctor, his name is Bornstein, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s alive. His wife was from\nthe same city from what I was. A very rich daughter they got fap -- they made beer, how you say\nit?",
        "A: She was a rich -- a very rich daughter. So he became our friend. He didn't took a penny from\nus. So I went over on Saturday and I cried for him. I said, Dr. Bornstein, tell me, what should I\ndo? He said [indecipherable] Nathan is sick. Even I have to report from [indecipherable] you go\nto California, Los Angeles. I said, Doctor, I don\u2019t -- I can\u2019t go to Los Angeles. I don\u2019t have the\nmoney to buy a -- a nice -- nice section a home. I don\u2019t want to bring my childrens to the colla --\npardon me. So he said, you know, I am reading now a magazine from Tucson, Arizona. Over\nthere you can buy very cheap a nice home. I took the -- Maxie. I was sitting -- I didn't got -- I\ndidn\u2019t got school in here, but I\u2019m reading and writing [indecipherable] I can see. So I call the\nsame agent what I bought from him and he gave me 12,000 dollars on the little house. The big\none I got sold. I said, Nathan, let\u2019s take. My husband said no, he\u2019s gonna look for another agent,\nmaybe he will take more. I lost 3,000 dollars, I -- but I called back the same, it was a very nice\nman, he gave me 9,000 dollars, I took the 9,000 dollars, I took -- I bought a station wagon. My\nson got, 16 years old, license and he was driving six days to s -- to Tucson, Arizona. I gave them\na good time, even I didn\u2019t got the money. I spend a few hundred dollars. Every night we took\nanother -- how was the name?\nA2: [indecipherable]",

        "A: I gave my childrens a good time.",
        "A: We went to the nicer motels. We paid that time 15 dollars a night. This was to me, a fortune.\nWe took with us, swimming pool. My children swing -- were swimming good because we si --\nmy husband took them to the Jewish community center, I became a member and Malkava got\ntrap -- trof -- trophies from swimming, from jumping, Maxie got trophies from swimming and\njumping, they both are good swimmers, thank God. My Malka\u2019s two childrens are good\nswimmers. Okay, so I gave them a good time, we traveled six days. So they looked fa -- so we\nbought -- I wa -- they -- we walked into the stores, they picked what they liked and we got in --\non -- on the highways we got tables, and I got a paper tablecloths, and tho -- I pleased them to\nbuy the stuff what they liked and we were eating. One day Maxie said, in Holiday Inn is a sale\ntoday, you can eat how much you want, I don\u2019t think -- two dollars or three dollars. So I walked\nin with my husband, and I said, listen, it\u2019s not kosher, we wouldn\u2019t eat, let them eat. So the two\nchildrens, they got wild. They were running back and forth and eating and eating and eating and\neating. I paid, I don\u2019t know six dollars or five dollar. So a man from this place came over to us\nand he said, so we have kosher salami and we have kosher bologna and you can have something\nto eat in here. So we took bologna and salami the kosher. bread, we were eating and I took -- I\nbought more on the way and they got a good time and we went. Later we go -- go -- going to the\nstores. We were going to cities, and the stores, but one time we got a little accident. We walked\ninto a little city not far from Tucson, Arizona, but this was only black. And we came into a hotel\nwith black [indecipherable] and I was afraid to walk out and I was afraid to stay. But I was\nthinking with my husband, we will sit the whole night and watch wi -- the childrens, we will pay\nfor the night and tomorrow we gonna walk out, but was Saturday. But we got so tired we fall\nasleep too. In the morning we pay them and we asked him what type [indecipherable] is here,\nfrom vo, from vee [indecipherable] he saw we are Jews. So he said, listen, not far from here 1s a\nrabbi. But to be honest with you, we didn't go to the rabbi. We were waiting til the evening.\nWhat happened? We got a ti -- a flat -- a flat tire, I think, we stopped in this little city. So we got\nfixed the car and we traveled -- we trave -- [tape break] -- we went to Tucson. My Maxie was\nlonesome for the friends from Scranton, Pennsylvania. He went back to our friend. I paid him not\nmuch and he finished the high school in Tucson, Arizona.",
        "A: This was -- who knows? Maxie was 16 when he went back.",
        "A: I think so.\nA2: *62",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: So he went back and he finished high school. So we were residents in Tucson, Arizona, so I\ngot very cheap college, so I bought him to Tucson, he got mad because his friends went to Penn\nState and he was thinking I gonna send him, but I said, Maxie, I don\u2019t have the money, Daddy\u2019s\nsick, I\u2019m the supporter. Over there I made 110, in here I\u2019m making 50 dollars. Is one factory in\nthe whole city, so you ha -- must go here. So he got his [indecipherable] here, he was mad, but\nhe went to -- to the university. Okay. Malka finished the high school in Tucson, Arizona. Malka\nwas a honor student, she got a scholarship. My son got 20 points from psychology. From this he\ngot free from Vietnam, but for spite he didn\u2019t worked in the university like he worked in the high\nschool, so he make B plus, so Malka was fighting with him, she said, don\u2019t you know that\nMama\u2019s sick? Can\u2019t you make the plus? He said, I don\u2019t want to be the best student. But\nanyway, he traveled. When he got Bachelor degree, he walked out from the university and he\ntraveled to Europe and he got a friend in Holland. The friend went for a doctor there. I don\u2019t\nknow why he went to Holland, but he -- yeah, so when he walked out from, the dean of the men\ncalled me, he said, Mrs. Kalman, Max walked out and he\u2019s gonna go to Vietnam. And Max left\nTucson, Arizona. He didn\u2019t told me where he is going. Two days later I received, Maxie has to\ncome to stay here [indecipherable] I went over to my doctor to help me because I got cancer, I\ngot operation that time. He said, what I can do, I will do. I gonna call up the dean of the men, but\nthis wasn\u2019t enough. So th-the -- the first letter was 10 days, tomorrow I got another letter in two\ndays. So I announce on the radio, and I look on -- for Max Kalmanowicz all over. So he came\nover, he said, what\u2019s the matter with you people? I said, Max, where are you? In\n[indecipherable]. Stay. Wait for a man til he will take you to the police, or he will bring the\npoliceman to you. Then come with the policeman to Tucson, Arizona. If not you\u2019re gonna go to\nVietnam, you can -- you can -- you are not able to ha -- to -- to -- to -- to carry a gun. He got\nscared. He listened to me, he came to Tucson, Arizona with the policeman. But God bless my\ndaughter and my husband, they didn\u2019t tell me, he went to Phoenix, Phoenix is the capital. And\nover there the dean of the men took out from Scranton, his record from the high school and he\ngot the 20 points from psychology, he got free from the army. Okay, so later Maxie went back to\n-- yeah. So yo -- he wrote me a letter from Holland. He said, Mum, I\u2019m coming back to the\nuniversity. And Is -- I wrote him right away back, he -- I -- I will take maybe some\n[indecipherable] or what. I said listen, don\u2019t make this for me. Do this for you. If not you\u2019re\ngoing to go to a factory like I and Dad, and I don\u2019t want it -- you to go to a factory. In our\ncountry I wouldn\u2019t go to a factory, I was able to do something else. But in here my language and\nmy writing is no good so thank God I found a good factory. He came back, he went back to\nschool, he got the second degree, how is that --\nA2: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Huh? What is the second degree?",
        "A: A Master\u2019s. They send him to the new school to New York, yeah. And over there they gave\nhim a job, but was too much for me, 5,000 dollars a year rent and board and clothes. So they\ngave him a job in Bellevue Hospital and he worked with retarded childrens. And Malka got\nmarried and I left Tucson, Arizona, I sold the house and I moved to Israel because I got to please\nmy husband. He said about the States, I gonna stay in -- in America? No. I\u2019m going to Israel. So\nI sold and I went to Israel.",
        "A: 21 year. So Maxie wrote me -- no, sent me a cassette and he said Mama, if you not taking me\nout from this hospital, I will take -- became retarded like the childrens.",
        "A: So I took my husband, we closed our house -- I got my own house, and we went to s -- to\nMaxie, to home. I come home with the key to try open, the door is open, Maxie\u2019s home. Maxie,\nwhy you didn\u2019t wait? I received a letter from the doctor, but Maxie worked under the doctor.\nAnd he said Maxie the place is still open, and if you like, come back. He didn\u2019t go. He -- he\nchanged, he is now making commercials and writing movies. But not -- not much money, he\nisn\u2019t making much money. The commercials was good, but 10 years ago. And now the big places\nare closing, so he doesn\u2019t have a day, two days a week.",
        "A: Here? About three years ago. My husband got a heart attack.",
        "A: So I call my childrens. And I was very sick, I was three days in bed. He was calling, I wasn\u2019t\nable to go to the phone. My doctor -- they called my doctor, she said to the nurse, go over, take a\nlook what\u2019s happened to Chanka. But in the meantime I dressed myself and I walked out and I\nwas afraid to pass the street because I was shaking. So I asked a lady, I said, are you crossing\nthis street? She said yes. She said, are you -- where are you going? I said, I\u2019m going to the\n[indecipherable] such a nice woman, she said, I\u2019m going to the [indecipherable]. She saw I can\u2019t\nwalk, so she bring me to the [indecipherable] and in the [indecipherable] we had to wait for our\nend the line. She opened the door and said mis -- Dr. Rosenzeuk, take in this woman because she\nis sick. I brought her in. I told her I\u2019m going there, but I brought her in because she -- when she\nsaw me she said, Hannah, the doctor called me. So in the meantime my brother died, the same\nday. I said, Maxie, don\u2019t tell nothing to Malka, Malka\u2019s sensitive. She came right away because I\nam in bed and Daddy is in the hospital. He said, Mum, I have to send Malka, Herzkel died, I\nhave to go to bury him, because he doesn\u2019t have nobody. So Maxie went to New Haven to bury\nmy brother, and Malka to 120, both 120, Malka came the same day. She paid 1300 dollars\nbecause was no room, she took first class, was only place, and she took a car, was Friday, and\nshe came to me. She said, Mama, you\u2019re not alone. She said, Mama, I would like to go now I\nsaid no, Malka [indecipherable] because now I\u2019m afraid because the highway in both sides are\nArabs and I don\u2019t know -- and we don\u2019t know the way, nor we can see a map, nothing.

        "A: Not vodka. A better one. She said Mama everything is shaking, give me -- give me a tiny,\nlittle bit. So I said, I have -- I forgot the name, it\u2019s special for stomach, so I gave her a little bit\nand we were both sitting in bed and talking, til God helped us, six o\u2019clock in the morning. We\ndressed ourselves, we going downstairs. I said, Malka, we have to ask somebody about we w --\nhow to start. It\u2019s Saturday we can buy a map, I can buy a map, I know how to --",

And the middle way I was -- I was giving my daughter the -- the\n-- the directions. So thank God we came and my husband got an American doctor from Los\nAngeles, I was so happy. I said, an American doctor? They are better than the Israelis. Do you\nthink she knew? She told me, you can take your husband and go and see your children, he has\nonly a hole in his stomach, the heart is perfect. So my children said Mama, come with Daddy and\nyou gonna stay here three months and we will help you. I took my husband and I went to my\nMaxie, to New York. And --",

He said, Max, bring up your parents. Let them\nspeak in here because we got a -- a professor [indecipherable] and he said lies. I was able to -- to\nsee the lies. So he said, my parents are not speaking well English. Bring them up. My parents are\nlonger than your parents they\u2019re not speaking well English. But Maxie begged us, he\n[indecipherable] us. I said, Maxie, I am nervous, I am afraid, I will cry. Don\u2019t take me, don\u2019t take\nme. But the professor begged Maxie a few times to bring him down. I will tell you another story.\nIn Tucson, Arizona, a professor from the university, [indecipherable] was how you saying with a\n-- with a Reform rabbi --\nA2: A discussion. Discussion.",
        "A: -- a discussion. So the Arab start to talk such lies, and I was with my friend, but she went to\nthe university. I didn\u2019t got somebody to watch my children, but of course, I couldn\u2019t do the same\nthing. And she got a mother, so her mother watched the childrens, she went to the university. She\nbecame a laborant -- she was a in labortoium. She was from the best [indecipherable] testers. So\nI took her, I said Hannah, your English is better, come with me. What I can tell you? I stood up\nwith my broken English and I said, you are professor and you not ashamed to bring lies like that?\nHe didn't answer, he went [indecipherable] I went over to the rabbi, I said, why you came here,\nRabbi? Why you came here? Can\u2019t you answer? The rabbi respect me later like I would be a\nqueen. I said, Rabbi, don\u2019t go any more. If somebody will come, talk about Israel, send\nsomebody what he knows what\u2019s going on. Don\u2019t go any more. What can I tell you, a girl was\nsitting close me. She said stop. I said, do -- you don\u2019t like it? Change your place. You like lies,\ngo closer. This man had to stop. He said such lies. Only I can --I-I -- I said, mine God, how can a\nprofessor stay and talk to people such dumb like you? No, that\u2019s what I told him, with my broken\nEnglish.",
        "A: Yes, we are leaving -- my husband made tapes and my daughter will still -- and mine\ngrandson got Bar Mitzvah and I forgot -- I don\u2019t know, my daughter told him. I risk my life. I\ntold you I worked in the canteen in the kitchen. And I opened the ki -- the kitchen seven o\u2019clock,\nI prepared to make the fire, everything. So came to me a man. He was black like you would paint\nwith black paint. This man was wearing smutters on his feet, he didn\u2019t have shoes. Was bitter\ncold, 28 below zero. He got a cold with a gargle -- you know what a gargle, but [indecipherable]\nand he came with a pot. I don\u2019t know from where he know the place, and he start to ask me a\nfavor, to give him a little bit soup. His wife is laying in bed and his children\u2019s fever\u2019s up. He was\ndead already too. He start to bless [indecipherable] I got afraid, because I shouldn\u2019t do this. But I\nfilled up the -- the pot and I put in a raw potato, a piece of meat, I don\u2019t -- what I got, and I told\nhim right away [indecipherable] three days this man came seven o\u2019clock and after no more, this\nman died. So on the Bar Mitzvah, God bless my grandson til 120, he talked about me, what I did\nto this man. So my daughter 1s talking with him, yes, because I didn\u2019t told him. Mine husband\nfind a piece of bread from the di -- it was prichis, you know what prichis? That\u2019s like an -- you\nknow, from na -- fell down to my husband\u2019s bed a piece of bread. So my husband was thinking\nand thinking, to eat or not, to eat or -- he said, this is somebody else life. My husband gave back\nthis piece of bread. We told our daughter this. My grandson was telling this story on his Bar\nMitzvah. I risk my life in concentration camp, too. I was throwing a onion to them. If a SS man\nwould caught me, he would kill me right away. Right away. I can tell you again, no writer in this\nworld, to me, to read a book from concentration camp is a nothing. Only if a man what he was in\nconcentration camp and he was in ghetto from 1939 til 1945, yes, this book you should read, this\nis true. But not all the camps were the same. Was worser and a little bit milder. I was in the\nworst. I was Auschwitz, I was in Bergen-Belsen. Bergen-Belsen was a camp not to talk. Six\nmonths, I was six there, at Bergen-Belsen. How I survived, I don\u2019t know. My daughter -- my\nsister died. My daughter til 120. She died in Sweden. So what else you da -- you remind me a\nlittle bit because I\u2019m a little, you know.",
        "A: Ask me about, because I\u2019m a little [indecipherable] not -- not ma -- not myself.",
        "A: One thing I will tell you again. How many minutes we have? Not --",
        "A: I walked to open the kitchen. I saw a little boy with a big tallis, and the little -- was very cold.\nThe little boy cried. I took from him the tallis because his hands was red like fire. And I said,\nlittle boy, where are you going with the little tallis. He said, th-they shot my mother, they killed\nmy mother in Pabianice, this was very to L\u00e9dz. I was thinking the little boy doesn\u2019t know what\nhe\u2019s talking. I took him with me to the kitchen, because I wa -- and this little boy start to tell us\nstories, another girl came, another girl came. And he said, oh, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in\nPabianice. They killed all the Jews. They killed the j -- th-the -- the children. So we start to\nbelieve a little bit. So in this place where I worked, a man was like not normal. He wor-worked\nwith the pot over the head over. The only time I said to him, can\u2019t you work like a human being?\nHe said, if you would went through what I would, you would be mummashigo. I said, what do\nyou mean? I was digging a hole and I put in my son alive, and I had to walk away. I looked at\nhim, I said, how can be this true? You not normal. This I said to the man. He was not normal, he\nwas not, I can tell you. Because to then through thing like this, but I was thinking and sitting and\ncoming home and telling this. They said no, this can\u2019t be true, this can\u2019t be true. But in a few\ndays later we got the same thing.\nA2: [indecipherable] people, they could do everything.",
        "A: That\u2019s what the man told me. The SS man told me to dig a grave, I dig. And he put in my boy,\nand my boy was screaming, [speaks foreign language] Daddy, why you leaving me? The SS\nman, he was hitting him with the gun, and he wasn\u2019t -- he -- he lost his memory for a few days.\nHe didn\u2019t know anything about what\u2019s -- what to happen to him til they brought him to Lodz. So\nthis man told me the story, I didn\u2019t believe him.",
        "A: Time is nothing --",
        "A: -- lam happy you\u2019re taking things like that. And don\u2019t stop working, because the people what\nthey lost their lives in concentration camp, they begged us to tell people what the Germans did to\nthem. And we should go on with this, because our generation are dying. A day later, a month\nlater. We are old. We are going. The jung jen -- young generation should take over, and not to\nstop. Not to stop. History repeats and God forbid if this gonna happen again, and America is\ngoing down big anti-Semitism too. They have Germans walking around with Hakenkreuzens, I\nsaw it on my own eyes in -- in New York. Not to walk out from the houses, what\u2019s hap -- gonna\nhappen in your house. No concentration camps, no out, here in my house. If they\u2019re gonna kill\nme, in the house, no walking out.

If God forbid if history will repeat, if it\u2019s gonna be another concentration camp,\ndie in your house with your childrens, with your family. Don\u2019t go out from the houses. And\nplease listen to me and to somebody else, because we can find still smarter people from\nconcentration camp, but I have experience not to lose every day another from the family.\nEverybody together, all to live, all to die.\nConclusion of Interview\n"
