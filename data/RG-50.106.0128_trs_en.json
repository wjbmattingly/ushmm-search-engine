And then\nwhen we come home, we would go to Hebrew school every day, in the afternoon.\nThe Hebrew school was small, 1t was a shtibl like what they used to call, and the\nrebbe was there and he was teaching us Hebrew.

        "A: Before the war we were pretty much getting along with the non-Jewish\npopulation in our own city. I can only speak for my city. They were pretty nice, we\nused to do most of the tailoring for the non-Jewish -- also the Jewish too, but 90\npercent we did for non-Jews. They come in, pick material, my father would make\nthem a suit, or they would make a pair of slacks out, whatever. And we got along\npretty good. In school we used to have our little fights here and there. They didn\u2019t\nlike our curls around our -- our ears, our payos we used to wear around and they --\nsometimes we\u2019d have the boys come up and try to pull on them, you know, just\nteasing you. And we were fighting back, we -- we weren\u2019t afraid of them in school,\njust like kids here. We have our skirmishes and then we forgive each other and we\nplay again.",
        "Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism as a child?",

        "Q: Before the invasion, had any German refugees come through your town?",
        "A: We had German Jews who would come in, yes. But then again, I was too young\nto pay attention to all of that. I wasn\u2019t paying -- I remember the-they would always\nsometimes complain that the people who put them up didn\u2019t take good care of them\nas much, but we just had little. So whatever little we had we were willing to share\nwith them. But they thought maybe we didn\u2019t share enough, I don\u2019t know. I was in -\n- that\u2019s what I heard.",
        "Q: Did you get a sense from -- you know, when you were a child, did you get a\nsense from the adults that they were concerned or alarmed by events in Germany\u2019?",
        "A: Not really, because everybody was doing their daily -- going and doing their\nwork and going to the synagogue to prayers, and going to do their regular things\nthat one does during the whole day of going through. But I didn\u2019t ever see anybody\nDecember 20, 1999\nbe talking about that, or -- or you know, about -- about the -- Germany and all this\nbusiness. I didn\u2019t hear it, I was too young, I guess.",
        "Q: Did your parents ever talk about possibly leaving Poland?",
        "A: Well, we were talking about leaving. My oldest brother, he always had that --\nwanted to leave. But -- my father had two brothers in America and also a sister 1n\nAmerica. And my oldest brother, he was the main correspondent, he was writing in\nHebrew, and he would write to them all the time to see the situations here that -- not\nso good. We\u2019re not that wealthy here, we want to come to the land of honey, so to\nspeak, and he kept writing to them, writing with -- to them all these years, and\nfinally in 1937 they decided that, for one child only. And so we picked one -- one of\nthe girls to go to United States. And she did immigrate to United States in 1937.\nAnd the rest of them, then the war broke out there again and so it was too late to do\nanything then.",
        "Q: Which sister?",
        "A: Ma -- Diana. I don\u2019t know what -- what down the line she 1s, the fourth or the\nfifth, I\u2019m not sure. But she was, in 1937 in Washington, D.C..",
        "Q: What was happening in your life right before the war? When you think back on\nthe days right before the war, what was happening in your life?\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "A: Well, right before the war, my father died. That was a tragedy right there. Two\nmonths -- I think it was two months before the war, and I was only 12 at the time.\nAnd I remember going into the synagogue and talking to the man -- one of my\nbrothers was in the Polish army, and the other, the oldest brother, he was around\nwith us, he was not married yet, and I remember going with him to the synagogue.\nAnd the -- the caretaker in the synagogue told me that I should start laying Tefillin,\nat my age, you know, I was with [indecipherable] because your father died, I don\u2019t\nremember what it was, what reason, but he told me I should wear those -- start to\nwear it. And they gave me a Tefillin [indecipherable] and I started wearing with\nthe tallit. And that was -- I mean, I lost my father, I mean, you know, and the way I\nlost him is I came home one Saturday, and of course, children is children, you were\nreligious, but you still liked to play a little ballgame on the Sabbath. So we snuck\naway to go play ball. When I came home, my father was in bed, and I was only with\nmy father and my mother was home. And he told me as -- as he was laying in bed\nthat I should close the curtain on it because the sun was coming in on his -- where\nhe was resting. So I closed it up, and as I closed it up I turned to look at him, blood\nrushed out of his mouth and he told me to go get mother. So I ran in the next room,\nI got the mother and she came and she says, run for the doctor. So for me, 12 years\nyou know, running was pretty good, I could run fast. And it was only about four or\nDecember 20, 1999\nfive blocks away. And I went to the doctor and the doctor came back on the bicycle\nand I was chasing him on foot. And by the time we came he was already dead. And\nright after that, I mean, you know, things changed a little bit. But I had my older\nbrother which wasn\u2019t, you know, too bad, I mean he kept the business going, sort\nof. And --",
        "Q: Which brother was that?",
        "A: David. He was the oldest. I think one of the girls were older than him, I think, at\nleast two or one, of which I don\u2019t know which one was first. And -- and then what --\nw-we stayed there and you know, things were sort of -- we were lonesome at the\nhouse, it wasn\u2019t the same like it was. You know, you lose a parent how it is, at the\nage of 12, you miss them.",
        "Q: I'd like you to take a moment to give me a physical description of what you\nlooked like at age 12, including how tall you were.",
        "A: Well, I hi -- I remember how tall I was, I was -- for my age I was pretty tall,\nwhich helped me during the war. And then I was ab -- I was -- did wear payos\nbelieve it or not, I have the payos and tzitzit, I have the whole thing, I was like a --\nlike a Jewish boy wearing i -- in a kosher home. And I looked pretty goo -- I\nthought I looked good, I was healthy, and that\u2019s probably what saved my life.\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "Q: Is there anything else that stands out in your mind about your life before the\nwar?",
        "A: Well, the only thing I -- stands out is my be -- holidays that we had, which oh,\nthe holidays were so happy time. My mother was busy cooking and the children\nwould come over. And she already had grandchildren, I was young -- I was only, in\nthat time when they started coming in, 10 years and we already had grandchildren, I\nwas their uncle already, at the -- at the age of -- of 10 or 12, I was already an uncle.\nSo that made me -- I was playing with the little kids. I was one of them. And that\nwas the happiest time. And you sang at the table after you finish eating, it was a\nhappy time, we enjoyed ourself.",
        "Q: Please tell me about the beginning of the war. What was your experience at the\nvery beginning?",
        "A: Well, at the beginning, I wa -- my father passed away and I would have to go the\nmorning to lon -- to the city, I could say Kaddish in the morning. And as I went\nthere, I used to hear the airplanes coming already overhead. And the -- the\nsynagogue had metal roof and I could hear banging on top th -- from the shrapnels\nwere hitting it and it was noisy. But it didn\u2019t scare me, I did my job, I went to\nsynagogue, came back home to Mom. And we didn\u2019t see anything yet, but then all\nof a sudden one night we go to sleep, we get up in the morning, we woke up very\nDecember 20, 1999\nearly in the morning, the Germans invaded our city, and the whole city was shaking,\nit was a little, small town, we have cobble -- cobble o-of the streets with\ncobblestone, not regular cement, so it was noisy and the houses were shaking and\nthere was -- like it was terrible noise. The airplanes with the tanks with the -- with\nthe big trucks coming through, and it was a small town, I don\u2019t think I ever saw a\ncar in my town. Maybe a bus coming through with some people transporting, but I\nnever saw heavy -- heavy equipment like this before, so that was fascinating me\nonce | -- I woke up in the morning to look out the window. And they looked very\nscary, but as a child I wasn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t fear them, you know, I didn\u2019t know what\nthey were like until later on. You know, later on things changed. They kept\n[indecipherable] right away you ga -- within about, I would say two or three\nweeks, maybe not even three weeks they already singled us out, all the Jews were\nsingled out. I mean, we looked Jewish, we had payos, we wore the tz -- th-the -- the\ntzitzit, we had -- were never bareheaded. So they knew who we were, but the\npayos, the curls under you -- that gave it away anyway already, but still they s-\nsingled us out, the we -- they gave us -- the order came out that said we have to\nwear the Star of David, I think from four years on, a child four years and up we had\nto wear the yellow star, one in the front and one in the back. So that was right away\nidentification right there for us. And then they were coming around later on in the\nDecember 20, 1999\nstreets, grabbing you for doing all kinds of dirty work for them. And they would\nkick you and they will hit you an-and cuss you in their own language. And we did --\nyou know, you didn\u2019t get good treatment at -- tried to help them working for them,\nbut they mistreated you.",
        "Q: You mentioned that the Jewish boys were easy to identify because they had the\npayos and everything. Was there -- was there any segment of the Jewish population\nin your town that was not religious?",
        "A: True, true. We had some that didn\u2019t have those, the payos on, not as religious, it\nwas still religious, but that -- not religious. But of course in the -- the Germans\nknew who they were, and if they didn\u2019t know where they were, the Polish -- the --\nth-the Gentiles from that city soon pointed them out to them, who the Jews are.",
        "Q: Were there any acts taken against the Christian population at the beginning?",
        "A: At the beginning the only thing I remember was my -- I was introdu --\nintroduced to hanging. I was watching na -- I wasn\u2019t really watching them hanging,\nbut the next day I saw them hanging. There was at least 10 to 12 people who --\nthere was some Jews. For what reason they were, I don\u2019t know. The Polish, some\nGentiles were hung on the same hanging [indecipherable] and there were like 10\nwho were hanging there for about, I would say, a week. They left them on for us to\nlook at them. There were two Jews and the rest of them were Gentiles. We don\u2019t\nDecember 20, 1999\nknow what the reason they hung them for, but that\u2019s the introduction, I got to see\npeople right away, you know, hanging. I never witnessed that before in my life.",
        "Q: How soon did that happen?",
        "A: I would say within a week. Within a week. They must have known those people\nalready, who they are, and when they came in -- I\u2019m sure they must have had some\nspies in the city to see who was who.",
        "Q: How did they civilian population react, both the Christian population and the\nJewish population to the German invasion?",
        "A: Well, they couldn\u2019t do anything. They -- they -- no matter what -- they might\nhave been talking in private to one another, but I don\u2019t know what the -- everything\nwent about the regular way to work and come home and that\u2019s it, they didn\u2019t bother\nus with the, you know, from beginning [indecipherable] was still to go to\nsynagogue still, but this -- we went all -- later on, we s -- they -- they stopped all\nthat.",
        "Q: Walk me through the changes. How did they start to change from just the star on\nthe front and back to some of the other changes that were mentioned?",
        "A: Well, th-the first thing they change is in, I\u2019d say less than a -- I was less than a\nyear, I believe that they chased us out of our homes. We have the -- an-and we went\nto -- they -- they put a -- a ghetto, they made us a ghetto in our city. And most of the\nDecember 20, 1999\nJews were living around the area synagogue anyway. We lived next to the\nsynagogue, so our -- our zone -- we stayed in the house. And -- but we had to take\nother people in, because for -- what they did, if you lived in a -- in a section with the\nnon-Jewish area, you have to leave that area and come into the Jewish area and that\narea was -- they -- they made that a ghetto. And they blocked off all the\nintersections, they put barbed wire at every intersection with a guard and a dog, and\nyou could no lee -- you could not leave unless you had a permit, a pass, or if you\u2019re\ngoing to work. That\u2019s the only way. And then, of course, it overcrowded -- and then\nwe had, from the outskirts, some Jewish farmers we had, that lived in the little\nshtetls, outskirts of the city. And if the Germans didn\u2019t know, they took a non-Jew\nwith them, a Gentile on the -- on the Jeep to show them where the Jews lived. And\nthen they rounded them up and they told them to leave. Left the house. Whatever\nyou take with you, they\u2019ll let you take a few suitcases, whatever you want and you\nhad to wound up in this ghetto. And of course, overcrowded. You had to put up\npeople, help to one another. So food was scarce, starting to get scarce, sort of every\nday less, less, less and less. People were bribing the soldiers, they had something to\nbribe them with, but then as the thing got around you didn\u2019t have anything to bribe\nthem with any more, everything you had you gave away already. So, you couldn\u2019t\neven bribe them then. So you -- then there was a lot of suffering going on with --\nDecember 20, 1999\nespecially with food and -- and health too, because we had the overcrowding caused\nthe -- the sanitary conditions were very bad and typhus broke out. And when the\ntyphus broke out then they -- they would pick up the people with -- that had fever,\ntook them with trucks away and we no longer saw them any more. They shot them\nand killed them and buried them somewhere in the outskirts of that city.",
        "Q: You mentioned that you were in the area became the ghetto, you already lived\nthere. Were you aware of the procedures that the Germans used to ge -- to get the\nother Jews to move into that area, or had y -- were you aware of it at the time or had\nyou heard about it --",
        "A: Yes, I did. By that time I was already aware of [indecipherable] we were\ntalking in pil -- in Yiddish, wha-what they doing to us? They crowding us up, they\npushing us in in one area. We -- I see streets that I was able before to go out, go\nfreely, move about wherever I wanted to, I could not go in no more there, I had to\nstay, wait for him to let me out for some reason, unless I went to work. That\u2019s the\nonly way you could leave the -- the area. Otherwise, you stay put.",
        "Q: What about job assignments?",
        "A: Job assignments they -- they -- we knew somebody in that factory, in the\nammunition factory, and the -- the -- the man in charge of the factory gave us jobs.\nThey gave me a job, at my age and also my three sisters had jobs in there. And so\nDecember 20, 1999\nwe were able to go from the factory back into the ghetto by -- by permit. You know,\nwe worked, we didn\u2019t get anything over there, no more than you -- you eat a little,\nwhatever they gave you in -- in the ghetto, you -- whatever your portion was and\nthen when you went to the factory, they gave you a little bit of soup in the factory at\nthat time, and then back home. We did -- worked along the Gentiles, we worked\nalong, whatever they did, we did the same work they did. We didn\u2019t get paid, they\ngot paid. We got cursed at, we got beaten for it, they didn\u2019t. That\u2019s the only\ndifference I could start seeing at 12 years old, I -- 1t was hard for me to -- what\u2019s the\nword\u2019? Comprehend, I guess, or to understand why, why? What do they want? We --\nwhat did I do to them that they ha -- give me that type of a treatment.",
        "Q: Which sisters worked with you?",
        "A: [had Faige and Chaja and Yita. And I was sort of the youngest on the line. Yita\nwas two years older than I was. Chaja must have been maybe three years older than\nthe other sister. And Faige was already married. She had a child, a four year old\nchild, and her husband was also in America. He left -- they lived in a city called\nKielce and in 1937 too, he left for the United States, hoping to bring his wife, my\nsister, and a little, four year old little girl to America, and that never materialized\nbecause of the war broke out. So my sister left Kielce and moved in with us, where\nDecember 20, 1999\nwe were, and we sort of -- we stayed together, so had the little child, my mother\nwould watch her during the day so that -- you know, take care of her.",
        "Q: You mentioned that the ghetto was surrounded by barbed wire. Was there any\nother enclosure around the ghetto?",
        "A: Well, it wasn\u2019t really by barbed wire, only the streets, the fi -- the street corners\nwere barbed wire [indecipherable] wire, just say all around -- all around it, no. We\nhad just the intersections that you could not leave. They know where to block them\noff to keep you within the premises of the ghetto.",
        "Q: And who guarded the ghetto inside or outside?",
        "A: Well we had SS men and also the Ukrainians who joined the Nazi regime, and\nthey were really vicious too, just the same as the Germans were. They were our\nguards, and of course with the -- with their dogs with them, too.",
        "Q: Were they outside the ghetto or inside?",
        "A: They stayed outside, sort of, in the corner.",
        "Q: Was there any guarding, or any police service inside the ghetto?",
        "A: We had some Jewish policemen who -- who they assigned to keep a little bit of |\n-- law and order, what they thought, law and order. The Germans really were\n[indecipherable] interested in our law. But they helped people, you know. They\nDecember 20, 1999\nwere more communicating with the guards. Easier to -- police to -- to talk to the\nguard than us individually.",
        "Q: Was there a Judenrat in your s -- in your ghetto?",

        "Q: A Judenrat, a government.",
        "A: A government? I di -- I can\u2019t remember that, I was too young. I don\u2019t remember\nif they had something.",
        "Q: In your ghetto was it only Jews from your town?",
        "A: Well, from our town and also the surrounding areas. The little st -- the little\nvillages, the little shtetls. We had quite a few little ones, you know, some of them\nmaybe 10 miles away, 15 miles away from the city and they would also bring them\ninto us, overcrowded. And we were already overcrowded anyway, we had small\nhomes and big family, but that -- we were able to, you know, help out one another.",
        "Q: How did people get along inside the ghetto?",
        "A: We got along pretty good, I would say. We didn\u2019t have any problems with one\nanother, because we knew each other from before, and so it wasn\u2019t too bad. I mean\nwi -- we didn\u2019t have any disagreement with one another, no, not in the ghetto.",
        "Q: Did you witness any beatings or killings or suicides in the ghetto?\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "A: I didn\u2019t see any suicides in the ghetto. Beatings I saw, if somebody did\nsomething, I saw the Germans would throw a man down and kick him, what reason\nI don\u2019t know, I wasn\u2019t ne -- I was too frightened to go find out why, so I stayed\naway. But I did witness it, I saw them kicking them with their boots and hitting\nthem with their rifle butts as they were laying on the floor, on the ground. I did\nwitness that. But what the person did, I don\u2019t know. To me I think just merely\nbecause he want to beat him up.",
        "Q: Were you aware of anybody escaping the ghetto?",
        "A: The ghetto was not too hard, you could really get out if you want to. There was\nways, we found out how to get out so they don\u2019t see you. But there was\n[indecipherable] where are you going to escape to, because they will report you in\na second and bring you back and then you would either get killed on the spot, or\nthey would make an example out of you. So they, you know, they treated you real\nbad for that. I do remember though, my mother would sneak out sometimes to get\nfood from the farmer. We knew some of them because we would do work for them\nbefore, she happened to know this farmer. And she would sneak out in -- early in\nthe morning and go to a farm and bring back a little bit of milk and some bread\nsometimes. But that stopped after awhile [indecipherable] was unable -- they found\nDecember 20, 1999\nout the area where we sneaking out and they s -- they closed it up. That was just in\nthe beginning.",
        "Q: While you were in the ghetto, what did you know about what was happening in\nother parts of Poland?",
        "A: Myself, nothing. All I know is I was only interested within our city, what they\ndoing to us. I wasn\u2019t aware what they did anywhere else. I was too young perhaps, I\ndon\u2019t know. Maybe my w -- my more -- brothers might have known, I personally\ndidn\u2019t, until later on.",
        "Q: When you went to work, you said you worked with Jews, and there were some\nnon-Jews at work?",
        "A: That\u2019s right. We worked with the non-Jewish population in the factories, in the\nammunition factories with them. But fl -- right after that, they had nothing to do\nwith you. They were sort of like -- didn\u2019t go near you, didn\u2019t have nu -- even though\nthey -- before you -- w-we called each other, you know, so to speak, by the first\nname. And then as we were working with them, they didn\u2019t say hello and they\ndidn\u2019t say any -- a word to you, they just -- that you were -- not existed. And they\nknow that they could have helped, they could have brought a piece of bread, they\ncould have brought a -- a -- a raw potato or extra piece of bread for lunch. Throw it\non the floor, somebody -- we\u2019 ll find it, don\u2019t worry. The Germans won\u2019t see you\nDecember 20, 1999\nhanding it over to me personally, just throw it my way. I\u2019m working alongside you,\nPll pick it up. But we -- no such thing was done. So they were not that friendly to\nus.",
        "Q: Were there transports leaving the ghetto?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, not from our ghetto. We kept sort of thi -- because what they\ndid, they put every -- m-most of them to work, because we had -- we even had a -- a\nstone quarry we had, people working down -- I remember my job too, at the\nbeginning I was working up there, cutting up the big rocks for small rocks,\nchopping them up, and they gave you a certain amount you had to do for the day.\nLike you buy a cord of wood here, that\u2019s how we would pile up the stones, and they\nmeasured to make sure that they -- this -- you did your day\u2019s work. But that was\neven before the factory, I was working there. And what else can we say about this,\nwhat -- we were working in the [indecipherable] but they kept us busy, we -- I\nmean, everybody was busy. If they -- 1f you didn\u2019t go to work 1n the factory, they\ncame in with the trucks, picked you up in the -- they\u2019Il pick you up in the -- in the\nghetto, load you up on a truck, take you away. Woman, man, don\u2019t make any\ndifference, you go out and clean their vehicles, clean their barracks where they live.\nThe women would have to wash their laundry for them. And I\u2019m sure we didn\u2019t get\npaid, we -- all we got is beating. But --\nDecember 20, 1999",

        "A: Well, not in the street, they came in -- into the ghetto within the compound and\nthey would just grab people [indecipherable] men and women and sometimes\nsome of them wouldn\u2019t show back up. So what they did with them, they either\nkilled them somewhere or they shipped them away somewhere, we don\u2019t know, I\ndon\u2019t really know, but quite a few they did that. But as I say, for me to remember, I\ndon\u2019t remember who they were, I know they were friends.",
        "Q: How long were you in the ghetto?",
        "A: The ghetto I was from, I believe about til -- from 1939 -- I know I was there til\nOctober the 27 -- I do remember one -- vividly one day, October the 27\", 1942. We\nwere -- up til then we were in the ghetto and October then came and they came out\non the loudspeakers early in the morning, they banged on our doors with the rifles,\nscared to death, early in the morning, raus, raus, everybody out. Where we going?\nTo the marketplace. Everyone had to leave the area of the ghetto into the\nmarketplace. And we had to wait for the people to come over at night for the night\nshift, I wa -- I had the night shift from 11 to seven in the morning. When I came\nDecember 20, 1999\nfrom the factory they did not take us back to the ghetto, we went right to the\nmarketplace. In the marketplace we all had to stand around it until -- from five a.m.,\nI would say about til three in the afternoon, until -- til the selection started. They --\nthey started picking the -- before that even, people were coming towards the -- from\nthe ghetto towards the marketplace to walk. It was a little distance, I don\u2019t know\nexactly the amount of the distance, but on the way there they were -- the Germans\nwere screaming loud, schnell, fast, fast. And children would get separated from\ntheir mothers, and you could hear the children screaming Mom, they were\nscreaming for their mothers, the children -- and the mothers would scream for the\nbabies, they got lost for a second or so. It caused a lot of turmoil to -- to -- to get all\nthese people lined up in the marketplace. And they finally did line them up with the\nselection and that guy -- we stayed, and he would say left, right, left, right. And of\ncourse, th-the old -- the old ones, the old people and the real young, they would take\nthem right over to one section. They didn\u2019t go right, left, they just take them over,\nyou -- looked at you, you were old, over to the section. If you had children, over to\nthe section. I had one of my sisters with two children. She held onto them, both\ngirls. That was the -- my sister\u2019s named Reisl. She held onto the two children with\nmy mother, they held on, stayed together. My other sister worked at night with me,\nFaige. We came in the morning, so the child was with my grandmother -- with the\nDecember 20, 1999\nchild\u2019s grandmother, which was my mother. And when the child saw her mother,\nshe was screaming for her, she wanted her mother, but her mother -- she started\nrunning over to the mother and the German would start hitting her, kicking\n[indecipherable] back to the grandmother. He would not let her go over to the\nsister -- to -- to -- to my sister, which was the child\u2019s mother. And the ch-child was\ncrying. She finally quit crying and my -- my mother, which was the child\u2019s\ngrandmother, held onto her. Until this was lined up and I would say at -- by five\no\u2019clock it was -- everything was straightened out. They took the old people and the\nreal young and marched them towards the railroad yard. And the people that they\npicked, the younger ones, they looked like the ones that had already jobs and the\nones that didn\u2019t have jobs, but they looked young, strong, were moving over to one\narea. And after the old ones marched away from us, then they started on us. They\nstart lining us up again, checking us over again. And on the way when the people\nleft towards the railroad yard we could hear screams going on, we could hear the\nrifle shootings were going, maybe they shot in the air, I don\u2019t know, but there was a\nlot of commotion going on until these people were settled towards the railroad yard.\nAnd ones then they -- we heard they packed them in and we heard the train, the\nnoise of the locomotive and we knew they were heading away. We didn't know\nwhere they were going, we never did know where. They went to us, they lined us up\nDecember 20, 1999\nagain and they told us five in a row, and line up, and the Germans were standing\nthere, and -- with the guards and the Ukrainians. They even had the Lithuanians\nwith them, too, who joined the Nazi regime. Those were also no good. Very, very\nbad. And they lined us up and they told us to march, start marching. And we\nmarched. And you had little satchels with you, they told you to take whatever you\nwant with you, so you gra -- how much did I have? I had a little satchel with me, I\ndon\u2019t even know what was in it. Mother packed it for me, she said you take this\nwith you. So wis -- when we were heading towards the destination where they told\nus to go to march -- and on the way they kept beating us too, we didn\u2019t walk too\nfast, then they told us to jog. And it was all uphill. And the place we were heading\nfor was six and a half kilometers from the market. It was hot to -- October, very hot.\nUsually it\u2019s cool already, but that was a very hot October. We didn\u2019t have anything\nto drink from five a.m. in the morning [indecipherable] to drink, no water, nothing.\nAnd on the way they kept beating us and -- and some people were falling down on\nthe ground. Then they beat them up and they made us lift them up again and walk\nwith them, he-helping them along. We finally did come to the destination and we\nlooked and there was a camp for us. And we were not aware of it in this outskirts of\nthe town that they built -- in fact, there was two camps. They took one bunch over\nto one sa -- area, to one camp, and one to another, was two camps in that city. And\nDecember 20, 1999\nthat was the Arbeitslager, the -- what they call a slave labor camp. They -- they\ndidn\u2019t have any electric wires around us, they had regular barbed wire. But they had\nthe guards on the towers and they had guards below. And barracks. And that was a\nsurprise for us, I suppo -- we didn\u2019t even know what was going on there. They built\nit secretly. We knew nothing of [indecipherable] of it until we go -- finally got\nthere to the gate and the loudspeaker again out, and he says everybody achtung,\nachtung whatever their name is and whatever they said, and they said empty your\npockets, all that -- what you bring with you, dump into a little box, there\u2019s a box\nsitting there on the side, and the satchels went into the box. There was another box,\nthey said, take all your jewelry, all money, dump it into this other box. And you\u2019d\nbetter aboi -- abide by it because you will get killed. So we all listened, of course\nyou had to do it, otherwise you don\u2019t want to get killed over there, so you search\nyourself, make sure you don\u2019t have a nickel left. Empty your pocket, you empty it,\neverything, with the jewelry and threw it in. They pile it [indecipherable] behind\nthe gate of the camp, and assigned us to different barracks. We came into the\nbarracks and all they had was empty bunks. Was nothing over there, just wood.\nThey put us three to a bunk. It was, I think, three or four bunks high. And --and they\nhad nothing, no water, not a thing for us, just shoved us into those barracks. And we\ndidn\u2019t get out from those barracks until five a.m. in the morning the following\nDecember 20, 1999\nmorning. The -- the -- the loudspeaker again, aus, everybody aus, aus, aus, aus.\nAnd then they would give us the [indecipherable]. The ones who had jobs working\nin the ammunition factory, line up to one area. So we all knew where, you know, we\nwere already [indecipherable] so we stood in one area, then he filled in others with\nus, then they marched us towards the factory. As we came into the factory, we were\n-- they\u2019re like a -- a -- a herd of cows. We were walking in and they were stand with\nthe long whips and they\u2019re beating on us [indecipherable]. And the overseer with\nthe SS man was right there with him. With the dogs barking and screaming,\ngrabbing your legs if you didn\u2019t walk fast enough, or your clothes. And I remember\nthere was this shouting shout [indecipherable] we didn\u2019t walk fast enough to the\ngate. And that was a regular ritual with them, in the morning to go 1n we gota\nbeating and then when we left we got a beating. Either way we didn\u2019t walk fast\nenough [indecipherable] a good excuse, because we were all bunched up in one\narea, trying to get through the gate so that we can go about -- to march back to the\ncamp, and we\u2019d always get beatings over there. And then, you know, once we got\nup to the -- inside the factory compound, we all knew where our stations were. And\nthe new ones were assigned to the areas wherever they assigned them to. And we\nstayed there in that factory til almost -- I would say til 1943, or -- or the beginning\nof \u00b044, we stayed in that Arbeitslager. And there too, typhus broke out. Very bad\nDecember 20, 1999\ntyphus, I had it myself. And I lost a sister that way. One of my sisters, Chaja, they\ndrove in a truck one morning before I came back from work, the night shift. And\nseven o\u2019clock instead of letting us into the -- to the camp, they would let us in\nbetween the barbed wire, like six feet apart or something like that. And all of us had\nto stay in the barbed wire til the two truckloads came out of the camp. And these\nwere supposedly going all infected people with the typhus. And we no longer saw\nthem after that. That\u2019s -- I lost one sister right there. Of course, the others, in the\nbeginning when we had -- when the -- what do you call it, the -- when they took\neverybody, the old and the young away, in the beginning I lost a sister there, too, in\nanother town. But that\u2019s how I lost one of them. The other sister, my t -- the -- the\none that was two years older than I was, she came down with typhus. And they had,\nbelieve it or not, so to speak, a hospital. There was one room at that bunk, one bunk\nbed, on one side, one bunk bed on the other side. No blanket, no nothing to cover\nyourself with, just plain old wood. And I still til today don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t\nkill her and why they let her stay in that little hospital. She stayed there -- I would\ncheck on her every morning when I come in from work, whenever I got off I would\nalways go in to check on her, see how she is. And one morning I came in, she was\nno longer there. So I went up to the Jewish policeman which I knew, and I said --\nhis name was Muttle, Muttle Hilf. I said -- I ran into him and I said, Muttle, what\nDecember 20, 1999\nhappened to my sister? He said, she died during the night and we already buried her\nin the bottom of the stone quarry [indecipherable] a stone quarry, and we buried\nher there, but the two -- one that was two years older than I was. So I was only left\nwith one more sister in the camp, Faige. And I lost her too, as we going to come\ninto it. We stayed there in this camp, then we -- the -- the Russians advanced a little\nbit from the east coming in, and then we could hear the artillery pounding already\nand we knew something was going on. So my sister Faige and this Jewish\npoliceman got together, and there was another Jewish policeman who -- his name\nwas Moishe Herblum, he was sort of related to us, a distant cousin. She and him\ngot hooked up to work out some way that we going to try to escape from that place.\nAnd I came home from the shift -- that -- that shift I had from three to 11 that e -- in\nthe night. Came home 11, she looked me up, my sister and she says, we\u2019re going to\nescape tonight, don\u2019t tell anybody, no one. I said, okay. So she -- I said, when am I\ngoing to know when to run? She says, I'll come and get you. So she says, just be\nready, stay in front of the door in -- of the barrack and I'll come and get you. She\nand the policeman came along and got me. By that time other people knew it\nalready too, because I saw a lot of commotion, people were running. And somebody\ngot into the -- to the barbed wire and cut through the barbed wire. And as we were\nrunning, the ike -- the cue was if the lights are off, we run. So the lights were off. So\nDecember 20, 1999\nthe people what their mission was to cut the wires, they did the job. And a lot of\npeople was -- tried to fight through that little area to get out, and they got entangled\nto one another, and a lot of commotion. By that time the guard heard a lot of -- more\nnoise going on, so he took the lights and put the searchlight towards that area where\nhe heard the noise and he saw people were running out. He opened fire and I was\nrunning with my sister and the Jewish policeman together, and I got hit in the head,\nwounded, and I dropped. My sister, after I dropped I don\u2019t know what happened to\nher, o-or to the policeman. I know people were running back, the lights went on and\npeople were running in every direction, in, out, in and out. Somebody jumped on\nme with a [indecipherable] and put a scar on here, I was bleeding from here, I was\nbleeding from my head until I -- they were stampeding me. So I finally woke up and\ncame -- a few seconds, I came up to myself, I said -- I started screaming for my\nsister, Faige, Faige, and I didn't hear from her. So I said to myself, why don\u2019t I go\ninto he -- the women\u2019s barrack and look for her. So, I was a little bit disor-oriented,\nI didn\u2019t know which -- I lost a lot of blood, and I did manage to go into the\nwomen\u2019s barrack, which she shouldn\u2019t have gone in, but I took a chance, I went in\nthere. The -- the lady in charge of the barrack was one of our Jewish women from\nour city, so I knew her, sort of. So I figured she\u2019s not going to bother me too much.\nI went, Faige, Faige in th -- in the barracks, no Faige. So my -- my first cousin,\nDecember 20, 1999\nIda, she was my first cousin, she says, what are you sh -- she says, what are you\nlooking for? I was looking for Faige, have you seen Faige? She says no, she\u2019s not\nhere. And then she saw I was bleeding [indecipherable] from my head, so she\ngrabbed that shirt, dipped it in some water [indecipherable] I put it on my head,\ntried to stop the bleeding, and -- and I couldn\u2019t leave that women\u2019s barracks that\nnight, I had to stay overnight there, underneath th-the last bunk, I squeezed myself\nunderneath there. And she told me to hold this over my head, which I did. And then\n-- because all night long they were -- they were angry that we were trying to escape,\nso they were shooting all night long into the barrack with the -- with the rifles,\nboom, boom -- with the machine guns, boom, boom, boom, boom, all night long,\nuntil early in the morning it stopped, I snuck out of there and went into -- back to\nmy barrack. And three days later the rumor was sure, that we are going to be\nshipped out. My sister didn\u2019t tell me that, but that\u2019s the reason they wanted to\nescape, because we going to be shipped out. And one to the other was talking, they\nsaid here we helping, actually, the Germans. Everybody has a job, we work in the\nammunition factory, and all kind of copper foundries, each one had a job. We were\nactually helping the Germans, and if they ship us out of here, where can they take\nus? To probably [indecipherable] extermination camp. We didn't know. So my\nsister was trying to escape with me and the policeman. Now, the rumor later was\nDecember 20, 1999\naround, saying that the underground was supposed to have met us there. There was -\n- the way they worked it out, they wouldn\u2019t tell me anything about it, they didn\u2019t\nwant me to know, in case I get caught or something, so I don\u2019t have nothing to tell\nthem. It was all arra -- arranged with the partisans, who were supposed to meet that\n-- at 11 - 12 o\u2019clock in the night, and to eliminate the guard and knock the lights\nout. And it so happened there was an air raid, so the lights went off anyway, and\nthere was -- got a little bit mixed up. It so happened that the -- the partisans never\nshowed. Maybe they got some problems, they never showed. So we proceeded with\nour stuff that we said we going to do, we did. So, a lo -- some of them did escape, I\ndon\u2019t know how many, so the next morning roll call they wanted to see how many\nescaped, so they chased everybody out from the barracks and they would start to\ncount the names and the -- and they marched us over to the place where -- where we\nwere trying to escape, we cut through the wires. And right in the front of us there\nwas the policeman, wounded. My sister was there, but she was dead. But there was\nabout, I would say 10 - 15 people laying there, moaning and moaning and groaning,\nblood -- lot of blood flowing around and -- and they made us look and they took the\nmachine gun and killed every one of them. And they said this is the lesson that you\nwill learn. If you escape, that\u2019s what will happen to you. So from now on, stay put,\nDecember 20, 1999\ndon\u2019t -- don\u2019t escape any more. And this is the lesson that we learned right there.\nAnd sure enough, within about four or five days later we were shipped out of there.",
        "Q: Didn\u2019t any of the Germans notice your head wound, or your chest wound from\nthe [indecipherable]",
        "A: The head -- the chest wound they couldn\u2019t see cause I wore the jacket on top,\nyou know, th -- they couldn\u2019t see that. But my head wound they could have seen,\nbut we were -- we had ba -- you could wear anything you want on your head, a\nberet, or a hat. Then wa -- in that camp, it wasn\u2019t where you had a striped uniform\nyet. We didn't get that til later, we were wearing our ra -- normal clothes, a pair of\npants and a shirt, whatever you had, you wore. So I had a beret and I covered it up,\nand they didn\u2019t see it at all. And of course I washed everything away from the\n[indecipherable]. And they didn\u2019t check me over at all until I got to the destination\nwhere -- I\u2019m going to tell you where I came to, and then they asked questions.",
        "Q: How did these wounds heal?",
        "A: The wounds did not heal until I was liberated in 19 fort -- April 25\", 1945, I\n[indecipherable] 1945 of April the army medics, U.S. medics treated it for me. It\nwould get infected and re-infected, infected and re-infected for so long a time. Only\ntime it felt good, when you took a shower, finally they let you get -- washed it, so\nthe scab washed off and then the new scab came on the -- of course, you know with\nDecember 20, 1999\nthe sanitary conditions being so bad, that infected again, so that\u2019s what I said, didn\u2019t\nheal up til I was heal -- til the vet -- the army medics helped me after the war, after I\nwas liberated.",
        "Q: When this wound was not healing properly, did you have pain and fever?",
        "A: I would get a lot of headaches from that. Until today I still feel headaches, I\nthink it\u2019s maybe contribute to that, I\u2019m not sure. Whether I got fever, I don\u2019t know.\nI did get typhus, I had fever. So I\u2019m aware of what -- what fever is, but you know,\nyou had so many other problems, this was just a little minor thing in your life, other\nthan the wound, you know.",
        "Q: How big was your ca --",
        "A: I would say about three inches long. Right in the back here, in my head. By just\na little bit, maybe an eighth of a 16\" of an inch deeper I wouldn\u2019t have been here\ntalking to you -- this interview here.",
        "Q: So it was just a flesh wound?",
        "A: A flesh wound, but it opened up almost to the scalp, almost to the bone it\nseparated. Was pretty deep.",
        "Q: When you told me about going into the women\u2019s barrack, you said the -- the\nwoman that was in charge was from your town.",
        "A: Yeah.\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "Q: Were there other Jews from other towns in this camp with you?",
        "A: Yes, there were some other people in that camp, ou-out of towners too, yes,\nbecause they kept brining in extra people every -- every week, every day they\nbrought a few extra ones in. And some of them looked pretty strong when they\ncame in already to our camp towards the end, we were already weaklings. We\u2019re\nnot skeletons yet, but we were [indecipherable] weak. They were still strong, they\ncame from some other part maybe, where they were not mistreated yet. And so they\n-- when they came into our camp, then they learned a lesson right there, they gave it\nto them the same treatment we had. And people were losing weight. But it wasn\u2019t\njust -- Just as bad, you could still survive, yeah.",
        "Q: You also mentioned that after the escape attempt, they took the wounded and\nthey executed them. Were there any other executions as a result of that attempt?",
        "A: No. They were just threatening us, saying if we would think about again\nescaping, this w-would happen to us. But before that -- before that, the order was,\none had to watch the other, because sometimes we did have escapes. And they\nwould take just five out, innocent people, and kill them because this one person\nwould escape. They did that in the beginning when we went into the camp to be told\n-- they were telling that over the loudspeaker, every day we heard that. But during\nthat time they just killed -- they -- they just killed the wounded that were trying --\nDecember 20, 1999\nthat were on the other side of the fence, which escaped, they were already on the\nother side.",
        "Q: While you were in this camp, did you have any idea of what was happening\nelsewhere in Poland?",
        "A: Not really, no, because we couldn\u2019t talk to the people who were on the outside,\nthe non-Jews, they wouldn\u2019t tell us nothing. Not me, let\u2019s put it this way, I can\u2019t\nspeak for the whole town, maybe somebody did know. I did not know what went\non. But towards the -- later on we heard stories that -- not until I got to Auschwitz I\nheard that -- the rumors what went on.",
        "Q: Is there anything else that comes to your mind about this camp, before we leave?",
        "A: Well, before we left this camp is -- the only thing I can remember, how they\nwere doing, they -- they came out -- we had like sobriety tests like we have here for\nsomebody who drinks and drives. The policeman stops you and they make you walk\nto a straight line. And they -- there was one German there, his name was AI -- Alto,\nthat\u2019s the only name I remember, how it\u2019s possible that you could only remember\none miserable man, because he was very bad, he was bad. And he was a heavyset\nman, and I remember he\u2019d come in and everybody who was in the shift -- the worst\nshift by the way, was night shift, because that means you were in the camp all day\nlong. And all the trouble started during the day. If they needed extra help they\nDecember 20, 1999\nwould come in and drag you out of bed, and go do extra work, plus he makes sure\nhe brings you back so you can go on the regular shift. We might put that day on 16\nhours or 17 hours. And that was the worst shift. But he would come in during the\nday and have everybody outside and he would -- like target practice, he would have\nyou walk a straight line. If he knew you were sick in bed -- so-sometime you would\nsee people laying on the bed with foaming from their mouth from the high fever\nfrom the typhus. I had the typhus too. So-Some -- sometime maybe\n[indecipherable] or heavy, I don\u2019t know what it is. My sister, the one who died, she\nhad typhus, but for her, hers turned into the tu -- tuberculosis I think it turned into,\nshe never recovered, she died. They let her die on her own. That was in the a -- in\nthe camp yet. And what -- he would bring them 1n and he made you walk a straight\nline. If you did -- if you wiggled a certain way, he would put a bullet in the back of\nyour head. And this was like ta-target practice for him. And he had other\naccomplices come with him, to show them what he is doing. Trying to show them\nthat gee, he could do that too. To harden them up, I guess, like weren't hard enough.\nAnd I remember one of my neighbors, his name was Luther, I don\u2019t know his last\nname, he was my -- my age, and he had a bad case, cause he was foam -- I\nremember seeing him in the morning, he was foaming from the mouth. And he\nwould tell us to go out, so we had to leave, you could not stay inside or he would\nDecember 20, 1999\nkill you in your -- in your bunk if you stayed. And he -- that\u2019s how he died, because\nhe was wiggling when he was walking, his fever was so high that he could not walk\nstraight line. So therefore he shot him in the back of the head. This is the only one\nthat I saw him shooting, by the way, but he would do that every so often, every so\noften. I remember this young man when he was my friend, he was my neighbor\nbefore, we were living near each other. We were the tailors and they were the\ncarpenters. Yeah, we knew each other pretty good.",
        "Q: Before the escape attempt, had their been any deportations from the camp?",
        "A: No, they would only bring people in, not -- not out, just bringing them in, they\nwere bringing extra people in from other towns, but who -- I never see anybody\nleaving there until they deported everybody out of the camp.",
        "Q: Tell me about the liquidation of the camp.",
        "A: The liquidation of the camp, like I say, after we tried to escape and three days\nlater the rumor was true. My sister didn't want to tell me, but then we found one\nanother to see how they -- the people were trying to work this out with the -- with\nthe partisans somehow. And they pulled up the train and the camp was maybe a\nblock away from the -- from the railroad. We could see the railroad yard from far\naway. You know, it wasn\u2019t that far, 1t wa -- maybe it was longer than a block, but\nwe could see the cattle cars. And one day they told us to line up in the morning, and\nDecember 20, 1999\n-- and march towards the railway yard. Well again the beatings [indecipherable] on\nthe way it was the same thing, that we would walk past the -- it was constantly\nbeating, beating with the long whips, just like -- just like the cowboys here with the\nherd of cows trying to round them up, it\u2019s constantly beating, beating, beating.\nWhen we finally came towards the railroad yard they started to line up people. See,\nyou go -- to what wagon to go into, push them in. And we were packed in, 125 to\n150, I would say, approximately to 1 -- to each car. They would set us down\nbetween each other\u2019s legs so that we could fit more in. And then once was full, he s\n-- closed the door up and sealed it up so no one can open it up. And they finally,\nafter leaving and we got through, we finally pulled away, we could hear the\nlocomotives, the noise of locomotives and we were heading out, we were three days\non the road. No water. We stopped at every station. We didn\u2019t know where we were\ngoing, but we stopped in so many stations, I know, because this was not a priority\ntrain, the army has to go through first, so there was -- they let everybody else go,\nbut we stopped in so many stations, and in unison, I remember we were screaming,\nwasser, wasser, wasser, and the Germans know what wasser means, because in\ntheir -- German language | think it\u2019s the same. We didn\u2019t ask them to feed us, all we\nasked, water, water. No water was given, nothing at the station. We finally did\narrive -- we finally did arrive at the destination in three days fa -- after three days\nDecember 20, 1999\nyou finally arrived in this camp, it was very scary for me personally, with -- to see\nall these electric wires with the -- with the current would kill us, with seven foot\ntall, they had to be at least, or 10 foot tall. It was a different ballgame there. And as\nwe were looking through the barbed wire, we saw people walking around with\nskeletons, with thin and striped cap and a striped uniform an-and wooden shoes, we\nalready saw that. But the people who came to meet us in the front of the car, they\npushed those little carts. And they came and told us in Yiddish that this is [speaks\nYiddish here] we were burning, we were burning the Jews here. This 1s not a work\ncamp, this 1s strictly a killing camp. And that\u2019s when we first got to know about this\nfrom the -- from the people from within the camp, when they met us in front of the\nrailroad yard. Then they opened up the -- the car, each car -- each car separately,\nand they were saying, raus, raus. Again the same thing started with selection.\nRight, left, right, left. Even -- even we were all, so to speak, the cream of the crop.\nWe were working. We -- we were healthy, so to speak. Still they wanted, still line\nup again people, and they put them off to one end, and we went to the other end.\nThey took the -- the one end away, we don\u2019t know what happened to them, til we\nfound out later on that they took them for gas and killing and then -- and\n[indecipherable] right away. With us they took us over [indecipherable] a little bit\nyounger, they took us over and we marched towards the inside, I remember. And\nDecember 20, 1999\nwe came up to a big table, and there were SS men sitting at the table, there must be\nabout 10 of them, and they had some kind of instruments 1n their hands. And that\u2019s\nwhere they were tattooing us. So we rolled up our sleeve and they gave us our\nnumbers on the arms.",
        "Q: What is your number?",
        "A: My number is A18991. A18991. And they tattooed everybody. Next from the\ntattoo -- and mind you, we still didn\u2019t get any water. We still -- it\u2019s already\n[indecipherable] three days now, no water at all, nothing. We were tattooed, then\nthey checked us over, they told us to go into [indecipherable] the barbers were\nstanding, and women and men, their hair was cut off. Before, in our camp, where\nwe came from, the -- the Jewish population in that camp, the women wore the hair.\nThey cut their own a little bit shorter, but when we came to Auschwitz, they\nchopped all the hair off, they took off that the girls looked like boys already,\neverybody looked the same. And that\u2019s when they noticed, the barber, I don\u2019t know\nwhether he was a German, or whether he was one of the -- from the camp workers\n[indecipherable] but he asked me about my wound. The first time. He asked me\nabout my wound so I told him I had a fight inside the car. We were pushing each\nother trying to get to the -- which was true, we were trying to get to that little\nwindow to get a breath of air. And there was fighting, really fighting going on in\nDecember 20, 1999\nthat car with us. And then -- so I told him I got hurt that way. He took -- he didn\u2019t\nquestion me after that. Shaved if off. It felt better after he cut away all the hair, but\nagain it still was infected. And after the haircut they told us we had to go get a\nshower. So they lined us up again and like in a maze where you couldn\u2019t get out any\nmore. You got in, you couldn\u2019t get out. And we went in, they gave us -- they told us\nto leave our clothes on the inside and when we came out on the other end of the\nshower, we had our striped uniforms ready with our wooden shoes and we got\ndressed, went back into the barrack and we stayed there in the barrack. Finally\nsomebody brought in some buckets of water to get -- to get drink. And you could\nhave dranked up a whole bucket yourself as thirsty we were. And we -- they\ndelivered the water and then during the night -- during the night was a terrible noise\ngoing on next door to our barrack. Very noisy.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to interrupt you for just a moment because we need to change tape.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nDecember 20, 1999\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: -- of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection\ninterview with Henry Greenbaum. This is tape number two, side A. And you were\n-- you had finished telling me about your transfer from one camp to the other, but\ncan you give me the names of those camps, please?",
        "A: The camp -- my camp was called just an Arbeitslager camp. And the factory\nthat I worked in was called Hermann Goering factory. But the destination that we\nevacuated our camp, we came to a camp and it was called Auschwitz. And I do\nremember Auschwitz had this famous sign, Arbeit Macht Frei, work makes you\nfree, I guess that\u2019s what the translation is. But that was Auschwitz that we came to\nbefore we got -- after -- after the train stopped and we were unloading, and the\nGermans were screaming aus, aus, aus, everybody. So you know, you have to jump\nout of the carload real quick. My -- my legs were entangled with people that I\nthought they were sleeping all night, I thought, because we started on the floor, and\nwhen we came to the destination I could touch the roof of that car. So I was laying\non top of other people, and I thought they were sleeping. But then I found out after I\ngot out, got myself free and I jumped out and I saw all these people -- I don\u2019t know\nthe exact amount, but quite a few were dead, never left the car, because they were\nsuffocated, from not giving us any water, or enough air. And people were fighting\nDecember 20, 1999\nwith one another trying to get a little bit of air. So there was quite a few dead on that\n-- on that train.",
        "Q: When you say Auschwitz, are you referring to Birkenau, do you know?",
        "A: Birkenau, Auschwitz, it was in about the same area where you came to.\nEverybody says Auschwitz, but I believe where you really drive up to is almost, it\u2019s\ncalled Birkenau, I think, but --",
        "Q: So wer-were your barracks brick or wood?",
        "A: I believe ours was wood, wooden barracks, I think.",
        "Q: Before we had to change tape, you were telling me about your first night in -- in\nAuschwitz. Could you continue?",
        "A: Okay. After we -- during the night when we spend -- in the first night in our\nbarrack, we heard a lot of noise going on next door barrack. I mean, not just noise,\nbut screams, screams, people were like with s-somebody be cutting somebody or\nhurting somebody. And this went on almost, I would say half of the night, until the\nnext day we found out from other sources, from people around there, from -- that\nhad been in this Auschwitz camp longer than we were told us that that night was\nthe Gypsy night and they were killing all the Gypsies that night. And that\u2019s where\nthe noise came from that we found out the next day.",
        "Q: And your first day in Auschwitz?\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "A: The first day really not -- well, we didn\u2019t do too much over there, just hung\naround in the barrack and just talking to one another. And we did walk out a little\nbit, we had to wait for our food, they give us this little piece of bread in the\nmorning. A little piece of bread th-th-the thickness of two slices of toast, I would\nsay. Black bread and some ersatz coffee, which was imitation black coffee, we had\nthat in the morning, early. And after that, eating for three days and drinking, this\nwas like nothing compared to what we did where we were before. But a little bit\nmore to eat, we had extra soup over there because we -- when we went to the\nfactory, in the Arbeitslager. But here so far we didn\u2019t get just -- just this bread in\nthe morning and the watery soup in the evening. And then we were hanging around\nevery day the same, talking to one another and we could smell the stench in the -- in\nthe -- in the camp. Of course by that time I already knew what it was. Th-The\npeople that worked there told me, I was aware already what this is -- was. And now\nand then we would also help picking up bodies in there. They would grab you, say\ncome on, go to work, they -- and they would give us one of these carts, we\u2019d go\nahead and pull somebody just naturally dying in the -- on the street. We would take\nthem and put them -- put them on a pile next to the crematorium over there, we\u2019d\nput them 1n a pile like -- like y -- like you pile up wood, they were laying there. And\nwe didn\u2019t do too much other things than that, just a -- until one day. I was there, I\nDecember 20, 1999\nthink about -- I would say at least six months, until this German well-dressed man\ncame in, into the camp. And we -- we were sort of -- we picked out the youngest of\nthe groups and we lined up and he went and gave us a selection, he looked us over.\nAnd he would point to go over towards him. So I was the one that he picked. Went\nover to him, I wasn\u2019t aware of what he picks me for, I was not sure. But then they\ntook us on a truck after that and they took us to another camp called Buna, B-u-n-a,\nBuna-Monowice | think it\u2019s called. They took us to that camp and we got to get\nthis man to -- he was giving us jobs. I don\u2019t know how many he got out of there,\nmaybe it was 50 - 100 people, I don\u2019t know the exact amount. But he took a pretty\ngood group, I\u2019d say two truckloads and we went over to Buna. And from --",
        "Q: I want to ask, before you get to Buna, I have one or two questions\n[indecipherable] Auschwitz.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: You said you were in Auschwitz for about six months. During that time did\nanybody notice your head wound?",
        "A: Nobody. No-Nobody own -- nobody even noticed it because when they gave us,\nit was a striped little cap that I wore. So that covered it up, too. The only time they\nwould see it maybe -- I don\u2019t think they ever noticed it on me, but if I did I was\nDecember 20, 1999\nprepared to tell them that I got hurt on the -- on the wagon, on the train, on the cattle\ncar.",
        "Q: While you were there for those months, just waiting, what could you see around\nyou? How far could you see around you as to what was happening?",
        "A: Well, I could see -- I-I was roaming around in the -- in the camp, I was seeing\nwhat people looked like, they -- they were already skeletons in that camp. We were\nnot yet skeletons, we had a little bit more food where we came from. And there, the\npeople over there, they would just look like skeletons, it scares you. Some of them\nwere laying on the ground, they couldn\u2019t walk, they couldn\u2019t talk any more, sort of.\nAnd it\u2019s the only thing that I saw, there was not too much to observe except the\nsmokestack. You could see the smokestack coming -- the -- the -- the smoke out of\nthe chimneys. We could see plenty of that, but the stench by that time I was already\naware of what it is.",
        "Q: From where you were in the camp, could you look out to any area that was not\npart of the camp?",
        "A: There was nothing to see, it was just a empty area. I don\u2019t n -- I couldn\u2019t see\nmuch out there. I could see empty areas where I was facing. Maybe some woods far\naway, that\u2019s about the only thing I could see.",
        "Q: Now tell me about Buna, how did Buna compare to Auschwitz?\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "A: Well, Buna was a little bit cleaner than Auschwitz because Buna was already\nlike a working camp. At least we didn\u2019t have any crematoriums in there. They did\nhave punishment by hanging in that camp, but not crematorium, no burning people\nin that -- Buna-Monowice. And this man picked us up and the job that I was\nassigned to was to I.G. Farben company. And so anyway, so we did get -- we were\nstill able to get a little bit extra soup over there in the -- in the Monowice in the\nfactory. So we would get -- actually you would get a piece of bread in the morning\nin -- in Buna with the black imitation coffee. Then around one, two o\u2019clock in the\nafternoon they give you a little water soup, a little bit extra. And then when we\ncame home, to home, when we came home back to the camp, we got another watery\nsoup. You had a spoon with you, but believe me you didn\u2019t need a spoon, there was\nnothing there to eat with a spoon. There was cabbage, you couldn\u2019t find a piece of\ncabbage. Or turnips, you couldn\u2019t find a piece of turnip. It was just watery soup,\nyou could drink it. So that made us a little better in that camp, I think, it looked a\nlittle bit cleaner too in th -- in that Buna camp. Like I say, every morning we would\nget up, and -- get up in the morning, get to -- get this little piece of bread and on the\nway you would -- sometimes they would transport us by truck. If it was foggy --\nthey used to be very foggy sometimes there that you couldn\u2019t see but maybe 10 - 15\nfeet away in front of you. So they would put us in trucks to take us to the factory\nDecember 20, 1999\nback. But of course -- and in the factory the same thing what happened there. We\ndidn\u2019t get as much beating, but you still had guards with you, so you had to watch\nyour [indecipherable] you couldn\u2019t talk to one another. If we did, we -- he\u2019d -- in\nthe evening -- they wouldn\u2019t bother you while you were talking, but before you left\nto go back to the camp, they would call you into a certain area, you know, like an\noffice where they were and they would ask you, why were you talking so much to\nthis man? What were you talking about? What we talking about, we hungry, we\ntalking about food. We talk about -- we not have -- and we talk about the families\nwe lost, that kind of talk, that\u2019s all the talking that we did. And one day he didn\u2019t\ntake -- he didn\u2019t take that and he gave us -- there were chairs that you put your head\nthrough, your knees on the ground, your stomach on the seat of the chair, and they\ntake your -- take your shirt off and they would give you a whipping with a whip.\nAnd when you get through, your back looked like a city map, a road map, with the\nbeating that we used to get. So you were actually -- you were not a -- you shouldn\u2019t\nhave been able to talk to nobody. Just do your work and don\u2019t say nothing to one\nanother.",
        "Q: Were you able to form any bonds with any of the other prisoners, though? Any\nfriendships, though?\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "A: Yes, we did. We -- we did. We s -- we -- we were -- the guys we kept together\ntrying to help one another, we did. Specially by when we were marching later on.\nBut then the -- why we -- when we came, we sort of kept with one another too. I\nhad this one young man, he was my bunkmate. That happened in Buna. And in\nBuna we used to get air raids. And the air raids would come also to the -- to the\nI.G. Farben company, too. And while we were in I.G. Farben company, the\nGermans had a German kitchen there for themselves, or maybe for the non-Jews,\ntoo, I don\u2019t know. But all I know 1s whenever the air raid came and that young man\nwould find out where the kitchen was, he was running to the kitchen to see what\nthey threw out. And he would sometime come back with food, like so -- sour soup,\nold -- old -- that they throw out in the trash. And I used to tell him, I told him, I\nsaid, don\u2019t go, you\u2019re going to get hurt, don\u2019t do that. No, he said, I\u2019m hungry. I\nsaid, I\u2019m hungry too, but I\u2019m not going to do this. And he went, and he finally did\nget caught. When it\u2019s -- his punishments was hanging. And he didn't listen to me\nwhen I tried to -- to warn him. He was my bunkmate, we were three of us in a bunk.\nHe was my age. I don\u2019t remember his name it\u2019s been so many years. And we had to\ngo out there and watch three -- three guys -- three and him, four guys were hung in\nthe -- in that -- Buna. The German got up and he read a protocol. I don\u2019t know what\nit was, what he was reading, I didn\u2019t understand a word he said. And then after he\nDecember 20, 1999\ngave the -- the order, and one of us -- not me, but the people of [indecipherable]\nand they had ropes around their neck, and he was one of them, I don\u2019t know what\nthe other ones were punished for, but I know he was punished strictly for just\ngetting just a little bit sour soup out of a trashcan that they -- that the German\nkitchen threw outside. That was his punishment, that\u2019s only no -- that\u2019s the only\nthing I know about it. And after that, after they were hung, the people who were the\n-- they had a regular band, instead of you know, we all were sobbering and sorry to\nsee this little boy, especially me, I felt very bad, my friend. And they started playing\nwith the cymbals and the drums and the things like you go to a -- to a high school\nfootball team, what th -- a hi -- a game, when they play after it\u2019s finished. And this\nis what the Germans, they -- they think of the -- or -- or -- or the -- the Nazis,\nwhatever they were, think of -- of a Jew. Or of anybody, to kill anybody. Inhumane,\ninhumane, it\u2019s the only thing I can describe it, that\u2019s what they are. Inhumane.",
        "Q: Were you ever beaten?",
        "A: Oh yes, I got beaten when I was just telling you previously, when he asked us\nwhy we were talking. And we went to his office and he didn\u2019t go for it when I told\nhim we were talking about food and we were talking about family, he didn't -- he\ndidn't believe us, so he gave both of us a beating with, like I say, you get on your\nknees, rest your stomach on the chair, the head went through the back of the -- of\nDecember 20, 1999\nthe chair, and you t -- without your shirt, and he was whipping you with a whip.\nAnd more you -- more you screamed, more beating you got, so you had to calm\ndown and don\u2019t scream, try not to scream so maybe he won\u2019t give you bad beating.\nBut I remember my -- for two, three weeks my back looked like a -- like a road map\nfrom the beating.",
        "Q: Was that the only time you were beaten?",
        "A: That\u2019s the only time I got that kind of beating, yes. I used to get plenty of\nbeatings with the rifle butts, that I got plenty. Kick, rifle butt, hit with the -- slap in\nthe face, hit with the -- sometimes they would hit you with the -- with a ladle when\nyou try to -- somebody pushes you to the front to get the food, you get hit. I don\u2019t\nknow who these were, were these capos or were they Germans, I don\u2019t know, but I\ngot hit plenty of times with that, too. Mostly rifle butts as you were walking,\nmarching.",
        "Q: How long were you in Buna?",
        "A: In Buna I\u2019m not really sure, I think -- in Buna [ think it\u2019s -- I really hi -- I think\nmaybe also about six or maybe a year to something like that, I don\u2019t quite remember\nthe time. But I know that the -- the war started already, the allies got into the war, I\nthink, at the time. And the Russians were coming he -- already in from the east, we\nDecember 20, 1999\ncould hear all this banging away. We saw some activities with the bombing, so we\nknew something went on. And --",
        "Q: Is there anything about Buna, or about Auschwitz that you didn\u2019t mention that\nyou would like to talk about?",
        "A: Well, th -- Buna was a little, like I say, we didn\u2019t have any crematoriums there,\nthat\u2019s the only good reason, although it probably is not that far away from\nAuschwitz anyway, it was a subsidiary of Auschwitz anyway, and -- and\nBirkenau, it all in one line, I think, all those three. But there 1s -- it was a little bit\ncleaner. I remember I was looking out, I used to look out in Buna and see a sign, it\nwas 37 miles or 38 miles to -- to Krak\u00e9w and I would always say, if I get out of\nhere, that\u2019s where I\u2019m going to go, to Krakow, big city, which I never made it out\nof there, never made it, never materialized. We were shipped out of Buna when the\nallies, I think, started coming in, they started bomb -- bombing the I.G. Farben\ncompany what they were bombing that time and I remember being with English war\nprisoners in that camp. But they were dressed well, their shoes -- they shined -- their\nshoes were shined, they looked well cleaned, well fed and they were working in the\nstreets picking up dirt, too, like -- and we were working in the -- I was -- myself, I\nwas building the roads 1n -- in the -- in birk -- in I.G. Farben, my job was to build\nthe roads. My job was the curbs, set up the curbs and then -- then the guy came with\nDecember 20, 1999\nthe sand, with the cobblestones, you know, this kind of stuff, that\u2019s what I learned\nin there after I left the -- the Hermann Goering factory, that\u2019s what I did in I.G.,\nbuilding roads. And then I left from there and they put us on the marches again.\nFirst they put us on trains from there, and then the allies were bombing the trains,\nand there was like a cat and mouse. They were bombing the rail and then they\nrepaired the rail, they started again, and again they bombed it. So they gave up,\nwanted to start marching us. And we were marching, marching and I came to a\nplace called Flossenbirg after that.",
        "Q: Do you know when they marched you out of Buna?",
        "A: What -- end of \u201940 -- it was almost -- probably be \u00b044 already then, I think. I\u2019m\nnot too sure of the dates.",
        "Q: How long were you marched?",
        "A: Until I was liberated, march and the train, m-mostly marching until I was\nliberated. At first we came to -- to Flossenbirg.",
        "Q: How long to Flossenburg?",
        "A: In Flossenburg we stayed there, like again, not too long, I -- not quite a year, I\ndon\u2019t think, we stayed there. And there -- my job over there was to sort clothes and\nthere was a pile of clothes, I mean two stories tall. And we were out there s --\nsorting clothes. Matching up shoes, tie them together, men\u2019s clothes from ladies\u2019\nDecember 20, 1999\nclothes separating. Gloves, eyeglasses, all separated in that camp. They had -- other\npeople had other jobs over there, they used to work, I think in a -- in a airplane\nfactory, I think Messerschmitt was there, now that I know where it is, I was told\nthat there is -- a factory was right there. But my job was not that, my job was just to\nsort clothes over there. And there our men -- we didn\u2019t do too much, we didn\u2019t,\nexcept for sorting the clothes. And of course we -- by that time we already\nskeletons, starting to lose a lot of weight by then. And I remember one day in\nFlossenburg the Red Cross came to visit us, and we had to clean up that camp that\nyou could not find um -- it was always clean anyway, there was no food to throw\naway, and [indecipherable] paper, nothing, cleaned up clean. And that time they\ngave us, instead of that water soup, they gave us -- I -- the only way I can describe it\nwould be like Cream of Wheat, thick Cream of Wheat. And we said wow, all of a\nsudden we\u2019re getting that, maybe because of the visitors. We never talked to them,\nwe saw them talking to the Germans, and they would come around and pointing\nbarracks out. They even had us go out there and play soccer in front of them. We\ncould hardly walk, but we played soccer. You know, we still young, like young\nkids, you don\u2019t care, you still want to kick a ball, you know, you were so young yet.\nAnd I remember them playing and then, couldn\u2019t they see our faces? They could see\nhow we look. The Red Cross couldn\u2019t be that dumb, that naive that they can\u2019t see\nDecember 20, 1999\nthat we get this kind of food every day, that -- the way we looked? They could have\nseen that. Then after they left, back in to the water soup.",
        "Q: During the times that -- the time that you were in these camps, the Arbeitslager\nand then Auschwitz and then Buna, did you have any idea what was going on with\nyour remaining siblings?",
        "A: No. No, I did not know. For one re -- think I didn\u2019t know is because my -- one of\nmy brothers joined the Polish army, Zachary. He was -- they drafted in the Polish\narmy, so I never knew where he was. Then I had my oldest of the brothers. He\nescaped before the Germans came into my town. And by that time we were on a\nfarm because we were still living in the home. So when the bombing started my\nmother -- my father was already dead, my mother knew this guy at the farm\n[indecipherable] used to do work for. He came with the horse and buggy and\npicked us up and took us into his farm until the bombing stopped. And luckily we\ndid because there was a lot of shrapnels in our house that flew in with -- from the\nbombs. I mean, big chunks. So we were sort of lucky that we didn\u2019t stay there. But\nwhile we were on the farms, we were outside, I remember til today, I was eating\ntomatoes that were like, I mean, real tomatoes, big. Take off the vines and eating\nthem in the farm. And my brother was out there and he saw the soldiers coming\nthrough with torn up -- these Polish soldiers coming with torn uniforms, and ripped\nDecember 20, 1999\n[indecipherable]. So he was t -- asking them in Polish, where are the Germans,\nwhere? He says, they\u2019re not far from here, you know, maybe a few kilometers from\nhere. So he took off, my brother, walking with that soldier somewhere. I ma -- later\nhe said he separated from him, but my brother walked, he says 1100 miles, I don\u2019t\nknow, that\u2019s what he tells me and he went to Vilna. From Poland to Vilna he\nescaped into the woods, and I was trying to chase with him, but he chased me back,\ngo back to your mother, he was -- I -- til today, I -- I don\u2019t forgive him that. I tell\nhim, I said, why you did not take me with you? He said, what am I going to do with\na little boy? I was -- hardly knew where I\u2019m going. So I mean, I -- you know, I\ncould understand that. But he chased me back and I went back to my mother and he\ndidn\u2019t even say goodbye to my mother, he ran off. So I didn\u2019t know where he was.\nAnd the others, I already saw the three of them die, you know. So -- and then I\nknew the one sister here. Where she lived, I did not know. I know she d -- she was\nin the United States, but I didn\u2019t know where.",
        "Q: How were you transported out of Flossenburg?",
        "A: Of Flossenbirg was strictly marching. Marching from Flossenburg. Where we\nwere marching, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Describe the march for me, please.\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "A: Well, we were marching five in a -- in a row. We tried to help each other, if one\nwas weak, we tried to put his arms around the next one. By that time we sort of\nweak, we lost our weight already, we started losing weight. And marching in the\nwoods. Sometime we come through a town, and why the German population tell me\nthat they -- after liberation they told me that they were not aware of all this, is\nbeyond me because we used to walk through this, sometimes a little town and we\nwould have the Hitlerjugend out there with rocks. They\u2019re throwing the rocks at us\nand spitting at us and calling us all kind of names. So I am sure that they were\naware of it, maybe they didn\u2019t want to tell us that. But then we marched\n[indecipherable] food got scarce some -- again at -- when we were marching\nbecause they didn\u2019t have the supplies. Like you have an army, you have the -- the\nsupplies come with them, we didn\u2019t have that. We had to -- we had to wait until we\ncame to a farm. And if the farmer was nice -- nice enough to give us some raw\npotatoes, then tha-that\u2019s all you can get. You will not -- you will not get bread.\nYou'll get a raw potato, you'll get a turnip or something like that. Which helped. If\nhe was nice, but sometimes we went through farms they wouldn't give us anything,\njust stayed over overnight and continued.",
        "Q: What happened to those who couldn\u2019t go on?\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "A: Well, the ones they couldn\u2019t go on, we -- we all know what happened. They fell\nand they -- they -- they shot them. They shot them right on the spot. And then they\nmust have had some other people marching in the front of us because sometimes we\nwere then -- would run across bodies that were laying in the ditches with the striped\nuniforms on. So we n -- we were already aware of what happened to them. And you\ncould see always their eyes open, the sku -- front skull was always out, because they\nhad these certain bullets, the -- the -- from the guns that they was using that if you\ngot hit in the back of the head, the whole front of the skull would go out. And we\nknew that that\u2019s -- the man didn\u2019t die th -- on his own, but he was shot. And we\nmarched and marched un-until we were liberated. It was somewhere in -- in\nBavaria where we were liberated. And one morning -- we stayed there overnight\nand we were in a circle. We\u2019re staying in the woods and wa -- I remember eating\nberries and the next morning you got up and I was looking for berries. They might\nhave been green from -- the blueberries yet, I knew what they looked like, I ca -- I\nremember that, but I was eating [indecipherable]. They had a little creek coming\nthrough here and I remember drinking water out of that creek. And then I heard low\nflying planes coming through, a lot of commotion. And then we\u2019re seeing trucks\ncome in. We weren\u2019t that deep into the woods where we could see the road. We\u2019d\nsee a lot of trucks, tanks, but we didn\u2019t know who they belonged to, whether they\nDecember 20, 1999\nwere Germans, or Russian, or American, we didn\u2019t know who they were. As we\nwere sitting around a circle, a big tank came along and knocked all the underbrush\nand some trees down to get to us. And we thought they were what -- they going to\nkill us here, probably. And then lo and behold this one jumped out, a boy jumped\nout, blonde hair, short [indecipherable] hardly have any hair, in Polish he says,\nhey, you are free. But before that, to back up here just a few seconds, before that we\nwere -- while we were sitting, after all this commotion we heard, we saw the -- th-\nthe guards disappearing. They left us sitting by ourselves and they just\n[indecipherable] they had at least four of them with the four dogs, they\ndisappeared. So we, a-as a -- as already experienced in trying to escape and got hurt,\nI told them, better stay put, because it might be a trick. So they listened and we all\nstayed there. By that time, after we didn\u2019t see them, and this tank came along, and\nthen we saw we were free by that time. Oh, was that -- that was a feeling that\u2019s just\nhard to describe, what that means. We were hugging that guy, kissing that guy, we\ndidn\u2019t know what to do with him. But then he jumped back up on the -- on the tank,\nI remember this time, to throw at us some rations. And I remember the -- the block\nof candy that they had. That was hardly [indecipherable] we were fighting like cats\nand dogs to get it. So he saw he\u2019s not going to win here. So he stopped. He says,\nfollow me behind the tank and we\u2019ll get you across to a -- to a farmer house. And\nDecember 20, 1999\nyour friends already there liberated, a lot of them. So when we went across the road\nwith him, walked behind the tank. We came in and then the guy had mixed up some\n-- [\u2019|l never forget the front of the door, next to the entrance, mixed up some big\ntrays of whatever -- whatever they used, with potato peelings and white powder\nmixed up, some kind of ca -- stuff. So it must have been for the animals, I suppose.\nAnd we didn\u2019t get it -- we didn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t wait to go into -- inside the door, we\ndidn\u2019t know what they going to give us there. So of course everybody was fighting\nover this, until the farmer came outside yelling at us, don\u2019t eat this, this is for the\npigs and the -- don\u2019t eat this. And he was take us away, and he told us to go inside\nthe house. Once we came in the house we saw a big table, people were sitting,\nlaying on the floor, some of them already sick from overeating. And some of them\nwere eating bread that I -- first time I saw a big chunk of bread like this, in my life,\nyou know, for five years. And I started eating too. I got a little bit sick too from it.\nAnd then the medics came in, that\u2019s the medics when -- when they healed my\nwound on the head. I told him about it and he shaved it and he put a bandage on it,\nmedicine on it. I don\u2019t remember if he gave me some pills to take, that I can\u2019t\nremember. But I know he gave me some pills to take for my stomach, cause we\nwere sick, all of us were sick. He says, don\u2019t overeat, just go slowly. Don\u2019t -- don\u2019t\n-- don\u2019t do too much. But we were -- water [indecipherable] stop drinking for that\nDecember 20, 1999\nday. It\u2019s hard to describe a day like this, you know, it\u2019s -- for the lifetime. And we\nwere liberated and that was it.",
        "Q: At liberation, were you with anybody still from your hometown?",
        "A: Yes, I was with my -- quite a few from my hometown, my friends. We sort of\ndecide to stick together, one another, help one -- we said, if one gets weak while\nyou\u2019re marching, let\u2019s help him, put him under the arms an-and -- because if you\ndidn\u2019t, if you get left towards the end when everybody walks and you get stopped,\nand you keep walking away from him, they kill him on the other end. And I do\nremember then, three nights before we were liberated, and it was near Neuenburg\n[indecipherable] that was in baria -- in Bavaria. He chopped away a few people\nfrom our group, I don\u2019t know how many, and he told them to go the other direction\ninto the wooded area. And as we were marching away from there a mile or two we\nheard lot of gunshots going. And they killed them. Three nights before, they just\nkilled them over there. And somehow, I don\u2019t know whether they had -- they had\nthe grave ready for them or not, but when we came back -- because that was the\nnearest little town for us to come back to, Neuenburg [indecipherable]. When we\ncame back we were told that they -- the army discovered the freshly dug grave, and\nthey didn\u2019t know who that -- what it was. So this captain, I remember he had two\nlittle bars on the top of his shoulder, I think he was a captain, I can\u2019t remember his\nDecember 20, 1999\nname. And he says he gave orders that Sunday after liberation, the non-Jews -- that\nthe Gentiles are going to church, they cannot go to church that day. And then he had\nall the carpenters build boxes, coffins. And they came over there and they had to dig\nout the grave, that was hardly covered. The Germans, they had to take the -- the\nGermans had to go down there and they take the bodies -- we -- were seeing -- we\nsee -- that\u2019s where we saw that this -- these people belonged to our group, that we\nlost three nights before we were liberated. And I remember seeing the soldiers,\nAmerican soldiers crying, they were -- tears came out of there. And usually a\nsoldier is harder, th-they\u2019re tough. But they were saying how these people got killed\nand shot in the head. It was just inhumane. And they made these people put them in\nboxes and they put them on a truck and they took them to a regular cemetery there\nin -- near Neuenburg [indecipherable] and they put them in the cemetery, all in\none grave, but each wa -- each body in a coffin, that I do remember. And that was\njust three days, they didn\u2019t -- their luck was not there. When I was liberated I did\nsee a few of my friends, yes, from my own town, even, that we got -- th-then we\nhad a -- from out of town we had a lot of that we\u2019ve got -- became friends with. We\nstuck together, a-all til I was separated an-and sent to this country and they went to\nEngland, some of them.\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "Q: You told me the story a little while ago about following behind the tank. How\nmany of you were there at that time?",
        "A: Maybe a hundred. That\u2019s about it, I think. Maybe less.",
        "Q: And do you know what part of the American army liberated you?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know, but I know this -- this young man spoke Polish, so his parents\nwere from Poland. He was not Jewish, he was not a Jew, he was Gentile. But his\nparents came to the United States from Poland years ago, and he was born in\nAmerica, but he could still speak a few words.",

        "A: What means free, you don\u2019t have a guard near you, you\u2019re free to roam around\nwherever you want to. It is a good feeling, the best feeling in your life. The worst\nfeeling is when they take your freedom away from you, this 1s the worst. And I can\ntell the difference, and the difference makes a lot if you\u2019re free. It was unbelievable,\nunbelievable. You -- you thought the heavens opened up and the Messiah came\ndown here. The freedom, it was unbelievable to -- t-to see that happen, at the time.",
        "Q: What did you look like when you were liberated?\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "A: I was a little -- skinny, little -- little boy. Bones. You could -- you could count\nevery rib in my body. I must have weighed maybe 75 pounds probably. That\u2019s\nexactly what they -- this is the way I was fed. I know I was very thin, and weak.",
        "Q: Were you at this height, your full height?",
        "A: No, I was not in my full height, I started growing a little bit, I thought, after that\nbecause I didn\u2019t have any food, so I don\u2019t think the food -- the gr -- the growth\ndidn\u2019t come in til I started eating normal food again.",
        "Q: You mentioned that you had someone from the U.S. Army treat your head\nwound. Did you see how other freed prisoners were being treated?",
        "A: They -- everybody was treated really, really nice by the American soldiers, they\nwere very, very nice. And they treated us royally, really. They took good care of us.\nThey were watching us to see we don\u2019t overeat, and the ones that were overeating,\nthey gave us medicine to take. And they really took good care of us.",
        "Q: Did you witness any acts of retaliation or retribution against former guards or\ncollaborators?",
        "A: I be -- leaving Flossenbirg -- when we left Flossenbiurg, we had this one guy in\nFlossenbirg that every morning we would get a speech. He -- he\u2019s -- he\u2019d\n[indecipherable] pounding. He would say, don\u2019t get excited over this, he says,\nyou ll never make it out of here. He says, I'll make sure of that, before you get out,\nDecember 20, 1999\nthat you\u2019ll all be dead. In the meantime, after we got liberated, we came out of\nthere, we saw that man on th -- in -- somewhere in the trenches laying dead.\nSomebody killed him, I don\u2019t know who. Now who this man was, I don\u2019t know. He\nwas the blockalteste they call him, in charge of the barrack, whoever he was.",
        "Q: After liberation, what was the first thing you chose to do?",
        "A: The first thing I chose to do 1s food, was my number one prorioty. And then --\nthen I was trying to get myself together, started to think about my family right\naway. So I said, where are these people, I don\u2019t -- I knew I had a sister in America,\nI didn\u2019t know where she lives. I knew I had it, so with every soldier I saw I told him\nI have a sister in America, and | thought it was New York, the ba -- th-the capital\nof America is in New York, I didn't know. I didn\u2019t know it was Washington, and\nthen -- til I met my brother and he happened to have the -- the address and he wrote\nto my sister in the States -- United States, and she sent papers for us.",
        "Q: Which brother?",
        "A: Zachary.",
        "Q: After liberation, where did you live?",
        "A: After the liberation we lived in -- I lived in different places. I was in Neuenburg\n[indecipherable] first, and then we moved to Zeilitzheim, near Frankfurt. There\nwas a DP, displaced person camp, and I remember the UNRRA, run by UNRRA\nDecember 20, 1999\n503, I remember the number, I still got a picture of it, too. And there we came back\nlike to civilization. We came in there and there were beds for each one of us with a\nmattress, with a pillow, with a cover. We had a kitchen. Whether it was kosher, I\ndon\u2019t know, but we did have a kitchen and we had lots of -- we had plenty of food\nto eat in that -- in that displaced person camp. And then we were scrounging around\nfor clothes, started dress, you know, nicely. And we were able to do that, and\nwaiting to get to this country. And also, I was also -- before I came to this country I\nwound up working with the American soldiers. They chose six of us. They took us\nin to work for them. Our job was to hand the food out to the soldiers. So we had\nbeen -- we had a -- a check on the fingernails and the hands every morning before\nwe handed the food out. We didn't wear gloves, but he made sure that our hands\nwere washed clearly -- clean and -- and we handed out all the food to the soldiers.\nSo we got along fine. We -- we lived with the soldiers within the compound and we\n-- we were one of theirs. So I hated to separate them, but -- you know, but I had to\nleave for this country, I had to come meet my sister. But they treated us real nice.",
        "Q: How did you reconnect with your -- with your brother and the other family and\nfriends?",
        "A: Well, this one brother who was in the Polish army, was Zachary, I heard -- one\nof my cousins, the one that helped me the bleeding in the camp, she survived, Ida.\nDecember 20, 1999\nAnd Ida found out that her brother is liberated somehow. And he is in a cor -- ina\nplace called L\u00e9dz. I am not sure, but I think it was L\u00e9dz. And before she left, I\nhappened to visit her in Bergen-Belsen. She -- she survived in Bergen-Belsen, so I\nwent to visit her there, and we were talking, she said she\u2019s going to go to L\u00e9dz, go\nsee where her brother is. So I said, while you\u2019re going there, I said, maybe you\u2019 ll\nrun into brother. And sure enough when she talked to her brother, her brother said\nthat my brother has also arrived there. And they got in touch, so my brother sent a\nnote with her saying that I should come to visit him. And I was a little bit scared to\nbe anywhere except being with the U.S. Army. I was safe with them, and I felt that I\nshouldn\u2019t go no place. And we got back to him and told him, wrote him a li -- a note\nsaying that he -- if he wants to see me he has to come to Zeilitzheim, near\nFrankfurt, and I'll be there. And he decided, and he did come. When he came we\ngot hooked up together. And we still didn\u2019t know what happened to the older\nbrother until we found out, after we wrote to my sister in the United States, she told\nus that Dave, the oldest is in America too, already living with her. He came in 1941\nto this country, through -- from Lithuania through Japan, from Japan to the\nUnited States. He came just before Pearl Harbor, by maybe a month or so. And so\nhe was -- he yel -- he escaped all the punishment from all the concentration camps.\nHe was the lucky one, I think. So we all wound up here in America with my sister,\nDecember 20, 1999\nthree guys living with my sister. She took us in, all three of us. She fixed up her --\nher attic with hardwood floors, beautiful up there. We really had a nice place to live\nup there. She fed us well. My sister Diana. And she treated us royally, really, like\nshe would be our mother.",

        "Q: Did you ever go back to your pre-war home?",
        "A: No, because I had a bad taste over there and I said I would never go back\nbecause my -- I could only spe -- I cannot speak for all Poland, I\u2019m sure there must\nhave been some kind Polish people, but in my town, no. My town, nobody would\nhelp you, no one would help you. So therefore I had a bad taste and I don\u2019t -- I\ndon\u2019t intend to go back there ever, I don\u2019t think.",

And then we saw what happened. And then of course I -- I was always\nthinking about my mother and the other sisters that were taken away and I didn\u2019t\nknow where they were taken away and I still was hoping someday that maybe\nthey\u2019re alive, but -- but it\u2019s not so. They perished somewhere.",
        "Q: You said you were in DP camp, but were you living with the other prisoners, or\nwere you staying with the Americans?",
        "A: No, in -- in the DP camp I stayed with the -- with all our people in the DP camp.\nBut after that, when we got -- the six of us got jobs with the American soldiers, they\ntook us out of there and we no longer went into that DP camp, we stayed with them\nin the -- in their barracks. In fact, there was a building in there that we stayed with.\nWe had our own beds and we stayed with them. We even wore the uniforms. We\ndidn\u2019t have any insignias, no sn -- no -- no anything like that, but we wore the --\nthey gave us the uniforms we were wearing and handing out the food. We didn\u2019t\nhave to wash dishes, we didn\u2019t have to scrub floors. So the ge-ge --the German wor\n-- prisoners did have to do that, thank God of that. They didn\u2019t ask us to do all that.\nBut we was really treated real good by the Americans, no complaint at all.

        "A: Well, we talked about our families, where the families are, and what this one\ncan\u2019t find, what he can\u2019t find. And then the most al -- our young -- young life in the\ncamp, especially me, my teens. 12, and I didn\u2019t come out til I was 17 or -- 17, I\nthink? 12 - five -- 17 years old. And you know, I lost all my youth, and you can\u2019t\nget that back any more. I lost my whole -- my education. I was not -- they -- they\ndeprived me of my education. All I had was seventh grade. How much can I learn in\nseven grade? [indecipherable] I learned in the seventh grade, and they take away\nthe pencil and the paper and the books from you, for five years you don\u2019t see it,\nbelieve you me, I don\u2019t remember a thing. It was hard to even think anything that I\nremember from the school, whether it was Hebrew or -- or -- or -- or the regular\nschool. I couldn\u2019t remember too much at all about that, because as I say, I was\ndeprived of all that. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about. Then we were talking\nabout families where you have -- everybody was jealous of me that I had a sister\nhere in America, and Ill be -- I\u2019ll -- in fact, I came one of the earliest, cause I came\nhere 1946 when I came to this country, one of the second boats, I think, that it --\nwith the -- the displaced persons.\nDecember 20, 1999",

        "A: Nothing, the DP camps, I mean we -- we had some education going on, but th --\nI didn\u2019t feel like -- I was not in the mood to learn anything there about -- I was\nthinking about coming to this country. And when I came to this country, yeah, my\nsister was always telling me I should go to school, and I went to night school here,\nlearned the language a little. I learned a lot from the soldiers, but you know, you\nlearn their language sometimes from soldiers. But when I came here, my sister\nwould go to the movies with me, she would [indecipherable] me sometimes to see\ntwo pictures at the same time, you know, one after the other. And that\u2019s where I\nlearned most of my English.",

Up and down, sideways, they were going\neverywhere, every direction. And until -- I didn\u2019t see much from -- after I got off,\nbut then my brother, the oldest, met me, David, he met me at the -- at the -- at the --\nwhere we got off from the boat. And he took us into the city. And then when I saw,\nI couldn\u2019t get over it, how tall those buildings are. We looked like real flies t -- t-to\nsee the buildings like that, so big and tall and so many. There\u2019s so many beautiful\nthings in this country, although -- I mean, Germany had it -- some of it too, but I\nmean, I didn\u2019t really see much over there. But the United States there was --\nespecially in New York, it was so pretty, it was so beautiful, I couldn\u2019t get over it. I\nreally liked everything that I saw. My brother took me over to see my aunt. He says,\ncome on. My -- my uncle already passed away. He says, while we here, let -- I\u2019ll\ntake you over -- sh-she lives in Brooklyn somewhere, I\u2019m not sure where it was,\nand he took us over there. And na -- she was all right, she didn\u2019t give me such a\ngood greetings like she\u2019s supposed to. But she was busy cooking, I guess [Il\nDecember 20, 1999\nforgive her. She was pretty nice. But she didn\u2019t ask too many questions. People -- a\nlot of people didn\u2019t want to ask too many questions in those days. First I didn\u2019t beli\n-- they didn\u2019t think something like that can happen and you still be alive. And there\nwas just a lot of silence going on. And when I came here, my sister, yeah, she\nwanted to know everything what happened to the rest of the family, and I explained.\nI had to meet my brother-in-law in -- in -- in -- I think it was in Coney Island he\nhad -- that I met him, and then he took me back to his place where he was in\nBrooklyn. He had a -- a shoe factory, ladies\u2019 shoes. And he said he did not get mar\n-- he\u2019s waiting for [indecipherable] to say you tell me, is my sister dead? And I\nsaid, yes, I\u2019m the witness, I saw her, we were trying to escape, she got shot, she 1s\ndead. He said, now he is going to go on with his life. He was waiting all these years\nfor her, hopefully that she would come down here and she didn't make it. And he\nwas so -- and so -- what would be the right word? Kind, or not -- I don\u2019t know right\nword to say, he was waiting for her. He didn't want to get married until he heard\nfrom me that she 1s -- that she is dead. And then he -- after a few months later he\nmet somebody, he married and got a life of his own then.",

        "Q: After you came to this country, how were you able to support yourself?",
        "A: Well, my sister supported me for awhile. And then, I didn\u2019t want too much\nhandout. I was already 18 years old, I got to be able to do something. And being I\nwas familiar with metal and I worked in the factories, I -- my first job was with\nKugart and Dubb. And that -- they were -- this company was making checkout\ncounters for all the grocery stores, for those giant Safeway\u2019s and my job was to\nwork with the steel [indecipherable] long time. [indecipherable] to -- to cover the\nmetal -- to cover the wood with metal. And I was working for them for awhile. And\nafter that, of course, I met my wife. So I met my wife in the -- and my future father-\nin-law told me, this is not a job for a Jewish boy. Sheet metal work. He says, you\ncome and work for me in the clothing store. So I got a job with him. And after that I\nstill wanted to be on my own, I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t like it. So after we got married,\nwith -- I got -- took a job with a department store, my -- my sister knew this guy in\nthe Landsberg\u2019s department store, that\u2019s before you, I think, I don\u2019t think you will\nremember that. It was a nice department store here. And he gave me a job, his name\nwas Eric Rapp, R-a-p-p, Eric, he still sees me all the time, says, I gave you the\nDecember 20, 1999\nfirst job in America, I said, you\u2019re right. And he gave me a job and he told me to be\nstock boy, because of the language. I couldn\u2019t speak too -- I was speaking English,\nbut not that good. But then I worked for about three, four months in Landsberg\u2019s, a\nstock boy, he told me one day, Henry, I want you to put on a suit and a tie and nice\nclean shined shoes and come on in. And I did, and he put me on the floor to sell. So\nI was tell him, I said, Mr. Rapp, I can sell, but how do I get the names from the\npeople? I don\u2019t know how to spell the names. And I still remember it, the words he\ntold me, he says, in this country you don\u2019t have to worry about it. Ask you how you\nspell your name. Even if it\u2019s a Smith, you say, how do you spell it? And so goes\nwith the same with the address, and people will tell you how to spell it. So that\nshouldn\u2019t be a problem. So I got in, I was doing good, I was working there for six\nyears after that.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t tell me how you met your wife.",
        "A: Oh, okay. I met my wife with my sister, when I was living still with my sister.\nShe had friends in Baltimore, so she was always traveling to Baltimore in\nweekends. So I went along with her, me and my other brother Zachary, we went\nthere with her. And this older gentleman who was in the house that she was visiting,\nhe was visiting too.

Why shouldn\u2019t they be able to go into\nthe same bathroom, for instance as we -- as the whites go on the same water -- or\nlive in the same area?

It\u2019s\nbeen 50 some years now. In the beginning no one was interested, nobody wanted to\ntalk about it. They want to shove it under the table like nothing happened. How can\nyou shove something like this under the table? Six million Jewish people and\nchildren killed, and plus five, I think or six others, for other reasons that were killed.\n12 someth -- 12 million people died. And thank God the -- that the museum is here,\nbecause us survivors, how long are we going to be here? Another 20 years, I --\nhopefully, and then -- well, no, you have now some professors or book writers\ntrying to write the book saying that the Holocaust never existed. But how can they\nsay that? We are here. The survivors are still here. And once we go, then they\u2019Il\nhave to look up into the museum, see our records, our talks, our speeches, our\ndocumentaries that we gave. They\u2019 Il have to pay attention to that. So\n[indecipherable] now, what gets me too is, wa -- if they don\u2019t believe us survivors,\nwhy don\u2019t they check with the army?

So these people trying to make a -- a fast dollar,\nDecember 20, 1999\nwriting these books that the Holocaust never existed -- when I go into the museum I\nthink I\u2019m in a memorial place. I\u2019m thinking of coming to visit my parents, I\u2019m\nthinking it\u2019s a cemetery here. I have nowhere to go to, to see my mother, my other\nsiblings that have passed away, or they\u2019re killed, they took them and murdered\nthem. I go there, I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m like am-amongst them.

In those\ndays you had the iron and it was hollow inside, and they would put some kind of a\ncoal it looked like and you would have to lay it on the floor and blow at it to get it\nstarted. And I would start the iron for them. And just help cleaning up a little bit, th-\nthe scrap stuff that they were cutting away, that\u2019s about it. Then go to school.",

And -- and\nwith my father, before the school started, early in the morning we\u2019d go for prayers,\nand of course in the -- in the evenings [indecipherable] we used to go. And\nShabbas, every holiday we would ob-observe. I mean s -- the dietary laws were\nDecember 20, 1999\nstrictly -- I mean, enforced in our house. And if you had red handles and blue\nhandles, everything meant differently. One was for dairy and one for -- was the\nmeat. And we also had dishes for Passover separately. So we were pretty religious\nat home.",
        "A: My favorite holiday was Passover. That was our favorite holiday. The reason, we\nused to get all new clothes, new shoes, new -- new shirts, we\u2019d always dress up for\nthat holiday. And there were lots of goodies to eat, besides the matzoh. My mother\nwas pretty good then at baking all kinds of goodies.",
        "A: I went to both. I went to public school and also the religious school, too. In the\nPolish -- in the regular school we used to, you know, go t -- go like t -- you go here,\nlike, you know, to learn the language and the history of Poland, I guess. And then\nwhen we come home, we would go to Hebrew school every day, in the afternoon.\nThe Hebrew school was small, 1t was a shtibl like what they used to call, and the\nrebbe was there and he was teaching us Hebrew. And then we\u2019d finish, went home\nand eat -- and eat and do your homework and that\u2019s it.\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "A: Not re -- I used to like -- the Hebrew was my really -- I used to love that, I\nlearned and -- and -- believe it or not, that I don\u2019t know too much now, I have\nforgotten most of it, all of my Hebrew. And I forgot Polish too, I didn\u2019t -- you\nknow, I was too young, and I didn\u2019t learn -- up to about seventh grade, what could I\nlearn up -- by seventh grade? Not too much.",
        "A: Well, believe it or not, in my house they were always teasing me what I\u2019m going\nto be, and I used to tell them I\u2019m going to be a rebbe [indecipherable]. Somehow,\nI don\u2019t know what that got into me and I would tell them I\u2019ll be a rebbe and a\n[indecipherable]. I used to like the rebbe and th -- and they used to come dressed\nwith their payos, you know. On Shabbas they would dress real nice and I used to\nsay that\u2019s what I wanted to be. But that never materialized.",
        "A: For fun we used to play soccer, mostly, then like kids, played around, all kind of\ngames, you know, Hide and Seek, you know, all kind of game, like -- like\neverywhere else, children do. We have our own games to play with. Ride the\nbicycles, that kind of thing.\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "A: Before the war we were pretty much getting along with the non-Jewish\npopulation in our own city. I can only speak for my city. They were pretty nice, we\nused to do most of the tailoring for the non-Jewish -- also the Jewish too, but 90\npercent we did for non-Jews. They come in, pick material, my father would make\nthem a suit, or they would make a pair of slacks out, whatever. And we got along\npretty good. In school we used to have our little fights here and there. They didn\u2019t\nlike our curls around our -- our ears, our payos we used to wear around and they --\nsometimes we\u2019d have the boys come up and try to pull on them, you know, just\nteasing you. And we were fighting back, we -- we weren\u2019t afraid of them in school,\njust like kids here. We have our skirmishes and then we forgive each other and we\nplay again.",
        "A: Not -- there was always something a little bit, but I was too young to even realize\nwhat that even -- what that word meant even, anti-Semitism. I didn\u2019t realizes this til\nlater on in life.\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "A: I myself did not fi -- hear anything. If my parents did they never told me about it.\nI -- I was not aware of it. I don\u2019t even know who he was or even he existed until\nlater on.",
        "A: Ef -- during when I got -- during the war I heard about it, af-after I -- when the\nGermans invaded our city then we -- then the news came around to -- then it was\nmore open, people were talking about it.",
        "A: We had German Jews who would come in, yes. But then again, I was too young\nto pay attention to all of that. I wasn\u2019t paying -- I remember the-they would always\nsometimes complain that the people who put them up didn\u2019t take good care of them\nas much, but we just had little. So whatever little we had we were willing to share\nwith them. But they thought maybe we didn\u2019t share enough, I don\u2019t know. I was in -\n- that\u2019s what I heard.",
        "A: Not really, because everybody was doing their daily -- going and doing their\nwork and going to the synagogue to prayers, and going to do their regular things\nthat one does during the whole day of going through. But I didn\u2019t ever see anybody\nDecember 20, 1999\nbe talking about that, or -- or you know, about -- about the -- Germany and all this\nbusiness. I didn\u2019t hear it, I was too young, I guess.",
        "A: Well, we were talking about leaving. My oldest brother, he always had that --\nwanted to leave. But -- my father had two brothers in America and also a sister 1n\nAmerica. And my oldest brother, he was the main correspondent, he was writing in\nHebrew, and he would write to them all the time to see the situations here that -- not\nso good. We\u2019re not that wealthy here, we want to come to the land of honey, so to\nspeak, and he kept writing to them, writing with -- to them all these years, and\nfinally in 1937 they decided that, for one child only. And so we picked one -- one of\nthe girls to go to United States. And she did immigrate to United States in 1937.\nAnd the rest of them, then the war broke out there again and so it was too late to do\nanything then.",
        "A: Ma -- Diana. I don\u2019t know what -- what down the line she 1s, the fourth or the\nfifth, I\u2019m not sure. But she was, in 1937 in Washington, D.C..",
        "A: Well, right before the war, my father died. That was a tragedy right there. Two\nmonths -- I think it was two months before the war, and I was only 12 at the time.\nAnd I remember going into the synagogue and talking to the man -- one of my\nbrothers was in the Polish army, and the other, the oldest brother, he was around\nwith us, he was not married yet, and I remember going with him to the synagogue.\nAnd the -- the caretaker in the synagogue told me that I should start laying Tefillin,\nat my age, you know, I was with [indecipherable] because your father died, I don\u2019t\nremember what it was, what reason, but he told me I should wear those -- start to\nwear it. And they gave me a Tefillin [indecipherable] and I started wearing with\nthe tallit. And that was -- I mean, I lost my father, I mean, you know, and the way I\nlost him is I came home one Saturday, and of course, children is children, you were\nreligious, but you still liked to play a little ballgame on the Sabbath. So we snuck\naway to go play ball. When I came home, my father was in bed, and I was only with\nmy father and my mother was home. And he told me as -- as he was laying in bed\nthat I should close the curtain on it because the sun was coming in on his -- where\nhe was resting. So I closed it up, and as I closed it up I turned to look at him, blood\nrushed out of his mouth and he told me to go get mother. So I ran in the next room,\nI got the mother and she came and she says, run for the doctor. So for me, 12 years\nyou know, running was pretty good, I could run fast. And it was only about four or\nDecember 20, 1999\nfive blocks away. And I went to the doctor and the doctor came back on the bicycle\nand I was chasing him on foot. And by the time we came he was already dead. And\nright after that, I mean, you know, things changed a little bit. But I had my older\nbrother which wasn\u2019t, you know, too bad, I mean he kept the business going, sort\nof. And --",
        "A: David. He was the oldest. I think one of the girls were older than him, I think, at\nleast two or one, of which I don\u2019t know which one was first. And -- and then what --\nw-we stayed there and you know, things were sort of -- we were lonesome at the\nhouse, it wasn\u2019t the same like it was. You know, you lose a parent how it is, at the\nage of 12, you miss them.",
        "A: Well, I hi -- I remember how tall I was, I was -- for my age I was pretty tall,\nwhich helped me during the war. And then I was ab -- I was -- did wear payos\nbelieve it or not, I have the payos and tzitzit, I have the whole thing, I was like a --\nlike a Jewish boy wearing i -- in a kosher home. And I looked pretty goo -- I\nthought I looked good, I was healthy, and that\u2019s probably what saved my life.\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "A: Well, the only thing I -- stands out is my be -- holidays that we had, which oh,\nthe holidays were so happy time. My mother was busy cooking and the children\nwould come over. And she already had grandchildren, I was young -- I was only, in\nthat time when they started coming in, 10 years and we already had grandchildren, I\nwas their uncle already, at the -- at the age of -- of 10 or 12, I was already an uncle.\nSo that made me -- I was playing with the little kids. I was one of them. And that\nwas the happiest time. And you sang at the table after you finish eating, it was a\nhappy time, we enjoyed ourself.",
        "A: Well, at the beginning, I wa -- my father passed away and I would have to go the\nmorning to lon -- to the city, I could say Kaddish in the morning. And as I went\nthere, I used to hear the airplanes coming already overhead. And the -- the\nsynagogue had metal roof and I could hear banging on top th -- from the shrapnels\nwere hitting it and it was noisy. But it didn\u2019t scare me, I did my job, I went to\nsynagogue, came back home to Mom. And we didn\u2019t see anything yet, but then all\nof a sudden one night we go to sleep, we get up in the morning, we woke up very\nDecember 20, 1999\nearly in the morning, the Germans invaded our city, and the whole city was shaking,\nit was a little, small town, we have cobble -- cobble o-of the streets with\ncobblestone, not regular cement, so it was noisy and the houses were shaking and\nthere was -- like it was terrible noise. The airplanes with the tanks with the -- with\nthe big trucks coming through, and it was a small town, I don\u2019t think I ever saw a\ncar in my town. Maybe a bus coming through with some people transporting, but I\nnever saw heavy -- heavy equipment like this before, so that was fascinating me\nonce | -- I woke up in the morning to look out the window. And they looked very\nscary, but as a child I wasn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t fear them, you know, I didn\u2019t know what\nthey were like until later on. You know, later on things changed. They kept\n[indecipherable] right away you ga -- within about, I would say two or three\nweeks, maybe not even three weeks they already singled us out, all the Jews were\nsingled out. I mean, we looked Jewish, we had payos, we wore the tz -- th-the -- the\ntzitzit, we had -- were never bareheaded. So they knew who we were, but the\npayos, the curls under you -- that gave it away anyway already, but still they s-\nsingled us out, the we -- they gave us -- the order came out that said we have to\nwear the Star of David, I think from four years on, a child four years and up we had\nto wear the yellow star, one in the front and one in the back. So that was right away\nidentification right there for us. And then they were coming around later on in the\nDecember 20, 1999\nstreets, grabbing you for doing all kinds of dirty work for them. And they would\nkick you and they will hit you an-and cuss you in their own language. And we did --\nyou know, you didn\u2019t get good treatment at -- tried to help them working for them,\nbut they mistreated you.",
        "A: True, true. We had some that didn\u2019t have those, the payos on, not as religious, it\nwas still religious, but that -- not religious. But of course in the -- the Germans\nknew who they were, and if they didn\u2019t know where they were, the Polish -- the --\nth-the Gentiles from that city soon pointed them out to them, who the Jews are.",
        "A: At the beginning the only thing I remember was my -- I was introdu --\nintroduced to hanging. I was watching na -- I wasn\u2019t really watching them hanging,\nbut the next day I saw them hanging. There was at least 10 to 12 people who --\nthere was some Jews. For what reason they were, I don\u2019t know. The Polish, some\nGentiles were hung on the same hanging [indecipherable] and there were like 10\nwho were hanging there for about, I would say, a week. They left them on for us to\nlook at them. There were two Jews and the rest of them were Gentiles. We don\u2019t\nDecember 20, 1999\nknow what the reason they hung them for, but that\u2019s the introduction, I got to see\npeople right away, you know, hanging. I never witnessed that before in my life.",
        "A: I would say within a week. Within a week. They must have known those people\nalready, who they are, and when they came in -- I\u2019m sure they must have had some\nspies in the city to see who was who.",
        "A: Well, they couldn\u2019t do anything. They -- they -- no matter what -- they might\nhave been talking in private to one another, but I don\u2019t know what the -- everything\nwent about the regular way to work and come home and that\u2019s it, they didn\u2019t bother\nus with the, you know, from beginning [indecipherable] was still to go to\nsynagogue still, but this -- we went all -- later on, we s -- they -- they stopped all\nthat.",
        "A: Well, th-the first thing they change is in, I\u2019d say less than a -- I was less than a\nyear, I believe that they chased us out of our homes. We have the -- an-and we went\nto -- they -- they put a -- a ghetto, they made us a ghetto in our city. And most of the\nDecember 20, 1999\nJews were living around the area synagogue anyway. We lived next to the\nsynagogue, so our -- our zone -- we stayed in the house. And -- but we had to take\nother people in, because for -- what they did, if you lived in a -- in a section with the\nnon-Jewish area, you have to leave that area and come into the Jewish area and that\narea was -- they -- they made that a ghetto. And they blocked off all the\nintersections, they put barbed wire at every intersection with a guard and a dog, and\nyou could no lee -- you could not leave unless you had a permit, a pass, or if you\u2019re\ngoing to work. That\u2019s the only way. And then, of course, it overcrowded -- and then\nwe had, from the outskirts, some Jewish farmers we had, that lived in the little\nshtetls, outskirts of the city. And if the Germans didn\u2019t know, they took a non-Jew\nwith them, a Gentile on the -- on the Jeep to show them where the Jews lived. And\nthen they rounded them up and they told them to leave. Left the house. Whatever\nyou take with you, they\u2019ll let you take a few suitcases, whatever you want and you\nhad to wound up in this ghetto. And of course, overcrowded. You had to put up\npeople, help to one another. So food was scarce, starting to get scarce, sort of every\nday less, less, less and less. People were bribing the soldiers, they had something to\nbribe them with, but then as the thing got around you didn\u2019t have anything to bribe\nthem with any more, everything you had you gave away already. So, you couldn\u2019t\neven bribe them then. So you -- then there was a lot of suffering going on with --\nDecember 20, 1999\nespecially with food and -- and health too, because we had the overcrowding caused\nthe -- the sanitary conditions were very bad and typhus broke out. And when the\ntyphus broke out then they -- they would pick up the people with -- that had fever,\ntook them with trucks away and we no longer saw them any more. They shot them\nand killed them and buried them somewhere in the outskirts of that city.",
        "A: Yes, I did. By that time I was already aware of [indecipherable] we were\ntalking in pil -- in Yiddish, wha-what they doing to us? They crowding us up, they\npushing us in in one area. We -- I see streets that I was able before to go out, go\nfreely, move about wherever I wanted to, I could not go in no more there, I had to\nstay, wait for him to let me out for some reason, unless I went to work. That\u2019s the\nonly way you could leave the -- the area. Otherwise, you stay put.",
        "A: Job assignments they -- they -- we knew somebody in that factory, in the\nammunition factory, and the -- the -- the man in charge of the factory gave us jobs.\nThey gave me a job, at my age and also my three sisters had jobs in there. And so\nDecember 20, 1999\nwe were able to go from the factory back into the ghetto by -- by permit. You know,\nwe worked, we didn\u2019t get anything over there, no more than you -- you eat a little,\nwhatever they gave you in -- in the ghetto, you -- whatever your portion was and\nthen when you went to the factory, they gave you a little bit of soup in the factory at\nthat time, and then back home. We did -- worked along the Gentiles, we worked\nalong, whatever they did, we did the same work they did. We didn\u2019t get paid, they\ngot paid. We got cursed at, we got beaten for it, they didn\u2019t. That\u2019s the only\ndifference I could start seeing at 12 years old, I -- 1t was hard for me to -- what\u2019s the\nword\u2019? Comprehend, I guess, or to understand why, why? What do they want? We --\nwhat did I do to them that they ha -- give me that type of a treatment.",
        "A: [had Faige and Chaja and Yita. And I was sort of the youngest on the line. Yita\nwas two years older than I was. Chaja must have been maybe three years older than\nthe other sister. And Faige was already married. She had a child, a four year old\nchild, and her husband was also in America. He left -- they lived in a city called\nKielce and in 1937 too, he left for the United States, hoping to bring his wife, my\nsister, and a little, four year old little girl to America, and that never materialized\nbecause of the war broke out. So my sister left Kielce and moved in with us, where\nDecember 20, 1999\nwe were, and we sort of -- we stayed together, so had the little child, my mother\nwould watch her during the day so that -- you know, take care of her.",
        "A: Well, it wasn\u2019t really by barbed wire, only the streets, the fi -- the street corners\nwere barbed wire [indecipherable] wire, just say all around -- all around it, no. We\nhad just the intersections that you could not leave. They know where to block them\noff to keep you within the premises of the ghetto.",
        "A: Well we had SS men and also the Ukrainians who joined the Nazi regime, and\nthey were really vicious too, just the same as the Germans were. They were our\nguards, and of course with the -- with their dogs with them, too.",
        "A: They stayed outside, sort of, in the corner.",
        "A: We had some Jewish policemen who -- who they assigned to keep a little bit of |\n-- law and order, what they thought, law and order. The Germans really were\n[indecipherable] interested in our law. But they helped people, you know. They\nDecember 20, 1999\nwere more communicating with the guards. Easier to -- police to -- to talk to the\nguard than us individually.",
        "A: Ah, what is?",
        "A: A government? I di -- I can\u2019t remember that, I was too young. I don\u2019t remember\nif they had something.",
        "A: Well, from our town and also the surrounding areas. The little st -- the little\nvillages, the little shtetls. We had quite a few little ones, you know, some of them\nmaybe 10 miles away, 15 miles away from the city and they would also bring them\ninto us, overcrowded. And we were already overcrowded anyway, we had small\nhomes and big family, but that -- we were able to, you know, help out one another.",
        "A: We got along pretty good, I would say. We didn\u2019t have any problems with one\nanother, because we knew each other from before, and so it wasn\u2019t too bad. I mean\nwi -- we didn\u2019t have any disagreement with one another, no, not in the ghetto.\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "A: I didn\u2019t see any suicides in the ghetto. Beatings I saw, if somebody did\nsomething, I saw the Germans would throw a man down and kick him, what reason\nI don\u2019t know, I wasn\u2019t ne -- I was too frightened to go find out why, so I stayed\naway. But I did witness it, I saw them kicking them with their boots and hitting\nthem with their rifle butts as they were laying on the floor, on the ground. I did\nwitness that. But what the person did, I don\u2019t know. To me I think just merely\nbecause he want to beat him up.",
        "A: The ghetto was not too hard, you could really get out if you want to. There was\nways, we found out how to get out so they don\u2019t see you. But there was\n[indecipherable] where are you going to escape to, because they will report you in\na second and bring you back and then you would either get killed on the spot, or\nthey would make an example out of you. So they, you know, they treated you real\nbad for that. I do remember though, my mother would sneak out sometimes to get\nfood from the farmer. We knew some of them because we would do work for them\nbefore, she happened to know this farmer. And she would sneak out in -- early in\nthe morning and go to a farm and bring back a little bit of milk and some bread\nsometimes. But that stopped after awhile [indecipherable] was unable -- they found\nDecember 20, 1999\nout the area where we sneaking out and they s -- they closed it up. That was just in\nthe beginning.",
        "A: Myself, nothing. All I know is I was only interested within our city, what they\ndoing to us. I wasn\u2019t aware what they did anywhere else. I was too young perhaps, I\ndon\u2019t know. Maybe my w -- my more -- brothers might have known, I personally\ndidn\u2019t, until later on.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. We worked with the non-Jewish population in the factories, in the\nammunition factories with them. But fl -- right after that, they had nothing to do\nwith you. They were sort of like -- didn\u2019t go near you, didn\u2019t have nu -- even though\nthey -- before you -- w-we called each other, you know, so to speak, by the first\nname. And then as we were working with them, they didn\u2019t say hello and they\ndidn\u2019t say any -- a word to you, they just -- that you were -- not existed. And they\nknow that they could have helped, they could have brought a piece of bread, they\ncould have brought a -- a -- a raw potato or extra piece of bread for lunch. Throw it\non the floor, somebody -- we\u2019 ll find it, don\u2019t worry. The Germans won\u2019t see you\nDecember 20, 1999\nhanding it over to me personally, just throw it my way. I\u2019m working alongside you,\nPll pick it up. But we -- no such thing was done. So they were not that friendly to\nus.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, not from our ghetto. We kept sort of thi -- because what they\ndid, they put every -- m-most of them to work, because we had -- we even had a -- a\nstone quarry we had, people working down -- I remember my job too, at the\nbeginning I was working up there, cutting up the big rocks for small rocks,\nchopping them up, and they gave you a certain amount you had to do for the day.\nLike you buy a cord of wood here, that\u2019s how we would pile up the stones, and they\nmeasured to make sure that they -- this -- you did your day\u2019s work. But that was\neven before the factory, I was working there. And what else can we say about this,\nwhat -- we were working in the [indecipherable] but they kept us busy, we -- I\nmean, everybody was busy. If they -- 1f you didn\u2019t go to work 1n the factory, they\ncame in with the trucks, picked you up in the -- they\u2019Il pick you up in the -- in the\nghetto, load you up on a truck, take you away. Woman, man, don\u2019t make any\ndifference, you go out and clean their vehicles, clean their barracks where they live.\nThe women would have to wash their laundry for them. And I\u2019m sure we didn\u2019t get\npaid, we -- all we got is beating. But --\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "A: Well, not in the street, they came in -- into the ghetto within the compound and\nthey would just grab people [indecipherable] men and women and sometimes\nsome of them wouldn\u2019t show back up. So what they did with them, they either\nkilled them somewhere or they shipped them away somewhere, we don\u2019t know, I\ndon\u2019t really know, but quite a few they did that. But as I say, for me to remember, I\ndon\u2019t remember who they were, I know they were friends.",
        "A: The ghetto I was from, I believe about til -- from 1939 -- I know I was there til\nOctober the 27 -- I do remember one -- vividly one day, October the 27\", 1942. We\nwere -- up til then we were in the ghetto and October then came and they came out\non the loudspeakers early in the morning, they banged on our doors with the rifles,\nscared to death, early in the morning, raus, raus, everybody out. Where we going?\nTo the marketplace. Everyone had to leave the area of the ghetto into the\nmarketplace. And we had to wait for the people to come over at night for the night\nshift, I wa -- I had the night shift from 11 to seven in the morning. When I came\nDecember 20, 1999\nfrom the factory they did not take us back to the ghetto, we went right to the\nmarketplace. In the marketplace we all had to stand around it until -- from five a.m.,\nI would say about til three in the afternoon, until -- til the selection started. They --\nthey started picking the -- before that even, people were coming towards the -- from\nthe ghetto towards the marketplace to walk. It was a little distance, I don\u2019t know\nexactly the amount of the distance, but on the way there they were -- the Germans\nwere screaming loud, schnell, fast, fast. And children would get separated from\ntheir mothers, and you could hear the children screaming Mom, they were\nscreaming for their mothers, the children -- and the mothers would scream for the\nbabies, they got lost for a second or so. It caused a lot of turmoil to -- to -- to get all\nthese people lined up in the marketplace. And they finally did line them up with the\nselection and that guy -- we stayed, and he would say left, right, left, right. And of\ncourse, th-the old -- the old ones, the old people and the real young, they would take\nthem right over to one section. They didn\u2019t go right, left, they just take them over,\nyou -- looked at you, you were old, over to the section. If you had children, over to\nthe section. I had one of my sisters with two children. She held onto them, both\ngirls. That was the -- my sister\u2019s named Reisl. She held onto the two children with\nmy mother, they held on, stayed together. My other sister worked at night with me,\nFaige. We came in the morning, so the child was with my grandmother -- with the\nDecember 20, 1999\nchild\u2019s grandmother, which was my mother. And when the child saw her mother,\nshe was screaming for her, she wanted her mother, but her mother -- she started\nrunning over to the mother and the German would start hitting her, kicking\n[indecipherable] back to the grandmother. He would not let her go over to the\nsister -- to -- to -- to my sister, which was the child\u2019s mother. And the ch-child was\ncrying. She finally quit crying and my -- my mother, which was the child\u2019s\ngrandmother, held onto her. Until this was lined up and I would say at -- by five\no\u2019clock it was -- everything was straightened out. They took the old people and the\nreal young and marched them towards the railroad yard. And the people that they\npicked, the younger ones, they looked like the ones that had already jobs and the\nones that didn\u2019t have jobs, but they looked young, strong, were moving over to one\narea. And after the old ones marched away from us, then they started on us. They\nstart lining us up again, checking us over again. And on the way when the people\nleft towards the railroad yard we could hear screams going on, we could hear the\nrifle shootings were going, maybe they shot in the air, I don\u2019t know, but there was a\nlot of commotion going on until these people were settled towards the railroad yard.\nAnd ones then they -- we heard they packed them in and we heard the train, the\nnoise of the locomotive and we knew they were heading away. We didn't know\nwhere they were going, we never did know where. They went to us, they lined us up\nDecember 20, 1999\nagain and they told us five in a row, and line up, and the Germans were standing\nthere, and -- with the guards and the Ukrainians. They even had the Lithuanians\nwith them, too, who joined the Nazi regime. Those were also no good. Very, very\nbad. And they lined us up and they told us to march, start marching. And we\nmarched. And you had little satchels with you, they told you to take whatever you\nwant with you, so you gra -- how much did I have? I had a little satchel with me, I\ndon\u2019t even know what was in it. Mother packed it for me, she said you take this\nwith you. So wis -- when we were heading towards the destination where they told\nus to go to march -- and on the way they kept beating us too, we didn\u2019t walk too\nfast, then they told us to jog. And it was all uphill. And the place we were heading\nfor was six and a half kilometers from the market. It was hot to -- October, very hot.\nUsually it\u2019s cool already, but that was a very hot October. We didn\u2019t have anything\nto drink from five a.m. in the morning [indecipherable] to drink, no water, nothing.\nAnd on the way they kept beating us and -- and some people were falling down on\nthe ground. Then they beat them up and they made us lift them up again and walk\nwith them, he-helping them along. We finally did come to the destination and we\nlooked and there was a camp for us. And we were not aware of it in this outskirts of\nthe town that they built -- in fact, there was two camps. They took one bunch over\nto one sa -- area, to one camp, and one to another, was two camps in that city. And\nDecember 20, 1999\nthat was the Arbeitslager, the -- what they call a slave labor camp. They -- they\ndidn\u2019t have any electric wires around us, they had regular barbed wire. But they had\nthe guards on the towers and they had guards below. And barracks. And that was a\nsurprise for us, I suppo -- we didn\u2019t even know what was going on there. They built\nit secretly. We knew nothing of [indecipherable] of it until we go -- finally got\nthere to the gate and the loudspeaker again out, and he says everybody achtung,\nachtung whatever their name is and whatever they said, and they said empty your\npockets, all that -- what you bring with you, dump into a little box, there\u2019s a box\nsitting there on the side, and the satchels went into the box. There was another box,\nthey said, take all your jewelry, all money, dump it into this other box. And you\u2019d\nbetter aboi -- abide by it because you will get killed. So we all listened, of course\nyou had to do it, otherwise you don\u2019t want to get killed over there, so you search\nyourself, make sure you don\u2019t have a nickel left. Empty your pocket, you empty it,\neverything, with the jewelry and threw it in. They pile it [indecipherable] behind\nthe gate of the camp, and assigned us to different barracks. We came into the\nbarracks and all they had was empty bunks. Was nothing over there, just wood.\nThey put us three to a bunk. It was, I think, three or four bunks high. And --and they\nhad nothing, no water, not a thing for us, just shoved us into those barracks. And we\ndidn\u2019t get out from those barracks until five a.m. in the morning the following\nDecember 20, 1999\nmorning. The -- the -- the loudspeaker again, aus, everybody aus, aus, aus, aus.\nAnd then they would give us the [indecipherable]. The ones who had jobs working\nin the ammunition factory, line up to one area. So we all knew where, you know, we\nwere already [indecipherable] so we stood in one area, then he filled in others with\nus, then they marched us towards the factory. As we came into the factory, we were\n-- they\u2019re like a -- a -- a herd of cows. We were walking in and they were stand with\nthe long whips and they\u2019re beating on us [indecipherable]. And the overseer with\nthe SS man was right there with him. With the dogs barking and screaming,\ngrabbing your legs if you didn\u2019t walk fast enough, or your clothes. And I remember\nthere was this shouting shout [indecipherable] we didn\u2019t walk fast enough to the\ngate. And that was a regular ritual with them, in the morning to go 1n we gota\nbeating and then when we left we got a beating. Either way we didn\u2019t walk fast\nenough [indecipherable] a good excuse, because we were all bunched up in one\narea, trying to get through the gate so that we can go about -- to march back to the\ncamp, and we\u2019d always get beatings over there. And then, you know, once we got\nup to the -- inside the factory compound, we all knew where our stations were. And\nthe new ones were assigned to the areas wherever they assigned them to. And we\nstayed there in that factory til almost -- I would say til 1943, or -- or the beginning\nof \u00b044, we stayed in that Arbeitslager. And there too, typhus broke out. Very bad\nDecember 20, 1999\ntyphus, I had it myself. And I lost a sister that way. One of my sisters, Chaja, they\ndrove in a truck one morning before I came back from work, the night shift. And\nseven o\u2019clock instead of letting us into the -- to the camp, they would let us in\nbetween the barbed wire, like six feet apart or something like that. And all of us had\nto stay in the barbed wire til the two truckloads came out of the camp. And these\nwere supposedly going all infected people with the typhus. And we no longer saw\nthem after that. That\u2019s -- I lost one sister right there. Of course, the others, in the\nbeginning when we had -- when the -- what do you call it, the -- when they took\neverybody, the old and the young away, in the beginning I lost a sister there, too, in\nanother town. But that\u2019s how I lost one of them. The other sister, my t -- the -- the\none that was two years older than I was, she came down with typhus. And they had,\nbelieve it or not, so to speak, a hospital. There was one room at that bunk, one bunk\nbed, on one side, one bunk bed on the other side. No blanket, no nothing to cover\nyourself with, just plain old wood. And I still til today don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t\nkill her and why they let her stay in that little hospital. She stayed there -- I would\ncheck on her every morning when I come in from work, whenever I got off I would\nalways go in to check on her, see how she is. And one morning I came in, she was\nno longer there. So I went up to the Jewish policeman which I knew, and I said --\nhis name was Muttle, Muttle Hilf. I said -- I ran into him and I said, Muttle, what\nDecember 20, 1999\nhappened to my sister? He said, she died during the night and we already buried her\nin the bottom of the stone quarry [indecipherable] a stone quarry, and we buried\nher there, but the two -- one that was two years older than I was. So I was only left\nwith one more sister in the camp, Faige. And I lost her too, as we going to come\ninto it. We stayed there in this camp, then we -- the -- the Russians advanced a little\nbit from the east coming in, and then we could hear the artillery pounding already\nand we knew something was going on. So my sister Faige and this Jewish\npoliceman got together, and there was another Jewish policeman who -- his name\nwas Moishe Herblum, he was sort of related to us, a distant cousin. She and him\ngot hooked up to work out some way that we going to try to escape from that place.\nAnd I came home from the shift -- that -- that shift I had from three to 11 that e -- in\nthe night. Came home 11, she looked me up, my sister and she says, we\u2019re going to\nescape tonight, don\u2019t tell anybody, no one. I said, okay. So she -- I said, when am I\ngoing to know when to run? She says, I'll come and get you. So she says, just be\nready, stay in front of the door in -- of the barrack and I'll come and get you. She\nand the policeman came along and got me. By that time other people knew it\nalready too, because I saw a lot of commotion, people were running. And somebody\ngot into the -- to the barbed wire and cut through the barbed wire. And as we were\nrunning, the ike -- the cue was if the lights are off, we run. So the lights were off. So\nDecember 20, 1999\nthe people what their mission was to cut the wires, they did the job. And a lot of\npeople was -- tried to fight through that little area to get out, and they got entangled\nto one another, and a lot of commotion. By that time the guard heard a lot of -- more\nnoise going on, so he took the lights and put the searchlight towards that area where\nhe heard the noise and he saw people were running out. He opened fire and I was\nrunning with my sister and the Jewish policeman together, and I got hit in the head,\nwounded, and I dropped. My sister, after I dropped I don\u2019t know what happened to\nher, o-or to the policeman. I know people were running back, the lights went on and\npeople were running in every direction, in, out, in and out. Somebody jumped on\nme with a [indecipherable] and put a scar on here, I was bleeding from here, I was\nbleeding from my head until I -- they were stampeding me. So I finally woke up and\ncame -- a few seconds, I came up to myself, I said -- I started screaming for my\nsister, Faige, Faige, and I didn't hear from her. So I said to myself, why don\u2019t I go\ninto he -- the women\u2019s barrack and look for her. So, I was a little bit disor-oriented,\nI didn\u2019t know which -- I lost a lot of blood, and I did manage to go into the\nwomen\u2019s barrack, which she shouldn\u2019t have gone in, but I took a chance, I went in\nthere. The -- the lady in charge of the barrack was one of our Jewish women from\nour city, so I knew her, sort of. So I figured she\u2019s not going to bother me too much.\nI went, Faige, Faige in th -- in the barracks, no Faige. So my -- my first cousin,\nDecember 20, 1999\nIda, she was my first cousin, she says, what are you sh -- she says, what are you\nlooking for? I was looking for Faige, have you seen Faige? She says no, she\u2019s not\nhere. And then she saw I was bleeding [indecipherable] from my head, so she\ngrabbed that shirt, dipped it in some water [indecipherable] I put it on my head,\ntried to stop the bleeding, and -- and I couldn\u2019t leave that women\u2019s barracks that\nnight, I had to stay overnight there, underneath th-the last bunk, I squeezed myself\nunderneath there. And she told me to hold this over my head, which I did. And then\n-- because all night long they were -- they were angry that we were trying to escape,\nso they were shooting all night long into the barrack with the -- with the rifles,\nboom, boom -- with the machine guns, boom, boom, boom, boom, all night long,\nuntil early in the morning it stopped, I snuck out of there and went into -- back to\nmy barrack. And three days later the rumor was sure, that we are going to be\nshipped out. My sister didn\u2019t tell me that, but that\u2019s the reason they wanted to\nescape, because we going to be shipped out. And one to the other was talking, they\nsaid here we helping, actually, the Germans. Everybody has a job, we work in the\nammunition factory, and all kind of copper foundries, each one had a job. We were\nactually helping the Germans, and if they ship us out of here, where can they take\nus? To probably [indecipherable] extermination camp. We didn't know. So my\nsister was trying to escape with me and the policeman. Now, the rumor later was\nDecember 20, 1999\naround, saying that the underground was supposed to have met us there. There was -\n- the way they worked it out, they wouldn\u2019t tell me anything about it, they didn\u2019t\nwant me to know, in case I get caught or something, so I don\u2019t have nothing to tell\nthem. It was all arra -- arranged with the partisans, who were supposed to meet that\n-- at 11 - 12 o\u2019clock in the night, and to eliminate the guard and knock the lights\nout. And it so happened there was an air raid, so the lights went off anyway, and\nthere was -- got a little bit mixed up. It so happened that the -- the partisans never\nshowed. Maybe they got some problems, they never showed. So we proceeded with\nour stuff that we said we going to do, we did. So, a lo -- some of them did escape, I\ndon\u2019t know how many, so the next morning roll call they wanted to see how many\nescaped, so they chased everybody out from the barracks and they would start to\ncount the names and the -- and they marched us over to the place where -- where we\nwere trying to escape, we cut through the wires. And right in the front of us there\nwas the policeman, wounded. My sister was there, but she was dead. But there was\nabout, I would say 10 - 15 people laying there, moaning and moaning and groaning,\nblood -- lot of blood flowing around and -- and they made us look and they took the\nmachine gun and killed every one of them. And they said this is the lesson that you\nwill learn. If you escape, that\u2019s what will happen to you. So from now on, stay put,\nDecember 20, 1999\ndon\u2019t -- don\u2019t escape any more. And this is the lesson that we learned right there.\nAnd sure enough, within about four or five days later we were shipped out of there.",
        "A: The head -- the chest wound they couldn\u2019t see cause I wore the jacket on top,\nyou know, th -- they couldn\u2019t see that. But my head wound they could have seen,\nbut we were -- we had ba -- you could wear anything you want on your head, a\nberet, or a hat. Then wa -- in that camp, it wasn\u2019t where you had a striped uniform\nyet. We didn't get that til later, we were wearing our ra -- normal clothes, a pair of\npants and a shirt, whatever you had, you wore. So I had a beret and I covered it up,\nand they didn\u2019t see it at all. And of course I washed everything away from the\n[indecipherable]. And they didn\u2019t check me over at all until I got to the destination\nwhere -- I\u2019m going to tell you where I came to, and then they asked questions.",
        "A: The wounds did not heal until I was liberated in 19 fort -- April 25\", 1945, I\n[indecipherable] 1945 of April the army medics, U.S. medics treated it for me. It\nwould get infected and re-infected, infected and re-infected for so long a time. Only\ntime it felt good, when you took a shower, finally they let you get -- washed it, so\nthe scab washed off and then the new scab came on the -- of course, you know with\nDecember 20, 1999\nthe sanitary conditions being so bad, that infected again, so that\u2019s what I said, didn\u2019t\nheal up til I was heal -- til the vet -- the army medics helped me after the war, after I\nwas liberated.",
        "A: I would get a lot of headaches from that. Until today I still feel headaches, I\nthink it\u2019s maybe contribute to that, I\u2019m not sure. Whether I got fever, I don\u2019t know.\nI did get typhus, I had fever. So I\u2019m aware of what -- what fever is, but you know,\nyou had so many other problems, this was just a little minor thing in your life, other\nthan the wound, you know.",
        "A: I would say about three inches long. Right in the back here, in my head. By just\na little bit, maybe an eighth of a 16\" of an inch deeper I wouldn\u2019t have been here\ntalking to you -- this interview here.",
        "A: A flesh wound, but it opened up almost to the scalp, almost to the bone it\nseparated. Was pretty deep.",
        "A: Yeah.\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "A: Yes, there were some other people in that camp, ou-out of towners too, yes,\nbecause they kept brining in extra people every -- every week, every day they\nbrought a few extra ones in. And some of them looked pretty strong when they\ncame in already to our camp towards the end, we were already weaklings. We\u2019re\nnot skeletons yet, but we were [indecipherable] weak. They were still strong, they\ncame from some other part maybe, where they were not mistreated yet. And so they\n-- when they came into our camp, then they learned a lesson right there, they gave it\nto them the same treatment we had. And people were losing weight. But it wasn\u2019t\njust -- Just as bad, you could still survive, yeah.",
        "A: No. They were just threatening us, saying if we would think about again\nescaping, this w-would happen to us. But before that -- before that, the order was,\none had to watch the other, because sometimes we did have escapes. And they\nwould take just five out, innocent people, and kill them because this one person\nwould escape. They did that in the beginning when we went into the camp to be told\n-- they were telling that over the loudspeaker, every day we heard that. But during\nthat time they just killed -- they -- they just killed the wounded that were trying --\nDecember 20, 1999\nthat were on the other side of the fence, which escaped, they were already on the\nother side.",
        "A: Not really, no, because we couldn\u2019t talk to the people who were on the outside,\nthe non-Jews, they wouldn\u2019t tell us nothing. Not me, let\u2019s put it this way, I can\u2019t\nspeak for the whole town, maybe somebody did know. I did not know what went\non. But towards the -- later on we heard stories that -- not until I got to Auschwitz I\nheard that -- the rumors what went on.",
        "A: Well, before we left this camp is -- the only thing I can remember, how they\nwere doing, they -- they came out -- we had like sobriety tests like we have here for\nsomebody who drinks and drives. The policeman stops you and they make you walk\nto a straight line. And they -- there was one German there, his name was AI -- Alto,\nthat\u2019s the only name I remember, how it\u2019s possible that you could only remember\none miserable man, because he was very bad, he was bad. And he was a heavyset\nman, and I remember he\u2019d come in and everybody who was in the shift -- the worst\nshift by the way, was night shift, because that means you were in the camp all day\nlong. And all the trouble started during the day. If they needed extra help they\nDecember 20, 1999\nwould come in and drag you out of bed, and go do extra work, plus he makes sure\nhe brings you back so you can go on the regular shift. We might put that day on 16\nhours or 17 hours. And that was the worst shift. But he would come in during the\nday and have everybody outside and he would -- like target practice, he would have\nyou walk a straight line. If he knew you were sick in bed -- so-sometime you would\nsee people laying on the bed with foaming from their mouth from the high fever\nfrom the typhus. I had the typhus too. So-Some -- sometime maybe\n[indecipherable] or heavy, I don\u2019t know what it is. My sister, the one who died, she\nhad typhus, but for her, hers turned into the tu -- tuberculosis I think it turned into,\nshe never recovered, she died. They let her die on her own. That was in the a -- in\nthe camp yet. And what -- he would bring them 1n and he made you walk a straight\nline. If you did -- if you wiggled a certain way, he would put a bullet in the back of\nyour head. And this was like ta-target practice for him. And he had other\naccomplices come with him, to show them what he is doing. Trying to show them\nthat gee, he could do that too. To harden them up, I guess, like weren't hard enough.\nAnd I remember one of my neighbors, his name was Luther, I don\u2019t know his last\nname, he was my -- my age, and he had a bad case, cause he was foam -- I\nremember seeing him in the morning, he was foaming from the mouth. And he\nwould tell us to go out, so we had to leave, you could not stay inside or he would\nDecember 20, 1999\nkill you in your -- in your bunk if you stayed. And he -- that\u2019s how he died, because\nhe was wiggling when he was walking, his fever was so high that he could not walk\nstraight line. So therefore he shot him in the back of the head. This is the only one\nthat I saw him shooting, by the way, but he would do that every so often, every so\noften. I remember this young man when he was my friend, he was my neighbor\nbefore, we were living near each other. We were the tailors and they were the\ncarpenters. Yeah, we knew each other pretty good.",
        "A: No, they would only bring people in, not -- not out, just bringing them in, they\nwere bringing extra people in from other towns, but who -- I never see anybody\nleaving there until they deported everybody out of the camp.",
        "A: The liquidation of the camp, like I say, after we tried to escape and three days\nlater the rumor was true. My sister didn't want to tell me, but then we found one\nanother to see how they -- the people were trying to work this out with the -- with\nthe partisans somehow. And they pulled up the train and the camp was maybe a\nblock away from the -- from the railroad. We could see the railroad yard from far\naway. You know, it wasn\u2019t that far, 1t wa -- maybe it was longer than a block, but\nwe could see the cattle cars. And one day they told us to line up in the morning, and\nDecember 20, 1999\n-- and march towards the railway yard. Well again the beatings [indecipherable] on\nthe way it was the same thing, that we would walk past the -- it was constantly\nbeating, beating with the long whips, just like -- just like the cowboys here with the\nherd of cows trying to round them up, it\u2019s constantly beating, beating, beating.\nWhen we finally came towards the railroad yard they started to line up people. See,\nyou go -- to what wagon to go into, push them in. And we were packed in, 125 to\n150, I would say, approximately to 1 -- to each car. They would set us down\nbetween each other\u2019s legs so that we could fit more in. And then once was full, he s\n-- closed the door up and sealed it up so no one can open it up. And they finally,\nafter leaving and we got through, we finally pulled away, we could hear the\nlocomotives, the noise of locomotives and we were heading out, we were three days\non the road. No water. We stopped at every station. We didn\u2019t know where we were\ngoing, but we stopped in so many stations, I know, because this was not a priority\ntrain, the army has to go through first, so there was -- they let everybody else go,\nbut we stopped in so many stations, and in unison, I remember we were screaming,\nwasser, wasser, wasser, and the Germans know what wasser means, because in\ntheir -- German language | think it\u2019s the same. We didn\u2019t ask them to feed us, all we\nasked, water, water. No water was given, nothing at the station. We finally did\narrive -- we finally did arrive at the destination in three days fa -- after three days\nDecember 20, 1999\nyou finally arrived in this camp, it was very scary for me personally, with -- to see\nall these electric wires with the -- with the current would kill us, with seven foot\ntall, they had to be at least, or 10 foot tall. It was a different ballgame there. And as\nwe were looking through the barbed wire, we saw people walking around with\nskeletons, with thin and striped cap and a striped uniform an-and wooden shoes, we\nalready saw that. But the people who came to meet us in the front of the car, they\npushed those little carts. And they came and told us in Yiddish that this is [speaks\nYiddish here] we were burning, we were burning the Jews here. This 1s not a work\ncamp, this 1s strictly a killing camp. And that\u2019s when we first got to know about this\nfrom the -- from the people from within the camp, when they met us in front of the\nrailroad yard. Then they opened up the -- the car, each car -- each car separately,\nand they were saying, raus, raus. Again the same thing started with selection.\nRight, left, right, left. Even -- even we were all, so to speak, the cream of the crop.\nWe were working. We -- we were healthy, so to speak. Still they wanted, still line\nup again people, and they put them off to one end, and we went to the other end.\nThey took the -- the one end away, we don\u2019t know what happened to them, til we\nfound out later on that they took them for gas and killing and then -- and\n[indecipherable] right away. With us they took us over [indecipherable] a little bit\nyounger, they took us over and we marched towards the inside, I remember. And\nDecember 20, 1999\nwe came up to a big table, and there were SS men sitting at the table, there must be\nabout 10 of them, and they had some kind of instruments 1n their hands. And that\u2019s\nwhere they were tattooing us. So we rolled up our sleeve and they gave us our\nnumbers on the arms.",
        "A: My number is A18991. A18991. And they tattooed everybody. Next from the\ntattoo -- and mind you, we still didn\u2019t get any water. We still -- it\u2019s already\n[indecipherable] three days now, no water at all, nothing. We were tattooed, then\nthey checked us over, they told us to go into [indecipherable] the barbers were\nstanding, and women and men, their hair was cut off. Before, in our camp, where\nwe came from, the -- the Jewish population in that camp, the women wore the hair.\nThey cut their own a little bit shorter, but when we came to Auschwitz, they\nchopped all the hair off, they took off that the girls looked like boys already,\neverybody looked the same. And that\u2019s when they noticed, the barber, I don\u2019t know\nwhether he was a German, or whether he was one of the -- from the camp workers\n[indecipherable] but he asked me about my wound. The first time. He asked me\nabout my wound so I told him I had a fight inside the car. We were pushing each\nother trying to get to the -- which was true, we were trying to get to that little\nwindow to get a breath of air. And there was fighting, really fighting going on in\nDecember 20, 1999\nthat car with us. And then -- so I told him I got hurt that way. He took -- he didn\u2019t\nquestion me after that. Shaved if off. It felt better after he cut away all the hair, but\nagain it still was infected. And after the haircut they told us we had to go get a\nshower. So they lined us up again and like in a maze where you couldn\u2019t get out any\nmore. You got in, you couldn\u2019t get out. And we went in, they gave us -- they told us\nto leave our clothes on the inside and when we came out on the other end of the\nshower, we had our striped uniforms ready with our wooden shoes and we got\ndressed, went back into the barrack and we stayed there in the barrack. Finally\nsomebody brought in some buckets of water to get -- to get drink. And you could\nhave dranked up a whole bucket yourself as thirsty we were. And we -- they\ndelivered the water and then during the night -- during the night was a terrible noise\ngoing on next door to our barrack. Very noisy.\nDecember 20, 1999\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: The camp -- my camp was called just an Arbeitslager camp. And the factory\nthat I worked in was called Hermann Goering factory. But the destination that we\nevacuated our camp, we came to a camp and it was called Auschwitz. And I do\nremember Auschwitz had this famous sign, Arbeit Macht Frei, work makes you\nfree, I guess that\u2019s what the translation is. But that was Auschwitz that we came to\nbefore we got -- after -- after the train stopped and we were unloading, and the\nGermans were screaming aus, aus, aus, everybody. So you know, you have to jump\nout of the carload real quick. My -- my legs were entangled with people that I\nthought they were sleeping all night, I thought, because we started on the floor, and\nwhen we came to the destination I could touch the roof of that car. So I was laying\non top of other people, and I thought they were sleeping. But then I found out after I\ngot out, got myself free and I jumped out and I saw all these people -- I don\u2019t know\nthe exact amount, but quite a few were dead, never left the car, because they were\nsuffocated, from not giving us any water, or enough air. And people were fighting\nDecember 20, 1999\nwith one another trying to get a little bit of air. So there was quite a few dead on that\n-- on that train.",
        "A: Birkenau, Auschwitz, it was in about the same area where you came to.\nEverybody says Auschwitz, but I believe where you really drive up to is almost, it\u2019s\ncalled Birkenau, I think, but --",
        "A: I believe ours was wood, wooden barracks, I think.",
        "A: Okay. After we -- during the night when we spend -- in the first night in our\nbarrack, we heard a lot of noise going on next door barrack. I mean, not just noise,\nbut screams, screams, people were like with s-somebody be cutting somebody or\nhurting somebody. And this went on almost, I would say half of the night, until the\nnext day we found out from other sources, from people around there, from -- that\nhad been in this Auschwitz camp longer than we were told us that that night was\nthe Gypsy night and they were killing all the Gypsies that night. And that\u2019s where\nthe noise came from that we found out the next day.\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "A: The first day really not -- well, we didn\u2019t do too much over there, just hung\naround in the barrack and just talking to one another. And we did walk out a little\nbit, we had to wait for our food, they give us this little piece of bread in the\nmorning. A little piece of bread th-th-the thickness of two slices of toast, I would\nsay. Black bread and some ersatz coffee, which was imitation black coffee, we had\nthat in the morning, early. And after that, eating for three days and drinking, this\nwas like nothing compared to what we did where we were before. But a little bit\nmore to eat, we had extra soup over there because we -- when we went to the\nfactory, in the Arbeitslager. But here so far we didn\u2019t get just -- just this bread in\nthe morning and the watery soup in the evening. And then we were hanging around\nevery day the same, talking to one another and we could smell the stench in the -- in\nthe -- in the camp. Of course by that time I already knew what it was. Th-The\npeople that worked there told me, I was aware already what this is -- was. And now\nand then we would also help picking up bodies in there. They would grab you, say\ncome on, go to work, they -- and they would give us one of these carts, we\u2019d go\nahead and pull somebody just naturally dying in the -- on the street. We would take\nthem and put them -- put them on a pile next to the crematorium over there, we\u2019d\nput them 1n a pile like -- like y -- like you pile up wood, they were laying there. And\nwe didn\u2019t do too much other things than that, just a -- until one day. I was there, I\nDecember 20, 1999\nthink about -- I would say at least six months, until this German well-dressed man\ncame in, into the camp. And we -- we were sort of -- we picked out the youngest of\nthe groups and we lined up and he went and gave us a selection, he looked us over.\nAnd he would point to go over towards him. So I was the one that he picked. Went\nover to him, I wasn\u2019t aware of what he picks me for, I was not sure. But then they\ntook us on a truck after that and they took us to another camp called Buna, B-u-n-a,\nBuna-Monowice | think it\u2019s called. They took us to that camp and we got to get\nthis man to -- he was giving us jobs. I don\u2019t know how many he got out of there,\nmaybe it was 50 - 100 people, I don\u2019t know the exact amount. But he took a pretty\ngood group, I\u2019d say two truckloads and we went over to Buna. And from --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Nobody. No-Nobody own -- nobody even noticed it because when they gave us,\nit was a striped little cap that I wore. So that covered it up, too. The only time they\nwould see it maybe -- I don\u2019t think they ever noticed it on me, but if I did I was\nDecember 20, 1999\nprepared to tell them that I got hurt on the -- on the wagon, on the train, on the cattle\ncar.",
        "A: Well, I could see -- I-I was roaming around in the -- in the camp, I was seeing\nwhat people looked like, they -- they were already skeletons in that camp. We were\nnot yet skeletons, we had a little bit more food where we came from. And there, the\npeople over there, they would just look like skeletons, it scares you. Some of them\nwere laying on the ground, they couldn\u2019t walk, they couldn\u2019t talk any more, sort of.\nAnd it\u2019s the only thing that I saw, there was not too much to observe except the\nsmokestack. You could see the smokestack coming -- the -- the -- the smoke out of\nthe chimneys. We could see plenty of that, but the stench by that time I was already\naware of what it is.",
        "A: There was nothing to see, it was just a empty area. I don\u2019t n -- I couldn\u2019t see\nmuch out there. I could see empty areas where I was facing. Maybe some woods far\naway, that\u2019s about the only thing I could see.\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "A: Well, Buna was a little bit cleaner than Auschwitz because Buna was already\nlike a working camp. At least we didn\u2019t have any crematoriums in there. They did\nhave punishment by hanging in that camp, but not crematorium, no burning people\nin that -- Buna-Monowice. And this man picked us up and the job that I was\nassigned to was to I.G. Farben company. And so anyway, so we did get -- we were\nstill able to get a little bit extra soup over there in the -- in the Monowice in the\nfactory. So we would get -- actually you would get a piece of bread in the morning\nin -- in Buna with the black imitation coffee. Then around one, two o\u2019clock in the\nafternoon they give you a little water soup, a little bit extra. And then when we\ncame home, to home, when we came home back to the camp, we got another watery\nsoup. You had a spoon with you, but believe me you didn\u2019t need a spoon, there was\nnothing there to eat with a spoon. There was cabbage, you couldn\u2019t find a piece of\ncabbage. Or turnips, you couldn\u2019t find a piece of turnip. It was just watery soup,\nyou could drink it. So that made us a little better in that camp, I think, it looked a\nlittle bit cleaner too in th -- in that Buna camp. Like I say, every morning we would\nget up, and -- get up in the morning, get to -- get this little piece of bread and on the\nway you would -- sometimes they would transport us by truck. If it was foggy --\nthey used to be very foggy sometimes there that you couldn\u2019t see but maybe 10 - 15\nfeet away in front of you. So they would put us in trucks to take us to the factory\nDecember 20, 1999\nback. But of course -- and in the factory the same thing what happened there. We\ndidn\u2019t get as much beating, but you still had guards with you, so you had to watch\nyour [indecipherable] you couldn\u2019t talk to one another. If we did, we -- he\u2019d -- in\nthe evening -- they wouldn\u2019t bother you while you were talking, but before you left\nto go back to the camp, they would call you into a certain area, you know, like an\noffice where they were and they would ask you, why were you talking so much to\nthis man? What were you talking about? What we talking about, we hungry, we\ntalking about food. We talk about -- we not have -- and we talk about the families\nwe lost, that kind of talk, that\u2019s all the talking that we did. And one day he didn\u2019t\ntake -- he didn\u2019t take that and he gave us -- there were chairs that you put your head\nthrough, your knees on the ground, your stomach on the seat of the chair, and they\ntake your -- take your shirt off and they would give you a whipping with a whip.\nAnd when you get through, your back looked like a city map, a road map, with the\nbeating that we used to get. So you were actually -- you were not a -- you shouldn\u2019t\nhave been able to talk to nobody. Just do your work and don\u2019t say nothing to one\nanother.\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "A: Yes, we did. We -- we did. We s -- we -- we were -- the guys we kept together\ntrying to help one another, we did. Specially by when we were marching later on.\nBut then the -- why we -- when we came, we sort of kept with one another too. I\nhad this one young man, he was my bunkmate. That happened in Buna. And in\nBuna we used to get air raids. And the air raids would come also to the -- to the\nI.G. Farben company, too. And while we were in I.G. Farben company, the\nGermans had a German kitchen there for themselves, or maybe for the non-Jews,\ntoo, I don\u2019t know. But all I know 1s whenever the air raid came and that young man\nwould find out where the kitchen was, he was running to the kitchen to see what\nthey threw out. And he would sometime come back with food, like so -- sour soup,\nold -- old -- that they throw out in the trash. And I used to tell him, I told him, I\nsaid, don\u2019t go, you\u2019re going to get hurt, don\u2019t do that. No, he said, I\u2019m hungry. I\nsaid, I\u2019m hungry too, but I\u2019m not going to do this. And he went, and he finally did\nget caught. When it\u2019s -- his punishments was hanging. And he didn't listen to me\nwhen I tried to -- to warn him. He was my bunkmate, we were three of us in a bunk.\nHe was my age. I don\u2019t remember his name it\u2019s been so many years. And we had to\ngo out there and watch three -- three guys -- three and him, four guys were hung in\nthe -- in that -- Buna. The German got up and he read a protocol. I don\u2019t know what\nit was, what he was reading, I didn\u2019t understand a word he said. And then after he\nDecember 20, 1999\ngave the -- the order, and one of us -- not me, but the people of [indecipherable]\nand they had ropes around their neck, and he was one of them, I don\u2019t know what\nthe other ones were punished for, but I know he was punished strictly for just\ngetting just a little bit sour soup out of a trashcan that they -- that the German\nkitchen threw outside. That was his punishment, that\u2019s only no -- that\u2019s the only\nthing I know about it. And after that, after they were hung, the people who were the\n-- they had a regular band, instead of you know, we all were sobbering and sorry to\nsee this little boy, especially me, I felt very bad, my friend. And they started playing\nwith the cymbals and the drums and the things like you go to a -- to a high school\nfootball team, what th -- a hi -- a game, when they play after it\u2019s finished. And this\nis what the Germans, they -- they think of the -- or -- or -- or the -- the Nazis,\nwhatever they were, think of -- of a Jew. Or of anybody, to kill anybody. Inhumane,\ninhumane, it\u2019s the only thing I can describe it, that\u2019s what they are. Inhumane.",
        "A: Oh yes, I got beaten when I was just telling you previously, when he asked us\nwhy we were talking. And we went to his office and he didn\u2019t go for it when I told\nhim we were talking about food and we were talking about family, he didn't -- he\ndidn't believe us, so he gave both of us a beating with, like I say, you get on your\nknees, rest your stomach on the chair, the head went through the back of the -- of\nDecember 20, 1999\nthe chair, and you t -- without your shirt, and he was whipping you with a whip.\nAnd more you -- more you screamed, more beating you got, so you had to calm\ndown and don\u2019t scream, try not to scream so maybe he won\u2019t give you bad beating.\nBut I remember my -- for two, three weeks my back looked like a -- like a road map\nfrom the beating.",
        "A: That\u2019s the only time I got that kind of beating, yes. I used to get plenty of\nbeatings with the rifle butts, that I got plenty.

But I know that the -- the war started already, the allies got into the war, I\nthink, at the time.

        "A: Well, th -- Buna was a little, like I say, we didn\u2019t have any crematoriums there,\nthat\u2019s the only good reason, although it probably is not that far away from\nAuschwitz anyway, it was a subsidiary of Auschwitz anyway, and -- and\nBirkenau, it all in one line, I think, all those three. But there 1s -- it was a little bit\ncleaner. I remember I was looking out, I used to look out in Buna and see a sign, it\nwas 37 miles or 38 miles to -- to Krak\u00e9w and I would always say, if I get out of\nhere, that\u2019s where I\u2019m going to go, to Krakow, big city, which I never made it out\nof there, never made it, never materialized. We were shipped out of Buna when the\nallies, I think, started coming in, they started bomb -- bombing the I.G.

But they were dressed well, their shoes -- they shined -- their\nshoes were shined, they looked well cleaned, well fed and they were working in the\nstreets picking up dirt, too, like -- and we were working in the -- I was -- myself, I\nwas building the roads 1n -- in the -- in birk -- in I.G.

And then I left from there and they put us on the marches again.\nFirst they put us on trains from there, and then the allies were bombing the trains,\nand there was like a cat and mouse. They were bombing the rail and then they\nrepaired the rail, they started again, and again they bombed it. So they gave up,\nwanted to start marching us. And we were marching, marching and I came to a\nplace called Flossenbirg after that.",

        "A: In Flossenburg we stayed there, like again, not too long, I -- not quite a year, I\ndon\u2019t think, we stayed there. And there -- my job over there was to sort clothes and\nthere was a pile of clothes, I mean two stories tall. And we were out there s --\nsorting clothes. Matching up shoes, tie them together, men\u2019s clothes from ladies\u2019\nDecember 20, 1999\nclothes separating. Gloves, eyeglasses, all separated in that camp. They had -- other\npeople had other jobs over there, they used to work, I think in a -- in a airplane\nfactory, I think Messerschmitt was there, now that I know where it is, I was told\nthat there is -- a factory was right there. But my job was not that, my job was just to\nsort clothes over there. And there our men -- we didn\u2019t do too much, we didn\u2019t,\nexcept for sorting the clothes. And of course we -- by that time we already\nskeletons, starting to lose a lot of weight by then. And I remember one day in\nFlossenburg the Red Cross came to visit us, and we had to clean up that camp that\nyou could not find um -- it was always clean anyway, there was no food to throw\naway, and [indecipherable] paper, nothing, cleaned up clean. And that time they\ngave us, instead of that water soup, they gave us -- I -- the only way I can describe it\nwould be like Cream of Wheat, thick Cream of Wheat. And we said wow, all of a\nsudden we\u2019re getting that, maybe because of the visitors. We never talked to them,\nwe saw them talking to the Germans, and they would come around and pointing\nbarracks out. They even had us go out there and play soccer in front of them. We\ncould hardly walk, but we played soccer. You know, we still young, like young\nkids, you don\u2019t care, you still want to kick a ball, you know, you were so young yet.\nAnd I remember them playing and then, couldn\u2019t they see our faces? They could see\nhow we look. The Red Cross couldn\u2019t be that dumb, that naive that they can\u2019t see\nDecember 20, 1999\nthat we get this kind of food every day, that -- the way we looked? They could have\nseen that. Then after they left, back in to the water soup.",
        "A: No. No, I did not know. For one re -- think I didn\u2019t know is because my -- one of\nmy brothers joined the Polish army, Zachary. He was -- they drafted in the Polish\narmy, so I never knew where he was. Then I had my oldest of the brothers. He\nescaped before the Germans came into my town. And by that time we were on a\nfarm because we were still living in the home. So when the bombing started my\nmother -- my father was already dead, my mother knew this guy at the farm\n[indecipherable] used to do work for. He came with the horse and buggy and\npicked us up and took us into his farm until the bombing stopped. And luckily we\ndid because there was a lot of shrapnels in our house that flew in with -- from the\nbombs. I mean, big chunks. So we were sort of lucky that we didn\u2019t stay there. But\nwhile we were on the farms, we were outside, I remember til today, I was eating\ntomatoes that were like, I mean, real tomatoes, big. Take off the vines and eating\nthem in the farm. And my brother was out there and he saw the soldiers coming\nthrough with torn up -- these Polish soldiers coming with torn uniforms, and ripped\nDecember 20, 1999\n[indecipherable]. So he was t -- asking them in Polish, where are the Germans,\nwhere? He says, they\u2019re not far from here, you know, maybe a few kilometers from\nhere. So he took off, my brother, walking with that soldier somewhere. I ma -- later\nhe said he separated from him, but my brother walked, he says 1100 miles, I don\u2019t\nknow, that\u2019s what he tells me and he went to Vilna. From Poland to Vilna he\nescaped into the woods, and I was trying to chase with him, but he chased me back,\ngo back to your mother, he was -- I -- til today, I -- I don\u2019t forgive him that.

By that time we sort of\nweak, we lost our weight already, we started losing weight. And marching in the\nwoods. Sometime we come through a town, and why the German population tell me\nthat they -- after liberation they told me that they were not aware of all this, is\nbeyond me because we used to walk through this, sometimes a little town and we\nwould have the Hitlerjugend out there with rocks. They\u2019re throwing the rocks at us\nand spitting at us and calling us all kind of names. So I am sure that they were\naware of it, maybe they didn\u2019t want to tell us that. But then we marched\n[indecipherable] food got scarce some -- again at -- when we were marching\nbecause they didn\u2019t have the supplies. Like you have an army, you have the -- the\nsupplies come with them, we didn\u2019t have that. We had to -- we had to wait until we\ncame to a farm. And if the farmer was nice -- nice enough to give us some raw\npotatoes, then tha-that\u2019s all you can get. You will not -- you will not get bread.\nYou'll get a raw potato, you'll get a turnip or something like that. Which helped. If\nhe was nice, but sometimes we went through farms they wouldn't give us anything,\njust stayed over overnight and continued.\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "A: Well, the ones they couldn\u2019t go on, we -- we all know what happened. They fell\nand they -- they -- they shot them. They shot them right on the spot. And then they\nmust have had some other people marching in the front of us because sometimes we\nwere then -- would run across bodies that were laying in the ditches with the striped\nuniforms on. So we n -- we were already aware of what happened to them. And you\ncould see always their eyes open, the sku -- front skull was always out, because they\nhad these certain bullets, the -- the -- from the guns that they was using that if you\ngot hit in the back of the head, the whole front of the skull would go out. And we\nknew that that\u2019s -- the man didn\u2019t die th -- on his own, but he was shot. And we\nmarched and marched un-until we were liberated. It was somewhere in -- in\nBavaria where we were liberated. And one morning -- we stayed there overnight\nand we were in a circle. We\u2019re staying in the woods and wa -- I remember eating\nberries and the next morning you got up and I was looking for berries. They might\nhave been green from -- the blueberries yet, I knew what they looked like, I ca -- I\nremember that, but I was eating [indecipherable]. They had a little creek coming\nthrough here and I remember drinking water out of that creek. And then I heard low\nflying planes coming through, a lot of commotion. And then we\u2019re seeing trucks\ncome in. We weren\u2019t that deep into the woods where we could see the road. We\u2019d\nsee a lot of trucks, tanks, but we didn\u2019t know who they belonged to, whether they\nDecember 20, 1999\nwere Germans, or Russian, or American, we didn\u2019t know who they were. As we\nwere sitting around a circle, a big tank came along and knocked all the underbrush\nand some trees down to get to us. And we thought they were what -- they going to\nkill us here, probably. And then lo and behold this one jumped out, a boy jumped\nout, blonde hair, short [indecipherable] hardly have any hair, in Polish he says,\nhey, you are free. But before that, to back up here just a few seconds, before that we\nwere -- while we were sitting, after all this commotion we heard, we saw the -- th-\nthe guards disappearing. They left us sitting by ourselves and they just\n[indecipherable] they had at least four of them with the four dogs, they\ndisappeared. So we, a-as a -- as already experienced in trying to escape and got hurt,\nI told them, better stay put, because it might be a trick. So they listened and we all\nstayed there. By that time, after we didn\u2019t see them, and this tank came along, and\nthen we saw we were free by that time. Oh, was that -- that was a feeling that\u2019s just\nhard to describe, what that means. We were hugging that guy, kissing that guy, we\ndidn\u2019t know what to do with him. But then he jumped back up on the -- on the tank,\nI remember this time, to throw at us some rations. And I remember the -- the block\nof candy that they had. That was hardly [indecipherable] we were fighting like cats\nand dogs to get it. So he saw he\u2019s not going to win here. So he stopped. He says,\nfollow me behind the tank and we\u2019ll get you across to a -- to a farmer house. And\nDecember 20, 1999\nyour friends already there liberated, a lot of them. So when we went across the road\nwith him, walked behind the tank. We came in and then the guy had mixed up some\n-- [\u2019|l never forget the front of the door, next to the entrance, mixed up some big\ntrays of whatever -- whatever they used, with potato peelings and white powder\nmixed up, some kind of ca -- stuff. So it must have been for the animals, I suppose.\nAnd we didn\u2019t get it -- we didn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t wait to go into -- inside the door, we\ndidn\u2019t know what they going to give us there. So of course everybody was fighting\nover this, until the farmer came outside yelling at us, don\u2019t eat this, this is for the\npigs and the -- don\u2019t eat this. And he was take us away, and he told us to go inside\nthe house. Once we came in the house we saw a big table, people were sitting,\nlaying on the floor, some of them already sick from overeating. And some of them\nwere eating bread that I -- first time I saw a big chunk of bread like this, in my life,\nyou know, for five years. And I started eating too. I got a little bit sick too from it.\nAnd then the medics came in, that\u2019s the medics when -- when they healed my\nwound on the head. I told him about it and he shaved it and he put a bandage on it,\nmedicine on it. I don\u2019t remember if he gave me some pills to take, that I can\u2019t\nremember. But I know he gave me some pills to take for my stomach, cause we\nwere sick, all of us were sick. He says, don\u2019t overeat, just go slowly. Don\u2019t -- don\u2019t\n-- don\u2019t do too much. But we were -- water [indecipherable] stop drinking for that\nDecember 20, 1999\nday. It\u2019s hard to describe a day like this, you know, it\u2019s -- for the lifetime. And we\nwere liberated and that was it.",
        "A: Yes, I was with my -- quite a few from my hometown, my friends. We sort of\ndecide to stick together, one another, help one -- we said, if one gets weak while\nyou\u2019re marching, let\u2019s help him, put him under the arms an-and -- because if you\ndidn\u2019t, if you get left towards the end when everybody walks and you get stopped,\nand you keep walking away from him, they kill him on the other end. And I do\nremember then, three nights before we were liberated, and it was near Neuenburg\n[indecipherable] that was in baria -- in Bavaria. He chopped away a few people\nfrom our group, I don\u2019t know how many, and he told them to go the other direction\ninto the wooded area. And as we were marching away from there a mile or two we\nheard lot of gunshots going. And they killed them. Three nights before, they just\nkilled them over there. And somehow, I don\u2019t know whether they had -- they had\nthe grave ready for them or not, but when we came back -- because that was the\nnearest little town for us to come back to, Neuenburg [indecipherable]. When we\ncame back we were told that they -- the army discovered the freshly dug grave, and\nthey didn\u2019t know who that -- what it was. So this captain, I remember he had two\nlittle bars on the top of his shoulder, I think he was a captain, I can\u2019t remember his\nDecember 20, 1999\nname. And he says he gave orders that Sunday after liberation, the non-Jews -- that\nthe Gentiles are going to church, they cannot go to church that day. And then he had\nall the carpenters build boxes, coffins. And they came over there and they had to dig\nout the grave, that was hardly covered. The Germans, they had to take the -- the\nGermans had to go down there and they take the bodies -- we -- were seeing -- we\nsee -- that\u2019s where we saw that this -- these people belonged to our group, that we\nlost three nights before we were liberated. And I remember seeing the soldiers,\nAmerican soldiers crying, they were -- tears came out of there. And usually a\nsoldier is harder, th-they\u2019re tough. But they were saying how these people got killed\nand shot in the head. It was just inhumane. And they made these people put them in\nboxes and they put them on a truck and they took them to a regular cemetery there\nin -- near Neuenburg [indecipherable] and they put them in the cemetery, all in\none grave, but each wa -- each body in a coffin, that I do remember. And that was\njust three days, they didn\u2019t -- their luck was not there. When I was liberated I did\nsee a few of my friends, yes, from my own town, even, that we got -- th-then we\nhad a -- from out of town we had a lot of that we\u2019ve got -- became friends with. We\nstuck together, a-all til I was separated an-and sent to this country and they went to\nEngland, some of them.\nDecember 20, 1999",

        "A: What means free, you don\u2019t have a guard near you, you\u2019re free to roam around\nwherever you want to. It is a good feeling, the best feeling in your life. The worst\nfeeling is when they take your freedom away from you, this 1s the worst. And I can\ntell the difference, and the difference makes a lot if you\u2019re free. It was unbelievable,\nunbelievable. You -- you thought the heavens opened up and the Messiah came\ndown here. The freedom, it was unbelievable to -- t-to see that happen, at the time.\nDecember 20, 1999",

He says, I'll make sure of that, before you get out,\nDecember 20, 1999\nthat you\u2019ll all be dead. In the meantime, after we got liberated, we came out of\nthere, we saw that man on th -- in -- somewhere in the trenches laying dead.\nSomebody killed him, I don\u2019t know who.

        "A: The first thing I chose to do 1s food, was my number one prorioty. And then --\nthen I was trying to get myself together, started to think about my family right\naway. So I said, where are these people, I don\u2019t -- I knew I had a sister in America,\nI didn\u2019t know where she lives.

        "A: Zachary.",
        "A: After the liberation we lived in -- I lived in different places. I was in Neuenburg\n[indecipherable] first, and then we moved to Zeilitzheim, near Frankfurt. There\nwas a DP, displaced person camp, and I remember the UNRRA, run by UNRRA\nDecember 20, 1999\n503, I remember the number, I still got a picture of it, too. And there we came back\nlike to civilization. We came in there and there were beds for each one of us with a\nmattress, with a pillow, with a cover. We had a kitchen. Whether it was kosher, I\ndon\u2019t know, but we did have a kitchen and we had lots of -- we had plenty of food\nto eat in that -- in that displaced person camp. And then we were scrounging around\nfor clothes, started dress, you know, nicely. And we were able to do that, and\nwaiting to get to this country. And also, I was also -- before I came to this country I\nwound up working with the American soldiers. They chose six of us. They took us\nin to work for them. Our job was to hand the food out to the soldiers. So we had\nbeen -- we had a -- a check on the fingernails and the hands every morning before\nwe handed the food out. We didn't wear gloves, but he made sure that our hands\nwere washed clearly -- clean and -- and we handed out all the food to the soldiers.\nSo we got along fine. We -- we lived with the soldiers within the compound and we\n-- we were one of theirs. So I hated to separate them, but -- you know, but I had to\nleave for this country, I had to come meet my sister. But they treated us real nice.",

And he is in a cor -- ina\nplace called L\u00e9dz. I am not sure, but I think it was L\u00e9dz. And before she left, I\nhappened to visit her in Bergen-Belsen. She -- she survived in Bergen-Belsen, so I\nwent to visit her there, and we were talking, she said she\u2019s going to go to L\u00e9dz, go\nsee where her brother is. So I said, while you\u2019re going there, I said, maybe you\u2019 ll\nrun into brother. And sure enough when she talked to her brother, her brother said\nthat my brother has also arrived there. And they got in touch, so my brother sent a\nnote with her saying that I should come to visit him. And I was a little bit scared to\nbe anywhere except being with the U.S. Army. I was safe with them, and I felt that I\nshouldn\u2019t go no place. And we got back to him and told him, wrote him a li -- a note\nsaying that he -- if he wants to see me he has to come to Zeilitzheim, near\nFrankfurt, and I'll be there. And he decided, and he did come. When he came we\ngot hooked up together. And we still didn\u2019t know what happened to the older\nbrother until we found out, after we wrote to my sister in the United States, she told\nus that Dave, the oldest is in America too, already living with her. He came in 1941\nto this country, through -- from Lithuania through Japan, from Japan to the\nUnited States. He came just before Pearl Harbor, by maybe a month or so. And so\nhe was -- he yel -- he escaped all the punishment from all the concentration camps.\nHe was the lucky one, I think. So we all wound up here in America with my sister,\nDecember 20, 1999\nthree guys living with my sister. She took us in, all three of us. She fixed up her --\nher attic with hardwood floors, beautiful up there. We really had a nice place to live\nup there. She fed us well. My sister Diana.

And he says to me, oh you\u2019re such a handsome guy, he said,\ncome over, we don\u2019t need to stay with these people here -- he was driving -- he said,\nDecember 20, 1999\nPll take you down here to this -- something going on, people from Washington\ncame here, like the women\u2019s Zionist organization, into a synagogue and I\u2019ll take\nyou down, maybe you\u2019 ll meet somebody nice. He took me, I think by myself or\nwith Zachary, I\u2019m not sure. But all I know, we went there and the people that came\nfrom Washington had [indecipherable] with her. And we | -- I looked at her, she\nlooked at me, we sort of eyed each other and we started ex -- talking. He came over,\nthe old man came over. He says Henry, come on, I'll -- I\u2019ll introduce you to a nice\ngirl. I says, you don\u2019t know that girl, how can -- he says, don\u2019t worry about it, I\u2019ll\ngo over there. He talked to the father and mother, he says, is this your daughter?\nAnd they said yes. Well here, I got a friend over here, a nice looking boy, he\u2019s\nlooking for a girl. So I met her and [indecipherable] been 52 years going to be, this\nDecember that I\u2019m married. I came back to Washington, I call her, she called me,\nand we dated for about a year. Came *46 -- end of \u201947, I was already married, one\nyear later.",
        "A: She\u2019s American, she was born in this country. Her parents come from Europe.\nThey came in the 19\" century some time to the -- 1902, I think that\u2019s on the paper.",
        "A: I have children, I got three sons and a daughter.\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "A: Their names, Norman and Bernard and Stanley and Gail.",
        "A: My wife chose the names. She was -- she was choose them wi -- chosen -- it\u2019s\nnot choosing the names, we named them after our parents. Norman, he\u2019s named\nafter my father, Nuchem. Bernard is a -- is named after part of my sister Brundl,\ncause her -- the B will be in there. Stanley, I think is named after an uncle, I think.\nBut my -- my daughter, she is named after my mother, Gittel. And it so happened\nthat she was born -- I lost my mother on the 27\" of October, 1942, and my daughter\nis born on -- on October the 27\", what does that mean? October the 27\" she was\nborn. And she is -- she is named after my mother.",
        "A: Well, not for awhile, when they were young I didn\u2019t tell them, but later on, as\nthey got older I told them all what happened. And they couldn\u2019t believe something\nlike this would happen, that one human being could do that to another human being.\nAnd they couldn\u2019t get over it, but yet -- they did -- kept asking questions. My\nnumber -- for awhile I would tell them that\u2019s my phone number. I wouldn\u2019t tell\nthem, I didn\u2019t want to tell them. Until the picture came out. It was in 1978, I think it\nDecember 20, 1999\ncame out. It was called the h -- it was called, \u201cHolocaust,\u201d and it played for four\ndays, was like a documentary.",
        "A: On television, of course. And then they sat with me and we watched it. And then\nwhen the questions and answers opened up, that\u2019s when they were really into it and\nthen they were [indecipherable] or not, they didn\u2019t believe, how could you ever\nsurvive all this? My God, how could you ever survive this? And I told them, it was\neven worse than that. They di -- they didn\u2019t put everything in that picture, because\npeople wouldn't have watch it. They had to -- so it wouldn\u2019t be so horrified like --\nlike it was. We had the -- we had a much, much more problems than what they saw\nin the picture. And that\u2019s when they -- I told them all what happened.",
        "A: I followed it a little bit, yes, I followed it, yeah.",
        "A: Well that -- there was newspaper, and I think we saw some -- I think on\ntelevision, I think, some parts, I think years ago, or later on maybe, I saw it on TV,\nDecember 20, 1999\npart of it, but mostly in the paper. Like I say a -- everybody was denying, because\nsomebody else says that it wasn\u2019t their fault, they took orders.",
        "A: Well yes, yeah, justice was done, they should have killed every one of them, na -\n- nobody should have gone out of there alive. They should have punished every one\nof them, cause they knew what happened, they knew what they were doing. They --\nthis escape goat that they took orders is -- is not -- no such a thing. They were\neducated people. The-These men -- these men were not primitive, they -- they were\neducated, they had college degrees, they were professors. They were very well\neducated people. How does an educated person let himself get away to kill other\npeople? An-Annhaliate a whole nation, how do you do that? A whole race, rather.\nHow -- how di-did you let yourself do all this? Whether th-the order is right or\nwrong, you should be able to tell whether you do the right thing or not. And you did\nit, so don\u2019t try to escape now.",
        "A: Yes, I did, and I was hoping that\u2019s what would happen and I hoped to God Israel\nwouldn\u2019t had a -- wish Israel would have had a country five years before that,\nmaybe wouldn't have had all this problem. Somebody would have been out there to\nDecember 20, 1999\nspeak up for us, somebody would have opened their arms and gates to let us in.\nInstead, where we were, we couldn\u2019t -- there was no way, we couldn\u2019t travel,\nnobody wanted us. We were -- we -- we were -- like everybody had a deaf ear, they\ndidn\u2019t hear wa -- no matter what they did to us, nobody believed it\n[indecipherable]. But in -- in -- in this country here --",
        "A: We were -- I was listening on the radio with the partition, I remember\n[indecipherable] it was going on, the votes that were taking, and thank God of Mr.\nwhat\u2019s his name? President Truman, if it wouldn\u2019t for him, I don\u2019t think we would\nhave had an Israel. He was the only, kindest president we had. Roosevelt\nsupposingly supposed to have been good to the Jews, but I found out later, I\nunderstand that he was not that good to our Jewish people, that he did not help\nmuch, especially with the -- with the letting people into this country. The -- the --\nwhat do you call those, the law, what do you call that law?",
        "A: The quotas, when we immigrate, yeah, 1mmi -- to immigrate people to this\ncountry. I mean, we are good people, we were hard working people. He could have\nleft us in here, we would have prosper here. Our children did good. We -- we took --\nDecember 20, 1999\nwe show -- we showed America that we came here not for a handout. We came\nhere, raised children, professionals, to make a good living. They are hard working\npeople. We didn\u2019t cause anybody no problems.",
        "A: My children do for a living, I got -- two boys are dentists, my daughter is\nsecretary, my eldest son used to work in business with me as a businessman. So\neverybody had some -- did something, there was nobody was waiting for a handout\nfrom nobody. So if -- 1f Roosevelt would have let us in right in the beginning, we\nwould have been an asset to this country, I think.",
        "A: Well, in 1950 I started to, you know, get my family, I\u2019m married and I have one\nson, trying to get a job, the job worked, and I wanted something else. So I went into\na dry cleaning business. Worked with my brother in the dry cleaning business. Then\nI bought my brother out of the business and I went by myself, me and my son was\nrunning it. It was hard work, every day, 12 hours a day, working every day, busy\nworking, trying to do -- make a living. And I thought I made a nice living here, I did\nokay. And everybody\u2019s fine.\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "A: I followed that in Israel, yeah, I followed how they caught him, the Israeli,\nthey\u2019re geniuses if they ever found that man. And how they got him out of that\ncountry, too. They -- they something are, they are the best in the world. They got\nhim, th-they did the right thing, punish him. Whatever they did to him, he deserve\nit. They just set a e -- too easy of a death. They ought to put him in a cage and keep\nhim 1n a cage and -- and send him over the world, and keep him in the cage and see\nwhat he did to human beings. This was too easy for him, to kill him that way they\nkilled him in Israel, hanging him. Was too easy for him.",
        "A: The American -- I can\u2019t remember what happened, but I know there was fors and\nagainsts. People thought maybe they shouldn\u2019t have got him out of there the way\nthey did, with the laws and all. But this was a -- a murderer, he was killing millions\nof people, and experimenting on -- on children, I mean, he -- he deserved what he\ngot.\nDecember 20, 1999\nchange? Did anything -- was anything particularly of interest or special meaning for\nyou?",
        "A: Well, wa -- when I came to this country though, we had the segregation here.\nWell, that made me feel a little bit uncomfortable. I said, they are human beings,\nwhy don\u2019t they have -- why can\u2019t they go to drink water at the same fountain that\nwe drink? What\u2019s the difference, we -- if you\u2019re going to war, you fight with the\nguys, soldiers, black or white fight together. Why shouldn\u2019t they be able to go into\nthe same bathroom, for instance as we -- as the whites go on the same water -- or\nlive in the same area? That made me a little bit uncomfortable, I was happy to see\nwhat had happened with Martin Luther King, he spoke up for them, he one of the\ngreatest spokespeople in the world, I think is, the way he carried himself through.\nSorry that he had to be killed. And he did a lot for the black population, the black --\nblack people. And also, I didn\u2019t -- I was uncomfortable coming to this country and I\nremember driving along on Massachusetts Avenue in my brother-in-law\u2019s car and I\nremember seeing a sign on Massachusetts Avenue would say, this area 1s\nrestricted. And I would ask my brother-in-law, what does it mean restricted? He\nsays, that means no Jews or no blacks can live in this area. Now, I was very\nuncomfortable with that. And then driving through the White House one time and I\nsaw the skinheads with their swastikas in front of the White House. I could not\nDecember 20, 1999\ncomprehend that either in this country, but I wasn\u2019t aware yet that this Freedom of\nSpeech business 1s, I was not aware of it. I -- now I know why the reason they let\nthem do it.",
        "A: Not really, I mean, that\u2019s th-the -- the -- the -- Vietnam, the war was -- that was\nan uncomfortable war, lot of young people got killed for no reason. But -- you\nknow, and all that, but still the United States speaks out now, they speak out for the\nworld now. They don\u2019t let things get away out of hand any more like they used to.\nThey shove it under the table like it not existed. Now if something breaks out and\nyou wonder o-or -- or the other countries where -- no matter where it happens,\npeople speak out. In those days when we were suffering and we were getting killed\nan -- and burnt and -- a-and -- and everything, nobody would ever take up for us.\nYou didn\u2019t hear anything. Why didn\u2019t all these people speak out in those days,\nmaybe they would have been saved, a lot of people, if they would have spoke out at\nthat time.\nDecember 20, 1999\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: When I first came here, yes, I did. I was driving along in the str -- in the roads, I\nseen, I guess [indecipherable] I think that this -- this is restricted and no Jews can\ngo here. Some -- I understand some department stores wouldn\u2019t hire Jews. I don\u2019t\nremember the name of the department, I think it was Garfinkel when I came here to\nthis country, I think. I think it was Garfinkel that said there was no Jews hired in\nthis place. And I mean, you could see it, even when I was in business I could see --\ndetect a little bit anti-Semism -- anti-Semitism, but that\u2019s not much, that\u2019s not\nmuch. It was not like it was on -- in Europe, definitely not.",
        "A: ma volunteer, and I -- I\u2019m a volunteer for the museum, I go out on speaking --\nthey ask me to go out to talk to schools, or churches, or some organizations that\nwant to hear a Holocaust survivor, I do go out to speak. Or sometimes within the\nbuilding a group comes and they want to have a survivor to speak to them, and they\nask me to, I do it. And tho -- that\u2019s the way I do my volunteer work.\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m down there every week on Fridays, I\u2019m -- then I ca -- except for either\nother meetings that they have or other functions when they have, I do get invited, I\ngo down there. No matter what they ask me to do, I do it.",

They do ask\nme all questions and I\u2019m -- if I\u2019m a survivor, I do tell them that that\u2019s what I\u2019m\ndoing. And some people are very generous, they come up to donate a little bit\nmoney sometimes. And we do a good job over there overall. We\u2019re like the\nambassador or the goodwill at that desk.",
        "A: Well, I guess my experience in th -- in th -- in the -- in the camps that I had and\nthrough all that ti -- bad time that we had, I guess I do talk about it to people if they\nhave some questions they want to ask, I do tell them well, what I saw and what I\nthink.\nDecember 20, 1999",
        "A: Well, we don\u2019t know what happens. All of a sudden everybody wants to know\nabout the Holocaust. It\u2019s so many years before, I wish they would ask all these\nquestions 50 some years ago, I would have remembered a little bit more than I can\nremember now, because the mind bottles, y-you can\u2019t remember a lot of things. It\u2019s\nbeen 50 some years now. In the beginning no one was interested, nobody wanted to\ntalk about it. They want to shove it under the table like nothing happened. How can\nyou shove something like this under the table? Six million Jewish people and\nchildren killed, and plus five, I think or six others, for other reasons that were killed.\n12 someth -- 12 million people died. And thank God the -- that the museum is here,\nbecause us survivors, how long are we going to be here? Another 20 years, I --\nhopefully, and then -- well, no, you have now some professors or book writers\ntrying to write the book saying that the Holocaust never existed. But how can they\nsay that? We are here. The survivors are still here. And once we go, then they\u2019Il\nhave to look up into the museum, see our records, our talks, our speeches, our\ndocumentaries that we gave. They\u2019 Il have to pay attention to that. So\n[indecipherable] now, what gets me too is, wa -- if they don\u2019t believe us survivors,\nwhy don\u2019t they check with the army? The U.S. Army has -- has liberated many\n[indecipherable] liberated me, and I know they saw what happened to us. So it\nmust -- it had to be a Holocaust. So these people trying to make a -- a fast dollar,\nDecember 20, 1999\nwriting these books that the Holocaust never existed -- when I go into the museum I\nthink I\u2019m in a memorial place. I\u2019m thinking of coming to visit my parents, I\u2019m\nthinking it\u2019s a cemetery here. I have nowhere to go to, to see my mother, my other\nsiblings that have passed away, or they\u2019re killed, they took them and murdered\nthem. I go there, I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m like am-amongst them. When you go up upstairs\nand you see the -- the shoes or the brush -- toothbrushes or the glasses, you look --\nI\u2019m thinking -- I said, mine might be right in there. And I\u2019m always thinking about\nthat when I\u2019m upstairs.",
        "A: If we let it get out of hand, yes, definitely. You al -- you always got to be\nvigilant, you always got to keep abreast. You can\u2019t hide anything. You got to speak\nout, just like we do now, what happens in other countries. If we keep that up, I\nwould say no, it will never happen again.",

        "A: While Israel was at war I felt bad for them because they stood all alone, by\nthemselves. And all these hostile countries, all of them against them. And thank\nGod th -- only the United States was helping a little bit, which that helped,\notherwise they would -- they had to do the job on their own, fighting all these\nenemies. And it brought me back to -- a little bit back to the concentration camp.\nWe were all alone. Nobody speaks out for you. They had -- they had to fight their\nown battles, so to speak, the Israelis.

I\nwant them to be educated because I was deprived of this. So the main goal was the\neducation in my house, that was the main thing. And then of course, protect --\noverprotective, which the kids say that I was, and -- both of us parents, my wife and\n-- and me. But that comes from where I was. I mean, we had to protect your\nchildren, so they don\u2019t get in any problems with -- with the law, or that they had all\nthese problems they had in the 60\u2019s here. Thank God I didn\u2019t have any problem\nDecember 20, 1999\nwith my children. But I was vil -- I can\u2019t pronounce the word -- vigilant?
