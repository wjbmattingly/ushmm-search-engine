        "A: What do you want me to tell you?",
        "Q: Tell me about Rozia",
        "A: Rozia was born in Kollupzowa in 1922. In March, well, it doesn\u2019t make a difference. I don\u2019t\nremember the date, but I know it was in March 1922. Their father had a flourmill in the lumber\nmill and they were not ultra, well, let\u2019s forget about the orthodoxy. She went to Kollupzowa to\npublic school. After public school she started to work for somebody who was a seamstress.",
        "Q: Was she an apprentice?",
        "A: She was an apprentice. She wanted not for a profession but just to know how to dress, to fix\nand all those things. This was a neighbor of them.",
        "Q: How old was she when she did that?",
        "A: She was on this time, no before the apprentice, when she was in the public school she also\nattended Basiankov (?). Basiankov is a religious school for girls and when she finished\nBasiankov, she must have been at this time about 15 years old. And then later she started to be\nan apprentice by this woman who was a neighbor of theirs and she start to learn how to sew and\nthose things.",
        "Q: Did she have brothers and sisters?",
        "A: Yes, she had one sister which she\u2019s alive. The sister, the name was Hanka and Hanka, after she\nfinished gymnasium, means high school, she went to Krakow. Then she had a brother and after\nthe brother finished gymnasium, which was high school, he worked in a bank. That was the\nonly Jewish bank in Kollupzowa and the brother worked there.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: His name was Yanik. Now Hanka with her husband survived the war in Russia. They were\nsent away to Russia and Rozia\u2019s father and Yanik went with them together and they all survived\nin Siberia in Russia. Rozia was left.",
        "Q: When Rozia was 15, it was 1938 already?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Right when she started apprenticing?",
        "A: No, she started apprenticing earlier. She started in 1936 I would say. In 1936. And she with\nthis woman who had this place she was there about three years and then the war started. Rozia,\nwhen the war started, the sister Hanka, with her husband, they lived in Kracow, they came to\nKollupzowa to escape the Germans, they escaped to the East and they came to Kollupzowa so\nthe father and the brother went with them to escape to the Russian side. Hanka, the husband,\nand the brother and the father.",
        "Q: What about Rozia\u2019s mother?",
        "A: Rozia\u2019s mother was left home because on this time the Jews thought the woman can be saved\nbecause nobody thought they would do anything to a woman, they thought only to the men. So\nshe remained home. Her mother didn\u2019t feel so good so they remained home. And, well, you\ndon\u2019t want to bring me in I have nothing to do with it.",
        "Q: Well, when did you meet her?",
        "A: I met her when I was 13 years old, she was 11 years old, I fell in love with her, and I didn\u2019t\nspeak to her because we couldn\u2019t speak to girls. I was a Hassidic boy until I was about 17, 18\nyears, the first time I spoke to her. But I always had her in my mind and when I escaped to\nRussia she remained home and then I was in Russia for three months. Then one day somebody\ncame and told me that her mother is gravely ill and I decided to come home. They said not to\ntell it to her brother, to her father and to her sister because if you would tell it to them they were\nafraid they would come back and they didn\u2019t want they should come back to the German side,\nbecause they were on the Russian side. But the day I was told I decided to go home. I thought\nshe is alone, she is sick I will go home and I came home on a Sunday and Tuesday her mother\ndied. I saw her Sunday when I came home; she hardly recognized me, and I told her I gave her\nregards from the husband and son and the daughter and the son-in-law. Tuesday she died, she\ndied of cancer. So Rozia...",
        "Q: And this was in 1939?",
        "A: This was already in January 1940.",
        "Q: What was the situation then in Kollupzowa?",
        "A: Well in January \u00b040, it was the situation was the Germans started Jews to work and to harass\nJews. But nobody knew and nobody thought that such a thing can be like extermination of the\nJews. They took Jews to work to forced labor. I was with the Germans before I escaped to\nRussia. I was with the Germans for six weeks. After when they occupied my town, then later I\nescaped to the Russian zone. But when I came back the situation settled a little. The Jews had\nto work every day or they didn\u2019t have the quota so they went from house to house and they took\nout the Jews and they had to do all kinds of work. This was in winter so mostly the Jews were\nused to clean up the roads from snow, they cleaned the streets. But we knew the Germans were\nthere but the Jews were still in their homes, they still had businesses. It was just in the\nbeginning.",
        "Q: So, now what was Rozia doing during this time after her family left?",
        "A: After her family left she was with her mother. Her mother was very sick so she was with her\nmother. Now when I came back and her mother died and she was left alone. She was in this\ntime 18 years old, so and uncle took care of her. Because there was a house, two houses, the\nbusiness was a family business. Like two uncles and her father, so they took her in. She was\nstill in her apartment, but she ate by them and they took care of her. Then she didn\u2019t do\nanything. By the Germans if they started to take people to work, usually Rozia was not taken to\nwork because she lived not in the town, this was in the outskirts and the Germans didn\u2019t go to\ncatch Jews to work because they were mostly like Poles and they didn\u2019t take the Poles. So they\ndidn\u2019t know if there are Jews. So she actually didn\u2019t go to work.",
        "Q: Her uncles did?",
        "A: Also no, because they were far away from the town. Her, only had one uncle, his name was\nKila Schmidt, he was an elderly man and he was a very, very intelligent man with a grey beard.\nHe was taken from time to time. Only when the Poles showed the Germans that there are Jews\nliving there. Because mostly they caught the Jews when it was a very concentration where the\nJews were living. So he was brought to work and they humiliated him because he was an\nelderly man. And I remember one time they put on him like a bottle on his back and he had to\ntake water and carry it in the bottle. One time they took a wagon and they harnessed him to the\nwagon instead of the horse and he had to pull the wagon and there were a few German soldiers\nwere sitting on the wagon and they used to hit him that he should go faster. He was an old man.\nSo I remember a few times when the uncle was humiliated.",
        "Q: And her uncle, did he live in town?",
        "A: No he lived in the same house, the same place. Because they had two houses which belonged to\nthis flourmill and the lumber yard. So they lived there and they were not thrown out yet in this\ntime. And this house she lived with them and then when I came back I started to see her quite\noften, practically every day. And if she needed something I took care of it. And she lived there\nwith the family \u2018till June 1941, was established a ghetto in our town, so she was taken with the\nfamily to that ghetto. They got two rooms in a house in the ghetto and she lived with the two\nuncles, the aunts with their children in the ghetto.",
        "Q: You were in the ghetto too?",
        "A: I was in the ghetto too, so when in the ghetto, there was a different system. The Germans didn\u2019t\ngo out and grab people, Jews from the houses in the streets to go to work, it was already\norganized. There was a Judenrat and the Judenrat had a list of all able-bodied Jews and they\ndivided and they sent out cards what day each Jew had to work. This way not the same Jews\nshould be called every day. So when it came to Rozia\u2019s time so she was notified and she went\nto work like other Jews went to work, cleaning houses by Germans, cleaning the streets,\nthrowing away snow in the winter. She did all kinds of work the same way.",
        "Q: Let me just check this.",
        "A: O,K. Then we lived like this in the ghetto and then later I was taken away from the ghetto.\nThis was in January \u201942 which was already bad because every time the situation got worse so I\nhad a mastoid, a middle ear infection, and they had to smuggle me out from the ghetto so she\nhad to go with me with my younger sister to the hospital. But the day we had to go by sled in\nthe very deep winter high snow, so she had trouble with her tonsils, she had high temperature,\nso she didn\u2019t go. But when I was in the hospital and I was operated, about two weeks later she\ncame to this town to the big town, somehow she got a pass because you couldn\u2019t travel by train,\nyou couldn\u2019t go out from the ghetto. We were in the ghetto. So she got a pass and she came to\nme to the town where I was in the hospital and I think this was the most happiest day in this\ntime that she arrived.",
        "Q: You got sick with an ear infection and you were sent to Tarnov. I wasn\u2019t sent. I was with an ear\ninfection over four weeks. Instead to take care, we didn\u2019t have nobody to take care and it got\nworse and worse until the whole pus went already to the brain and then we saw that there is no\nway. I was practically dead. So with a sled they took me out of the ghetto to , toa\nbigger town and we came to and we came to , to a doctor, there was a\nspecialist to an ear, nose and throat, Dr. Heller, and he said if I did not get an operation within\ntwo hours, three hours, I would be dead because the pus was already around my membrane,\nfrom the brain. So through, my brother went back home and finally they bribed somebody and\nwe got a pass to go on the train, because to this town we had to go to Kracow, so two sisters\nwent with me. On the train Poles wanted to throw me out from the running train. So they\ncalled the police and the police saw that we had legitimate passes, so the police said what do\nyou want, they have legitimate passes because we got the passes. So the Poles said,\nnevertheless you have to throw them out because no Jews are allowed on the train. So we\nbegged them, the police, we begged the police, we begged the police to let us stay \u2018till the next\nstation. Not to throw us out from a running train. They said I am almost dead. So the police\nsaid O.K., so we sent to the next station which was Tarnov, this was half way from us to\nKracow and they took us down, they had to carry me to some friends, because I was almost\ndead. And there was a hospital and luckily in Tarnov, there was a doctor, and his name was\nDavid Robinovitch. He used to be the head of a very famous hospital in Lodz but the name of\nthe hospital was and he was a specialist, ear, throat, nose. So when they brought me\nover to him, he said he doesn\u2019t think he can do anything to me, that it is too late because I was\nalready with this ear infection for about four or five weeks and the pain was so that people\ncannot imagine how that pained. So he said we have nothing what to lose we have to have an\noperation right away. And he took him about six hours and he operated me and he said to my\nsisters, he said I made the operation but ninety-nine percent he wouldn\u2019t wake up. And if he\nwould even wake up all his mouth would be crooked or his eyes he wouldn\u2019t see or his ears,\nbecause it was impossible because everything was already full with pus. Anyway when I woke\nup after eight days when he took off the bandages I can hear on this ear better than on the other\none. The eyes are good, the mouth is good. He was a genius that he made this operation, and\nthen a few days later, Rozia came. When she came naturally I was very happy and I was in this\ntown, in Tarnov, I was February, March, \u2018till April 20 or April 12, 1942, because until he had to\nclean. Meanwhile she was with me all the time and then she had always trouble with her\ntonsils, so she complained so the doctor said once you are here he operated, he took out her\ntonsils. Now he wanted money, but from Rozia he didn\u2019t want a penny, because from me we\nhad to pay him a lot of money for the operation and for Rozia he said he would do the operation\nwithout money. So we asked him how come. He said well when you came and you started to\ntell me stories and your sisters, so I could get money out from you. With Rozia she had nobody,\nher mother died, her father, sister and brother were in Russia, where would she have money. So\nI need people like you, they should pay me for people who cannot pay me. So I do operations\nfor free. So he operated on Rozia and took off her tonsils, she shouldn\u2019t owe us because every\nfew months he had infections in the tonsils and we came home both together.",
        "Q: So when was it you went back to Kollupzowa?",
        "A: So we came back from this town, from this hospital, we came back to Kollupzowa. When we\ncame back, the ghetto was all together changed, we couldn\u2019t recognize the ghetto. It was\nalready so far, the gates were closed and April 28, the Gestapo came in, they shot my father,\nthey shot this time 22 Jews, and they had a list of 22 Jews and my father was between them and\nthen later everything went down, every day was worse, there were killings and killings and\nkillings. Until June the 20\" we were chased out from our ghetto, from Kollupzowa, to a larger\nghetto, to and in ves",
        "Q: How was Rozia\u2019s family, all her uncles?",
        "A: All her uncles were alive, she was staying with her uncles, all her uncles were alive and when\nwe were all chased out to this larger, she went with her uncles and we were in this larger town\nfrom about June 20\" \u2018till July 7\". July 7\u201c they started Axias, means transportation from\nRzeszow to Belzec, and with this first action, this was July the 7\u201c, my family was taken and\nnaturally Rozia with her uncles were taken the same day to Belzec and she perished in Belzec.\nI don\u2019t know exactly the date, but 1t could be a day or two or three days the most after July the\n7\", But was mostly the trip to Belzec from us, took about five hours, and sometimes they had\nto wait in line because there were so many trains waiting, so they should be next exterminated.\nThis was one of the first death camps that they didn\u2019t have gas chambers, they suffocated the\npeople when they put them in hermetic closed chambers and they pumped in carbon monoxide.",
        "Q: From trucks?",
        "A: From trucks. Not so much in trucks as from Russian tanks. And then later when they choked to\ndeath which took quite a long time, it took about twenty to twenty-five minutes, they took them\nout. They didn\u2019t cremate the people in this time yet, because this was right in the beginning.\nBut they had very big ditches. Those ditches were made because this was near the\nGerman/Russian border, before 1941 when Germany attacked Russia so they had anti-tank\nditches so they filled up those ditches with people and they covered them with sand. Then later\nthey took kerosene and they burned them. So this is how she perished.",
        "Q: Did you lose track of her once you left Rzeszow?",
        "A: Well when they left the ghetto they were in Rzeszow for a few weeks, not a few weeks about\ntwo weeks, no I had contact with them same as with my family but when they took them to\nBelzec we didn\u2019t know, so we hired a friendly Pole and the friendly Pole we sent him on the\nsame track that the trains went so it took him two weeks and he came back and through people\nhe found out they were taken to a place called Belzec and supposedly they were killed in\nBelzec.",
        "Q: She was taken there, you weren\u2019t taken there.",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t taken because what happened is my family was taken there but when they were taken,\nso this man who was the head from the Gestapo in our town he organized a camp. If you read,\neverything is in the book. He organized a camp, a labor camp in Kollupzowa, and he brought\nback hundred young Jews and me he established in our house of prayers or synagogue. He\nestablished a camp. And the reason he brought us back is because he wanted to destroy the\nghetto, because they didn\u2019t want to leave anything that was Jewish, so we lived in the\nsynagogue and made the camp and every day went out and we destroyed house by house. And\nit\u2019s exactly the description how the destruction went on in the book. Because we had to go\ntogether to Belzec, but they took out hundred from our town and we went back and when we\nsaw we had nothing left. After a few months, and the end of November, we escaped into the\nwoods and this is how I survived. Otherwise we would be taken to Belzec the same thing as all\nthe people, because they accumulated in Rzeszow about hundred thousand Jews from all towns\nwho surround Rzeszow. Because what they want to do is they want to have the Jews in one\nplace where there 1s a railroad station. Now they told the Jews that they can take along with\nthem anything they want. So this is what they wanted, the Jews should bring over everything\nand later when they took them away to Belzec all their stuff was left in the town in the ghetto\nand the Germans had it in one place.",
        "Q: In Rzeszow\u201d?",
        "A: In Rzeszow and they later took it to their warehouses and the things that they needed they took\naway and the rest they gave to Poles. The other thing I wanted to mention about Rozia, when\nwe saw it starting to be bad, this was before I went to the hospital. You see I had a younger\nsister, my younger sister, and she was very pretty, she was very intelligent. She spoke a few\nlanguages. She spoke English, she spoke German, she spoke Hebrew, Polish.",
        "Q: Was this Rachel?",
        "A: Rachel. And Rachel was only three years older than I was so we tried to arrange, Rachel should\nescape because there was a man, a Polish family who were thrown out from their houses, from\ntheir town in Pozna. Pozna was a town that it was next to the German Reich. This was from\nwestern border in Poland and they came to our town and they opened a little store in our town\nin the beginning of the war, and became very friendly. And they had a son a little older than I\nwas, about five years older, and we became very friendly. So he begged my mother and Rachel,\nthey would move away from our town to a different town and they would make believe that her\nson 1s a husband of Rachel, that Rachel is a daughter-in-law, in this way she would be able to\nsurvive with them. When they told us this, we thought it\u2019s a very good idea and then I came to\nRozia and she looked Jewish whatsoever, she looked so typical Aryan. She had blue-greenish\neyes and she had gold hair and she didn\u2019t look at all Jewish. So I told her, let\u2019s make\narrangements because Rachel is going to run away with this family and you will go with them\nand we will make up somehow papers that you are a sister. We\u2019ll make false papers, it means\nthat she\u2019s married to this Pole and you will go away with them. We talked and talked and she\nsomehow was afraid. She said, I cannot take a chance. I am afraid. I do not have guts to do it.\nShe said, my sister Rachel could do it because you are so capable, she admired Rachel, and you\ncan do it. So Rachel didn\u2019t want to go because she didn\u2019t want to leave the family. And Rozia\nwas afraid, she was afraid. Maybe if she wouldn\u2019t be afraid maybe Rachel would somehow\nleave the family and go. Well, once we told them this, my sister Rachel had another chance to\nbe saved. When the ghetto was established, they brought into our town Arbeits Amt. Arbeits\nAmt means a German labor office to register all the working people and the head of it was a\nGerman, and they needed somebody to be his secretary who spoke fluently German and could\nwrite German. My sister spoke beautiful German. So the Judenrat assigned my sister to be his\nsecretary, and she worked with him. They became very friendly. He liked her very much. She\nwas a very nice person, and when the Jews were chased out of our ghetto to Rzeszow, naturally\nthis Arbeits Ant didn\u2019t exist any more. So in Rzeszow, in the ghetto, somehow on the street he\nmet my sister, he was very happy, he said, you know what I am transferred from Rzeszow and I\nam now the head of the Arbeits Amt in Rzeszow and I need a secretary. Why don\u2019t you become\nagain my secretary and I will give you a permit to stay here and you will not be taken away. So\nshe said she would remain if he will give a pass to my other sisters and to my mother. My\nfather was already shot. He said well I can only save you not the other ones. So she didn\u2019t\nwant. So sometimes the closeness of the family, the attachment to the family sometimes it was\na curse for the Jews. Because a lot f Jews could be saved, they could save themselves to run\naway, or do something, but they wouldn\u2019t do it because they didn\u2019t want to leave their families,\ntheir fathers, their mothers, their sisters and brothers. So this time she didn\u2019t want to go away if\nhe wouldn\u2019t give the permit to them to be left. So we\u2019re talking about, we went away a little\nfrom Rozia, but this is how she perished.",
        "Q: How did you find out about Rozia\u2019s family in Russia?",
        "A: Well when I went to Russia, when I escaped to Russia, I knew that they are there. So we went\nto Lemberg, Lvov. In Lemberg everybody from each town knew about somebody else who was\nthere. So we got acquainted.",
        "Q: And later, after the war?",
        "A: After the war they were in Siberia and during the war before Germany attacked Russia they\nused to send cards to Rozia from Siberia. So we answered them a letters. Then after the\nliberation they were liberated, somehow they sent a card to Rozia to Kollupzowa and they\nwanted to find out what happened to them, if they are in this time in because they were\nreleased from the . And they wrote a letter, so I got the address. I wasn\u2019t in Kollupzowa,\nand somebody in Kollupzowa who received this card brought it to me. I was already in this\ntime in the army in Rzeszow. So they brought me the card what they wrote to Rozia. So I had\ntheir address, so I wrote them the letter. And I remember the first letter. I told them that from\nthe whole town only nine people survived and I told them who and I told them that Rozia didn\u2019t\nsurvive. And since then we were in contact with each other. When they came back from\nRussia, so they came to Poland, but in this time when they came to Poland, I was already out I\nescaped before. And we were in contact then the family went to Palestine, we were in contact.\nThe brother went to Santo Domingo, from Santo Domingo he came over here. In the beginning\nI had a business so somehow I managed to take him in the business and he lives here in\nManhattan. He got married. My wife was the matchmaker when He got married because his\nwife was a Hebrew teacher together with my wife and when he came over he couldn\u2019t stay here.\nIf he wouldn\u2019t be married to an American citizen. And because she was a Hebrew teacher, they\ngot married and this way he could stay. Now they have two daughters.",
        "Q: The rest of Rozia\u2019s family went to Israel?",
        "A: Went to Israel. The father went to Israel, he died there and the sister with her husband and her\ntwo children, so they are in Israel. They are in Tel Aviv. And this is how. It\u2019s the story.",
        "Q: I\u2019m thinking in terms of the ID cards. If you can remember something about Rozia, the story\nabout her before the war, about \u201935 to \u00b039.",
        "A: Well, from \u201935 to \u201939 the only story I can remember is that, because I was not in contact with\nher, because I couldn\u2019t speak to her, I was a Hassidic boy and we had nothing in common. I\nremember she had an uncle and the uncle used to go every Friday to the steam bath. He was an\nelderly man. This was the man who the German, he was always sitting, he could not go down\nfor cold water in the steam bath, so I was near him and every time he needed a bucket with cold\nwater, I used to bring it to him. Not so much that I liked him, but I figured this would bring me\ncloser to Rozia. Also he used to tell stories. He was a philosopher. So sometimes he caught me\nwith my friends, he used to tell is stories about philosophy. Nobody wanted to listen. I always\nwas standing there listening to him because again the same stories. But special about Rozia,\nyes, also this may be interesting. After when I came back and I was not anymore Hassidic and I\nstarted to see Rozia, we joined the Hanoar Hotzioni, this 1s a youth, Israeli Zionist organization.\nAnd I was very happy that we joined, because she joined at this time together and then later my\nsister Rachel, was the head of this group in our town and then later when I wasn\u2019t anymore\nHassidic, I took over and I became the head of this organization. And we got together and we\nsang songs, we started Hebrew and we went out on outings and then already this was one of my\nhappiest days because in this group, Rozia also belonged to the same organization until the war\nbroke out. So that\u2019s all that I can tell you about is the times that we belonged to the\norganization.",
        "Q: How long did she belong to the youth movement?",
        "A: To the youth movement she belonged from, I would say, about two years, a year and a half, two\nyears. I would say \u201938 and half \u201939. And then the war started. Then in 1939 I wanted to go to\nPalestine, but I couldn\u2019t so I made contact to go to Palestine illegal. You paid in 500 zlotys\nand they took you to Romania and from Romania, illegal on a ship to Palestine. So I remember\nwith a friend of mine I paid in the 500 zlotys to go, he didn\u2019t have the money so I remember his\nmother sold two candlesticks and some pearls for him to have the money. We sent in the money\nand we waited any day to go. We got letters and then we didn\u2019t go because the war broke out.\nAnd during all this time we made arrangements that if I would go to Palestine the first thing I\nwould see to make arrangements for Rozia to come over.",
        "Q: She wanted to go?",
        "A: She wanted to go, yes. Well this was everything quietly. I didn\u2019t tell it to my family, she didn\u2019t\ntell it to her family. But between us we made plans to go and to settle in Palestine. Also, in the\nbeginning of the war there was a German company had the ad in the paper that if somebody\nwants to go to America and if they have family, we can register and we would be able to go to\nAmerica. And this was during the war. You had to send in so much money to be registered but\nyou had to have blood relations. Yes, I had a brother, so I remember my sister Rachel,\nregistered and I registered with Rozia and I registered that we were married, because we said in\ncase this will come and it will be actual ready, so we would be married and we will go. So we\nsent in some money and later we didn\u2019t hear anything about it. So my sister, Rachel, had a\nChusen (?), so he came to America a week before the war broke out and he came and she didn\u2019t\ncome. She could come before but she waited for him. Listen, you only need half a page, but I\ndon\u2019t know what you would pick out.",
        "Q: I think that\u2019s fine and I'll call you if I have questions.",
        "A: All right, if you have it, or you can send me a copy.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: You can send me a copy by normal mail. You can send it and I will correct it or something and\nthen later I will correct it and I\u2019Il send it back.",
        "Q: Now, I just want to ask one or two more things. Maybe you can describe to me where Rozia\nlived, maybe the house she lived in.",
        "A: O.K. They lived, mostly Jews lived in the town. Mostly Jews lived around the market place\nand the market place all houses were Jewish. Only four houses in the market place, which was\nvery big, were no Jewish and all the Jews had the businesses and the rest of the Jews were not\nrich, were very poor lived around the synagogue. They were small crooked houses, old houses\nfalling down. Rozia lived I would say about half a mile or maybe a kilometer, no about a mile\nout of town on the road to go to Rzeszow. And they lived there and they had two houses. Three\nfamilies had two houses. There was a brother and two sisters. Her parents. Her mother had a\nsister and a brother and they were all in the business. In the business before the war and they\nlived in those houses. They were nice houses. It\u2019s not comparison like we have in America\nbecause there was no running water and there was no indoor plumbing. But the houses were\nnice with beautiful gardens with flowers. Now one of the sisters of her mother, her name was\nMrs. Smith, she was very particular in her garden. She always worked, with beautiful flowers\nand every time there was a concourse, it was how you say, to judge which flowers, a contest,\nher flowers were the nicest. She didn\u2019t have children so she had the flowers. So they lived\nthere, like I said. The only thing they had more than we in the town, we didn\u2019t have electricity,\nthey had electricity. The reason why is because they had electricity from the mills because they\nhad there the generators, so they had electricity for themselves. So for us it was something\nimportant because when we come we saw electricity. They had very beautiful homes, very\nnicely furnished. But for our town it was nice. But it was lacking water and indoor plumbing.",
        "Q: Was the mill fairly successful?",
        "A: It was successful, but later it fell down because in the beginning of the \u00b030\u2019s it was a fire, there\nwas a big fire in the mill and they somehow could never recuperate, they could never build\nthemselves up as it was before the fire. So it was not so big, it was a small flourmill and a small\nlumber mill, it was not big. It wasn\u2019t that they manufactured to send out for export like other\nmills, it was mostly for domestic use. Peasants needed to have flour brought over some grain\nbut it was not successful after the fire, it was not successful. But it was a very prominent family.\nThey were a little more modern than the majority people in our town. The majority people were\nvery orthodox and they were already a little more progressive, like you could see like Rozia\u2019s\nsister and brother already went to gymnasia, my sisters didn\u2019t go because my father would\nnever allow us to go on a Saturday. Rozia didn\u2019t go anymore to the gymnasia but her brothers\nwent. The reason Rozia didn\u2019t go to the gymnasia because this was after the fire and probably\nthis was quite expensive because it was a private gymnasia, private high school, and probably it\nwas too expensive for them to send Rozia to the gymnasia. So instead of the gymnasia, so after\nshe finished the she went to a seamstress to learn how to sew.",
        "Q: The seamstress worked in town or next door to her?",
        "A: Well, not far from them. There was a seamstress, she was special, a very elegant seamstress.\nShe was from Kollupzowa originally and later she moved to Vienna and she had a workshop in\nVienna.. Later she came back when Hitler started to, when Hitler came to power in Germany\nbecause her husband was Jewish. His name was Rosner. So her husband was Jewish and she\nwasn\u2019t. But anyway because when they started with all the laws in Germany and Vienna, so she\nfigured she didn\u2019t want to wait so she came back home. The woman by whom she worked. So\nsee I know all those stories, I don\u2019t know what else I can tell you.",
        "Q: I think that\u2019s good.. So they were sewing like dresses?",
        "A: Well, mostly they were sewing to order. If somebody wanted to have elegant nice dress, but\nthey didn\u2019t sew dresses to sell or something, this was only to people from the town would come.\nNot the average person because average person went to somebody who was cheaper, but\nsomebody who wanted to have a very elegant dress, a very elegant suit, women, so they came to\nher. Because her being already having already a workshop in Vienna, she was a little more\nsophisticated. And then Rozia after the war and before the war she was very capable. She did\nall her dresses herself. She was very good at it and then later when her sister left for Russia, so\nshe left all her clothing with her because they wouldn\u2019t take away, so later she fixed them over\nto fit for Rozia. And then later when she needed to eat, so she started to sell little by little what\nher sister left in the house.",
        "Q: So in the ghetto she had things from her family to sell?",
        "A: She had things from her family to sell, yes. But she was by herself, so she ate with her uncle.\nWith her uncle who didn\u2019t have no children and how they lived, they lived together. I know I\nused to travel a lot and I used to go out in the ghetto, I took off always my armband, because I\ndidn\u2019t look Jewish. So I used to go out and I used to bring in a lot of food to the ghetto. So\nevery time they needed something, so I brought it for them. This is how we went along. If the\nGermans wouldn\u2019t have a total destruction, a lot of people could survive. You see Rozia had the\nbig chance because she looked so much gentile and she spoke so good Polish. Because her\nlanguage actually was Polish. They didn\u2019t speak home Yiddish like the majority. The majority\nJews did. Like for instance, in my home we spoke Yiddish, but nevertheless my sister spoke\nPolish. I spoke a good Polish because we spoke Polish in the business, in the store with the\nnon-Polish population and my father was practically the only Jew with the long grey beard who\nspoke beautiful Polish. But the majority people in our town didn\u2019t speak good Polish. But\nRozia\u2019s family spoke only Polish.",
        "Q: Did Rozia speak Yiddish?",
        "A: Very bad. She spoke always, I remember, when she came to us and sometimes she spoke to my\nfather, so my father laughed and she always, well you speak Yiddish like a shiksa. She spoke\nvery bad. She spoke German. Everybody by us in our section spoke German because our\nsection was Galicia and this belonged to Austria until the end of the First World War. So\neverybody spoke Polish, I mean German. But Yiddish, she didn\u2019t speak. She understood, but..",
        "Q: So when you two spoke it was in Polish?",
        "A: It was in Polish, yes. And I remember even when she came to our house so my sisters, my\nmother spoke to her in Polish. And late when she came to our house when we were in the\nghetto and there were certain times that I brought over things that you couldn\u2019t get in the ghetto,\nsalami, a piece of cheese. All I remember my brother in America sent through turkey, a package\nwith chocolate, with salami with other goodies that you couldn\u2019t get in the ghetto, and I would\ndivide it for all the children. When she made little pieces, she always included Rozia. She said\nit was for her, she got also a part. I remember it was Rozia\u2019s birthday and I wanted to give her a\npresent and I there was nothing to sell in the time of the war and my sister had a beautiful\nmanicure set and she got it from her first boyfriend. It was with initials R.S. so she gave it to\nme I should give it to Rozia. My sister was Rachel Saleschutz and Rozia was Rozia Shiskin,\nand she said give it to Rozia. Then later she said to me, well maybe I shouldn\u2019t give it to you\nbecause this gift didn\u2019t work out good for her, but nevertheless she gave it to me and I gave it to\nRozia. You see, we were very close and I was the youngest in the family and if I wanted\nsomething it was all right with the family. See her family was different from my family. My\nfamily was more Hassidic, ultra, ultra orthodox and their family was modern. So this was a\nlittle bad, but later 1t didn\u2019t make no difference. It so happens that her brother, now in America,\nhe\u2019s very religious. He goes every day to shul. I don\u2019t go. I go once a year. You know, it\nchanged those things. You don\u2019t always have the same thing.",

        "Q: Let me just check this.",
        "Q: You got sick with an ear infection and you were sent to Tarnov. I wasn\u2019t sent. I was with an ear\ninfection over four weeks. Instead to take care, we didn\u2019t have nobody to take care and it got\nworse and worse until the whole pus went already to the brain and then we saw that there is no\nway. I was practically dead. So with a sled they took me out of the ghetto to , toa\nbigger town and we came to and we came to , to a doctor, there was a\nspecialist to an ear, nose and throat, Dr. Heller, and he said if I did not get an operation within\ntwo hours, three hours, I would be dead because the pus was already around my membrane,\nfrom the brain. So through, my brother went back home and finally they bribed somebody and\nwe got a pass to go on the train, because to this town we had to go to Kracow, so two sisters\nwent with me. On the train Poles wanted to throw me out from the running train. So they\ncalled the police and the police saw that we had legitimate passes, so the police said what do\nyou want, they have legitimate passes because we got the passes. So the Poles said,\nnevertheless you have to throw them out because no Jews are allowed on the train. So we\nbegged them, the police, we begged the police, we begged the police to let us stay \u2018till the next\nstation. Not to throw us out from a running train. They said I am almost dead. So the police\nsaid O.K., so we sent to the next station which was Tarnov, this was half way from us to\nKracow and they took us down, they had to carry me to some friends, because I was almost\ndead. And there was a hospital and luckily in Tarnov, there was a doctor, and his name was\nDavid Robinovitch. He used to be the head of a very famous hospital in Lodz but the name of\nthe hospital was and he was a specialist, ear, throat, nose. So when they brought me\nover to him, he said he doesn\u2019t think he can do anything to me, that it is too late because I was\nalready with this ear infection for about four or five weeks and the pain was so that people\ncannot imagine how that pained. So he said we have nothing what to lose we have to have an\noperation right away. And he took him about six hours and he operated me and he said to my\nsisters, he said I made the operation but ninety-nine percent he wouldn\u2019t wake up. And if he\nwould even wake up all his mouth would be crooked or his eyes he wouldn\u2019t see or his ears,\nbecause it was impossible because everything was already full with pus. Anyway when I woke\nup after eight days when he took off the bandages I can hear on this ear better than on the other\none. The eyes are good, the mouth is good. He was a genius that he made this operation, and\nthen a few days later, Rozia came. When she came naturally I was very happy and I was in this\ntown, in Tarnov, I was February, March, \u2018till April 20 or April 12, 1942, because until he had to\nclean. Meanwhile she was with me all the time and then she had always trouble with her\ntonsils, so she complained so the doctor said once you are here he operated, he took out her\ntonsils. Now he wanted money, but from Rozia he didn\u2019t want a penny, because from me we\nhad to pay him a lot of money for the operation and for Rozia he said he would do the operation\nwithout money. So we asked him how come. He said well when you came and you started to\ntell me stories and your sisters, so I could get money out from you. With Rozia she had nobody,\nher mother died, her father, sister and brother were in Russia, where would she have money. So\nI need people like you, they should pay me for people who cannot pay me. So I do operations\nfor free. So he operated on Rozia and took off her tonsils, she shouldn\u2019t owe us because every\nfew months he had infections in the tonsils and we came home both together.",

    "answers": [
        "A: What do you want me to tell you?",
        "A: Rozia was born in Kollupzowa in 1922. In March, well, it doesn\u2019t make a difference. I don\u2019t\nremember the date, but I know it was in March 1922. Their father had a flourmill in the lumber\nmill and they were not ultra, well, let\u2019s forget about the orthodoxy. She went to Kollupzowa to\npublic school. After public school she started to work for somebody who was a seamstress.",
        "A: She was an apprentice. She wanted not for a profession but just to know how to dress, to fix\nand all those things. This was a neighbor of them.",
        "A: She was on this time, no before the apprentice, when she was in the public school she also\nattended Basiankov (?). Basiankov is a religious school for girls and when she finished\nBasiankov, she must have been at this time about 15 years old. And then later she started to be\nan apprentice by this woman who was a neighbor of theirs and she start to learn how to sew and\nthose things.",
        "A: Yes, she had one sister which she\u2019s alive. The sister, the name was Hanka and Hanka, after she\nfinished gymnasium, means high school, she went to Krakow. Then she had a brother and after\nthe brother finished gymnasium, which was high school, he worked in a bank. That was the\nonly Jewish bank in Kollupzowa and the brother worked there.",
        "A: His name was Yanik. Now Hanka with her husband survived the war in Russia. They were\nsent away to Russia and Rozia\u2019s father and Yanik went with them together and they all survived\nin Siberia in Russia. Rozia was left.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, she started apprenticing earlier. She started in 1936 I would say. In 1936. And she with\nthis woman who had this place she was there about three years and then the war started. Rozia,\nwhen the war started, the sister Hanka, with her husband, they lived in Kracow, they came to\nKollupzowa to escape the Germans, they escaped to the East and they came to Kollupzowa so\nthe father and the brother went with them to escape to the Russian side. Hanka, the husband,\nand the brother and the father.",
        "A: Rozia\u2019s mother was left home because on this time the Jews thought the woman can be saved\nbecause nobody thought they would do anything to a woman, they thought only to the men. So\nshe remained home. Her mother didn\u2019t feel so good so they remained home. And, well, you\ndon\u2019t want to bring me in I have nothing to do with it.",
        "A: I met her when I was 13 years old, she was 11 years old, I fell in love with her, and I didn\u2019t\nspeak to her because we couldn\u2019t speak to girls. I was a Hassidic boy until I was about 17, 18\nyears, the first time I spoke to her. But I always had her in my mind and when I escaped to\nRussia she remained home and then I was in Russia for three months. Then one day somebody\ncame and told me that her mother is gravely ill and I decided to come home. They said not to\ntell it to her brother, to her father and to her sister because if you would tell it to them they were\nafraid they would come back and they didn\u2019t want they should come back to the German side,\nbecause they were on the Russian side. But the day I was told I decided to go home. I thought\nshe is alone, she is sick I will go home and I came home on a Sunday and Tuesday her mother\ndied. I saw her Sunday when I came home; she hardly recognized me, and I told her I gave her\nregards from the husband and son and the daughter and the son-in-law. Tuesday she died, she\ndied of cancer. So Rozia...",
        "A: This was already in January 1940.",
        "A: Well in January \u00b040, it was the situation was the Germans started Jews to work and to harass\nJews. But nobody knew and nobody thought that such a thing can be like extermination of the\nJews. They took Jews to work to forced labor. I was with the Germans before I escaped to\nRussia. I was with the Germans for six weeks. After when they occupied my town, then later I\nescaped to the Russian zone. But when I came back the situation settled a little. The Jews had\nto work every day or they didn\u2019t have the quota so they went from house to house and they took\nout the Jews and they had to do all kinds of work. This was in winter so mostly the Jews were\nused to clean up the roads from snow, they cleaned the streets. But we knew the Germans were\nthere but the Jews were still in their homes, they still had businesses. It was just in the\nbeginning.",
        "A: After her family left she was with her mother. Her mother was very sick so she was with her\nmother. Now when I came back and her mother died and she was left alone. She was in this\ntime 18 years old, so and uncle took care of her. Because there was a house, two houses, the\nbusiness was a family business. Like two uncles and her father, so they took her in. She was\nstill in her apartment, but she ate by them and they took care of her. Then she didn\u2019t do\nanything. By the Germans if they started to take people to work, usually Rozia was not taken to\nwork because she lived not in the town, this was in the outskirts and the Germans didn\u2019t go to\ncatch Jews to work because they were mostly like Poles and they didn\u2019t take the Poles. So they\ndidn\u2019t know if there are Jews. So she actually didn\u2019t go to work.",
        "A: Also no, because they were far away from the town. Her, only had one uncle, his name was\nKila Schmidt, he was an elderly man and he was a very, very intelligent man with a grey beard.\nHe was taken from time to time. Only when the Poles showed the Germans that there are Jews\nliving there. Because mostly they caught the Jews when it was a very concentration where the\nJews were living. So he was brought to work and they humiliated him because he was an\nelderly man. And I remember one time they put on him like a bottle on his back and he had to\ntake water and carry it in the bottle. One time they took a wagon and they harnessed him to the\nwagon instead of the horse and he had to pull the wagon and there were a few German soldiers\nwere sitting on the wagon and they used to hit him that he should go faster. He was an old man.\nSo I remember a few times when the uncle was humiliated.",
        "A: No he lived in the same house, the same place. Because they had two houses which belonged to\nthis flourmill and the lumber yard. So they lived there and they were not thrown out yet in this\ntime. And this house she lived with them and then when I came back I started to see her quite\noften, practically every day. And if she needed something I took care of it. And she lived there\nwith the family \u2018till June 1941, was established a ghetto in our town, so she was taken with the\nfamily to that ghetto. They got two rooms in a house in the ghetto and she lived with the two\nuncles, the aunts with their children in the ghetto.",
        "A: I was in the ghetto too, so when in the ghetto, there was a different system. The Germans didn\u2019t\ngo out and grab people, Jews from the houses in the streets to go to work, it was already\norganized. There was a Judenrat and the Judenrat had a list of all able-bodied Jews and they\ndivided and they sent out cards what day each Jew had to work. This way not the same Jews\nshould be called every day. So when it came to Rozia\u2019s time so she was notified and she went\nto work like other Jews went to work, cleaning houses by Germans, cleaning the streets,\nthrowing away snow in the winter. She did all kinds of work the same way.",
        "A: O,K. Then we lived like this in the ghetto and then later I was taken away from the ghetto.\nThis was in January \u201942 which was already bad because every time the situation got worse so I\nhad a mastoid, a middle ear infection, and they had to smuggle me out from the ghetto so she\nhad to go with me with my younger sister to the hospital. But the day we had to go by sled in\nthe very deep winter high snow, so she had trouble with her tonsils, she had high temperature,\nso she didn\u2019t go. But when I was in the hospital and I was operated, about two weeks later she\ncame to this town to the big town, somehow she got a pass because you couldn\u2019t travel by train,\nyou couldn\u2019t go out from the ghetto. We were in the ghetto. So she got a pass and she came to\nme to the town where I was in the hospital and I think this was the most happiest day in this\ntime that she arrived.",
        "A: So we came back from this town, from this hospital, we came back to Kollupzowa. When we\ncame back, the ghetto was all together changed, we couldn\u2019t recognize the ghetto. It was\nalready so far, the gates were closed and April 28, the Gestapo came in, they shot my father,\nthey shot this time 22 Jews, and they had a list of 22 Jews and my father was between them and\nthen later everything went down, every day was worse, there were killings and killings and\nkillings. Until June the 20\" we were chased out from our ghetto, from Kollupzowa, to a larger\nghetto, to and in ves",
        "A: All her uncles were alive, she was staying with her uncles, all her uncles were alive and when\nwe were all chased out to this larger, she went with her uncles and we were in this larger town\nfrom about June 20\" \u2018till July 7\". July 7\u201c they started Axias, means transportation from\nRzeszow to Belzec, and with this first action, this was July the 7\u201c, my family was taken and\nnaturally Rozia with her uncles were taken the same day to Belzec and she perished in Belzec.\nI don\u2019t know exactly the date, but 1t could be a day or two or three days the most after July the\n7\", But was mostly the trip to Belzec from us, took about five hours, and sometimes they had\nto wait in line because there were so many trains waiting, so they should be next exterminated.\nThis was one of the first death camps that they didn\u2019t have gas chambers, they suffocated the\npeople when they put them in hermetic closed chambers and they pumped in carbon monoxide.",
        "A: From trucks. Not so much in trucks as from Russian tanks. And then later when they choked to\ndeath which took quite a long time, it took about twenty to twenty-five minutes, they took them\nout. They didn\u2019t cremate the people in this time yet, because this was right in the beginning.\nBut they had very big ditches. Those ditches were made because this was near the\nGerman/Russian border, before 1941 when Germany attacked Russia so they had anti-tank\nditches so they filled up those ditches with people and they covered them with sand. Then later\nthey took kerosene and they burned them. So this is how she perished.",
        "A: Well when they left the ghetto they were in Rzeszow for a few weeks, not a few weeks about\ntwo weeks, no I had contact with them same as with my family but when they took them to\nBelzec we didn\u2019t know, so we hired a friendly Pole and the friendly Pole we sent him on the\nsame track that the trains went so it took him two weeks and he came back and through people\nhe found out they were taken to a place called Belzec and supposedly they were killed in\nBelzec.",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t taken because what happened is my family was taken there but when they were taken,\nso this man who was the head from the Gestapo in our town he organized a camp. If you read,\neverything is in the book. He organized a camp, a labor camp in Kollupzowa, and he brought\nback hundred young Jews and me he established in our house of prayers or synagogue. He\nestablished a camp. And the reason he brought us back is because he wanted to destroy the\nghetto, because they didn\u2019t want to leave anything that was Jewish, so we lived in the\nsynagogue and made the camp and every day went out and we destroyed house by house. And\nit\u2019s exactly the description how the destruction went on in the book. Because we had to go\ntogether to Belzec, but they took out hundred from our town and we went back and when we\nsaw we had nothing left. After a few months, and the end of November, we escaped into the\nwoods and this is how I survived. Otherwise we would be taken to Belzec the same thing as all\nthe people, because they accumulated in Rzeszow about hundred thousand Jews from all towns\nwho surround Rzeszow. Because what they want to do is they want to have the Jews in one\nplace where there 1s a railroad station. Now they told the Jews that they can take along with\nthem anything they want. So this is what they wanted, the Jews should bring over everything\nand later when they took them away to Belzec all their stuff was left in the town in the ghetto\nand the Germans had it in one place.",
        "A: In Rzeszow and they later took it to their warehouses and the things that they needed they took\naway and the rest they gave to Poles. The other thing I wanted to mention about Rozia, when\nwe saw it starting to be bad, this was before I went to the hospital. You see I had a younger\nsister, my younger sister, and she was very pretty, she was very intelligent. She spoke a few\nlanguages. She spoke English, she spoke German, she spoke Hebrew, Polish.",
        "A: Rachel. And Rachel was only three years older than I was so we tried to arrange, Rachel should\nescape because there was a man, a Polish family who were thrown out from their houses, from\ntheir town in Pozna. Pozna was a town that it was next to the German Reich. This was from\nwestern border in Poland and they came to our town and they opened a little store in our town\nin the beginning of the war, and became very friendly. And they had a son a little older than I\nwas, about five years older, and we became very friendly. So he begged my mother and Rachel,\nthey would move away from our town to a different town and they would make believe that her\nson 1s a husband of Rachel, that Rachel is a daughter-in-law, in this way she would be able to\nsurvive with them. When they told us this, we thought it\u2019s a very good idea and then I came to\nRozia and she looked Jewish whatsoever, she looked so typical Aryan. She had blue-greenish\neyes and she had gold hair and she didn\u2019t look at all Jewish. So I told her, let\u2019s make\narrangements because Rachel is going to run away with this family and you will go with them\nand we will make up somehow papers that you are a sister. We\u2019ll make false papers, it means\nthat she\u2019s married to this Pole and you will go away with them. We talked and talked and she\nsomehow was afraid. She said, I cannot take a chance. I am afraid. I do not have guts to do it.\nShe said, my sister Rachel could do it because you are so capable, she admired Rachel, and you\ncan do it. So Rachel didn\u2019t want to go because she didn\u2019t want to leave the family. And Rozia\nwas afraid, she was afraid. Maybe if she wouldn\u2019t be afraid maybe Rachel would somehow\nleave the family and go. Well, once we told them this, my sister Rachel had another chance to\nbe saved. When the ghetto was established, they brought into our town Arbeits Amt. Arbeits\nAmt means a German labor office to register all the working people and the head of it was a\nGerman, and they needed somebody to be his secretary who spoke fluently German and could\nwrite German. My sister spoke beautiful German. So the Judenrat assigned my sister to be his\nsecretary, and she worked with him. They became very friendly. He liked her very much. She\nwas a very nice person, and when the Jews were chased out of our ghetto to Rzeszow, naturally\nthis Arbeits Ant didn\u2019t exist any more. So in Rzeszow, in the ghetto, somehow on the street he\nmet my sister, he was very happy, he said, you know what I am transferred from Rzeszow and I\nam now the head of the Arbeits Amt in Rzeszow and I need a secretary. Why don\u2019t you become\nagain my secretary and I will give you a permit to stay here and you will not be taken away. So\nshe said she would remain if he will give a pass to my other sisters and to my mother. My\nfather was already shot. He said well I can only save you not the other ones. So she didn\u2019t\nwant. So sometimes the closeness of the family, the attachment to the family sometimes it was\na curse for the Jews. Because a lot f Jews could be saved, they could save themselves to run\naway, or do something, but they wouldn\u2019t do it because they didn\u2019t want to leave their families,\ntheir fathers, their mothers, their sisters and brothers. So this time she didn\u2019t want to go away if\nhe wouldn\u2019t give the permit to them to be left. So we\u2019re talking about, we went away a little\nfrom Rozia, but this is how she perished.",
        "A: Well when I went to Russia, when I escaped to Russia, I knew that they are there. So we went\nto Lemberg, Lvov. In Lemberg everybody from each town knew about somebody else who was\nthere. So we got acquainted.",
        "A: After the war they were in Siberia and during the war before Germany attacked Russia they\nused to send cards to Rozia from Siberia. So we answered them a letters. Then after the\nliberation they were liberated, somehow they sent a card to Rozia to Kollupzowa and they\nwanted to find out what happened to them, if they are in this time in because they were\nreleased from the . And they wrote a letter, so I got the address. I wasn\u2019t in Kollupzowa,\nand somebody in Kollupzowa who received this card brought it to me. I was already in this\ntime in the army in Rzeszow. So they brought me the card what they wrote to Rozia. So I had\ntheir address, so I wrote them the letter. And I remember the first letter. I told them that from\nthe whole town only nine people survived and I told them who and I told them that Rozia didn\u2019t\nsurvive. And since then we were in contact with each other. When they came back from\nRussia, so they came to Poland, but in this time when they came to Poland, I was already out I\nescaped before. And we were in contact then the family went to Palestine, we were in contact.\nThe brother went to Santo Domingo, from Santo Domingo he came over here. In the beginning\nI had a business so somehow I managed to take him in the business and he lives here in\nManhattan. He got married. My wife was the matchmaker when He got married because his\nwife was a Hebrew teacher together with my wife and when he came over he couldn\u2019t stay here.\nIf he wouldn\u2019t be married to an American citizen. And because she was a Hebrew teacher, they\ngot married and this way he could stay. Now they have two daughters.",
        "A: Went to Israel. The father went to Israel, he died there and the sister with her husband and her\ntwo children, so they are in Israel. They are in Tel Aviv. And this is how. It\u2019s the story.",
        "A: Well, from \u201935 to \u201939 the only story I can remember is that, because I was not in contact with\nher, because I couldn\u2019t speak to her, I was a Hassidic boy and we had nothing in common. I\nremember she had an uncle and the uncle used to go every Friday to the steam bath. He was an\nelderly man. This was the man who the German, he was always sitting, he could not go down\nfor cold water in the steam bath, so I was near him and every time he needed a bucket with cold\nwater, I used to bring it to him. Not so much that I liked him, but I figured this would bring me\ncloser to Rozia. Also he used to tell stories. He was a philosopher. So sometimes he caught me\nwith my friends, he used to tell is stories about philosophy. Nobody wanted to listen. I always\nwas standing there listening to him because again the same stories. But special about Rozia,\nyes, also this may be interesting. After when I came back and I was not anymore Hassidic and I\nstarted to see Rozia, we joined the Hanoar Hotzioni, this 1s a youth, Israeli Zionist organization.\nAnd I was very happy that we joined, because she joined at this time together and then later my\nsister Rachel, was the head of this group in our town and then later when I wasn\u2019t anymore\nHassidic, I took over and I became the head of this organization. And we got together and we\nsang songs, we started Hebrew and we went out on outings and then already this was one of my\nhappiest days because in this group, Rozia also belonged to the same organization until the war\nbroke out. So that\u2019s all that I can tell you about is the times that we belonged to the\norganization.",
        "A: To the youth movement she belonged from, I would say, about two years, a year and a half, two\nyears. I would say \u201938 and half \u201939. And then the war started. Then in 1939 I wanted to go to\nPalestine, but I couldn\u2019t so I made contact to go to Palestine illegal. You paid in 500 zlotys\nand they took you to Romania and from Romania, illegal on a ship to Palestine. So I remember\nwith a friend of mine I paid in the 500 zlotys to go, he didn\u2019t have the money so I remember his\nmother sold two candlesticks and some pearls for him to have the money. We sent in the money\nand we waited any day to go. We got letters and then we didn\u2019t go because the war broke out.\nAnd during all this time we made arrangements that if I would go to Palestine the first thing I\nwould see to make arrangements for Rozia to come over.",
        "A: She wanted to go, yes. Well this was everything quietly. I didn\u2019t tell it to my family, she didn\u2019t\ntell it to her family. But between us we made plans to go and to settle in Palestine. Also, in the\nbeginning of the war there was a German company had the ad in the paper that if somebody\nwants to go to America and if they have family, we can register and we would be able to go to\nAmerica. And this was during the war. You had to send in so much money to be registered but\nyou had to have blood relations. Yes, I had a brother, so I remember my sister Rachel,\nregistered and I registered with Rozia and I registered that we were married, because we said in\ncase this will come and it will be actual ready, so we would be married and we will go. So we\nsent in some money and later we didn\u2019t hear anything about it. So my sister, Rachel, had a\nChusen (?), so he came to America a week before the war broke out and he came and she didn\u2019t\ncome. She could come before but she waited for him. Listen, you only need half a page, but I\ndon\u2019t know what you would pick out.",
        "A: All right, if you have it, or you can send me a copy.",
        "A: You can send me a copy by normal mail. You can send it and I will correct it or something and\nthen later I will correct it and I\u2019Il send it back.",
        "A: O.K. They lived, mostly Jews lived in the town. Mostly Jews lived around the market place\nand the market place all houses were Jewish. Only four houses in the market place, which was\nvery big, were no Jewish and all the Jews had the businesses and the rest of the Jews were not\nrich, were very poor lived around the synagogue. They were small crooked houses, old houses\nfalling down. Rozia lived I would say about half a mile or maybe a kilometer, no about a mile\nout of town on the road to go to Rzeszow. And they lived there and they had two houses. Three\nfamilies had two houses. There was a brother and two sisters. Her parents. Her mother had a\nsister and a brother and they were all in the business. In the business before the war and they\nlived in those houses. They were nice houses. It\u2019s not comparison like we have in America\nbecause there was no running water and there was no indoor plumbing. But the houses were\nnice with beautiful gardens with flowers. Now one of the sisters of her mother, her name was\nMrs. Smith, she was very particular in her garden. She always worked, with beautiful flowers\nand every time there was a concourse, it was how you say, to judge which flowers, a contest,\nher flowers were the nicest. She didn\u2019t have children so she had the flowers. So they lived\nthere, like I said. The only thing they had more than we in the town, we didn\u2019t have electricity,\nthey had electricity. The reason why is because they had electricity from the mills because they\nhad there the generators, so they had electricity for themselves. So for us it was something\nimportant because when we come we saw electricity. They had very beautiful homes, very\nnicely furnished. But for our town it was nice. But it was lacking water and indoor plumbing.",
        "A: It was successful, but later it fell down because in the beginning of the \u00b030\u2019s it was a fire, there\nwas a big fire in the mill and they somehow could never recuperate, they could never build\nthemselves up as it was before the fire. So it was not so big, it was a small flourmill and a small\nlumber mill, it was not big. It wasn\u2019t that they manufactured to send out for export like other\nmills, it was mostly for domestic use. Peasants needed to have flour brought over some grain\nbut it was not successful after the fire, it was not successful. But it was a very prominent family.\nThey were a little more modern than the majority people in our town. The majority people were\nvery orthodox and they were already a little more progressive, like you could see like Rozia\u2019s\nsister and brother already went to gymnasia, my sisters didn\u2019t go because my father would\nnever allow us to go on a Saturday. Rozia didn\u2019t go anymore to the gymnasia but her brothers\nwent. The reason Rozia didn\u2019t go to the gymnasia because this was after the fire and probably\nthis was quite expensive because it was a private gymnasia, private high school, and probably it\nwas too expensive for them to send Rozia to the gymnasia. So instead of the gymnasia, so after\nshe finished the she went to a seamstress to learn how to sew.",
        "A: Well, not far from them. There was a seamstress, she was special, a very elegant seamstress.\nShe was from Kollupzowa originally and later she moved to Vienna and she had a workshop in\nVienna.. Later she came back when Hitler started to, when Hitler came to power in Germany\nbecause her husband was Jewish. His name was Rosner. So her husband was Jewish and she\nwasn\u2019t. But anyway because when they started with all the laws in Germany and Vienna, so she\nfigured she didn\u2019t want to wait so she came back home. The woman by whom she worked. So\nsee I know all those stories, I don\u2019t know what else I can tell you.",
        "A: Well, mostly they were sewing to order. If somebody wanted to have elegant nice dress, but\nthey didn\u2019t sew dresses to sell or something, this was only to people from the town would come.\nNot the average person because average person went to somebody who was cheaper, but\nsomebody who wanted to have a very elegant dress, a very elegant suit, women, so they came to\nher. Because her being already having already a workshop in Vienna, she was a little more\nsophisticated. And then Rozia after the war and before the war she was very capable. She did\nall her dresses herself. She was very good at it and then later when her sister left for Russia, so\nshe left all her clothing with her because they wouldn\u2019t take away, so later she fixed them over\nto fit for Rozia. And then later when she needed to eat, so she started to sell little by little what\nher sister left in the house.",
        "A: She had things from her family to sell, yes. But she was by herself, so she ate with her uncle.\nWith her uncle who didn\u2019t have no children and how they lived, they lived together. I know I\nused to travel a lot and I used to go out in the ghetto, I took off always my armband, because I\ndidn\u2019t look Jewish. So I used to go out and I used to bring in a lot of food to the ghetto. So\nevery time they needed something, so I brought it for them. This is how we went along. If the\nGermans wouldn\u2019t have a total destruction, a lot of people could survive. You see Rozia had the\nbig chance because she looked so much gentile and she spoke so good Polish. Because her\nlanguage actually was Polish. They didn\u2019t speak home Yiddish like the majority. The majority\nJews did. Like for instance, in my home we spoke Yiddish, but nevertheless my sister spoke\nPolish. I spoke a good Polish because we spoke Polish in the business, in the store with the\nnon-Polish population and my father was practically the only Jew with the long grey beard who\nspoke beautiful Polish. But the majority people in our town didn\u2019t speak good Polish. But\nRozia\u2019s family spoke only Polish.",
        "A: Very bad. She spoke always, I remember, when she came to us and sometimes she spoke to my\nfather, so my father laughed and she always, well you speak Yiddish like a shiksa. She spoke\nvery bad. She spoke German. Everybody by us in our section spoke German because our\nsection was Galicia and this belonged to Austria until the end of the First World War. So\neverybody spoke Polish, I mean German. But Yiddish, she didn\u2019t speak. She understood, but..",
        "A: It was in Polish, yes. And I remember even when she came to our house so my sisters, my\nmother spoke to her in Polish. And late when she came to our house when we were in the\nghetto and there were certain times that I brought over things that you couldn\u2019t get in the ghetto,\nsalami, a piece of cheese. All I remember my brother in America sent through turkey, a package\nwith chocolate, with salami with other goodies that you couldn\u2019t get in the ghetto, and I would\ndivide it for all the children. When she made little pieces, she always included Rozia. She said\nit was for her, she got also a part. I remember it was Rozia\u2019s birthday and I wanted to give her a\npresent and I there was nothing to sell in the time of the war and my sister had a beautiful\nmanicure set and she got it from her first boyfriend. It was with initials R.S. so she gave it to\nme I should give it to Rozia. My sister was Rachel Saleschutz and Rozia was Rozia Shiskin,\nand she said give it to Rozia. Then later she said to me, well maybe I shouldn\u2019t give it to you\nbecause this gift didn\u2019t work out good for her, but nevertheless she gave it to me and I gave it to\nRozia. You see, we were very close and I was the youngest in the family and if I wanted\nsomething it was all right with the family. See her family was different from my family. My\nfamily was more Hassidic, ultra, ultra orthodox and their family was modern. So this was a\nlittle bad, but later 1t didn\u2019t make no difference. It so happens that her brother, now in America,\nhe\u2019s very religious. He goes every day to shul. I don\u2019t go. I go once a year. You know, it\nchanged those things. You don\u2019t always have the same thing.\n"
