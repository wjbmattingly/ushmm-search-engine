        "Question: The lights are on so it should be working. This 1s the United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum interview with?",
        "Answer: Paul Wolff.",
        "Q: Conducted by Alda Velatis (ph) on the 16th of October 2010 at the Kindertransport\nAssociation Conference in Arlington, VirginiA: Let's begin.",
        "Q: I'd like to first start off by asking you to state, again, your full name, if it's different\nnow than your name of birth, date of birth, parents' names, siblings, family, place, all of\nthat.",
        "A: All?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Okay. My name is Paul Mark John Wolff. For some strange reason or other my\nparents gave me the name of three saints.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I have no idea why that is. I was born Hamburg, Germany on the 27th of December\n1929. My father and mother are deceased. My father was Carl Wolff or referred to in\nthis country as Charles Wolff. My mother was Erica Wolff, born Abeles. The maiden\nname was Abeles, Abeles. My -- I have two -- two sisters; Susan Barbara Wolff\nliving today still in New York, and Eva Berta Wolff who died of -- of multiple sclerosis\nin San Francisco many years ago. My sister in New York's name is Fogelstein, by the\nway. It's not Wolff anymore. She's married to Henry Fogelstein. My\nsister in San Francisco was Hertzfeld. Both married, incidentally. We were just talking\nabout that in the conference. Somehow there 1s a connection of survivors. They both\nmarried survivors. What else can I tell you? My children, do you want that too?",
        "Q: That be great. Sure.",
        "A: Okay. I have three children, all of which are, I think, are registered as K2s. Karen\nWolff Kirschenbaum in New York, the oldest; Linda Wolff Dorjee, married a fellow\nfrom Boughton and therefore the name Dorjee; and my son, Charles Wolff, in Berkley --\nin Berkley. I was going to -- oh, interesting aside. Interesting aside that all three just\nrecently in the last couple months became German citizens. Germany has offered\nHolocaust -- children of Holocaust survivors citizenship if they want. Sort of -- it was\nvery weird for me to have them become German citizens, but they did it for specific\nreasons. They thought if -- if education gets too expensive in this country -- they all\nhave country -- that they want to be members of the European union in order to be able\nto attend any university within Europe --",
        "Q: Great ideA:",
        "A: -- which 1s -- you know, they have no intention of going to Germany but this is an\nopen door to the EU --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- which makes sense, really.",
        "Q: Wonderful. That's a really good ideA: Great.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Let's talk, if you will, about your earliest memories in Hamburg.",
        "A: Okay. I lived in Hamburg for the first nine years of my life. I clearly remember a\nfew things about school. I can remember being stoned, finally, on the way home from\nschool one day by children that I played with just the previous week. They were,\nobviously, put up to this by their parents, but that was sort of our -- my message to me\nand to my sisters to not return to school. So that was my end of my schooling in\nGermany. I was nine years old. I was, I remember, being angry at my father for not\nallowing me to join the Hitler youth, which you got to go on outings, camping trips, and\nhikes and like the Boy Scouts.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But of course as a Jew they wouldn't have taken me anyway. But I really didn't\nunderstand too much of that at that time. It didn't become really obvious to me as a nine\nyear old until Kristanant (ph) when I can clearly remember them, the Gestapo, knocking\nat the gates of our house in Hamburg to arrest my father as it was common on the night\nof November 9th, 1938 to arrest all male Jews above 13 or 14 years old. I was too\nyoung, but they were after my father. My father knew he would be arrested, but wanted\nto go together with his brother-in-law. So he went over to his brother-in-law's house\nand thought they would be arrested together. My mother greeted them at the door as\nthey came in, in her housecoat. It was about Midnight, full of -- the housecoat, I\nremember, was full of my -- the metals that my father had earned fighting for the\nGermans in the first world war. He was a much decorated major in the artillery, in the\nmounted artillery, actually, and was heavily wounded. And she thought somehow that\nthat would exclude him from being arrested, but of course it didn't. They didn't really --\nweren't interested in the metals. And they wanted to know where he was and they went\nand got him. Luckily enough, he was released about a week later, because one of the\narresting officers actually had fought under him in the first world war and knew him\npersonally from that. And many people were kept for months some were never\nreleased. But that finally opened his eyes that, gee, maybe we should really do\nsomething, try to get out of here. He has two brothers, incidentally, who are married\nand had families. One went three years earlier to France and one went two years earlier\nto London. But my father -- I discussed this with him many times -- thought like so\nmany German Jews that this guy -- this upstar Hitler would blow over. It's a passing\nthing. We've just got to tough it out. Things will get back to normal again. And a lot of\n-- alot of Jews, German Jews, felt almost more German than Jewish in that respect.\nYou've probably heard that before. So he made -- he made moves to -- after Gustalac --\nopened his eyes and he made moves to try to get out. We had a very distant uncle in\nNew York. You had to have -- America had no Open Door Policy and you had to have\nsomebody vouch for you over here that you would not become a burden to the States or\n-- to the state or go on the welfare rolls.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So we finally did get an exit visa to England. And we -- and on April 20th -- I\nremember April 20th, 1939, happened to be a -- that's the date of Hitler's birthday. We\nleft for England. Stayed two months -- two months in England waiting for some kind of\ntransportation to the States. We only had a transit visa in England so it wasn't -- wasn't\na -- couldn't be a final destination. He stayed -- my father and mother stayed with his\nbrother in London. I was -- there wasn't enough room, so I was put on a farm\nsomewhere in Devonshire where I remember being very, very lonely. Couldn't speak a\nword of language -- couldn't speak a word of English at the time. Had to point to food\nand things like that and had to -- never really lived on a farm before.\nMy sisters, incidentally, went on the Kindertransport a few months before we left; about\nsix months before. They both were adopted by British families and they were on the\nKindertransport. Both sisters. Okay. Then we finally got the -- on the SS Dinzeldike\n(ph) Dutch freighter with -- had room for 30 passengers going from London to San\nFrancisco through the Panama Canal. Thirty days on the ocean. Very exciting for a boy\nof 9.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Get lost on the ship and go to places where you're not allowed. And -- and I\nremember it as a very exciting -- exciting voyage, except we were told we were going to\nSan Francisco and the only thing I ever heard about San Francisco was the earthquake of\n1906. So I figured, well, probably going to live in a cardboard shack there because they\ncan't have any permanent houses. It must be all black lava sand. I had this weird idea\nof what a -- what an earthquake country would be like --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- until the day we sailed under the Golden Gate Bridge.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, and then of course, it was -- it was quite -- quite different. But it was a\nvery weird expectation of where we would go. At this time, my father was the only one\nof our family of five that spoke English. He had been to England as a young man. And\nmy sisters had picked up a little in their couple of -- in their six months in England. I\nspoke practically none at all, because during my time in England I wasn't there long\nenough to go to any kind of school. Schooling or anything. So basically I grew up in\nSan Francisco. And we arrived during summer, so by the time school started, I pick up\na lot of English on the streets already. For a nine year old it's very quick. I was\nsupposed to be, by my age, in fifth grade. So they put me in fourth grade because I\ndidn't speak enough English. And then they let me jump from fourth to sixth later on to\ncatch on with my -- to catch up with my age group. But, what else can I tell you?",
        "Q: Well -- so, this is wonderful, because, you know, it gives an overview --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- of the time. So if it's okay, if we just go back then and then maybe highlight some\nof the moments, you know, and talk --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: -- about any -- any other memories --",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",
        "Q: -- related to that. So, again, in Hamburg and then before the stoning incident, had\nyou experienced anything else, had you seen anything else? What was going on?",
        "A: Okay. Well, this reminds me of, as you know, Germany has a policy of inviting\nHolocaust survivors back to their original birth city. Right?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: So several years ago -- that's been about eight or nine years ago now -- we were both\ninvited back; my wife to Berlin and I was invited to Hamburg. And they show you the -\n- the city. But during that time while I was in Hamburg at the hotel, someone from the\narchives, much like you, came by to interview -- have a personal interview, get the story\nof each one.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Okay. So I did that interview. And then several years later I was called by a movie\nproducer in Germany, Nina Koshofer -- who was Nina Koshofer, who was in the\nprocess of doing a very, very ambitious project of a documentary on the Jews sponsored\nby German television and French televisions stations. That's called -- do you speak\nGerman at all?",
        "Q: I don't speak German. No.",
        "A: It's called -- in English it's The Jews, History Of A People. In German it's (speaks in\nGerman). And it was running for -- it's a five-hour documentary. It was running for\nfive consecutive days on television, an hour each. It was sort of -- it ended up sort of a\nlittle bit like Roots was in this country, which was the history of black slavery.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Here you may have seen it.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Which also ran about four or five days in a row. And it was a very thorough\ndocumentary. She spent three and a half years traveling to Israel, Lithuania, France,\nGermany, everywhere to film this thing. So she had some good funding from these\ntelevision stations. And believe it or not, she brought her whole -- whole camera crew\nover to San Luis Obispo, California and filmed us, and filmed the Shabbat, the evening\nmeal which we had to stage on a Sunday night, instead of Friday, because she happened\nto be here on Sunday --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- you know. And did quite an extensive interview. So this -- this documentary ran.\n[have a DVD of tt.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: It ran both in Europe and it has not run on PBS yet but it's scheduled. It's scheduled\nto run on PBS.",
        "Q: Wonderful.",
        "A: So it really starts sort of with Moses and ends with our family in San Luis Obispo.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: So it's really long. It's interesting. But she -- the reason I was picked for this is\nbecause of this interview that I did in Hamburg. She ran -- she read through all these\narchives, all these interviews --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and said, I need somebody who has been kicked out of Germany who was a hero in\nthe first world war. They really wanted to interview my father, but because he wasn't\nalive anymore, so they settled with me. And one of the -- one of the episodes of my life\nthat they -- they staged in this film with somebody portraying the young kid -- nine year\nold kid portraying me, which might be interesting here, was because -- you asked me to\ngo back to remember things. I remembered very clearly the Gestapo coming in and\nsurveying all our belongings, which they did. I still have a list of -- a very, very detailed\nlist. So many handkerchiefs, so much linen, so many knives, forks, and spoons; all the\ninventory. Most of which was confiscated. Ones -- we were allowed to take one knife,\nfork, and spoon per person. For a family of five we could take five things with us. And\nanything of value that they wanted too, any ornamentation that we had around.\nAnd we had a large vase, vase, a carved glass vase with a gold rim on the top. And I\nnoticed they were going through getting anything -- any metals of any value, silver or\ngold, or anything that they were confiscating. So while they were rummaging through\nthe house -- I was watching this -- I took this vase and held it under the kitchen faucet\nunder hot water and wanted to see if the rim would come off. And tapped it, and believe\nit or not, the rim came right off. So they took the rim and they left us the vase. We still\nhave the vase 1n our living room at home now. They were only interested in the --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- in the metal part. Not the vase. It's a large carved glass vase. I thought it was\nquite handsome. Anyway, that part they staged in this -- in this little film, the history of\nthe Jews there, and -- and a lot of my father's exploits in the first world war as a major.\nI'm not sure what else I can tell you except the thought of this has never -- the thought of\nour background is somehow never very far from -- from my -- I've been a Professor of\nArchitecture at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and I've concentrated on minority populations.\nI guess -- I'm guess it's related to the background of minorities. And we do talk to high\nschool groups and college groups and various groups in -- in CaliforniA: I would like to\ndo that. I haven't done that yet in Germany.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It would be interesting to do that in Germany. Go ahead. Now ask me something\nelse.",
        "Q: No, no. That's wonderful. Thanks for sharing. If it's okay, can we talk about your\nsisters and the family's decision, you know, the process of making the decision, what\nhappened, how it happened, to get on the Kindertransport?",
        "A: Yeah. I've never quite figured out. And you know, it's -- it's interesting that after\nyour parents die you think of all the millions of questions that you wish you would have\nasked them, which of course, they are not ask-able anymore. But I was relatively frail,\nunderweight and very skinny. And for some reason or another, my parents decided to\nkeep me with them and put them on the Kindertransport rather. Maybe they felt I was\ntoo young. My wife was six months younger than I am when she was put on the\nKindertransport by her mother, you know. It's also very, very hard for me to conceive,\nas a parent, to conceive of what you must feel like to give your child up into the\nunknown, because you generally prefer the devil that you know that may be existing\nwith you than the devil that you don't know and you have no idea what you're giving\nyour child to this... In the -- in the film, what is it? The -- \"Into The Arms of Strangers\"\nthere is this one very emotional scene where a father just simply pitches his baby\nthrough the train window and a teenager catches the baby and saved its life.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But for a parent to give up a child into the unknown like that is very difficult.\nBut anyway, my sisters both went out, I think about four months before we did.\nActually, on separate Kindertransports. And my oldest sister, Susan, stayed with my --\nstayed with my father's brother. My younger sister Eva was adopted by a Jewish cab\ndriver in London with whom she corresponded with for many years after she came back\nhere, and was treated very well. Some of the children had much worse experience, as\nyou probably heard. Some were taken advantage of, some were used as domestic\nservants. But my wife's -- my wife was adopted by a Quaker family and grew up as a\nQuaker and also was treated very well. A lot of Quakers came forward to adopt\nchildren. Okay. My sister in New York, for example, I've tried to get her into the\nKindertransport organization or such. Well, she's listed in it, but she really is a denier.\nShe never would want to step foot on Germany. She would never -- she hasn't told her\nkids much about this. She doesn't -- she really -- and she's -- she was the oldest. She\nwas actually -- I was -- yeah. She was 16 at the time, so she would have a better\nmemory than anything and she's forgotten everything. She's forgotten everything. She's\nremembers nothing about the voyage, the trip, or anything.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, it's very interesting.\nMy wife just recently published a book about her experience. Shedding Skins. I don't\nknow if she mentioned to you, but she had -- she worked very closely with a Jewish\neditor in our -- in our city that proofread the book and would give her pointers on it.\nAnd shortly after that -- her publication -- this editor died. And we went to the funeral\nservice and learned through the editor's daughter that she was also a \"Kind\" and she\nnever mentioned it.",
        "Q: Really.",
        "A: She never mentioned it at all. And you know, they worked together for a couple of\nyears. And my wife was just blown away that somebody would just totally --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- you know, deny that.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Okay. What else?",
        "Q: Is everything okay?",
        "A: No. I wanted to show you something.",
        "Q: Okay. Great.",
        "A: But -- well, go ahead. You have some more questions probably.",
        "Q: Sure. Absolutely. So maybe we can talk a little bit about your time in England,\nabout adjusting a little bit to life there. Any friends, any --",
        "A: No. I wasn't -- I was there two months. I was living on a farm. I thought I had been\nabandoned, sort of thing, because I -- I couldn't speak the language, and I was -- I\nremember being very, very lonely. And not speak -- and people didn't speak any\nGerman. I have no idea how this family was ever picked. But finally, when we met at\nthe dockside that was my first reunion with my sisters also where -- in England so that\nwe all -- we all finally did get on the boat together. But otherwise, I -- I remember\nrelatively little, little of that ttme in England. I remember in San Francisco also nearly\nbeing kicked out of school because I got in a fight with a guy that called me a dirty Jew.\nTeacher sort of picked us up by our scruffs of our necks and was going to kick us out.\nBut I realized that -- that you know, the prejudice wasn't just limited to Germany. Why\nwould -- it happened here too. I am the keeper of our family passports so I still have my\n-- my Nazi passport. We were all given the middle name of Israel, as you probably\nknow. I had hair once too.",
        "Q: Just so that -- your posterity's sake, I am being shown a passport. People listening\nwouldn't be able to see it. Oh. And here's your photo. Wonderful --",
        "A: Yeah. Actually --",
        "Q: -- that you have it.",
        "A: -- all except Susan's photo. I have even my parents' Nazi passports. When we went\nto Germany and -- recently --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- you have to show you passport as you enter the country. I showed them my -- my\nNazi passport.",
        "Q: You did.",
        "A: And the guy did not have much of a sense of humor. He said, \"You know, sir, I can\nhave you arrested. I have to confiscate this because it has a swastika on it. Any\ndocuments with a swastika on it are illegal in Germany.\"",
        "Q: Right. Right.",
        "A: \"And so you could be arrested. And this can be confiscated.\" I said, \"Okay. Forget\nit. Here's my American passport.\"",
        "Q: Right. Right. Thank you for showing those to me.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: And thanks for, you know --",
        "A: I don't know what else.",
        "Q: We can talk about other -- you know what? Maybe about your parents, if you\nwanted to talk about them.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That would be wonderful.",
        "A: Yes. Okay. My father was a -- started a coffee firm in Hamburg, importing coffee\nand processing it from Guatemala, so that's all he really knew was coffee. So when we\ncame to this country he started peddling coffee house -- until he found a firm here, he\nstarted peddling coffee house to house, selling coffee by the pound from house to house,\nby foot, because he never learned to drive in Germany. He had a chauffeur. Over here\nhe just never learned to drive, even all the years he was here. But after about, oh, I'd say\nsix months approximately of peddling coffee he realized he could not support a family\nof five by selling coffee, and yet that was about the extent of what he knew. So he\nfound a job on the San Francisco waterfront and became a stevedore. And for the first\ntime in his life really did -- did physical eight to five. He was a union member and\nworking on the waterfront. And told me, I remember, that in many ways he preferred\nthat because at 5:00 he could no longer -- he would no longer have to worry about his --\nhis business. He was -- his time was his own. He worked strictly from eight to five. It\nwas tough physical work, but he was free of any -- any kind of other concerns and\nobligations. And my mother started being a saleswoman in a department store. No.\nShe started -- first of all, she started cleaning people's houses. She was a domestic\nhouse cleaner cleaning people's house for many years and then she became a sales clerk\nin a department store. And so we all -- we had pitched in. We all had some kind of\njobs. There was a Jewish Council of 1933 which helped us get an apartment in San\nFrancisco. It helps you get settled a little bit. I still spoke, always, German when I\ncame home, and English in school. So my sisters also had jobs. I started sweeping out -\n- [remember my first job sweeping out a plumbing store and a grocery store for eleven\ncents an hour. I remember that. When I finally figured out how much I was making an\nhour, I quit and got the job at 20 cents an hour somewhere else. But that was -- yeah,\nthat was in San Francisco. So I never really had a much -- through junior high and high\nschool, I never had any much social life at all because I had a job after school almost all\nthe time. So we all sort of -- we all sort of pitched in. I was the only one of the -- I was\nthe only one in my family fortunate enough to go to a university. I went to U C Berkley\nand studied architecture. And got drafted into the U.S. Army during the Korean War,\nwhich was -- they sent me to Germany, which was a good place to be during the Korean\nWar. And it was very interesting for me, because I would -- this was 1955, ten years\nafter the end of the war. And I could very easily put on civies and go into a bar and sit\ndown and have a beer and listen to everybody refighting the Second World War which\nwas fascinating for me, you know. And an awful lot of denial going on. Hitler, who\nwas he? And you know -- sort of thing. Or I -- I was not a Nazi. And I always would\nask what time -- what point they joined the Nazi party, because if they joined 1n the late\n-- in the -- '44, early '45, '43, then they probably weren't convinced Nazis because by\nthat time they had to join 1n order to survive. But those who joined in the early forties,\nand even the late thirties were pretty -- pretty convinced of that, you know. So anti-\nsemitism was not that -- I had no desire to -- to live there. I was glad, glad to be part of\nthe US Army. That was --",
        "Q: (Inaudible).",
        "A: Yeah. It was very interesting. In fact, I was there during the time when the Germans\nwere being asked by NATO to rearm and develop their own Army. And I was a\ncorporal. And we had -- we started getting orders that when we meet German officers\nwe were to salute. I could never bring myself to do that. So I'd go down the street and a\nGerman officer would start approaching me. And of course, the -- the lower rank is\nsupposed to salute first.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the upper rank then returns the salute, but with me it was -- I was -- I teased\nthem to call me, but they never really did. But I would never, never salute. Finally,\nwhen the officer gets up to me, he salutes --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- you know, and then I would return the salute. Or I would not -- no. Actually, I did\nnot return the salute. But as far as expecting to be called out on this, and never did.\nNever did. They probably suspected, oh, this guy's Jewish. He's not going to salute me.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And it was interesting at that time. I did a little research on my own and found out\nthat in schools nothing was -- at that time, nothing was being taught at all about the Nazi\nerA: They did -- they do now. They have picked it up a lot, but at that time, ten years\nafter the war it was just total denial.",
        "Q: Right. Right. Great.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: If you'd like, we can definitely keep talking and I could probably you know keep you\nhere for hours.",
        "A: Well, no. You might want to check out this -- this video.",
        "Q: Absolutely.",
        "A: This -- that is very interesting. And I think the Holocaust -- you guys either would\nhave one -- have it already. I don't know how you -- if you research other -- what other\ncountries do.",
        "Q: Yes. Yes. We absolutely do.",
        "A: Or I have some extra copies. I can send you one.",
        "Q: We will -- I will definitely talk to somebody about that.",
        "A: It's available in English now and in German, and I think in French too --",
        "Q: Wonderful.",
        "A: -- now. So it's a -- it's a good thing to have. Yeah.",
        "Q: And maybe if we could talk about your children. And you talked to them about -- I\nmean, obviously, you're the keeper of family histories and --",
        "A: Yeah. We're trying not do the same mistake that I did with my parents by not asking\nenough questions. And now as our children are -- are getting older, you know, they're\nwhat, 46, 44, and 42, so they're -- and they have children of their own.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So particularly my son is very, very -- I took -- I took him along when we were\ninvited to Germany. Did I -- Oh. I'm sorry.",
        "Q: -- really quick. No. Actually, we can just...",
        "A: Put this back on me.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, that's -- get my handkerchief out. I undid that.",
        "Q: Put it on a little tighter. Great. Okay.",
        "A: What do you want -- you want me to repeat something?",
        "Q: Just, if we could just go back a little bit about --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: You were speaking about your son.",
        "A: Okay. My son is probably the most, I'd say the most Jewish of the three of us -- three\nof my children. And we took him with us to Germany for this visit to Hamburg and\nBerlin. And he's also a member of Kin 2. He did a stint in Israel. He speaks fluent\nHebrew. He joined the Israeli defense forces for a short time to free -- to free natives for\nfighting -- for fighting. They train foreigners to be sort of domestic part of the IDF. He\nteaches Spanish in Berkley. Interestingly enough, it's part of, I think, our effect on our\nchildren that they have all gone into professions, non-entrepreneurial professions, but\nthey are more -- much more interested in working with and helping people.\nMy daughter is a physical therapist. My other daughter in New York works for the\nInnocence Project with Berry Scheck. She's a lawyer by training. Works with the\nInnocence Project. And Charles teaches Spanish. And I've been teaching, primarily\ntrying to sensitize architects, architecture students to designing for disabilities, working\nwith disabled people. And most 20 year old architecture students feel they're totally\nindestructible so they don't really think about accessibility within a building. So that's\nmore or less what I'm concentrating on, and dealing a lot with just diverse populations,\ndesigning for diversity. So I think it's had an influence on teaching and on our value\nsystem and in general. I think, you know, most of the people there have gone -- in the\nconference I noticed too have gone into some kind of -- of a field in the humanities\nrather than business, which 1s very interesting sort of a side effect on it --",
        "Q: Absolutely.",
        "A: -- on what's been happening.",
        "Q: Absolutely.",
        "A: Otherwise, we've tried to share things with our children, tried to answer their\nquestions as much as possible as what we remember. We wish we remember more\nprecisely. That's about tt.",
        "Q: Wonderful. Well, thank you, thank you, thank you so much for --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: -- for the interview and for sharing with us today.",
        "A: I'll probably think of a lot of things that I didn't -- I didn't mention, but -- in fact, you\nknow --",
        "Q: Actually -- yeah, actually, maybe that would be a good idea if we can take a minute.\nI can just pause it and then if you want to just sit. I have the time if you have the time\nand we can -- if you have --",
        "A: 12:30, I guess. Yeah.",
        "Q: If there's anything that, you know, you want to just think about and then --",
        "A: Yeah. We can go ahead --",
        "Q: Let's just do that. So I'm going to just pause it and then... Great. So we are recording\nagain after a pause with Paul to collect our thoughts. And once again, we discussed you\nwould like to tell us about your grandparents.",
        "A: Yeah. I was unfortunate to know -- only one of my grandparents was alive when --\nwhen I was born. And that was my mother's mother; my grandmother, Rosa Abeles, or\nOmas (ph) as we called her. She -- we tried very hard through the Red Cross to try to\nget her out afterwards because she refused to come out with us. She was old, elderly,\noverweight and -- and devoted only to Germany, really. Didn't have -- didn't -- would\nnot leave Germany under any circumstances. And we tried very hard through the\nGeneva Red Cross and finally learned at the end of the war that she had died in\nTheresienstadt in the concentration camps in Theresienstadt where a lot of older people\nwere taken. After doing some research at Yad Vashem when we went to Israel years\nlater, we looked up the date -- the dates that she was there, which Germany is of course\nincredible at recordkeeping. They keep records of everything. And we found that she\nwas at Theresienstadt for about six months period until she died, probably of starvation,\nat the -- at the same time that my wife's grandmother was also at Theresienstadt. They\ncould have possibly known each other years and years before we ever met.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, I didn't meet my wife until 1960. So it's very possible that they might\nhave known each other, as it is just one of those very strange coincidences.\nI'm often asked in talks in school what affect this has had on -- on my faith. And I have\nto admit that the whole experience probably made me more Jewish than I would have\nbeen in Germany, because we are relatively secular Jews and am still -- I do -- we do\nbelong to a synagogue here as we did in Hamburg, but it's reformed. As you know,\nJews have reformed conservative and orthodox. So it's very much on the liberal or\nreformed side here. But certainly, I felt more Jewish because of what's happened there.\nIt was interesting when we first came to America -- this was almost a couple years\nbefore Pearl Harbor, but only -- we arrived here 30 days, directly 30 days after the war\nin Europe broke out. We arrived on August Ist. The war started September 1, 1939.\nAnd we were treated as enemy aliens here. We were considered German.\nWhen the Japanese were deported from the west coast after Pearl Harbor, there was\nserious talk about doing the same thing with the Germans. They never did it because\nour skin color was not so obviously different from everybody else's skin color, but there\nwas serious talk about also doing that. I remember the FBI coming into our apartment\nin San Francisco, confiscating a Grundig radio that we had brought over because they\nthought it might receive shortwave. It didn't receive shortwave of course, but they\nconfiscated it anyway. So at this time the Deutsch of Bund, the German Bund was\nmarching up and down the streets of New York holding demonstrations. So America\nreally had not a clue as to what was really happening there at all. And I was very\ninstrumental in our little community here. We just finished building the very first LEED\ncertified synagogue in the world. A LEED is an international standard for rating energy\nefficient buildings. It simply means Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design.\nAnd so I was quite instrumental in getting that designed and built and LEED certified.\nSo I am active in that respect. I think the effect that this whole thing has had on me\nmore is to -- is to really be very, very conscious of any type -- any types of\ndiscrimination. Right now I'm working closely with a Moslem group which is getting a\nlot of prejudice in our area, and in many areas. Kids are being picked on in school.\nThere's -- there's just a lot of -- a lot of the same kind of ignorant prejudice. It comes\nreally out of ignorance more than anything else, of not understanding and not even\nwanting to understand. You know, when I went back in the military to Germany I was\nthe first Jew that many Germans had ever met, or had any contact with whatsoever, you\nknow. But when they said, we had no idea of what was really going on, that was very\nquestionable, because they -- well, maybe they knew enough not to ask the right\nquestions. That was -- but they did see their neighbors disappearing and -- and all kinds\nof things. One thing I left out is that after I got out of the US Army, I took what was\nknown at the time as a GI Bill of Rights which allows you to study. They give you a\nsmall stipend. I think it was $150 a month, which would make it very difficult to study\nin the U.S. at a university, but I could do graduate work in architecture in Germany. So\nagainst my father's best wishes, I enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich and\nspent a couple of years there doing graduate work in architecture. Had a very, very\ninternational class, a master's program in architecture. And a professor, who had fought\non the front in the -- Sep Ruf, a well known architect in Germany, who had fought on\nthe front. And one weekend decided to put us all in cars and take us to Dachau, which is\njust outside of Munich, you know. And he insisted that I ride with him in his car.\nAnd he tried to make a strong case for the fact that he was a soldier on the front, an\nofficer on the front, and not really knowing what was happening back home, as far as\nthe Jewish problem. I still -- I still have suspicions that if they wanted to find out what\nwas happening, not only to the Jews at home but to the Jews of the countries that were --\nthat they were occupying during the war, they could easily find out. Even an -- even an\nartillery officer could find that out, what was really going on. But he took us to the\nmemorial. And explained to us all -- the memorial at Dachau had just been built. It was\na very -- it was a very emotional trip. I was the only Jew in that architecture group, but\nthe group was -- only included two Germans. The rest were from, really, all over the\nworld. They had students from everywhere that came together and had a chance to\nexperience that very, very powerful visit. And they seemed to -- beginning to really\nunderstand what -- what kind of mass hysteria had taken place there, even though this\nwas just ten years after the war.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: As far as getting back to the faith issue, there 1s a -- there is a -- a Jewish saying of\nattempting to heal the world, of acting in such a way, behaving throughout your life in\nsuch a way, it's tikkun olam, which means to heal the world. And in some small ways\nyou're supposed -- ideally, it's to lead a life that would help to do that. So I've gotten\nvery involved in, at home, working with the homeless issue, which is prevalent in our\ntown also, and in creating a sustainable synagogue that does a little bit maybe to heal the\nenvironment. And it was -- by the way, it was the first LEED certified synagogue in the\nworld. And hopefully -- and since then -- this was three years ago it was -- it was\ncertified. And since then there have been many others that have also been certified. So\nif any affect it had on me, it's made me conscious of individual prejudices. When my\nwife and I talk to schools we try to get this across to kids as to picking on. Right now\nthere's a big thing all over the news about bullying and what -- what harm that can do.\nBullying because of -- you're gay, or because they're Moslem or because you're different\nfrom -- from the -- so the idea of differences and how we -- how we treat differences\nand how we only seem to gravitate to our own kind all the time needs to be addressed.\nAnd I think very slowly it 1s, but you know, it's very dangerous what's happening in this\ncountry right now because when they say that the hysteria of Naziism was only because\nthe Germans are so focused on the fuhrer, on a leader, that they will follow the leader\nover any precipice. Some of the things we're seeing now, some of the preyudices we see\nwith the mosque being proposed in New York and what have you, it could happen here\njust as easily I think as -- as having anything happen in Germany in the 1930s. So we're\nnot -- we're not above that. There are an awful lot of -- well, I won't get into politics too\nmuch, but -- okay.",

        "Answer: Paul Wolff.",
        "A: All?",
        "A: Okay. My name is Paul Mark John Wolff. For some strange reason or other my\nparents gave me the name of three saints.",
        "A: I have no idea why that is. I was born Hamburg, Germany on the 27th of December\n1929. My father and mother are deceased. My father was Carl Wolff or referred to in\nthis country as Charles Wolff. My mother was Erica Wolff, born Abeles. The maiden\nname was Abeles, Abeles. My -- I have two -- two sisters; Susan Barbara Wolff\nliving today still in New York, and Eva Berta Wolff who died of -- of multiple sclerosis\nin San Francisco many years ago. My sister in New York's name is Fogelstein, by the\nway. It's not Wolff anymore. She's married to Henry Fogelstein. My\nsister in San Francisco was Hertzfeld. Both married, incidentally. We were just talking\nabout that in the conference. Somehow there 1s a connection of survivors. They both\nmarried survivors. What else can I tell you? My children, do you want that too?",
        "A: Okay. I have three children, all of which are, I think, are registered as K2s. Karen\nWolff Kirschenbaum in New York, the oldest; Linda Wolff Dorjee, married a fellow\nfrom Boughton and therefore the name Dorjee; and my son, Charles Wolff, in Berkley --\nin Berkley. I was going to -- oh, interesting aside. Interesting aside that all three just\nrecently in the last couple months became German citizens. Germany has offered\nHolocaust -- children of Holocaust survivors citizenship if they want. Sort of -- it was\nvery weird for me to have them become German citizens, but they did it for specific\nreasons. They thought if -- if education gets too expensive in this country -- they all\nhave country -- that they want to be members of the European union in order to be able\nto attend any university within Europe --",
        "A: -- which 1s -- you know, they have no intention of going to Germany but this is an\nopen door to the EU --",
        "A: -- which makes sense, really.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Okay. I lived in Hamburg for the first nine years of my life. I clearly remember a\nfew things about school. I can remember being stoned, finally, on the way home from\nschool one day by children that I played with just the previous week. They were,\nobviously, put up to this by their parents, but that was sort of our -- my message to me\nand to my sisters to not return to school. So that was my end of my schooling in\nGermany. I was nine years old. I was, I remember, being angry at my father for not\nallowing me to join the Hitler youth, which you got to go on outings, camping trips, and\nhikes and like the Boy Scouts.",
        "A: But of course as a Jew they wouldn't have taken me anyway. But I really didn't\nunderstand too much of that at that time. It didn't become really obvious to me as a nine\nyear old until Kristanant (ph) when I can clearly remember them, the Gestapo, knocking\nat the gates of our house in Hamburg to arrest my father as it was common on the night\nof November 9th, 1938 to arrest all male Jews above 13 or 14 years old. I was too\nyoung, but they were after my father. My father knew he would be arrested, but wanted\nto go together with his brother-in-law. So he went over to his brother-in-law's house\nand thought they would be arrested together. My mother greeted them at the door as\nthey came in, in her housecoat. It was about Midnight, full of -- the housecoat, I\nremember, was full of my -- the metals that my father had earned fighting for the\nGermans in the first world war. He was a much decorated major in the artillery, in the\nmounted artillery, actually, and was heavily wounded. And she thought somehow that\nthat would exclude him from being arrested, but of course it didn't. They didn't really --\nweren't interested in the metals. And they wanted to know where he was and they went\nand got him. Luckily enough, he was released about a week later, because one of the\narresting officers actually had fought under him in the first world war and knew him\npersonally from that. And many people were kept for months some were never\nreleased. But that finally opened his eyes that, gee, maybe we should really do\nsomething, try to get out of here. He has two brothers, incidentally, who are married\nand had families. One went three years earlier to France and one went two years earlier\nto London. But my father -- I discussed this with him many times -- thought like so\nmany German Jews that this guy -- this upstar Hitler would blow over. It's a passing\nthing. We've just got to tough it out. Things will get back to normal again. And a lot of\n-- alot of Jews, German Jews, felt almost more German than Jewish in that respect.\nYou've probably heard that before. So he made -- he made moves to -- after Gustalac --\nopened his eyes and he made moves to try to get out. We had a very distant uncle in\nNew York. You had to have -- America had no Open Door Policy and you had to have\nsomebody vouch for you over here that you would not become a burden to the States or\n-- to the state or go on the welfare rolls.",
        "A: So we finally did get an exit visa to England. And we -- and on April 20th -- I\nremember April 20th, 1939, happened to be a -- that's the date of Hitler's birthday. We\nleft for England. Stayed two months -- two months in England waiting for some kind of\ntransportation to the States. We only had a transit visa in England so it wasn't -- wasn't\na -- couldn't be a final destination. He stayed -- my father and mother stayed with his\nbrother in London. I was -- there wasn't enough room, so I was put on a farm\nsomewhere in Devonshire where I remember being very, very lonely. Couldn't speak a\nword of language -- couldn't speak a word of English at the time. Had to point to food\nand things like that and had to -- never really lived on a farm before.\nMy sisters, incidentally, went on the Kindertransport a few months before we left; about\nsix months before. They both were adopted by British families and they were on the\nKindertransport. Both sisters. Okay. Then we finally got the -- on the SS Dinzeldike\n(ph) Dutch freighter with -- had room for 30 passengers going from London to San\nFrancisco through the Panama Canal. Thirty days on the ocean. Very exciting for a boy\nof 9.",
        "A: Get lost on the ship and go to places where you're not allowed. And -- and I\nremember it as a very exciting -- exciting voyage, except we were told we were going to\nSan Francisco and the only thing I ever heard about San Francisco was the earthquake of\n1906. So I figured, well, probably going to live in a cardboard shack there because they\ncan't have any permanent houses. It must be all black lava sand. I had this weird idea\nof what a -- what an earthquake country would be like --",
        "A: -- until the day we sailed under the Golden Gate Bridge.",
        "A: You know, and then of course, it was -- it was quite -- quite different. But it was a\nvery weird expectation of where we would go. At this time, my father was the only one\nof our family of five that spoke English. He had been to England as a young man. And\nmy sisters had picked up a little in their couple of -- in their six months in England. I\nspoke practically none at all, because during my time in England I wasn't there long\nenough to go to any kind of school. Schooling or anything. So basically I grew up in\nSan Francisco. And we arrived during summer, so by the time school started, I pick up\na lot of English on the streets already. For a nine year old it's very quick. I was\nsupposed to be, by my age, in fifth grade. So they put me in fourth grade because I\ndidn't speak enough English. And then they let me jump from fourth to sixth later on to\ncatch on with my -- to catch up with my age group. But, what else can I tell you?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",
        "A: Okay. Well, this reminds me of, as you know, Germany has a policy of inviting\nHolocaust survivors back to their original birth city. Right?",
        "A: So several years ago -- that's been about eight or nine years ago now -- we were both\ninvited back; my wife to Berlin and I was invited to Hamburg. And they show you the -\n- the city. But during that time while I was in Hamburg at the hotel, someone from the\narchives, much like you, came by to interview -- have a personal interview, get the story\nof each one.",
        "A: Okay. So I did that interview. And then several years later I was called by a movie\nproducer in Germany, Nina Koshofer -- who was Nina Koshofer, who was in the\nprocess of doing a very, very ambitious project of a documentary on the Jews sponsored\nby German television and French televisions stations. That's called -- do you speak\nGerman at all?",
        "A: It's called -- in English it's The Jews, History Of A People. In German it's (speaks in\nGerman). And it was running for -- it's a five-hour documentary. It was running for\nfive consecutive days on television, an hour each. It was sort of -- it ended up sort of a\nlittle bit like Roots was in this country, which was the history of black slavery.",
        "A: Here you may have seen it.",
        "A: Which also ran about four or five days in a row. And it was a very thorough\ndocumentary. She spent three and a half years traveling to Israel, Lithuania, France,\nGermany, everywhere to film this thing. So she had some good funding from these\ntelevision stations. And believe it or not, she brought her whole -- whole camera crew\nover to San Luis Obispo, California and filmed us, and filmed the Shabbat, the evening\nmeal which we had to stage on a Sunday night, instead of Friday, because she happened\nto be here on Sunday --",
        "A: -- you know. And did quite an extensive interview. So this -- this documentary ran.\n[have a DVD of tt.",
        "A: It ran both in Europe and it has not run on PBS yet but it's scheduled. It's scheduled\nto run on PBS.",
        "A: So it really starts sort of with Moses and ends with our family in San Luis Obispo.",
        "A: So it's really long. It's interesting. But she -- the reason I was picked for this is\nbecause of this interview that I did in Hamburg. She ran -- she read through all these\narchives, all these interviews --",
        "A: -- and said, I need somebody who has been kicked out of Germany who was a hero in\nthe first world war. They really wanted to interview my father, but because he wasn't\nalive anymore, so they settled with me. And one of the -- one of the episodes of my life\nthat they -- they staged in this film with somebody portraying the young kid -- nine year\nold kid portraying me, which might be interesting here, was because -- you asked me to\ngo back to remember things. I remembered very clearly the Gestapo coming in and\nsurveying all our belongings, which they did. I still have a list of -- a very, very detailed\nlist. So many handkerchiefs, so much linen, so many knives, forks, and spoons; all the\ninventory. Most of which was confiscated. Ones -- we were allowed to take one knife,\nfork, and spoon per person. For a family of five we could take five things with us. And\nanything of value that they wanted too, any ornamentation that we had around.\nAnd we had a large vase, vase, a carved glass vase with a gold rim on the top. And I\nnoticed they were going through getting anything -- any metals of any value, silver or\ngold, or anything that they were confiscating. So while they were rummaging through\nthe house -- I was watching this -- I took this vase and held it under the kitchen faucet\nunder hot water and wanted to see if the rim would come off. And tapped it, and believe\nit or not, the rim came right off. So they took the rim and they left us the vase. We still\nhave the vase 1n our living room at home now. They were only interested in the --",
        "A: -- in the metal part. Not the vase. It's a large carved glass vase. I thought it was\nquite handsome. Anyway, that part they staged in this -- in this little film, the history of\nthe Jews there, and -- and a lot of my father's exploits in the first world war as a major.\nI'm not sure what else I can tell you except the thought of this has never -- the thought of\nour background is somehow never very far from -- from my -- I've been a Professor of\nArchitecture at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and I've concentrated on minority populations.\nI guess -- I'm guess it's related to the background of minorities. And we do talk to high\nschool groups and college groups and various groups in -- in CaliforniA: I would like to\ndo that. I haven't done that yet in Germany.",
        "A: It would be interesting to do that in Germany. Go ahead. Now ask me something\nelse.",
        "A: Yeah. I've never quite figured out. And you know, it's -- it's interesting that after\nyour parents die you think of all the millions of questions that you wish you would have\nasked them, which of course, they are not ask-able anymore. But I was relatively frail,\nunderweight and very skinny. And for some reason or another, my parents decided to\nkeep me with them and put them on the Kindertransport rather. Maybe they felt I was\ntoo young. My wife was six months younger than I am when she was put on the\nKindertransport by her mother, you know. It's also very, very hard for me to conceive,\nas a parent, to conceive of what you must feel like to give your child up into the\nunknown, because you generally prefer the devil that you know that may be existing\nwith you than the devil that you don't know and you have no idea what you're giving\nyour child to this... In the -- in the film, what is it? The -- \"Into The Arms of Strangers\"\nthere is this one very emotional scene where a father just simply pitches his baby\nthrough the train window and a teenager catches the baby and saved its life.",
        "A: But for a parent to give up a child into the unknown like that is very difficult.\nBut anyway, my sisters both went out, I think about four months before we did.\nActually, on separate Kindertransports. And my oldest sister, Susan, stayed with my --\nstayed with my father's brother. My younger sister Eva was adopted by a Jewish cab\ndriver in London with whom she corresponded with for many years after she came back\nhere, and was treated very well. Some of the children had much worse experience, as\nyou probably heard. Some were taken advantage of, some were used as domestic\nservants. But my wife's -- my wife was adopted by a Quaker family and grew up as a\nQuaker and also was treated very well. A lot of Quakers came forward to adopt\nchildren. Okay. My sister in New York, for example, I've tried to get her into the\nKindertransport organization or such. Well, she's listed in it, but she really is a denier.\nShe never would want to step foot on Germany. She would never -- she hasn't told her\nkids much about this. She doesn't -- she really -- and she's -- she was the oldest. She\nwas actually -- I was -- yeah. She was 16 at the time, so she would have a better\nmemory than anything and she's forgotten everything. She's forgotten everything. She's\nremembers nothing about the voyage, the trip, or anything.",
        "A: So, it's very interesting.\nMy wife just recently published a book about her experience. Shedding Skins. I don't\nknow if she mentioned to you, but she had -- she worked very closely with a Jewish\neditor in our -- in our city that proofread the book and would give her pointers on it.\nAnd shortly after that -- her publication -- this editor died. And we went to the funeral\nservice and learned through the editor's daughter that she was also a \"Kind\" and she\nnever mentioned it.",
        "A: She never mentioned it at all. And you know, they worked together for a couple of\nyears. And my wife was just blown away that somebody would just totally --",
        "A: -- you know, deny that.",
        "A: Okay. What else?",
        "A: No. I wanted to show you something.",
        "A: But -- well, go ahead. You have some more questions probably.",
        "A: No. I wasn't -- I was there two months. I was living on a farm. I thought I had been\nabandoned, sort of thing, because I -- I couldn't speak the language, and I was -- I\nremember being very, very lonely. And not speak -- and people didn't speak any\nGerman. I have no idea how this family was ever picked. But finally, when we met at\nthe dockside that was my first reunion with my sisters also where -- in England so that\nwe all -- we all finally did get on the boat together. But otherwise, I -- I remember\nrelatively little, little of that ttme in England. I remember in San Francisco also nearly\nbeing kicked out of school because I got in a fight with a guy that called me a dirty Jew.\nTeacher sort of picked us up by our scruffs of our necks and was going to kick us out.\nBut I realized that -- that you know, the prejudice wasn't just limited to Germany. Why\nwould -- it happened here too. I am the keeper of our family passports so I still have my\n-- my Nazi passport. We were all given the middle name of Israel, as you probably\nknow. I had hair once too.",
        "A: Yeah. Actually --",
        "A: -- all except Susan's photo. I have even my parents' Nazi passports. When we went\nto Germany and -- recently --",
        "A: -- you have to show you passport as you enter the country. I showed them my -- my\nNazi passport.",
        "A: And the guy did not have much of a sense of humor. He said, \"You know, sir, I can\nhave you arrested. I have to confiscate this because it has a swastika on it. Any\ndocuments with a swastika on it are illegal in Germany.\"",
        "A: \"And so you could be arrested. And this can be confiscated.\" I said, \"Okay. Forget\nit. Here's my American passport.\"",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: I don't know what else.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Okay. My father was a -- started a coffee firm in Hamburg, importing coffee\nand processing it from Guatemala, so that's all he really knew was coffee. So when we\ncame to this country he started peddling coffee house -- until he found a firm here, he\nstarted peddling coffee house to house, selling coffee by the pound from house to house,\nby foot, because he never learned to drive in Germany. He had a chauffeur. Over here\nhe just never learned to drive, even all the years he was here. But after about, oh, I'd say\nsix months approximately of peddling coffee he realized he could not support a family\nof five by selling coffee, and yet that was about the extent of what he knew. So he\nfound a job on the San Francisco waterfront and became a stevedore. And for the first\ntime in his life really did -- did physical eight to five. He was a union member and\nworking on the waterfront. And told me, I remember, that in many ways he preferred\nthat because at 5:00 he could no longer -- he would no longer have to worry about his --\nhis business. He was -- his time was his own. He worked strictly from eight to five. It\nwas tough physical work, but he was free of any -- any kind of other concerns and\nobligations. And my mother started being a saleswoman in a department store. No.\nShe started -- first of all, she started cleaning people's houses. She was a domestic\nhouse cleaner cleaning people's house for many years and then she became a sales clerk\nin a department store. And so we all -- we had pitched in. We all had some kind of\njobs. There was a Jewish Council of 1933 which helped us get an apartment in San\nFrancisco. It helps you get settled a little bit. I still spoke, always, German when I\ncame home, and English in school. So my sisters also had jobs. I started sweeping out -\n- [remember my first job sweeping out a plumbing store and a grocery store for eleven\ncents an hour. I remember that. When I finally figured out how much I was making an\nhour, I quit and got the job at 20 cents an hour somewhere else. But that was -- yeah,\nthat was in San Francisco. So I never really had a much -- through junior high and high\nschool, I never had any much social life at all because I had a job after school almost all\nthe time. So we all sort of -- we all sort of pitched in. I was the only one of the -- I was\nthe only one in my family fortunate enough to go to a university. I went to U C Berkley\nand studied architecture. And got drafted into the U.S. Army during the Korean War,\nwhich was -- they sent me to Germany, which was a good place to be during the Korean\nWar. And it was very interesting for me, because I would -- this was 1955, ten years\nafter the end of the war. And I could very easily put on civies and go into a bar and sit\ndown and have a beer and listen to everybody refighting the Second World War which\nwas fascinating for me, you know. And an awful lot of denial going on. Hitler, who\nwas he? And you know -- sort of thing. Or I -- I was not a Nazi. And I always would\nask what time -- what point they joined the Nazi party, because if they joined 1n the late\n-- in the -- '44, early '45, '43, then they probably weren't convinced Nazis because by\nthat time they had to join 1n order to survive. But those who joined in the early forties,\nand even the late thirties were pretty -- pretty convinced of that, you know. So anti-\nsemitism was not that -- I had no desire to -- to live there. I was glad, glad to be part of\nthe US Army. That was --",
        "A: Yeah. It was very interesting. In fact, I was there during the time when the Germans\nwere being asked by NATO to rearm and develop their own Army. And I was a\ncorporal. And we had -- we started getting orders that when we meet German officers\nwe were to salute. I could never bring myself to do that. So I'd go down the street and a\nGerman officer would start approaching me. And of course, the -- the lower rank is\nsupposed to salute first.",
        "A: And the upper rank then returns the salute, but with me it was -- I was -- I teased\nthem to call me, but they never really did. But I would never, never salute. Finally,\nwhen the officer gets up to me, he salutes --",
        "A: -- you know, and then I would return the salute. Or I would not -- no. Actually, I did\nnot return the salute. But as far as expecting to be called out on this, and never did.\nNever did. They probably suspected, oh, this guy's Jewish. He's not going to salute me.",
        "A: And it was interesting at that time. I did a little research on my own and found out\nthat in schools nothing was -- at that time, nothing was being taught at all about the Nazi\nerA: They did -- they do now. They have picked it up a lot, but at that time, ten years\nafter the war it was just total denial.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Well, no. You might want to check out this -- this video.",
        "A: This -- that is very interesting. And I think the Holocaust -- you guys either would\nhave one -- have it already. I don't know how you -- if you research other -- what other\ncountries do.",
        "A: Or I have some extra copies. I can send you one.",
        "A: It's available in English now and in German, and I think in French too --",
        "A: -- now. So it's a -- it's a good thing to have. Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. We're trying not do the same mistake that I did with my parents by not asking\nenough questions. And now as our children are -- are getting older, you know, they're\nwhat, 46, 44, and 42, so they're -- and they have children of their own.",
        "A: So particularly my son is very, very -- I took -- I took him along when we were\ninvited to Germany. Did I -- Oh. I'm sorry.",
        "A: Put this back on me.",
        "A: Well, that's -- get my handkerchief out. I undid that.",
        "A: What do you want -- you want me to repeat something?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Okay. My son is probably the most, I'd say the most Jewish of the three of us -- three\nof my children. And we took him with us to Germany for this visit to Hamburg and\nBerlin. And he's also a member of Kin 2. He did a stint in Israel. He speaks fluent\nHebrew. He joined the Israeli defense forces for a short time to free -- to free natives for\nfighting -- for fighting. They train foreigners to be sort of domestic part of the IDF. He\nteaches Spanish in Berkley. Interestingly enough, it's part of, I think, our effect on our\nchildren that they have all gone into professions, non-entrepreneurial professions, but\nthey are more -- much more interested in working with and helping people.\nMy daughter is a physical therapist. My other daughter in New York works for the\nInnocence Project with Berry Scheck. She's a lawyer by training. Works with the\nInnocence Project. And Charles teaches Spanish. And I've been teaching, primarily\ntrying to sensitize architects, architecture students to designing for disabilities, working\nwith disabled people. And most 20 year old architecture students feel they're totally\nindestructible so they don't really think about accessibility within a building. So that's\nmore or less what I'm concentrating on, and dealing a lot with just diverse populations,\ndesigning for diversity. So I think it's had an influence on teaching and on our value\nsystem and in general. I think, you know, most of the people there have gone -- in the\nconference I noticed too have gone into some kind of -- of a field in the humanities\nrather than business, which 1s very interesting sort of a side effect on it --",
        "A: -- on what's been happening.",
        "A: Otherwise, we've tried to share things with our children, tried to answer their\nquestions as much as possible as what we remember. We wish we remember more\nprecisely. That's about tt.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: I'll probably think of a lot of things that I didn't -- I didn't mention, but -- in fact, you\nknow --",
        "A: 12:30, I guess. Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. We can go ahead --",
        "A: Yeah. I was unfortunate to know -- only one of my grandparents was alive when --\nwhen I was born. And that was my mother's mother; my grandmother, Rosa Abeles, or\nOmas (ph) as we called her. She -- we tried very hard through the Red Cross to try to\nget her out afterwards because she refused to come out with us. She was old, elderly,\noverweight and -- and devoted only to Germany, really. Didn't have -- didn't -- would\nnot leave Germany under any circumstances. And we tried very hard through the\nGeneva Red Cross and finally learned at the end of the war that she had died in\nTheresienstadt in the concentration camps in Theresienstadt where a lot of older people\nwere taken. After doing some research at Yad Vashem when we went to Israel years\nlater, we looked up the date -- the dates that she was there, which Germany is of course\nincredible at recordkeeping. They keep records of everything. And we found that she\nwas at Theresienstadt for about six months period until she died, probably of starvation,\nat the -- at the same time that my wife's grandmother was also at Theresienstadt. They\ncould have possibly known each other years and years before we ever met.",
        "A: You know, I didn't meet my wife until 1960. So it's very possible that they might\nhave known each other, as it is just one of those very strange coincidences.\nI'm often asked in talks in school what affect this has had on -- on my faith. And I have\nto admit that the whole experience probably made me more Jewish than I would have\nbeen in Germany, because we are relatively secular Jews and am still -- I do -- we do\nbelong to a synagogue here as we did in Hamburg, but it's reformed. As you know,\nJews have reformed conservative and orthodox. So it's very much on the liberal or\nreformed side here. But certainly, I felt more Jewish because of what's happened there.\nIt was interesting when we first came to America -- this was almost a couple years\nbefore Pearl Harbor, but only -- we arrived here 30 days, directly 30 days after the war\nin Europe broke out. We arrived on August Ist. The war started September 1, 1939.\nAnd we were treated as enemy aliens here. We were considered German.\nWhen the Japanese were deported from the west coast after Pearl Harbor, there was\nserious talk about doing the same thing with the Germans. They never did it because\nour skin color was not so obviously different from everybody else's skin color, but there\nwas serious talk about also doing that. I remember the FBI coming into our apartment\nin San Francisco, confiscating a Grundig radio that we had brought over because they\nthought it might receive shortwave. It didn't receive shortwave of course, but they\nconfiscated it anyway. So at this time the Deutsch of Bund, the German Bund was\nmarching up and down the streets of New York holding demonstrations. So America\nreally had not a clue as to what was really happening there at all. And I was very\ninstrumental in our little community here. We just finished building the very first LEED\ncertified synagogue in the world. A LEED is an international standard for rating energy\nefficient buildings. It simply means Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design.\nAnd so I was quite instrumental in getting that designed and built and LEED certified.\nSo I am active in that respect. I think the effect that this whole thing has had on me\nmore is to -- is to really be very, very conscious of any type -- any types of\ndiscrimination. Right now I'm working closely with a Moslem group which is getting a\nlot of prejudice in our area, and in many areas. Kids are being picked on in school.\nThere's -- there's just a lot of -- a lot of the same kind of ignorant prejudice. It comes\nreally out of ignorance more than anything else, of not understanding and not even\nwanting to understand. You know, when I went back in the military to Germany I was\nthe first Jew that many Germans had ever met, or had any contact with whatsoever, you\nknow. But when they said, we had no idea of what was really going on, that was very\nquestionable, because they -- well, maybe they knew enough not to ask the right\nquestions. That was -- but they did see their neighbors disappearing and -- and all kinds\nof things. One thing I left out is that after I got out of the US Army, I took what was\nknown at the time as a GI Bill of Rights which allows you to study. They give you a\nsmall stipend. I think it was $150 a month, which would make it very difficult to study\nin the U.S. at a university, but I could do graduate work in architecture in Germany. So\nagainst my father's best wishes, I enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich and\nspent a couple of years there doing graduate work in architecture. Had a very, very\ninternational class, a master's program in architecture. And a professor, who had fought\non the front in the -- Sep Ruf, a well known architect in Germany, who had fought on\nthe front. And one weekend decided to put us all in cars and take us to Dachau, which is\njust outside of Munich, you know. And he insisted that I ride with him in his car.\nAnd he tried to make a strong case for the fact that he was a soldier on the front, an\nofficer on the front, and not really knowing what was happening back home, as far as\nthe Jewish problem. I still -- I still have suspicions that if they wanted to find out what\nwas happening, not only to the Jews at home but to the Jews of the countries that were --\nthat they were occupying during the war, they could easily find out. Even an -- even an\nartillery officer could find that out, what was really going on. But he took us to the\nmemorial. And explained to us all -- the memorial at Dachau had just been built. It was\na very -- it was a very emotional trip. I was the only Jew in that architecture group, but\nthe group was -- only included two Germans. The rest were from, really, all over the\nworld. They had students from everywhere that came together and had a chance to\nexperience that very, very powerful visit. And they seemed to -- beginning to really\nunderstand what -- what kind of mass hysteria had taken place there, even though this\nwas just ten years after the war.",
        "A: As far as getting back to the faith issue, there 1s a -- there is a -- a Jewish saying of\nattempting to heal the world, of acting in such a way, behaving throughout your life in\nsuch a way, it's tikkun olam, which means to heal the world. And in some small ways\nyou're supposed -- ideally, it's to lead a life that would help to do that. So I've gotten\nvery involved in, at home, working with the homeless issue, which is prevalent in our\ntown also, and in creating a sustainable synagogue that does a little bit maybe to heal the\nenvironment. And it was -- by the way, it was the first LEED certified synagogue in the\nworld. And hopefully -- and since then -- this was three years ago it was -- it was\ncertified. And since then there have been many others that have also been certified. So\nif any affect it had on me, it's made me conscious of individual prejudices. When my\nwife and I talk to schools we try to get this across to kids as to picking on. Right now\nthere's a big thing all over the news about bullying and what -- what harm that can do.\nBullying because of -- you're gay, or because they're Moslem or because you're different\nfrom -- from the -- so the idea of differences and how we -- how we treat differences\nand how we only seem to gravitate to our own kind all the time needs to be addressed.\nAnd I think very slowly it 1s, but you know, it's very dangerous what's happening in this\ncountry right now because when they say that the hysteria of Naziism was only because\nthe Germans are so focused on the fuhrer, on a leader, that they will follow the leader\nover any precipice. Some of the things we're seeing now, some of the preyudices we see\nwith the mosque being proposed in New York and what have you, it could happen here\njust as easily I think as -- as having anything happen in Germany in the 1930s. So we're\nnot -- we're not above that. There are an awful lot of -- well, I won't get into politics too\nmuch, but -- okay.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: I think that's --",
        "A: I think that's fine. Thank you very much.\n"
