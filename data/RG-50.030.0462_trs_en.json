        "Answer: Oh, seventh --",
        "Q: -- the seventh, in New York City, conducted by Joan Ringleheim. This 1s tape number one,\nside A. Sippy.",
        "A: Yes my -- madam?",
        "Q: I want to ask you a bunch of sh -- sort of short -- I don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re short\nquestions, but they seem --",
        "A: How sh -- yeah [indecipherable]",
        "Q: -- they seem like little -- they seem like little questions to me. So, we\u2019Il see whether -- cause I\nwent through all of our conversations, so I have some small questions, and I have some larger\nquestions. So, here\u2019s my first question, okay? You said, when you disembarked, when you got to\nAuschwitz, you disembarked in the town of Oswiecim.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Is that right?",
        "A: Correct. Out -- outside of Stohn, I would say, it\u2019s very -- very -- very ofsa town, compared\nlike New York, and maybe Welfare Island. Yeah, a little bit. Just close enough, but outside of the\ncenter of the -- of the town, yeah. There wasn\u2019t all -- actually, now, after 50 years, I can even\nshow you a map which we have produced, together with the Auschwitz Museum. They have\nasked me the same question, so we produced some little diagram, a map.",
        "Q: Of where you disembarked?",
        "A: Of where it is in the location, yeah.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: It was outside -- I would say it was not the railway station, but it was the railway station for --\nfor goods, yeah. Like cattle. They have embarked merchandise, and like here, for example, I\ndon\u2019t know how -- how railway stations work [indecipherable] we have people, and we have\ncattle, and we have all kind of things.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Now, in Europe, people -- as the railway stations in Europe are small, because they have the\nrailway stations in -- for little cities, and larger cities, concentrated mainly for people. And\neverything else is a little bit far out. It stops before the -- before the general railway station, so I\nwould say a couple of miles.",
        "Q: Couple of miles.",
        "A: And that what happened to us. We were not e-embarked -- disembarked?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Bark? Embarked, or disembarked?",
        "Q: Dis-Disembarked.",
        "A: Disembarked where people were used to travel, and -- and -- and come or go, but we were\ndisembarked where the cattle --",
        "Q: Cattle go.",
        "A: Right, that was it.",
        "Q: Let me -- I\u2019m going to stop the tape for one second.",
        "A: I-In Auschwitz --",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019re back. Yeah.",
        "A: In Auschwitz, I produced -- I had the same question from the people of the Auschwitz\nmuseum, so I predi -- produced together a plan, and the route how we were then walking by foot\nfrom the place of disembarking --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- over to the camp in the -- because Auschwitz, one camp where we were taken, there were\nonly a couple of -- half a mile -- well, ish -- well [indecipherable] close.",
        "Q: It was close?",
        "A: Very close, yeah.",
        "Q: Tell -- tell me what your condition was when you got off. You were with a thousand women,\nabout.",
        "A: Y -- but today we know we were a little bit less than thousand women, but it\u2019s supposed to\narrive thousand women, and some of the people were taking off before the -- before the people\nthat were put into the cattle cars. [indecipherable] maybe two or three of thousand girl.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right. And do you recall how long a trip it was? A few days?",
        "A: Oh, that --",
        "Q: Or less?",
        "A: It was for us -- in those days, it appeared longer than it really was, yeah. We have been in the\ncar at least one night for sure, yeah. And the whole day trapped, we embark in late afternoon, so\nwe traveled the whole afternoon, then we traveled the whole night, then we traveled a whole day.\nSo that was for sure. Maybe 1-if -- today I cannot even bet. Is -- remember that we arrived on --\non Sunday, late afternoon, and we eb -- embarked on a Friday afternoon. So how much is that?\nTell me.",
        "Q: From s --",
        "A: Friday afternoon, Saturday -- Friday night, Saturday, then it must have been Saturday night,\nand over to Sunday. And that -- what it -- what it peared -- appeared to me then, I even\nmentioned that in the borders -- borders interview. Today, after 50 years, somehow it is -- it was\nshrinking in my mind of one day, one night, and another day, yeah. But I don\u2019t remember certain\nnight any more, yeah, today. But I d-definitely remember one night. So, that\u2019s how it goes.",
        "Q: Do you remember the mood that you had on the train?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: The -- your mood.",
        "A: Food?",
        "Q: Mood.",
        "A: Oh, so mood?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: There was no mood. Fif -- you know, fi -- we have been one week in -- on stage of isolation\nin [indecipherable] point, which was cold, but dronga, on the old factory hall. And wi -- we had\nenough to eat, because everybody who was there brought some food along from home, so that\nwe were living on. They did not supplied us any food. You are not asking an important question,\nbut the people somehow managed to -- everybody had something from home, yeah, and\nsomehow that was our -- that kept us somehow in a mood, yeah, if you are talking about mood. I\ndon\u2019t even remember, there was nothing to drink. I don\u2019t remember anything to drink, and we\nwent probably the whole week, nothing to drink.",
        "Q: From the time you --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- got into Petronka until --",
        "A: No, there was no --",
        "Q: -- nothing?",
        "A: Nothing. There was no food distribution. That means whatever we had, maybe some fruit or\nso, replaced the -- some water, and it was -- there was no mood, it was some very strange\nsituation, because we were -- we -- we have never experienced anything like that. We went as\nyoung people to -- to summer camps as children, and as teenagers. We -- they were -- we were\ntold we have to -- we will go and do some work in the fields, or whatever necessary, because\nthere\u2019s no -- not enough manpower, or woman power, or whatever power, work. There -- there 1s\nnot enough of -- there are not enough of people for certain jobs available, because everybody\u2019s --\nthe male are on the front, and the women in that -- to work in factories, so do other things, the\ncivilians. So we were actually selected to do jobs wherever we need it -- wherever we are\nneeded, yeah. So, nobody was com -- very excited. The war went on, and so what? But for weeks\nor months we\u2019ll survive and come back home, that what we are told.",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: So there was not a -- really no -- no mood. Just we have taken things [indecipherable], we --\nwe realize that something must be done, and that is what they want us to do, to do some odd\njobs, and [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So there was no suspicion about something terrible --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- going to happen? Nothing?",
        "A: Not at all, not at all. The only people who knew about the terrible things which are in front of\nus, were -- was the Jewish community\u2019s board of -- the so-called Jewish centers, the Juden\nCentrales, they knew that things aren\u2019t going too good for us. But they never disclosed anything.\nBut I know we know that they knew, after the Wannsee Conference, yeah, what is in front of --\nwhat\u2019s in front of the population [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right. And you think they knew?",
        "A: They knew.",
        "Q: They knew?",
        "A: They knew. They didn\u2019t know about the gas chambers. They didn\u2019t know about the real f --\nthat -- that factory, because they knew that it doesn\u2019t look good for us, but they couldn\u2019t --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- they said they really didn\u2019t know. Because when the first people escaped from Auschwitz,\nthose four boys, you know, Wirbra, Vetsla, Mordavich, and Rossi, and when they returned, to\nreport, you wouldn\u2019t believe it. All Jewish people --",
        "Q: Don\u2019t do that.",
        "A: -- wouldn\u2019t believe. So, that\u2019s why I know and suspect that, you know, they didn\u2019t know the\nreal techniques of Germans [indecipherable]",
        "Q: But when you -- by the time you got on the train --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- to go to Auschwitz, you must have been weak, all of you. Were you weak?",
        "A: Weak?",
        "Q: Weak?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Even though you weren\u2019t eating much or drinking much?",
        "A: We are eating or not, because everybody brought --",
        "Q: Brought something?",
        "A: -- some food along.",
        "Q: So when you get -- you get in the train --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Is this -- this is a cattle car train, or you\u2019re sitting in s -- how -- what sort of a train did they\nput you in?",
        "A: Cattle car train.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Sitting on the floor.",
        "Q: Floor. And did they pack you in, or was it not so bad?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t nice.",
        "Q: Yeah, right.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t nice, but even that, we couldn\u2019t -- so we were only young girls, you see. The other --\nother people went with families, husbands and children.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: We were young people, couldn\u2019t care less. Even if it was only with [indecipherable] for to\nwork, but not youngsters -- very similar to those f-festivals we had, where the youngsters were\nsqueezed together, and were happy and singing, yeah?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Th-though we were not singing, and we were squeezed together, yeah, but it [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did people get beaten?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Were people beaten, were you treated brutally, or not?",
        "A: No, no, no, they were very careful, very careful not to -- not to s -- give us any feeling of -- to\nbecome suspicious. No, we were just left alone, I would say. There were no guards inside. Yeah,\nthey left us alone. No screamings, and no -- no beatings, nothing. So first real rough situation\noccurred when we arrived in Auschwitz itself. Because before, on the trip we were -- I think that\nwas an combined -- combined operation between the guards of the Slovakians, and the Germans.\nThe Slovaks took us to the border, and after the border, the Ger -- the bor -- not the border, it\u2019s in\nPoland already, so Germans, they took over. But -- so, disembarking went very rough, yeah. Un -\n- un -- unexplainable rough. Obvious different types of people, different uniforms, different\ncommands, everything changed, and then we still didn\u2019t know what it is all about. So, it took us a\ncouple of days to get used, while arriving in Auschwitz, and th -- we went through the procedure,\nin the first couple of days. So, that taught us gradually, that life -- the prior life of ours, is behind\nus, yeah. And --",
        "Q: Did you --",
        "A: -- we have entered a new world.",
        "Q: Did you understand German then? Did you know -- you knew German.",
        "A: I have German schools.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: After the --",
        "Q: So, all the girls --",
        "A: -- [indecipherable] school -- pardon?",
        "Q: -- all the girls understood German?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: But many.",
        "Q: Many.",
        "A: The girls -- as most of the girls were from our capital city, where -- which 1s an German\nspeaking city, among others. It\u2019s ambu -- multilingual city. But most of the Germ -- of the Jewish\ngirls, of course, went to German elementary schools. If nothing else, they went to elementary\nschools, because the German elem-elementary schools -- the Jewish element-elementary schools\nwere German --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- in those days, it was shortly after World War Two, the people were born, the G-Germans --",
        "Q: You mean World War One, they were born shortly after --",
        "A: World War One, correct, sorry. Th-Those girls were born, the parents enrolled them in Jewish\nelementary schools because they were good. They s -- have just transferred that from the\nAustrian system into the Slovak system. So that -- you must realize people, like Jewish parents,\nalways prefer to send their kids to good schools, yeah. They have preferred the German, because\nthat wa -- the elementary schools had the teachers, the language -- I mean the system was already\nestablished, while the Slovak system had to be established. There was not even a Slovak\ngrammatic. It has to be developed in those days. But we spoke all -- we had to speak Slovak, and\nthe city had a large Hungarian population from the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, but the Jewish\npeople never -- ne -- in our city, Bratislava, never had any -- that -- they preferred the German.\nThe Hungarian was mainly in the hands of non-Jews, yeah. It was the old fa-fashioned m-\nmonarchies, yeah. We had none -- nothing in -- in our community like that. So --",
        "Q: So, let me ask you someth -- I just thought of this. What were you wearing, on your -- do you\nremember?",
        "A: It was wi -- it was early -- it was early spring, March in Europe, and in that part of Poland was\nrough, and cold. So, not knowing where we are going, we all had -- definitely we had no high\nheels. A-As a matter of fact, I can show you a picture of the shoes which I wore.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: Because they were the shoes I have picked just from prior years, during my -- our times in\ncamps, and so on, where I had some special, very good mountain climbing shoes, yeah. I put that\non, and not knowing -- I knew that we are not going into a city, but maybe into the fields, or\nother [indecipherable] rural areas. So I accordingly dressed myself, and shoes were always of\nimportance wherever you went, even -- I mean, those shoes, I took the best and most durable,\nstrong shoes I had. And as a matter of fact, I have a picture of those shoes [indecipherable]. So,\nwhat else? And I had on good winter coat, a wool winter coat. I -- and I had gloves, and on cover\nof a knitted angora -- kind of an turban, something what we wear today, knitted, very nice, in\ndark green, I don\u2019t know if -- in bottle green, I never forget that. So gloves, and the cover of my\nhead. No, that was all I remember.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember were you wearing a skirt?",
        "A: Ah?",
        "Q: Were you wearing a skirt, or you were wearing pants, do you have any -- remember?",
        "A: N-No, no, I had no -- I\u2019ve a -- I wore skirt and one pullover.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And most of the other women that you were with?",
        "A: Similar, very similar.",
        "Q: Similar dress?",
        "A: Very similar, yeah.",
        "Q: And people were not wearing high heels, they didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Oh no, definitely.",
        "Q: No. You knew, right.",
        "A: Sporty. Yeah, prepared for some -- a rural -- a rural environment.",
        "Q: Now Sippy, you told me that you saw a sign --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- when you were walking into the area. The sign say, KZ Auschwitz, or Concentration Lager,\nwhat does it say?",
        "A: No, that was lots of sign when we went that was exactly on the door entrance.",
        "Q: At the entrance.",
        "A: At the entrance, and it was hitting me like you would have hit me over the head. You see, I\ntold you that I was an trained sandwriter.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: A graphic artist. I always looked at letters, and signs, and that\u2019s why I could remember so\nmany other things, even now where I don\u2019t see, the first thing I\u2019m looking at an area where I am,\nI\u2019m looking at the road signs, and if I cannot see, then I\u2019m asking people to read for me. Signs\nare something of importance. And I was reading everything what I could at the entrance. There\nwas one little white sign with black letters. So little, I would say like an standard American --",
        "Q: Foot?",
        "A: Letterhead, [indecipherable] but sheet of --",
        "Q: Paper?",
        "A: Of paper, yeah.",
        "Q: Like eight by 11?",
        "A: Eight by 11, or something like that, in white. And there was on pr-printed, or painted wording\n-- the wording, it said, Concentrationes Lager. Concentration Camp, yeah. No more, and no less.\nI have never -- and that was -- I could not share that with anybody because those girls didn\u2019t\nknow what it is all about. I had experience with ex-German Jews, who were leaving, and\nAustrian Jews who left, all immigrants from all parts of Europe, they were coming through our\ncity for awhile, and then left again. And they told us what a concentration camp is, because some\nof them were even relieved just under one condition to leave Germany, yeah. So, I knew that I\nentered an concentration camp, in spite of the fact that we really went through the door which\nsaid [indecipherable] fry. There were the stop signs, hahlt, yeah. All kinds of -- of warning signs,\nand important to the whole entrance of the camp, which even today I think you can see. But that\nlittle sign of concentration camp, was there, I don\u2019t know why, it must have been there for the --\nto the rules, yeah, or to international rules. It was there, and I noticed it. And then I know I\u2019m in\na concentration camp. In the beginning, I didn\u2019t -- we knew that after awhile, but the moment I\nentered that gate, I knew where I am. That was an --",
        "Q: So that must have been shocking.",
        "A: It was, yeah.",
        "Q: Don\u2019t do that.",
        "A: Yeah. It\u2019s [indecipherable]. I forgot. Yes, it was. And even then, so we -- look, 1t was the end\nof our private, previous life, we knew that. We didn\u2019t know what\u2019s in front of us, we didn\u2019t know\nhow to cope with our past, yeah. But I knew that I\u2019m in a concentration camp, from the very first\nmoment on.",
        "Q: In this group that you came in with.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: Were there close friends of yours, or these were just acquaintances?",
        "A: No, it\u2019s -- you could -- look, it was funny. Nearly everybody knew everybody, but we were\nshifted forward and backward, and pushed around. So if you had a little group of people, two\nminutes later you belonged to another group, yeah. My very first contact in co -- it\u2019s very\nstrange. My very first contact with somebody whom I haven\u2019t known before, and somehow\ndrove -- drove us close to each other, was Katya, who became then the top administrative inmate\nof the women\u2019s camp. Katya Singr, now how -- what happened? While we were still laying on\nthe straw, on the floor in that factory hall the first day, she\u2019s -- had an very deep voice, and that\nwoman started to cry, and to scream loud, and crying, and crying --",
        "Q: This isn\u2019t --",
        "A: -- like an bad baby, yeah.",
        "Q: This isn\u2019t Petronka?",
        "A: Nonstop. No, she -- there was a reason to cry, of course, we all could have cried, but she just\ncried, no. I went over to her, just ask her to stop to cry, we are all in the same boat, yeah. And\nshe has no right to scream, and to cry, and to -- it will not help. And I was sitting next to her, and\nshe stopped crying. So we became friends. I was the only person who spoke to her, and so then,\nwe shared our belongings, the food, until we were put into the cattle car. She was in the same\ncattle car, we stick together somehow, as close as we could, because I felt I can in-influence her\nin making her a little bit more comforta -- feel comfortable, and she needed something like that,\nokay? Now, while in Birkenau, when we arrive -- no, sorry, while in Auschwitz one, when we\narrive, somehow it\u2019s her deep voice, and all that, she took -- she took control over some of the\ngirls in one of the rooms, and was made immediately an Stubendienst in charge of one room.\nAfter awhile they made her charge of the whole half of the barrack. And then she asked me -- yet\n-- but I went out to work. She asked me if I would like to stay with her, and to help. And I\nrefused, because I thought I ge -- don\u2019t want to deal with people. That\u2019s about it. I didn\u2019t know\nhow horrible the outer work really --",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t want to deal with people? What is --",
        "A: Yeah, I did not want to deal with people, to be in command of people.",
        "Q: Ah, aha.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Because you would have to do things you didn\u2019t --",
        "A: I -- I -- I simply -- it was not -- I did -- I have no desire, yeah, to tell people what to do, or to\ndistribute food, or -- I didn\u2019t like it. I wanted to go out to work, and come back and sleep, yeah.\nIn -- but, then I had an accident, a -- a whole chimney -- while we were demolishing houses\noutdoors, an old chimney was falling on my back, and I felt very bad, and I had enough. So I\napproached somebody in charge of work detail, of the -- the -- one of the women of\nRavensbrick, an German political prisoner, to help me to stay indoors, and if she could, arrange\nsomething. If somebody would believe that [indecipherable] and that\u2019s my profession. And --\nbecause I still didn\u2019t wanted to stay with Katya, yeah. I didn\u2019t wanted to become a blockelteste,\nit\u2019s too [indecipherable] or whatever. I simply had no desire. It would have been nice if under\nnormal conditions, but not there, where you had to be rough, or not even rough, but you had to\nscream, and you had to push people, and all right, that was it. Katya, I refused to help her. But\nthe other one, whom I approached, she helped me, and put me into -- into charge of -- s-some\npainting --",
        "Q: The painting.",
        "A: -- the red stripes. That story of the red stripes you have, correct?",
        "Q: Right, right, yes. But I want to -- I want to go back a -- a little bit. When -- when you first\narrived into Auschwitz one.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: Did you go -- you went into barrack 10, or barrack nine?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: One of th --",
        "A: Upper -- upper part of barrack nine. Which -- all upper parts, which most people don\u2019t know,\nadministratively, there\u2019s A barracks, and the lower part --",

        "Q: A.",
        "A: Now, block nine, barrack nine was down, and barrack nine A on top, first floor\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: Mm-hm. I see.",
        "A: And 10 the same, and eight the same, the upper ones, they are always the A one. So early\nwritings will mention the A numbers [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And that means the upper, that means --",
        "A: Yeah, the extra floors in Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: The upper one was always an A -- A -- A [indecipherable] always an A.",
        "Q: Right. Now you mentioned to me that when you first arrived, it was clear that nobody knew\nhow to organize this camp --",
        "A: Nobody.",
        "Q: -- that it was completely chaotic. It\u2019s --",
        "A: Extremely chaotic.",
        "Q: And wh --",
        "A: Extremely, because --",
        "Q: As if they weren\u2019t expecting people?",
        "A: Who -- who sh -- who expect the people? They never -- people coming in by the thousands?\nAn transport consisted of thousand men or women, yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They were used to have first people -- prisoners from jails, yeah. Poles, or Germans, who\nwere transferred out of ja -- from jails to the camp. But never transports of certain groups by the\nthousands. And they were -- th --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: Tape number one, side B, September seventh, with Sippy Tichauer in New York City. Okay,\nSo -- so they were not expecting, except sort of normal prisoner movement?",
        "A: Correct. And that was the first time that the a-a-ar -- arisar -- RSHA --",
        "Q: H-A.",
        "A: -- transports arrived to Auschwitz, yeah. The very first time, so they had no idea how to go\nabout, and were trying to leave everything to the ex -- to the prisoners from Ravensbrtick, who\nwere specially brought over to Auschwitz to help to organize, because they had experience,\nwhile spending many years prior to that transf -- transfer to Auschwitz, in Ravensbrick. But\neven they were not trained, or prepared for such mass influx of prisoners. So they depended\npractically on whatever we created there by ourselves.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: If people were -- and -- and the prisoners who became, or who wanted to be in charge, they\nhad no experience of handling people, or the -- not at schools, they were not teachers, there were\nno -- so they\u2019re just ordinary house girls, yeah. Never with an -- hardly professionals. Some of\nthem had training in -- in office work, yeah. They succeeded because eventually the SS started to\norganize, together with the prisoners. I mean, food -- food had to be distributed. They didn\u2019t\nknow how to go about that. So they had to learn how to distribute food, they had to learn by -- by\nexperience, day by day, how to go about everything. So, it was not easy, it was in horrible chaos\nfor weeks, and weeks, and weeks. And eventually, after months, when the relocation of the\nwomen, in August \u00b044 -- no, \u201942, occurred, th-the relocation to Birkenau, it was still cow --\nchaotic, but people were already used to it. Roll call was -- lasted hours. The SS was never\ntrained, they were not very intelligent people. Very simple, primitive people, and they s --\nexpected that the inmates will do the job, but the inmates were not trained for such an -- a bi --\nbig masses of people to handle. They -- I mean, if that would have been -- in the men\u2019s camp, in\nAuschwitz, it was different. See, you had the prisoners, the male prisoners, were all ex-Polish\nofficers, yeah. They knew how to handle their troops, how to control. They were obey -- they\nobeyed commands, because they were treating each other still like in the army. But that was the\ndifference of the Polish male, and the older German male, of prisoners, and the women, yeah.\nNot because they were more capable, but it was an different background, yeah. We had -- many\nof the Poles were soldiers, ex-soldiers. The Germans were ex-soldiers too, or had military\ntraining, or had the -- were -- for example, we had a lot of s -- people who were in the Spanish\nCivil War, amongst the Germans. So they had -- there wa -- th-there was no problem with the\nGerman male -- male pr -- with the -- the male prisoners in Auschwitz. But the problem occurred\nonly among the women, because they had no -- no military training.",
        "Q: So that when you were in Auschwitz one --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- what\u2019s going on with the men is totally different from what\u2019s going on with the women?",
        "A: Yeah, definitely. And there was no contact, and that there was an policy from the first day on,\nthat if there is any job which a woman can do, in the woman\u2019s camp, or the woman\u2019s section,\nthan the woman had -- will have preference. But if they don\u2019t find a woman, then a male will be\nbrought over to do the job, yeah. And that\u2019s how I got my job, because I had a male profession. I\nwas the only male -- woman in -- in -- in my country, in my profession, and when they were\nlooking for somebody who could mix paint out of raw material, and produce those red stripes on\nthe clothing, which I explained in prior interviews with you, they preferred me, because I was a\nwoman who worked with -- perform in the woman\u2019s camp. If they wouldn\u2019t have found\nanybody, then the male would have brought.",
        "Q: He would have done it.",
        "A: They would have brought in a -- a man to do the work. So that was the difference. I -- now\nyou understand why we had such an hard life in the beginning.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Not because we were women, we had -- we had no military training, that\u2019s what I want to say.",
        "Q: Sippy, around the area in Auschwitz one, where you -- where the women were staying --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- was there a barbed wire around it?",
        "A: No, a wall was built.",
        "Q: A wall?",
        "A: A wall was built. We -- we were located in todays blocks from one to 10.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, after 10 comes 11, th-the black wall. There were the women. And then, between us,\nparallel with those -- with the whole row, there was an wall erected.",
        "Q: I brought -- I brought so --",
        "A: [Il show you that on the map, if you like.",
        "Q: Yeah, maybe we\u2019|l do it later.",
        "A: Uh-huh. Let me see if I can see. What have you marked here, neela?",
        "Q: That\u2019s what I marked, I marked what I think is the women\u2019s camp.",
        "A: Now, where\u2019s from one to 11?",
        "Q: Here.",
        "A: Where\u2019s 11?",
        "Q: 11 is here.",
        "A: Good. The wall was here.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And when we left, they removed the wall.",
        "Q: They removed the wall. So you had, presumably, your own kitchen?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a separate kitchen, or --",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: -- it\u2019s all coming -- the food is coming from the kitchen -- the same kitchen.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t tell you that, because I really couldn\u2019t te -- no, no, the kitchen was not an separate\nkitchen.",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t?",
        "A: No. There was no kitchen on the map, either.",
        "Q: Right, right. Now, did you get somehow registered those first couple of weeks, or what did\nthey do? They --",
        "A: No, we were -- were registered very soon.",
        "Q: You were registered very soon?",
        "A: Very soon. I would say even after two days or so, only we were not tattooed --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- straight away, but they have then -- we were registered. They thought we were with that\nlittle apparatus where they press the numbers in.",
        "Q: And it didn\u2019t last.",
        "A: Which disappeared after awhile, and then we had to do it with the double needle. I explained\nthat to you many times, right?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, we were registered, definitely.",
        "Q: And the registration was on paper, and they also gave you some -- some -- the insignia\n[indecipherable] nothing",
        "A: The registration was all -- that was an experienced -- experienced situation because the\nGerman concentration camp registration goes back to old times, so if you had here an couple of\nwomen were asked several questions, and you received your number, of course, and you\nreceived -- so that number you carry through the rest of your stay in the camp.",
        "Q: And you had to sew this on your --",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Did you have to sew it on? Sew. You have to sew it?",
        "A: Sure. And th-this -- you see, we had in the beginning, Russian uniforms, you know that.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: From there the Russian prisoners of war. See --",
        "Q: And these were pants and a shirt?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Striped?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Striped?",
        "A: No, no, no, no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: The Russians --",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t --",
        "A: The Russian soldiers 1n striped uniform?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Oh look, think.",
        "Q: No, I\u2019m assuming they didn\u2019t, but I don\u2019t know. When you say Russian uniforms, what is it --\nwhat --",
        "A: Russian uniform from --",
        "Q: The ar --",
        "A: -- their prisoners of war. Prisoners --",
        "Q: So they\u2019re army uniforms.",
        "A: Army uniforms, yeah.",
        "Q: And were they heavy, were they light?",
        "A: No, they were light, pretty light. So -- the Russian uniforms were cloths of cotton, yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And -- but they were sh-small, because they have used some disinfecting technique which\nwas shrinking.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: A steaming, yeah?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Even the steaming -- steaming of -- facilities are still there in Auschwitz, in Birkenau, if you\ngo for a visit.",
        "Q: The -- the big one at the --",
        "A: In the back.",
        "Q: The wa -- in the back.",
        "A: Yeah, even the machine\u2019s there.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And everything which went in are shrinking. No, anyhow, we had those uniforms, and when\nthe uniforms -- when the influx of prisoners -- of newcomers, was so big that the Russian\nuniforms wouldn\u2019t last, then they introduced civilian clotheses of people who brought their stuff.\nThey have taken all the stuff away. The good things went over to -- transported to Germany, and\nthe less good ones were distributed for newcomers. And they have -- they had to be marked with\nthe red stripes, and there where my career started, by mixing the paint and painting the stripes.\nThat was the beginning --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- of my real artistic --",
        "Q: Your career.",
        "A: -- career.",
        "Q: No, we\u2019ll get that for a minute. Di -- were you able to keep your shoes?",
        "A: Yes, because every times they were -- somebody wanted to take my shoes away, especially\nwith the German women, stopped me constantly, and they wanted to take my shoes off, because\nthey looked so good and heavy. But they always too small, I had a small foot, and a small\nnumber, and not one of the German women was lucky enough. So I kept those shoes.",
        "Q: So this was good for you. This was --",
        "A: Oh boy, that saved my life in the beginning, in spite of the fact that in -- outdoor work, we\nwere not allowed to march to the workplace with shoes, you had to go barefoot. You could only\nuse the shoes during working time.",
        "Q: Why were they doing that?",
        "A: You ask me why? Ask me why.",
        "Q: And did you have to take them off when you walked back?",
        "A: Carrying -- carrying the shoes with you, forward, and backward. What 1s it? Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: How soon did they try to tattoo you with a -- those -- that ink stuff that --",
        "A: Which one?",
        "Q: The first time. And it --",
        "A: Soon, very soon.",
        "Q: Soon.",
        "A: Very soon.",
        "Q: But I want to know something. Were they tattooing the men, or were they experiment --",
        "A: No --",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: the men were tattooed.",
        "Q: They were?",
        "A: They were tattooing the men, and then the men were coming over to us, and started to tattoo\nus.",
        "Q: So how come it didn\u2019t work? They had men there for a long time. How come it --",
        "A: Wait a minute, wait a minute. They never used those stamp for the men, yeah. They only\nstarted us to stamp. Somebody of the SS had an idea.",
        "Q: That this would be easier or something?",
        "A: Yeah. Bang, bang. But it didn\u2019t work.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Then they have send us s-some man to do the tattooing. I was tattooed by -- by a man who --\nwhom -- who 1s still alive. I know him.",
        "Q: And you asked him to do a nice --",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: You asked him to do a nice tattoo, yes?",
        "A: And I told him to make me a smaller tattoo.",
        "Q: Small, right.",
        "A: He was my second cousin, so he obeyed.",
        "Q: Were you surprised when Katya sort of started supervising in this room, given how frightened\nshe was before? D-Did her behavior in the beginning surprise you, that she was --",
        "A: That she --",
        "Q: Started -- took over like this.",
        "A: That she had leadership qualities, yeah.",
        "Q: Yes, was that surprising?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t?",
        "A: No, no. No, she was coming from a non-Jewish background, from an different world, yeah. I\ndidn\u2019t know her background, but I knew that she -- she was good in -- in managing. She was\nmanagement trade. I think I realized that she was trained in management, yeah.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. And she was mo -- good bookkeeper. She had an good background, and she put -- she\nhad so -- understanding of American bookkeeping, yeah. For her to prepare a new system of roll\ncalls, was nothing else like the knowledge of American bookkeeping.",
        "Q: What do you mean she came from a non-Jewish background, I thought she was Jewish.",
        "A: She was -- she had no Jewish education.",
        "Q: Uh-uh, but her parents were Jewish? Or somebody was Jewish.",
        "A: It\u2019s -- we don\u2019t know that.",
        "Q: We don\u2019t -- I see.",
        "A: I have -- she did not know anything about Judaism.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. But you had told me a long time ago that she was Jewish.",
        "A: She was Jewish.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Is it the case -- this -- this 1t seems -- this I wrote down somewhere, that who -- well,\nlet me ask it this way, who was in charge of the outside commandos? Was it different from the\npeople who were in charge of the inside commandos in the beginning?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. If you have, first of all, the whole structure, you must understand\nthat you had an -- the SS structure, from top to bottom, was a military -- military-like business,\nor managerial-like business. You had top management, you had middle management, you had\nlower management.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And each SS level had their inmate assistance, yeah?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, if it comes to work, yeah, is a section of inside and outside work, belonged to the German\nexpression I\u2019m going to use, the Abbatz einsatz. The work sec -- the section of -- which a-\narranged your employment, yeah, it was like an employment office, where there was an SS man\nin charge, and an assistant, which was always of -- an inmate. The inmate had to expedite the\norders of his the -- the SS person who receives the order from my level, or from -- or from, yeah,\nhigher level of s -- he -- of -- I mean, on higher authority, which was negotiating this private\ncompanies, for work -- for -- for wer -- manpower. If an factory needed workers, 500 women, for\nexample, especially women, they have asked for it, then it went over to the top man of the SS.\nHe was giving the order to the camp, a representative of his command of work det -- work work,\nlike an department of work, an office where you -- where you apply for work, yeah? Or an office\nwhich is -- I don\u2019t know the American word of comparison, a civilian comparison --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- but it\u2019s an department of work. You have -- say you have --",
        "Q: So, like an employment office.",
        "A: It\u2019s like an employment office. We have had in our bu -- camp office, an section of after the\nregistration of the newcomers, which went by profession, yeah? So if they were looking for\npeople who could sew, or tailors, they need 50 tailors for an factory, they have coming to us --",
        "Q: To find -- to get them.",
        "A: -- that we had the -- the registered people under this -- under -- the women who were telling\nus when they were registered they were tailors, yeah, or dressmakers. So we had our section by\nprofession. We had [indecipherable] by profession. We had the [indecipherable] and the -- so\nwhere -- where am I now, I\u2019m not -- I\u2019m lost. What was the question?",
        "Q: Well, I w -- I -- I think I was -- I was asking a question before the camp office is actually\nformulated. I\u2019m trying to get some idea of --",
        "A: Of who was in charge of the indoor and the outdoor.",
        "Q: Yeah. In the be -- in -- before you had the camp office, before it beca -- becomes more\nordered.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: I\u2019m trying to figure out the kind of chaos that you\u2019re describing.",
        "A: So yes, the chaos was settled gradually, by introducing the old German concentration camp\nsystem of abbatz dinkst, and abbatz einsatz.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: Two people -- two SS sections, which were dealing with -- with like an employment office,\nand the office was supplied --",
        "Q: The people.",
        "A: The people. Now, if they needed 500 road workers, they were just asking for 500 women next\nmorning, to be ready to march out. And then they were just taking the people from the barracks,\nand --",
        "Q: Right, right, right.",
        "A: -- put 500 together, and off they went. But that went always first to the SS commander, who\nasks them his counterpart of the inmate who was in charge of those [indecipherable] and -- and --\nand the work -- work force, yeah, office. Now we have no words -- I mean I\u2019m -- it\u2019s very hard\nto compare something with our civilian life, and our civilian structure. I\u2019m trying to be --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- as simple as possible, and to make the comparison, so it should go into your head.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But does it answer the question?",
        "Q: Yeah, well let me ask -- let me ask it in another way. When -- when you\u2019re talking about these\nfirst few months, including the time you\u2019re going out --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- on the demolition crews.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What\u2019s the effect on you and the women in b -- in it being so chaotic?",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "Q: Nothing?",
        "A: Nothing. We -- we knew in the morning there were -- if you were in on work detail -- on\nconstant work detail, and the SS leader of the work detail, because each work detail had an SS\nleader, too, in charge, if he was happy with you, he ask for you, and you --",
        "Q: Again? I see.",
        "A: -- you reported every time -- every morning to the same group of work detail. If you didn\u2019t\nwanted to go, then you were not going, yeah? Nobody -- they never knew where you are, and it\nwasn\u2019t big to [indecipherable] what is said on big, big [indecipherable] in the morning after roll\ncall, the formation of work details. So they just grabbed the people, and --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: 500 here, and 600 here, and 30 here, and that went e-every day the hunt, it was just like a\nhunt, yeah. I -- well --",
        "Q: What was the -- what was the name of that -- the soldier who gave you an aspirin after you\u2019d\ninjured your [indecipherable]",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know his name, but rank was --",
        "Q: You told me it was --",
        "A: -- finner his rank was an finnerish in German.",
        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s his rank?",
        "A: Yeah, because --",
        "Q: I thought that\u2019s is his name.",
        "A: I tell you why, I tell you why.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The inmate who was an kapo, a German woman, is her name there, Elli -- Elli Meyer?",
        "Q: Yes, the -- some -- I have it somewhere, yes.",
        "A: She called him her finnerish. Now, she could not know his name, or you never a-addressed\nsome SS person by his name, yeah. You called the SS people by their ranks. And that was the\nusual thing. So when she said to him a finneri, it couldn\u2019t be his name, it was his rank.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t know what\u2019s an finneri, you have to look that up in an German dictionary --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- what an finneri means.",
        "Q: But he got you an aspirin?",
        "A: And not only that he got me an aspirin, he grabbed -- he took me in his arms, and put me on\nan -- on an pile of -- of straw, high, yeah. And was looking into his pockets for something, and\ntook an aspirin. He didn\u2019t even know that you have to take an Bayer aspirin with water.",
        "Q: And you went into the infirmary?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And is that when this S -- you s -- were next to an SS woman, and she hit you?",
        "A: They hit me -- they hit -- she hit me, and --",
        "Q: Because you were next to her?",
        "A: Because what?",
        "Q: Because you were next to her, or she just --",
        "A: She was standing there, in front of the entrance of the infirmary, and she was hitting\neverybody, but she caught -- she hit me badly, and I knew who she was. She was hanged in\nBergen-Belsen, and yeah, yeah, yeah. One of he -- her name was Viningher. Folkenrat --\nFolkenrat. Her maiden name was Viningher. Anyway ---",
        "Q: Viningher was her -- her ma --",
        "A: No, she was Folkenrat --",
        "Q: Folkenrat?",
        "A: She was known as Folkenrat, yeah. In any case, she was hitting me, and I never returned, and\nthat saved my life.",
        "Q: Because you left?",
        "A: Because I left. Because those people who were admitted, were -- never made it to Birkenau\nduring the relocation. So I -- I left, and then I approached another German woman, and told her\nabout my profession.",
        "Q: So, is this -- what -- approximately how many months were you doing this demolition work, a\nfew months?",
        "A: Demolition work I did, I would say til end of May.",
        "Q: Til the end of May. And then you went, and you said that you have this profession, yeah.",
        "A: Enough is enough, and I went -- she was in the lager aredest, her name was Ava Weigl, an\nwoman from Berlin, and I told her --",
        "Q: And it\u2019s W-e-1-g-l, right?",
        "A: W-e-1-g-l, yeah. Now, she said, \u201cI -- look, I know what your profession is, because my\nhusband,\u201d or my lover, whoever he was, \u201chas the same profession in Berlin.\u201d Now, a couple of\ndays later, she comes -- wait -- yeah. But she said, \u201cStay at home, don\u2019t go out to work, and if the\nSS woman Drexel,\u201d was then in charge of the roll call, \u201cif she would ask you why you are at\nhome, just tell her that Ava asked me to stay at home, because she has an job for me in the\nmaking.\u201d Now --",
        "Q: So was that where you recuperated, then? You just --",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: How did you recuperate?",
        "A: That was all.",
        "Q: That was it?",
        "A: That was it.",
        "Q: You just stayed there.",
        "A: I had -- I had no time to recuperate, I have been fighting for my life. It was -- I was badly,\nbadly hit.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: In any case, next -- four days later, one of the top SS men was coming and looking for\nsomebody who can mix paint, and all that, so custom that -- 1t was custom tailored for me, that\njob, yeah.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And in between newcomers were coming 1n, and the -- the Russian uniform were going to an\nend, and so those clotheses were -- had to be marked with red stripes. So that was quite an career,\nit started this way, and it was an coincident, everything, that I spoke German, that I approached\nher, and she --",
        "Q: At the right time.",
        "A: At the right time.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to stop the tape now, so --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: This is the end of tape number one, side B with Sippy Tichauer.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number two, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Helen\nTichauer, conducted on September seventh, 2000, in New York City, with Joan Ringleheim. I\nthink we\u2019re okay here. Sippy, why -- first of all, who was it who wanted you to paint the red\nstripe, 1s it --",
        "A: I beg your pardon?",
        "Q: Who was the SS who wanted the red stripe?",
        "A: It was Aumeier.",
        "Q: And you spell that A-u-w, or A-u-m-e-y-e-r?",
        "A: No. You can look him up. I think it\u2019s A-u-m-e-1-e-r.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, e-r. Okay, Pll look that up.",
        "A: But you can look that up again. He was sentenced --",
        "Q: Why did he have -- wa -- oh, go ahead.",
        "A: Why did he what?",
        "Q: Why this idea of the red stripe?",
        "A: Ah. You see, people who are working outdoors in the fields, or wherever, if they wear civilian\nclothes, then they could have been taken for any civilian person. If they escape, they would have\nbeen able to mingle among the civilians, and nobody would have known who they are. But being\nmarked with an special red stripe, the -- even the male -- male prisoners, who some of them, the\nofficials had no stripe th -- on upper clothing, they had the dark blue jackets, yeah, at wintertime,\nor some of them had -- yeah, dark blue jackets, they had the red stripes in the center of their\njacket, so to be recognized as an inmate. That was very, very known in the -- in the system of --\nof concentration camp inmates, the red stripe --",
        "Q: Suits?",
        "A: They were marked with the red stripes from top -- from top to bottom, yeah.",
        "Q: So this was sort of typical in the concentration camp system?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It was.",
        "A: Right. If you had something which was not --",
        "Q: A uniform.",
        "A: -- striped --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- then it had to be marked --",
        "Q: Marked.",
        "A: -- to be recognized as inmate.",
        "Q: So -- so tell --",
        "A: Sometimes the pants on the sides were marked with red stripes, yeah. And women, well we\nhad to distribute to the newcomers, civilian clothes, had to be marked so to distinguish them\nbetween civilians and -- and inmates. It was --",
        "Q: So tell me --",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Go ahead.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: So te-tell me what sort of paint did you use, so that it would adhere to the cloth?",
        "A: P-P-Paint which does not -- which does not dissolve in water. Some kind of oil paint with an\ndrying agent, to -- to -- to dry quick enough, yeah.",
        "Q: H-How long did it take you to figure out what -- how to put this paint together?",
        "A: To what?",
        "Q: How long did it take you to figure out how to put the paint together so that it would work, or\ndid you know --",
        "A: I didn\u2019t need to figure out, I --",
        "Q: You knew?",
        "A: -- have been an trained painter. That was part of our training.",
        "Q: And who came up with the color red?",
        "A: They.",
        "Q: They came up with it?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It didn\u2019t glow in the dark, did it?",
        "A: No. In those days they -- they were not devel -- they had not developed the colors which are\ngl -- no, we -- we have developed that glowing business very, very late.",
        "Q: Late, yes, right.",
        "A: Yeah. Pretty late.",
        "Q: So when -- when you first -- when you first developed this, did you -- were you the only\nperson who was painting the stripes?",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hm.",
        "Q: So how many women do you think you did in a day?",
        "A: Oh, everyone who had a stripe was ready to go to work. Those who had no stripes, couldn\u2019t\ngo. The others in dozens, by the hundreds, yeah one, two, three, from top to bottom down.",
        "Q: And would this happen at the end of a registration process? Is that where -- or where would it\nhappen?",
        "A: No, it happened even before the registration, the moment you received your dress. It depends.\nSometimes they had -- so they were selected for work, or for work detail, and they were standing\nthere, and I had to go from one to -- to -- from one to -- and to -- from one to the next, and do the\nwhole [indecipherable] the whole group, and then some -- and when there were no people after\nth -- after they went out to work, during the day I had -- I -- I had to do the stripes in the store,\nand prepare that for the next person who received that dress of -- as a newcomer, yeah. So, I had\nto make things in stock at the beg -- at the -- under -- in the s-stores, where those dresses were\nprepared for newcomers, that I did during the day, and -- and when -- when there were -- were\nnot enough, and we had more people to go out for work than we could paint. And supplies, oh, I\nhad to do that while standing in -- in -- before -- standing outdoors, and I had to do that on their\nbody.",
        "Q: You mean when they had the --",
        "A: But -- yes, but --",
        "Q: -- when they had the clothes on?",
        "A: -- they started -- I started actually to do that in the store, in the store.",
        "Q: So they would already get clothes with the paint on it, all right.",
        "A: And they would get the clothes -- clothes wi-with the stripes, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: So, did this start happening before you moved to Birkenau? Before August?",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.",
        "Q: So, in May? May - June?",
        "A: It started very soon, very soon. The moment we had no more Russian uniforms to supply,\nthen the -- some of the Russians uniforms appeared again, because people were killed in the gas,\nand we received the business back, only the numbers had to be removed, because they were the\nnumbers of the dead people.",
        "Q: Dead people, yeah. So, Sippy, during this time --",
        "A: Mm?",
        "Q: -- they were gassing in Auschwitz one?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: During this time --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- before you moved to Birkenau --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- they\u2019re -- they are gassing in Auschwitz one?",
        "A: That, no, no.",
        "Q: They\u2019re not?",
        "A: They were gassing in Birkenau.",
        "Q: But that in --",
        "A: [indecipherable] house. Huh?",
        "Q: No, no. But before you moved to Birkenau --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- between March and August, 1s there --",
        "A: See, it was --",
        "Q: -- are there some gassings?",
        "A: -- it was -- there were rumors, but we -- we had no proof. We didn\u2019t know. We had no --",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t know?",
        "Q: No, we didn\u2019t. We knew that non-Jews were gassed, too, but I can\u2019t -- we -- we don\u2019t know\nwhere they were gassed, yeah. We had no sondercommando in our switzwan. So that\u2019s why we\nsuspected that even if they have gas in our switzwan, the corpse were not burned in our\nswitzwan. They were sent -- take to Birkenau, yeah, and to -- burned in open pits, or wherever.\nBut they did not -- there were -- there were never people from the sondercommando working in\nAuschwitz one.",
        "Q: Auschwitz one.",
        "A: They only burned the people -- non-Jewish people who died, and then supplied the urns to\ntheir relatives, yeah. They were dead people, not gassed people.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So that is an whole story which has to be explored, and to -- read, how they have developed\ntheir killing process in Auschwitz one, and then later in Birkenau. But all I know is that non-\nJews were gassed, too, yeah, in the beginning.",
        "Q: In the beginning, right.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Did you believe the rumors?",
        "A: Of course, we -- we knew that they were gassed, because we received their clothes in -- back\nin the -- after the gassing, with their numbers.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t think they just died?",
        "A: [indecipherable] just died --",
        "Q: You assumed it was too ma --",
        "A: -- you see, in the beginning it was very hard to -- to control and check rus -- what really\nhappened, because there was no even interest in, or -- I mean, we had no need to distinguish one\nfrom the other. If they were non-Jews, then they have returned to earth with some dirt, so they\nare not even the ashes. But otherwise, I have -- I had very little interest in the whole business,\nbecause we have learned of the gassing pretty late, yeah. And -- then later, while in Birkenau,\nand while I had been engaged, and I received an drawing office in the camp office, and I was\nengaged to pr -- to produce some diagrams with all the movements in the camp -- in the women\u2019s\ncamp. He said I had to produce those diagrams who were then sent over to Berlin. It was only\nthen that I became more interest in the gassing process, because I had to register the daily\ngassing of women in the camp. And that, I re -- I had reported every -- every end of the month I\nreceived some daily reports of those gassings, and had to enter that on the diagram. So that\u2019s\nwhy I knew about it, and why sometimes we had to -- the people who were already pre --\nprepared us, or -- not prepared, but people who were decided o-of their killing, through gas, were\nstill alive while I already had to enter them on my diagram as -- as dead people, yeah. That\nwasn\u2019t -- that wasn\u2019t bad, the hardest part of it was between the selections in -- in -- in those\nselections, yeah, not of newcomers, but those who were living in the camp. The selections, the\ntransfer to the gas chamber, it took sometimes on whole, maybe 12 hours, but in advance, we\nalready had to register them as dead, because they were not alive any more, was in the trans-\ntransfer process. It\u2019s very hard to explain, and hard to -- to bel -- to -- to understand the --\npsychologically how hard it was on my system. Couldn\u2019t do much.",
        "Q: Can you explain how hard it was on you?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Can you explain how hard it was on you to do that?",
        "A: Who?",
        "Q: How hard it was for you to do that?",
        "A: Could you speak a little bit louder?",
        "Q: Can you explain how hard it was for you to do this? What did it do to you?",
        "A: Hard that you had -- that you have known the people are still alive, and they were registered\nalready, had to be registered already for the next day\u2019s dead, yeah. It -- that is hard to explain,\nyeah. Just like I would say compare with you have in front of you, people who are dying, yeah?\nYou only don\u2019t know when they are going to die, but they are in the stage of dying. You feel\nvery strange while you are still here in front of you the living body, and you know they may be\ndead tomorrow, or after tomorrow, but they are already in -- theoretically, in your mind, dead.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: That is more or less the -- the same situation.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But did you ever have anything like that?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah? You see -- and if you have masses of people, even if you have -- didn\u2019t know them, but\nyou have an group of people by the hundreds, yeah, sometimes even healthy ones, and here they\nare, already dead on paper, and they\u2019re standing outside still on the -- on -- on th -- on the\nground, and are still alive and breathing, and -- and -- and don\u2019t know that they\u2019re going to be\ndead tomorrow, yeah. That was hard. And just -- just like with an dying person who -- whom you\nknow, and who -- where you know he is going to die, but he doesn\u2019t know, yeah? Or she doesn\u2019t\nknow.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And it\u2019s sometimes just a question of hours. Niya, is that an comparison?",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah, I think so.",
        "A: Good.",
        "Q: But let me go back to the painting for a moment.",
        "A: To what?",
        "Q: Painting. The painting of the stripe.",
        "A: Oh, you are an artist all of a sudden.",
        "Q: I want to know f -- you did it for a certain amount of time alone?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And then you brought in one woman, two women? Other people did it as well?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No? Only you?",
        "A: Only me, because I knew -- I knew how to -- to paint, how to mix the paint from raw material,\nyeah. That was on -- something you had to learn in -- as an professional, and not to -- like an\nhousewife who can cook. Within -- it was the difference like between an chef, and the primitive\npeasant woman, both could cook, yeah?",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: But the difference how to cook, is between an chef and then -- and then any -- any housewife\ncan cook, right, or learn to cook, now --",
        "Q: But you weren\u2019t the only one who put the stripe --",
        "A: Yes, I was it.",
        "Q: You was?",
        "A: Later on --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- when I was entrusted with -- of the printing of the numbers --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I trained some other people to do the stripes, but 1t was me who mixed the colors.",
        "Q: Always.",
        "A: The paint, yeah.",
        "Q: Right. And for how long was this done?",
        "A: All the time.",
        "Q: All the time. So, if someone did not wear a uniform, the striped uniform which was common,\nthey always had the red stripe.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: But you said that you never had the red stripe?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: But yours would re -- you -- yours would come off in the rain? You -- yes?",
        "A: I did my red stripes with water -- on a water bases, so that it would come off, in case I would\nlike to remove it. And I did it before we went on the Dead March, yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Then I got myself a new coat from the [indecipherable] yeah, on other -- on coat, on warm\ncoat, I painted the red stripe, which came off in no time, and I was prepared for any situation,\nyeah.",
        "Q: Okay. So let\u2019s -- let\u2019s talk about the camp office.",
        "A: The camp office?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Which camp office? Now listen very carefully. I have here --",
        "Q: Not the stopskaboida.",
        "A: Uh?",
        "Q: Not the stopskaboida. Yours. Your office.",
        "A: What are you saying? Not what?",
        "Q: Not the stopskaboida.",
        "A: Now wait a wi -- wait a minute. I have an dilemma.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: There is an group of people who worked, the secretaries for SS people.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: As secretaries for the Gestapo. Each Gestapo man had one woman who worked -- was his\nsecretary, whom he -- whom had to -- who was forewarned not to disclose anything what they\nare doing, otherwise they are going to be shot. It was an -- you must understand, and you will not\nunderstand, but nevertheless, Auschwitz and Birkenau had sub-camps -- so-called sub-camps.\nNow, to make you -- give you an idea, those sub-camps, in our English language they are sub-\ncamps, but there is no German word for it, yeah. The German system of the camp in Birkenau\nand Auschwitz, in the German language, in their own language, had two types of sub-camps,\nyeah. That is now hard to explain, but there is no -- again, no word for sub-camps. They were --\nif I would like -- if you would like me to translate that by the wording, I\u2019m going to give you the\nGerman name. There was one type of camp which was -- one type of sub-camps, which was\ncalled a branch camp, Zweig lager, and Zweig, Z-w-e-1-g, 1s a branch of a tree, yeah?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: For example.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then there was an other type of camps, of sub-camps, which were called Abschnitts\nlager, A-b-s-c-h-n-1-t-t-s, Abschnitts lager, that means -- abschnitts -- I don\u2019t know what -- what\nit means in English. It\u2019s not always wise to translate exactly, because sometimes you get some\nstupid results out of it. But lets call the other one sub-camp, yeah? Okay?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: An Abschnitts mean -- would -- I would even say section, yeah? So whatever it is, it is still an\nsub-camp.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Only, but we don\u2019t -- but you and all other big shots don\u2019t know, is that one of those two were\nalways -- the one will belong to one -- the one group, even if they were allocated two yards from\nthe crematorium, belonged to an -- to heads of privilege -- privilege, in -- in commas, yeah?",
        "Q: Quotes.",
        "A: In quotes. Not to be exposed for gassing. As a matter of fact, they were forbidden to gas the\npeople who belonged to those camps. While those who were part of the section -- what I\u2019m\ncalling section, underwent selections and could have got -- been gassed. Now comes an example,\nokay?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Let\u2019s go to the women\u2019s camp.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Harmense, Boody, Ricekoff, Shtopskaboida, B-Beetoogee, were all privileged branch camps.\nThere\u2019s no history in the Auschwitz -- there\u2019s no -- no example in the whole Auschwitz women\u2019s\ncamp history, that there was ever a selection in those sub-camps, which I am calling an branch --\nbranch camp. Never, there was never in the whole history, an selection in Ricekoff, or in\nHarmense, or in Boody, or in the Shtopskiboidi, or --",
        "Q: Beetoogee.",
        "A: In Beetoogee. That is the [indecipherable] camp, which was next, between crematorium five\nand four. Good. While the other branch, or the other category of s -- of what am I calling --",
        "Q: Don\u2019t do that.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Don\u2019t touch that.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You could be gassed.",
        "A: Could be gassed, there were selections going on. For example, to that group belonged the\nsealava, yeah, b-b-b-B1C, B2B -- B -- B1 -- B2B, that was a Czech camp, was a Gypsy camp.\nThe C lagers of Czech camps, the Gypsy camp, both camps -- both parts of the women\u2019s camp,\nB1A and B1B, but they were -- that was a -- no, that was -- forget about BIA and B1B, that was\nthe main women\u2019s camp, and all others belonged to us, to BIA, and B1B, up to the women\u2019s\ncamp. So, I\u2019m giving you here a small example why -- yeah, and they were all administered by\nthe women\u2019s camp -- camp office.",
        "Q: Sections. The section -- what, everything was?",
        "A: Everything, both sections, and had to report every day to the roll call -- for the roll call, to our\ncamp office. We were the leading administrative entity --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- for the women\u2019s camp. It was not the Shtopskaboidas --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- they were an bloody, unimportant, but Laura Shelly brought an -- was giving the\nimpression if they would have been headquarters of everything. They were the SS headquarters,\nyeah. And they -- there was no cola -- col -- cooperation or camaraderie among those SS\nsecretaries, whatsoever. I have no idea how to explain that to the Whitman girl. He\nmisunderstood the whole -- she had -- she was, what you are calling in German, spinning, yeah.\nNow, is that clear, what I explained to you?",
        "Q: Yes, but not --",
        "A: Is that new? Is that new?",
        "Q: Yes, that\u2019s -- that -- you haven\u2019t said that to me before.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: You haven\u2019t said that to me before.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: How else could I have said to you during all those years? But I hope that you understand now,\nbetter than you would have understood 10 years ago.",
        "Q: But explain something to me. Why -- why would there be a group of privileged prisoners\nfrom which there would never be a selection or a gassing? Why?",

        "Q: You don\u2019t know?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. You couldn\u2019t ask any -- that -- you couldn\u2019t ask the system somewhere in\nBerlin why.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It was actually so -- we were so sure that we helped our ca -- our friends to be transferred to\nthose camps.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah. You were two yards away from crematorium five, and were not all -- and were not\ngassed. Where people had to come from Holland, and from France, and I don\u2019t know -- know\nwhere from, to -- to be gassed in that crematorium, while the camp around --",
        "Q: They were not.",
        "A: -- two yards only, had never one case of selection, yeah. And we knew it, but very few in the\ncamp office, maybe it was me and Katya, who knew what the real -- and that why we could help.\nThat why we were transferring friends constantly to those parts of -- of the camp where we knew\nthey will never be exposed to the selection. Okay?",
        "Q: Yeah. So, is --",
        "A: Now, anything to say?",
        "Q: About this?",
        "A: Mm-hm. Is that -- that 1s now -- are you surprised what I told you, no?",
        "Q: Yeah, it\u2019s -- in one sense it\u2019s surprising, in another sense there -- there\u2019s some recognition that\nthere was a certain kind of -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know whether I want to call it protection going on,\nif you had a certain standing. But that it would be particular commandos is a surprise to me. I\nmean, I understood from what you told me, that having been in the camp for x number of years --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- would mean something to the SS.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: No. No, because [indecipherable] so few, that you did -- had no -- that means they didn\u2019t\nknow who -- who was who, if you have an -- that -- what would mean to the SS? The\nheadquarter SS, they can -- they had nothing to do with it.",
        "Q: But in a certain way, this doesn\u2019t make any sense. Do you know what I mean?",
        "A: No, it\u2019s just --",
        "Q: Do you know what I mean? Not that the s -- the system doesn\u2019t make any sense.",
        "A: The whole system didn\u2019t -- the whole system didn\u2019t make any sense. But I\u2019m telling you now\nsomething which was the real -- the real issue, it -- that was it.",
        "Q: So how did you -- how did you know? I mean, at what point did it become clear to you and\nKatya, that these are protected commandos?",
        "A: From the beginning.",
        "Q: From the beginning? Because they didn\u2019t treat those people in the same way they were\ntreating other people?",
        "A: No, we -- we -- we knew -- Katya was close to the top SS woman, o-or man who were in\ncharge. What are you looking for?",
        "Q: I\u2019m just -- because the tape is going to stop.",
        "A: Yeah. No, we knew it. I don\u2019t -- I knew it. I didn\u2019t even investigated why I know it, where\nfrom. I knew it. So --",
        "Q: Okay. Let\u2019s -- let\u2019s stop for a second. This is the end of tape number two, side A.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape number two, side B, with Helen Tichauer, on September seventh.",
        "A: Look, I give you an example. In \u201943, we were tr -- always trying from the beginning, once I\ngot into the -- into the -- with the position of the camp office, how I got into the pen -- office is\nanother story.",
        "Q: Yeah, we\u2019ll talk about that.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But, once I\u2019ve been in, and I have noticed that there are no selections going on over there,\nyeah, in those camps -- in those part of the camp, we have started [indecipherable] I was running\nto Katya, Katya, I need a job, let -- let\u2019s transfer her, let\u2019s do that. So we did it. We have\ntransferred the people to safeguard them, and to save them, yeah, into those comma -- into those\nwork details. And only once in my lifetime, for which I\u2019m even today very unhappy, 1s that very\ngood friends of mine, in the beginning, when everything was still very bad, and the new art\n[indecipherable] work detail in -- of those branch camps were established, and among them, one\nwas called Boody, and I have helped an lot of girls to go to Boody, because we knew it 1s one of\nthe branch camps, and there were never selections in Boody. Unfortunately, some of the German\nkapos started to massacre the Jewish girls. But that had nothing to do with the system, yeah. And\nthere were -- I still have sometimes sleepless nights, because my best friends wouldn\u2019t be helped,\nyeah. They got killed. So what can I tell you? But that\u2019s the only place where they died -- the\nonly time they died prematurely, and they were not killed by the SS. They were killed by\nGerman inmates who were in charge there, as kapos, and so on. You know the story of Boody.\nBut otherwise, you show me one camp -- sub-camp, where there were selections of those I have\nmentioned to you. Never.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I have been, during those couple of weeks in September, hospitalized, because I had\ntyphus, and all kinds of junk in my body. I was very sick.

        "Q: A ditch.",

And so when Stevitz\ntold him that this Mueller want me to -- out, he said, okay, only if I have no fever. So go to the --\nthey commanded me to go over to the hospital station, and there they had to measure my fever,\nmy temperature. Now, I nearly collapsed, but they told me not to worry, because even if I have\nfever, they won\u2019t tell. They took me int -- so they were selecting the people, the whole barracks,\ncomplete, even the blockelteste went. And -- no I don\u2019t think some of the blockelteste -- no, they\n-- no, they left the blockelteste behind. But what happened 1s that -- that Schwartz wacom -- was\ncoming every five minute. Has she fever, or hasn't she? He was so concerned about one person,\nyeah. And they constantly said, she is not ready yet, not ready. They were pumping in me some\nmedication, Bydrian, I remember that, and Anna Weiss was the physician.",
        "Q: Anna Weiss?",
        "A: All -- Olly was there, Gerda Sneider, the whole hospital hierarchy, they just assured me they\nwill not say that I have fever. And finally, when -- when he returned, and everybody was already\ngone, so he was just waiting for me, so when they ask him -- when he asked if I have fever, they\nsaid no, okay? And there was an SS man, who witnessed the whole business inside the hospital\ncompound. And he was coming then, and brought me pen, and a piece of paper, and said sit\ndown and do some drawing, start to work. So I s -- I was totally deaf, and blind, and I couldn\u2019t\nremember the letters, how they looked. I was tot -- look, I was out of the world, with high fever.\nSo I said, \u201cBut I don\u2019t know how the letter looks.\u201d He said, \u201cDo whatever you want.\u201d You know,\nif I would have today be able to keep that, what I draw, it would have been a wonderful analysis\nfor some of those psychiatrists, yeah. The results of my -- the condition, and the results of my\nwhole situation, and what I did. In any case, the moment all everything was gone, I had my --\nyeah, and the SS man said to me, \u201cLook, do anything you want, but just work.\u201d So okay, I did --\nI don\u2019t know what I did, but after awhile the door opens, in comes Katya, and [indecipherable]\nand Drexel, with an sheet of paper in the hand to transfer into the camp office. And that was the\nbeginning of my career. Two months later, Mandel arrived as an oboffsairen, yeah, in charge of\nthe whole camp, and Mandel cat -- was really -- respected me from the first day on, and made\nmy life very tolerable. Her boyfriend was in charge of the bowlightung of the camp -- building\noffice, yeah. And he established me my drawing office. He supplied me with wonderful\ninstruments, and material, and --",
        "Q: What did she see in you?",

        "Q: What did she see in you, do you think? Why --",
        "A: I was the one who was [indecipherable] it\u2019s the only one, and she didn\u2019t know why. The only\none from the whole thousands and thousand of people, yeah. And she couldn\u2019t -- she didn\u2019t know\nwhy.",
        "Q: She didn\u2019t know why.",
        "A: She didn\u2019t know why. But they --",
        "Q: How -- how was she with other people? Was she a very cruel person?",
        "A: She was an very beautiful woman. I wouldn\u2019t say she was cruel, no. But she didn\u2019t like the\nprostitutes, the German prostitutes. She didn\u2019t liked -- she liked -- I don\u2019t know what she liked. I\ndon\u2019t know why she liked me.",
        "Q: But sh -- but she liked you.",
        "A: I will never forget -- yeah, I helped to organize the orchestra too, during -- under her -- under\nher time. When she noticed that I\u2019m artist by profession, that I\u2019m a musician, so she -- she -- and\nI spoke good German, and so once she called me and asked me to put an dedication in an book.\nSo th -- I noticed she made another SS man an birthday present, but normally, I don\u2019t know what\npeople are -- what the SS was giving each other. She made him a present of books. So I was\nstarting to think, yeah, that was one quality which I never expected, yeah. And asking me to put\nan dedication in. And on that day, I noticed -- I said, but [indecipherable] that 1s my birthday too,\nyeah, on the same day. So she said, \u201cOh, so go [indecipherable] you have an sheet of paper, go to\nthe package room, and get yourself the biggest parcel they have.\u201d Yeah. And do you know who\nwas in charge then, already, in the package room? That SS woman who --",
        "Q: Who slapped you?",
        "A: Who so she started to respect me.",
        "Q: You too. What was Drexel like?",
        "A: Ugly. Oy, was she ugly. And she want -- she ask me -- Katya is standing there, and I was\ncoming, and walking, and she called me back. You\u2019re short -- your dresses are too short. I want\nto see you tomorrow with I don\u2019t know how many inches longer, and wanted to hit me. And I\nwas running away. I don\u2019t know what happened to -- she could have shot me, yeah. And Katya\nc-comes later on and said, \u201cSippy, you know she -- she complained that Sippy\u2019s\n[indecipherable].\u201d She was running away from me, and I wanted to hit her. So, I don\u2019t know\nwhat Drexel was. She was -- I noticed that she did selections, she participated in selections,\nwhile Mandel did not. But Mandel once signed an sheet of selected paper, and because of that\nshe was hanged. So.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. [inaudible]",
        "A: Look, it was an very hard -- well, it was very hard to understand, what really went on in the\nmind of the -- that Mandel woman, that she had, as an partner, an h-high official, and an trained -\n- an engineer -- an engineer by profession, or an architect. And she -- as I had mentioned to you,\nthat was an sign of -- on bit of an higher level -- mentally higher level than all others, while\ngiving another SS man a book as an present, yeah, for a birthday. But would -- how would you\nhave judged that? That they were thinking different.",
        "Q: Differently.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: She was from Austria, but with her, I had good luck. In -- at the end of \u201944, there was an\nfriend. The Germans wanted to establish the biggest women\u2019s concentration camp in the world,\nin -- not too far from Dachau, yeah, in Kaufering. And we have heard about it, and Mandel\nshould have become the biggest shot -- big shot of the biggest concentration camp on earth. So\nsh-she selected some of the Auschwitz people which she wanted to take along with her, and\nnobody from the camp office, and nobody knew what\u2019s going to happen, whom she\u2019s going to\ntake. It would have been an advantage, because there would have been no crematorium, yeah. So\nthey prepared a list whom she selected in the camp office. We had one typewriter, and one\nwoman typed the list. So I wanted to know if I am on the list, because it was, after all, an big\nevent to leave Auschwitz, and join the staff of the biggest SS woman in the world. And -- but the\nwoman who produced the list was mean, and didn\u2019t wanted to tell us. So, what am I doing, the\nlist was prepared, and it went to Berlin. And while she was carrying the list to deliver the list, I\nwent into the wastepaper basket, and there were some carbon paper. So I\u2019ve been on the list.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And Katya was on the list?",
        "A: Katya was already gone, because she had an affair with an SS man, and was -- disappeared\nfrom the earth of -- from the face of the earth. Katya was stupid, because I didn\u2019t know that she\nhad the affair. He was coming there to the office to visit, every day. And I went over to Katya,\nand I said, \u201cKatya, who is he? Who is he?\u201d What is -- no, I did-didn\u2019t said who is he. \u201cKatya,\nwhat is he doing here?\u201d She said, \u201cHe\u2019s coming to visit me.\u201d Her. I said, \u201cKatya, that\u2019s an mass\nmurderer.\u201d She looked at me. I noticed him shu -- sh -- killing the people at the black wall, from\nI visited while still in Auschwitz, I went from block nine to block 10. There are still today the\nwooden -- wooden timbers, yeah. But in between the timbers you could look. And I have\nwitnessed the execution of hundreds and hundreds of people, which he performed. And I said to\nher, \u201cKatya, that\u2019s a mass murderer.\u201d She never said anything to me. Our relationship went --\nslowly cooled off, yeah, because of that. And then she was arrested, put into the bunker, and was\nsent away, and he was sent to the front. So nothing really happened between the two of -- he was\nkilled, and she was stupid enough to risk her good life she had. She had an important -- she had\nan important life to car -- to -- to lead in Auschwitz. She could help, she could do a lot of things.\nAnd all for an SS man who was really a mass murderer. But I\u2019m glad that I told her that in my\nlifetime. I was honest enough to forewarn her, yeah.",
        "Q: And what happened to her in the end?",
        "A: She died.",
        "Q: She died. In Auschwitz? Or she was sent away?",
        "A: No, she -- she was sent away, but she survived. We have met after the war.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: She visited me, I visited her in \u201975 in Prague, but she died of an -- of an kidney failure.",

        "Q: Susan would talk.",
        "A: -- Susan was talking all the time. Not -- of -- in any case, that\u2019s the story of my -- my entrance\nto the camp office, and it was relatively an important job, and we could do a lot, yeah, and we\nwere helping a lot.",

        "A: She knew what I could do, and her lover was an architect, in charge of the architectural office,\nof whole Auschwitz, yeah. I had equipment and material, and whatever I want. I had a good life\nin that drawing office. It was an independent, no competition. Nobody was giving me the order\nexcept she, yeah.",

        "A: Katya yes, but they --",
        "Q: Together.",
        "A: -- knew what I\u2019m doing, and [indecipherable], as sometimes SS women were coming with a\nlittle of work, yeah. And -- but it became too much, yeah. I tried to s -- to satisfy everybody, but\nthen it became too much, and I complained to Mandel, said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\nEverybody\u2019s coming, and wants some little work, and I cannot fulfill, I cannot do everything.\u201d\nShe said, \u201cOkay,\u201d said, \u201cif anybody comes in future, just tell her or him to see me first.\u201d That\nwas the end, yeah.",

        "Q: Yeah.",

She is in that book too, \u201cFighting Auschwitz.\u201d One of\nthat woman was arrested after the war by the Polish Communists, and sentenced to death because\nof her anti-government feeling. And they put her together with Mandel in one cell. So, they had\nenough time to exchange their views and so on. And then Mandel one day ask her -- even what\u2019s\nhis name, Lankban describes the whole affair in his book, too. One day, Mandel ask her if she\nwould forgive her. So both were Catholics. She said, \u201cLook, why are you asking me? I forgive\nyou, but He upstairs, it\u2019s up to Him.\u201d So that was authentic, and she told me the story, too.\nRachwalova was her name.

        "Q: Oh okay, all right.",
        "A: -- the 10 people, marching out the door to their destiny, which they received by the work\nservice person, yeah. The work detail did only the administrative job. The work service\nphysically delivered the people.",
        "Q: Okay. And there was a specific place that the was -- that these 10 people were told to go?",
        "A: Yeah. And [indecipherable] door, and --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] and wait there until the person from the work service came and said, this is\nyour -- this is where you\u2019re going.",
        "A: Correct. Because she requested it, and she got it, yeah.",
        "Q: Right, okay. Now, when the work detail looks in the cards.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do they have to go through Katya before they go to the head of the -- to the blockelteste or\nnot?",
        "A: Of course, they had to go through our cardex, and either to transfer the people to other\nbarracks, to other places, to other sub-camps, yeah.",
        "Q: Right, because you have to be able to -- to --",
        "A: They had to be delivered to the -- to the -- they had to be made available to the people who re-\nrequested the services, yeah. Now, that could have been on transfer to another camp, or just to be\navailable every morning, through the blockelteste, make her responsible that those people will be\nready every morning, until they are going to can -- be cancelled, or until they die. And that was\none of the responsibilities of some blockelteste too, that if they had to be -- if they were selected\nfor an particular job, an -- or an -- a steady job, to be there, yeah. Once they have been told to\nsupply those 10 people every day, they had to stick to the request. There was a b -- v -- from the\nmoment a blockelteste was involved with Katya, our office was involved, too.",
        "Q: [inaudible] Hm. Okay.",
        "A: It\u2019s very hard to -- it was -- those situations have changed constantly. But the -- it 1s true that -\n- but if you were an real professional, and there were certain work details -- constant work\ndetails, that -- that the -- that was an routine -- 1t became routine, yeah. Of certain work details\nhad an certain number, yeah. So they were registered as a work detail under that -- in that\nnumber. 10 people, and sometimes only eight could come, because two were sick, so she had to\nengage again two more.",
        "Q: Two more, right.",
        "A: Through the same process, yeah.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Look, it was not simple.",
        "Q: Right. No, I understand that.",
        "A: Yeah. It was not simple, and each -- really, it\u2019s hard to believe that in an group of so many\npeople with different situations, and different backgrounds, that we had manage -- that we have\nmanaged to bring law and order into the place. And there were times then, that we have managed\nto -- to supply everybody with his ration. Those times were gone that we were coming home\nfrom an outdoor work and the blockelteste told you, \u201cWe have no more food for you.\u201d Yeah.\nThat never occurred under Katya. Rations were supplied, we had -- or they arranged special\nrations. Katya really made what she could in the time of counting the work -- the -- time of\ncounting the -- during the roll call time was cut down to an s -- minimum amount of time, yeah,\nand that meant more relaxation, more sleep.",
        "Q: I was going to get into this, but go ahead. Go ah --",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: -- go, continue.",
        "A: Yeah, that is all what I\u2019m trying to say, that it was not so simple how people think, and to\nmanage an -- and t-to manage the food distribution, the clothing distribution, the bedding, you\nname it, all s -- s -- clothing ides, including shoes. That is -- was not -- was -- became always,\nduring those years or th-those months, improved, improved enormously, yeah. Then we had\nenormous [indecipherable] blacks of Hungarian Jews in the four -- middle of \u201944, and so on. That\nwas an big problem, yeah, but as they were sep -- as those newcomers there, there was a lot of\nmovement. Newcomers were coming, and old-comers were sent on transport, because they were\nrequested in factories in Germany. A lot of people had been requested, but also a lot of\nmovement, and we had to account for each person, and the roll calls again became more\ncomplicated, but the system improved by sticking to it well, and -- and selecting more intelligent\nblockelteste, and block administrators, so 1t was always the tendency of improvement, and of\n[indecipherable] re -- raising the standard of living [indecipherable |",

We had to control the supply of not\nonly -- it was not enough to ask for people, and to supply the people for work, but it was an\nquestion of, as I said, food rations, clothing, bedding, hygiene, cleaning of the barracks, cleaning\nof each bed, a -- delousing, de -- and we had to -- we had to work very closely with the work\ndetail people. The work service had very little to do with the rest of those functions. They only\nhave supplied upon the request, those people they have -- that was an request for people, and\nthey had to supply, and nobody could care less how we did it, yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Or how they did it.",
        "Q: Right, right. Is Canada, the hospital sauna, also under the camp office?",
        "A: Canada is an work detail, had -- the camp office -- not the camp office.",
        "Q: Not?",
        "A: Or the work detail office, had any influence on any -- on any work detail.",
        "Q: So Canada had nothing to do with the camp office?",
        "A: Wait a minute. Canada was one of many.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Are you talking about the Canada camp?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Camp, or the work detail?",
        "Q: No, no, no. No, the work detail.",
        "A: Work detail. One work detail m-more or less. Why Canada? Why have you selected Canada?",
        "Q: No, no, no, I\u2019m just asking, are there --",
        "A: Th -- nothing special, they were just another work detail. They had their -- now, in those\ndifferent work details, you had an structure. You had the oberkapo, under -- underkapo, for-\nforemen, and all kinds of functions. So Canada was just one of a work -- but just one among\nmany work details.",
        "Q: All right, so, but then, what I\u2019m trying -- what I\u2019m trying to do is figure out what -- what is\nthe function of the camp office?",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: It\u2019s to oversee all of the work -- no. You explain it, I\u2019m not there, you\u2019re ex -- you explain it\nto me. If you have to say to someone who doesn\u2019t know anything, what is the camp office\nsupposed to be doing? They have a number of different functions, right?",
        "A: Now, can you imagine that you have s -- hundreds of barracks, correct?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You have, first of all, the camp office had to administer all sub-camps, and branch camps,\nyeah. We\u2019re that start.",
        "Q: All sub-camps and branch camps, okay. Let\u2019s -- let\u2019s --",
        "A: So ther --",
        "Q: -- let me -- let me turn the tape.",
        "A: Yeah.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape number three, side -- tape number three, side B, United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum interview with Helen Tichauer on September seventh, 2000. Okay.",
        "A: Now, let\u2019s start with the main procedure. The very most important function in all\nconcentration camps, were the daily roll call. Once or twice. Now, to have individual branch\ncamps, individual sub-camps, or what -- service camps, or whatever I am calling that, had to be\nroll called every day, okay?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: To do that, you had to report every day, once or twice, and every day once or twice, hours and\nhours were spent on the roll call. Now, if the come -- if the people were, during the roll call time,\nin the camp, or working outdoors, or working outside, it made no difference. The amount of the\npeople had to coincide with the estimated amount which was set every day. We had -- that was\nan very complicated and important, quote unquote, thing. Only [indecipherable] to be busy, or to\nbe engaged was already a -- a -- a big job, the roll call. Hours and hours [indecipherable] you had\nto prepare the food intake and distribution, which -- I mean, the distribution was done by the\nindividual blockelteste, but you had to order it, you had to request it, every day. How could you\ndo that? According to the roll call. The roll call -- you had -- for the roll call incoming transports,\noutgoing transports, transfers from hospital, to the -- to the camp, from the camp to the hospital.\nThe dying, the corpse, the gassing. It was an constant report on check control and check control,\nyeah. You had only the relationship between the hospital compound, and the releases, and the\nrequests for transfers from the camp to the hospital, from the hospital to the camp. There were\nfunctions which involved with the cardex system. People were dying, out of the living cardex,\ninto the dead cardex. There were reports to be written daily, on certain thing which they\nrequested by headquarters. I had -- I myself had an lot of work to do, which I cannot explain\nright now. You had the interaction between the work detail office, and the camp office, due to\nthose movements, they are already an full time job, yeah. And it had to be exact, and n -- we\ncouldn\u2019t -- you could not afford to have one person mislaid or misplaced, yeah. So that was an\nvery, very ups -- painstaking, or how do you call that? Painstaking?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Event, and we were always concerned about one thing. God forbid some -- the figures don\u2019t\ncoincide. That means the whole night to stand until the figures -- until the -- the figures are right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So that was not our fault, it -- the SS, the idiotic system, to build the whole, everything on that\nroll call business was taking -- was keeping us busy for hours and hours and hours, daily. What\ncan I tell you?",
        "Q: Why do you th -- why do you think so many survivors, who were in Auschwitz --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- do not remember, or do not know that there was a difference between roll calls at one time\nor another. All of them seem to talk about long roll calls.",
        "A: Wait a minute. I don\u2019t understand your question. Why do I se --",
        "Q: Most -- most -- most aus -- Auschwitz survivors --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- who were ordinary prisoners, when they talk about roll call, they never talk about short roll\ncalls. They only talk about long roll calls. Why do you -- why do you think that that\u2019s so, when\nwhat you have is a very clear memory that the roll calls got shorter as time went on.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: Not longer.",
        "A: Because we improved that.",
        "Q: But why do you think -- do -- do you think that they\u2019re --",
        "A: Because they have no memory, and they cannot distinguish the time -- span of time. But we\nhad our -- our stopwatch, yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And we were counting [indecipherable] working with a stopwatch, to -- to eliminate, and to\nimprove the roll call.",
        "Q: Can you explain how you improved it?",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: I know you\u2019 ve explained it to me before, but do it again.",
        "A: By being more efficient, by -- by preparing the roll calls in an -- with an special system of --\nof pre -- pre-roll call -- pre-roll call report.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You -- we knew at evening, preparing the whole business that in the morning, barrack so and\nso, after the transfers were made from the barrack to the hospital compound, and from the\nbarrack to an transport waiting at the railway station, and from that barrack on transfer to I don\u2019t\nknow where, and the same barrack receiving so and so many from the hospital, and receiving so\nand so many newcomers, must be 24, yeah? And in the morning, those 24 report -- were reported\nby preparing that the whole evening, yeah. So we have, before the roll call in the morning, every\n-- it was an system we established, every block administrator reported an hour earlier, we will\nhave 24 people on our barrack, yeah?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So when the roll call people were coming to count, they knew there must be 24. They were\nnot counting how many were there, but there had to be 24. That -- we have called that an\nforappelle. [indecipherable] the appelle, yeah.",
        "Q: So they were simply verifying what the report said.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: They were verifying what the report said.",
        "A: What report?",
        "Q: The -- the pre-report. The pre --",
        "A: The pre-report, they were very find what the pre-report said.",
        "Q: What -- as opposed to just counting?",
        "A: And there was nobody missing. Couldn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So that already had eliminated the unnecessary forward and backwards, and shifting and\nrunning, and -- and guessing, yeah. We had everything prepared every evening. It was an full\ntime job of an whole staff.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Including the -- the -- it\u2019s so people don\u2019t have the slightest idea what went on.",
        "Q: Bef-Before you would do these reports --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- what were they count -- I mean, 1-1f they didn\u2019t -- it\u2019s interesting.",
        "A: Th-They didn\u2019t know what they are doing.",
        "Q: If they didn\u2019t know -- they di -- they didn\u2019t know what they were doing.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So how -- what were they counting for? They were simply counting, and -- but they didn\u2019t\nknow what they were getting.",
        "A: Correct. And if that was Katya who introduced all the whole system, we once went on with an\nstopwatch, and discovered that the highlights of one counting, took only three minutes. You\nknow how many lives they save? How many people could relax instead to suffer in the snow, in\nthe heat? Now whatever the survivors are telling you, they have no idea. I\u2019m telling you, they\nhave no idea, our researchers have no idea. As I said, Yergen never entered an German\nconcentration camp. Is he an expert now on concentration camp? Had -- what\u2019s her name, of the\nwoman Nerhamatek writes books now on concentration camp, has no ideas what\u2019s an\nconcentration camp 1s. So you cannot always rely on the which -- on -- on the so-called experts,\nyeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You have to go deeper, and ask them to -- to look in -- to do what you are doing right now.\nIt\u2019s not easy to work with you. It\u2019s not easy to answer your questions, don\u2019t you think so?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Only you can judge that.",
        "A: But I don\u2019t know if -- if you understand what I am saying.",
        "Q: No, I think I do understand what you are saying.",
        "A: Good.",
        "Q: And the effect on the SS, they were -- they were glad not to be outside either.",
        "A: They were glad to go home, to be able to go home, yeah. There was less beating, and less --\nless -- less of everything, yeah.",
        "Q: Now, I remember when we were discussing this when Irwin was alive. And he described the\nmen\u2019s camp as creating chaos.",
        "A: How?",
        "Q: And the women\u2019s camp as creating organization, and that it was a very different way.",
        "A: Okay, but it was not always, yeah? They couldn\u2019t afford to do that always, because eventually\nthey got tired of it, yeah. And the people [indecipherable] they created that was just for awhile,\nwhile they were newcomers, and they were new -- numerologists, yeah?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t know what. But that was not an constant habit. They couldn\u2019t afford to do that all\nthe time.",
        "Q: All the time.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But that was something that they wanted to do, and that was not what the women wanted to\ndo.",
        "A: Ha -- the women, they were [indecipherable]. The women were just happy to go to bed, to go\nto sleep. That was never on our mind to -- to make things complicated during that time. You\ndon\u2019t know how hard it was for us. We were still -- no. Why the man did it, they were -- man is a\nreligious man. They were crazy, yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: They were not allowed to count. You know Jews --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- are not allowed to be counted --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and things like that. It was not an very heroic act whats 1s com -- what they committed\nthere. But after awhile that disappeared, that disappeared. We had all kinds of situations. In the\nbeginning, everybody wanted to together with her sisters, her mother with her, cousins. But then\nthey have learned that -- that the appelle is not an social gathering, yeah. Have learned it very\nquickly. Anything else, please? Carry on.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: You once said to me that the SS did not have any control over the camp office.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: It didn\u2019t?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You guys ruled the roost, you created the rules?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: You guys created the rules? How -- how could it be that they didn\u2019t have control over you?",
        "A: Because they had nobody who understood.",
        "Q: What you were doing?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you created this -- not even Mandel understood?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Not -- Mandel didn\u2019t understand what you were doing?",
        "A: Not really.",
        "Q: And when --",
        "A: She just wanted results, yeah. They couldn\u2019t care less what we are doing, as long as they got\nwhat they needed. So results, as long as Mandel had from me, at the end of each month, a\nbeautiful made diagram with 18 or 20 different curves, which went to -- over to -- to Berlin, she\ncouldn\u2019t care less when I did that, how I did that, why I did it. She once caught me in the middle\nof the after -- of an afternoon in bed, while making an surprise visit to the barrack, and I was in\nbed, yeah. But I was known -- \u201cWh-why are you here?\u201d I said, \u201cI have cramps.\u201d So she said,\n\u201cCarry on, sleep, and get better.\u201d Yeah. But she knew very well that I did my job, and I\n[indecipherable] what -- what I\u2019m -- what they wanted from me. And they have known me very\nwell that I have worked during the night all the time, yeah. Because I wanted to have the day for\nmyself, to visit and so on, yeah, all the running around so that -- that what\u2019s his name, Garovitch\ncalled me, I was a runner, he thought I was a runner, okay? You remember--",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: -- on the tapes.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t sleep s -- you didn\u2019t sleep very much, then?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: How many hours did you get, you think?",
        "A: I slept sometimes during the day. I engaged sometimes an -- the guard, which watched the\ndoor, and I said I\u2019m going to sleep, call me if somebody is in the vicinity, so I could sleep nearly\nevery day.",
        "Q: So did you get four hours, five hours?",
        "A: I mi -- more.",
        "Q: More?",
        "A: I -- [had my -- I slept, but I worked at night, and nobody knew when I slept, but as I said,\nthey watched out for me, I -- I had the -- I slept that -- during the day a little bit, and then I was\nrunning a little bit. At night I was working, so nobody disturbed, yeah. And sometimes the SS\nwas coming in at -- to those who were in charge, at night, cause there was lights in the barrack.\nSo they just got -- got used to it that I\u2019m working at night.",
        "Q: And what did you do during the day when you were running around, you were seeing people?",
        "A: Visiting my friends.",
        "Q: How could you be the -- weren\u2019t the people on work details? Weren\u2019t there do --",
        "A: Yeah, but those who were some blockelteste, some block administrators, nice people, yeah.",
        "Q: So what did you talk about?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: What did you talk about?",
        "A: Everything. Just like anybody else.",
        "Q: What do you mean?",
        "A: We were talking about anything.",
        "Q: Did you talk about what was going on?",
        "A: Yeah, and got reports from newcomers.",
        "Q: About the war, and where --",
        "A: What they were telling us, and w-we were just talking about it, and all kinds of things. Then\nthey had news from their boyfriends, and also outside world, and all kinds of things.",
        "Q: Did you feel you were in sort of an Alice in Wonderland world, that it was really --",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: -- it sounds very strange, Sippy.",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: All of it sounds very strange, because it\u2019s a very -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a fascinating combination of the\ncompletely macabre and awful, and the ordinary. Do you know what I mean? I mean sor -- a sort\nof ordinary life is happening in the midst of the most extraordinarily --",
        "A: Yeah, but you must realize I have -- I myself had -- was -- had an creative job, yeah. I was\nvery creative. On the other hand, I was building even one model of the camp, I told you that.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then [indecipherable] creativity was therapeutic, I worked in the orchestra, yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So that was my -- my luck, that I could be -- that I could disengage myself from -- from the he\n-- from hell, yeah.",
        "Q: But part of your work you couldn\u2019t possibly disengage yourself from the hell, right?",
        "A: Yeah, but for -- sometimes from -- for hours, it was good enough.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Then you were back again.",
        "Q: Right. And you never got depressed?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Never?",
        "A: No. Just like now, I\u2019m not getting depressed.",
        "Q: Did you get angry?",
        "A: No. No, I -- I -- I have a --",
        "Q: Did you not have feelings?",
        "A: Listen, I have an heart, and --",
        "Q: I know that.",
        "A: -- [had to protect my heart. If I have the feeling of in an state of beginning to be angry, I --\nI\u2019ve had to stop myself, and to tell myself, don\u2019t get angry, don\u2019t get excited, save your heart. I\nwant to live, I -- you see, I -- if I would get excited and angry o-over everything, I could have -- I\ncould have a heart attack, and I want to avoid that. I was not -- never angry. I\u2019m avoiding anger,\nI\u2019m avoiding fights. I -- do you know -- do you know anybody with whom I am fighting?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: That\u2019s --",
        "Q: And you were -- and you were like this when you were in your 20\u2019s?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: You were like this when you were in your 20\u2019s, in Auschwitz? You did the same thing, you\nbacked off of -- so you tried to maintain a level emotional field, yeah?",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: Did you cry? No. It\u2019s rather amazing, you know.",
        "A: What can I tell you?",
        "Q: Does that surprise you when you think about it?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. I th -- I am grateful that I am able to do it.",
        "Q: You think it helped you survive?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: You think it helped you survive?",
        "A: It helps me to survive now.",
        "Q: Now.",
        "A: Yeah. If I would -- if I would be angry over everything what is going on, yeah, I could -- I\ncouldn\u2019t -- I could -- could not live. There were -- that Ben Mead, for example, just to watch\nwhat he is doing, and what he did all those years, and what really nobody hears, yeah. And is on\ntop of everything, yeah.",
        "Q: But that does make you angry in some ways.",
        "A: It makes me angry because I have approached him so many times.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That I would like to be engaged in something, yeah. That makes me angry.",
        "Q: Yeah. But you hold -- you hold back the anger.",
        "A: I hold back the anger.",
        "Q: See now?",
        "A: And then I see Madonja. The moment I start to hold back the anger, I see Madonya, think\nabout something else. Yeah, what are we going to do now?",
        "Q: Want to take a break?",
        "A: What\u2019s the time now, three?",
        "Q: The time is 25 of four.",
        "A: Yeah, I don\u2019t need a break, I can carry on. You --",
        "Q: Do you want some more water?",
        "A: Not -- no, I had enough.",
        "Q: Well, let me ask you a few more questions --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- and then I think I may need to take a break.",
        "A: Are you tired?",
        "Q: Not so much, not so much.",
        "A: Look, am I making you tired?",
        "Q: No, no, no, you don\u2019t make me tired. You don\u2019t make me tired.",
        "A: Good.",
        "Q: Sippy, you sa -- you -- you mentioned the fact that one day when Mandel walked in, you were\ntaking a nap, and you told her you had cramps.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So that meant you were menstruating?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: That meant you were getting your period?",
        "A: I had -- I had menst -- menstrual pains.",
        "Q: Menstrual pa -- did you get your period? You did. But not for the first 14 months?",
        "A: 14 months.",
        "Q: So how do you -- to what do you attribute the change? Do you have any idea?",
        "A: Yeah. I started to eat differently, yeah. I had mixed my camp food with an little bit of self-\ncooked food.",
        "Q: And where did you get that food from?",
        "A: [had a girlfriend with whom I worked together, and all she did, she -- we had our bread\nrations in -- divided into one part to eat, and one part to exchange for potatoes, that\u2019s all. And the\npotatoes we have mixed an little bit with margarine, which we obtained. So we were eat -- the\nfeeling that you can eat -- that you are eating a little bit differently, yeah, contributed to your\nwell-being. It was nothing special. Then we had parcels received. I -- I had two rations from the\nspecial rations from the orchestra, and the camp office. And there were fruits and there were\nother goodies, yeah. Those special rations, special parcels which people were receiving from the\nparcel section, from the pack -- package room, because there were all good things, they brang\nthings which we did not had before, in the beginning. So I had that. Then this -- we have\nreceived from Switzerland, the Slovakian girls, there was by some of the organizations, of the\nCzech organizations, they paid through -- in Switzerland they purchased sardines, yeah. We\nreceived those sardines, we received some chocolate from time to time, yeah.",

After awhile I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m going to make an -- with a pencil, an plan on the desk --\ntop of the table, to put in those blocks, how they are located, with everything in the scale from\none two. So I measured out the whole camp, and everything, and made myself a line drawing\nwith pencil, on the top of the desk, and put the number of the block in. So when an SS man was\ncoming, and asking where 1s the block, I told him I could show him immediately where it is. So\nwhen I noticed it worked so nicely, I had the plan flat on my desk, I said I\u2019m going to build the\nbarracks, and in colors exactly, and I\u2019m going to make an little model, without asking anybody.\nThe material I had, and when I started, and Mandel once visited, and thought what I\u2019m -- and\nsaw what I am doing, she said [indecipherable] and Hessler was there. \u201cCarry on, you can do\nanything, you can measure out whatever you want. But, don\u2019t include the crematorium. You can\nput anything on, but no crematorium.\u201d Okay. So I engaged in little -- Hans [indecipherable] was\nan architectural student in Poland, or in France, and we are started to build that nice little model.\nIt was so nice we made [indecipherable] barbed wire, everything was on. So -- soil, glued -- put\nthe glue on, and sprinkled sand on so it stuck. I made an professional model, okay, out of the\ncamp. Now, then I had an friend who was one of the Polish underground workers. He was an\nelectrician, and him I engaged to put me in front of the entrance an little barb, electric barb like\nan -- like an -- what we had over there, and underneath I had the battery, and so when you\ntouched the two things, the camp was illuminated, yeah. Was an good model, very professional.\nThen, one nice day they were -- put me on an glass top on that, and were taking it out to the\ncommandant, Hesse, into his office. That was the end of it. Do you know it\u2019s possible that it is\nstill standing somewhere.",
        "Q: Somewhere.",
        "A: And what I did, I put my number, I marked the model with my number.",
        "Q: Oh, you did.",
        "A: It\u2019s signed.",
        "Q: Did you paint it --",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: -- so it was really -- it looked really professional, you painted it?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you put people in it, too, or just the --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. So you didn\u2019t have any -- did anyone take pictures of it?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Who?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Who, we? Of the inmates?",
        "Q: No, no, no, no, no.",
        "A: Ihave no idea what they did. But every time, whenever somebody was visiting, an high\nofficial, instead to -- what they did in prior years, to demonstrate how people are getting 25 on\ntheir buttocks, they brought the high officials into my office, and showed him the -- the model,\nyeah.",
        "Q: Yes, you said that, that rather than watching somebody being beaten, that this became a\nsubstitute.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Isn\u2019t that strange?",
        "A: Why?",
        "Q: Well, I don\u2019t know. How does one substitute -- this was a way of entertaining them?",
        "A: Because -- look, I don\u2019t know, it happened that -- it turned out that it was very beneficial for\nthe camp, that there was never -- there was never again, since I made the model, they had -- you\nsee, they were showing off with something always, but nobody ever performed the 25 since then.\nThey were proud of their model, yeah.",
        "Q: So they wanted to show that.",
        "A: Isn\u2019t that funny?",
        "Q: Strange.",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t even know what high officials I had in that drawing office, because there were\nreally a lot of very important looking people. I know one thing, Hitler wasn\u2019t there.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But, with those primitive SS people, I once made a joke, but it was not a joke, it turned out to\nbe a very good -- good weapon. They always asked me, \u201cWhat kind of an profession do you\nhave?\u201d I did that, I did that, what kind of a pro -- I said, \u201cThe same like your fuhrer.\u201d Yeah.",
        "Q: Did they keep quiet then?",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: Can you imagine? No, we are laughing now, but it was --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- for me then, I -- I tried to -- to keep those people out of my way. Same profession as your\nfuhrer. Son of a bitches. Now, what can I tell you? Any other question, or are you too tired?",
        "Q: lms -- lms --",
        "A: Would you like to wa -- a cup of coffee or something?",
        "Q: I\u2019m starting to get tired.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: I think we\u2019 ll st -- we'll stop the tape right now, at about 4:10, on September seventh.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B\n[ blank]\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "Q: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Helen Tichauer, on\nSeptember eighth, 2000, in New York City. This is tape number five, side A, interview\nconducted by Joan Ringleheim. Sippy, is there -- is there anything after we left each other\nyesterday --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: -- that you thought you wanted to clarify?",
        "A: I went to sleep.",
        "Q: You went to sleep, okay.",
        "A: I was tired. I just realized afterwards, clarify we will, after you\u2019ve make an -- after we\u2019ll make\nan transcript.",
        "Q: Right, okay.",
        "A: That I can correct, yeah?",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: There I will be able to clarify better th-than -- you see, I must see certain things in front of\nme.",
        "Q: Right, okay.",
        "A: I\u2019m a visual person.",
        "Q: Right. Well let me -- let me ask you something.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: What is it -- what -- what is 1t about the structure of Auschwitz that you th -- the women -- the\nwomen\u2019s camp, that you think most ordinary prisoners who went through --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: -- and are being interviewed, don\u2019t understand?",
        "A: I can\u2019t tell you --",
        "Q: Is it everything?",
        "A: -- it\u2019s very -- it\u2019s not Auschwitz only. Let\u2019s compare -- and I like to compare Auschwitz with\nthe present civilian environment, yeah?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because we are living in a normal life, in a normal environment. Who f -- f -- I mean, New\nYork is an big city, but a little village, a little -- an borough, whatever community, what does the\nordinary person know about the structure of the city hall? In spite of the fact that we have\ntelevision performance, exposure, we know that people can come and discuss it, and present their\nproblems, and there\u2019s a group of people, com-committees, and so on, who are listening, who are\ngoing ahead, and are engaged in problem solving, and betterment of certain malfunctions, t-\ntrying to help, and to make life more bearable. But who -- who knows how -- how the system\nworks? Who knows the mechanics? Now why should the ordinary person in Auschwitz have\nknown the mechanics of the camp, or the camp leadership? Why are we expecting that? Only\nthose who were engaged, or are engaged today in city hall business will know, and know, and\nknow how to go ahead, and how to conduct the certain sessions, and how to conduct the\nleadership. I mean, how to engage in the leadership, and what to do. The ordinary -- I don\u2019t know\nwhat the -- how they are -- how it works. And there\u2019s no plan of -- of s -- simplified to explain to\nthe public, not even who is who. And who -- who\u2019s -- who is doing what. Wh-Why do we expect\n-- know that ev-every ordinary, poor, ex, dirty, stinky inmate, hungry, half-dead musselman,\nshould know what happened in Birkenau, and in Auschwitz? Is that an answer?",
        "Q: That\u2019s a good answer.",
        "A: Good.",
        "Q: But let me -- let me ask you it in a -- in a different way.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It\u2019s one thing for ordinary people --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- not to know exactly what the structure is, and -- in any kind of detail.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It\u2019s another thing for them to not know that there\u2019s any structure. So -- so, a lot of people,\ncertainly before I met you --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- many years ago --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- I never -- it could be my stupidity, of course --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- as opposed to anything else, but I never thought that there was -- I never thought about a\nstructure. Di -- di -- do you know what I mean? And I think that that\u2019s true, I think that\u2019s true for\na lot of people, el -- over the years.",
        "A: Good, we were prisoners.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Yeah? There is a prison system in the United States.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Who knows about the prison system? Who ask about it? Who cares about it?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah? The prisoners themselves, today, they\u2019re interested in one thing, to have food, to have\nmedical care, to -- not to e -- be exposed to brutality by their guards, but -- and some of them\nmay be interested in the jury leg -- jury -- legal system, yeah?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And learn more about the law, and they have a chance to -- even to study, but how many of\nthose people will, after their sentence, be engaged in the cil -- in civil law? Just few who are\ninterested. And same thing as here. Those who survived and were -- became interested later on,\nwhat really happened to them, they have learned, and they know a little bit more than the average\nperson. But they participated in one thing, all of those -- of those who -- who are able to speak\nout. They mu-must remember how they were -- how they were perform -- not perform, transform\nfrom being an civilian into an inmate. They remember, even if a little bit, and not everything,\nhow they -- what happened to them when they were stripped naked, when they were shaved,\nyeah, when they were registered maybe, yeah. Then driven into an barrack, and all those basic\nthings, they have remembered them.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: They remember they had an blockelteste.",
        "Q: Right. No, you\u2019re right, you\u2019re right.",
        "A: Yeah? Now what -- why must they remember anything else what they never ec -- never --\nthey were never exposed to anything else, yeah?",
        "Q: Yeah, right, yeah, you\u2019re right.",
        "A: So it is not just the people don\u2019t know, they were never exposed to anything. And they were\ninterested in one thing, to sleep and to eat. They were the two enemies, sleeplessness, I mean --",
        "Q: And starvation.",
        "A: -- the lack of the chance to sleep enough, and to eat enough. And s -- hygiene, and then comes\nmedical facilities, let alone a medication, or well-being during an -- an roll call, yeah. The roll\ncall was actually the center of everything. Everything was built around the roll call, yeah.",
        "Q: So food is built around the roll call?",
        "A: Depended on the roll call, the food supply, if there were a thousand people, and you have\nreceived 900 rations, yeah, there was an problem. So as we mentioned yesterday, and I explained\nto you that the male prisoners -- the non-Jewish male prisoners, who were there much earlier\nthan the Jewish prisoners, male and female, the male prison -- non-Jewish male prisoners were\nmainly ex-military people, fren -- from France, from each country. They knew what an roll call\nis, they knew that an -- the formation into five and all that, is of importance to make things easier\nand quicker, but the women did not understood, and the Jewish male, especially of the religious\nsect, did not understood, yeah. Now they think that they have committed an act of resistance,\nthose idiots, yeah? That was no act of resistance, to -- to made it impossible to be counted, that\nwas an k-killing situation. They were beaten, they were -- they have extended the duration of the\nroll call, and a -- the s -- it -- stupidity of they\u2019re not allowed to be counted, and all that, did not\nhelp, so again -- and we were not soldiers, the women were not soldiers, ex-soldiers, we didn\u2019t\nknow what it meant in the beginning at least, and then later on, of course it -- we have learned\nwhat -- what the roll call is, but it was an torture, because we hadn\u2019t -- the people had no\nexperience, they didn\u2019t understood. And everybody wanted to stand during a lo -- roll call with\nher sister, while moving forward, and backwards, and they were -- they had the ti -- never made\nany sense. They -- they did not understood, nobody\u2019s there to explain, yeah, so.",
        "Q: Di -- wh-when you -- when you f -- when you folks came up with your system of doing the\nroll call, the pre -- the pre-appelle.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.",
        "Q: Did you try to create a system where the blockelteste would explain to the women what you\nwere doing, so that they wouldn\u2019t act in this chaotic way?",
        "A: The blockelteste, no. Th-There was told -- look, people in charge had certain obli -- had\ncertain -- no -- had an obligation, certain obligation to tell the people, come out, we have to count\nyou. Stand in fi -- in -- in five rows, yeah. Who had time, in an hungry, wild, hoard, th -- the -- it\nwas an wild hoard of people, yeah, who had time to speak and to explain, and who was listening,\nyeah? There was an ordered, do that, yeah. If you didn\u2019t --",
        "Q: And ordered what?",
        "A: -- a order, do that, go stand in five --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- in perf -- in five of rows, yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: That was the order. If you did it, fine. If not, you were hit. There was hitting going on,\npushing, kicking, screaming. So that was not an normal situation, you had hungry, wild people,\nwho didn\u2019t know what is going on, and nit -- did not understood, and you could not talk, because\nthere was no time to talk. You -- if you wanted that people should do something, you s -- the f --\nyou were giving an order, and if they did not obey to the order, they were be-beaten, and once\nthey were beaten, things -- it was an horrible situation. And then the SS came in, and they were\ncoming with dog. They had to be -- it -- it was an wild horde of hungry, miserable people, yeah,\nin the beginning. Later on, when they have learned -- it took awhile, that if they are going out,\nand they do that quick as possible, they can go back quick as possible. That meant they could rest\nlonger, they could sleep longer, there was no beating. But 1t took awhile, but there was no tal --\nlook, you\u2019re Mrs. Lehrman, in one of her speeches that were printed in -- in the newsletter,\nexplained that she was -- something happened during roll call, and the blockelteste took an\nbucket of cold water and -- and -- over her body, I don\u2019t know why. She must have been wild,\ntoo, because she must have ec -- behaved just like what I explained to you before, that an\nblockelteste will use water fe -- every drop of water was so precious, she must have behaved\nimpossible, yeah. But that she doesn\u2019t know, and does not even bother to explain. Then she\nmentions the name of the blockelteste, yeah. That woman lives here, and I know her very well.\nShe was not an bitch, she was a normal human being, who was living later on in a displaced\nperson camp, and believe me, she would have been such an horrible woman, she wouldn\u2019t have\nsurvived one day. So, she doesn\u2019t even bother to find out who that blockelteste was, yeah. You\nknow s -- her name, she mentioned her name. So the bucket of water, that was the big -- big\nevent that she used a bucket of water to calm her down. But can you imagine how wild she must\nhave been? And we had man-many, many of those people, who just turned crazy.",
        "Q: Did the camp office workers have to go on roll call?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: With -- with just -- in the ba -- the barrack -- barracks four, five and six -- I mean that\u2019s\nbarracks four -- barrack four.",
        "A: Every -- every --",
        "Q: Everybody.",
        "A: -- roll call was in front of the barrack.",
        "Q: Right. But you were how many people in that barrack?",
        "A: Nearly hundred.",
        "Q: And all of -- everybody working for the camp office?",
        "A: Or individuals who worked in one capacity of secretaries or so, outside of the camp, who\nwent out every day. But they were part of the camp office. On the -- the work place or\nsomewhere, not concentrated where we -- yeah, it was the camp, it was the office -- the office\nworkers of the camp.",
        "Q: So -- so let\u2019s -- let\u2019s do this just a little bit again.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: The roll call really is -- 1s the information, in order for almost everything to function.",
        "A: Logistic -- logistics.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s food, it\u2019s clothing, it\u2019s work, it\u2019s movement, everything.",
        "A: Everything. It was the -- real heart, the be-beating heart of entizil. It was the most important\nfunction, the most important function of the whole camp, and it is just too bad that Laura Shelley\ndid not understood what she did with the secretaries of that.",
        "Q: No, it\u2019s interesting, because the only thing that you get --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- as far as I can tell, when women talk about the roll call, is how difficult it was.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Not the way it functioned -- at -- and you\u2019re right, how would they know, but in spite of the\nfact of studying it for so long, I myself have not, until now, really understood that without that,\nyou can\u2019t do anything in that camp, for good or ill. Either killing people, or saving people, that\u2019s\nthe heart of it. That\u2019s very interesting. So tell me something. In terms of food rations, di --\namounts of food --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Who made the decision what a ration was for one person?",
        "A: Wait a minute. Those decisions were made for -- merely for the whole system in all Germany,\nso it was made at an very high level. I couldn\u2019t tell you where, and who was responsible for it,\nbut just like the civilian population had their food rations, and which applied to each German\ncitizen, and -- or applied to -- to the German population of an certain working group, like light\nindustry, or heavy industry, or whatever, there were certain standards set, yeah. Now, so they\nwere set certain standards for the concentration camp population, and we have information of the\ncaloric intake, and the caloric standards, or supplies for the civilian population, and for the\nworking population in the -- and in the working -- in the camp population. Now, those special\nrations which every two weeks or so were supplied to heavy -- to indus -- to workers who were\nworking in heavy industry -- prisoners or civilians were sometimes identical, yeah. And there are\nstudies made, there are tables, there are reports on that. I couldn\u2019t tell you that by heart, but it is\navailable, and the East Germans did that already after the war, and published that.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: In many publications, so if that is of interest to you, you can go into the files and -- and look\ninto that, easily.",
        "Q: Right. But all right, so however, you -- the camp office would say, there are X number of\nwomen.",
        "A: Oh no.",
        "Q: And -- and -- and -- then so who -- how does that --",
        "A: X num -- no, the population in the camp, man or women, had the same supply, food supply,\nyeah?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the order what to supply, on an daily or weekly or monthly basis, was not decided 1n -- in\nthe camp. Not in the camp, not in the headquarters of the SS. It was -- it was coming from an\nhigher authority, I couldn\u2019t tell you where from, yeah, but when every day 1s a kitchen -- it was a\nkitchen where you have to collect your bread, in the kitchen you -- the bread rations of an gi-\ngiven day, yeah. All week they were five -- for five people, one bread, or four people, or two\npeople, yeah. And accordingly, they had supplied to the barracks, some bread rations.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: If there was margarine, the kitchen had the order to supply for 10 people one cube, or five\npeople, whatever. The kitchen was the one who -- who supplied -- you supplied the kitchen with\nthe amount of people, and you were rec -- you received the amount of rations. But they had the\norders from somewhere, yeah, I couldn\u2019t tell you where from. We had nothing to do with that,\nthe -- we couldn\u2019t care less.",
        "Q: Okay, but wo -- suppose you said, I don\u2019t know, 10,000 people --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- need to be fed today --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- right? But they only gave you -- I mean, would it happen --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- that they would give you rations for only 900?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: It wouldn\u2019t happen?",
        "A: No. But that happened in the beginning, because they were not quite sure, and they never\nreceived the proper amount --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- of people, because the roll call was not organized, and was contro -- out of control, because\nthe system was not established. But the moment when Katya took over, there was no way that\nsomebody would have gone hungry to bed, yeah. For each person, it -- if -- for each person\nreported, there was an ration, the daily ration. No matter what. It never happened.",
        "Q: But --",
        "A: It did not happen. And if by accident something happened, then the blockelteste was clever\nenough to su -- to -- to divide the rations so that everybody had something to eat, yeah.",
        "Q: Now, the rations, were they mainly soup, and bread, and some margarine sometimes, and\nsometimes --",
        "A: Yes, and twice a week, an little piece of -- of sausage. There are people today, listen carefully,\nwho swear they have never seen an piece of margarine. They simply don\u2019t remember. Who\nswear they never had -- no -- never even knew that there is something else. They had sometimes\nan bit of marmalade, sometimes cheese. That was everybody, but they don\u2019t remember any more,\nI don\u2019t know why.",
        "Q: So how -- how would -- how would these come to the barrack? The soup was carried in big\nkettles.",
        "A: The people from the barracks --",
        "Q: Would come?",
        "A: No, they have f -- the -- the block stubendienst, yeah, those who were engaged in the block\npersonnel, they had to go in the morning and get the -- the tea, or coffee, or whatever they had,\nthey had to go in between and bring the bread, al-always to the kitchen. The kitchen supplied\neverything, yeah. In the kitchen, the portions were cut. In the kitchen everything was prepared,\nso it was easy to -- to count if one cube of margarine was for 10 people, so 100 people to be\nsupplied, you had 10 -- 10 cubes, yeah? It was not -- no big deal. The soup was always carried --\nthe kitchen supplied an -- an -- pa -- the personnel from each barrack had to go to the kitchen and\ncollect their -- their portions.",
        "Q: So the kitchen worked very hard?",
        "A: Very. There were very strong people working in the kitchen, too, but it was mainly reserved\nfor Poles. In the women\u2019s kitchen were Polish women only.",
        "Q: And you had said that they were members of the Resistance that had come 1n?",
        "A: Some of them, some of them.",
        "Q: Some of them. But you always said that they were fair.",
        "A: Who?",
        "Q: The Poles in the kitchen. Different from when the Hungarians came.",
        "A: Oh yes. The Hungarians were stealing. Oh God, oh God. And not only that, the Hungarians\nwere cruel, stupid -- some of them -- stupid people. There were an couple of -- of Norwegian\nprisoners in the camp, males. They were so mean to them, they did not understood Europe, yeah,\nthey were coming just like the people out of the ghetto in -- in Romania or where -- where Elie\nWiesel comes from, those little shtetls. They never heard of a rest -- the rest of Europe. And right\nin the camp, there were Norwegians, big, clumsy, yeah, good types of pe -- but couldn\u2019t speak\nanything. Definitely not Yiddish. And they were calling the Norwegians the Eskimos, can you\nimagine? And were making fun of [inaudible], and were mean. After the war, it\u2019s very little\nknown, the Norwegian government took in Jewish refugees, under one condition, no Hungarians.\nNo Hungarian Jews. They were not allowed to enter no -- Norway, and nobody knew why, yeah.\nIt was an silent, secret, unwritten regulation and law, yeah. But I can tell you why, yeah. Let --\nbut I -- I would not mention that -- oh, I would like to have that off record, yeah.",
        "Q: You at one time said to me that when you would get the morning liquid, the tea or the coffee -",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- that rather than drinking it, you would clean yours --",
        "A: We were washing ourselves, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- yes, and that that would be s -- it would have been smart for everybody to do that, rather\nthan drinking it.",
        "A: Yeah. We -- not -- not smart, I mean we were hydra -- dehydrated, too. So if you have used an\ncouple of sips, was good enough for your body, but you could clean your genitals, you could\nclean your face, your hands, whatever. You can, with an piece of a rag, if it\u2019s wet, can clean your\nwhole body, yeah. You know that. Even patients in an hospital are washed with a little bit of\nwater, and that is good enough. So, that what we did.",
        "Q: Did a lot of women do that, or mainly in the camp office? I\u2019m just wondering.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know --",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know.",
        "A: -- if the people in the camp office. I did it in -- in the camp office we had water. In the camp\noffice, we had other conditions.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: But I did it in an time when we had no access to anything, in the beginning, especially. I did\nit, but I don\u2019t know what the others did, really not.",
        "Q: Now the margarine, you said you also put on your face --",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: -- so that it wouldn\u2019t dry out.",
        "A: Every day, I have used more margarine on the face then, than I am using cosmetics today,\nyeah. And I massaged my face every day, every day in the morning, after I washed the face with\nmargarine, and not only that, the rest of my hands, I\u2019ve smoothed, went over my hairdo, yeah,\nand it was shining. So I looked pretty well groomed, by using the existing -- the existing -- what\nshall I tell you? It\u2019s existing na -- material, or whatever, yeah. That what I did. I don\u2019t know what\nthe others did, yeah. And definitely never discuss what to do. It was an drive, it was an natural\ndrive to look smooth, to look good, because to have cracks around your lips, or s -- on your skin\nm-meant sometimes death. People were selected for that, yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Ihave massaged my fingers, my hands. I never -- I really had better -- in those days I looked\nbetter much more often [indecipherable] today. Today I am using ordinary water and soap. There\nI have used at least cream, and I don\u2019t use any lotion. I don\u2019t know why, but I massaged my face,\naround my eyes, just like the book said, with margarine. And during outdoor works, the sun\nmade such an nice -- such a good work, the sun and margarine is giving you such an beautiful\ntan, yeah.",

I\nreceived some photos from her, she is over 80, older than I am, looks good, beautiful face, s --\neverything looks good. So, at an occasion, while being on the phone with her, I have ask her,\n\u201cTell me, when did you had your last face lift?\u201d Yeah? I -- I was very honest, and expected an\nhonest answer. She said, \u201cI beg your pardon? Didn\u2019t you told me to use margarine in Auschwitz\nfor my face? I never had a facelift, and I have the best skin you can imagine, and thanks to you.\u201d",
        "Q: So she used margarine? It was a very cheap way of getting a facial.",
        "A: Yeah, but she -- she learned that from me there.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t remember telling her?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Oh, you do?",
        "A: She noticed what I\u2019m doing, so she did it too.",
        "Q: So maybe we should tell everybody to do this?",
        "A: Look, what do you -- what do you think about my face?",
        "Q: It\u2019s in very good shape.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Very good shape.",
        "A: In good shape?",
        "Q: Yeah, you don\u2019t have a lot of lines.",

If you look at her,\nthat face of her, on her -- one of [indecipherable], she looks like an crocodile, and she had all the\n-- the best possible way of using her cosmetic for herself, right? She had the money, and the\nmassages, and everything. So, if she would have used, instead of whatever she used, mar-\nmargarine, she would never develop -- she would have never developed the crocodile skin. No --\nanyhow, I once said --",
        "Q: So did you use margarine after the war, too?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: But I have -- you know what I have used? They should pay me for that, what I am saying\nnow, some -- I should collect some -- what are -- what are you calling that in English, if -- if you\nget interest, of -- no, not interest. I am not -- in an commercial, yeah, you get so and so much if\nyou make an commercial, and if you repeat that [indecipherable]",

        "A: In the beginning --",
        "Q: Yeah, you had Russian -- the Russian uniforms, yes.",
        "A: Yeah, in the beginning, but then there were no Russian uniforms more, so they have taken --\nwhile sorting the stuff which they have taken away from the newcomers, the good stuff went to\nGermany, into the Reich, and the less -- th-th -- those which looked more cheap and -- and not so\ngood, were then supplied the beglidinskammer, the clothing barrack, and were stored there, and\ndistributed to other Jewish newcomers, while the non-Jewish newcomers received the striped\nclotheses. But, so if you have s -- then, when people were selected for better jobs, Jewish\nwomen, they were dressed into striped clotheses, too.",
        "Q: So is that what you wore?",
        "A: Yes, but after that, we switched back to civilian clotheses, but good ones, yeah.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Because they wanted us to look -- 1t was summer, and it -- summertime the striped stuff was\ntoo heavy, so they even supplied the non-Jewish women with civilian clotheses, but they were all\n-- b -- they were all lightweight uniformed -- uniformed material dresses, specially sewn for the\nprisoners, yeah.",
        "Q: And who sewed them? In the prison, or -- or in Auschwitz, or",

        "Q: You don\u2019t know where.",
        "A: -- they were coming from. We don\u2019t know who did the striped clotheses, yeah. That we don\u2019t\nknow. I don\u2019t know, at least. But th-they are not produced in Auschwitz, no.",
        "Q: And ki --",
        "A: Well, it was for the whole German --",
        "Q: Yeah, the system.",

        "A: It -- the clothing barracks -- the whole bi -- business over there, they -- in the beginning, they\nhad, for each newcomer, a dress, yeah, in the women\u2019s camp, and for the men they had their\ntrousers, and whatever. And exchanged -- clotheses were either exchange after delousing\nprocess, not always. Sometimes you received the same stuff back, but sometimes they just took\nthe stuff away and supplied you with different things. Now, what is it you would like to know?",

        "Q: Everything.",
        "A: -- everything. And that was on the sortings facility for everything, yeah.

        "Q: In the beglidinskammer? So it was a big storehouse?",
        "A: It was the incoming stuff, and outgoing stuff had to be counted, had to be prepared, had to be\nbundled, yeah. Was constant movement. And don\u2019t forget the beglidinskammer had to supply the\nbranch camps, wherever a woman was, just the same, yeah. They sometimes changed very often\ntheir clothes, more often than -- than the outdoor workers. So they have supplied them with new\nclothing, or clean clothing, and received the dirty one, yeah. It was an clearinghouse for constant\nchange, especially the odds -- the branch camps were very well looked after, yeah, they are\nalways well dressed, clean. That was an very important function, the function of the -- of the\nclothing from barrack, yeah. Very important. In the beginning they were full of lies, but later on,\nit was whenever you have -- whenever you could see somebody from those branch camps, they\nlooked just like out of the box, beautifully dressed. Everything was beautiful, clean.",
        "Q: But that wasn\u2019t true of people who were in Auschwitz itself, 0 --",
        "A: No, no.",

        "Q: And what about underwear? Panties?",
        "A: Those who had striped clotheses, there was -- there were under -- underpants, not very -- very\nsexy ones, but there were underpants, and some kind of an undershirt, and the others, the Jewish\nprisoners, who wore dresses, or whatever, they -- they were allowed to -- to wear an -- sweaters,\nunder the dress.",

        "A: Yeah. But sometimes they were s -- shri -- they were shrinking those gloves, sometimes an\nreal glove looked like was that -- like my fist, small, because they went through -- through the\nsteam cleaning machine, and was shrinking.

        "A: Yeah. Pardon, socks?",
        "Q: Socks.",
        "A: Nobody cared, yeah, if you wore socks, or if you had rags. Soldiers wear rags too, so it was\nnot officially supplied, yeah, but somehow they couldn\u2019t care less. Everybody looked after them\n-- after herself and people somehow had what -- what they -- some of them had no chance to\nprotect themselves in wintertime, they fr-frozen toes. Some of the girls had frozen nipples. It\u2019s a\npity that you don\u2019t speak German. I have here some good literature of -- of -- of interviews. I\nhave here some interviews of people who are describing their pro-problems at wintertime, yeah.",
        "Q: Well, maybe you can tell me the reference, and I can have it translated. So -- before I leave.",
        "A: Yeah. I may give you an copy of an -- of one paper where -- no, [indecipherable] it\u2019s a --\nreferences, no, it\u2019s enough if I tell you that the girls had frozen nipples.",
        "Q: So what did they do about it?",
        "A: They were coming to me, and -- and as I have learned from one of the doctors, that cod liver\noil is very good for frozen -- frozen parts of the body, and -- and frozen nipples. I collected cod\nliver oil every day from the garbage heap of the -- of the [indecipherable]. There was no garbage\nheap, but the package room, where the non-Jewish prisoners re -- would receive packages from\nhome, were opened before they were supplied to the -- to the owner, and they have taken out all\nthe vitamins. Every package at least contained an bottle of cod liver oil from home, because it\nwas so good, and important. But the SS removed from each package, the cod liver oil, and the\nvitamins, and throwing that out in front of the barrack, and in the morning -- early morning, the\ncleaners, they are coming, collecting that, and into the garbage. Now when I have learned that, as\nthe package room was next to our barrack, the package barrack was number five, I was living on\nnumber four, I went out every morning, and collected all the cod liver oil, not the vitamins, but I\ntook all the cod liver oils into my camp office. I re -- consumed every day, one bottle of cod liver\noil. I was stinking. From miles away you could feel that somebody who was -- who was smelling\nafter cod liver oil, but I think it saved my life. It saved a lot, because if -- to have in your body,\nevery day, an bottle of cod liver oil, meant something, yeah.",
        "Q: What does it do?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: What does --",
        "A: Drinking, drinking.",

        "A: Good, then go into the library and read.",
        "Q: And find out.",
        "A: Read what it does. But, besides that, I drank -- I was drinking daily one bottle of cod liver oil\nfor months, maybe a whole year. Then, I supplied the hospital, my doctor friends, with cod liver\noil, so that when patients were coming they could treat them, and friends of mine who had frozen\nnipples and toes, I supplied them with cod liver oil so that they can treat themselves.",
        "Q: And rubbing --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- cod liver oil helps. Really?",
        "A: Yeah. If so -- if it was not overdue, because sometimes the toes were falling off, yeah. But\neverybody noticed an frozen nipple, so most of the girls were coming, and I supplied them with\ncod liver oil, okay? That\u2019s an story, too.",
        "Q: Yeah, absolutely.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Absolutely. Tell me about shoes.",

        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: Yeah. And inside workers got good shoes, not -- you see, the cont -- the whole system was\nnot designed for the well being of the inmates, yeah?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And sometimes you had big shoes, and sometimes you had small shoes, so it was a mite --\nnightmare, the shoe business. I, for example, could not get boots. And people were allowed to\nwear boots at wintertime, and I couldn\u2019t get boots, do you know why? Because most women\nwere taller than I, and the size of the boot was too high. It was hitting my knees. So I never -- I\nnever, never, during all those years, I\u2019ve been able to get a pair of boots to fit my legs.",
        "Q: And what happened to those sh-shoes, those hiking shoes that you came in with?",
        "A: No, th-then when the summer was coming, yeah, it was too hot, and then I had a better job\nalready, I couldn\u2019t walk around with those shoes, you know, in the camp office.",
        "Q: Not even in the winter?",
        "A: The first.",
        "Q: The first one?",
        "A: The first winter, yeah.",
        "Q: And after that, what did you wear?",
        "A: Shoes.",
        "Q: Just regular shoes.",
        "A: I could any -- any pair of shoes in the -- shoe in the clothing barrack. I just se --",
        "Q: But if you went outside during the winter, when there was a lot of snow, it was --",
        "A: Well then, I had my -- my boot.",
        "Q: Then you had your other ones?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I see. So you kept them the whole time?",
        "A: As long as I could.",

        "Q: But shoes were really crucial in Auschwitz, weren\u2019t they? So it could kill you, or not.",
        "A: They are as crucial in New York as in Auschwitz, believe me.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: What do you think, why have they developed after so many years, that kind of walking shoes\npeople wear, even with fur coats, yeah? By the way, I had -- I developed one bunion, several\nyears ago. Now, that has nothing to do with Auschwitz, what I\u2019m telling you. And a bunion is no\nfun, and most people must undergo surgery because it hurts. I have decided not to undergo\nsurgery, and I have decided no matter how expensive, and how pretty the shoe is, I have cut out\nan hole on each pair of shoes, where the bunion grew. And if you are looking today my -- at my\nli -- leg, I have no bunion any more.",
        "Q: It just went away?",
        "A: It just went away, because normally, if you have the pressure --",
        "Q: It keeps it going.",
        "A: And I -- people were laughing at me. Here, in New York. I was well dressed, beautiful shoes,\nand the cut up -- and the hole, and I couldn\u2019t care less, yeah. And it was a good decision. I'll\nshow you.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s see. No bunions.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: No bunions, no corns.",
        "A: Okay, you have learned something now.",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: It\u2019s worthwhile to ruin your shoes, than to ruin your leg.",
        "Q: Absolutely. I agree with you.",
        "A: And just an ordinary little hole, and if it\u2019s too little, then you can make it bigger.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Even if the whole bunion comes out. If you have black shoes and wear black stockings,\nnobody notice that.",
        "Q: Okay Sip, let\u2019s talk about washing in the latrine, for most of the prisoners.",
        "A: Washing and what?",
        "Q: Going to the bathroom.",
        "A: Yeah, the latrine -- oh, the famous latrine. Yeah, what would you like to know about the\nfamous latrine?",
        "Q: People are out on roll call. Do they -- are they allowed to go to the latrine before roll call --",
        "A: No, you can\u2019t --",
        "Q: You go right there?",
        "A: [indecipherable] you don\u2019t go right there. And nobody was allowed to leave the roll call, for\nheaven\u2019s sake.",
        "Q: No, no, no, I don\u2019t mean that.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: When were people allowed to go to the latrine? After roll call, before roll call?",
        "A: N-Not during.",
        "Q: Not -- no, I understand not during. Before?",
        "A: It depends. Before, or after, but not during, yeah. During roll calls you had to be there.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And nobody bothered if y -- it\u2019s after or before. If the roll call was announced, people had to\ngather. And if the roll call was terminated by a missile, people could disperse.",
        "Q: And they could go to the latrine if they wanted to.",
        "A: They -- they -- yeah. If it wasn\u2019t too late in the morning, that they had the formation of work\ndetails and so on, yeah. But if it was an urgent matter, you had to go.",
        "Q: Sippy, ordinarily, what time is roll call in the morning?",
        "A: The -- very early.",
        "Q: I know that it cha -- I know that it changed over time.",
        "A: Very early, very early. It was still dark, yeah. So, it winter time, when is it dark? Still --",
        "Q: Six, seven?",
        "A: Roll call started, actually, the waking up -- I couldn\u2019t tell you exactly the time, but it was\naround five o\u2019clock. And until you -- six o\u2019clock, I think, you had to s -- wait until the SS man\nwas coming and counting you.",
        "Q: So did you wait outside until they came and counted you?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: We had -- Katya, during our time, when we tried to make life easier for the people, under all\ncircumstances, on an rainy day, on an windy day, or on bad day, we allowed the people to had --\nI mean, we arranged to allow some of the people, where applicable, to stay indoors, yeah, and to\nbe counted indoors, yeah.",
        "Q: Indoors.",
        "A: If I say applicable, if there was no room for such an usual amount of [indecipherable]\nthousand, because there was no space.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, it was always close to the barrack, where they were protected from the weather, and from\nthe sun, or so. But, usually it took place outdoors, because th -- if it was too heavy, an heavy rain,\nthe SS didn\u2019t wanted to get wet, either. So it was never done for the inmates -- I mean, they\nwould never allow that for the benefit of the inmates, but for their own benefit. And we have\nused that, yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We have used that, by talking them into indoor -- indoor counting.",
        "Q: The tape is now stopping again. This is the end of tape number five, side B\nEnd of Tape Five, Side B\nBeginning of Tape Six, Side A",
        "Q: One second. This is tape number six, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Helen Tichauer, on September eighth, 2000.",
        "A: Blah, blah.",
        "Q: Blah, blah. Could -- could women go to the latrine at night? Because many people talked\nabout --",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: -- there being a bucket in the -- in the barrack.",
        "A: No, there was curfew, curfew, curfew.",
        "Q: And curfew started when?",
        "A: Late. Around 10, I think. But I couldn\u2019t tell you that exactly, we had no watches. Whenever\nthey decided curfew, there were whistle -- whistles -- the whistles went on, and there was\ncurfew, and then you were not allowed to leave, otherwise you could have been shot.",
        "Q: And before curfew, could you go to the latrine?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: If -- you could.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: You could?",
        "A: You could.",
        "Q: Did most of the latrines also have washing facilities, or not?",
        "A: Some of them had a little bit -- a little bit, but not really. It depend where. In Birkenau the la -\n- la -- the wooden barracks -- yeah, the wooden barracks had buckets. The brick barracks had\nbuckets, too. The latrines were actually real buildings, wooden buildings, or brick buildings,\nbehind the whole row in the -- in the women\u2019s camp. Beho -- behind the row of brick barracks,\nthere were barracks who -- in -- were in use for -- for the latrine. We have -- they are still in good\nshape today, they still exist. You can see for those if you go to Birkenau, you can see how the\nlatrines looked. There were holes --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- where you were sitting, and doing your business. It was an ugly business.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Very ugly.",
        "Q: Want to explain that?",
        "A: Uh?",
        "Q: You want to explain? Why was it ugly?",
        "A: Oh, to sit there, and to be pushed around sometimes, be -- there were more people than holes.",
        "Q: Is that where you went, or did you have a -- was there a latrine that --",
        "A: I went on the barrack -- on the bucket, but in the beginning I was living there, too.",
        "Q: Did you have diarrhea?",
        "A: And I had diarrhea. And I don\u2019t even want to think about it.",
        "Q: It\u2019s awful.",
        "A: Horrible. Bloody diarrhea, no medication, dirty, couldn\u2019t clean yourself. Wait -- wait until the\nnext morning, you had an bit of tea, and then you had to use that to clean yourself, and to wash\nyour tookas. It\u2019s horrible, horrible.",
        "Q: So to -- h-how does -- I know when, in ordinary circumstances, normal circumstances --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- when you get diarrhea, it\u2019s very difficult. You have to make sure that you don\u2019t get\ndehydrated, it\u2019s exhausting.",
        "A: Who -- who could think about dehydration? We had nothing to drink.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Because the water we\u2019ve -- they\u2019ve supplied us, that caused the diarrhea, was infected water.\nSo th-that, you cannot imagine, it was -- was like an vicious circle. If -- I really don\u2019t know how\neverything work -- how I -- how I overcame all those things. Hard to believe. You see, diarrhea\nis something unpleasant, even here, when you have all the facilities, let alone where you had no\nfacilities whatsoever to clean yourself, or to -- to -- to use an toilet whenever you had the urge,\nyeah. And there was not diarrhea only, as you had some -- always two or three different\nconditions. I don\u2019t know how we did it, I really don\u2019t know. I tell you what I did, during the\nheavy time, and hard time, somehow I got myself a tin -- a tin, and whenever I had the urge to do\nsomething during the night, I used the tin. Then -- put that in front of my legs, in that bed where\nwe were laying, but some of the women used their -- their eating --",
        "Q: Bowls?",
        "A: Bowls for both, and that was an big tragedy, because they never -- they couldn\u2019t survive. You\nsee, you -- you infected yourself, and re-infected yourself. You couldn\u2019t -- and no matter what\nwe did to explain not to do that, it didn\u2019t help. So, I can tell you what I did, but I can not ec --\nexplain why the others used only th-the same bowl for their business they used for eating. I never\ndid it. I got -- got myself a can of -- it was approximately as -- ama -- an two pound can, tall like\nthat. Was just good to use as a -- for urinating. Also, I never had to go down when -- I like to live\nalways on the top, where most people didn\u2019t wanted to climb, cause they had no -- no energy. I\ncould always climb, I was always on the top, and there used my -- my -- and then all I had to go\nwas going down in the morning, and s -- and empty that into the bucket. And then I left the can\nagain on my bed, and -- and the block personnel, who checked those beds, and sometimes even\narranged the beds, they never -- never throw those cans out. They knew what it is used for. So\nthat is the way how I really survived.",
        "Q: So -- and --",
        "A: How I managed, yeah.",
        "Q: Right. And other women did similar things, as far as you know?",
        "A: Some of them, probably, yes. Nobody -- there was no consitent --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- to tell you what to do, yeah?",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: You acted on your own instinct, and own judgement. There you were really alone. What are\nyou doing?",
        "Q: I was just checking.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: Tell me about the bedding, the mattr --",
        "A: About what?",
        "Q: The mattress, the -- what people s -- what people slept on.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did most people have some hay, or whatever it was, what was it?",
        "A: No, no, no, we had mattresses with straw.",
        "Q: Mattresses with straw.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: So they were covered? The -- the straw was covered by some material?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, in -- yeah. It -- mattresses -- I mean, it was not a mattress like --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- you go out and buy a mattress, but it was an -- kind of an pillow k -- a large pillow cover,\nyeah, with an hole in the center, where you stuffed in straw. So it was covered, and protected,\nyeah, and then we were sleeping on that.",
        "Q: And how was -- how was that -- did all the bunks have that already, or did people have to\nbring it when they --",
        "A: No, no, no, the bunks had the wooden -- wooden bottom, and the blockelteste, and the block\npersonnel, had to get those from an special unit, who supplied mattresses, and the straw, yeah.\nThey -- that had to be carried from an special unit, into the block.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And how long did they -- one mattress --",
        "A: Forever.",
        "Q: You just -- that was it?",
        "A: All the time.",
        "Q: It was all the time, they didn\u2019t change those?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So after awhile, because of --",
        "A: They were thrown out, and I -- they were ye -- probably full of urine, or who knows what.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: After awhile, but it took awhile.",
        "Q: Pretty un --",
        "A: But -- huh?",
        "Q: Go ahead.",
        "A: Again, you had to s -- you had to ask for it, and then you had -- you were supplied with -- you\nhave -- or they arranged the supply of any request from time to time, yeah.",
        "Q: And in the beginning, did you sleep alone on the -- on the bunk, or did you have two, or three,\nor four people?",
        "A: 15.",
        "Q: 15 on one?",
        "A: On -- on one bunk, yeah.",
        "Q: 15?",
        "A: 15.",
        "Q: Short people?",
        "A: You mean -- which bunks?",
        "Q: Well, when you first came into Auschwitz one --",
        "A: Ah, Auschwitz one, we were on the floor.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Then we were in wooden beds, there were no bunks.",
        "Q: Okay. Wooden beds?",
        "A: In vi -- wooden beds, those t-t-tri -- t-three bunk --",
        "Q: Yeah, bunk beds.",
        "A: Bunk bed, ah. There were always two people in one.",
        "Q: So did you s --",
        "A: We were never alone, never alone.",
        "Q: So did you sleep head to foot?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: One person\u2019s head on one side, and --",
        "A: Foot -- foot -- foot and head.",
        "Q: Yeah. And when you went --",
        "A: And if you were more on the loving side, and you had your lover, then were sleeping the way\nyou wanted, right?",
        "Q: Uh-uh.",
        "A: But normally people slept so that we could accommodate ourselves.",
        "Q: And were there a lot of relationships that were closer than --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: There were?",
        "A: As -- it was actually introduced by -- in the beginning, not amongst the Jewish girls, but in the\nbeginning, where we had so many German from Ravensbriick, the first thousand, you had many\nwho were there for years, in Ravensbriick, and they have developed some relationship among\nthemselves, and those who had no partners, were looking -- seeking for partners amongst the\nJewish women. And Jewish women were introduced to lesbianism, as German women from\nRavensbritck. They didn\u2019t know one thing, they didn\u2019t know the difference, they didn\u2019t know\nanything, yeah. So, it was very hard to distinguish who is really a partner or not. But people were\nlooking for love, and warmth, and companionship. They\u2019re lonely.",
        "Q: Was that helpful to people, you think?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I have never experienced anything, because I had friends from home, from the\nyouth movement and so on, so we were used to live together in the summer camps, and so on. So\nthere was no lack of -- lack of -- we were not lonely, yeah. Girls from school, neighbors, we\nalways were seeking for some old relationship from home. We were young then, and sports --\nfrom the sports club, or so on. So it -- it -- if is me, I had no -- I personally had no problems, I\nalways had company, and that was good enough.",
        "Q: Wh-When you think about the majority of women that you knew, not just -- not just your\nclose friends, but people that you saw.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: Did they tend to have a relationship with one person, or two people -- no -- including people\nwho became lovers, but was that more typical?",
        "A: [indecipherable] it -- look, the -- the problem among the people was -- was a language, yeah?\nIt\u2019s not enough just to be attracted by a body, right? In those days, we needed communication.\nYou had to learn how to survive, you had to learn many things, and that couldn\u2019t be done without\nan verbal communication. So, people who knew the language, the German women, spoke\nGerman. Our women, from Slovakia in the beginning, spoke enough German to communicate.\nThey were -- but we were mainly looking for the companionship of political prisoners, because\nthose who were professional prostitutes, were not very attractive to us, they were different, was\nan different -- different category of people. And the political prisoners had their own\ncompanionship with -- since Ravensbrick, who -- there were couples who were already\nestablished couples. And those who had no partner were not even seeking for any partner,\nbecause they had their husbands at home, or in -- during the war, somewhere on the front, or they\nwere old, and were never married, and had no -- didn\u2019t know what it means to have a partner at\nall, yeah, spinsters, who were -- but they were decent people who were idealists, because that\nwas the reason why they were put into the camp as Socialists or Communists. So, I myself\nalways looked for good people. I had an good friend who was the wife of an -- she was German,\nbut had an Jewish husband, and two sons at home. And she practiced, more or less, medicine.\nWe had such different ailments, like in civilian life, all of a sudden, everybody -- most of the\nwomen -- at least I, among others, we were lot an -- pus in my whole mouth, yeah. Between the\nteeth, the tongue, everything. I couldn\u2019t talk, I couldn\u2019t swallow, I couldn\u2019t do nothing. It was an\nawful situation. I don\u2019t know where from, how she got it, she was coming every day with\nsomething. And I had to keep that in my mouth for awhile, and then spit it out, and she cured me,\nyeah. Because she knew from experience, what to do under the camp conditions. Having her\nhusband to probably practice medicine there an different way, but I had an woman what -- during\nmy malaria attacks, who was an Jehovah Witness, who brought -- and worked in the SS\npharmacy. They were stealing every day, one tablet of shineen, yeah.",
        "Q: What is shineen?",
        "A: Shineena. That is the medication if you have malaria. Shining, hining, shining, how do you\npronounce it? C-h-1-n-1-n-e. Good?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So, I had a pool of helpers help us, yeah? Of good people, and I would not s -- would not deal\nwith -- with the rough or low -- low grade -- low grade morally, low grade people. I -- I was\nselective, and that was my luck, yeah. Could speak the language, and it was my luck that I was\nselective. And so -- but nobody approached me, ever.",
        "Q: But --",
        "A: I was an ugly -- must have been very ugly with my short hair.",
        "Q: Sippy, I remember --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: -- when -- when Irwin was alive --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: -- and talked to me about this when we -- when we all would talk about it. And he said that --\nand it wa -- I\u2019m not now talking about lesbian relationships, but --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- he said that men did not pair bond, and women tended to pair bond. Insofar as you know, is\nthat the case, that women tended, whether they were lovers or not --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- to be with one other person, very close?",
        "A: You always had an camp sister.",
        "Q: Yeah? You always had a camp sist --",
        "A: If nothing, always. Why? It was practical, more practical to have two rations together to\nshare, than to have only one ration, yeah. You could manipulate, if you had two pieces of bread,\ntwo rations, and two pieces or margarine, yeah, you could go and use together only one ration of\nmargarine together. Limit yourself. And one ration of bread, but exchange the other half for\nsomething which was more important than the ration, yeah? And I was never in the exchange\nbusiness, but n -- I had a partner, a very religious girl, whom I found there in the camp office. I\nhave known her brother at home, and because of that she was more attracted -- I was more\nattracted to her, and she trusted me. With her I was even sleeping together in one bed. She\nbecame my partner, but very religious. And she\u2019s still alive, she lives in Jerusa -- in the --\nJerusalem. She was a business women. She went out and exchanged sometimes, she returned\nwith some garlic, or with an onion, yeah, what the girls were smuggling in from the field where -\n- where they had to perform. Now, I knew that that is important, more important than a piece of\nbread, so if we were eating garlic, and onions with margarine on bread. Even if only half of it\nwat -- the vitamins were more important than the starch, yeah? So that was an relationship where\nshe was a businesswoman, she supplied me with all the goodies, and -- but she became my -- my\nca -- then later on, I became to shabbas goy, it was Pesach, and she wouldn\u2019t eat bread, so we\nhad to exchange the bread against potatoes. And we had to cook the potatoes illegally. I had\nalready my drawing office, I had an stove, yeah. So I cooked inside of the stove, because outside\nwe were not allowed to sh -- to cook. And that was an relationship of eating together, and do-\ndoing business together, and most girls v -- eat -- nobody was eating alone, that -- I can tell you\nthat. Th-That was an -- an habit, to have an partner with to eat, yeah, together. So, I don\u2019t know\nif the men did it. Irwin must have known better. I never spoke with him about it.",
        "Q: He said no.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: He said no.",
        "A: He said no. But maybe in his experience.",
        "Q: You're right. It-It\u2019s hard -- it\u2019s hard to -- to generalize with so many thousands of people.",
        "A: Yeah, but that was -- had nothing to do with love, or with lesbianism, or --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It was just a necessity of going to an restaurant, you\u2019d rather sit with somebody and eat\ntogether, than to be alone in an corner. Right, or not?",
        "Q: Yeah, sure.",
        "A: Same, I mean we were human, the same feelings, the same instinct.",
        "Q: But it -- it -- it --",
        "A: Among women, it was more important, no?",
        "Q: Perhaps, than for the men.",
        "A: Yeah. I can -- have never experien -- sometimes you had only one -- one -- what\u2019s his name?\nBowl. So you were forced to eat two people out of one bowl, yeah.",
        "Q: One bowl.",
        "A: If they like it or not.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And we\u2019re entitled to two bowls of soup, so once they\u2019ve finished the first, they could collect\nthe second, but they were forced to eat together, or they had only one spoon, or -- look, they\nwere [indecipherable] funny circumstances, which drove you into -- into together in, yeah. It was\nnot the -- the men probably had their own bowl, and could eat their own soup by themselves,\nyeah.",
        "Q: And why would that be the case? Was the s -- was the circumstances in the men\u2019s camp\ndifferent --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- and better than the women\u2019s? Physical circumstances.",
        "A: It depend -- Irwin was never in Birkenau.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah. So, c-call mine was different, and in Auschwitz, he was better off than anybody in\nBirkenau, and still he described in his book his -- the camaraderie between an couple of men,\namong themselves, how they manage. That is an good book he wrote, yeah. But noth -- n-no\nmystery, and no I -- I -- I, yeah? It\u2019s very well done. I will give you one book to carry with you,\nbecause whenever you will have a chance to have somebody who speaks German, it will be\nhelpful to translate you an little bit --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- step by step, bit by bit, yeah. Do you think I\u2019m right?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Good. Now, what else please?",
        "Q: I\u2019m just trying to think if there\u2019s --",
        "A: It -- does that answer what you -- your question about the camaraderie? The shortage of bowls\n-- bowls, or bowels?",
        "Q: Bowls.",
        "A: Bowls?",
        "Q: Yes, bowels are different.",
        "A: Okay, b-o -- b-o-w-l, yeah?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And bowel is?",
        "Q: B-o-w-e-l.",
        "A: E-I? Uh huh.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Bowel movement.",
        "Q: Right, so it\u2019s different, yeah.",
        "A: Good, now I know.",
        "Q: But Sippy, let me ask you something. If you have among the women, ha -- mainly pairs --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- sometimes it may be three or four --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- but mainly it was two people.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What did that mean between those two people, and another two people? Was there -- di --\nwere there circumstances where there were a lot of difficulties in a barrack between groups of\npeople, either groups of different nationalities, or -- no. But everybody wasn\u2019t nice to each other?",
        "A: Everybody wasn\u2019t what?",
        "Q: Nice. It was a difficult circumstance, so people have complicated ways of --",
        "A: Look, the people amongst themselves in the barrack, if th-they were living in an barrack, and\nworked in the same work detail, yeah, are so tired at the evening, and were so busy to look after\ntheir own business. That means eating, and sleeping, yeah. There was no time for being nice or\nnot nice. You will have today among people in good conditions living, neighbors are fighting\nneighbors, yeah. It\u2019s human. Some people, they\u2019re fighting with their mouths, yeah. Fist fights,\nnobody wanted to lose any energy. So it\u2019s harmless if you scream at each other. I don\u2019t even\nconsider that as not nice, just human to let it out. And I really don\u2019t know -- or don\u2019t think that to\nmake an big issue out of it. People were very tense, or weak, or tired, or sleepy, or hungry. So\nsometimes they screamed at each other, and screaming is harmless. I don\u2019t think that screaming\nis a crime. Not even if the blockelteste were scre -- the blockeltestes were screaming. To -- to\njudge blockelteste and other screaming personnel, f -- only for one reason that they were\nscreaming, is not justified.",
        "Q: Sippy, you not only didn\u2019t have watches, you didn\u2019t have calendars, right?",
        "A: Uh-huh, yeah.",
        "Q: So how -- if people were religious, whether they were Christian, or they were Jewish, how did\nthey find out, and how did they respond to the various holidays, as far as you remember\u2019?",
        "A: First of all, newcomers brought in the news of the day --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- and events.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Some had contact through the camp office. One person only, she wer -- was able to discover\nthe date, or the -- yeah, that spreads very quickly. There was the latrines, where people have\ncommunicated, even if they have known each other. That was no problem.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: That was no problem. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So the people tried to celebrate holidays?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Did you?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. No holidays, didn\u2019t matter?",
        "A: My religious girl, she -- she knew everything.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: She had the calendar, we had in the camp office a day, and everything. There were\nnewcomers who brought exactly the -- all news in, and cross -- cross we -- we could cross check,\nor they could cross check the Jewish holidays. But it had no -- no significance for me personally,\nbecause to be in a place like that, it -- 1t could have become schizophrenic, to be in the hell, and\nto -- and to sing like in heaven, yeah.",
        "Q: And -- and you -- this religious -- this woman who was your -- your partner --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- who was religious, what did she do about being kosher?",
        "A: Kosher? She was not eating anyth -- any sausage --",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: -- when we had -- when we had the rations. I gaved her my cheese, and she gave me her\nsausage. So I ate her sausage too, and she was eating my cheese.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And that how we managed. Pesach she was not eating any bread, but she was living on\npotatoes, and that was it.",
        "Q: I\u2019m stopping the tape.\nEnd of Tape Six, Side A\nBeginning Tape Six, Side B",
        "Q: Tape number six, side B, United States Holocaust Memorial interview with Helen Tichauer,\nSeptember eighth. Sippy, what did runners do?",
        "A: Who?",
        "Q: Runners. Like Mala.",
        "A: Oh, runner.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: There were different types of runners. There were even runners, I can show you very nice\npictures of Indian tribes in the old times, and Indian tribes today, South American Indian tribes,\nwhere people live in the high plateau of the Andean mountains, where they have no other\ncommunication, like verbal communication between one tribe and another, by using individuals,\nthe so-called runners, yeah? They walk from one village to another and communicate, or convey\nmessages, and so on. So the runner business is not an invented one of the concentration camp,\nbut as we had no vehicles, the ter -- the distances between camp -- in the camp, between\nbarracks, were pretty large. Bicycles were not used for -- for -- inmates couldn\u2019t u -- did not have\nany bicycles, only the SS, some of them were able to use bicycles. The SS runners actually had\nbicycles. An runner is somebody who conveys messages, or who has an job to do, to do it fr --\n[indecipherable] from one point to another, and ha -- with a certain order to do something, to\nbring some people from one barrack to -- to another, to -- to the front entrance for any reason, or\nto -- 1S a Messenger service, more or less. Now, there were no -- no other way of communication,\nno-not even telephones, yeah. They have used people who were messengers, yeah. So,\nsometimes they had dual -- an dual duty. Sometimes they were runners who were sent from one -\n- from the main e -- from the camp office, for example, to an barrack, and convey an message or\nask the blockelteste to come to the camp office, or some similar orders were given from\nheadquarters, from the t-top management to us, and we had to execute that through the runners,\nyeah. Through those people who are sending them through different barracks, or different\nfacilities to -- to convey an certain order, or message, or whatever. And they work mainly in\ncouples. When the one couldn\u2019t do it, then the other took over, yeah, or when one was on lunch\nbreak, or in the toilet, and something has to be done in a hurry, the other took over. They were\ncouples molis. But then you had an other function of certain runners, who made an -- had an du-\ndual function. They were multi-lingual, and could be used as translators. So, such, for example,\nwas Mala, was an runner, and an translator between German and French, and German and I think\nPolish, she could speak Polish.",
        "Q: That\u2019s Mala Zeemadbel.",
        "A: Zeema, yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Then you had another runner, which was -- and an translator, which was not one to be\nidentified, but I know where -- her name, and I know where she lives. Her maiden name then\nwas Ava Pomeranz. She was an -- an -- one of those runners who took, like Mala, and many\nothers, who were taking sometimes people from the camp office, who were asked to report to our\ncamp office, and were then taken for -- with those runners, and an SS man, over to the Gestapo\nfor interrogation, yeah. That was one of the activities, too, to accompany certain people who\nhave to appear at the SS headquarters in the shtopskaboida for interrogation. That was ma -- one\nof the main activities of the shtopskaboida of personnel, SS with their secretaries. Now, there\nwas Mala, there was Ava Pomeranz, and so on. So, there are some still alive, and I know where\nthey are, and I even made myself a list of all the runners. So, 1t was an important activity,\nbecause without telephone, and without vehicles, and with such an big enterprise was -- there\nwas SO many movements going -- so many things going on, that they had that -- that it was a\nmessenger service among others, yeah.",
        "Q: So -- so at any one time, about how many runners would there be?",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: You think?",
        "A: Wait a minute, [indecipherable] and two, four, six -- I would say a dozen.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, and where were they living? Were there -- was there a particular --",
        "A: As a -- in the individual barracks, or th-they were not living in private rooms, just located\nclose to -- in -- they were living in -- in barracks, just like anybody else.",
        "Q: Did they have -- did they have a particular insignia on their arm or something --",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",
        "Q: -- to -- so that --",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",
        "Q: -- she was -- they were clear that th --",
        "A: You must realize that the la -- if it comes to insignias on the arms, there were the ar -- the arm\nbins, yeah?",
        "Q: Arm bands?",
        "A: Bands, yeah. The la -- you had n-n-nearly every function was marked, yeah, in the camp. The\nblockelteste, the block administrator, the lagerelteste, the rapport schreiber, the -- every runner.\nMany, many people were marked so that you could recognize who they are. And at the\nworkplace, the same thing. You had the kapos, the sub-kapos, the foremen, and many other\nfunctions in the wor -- at the workplace, were still -- were marked just the same. So that wasn\u2019t\nmy job to do just the same, I did all those -- those arm --",
        "Q: Arm -- arm bands?",
        "A: Correct, so I -- as you can see, I had an important job, yeah?",
        "Q: So what sort of an insignia did the runner have? What did it say?",
        "A: Runner, it was --",
        "Q: It said runner. And what is that in German?",
        "A: [indecipherable] lotfa.",
        "Q: Loifa.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And did they -- were they considered privileged in some way? Were they not in --",
        "A: They were privileged, yeah of course, they had an job where they could enter any building,\nwhere they could run, or be outdoors any time of the day, even if there was curfew during an\nselection. That -- that was it.",
        "Q: So do you think that some of these people actually ended up being in touch with the resistance\nbecause they could then bring messages, or was that --",
        "A: They ended up like what?",
        "Q: Were some of these women --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: -- I don\u2019t know about the men, I\u2019m assuming the men had runners, too.",
        "A: Yeah, good, of course.",
        "Q: Do you think they were -- some of them were in contact with the resistance, because then they\ncould --",
        "A: With whom?",
        "Q: Resistance.",
        "A: Oh. I cannot answer that.",
        "Q: But it would be an opportunity, right, because you could bring messages? They could bring\nmore than just the --",
        "A: Because you have an idea, do you think the SS wouldn\u2019t have had the same idea?",
        "Q: Of course they\u2019d have the same idea. That doesn\u2019t mean it wouldn\u2019t happen.",
        "A: So, you had -- you had -- you were very careful, because you see, if you -- everybody was\ncareful with those people, you never know for whom they are running, yeah?",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh, right. No matter which side, yes.",
        "A: People in the resistance were not visible.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Right. Of course.",
        "A: If todays -- ev -- anybody who\u2019s telling you the story, resistance [indecipherable], they were\ninvisible people.",
        "Q: But somebody was in it.",
        "A: But they were not visible.",
        "Q: Right, right. And do you not trust the people who\u2019ve talked afterwards about being in the\nresistance?",
        "A: Everybody\u2019s telling you now he was in the resistance, now what kind of business is that?",
        "Q: Tell me about Mala Zeemadbel, what kind of a person she was.",
        "A: Selfish, stupid girl.",
        "Q: Selfish, stupid girl.",
        "A: Show-off, big mouth. She had her own contact reels, yeah, the Belgian Jewesses, and she\ncould help, because she could come into our office, and ask for favors any time, and she was\n[indecipherable] yeah. Any time, she -- she had to go through us. And if she needed something,\nshe could come and ask for a favor. But what we are talk -- making out of her, it\u2019s nonsense. If\nshe wouldn\u2019t have been stupid, she wouldn\u2019t have planned -- or she actually didn\u2019t planned her\nescape. If she wouldn\u2019t have been stupid, she wouldn\u2019t have done what she did. She had all the\nchances to survive. What was the hurry?",
        "Q: So why did she do it? Because she\u2019s stupid?",
        "A: Look, when she arrived, I was then still working -- you know I worked in the -- among others\nas the printer of those numbers --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- fo -- f-for newcomers, yeah? New arrivals.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: I was there when she arrived with an Belgian transport.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It was late afternoon, must have been winter off -- late afternoon, but it was dark. So there\nwere -- I -- I don\u2019t know how many hundreds newcomers and to register them, and to process so\nmany, and until they are passing through everything, and finally got their numbered labels, and --\nsewn on, they were standing in one corner, and waiting until the whole group was processed, and\nafter that, the blockelteste, for whom they were designated to be transferred, was coming, and\ntook them to their barracks -- to the barracks. And that what happened with that particular\ntransport when she arrived, where she was in the Belgian transport. I was sitting there, and\nwatching, and all of a sudden, somebody went up on a table like that, and giving orders to the\ncrabat -- to the whole group. She didn\u2019t know, is she crazy? I went over to her, and I said, \u201c\u201cWhat\nare you doing here? Get down from the table.\u201d She didn\u2019t understood. I said, \u201cGet down. Look,\nyou are now in Auschwitz. You are not in Belgium, I don\u2019t want you to show off. The moment\nyou show off, you\u2019 ve -- the SS will remember you. Get down off here -- from here. Get off the\ntable.\u201d So, a-after awhile she went down. And then the next days -- she took over leadership,\nyeah? Next days, she was presented by the blockelteste as somebody who speaks languages. In\nthe arbatz einsatz, yeah. Was in our building, in our office, in our [indecipherable] my drawing\noffice, so she was sent -- given the job as an runner. And from the runner, she became translator,\nboth. And from there on, she had every day to come in the morning to the camp office, and take\norders, and what to do, and what [indecipherable] she got her work order every day, in the\nmorning. And that\u2019s the way how I have been with her on an daily basis, and I met her every\nday, and it was a normal relationship between me and the others. But that\u2019s the way -- that\u2019s the\ntime when we met for the first time, and when I jumped at her to get off, yeah. Because wa -- the\nmoment the SS noticed somebody with such qualities, they picked you and made -- gave to you\nan big job as an -- as an camp vi -- I don\u2019t know what, and it was not very nice to witness\nsomebody to be recruited f-for an cruel job, yeah? So in any case, that went on, on and on. She\ndid her job, and she was coming every day, and when she needed some favors to help the girls\nfrom Belgium, she had an easy -- easy approach to us, because we helped her. Now -- then, all of\na sudden, the day when she escaped, you know that she had malaria, and she used to have attacks\nfrom time to time, and we knew that. The day when she escaped, same day I we -- she was living\non number six barrack, in the barrack where the people from the -- the klidonskcamera, they are\nliving. And I went at lunchtime, over to six. There was Ava, my friend who lives now in Israel,\nwhose husband I made for -- the sign, yeah.",
        "Q: What\u2019s her last name? Ava?",
        "A: Valansuela is her name now.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, alright.",
        "A: And I went over with her because I think some of the Poles -- Polish men were coming, and\nwanted to meet with the girls in my office, I always vacated my office, I d -- I went walking. I\nwent over to Ava, to number six. Four, five, six, and Ava had a boyfriend, he was visiting her, an\nDutch boy, so I didn\u2019t wanted to interfere. Then I finally noticed the barrack was totally empty,\nbut -- because they were working in the beglidinskammer the whole barrack, but there was Mala\nin her bed, and next to her, her boyfriend Edek, standing next to her. So I thought she had again\nher malaria attack, yeah. I went over, and went to ask her how she 1s, here was Edek standing,\nshe seemed to me quite normal, so she had no -- no malaria attack, so I didn\u2019t wanted to\ninterfere. He visited her, okay. Why she was in bed, I wi -- don\u2019t know. In any case, I left. An\nhour later, the siren went on. That was the last moment before she escaped, I may have been the\nlast person who ever spoke to her, yeah. Now, s -- they were caught, there are several stories, but\nit is true that she had a malaria attack during her ordeal, and while escaping, and he panicked,\nand went to the village doctor. And that was it.",
        "Q: And the doctor told on them?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: The doctor contacted the Germans?",
        "A: So the rest is history.",
        "Q: But what\u2019s the --",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: -- from -- from your perspective, the different stories about what happened afterwards.",
        "A: What stories do you know?",
        "Q: There -- there stories that she -- when she was going to be hung, she had a razor blade, and\nshe had cut herself.",
        "A: That is true. She had the razor blade from Herta -- Herta Rote, who was another lifer, who\u2019s\ndead by now, and she cut herself.",
        "Q: And this was before they took her to be hung?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: When she was --",
        "A: She wasn\u2019t hung.",
        "Q: She wasn\u2019t hung?",
        "A: No, no. They wanted to hang her, she cut herself. According -- you see, I always avoided\nanything like being present. Everybody had to come and to witness that, the whole camp. And I\nlocked myself up in my drawing office, nobody could see me, that I am there, and I never went\nto the execution, yeah. And so I cannot tell you what really happened, but according to the\nothers, she cut herself, she was supplied by Herta Rote with an razor blade, and Mandel -- see,\naccording to the people, she was hitting Mandel with her bloody hand in her face. Then she was\nordered -- then -- then the Hauptchafuehrer Maul, ordered her to carry her into the crematorium,\nwhere she was shot by him, and that was it. Then the father of the -- Edek was brought in from\nan village, was hanged 1n front of his son, and then he was hanged. So that was an badly planned\nescape. That was selfishness. She put so many people into -- into trouble, and lost her life. And\nshe could have survived easily, like all us, and could have led a normal life. She had an\nboyfriend at home that she abandoned for Edek. I don\u2019t think she was very clever.",
        "Q: What year was that? When did she --",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: What year was that when she escaped?",
        "A: \u00b044.",
        "Q: \u00b044, and she arrived there in \u201943?",
        "A: Ah, wait a minute, what are you talking about?",
        "Q: When did Mala arrive in Auschwitz, do you remember?",
        "A: Arrive?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Ah, \u201940 -- \u00b043. End -- no, end of \u201942.",
        "Q: End of \u201942.",
        "A: End of \u201942.",
        "Q: And this was the summer of \u201944 when she escaped?",
        "A: Escaped, yeah. But I would not like to bring Mala in at all, because everybody writes about\nMala, Mala, so let\u2019s everybody -- I -- I have -- I knew her on the first day she arrived.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I spoke to her the last hour before she left, yeah? That is all I rem -- will -- want to remember.",
        "Q: Yeah. Tell me about Rosa Robbat. What was she like?",
        "A: A normal girl. Very clever, very shrewd, and s -- again, as they had no Polish Jewish girls in\nthe camp office whatsoever, they had a hard time to help each other to get -- Polish Jewish girls\nhad no good positions because of that. So, there were some work details which were better. For\nexample, the work details, indoor work details, yeah. Pretty good, and [indecipherable] the\nPolish girls could be accommodated. Rosa helped -- tried to help them through me, yeah. She\nmade contact with me, and whenever she needed something, she approached me, and I helped\nher. But sh -- I was never recruited by her for anything else, yeah. We had an entire different\nrelationship. She knows -- she had what she wanted from me, I had what I wanted from her. I --\nShe organized for me all my underpanties, and all the ma -- bowls of -- rolls of material to make,\nquickly, handkerchiefs for your head, to cover when newcomers arrived, especially from my\ncity, in the lase -- late autumn, \u201944. She brought me a lot of material when I could go to the\nbarrack, and supply the people, they never received -- it was cold, [indecipherable]. They never\nreceived any covers, so there where she helped me, and she helped me to steal from the clothing\nbarrack, whatever -- whatever I needed, and I helped her by placing people, whenever she asked\nme. Then, that\u2019s about it.",
        "Q: But what about the aprons, didn\u2019t she --",
        "A: Well, shall I tell you the story?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Did I told you the story already?",
        "Q: I think you did. I think on the phone once, you told me some of it, but I --",
        "A: Yeah, she brought me s -- always a custom tailored aprons, of -- so I accepted that, because\nwe were -- that was very fashionable in the camp office, to have over your dress a nice apron,\nyeah.",
        "Q: A regular -- like a kitchen apron?",
        "A: No, no --",
        "Q: No [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- nicely -- nicely tailored.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: Yeah, they were pretty. I maybe have to make one to sketch how they look like. And from\ntime to time she was coming pretty frequent to exchange, bought me a new one, took the old one.\nAnd I always begged her, I don\u2019t need more aprons, and leave me the one. \u201cNo, I want you to\nhave it.\u201d So, by now I am -- I was -- and later on, when all that happened, I was suspicious if\nthey didn\u2019t -- if she did not use me as an carrier of her -- of her -- of her smuggled stuff, because\nI remember later on that the aprons had one -- were nicely sewn, but at the end, they had\nsomething like that, yeah, two or three seams at -- at the end of the --",

        "A: -- that she\u2019s -- was hiding stuff, because she supplied those I -- aprons to several people who\nwere in high positions, yeah, probably knowing that nobody\u2019s going to -- to check their -- their\nbelongings what they wear. And that\u2019s the way -- I have never spoke to anybody about it, but\nthat must have been the reason, yeah? And among others, she used me, too. So, what can I tell\nyou? Then she collected the apron, and brought me a new one. So she -- I don\u2019t know what -- she\ncollected probably the one which was full of stuff, and brought me one empty. And that\u2019s how\nshe worked, because for what reason she brought me aprons?",
        "Q: Right. Many --",
        "A: Can you imagine? Huh? Then I have found an -- a woman, I still have to look for it, in\nAustralia, who brought an story that she had -- she was sewing aprons for -- for -- for Rosa.\nSpecial ones, yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Were you surprised when they were captured, the [indecipherable |",

        "A: No, I was not.",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t?",
        "A: I was not, no. I was not. We had -- she was among those people I like, and we had nice chats\ntogether, but she never recruited me, also. She asked me for favors, I asked her for favors, but\nthat was normal business, like to help the people, yeah. And it -- because she has -- I knew that\nthere are no Polish Jewish girls in the camp office, so I gladly helped her out.",
        "Q: Now why was that the case? Why were there no Polish Jewish girls in the camp office?",
        "A: Because the camp office had a lot of Pole -- Poles, non-Jews. Camp office, and the arbatz\neinsatz, yeah, and the rest were Slovakian girls. We were there before the Poles, before the\nPolish Jews, and the Poles were more or less simultaneously coming with us around the same\ntime. So, we have occupied the good places, while the Poles -- Polish girls had no German\nknowledge, yeah.",

        "A: That was among others there mi [indecipherable] their disadvantage.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And that\u2019s about it.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: There\u2019s no more to add. Everything else is speculation and is blow -- blow -- blown up into\nsomething so that people can write. But Rosa Robbata was an ordinary girl, who just did what\nshe felt is important, and she did it skillfully, and I don\u2019t know how she gots -- how she -- how\nshe was caught.

        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: Who were the people with the --",

        "A: Understood.",
        "Q: Understood what you were saying, and were able to concentrate on that.",
        "A: Yeah. So that was their bad luck.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right, absolutely.",
        "A: What about you?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t remember me. I probably didn\u2019t know what to make of anything. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t\nremember it, Sippy, I really don\u2019t.",
        "A: I --",
        "Q: So let me ask you this. I\u2019m going to continue what you just said to me when we were off the\ntape. When -- when Anna Polarchik was being interviewed, she made some statement that she\nthought you were in the underground.",
        "A: It\u2019s on her interview, in Polish.",
        "Q: Right, right, right, right.",
        "A: Not she thinks, she is sure.",
        "Q: She\u2019s sure. Okay. So what -- what is 1t about what you were doing that would make\nsomebody think that -- that you might have been in --",
        "A: I had an daily visitor, and that was a man, an Pole, who was known -- who was the only man\nwho was living in the women\u2019s camp. And his name was En -- Hen -- Henyek Borepsky. Henyek\nBorepsky was the official electrician, who was in charge of checking the wirings, electric wiring,\nall over the whole area. Henyek Borepsky was the one who buried s -- many of the Jewish and\nnon-Jewish reports the people wrote in all their languages, in -- who buried that during our stay\nthere, and then after the war, made it possible to un-bury the stuff. We have more stuff, the\ninformation we had after the war, thanks to him, and due to him. Now, he isn\u2019t -- he isn\u2019t quoted\nin most of the literature by important historians, like Lunkbine mentioned him too, but he is\ndescribed very well in the book by -- called \u201cFighting Auschwitz,\u201d yeah?",
        "Q: By Garlinsky.",
        "A: As he visited me every day, she didn\u2019t know what business he has to do with me, yeah? Who\nam -- what -- otherwise he -- there was no love affair, he was not my boyfriend. He was just\nvisiting me, and she doesn\u2019t know what we -- what business we had to do, except he was the\nrepresentative of the top man, who was leading the Polish underground, yeah? So that why she\nsuspected me, I must have had something to do with them. That\u2019s all. And he asked me for\nhundred thousand things to do for him, and I never have asked any questions, I did it. So, I\nprobably worked for the Polish underground without know -- I knew I worked for somebody, or\nI did things for somebody, but I have not ask any questions. That was an very basic rule, if you\ndo something, either you do it or not, and if you are doing it, don\u2019t ask questions, because what\nyou know -- you should never know, in case you were caught.",
        "Q: So why -- why -- were there people that you refused to do things for? No.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So you trusted -- 1s 1t because the right kind of people came to you, and you trusted them?",
        "A: Because it was very hard to approach me.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: For men. So -- you could not enter the camp office just like that, yeah.",
        "Q: So who --",
        "A: And -- and you had no -- and people I have not known of through -- even if not talking to\neach other, but there were, in certain jobs established -- for example, I'll give you another\nexample. You know Gerovitch?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: He was an outsider of everything. He was an Bundist, but there was one leader of the -- of the\nBundists, whom he mentioned in his interview, and that was Nonyek. Nonyek was an French and\nPolish Jew who was coming from France. Later on, he became an medical student, after the war,\nand practiced medicine. But it was Nonyek whom was one day arrived to the camp office,\nstraightforward to me, and said, \u201cSippy, I need the figures of French women, how many arrived\nup til now, and how many are still alive.\u201d Now, I could have told him, \u201cWhy do you ask me, ask\nsomebody else,\u201d yeah? But I had access. He researched me before he came. I had access to\neverything, because I designed the card totake, yeah. So I --",
        "Q: Designed the what?",
        "A: The card totake. The types of cardex.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I designed it.",
        "Q: Yeah, I know, but you just use -- you used a word, what\u2019s that word? Cardatteck?",
        "A: Cardex 1s an --",
        "Q: Cardex.",
        "A: Cardex.",
        "Q: Okay. So he knew that?",
        "A: I knew that -- I knew -- they knew that I -- I can have the access to it, because nobody would\nhave questioned me, what are you doing there, right? So, I -- and two minutes later, I was\ncoming with the answer. After all, I had constant reports of certain things, I told you that I did\nthe diagrams and so on, so I didn\u2019t -- I knew exactly w-w-what to look for, and where to look\nfor, and quickly, so that -- because there could have been any time, somebody coming from the\nSS, and so on. But we always had some people out at the door entrance to watch out. In any case,\nNonyek arrived, and asked me for information. He got the information, which he reported\nafterwards, but I couldn\u2019t care less how, and to whom. But I know through Gerovitch now, in his\ninterview, that Nonyek was the leader of the Bund, okay? So that what I\u2019m trying to tell you. I\nhaven\u2019t ask him what do you need that for? When I noticed he was coming with something\nimportant, of question, he got his answer. And that\u2019s how I worked. Whoever was coming with\nimportant questions, he got his [indecipherable] he got the right answer. I don\u2019t know what I did,\nand to whom I was giving, and how much I did, yeah? Or that Henyek, what he have asked me,\nis hard to believe, but that\u2019s an whole story, you have to -- to -- Henyek was always asking me\nimpossible things.",
        "Q: Like what?",
        "A: To -- to a shell of an watch, yeah. And t-to write down doxsa, that was an trademark. I said,\n\u2018\u201cHenyek, you can get at Canada, as many doxsas you want. Why do you want me to write on\nthat particular watch, which is empty inside, doxsa?\u201d \u201cJust do it.\u201d That what he said. Now, what\nhe did afterwards with that, if they have smuggled something in the container, if that was just to\nrecognize that it is an different doxsa, because my writing and my -- must have been different\nthan the original print. But then, from then on, he was coming with similar mishugas, yeah, to do\nfor him, and I did it. I never asked any questions. But I know that not only that I did something\nvaluable, I have been protected by the Polish underground, just like they protected them --\nthemself, and their agents. That what I know. I really made my office available for their get\ntogether, yeah.",
        "Q: So you would leave?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: You would leave, they would come in and you would leave?",
        "A: Who?",
        "Q: When they got together, you left the office?",
        "A: I left the office. At -- I was running all the time around the camp, and [indecipherable]\nthought I\u2019m a runner.",
        "Q: So did they -- did they just come in and say --",
        "A: Nothing. The first time when they were coming, and all the women from everywhere were\ncoming, the first time in, they said, \u201cSippy, leave us alone.\u201d I did that, and when they co -- were\ncoming afterwards, and I left by myself.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t have to ask you.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t have to ask you.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So in what ways did they protect you?",
        "A: What can I tell you, in what way. They -- they were watching out I should -- nobody should\ndo any harm to me, yeah. They watched -- look, th-th-that -- they were an very close-knit group\nof Polish officers, and their wives, but I belong -- I was one of them, yeah?",
        "Q: Tell me how your reputation got into the men\u2019s camp. Irwin said he knew who --",
        "A: Into what?",
        "Q: Into the men\u2019s camp.",
        "A: My reputation?",
        "Q: Yes, because Irwin said one day when I was here, \u201cI knew who Sippy was.\u201d",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: I knew who Sippy was.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: Before she -- before he met you.",
        "A: Yeah. Oh, that was different. I tell you. One nice day, Hessler was coming, and said, \u201cSippy,\nwe are going to transfer you, I have now taken over some -- some duties at the onione factory.\u201d I,\nHessler.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: \u201cAnd we are going to transfer a -- you to the onione as technical draftswoman.\u201d I said, \u201cBut I\nwas not trained as an technical draftswoman. I\u2019m a graphic artist.\u201d He said to me, \u201cThe way how\nI know you, you know everything.\u201d That what Hessler said to me. So, I didn\u2019t know, but Irwin\ntold me afterwards, while we were married, what happened. S -- Hessler was coming, and\nexplained to the civilian engineers there, \u201c\u201cWe are -- we are -- we are going to get now a woman,\na draftswoman. She\u2019s very peculiar, very exact, very moody. Empty fund room for her, bring in\ninstruments, bring in everything. She will be as -- from now on, your draftswoman. And Irwin is\ngoing to supervise her.\u201d",
        "Q: So, what happened?",
        "A: I was fighting, hiding behind Katya, and Drexel, that I don\u2019t want to go. And they were\nwinning. I didn\u2019t had to go. And I never arrived to the onione. Good. So he knew that I exist, but\nhe didn\u2019t know that -- who I am, yeah. Just a woman, a draftswoman.",
        "Q: Yeah. But he knew your name?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Sippy.",
        "A: Good. Now -- then Mengele was coming. He wanted me as an draftswoman when he heard\nabout me, as a microscopic draftswoman. There I was fighting again. I am not -- I wasn\u2019t trained\nas an microscopic draftswoman. But we will find for you somebody, and we have found for him\n-- what is her name? That woman who is now fli -- claiming her work?",
        "Q: Whoop, the phone. We\u2019re back. That was the fax, not the phone.",
        "A: So, that why Irwin knew about me. I stayed at the camp office, and that was it. But we wanted\nto talk about something else. You were just s -- putting in -- in that Irwin business. What was the\nnext question?",
        "Q: No, I was asking you about the requests that people made.",
        "A: About what people\u2019s name?",
        "Q: What people were asking you to do.",
        "A: Oh. Several -- several things. No people. I have been working for the French Bund, through\nNonyek, and fr -- for the Poles.",
        "Q: Right. No, I guess it was because you were talking about the Poles, and I was ask -- then\nasking you how did Irwin hear about you. And that\u2019s -- and that\u2019s how --",
        "A: Oh, right, but that how, yeah?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Because that was just an one ti -- time when he was fighting for my transfer --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- but lost, yeah?",
        "Q: Right. That\u2019s such a co -- funny coincidence, isn\u2019t it?",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s an funny coincidence. You know, the prostitutes in the onione, who were the\nforeman, some German women, Irwin told me even made fun out of me. They said, \u201cLook, that\nwoman, she makes -- she goes on the -- you -- you know, in German, mangeet umstreesh. If you\nare an prostitute, you are going where the stripe is marked, and that is called -- I don\u2019t know in\nEnglish, if -- if they use the word, the stripe --",
        "Q: You mean on the road?",
        "A: Yeah. For prostitutes, they -- they are not allowed to cross.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: But in Germany, it\u2019s a stree -- mangeet umstreesh, yeah? Mangeet umstreesh. Now, I painted\nthe stripes.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then [indecipherable] then she made her numbers, yeah? And th-that was an joke, but it\nwas true. Look, there was humor in Auschwitz, too.",
        "Q: Yes, I understand. Tell me something about revenge.",
        "A: Revenge?",
        "Q: Yeah. Or let -- I can put it more simply. If there were kapos, or blockeltestes, or other\nprisoners, who were treating other people badly.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You told me a long time ago that you could get people punished. Katya could put people on a\npunishment detail.",
        "A: Yeah. Now, I tell you what we did, and I can tell you that honestly. The book of the\npunishment detail, was kept in the camp office under -- strictly under Katya\u2019s supervision. But,\nas I mentioned before to you, that most book were supplied with plain sheets, only lines, and we\nhad -- I had to put, or designs, or columns necessary for an particular situation, like block books,\nwhere we knew how many columns, and for what. So where the columns established in that br --\npunishment book, where you had the names, numbers, the punishment, the duration from, too,\nyeah? Transferred then and to -- to be released then and then. And if there were some of the\nkapos, or some of the blockelteste, who accidentally, for any reason, had -- have been transferred\nto the punishment block, if they were lousy, bad people, Katya took the liberty to ask me to\nextend the duration, okay? And that was the only way how we could take revenge on those\npeople. Now, that is unofficial, but I\u2019m telling you, that\u2019s what we did. And it was good that we\ncould do it.",
        "Q: So did -- did people understand that that\u2019s what you were doing to them --",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: -- so that -- did people know that this --",
        "A: I never menti --",
        "Q: I don\u2019t --",
        "A: -- to whom should I have spoken about it?",
        "Q: No, no, no, did they figure it out?",
        "A: They?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. They didn\u2019t?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: But you did tell me the story of one woman, who was a kapo, and that you -- somebody\nplanted cigarettes on her, so that she would get caught -- this is what you told me, so see if it\nrecalls --",
        "A: I told you this?",
        "Q: You told me this. She was sent to a punishment detail.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And then she came back.",
        "A: And?",
        "Q: And she said she wanted her old job back. And Katya, or somebody said to her, \u201cWe\u2019ll give\nyou the old job back, but if you start doing what you did before,\u201d I don\u2019t know what sort of a\nthreat there was, but there was a threat. Do you have any recollection?",
        "A: It\u2019s too -- I would have, if you would explain that the way I said it.",
        "Q: Well, Pll go back.",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "Q: We\u2019re going to stop -- we\u2019re going to stop for a moment. All right, we\u2019re now back from our\nlittle break, there was no fax. And at a later time, we\u2019ll go back to this example, and then --",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",

        "Q: Uh-huh. And why was she so respected?",

        "Q: Beatings. The regular beatings.",
        "A: Ah, beating, yeah.",
        "Q: Beating, the prisoners stopped by the end of 1943. Now this is what Irwin said.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: Irwin said the SS found it more convenient to steal things, than to beat prisoners. That\u2019s what\nhe said. But you said that while it was a standard for the dignitaries, the Germans when they\ncame in, to watch beatings at first.",
        "A: Yeah?",

        "Q: Beatings, right. So who deci -- I mean, wha -- I know this is -- sounds like stupid question.",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: But, why would they bring in these people, and then what they show them is the beating?",
        "A: Because that is --",
        "Q: Power?",
        "A: -- SS mentality, yeah. That how we deal with our prisoners.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It was part of their -- of their punishment to receive, and they were keeping that for the\nvisitors, to -- to demonstrate how they are doing it, yeah?",
        "Q: Yeah, right.",
        "A: And that\u2019s gone crazy, and crazy, and there was an doctor present, and when the people\ncollapsed, they were brought to the hospital compound, yeah. And they were mainly non-Jewish\nprisoners.",
        "Q: Who were beaten?",
        "A: Because they knew where -- ba -- mainly non-Jewish prisoners, because they were coming\nthrough an police station, or through another jail, or through -- or sentenced by an judge to -- to\nreceive the beating, yeah. They were mostly non-Jewish prisoners.",
        "Q: Did you observe these beatings?",
        "A: No, you could -- it was never an open -- open -- open show. There were always dignitaries\nthere of the camp dignitaries, or -- I was not a camp dignitary, or some SS people.",
        "Q: So they --",
        "A: And sometimes the camp dignitaries had to do the beating. And if the beating were not done\nproperly hard, then the same dignitary was put on the -- on the -- that type of tool -- not tool, an\ndesk, or whatever it -- I must show you one day how it looked. And he was beaten, or she was\nbeaten by somebody else. So, it was quite an s -- science, yeah.",
        "Q: So they didn\u2019t use it in order to show the rest of the camp?",
        "A: Oh no.",
        "Q: To frighten anyone?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No, this was really a internal show.",

I went over to her, just ask her to stop to cry, we are all in the same boat, yeah. And\nshe has no right to scream, and to cry, and to -- it will not help.

I was the only person who spoke to her, and so then,\nwe shared our belongings, the food, until we were put into the cattle car. She was in the same\ncattle car, we stick together somehow, as close as we could, because I felt I can in-influence her\nin making her a little bit more comforta -- feel comfortable, and she needed something like that,\nokay? Now, while in Birkenau, when we arrive -- no, sorry, while in Auschwitz one, when we\narrive, somehow it\u2019s her deep voice, and all that, she took -- she took control over some of the\ngirls in one of the rooms, and was made immediately an Stubendienst in charge of one room.\nAfter awhile they made her charge of the whole half of the barrack. And then she asked me -- yet\n-- but I went out to work. She asked me if I would like to stay with her, and to help. And I\nrefused, because I thought I ge -- don\u2019t want to deal with people.

        "A: If people were -- and -- and the prisoners who became, or who wanted to be in charge, they\nhad no experience of handling people, or the -- not at schools, they were not teachers, there were\nno -- so they\u2019re just ordinary house girls, yeah. Never with an -- hardly professionals. Some of\nthem had training in -- in office work, yeah. They succeeded because eventually the SS started to\norganize, together with the prisoners. I mean, food -- food had to be distributed. They didn\u2019t\nknow how to go about that. So they had to learn how to distribute food, they had to learn by -- by\nexperience, day by day, how to go about everything. So, it was not easy, it was in horrible chaos\nfor weeks, and weeks, and weeks. And eventually, after months, when the relocation of the\nwomen, in August \u00b044 -- no, \u201942, occurred, th-the relocation to Birkenau, it was still cow --\nchaotic, but people were already used to it. Roll call was -- lasted hours. The SS was never\ntrained, they were not very intelligent people. Very simple, primitive people, and they s --\nexpected that the inmates will do the job, but the inmates were not trained for such an -- a bi --\nbig masses of people to handle. They -- I mean, if that would have been -- in the men\u2019s camp, in\nAuschwitz, it was different. See, you had the prisoners, the male prisoners, were all ex-Polish\nofficers, yeah. They knew how to handle their troops, how to control. They were obey -- they\nobeyed commands, because they were treating each other still like in the army. But that was the\ndifference of the Polish male, and the older German male, of prisoners, and the women, yeah.\nNot because they were more capable, but it was an different background, yeah. We had -- many\nof the Poles were soldiers, ex-soldiers. The Germans were ex-soldiers too, or had military\ntraining, or had the -- were -- for example, we had a lot of s -- people who were in the Spanish\nCivil War, amongst the Germans. So they had -- there wa -- th-there was no problem with the\nGerman male -- male pr -- with the -- the male prisoners in Auschwitz. But the problem occurred\nonly among the women, because they had no -- no military training.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, definitely. And there was no contact, and that there was an policy from the first day on,\nthat if there is any job which a woman can do, in the woman\u2019s camp, or the woman\u2019s section,\nthan the woman had -- will have preference. But if they don\u2019t find a woman, then a male will be\nbrought over to do the job, yeah. And that\u2019s how I got my job, because I had a male profession. I\nwas the only male -- woman in -- in -- in my country, in my profession, and when they were\nlooking for somebody who could mix paint out of raw material, and produce those red stripes on\nthe clothing, which I explained in prior interviews with you, they preferred me, because I was a\nwoman who worked with -- perform in the woman\u2019s camp. If they wouldn\u2019t have found\nanybody, then the male would have brought.",
        "A: They would have brought in a -- a man to do the work. So that was the difference. I -- now\nyou understand why we had such an hard life in the beginning.",
        "A: Not because we were women, we had -- we had no military training, that\u2019s what I want to say.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, a wall was built.",
        "A: A wall was built. We -- we were located in todays blocks from one to 10.",
        "A: Yeah, after 10 comes 11, th-the black wall. There were the women. And then, between us,\nparallel with those -- with the whole row, there was an wall erected.",
        "A: [Il show you that on the map, if you like.",
        "A: Uh-huh. Let me see if I can see. What have you marked here, neela?",
        "A: Now, where\u2019s from one to 11?",
        "A: Where\u2019s 11?",
        "A: Good. The wall was here.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And when we left, they removed the wall.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t tell you that, because I really couldn\u2019t te -- no, no, the kitchen was not an separate\nkitchen.",
        "A: No. There was no kitchen on the map, either.",
        "A: No, we were -- were registered very soon.",
        "A: Very soon. I would say even after two days or so, only we were not tattooed --",
        "A: -- straight away, but they have then -- we were registered. They thought we were with that\nlittle apparatus where they press the numbers in.",
        "A: Which disappeared after awhile, and then we had to do it with the double needle. I explained\nthat to you many times, right?",
        "A: So, we were registered, definitely.",
        "A: The registration was all -- that was an experienced -- experienced situation because the\nGerman concentration camp registration goes back to old times, so if you had here an couple of\nwomen were asked several questions, and you received your number, of course, and you\nreceived -- so that number you carry through the rest of your stay in the camp.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Sure. And th-this -- you see, we had in the beginning, Russian uniforms, you know that.",
        "A: From there the Russian prisoners of war. See --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: No, no, no, no.",
        "A: The Russians --",
        "A: The Russian soldiers 1n striped uniform?",
        "A: Oh look, think.",
        "A: Russian uniform from --",
        "A: -- their prisoners of war. Prisoners --",
        "A: Army uniforms, yeah.",
        "A: No, they were light, pretty light. So -- the Russian uniforms were cloths of cotton, yeah.",
        "A: And -- but they were sh-small, because they have used some disinfecting technique which\nwas shrinking.",
        "A: A steaming, yeah?",
        "A: Even the steaming -- steaming of -- facilities are still there in Auschwitz, in Birkenau, if you\ngo for a visit.",
        "A: In the back.",
        "A: Yeah, even the machine\u2019s there.",
        "A: And everything which went in are shrinking. No, anyhow, we had those uniforms, and when\nthe uniforms -- when the influx of prisoners -- of newcomers, was so big that the Russian\nuniforms wouldn\u2019t last, then they introduced civilian clotheses of people who brought their stuff.\nThey have taken all the stuff away. The good things went over to -- transported to Germany, and\nthe less good ones were distributed for newcomers. And they have -- they had to be marked with\nthe red stripes, and there where my career started, by mixing the paint and painting the stripes.\nThat was the beginning --",
        "A: -- of my real artistic --",
        "A: -- career.",
        "A: Yes, because every times they were -- somebody wanted to take my shoes away, especially\nwith the German women, stopped me constantly, and they wanted to take my shoes off, because\nthey looked so good and heavy. But they always too small, I had a small foot, and a small\nnumber, and not one of the German women was lucky enough. So I kept those shoes.",
        "A: Oh boy, that saved my life in the beginning, in spite of the fact that in -- outdoor work, we\nwere not allowed to march to the workplace with shoes, you had to go barefoot. You could only\nuse the shoes during working time.",
        "A: You ask me why? Ask me why.",
        "A: Carrying -- carrying the shoes with you, forward, and backward. What 1s it? Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Which one?",
        "A: Soon, very soon.",
        "A: Very soon.",
        "A: No --",
        "A: the men were tattooed.",
        "A: They were tattooing the men, and then the men were coming over to us, and started to tattoo\nus.",
        "A: Wait a minute, wait a minute. They never used those stamp for the men, yeah. They only\nstarted us to stamp. Somebody of the SS had an idea.",
        "A: Yeah. Bang, bang. But it didn\u2019t work.",
        "A: Then they have send us s-some man to do the tattooing. I was tattooed by -- by a man who --\nwhom -- who 1s still alive. I know him.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: And I told him to make me a smaller tattoo.",
        "A: He was my second cousin, so he obeyed.",
        "A: That she --",
        "A: That she had leadership qualities, yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no. No, she was coming from a non-Jewish background, from an different world, yeah. I\ndidn\u2019t know her background, but I knew that she -- she was good in -- in managing. She was\nmanagement trade. I think I realized that she was trained in management, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. And she was mo -- good bookkeeper. She had an good background, and she put -- she\nhad so -- understanding of American bookkeeping, yeah. For her to prepare a new system of roll\ncalls, was nothing else like the knowledge of American bookkeeping.",
        "A: She was -- she had no Jewish education.",
        "A: It\u2019s -- we don\u2019t know that.",
        "A: I have -- she did not know anything about Judaism.",
        "A: She was Jewish.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. If you have, first of all, the whole structure, you must understand\nthat you had an -- the SS structure, from top to bottom, was a military -- military-like business,\nor managerial-like business. You had top management, you had middle management, you had\nlower management.",
        "A: And each SS level had their inmate assistance, yeah?",
        "A: So, if it comes to work, yeah, is a section of inside and outside work, belonged to the German\nexpression I\u2019m going to use, the Abbatz einsatz. The work sec -- the section of -- which a-\narranged your employment, yeah, it was like an employment office, where there was an SS man\nin charge, and an assistant, which was always of -- an inmate. The inmate had to expedite the\norders of his the -- the SS person who receives the order from my level, or from -- or from, yeah,\nhigher level of s -- he -- of -- I mean, on higher authority, which was negotiating this private\ncompanies, for work -- for -- for wer -- manpower. If an factory needed workers, 500 women, for\nexample, especially women, they have asked for it, then it went over to the top man of the SS.\nHe was giving the order to the camp, a representative of his command of work det -- work work,\nlike an department of work, an office where you -- where you apply for work, yeah? Or an office\nwhich is -- I don\u2019t know the American word of comparison, a civilian comparison --",
        "A: -- but it\u2019s an department of work. You have -- say you have --",
        "A: It\u2019s like an employment office. We have had in our bu -- camp office, an section of after the\nregistration of the newcomers, which went by profession, yeah? So if they were looking for\npeople who could sew, or tailors, they need 50 tailors for an factory, they have coming to us --",
        "A: -- that we had the -- the registered people under this -- under -- the women who were telling\nus when they were registered they were tailors, yeah, or dressmakers. So we had our section by\nprofession. We had [indecipherable] by profession. We had the [indecipherable] and the -- so\nwhere -- where am I now, I\u2019m not -- I\u2019m lost. What was the question?",
        "A: Of who was in charge of the indoor and the outdoor.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: So yes, the chaos was settled gradually, by introducing the old German concentration camp\nsystem of abbatz dinkst, and abbatz einsatz.",
        "A: Two people -- two SS sections, which were dealing with -- with like an employment office,\nand the office was supplied --",
        "A: The people. Now, if they needed 500 road workers, they were just asking for 500 women next\nmorning, to be ready to march out. And then they were just taking the people from the barracks,\nand --",
        "A: -- put 500 together, and off they went. But that went always first to the SS commander, who\nasks them his counterpart of the inmate who was in charge of those [indecipherable] and -- and --\nand the work -- work force, yeah, office. Now we have no words -- I mean I\u2019m -- it\u2019s very hard\nto compare something with our civilian life, and our civilian structure. I\u2019m trying to be --",
        "A: -- as simple as possible, and to make the comparison, so it should go into your head.",
        "A: But does it answer the question?",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "A: Nothing. We -- we knew in the morning there were -- if you were in on work detail -- on\nconstant work detail, and the SS leader of the work detail, because each work detail had an SS\nleader, too, in charge, if he was happy with you, he ask for you, and you --",
        "A: -- you reported every time -- every morning to the same group of work detail. If you didn\u2019t\nwanted to go, then you were not going, yeah? Nobody -- they never knew where you are, and it\nwasn\u2019t big to [indecipherable] what is said on big, big [indecipherable] in the morning after roll\ncall, the formation of work details. So they just grabbed the people, and --",
        "A: 500 here, and 600 here, and 30 here, and that went e-every day the hunt, it was just like a\nhunt, yeah. I -- well --",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know his name, but rank was --",
        "A: -- finner his rank was an finnerish in German.",
        "A: Yeah, because --",
        "A: I tell you why, I tell you why.",
        "A: The inmate who was an kapo, a German woman, is her name there, Elli -- Elli Meyer?",
        "A: She called him her finnerish. Now, she could not know his name, or you never a-addressed\nsome SS person by his name, yeah. You called the SS people by their ranks. And that was the\nusual thing. So when she said to him a finneri, it couldn\u2019t be his name, it was his rank.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t know what\u2019s an finneri, you have to look that up in an German dictionary --",
        "A: -- what an finneri means.",
        "A: And not only that he got me an aspirin, he grabbed -- he took me in his arms, and put me on\nan -- on an pile of -- of straw, high, yeah. And was looking into his pockets for something, and\ntook an aspirin. He didn\u2019t even know that you have to take an Bayer aspirin with water.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: They hit me -- they hit -- she hit me, and --",
        "A: Because what?",
        "A: She was standing there, in front of the entrance of the infirmary, and she was hitting\neverybody, but she caught -- she hit me badly, and I knew who she was. She was hanged in\nBergen-Belsen, and yeah, yeah, yeah. One of he -- her name was Viningher. Folkenrat --\nFolkenrat. Her maiden name was Viningher. Anyway ---",
        "A: No, she was Folkenrat --",
        "A: She was known as Folkenrat, yeah. In any case, she was hitting me, and I never returned, and\nthat saved my life.",
        "A: Because I left. Because those people who were admitted, were -- never made it to Birkenau\nduring the relocation. So I -- I left, and then I approached another German woman, and told her\nabout my profession.",
        "A: Demolition work I did, I would say til end of May.",
        "A: Enough is enough, and I went -- she was in the lager aredest, her name was Ava Weigl, an\nwoman from Berlin, and I told her --",
        "A: W-e-1-g-l, yeah. Now, she said, \u201cI -- look, I know what your profession is, because my\nhusband,\u201d or my lover, whoever he was, \u201chas the same profession in Berlin.\u201d Now, a couple of\ndays later, she comes -- wait -- yeah. But she said, \u201cStay at home, don\u2019t go out to work, and if the\nSS woman Drexel,\u201d was then in charge of the roll call, \u201cif she would ask you why you are at\nhome, just tell her that Ava asked me to stay at home, because she has an job for me in the\nmaking.\u201d Now --",
        "A: What?",
        "A: That was all.",
        "A: That was it.",
        "A: I had -- I had no time to recuperate, I have been fighting for my life. It was -- I was badly,\nbadly hit.",
        "A: In any case, next -- four days later, one of the top SS men was coming and looking for\nsomebody who can mix paint, and all that, so custom that -- 1t was custom tailored for me, that\njob, yeah.",
        "A: And in between newcomers were coming 1n, and the -- the Russian uniform were going to an\nend, and so those clotheses were -- had to be marked with red stripes. So that was quite an career,\nit started this way, and it was an coincident, everything, that I spoke German, that I approached\nher, and she --",
        "A: At the right time.",
        "A: No.\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: I beg your pardon?",
        "A: It was Aumeier.",
        "A: No. You can look him up. I think it\u2019s A-u-m-e-1-e-r.",
        "A: But you can look that up again. He was sentenced --",
        "A: Why did he what?",
        "A: Ah. You see, people who are working outdoors in the fields, or wherever, if they wear civilian\nclothes, then they could have been taken for any civilian person. If they escape, they would have\nbeen able to mingle among the civilians, and nobody would have known who they are. But being\nmarked with an special red stripe, the -- even the male -- male prisoners, who some of them, the\nofficials had no stripe th -- on upper clothing, they had the dark blue jackets, yeah, at wintertime,\nor some of them had -- yeah, dark blue jackets, they had the red stripes in the center of their\njacket, so to be recognized as an inmate. That was very, very known in the -- in the system of --\nof concentration camp inmates, the red stripe --",
        "A: They were marked with the red stripes from top -- from top to bottom, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right. If you had something which was not --",
        "A: -- striped --",
        "A: -- then it had to be marked --",
        "A: -- to be recognized as inmate.",
        "A: Sometimes the pants on the sides were marked with red stripes, yeah. And women, well we\nhad to distribute to the newcomers, civilian clothes, had to be marked so to distinguish them\nbetween civilians and -- and inmates. It was --",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: P-P-Paint which does not -- which does not dissolve in water. Some kind of oil paint with an\ndrying agent, to -- to -- to dry quick enough, yeah.",
        "A: To what?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t need to figure out, I --",
        "A: -- have been an trained painter. That was part of our training.",
        "A: They.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No. In those days they -- they were not devel -- they had not developed the colors which are\ngl -- no, we -- we have developed that glowing business very, very late.",
        "A: Yeah. Pretty late.",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hm.",
        "A: Oh, everyone who had a stripe was ready to go to work. Those who had no stripes, couldn\u2019t\ngo. The others in dozens, by the hundreds, yeah one, two, three, from top to bottom down.",
        "A: No, it happened even before the registration, the moment you received your dress. It depends.\nSometimes they had -- so they were selected for work, or for work detail, and they were standing\nthere, and I had to go from one to -- to -- from one to -- and to -- from one to the next, and do the\nwhole [indecipherable] the whole group, and then some -- and when there were no people after\nth -- after they went out to work, during the day I had -- I -- I had to do the stripes in the store,\nand prepare that for the next person who received that dress of -- as a newcomer, yeah. So, I had\nto make things in stock at the beg -- at the -- under -- in the s-stores, where those dresses were\nprepared for newcomers, that I did during the day, and -- and when -- when there were -- were\nnot enough, and we had more people to go out for work than we could paint. And supplies, oh, I\nhad to do that while standing in -- in -- before -- standing outdoors, and I had to do that on their\nbody.",
        "A: But -- yes, but --",
        "A: -- they started -- I started actually to do that in the store, in the store.",
        "A: And they would get the clothes -- clothes wi-with the stripes, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.",
        "A: It started very soon, very soon. The moment we had no more Russian uniforms to supply,\nthen the -- some of the Russians uniforms appeared again, because people were killed in the gas,\nand we received the business back, only the numbers had to be removed, because they were the\nnumbers of the dead people.",
        "A: Mm?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That, no, no.",
        "A: They were gassing in Birkenau.",
        "A: [indecipherable] house. Huh?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: See, it was --",
        "A: -- it was -- there were rumors, but we -- we had no proof. We didn\u2019t know. We had no --",
        "A: They only burned the people -- non-Jewish people who died, and then supplied the urns to\ntheir relatives, yeah. They were dead people, not gassed people.",
        "A: So that is an whole story which has to be explored, and to -- read, how they have developed\ntheir killing process in Auschwitz one, and then later in Birkenau. But all I know is that non-\nJews were gassed, too, yeah, in the beginning.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Of course, we -- we knew that they were gassed, because we received their clothes in -- back\nin the -- after the gassing, with their numbers.",
        "A: [indecipherable] just died --",
        "A: -- you see, in the beginning it was very hard to -- to control and check rus -- what really\nhappened, because there was no even interest in, or -- I mean, we had no need to distinguish one\nfrom the other. If they were non-Jews, then they have returned to earth with some dirt, so they\nare not even the ashes. But otherwise, I have -- I had very little interest in the whole business,\nbecause we have learned of the gassing pretty late, yeah. And -- then later, while in Birkenau,\nand while I had been engaged, and I received an drawing office in the camp office, and I was\nengaged to pr -- to produce some diagrams with all the movements in the camp -- in the women\u2019s\ncamp. He said I had to produce those diagrams who were then sent over to Berlin. It was only\nthen that I became more interest in the gassing process, because I had to register the daily\ngassing of women in the camp. And that, I re -- I had reported every -- every end of the month I\nreceived some daily reports of those gassings, and had to enter that on the diagram. So that\u2019s\nwhy I knew about it, and why sometimes we had to -- the people who were already pre --\nprepared us, or -- not prepared, but people who were decided o-of their killing, through gas, were\nstill alive while I already had to enter them on my diagram as -- as dead people, yeah. That\nwasn\u2019t -- that wasn\u2019t bad, the hardest part of it was between the selections in -- in -- in those\nselections, yeah, not of newcomers, but those who were living in the camp. The selections, the\ntransfer to the gas chamber, it took sometimes on whole, maybe 12 hours, but in advance, we\nalready had to register them as dead, because they were not alive any more, was in the trans-\ntransfer process. It\u2019s very hard to explain, and hard to -- to bel -- to -- to understand the --\npsychologically how hard it was on my system. Couldn\u2019t do much.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Who?",
        "A: Could you speak a little bit louder?",
        "A: Hard that you had -- that you have known the people are still alive, and they were registered\nalready, had to be registered already for the next day\u2019s dead, yeah. It -- that is hard to explain,\nyeah. Just like I would say compare with you have in front of you, people who are dying, yeah?\nYou only don\u2019t know when they are going to die, but they are in the stage of dying. You feel\nvery strange while you are still here in front of you the living body, and you know they may be\ndead tomorrow, or after tomorrow, but they are already in -- theoretically, in your mind, dead.",
        "A: That is more or less the -- the same situation.",
        "A: But did you ever have anything like that?",
        "A: Yeah? You see -- and if you have masses of people, even if you have -- didn\u2019t know them, but\nyou have an group of people by the hundreds, yeah, sometimes even healthy ones, and here they\nare, already dead on paper, and they\u2019re standing outside still on the -- on -- on th -- on the\nground, and are still alive and breathing, and -- and -- and don\u2019t know that they\u2019re going to be\ndead tomorrow, yeah. That was hard. And just -- just like with an dying person who -- whom you\nknow, and who -- where you know he is going to die, but he doesn\u2019t know, yeah? Or she doesn\u2019t\nknow.",
        "A: And it\u2019s sometimes just a question of hours. Niya, is that an comparison?",
        "A: Good.",
        "A: To what?",
        "A: Oh, you are an artist all of a sudden.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Only me, because I knew -- I knew how to -- to paint, how to mix the paint from raw material,\nyeah. That was on -- something you had to learn in -- as an professional, and not to -- like an\nhousewife who can cook. Within -- it was the difference like between an chef, and the primitive\npeasant woman, both could cook, yeah?",
        "A: But the difference how to cook, is between an chef and then -- and then any -- any housewife\ncan cook, right, or learn to cook, now --",
        "A: Yes, I was it.",
        "A: Later on --",
        "A: -- when I was entrusted with -- of the printing of the numbers --",
        "A: I trained some other people to do the stripes, but 1t was me who mixed the colors.",
        "A: The paint, yeah.",
        "A: All the time.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: I did my red stripes with water -- on a water bases, so that it would come off, in case I would\nlike to remove it. And I did it before we went on the Dead March, yeah.",
        "A: Then I got myself a new coat from the [indecipherable] yeah, on other -- on coat, on warm\ncoat, I painted the red stripe, which came off in no time, and I was prepared for any situation,\nyeah.",
        "A: The camp office?",
        "A: Which camp office? Now listen very carefully. I have here --",
        "A: Uh?",
        "A: What are you saying? Not what?",
        "A: Now wait a wi -- wait a minute. I have an dilemma.",
        "A: There is an group of people who worked, the secretaries for SS people.",
        "A: As secretaries for the Gestapo. Each Gestapo man had one woman who worked -- was his\nsecretary, whom he -- whom had to -- who was forewarned not to disclose anything what they\nare doing, otherwise they are going to be shot. It was an -- you must understand, and you will not\nunderstand, but nevertheless, Auschwitz and Birkenau had sub-camps -- so-called sub-camps.\nNow, to make you -- give you an idea, those sub-camps, in our English language they are sub-\ncamps, but there is no German word for it, yeah. The German system of the camp in Birkenau\nand Auschwitz, in the German language, in their own language, had two types of sub-camps,\nyeah. That is now hard to explain, but there is no -- again, no word for sub-camps. They were --\nif I would like -- if you would like me to translate that by the wording, I\u2019m going to give you the\nGerman name. There was one type of camp which was -- one type of sub-camps, which was\ncalled a branch camp, Zweig lager, and Zweig, Z-w-e-1-g, 1s a branch of a tree, yeah?",
        "A: For example.",
        "A: And then there was an other type of camps, of sub-camps, which were called Abschnitts\nlager, A-b-s-c-h-n-1-t-t-s, Abschnitts lager, that means -- abschnitts -- I don\u2019t know what -- what\nit means in English. It\u2019s not always wise to translate exactly, because sometimes you get some\nstupid results out of it. But lets call the other one sub-camp, yeah? Okay?",
        "A: An Abschnitts mean -- would -- I would even say section, yeah? So whatever it is, it is still an\nsub-camp.",
        "A: Only, but we don\u2019t -- but you and all other big shots don\u2019t know, is that one of those two were\nalways -- the one will belong to one -- the one group, even if they were allocated two yards from\nthe crematorium, belonged to an -- to heads of privilege -- privilege, in -- in commas, yeah?",
        "A: In quotes. Not to be exposed for gassing. As a matter of fact, they were forbidden to gas the\npeople who belonged to those camps. While those who were part of the section -- what I\u2019m\ncalling section, underwent selections and could have got -- been gassed. Now comes an example,\nokay?",
        "A: Let\u2019s go to the women\u2019s camp.",
        "A: Harmense, Boody, Ricekoff, Shtopskaboida, B-Beetoogee, were all privileged branch camps.\nThere\u2019s no history in the Auschwitz -- there\u2019s no -- no example in the whole Auschwitz women\u2019s\ncamp history, that there was ever a selection in those sub-camps, which I am calling an branch --\nbranch camp. Never, there was never in the whole history, an selection in Ricekoff, or in\nHarmense, or in Boody, or in the Shtopskiboidi, or --",
        "A: In Beetoogee. That is the [indecipherable] camp, which was next, between crematorium five\nand four. Good. While the other branch, or the other category of s -- of what am I calling --",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: What?",
        "A: What? Ah --",
        "A: -- while the other category, what am I calling that?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Could be gassed, there were selections going on. For example, to that group belonged the\nsealava, yeah, b-b-b-B1C, B2B -- B -- B1 -- B2B, that was a Czech camp, was a Gypsy camp.\nThe C lagers of Czech camps, the Gypsy camp, both camps -- both parts of the women\u2019s camp,\nB1A and B1B, but they were -- that was a -- no, that was -- forget about BIA and B1B, that was\nthe main women\u2019s camp, and all others belonged to us, to BIA, and B1B, up to the women\u2019s\ncamp. So, I\u2019m giving you here a small example why -- yeah, and they were all administered by\nthe women\u2019s camp -- camp office.",
        "A: Everything, both sections, and had to report every day to the roll call -- for the roll call, to our\ncamp office. We were the leading administrative entity --",
        "A: -- for the women\u2019s camp. It was not the Shtopskaboidas --",
        "A: -- they were an bloody, unimportant, but Laura Shelly brought an -- was giving the\nimpression if they would have been headquarters of everything. They were the SS headquarters,\nyeah. And they -- there was no cola -- col -- cooperation or camaraderie among those SS\nsecretaries, whatsoever. I have no idea how to explain that to the Whitman girl. He\nmisunderstood the whole -- she had -- she was, what you are calling in German, spinning, yeah.\nNow, is that clear, what I explained to you?",
        "A: Is that new? Is that new?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: I never said it to you before.",
        "A: Of course I'd not.",
        "A: How else could I have said to you during all those years? But I hope that you understand now,\nbetter than you would have understood 10 years ago.",
        "A: Don\u2019t ask me.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. You couldn\u2019t ask any -- that -- you couldn\u2019t ask the system somewhere in\nBerlin why.",
        "A: It was actually so -- we were so sure that we helped our ca -- our friends to be transferred to\nthose camps.",
        "A: Yeah. You were two yards away from crematorium five, and were not all -- and were not\ngassed. Where people had to come from Holland, and from France, and I don\u2019t know -- know\nwhere from, to -- to be gassed in that crematorium, while the camp around --",
        "A: -- two yards only, had never one case of selection, yeah. And we knew it, but very few in the\ncamp office, maybe it was me and Katya, who knew what the real -- and that why we could help.\nThat why we were transferring friends constantly to those parts of -- of the camp where we knew\nthey will never be exposed to the selection. Okay?",
        "A: Now, anything to say?",
        "A: Mm-hm. Is that -- that 1s now -- are you surprised what I told you, no?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: No. No, because [indecipherable] so few, that you did -- had no -- that means they didn\u2019t\nknow who -- who was who, if you have an -- that -- what would mean to the SS? The\nheadquarter SS, they can -- they had nothing to do with it.",
        "A: No, it\u2019s just --",
        "A: The whole system didn\u2019t -- the whole system didn\u2019t make any sense. But I\u2019m telling you now\nsomething which was the real -- the real issue, it -- that was it.",
        "A: From the beginning.",
        "A: No, we -- we -- we knew -- Katya was close to the top SS woman, o-or man who were in\ncharge. What are you looking for?",
        "A: Yeah. No, we knew it. I don\u2019t -- I knew it. I didn\u2019t even investigated why I know it, where\nfrom. I knew it. So --",
        "A: Look, I give you an example. In \u201943, we were tr -- always trying from the beginning, once I\ngot into the -- into the -- with the position of the camp office, how I got into the pen -- office is\nanother story.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: But, once I\u2019ve been in, and I have noticed that there are no selections going on over there,\nyeah, in those camps -- in those part of the camp, we have started [indecipherable] I was running\nto Katya, Katya, I need a job, let -- let\u2019s transfer her, let\u2019s do that. So we did it. We have\ntransferred the people to safeguard them, and to save them, yeah, into those comma -- into those\nwork details. And only once in my lifetime, for which I\u2019m even today very unhappy, 1s that very\ngood friends of mine, in the beginning, when everything was still very bad, and the new art\n[indecipherable] work detail in -- of those branch camps were established, and among them, one\nwas called Boody, and I have helped an lot of girls to go to Boody, because we knew it 1s one of\nthe branch camps, and there were never selections in Boody. Unfortunately, some of the German\nkapos started to massacre the Jewish girls. But that had nothing to do with the system, yeah. And\nthere were -- I still have sometimes sleepless nights, because my best friends wouldn\u2019t be helped,\nyeah. They got killed. So what can I tell you? But that\u2019s the only place where they died -- the\nonly time they died prematurely, and they were not killed by the SS. They were killed by\nGerman inmates who were in charge there, as kapos, and so on. You know the story of Boody.\nBut otherwise, you show me one camp -- sub-camp, where there were selections of those I have\nmentioned to you. Never.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: They knew they in a good --",
        "A: -- they\u2019re in a good place.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: They knew, very much so. They are all alive, they all survived. I [indecipherable] my\nproblems, you know the -- the Whit-Whitman girl, yeah. She made a job out of her paper, and\ntelling about the camaraderie, and the solidarity, and I don\u2019t know what nonsense about that\ngroup of people, and they were the -- they -- they are all alive, you can ask one by one, if she\never had a friend among them. They were afraid of each other.",
        "A: No, in -- no, in the Shtopskaboida, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. And ask her about the camaraderie, ask her. She\u2019 lI laugh into your face.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: It -- we already had an camp office in Auschwitz one.",
        "A: And there were some women from Ravensbruck, who were engaged in the starting of the\nsystem, yeah, who keeps the Haupt book. There was an -- in each camp they had an ha --\nprinciple book, a big one.",
        "A: Haupt, yeah, was principle book that was in every camp, so they had to enter that by day and\nby number, by professions. Whole story on one -- one big book, like that. They kept that, then\nthey had already mainly they engaged th -- the -- 1-1t was an very, very wishy-washy system, and\nwhen we relocated to Birkenau, there was an German woman still in charge, but in October\n[indecipherable] September, end of September, she was replaced, and obasarin Drexler, who --",
        "A: Drexler. No drek --",
        "A: They calling her Drexler, yeah.",
        "A: Drexel.",
        "A: Yeah, Drexel, no Drexler.",
        "A: Uh-huh. As she became the rapport fuhrering, so that was an rank, in charge of the roll calls,\nyeah.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Drexel, in charge. And this charged the -- all other women, they were -- they were engaged,\nand got herself Katya, to become the rapport shabering. That means, you had an rapport fuhrer,\nor fuhrering to lead that, that was always an SS woman, or an SS man, and you had the inmate\nwho was then the one who did the job.",
        "A: And I have been, during those couple of weeks in September, hospitalized, because I had\ntyphus, and all kinds of junk in my body. I was very sick. And the whole block was selected, just\nready to be gassed. And I have been taken out as the only one from the whole selection of I don\u2019t\nknow how many thousand, on that particular day, and transferred to the camp office. What is it?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: They transferred me immediately to the camp office.",
        "A: The Drexler, and Katya was standing there. Yeah, who took me out? The camp leader,\nbecause his secretary was an friend of mine, and when she saw me there on that big heap of\npeople to be -- just to be taken on the truck, she was running to him, and asking if he would help\nme. Because a couple of weeks before, I used to paint some numbers in his office, on the\nwardrobes for the individual SS men.",
        "A: But I haven\u2019t finished, because I -- I had to -- I was transferred to the hospital, and she was an\n-- an -",
        "A: Yeah. She -- she was -- she had an yellow and purple star, because she had an Jewish lover.\nSo --",
        "A: And he was Mueller.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Ha -- I think -- no, I must look him up.",
        "A: He only was two months there, two months in the camp.",
        "A: He\u2019s a very -- very seldom that he is mentioned in any literature, but I --",
        "A: Because he knew me.",
        "A: And she -- he took -- he asked Shtevitz, was another famous SS man, to come over, and to\ncheck if I am capable to carry on with the work. And so he asked me several things to do, up and\ndown the bed, and jumping over the -- what is it?",
        "A: Ditches, yeah.",
        "A: Little he knew that I was an very sporty type, and that I was used to go up and down the\nladder, yeah. For me, all that, even as sick as I\u2019ve been, was no big deal, yeah. So I passed\neverything he wanted me to do.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: I was very sick.",
        "A: There comes the man who was in charge of the selection, and of the whole business then, on\nthat day, that was that Heinrich Schwartz, another SS man, an ugly one. And so when Stevitz\ntold him that this Mueller want me to -- out, he said, okay, only if I have no fever. So go to the --\nthey commanded me to go over to the hospital station, and there they had to measure my fever,\nmy temperature. Now, I nearly collapsed, but they told me not to worry, because even if I have\nfever, they won\u2019t tell. They took me int -- so they were selecting the people, the whole barracks,\ncomplete, even the blockelteste went. And -- no I don\u2019t think some of the blockelteste -- no, they\n-- no, they left the blockelteste behind. But what happened 1s that -- that Schwartz wacom -- was\ncoming every five minute. Has she fever, or hasn't she? He was so concerned about one person,\nyeah. And they constantly said, she is not ready yet, not ready. They were pumping in me some\nmedication, Bydrian, I remember that, and Anna Weiss was the physician.",
        "A: All -- Olly was there, Gerda Sneider, the whole hospital hierarchy, they just assured me they\nwill not say that I have fever. And finally, when -- when he returned, and everybody was already\ngone, so he was just waiting for me, so when they ask him -- when he asked if I have fever, they\nsaid no, okay? And there was an SS man, who witnessed the whole business inside the hospital\ncompound. And he was coming then, and brought me pen, and a piece of paper, and said sit\ndown and do some drawing, start to work. So I s -- I was totally deaf, and blind, and I couldn\u2019t\nremember the letters, how they looked. I was tot -- look, I was out of the world, with high fever.\nSo I said, \u201cBut I don\u2019t know how the letter looks.\u201d He said, \u201cDo whatever you want.\u201d You know,\nif I would have today be able to keep that, what I draw, it would have been a wonderful analysis\nfor some of those psychiatrists, yeah. The results of my -- the condition, and the results of my\nwhole situation, and what I did. In any case, the moment all everything was gone, I had my --\nyeah, and the SS man said to me, \u201cLook, do anything you want, but just work.\u201d So okay, I did --\nI don\u2019t know what I did, but after awhile the door opens, in comes Katya, and [indecipherable]\nand Drexel, with an sheet of paper in the hand to transfer into the camp office. And that was the\nbeginning of my career. Two months later, Mandel arrived as an oboffsairen, yeah, in charge of\nthe whole camp, and Mandel cat -- was really -- respected me from the first day on, and made\nmy life very tolerable. Her boyfriend was in charge of the bowlightung of the camp -- building\noffice, yeah. And he established me my drawing office. He supplied me with wonderful\ninstruments, and material, and --",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: I was the one who was [indecipherable] it\u2019s the only one, and she didn\u2019t know why. The only\none from the whole thousands and thousand of people, yeah. And she couldn\u2019t -- she didn\u2019t know\nwhy.",
        "A: She didn\u2019t know why. But they --",
        "A: She was an very beautiful woman. I wouldn\u2019t say she was cruel, no. But she didn\u2019t like the\nprostitutes, the German prostitutes. She didn\u2019t liked -- she liked -- I don\u2019t know what she liked. I\ndon\u2019t know why she liked me.",
        "A: I will never forget -- yeah, I helped to organize the orchestra too, during -- under her -- under\nher time. When she noticed that I\u2019m artist by profession, that I\u2019m a musician, so she -- she -- and\nI spoke good German, and so once she called me and asked me to put an dedication in an book.\nSo th -- I noticed she made another SS man an birthday present, but normally, I don\u2019t know what\npeople are -- what the SS was giving each other. She made him a present of books. So I was\nstarting to think, yeah, that was one quality which I never expected, yeah. And asking me to put\nan dedication in. And on that day, I noticed -- I said, but [indecipherable] that 1s my birthday too,\nyeah, on the same day. So she said, \u201cOh, so go [indecipherable] you have an sheet of paper, go to\nthe package room, and get yourself the biggest parcel they have.\u201d Yeah. And do you know who\nwas in charge then, already, in the package room? That SS woman who --",
        "A: Who so she started to respect me.",
        "A: Ugly. Oy, was she ugly. And she want -- she ask me -- Katya is standing there, and I was\ncoming, and walking, and she called me back. You\u2019re short -- your dresses are too short. I want\nto see you tomorrow with I don\u2019t know how many inches longer, and wanted to hit me. And I\nwas running away. I don\u2019t know what happened to -- she could have shot me, yeah. And Katya\nc-comes later on and said, \u201cSippy, you know she -- she complained that Sippy\u2019s\n[indecipherable].\u201d She was running away from me, and I wanted to hit her. So, I don\u2019t know\nwhat Drexel was. She was -- I noticed that she did selections, she participated in selections,\nwhile Mandel did not. But Mandel once signed an sheet of selected paper, and because of that\nshe was hanged. So.",
        "A: Look, it was an very hard -- well, it was very hard to understand, what really went on in the\nmind of the -- that Mandel woman, that she had, as an partner, an h-high official, and an trained -\n- an engineer -- an engineer by profession, or an architect. And she -- as I had mentioned to you,\nthat was an sign of -- on bit of an higher level -- mentally higher level than all others, while\ngiving another SS man a book as an present, yeah, for a birthday. But would -- how would you\nhave judged that? That they were thinking different.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: She was from Austria, but with her, I had good luck. In -- at the end of \u201944, there was an\nfriend. The Germans wanted to establish the biggest women\u2019s concentration camp in the world,\nin -- not too far from Dachau, yeah, in Kaufering. And we have heard about it, and Mandel\nshould have become the biggest shot -- big shot of the biggest concentration camp on earth. So\nsh-she selected some of the Auschwitz people which she wanted to take along with her, and\nnobody from the camp office, and nobody knew what\u2019s going to happen, whom she\u2019s going to\ntake. It would have been an advantage, because there would have been no crematorium, yeah. So\nthey prepared a list whom she selected in the camp office. We had one typewriter, and one\nwoman typed the list. So I wanted to know if I am on the list, because it was, after all, an big\nevent to leave Auschwitz, and join the staff of the biggest SS woman in the world. And -- but the\nwoman who produced the list was mean, and didn\u2019t wanted to tell us. So, what am I doing, the\nlist was prepared, and it went to Berlin. And while she was carrying the list to deliver the list, I\nwent into the wastepaper basket, and there were some carbon paper. So I\u2019ve been on the list.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Katya was already gone, because she had an affair with an SS man, and was -- disappeared\nfrom the earth of -- from the face of the earth. Katya was stupid, because I didn\u2019t know that she\nhad the affair. He was coming there to the office to visit, every day. And I went over to Katya,\nand I said, \u201cKatya, who is he? Who is he?\u201d What is -- no, I did-didn\u2019t said who is he. \u201cKatya,\nwhat is he doing here?\u201d She said, \u201cHe\u2019s coming to visit me.\u201d Her. I said, \u201cKatya, that\u2019s an mass\nmurderer.\u201d She looked at me. I noticed him shu -- sh -- killing the people at the black wall, from\nI visited while still in Auschwitz, I went from block nine to block 10. There are still today the\nwooden -- wooden timbers, yeah. But in between the timbers you could look. And I have\nwitnessed the execution of hundreds and hundreds of people, which he performed. And I said to\nher, \u201cKatya, that\u2019s a mass murderer.\u201d She never said anything to me. Our relationship went --\nslowly cooled off, yeah, because of that. And then she was arrested, put into the bunker, and was\nsent away, and he was sent to the front. So nothing really happened between the two of -- he was\nkilled, and she was stupid enough to risk her good life she had. She had an important -- she had\nan important life to car -- to -- to lead in Auschwitz. She could help, she could do a lot of things.\nAnd all for an SS man who was really a mass murderer. But I\u2019m glad that I told her that in my\nlifetime. I was honest enough to forewarn her, yeah.",
        "A: She died.",
        "A: No, she -- she was sent away, but she survived. We have met after the war.",
        "A: She visited me, I visited her in \u201975 in Prague, but she died of an -- of an kidney failure.",
        "A: Oh, every second that I have -- I have on record -- not a record, a tape.",
        "A: Ihave sent Susan --",
        "A: -- over to visit her, and she didn\u2019t wanted to speak to anybody, but when I told her that I\u2019m\nsending somebody and she remembers Susan a little bit. So, this Susan was stupid. Instead to\nletting her talk --",
        "A: -- Susan was talking all the time. Not -- of -- in any case, that\u2019s the story of my -- my entrance\nto the camp office, and it was relatively an important job, and we could do a lot, yeah, and we\nwere helping a lot.",
        "A: Mandel.",
        "A: She knew what I could do, and her lover was an architect, in charge of the architectural office,\nof whole Auschwitz, yeah. I had equipment and material, and whatever I want. I had a good life\nin that drawing office. It was an independent, no competition. Nobody was giving me the order\nexcept she, yeah.",
        "A: Katya yes, but they --",
        "A: -- knew what I\u2019m doing, and [indecipherable], as sometimes SS women were coming with a\nlittle of work, yeah. And -- but it became too much, yeah. I tried to s -- to satisfy everybody, but\nthen it became too much, and I complained to Mandel, said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\nEverybody\u2019s coming, and wants some little work, and I cannot fulfill, I cannot do everything.\u201d\nShe said, \u201cOkay,\u201d said, \u201cif anybody comes in future, just tell her or him to see me first.\u201d That\nwas the end, yeah.",
        "A: I could talk to her, that was funny, yeah.",
        "A: And she was the one, when she was arrested, she was Catholic, one of the Polish woman --\nand I'll show you on some photograph. She is in that book too, \u201cFighting Auschwitz.\u201d One of\nthat woman was arrested after the war by the Polish Communists, and sentenced to death because\nof her anti-government feeling. And they put her together with Mandel in one cell. So, they had\nenough time to exchange their views and so on. And then Mandel one day ask her -- even what\u2019s\nhis name, Lankban describes the whole affair in his book, too. One day, Mandel ask her if she\nwould forgive her. So both were Catholics. She said, \u201cLook, why are you asking me? I forgive\nyou, but He upstairs, it\u2019s up to Him.\u201d So that was authentic, and she told me the story, too.\nRachwalova was her name. Mandel ask her to forgive her.",
        "A: Rachwalova.",
        "A: Rachwalova.",
        "A: R-a-c-h-w-a-l-o-v-a. I forgot her f-f -- her first name, my God. I have a photo here with her,\nwe have met after the war. And it\u2019s in fighting for -- \u201cFighting Auschwitz.\u201d She\u2019s in the\nliterature at Forenzia.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: But they just said louder --",

        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Katya was there on blockelteste.",

        "A: I come out of the selection.",
        "A: I\u2019m helping to establish the -- the camp office --",
        "A: -- by designing the card -- cardex for different purposes. We had an cardex system for the\nliving, an cardex system for the dead, an cardex system for the -- for the work details. Then there\nwere many functions in that -- in the camp office, like again, the principle bookkeeping. People\nwere engaged by collecting daily dartas of nationalities so that they could supply me for my\ndiagram, and for the statistics which I had to -- of whi-- of which I have been engaged on an\ndaily basis. There were many functions and many employees in that office, but I could start -- I\nmean, we had to -- I established the individual barrack books which each blockelteste -- I think\nMrs. -- what\u2019s her name? S -- Sheila Romiano [indecipherable]. Well, you interviewed Palarchik.",
        "A: She made an enormous mistake when she said they were keeping a book for nationalities, a\nbook for professionals, a book for -- by number, and a book by names. Now, as I have been in\ncharge of putting the columns, and making the columns in those books, because they were blank\nsheets in the book, I don\u2019t remember ever to have supplied four books to each barrack.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: It was one book, where we had the columns, yeah. Now -- and because of that, I engage\nsometimes, people to help, and to draw those columns, and to mark the different columns. Peop -\n- mainly people who were discharged from hospital and needed time to recuperate, and then time\nto be transferred to a m -- kind of an good job. So that -- there were so many people who went\nthrough that drawing office, just in the stage of recup -- of re -- to recuperate, yeah. So it was\nquite -- very satisfying. Among others, what\u2019s her name, Susan was working there with us, too,\nwhile she was just out of hospital. That how we met, actually, in Birkenau. Okay? Now you\nknow, Susan Chernakshpatz.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Horrible. To -- her handwriting is now the one of an real old person. Have any of you noticed\nthat?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: She was just drawing lines.",
        "A: Yeah. No, I wouldn\u2019t let -- no, who learned very nicely, and who did quite an good job, was\nMagba Helinger.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Ah, you mean --",
        "A: Ah, you want to have an -- an o-organizational chart?",
        "A: But Mandel, and -- you see it\u2019s -- those jobs have changed, and sometimes people were on the\nsame level.",
        "A: Well anyhow, what would you like to know? You have on top, in the camp, always the\noberhafsierens.",
        "A: The top -- top SS person, where they had positions and rank, so you must always use both.\nWith SS man is the same. If somebody was an -- an rapport fuhrer, that was his position, but his\nrank was an military one, yeah. So that is always to be taken in account, too.",
        "A: His rank. The military rank.",
        "A: She was no soldier.",
        "A: She was ober -- amongst the women, the personnel, there were only -- they only had one title.",
        "A: She was oberhavsiehiden.",
        "A: Once -- she was, among others, oberhafsieren too, but before that, she was rapport fuhrering.",
        "A: There was a time when they were on the same level, yeah. There were times when they were\non the same level.",
        "A: What? Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, but she was before -- she -- she was Langerfelt.",
        "A: Yeah. Actually died in between.",
        "A: Yeah. She was a good woman.",

        "A: Who described her?",
        "A: Yeah, but who described her, any specific person?",
        "A: No, she was not.",
        "A: But it depends on -- wait a minute.",
        "A: You see, you must realize that there were times that that -- the picture has changed constantly,\nyeah?",
        "A: Picture has changed, and I\u2019d -- could -- while Mandel was oberhafsieren be-between then and\nthen, yeah, you must realize that --",
        "A: -- you have to bring those people how -- how the camp has developed, and that you will find -\n- | would not make now, or waste my time or yours, but they are working in Auschwitz now with\na researching the development of the women\u2019s camp, and they will have the datas much -- very\nwell defined, very soon.",
        "A: Then we can use that. Then we\u2019ll be able to use that.",
        "A: Partially, yeah.",
        "A: Ah, the ranutachek is not very reliable, because she can only report on things which are f --",
        "A: What -- reported to her, or what people have -- testimonies, and testimonies are sometimes so\nbad, I -- I\u2019m have certain testimonies from Auschwitz that I would never use, yeah. Brrr, what\nelse?",
        "A: Al-All in -- all in one -- in one -- we had one barrack, and that was block four.",
        "A: B -- B2 -- BIB in block four.",
        "A: Most of the time. In the beginning, in Birkenau, it was in the -- in BIA. BIA on barrack I\nthink 12, I have to check that, because from there I have been hospitalized, and there I had\ntyphus, and there I lost my mind. But the real camp office, in function, was after our relocation\nfrom BIA to B1B, and established in the -- in block four, where half of the block wa -- the camp\nwa -- were offices, and the other half were quarters.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And in the front, where all the offices were, all the offices, the work detail office, and the ca-\ncamp office, and the drawing office.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Huh?",

        "A: Ah yeah, [indecipherable] no, no --",
        "A: Deenst yeah, but the arbides deenst had only one -- one f-female employee, and she had her\noffice outside where the SS blockfuhresterwer was. No, they -- they were combined. The block --\nit was the arbides einsatz who had many, many employees, and who had an cardex system.

        "A: -- by -- by demand of --",
        "A: -- qualifications, were the work detail office. They had to collect constantly the people from\ndifferent barracks, because they knew where they are, we had the cardex system established.",
        "A: The service -- service.",
        "A: They made available the amount by asking the work detail office t-to get the people, yeah.",
        "A: Arbides einsatz.",
        "A: And the arbides deenst, I would not even mention, because that was not a function, it was\nonly one person who had many, many things -- was numerous and coordinator between the\nemployer and the employee.",
        "A: Oy.",
        "A: Look, it\u2019s -- with ma -- me it\u2019s hard, because you v -- I -- to translate from German into\nEnglish, it doesn\u2019t make sometimes sense.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Arbides einsatz.",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: Work detail.",
        "A: One person. And actually, the li -- liaison between employer, and -- and employees. That\nmeans the companies or individuals who requested the service, went through the one person.",
        "A: Work service, they say --",
        "A: So the work service went to the arbides einsatz, and said select al -- your specialists of your\npeople who can do or perform the job, yeah. Because she had no -- you see, the work service had\nthe request for 50 people who can do road work, okay?",
        "A: She went to the work detail office.",
        "A: And ask, get me 50 people. The work detail office went to the individual barracks, because\nthey had in their cardex the road workers, good road workers. Where are they? They\u2019re there, in\nthere. And had contact -- made contact with the blockelteste, and ask them to send so and so, and\nso and so, and so and so next morning, until they had the 50 together.",
        "A: But the work service did other things, too, which is not really defined. She made all kinds of\njobs, she made all kinds of other things, yeah. After all, you had to do a job for -- for hundred\nand thousand of inmates to -- to administer on every possible level, like food and -- and clothing,\nand -- and in -- it was -- it\u2019s co -- a complicated business --",
        "A: -- but if 1t comes -- now, let\u2019s forget about the logistic, let\u2019s do the work of -- of how to\nsupply the work force to the employers, yeah, who are requested. [indecipherable] requested.",
        "A: They request.",
        "A: Ah, no, it could have happened that they went to the work -- they went to the head -- work\nservice got the order, yeah, 10 people tomorrow morning, in from dobseldor.",
        "A: She made sure that the right people were selected out of the cardex, and out of the availability\nof surplus.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Correct, correct.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: No, she -- she will go and ask for 10 tailors.",
        "A: When do you need them? Tomorrow morning. They went to the different barracks --",
        "A: -- selected -- got the 10 tailors, according to their cardex and names and numbers, and have\nasked the blockelteste to bring those 10 tailors tomorrow morning in front of the camp office, or\nwherever [indecipherable]",
        "A: Wait a minute, then --",
        "A: -- the 10 people, marching out the door to their destiny, which they received by the work\nservice person, yeah. The work detail did only the administrative job. The work service\nphysically delivered the people.",
        "A: Yeah. And [indecipherable] door, and --",
        "A: Correct. Because she requested it, and she got it, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Of course, they had to go through our cardex, and either to transfer the people to other\nbarracks, to other places, to other sub-camps, yeah.",
        "A: They had to be delivered to the -- to the -- they had to be made available to the people who re-\nrequested the services, yeah. Now, that could have been on transfer to another camp, or just to be\navailable every morning, through the blockelteste, make her responsible that those people will be\nready every morning, until they are going to can -- be cancelled, or until they die. And that was\none of the responsibilities of some blockelteste too, that if they had to be -- if they were selected\nfor an particular job, an -- or an -- a steady job, to be there, yeah. Once they have been told to\nsupply those 10 people every day, they had to stick to the request. There was a b -- v -- from the\nmoment a blockelteste was involved with Katya, our office was involved, too.",
        "A: It\u2019s very hard to -- it was -- those situations have changed constantly. But the -- it 1s true that -\n- but if you were an real professional, and there were certain work details -- constant work\ndetails, that -- that the -- that was an routine -- 1t became routine, yeah. Of certain work details\nhad an certain number, yeah. So they were registered as a work detail under that -- in that\nnumber. 10 people, and sometimes only eight could come, because two were sick, so she had to\nengage again two more.",
        "A: Through the same process, yeah.",
        "A: Look, it was not simple.",
        "A: Yeah. It was not simple, and each -- really, it\u2019s hard to believe that in an group of so many\npeople with different situations, and different backgrounds, that we had manage -- that we have\nmanaged to bring law and order into the place. And there were times then, that we have managed\nto -- to supply everybody with his ration. Those times were gone that we were coming home\nfrom an outdoor work and the blockelteste told you, \u201cWe have no more food for you.\u201d Yeah.\nThat never occurred under Katya. Rations were supplied, we had -- or they arranged special\nrations. Katya really made what she could in the time of counting the work -- the -- time of\ncounting the -- during the roll call time was cut down to an s -- minimum amount of time, yeah,\nand that meant more relaxation, more sleep.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Yeah, that is all what I\u2019m trying to say, that it was not so simple how people think, and to\nmanage an -- and t-to manage the food distribution, the clothing distribution, the bedding, you\nname it, all s -- s -- clothing ides, including shoes. That is -- was not -- was -- became always,\nduring those years or th-those months, improved, improved enormously, yeah. Then we had\nenormous [indecipherable] blacks of Hungarian Jews in the four -- middle of \u201944, and so on. That\nwas an big problem, yeah, but as they were sep -- as those newcomers there, there was a lot of\nmovement. Newcomers were coming, and old-comers were sent on transport, because they were\nrequested in factories in Germany. A lot of people had been requested, but also a lot of\nmovement, and we had to account for each person, and the roll calls again became more\ncomplicated, but the system improved by sticking to it well, and -- and selecting more intelligent\nblockelteste, and block administrators, so 1t was always the tendency of improvement, and of\n[indecipherable] re -- raising the standard of living [indecipherable |",
        "A: Right. We had to carry on.",
        "A: And we did not believe for one moment to give up, yeah. Never. That was an ama -- that I\nhave learned to survive. Even now, I can be half dead, and if I have a -- an job to do, \u2019'm doing\nit. But we -- we were carrying on, not knowing if you are going to live tomorrow, yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: We had to di -- we had to control the punishment detail. We had to control the supply of not\nonly -- it was not enough to ask for people, and to supply the people for work, but it was an\nquestion of, as I said, food rations, clothing, bedding, hygiene, cleaning of the barracks, cleaning\nof each bed, a -- delousing, de -- and we had to -- we had to work very closely with the work\ndetail people. The work service had very little to do with the rest of those functions. They only\nhave supplied upon the request, those people they have -- that was an request for people, and\nthey had to supply, and nobody could care less how we did it, yeah.",
        "A: Or how they did it.",
        "A: Canada is an work detail, had -- the camp office -- not the camp office.",
        "A: Or the work detail office, had any influence on any -- on any work detail.",
        "A: Wait a minute. Canada was one of many.",
        "A: Are you talking about the Canada camp?",
        "A: Camp, or the work detail?",
        "A: Work detail. One work detail m-more or less. Why Canada? Why have you selected Canada?",
        "A: Th -- nothing special, they were just another work detail. They had their -- now, in those\ndifferent work details, you had an structure. You had the oberkapo, under -- underkapo, for-\nforemen, and all kinds of functions. So Canada was just one of a work -- but just one among\nmany work details.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: Now, can you imagine that you have s -- hundreds of barracks, correct?",
        "A: You have, first of all, the camp office had to administer all sub-camps, and branch camps,\nyeah. We\u2019re that start.",
        "A: So ther --",
        "A: Yeah.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: Now, let\u2019s start with the main procedure. The very most important function in all\nconcentration camps, were the daily roll call. Once or twice. Now, to have individual branch\ncamps, individual sub-camps, or what -- service camps, or whatever I am calling that, had to be\nroll called every day, okay?",
        "A: To do that, you had to report every day, once or twice, and every day once or twice, hours and\nhours were spent on the roll call. Now, if the come -- if the people were, during the roll call time,\nin the camp, or working outdoors, or working outside, it made no difference. The amount of the\npeople had to coincide with the estimated amount which was set every day. We had -- that was\nan very complicated and important, quote unquote, thing. Only [indecipherable] to be busy, or to\nbe engaged was already a -- a -- a big job, the roll call. Hours and hours [indecipherable] you had\nto prepare the food intake and distribution, which -- I mean, the distribution was done by the\nindividual blockelteste, but you had to order it, you had to request it, every day. How could you\ndo that? According to the roll call. The roll call -- you had -- for the roll call incoming transports,\noutgoing transports, transfers from hospital, to the -- to the camp, from the camp to the hospital.\nThe dying, the corpse, the gassing. It was an constant report on check control and check control,\nyeah. You had only the relationship between the hospital compound, and the releases, and the\nrequests for transfers from the camp to the hospital, from the hospital to the camp. There were\nfunctions which involved with the cardex system. People were dying, out of the living cardex,\ninto the dead cardex. There were reports to be written daily, on certain thing which they\nrequested by headquarters. I had -- I myself had an lot of work to do, which I cannot explain\nright now. You had the interaction between the work detail office, and the camp office, due to\nthose movements, they are already an full time job, yeah. And it had to be exact, and n -- we\ncouldn\u2019t -- you could not afford to have one person mislaid or misplaced, yeah. So that was an\nvery, very ups -- painstaking, or how do you call that? Painstaking?",
        "A: Event, and we were always concerned about one thing. God forbid some -- the figures don\u2019t\ncoincide. That means the whole night to stand until the figures -- until the -- the figures are right.",
        "A: So that was not our fault, it -- the SS, the idiotic system, to build the whole, everything on that\nroll call business was taking -- was keeping us busy for hours and hours and hours, daily. What\ncan I tell you?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Wait a minute. I don\u2019t understand your question. Why do I se --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: Because we improved that.",
        "A: Because they have no memory, and they cannot distinguish the time -- span of time. But we\nhad our -- our stopwatch, yeah.",
        "A: And we were counting [indecipherable] working with a stopwatch, to -- to eliminate, and to\nimprove the roll call.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: By being more efficient, by -- by preparing the roll calls in an -- with an special system of --\nof pre -- pre-roll call -- pre-roll call report.",
        "A: You -- we knew at evening, preparing the whole business that in the morning, barrack so and\nso, after the transfers were made from the barrack to the hospital compound, and from the\nbarrack to an transport waiting at the railway station, and from that barrack on transfer to I don\u2019t\nknow where, and the same barrack receiving so and so many from the hospital, and receiving so\nand so many newcomers, must be 24, yeah? And in the morning, those 24 report -- were reported\nby preparing that the whole evening, yeah. So we have, before the roll call in the morning, every\n-- it was an system we established, every block administrator reported an hour earlier, we will\nhave 24 people on our barrack, yeah?",
        "A: So when the roll call people were coming to count, they knew there must be 24. They were\nnot counting how many were there, but there had to be 24. That -- we have called that an\nforappelle. [indecipherable] the appelle, yeah.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: What report?",
        "A: The pre-report, they were very find what the pre-report said.",
        "A: And there was nobody missing. Couldn\u2019t.",
        "A: So that already had eliminated the unnecessary forward and backwards, and shifting and\nrunning, and -- and guessing, yeah. We had everything prepared every evening. It was an full\ntime job of an whole staff.",
        "A: Including the -- the -- it\u2019s so people don\u2019t have the slightest idea what went on.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Th-They didn\u2019t know what they are doing.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Correct. And if that was Katya who introduced all the whole system, we once went on with an\nstopwatch, and discovered that the highlights of one counting, took only three minutes. You\nknow how many lives they save? How many people could relax instead to suffer in the snow, in\nthe heat? Now whatever the survivors are telling you, they have no idea. I\u2019m telling you, they\nhave no idea, our researchers have no idea. As I said, Yergen never entered an German\nconcentration camp. Is he an expert now on concentration camp? Had -- what\u2019s her name, of the\nwoman Nerhamatek writes books now on concentration camp, has no ideas what\u2019s an\nconcentration camp 1s. So you cannot always rely on the which -- on -- on the so-called experts,\nyeah.",
        "A: You have to go deeper, and ask them to -- to look in -- to do what you are doing right now.\nIt\u2019s not easy to work with you. It\u2019s not easy to answer your questions, don\u2019t you think so?",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "A: But I don\u2019t know if -- if you understand what I am saying.",
        "A: Good.",
        "A: They were glad to go home, to be able to go home, yeah. There was less beating, and less --\nless -- less of everything, yeah.",
        "A: How?",
        "A: Okay, but it was not always, yeah? They couldn\u2019t afford to do that always, because eventually\nthey got tired of it, yeah. And the people [indecipherable] they created that was just for awhile,\nwhile they were newcomers, and they were new -- numerologists, yeah?",

        "A: Yeah. After awhile I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m going to make an -- with a pencil, an plan on the desk --\ntop of the table, to put in those blocks, how they are located, with everything in the scale from\none two. So I measured out the whole camp, and everything, and made myself a line drawing\nwith pencil, on the top of the desk, and put the number of the block in. So when an SS man was\ncoming, and asking where 1s the block, I told him I could show him immediately where it is. So\nwhen I noticed it worked so nicely, I had the plan flat on my desk, I said I\u2019m going to build the\nbarracks, and in colors exactly, and I\u2019m going to make an little model, without asking anybody.\nThe material I had, and when I started, and Mandel once visited, and thought what I\u2019m -- and\nsaw what I am doing, she said [indecipherable] and Hessler was there. \u201cCarry on, you can do\nanything, you can measure out whatever you want. But, don\u2019t include the crematorium. You can\nput anything on, but no crematorium.\u201d Okay. So I engaged in little -- Hans [indecipherable] was\nan architectural student in Poland, or in France, and we are started to build that nice little model.\nIt was so nice we made [indecipherable] barbed wire, everything was on. So -- soil, glued -- put\nthe glue on, and sprinkled sand on so it stuck. I made an professional model, okay, out of the\ncamp. Now, then I had an friend who was one of the Polish underground workers. He was an\nelectrician, and him I engaged to put me in front of the entrance an little barb, electric barb like\nan -- like an -- what we had over there, and underneath I had the battery, and so when you\ntouched the two things, the camp was illuminated, yeah. Was an good model, very professional.\nThen, one nice day they were -- put me on an glass top on that, and were taking it out to the\ncommandant, Hesse, into his office. That was the end of it. Do you know it\u2019s possible that it is\nstill standing somewhere.",

        "A: No.",
        "A: Who?",
        "A: Who, we? Of the inmates?",
        "A: Ihave no idea what they did. But every time, whenever somebody was visiting, an high\nofficial, instead to -- what they did in prior years, to demonstrate how people are getting 25 on\ntheir buttocks, they brought the high officials into my office, and showed him the -- the model,\nyeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Why?",
        "A: Because -- look, I don\u2019t know, it happened that -- it turned out that it was very beneficial for\nthe camp, that there was never -- there was never again, since I made the model, they had -- you\nsee, they were showing off with something always, but nobody ever performed the 25 since then.\nThey were proud of their model, yeah.",
        "A: Isn\u2019t that funny?",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t even know what high officials I had in that drawing office, because there were\nreally a lot of very important looking people. I know one thing, Hitler wasn\u2019t there.",
        "A: But, with those primitive SS people, I once made a joke, but it was not a joke, it turned out to\nbe a very good -- good weapon. They always asked me, \u201cWhat kind of an profession do you\nhave?\u201d I did that, I did that, what kind of a pro -- I said, \u201cThe same like your fuhrer.\u201d Yeah.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: Can you imagine? No, we are laughing now, but it was --",
        "A: -- for me then, I -- I tried to -- to keep those people out of my way. Same profession as your\nfuhrer. Son of a bitches. Now, what can I tell you? Any other question, or are you too tired?",
        "A: Would you like to wa -- a cup of coffee or something?",
        "A: Huh?\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: I went to sleep.",
        "A: I was tired. I just realized afterwards, clarify we will, after you\u2019ve make an -- after we\u2019ll make\nan transcript.",
        "A: That I can correct, yeah?",
        "A: There I will be able to clarify better th-than -- you see, I must see certain things in front of\nme.",
        "A: I\u2019m a visual person.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: I can\u2019t tell you --",
        "A: -- it\u2019s very -- it\u2019s not Auschwitz only. Let\u2019s compare -- and I like to compare Auschwitz with\nthe present civilian environment, yeah?",
        "A: Because we are living in a normal life, in a normal environment. Who f -- f -- I mean, New\nYork is an big city, but a little village, a little -- an borough, whatever community, what does the\nordinary person know about the structure of the city hall? In spite of the fact that we have\ntelevision performance, exposure, we know that people can come and discuss it, and present their\nproblems, and there\u2019s a group of people, com-committees, and so on, who are listening, who are\ngoing ahead, and are engaged in problem solving, and betterment of certain malfunctions, t-\ntrying to help, and to make life more bearable. But who -- who knows how -- how the system\nworks? Who knows the mechanics? Now why should the ordinary person in Auschwitz have\nknown the mechanics of the camp, or the camp leadership? Why are we expecting that? Only\nthose who were engaged, or are engaged today in city hall business will know, and know, and\nknow how to go ahead, and how to conduct the certain sessions, and how to conduct the\nleadership. I mean, how to engage in the leadership, and what to do. The ordinary -- I don\u2019t know\nwhat the -- how they are -- how it works. And there\u2019s no plan of -- of s -- simplified to explain to\nthe public, not even who is who. And who -- who\u2019s -- who is doing what. Wh-Why do we expect\n-- know that ev-every ordinary, poor, ex, dirty, stinky inmate, hungry, half-dead musselman,\nshould know what happened in Birkenau, and in Auschwitz? Is that an answer?",
        "A: Good.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Good, we were prisoners.",
        "A: Yeah? There is a prison system in the United States.",
        "A: Who knows about the prison system? Who ask about it? Who cares about it?",
        "A: Yeah? The prisoners themselves, today, they\u2019re interested in one thing, to have food, to have\nmedical care, to -- not to e -- be exposed to brutality by their guards, but -- and some of them\nmay be interested in the jury leg -- jury -- legal system, yeah?",
        "A: And learn more about the law, and they have a chance to -- even to study, but how many of\nthose people will, after their sentence, be engaged in the cil -- in civil law? Just few who are\ninterested. And same thing as here. Those who survived and were -- became interested later on,\nwhat really happened to them, they have learned, and they know a little bit more than the average\nperson. But they participated in one thing, all of those -- of those who -- who are able to speak\nout. They mu-must remember how they were -- how they were perform -- not perform, transform\nfrom being an civilian into an inmate. They remember, even if a little bit, and not everything,\nhow they -- what happened to them when they were stripped naked, when they were shaved,\nyeah, when they were registered maybe, yeah. Then driven into an barrack, and all those basic\nthings, they have remembered them.",
        "A: They remember they had an blockelteste.",
        "A: Yeah? Now what -- why must they remember anything else what they never ec -- never --\nthey were never exposed to anything else, yeah?",
        "A: So it is not just the people don\u2019t know, they were never exposed to anything. And they were\ninterested in one thing, to sleep and to eat. They were the two enemies, sleeplessness, I mean --",
        "A: -- the lack of the chance to sleep enough, and to eat enough. And s -- hygiene, and then comes\nmedical facilities, let alone a medication, or well-being during an -- an roll call, yeah. The roll\ncall was actually the center of everything. Everything was built around the roll call, yeah.",
        "A: Depended on the roll call, the food supply, if there were a thousand people, and you have\nreceived 900 rations, yeah, there was an problem. So as we mentioned yesterday, and I explained\nto you that the male prisoners -- the non-Jewish male prisoners, who were there much earlier\nthan the Jewish prisoners, male and female, the male prison -- non-Jewish male prisoners were\nmainly ex-military people, fren -- from France, from each country. They knew what an roll call\nis, they knew that an -- the formation into five and all that, is of importance to make things easier\nand quicker, but the women did not understood, and the Jewish male, especially of the religious\nsect, did not understood, yeah. Now they think that they have committed an act of resistance,\nthose idiots, yeah? That was no act of resistance, to -- to made it impossible to be counted, that\nwas an k-killing situation. They were beaten, they were -- they have extended the duration of the\nroll call, and a -- the s -- it -- stupidity of they\u2019re not allowed to be counted, and all that, did not\nhelp, so again -- and we were not soldiers, the women were not soldiers, ex-soldiers, we didn\u2019t\nknow what it meant in the beginning at least, and then later on, of course it -- we have learned\nwhat -- what the roll call is, but it was an torture, because we hadn\u2019t -- the people had no\nexperience, they didn\u2019t understood. And everybody wanted to stand during a lo -- roll call with\nher sister, while moving forward, and backwards, and they were -- they had the ti -- never made\nany sense. They -- they did not understood, nobody\u2019s there to explain, yeah, so.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.",
        "A: The blockelteste, no. Th-There was told -- look, people in charge had certain obli -- had\ncertain -- no -- had an obligation, certain obligation to tell the people, come out, we have to count\nyou. Stand in fi -- in -- in five rows, yeah. Who had time, in an hungry, wild, hoard, th -- the -- it\nwas an wild hoard of people, yeah, who had time to speak and to explain, and who was listening,\nyeah? There was an ordered, do that, yeah. If you didn\u2019t --",
        "A: -- a order, do that, go stand in five --",
        "A: -- in perf -- in five of rows, yeah.",
        "A: That was the order. If you did it, fine. If not, you were hit. There was hitting going on,\npushing, kicking, screaming. So that was not an normal situation, you had hungry, wild people,\nwho didn\u2019t know what is going on, and nit -- did not understood, and you could not talk, because\nthere was no time to talk. You -- if you wanted that people should do something, you s -- the f --\nyou were giving an order, and if they did not obey to the order, they were be-beaten, and once\nthey were beaten, things -- it was an horrible situation. And then the SS came in, and they were\ncoming with dog. They had to be -- it -- it was an wild horde of hungry, miserable people, yeah,\nin the beginning. Later on, when they have learned -- it took awhile, that if they are going out,\nand they do that quick as possible, they can go back quick as possible. That meant they could rest\nlonger, they could sleep longer, there was no beating. But 1t took awhile, but there was no tal --\nlook, you\u2019re Mrs. Lehrman, in one of her speeches that were printed in -- in the newsletter,\nexplained that she was -- something happened during roll call, and the blockelteste took an\nbucket of cold water and -- and -- over her body, I don\u2019t know why. She must have been wild,\ntoo, because she must have ec -- behaved just like what I explained to you before, that an\nblockelteste will use water fe -- every drop of water was so precious, she must have behaved\nimpossible, yeah. But that she doesn\u2019t know, and does not even bother to explain. Then she\nmentions the name of the blockelteste, yeah. That woman lives here, and I know her very well.\nShe was not an bitch, she was a normal human being, who was living later on in a displaced\nperson camp, and believe me, she would have been such an horrible woman, she wouldn\u2019t have\nsurvived one day. So, she doesn\u2019t even bother to find out who that blockelteste was, yeah. You\nknow s -- her name, she mentioned her name. So the bucket of water, that was the big -- big\nevent that she used a bucket of water to calm her down. But can you imagine how wild she must\nhave been? And we had man-many, many of those people, who just turned crazy.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Every -- every --",
        "A: -- roll call was in front of the barrack.",
        "A: Nearly hundred.",
        "A: Or individuals who worked in one capacity of secretaries or so, outside of the camp, who\nwent out every day. But they were part of the camp office. On the -- the work place or\nsomewhere, not concentrated where we -- yeah, it was the camp, it was the office -- the office\nworkers of the camp.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Logistic -- logistics.",
        "A: Everything. It was the -- real heart, the be-beating heart of entizil. It was the most important\nfunction, the most important function of the whole camp, and it is just too bad that Laura Shelley\ndid not understood what she did with the secretaries of that.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Wait a minute. Those decisions were made for -- merely for the whole system in all Germany,\nso it was made at an very high level. I couldn\u2019t tell you where, and who was responsible for it,\nbut just like the civilian population had their food rations, and which applied to each German\ncitizen, and -- or applied to -- to the German population of an certain working group, like light\nindustry, or heavy industry, or whatever, there were certain standards set, yeah. Now, so they\nwere set certain standards for the concentration camp population, and we have information of the\ncaloric intake, and the caloric standards, or supplies for the civilian population, and for the\nworking population in the -- and in the working -- in the camp population. Now, those special\nrations which every two weeks or so were supplied to heavy -- to indus -- to workers who were\nworking in heavy industry -- prisoners or civilians were sometimes identical, yeah. And there are\nstudies made, there are tables, there are reports on that. I couldn\u2019t tell you that by heart, but it is\navailable, and the East Germans did that already after the war, and published that.",
        "A: In many publications, so if that is of interest to you, you can go into the files and -- and look\ninto that, easily.",
        "A: Oh no.",
        "A: X num -- no, the population in the camp, man or women, had the same supply, food supply,\nyeah?",
        "A: And the order what to supply, on an daily or weekly or monthly basis, was not decided 1n -- in\nthe camp. Not in the camp, not in the headquarters of the SS. It was -- it was coming from an\nhigher authority, I couldn\u2019t tell you where from, yeah, but when every day 1s a kitchen -- it was a\nkitchen where you have to collect your bread, in the kitchen you -- the bread rations of an gi-\ngiven day, yeah. All week they were five -- for five people, one bread, or four people, or two\npeople, yeah. And accordingly, they had supplied to the barracks, some bread rations.",
        "A: If there was margarine, the kitchen had the order to supply for 10 people one cube, or five\npeople, whatever. The kitchen was the one who -- who supplied -- you supplied the kitchen with\nthe amount of people, and you were rec -- you received the amount of rations. But they had the\norders from somewhere, yeah, I couldn\u2019t tell you where from. We had nothing to do with that,\nthe -- we couldn\u2019t care less.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. But that happened in the beginning, because they were not quite sure, and they never\nreceived the proper amount --",
        "A: -- of people, because the roll call was not organized, and was contro -- out of control, because\nthe system was not established. But the moment when Katya took over, there was no way that\nsomebody would have gone hungry to bed, yeah. For each person, it -- if -- for each person\nreported, there was an ration, the daily ration. No matter what. It never happened.",
        "A: It did not happen. And if by accident something happened, then the blockelteste was clever\nenough to su -- to -- to divide the rations so that everybody had something to eat, yeah.",
        "A: Yes, and twice a week, an little piece of -- of sausage. There are people today, listen carefully,\nwho swear they have never seen an piece of margarine. They simply don\u2019t remember. Who\nswear they never had -- no -- never even knew that there is something else. They had sometimes\nan bit of marmalade, sometimes cheese. That was everybody, but they don\u2019t remember any more,\nI don\u2019t know why.",
        "A: The people from the barracks --",
        "A: No, they have f -- the -- the block stubendienst, yeah, those who were engaged in the block\npersonnel, they had to go in the morning and get the -- the tea, or coffee, or whatever they had,\nthey had to go in between and bring the bread, al-always to the kitchen. The kitchen supplied\neverything, yeah. In the kitchen, the portions were cut. In the kitchen everything was prepared,\nso it was easy to -- to count if one cube of margarine was for 10 people, so 100 people to be\nsupplied, you had 10 -- 10 cubes, yeah? It was not -- no big deal. The soup was always carried --\nthe kitchen supplied an -- an -- pa -- the personnel from each barrack had to go to the kitchen and\ncollect their -- their portions.",
        "A: Very. There were very strong people working in the kitchen, too, but it was mainly reserved\nfor Poles. In the women\u2019s kitchen were Polish women only.",
        "A: Some of them, some of them.",
        "A: Who?",
        "A: Oh yes. The Hungarians were stealing. Oh God, oh God. And not only that, the Hungarians\nwere cruel, stupid -- some of them -- stupid people. There were an couple of -- of Norwegian\nprisoners in the camp, males. They were so mean to them, they did not understood Europe, yeah,\nthey were coming just like the people out of the ghetto in -- in Romania or where -- where Elie\nWiesel comes from, those little shtetls. They never heard of a rest -- the rest of Europe. And right\nin the camp, there were Norwegians, big, clumsy, yeah, good types of pe -- but couldn\u2019t speak\nanything. Definitely not Yiddish. And they were calling the Norwegians the Eskimos, can you\nimagine? And were making fun of [inaudible], and were mean. After the war, it\u2019s very little\nknown, the Norwegian government took in Jewish refugees, under one condition, no Hungarians.\nNo Hungarian Jews. They were not allowed to enter no -- Norway, and nobody knew why, yeah.\nIt was an silent, secret, unwritten regulation and law, yeah. But I can tell you why, yeah. Let --\nbut I -- I would not mention that -- oh, I would like to have that off record, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: We were washing ourselves, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. We -- not -- not smart, I mean we were hydra -- dehydrated, too. So if you have used an\ncouple of sips, was good enough for your body, but you could clean your genitals, you could\nclean your face, your hands, whatever. You can, with an piece of a rag, if it\u2019s wet, can clean your\nwhole body, yeah. You know that. Even patients in an hospital are washed with a little bit of\nwater, and that is good enough. So, that what we did.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know --",
        "A: -- if the people in the camp office. I did it in -- in the camp office we had water. In the camp\noffice, we had other conditions.",
        "A: But I did it in an time when we had no access to anything, in the beginning, especially. I did\nit, but I don\u2019t know what the others did, really not.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: Every day, I have used more margarine on the face then, than I am using cosmetics today,\nyeah. And I massaged my face every day, every day in the morning, after I washed the face with\nmargarine, and not only that, the rest of my hands, I\u2019ve smoothed, went over my hairdo, yeah,\nand it was shining. So I looked pretty well groomed, by using the existing -- the existing -- what\nshall I tell you? It\u2019s existing na -- material, or whatever, yeah. That what I did. I don\u2019t know what\nthe others did, yeah. And definitely never discuss what to do. It was an drive, it was an natural\ndrive to look smooth, to look good, because to have cracks around your lips, or s -- on your skin\nm-meant sometimes death. People were selected for that, yeah.",
        "A: Ihave massaged my fingers, my hands. I never -- I really had better -- in those days I looked\nbetter much more often [indecipherable] today. Today I am using ordinary water and soap. There\nI have used at least cream, and I don\u2019t use any lotion. I don\u2019t know why, but I massaged my face,\naround my eyes, just like the book said, with margarine. And during outdoor works, the sun\nmade such an nice -- such a good work, the sun and margarine is giving you such an beautiful\ntan, yeah.",

I\nreceived some photos from her, she is over 80, older than I am, looks good, beautiful face, s --\neverything looks good. So, at an occasion, while being on the phone with her, I have ask her,\n\u201cTell me, when did you had your last face lift?\u201d Yeah? I -- I was very honest, and expected an\nhonest answer. She said, \u201cI beg your pardon? Didn\u2019t you told me to use margarine in Auschwitz\nfor my face? I never had a facelift, and I have the best skin you can imagine, and thanks to you.\u201d",

She had the money, and the\nmassages, and everything. So, if she would have used, instead of whatever she used, mar-\nmargarine, she would never develop -- she would have never developed the crocodile skin. No --\nanyhow, I once said --",

They should pay me for that, what I am saying\nnow, some -- I should collect some -- what are -- what are you calling that in English, if -- if you\nget interest, of -- no, not interest. I am not -- in an commercial, yeah, you get so and so much if\nyou make an commercial, and if you repeat that [indecipherable]",

But, so if you have s -- then, when people were selected for better jobs, Jewish\nwomen, they were dressed into striped clotheses, too.",
        "A: Yes, but after that, we switched back to civilian clotheses, but good ones, yeah.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Because they wanted us to look -- 1t was summer, and it -- summertime the striped stuff was\ntoo heavy, so they even supplied the non-Jewish women with civilian clotheses, but they were all\n-- b -- they were all lightweight uniformed -- uniformed material dresses, specially sewn for the\nprisoners, yeah.",

And exchanged -- clotheses were either exchange after delousing\nprocess, not always. Sometimes you received the same stuff back, but sometimes they just took\nthe stuff away and supplied you with different things. Now, what is it you would like to know?",

        "A: But -- yeah. And it was quite an big enterprise, yeah. There were 600 people working in that\nbusiness.",
        "A: It was the incoming stuff, and outgoing stuff had to be counted, had to be prepared, had to be\nbundled, yeah. Was constant movement. And don\u2019t forget the beglidinskammer had to supply the\nbranch camps, wherever a woman was, just the same, yeah. They sometimes changed very often\ntheir clothes, more often than -- than the outdoor workers. So they have supplied them with new\nclothing, or clean clothing, and received the dirty one, yeah. It was an clearinghouse for constant\nchange, especially the odds -- the branch camps were very well looked after, yeah, they are\nalways well dressed, clean. That was an very important function, the function of the -- of the\nclothing from barrack, yeah. Very important. In the beginning they were full of lies, but later on,\nit was whenever you have -- whenever you could see somebody from those branch camps, they\nlooked just like out of the box, beautifully dressed. Everything was beautiful, clean.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Every -- a-all the clothes, it\u2019s not --",
        "A: -- not only for -- they would clean for the indoors too, but not -- not under -- under such care,\nand -- and --",
        "A: It depend --",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: It -- the -- in -- inside workers of the camp -- of the main camp, were well dressed, too, yeah,\nclean. They could -- the blockelteste had som-sometimes an problem to take the whole barrack,\nand to exchange the -- to stand there in front of the beglidinskammer, 1n front of the clothing\nbarrack, and exchange dresses, yeah. So they received clean ones, and they left the dirty ones.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: You could -- you could -- the blockelteste could ask for sweaters, and receive for each\nmember of the barrack an sweater under the clothes, to wear, yeah.",
        "A: Yes, it was an regulation.",
        "A: That the people are [indecipherable] to receive that, or that, or that, yeah? Or they were\nforbidden to have that, that, and that, yeah? For example, a woman was not allowed to wear the\nbrassiere. While we in the camp office, we had brassieres. Nobody -- nobody bothered, yeah.",
        "A: Those who had striped clotheses, there was -- there were under -- underpants, not very -- very\nsexy ones, but there were underpants, and some kind of an undershirt, and the others, the Jewish\nprisoners, who wore dresses, or whatever, they -- they were allowed to -- to wear an -- sweaters,\nunder the dress.",
        "A: No, because sun -- they had to be recognized as prisoners, yeah.",
        "A: You could wear under -- under the dress, anything you wanted. Underwear, you organized.\nThey were stealing. They were -- I sometimes ask some girls from the clothing barrack to get me\nsome panties, a dozen or so. So I took the whole dozen on my body, went to an barrack,\nundressed myself, supplied that among the people, and returned without.",
        "A: Yeah. But sometimes they were s -- shri -- they were shrinking those gloves, sometimes an\nreal glove looked like was that -- like my fist, small, because they went through -- through the\nsteam cleaning machine, and was shrinking. But in some of the outdoor work -- workplaces, they\nwere allowed to wear gloves, and received gloves.",
        "A: Gloves.",
        "A: Yeah. Pardon, socks?",
        "A: Nobody cared, yeah, if you wore socks, or if you had rags. Soldiers wear rags too, so it was\nnot officially supplied, yeah, but somehow they couldn\u2019t care less. Everybody looked after them\n-- after herself and people somehow had what -- what they -- some of them had no chance to\nprotect themselves in wintertime, they fr-frozen toes. Some of the girls had frozen nipples. It\u2019s a\npity that you don\u2019t speak German. I have here some good literature of -- of -- of interviews. I\nhave here some interviews of people who are describing their pro-problems at wintertime, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. I may give you an copy of an -- of one paper where -- no, [indecipherable] it\u2019s a --\nreferences, no, it\u2019s enough if I tell you that the girls had frozen nipples.",
        "A: They were coming to me, and -- and as I have learned from one of the doctors, that cod liver\noil is very good for frozen -- frozen parts of the body, and -- and frozen nipples. I collected cod\nliver oil every day from the garbage heap of the -- of the [indecipherable]. There was no garbage\nheap, but the package room, where the non-Jewish prisoners re -- would receive packages from\nhome, were opened before they were supplied to the -- to the owner, and they have taken out all\nthe vitamins. Every package at least contained an bottle of cod liver oil from home, because it\nwas so good, and important. But the SS removed from each package, the cod liver oil, and the\nvitamins, and throwing that out in front of the barrack, and in the morning -- early morning, the\ncleaners, they are coming, collecting that, and into the garbage. Now when I have learned that, as\nthe package room was next to our barrack, the package barrack was number five, I was living on\nnumber four, I went out every morning, and collected all the cod liver oil, not the vitamins, but I\ntook all the cod liver oils into my camp office. I re -- consumed every day, one bottle of cod liver\noil. I was stinking. From miles away you could feel that somebody who was -- who was smelling\nafter cod liver oil, but I think it saved my life. It saved a lot, because if -- to have in your body,\nevery day, an bottle of cod liver oil, meant something, yeah.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Drinking, drinking.",
        "A: Cod liver oil?",
        "A: Good, then go into the library and read.",
        "A: Read what it does. But, besides that, I drank -- I was drinking daily one bottle of cod liver oil\nfor months, maybe a whole year. Then, I supplied the hospital, my doctor friends, with cod liver\noil, so that when patients were coming they could treat them, and friends of mine who had frozen\nnipples and toes, I supplied them with cod liver oil so that they can treat themselves.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yeah. If so -- if it was not overdue, because sometimes the toes were falling off, yeah. But\neverybody noticed an frozen nipple, so most of the girls were coming, and I supplied them with\ncod liver oil, okay? That\u2019s an story, too.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Yeah. Huh?",
        "A: All the workers got wooden shoes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. And inside workers got good shoes, not -- you see, the cont -- the whole system was\nnot designed for the well being of the inmates, yeah?",
        "A: And sometimes you had big shoes, and sometimes you had small shoes, so it was a mite --\nnightmare, the shoe business. I, for example, could not get boots. And people were allowed to\nwear boots at wintertime, and I couldn\u2019t get boots, do you know why? Because most women\nwere taller than I, and the size of the boot was too high. It was hitting my knees. So I never -- I\nnever, never, during all those years, I\u2019ve been able to get a pair of boots to fit my legs.",
        "A: No, th-then when the summer was coming, yeah, it was too hot, and then I had a better job\nalready, I couldn\u2019t walk around with those shoes, you know, in the camp office.",
        "A: The first.",
        "A: The first winter, yeah.",
        "A: Shoes.",
        "A: I could any -- any pair of shoes in the -- shoe in the clothing barrack. I just se --",
        "A: Well then, I had my -- my boot.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: As long as I could.",
        "A: Very.",
        "A: Very, very.",
        "A: And for my size, yeah. I never had an -- what are you calling in English? You get s-some\nhardening -- the hardening --",
        "A: Corns, yeah.",
        "A: I never had a corn in my whole life.",
        "A: Never had a corn. Because I have always taken care of my shoes, which I wore, yeah.",
        "A: They are as crucial in New York as in Auschwitz, believe me.",
        "A: What do you think, why have they developed after so many years, that kind of walking shoes\npeople wear, even with fur coats, yeah? By the way, I had -- I developed one bunion, several\nyears ago. Now, that has nothing to do with Auschwitz, what I\u2019m telling you. And a bunion is no\nfun, and most people must undergo surgery because it hurts. I have decided not to undergo\nsurgery, and I have decided no matter how expensive, and how pretty the shoe is, I have cut out\nan hole on each pair of shoes, where the bunion grew. And if you are looking today my -- at my\nli -- leg, I have no bunion any more.",
        "A: It just went away, because normally, if you have the pressure --",
        "A: And I -- people were laughing at me. Here, in New York. I was well dressed, beautiful shoes,\nand the cut up -- and the hole, and I couldn\u2019t care less, yeah. And it was a good decision. I'll\nshow you.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Okay, you have learned something now.",
        "A: It\u2019s worthwhile to ruin your shoes, than to ruin your leg.",
        "A: And just an ordinary little hole, and if it\u2019s too little, then you can make it bigger.",
        "A: Even if the whole bunion comes out. If you have black shoes and wear black stockings,\nnobody notice that.",
        "A: Washing and what?",
        "A: Yeah, the latrine -- oh, the famous latrine. Yeah, what would you like to know about the\nfamous latrine?",
        "A: No, you can\u2019t --",
        "A: [indecipherable] you don\u2019t go right there. And nobody was allowed to leave the roll call, for\nheaven\u2019s sake.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: N-Not during.",
        "A: It depends. Before, or after, but not during, yeah. During roll calls you had to be there.",
        "A: And nobody bothered if y -- it\u2019s after or before. If the roll call was announced, people had to\ngather. And if the roll call was terminated by a missile, people could disperse.",
        "A: They -- they -- yeah. If it wasn\u2019t too late in the morning, that they had the formation of work\ndetails and so on, yeah. But if it was an urgent matter, you had to go.",
        "A: The -- very early.",
        "A: Very early, very early. It was still dark, yeah. So, it winter time, when is it dark? Still --",
        "A: Roll call started, actually, the waking up -- I couldn\u2019t tell you exactly the time, but it was\naround five o\u2019clock. And until you -- six o\u2019clock, I think, you had to s -- wait until the SS man\nwas coming and counting you.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: We had -- Katya, during our time, when we tried to make life easier for the people, under all\ncircumstances, on an rainy day, on an windy day, or on bad day, we allowed the people to had --\nI mean, we arranged to allow some of the people, where applicable, to stay indoors, yeah, and to\nbe counted indoors, yeah.",
        "A: If I say applicable, if there was no room for such an usual amount of [indecipherable]\nthousand, because there was no space.",
        "A: So, it was always close to the barrack, where they were protected from the weather, and from\nthe sun, or so. But, usually it took place outdoors, because th -- if it was too heavy, an heavy rain,\nthe SS didn\u2019t wanted to get wet, either. So it was never done for the inmates -- I mean, they\nwould never allow that for the benefit of the inmates, but for their own benefit. And we have\nused that, yeah.",
        "A: We have used that, by talking them into indoor -- indoor counting.\nBeginning of Tape Six, Side A",
        "A: Blah, blah.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: No, there was curfew, curfew, curfew.",
        "A: Late. Around 10, I think. But I couldn\u2019t tell you that exactly, we had no watches. Whenever\nthey decided curfew, there were whistle -- whistles -- the whistles went on, and there was\ncurfew, and then you were not allowed to leave, otherwise you could have been shot.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: You could.",
        "A: Some of them had a little bit -- a little bit, but not really. It depend where. In Birkenau the la -\n- la -- the wooden barracks -- yeah, the wooden barracks had buckets. The brick barracks had\nbuckets, too. The latrines were actually real buildings, wooden buildings, or brick buildings,\nbehind the whole row in the -- in the women\u2019s camp. Beho -- behind the row of brick barracks,\nthere were barracks who -- in -- were in use for -- for the latrine. We have -- they are still in good\nshape today, they still exist. You can see for those if you go to Birkenau, you can see how the\nlatrines looked. There were holes --",
        "A: -- where you were sitting, and doing your business. It was an ugly business.",
        "A: Very ugly.",
        "A: Uh?",
        "A: Oh, to sit there, and to be pushed around sometimes, be -- there were more people than holes.",
        "A: I went on the barrack -- on the bucket, but in the beginning I was living there, too.",
        "A: And I had diarrhea. And I don\u2019t even want to think about it.",
        "A: Horrible. Bloody diarrhea, no medication, dirty, couldn\u2019t clean yourself. Wait -- wait until the\nnext morning, you had an bit of tea, and then you had to use that to clean yourself, and to wash\nyour tookas. It\u2019s horrible, horrible.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Who -- who could think about dehydration? We had nothing to drink.",
        "A: Because the water we\u2019ve -- they\u2019ve supplied us, that caused the diarrhea, was infected water.\nSo th-that, you cannot imagine, it was -- was like an vicious circle. If -- I really don\u2019t know how\neverything work -- how I -- how I overcame all those things. Hard to believe. You see, diarrhea\nis something unpleasant, even here, when you have all the facilities, let alone where you had no\nfacilities whatsoever to clean yourself, or to -- to -- to use an toilet whenever you had the urge,\nyeah. And there was not diarrhea only, as you had some -- always two or three different\nconditions. I don\u2019t know how we did it, I really don\u2019t know. I tell you what I did, during the\nheavy time, and hard time, somehow I got myself a tin -- a tin, and whenever I had the urge to do\nsomething during the night, I used the tin. Then -- put that in front of my legs, in that bed where\nwe were laying, but some of the women used their -- their eating --",
        "A: Bowls for both, and that was an big tragedy, because they never -- they couldn\u2019t survive. You\nsee, you -- you infected yourself, and re-infected yourself. You couldn\u2019t -- and no matter what\nwe did to explain not to do that, it didn\u2019t help. So, I can tell you what I did, but I can not ec --\nexplain why the others used only th-the same bowl for their business they used for eating. I never\ndid it. I got -- got myself a can of -- it was approximately as -- ama -- an two pound can, tall like\nthat. Was just good to use as a -- for urinating. Also, I never had to go down when -- I like to live\nalways on the top, where most people didn\u2019t wanted to climb, cause they had no -- no energy. I\ncould always climb, I was always on the top, and there used my -- my -- and then all I had to go\nwas going down in the morning, and s -- and empty that into the bucket. And then I left the can\nagain on my bed, and -- and the block personnel, who checked those beds, and sometimes even\narranged the beds, they never -- never throw those cans out. They knew what it is used for. So\nthat is the way how I really survived.",
        "A: How I managed, yeah.",
        "A: Some of them, probably, yes. Nobody -- there was no consitent --",
        "A: -- to tell you what to do, yeah?",
        "A: You acted on your own instinct, and own judgement. There you were really alone. What are\nyou doing?",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: About what?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, no, no, we had mattresses with straw.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, in -- yeah. It -- mattresses -- I mean, it was not a mattress like --",
        "A: -- you go out and buy a mattress, but it was an -- kind of an pillow k -- a large pillow cover,\nyeah, with an hole in the center, where you stuffed in straw. So it was covered, and protected,\nyeah, and then we were sleeping on that.",
        "A: No, no, no, the bunks had the wooden -- wooden bottom, and the blockelteste, and the block\npersonnel, had to get those from an special unit, who supplied mattresses, and the straw, yeah.\nThey -- that had to be carried from an special unit, into the block.",
        "A: Forever.",
        "A: All the time.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: They were thrown out, and I -- they were ye -- probably full of urine, or who knows what.",
        "A: After awhile, but it took awhile.",
        "A: But -- huh?",
        "A: Again, you had to s -- you had to ask for it, and then you had -- you were supplied with -- you\nhave -- or they arranged the supply of any request from time to time, yeah.",
        "A: 15.",
        "A: On -- on one bunk, yeah.",
        "A: 15.",
        "A: You mean -- which bunks?",
        "A: Ah, Auschwitz one, we were on the floor.",
        "A: Then we were in wooden beds, there were no bunks.",
        "A: In vi -- wooden beds, those t-t-tri -- t-three bunk --",
        "A: Bunk bed, ah. There were always two people in one.",
        "A: We were never alone, never alone.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Foot -- foot -- foot and head.",
        "A: And if you were more on the loving side, and you had your lover, then were sleeping the way\nyou wanted, right?",
        "A: But normally people slept so that we could accommodate ourselves.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: As -- it was actually introduced by -- in the beginning, not amongst the Jewish girls, but in the\nbeginning, where we had so many German from Ravensbriick, the first thousand, you had many\nwho were there for years, in Ravensbriick, and they have developed some relationship among\nthemselves, and those who had no partners, were looking -- seeking for partners amongst the\nJewish women. And Jewish women were introduced to lesbianism, as German women from\nRavensbritck. They didn\u2019t know one thing, they didn\u2019t know the difference, they didn\u2019t know\nanything, yeah. So, it was very hard to distinguish who is really a partner or not. But people were\nlooking for love, and warmth, and companionship. They\u2019re lonely.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I have never experienced anything, because I had friends from home, from the\nyouth movement and so on, so we were used to live together in the summer camps, and so on. So\nthere was no lack of -- lack of -- we were not lonely, yeah. Girls from school, neighbors, we\nalways were seeking for some old relationship from home. We were young then, and sports --\nfrom the sports club, or so on. So it -- it -- if is me, I had no -- I personally had no problems, I\nalways had company, and that was good enough.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: [indecipherable] it -- look, the -- the problem among the people was -- was a language, yeah?\nIt\u2019s not enough just to be attracted by a body, right? In those days, we needed communication.\nYou had to learn how to survive, you had to learn many things, and that couldn\u2019t be done without\nan verbal communication. So, people who knew the language, the German women, spoke\nGerman. Our women, from Slovakia in the beginning, spoke enough German to communicate.\nThey were -- but we were mainly looking for the companionship of political prisoners, because\nthose who were professional prostitutes, were not very attractive to us, they were different, was\nan different -- different category of people. And the political prisoners had their own\ncompanionship with -- since Ravensbrick, who -- there were couples who were already\nestablished couples. And those who had no partner were not even seeking for any partner,\nbecause they had their husbands at home, or in -- during the war, somewhere on the front, or they\nwere old, and were never married, and had no -- didn\u2019t know what it means to have a partner at\nall, yeah, spinsters, who were -- but they were decent people who were idealists, because that\nwas the reason why they were put into the camp as Socialists or Communists. So, I myself\nalways looked for good people. I had an good friend who was the wife of an -- she was German,\nbut had an Jewish husband, and two sons at home. And she practiced, more or less, medicine.\nWe had such different ailments, like in civilian life, all of a sudden, everybody -- most of the\nwomen -- at least I, among others, we were lot an -- pus in my whole mouth, yeah. Between the\nteeth, the tongue, everything. I couldn\u2019t talk, I couldn\u2019t swallow, I couldn\u2019t do nothing. It was an\nawful situation. I don\u2019t know where from, how she got it, she was coming every day with\nsomething. And I had to keep that in my mouth for awhile, and then spit it out, and she cured me,\nyeah. Because she knew from experience, what to do under the camp conditions. Having her\nhusband to probably practice medicine there an different way, but I had an woman what -- during\nmy malaria attacks, who was an Jehovah Witness, who brought -- and worked in the SS\npharmacy. They were stealing every day, one tablet of shineen, yeah.",
        "A: Shineena. That is the medication if you have malaria. Shining, hining, shining, how do you\npronounce it? C-h-1-n-1-n-e. Good?",
        "A: So, I had a pool of helpers help us, yeah? Of good people, and I would not s -- would not deal\nwith -- with the rough or low -- low grade -- low grade morally, low grade people. I -- I was\nselective, and that was my luck, yeah. Could speak the language, and it was my luck that I was\nselective. And so -- but nobody approached me, ever.",
        "A: I was an ugly -- must have been very ugly with my short hair.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: You always had an camp sister.",
        "A: If nothing, always. Why? It was practical, more practical to have two rations together to\nshare, than to have only one ration, yeah. You could manipulate, if you had two pieces of bread,\ntwo rations, and two pieces or margarine, yeah, you could go and use together only one ration of\nmargarine together. Limit yourself. And one ration of bread, but exchange the other half for\nsomething which was more important than the ration, yeah? And I was never in the exchange\nbusiness, but n -- I had a partner, a very religious girl, whom I found there in the camp office. I\nhave known her brother at home, and because of that she was more attracted -- I was more\nattracted to her, and she trusted me. With her I was even sleeping together in one bed. She\nbecame my partner, but very religious. And she\u2019s still alive, she lives in Jerusa -- in the --\nJerusalem. She was a business women. She went out and exchanged sometimes, she returned\nwith some garlic, or with an onion, yeah, what the girls were smuggling in from the field where -\n- where they had to perform. Now, I knew that that is important, more important than a piece of\nbread, so if we were eating garlic, and onions with margarine on bread. Even if only half of it\nwat -- the vitamins were more important than the starch, yeah? So that was an relationship where\nshe was a businesswoman, she supplied me with all the goodies, and -- but she became my -- my\nca -- then later on, I became to shabbas goy, it was Pesach, and she wouldn\u2019t eat bread, so we\nhad to exchange the bread against potatoes. And we had to cook the potatoes illegally. I had\nalready my drawing office, I had an stove, yeah. So I cooked inside of the stove, because outside\nwe were not allowed to sh -- to cook. And that was an relationship of eating together, and do-\ndoing business together, and most girls v -- eat -- nobody was eating alone, that -- I can tell you\nthat. Th-That was an -- an habit, to have an partner with to eat, yeah, together. So, I don\u2019t know\nif the men did it. Irwin must have known better. I never spoke with him about it.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: He said no. But maybe in his experience.",
        "A: Yeah, but that was -- had nothing to do with love, or with lesbianism, or --",
        "A: It was just a necessity of going to an restaurant, you\u2019d rather sit with somebody and eat\ntogether, than to be alone in an corner. Right, or not?",
        "A: Same, I mean we were human, the same feelings, the same instinct.",
        "A: Among women, it was more important, no?",
        "A: Yeah. I can -- have never experien -- sometimes you had only one -- one -- what\u2019s his name?\nBowl. So you were forced to eat two people out of one bowl, yeah.",
        "A: If they like it or not.",
        "A: And we\u2019re entitled to two bowls of soup, so once they\u2019ve finished the first, they could collect\nthe second, but they were forced to eat together, or they had only one spoon, or -- look, they\nwere [indecipherable] funny circumstances, which drove you into -- into together in, yeah. It was\nnot the -- the men probably had their own bowl, and could eat their own soup by themselves,\nyeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It depend -- Irwin was never in Birkenau.",
        "A: Yeah. So, c-call mine was different, and in Auschwitz, he was better off than anybody in\nBirkenau, and still he described in his book his -- the camaraderie between an couple of men,\namong themselves, how they manage. That is an good book he wrote, yeah. But noth -- n-no\nmystery, and no I -- I -- I, yeah? It\u2019s very well done. I will give you one book to carry with you,\nbecause whenever you will have a chance to have somebody who speaks German, it will be\nhelpful to translate you an little bit --",
        "A: -- step by step, bit by bit, yeah. Do you think I\u2019m right?",
        "A: Good. Now, what else please?",
        "A: It -- does that answer what you -- your question about the camaraderie? The shortage of bowls\n-- bowls, or bowels?",
        "A: Bowls?",
        "A: Okay, b-o -- b-o-w-l, yeah?",
        "A: And bowel is?",
        "A: E-I? Uh huh.",
        "A: Bowel movement.",
        "A: Good, now I know.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Everybody wasn\u2019t what?",
        "A: Look, the people amongst themselves in the barrack, if th-they were living in an barrack, and\nworked in the same work detail, yeah, are so tired at the evening, and were so busy to look after\ntheir own business. That means eating, and sleeping, yeah. There was no time for being nice or\nnot nice. You will have today among people in good conditions living, neighbors are fighting\nneighbors, yeah. It\u2019s human. Some people, they\u2019re fighting with their mouths, yeah. Fist fights,\nnobody wanted to lose any energy. So it\u2019s harmless if you scream at each other. I don\u2019t even\nconsider that as not nice, just human to let it out. And I really don\u2019t know -- or don\u2019t think that to\nmake an big issue out of it. People were very tense, or weak, or tired, or sleepy, or hungry. So\nsometimes they screamed at each other, and screaming is harmless. I don\u2019t think that screaming\nis a crime. Not even if the blockelteste were scre -- the blockeltestes were screaming. To -- to\njudge blockelteste and other screaming personnel, f -- only for one reason that they were\nscreaming, is not justified.",
        "A: Uh-huh, yeah.",
        "A: First of all, newcomers brought in the news of the day --",
        "A: -- and events.",
        "A: Some had contact through the camp office. One person only, she wer -- was able to discover\nthe date, or the -- yeah, that spreads very quickly. There was the latrines, where people have\ncommunicated, even if they have known each other. That was no problem.",
        "A: That was no problem. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: My religious girl, she -- she knew everything.",
        "A: She had the calendar, we had in the camp office a day, and everything. There were\nnewcomers who brought exactly the -- all news in, and cross -- cross we -- we could cross check,\nor they could cross check the Jewish holidays. But it had no -- no significance for me personally,\nbecause to be in a place like that, it -- 1t could have become schizophrenic, to be in the hell, and\nto -- and to sing like in heaven, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Kosher? She was not eating anyth -- any sausage --",
        "A: -- when we had -- when we had the rations. I gaved her my cheese, and she gave me her\nsausage. So I ate her sausage too, and she was eating my cheese.",
        "A: And that how we managed. Pesach she was not eating any bread, but she was living on\npotatoes, and that was it.",
        "A: Who?",
        "A: Oh, runner.",
        "A: There were different types of runners. There were even runners, I can show you very nice\npictures of Indian tribes in the old times, and Indian tribes today, South American Indian tribes,\nwhere people live in the high plateau of the Andean mountains, where they have no other\ncommunication, like verbal communication between one tribe and another, by using individuals,\nthe so-called runners, yeah? They walk from one village to another and communicate, or convey\nmessages, and so on. So the runner business is not an invented one of the concentration camp,\nbut as we had no vehicles, the ter -- the distances between camp -- in the camp, between\nbarracks, were pretty large. Bicycles were not used for -- for -- inmates couldn\u2019t u -- did not have\nany bicycles, only the SS, some of them were able to use bicycles. The SS runners actually had\nbicycles. An runner is somebody who conveys messages, or who has an job to do, to do it fr --\n[indecipherable] from one point to another, and ha -- with a certain order to do something, to\nbring some people from one barrack to -- to another, to -- to the front entrance for any reason, or\nto -- 1S a Messenger service, more or less. Now, there were no -- no other way of communication,\nno-not even telephones, yeah. They have used people who were messengers, yeah. So,\nsometimes they had dual -- an dual duty. Sometimes they were runners who were sent from one -\n- from the main e -- from the camp office, for example, to an barrack, and convey an message or\nask the blockelteste to come to the camp office, or some similar orders were given from\nheadquarters, from the t-top management to us, and we had to execute that through the runners,\nyeah. Through those people who are sending them through different barracks, or different\nfacilities to -- to convey an certain order, or message, or whatever. And they work mainly in\ncouples. When the one couldn\u2019t do it, then the other took over, yeah, or when one was on lunch\nbreak, or in the toilet, and something has to be done in a hurry, the other took over. They were\ncouples molis. But then you had an other function of certain runners, who made an -- had an du-\ndual function. They were multi-lingual, and could be used as translators. So, such, for example,\nwas Mala, was an runner, and an translator between German and French, and German and I think\nPolish, she could speak Polish.",
        "A: Zeema, yeah.",
        "A: Then you had another runner, which was -- and an translator, which was not one to be\nidentified, but I know where -- her name, and I know where she lives. Her maiden name then\nwas Ava Pomeranz. She was an -- an -- one of those runners who took, like Mala, and many\nothers, who were taking sometimes people from the camp office, who were asked to report to our\ncamp office, and were then taken for -- with those runners, and an SS man, over to the Gestapo\nfor interrogation, yeah. That was one of the activities, too, to accompany certain people who\nhave to appear at the SS headquarters in the shtopskaboida for interrogation. That was ma -- one\nof the main activities of the shtopskaboida of personnel, SS with their secretaries. Now, there\nwas Mala, there was Ava Pomeranz, and so on. So, there are some still alive, and I know where\nthey are, and I even made myself a list of all the runners. So, 1t was an important activity,\nbecause without telephone, and without vehicles, and with such an big enterprise was -- there\nwas SO many movements going -- so many things going on, that they had that -- that it was a\nmessenger service among others, yeah.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: Wait a minute, [indecipherable] and two, four, six -- I would say a dozen.",
        "A: As a -- in the individual barracks, or th-they were not living in private rooms, just located\nclose to -- in -- they were living in -- in barracks, just like anybody else.",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",
        "A: You must realize that the la -- if it comes to insignias on the arms, there were the ar -- the arm\nbins, yeah?",
        "A: Bands, yeah. The la -- you had n-n-nearly every function was marked, yeah, in the camp. The\nblockelteste, the block administrator, the lagerelteste, the rapport schreiber, the -- every runner.\nMany, many people were marked so that you could recognize who they are. And at the\nworkplace, the same thing. You had the kapos, the sub-kapos, the foremen, and many other\nfunctions in the wor -- at the workplace, were still -- were marked just the same. So that wasn\u2019t\nmy job to do just the same, I did all those -- those arm --",
        "A: Correct, so I -- as you can see, I had an important job, yeah?",
        "A: Runner, it was --",
        "A: [indecipherable] lotfa.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: They were privileged, yeah of course, they had an job where they could enter any building,\nwhere they could run, or be outdoors any time of the day, even if there was curfew during an\nselection. That -- that was it.",
        "A: They ended up like what?",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Yeah, good, of course.",
        "A: With whom?",
        "A: Oh. I cannot answer that.",
        "A: Because you have an idea, do you think the SS wouldn\u2019t have had the same idea?",
        "A: So, you had -- you had -- you were very careful, because you see, if you -- everybody was\ncareful with those people, you never know for whom they are running, yeah?",
        "A: People in the resistance were not visible.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: If todays -- ev -- anybody who\u2019s telling you the story, resistance [indecipherable], they were\ninvisible people.",
        "A: But they were not visible.",
        "A: Everybody\u2019s telling you now he was in the resistance, now what kind of business is that?",
        "A: Selfish, stupid girl.",
        "A: Show-off, big mouth. She had her own contact reels, yeah, the Belgian Jewesses, and she\ncould help, because she could come into our office, and ask for favors any time, and she was\n[indecipherable] yeah. Any time, she -- she had to go through us. And if she needed something,\nshe could come and ask for a favor. But what we are talk -- making out of her, it\u2019s nonsense. If\nshe wouldn\u2019t have been stupid, she wouldn\u2019t have planned -- or she actually didn\u2019t planned her\nescape. If she wouldn\u2019t have been stupid, she wouldn\u2019t have done what she did. She had all the\nchances to survive. What was the hurry?",
        "A: Look, when she arrived, I was then still working -- you know I worked in the -- among others\nas the printer of those numbers --",
        "A: -- fo -- f-for newcomers, yeah? New arrivals.",
        "A: I was there when she arrived with an Belgian transport.",
        "A: It was late afternoon, must have been winter off -- late afternoon, but it was dark. So there\nwere -- I -- I don\u2019t know how many hundreds newcomers and to register them, and to process so\nmany, and until they are passing through everything, and finally got their numbered labels, and --\nsewn on, they were standing in one corner, and waiting until the whole group was processed, and\nafter that, the blockelteste, for whom they were designated to be transferred, was coming, and\ntook them to their barracks -- to the barracks. And that what happened with that particular\ntransport when she arrived, where she was in the Belgian transport. I was sitting there, and\nwatching, and all of a sudden, somebody went up on a table like that, and giving orders to the\ncrabat -- to the whole group. She didn\u2019t know, is she crazy? I went over to her, and I said, \u201c\u201cWhat\nare you doing here? Get down from the table.\u201d She didn\u2019t understood. I said, \u201cGet down. Look,\nyou are now in Auschwitz. You are not in Belgium, I don\u2019t want you to show off. The moment\nyou show off, you\u2019 ve -- the SS will remember you. Get down off here -- from here. Get off the\ntable.\u201d So, a-after awhile she went down. And then the next days -- she took over leadership,\nyeah? Next days, she was presented by the blockelteste as somebody who speaks languages. In\nthe arbatz einsatz, yeah. Was in our building, in our office, in our [indecipherable] my drawing\noffice, so she was sent -- given the job as an runner. And from the runner, she became translator,\nboth. And from there on, she had every day to come in the morning to the camp office, and take\norders, and what to do, and what [indecipherable] she got her work order every day, in the\nmorning. And that\u2019s the way how I have been with her on an daily basis, and I met her every\nday, and it was a normal relationship between me and the others. But that\u2019s the way -- that\u2019s the\ntime when we met for the first time, and when I jumped at her to get off, yeah. Because wa -- the\nmoment the SS noticed somebody with such qualities, they picked you and made -- gave to you\nan big job as an -- as an camp vi -- I don\u2019t know what, and it was not very nice to witness\nsomebody to be recruited f-for an cruel job, yeah? So in any case, that went on, on and on. She\ndid her job, and she was coming every day, and when she needed some favors to help the girls\nfrom Belgium, she had an easy -- easy approach to us, because we helped her. Now -- then, all of\na sudden, the day when she escaped, you know that she had malaria, and she used to have attacks\nfrom time to time, and we knew that. The day when she escaped, same day I we -- she was living\non number six barrack, in the barrack where the people from the -- the klidonskcamera, they are\nliving. And I went at lunchtime, over to six. There was Ava, my friend who lives now in Israel,\nwhose husband I made for -- the sign, yeah.",
        "A: Valansuela is her name now.",
        "A: And I went over with her because I think some of the Poles -- Polish men were coming, and\nwanted to meet with the girls in my office, I always vacated my office, I d -- I went walking. I\nwent over to Ava, to number six. Four, five, six, and Ava had a boyfriend, he was visiting her, an\nDutch boy, so I didn\u2019t wanted to interfere. Then I finally noticed the barrack was totally empty,\nbut -- because they were working in the beglidinskammer the whole barrack, but there was Mala\nin her bed, and next to her, her boyfriend Edek, standing next to her. So I thought she had again\nher malaria attack, yeah. I went over, and went to ask her how she 1s, here was Edek standing,\nshe seemed to me quite normal, so she had no -- no malaria attack, so I didn\u2019t wanted to\ninterfere. He visited her, okay. Why she was in bed, I wi -- don\u2019t know. In any case, I left. An\nhour later, the siren went on. That was the last moment before she escaped, I may have been the\nlast person who ever spoke to her, yeah. Now, s -- they were caught, there are several stories, but\nit is true that she had a malaria attack during her ordeal, and while escaping, and he panicked,\nand went to the village doctor. And that was it.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: So the rest is history.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: What stories do you know?",
        "A: That is true. She had the razor blade from Herta -- Herta Rote, who was another lifer, who\u2019s\ndead by now, and she cut herself.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: She wasn\u2019t hung.",
        "A: No, no. They wanted to hang her, she cut herself. According -- you see, I always avoided\nanything like being present. Everybody had to come and to witness that, the whole camp. And I\nlocked myself up in my drawing office, nobody could see me, that I am there, and I never went\nto the execution, yeah. And so I cannot tell you what really happened, but according to the\nothers, she cut herself, she was supplied by Herta Rote with an razor blade, and Mandel -- see,\naccording to the people, she was hitting Mandel with her bloody hand in her face. Then she was\nordered -- then -- then the Hauptchafuehrer Maul, ordered her to carry her into the crematorium,\nwhere she was shot by him, and that was it. Then the father of the -- Edek was brought in from\nan village, was hanged 1n front of his son, and then he was hanged. So that was an badly planned\nescape. That was selfishness. She put so many people into -- into trouble, and lost her life. And\nshe could have survived easily, like all us, and could have led a normal life. She had an\nboyfriend at home that she abandoned for Edek. I don\u2019t think she was very clever.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: \u00b044.",
        "A: Ah, wait a minute, what are you talking about?",
        "A: Arrive?",
        "A: Ah, \u201940 -- \u00b043. End -- no, end of \u201942.",
        "A: End of \u201942.",
        "A: Escaped, yeah. But I would not like to bring Mala in at all, because everybody writes about\nMala, Mala, so let\u2019s everybody -- I -- I have -- I knew her on the first day she arrived.",
        "A: I spoke to her the last hour before she left, yeah? That is all I rem -- will -- want to remember.",
        "A: A normal girl. Very clever, very shrewd, and s -- again, as they had no Polish Jewish girls in\nthe camp office whatsoever, they had a hard time to help each other to get -- Polish Jewish girls\nhad no good positions because of that. So, there were some work details which were better. For\nexample, the work details, indoor work details, yeah. Pretty good, and [indecipherable] the\nPolish girls could be accommodated. Rosa helped -- tried to help them through me, yeah. She\nmade contact with me, and whenever she needed something, she approached me, and I helped\nher. But sh -- I was never recruited by her for anything else, yeah. We had an entire different\nrelationship. She knows -- she had what she wanted from me, I had what I wanted from her. I --\nShe organized for me all my underpanties, and all the ma -- bowls of -- rolls of material to make,\nquickly, handkerchiefs for your head, to cover when newcomers arrived, especially from my\ncity, in the lase -- late autumn, \u201944. She brought me a lot of material when I could go to the\nbarrack, and supply the people, they never received -- it was cold, [indecipherable]. They never\nreceived any covers, so there where she helped me, and she helped me to steal from the clothing\nbarrack, whatever -- whatever I needed, and I helped her by placing people, whenever she asked\nme. Then, that\u2019s about it.",
        "A: Well, shall I tell you the story?",
        "A: Did I told you the story already?",
        "A: Yeah, she brought me s -- always a custom tailored aprons, of -- so I accepted that, because\nwe were -- that was very fashionable in the camp office, to have over your dress a nice apron,\nyeah.",
        "A: No, no --",
        "A: -- nicely -- nicely tailored.",
        "A: Yeah, they were pretty. I maybe have to make one to sketch how they look like. And from\ntime to time she was coming pretty frequent to exchange, bought me a new one, took the old one.\nAnd I always begged her, I don\u2019t need more aprons, and leave me the one. \u201cNo, I want you to\nhave it.\u201d So, by now I am -- I was -- and later on, when all that happened, I was suspicious if\nthey didn\u2019t -- if she did not use me as an carrier of her -- of her -- of her smuggled stuff, because\nI remember later on that the aprons had one -- were nicely sewn, but at the end, they had\nsomething like that, yeah, two or three seams at -- at the end of the --",
        "A: And it could have been here inside --",
        "A: -- that she\u2019s -- was hiding stuff, because she supplied those I -- aprons to several people who\nwere in high positions, yeah, probably knowing that nobody\u2019s going to -- to check their -- their\nbelongings what they wear. And that\u2019s the way -- I have never spoke to anybody about it, but\nthat must have been the reason, yeah? And among others, she used me, too. So, what can I tell\nyou? Then she collected the apron, and brought me a new one. So she -- I don\u2019t know what -- she\ncollected probably the one which was full of stuff, and brought me one empty. And that\u2019s how\nshe worked, because for what reason she brought me aprons?",
        "A: Can you imagine? Huh? Then I have found an -- a woman, I still have to look for it, in\nAustralia, who brought an story that she had -- she was sewing aprons for -- for -- for Rosa.\nSpecial ones, yeah.",
        "A: When she was captured?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, I was not.",
        "A: I was not, no. I was not. We had -- she was among those people I like, and we had nice chats\ntogether, but she never recruited me, also. She asked me for favors, I asked her for favors, but\nthat was normal business, like to help the people, yeah. And it -- because she has -- I knew that\nthere are no Polish Jewish girls in the camp office, so I gladly helped her out.",
        "A: Because the camp office had a lot of Pole -- Poles, non-Jews. Camp office, and the arbatz\neinsatz, yeah, and the rest were Slovakian girls. We were there before the Poles, before the\nPolish Jews, and the Poles were more or less simultaneously coming with us around the same\ntime. So, we have occupied the good places, while the Poles -- Polish girls had no German\nknowledge, yeah.",
        "A: That was among others there mi [indecipherable] their disadvantage.",
        "A: And that\u2019s about it.",
        "A: There\u2019s no more to add. Everything else is speculation and is blow -- blow -- blown up into\nsomething so that people can write. But Rosa Robbata was an ordinary girl, who just did what\nshe felt is important, and she did it skillfully, and I don\u2019t know how she gots -- how she -- how\nshe was caught.

        "A: I --",
        "A: It\u2019s on her interview, in Polish.",
        "A: Not she thinks, she is sure.",
        "A: I had an daily visitor, and that was a man, an Pole, who was known -- who was the only man\nwho was living in the women\u2019s camp. And his name was En -- Hen -- Henyek Borepsky. Henyek\nBorepsky was the official electrician, who was in charge of checking the wirings, electric wiring,\nall over the whole area. Henyek Borepsky was the one who buried s -- many of the Jewish and\nnon-Jewish reports the people wrote in all their languages, in -- who buried that during our stay\nthere, and then after the war, made it possible to un-bury the stuff. We have more stuff, the\ninformation we had after the war, thanks to him, and due to him. Now, he isn\u2019t -- he isn\u2019t quoted\nin most of the literature by important historians, like Lunkbine mentioned him too, but he is\ndescribed very well in the book by -- called \u201cFighting Auschwitz,\u201d yeah?",
        "A: As he visited me every day, she didn\u2019t know what business he has to do with me, yeah? Who\nam -- what -- otherwise he -- there was no love affair, he was not my boyfriend. He was just\nvisiting me, and she doesn\u2019t know what we -- what business we had to do, except he was the\nrepresentative of the top man, who was leading the Polish underground, yeah? So that why she\nsuspected me, I must have had something to do with them. That\u2019s all. And he asked me for\nhundred thousand things to do for him, and I never have asked any questions, I did it. So, I\nprobably worked for the Polish underground without know -- I knew I worked for somebody, or\nI did things for somebody, but I have not ask any questions. That was an very basic rule, if you\ndo something, either you do it or not, and if you are doing it, don\u2019t ask questions, because what\nyou know -- you should never know, in case you were caught.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Because it was very hard to approach me.",
        "A: For men. So -- you could not enter the camp office just like that, yeah.",
        "A: And -- and you had no -- and people I have not known of through -- even if not talking to\neach other, but there were, in certain jobs established -- for example, I'll give you another\nexample. You know Gerovitch?",
        "A: He was an outsider of everything. He was an Bundist, but there was one leader of the -- of the\nBundists, whom he mentioned in his interview, and that was Nonyek. Nonyek was an French and\nPolish Jew who was coming from France. Later on, he became an medical student, after the war,\nand practiced medicine. But it was Nonyek whom was one day arrived to the camp office,\nstraightforward to me, and said, \u201cSippy, I need the figures of French women, how many arrived\nup til now, and how many are still alive.\u201d Now, I could have told him, \u201cWhy do you ask me, ask\nsomebody else,\u201d yeah? But I had access. He researched me before he came. I had access to\neverything, because I designed the card totake, yeah. So I --",
        "A: The card totake. The types of cardex.",
        "A: I designed it.",

        "A: Cardex.",
        "A: I knew that -- I knew -- they knew that I -- I can have the access to it, because nobody would\nhave questioned me, what are you doing there, right? So, I -- and two minutes later, I was\ncoming with the answer. After all, I had constant reports of certain things, I told you that I did\nthe diagrams and so on, so I didn\u2019t -- I knew exactly w-w-what to look for, and where to look\nfor, and quickly, so that -- because there could have been any time, somebody coming from the\nSS, and so on. But we always had some people out at the door entrance to watch out. In any case,\nNonyek arrived, and asked me for information. He got the information, which he reported\nafterwards, but I couldn\u2019t care less how, and to whom. But I know through Gerovitch now, in his\ninterview, that Nonyek was the leader of the Bund, okay? So that what I\u2019m trying to tell you. I\nhaven\u2019t ask him what do you need that for? When I noticed he was coming with something\nimportant, of question, he got his answer. And that\u2019s how I worked. Whoever was coming with\nimportant questions, he got his [indecipherable] he got the right answer. I don\u2019t know what I did,\nand to whom I was giving, and how much I did, yeah? Or that Henyek, what he have asked me,\nis hard to believe, but that\u2019s an whole story, you have to -- to -- Henyek was always asking me\nimpossible things.",
        "A: To -- to a shell of an watch, yeah. And t-to write down doxsa, that was an trademark. I said,\n\u2018\u201cHenyek, you can get at Canada, as many doxsas you want. Why do you want me to write on\nthat particular watch, which is empty inside, doxsa?\u201d \u201cJust do it.\u201d That what he said. Now, what\nhe did afterwards with that, if they have smuggled something in the container, if that was just to\nrecognize that it is an different doxsa, because my writing and my -- must have been different\nthan the original print. But then, from then on, he was coming with similar mishugas, yeah, to do\nfor him, and I did it. I never asked any questions. But I know that not only that I did something\nvaluable, I have been protected by the Polish underground, just like they protected them --\nthemself, and their agents. That what I know. I really made my office available for their get\ntogether, yeah.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Who?",
        "A: I left the office. At -- I was running all the time around the camp, and [indecipherable]\nthought I\u2019m a runner.",
        "A: Nothing. The first time when they were coming, and all the women from everywhere were\ncoming, the first time in, they said, \u201cSippy, leave us alone.\u201d I did that, and when they co -- were\ncoming afterwards, and I left by myself.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: What can I tell you, in what way. They -- they were watching out I should -- nobody should\ndo any harm to me, yeah. They watched -- look, th-th-that -- they were an very close-knit group\nof Polish officers, and their wives, but I belong -- I was one of them, yeah?",
        "A: Into what?",
        "A: My reputation?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Yeah. Oh, that was different. I tell you. One nice day, Hessler was coming, and said, \u201cSippy,\nwe are going to transfer you, I have now taken over some -- some duties at the onione factory.\u201d I,\nHessler.",
        "A: \u201cAnd we are going to transfer a -- you to the onione as technical draftswoman.\u201d I said, \u201cBut I\nwas not trained as an technical draftswoman. I\u2019m a graphic artist.\u201d He said to me, \u201cThe way how\nI know you, you know everything.\u201d That what Hessler said to me. So, I didn\u2019t know, but Irwin\ntold me afterwards, while we were married, what happened. S -- Hessler was coming, and\nexplained to the civilian engineers there, \u201c\u201cWe are -- we are -- we are going to get now a woman,\na draftswoman. She\u2019s very peculiar, very exact, very moody. Empty fund room for her, bring in\ninstruments, bring in everything. She will be as -- from now on, your draftswoman. And Irwin is\ngoing to supervise her.\u201d",
        "A: I was fighting, hiding behind Katya, and Drexel, that I don\u2019t want to go. And they were\nwinning. I didn\u2019t had to go. And I never arrived to the onione. Good. So he knew that I exist, but\nhe didn\u2019t know that -- who I am, yeah. Just a woman, a draftswoman.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Good. Now -- then Mengele was coming. He wanted me as an draftswoman when he heard\nabout me, as a microscopic draftswoman. There I was fighting again. I am not -- I wasn\u2019t trained\nas an microscopic draftswoman. But we will find for you somebody, and we have found for him\n-- what is her name? That woman who is now fli -- claiming her work?",
        "A: So, that why Irwin knew about me. I stayed at the camp office, and that was it. But we wanted\nto talk about something else. You were just s -- putting in -- in that Irwin business. What was the\nnext question?",
        "A: About what people\u2019s name?",
        "A: Oh. Several -- several things. No people. I have been working for the French Bund, through\nNonyek, and fr -- for the Poles.",
        "A: Oh, right, but that how, yeah?",
        "A: Because that was just an one ti -- time when he was fighting for my transfer --",
        "A: -- but lost, yeah?",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s an funny coincidence. You know, the prostitutes in the onione, who were the\nforeman, some German women, Irwin told me even made fun out of me. They said, \u201cLook, that\nwoman, she makes -- she goes on the -- you -- you know, in German, mangeet umstreesh. If you\nare an prostitute, you are going where the stripe is marked, and that is called -- I don\u2019t know in\nEnglish, if -- if they use the word, the stripe --",
        "A: Yeah. For prostitutes, they -- they are not allowed to cross.",
        "A: But in Germany, it\u2019s a stree -- mangeet umstreesh, yeah? Mangeet umstreesh. Now, I painted\nthe stripes.",
        "A: And then [indecipherable] then she made her numbers, yeah? And th-that was an joke, but it\nwas true. Look, there was humor in Auschwitz, too.",
        "A: Revenge?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. Now, I tell you what we did, and I can tell you that honestly. The book of the\npunishment detail, was kept in the camp office under -- strictly under Katya\u2019s supervision. But,\nas I mentioned before to you, that most book were supplied with plain sheets, only lines, and we\nhad -- I had to put, or designs, or columns necessary for an particular situation, like block books,\nwhere we knew how many columns, and for what. So where the columns established in that br --\npunishment book, where you had the names, numbers, the punishment, the duration from, too,\nyeah? Transferred then and to -- to be released then and then. And if there were some of the\nkapos, or some of the blockelteste, who accidentally, for any reason, had -- have been transferred\nto the punishment block, if they were lousy, bad people, Katya took the liberty to ask me to\nextend the duration, okay? And that was the only way how we could take revenge on those\npeople. Now, that is unofficial, but I\u2019m telling you, that\u2019s what we did. And it was good that we\ncould do it.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: I never menti --",
        "A: -- to whom should I have spoken about it?",
        "A: They?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I told you this?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And?",
        "A: It\u2019s too -- I would have, if you would explain that the way I said it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Find -- find --",
        "A: That\u2019s better.",
        "A: But I have to check my -- my fax.",
        "A: Wait a minute, you have to take that off?",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",
        "A: N-No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Could be. Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, very great.",
        "A: Why do people --",
        "A: -- kill each other? They\u2019re in danger too, to be locked up, and they are doing it. That I cannot\nanswer.",
        "A: Why that Jewish woman was falling in love with an SS man, yeah?",
        "A: Why did she do it? [indecipherable]",
        "A: Balitch.",
        "A: And Katya. Stupid woman.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Everybody was afraid of her because she had such influence on the top management, yeah.",
        "A: Because she was clever. She did a good job, and nobody could fool her, yeah.",
        "A: And her --",
        "A: Fool her.",
        "A: And she -- her job, not only that she helped herself and some fellow inmate, but she pretended\nto help the SS, but she did not, yeah. She was very, very, very skillful, and -- by manipulating the\nwhole business, yeah.",
        "A: Younger.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: One year younger.",
        "A: Wh-When she entered the camp?",
        "A: For -- I was born in 718, and entered \u201942. I was 23 when I entered.",
        "A: She was 22.",
        "A: Uh ha ha.",
        "A: What I said now comes -- now I am getting -- going through the mill --",
        "A: -- like -- like an interrogation, like an judge, or like an prosecutor.",
        "A: You said -- no.",
        "A: I know. Okay.",
        "A: What stopped?",
        "A: Ah, beating, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: A showcase, a showcase,",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t know, because they were not there before, yeah. And they\nhaven\u2019t asked for anything. So they -- they haven\u2019t asked to per -- to perform the beating.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Because that is --",
        "A: -- SS mentality, yeah. That how we deal with our prisoners.",
        "A: Cruelty was -- cruelty was introduced as an -- as an skill, and an so-called science. It was part\nof their daily -- daily routine.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah, uh-huh?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no.",
        "A: [indecipherable] it was part of --",
        "A: They were punishment -- look, there were prisoners who were sent over from prison, or from\nother camps, with an order to receive 25 beats, or 12, or 10.",
        "A: It was part of their -- of their punishment to receive, and they were keeping that for the\nvisitors, to -- to demonstrate how they are doing it, yeah?",
        "A: And that\u2019s gone crazy, and crazy, and there was an doctor present, and when the people\ncollapsed, they were brought to the hospital compound, yeah. And they were mainly non-Jewish\nprisoners.",
        "A: Because they knew where -- ba -- mainly non-Jewish prisoners, because they were coming\nthrough an police station, or through another jail, or through -- or sentenced by an judge to -- to\nreceive the beating, yeah. They were mostly non-Jewish prisoners.",
        "A: No, you could -- it was never an open -- open -- open show. There were always dignitaries\nthere of the camp dignitaries, or -- I was not a camp dignitary, or some SS people.",
        "A: And sometimes the camp dignitaries had to do the beating. And if the beating were not done\nproperly hard, then the same dignitary was put on the -- on the -- that type of tool -- not tool, an\ndesk, or whatever it -- I must show you one day how it looked. And he was beaten, or she was\nbeaten by somebody else. So, it was quite an s -- science, yeah.",
        "A: Oh no.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: It was mainly done inside of an building.",
