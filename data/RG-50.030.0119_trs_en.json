So and, they tried to, illegally, to cross the borders and one of the illegal\npossibilities was also this...this uh...uh border from Moravia and Slovakia, Novi Rozenkov\narea. It was just tightly under on the border. So and this I had the possibility to manipulate in\nthe woods, and I knew this so, so some friends came to me and asked me I should take some\npeople who were very engaged in this and so I brought them to the place that I knew they\nwill be brought to, through their borders illegally.",
        "Q: How did you that?",

Also when\nthe German came, immediately, so they were interested in factories running, yes. They get,\nthey get lumber, they get uh materials. And so these people had also some legitimate\ninformation. They are buying the woods, and so I can, I cut with them through the woods.\nAnd uh, then I give them to other people who had, who can go across. And so it succeeded\nuh several times. But then one of these groups was catched from the Slovaks, on the Slovak\nborder, and they were given to the Gestapo, and so also my name appeared in that and so I\nwas involved and it was...",
        "Q: What happened to you at that point?",

And we were arrested in the local uh\narrest of the Czech police and it was not at war. So we also were put the for trial for the\nCzech uh uh courts, yes. And uh, this still was, they must prove to you and so on and so. But\nnevertheless, the German took us away to the Spielburg barrack (ph) of the Gestapo prison\nand they in the first, it was I think it was in July, and when I came to this place, to this\nGestapo place named Spielburg (ph), so the uh there were orders under the SS and they were\nvery young SS men, and they tortured the people and in this one-half day I was tortured so\nmuch that in the whole five years later I didn't experience such a torturing like this. This half-\nday review. Are you interested in the details?",
        "Q: If you can.",
        "A: So they put us on the wall, yes, what twenty, thirty uh prisoners. Before we were accepted\nthrough all these procedures, and the SS mem came around and always they give us a kick,\nand once the SS man took my head and kick me against the wall. And then the blood came\nfrom the nose, yes. The SS man told, look the Jews, dirty Jews what did you . You\nare a swine. Lick. You also lick it, to lick the blood. I refused. I refused so he beat me. And I\nstill refused. So he took another and told, look we will give you some sport, some training,\nyes and they took me in this cellar of the old fortress Spilberg (ph). There was some I don't\nknow, uh, there was, anyway, when you are going up, stairs. And the stairs are creeking (ph)\nwith mud and so, and one SS man stood up and the other SS man followed us underneath the\nstairs and he asked me I should like a snake, I should creep (ph), you know like a snake to\nthese, on the stairs. And he beat me with this roll (ph) and so when I came to the top, so the\nSS man was at the top, he hit bucket of water, yes, and he took the water against me, so I\ngliched (ph) on this and so I make it two or three times, till I couldn't walk. Then they took\nme up to their room where they are making guards, and they gave me two bucket of water. I\nshould uh I should keep them, and they was very heavy, and they took cigarettes and they\nmake the cigaretttes extinguish on my breasts, yes, and so I cried and I, I fell and I lost my\nconscious.

And soon and then they poured on me water like when they come to me they\nput me on a cot (ph) a huge book (ph) of marmalade (ph) and they\nbeat on this thing, on this thing, and it was a noise, a noise that I thought I will be crazy. And\nthen I still left, uh, lost my conscious, and they still put water on me, and then they told me,\nnow you dirty Jew, so you must wash yourself, you are dirty as a Jew. And so they\ndessimated me. I didn't know what happened with me. I was like , like a berifted (ph). And\nwhen I washed myself, and from the hairs it was dirty, with this, with this marmalade. So\nthey told me now we will go to the reception. In the beginning they may have guards very\nexactly it was 39. What will you do when they are asking you what they you are black. I had\nsome blue on my, yes, so I wouldn't, I didn't understand that. So they told me, you will say\n. If you are asked what did you fall, yes, did you fall, ;\nrepeat it. Then I came to this reception room, office, the SS men, and some prisoners and\nthey took me there and they asked me for the card and then they asked me wherefore you\nhave this black uh, this black spots. I told them, . So they laughed. . Then\nthey take me to this, to the great prison cell that was about twenty, thirty prisoners, and they\ntold me they they had some of them also had similar experience. And the next morning, we\ncame for a doctor; yes, we should be checked up, and how we are healthy and so. And so we\nstand naked, and the nurse, which was a prisoner doctor, look at me, and he told me, look,\nyou have here something, hernia, you know what is. But I had it never, so I didn't knew what\nit is. And he touched it here and it took uh pain. Yes. I told him what happened, how from\nyou have it, and so I told him. And I told all, tell it to the doctor, yes. I have, I didn't\nundertstand what he mean. I came for a German doctor, yes, a young German doctor, and so\nI, you there, he told me, Jew, and so are you healthy and so. And I told yes, I had hernia.\n\"Where from you have it?\" So I told the , , you know, the guards make me with a\nstrong sport, yes, exercise. And he called . What, the guard. Call\nthe guard. He was crying, he was very upset. Then they came, these two SS men that made\nwith me this spot, you know, and he told, look, this Jew is complaining that you make this\nthing yesterday, this uh strong exercise, and he got this hernia And they go, what, believe\nthis Jew and they give me a kick, they give me a slip, and I was lying on the, on the ground,\nthey standing in fron of me. And told, it seems that you didn't get, you didn't understand, it 1s,\nyou hurt it already, you are lying, Jews always lie, and you hurt it already, and yes, I am the\nwitness. And so they were standing in front of me and I saw them and the doctor was\nlaughing with hands, and then so I saw what can I do. So he asked me what therefore, so I\ntold yes, I was lying and so are the Jews. Otherwise they would bring me once. He told me\nlook this, if you are released maybe you can bear it on your own cost, and so on. And so I,\nbut at this time my wife, I could write yes her. And so I write her a letter and she had an\nadvocate, and also the firm you know that I was occupied, where I was, I had a good\nposition, they need an explanation, an explanation of how their deliveries (ph) were and so\non, and they didn't prove that I am guilty. So they have no proof, only the uh telling this. So I\nwas released for the operation. Yes, my wife and the, it came, this lawyer came and spoke\nwith me also with this doctor. And the operation, and they released me in August under the\ncondition that I am under supervision of uh Gestapo and then I came to this firm and I give\nexplanation and I was operated. They operated me and after the operation I was from Vsetin,\nI was...I couldn't leave there. They... I could live only in the village, in the village near Vsetin\nabout twenty kilometers where my wife also lived with me and I could work only as a\nworker--manual work, yes. And so I worked, and I must always...every week I must give a\nreport to the Gendarmerie state police station that I am here where I was. But after a year,\nthey came and arrested me. Yes. They arrested me. It's true. I still kept some connection with\nthe underground.",
        "Q: Talk about it.",
        "A: Yes. But I still kept, I don't know, somebody had complained, but after a year they came to\nthis, to my flat in this Novi Rozenkov, the village and they arrested me and I, and also my\nbrother-in-law Milan Kulka. And then I went, I came to Dachau, as a preventive, a\npreventive custody. They told if I would be released I am a danger, I endanger the\nrevolution, the peaceful revolution of the German and so, so it was only an excuse. And so, I\nwas so-called a political prisoner. But I was still a Jew, yes. But it keep their rolls something,\nthere was some political reasons, I still had the file at the court, yes, and they still, the court\nwas interested where I am for the case, if 1t would be involved some more people who I was\ninvolved in this action, so they still would have contact for the prisoner, even if they were\nJews who they arrested. It was the action of the political prison for political reason as\nopposed to the mass, mass deportations and so. So this is only that you see then I had a good\ntraining for this, all this. How it was, and also I had this connections, you know, also when I\ncame to Dachau. There was also some people who were already there, and they had\nconnections to the underground, yes, to the communists, and so and I always find these\nconnections. Yes, I could find always these, and this helped me a lot of this.",
        "Q: Describe Dachau, please. And describe how you got these connections, what you did with\nthem.",
        "A: Oh yes. The connections helped me. So first, I was, the second time I was, before I came to\nDachau, I was in the prison, Gestapo prison, in the Kavnitzovi Koleie (ph), in Brno, the\ncapital of Moravia. Yes. Kaunitzovi Koleie (ph) means the communist college. It was a\ncollege for the students and they transformed it into a Gestapo prison. Yes. And we came\nthis, there were mainly a communist uh, they try it, the whole communist net to developp\nand they told some Jews about it and Jews that we should have their service, of you know, to\nclean, and to get to this good food. Yes, under the supervision of the SS men. And so we also\nhad also to clean and there many offices of the SS interrogation officers. And we have to\nclean in the morning this, and they had a radio there yes. So it was not there, so we listened\nto the radio what are the, the news, and so we have had what is the development in the war,\nyes in the beginning - how it would development (ph). And we would have BBC\nyes. For instance, they also had BCC. And when in the morning, at 6 o'clock there was\nnobody in the office, yes, so we took and there was also a hospital in this, which the\nprisoners were brought in the hospital because they beat the prisoners and they were not in a\nstage to be interrogated so a prison hospital. How's that? And there was a doctor Primar\nHorn (ph) from Nihlava (ph), and I told him all these messages which we had from this\nradio, yes, and he was interested I should tell him always, we knew when the prisoners came,\nthe new prisoners, so the SS men told you will take these prisoners to, to a cell and we\nbrought them their food but 1t was always in the, we were guarded when we did by an SS\nman. Whenever, as we could, always a few words mentioned to this. And so, one...\nQ. Back up a second. The doctor was part of the resistance?",
        "A: Yes, yes. The doctor was part of the resistance, but he was also the prisoner doctor.",
        "Q: He was a prisoner doctor?",
        "A: A prisoner doctor, yes, but he was a part of that, and so once came a prisoner named\nAndrusek from Dachau, yes. From Dachau. And he was a very, he was very stout, looked\nvery good, yes, and uh I was also we were for the disposition of SS men if they needed me to\nclean their boots and to clean something they need. And I have had when they, in the door,\nthey ask him how that you are looking so well, to these prisoners. And he told, look, when I\nam, uh, I comprehend when I have, understand the Furher's, so I am\nalso look good for a prisoner. Yes, I am, I make a good . And when this, so I\nthought that this a spy yes, but when he came out so the SS officer told to the others, look,\nthere is a prisoner - 1t is not so bad in Dachau. Look this prisoner should tell to the SS how\nhe, it's good when they are pursuing the orders of the SS. And the name, I remember the\nname Andrusek and I told this name to this doctor who was in the resistance, and when he, it\nwas like he was electrified. Andrusek, look Andrusek must first come to the Revier uh, this\nhospital here before he is interrogated. It 1s very important for us. So he asked me that I\nshould give him an ampoule (ph), you know, in the bread, when we were distributing the\nbread, and so I do and look we will get ample, take it. There is, uh, and I told him the name,\nand he got fever, yes, he got fever, so he was given to this, he was taken , they put on the\ndoors that he is ill, and they measured him the fever and they took him to this hospital to the\ndoctor who was in the resistance to the Horn. And they instructed him more what he should\ndo, and so on yes. They instructed him before he was here. Yes, he came from Dachau, but\nhe was involved in this communist net. So later, when he was a prisoner, I asked him how,\nwhat are you doing and he told, look, I am also in hospital in Dachau where so, I mean he\nwas a prisoner, but he was a nurse in Dachau hospital, in the concentration camp, yes. And\nhe was involved in these communist activities so they took him away and asked the Gestapo\nthat they should have an interrogation and they should uh, they thought they will get from\nhim more information about the net of the communists. And he told me, and in the time I\nalready signed the to Dachau, that means they gave me the for\nDachau, so I asked him what I should do when I came to Dachau. And he gave me address\nof the, some man, who later became a Minister of Interior in the\nCzecholovia government. And he was a person in this, in this, and he was a scriber, you\nknow, a clerk, as a prisoner he was in charge of this administrative work, in the,\nadministrative, in this prison, in this prison hospital. And so when I came there so I told him\nand he was interested how and so on and he gave me aid, what should I do\nwhen, when it came the transport. He told me, look, you will\n. Yes, will you, no. So in Dachau, the truth in my time when\nit was 1940, it was in the autumn 1940, so when we came in Dachau, all the Jews came out\nin this company, penal squad, Jews, in the penal uh, uh, penal squad, there was a\nspecial penal barrack, uh, penalty...",
        "Q: Oh, penalty.",
        "A: ..a penalty company for Jews. All the Jews are marked in the penalty sign--a red uh...uh\nopposite of their...of their Jewish David Star. They got a...",
        "Q: It was a badge?",
        "A: A black badge, and they came to this penalty block. There were about two hundred Jews.\nYes, and the penalty block was, there, it was a special, very cruel block master\n(ph), a non-Jew, a communist. But he was a sadist. He was already since\n1935 in the camp, and they killed what you will hardly believe your, now with cleanness\n(ph) in the, with tidyness, with cleanness they killed the people.",
        "Q: Explain.",
        "A: I explain. The block was very nice, yes. There was about, there was divided in two parts, a\nliving room and a bedroom, yes. The living room had, the floors were lacked (ph), you\nknow, lacquer. Yes. There were water closets, and these uh, tables, and\nthe people, every man has a very small cart, yes, if he must get his raiments, yes, his clothes,\nand we had a nerostar (ph), fork, knife and spoon, and even if we eat in this block in the\nevening and the morning, so we must took all these three nerostar (ph) (utensils), yes,\nutensils, and in five minutes it must be clean and given back in this spint (ph). And they\nwas the service of the, who helped the block master (ph) they help, yes,\nthey are prisoners. And if they found something tiny which not so advanced (ph), he got\nsome penalty. Either he didn't get much food, or he must kneel (ph) or he has penalty work\nand so on. This is one. Secondly, there was the most . We were going in this\nroom, this uh schlaf (ph) room, the night when we were. . No, there was a day room and a\nbed, night room. Yes, we had such and so, yes, yes, we get such a\nand we must slept there with the . . and the beds were very nice. The blanket military is. But\nwhat was the, we couldn't even the cleanness was so that we couldn't enter the block in our\nshoes, boots or sandals. That was very, the shoe were, the boots were very different, very -\nwe only could in the scarbats (ph) come, that the lacquered floor will not be spoiled, yes.\nAnd once, and before the block there are and the shoes were\nput in, yes, and so everybody had put their shoes in, and when he was going from the block\nhe was uh, took the boots outside of the block. And then in the midnight once, it, the stubnitz\n(ph) took their whistles and Juden , you make it dirty and now it will be\nmade sport (ph). And they beat us and when we to the court, and the court was full of mud,\nand in the panic in the house, that nobody could took exactly his shoes from this\n, So some took uh wrong shoes, some didn't took any shoe, and now they\nmake sport. Neither of these , you know, different to, like a\nsnake...now then, the beat us. (The policemen beat you?) Yes, the prisoners,\nthe prisoners beat us. (The prisoners beat you?) Yes, the prisoners were creatures (ph), yes,\nand the SS men looked, and once he come, look, back in the blocks. So back in the blocks,\nthe were dirty from this mud and the shoes we put in this, in this\n. And some we were dirty. So he took, you must make it clean, half an hour,\nall must be cleaned. And so we go in this washroom, and where the clothes and water was,\nyes, to make us clean, and also the, the __, the uh floor, yes. But then they listed us and\nchecked the, who was clean and can go in this, to sleep in his bed. And the blockeldester\n(ph) looked and counted (ph) and then if he noticed that there 1s some dirty on there still on\nthe floor, up and to lick, lick, yes. And he (to lick it), to lick the dirt, you know, this. There is\nsomebody would not, so he, he put him to the floor, he stayed him here with his foot, and he\nmake it so long as he didn't comprehend and somewhere that, and were brought to the\n_____ house, yes. So, by the cleanness they took us, they killed the people. And on the day we\nshould work so the work was useless. We should put the stones from one heap to another.\nWe should snow (ph) in our mountains from one heap to another. It was a chain. And the\nkapos beat us, yes. So always there were two, three killed or were wounded to brought to the\ninfirmary, so this was the Dachau. And so, I was there about a half a year and I told it to the\nSkopsiva who was on this infirmary in this prison, this infirmary, and he told me look, you\nshould, when there will be a first transport, you should, should ask that you should be sent\nfor a transport. And uh, there was a transport from Neuengamme, yes. And so we came to\nNeuengamme.",
        "Q: Describe the trip, would you please?",
        "A: Yes. So we were already, in Dachau we formed about a group of five friends from\nCzechlosavakia. The names you are interested. Yes, the names are Otto Kraus (ph), the\nformer coauthor of my books; my brother-in-law, Milan Kulka-- brother of my wife, or first\nwife; and Ernst Schon--he was my far cousin from Verski Brod (ph); Aaron Rosenfeld (ph).\nThat was that. And so we were four. This such a group, and I was five. And we always help\neach other, yes, in these different situations. And so we came to this camp, Hamburg\nNeuengamme. This was an . It was the out building camp, yes. They\nreally needed very hard work. Yes. They didn't beat. If you could work, they let you early\nalive. But if you couldn't, so they put you in the hospital and either you cured or you died.\nYes, so it was, but when we came to this camp there was opposite to Dachau. There was\nnothing there. We had no beds. We lie on this straw. There was no floor. The floor was only\nthe mud, yes, the pressed mud, yes. And we lie on this straw and when we were going a\ncommando, especially Jews, they were commando (ph) Elbe. It means it was a\nElbe , a river, a huge river which was coming from Czechoslovakia to in the\nmountains of Bohemia, and it is is going to the sea in Hamburg. And there were several\nbranches of this Elbe and one of these rivers were full of mud. Was made to be, to carry the\nboats, you know, to clean it. And so we were about command of more than thousand, mainly\nJews, who were going every day, maybe two or three kilometers far from this Hamburg\nNeuengamme, from this camp, to the place where we make this, to clean this from mud, this\nElbe canal, this channel. They would make a channel. They were building a huge fabrik\n[Ger: factory] of bricks. And they should, the bricks should be on the , on the\nwaterway brought over. And there were different, first there were some canes (ph) your\nknow, canes, some small ships, you know, when the barges brought the mud on this canes\n(ph) this small ship, small boat, yes. The boats are full of this mud, and we had, like in the\nancient time, there were planks we had with the ships that brought this mud from the canes\nto the . Yes, they were very deep, the canes, these boats were deep. And on the\nopen, the boats were, were planks, very strong planks, and their carts, and on these carts, this\nmud which we brought when the ship, when the shoals (ph), on the shoals, it was on two\nrivers, yes, we were only half standing in mud. And they brough with these carts, this uh\nmud to the shore, yes, and it was long, very long, and from this shore, there were make an\nelipse (ph), maybe of one kilometer, an elipse (ph) route with planks of about 30 centimeters,\nyou know just about 50 centimeters, five centimeter high and 30 centimeters wide and it was\nmake an elipse road. And on this elipse road, yes, they make, they put about three hundred,\nthree hundred uh prisoners with carts, hand carts, yes. And when, when this mud was put on\nmaybe 50 meters long and about 3 meters high, and they in running they were going and\nthere must be loaded the full cart, all the prisoners loaded their cart, and they were going on\nthis, on this road which were, the purpose of this was that there were gardens, and uh fields,\nand they make the fields should bring this very fruitful, uh fruitful mud of Elbe yes, they\nshould be more fruitful their gardens and their fields. They should be better food then.",
        "Q: Was this mud from the Elbe that they had brought up?",
        "A: Yes, brought it up. And it was in there riding, you must keep up this, the cart, yes. And\nrunning for another. And so it was, it was just a circle of death. Yes. Todes Runde (ph) And\nso the only, the only uh rest was when somebody couldn't and he collapsed. That you\ncouldn't go, only you could keep the cart on this 30 centimeter wide plank road. So he\ncollapsed. And when he collapsed, so the whole road collapsed, couldn't go. So the kappos\ncame and they beat this man who collapsed. You will go or not go, and so maybe he make\nsome two or three rounds and he collapse and there were every day twenty, thirty dead\nwhich we brought in the camp exhausted, yes, from this. So our group of five we survived in\nthis way - that the possibility of us if you could read the shower to give the\nroad to the carts, to run the carts it was very exhausting, it was very hard that somebody\ncould keep it without uh rest. So we always could uh changed. The kappos allowed that if\nsomebody of our five, un voluntarily he told I will give up my place in the\nshovel (ph) to this man with the cart. And so we could give it up. Do you understand?",
        "Q: Yes, so by changing with the in the carts you",
        "A: So, and so we could survive, yes. But later it was very hard and my brother-in-law, he\ncollapsed and he came to the infirmary and he was, he caught the dysentary and he died. He\ndied in September 1941, yes. Yes. And later I also get uh, poison, blood poison, from this\ndirty mud, and I had uh, , blood poison, so I still have a sign here. And they would\namputate my leg. But still I have a connection with this, from this infirmary, of a nurse who\nwas connected with the Skopsiva, knew him. And uh, I told him that going, he make me, he\ngave me something that a hole which was put in this. It came out and I was\ncured. And then after somebody was cured, so he got as they needed to the working power,\nyes, So also to Jews they give a to spare him a little. , 1t meant, it should\nbe spared it should be easier work. But for Jews the easier work that you must, uh\nbeat the stones, to small pieces, to silt (ph), but, and in every weather, it 1s raining and not\nraining, it was for Jews. But, luckily, as my name was Erich Schon at the time, so they told\nthat I am a German, so they give me the work for non-Jews from German. And it was the\nyou know, to repair the socks for SS men. It was a hugeh and so I got this\nwork and in two months I could restore my health. And, but, and then it came, there came\nUkrainians (ph) like in Poland, and so on, and this old guard ought to be changed. Yes,\nand the Russians and the prisoners of\nwar and so. And so our group get the better work, yes. And I also can, yes I had to do with\nwood, so I told them, carpenter, so I could help by the building of a bunker and later I get\nthe, they built a factory, they built near the camp they built a new camp. And they kept the\nmarket(ph) at as a prisoners war camp. Yes. And there were the same\nbarrack, and firms which were in Hamburg brought their machinery inside and they\nused the prisoners that they work on the machinery that they make for uh the U-boats, you\nknow, under the boats. Some machinery. And for Jews it was not, Jews, only non-Jews. But\nlater when they still needed us, and under the surveillance of you know of\n, the military in Germany. But still we came, we were in the uh direction of\nthe SS only by night, but on the day we were in this factory which was nearby. And the\nGermans, they were, they were interested in work, in really work. And so they couldn't beat\nus, yes. When they would have, and so I learned some skill in this. And later 1t came, I was\nthere still till the end of October, 1t came an order from Himmler, you know, the boss of the\nSS, that all the Jews should be concentrated in Auschwitz, from all the camps. And so it\ncome the order also to Neuengamme and so they have bought the Wehrmacht, not these five\nJews, we have all five, they are specialists, I will not give them up, give them free, only\nwhen I get uh specialists uh specialists which have the same qualifications as\nthis, as we were. Yes. But he told it an order from Wermacht and so Litkmayer (ph) in\ncharge of the SS men, SS men at Lagerfield (ph), he was very furious, but later he brought\nfrom Auschwitz five non-Jewish uh locksmiths or some that were in, and we were\nexchanged. He told, now you have uh, your some faharbeiter (ph), you experts in this, and he\ngave us free. And so we came to Auschwitz. We were five. Yes, we came to, in Auschwitz,\nthey told us you are very important people and you will get built your own house in the east\nand so they brought us with a special train, with two SS men in guard, in the depart we were\nonly five. ( in a special train ?). No. In a personal (ph) train. Look, first we got all\nour civilian clothes, my watch I got, and all we get, and we were still political prisoners so\nwe didn't and then we have a code message with the resistance and so on, and\nand they give us also food and a special SS man came and brought us in the department of\nthis speed train. And so, he told us, and we believe it, look you are going to the east. There is\na special uh, uh, a special uh building for Jews, where they will live, and you are\nspecialists, so you will have a very good life, and he showed us a uh, card\nfor the important of the transport of these special prisoners, it is necessary to use this speed\ntrain. And we were in the department, a special department, we have this un, and\nthere was an SS man with, and uh, uh, at the door, and the SS man ordered, the officer, not\nthe officer felt we were surgeons (ph), and they were seated opposite us and they were nice\nto us and we believed him and told him, look we will be nice so if you promise me you will\nnot make some attempts to escape so I will take off your handcuffs and so he brought us to\nBerlin and he gave us car fare and we came to an other train, and we came to Auschwitz.\nFive. In Auschwitz, if the people, the prisoners from Auschwitz they talk to us. In\nAuschwitz , SO they are killing the Jews by gas.",
        "Q: When did you hear this?",
        "A: It was in uh '42, in autumn, uh, I think in September. But I couldn't understand this. What\n. Yes. I couldn't imagine how they are killing the Jews by gas. But I experience\nsomething in Neuengamme. In Neuengamme, especially the Russian and the Ukranian who\ndidn't understand any German, so when they were ill, so they came to the infirmary, when\nthey were healthy, and they were warned. They should not go. But they, they, they believed\nyes, it is infirmary, it is very good. So when they have fever, very high fever, and they were\nsuspicious of typhoid, so they make them with ink pen number here or\nhere, and give them injection in the heart and they were immediately dead and they, the\ncorpses they laid them in uh mortuary. This we knew, yes. That but otherwise in\n- there were some numbered prisoners, with numbers and this we experienced.\nSo when we came to this Auschwitz, so first, we felt the smell, and we told, ah, this is the\nsoot from mines maybe, so what the rumor. And then they give us to another SS man, |\nthen they beat us in and we must, were running about two or\nthree, in the camp, Auschwitz main camp. And we, so hugh camp, with these hundreds and\nhundreds of lights of electric bulbs on this wire, on this barbed wire fences. It was night, yes\nwhen we came to this camp, to this Auschwitz, and uh, it was early of the hours after the,\nthey put us in the cellar, yes, in the night where we slept. And in the even, in the morning,\nthey came, they came, the Polish prisoners, to us and they wondered where from you came,\nonly a group of five, who are you. And so they were interested in us. And so when they saw\nthat we have all this stuff, they told, look, give me this stuff, and I will give it to camp. They\nwill take it anyway from you and if you will give it to me I will give it to the camp and you\nwill get some food. You will see how nice they will be to you. So mostly, and I have golden\nOmega watch, and they give also to me, and I had this Omega watch, give to somebody the\nwatch, I will give it to and you will get bread and so. So I didn't know what to do.\nThey were very friendly. They were prisoners as we were but all prisoners in form. The next\nmorning we are claiming (ph) to be accepted by SS, yes, to make the who we\nare and so. And there are SS men. And this prisoners, these Polish which were visiting us in\nthis cellar, they were with him. They belonged to this squad, so-called Politische Sheiber\n(ph). They were helping to introduce to making to work, you know all these forms to fill out,\nwho you are, what you are and they were .",
        "Q: They were collaborating with them?",
        "A: No. They were 1n his command, and he was the boss of them. And so when I came to this, so\nhe had the list also from uh which were probably all the belongings which. And he\nwrote where have you got the watch. I told him I lost it. What, you lost it. And they gave me\na slip. And so I saw this man who was, who was behind him uh took this watch from me and\nhe make so therefore I told. And when he slapped me, so I told him, look this man\nasked me for the watch, I give him. What . Yes on the order , yes, yes, he\ntook. So he told something to the SS man. Maybe he will give it to him, and it was O.K. And\nso it was. And now we were stripped naked, I will remember how it was in the prisoners.\nThis was my experience. And then, we had some, in Hamburg we could have got in one\nmonth about twenty marcs, yes, from how much from friends. There was a kantin (ph),\nmarks, German mark.",
        "Q: Where did you get them?",
        "A: From, from my sister. At that time my wife still was in, in Rozenkow and my sister-\nin-law was also there. We could write. From this camp we could write, yes.",
        "Q: And you could get money by mail?",
        "A: By mail, not directly. Jews couldn't. But there were non-Jews who had no money. So they\nwrote to their people, look, make contact with this and this, and my wife and sister-in-law\ngave the money to these non-Jews and they sent, and were delighted when they get forty\nmarks, twenty, yes. And so these twenty marks I still spent, but I gave it to the I\npick it on my . And so others had it in their toothpaste. But they took all away, but this\nthey didn't discover, that I have. And so I came the first of this group, for under the shower\nand there was a man who took my hand and tattooed a number. . Yes,\nthis, and I took this number.",
        "Q: O.K. Can you hold it right there? Can you bring the camera in to see the number.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Donny, tell me when you have it.",
        "A: Yes, and so in this moment, I thought, it came that I will be killed injection, the final\ninjection in my heart and I will be dead. As this I experience in Neuengamme, how they do\nit. Yes. And so, uh, no, it had nothing order came, also this number and so on and we came\non a block in the Auschwitz main camp when we were uh, vetoed (ph) to these people,\nPolish people, look, you took from us away these things, and we are old prisoners, so you\ncannot handle us as we are so low in camp. And he told, what three years, there are seven\nyears camp and in fourteen days they were away . Yes, they killed\nthem. Yes. After seven years, the, you were three. So we came on the block when we were,\nah, I forgot to tell you one thing. In this, Neuengamme in this factory where we worked for\nthe, there was also Jew, a German Jew who was a black-yellow, it was asocial worker,\nasocial element. We were told that he was rassenshender (ph). He was arrested for to have\nconnections with the Aryan women, yes. But he was arrested also since 1935 in the\nHe was very old hefling and he was in connection with the\n. The Germans who were in the prisons, they took him on the camp as\nfrom the profession, criminal profession. They had green winkle, green triangle, yes.\nBut this, the Germans, the SS used them to bring in the camp, and they had the great\npositions, blockaltester, lageraltester . They were the bosses. They were prisoners, but the\nbosses, yes.",
        "Q: Let's hold it there. We are going to change the tape and then we will pick up with the story.",
        "A: Yes\nTAPE #2",
        "Q: ..... Sympathy",
        "A: No. I am telling you that you, I didn't wrote it in the books so detailed, yes, but I now, when I\nmake some lectures, so I know how the people ask for details, so therefore I will explain it\nto you. Many people ask me, how did you survive?",
        "Q: That is the big question.",
        "A: Yes, and this was this moment for survivers, yes, this Willie, this , this\nWilly Nahman (ph). It was a lot for us, yes, this Willy Nahman (ph).",
        "Q: Alright, if you. Alright, why don't you hold on. Let's give them a minute to pipe in the air\nconditioning, and then they going to have to turn it off, because it shows on the camera, on\nthe soundtrack. O.K. Say the name again on the tape, when we get to the tape a little slower.",
        "A: O.K.",
        "Q: O.K. The story from the man at Neuengamme , his name was?",
        "A: His name was Willy Nahman. He was from I remember from Hamburg. He was uh, the age\nof 30, but he was arrested already, he was a German Jew, and he was arrested in 1945, first\nin Dachau and then in Neuengamme and then in Sachsenhausen. Sachsenhausen was another\nconcentration camp. And he was connected with the groups of. .",
        "Q: Oh, excuse me, you mean he was arrested in 1935?",
        "A: 35, 1935, he was a German, yes. And he was arrested in a group of , It means the\ncriminals, yes, in Hamburg. And they cooperated together. For them it was not important\nthey were Jews or non-Jews. They get together, work extremely hard. And he was involved\nin this uh, activities of these criminals, and they were friends, very close friends, before and\nalso in the camp. But then they divided the Jews, as Willy Nahman was a Jew and sent him\nto uh, to Neuengamme and later to Auschwitz. But as a prisoner, for this also, later these\ncriminals from Hamburg, from Sachsenhausen, about thirty of these criminals, they had\nchoose them, and brought them to Auschwitz, and make of them kappos and the\nblockeldester. You know, the bosses of the, which helped. And so when we came on this\nblock, and Willy Nahman with us, he was also, he took a number I know, 720777, yes 47, 47\nwas his number. He had, we were given the numbers, I still remember exactly. And so we,\nwe were on this block and on this there block some new prisoners coming to the deportees\nfrom Belgium, I remember. And these were all prisoners. The blockaltester told you will\ntrain these new prisoners in how they should mitseup, mitseup (ph), how they should keep\nthe discipline in the camp. And you will get a little, a bit more of their soup for this trip (ph).\nAnd when we are train, this soldier blockr master (ph) came, you know, the boss who was\nand he saw the Willy the Nahman, oh , you old friend, you\nare here, how are you, and he told, he uh booked (ph) him and kissed him and they were\nfriends, and yes. And Willy go, look, this , look the Poles they are bad to us, they beat\nus, they, uh, they get the property from us, the Poles yes, the Polacks. They were all against\nthe Poles. They were not very accepted from the Germans you know. And so he told no,\nlook, so I will give you the best of beds, yes, do us and you will get food and so. And so, we\nwere, that was the first step. And now we were on the second floor. You know there are\nthree bunks all there. And we were on the third, and now we on the first row, and we saw\nhow the stubnitz you know what is a stubnitz. These were the aids of the blockaltester the\nprisoners who prepared the food, who they kept for cleanness, who punished, yes, who were\nvery severe to the, and they were aid of the - there were about four or five these prisoners,\nstubnitz. It 1s the aids. They were prisoners, but were the aids of the blockaltester and they\ndid what he would. So we knew that always when they were prepared the food for them, so\nthey cut a little of bread, they cut a little of margarine, they cut a little of marmalade, yes.\nAnd they give smaller portions to the, and what they make they organized for the\nblockaltester vodka, spirits, liquers, and sausages and so. And they brought him, uh, he had\nhis own uh room in the block, yes. And they brought him always, he got the full, a good\nsupper and all. So they take care. And he didn't care what they are doing with these\nprisoners, if they gave them the full portions, you know, the full rations or not. And we saw\nit from the, although we knew this practice already from Neuengamme, and we were curious\nif they will also steal it for us, for our rations. And we, they manipulated it and they brought\nuh, you know, they have that butter toast they make, chips of the margarine which they stole,\nand they make this chips for the block master (ph) and they eat and they also give to the\nblockaltester yes, the sausage. And we told them, and we saw they didn't stop before on the\nrations for us, they also kept. So we told them, look, it's not true. We are all heflings , and so\nwe, you should not betray us. Yes. Oh, you are Jews. So they were very harsh to us, and very\nbad. And so, they give us a very hard work - we should take from the kitchen, you know,\nthese kettles that are very heavy, and we should brought these kettles of soup to the block.\nYes, it was very heavy, and we should get them a little soup more. And we saw how they are\nare handle and smuggle these spirits and all these things and from the\nwe observed. And so when we were going to this uh and brought these very heavy trunks\n(ph), with these kettles yes, it was 200 liters, so once there was a lageraltester, you know,\nlageraltester , was the boss of the whole camp, the prisoner boss, and he also was a criminal\nand really was going and he was, he Willy let fall these trunks, and he yes, and\nthey meeted them, and they were friends, and he asked him, look what is, what is, how are\nyou and so on. He told look these boys they are betraying us and they are cutting off this and\nthis and this. He told this and there, when he told, and they are handling spirits. (Spirit is\nliquor.) Liquor. Oh, when he said liquor, what, liquor, where is it. Yes. (Laughter) And he\ncame with two SS men on this, in this project (ph), and they have this liquor, two or three,\nand they really brouhgt them, and they took and they immediately they changed this stubnitz\n(ph) to the penalty company. This Polish. And we should be on there, on there, we were\nreplaced. (You were replaced.) Yes, but this was the career (ph) but the blockaltester didn't\nlike it also and the, we told him, look, we will get your food, your food-vodka or don't care.\nHe shoot him. But that was break through in the Polish heirarchy, and the Poles are very\nangry. The other Poles, you know, very angry that we got such a protection from the\nlageraltester and so on. And so we were in danger. Our blockaltester as well. So he told us,\nlook, there is a camp in Birkenau, it is a nice camp, a new camp, and they are needing for\nslosher (ph) and you are blacksmiths, and so you are in and this is a fantastic\ncamp and there is lying, the money and gold (ph) and money and milk on the street. So he\nwas, but he told the truth. And so we told no, what can we do. And he signed us for the\nBirkenau, all five. And one day there came an assessment at Birkenau, was about three\nkilometers, two miles away from Auschwitz. And we came, the SS men came for us and we\nwas going on that card (ph) of assessment, and first time we saw what he meant. First the\nprisoners, female prisoners, their head was shaved and they looked awful. And when we saw\nthe presence of the hats right, that we should not see them. But we saw them. We were\nshocked. When we saw the first time prisoners, the women prisoners there. In a, a,\n, you know, a situation that we never thought in such an illumining (ph), such a\ndegree. And then we came to this camp and we saw there, there were on the side of the\nstreets, there were great crocks, they were filled with milk, filled with meat, and uh\nand some . SO we saw it, what it is. And then we came to this\ncamp, this Birkenau camp, that was full of mud, yes. There were lying corpses, yes, and we\ncame to a block a nice wood block, and to a Polish blockaltester who this 1s nice, very block,\nand we always thought transport came, and they were gassing people and so were there in\nBrzezinka (ph). There were nothing in this camp. At that time, was no, there\nwere bunkers for the uh camp people that was adapted from a farm house, these two bunkers,\nyes. Behind the camp in the woods, Brzezinka so called, Birken-wood (ph). It was about two\nmiles behind the camp Birkenau. So in this Brzezinka, in forest, there were from the, there\nwas a former village and the village the, the mhabitants of the village were pulled out, and\ntwo farm houses were adapted as gas chamber. Small farmhouses. I have the exactly plans if\nyou will later, I will explain to you. In the death sector I will explain. And they make from\nthese two farm houses gas chambers, yes. Two barraccks where the people took off their\nbelongings and then they were pulled to these gas chambers naked and they were poisoned\nthere, yes, and from this they were pulled out by commander and put in the graves,\nin the uh, mass graves. (Yes). Yes, in the mass graves. It was near and but nobody in the\ncamp, and there was a special squad, special detail Sonderkommando, so called\nSonderkommando, and they were in a special guarded block, yes. And nobody should uh,\nthey should not inter (ph) with other people from the camp. And I also was curious,\ntransport came, and this organization and somebody had some vetment (ph), some clothes,\norganized from this, or some things, or something wearing from transport, where is transport.\nIn Birkenau there it was a , a secret, yes, like a secret. But I was very curious, I\nalways, it was, it took fourteen days or something. (What took fourteen days?) Fourteen\ndays, you know, this situation that we couldn't discover what, how they are killing the\npeople. Yes, it was, it was nobody could come there from the normal prison. It was uh\nfenced. Yes, and so. But always the signs were there yes, and there is rumors. And one day, I\nmust tell you, when we came, so we told to this, there was prisoners, Polish prisoners, who\nhad division of the barrack where you should work, yes, so we came and told we are sloshers\n(ph), here, we are blacksmiths, . Where is your workshop you know, uh , where we\ncan work (place to work), place to work. And they were laughing. What you are crazy, work,\nprisoners, huh, maybe in some future. So what are you from, from . So I told him\nblacksmiths before I was blacksmith. But, so we have no such work now for\nblacksmiths. No work. And so we were on this block and uh, about one week, and uh, we\nwas still not divided into detail you know, and once we were going on this uh, lagerstrasen\n(ph), lager road, and there was a kappo. He was the commander of one thousand prisoners\nwho were maurers, uh learning how to lay the bricks uh and to make it work for building the\nhuge, uh, for the building of this huge crematorium for creamatory which were\nat that time in building, had not been built. (This was '42.) Yes. (1942) '42, yes, in the\nautumn, yes. And so we got going on this street, and once it came such a very nice kappo,\nprisoner, yes, had vetment (ph) according to his measurement. Yes, yes, And now the\n, told Willy, Willy, you are here, you are here. They were friends from this camp\nfrom the Hamburg, this criminal squad and then later in this Dachau and this Sachsenhausen,\nso they look at him, and so what are you doing here. So the Willy Nahman told him, yes, we\nare here, but the Polish they will not give us the work and so what you are slosher (ph). So\nhe was going there, Wiland (ph), the kappo was going with us to this Polish uh clerks, these\nPolish prisoners who make the detail, who make the decision where you should work, yes,\nand he told, look, these all five, I need workers, specialists, they will, uh will take care for\nmy, for my claim which they have some uh . You know, what the maurers had for\nthe uh, what they need for we should sharpen. (Oh, to sharpen knives.) Sharpen knives, and\nthese and this, I need all the five. And he took us five in his commando. (He saved your\nlives?) Yes. He was a maurer commando, a brick layers commando, and uh maurer, which\nare making the mortars you know, yes, this, so he was a great boss. He was a great\ncommando. Nobody could resist him. He was boss. So yes, I took them, and so they did\nnothing, and O.K., so you are in his commando. And we were in his commando, and he was\nnice to us and he asked, he, uh, he learned us how to organize. So he sent us, we had some\nboxes with some tools, and he sent us where the civil worker worked, you know, the civil,\ncivil worker. And opposite of the prisoners workers, the up building off the camp were many\nprivate firms which were contracted by the SS, and these private firms had so-called civil\nworkers. (Civil workers?) Civil workers who were the experts in some food, in some, some\nexperts in some disciplines, yes. To make roads and to build this and this. And this had a\nbunch from Gestapo and they were always guarded by an SS man and they could tend\ntwenty prisoners, to their help, and auxiliary prisoners. Yes, but it was forbidden that they\nshould not speak direct to the prisoners, only this guard, yes. And the guard always was, they\nonly give orders what to do, but we should never speak with them. But nevertheless, this SS\nguard was corrupted from them and from kappos and they went after these people who were\ngassed in gas chambers so all their belongings were brought in a special magazines (ph), yes.\nAnd from these magazines the kappos took it and give it to the civil workers, and they\nbrought eggs, they brought sausages, they brought yes, and this was their, for them. .",
        "Q: Who brought the eggs and the sausage?",
        "A: The civil workers. The civilians. You know, who was, they were in the camp, they were not\nso guarded, and they could get from the farmers and so on, and also money was there, yes.\nSo this, the people who were gassed, they had much money and they were found. And the\nkappos came to this and they had an organization. They knew how to get on this, uh, this\nbelongings, yes. And this, uh this, Winand (ph) he, for instance, he organized the Schnaps\n(ph), this liquor, yes, and he told, look, take this liquor in this uh our box (ph), that we have\nthe tools and bring it to this and this kappo (ph). And we didn't knew how dangerous this is.\nWe didn't know what he send us. So we thought, and we were not catched at this time. So\nwe were, yes, we were in his protection. And as I , SO I have these twenty marks,\nyou still remember, and we told him, so the kappo (ph) 1s so nice to us, yes, and we should\ngive him a present. So we five, our group. So we decided, we did, Willie Nachtman and I,\nwe would go to this Winand (ph), this kappo, he had his own room, and we came to him, and\nuh, he had very good supper with rootgaren (ph), with sausages, and this, this, and we told\nhim, look, you are very nice to us, and we will give you present. And we brought him this,\nthis, this twenty marks. And he laughed and he brought a bundle of and he light his\ncigarette with this, cigarette. See. The shock from him was nothing. A bundle of, of . So he\nlaughed. But he saw that we are , It's O.K., it's O.K., so I will, you can rely on\nme, and so. And so later, and later there was a need of slosher, there was a need of installers,\ntilers, of electricians, and so it came and built, and they make a maintenance squad,\nprisoners maintenance squad. And the uh sharfthrer (ph), an SS man, and he asked us to\nkeep all technical installment in the camp in order. And so he always took a professional for\nevery, and we worked then regularly. We had a, a workshop, and so we knew the\norganization, we had connections to the kappos, and so we observed what is it. So during\nthis two years, this twenty-eight months exactly, so I could observe, and we were going from\none camp to another. There were several camps in Birkenau. And we had a boomshk (ph),\nyou know, a permit, that we are authorized to repair these pipes and this and this and this.\nAnd we always get from this sharfthrer (ph) a letter where we should go. By the time we\ncould choose alone the work where we will go, and we brought him always something, what\nhe would have, a gold or something, what will you bring. He knew, he used us to organize\nfor him. From Kanada (ph), from sonderkommando so. And by this, we, we, the best\n, we had no hunger. We had so many to eat that we could support about twenty\nothers, yes. And when we came in the kitchen, there were in every camp kitchen forty kettles\nof uh steam kettles, where it was cooked, the food for all these prisoners, and uh, they asked\nwe should repair these kettles, and by the time we learned how to, in the beginning we didn't\nknow nothing, but later we knew how to handle it, to repair and we always get some food for\nthis repairing, from the SS men, from the accessory men, that they were, couldn't handle it\nand they needed it and so. And so we could organize food for other people and to help them.\nBut then I saw what it was not possible that we could survive. I saw it was not possible.\nWhy? That we were secret keeper. Yes. like the sonderkommando. We see so\nmuch, so we got on the list of secret keepers. (Secret keepers?) Secret keepers, bearers (ph),\nah, yes, you know, secret bearers (ph). And we knew, we should be killed, we should be\nshot, and there were some periods that they would exchange us. But the other ober _fthrer\n(ph), he was interested first that the work is running and secondly that organize the\nvaluables which he always wanted valuables. ( ) Yes from this, from this also\nspecial. So he keeped us. And so, that we, we, were in the ground (ph), and we were from\nthat we must give them all the reports. So what I observed every day I came\nto the ramp, I saw the selections exactly, yes.",
        "Q: Back up a little bit. You said that saw the cremetorium being built. Describe, can you talk\nabout how it was built, and when, and when the first gassings started in the cremetorium\nitself?",
        "A: The cremetoria were built up, yes, and they were ready I think in March, the first\ncremetorium in March was put in operation. (March '42?) Yes. We cannot came to the\ncremetoria when they were operating, but when they were not operating some pipes were\nleaking or something was necessary, an electrician also. So we came and the guard there, and\nthe guard was very exacting. He couldn't speak with the people in this cremetory, it was\nsonderkommando, but we saw, we saw the corpses. We saw not the - and this, you know, as\nI told you, this, this uh bunkers, these adapted cremetories, stopped the work and the\nsonderkommando came, but not I must, I forgot to tell you one very important thing. How I\ncame to contact this underground. So there still was, as I told you, a block when the\nsonderkommando was guarded, and there were about three hundred men, and they were\nunder the guard always going to this Birkenau, to this woods, and they came back and they,\nit was prohibited to contact them. And when I was going with my uh, with my box and one\nof these blocks, sonderkommando, blockaltester, the Jew, when I came nearer I saw that he\nwas a Jew, and here S S, Slovak, you know, a very nationality, he had a sign. When you\nhave this Jewish uh David Star. So you have inside the sign if you were Greek, G, if you\nwere Czech - C, if you were Slovak, an S. So I saw Slovak, so I asked him that is my\ncountryman. What are you doing here, I asked him where from you are,\nand so. We were , we were friends. Even . And he told me this--I\nnever forget: \"We are Chevra Kaddisha.\" You know what is the Chevra Kaddisha.",
        "Q: Yes. Explain it to the camera.",
        "A: Yes. Chevra Kaddisha, so it is a saint [NB: sacred] burial society of Jews. So I didn't\nunderstand. I was shocked. And he told me, \"Look. There...in the woods about two miles,\nthere are some adapted gas chambers from the farm houses. And this sonderkommando 1s\npulling out the corpses of the deported people who are in...the forced by the SS men. And\nafter they are dead, so they are pulling their corpses from this . And they are burying\nthem in the mass graves. Yes. But there are nearly 100,000 corpses in those graves, and uh\nthe water 1s poisoned. Yes. And the water for the whole vicinity. And so it was decided to\nburn---not to bury, to burn. So now this sonderkommando was more...hundred more people;\nand they are digging out these graves, mass graves, and the decaying corpses they are lying\nthem on their on their lorries--small wagons--narrow way, right. And they are putting them\nabout 100 kilometer farther. And there, there is a piles on the...piles from the rails and they\nare pouring them with the fluid; and with the fluid, with the shmatas--with the rags. And they\nare burning them [with] this. And this sonderkommando which you see, they are on the night\nshift.\" And he asked me if I can make a lock or something to repair for him. And so he told,\nbut I would not believe it. I couldn't. And he told me (whispered), \"You don't believe it.\" I\ncouldn't believe. Look, I was three years in the camp at the time. \"And look, so you will see\nit.\" And I didn't know. A few days, came an SS man for me to this kapo. He needs a\nschlosser [Ger: \"locksmith, mechanic or fitter\"], a blacksmith, to repair a bearing in this\nwagon. You know a bearing. And he took me and brought me there, and he stand nearby me\nwhen I make this metal (ph), this bearing house from this wagon which was broke. And I\nsaw it. I saw how the Slovak sonderkommando, Slovak prisoners, uh _ buried...uh\ntook...digged out these open graves. And as they came, the corpses put on these wagons, and\nbrought them back where they were. And from far, I saw also this white bunk house,\nbunkers--this farm house, where this...I saw it. So from this, moment I believe it. So how\nhard was it belief to other people, yes. Now, and so...and this, there was the first\nsonderkommando from Slovakia which came in April 1942, and they were took from these\none thousand men, three hundred; and they brought...they used them for this\nsonderkommando. Yes, and there was the first sonderkommando. And short after, I think in\nDecember, they organized a mass escape. And somebody traited...was a traitor and who\nthought he will save his own life, and he told it to the SS men. And the whole\nsonderkommando was uh ...one day the whole sonderkommando, and they took them to\nAuschwitz I and they shot them and burned them.",
        "Q: Tell me about the mass escape which was planned.",
        "A: Yes, the mass escape of this sonderkommando was planned at that time was possible to\nescape, the fences were not so tight, Birkenau, it was in the middle of the woods and so on,\nand there were some escapes, yes, but you must see that people refused to work. But in the\nmoment when they refused to work, or didn't work good, the they shot, the SS men\nshot them, on the spot, yes. And uh this, and their blockaltester (ph) this Rosin (ph)\n, and still he is living. You should hear him. Yes, I will give you\nthat. This Rosin, Arnold Rosin (ph), he is the only one from this other commando who\nsurvived. Only first. Others, all were destroyed, yes. It is in my articles. How, it 1s interesting\nhow he survived this.",
        "Q: Tell how, describe the plan of the revolt, do you know?",
        "A: I know, look, they tried that they will go, they will uh, they will go far behind the, the uh\nfenced, behind the area of the, there was no fence. Behind the area where the, the bunkers\nwere yes. It was not fenced. There were SS men, the guards, they were surrounding them,\nyes. And they told, they were, they were uh, inbofond (ph). There were some guards they\nwill kill and they will go to Slovakia. They organize some cars, yes, and an SS man was\ninvolved in this who was a Slovak SS man, yes, a Slovak. And uh, they believed him, and\nuh, there very exact uh details are not now, maybe there was once, but that, that, and the fact\nthat it was uh, told to SS men, yes, and the one who told it, yes, they killed him with an axe.\nThis traitor, they killed him. They killed him, but it was too late.",
        "Q: The Jews killed him?",
        "A: Yes, the Jews killed him. The name isn't known at all, in the details. And so, and exactly four\ndays or five days later came a new transport from Polish ghettos, and from this transport they\ntook a new sonderkommando, about three hundred men, and from this survived several and I\nhave very detailed uh testimonies of them, and so, and also from this Rosen (ph). From this\nRosen (ph) I have this hugh, he escaped later from Auschwitz. Uh we know how he saved\nEurope, how he saved. Look, it was forbidden to get from this sonderkommando commando,\nto the other , to transport to another, nobody could go away from this other\ncommando. But this Rosen (ph), he found a, bread, you know, a whole bread, and when he\nbreak this bread, inside in this bread was a golden chain and a gold watch, yes. Inside, from\nthe deportees. Someone told it will save his life, so brought him this. And so he was on the\nblock and he gave this a to the blockaltester, . (Say it again in\nEnglish.) Yes, the blockaltester was the boss of the block, normally a prisoner or\n. And the schreiber [Ger: scribe], the clerk, who was his aide, was also.\nAnd he corrupted, he gave these valuables, these forms to them and they asked him they\nshould transfer him to another block. Even it, 1t was written, they did it by the way he is a ill\nand so on. Even so, and through the infirmary they got him in another block, you known,\ntransmitted. SO he was not there, in this block. And so he saved his life, and he is still living,\nyes. Arnold Rosin (ph) is his name. So this I will, (let's come back to you), yes, so now you\nsee, so I, how I make the first contact with this other commando with all these people. So I\nhad a survey, how, what, how the barracks. And so I give it to underground and it was the\ncentral, was in Auschwitz I, but there was some prisoners, Shmuleski and so on who came in\nthis Auschwitz I who was a tiler you know from the roof.",
        "Q: O.K. Slow down and explain a little more about this whole underground network and your\ninvolvement.",
        "A: Yes, so there was an underground of mainly, in the Polish camps, yes, the Polish, but non-\nJews. And they central was in the Auschwitz I camp, in the main camp. And the head of this,\nthis I didn't knew at that time, but how was it, Cirankiewicz (ph), later the Minister President\nof the Polish Republic, he was and he was at that time uh, uh nurse on the, he was prisoner,\npolitical prisoner, Polish prisoner, and he was a nurse on the prison uh infirmary. And he has\nsome group, so-called camp group (ph) of Auschwitz, the fighting group of Auschwitz, but\nthere was Austians, some French and some Poles. They didn't took a Jew inside, yes. They\nused the services of Jews but a Jew was not in there, yes. And one of these liaisons was\nDavid Shmuleski (ph). He was a Jew who was fighting in the Spanish, uh, against Franco (. .\ncivil war). Later he was transported when they lost, so he was in France, to Drancy, and from\nDrancy came on transport to Auschwitz. And Shmuleski came with this, but he has also very\nmany friends in this, uh, underground. Yes. They trusted him. And so he was a liaison\nbetween Birkenau and Auschwitz I. And when he was a roofer, yes, on the roof, you know,\nthe tar, and on the roof is the tar, they were putting roofs and the covered with the tar,\nyouknow, with the paper, you know with this. And for tar, 1t must be the store for tar was in\nAuschwitz I, in the main camp, and so from time to time he came to Auschwitz I. We came\nalso from time for some material we needed, so we came to Auschwitz I, only as uh with a\nguarded with an SS man, but we had connections. And this uh Shmuleski (ph), make the\nconnections with this main camp, and they, and so I gave this and he told, you should all\nobserve and tell me and we will, the Polish uh prisoners have contact with the Polish\ngovernment in London. They have contact through Armia Kraiova. We have note from\nBirkenau, but we, he told us, not names, but he, and this he, he knew much, but we knew the\ndetails, more details. So I told him the details and he gave it further to this uh, to this uh\ncamp group at Auschwitz, this fighting group at Auschwitz. And they have the contact. But\nlater we knew that they are guarding only their own interests. For Jews, they didn't care. So\nwe then, later we find some Czech-Polish, some Czech civil workers, you know, who\nworked, but they were Czechs, yes, and the detail how it worked we have three. And they\ncame from time to time, in three months they could go travel to their families to\nCzechlovakia. And even if they were guarded, they were civil workers, as I told you, at the\ncivil enterprise which were, so one was a carpenter, one make roofs, and one was expert for\nthe canalization, yes for the canalization, the the channels (ph), and for water pipes\nand so. We make with them connections and so were were connected, and we also, we could\nstole plans, yes.",
        "Q: How did you steal plans?",
        "A: Somebody would not believe it. How it was possible. It's already, I can show you a letter\nfrom Polish museum I got now, a certification for it .. There was a so-called Baulaitung of\nAuschwitz, a construction office, a hugh construction office of SS, who made the planning\nand construction of their hugh camps and of the cremetoria, the gas chambers, yes, there was\na hugh office, there were several hundred. But they also took some prisoners, some uh,\nqualified prisoners. So there was, for instance, an engineer, Vera Foltinf (ph). He was an\narchitect, an engineer. So they took him to draw the plans, see, in the office. There was\nBitterman, he was an engineer, so they took him and he was in the commando. He took\nthere and in the office he drawed (ph) for the SS men. And so we pursuaded him he should\nmake a small copies of the plans. And he smuggled it out, and we gave it later to these civil\nworkers, and it came to Prague, and the wife of Kraus, my friend who was non-Jewish, and\nhe was, he had contact through the Swiss consulate in Prague. And so the plans went to the\nSwiss consulate, through this. An original of these plans are in The Death Factory, exactly\nthe plans, yes. They were later when it was this, maybe you know this, when it was revived\nthe Holocaust when the CIA make these pictures, you know, the Americans photographed\nAuschwitz, (right), you know this, exactly, but they told they didn't knew. They never\nbombed. Yes. And later, after many years, they make, they published it publically, the, all\nthese pictures. There were seven raids on Auschwitz, and there is also written that\nis make according to that factory, they ask that the plans are so exactly,\nwhen you see it from, so you see the prints, the basement prints, exactly what we stole from\nthis, from this factory. So it was, and so we had luck. We were lucky that uh, there were\nmany people who paid with life this activity yes. But, and so, that I told you, I was conscious\nthat I can not, it was not according to the human calculation that you would survive. Yes.\nEspecially they guarded us. Yes. So I remember once I was going, it was in '44, in autumn, I\nwas going through the uh, the gate. And always there was a guard. And I always must tell\nhalfling numeral this and this number are going there and there. And he mark the number\nwhere I am in the camp. Yes. That is in evidence. I was going, always without guard, in this\nguarded area. I could go without guard when I had this permission; and I told him the\nnumber--73,000. And there was already 400,000 tattooed. \"So what, 73,000, (ph) ?\nRepeat!\" I repeat. He jumped and go and look on my... \"And how's that you are not dead?\nYou should be dead. This is not possible!\" So I told him, \"Look, I have this...I am expert in\nthis.\" \"Oh, you should not be...you will not alive. You will not wait, Ivan. We have five, you\nwill not wait alive Ivan. You cannot expect that, Ivan. We will save you, yes, the Russians,\nyes,\" he told. . Five minutes before and we , we will shot you\nsaid the SS man, very, very angry, yes. So, such an experience. So nevertheless, so uh, I was\nuh, crematoria then when they come and",
        "Q: Can't hear you. A little louder.",
        "A: I am... Should I jump to that moment when the crematoria were destroyed and when the\nuprising was, or still you have some questions.",
        "Q: No, go ahead, I think we're ready to, that's fine. If you're ready to go there, then we're ready\nto go there.",
        "A: Now, look, first I want you to know about the selections. So, if you have the plans, so you\nsee there are seven camps in Birkenau, yes, and in the middle before the deportment, there\nwere the women's camp, and then the other, the section two, section five. There was built a\nramp (ph), a huge three-chain ramp through...",
        "Q: Three-level ramp?",
        "A: No, no. It's called a passing. You know, uh three-rail... the three rail, from Auschwitz station\nto Birkenau, it was about three kilometer, and the trains came directly before near the\ncremetoria. And the ramp was between, it was a dead ramp, he told us. It was a three-rail,\nand like a huge ramp, and on this ramp came the trains. There were sometimes three, five\ntrains, and on every train there came about three, four, five thousand people. And we saw\nthat the squad of the SS doctors, and their Lagerfthrer, they were making the selection. Yes,\nthey were making the selection. And we saw it, how they were making it. And I was going to\nthe ramp. In the selection, in the process selection, I could go there. But I had these\n, | was sure they will not let me, now they will not take me in. And I was curious\nhow they were making this, yes. So uh, first when I was going from one camp to the other\nso, it was between these two camps and I had to wait and in the other camp, this was a\nwomen's camp, and I had to repair some kitchens there, or some kettles, so I had to wait by\nthe guard. They had the guardstube [Ger: \"guardroom\"], the guard house, yes; an SS man\nalways guarded it. But when the transport came, I had to wait. The SS man was very curious,\nand he also tried to organize something, yes, when there was some food or something\nvaluable. So they always tried. So I have to wait 'til he had time to register my name. And so\nI observed. And this time, I... I experienced a very interesting and moving, moving sense.\nYes. So the whole, I net (ph) this hundred selections, I saw many. And everybody tell you,\n\"Mengele, Mengele.\" It's not true. Look, the Mengele, they didn't very often the selection.\nThere were twenty-three doctors--twenty-three doctors--who had the service for selections at\nthe ramp. And sometimes also was Mengele; but Mengele was eager to have the twins, and\nthe people who were not normal. You know, they had the of something distracted\npeople--he was interested in this. So he didn't...he didn't trust also to the selectees...to his\ncolleagues who selected, and he always watched. And so did his , \"Are you\ntwins? Are you not twins?,\" and so, yes. Or, \"What you are of profession?\" And they\ndiscovered some doctors like Nisly (ph), and he took the doctors and they make for him this\nuh, yes, this searches of the...of the twins. You know, post-mortem, you know, post-mortem\nprotocol.",
        "Q: Autopsy.",
        "A: Autopsy. They make the protocols, sign it and send it to Berlin (cough), and so.",
        "Q: Do you want some water?",
        "A: So this I saw, I observed it uh consciously, I would know it and so what I knew so I gave to\n, to ,",
        "Q: You passed the information along to the underground?",
        "A: Yes, but once... Maybe this would be also interesting for you, the Shmulenski (ph), which I\ntold you was the liaison between Auschwitz. And he told, \"Look, we need photograph. The\nworld will not believe in our reports. We need photograph.\" They asked me we should\nphotograph. So I need a photograph he told, Shmulenski (ph). So photograph, it was very\nhard to, not so hard to organize, but smuggle in the camera. As the people brought many\nphotographs you know, for the parents, all the equipment, they brough the whole equipment\nfor the dentist, for instance, all the people brought with them. And once it came that we were\ngoing to the ramp, myself and Kraus (ph), my friend, together, and he saw a carriage, a baby\ncarriage there, after the Holland transport came. It was only the ramp was clean, and still\nthere was a heap of this trunks and of this and so the Kanada kommando took it away to this\nstorage to sort 1t and to take the valuables from this. You know Kanada, what it was.",
        "Q: Explain Kanada for the tape.",
        "A: Look. The Kanada, it was a special squad--a special detail, so-called averamudienst (ph) in\nGerman. Averamudienst (ph). It means that they should clean, they should help when the\nprisoners, deportees, came. So they had the service; and they always told to the prisoners, in\ntheir language, \"Out of the wagons, and you should go left. All your luggage, they will bring\nit in the camp. You should not care.\" And so they have the task to quiet them a little, yes;\nand there was also a I can't. And after their...they have to quiet them in their own\nlanguage. And the SS men were also behind them . And after their transport were\nselected and put...put to...brought to the gas chambers, out of the camps who were working,\nwho were able-bodied. So then it was a heap of trunks of all this, and they brought with a list\nto the Kanada camp, where there was thirty barracks where all the belongings of these\ndeportees were sorted. Were sorted and checked. Many people uh, uh sewed in their\nraiments, in their shoes, in every possible hidings, , and all. And this were, and the\nguard sorted, and when they found something so they must give it away. Ifa prisoner tried to\norganize, to take something for himself, so if he was catched, he was shot on the spot. But\nnevertheless, this brunt (ph), this business with the SS man also tried to get something but\nhad access, and so used the prisoners who had access and so on, yes. It was very\ncomplicated. And this Kanada, the name Kanada came as it is a in Kanadas,\nvery far. They are rich people and they have a good living. Kanada, it was\nknown, it was a dream of a welfare society, yes. So they made the name \"Kanada\" as this\nkommando always had...always had bacon, had food, had decent... It was a good kommando.\nA good detail. But they were guarded. And when somebody...many of them were shot for\nwhen they were catched from organizing. It was organizing. And, told when somebody\nwould. And so I will come to this camera, and the Kraus (ph) took this carriage, and brought\nit in the camp. And the in the carriage there was a small package. Look in the carriage. We\nhave in our maintenace squad, there came SS men, they would have tor repair whatever, a\nlamp (ph), but he couldn't take it by a normal way. So he gave to us in this squad and make\nalso a carriage, some baby carriage. And so repair baby carriage. There was not a wheel, and\nso Kraus (ph) in the first moment told, yes, baby carriage would be good if there is SS man,\nwe will have a repair, and so I have spare parts, but what we found in this package was food,\nand there was a camera. A spiegel (ph) camera, camera, spiegel (ph) camera. It means mirror\ncamera yes. And so Shmuleski came, and we showed, look, oh, I cannot . . It must be a\n. Otherwise I cannot photograph. , you know. So his plan was that he will go",
        "on the roof, yes, and carry the camera to the roof, and manage to exchange a\nand through this and make the shots. This was his plan. So he would not have this camera.\nSo he, and he seek. But we would destroy this camera, yes. It was very dangerous to have a\ncamerA: So we have a, when the is going to make a fire, and so we have\nthis in our, our equipment. And then there was a friend of Shmulenski (ph) who work on the\nwater barricades who worked with civilian workers on the water and he was engineer of\nwood, and he was in our squad, and he sometimes came and he had the contact with this\nPolish civilian workers. Yes. And he told, no look, we can get three, four hundred cigarettes\nfor this, and I will take it and I will give it to civilian worker. So, he took it. He took it and he\nbrought I think uh about hundred cigarettes and divided. But in two months, about, in two",
        "months we were called, schlosser , locksmiths in the...they should come to the\nblockfuhrerstube (ph) in the entrance to the camp, yes. And by the entrance to the camp,\nthere were a guard from Gestapo, they had two clerks, which should observe what happened\nin the camp, yes. In this, there was the office of Gestapo detail, in this uh, in this guard, it\nwas a guard house, and there was, and we should go, it was called schlosser . But it\nwas nothing because they always asked for something, if there was in another camp. And the\nKraus (ph), was going there, yes, my friend the Kraus(ph). And yes, they asked for him. And\nhe came in about twenty minuetes back he was bloody, he was pale and uh, he told look\nBrazovsky (ph) is lying on the corridor, beaten to blant (ph). Yes, Brazovsky, who took once\nthe camerA: And he told me also I couldn't keep, they beat me so I must confess. I couldn't\nkeep, I must confes. So he didn't go in the office and he returned back. What should we do?\nWe are all involved in this, yes. What should we do? And this was a, , a very\ndesperate situation.",
        "Q: Hold it, hold this. You're right at the point where they need to change tape. Let them change\nthe tape and we will pickup\nTAPE #3",
        "Q: O.K. Are we rolling? O.K. Let's take it back to that moment where you saw Brazovsky (ph)\non the floor and they came back to you and you knew you were in trouble.",
        "A: So and Kraus (ph) came to us, what we should do. We, there was a fiend of us who was in\ncharge of the station for repairing the teeth for SS men, yes. They came there. He was expert\nfor this, he was an artist and a doctor for, dentist doctor. (He was a dentist.) And he told\nthem he was a friend was and uh, in the reserve (ph). His name is Alex\nRosenstock (ph) and he told look, I will give you a morphine injection. You will not feel it if\nthey will beat you. Yes. And they gave him a morphine injection and he proved it, and he\nsticked it in, and he didn't feel. And he was going.",
        "Q: This is Kraus, going back?",
        "A: Can't think what he was told the SS asked him. He was then back, he couldn't, he came in\ntwenty minutes, half-hour back, laughing. Back. Just laughing. And he told the story. I came\nto this office and there were two SS men, Lachman (ph) and Boger (ph), I knew them. There\nwas a table and on the table was the camera and they whip. A whip, yes,\nand it was a pistol. And they asked me did you know the camera. Yes, I know. How did you\nget to this camera? So I told them the story, I found it a carriage and I brought this baby\ncarriage and we found the camera and so. So why didn't you give up the camera to the SS\nmen? Look, the camera, it's like a machine gun, a machine gun, yes, would you shot me. So\nwe heed some cigarettes, so we tried. So, and for what reason you would have this carriage.\nAh, this carriage, look, some SS would have repaired some baby carriage, so I told him I will\nmake him a good service, when I can repair, so he told it the guard. So let us know the name\nof the SS man who ordered, who have from you the repair of a baby carriage. The guard's\nname I don't remember. So you don't remember, so they give me a slap, they give me another\nslap. Now, you remember. I cannot. So they opened the door. Look, you will look like this,\nlike Brazovsky, if you don't admit to whom you made the repair. So\nhe told, I never will uh, never will uh, no\nI never will. You speak another language? No. I never will tell\nuh , [never will an SS man to denounce, no. I never will denounce an SS man. So\nthey give him a kick hard. Yes. Nothing. This moment when he told I never will denounce\nan SS man, why all the SS men were involved in some way with the prisoners, and so when\nthey saw, this is 1n all prisoners, and he, he will never, in this situation he will not denounce\nan SS man, so he is a good man. So they kicked him out, and he came back laughing. He told\nI was so quiet with this injection, so quiet that I didn't feel it, danger, nothing. I was very\nquiet like comrades to the SS. So, yes, also Brazovsky they let him 1n the , was in the\ninfirmary, and also.",
        "Q: That's quite a tale.",
        "A: So, also this, such, this not the only case. There were another when we have a radio, and so.\nBut this, I never will forget, this one when Kraus came back laughing after this and told this\nstory. Yes. But later, they make the photographs, later. There are known, these photographs,\nthese three or four photographs, and I discovered in the bathroom they were made and the\nstories about them, it's not true that Shmuleski made them. It's told Shmuleski told he made\nthem but it's not true. I later discovered who, why.",
        "Q: Who made them?",
        "A: It made, a Polish, a Greek officer, a young Greek officer. Who later tried to escape and were\nkilled. Uh, I puzzled the place where from it was done. Shmulevski told it was done from the\nroof, yes, and he told him but he wouldn't . And so, but when I was in Yad\nVashem working, and so I showed these photographs to a photographer who was there and\nhe asked me how it was done. I told him from the roof. It is not possible, the angle is not\npossible from the roof, it is not possible. And yes, he was true. And later I know how it was\nfrom the frame, we found the frame of the gas chamber in the cremetortum number four,\nthere from it was done. Yes, so this is the story.",
        "Q: Interesting. Let's go back to you, go back to Erich Kulka. What happened after that camera\nincident?",
        "A: After the camera incident, nothing. Nothing. With this moment when he told if I\nthe SS man, it was forgotten - no medal, nothing.",
        "Q: O.K. What did you do, you were involved with the underground at that point and kind of\nwith a commando, what kinds of things were you involved in?",
        "A: Look, always...every man who survived long time and held the position...look, it was the\nsurviving. It was possible to survive for eight or three, four, five percent of people to survive.\nWho--people, prisoners--who had a luck to get the job which the SS men needed. This were\nthe doctors, the nurses, and all kinds of artisans--tilers, and so on. They needed them.\nTherefore, first they had a better possibility to move. They had the possibility to eat, yes, to\norganize food; and they had always some connections. Sometimes the connections were very\ndangerous. The SS men shoot the people and so on. When they feel they are in danger, yes.\nSo you were never very sure of this. So connections, I in Kanada. And so, in the\nKanada ...look, the Kanada...the details. Kanada was very, uh very severely watched, yes; if\nthey are organizing, if they came to the camp, they were always checked. And so, in spite the\nSS men knew that they are organizing and in spite they always are interested that they should\norganize for them, yes. So it was so.",
        "Q: Be specific. You are talking about bribes and the cheating...",
        "A: Yes, now. So look, the Kanada had this special camp. It was E...Camp E... I forget. G camp.\nI can show you on the plan. In this camp, there were about thirty barracks, like prisoner\nbarracks. And in these barracks were sorted all the belongs which the...the...which were\ntaken off from the deportees. Yes. And in these barracks, when they came, they was\nsonderkommando. The prisoners, they must go and take off all their uh . And in\nanother barrack, they got another uh suits, clothes. So...and when they returned they\nmust...they must make also in one barrack, and then another. So they could not keep, or very\nhard to keep, something in their raiments. The same was with the SS men, the SS men who\nobserved; they came to the Gestapo, they came to make SS , Shower, and in an\nelegant way. And also must keep their...their suits. They get other suits; and through the\nGestapo...through the bathroom, yes. So also they could keep. So who could keep.\nSometimes they managed. But the...the artisans, for instance, we were called to repair\nelectrician, or to repair a pipe or repair something. I remember an SS man asked when we\nshould organize for him a fur, yes. Organize it a fur. A real fur, yes. A nice fur for his wife.\nSo when we came to this, when we have some work in Kanada, we knew that we would\ncome there. So there the floor was...there was no planks, nothing. It was mud, on\nthe...such...packed. Yes.",
        "Q: Oh, O.K. Packed dirt.",
        "A: Yes. Packed dirt, yes. And so we contacted these from Kanada, the prisoners which were in a\nneighboring camp. And he promised he will dig in in the floor something what we were\ninterested, some ring or brilliant--something small. And we had in our uh boxes,\n, water crane (ph), uh, water pipe. Yes, this...what is water running, what is that?",
        "Q: The water closets, they're for the pipes.\nA; For the pipes. No, when the water is running?",
        "Q: Faucet.",
        "A: Faucet. And in the middle of this faucet is such a hat (ph) you know, if you can dismantle it.\nSo you can in the middle of this such a hat (ph). And this we operated out, and there we put\nthis contraband, you know. And we screwed it very tightly. And so...we were going, so we\nchecked this and this. But he didn't find. And so, I wanted to how...how they traded (ph) the\nSS men with us. So before we came from our camp, it was the camp to the\ncamp , we had to pass three different guards, guard barracks, yes. And so when we\ncame from one camp, so the SS men told, \"Look, what you bring? I know the rings or watch\nor something.\"",
        "Q: The SS men knew about this?",
        "A: Sure. You in Kanada, so you bring this and this. They knew. And he found another SS man,\nand told, \"Look, this uh blacksmiths, they will bring some valuables. If you will find them,\nyou can have it.\" So...so we were going through this. And the SS men [said], \"You have\nsomething.\" \"No. We have nothing.\" So we tried and and they didn't find. And this\nSS man, when we came on the camp to this SS man who offered this: \"So where have\nyou...?\" \"Uh, be patient. We will bring it to you.\" So we came to our...our maintenance\nbarrack squad, into shop, of the squad, and the . And for our eyes he was a\ngood ring or something. He phoned to another SS man, before me, you fool, how did\nyou check these people. They brought it. Yes, so if; he asked how it's our secret. So this 1s\nthe way, but we were sure, if he would find this prisoners who make this organization, gold\nor something very valuable, he would give him slip and he would sew in pocket. He would\nnot . But even if he would find a letter, even so innocent letter from a wife to a man\nat another camp, immediately he would take a notice to a Gestapo office, and they would\nbrought you and murder you and kill you. Just, even make a case, a great case of a spy. And\nI don't know what. But they never make it , the SS men.",
        "Q: They would put it in their pocket.",
        "A: Yes, they were very eager to get some value from this. And this I knew. Yes. So this was,\nbut it was dangerous, but 1t happened sometimes, this. So this I explain you, the Kanada.",
        "Q: Take us down to the liberation and what happened.",
        "A: Look, the liberation, so it was, you don't understand. I will tell you also that my wife and my\neleven-year son came to Auschwitz. They were in Theresienstadt when I was already long\ntime in Auschwitz. Normally, the deportees were always selected and the wives with\nchildren were put in the gas chambers. It was normal. But the first time into us, in September\n1943, it came from Theresienstadt a transport of Czech prisoners. And no of them were\nselected and all were put in a special camp, so-called a Czech \"family camp.\" In Birkenau it\nwas a camp. And nobody was allowed to go from the camp, and nobody was allowed to go\nin. It was isolated. The people were not shaved their hair. They didn't work opposite...outside\nthe camp. They get the better food. And there were rumors that they will be exchanged for\nGerman prisoners. Yes. And they believe it, believe it all. They had special rights, special\nconditions. And there was in my wife and our family, and my son also. So I also...yes. But\nwe couldn't believe for the first time they took the transport to Birkenau. And the reason for\nthis was that there were rumors that from Theresienstadt, who was proclaimed as special and\nprominent uh ghetto, yes, that the people were deported to the east and killed. There were\nrumors. So that they would uh block these rumors. And these people who came to\nTheresienstadt from the camp, they must write every month a letter to Theresienstadt or to\nother. And they wrote a letter and could ask for to send them a package of food; and they got\nthe food from Portugal, from France, from Switzerland, yes. And they wrote letters to\nTheresienstadt, where their relatives or friends were. But the address to avoid any connection\nwith Auschwitz; so they wrote the address: \"Arbeitslager Birkenau.\" This [means]\n\"working camp Birkenau.\" \"Bei Neu Bieru_\"--it's near Neu Bieru_. It was about nine\nkilometers far. There was a post office there, you could find it on the map. \"Lagerstrasse\"\nand number--it is a street, a camp street; this house number, and this and this. So they avoid\nany... And so they came to [NB: from] Theresienstadt, a new camp, a working camp it's all.\nThere were some...in the text we tried to mark it in hiding the letter that there 1s a camp of\nthat, and we need some people that were already dead. But they couldn't understand it. But\nafter half a year, they had decided the whole camp to anihilate. They put them all in the gas\nchambers, yes. And in this camp also was my son and my wife, and also in this transport.\nAnd by...it was in the records, my son at the time he was 1n infection block in this camp. And\nin this infection block were already about twenty prisoners from Mengele with the twins\nwho make these experiments, yes. And my son, he was...he called a \"pocket schwartze\"--\nblack pockets--you know...",
        "Q: Black lungs.",
        "A: ..this un infection, , this cough, it was infection. And he was put on this\ninfection block with some others. And the people, they would not believe. If we knew it, or\nthe underground, or on the seventh of September, or seventh March, we got message from\nfamily, from women's camp, there was a secretary, a prisoner, who had some phone call\nfrom an officer that they should prepare . Look, it means that they should\nprepare the killing of this whole camp from, the family camp. And we warned them, they\nwould not believe it, they told it's not possible. Eichmann was there three months ago and\nthey educated children, they had a school for children, they was interested in education. They\ncould not believe it. But why believe and they ask me if we should. I came there only on my\noccupation as a plumber, to repair these kettles.",
        "Q: So you saw your wife.",
        "A: Yes. So with this they didn't knew it, that I have the wife, the SS men, in the camp. But\nthrough this...my profession, I could contact my wife and my son. And I arranged, she asked\nme, when she believed. Helga believed. And there were so many tricks what the SS men\nmade they shouldn't believe that they believe more the SS men than they did us. Yes, I wrote\nit all, this. And I suceed, managed with a doctor that he gave to my wife injection and he was\nas some signs of typhoid fever and they took them one, one night before the liquidation of\nthe camp, to this block, to this infirmary, epidemic block 32. And this they couldn't took.\nOnly this best, there were some so they didn't took this block. So they\nsurvived. Unbelievable, yes. I wrote this many, many times. I just wrote I will, maybe I\nforgot to give it to you, the first time after fifty years, thirty years, I wrote the story about my\nescape and survival, my son in a special about seventy pages. I will send it to you. So this is\nthe family camp. It was liquidated in one night. It was under commmando. They tried to\nmake a , yes, to burn the blocks, it was straw and wood with some fuel, you know,\nin this lighters, in this fuel, when you have the lighters for cigarette, there is a fuels, some\nsmall fuel, ampules (ph), and this we delivered to them from Kanada, many, much, but they\ndidn't believe and they didn't make it, an uprising. So that much details. So, this was the very\nstrong thing. But now, will this sonderkommando, the uprising of this sonderkommando,\nmaybe, and then the escape.",
        "Q: Talk about you know and your escape from the train and your escape from Auschwitz.",
        "A: Yes. So this sonderkommando, I give you a story. The escape. So now it came to the\nevacuation. We didn't believe and once it was in January, on the second of November, the\ngassing was stopped. I remember it very good. There was a transport from Slovakia and they\nwas, there were no, they came all to camp, none came to the selection, none came to the gas\nchambers. And then, they ordered the dismantling and destroying of the gas chambers. Yes,\nyes.",
        "Q: This is November 1944.",
        "A: 1944. And before, also, there were a huge transport from Hungary. And it was the top of the\ndestruction, they twenty thousand a day, during this Hungarian transport. And this\nsonderkommando brought about nine hundred people. And they liquidated two hundred and\ntwo hundred and for the liquidation. They other three hundred, these sonderkommando knew\nit and from the despair they made uprising and they killed three SS men, they wounded\ntwelve, but four hundred and fifty were killed and they burned as the cremetorium number\nfour was put in fire and was put out of operation.",
        "Q: You said four of us. You were part of this?",
        "A: What I told for us. No. Look, I was not in this sonderkommando.",
        "Q: No, I didn't think you were. That's why I. .",
        "A: No. We observed this, and I heard it, how, and I believed in the beginning that it was useless,\nthe powder, this this podwer for this, the crash of this when the roof collapsed,\nwhen the roof collapsed was so strong that it looked like explosion. But later it turned out it\nwas not, and it is written, this article which I will give you. But now, this destruction. So the\ncremetoria, this one cremetorium was put out of operations on the 7th of October 1944, from\nsonderkommando. They proved that it was possible to destroy with own hands and force the\nkilling facilities. But only the destruct (ph) group at Auschwitz, the fighting group of\nAuschwitz. They promise them help, and they never get help. In the last moment they\nrefused, the Polish. And they told later, it was in a document, they told that we will dare to\nmake an uprising only in the moment when we are in the such stage, endangered as the Jews.\nUntil that moment, the Polish, the non-Jews were not put to the gas chambers from the\ntransport, only when they were ill and. So later, three times they traited, they didn't keep their\nvow, they didn't help. So, there was one cremetoria was destroyed by prisoners. The two\nother cremetorias, the SS men, they exploded them. But there still are traces in Auchwitz,\nyes, you have the gas chambers, and the dismantling rooms, you can see them exactly. And\nthey make a hugh dismantling commando, mainly for women, and they cleaned the bricks,\none brick after another, and they put it on the wagons in a very nice manner. Like the\nGerman are accustomed. And we, the schlossers, the plumbers, the artists, the commando,\nthis Stermitz, Oberscharfihrer who were in charge of commando, he asked that we should\ndismantle this ventilaters, the pieces of the furnaces (ph) and we dismantled it and it was put\nin conserve with vaseline and put in tight paper nice and put in the wagons. And I asked this\nSteimitz, I asked him had Herr Oberscharfuhrer, where did you get it. I was good with him,\nhe asked sometimes what will you bring me, so I asked him, the Jews are alredy anhilated,\nand war will be finished. What will you do with this equipment? And he told me this. I will\ntell in German, original. I never forget it.\n. I will translate it for you. \"Look,\nJew,\" he told me, \"our Fuhrer has a secret weapon. Now it will come over Europe. And then\nwill come the downfall of the Poles and Czechs, and we will finish them quicker than the\nJews.\" So it was on the 26th of December, 1944. I never will forget this moment. Yes. This\nSteimitz. I later found him...when I identified an SS man, I found him in the SS hospital in\nZelek (ph) in Hamburg. So this is the...now the escape, yes. So it...one day, three or four\ndays, it came ordered that they should burn all the documents which were in the blocks, you\nknow--the cards, the names, the list, it was burned. The officers disappeared, the SS officers.\nThere were only the surgeons, and these law officers. And on the 18th of November it was\nordered evacuation. So there were still about in, about 50 or 60,000 prisoners in there all, the\nAuschwitz camps. There were many...39 camps, 39. And we... So I was Birkenau, was about\n16,000, yes. First we tried...we had...we organized a nice uh clothes, civilian clothes. And the\nprisoners want to only for them, and good boots. And so we tried, we would wait when the\nRussian came, it was before. So we digged near our workshop a hole, and we tried that we\nwill hide, make a hidden entrance. O.K., we tried; we are three or four. But then when the SS\nmen make these empty...the camps, so they came with bloodhounds there. And if they found\nsomebody they shot him on the spot. So we...we... So it 1s not possible; so we came to this\ntransport. There was about one thousand, always one thousand prisoners, under the guard of\nthese SS men, and we make three days march 'til we came to the station Loslau (ph). And if\nsomebody couldn't go, and was behind, so behind was a special shooting commando, they\nshot him. And I think about half of the prisoners, still they came from our bach (ph) to\nLoslau to the station where they put us in open coal trucks. Open coal trucks. They put about\nmore than one hundred in there. We were like sardines. We can only stand, yes. And during\nthe trip, the train was going to Austria, to Mauthausen, through different uh ways. And uh\nmany...there was snow. It was bitter cold and with high snow. And the Poles, the Polish\nprisoners, they jumped from the train. Yes, from train. It was an open train, but the SS men\nhad a platform on the back, a platform. They had the two wagons, two person wagons, on the\nplatform from planks; and they had lights, reflectors, and they had machine guns...in\ncurves..many poles jumped in curves and so we came to Austria. The train came through my\nnative land of Czechoslovakia, in the city Ostrava--which I knew very good, coal mines and\nso on. I known it's not far from my home. So there was a situation that I, the detail I will give\nyou brochure, there was a situation where it was possible to escape, yes The train stopped\nthere, and they make on the sideline a train, yes, it was not free then. And they make a rumor\nthere, the Germans, that the train is bearing the Germans who were bombed from the Allies,\nand they are telling them they are putting them to death. They would not tell that they are\nprisoners. And in Ostrava you have, there are some over-the-train bridges, and uh, the\npopulation told that there are Germans and they mobilized some Red , you know,\nRed Cross, the charity. And this charity came with two kettles of coffee or something and\nwould help to their own countrymen as they are told that are bombed out, the Germans. And\nwhen the prisoners, so these kettles, so they try to jump, and the SS men make a barrier and\nwould not allow the contact that when these charity men, and this, and so when the\nguard came nearer and nearer, and we also jumped with my son, he was eleven years old,\nfrom this, and once I saw there is no SS men. They shrank (ph) together, but they, they\nprohibit, should prohibit the contact between these prisoners, they would that the prisoners\nshould go back to the, the tracks and they should not make contact with these charity men\nwith these kettles. And when I saw there is nobody, so I run away. It was midnight. There\nwas shooting and so I, I didn't care. We were going, and running and running with my son\nand so we put off this prisoners\u2019 clothes and underneath we have a good civil organized from\nKanada, and so it was night, 1t was curfew, and we, we saw a pit and in this pit there was this\ncolony of miners. Yes, the miner, the miners. And we saw this small, small...",
        "Q: You saw what? I'm sorry.",
        "A: Uh, we saw some small houses. Yes, family houses of miners, and in so was a very light, a\nvery small light...of light. It was...you know. And I dared to knock on the door. There came,\nand...a woman, and I asked her if we can get some help. And I spoke with the dialect of this\ncountry; and my son was there. So he let us inside, and he was a widow and had two sons.\nThey were preparing for a shift to miner to make. So if they believed or not, I don't know;\nbut they asked, I told we were working in Germany, yes, workers. And also my very dear\nwife, I told my wife was sealed off and we couldn't take her, and is my child, and I\nwill take him to the grandparents which are not far from here, Zarywa (ph). I knew the whole\nvicinity, yes. So they were nice to us. We could wash and so. And they, I asked how the train\nis going there and there, and they gave me a very good advice. But at the time there was\nmobilized the, the, men, they were digging anti-tank, uh, anti-tank uh graves for...",
        "Q: Did you see them?",
        "A: Yes. And every manpower is very needed. So, and before on the, in the railway station, they\nwere full of pick axes and shovels, so I took a pick axe and shovel and I am going with this\ntrain who is going to the Valasske Mezerici village, yes. And I, this was the city, Valasske\nMezerici, where I studied.",
        "Q: What is the name of the town?",
        "A: Valasske Mezerici.",
        "Q: O.K.",
        "A: I studied there my high school. So I thought maybe...maybe I will get there. And I came to\nthis city, to this town, yes, so I saw, I have no even idea if I would make this digging, so I\nneed a proof that I am a citizen, and so I have nothing. So I phoned to my friend, to Vsetin,\nmy native, native uh city, where I was native, and before the war I was in connection as I\ntold you to this, to transmit, to help this crossing of the borders, and this man who was\nenterprise man, and he was also involved in this. But I didn't knew if he was catched or not\ncatched, but nevertheless I knew him. And I checked in the phone book and still his firm was\nthere, yes. So I phoned. And he answered. I told him the slogan, yavor, yavor (ph), was the\nslogan, yes.",
        "Q: Slogan. O.K.",
        "A: Yes, but he, yavor (ph), yes, but he recognized me on my voice. And he [said], \"Erich, you\nare here? Where are you?\" \"So in Mezerici (ph).\" \"I will come on the next train.\" And he\ncame. With the next train, he gave us money, he gave us these cards for food, yes, rations,\ncards and he brought with a hiding place, yes, 1t was a hiding place in mountains.\nHe had some connections. We must, we changed twice or something, but there we survived,\nalso with my son, and I, on this hiding, I started to write on this book, The Death Factory\n(ph), which was published in '46 in Prague and later translated in many languages, and so on.\nThis was the first book on Auschwitz, with the plan. I started. But later, my friend, Otto\nKraus (ph), who also ...who came with this transport to another camp and survived, so we\nwere returned to Auschwitz, to Birkenau. We'd hidden some documents there, digged in, so\nwe found, we gave it to the court, to the Polish court, to the Narodny Nationale (ph) Tribunal\n(ph). And we were first witness in this court, , against this Hoss and against forty\nothers , as witnesses. And so from this, we made The Death Factory. And it was the first\nbook...no, later, later. So we survived. So look, so I can give you some bibliography where I\nwrote most of this.",
        "Q: Hold the bibliography for a little bit. We've got a little time. Tell me, take, I know, I'm\ninterested in two things for the tape.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: One is, could you tell me about Poland after the war? And the second was the trial itself.",
        "A: Oh, Czechloslovakia after the war. O.K. I lived twenty years after the Communist [takeover].\nI was persecuted then later in Czechloslovakia, therefore I escaped. When you must known\nthat in '68 I was in danger, when the Prague Spring. Was, you know, the Prague Spring. So I\nwas involved in the Jewish community to educate some Jewish people.

        "Q: This is your second wife? What happened to your first wife?",
        "A: As I told you, with this un...when this was the evacuation, the liquidation of the Czech\nfamily camp, yes. So first they were saved, they were in this epidemic block, which was\n. But then it was a second...there came a second transport with the same purpose; and\nafter they should also go to be liquidated. Then in the last moment, they decided\nthey will...they will make a selection, that they needed the manpower, yes. And they selected\nthe people who were without, women in the...without children. And so I persuaded my wife\nshe tell she is without. She had this son; but I promised I will save him. I didn't knew how,\nbut nevertheless it succeeded later.

It was not built up the whole; only part of it. And the part what was\nbuilt up is exactly in The Death Factory. There is exact point on the day before the\nevacuation, how far it was. That's enough?",

        "Q: The other things we'll copy.",

It was just tightly under on the border. So and this I had the possibility to manipulate in\nthe woods, and I knew this so, so some friends came to me and asked me I should take some\npeople who were very engaged in this and so I brought them to the place that I knew they\nwill be brought to, through their borders illegally.",

There was some I don't\nknow, uh, there was, anyway, when you are going up, stairs. And the stairs are creeking (ph)\nwith mud and so, and one SS man stood up and the other SS man followed us underneath the\nstairs and he asked me I should like a snake, I should creep (ph), you know like a snake to\nthese, on the stairs. And he beat me with this roll (ph) and so when I came to the top, so the\nSS man was at the top, he hit bucket of water, yes, and he took the water against me, so I\ngliched (ph) on this and so I make it two or three times, till I couldn't walk. Then they took\nme up to their room where they are making guards, and they gave me two bucket of water. I\nshould uh I should keep them, and they was very heavy, and they took cigarettes and they\nmake the cigaretttes extinguish on my breasts, yes, and so I cried and I, I fell and I lost my\nconscious. Yes. And soon and then they poured on me water like when they come to me they\nput me on a cot (ph) a huge book (ph) of marmalade (ph) and they\nbeat on this thing, on this thing, and it was a noise, a noise that I thought I will be crazy. And\nthen I still left, uh, lost my conscious, and they still put water on me, and then they told me,\nnow you dirty Jew, so you must wash yourself, you are dirty as a Jew. And so they\ndessimated me. I didn't know what happened with me. I was like , like a berifted (ph). And\nwhen I washed myself, and from the hairs it was dirty, with this, with this marmalade. So\nthey told me now we will go to the reception. In the beginning they may have guards very\nexactly it was 39. What will you do when they are asking you what they you are black. I had\nsome blue on my, yes, so I wouldn't, I didn't understand that. So they told me, you will say\n. If you are asked what did you fall, yes, did you fall, ;\nrepeat it. Then I came to this reception room, office, the SS men, and some prisoners and\nthey took me there and they asked me for the card and then they asked me wherefore you\nhave this black uh, this black spots. I told them, . So they laughed. . Then\nthey take me to this, to the great prison cell that was about twenty, thirty prisoners, and they\ntold me they they had some of them also had similar experience. And the next morning, we\ncame for a doctor; yes, we should be checked up, and how we are healthy and so. And so we\nstand naked, and the nurse, which was a prisoner doctor, look at me, and he told me, look,\nyou have here something, hernia, you know what is. But I had it never, so I didn't knew what\nit is. And he touched it here and it took uh pain. Yes. I told him what happened, how from\nyou have it, and so I told him. And I told all, tell it to the doctor, yes. I have, I didn't\nundertstand what he mean. I came for a German doctor, yes, a young German doctor, and so\nI, you there, he told me, Jew, and so are you healthy and so. And I told yes, I had hernia.\n\"Where from you have it?\" So I told the , , you know, the guards make me with a\nstrong sport, yes, exercise. And he called . What, the guard. Call\nthe guard. He was crying, he was very upset. Then they came, these two SS men that made\nwith me this spot, you know, and he told, look, this Jew is complaining that you make this\nthing yesterday, this uh strong exercise, and he got this hernia And they go, what, believe\nthis Jew and they give me a kick, they give me a slip, and I was lying on the, on the ground,\nthey standing in fron of me. And told, it seems that you didn't get, you didn't understand, it 1s,\nyou hurt it already, you are lying, Jews always lie, and you hurt it already, and yes, I am the\nwitness. And so they were standing in front of me and I saw them and the doctor was\nlaughing with hands, and then so I saw what can I do. So he asked me what therefore, so I\ntold yes, I was lying and so are the Jews. Otherwise they would bring me once. He told me\nlook this, if you are released maybe you can bear it on your own cost, and so on. And so I,\nbut at this time my wife, I could write yes her. And so I write her a letter and she had an\nadvocate, and also the firm you know that I was occupied, where I was, I had a good\nposition, they need an explanation, an explanation of how their deliveries (ph) were and so\non, and they didn't prove that I am guilty. So they have no proof, only the uh telling this. So I\nwas released for the operation. Yes, my wife and the, it came, this lawyer came and spoke\nwith me also with this doctor. And the operation, and they released me in August under the\ncondition that I am under supervision of uh Gestapo and then I came to this firm and I give\nexplanation and I was operated. They operated me and after the operation I was from Vsetin,\nI was...I couldn't leave there. They... I could live only in the village, in the village near Vsetin\nabout twenty kilometers where my wife also lived with me and I could work only as a\nworker--manual work, yes. And so I worked, and I must always...every week I must give a\nreport to the Gendarmerie state police station that I am here where I was. But after a year,\nthey came and arrested me. Yes. They arrested me. It's true. I still kept some connection with\nthe underground.",
        "A: Yes. But I still kept, I don't know, somebody had complained, but after a year they came to\nthis, to my flat in this Novi Rozenkov, the village and they arrested me and I, and also my\nbrother-in-law Milan Kulka. And then I went, I came to Dachau, as a preventive, a\npreventive custody. They told if I would be released I am a danger, I endanger the\nrevolution, the peaceful revolution of the German and so, so it was only an excuse. And so, I\nwas so-called a political prisoner. But I was still a Jew, yes. But it keep their rolls something,\nthere was some political reasons, I still had the file at the court, yes, and they still, the court\nwas interested where I am for the case, if 1t would be involved some more people who I was\ninvolved in this action, so they still would have contact for the prisoner, even if they were\nJews who they arrested. It was the action of the political prison for political reason as\nopposed to the mass, mass deportations and so. So this is only that you see then I had a good\ntraining for this, all this. How it was, and also I had this connections, you know, also when I\ncame to Dachau. There was also some people who were already there, and they had\nconnections to the underground, yes, to the communists, and so and I always find these\nconnections. Yes, I could find always these, and this helped me a lot of this.",
        "A: Oh yes. The connections helped me. So first, I was, the second time I was, before I came to\nDachau, I was in the prison, Gestapo prison, in the Kavnitzovi Koleie (ph), in Brno, the\ncapital of Moravia. Yes. Kaunitzovi Koleie (ph) means the communist college. It was a\ncollege for the students and they transformed it into a Gestapo prison. Yes. And we came\nthis, there were mainly a communist uh, they try it, the whole communist net to developp\nand they told some Jews about it and Jews that we should have their service, of you know, to\nclean, and to get to this good food. Yes, under the supervision of the SS men. And so we also\nhad also to clean and there many offices of the SS interrogation officers. And we have to\nclean in the morning this, and they had a radio there yes. So it was not there, so we listened\nto the radio what are the, the news, and so we have had what is the development in the war,\nyes in the beginning - how it would development (ph). And we would have BBC\nyes. For instance, they also had BCC. And when in the morning, at 6 o'clock there was\nnobody in the office, yes, so we took and there was also a hospital in this, which the\nprisoners were brought in the hospital because they beat the prisoners and they were not in a\nstage to be interrogated so a prison hospital. How's that? And there was a doctor Primar\nHorn (ph) from Nihlava (ph), and I told him all these messages which we had from this\nradio, yes, and he was interested I should tell him always, we knew when the prisoners came,\nthe new prisoners, so the SS men told you will take these prisoners to, to a cell and we\nbrought them their food but 1t was always in the, we were guarded when we did by an SS\nman. Whenever, as we could, always a few words mentioned to this. And so, one...\nQ. Back up a second. The doctor was part of the resistance?",
        "A: Yes, yes. The doctor was part of the resistance, but he was also the prisoner doctor.",
        "A: A prisoner doctor, yes, but he was a part of that, and so once came a prisoner named\nAndrusek from Dachau, yes. From Dachau. And he was a very, he was very stout, looked\nvery good, yes, and uh I was also we were for the disposition of SS men if they needed me to\nclean their boots and to clean something they need. And I have had when they, in the door,\nthey ask him how that you are looking so well, to these prisoners. And he told, look, when I\nam, uh, I comprehend when I have, understand the Furher's, so I am\nalso look good for a prisoner. Yes, I am, I make a good . And when this, so I\nthought that this a spy yes, but when he came out so the SS officer told to the others, look,\nthere is a prisoner - 1t is not so bad in Dachau. Look this prisoner should tell to the SS how\nhe, it's good when they are pursuing the orders of the SS. And the name, I remember the\nname Andrusek and I told this name to this doctor who was in the resistance, and when he, it\nwas like he was electrified. Andrusek, look Andrusek must first come to the Revier uh, this\nhospital here before he is interrogated. It 1s very important for us. So he asked me that I\nshould give him an ampoule (ph), you know, in the bread, when we were distributing the\nbread, and so I do and look we will get ample, take it. There is, uh, and I told him the name,\nand he got fever, yes, he got fever, so he was given to this, he was taken , they put on the\ndoors that he is ill, and they measured him the fever and they took him to this hospital to the\ndoctor who was in the resistance to the Horn. And they instructed him more what he should\ndo, and so on yes. They instructed him before he was here. Yes, he came from Dachau, but\nhe was involved in this communist net. So later, when he was a prisoner, I asked him how,\nwhat are you doing and he told, look, I am also in hospital in Dachau where so, I mean he\nwas a prisoner, but he was a nurse in Dachau hospital, in the concentration camp, yes. And\nhe was involved in these communist activities so they took him away and asked the Gestapo\nthat they should have an interrogation and they should uh, they thought they will get from\nhim more information about the net of the communists. And he told me, and in the time I\nalready signed the to Dachau, that means they gave me the for\nDachau, so I asked him what I should do when I came to Dachau. And he gave me address\nof the, some man, who later became a Minister of Interior in the\nCzecholovia government. And he was a person in this, in this, and he was a scriber, you\nknow, a clerk, as a prisoner he was in charge of this administrative work, in the,\nadministrative, in this prison, in this prison hospital. And so when I came there so I told him\nand he was interested how and so on and he gave me aid, what should I do\nwhen, when it came the transport. He told me, look, you will\n. Yes, will you, no. So in Dachau, the truth in my time when\nit was 1940, it was in the autumn 1940, so when we came in Dachau, all the Jews came out\nin this company, penal squad, Jews, in the penal uh, uh, penal squad, there was a\nspecial penal barrack, uh, penalty...",
        "A: ..a penalty company for Jews. All the Jews are marked in the penalty sign--a red uh...uh\nopposite of their...of their Jewish David Star. They got a...",
        "A: A black badge, and they came to this penalty block. There were about two hundred Jews.\nYes, and the penalty block was, there, it was a special, very cruel block master\n(ph), a non-Jew, a communist. But he was a sadist. He was already since\n1935 in the camp, and they killed what you will hardly believe your, now with cleanness\n(ph) in the, with tidyness, with cleanness they killed the people.",
        "A: I explain. The block was very nice, yes. There was about, there was divided in two parts, a\nliving room and a bedroom, yes. The living room had, the floors were lacked (ph), you\nknow, lacquer. Yes. There were water closets, and these uh, tables, and\nthe people, every man has a very small cart, yes, if he must get his raiments, yes, his clothes,\nand we had a nerostar (ph), fork, knife and spoon, and even if we eat in this block in the\nevening and the morning, so we must took all these three nerostar (ph) (utensils), yes,\nutensils, and in five minutes it must be clean and given back in this spint (ph). And they\nwas the service of the, who helped the block master (ph) they help, yes,\nthey are prisoners. And if they found something tiny which not so advanced (ph), he got\nsome penalty. Either he didn't get much food, or he must kneel (ph) or he has penalty work\nand so on. This is one. Secondly, there was the most . We were going in this\nroom, this uh schlaf (ph) room, the night when we were. . No, there was a day room and a\nbed, night room. Yes, we had such and so, yes, yes, we get such a\nand we must slept there with the . . and the beds were very nice. The blanket military is. But\nwhat was the, we couldn't even the cleanness was so that we couldn't enter the block in our\nshoes, boots or sandals. That was very, the shoe were, the boots were very different, very -\nwe only could in the scarbats (ph) come, that the lacquered floor will not be spoiled, yes.\nAnd once, and before the block there are and the shoes were\nput in, yes, and so everybody had put their shoes in, and when he was going from the block\nhe was uh, took the boots outside of the block. And then in the midnight once, it, the stubnitz\n(ph) took their whistles and Juden , you make it dirty and now it will be\nmade sport (ph). And they beat us and when we to the court, and the court was full of mud,\nand in the panic in the house, that nobody could took exactly his shoes from this\n, So some took uh wrong shoes, some didn't took any shoe, and now they\nmake sport. Neither of these , you know, different to, like a\nsnake...now then, the beat us. (The policemen beat you?) Yes, the prisoners,\nthe prisoners beat us. (The prisoners beat you?) Yes, the prisoners were creatures (ph), yes,\nand the SS men looked, and once he come, look, back in the blocks. So back in the blocks,\nthe were dirty from this mud and the shoes we put in this, in this\n. And some we were dirty. So he took, you must make it clean, half an hour,\nall must be cleaned. And so we go in this washroom, and where the clothes and water was,\nyes, to make us clean, and also the, the __, the uh floor, yes. But then they listed us and\nchecked the, who was clean and can go in this, to sleep in his bed. And the blockeldester\n(ph) looked and counted (ph) and then if he noticed that there 1s some dirty on there still on\nthe floor, up and to lick, lick, yes. And he (to lick it), to lick the dirt, you know, this. There is\nsomebody would not, so he, he put him to the floor, he stayed him here with his foot, and he\nmake it so long as he didn't comprehend and somewhere that, and were brought to the\n_____ house, yes. So, by the cleanness they took us, they killed the people. And on the day we\nshould work so the work was useless. We should put the stones from one heap to another.\nWe should snow (ph) in our mountains from one heap to another. It was a chain. And the\nkapos beat us, yes. So always there were two, three killed or were wounded to brought to the\ninfirmary, so this was the Dachau. And so, I was there about a half a year and I told it to the\nSkopsiva who was on this infirmary in this prison, this infirmary, and he told me look, you\nshould, when there will be a first transport, you should, should ask that you should be sent\nfor a transport. And uh, there was a transport from Neuengamme, yes. And so we came to\nNeuengamme.",
        "A: Yes. So we were already, in Dachau we formed about a group of five friends from\nCzechlosavakia. The names you are interested. Yes, the names are Otto Kraus (ph), the\nformer coauthor of my books; my brother-in-law, Milan Kulka-- brother of my wife, or first\nwife; and Ernst Schon--he was my far cousin from Verski Brod (ph); Aaron Rosenfeld (ph).\nThat was that. And so we were four. This such a group, and I was five. And we always help\neach other, yes, in these different situations. And so we came to this camp, Hamburg\nNeuengamme. This was an . It was the out building camp, yes. They\nreally needed very hard work. Yes. They didn't beat. If you could work, they let you early\nalive. But if you couldn't, so they put you in the hospital and either you cured or you died.\nYes, so it was, but when we came to this camp there was opposite to Dachau. There was\nnothing there. We had no beds. We lie on this straw. There was no floor. The floor was only\nthe mud, yes, the pressed mud, yes. And we lie on this straw and when we were going a\ncommando, especially Jews, they were commando (ph) Elbe. It means it was a\nElbe , a river, a huge river which was coming from Czechoslovakia to in the\nmountains of Bohemia, and it is is going to the sea in Hamburg. And there were several\nbranches of this Elbe and one of these rivers were full of mud. Was made to be, to carry the\nboats, you know, to clean it. And so we were about command of more than thousand, mainly\nJews, who were going every day, maybe two or three kilometers far from this Hamburg\nNeuengamme, from this camp, to the place where we make this, to clean this from mud, this\nElbe canal, this channel. They would make a channel. They were building a huge fabrik\n[Ger: factory] of bricks. And they should, the bricks should be on the , on the\nwaterway brought over. And there were different, first there were some canes (ph) your\nknow, canes, some small ships, you know, when the barges brought the mud on this canes\n(ph) this small ship, small boat, yes. The boats are full of this mud, and we had, like in the\nancient time, there were planks we had with the ships that brought this mud from the canes\nto the . Yes, they were very deep, the canes, these boats were deep. And on the\nopen, the boats were, were planks, very strong planks, and their carts, and on these carts, this\nmud which we brought when the ship, when the shoals (ph), on the shoals, it was on two\nrivers, yes, we were only half standing in mud. And they brough with these carts, this uh\nmud to the shore, yes, and it was long, very long, and from this shore, there were make an\nelipse (ph), maybe of one kilometer, an elipse (ph) route with planks of about 30 centimeters,\nyou know just about 50 centimeters, five centimeter high and 30 centimeters wide and it was\nmake an elipse road. And on this elipse road, yes, they make, they put about three hundred,\nthree hundred uh prisoners with carts, hand carts, yes. And when, when this mud was put on\nmaybe 50 meters long and about 3 meters high, and they in running they were going and\nthere must be loaded the full cart, all the prisoners loaded their cart, and they were going on\nthis, on this road which were, the purpose of this was that there were gardens, and uh fields,\nand they make the fields should bring this very fruitful, uh fruitful mud of Elbe yes, they\nshould be more fruitful their gardens and their fields. They should be better food then.",
        "A: Yes, brought it up. And it was in there riding, you must keep up this, the cart, yes. And\nrunning for another. And so it was, it was just a circle of death. Yes. Todes Runde (ph) And\nso the only, the only uh rest was when somebody couldn't and he collapsed. That you\ncouldn't go, only you could keep the cart on this 30 centimeter wide plank road. So he\ncollapsed. And when he collapsed, so the whole road collapsed, couldn't go. So the kappos\ncame and they beat this man who collapsed. You will go or not go, and so maybe he make\nsome two or three rounds and he collapse and there were every day twenty, thirty dead\nwhich we brought in the camp exhausted, yes, from this. So our group of five we survived in\nthis way - that the possibility of us if you could read the shower to give the\nroad to the carts, to run the carts it was very exhausting, it was very hard that somebody\ncould keep it without uh rest. So we always could uh changed. The kappos allowed that if\nsomebody of our five, un voluntarily he told I will give up my place in the\nshovel (ph) to this man with the cart. And so we could give it up. Do you understand?",
        "A: So, and so we could survive, yes. But later it was very hard and my brother-in-law, he\ncollapsed and he came to the infirmary and he was, he caught the dysentary and he died. He\ndied in September 1941, yes. Yes. And later I also get uh, poison, blood poison, from this\ndirty mud, and I had uh, , blood poison, so I still have a sign here. And they would\namputate my leg. But still I have a connection with this, from this infirmary, of a nurse who\nwas connected with the Skopsiva, knew him. And uh, I told him that going, he make me, he\ngave me something that a hole which was put in this. It came out and I was\ncured. And then after somebody was cured, so he got as they needed to the working power,\nyes, So also to Jews they give a to spare him a little. , 1t meant, it should\nbe spared it should be easier work. But for Jews the easier work that you must, uh\nbeat the stones, to small pieces, to silt (ph), but, and in every weather, it 1s raining and not\nraining, it was for Jews. But, luckily, as my name was Erich Schon at the time, so they told\nthat I am a German, so they give me the work for non-Jews from German. And it was the\nyou know, to repair the socks for SS men. It was a hugeh and so I got this\nwork and in two months I could restore my health. And, but, and then it came, there came\nUkrainians (ph) like in Poland, and so on, and this old guard ought to be changed. Yes,\nand the Russians and the prisoners of\nwar and so. And so our group get the better work, yes. And I also can, yes I had to do with\nwood, so I told them, carpenter, so I could help by the building of a bunker and later I get\nthe, they built a factory, they built near the camp they built a new camp. And they kept the\nmarket(ph) at as a prisoners war camp. Yes. And there were the same\nbarrack, and firms which were in Hamburg brought their machinery inside and they\nused the prisoners that they work on the machinery that they make for uh the U-boats, you\nknow, under the boats. Some machinery. And for Jews it was not, Jews, only non-Jews. But\nlater when they still needed us, and under the surveillance of you know of\n, the military in Germany. But still we came, we were in the uh direction of\nthe SS only by night, but on the day we were in this factory which was nearby. And the\nGermans, they were, they were interested in work, in really work. And so they couldn't beat\nus, yes. When they would have, and so I learned some skill in this. And later 1t came, I was\nthere still till the end of October, 1t came an order from Himmler, you know, the boss of the\nSS, that all the Jews should be concentrated in Auschwitz, from all the camps. And so it\ncome the order also to Neuengamme and so they have bought the Wehrmacht, not these five\nJews, we have all five, they are specialists, I will not give them up, give them free, only\nwhen I get uh specialists uh specialists which have the same qualifications as\nthis, as we were. Yes. But he told it an order from Wermacht and so Litkmayer (ph) in\ncharge of the SS men, SS men at Lagerfield (ph), he was very furious, but later he brought\nfrom Auschwitz five non-Jewish uh locksmiths or some that were in, and we were\nexchanged. He told, now you have uh, your some faharbeiter (ph), you experts in this, and he\ngave us free. And so we came to Auschwitz. We were five. Yes, we came to, in Auschwitz,\nthey told us you are very important people and you will get built your own house in the east\nand so they brought us with a special train, with two SS men in guard, in the depart we were\nonly five. ( in a special train ?). No. In a personal (ph) train. Look, first we got all\nour civilian clothes, my watch I got, and all we get, and we were still political prisoners so\nwe didn't and then we have a code message with the resistance and so on, and\nand they give us also food and a special SS man came and brought us in the department of\nthis speed train. And so, he told us, and we believe it, look you are going to the east. There is\na special uh, uh, a special uh building for Jews, where they will live, and you are\nspecialists, so you will have a very good life, and he showed us a uh, card\nfor the important of the transport of these special prisoners, it is necessary to use this speed\ntrain. And we were in the department, a special department, we have this un, and\nthere was an SS man with, and uh, uh, at the door, and the SS man ordered, the officer, not\nthe officer felt we were surgeons (ph), and they were seated opposite us and they were nice\nto us and we believed him and told him, look we will be nice so if you promise me you will\nnot make some attempts to escape so I will take off your handcuffs and so he brought us to\nBerlin and he gave us car fare and we came to an other train, and we came to Auschwitz.\nFive. In Auschwitz, if the people, the prisoners from Auschwitz they talk to us. In\nAuschwitz , SO they are killing the Jews by gas.",
        "A: It was in uh '42, in autumn, uh, I think in September. But I couldn't understand this. What\n. Yes. I couldn't imagine how they are killing the Jews by gas. But I experience\nsomething in Neuengamme. In Neuengamme, especially the Russian and the Ukranian who\ndidn't understand any German, so when they were ill, so they came to the infirmary, when\nthey were healthy, and they were warned. They should not go. But they, they, they believed\nyes, it is infirmary, it is very good. So when they have fever, very high fever, and they were\nsuspicious of typhoid, so they make them with ink pen number here or\nhere, and give them injection in the heart and they were immediately dead and they, the\ncorpses they laid them in uh mortuary. This we knew, yes. That but otherwise in\n- there were some numbered prisoners, with numbers and this we experienced.\nSo when we came to this Auschwitz, so first, we felt the smell, and we told, ah, this is the\nsoot from mines maybe, so what the rumor. And then they give us to another SS man, |\nthen they beat us in and we must, were running about two or\nthree, in the camp, Auschwitz main camp. And we, so hugh camp, with these hundreds and\nhundreds of lights of electric bulbs on this wire, on this barbed wire fences. It was night, yes\nwhen we came to this camp, to this Auschwitz, and uh, it was early of the hours after the,\nthey put us in the cellar, yes, in the night where we slept. And in the even, in the morning,\nthey came, they came, the Polish prisoners, to us and they wondered where from you came,\nonly a group of five, who are you. And so they were interested in us. And so when they saw\nthat we have all this stuff, they told, look, give me this stuff, and I will give it to camp. They\nwill take it anyway from you and if you will give it to me I will give it to the camp and you\nwill get some food. You will see how nice they will be to you. So mostly, and I have golden\nOmega watch, and they give also to me, and I had this Omega watch, give to somebody the\nwatch, I will give it to and you will get bread and so. So I didn't know what to do.\nThey were very friendly. They were prisoners as we were but all prisoners in form. The next\nmorning we are claiming (ph) to be accepted by SS, yes, to make the who we\nare and so. And there are SS men. And this prisoners, these Polish which were visiting us in\nthis cellar, they were with him. They belonged to this squad, so-called Politische Sheiber\n(ph). They were helping to introduce to making to work, you know all these forms to fill out,\nwho you are, what you are and they were .",
        "A: No. They were 1n his command, and he was the boss of them. And so when I came to this, so\nhe had the list also from uh which were probably all the belongings which. And he\nwrote where have you got the watch. I told him I lost it. What, you lost it. And they gave me\na slip. And so I saw this man who was, who was behind him uh took this watch from me and\nhe make so therefore I told. And when he slapped me, so I told him, look this man\nasked me for the watch, I give him. What . Yes on the order , yes, yes, he\ntook. So he told something to the SS man. Maybe he will give it to him, and it was O.K. And\nso it was. And now we were stripped naked, I will remember how it was in the prisoners.\nThis was my experience. And then, we had some, in Hamburg we could have got in one\nmonth about twenty marcs, yes, from how much from friends. There was a kantin (ph),\nmarks, German mark.",
        "A: From, from my sister. At that time my wife still was in, in Rozenkow and my sister-\nin-law was also there. We could write. From this camp we could write, yes.",
        "A: By mail, not directly. Jews couldn't. But there were non-Jews who had no money. So they\nwrote to their people, look, make contact with this and this, and my wife and sister-in-law\ngave the money to these non-Jews and they sent, and were delighted when they get forty\nmarks, twenty, yes. And so these twenty marks I still spent, but I gave it to the I\npick it on my . And so others had it in their toothpaste. But they took all away, but this\nthey didn't discover, that I have. And so I came the first of this group, for under the shower\nand there was a man who took my hand and tattooed a number. . Yes,\nthis, and I took this number.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, and so in this moment, I thought, it came that I will be killed injection, the final\ninjection in my heart and I will be dead. As this I experience in Neuengamme, how they do\nit. Yes. And so, uh, no, it had nothing order came, also this number and so on and we came\non a block in the Auschwitz main camp when we were uh, vetoed (ph) to these people,\nPolish people, look, you took from us away these things, and we are old prisoners, so you\ncannot handle us as we are so low in camp. And he told, what three years, there are seven\nyears camp and in fourteen days they were away . Yes, they killed\nthem. Yes. After seven years, the, you were three. So we came on the block when we were,\nah, I forgot to tell you one thing. In this, Neuengamme in this factory where we worked for\nthe, there was also Jew, a German Jew who was a black-yellow, it was asocial worker,\nasocial element. We were told that he was rassenshender (ph). He was arrested for to have\nconnections with the Aryan women, yes. But he was arrested also since 1935 in the\nHe was very old hefling and he was in connection with the\n. The Germans who were in the prisons, they took him on the camp as\nfrom the profession, criminal profession. They had green winkle, green triangle, yes.\nBut this, the Germans, the SS used them to bring in the camp, and they had the great\npositions, blockaltester, lageraltester . They were the bosses. They were prisoners, but the\nbosses, yes.",
        "A: Yes\nTAPE #2",
        "A: No. I am telling you that you, I didn't wrote it in the books so detailed, yes, but I now, when I\nmake some lectures, so I know how the people ask for details, so therefore I will explain it\nto you. Many people ask me, how did you survive?",
        "A: Yes, and this was this moment for survivers, yes, this Willie, this , this\nWilly Nahman (ph). It was a lot for us, yes, this Willy Nahman (ph).",
        "A: O.K.",
        "A: His name was Willy Nahman. He was from I remember from Hamburg. He was uh, the age\nof 30, but he was arrested already, he was a German Jew, and he was arrested in 1945, first\nin Dachau and then in Neuengamme and then in Sachsenhausen. Sachsenhausen was another\nconcentration camp. And he was connected with the groups of. .",
        "A: 35, 1935, he was a German, yes. And he was arrested in a group of , It means the\ncriminals, yes, in Hamburg. And they cooperated together. For them it was not important\nthey were Jews or non-Jews. They get together, work extremely hard. And he was involved\nin this uh, activities of these criminals, and they were friends, very close friends, before and\nalso in the camp. But then they divided the Jews, as Willy Nahman was a Jew and sent him\nto uh, to Neuengamme and later to Auschwitz. But as a prisoner, for this also, later these\ncriminals from Hamburg, from Sachsenhausen, about thirty of these criminals, they had\nchoose them, and brought them to Auschwitz, and make of them kappos and the\nblockeldester. You know, the bosses of the, which helped. And so when we came on this\nblock, and Willy Nahman with us, he was also, he took a number I know, 720777, yes 47, 47\nwas his number. He had, we were given the numbers, I still remember exactly. And so we,\nwe were on this block and on this there block some new prisoners coming to the deportees\nfrom Belgium, I remember. And these were all prisoners. The blockaltester told you will\ntrain these new prisoners in how they should mitseup, mitseup (ph), how they should keep\nthe discipline in the camp. And you will get a little, a bit more of their soup for this trip (ph).\nAnd when we are train, this soldier blockr master (ph) came, you know, the boss who was\nand he saw the Willy the Nahman, oh , you old friend, you\nare here, how are you, and he told, he uh booked (ph) him and kissed him and they were\nfriends, and yes. And Willy go, look, this , look the Poles they are bad to us, they beat\nus, they, uh, they get the property from us, the Poles yes, the Polacks. They were all against\nthe Poles. They were not very accepted from the Germans you know. And so he told no,\nlook, so I will give you the best of beds, yes, do us and you will get food and so. And so, we\nwere, that was the first step. And now we were on the second floor. You know there are\nthree bunks all there. And we were on the third, and now we on the first row, and we saw\nhow the stubnitz you know what is a stubnitz. These were the aids of the blockaltester the\nprisoners who prepared the food, who they kept for cleanness, who punished, yes, who were\nvery severe to the, and they were aid of the - there were about four or five these prisoners,\nstubnitz. It 1s the aids. They were prisoners, but were the aids of the blockaltester and they\ndid what he would. So we knew that always when they were prepared the food for them, so\nthey cut a little of bread, they cut a little of margarine, they cut a little of marmalade, yes.\nAnd they give smaller portions to the, and what they make they organized for the\nblockaltester vodka, spirits, liquers, and sausages and so. And they brought him, uh, he had\nhis own uh room in the block, yes. And they brought him always, he got the full, a good\nsupper and all. So they take care. And he didn't care what they are doing with these\nprisoners, if they gave them the full portions, you know, the full rations or not. And we saw\nit from the, although we knew this practice already from Neuengamme, and we were curious\nif they will also steal it for us, for our rations. And we, they manipulated it and they brought\nuh, you know, they have that butter toast they make, chips of the margarine which they stole,\nand they make this chips for the block master (ph) and they eat and they also give to the\nblockaltester yes, the sausage. And we told them, and we saw they didn't stop before on the\nrations for us, they also kept. So we told them, look, it's not true. We are all heflings , and so\nwe, you should not betray us. Yes. Oh, you are Jews. So they were very harsh to us, and very\nbad. And so, they give us a very hard work - we should take from the kitchen, you know,\nthese kettles that are very heavy, and we should brought these kettles of soup to the block.\nYes, it was very heavy, and we should get them a little soup more. And we saw how they are\nare handle and smuggle these spirits and all these things and from the\nwe observed. And so when we were going to this uh and brought these very heavy trunks\n(ph), with these kettles yes, it was 200 liters, so once there was a lageraltester, you know,\nlageraltester , was the boss of the whole camp, the prisoner boss, and he also was a criminal\nand really was going and he was, he Willy let fall these trunks, and he yes, and\nthey meeted them, and they were friends, and he asked him, look what is, what is, how are\nyou and so on. He told look these boys they are betraying us and they are cutting off this and\nthis and this. He told this and there, when he told, and they are handling spirits. (Spirit is\nliquor.) Liquor. Oh, when he said liquor, what, liquor, where is it. Yes. (Laughter) And he\ncame with two SS men on this, in this project (ph), and they have this liquor, two or three,\nand they really brouhgt them, and they took and they immediately they changed this stubnitz\n(ph) to the penalty company. This Polish. And we should be on there, on there, we were\nreplaced. (You were replaced.) Yes, but this was the career (ph) but the blockaltester didn't\nlike it also and the, we told him, look, we will get your food, your food-vodka or don't care.\nHe shoot him. But that was break through in the Polish heirarchy, and the Poles are very\nangry. The other Poles, you know, very angry that we got such a protection from the\nlageraltester and so on. And so we were in danger. Our blockaltester as well. So he told us,\nlook, there is a camp in Birkenau, it is a nice camp, a new camp, and they are needing for\nslosher (ph) and you are blacksmiths, and so you are in and this is a fantastic\ncamp and there is lying, the money and gold (ph) and money and milk on the street. So he\nwas, but he told the truth. And so we told no, what can we do. And he signed us for the\nBirkenau, all five. And one day there came an assessment at Birkenau, was about three\nkilometers, two miles away from Auschwitz. And we came, the SS men came for us and we\nwas going on that card (ph) of assessment, and first time we saw what he meant. First the\nprisoners, female prisoners, their head was shaved and they looked awful. And when we saw\nthe presence of the hats right, that we should not see them. But we saw them. We were\nshocked. When we saw the first time prisoners, the women prisoners there. In a, a,\n, you know, a situation that we never thought in such an illumining (ph), such a\ndegree. And then we came to this camp and we saw there, there were on the side of the\nstreets, there were great crocks, they were filled with milk, filled with meat, and uh\nand some . SO we saw it, what it is. And then we came to this\ncamp, this Birkenau camp, that was full of mud, yes. There were lying corpses, yes, and we\ncame to a block a nice wood block, and to a Polish blockaltester who this 1s nice, very block,\nand we always thought transport came, and they were gassing people and so were there in\nBrzezinka (ph). There were nothing in this camp. At that time, was no, there\nwere bunkers for the uh camp people that was adapted from a farm house, these two bunkers,\nyes. Behind the camp in the woods, Brzezinka so called, Birken-wood (ph). It was about two\nmiles behind the camp Birkenau. So in this Brzezinka, in forest, there were from the, there\nwas a former village and the village the, the mhabitants of the village were pulled out, and\ntwo farm houses were adapted as gas chamber. Small farmhouses. I have the exactly plans if\nyou will later, I will explain to you. In the death sector I will explain. And they make from\nthese two farm houses gas chambers, yes. Two barraccks where the people took off their\nbelongings and then they were pulled to these gas chambers naked and they were poisoned\nthere, yes, and from this they were pulled out by commander and put in the graves,\nin the uh, mass graves. (Yes). Yes, in the mass graves. It was near and but nobody in the\ncamp, and there was a special squad, special detail Sonderkommando, so called\nSonderkommando, and they were in a special guarded block, yes. And nobody should uh,\nthey should not inter (ph) with other people from the camp. And I also was curious,\ntransport came, and this organization and somebody had some vetment (ph), some clothes,\norganized from this, or some things, or something wearing from transport, where is transport.\nIn Birkenau there it was a , a secret, yes, like a secret. But I was very curious, I\nalways, it was, it took fourteen days or something. (What took fourteen days?) Fourteen\ndays, you know, this situation that we couldn't discover what, how they are killing the\npeople. Yes, it was, it was nobody could come there from the normal prison. It was uh\nfenced. Yes, and so. But always the signs were there yes, and there is rumors. And one day, I\nmust tell you, when we came, so we told to this, there was prisoners, Polish prisoners, who\nhad division of the barrack where you should work, yes, so we came and told we are sloshers\n(ph), here, we are blacksmiths, . Where is your workshop you know, uh , where we\ncan work (place to work), place to work. And they were laughing. What you are crazy, work,\nprisoners, huh, maybe in some future. So what are you from, from . So I told him\nblacksmiths before I was blacksmith. But, so we have no such work now for\nblacksmiths. No work. And so we were on this block and uh, about one week, and uh, we\nwas still not divided into detail you know, and once we were going on this uh, lagerstrasen\n(ph), lager road, and there was a kappo. He was the commander of one thousand prisoners\nwho were maurers, uh learning how to lay the bricks uh and to make it work for building the\nhuge, uh, for the building of this huge crematorium for creamatory which were\nat that time in building, had not been built. (This was '42.) Yes. (1942) '42, yes, in the\nautumn, yes. And so we got going on this street, and once it came such a very nice kappo,\nprisoner, yes, had vetment (ph) according to his measurement. Yes, yes, And now the\n, told Willy, Willy, you are here, you are here. They were friends from this camp\nfrom the Hamburg, this criminal squad and then later in this Dachau and this Sachsenhausen,\nso they look at him, and so what are you doing here. So the Willy Nahman told him, yes, we\nare here, but the Polish they will not give us the work and so what you are slosher (ph). So\nhe was going there, Wiland (ph), the kappo was going with us to this Polish uh clerks, these\nPolish prisoners who make the detail, who make the decision where you should work, yes,\nand he told, look, these all five, I need workers, specialists, they will, uh will take care for\nmy, for my claim which they have some uh . You know, what the maurers had for\nthe uh, what they need for we should sharpen. (Oh, to sharpen knives.) Sharpen knives, and\nthese and this, I need all the five. And he took us five in his commando. (He saved your\nlives?) Yes. He was a maurer commando, a brick layers commando, and uh maurer, which\nare making the mortars you know, yes, this, so he was a great boss. He was a great\ncommando. Nobody could resist him. He was boss. So yes, I took them, and so they did\nnothing, and O.K., so you are in his commando. And we were in his commando, and he was\nnice to us and he asked, he, uh, he learned us how to organize. So he sent us, we had some\nboxes with some tools, and he sent us where the civil worker worked, you know, the civil,\ncivil worker. And opposite of the prisoners workers, the up building off the camp were many\nprivate firms which were contracted by the SS, and these private firms had so-called civil\nworkers. (Civil workers?) Civil workers who were the experts in some food, in some, some\nexperts in some disciplines, yes. To make roads and to build this and this. And this had a\nbunch from Gestapo and they were always guarded by an SS man and they could tend\ntwenty prisoners, to their help, and auxiliary prisoners. Yes, but it was forbidden that they\nshould not speak direct to the prisoners, only this guard, yes. And the guard always was, they\nonly give orders what to do, but we should never speak with them. But nevertheless, this SS\nguard was corrupted from them and from kappos and they went after these people who were\ngassed in gas chambers so all their belongings were brought in a special magazines (ph), yes.\nAnd from these magazines the kappos took it and give it to the civil workers, and they\nbrought eggs, they brought sausages, they brought yes, and this was their, for them. .",
        "A: The civil workers. The civilians. You know, who was, they were in the camp, they were not\nso guarded, and they could get from the farmers and so on, and also money was there, yes.\nSo this, the people who were gassed, they had much money and they were found. And the\nkappos came to this and they had an organization. They knew how to get on this, uh, this\nbelongings, yes. And this, uh this, Winand (ph) he, for instance, he organized the Schnaps\n(ph), this liquor, yes, and he told, look, take this liquor in this uh our box (ph), that we have\nthe tools and bring it to this and this kappo (ph). And we didn't knew how dangerous this is.\nWe didn't know what he send us. So we thought, and we were not catched at this time. So\nwe were, yes, we were in his protection. And as I , SO I have these twenty marks,\nyou still remember, and we told him, so the kappo (ph) 1s so nice to us, yes, and we should\ngive him a present. So we five, our group. So we decided, we did, Willie Nachtman and I,\nwe would go to this Winand (ph), this kappo, he had his own room, and we came to him, and\nuh, he had very good supper with rootgaren (ph), with sausages, and this, this, and we told\nhim, look, you are very nice to us, and we will give you present. And we brought him this,\nthis, this twenty marks. And he laughed and he brought a bundle of and he light his\ncigarette with this, cigarette. See. The shock from him was nothing. A bundle of, of . So he\nlaughed. But he saw that we are , It's O.K., it's O.K., so I will, you can rely on\nme, and so. And so later, and later there was a need of slosher, there was a need of installers,\ntilers, of electricians, and so it came and built, and they make a maintenance squad,\nprisoners maintenance squad. And the uh sharfthrer (ph), an SS man, and he asked us to\nkeep all technical installment in the camp in order. And so he always took a professional for\nevery, and we worked then regularly. We had a, a workshop, and so we knew the\norganization, we had connections to the kappos, and so we observed what is it. So during\nthis two years, this twenty-eight months exactly, so I could observe, and we were going from\none camp to another. There were several camps in Birkenau. And we had a boomshk (ph),\nyou know, a permit, that we are authorized to repair these pipes and this and this and this.\nAnd we always get from this sharfthrer (ph) a letter where we should go. By the time we\ncould choose alone the work where we will go, and we brought him always something, what\nhe would have, a gold or something, what will you bring. He knew, he used us to organize\nfor him. From Kanada (ph), from sonderkommando so. And by this, we, we, the best\n, we had no hunger. We had so many to eat that we could support about twenty\nothers, yes. And when we came in the kitchen, there were in every camp kitchen forty kettles\nof uh steam kettles, where it was cooked, the food for all these prisoners, and uh, they asked\nwe should repair these kettles, and by the time we learned how to, in the beginning we didn't\nknow nothing, but later we knew how to handle it, to repair and we always get some food for\nthis repairing, from the SS men, from the accessory men, that they were, couldn't handle it\nand they needed it and so. And so we could organize food for other people and to help them.\nBut then I saw what it was not possible that we could survive. I saw it was not possible.\nWhy? That we were secret keeper. Yes. like the sonderkommando. We see so\nmuch, so we got on the list of secret keepers. (Secret keepers?) Secret keepers, bearers (ph),\nah, yes, you know, secret bearers (ph). And we knew, we should be killed, we should be\nshot, and there were some periods that they would exchange us. But the other ober _fthrer\n(ph), he was interested first that the work is running and secondly that organize the\nvaluables which he always wanted valuables. ( ) Yes from this, from this also\nspecial. So he keeped us. And so, that we, we, were in the ground (ph), and we were from\nthat we must give them all the reports. So what I observed every day I came\nto the ramp, I saw the selections exactly, yes.",
        "A: The cremetoria were built up, yes, and they were ready I think in March, the first\ncremetorium in March was put in operation. (March '42?) Yes. We cannot came to the\ncremetoria when they were operating, but when they were not operating some pipes were\nleaking or something was necessary, an electrician also. So we came and the guard there, and\nthe guard was very exacting. He couldn't speak with the people in this cremetory, it was\nsonderkommando, but we saw, we saw the corpses. We saw not the - and this, you know, as\nI told you, this, this uh bunkers, these adapted cremetories, stopped the work and the\nsonderkommando came, but not I must, I forgot to tell you one very important thing. How I\ncame to contact this underground. So there still was, as I told you, a block when the\nsonderkommando was guarded, and there were about three hundred men, and they were\nunder the guard always going to this Birkenau, to this woods, and they came back and they,\nit was prohibited to contact them. And when I was going with my uh, with my box and one\nof these blocks, sonderkommando, blockaltester, the Jew, when I came nearer I saw that he\nwas a Jew, and here S S, Slovak, you know, a very nationality, he had a sign. When you\nhave this Jewish uh David Star. So you have inside the sign if you were Greek, G, if you\nwere Czech - C, if you were Slovak, an S. So I saw Slovak, so I asked him that is my\ncountryman. What are you doing here, I asked him where from you are,\nand so. We were , we were friends. Even . And he told me this--I\nnever forget: \"We are Chevra Kaddisha.\" You know what is the Chevra Kaddisha.",
        "A: Yes. Chevra Kaddisha, so it is a saint [NB: sacred] burial society of Jews. So I didn't\nunderstand. I was shocked. And he told me, \"Look. There...in the woods about two miles,\nthere are some adapted gas chambers from the farm houses. And this sonderkommando 1s\npulling out the corpses of the deported people who are in...the forced by the SS men. And\nafter they are dead, so they are pulling their corpses from this . And they are burying\nthem in the mass graves. Yes. But there are nearly 100,000 corpses in those graves, and uh\nthe water 1s poisoned. Yes. And the water for the whole vicinity. And so it was decided to\nburn---not to bury, to burn. So now this sonderkommando was more...hundred more people;\nand they are digging out these graves, mass graves, and the decaying corpses they are lying\nthem on their on their lorries--small wagons--narrow way, right. And they are putting them\nabout 100 kilometer farther. And there, there is a piles on the...piles from the rails and they\nare pouring them with the fluid; and with the fluid, with the shmatas--with the rags. And they\nare burning them [with] this. And this sonderkommando which you see, they are on the night\nshift.\" And he asked me if I can make a lock or something to repair for him. And so he told,\nbut I would not believe it. I couldn't. And he told me (whispered), \"You don't believe it.\" I\ncouldn't believe. Look, I was three years in the camp at the time. \"And look, so you will see\nit.\" And I didn't know. A few days, came an SS man for me to this kapo. He needs a\nschlosser [Ger: \"locksmith, mechanic or fitter\"], a blacksmith, to repair a bearing in this\nwagon. You know a bearing. And he took me and brought me there, and he stand nearby me\nwhen I make this metal (ph), this bearing house from this wagon which was broke. And I\nsaw it. I saw how the Slovak sonderkommando, Slovak prisoners, uh _ buried...uh\ntook...digged out these open graves. And as they came, the corpses put on these wagons, and\nbrought them back where they were. And from far, I saw also this white bunk house,\nbunkers--this farm house, where this...I saw it. So from this, moment I believe it. So how\nhard was it belief to other people, yes. Now, and so...and this, there was the first\nsonderkommando from Slovakia which came in April 1942, and they were took from these\none thousand men, three hundred; and they brought...they used them for this\nsonderkommando. Yes, and there was the first sonderkommando. And short after, I think in\nDecember, they organized a mass escape. And somebody traited...was a traitor and who\nthought he will save his own life, and he told it to the SS men. And the whole\nsonderkommando was uh ...one day the whole sonderkommando, and they took them to\nAuschwitz I and they shot them and burned them.",
        "A: Yes, the mass escape of this sonderkommando was planned at that time was possible to\nescape, the fences were not so tight, Birkenau, it was in the middle of the woods and so on,\nand there were some escapes, yes, but you must see that people refused to work. But in the\nmoment when they refused to work, or didn't work good, the they shot, the SS men\nshot them, on the spot, yes. And uh this, and their blockaltester (ph) this Rosin (ph)\n, and still he is living. You should hear him. Yes, I will give you\nthat. This Rosin, Arnold Rosin (ph), he is the only one from this other commando who\nsurvived. Only first. Others, all were destroyed, yes. It is in my articles. How, it 1s interesting\nhow he survived this.",
        "A: I know, look, they tried that they will go, they will uh, they will go far behind the, the uh\nfenced, behind the area of the, there was no fence. Behind the area where the, the bunkers\nwere yes. It was not fenced. There were SS men, the guards, they were surrounding them,\nyes. And they told, they were, they were uh, inbofond (ph). There were some guards they\nwill kill and they will go to Slovakia. They organize some cars, yes, and an SS man was\ninvolved in this who was a Slovak SS man, yes, a Slovak. And uh, they believed him, and\nuh, there very exact uh details are not now, maybe there was once, but that, that, and the fact\nthat it was uh, told to SS men, yes, and the one who told it, yes, they killed him with an axe.\nThis traitor, they killed him. They killed him, but it was too late.",
        "A: Yes, the Jews killed him. The name isn't known at all, in the details. And so, and exactly four\ndays or five days later came a new transport from Polish ghettos, and from this transport they\ntook a new sonderkommando, about three hundred men, and from this survived several and I\nhave very detailed uh testimonies of them, and so, and also from this Rosen (ph). From this\nRosen (ph) I have this hugh, he escaped later from Auschwitz. Uh we know how he saved\nEurope, how he saved. Look, it was forbidden to get from this sonderkommando commando,\nto the other , to transport to another, nobody could go away from this other\ncommando. But this Rosen (ph), he found a, bread, you know, a whole bread, and when he\nbreak this bread, inside in this bread was a golden chain and a gold watch, yes. Inside, from\nthe deportees. Someone told it will save his life, so brought him this. And so he was on the\nblock and he gave this a to the blockaltester, . (Say it again in\nEnglish.) Yes, the blockaltester was the boss of the block, normally a prisoner or\n. And the schreiber [Ger: scribe], the clerk, who was his aide, was also.\nAnd he corrupted, he gave these valuables, these forms to them and they asked him they\nshould transfer him to another block. Even it, 1t was written, they did it by the way he is a ill\nand so on. Even so, and through the infirmary they got him in another block, you known,\ntransmitted. SO he was not there, in this block. And so he saved his life, and he is still living,\nyes. Arnold Rosin (ph) is his name. So this I will, (let's come back to you), yes, so now you\nsee, so I, how I make the first contact with this other commando with all these people. So I\nhad a survey, how, what, how the barracks. And so I give it to underground and it was the\ncentral, was in Auschwitz I, but there was some prisoners, Shmuleski and so on who came in\nthis Auschwitz I who was a tiler you know from the roof.",
        "A: Yes, so there was an underground of mainly, in the Polish camps, yes, the Polish, but non-\nJews. And they central was in the Auschwitz I camp, in the main camp. And the head of this,\nthis I didn't knew at that time, but how was it, Cirankiewicz (ph), later the Minister President\nof the Polish Republic, he was and he was at that time uh, uh nurse on the, he was prisoner,\npolitical prisoner, Polish prisoner, and he was a nurse on the prison uh infirmary. And he has\nsome group, so-called camp group (ph) of Auschwitz, the fighting group of Auschwitz, but\nthere was Austians, some French and some Poles. They didn't took a Jew inside, yes. They\nused the services of Jews but a Jew was not in there, yes. And one of these liaisons was\nDavid Shmuleski (ph). He was a Jew who was fighting in the Spanish, uh, against Franco (. .\ncivil war). Later he was transported when they lost, so he was in France, to Drancy, and from\nDrancy came on transport to Auschwitz. And Shmuleski came with this, but he has also very\nmany friends in this, uh, underground. Yes. They trusted him. And so he was a liaison\nbetween Birkenau and Auschwitz I. And when he was a roofer, yes, on the roof, you know,\nthe tar, and on the roof is the tar, they were putting roofs and the covered with the tar,\nyouknow, with the paper, you know with this. And for tar, 1t must be the store for tar was in\nAuschwitz I, in the main camp, and so from time to time he came to Auschwitz I. We came\nalso from time for some material we needed, so we came to Auschwitz I, only as uh with a\nguarded with an SS man, but we had connections. And this uh Shmuleski (ph), make the\nconnections with this main camp, and they, and so I gave this and he told, you should all\nobserve and tell me and we will, the Polish uh prisoners have contact with the Polish\ngovernment in London. They have contact through Armia Kraiova. We have note from\nBirkenau, but we, he told us, not names, but he, and this he, he knew much, but we knew the\ndetails, more details. So I told him the details and he gave it further to this uh, to this uh\ncamp group at Auschwitz, this fighting group at Auschwitz. And they have the contact. But\nlater we knew that they are guarding only their own interests. For Jews, they didn't care. So\nwe then, later we find some Czech-Polish, some Czech civil workers, you know, who\nworked, but they were Czechs, yes, and the detail how it worked we have three. And they\ncame from time to time, in three months they could go travel to their families to\nCzechlovakia. And even if they were guarded, they were civil workers, as I told you, at the\ncivil enterprise which were, so one was a carpenter, one make roofs, and one was expert for\nthe canalization, yes for the canalization, the the channels (ph), and for water pipes\nand so. We make with them connections and so were were connected, and we also, we could\nstole plans, yes.",
        "A: Somebody would not believe it. How it was possible. It's already, I can show you a letter\nfrom Polish museum I got now, a certification for it .. There was a so-called Baulaitung of\nAuschwitz, a construction office, a hugh construction office of SS, who made the planning\nand construction of their hugh camps and of the cremetoria, the gas chambers, yes, there was\na hugh office, there were several hundred. But they also took some prisoners, some uh,\nqualified prisoners. So there was, for instance, an engineer, Vera Foltinf (ph). He was an\narchitect, an engineer. So they took him to draw the plans, see, in the office. There was\nBitterman, he was an engineer, so they took him and he was in the commando. He took\nthere and in the office he drawed (ph) for the SS men. And so we pursuaded him he should\nmake a small copies of the plans. And he smuggled it out, and we gave it later to these civil\nworkers, and it came to Prague, and the wife of Kraus, my friend who was non-Jewish, and\nhe was, he had contact through the Swiss consulate in Prague. And so the plans went to the\nSwiss consulate, through this. An original of these plans are in The Death Factory, exactly\nthe plans, yes. They were later when it was this, maybe you know this, when it was revived\nthe Holocaust when the CIA make these pictures, you know, the Americans photographed\nAuschwitz, (right), you know this, exactly, but they told they didn't knew. They never\nbombed. Yes. And later, after many years, they make, they published it publically, the, all\nthese pictures. There were seven raids on Auschwitz, and there is also written that\nis make according to that factory, they ask that the plans are so exactly,\nwhen you see it from, so you see the prints, the basement prints, exactly what we stole from\nthis, from this factory. So it was, and so we had luck. We were lucky that uh, there were\nmany people who paid with life this activity yes. But, and so, that I told you, I was conscious\nthat I can not, it was not according to the human calculation that you would survive. Yes.\nEspecially they guarded us. Yes. So I remember once I was going, it was in '44, in autumn, I\nwas going through the uh, the gate. And always there was a guard. And I always must tell\nhalfling numeral this and this number are going there and there. And he mark the number\nwhere I am in the camp. Yes. That is in evidence. I was going, always without guard, in this\nguarded area. I could go without guard when I had this permission; and I told him the\nnumber--73,000. And there was already 400,000 tattooed. \"So what, 73,000, (ph) ?\nRepeat!\" I repeat. He jumped and go and look on my... \"And how's that you are not dead?\nYou should be dead. This is not possible!\" So I told him, \"Look, I have this...I am expert in\nthis.\" \"Oh, you should not be...you will not alive. You will not wait, Ivan. We have five, you\nwill not wait alive Ivan. You cannot expect that, Ivan. We will save you, yes, the Russians,\nyes,\" he told. . Five minutes before and we , we will shot you\nsaid the SS man, very, very angry, yes. So, such an experience. So nevertheless, so uh, I was\nuh, crematoria then when they come and",
        "A: I am... Should I jump to that moment when the crematoria were destroyed and when the\nuprising was, or still you have some questions.",
        "A: Now, look, first I want you to know about the selections. So, if you have the plans, so you\nsee there are seven camps in Birkenau, yes, and in the middle before the deportment, there\nwere the women's camp, and then the other, the section two, section five. There was built a\nramp (ph), a huge three-chain ramp through...",
        "A: No, no. It's called a passing. You know, uh three-rail... the three rail, from Auschwitz station\nto Birkenau, it was about three kilometer, and the trains came directly before near the\ncremetoria. And the ramp was between, it was a dead ramp, he told us. It was a three-rail,\nand like a huge ramp, and on this ramp came the trains. There were sometimes three, five\ntrains, and on every train there came about three, four, five thousand people. And we saw\nthat the squad of the SS doctors, and their Lagerfthrer, they were making the selection. Yes,\nthey were making the selection. And we saw it, how they were making it. And I was going to\nthe ramp. In the selection, in the process selection, I could go there. But I had these\n, | was sure they will not let me, now they will not take me in. And I was curious\nhow they were making this, yes. So uh, first when I was going from one camp to the other\nso, it was between these two camps and I had to wait and in the other camp, this was a\nwomen's camp, and I had to repair some kitchens there, or some kettles, so I had to wait by\nthe guard. They had the guardstube [Ger: \"guardroom\"], the guard house, yes; an SS man\nalways guarded it. But when the transport came, I had to wait. The SS man was very curious,\nand he also tried to organize something, yes, when there was some food or something\nvaluable. So they always tried. So I have to wait 'til he had time to register my name. And so\nI observed. And this time, I... I experienced a very interesting and moving, moving sense.\nYes. So the whole, I net (ph) this hundred selections, I saw many. And everybody tell you,\n\"Mengele, Mengele.\" It's not true. Look, the Mengele, they didn't very often the selection.\nThere were twenty-three doctors--twenty-three doctors--who had the service for selections at\nthe ramp. And sometimes also was Mengele; but Mengele was eager to have the twins, and\nthe people who were not normal. You know, they had the of something distracted\npeople--he was interested in this. So he didn't...he didn't trust also to the selectees...to his\ncolleagues who selected, and he always watched. And so did his , \"Are you\ntwins? Are you not twins?,\" and so, yes. Or, \"What you are of profession?\" And they\ndiscovered some doctors like Nisly (ph), and he took the doctors and they make for him this\nuh, yes, this searches of the...of the twins. You know, post-mortem, you know, post-mortem\nprotocol.",
        "A: Autopsy. They make the protocols, sign it and send it to Berlin (cough), and so.",
        "A: So this I saw, I observed it uh consciously, I would know it and so what I knew so I gave to\n, to ,",
        "A: Yes, but once... Maybe this would be also interesting for you, the Shmulenski (ph), which I\ntold you was the liaison between Auschwitz. And he told, \"Look, we need photograph. The\nworld will not believe in our reports. We need photograph.\" They asked me we should\nphotograph. So I need a photograph he told, Shmulenski (ph). So photograph, it was very\nhard to, not so hard to organize, but smuggle in the camera. As the people brought many\nphotographs you know, for the parents, all the equipment, they brough the whole equipment\nfor the dentist, for instance, all the people brought with them. And once it came that we were\ngoing to the ramp, myself and Kraus (ph), my friend, together, and he saw a carriage, a baby\ncarriage there, after the Holland transport came. It was only the ramp was clean, and still\nthere was a heap of this trunks and of this and so the Kanada kommando took it away to this\nstorage to sort 1t and to take the valuables from this. You know Kanada, what it was.",
        "A: Look. The Kanada, it was a special squad--a special detail, so-called averamudienst (ph) in\nGerman. Averamudienst (ph). It means that they should clean, they should help when the\nprisoners, deportees, came. So they had the service; and they always told to the prisoners, in\ntheir language, \"Out of the wagons, and you should go left. All your luggage, they will bring\nit in the camp. You should not care.\" And so they have the task to quiet them a little, yes;\nand there was also a I can't. And after their...they have to quiet them in their own\nlanguage. And the SS men were also behind them . And after their transport were\nselected and put...put to...brought to the gas chambers, out of the camps who were working,\nwho were able-bodied. So then it was a heap of trunks of all this, and they brought with a list\nto the Kanada camp, where there was thirty barracks where all the belongings of these\ndeportees were sorted. Were sorted and checked. Many people uh, uh sewed in their\nraiments, in their shoes, in every possible hidings, , and all. And this were, and the\nguard sorted, and when they found something so they must give it away. Ifa prisoner tried to\norganize, to take something for himself, so if he was catched, he was shot on the spot. But\nnevertheless, this brunt (ph), this business with the SS man also tried to get something but\nhad access, and so used the prisoners who had access and so on, yes. It was very\ncomplicated. And this Kanada, the name Kanada came as it is a in Kanadas,\nvery far. They are rich people and they have a good living. Kanada, it was\nknown, it was a dream of a welfare society, yes. So they made the name \"Kanada\" as this\nkommando always had...always had bacon, had food, had decent... It was a good kommando.\nA good detail. But they were guarded. And when somebody...many of them were shot for\nwhen they were catched from organizing. It was organizing. And, told when somebody\nwould. And so I will come to this camera, and the Kraus (ph) took this carriage, and brought\nit in the camp. And the in the carriage there was a small package. Look in the carriage. We\nhave in our maintenace squad, there came SS men, they would have tor repair whatever, a\nlamp (ph), but he couldn't take it by a normal way. So he gave to us in this squad and make\nalso a carriage, some baby carriage. And so repair baby carriage. There was not a wheel, and\nso Kraus (ph) in the first moment told, yes, baby carriage would be good if there is SS man,\nwe will have a repair, and so I have spare parts, but what we found in this package was food,\nand there was a camera. A spiegel (ph) camera, camera, spiegel (ph) camera. It means mirror\ncamera yes. And so Shmuleski came, and we showed, look, oh, I cannot . . It must be a\n. Otherwise I cannot photograph. , you know. So his plan was that he will go",
        "on the roof, yes, and carry the camera to the roof, and manage to exchange a\nand through this and make the shots. This was his plan. So he would not have this camera.\nSo he, and he seek. But we would destroy this camera, yes. It was very dangerous to have a\ncamerA: So we have a, when the is going to make a fire, and so we have\nthis in our, our equipment. And then there was a friend of Shmulenski (ph) who work on the\nwater barricades who worked with civilian workers on the water and he was engineer of\nwood, and he was in our squad, and he sometimes came and he had the contact with this\nPolish civilian workers. Yes. And he told, no look, we can get three, four hundred cigarettes\nfor this, and I will take it and I will give it to civilian worker. So, he took it. He took it and he\nbrought I think uh about hundred cigarettes and divided. But in two months, about, in two",
        "months we were called, schlosser , locksmiths in the...they should come to the\nblockfuhrerstube (ph) in the entrance to the camp, yes. And by the entrance to the camp,\nthere were a guard from Gestapo, they had two clerks, which should observe what happened\nin the camp, yes. In this, there was the office of Gestapo detail, in this uh, in this guard, it\nwas a guard house, and there was, and we should go, it was called schlosser . But it\nwas nothing because they always asked for something, if there was in another camp. And the\nKraus (ph), was going there, yes, my friend the Kraus(ph). And yes, they asked for him. And\nhe came in about twenty minuetes back he was bloody, he was pale and uh, he told look\nBrazovsky (ph) is lying on the corridor, beaten to blant (ph). Yes, Brazovsky, who took once\nthe camerA: And he told me also I couldn't keep, they beat me so I must confess. I couldn't\nkeep, I must confes. So he didn't go in the office and he returned back. What should we do?\nWe are all involved in this, yes. What should we do? And this was a, , a very\ndesperate situation.\nTAPE #3",
        "A: So and Kraus (ph) came to us, what we should do. We, there was a fiend of us who was in\ncharge of the station for repairing the teeth for SS men, yes. They came there. He was expert\nfor this, he was an artist and a doctor for, dentist doctor. (He was a dentist.) And he told\nthem he was a friend was and uh, in the reserve (ph). His name is Alex\nRosenstock (ph) and he told look, I will give you a morphine injection. You will not feel it if\nthey will beat you. Yes. And they gave him a morphine injection and he proved it, and he\nsticked it in, and he didn't feel. And he was going.",
        "A: Can't think what he was told the SS asked him. He was then back, he couldn't, he came in\ntwenty minutes, half-hour back, laughing. Back. Just laughing. And he told the story. I came\nto this office and there were two SS men, Lachman (ph) and Boger (ph), I knew them. There\nwas a table and on the table was the camera and they whip. A whip, yes,\nand it was a pistol. And they asked me did you know the camera. Yes, I know. How did you\nget to this camera? So I told them the story, I found it a carriage and I brought this baby\ncarriage and we found the camera and so. So why didn't you give up the camera to the SS\nmen? Look, the camera, it's like a machine gun, a machine gun, yes, would you shot me. So\nwe heed some cigarettes, so we tried. So, and for what reason you would have this carriage.\nAh, this carriage, look, some SS would have repaired some baby carriage, so I told him I will\nmake him a good service, when I can repair, so he told it the guard. So let us know the name\nof the SS man who ordered, who have from you the repair of a baby carriage. The guard's\nname I don't remember. So you don't remember, so they give me a slap, they give me another\nslap. Now, you remember. I cannot. So they opened the door. Look, you will look like this,\nlike Brazovsky, if you don't admit to whom you made the repair. So\nhe told, I never will uh, never will uh, no\nI never will. You speak another language? No. I never will tell\nuh , [never will an SS man to denounce, no. I never will denounce an SS man. So\nthey give him a kick hard. Yes. Nothing. This moment when he told I never will denounce\nan SS man, why all the SS men were involved in some way with the prisoners, and so when\nthey saw, this is 1n all prisoners, and he, he will never, in this situation he will not denounce\nan SS man, so he is a good man. So they kicked him out, and he came back laughing. He told\nI was so quiet with this injection, so quiet that I didn't feel it, danger, nothing. I was very\nquiet like comrades to the SS. So, yes, also Brazovsky they let him 1n the , was in the\ninfirmary, and also.",
        "A: So, also this, such, this not the only case. There were another when we have a radio, and so.\nBut this, I never will forget, this one when Kraus came back laughing after this and told this\nstory. Yes. But later, they make the photographs, later. There are known, these photographs,\nthese three or four photographs, and I discovered in the bathroom they were made and the\nstories about them, it's not true that Shmuleski made them. It's told Shmuleski told he made\nthem but it's not true. I later discovered who, why.",
        "A: It made, a Polish, a Greek officer, a young Greek officer. Who later tried to escape and were\nkilled. Uh, I puzzled the place where from it was done. Shmulevski told it was done from the\nroof, yes, and he told him but he wouldn't . And so, but when I was in Yad\nVashem working, and so I showed these photographs to a photographer who was there and\nhe asked me how it was done. I told him from the roof. It is not possible, the angle is not\npossible from the roof, it is not possible. And yes, he was true. And later I know how it was\nfrom the frame, we found the frame of the gas chamber in the cremetortum number four,\nthere from it was done. Yes, so this is the story.",
        "A: After the camera incident, nothing. Nothing. With this moment when he told if I\nthe SS man, it was forgotten - no medal, nothing.",
        "A: Look, always...every man who survived long time and held the position...look, it was the\nsurviving. It was possible to survive for eight or three, four, five percent of people to survive.\nWho--people, prisoners--who had a luck to get the job which the SS men needed. This were\nthe doctors, the nurses, and all kinds of artisans--tilers, and so on. They needed them.\nTherefore, first they had a better possibility to move. They had the possibility to eat, yes, to\norganize food; and they had always some connections. Sometimes the connections were very\ndangerous. The SS men shoot the people and so on. When they feel they are in danger, yes.\nSo you were never very sure of this. So connections, I in Kanada. And so, in the\nKanada ...look, the Kanada...the details. Kanada was very, uh very severely watched, yes; if\nthey are organizing, if they came to the camp, they were always checked. And so, in spite the\nSS men knew that they are organizing and in spite they always are interested that they should\norganize for them, yes. So it was so.",
        "A: Yes, now. So look, the Kanada had this special camp. It was E...Camp E... I forget. G camp.\nI can show you on the plan. In this camp, there were about thirty barracks, like prisoner\nbarracks. And in these barracks were sorted all the belongs which the...the...which were\ntaken off from the deportees. Yes. And in these barracks, when they came, they was\nsonderkommando. The prisoners, they must go and take off all their uh . And in\nanother barrack, they got another uh suits, clothes. So...and when they returned they\nmust...they must make also in one barrack, and then another. So they could not keep, or very\nhard to keep, something in their raiments. The same was with the SS men, the SS men who\nobserved; they came to the Gestapo, they came to make SS , Shower, and in an\nelegant way. And also must keep their...their suits. They get other suits; and through the\nGestapo...through the bathroom, yes. So also they could keep. So who could keep.\nSometimes they managed. But the...the artisans, for instance, we were called to repair\nelectrician, or to repair a pipe or repair something. I remember an SS man asked when we\nshould organize for him a fur, yes. Organize it a fur. A real fur, yes. A nice fur for his wife.\nSo when we came to this, when we have some work in Kanada, we knew that we would\ncome there. So there the floor was...there was no planks, nothing. It was mud, on\nthe...such...packed. Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Packed dirt, yes. And so we contacted these from Kanada, the prisoners which were in a\nneighboring camp. And he promised he will dig in in the floor something what we were\ninterested, some ring or brilliant--something small. And we had in our uh boxes,\n, water crane (ph), uh, water pipe. Yes, this...what is water running, what is that?\nA; For the pipes. No, when the water is running?",
        "A: Faucet. And in the middle of this faucet is such a hat (ph) you know, if you can dismantle it.\nSo you can in the middle of this such a hat (ph). And this we operated out, and there we put\nthis contraband, you know. And we screwed it very tightly. And so...we were going, so we\nchecked this and this. But he didn't find. And so, I wanted to how...how they traded (ph) the\nSS men with us. So before we came from our camp, it was the camp to the\ncamp , we had to pass three different guards, guard barracks, yes. And so when we\ncame from one camp, so the SS men told, \"Look, what you bring? I know the rings or watch\nor something.\"",
        "A: Sure. You in Kanada, so you bring this and this. They knew. And he found another SS man,\nand told, \"Look, this uh blacksmiths, they will bring some valuables. If you will find them,\nyou can have it.\" So...so we were going through this. And the SS men [said], \"You have\nsomething.\" \"No. We have nothing.\" So we tried and and they didn't find. And this\nSS man, when we came on the camp to this SS man who offered this: \"So where have\nyou...?\" \"Uh, be patient. We will bring it to you.\" So we came to our...our maintenance\nbarrack squad, into shop, of the squad, and the . And for our eyes he was a\ngood ring or something. He phoned to another SS man, before me, you fool, how did\nyou check these people. They brought it. Yes, so if; he asked how it's our secret. So this 1s\nthe way, but we were sure, if he would find this prisoners who make this organization, gold\nor something very valuable, he would give him slip and he would sew in pocket. He would\nnot . But even if he would find a letter, even so innocent letter from a wife to a man\nat another camp, immediately he would take a notice to a Gestapo office, and they would\nbrought you and murder you and kill you. Just, even make a case, a great case of a spy. And\nI don't know what. But they never make it , the SS men.",
        "A: Yes, they were very eager to get some value from this. And this I knew. Yes. So this was,\nbut it was dangerous, but 1t happened sometimes, this. So this I explain you, the Kanada.",
        "A: Look, the liberation, so it was, you don't understand. I will tell you also that my wife and my\neleven-year son came to Auschwitz. They were in Theresienstadt when I was already long\ntime in Auschwitz. Normally, the deportees were always selected and the wives with\nchildren were put in the gas chambers. It was normal. But the first time into us, in September\n1943, it came from Theresienstadt a transport of Czech prisoners. And no of them were\nselected and all were put in a special camp, so-called a Czech \"family camp.\" In Birkenau it\nwas a camp. And nobody was allowed to go from the camp, and nobody was allowed to go\nin. It was isolated. The people were not shaved their hair. They didn't work opposite...outside\nthe camp. They get the better food. And there were rumors that they will be exchanged for\nGerman prisoners. Yes. And they believe it, believe it all. They had special rights, special\nconditions. And there was in my wife and our family, and my son also. So I also...yes. But\nwe couldn't believe for the first time they took the transport to Birkenau. And the reason for\nthis was that there were rumors that from Theresienstadt, who was proclaimed as special and\nprominent uh ghetto, yes, that the people were deported to the east and killed. There were\nrumors. So that they would uh block these rumors. And these people who came to\nTheresienstadt from the camp, they must write every month a letter to Theresienstadt or to\nother. And they wrote a letter and could ask for to send them a package of food; and they got\nthe food from Portugal, from France, from Switzerland, yes. And they wrote letters to\nTheresienstadt, where their relatives or friends were. But the address to avoid any connection\nwith Auschwitz; so they wrote the address: \"Arbeitslager Birkenau.\" This [means]\n\"working camp Birkenau.\" \"Bei Neu Bieru_\"--it's near Neu Bieru_. It was about nine\nkilometers far. There was a post office there, you could find it on the map. \"Lagerstrasse\"\nand number--it is a street, a camp street; this house number, and this and this. So they avoid\nany... And so they came to [NB: from] Theresienstadt, a new camp, a working camp it's all.\nThere were some...in the text we tried to mark it in hiding the letter that there 1s a camp of\nthat, and we need some people that were already dead. But they couldn't understand it. But\nafter half a year, they had decided the whole camp to anihilate. They put them all in the gas\nchambers, yes. And in this camp also was my son and my wife, and also in this transport.\nAnd by...it was in the records, my son at the time he was 1n infection block in this camp. And\nin this infection block were already about twenty prisoners from Mengele with the twins\nwho make these experiments, yes. And my son, he was...he called a \"pocket schwartze\"--\nblack pockets--you know...",
        "A: ..this un infection, , this cough, it was infection. And he was put on this\ninfection block with some others. And the people, they would not believe. If we knew it, or\nthe underground, or on the seventh of September, or seventh March, we got message from\nfamily, from women's camp, there was a secretary, a prisoner, who had some phone call\nfrom an officer that they should prepare . Look, it means that they should\nprepare the killing of this whole camp from, the family camp. And we warned them, they\nwould not believe it, they told it's not possible. Eichmann was there three months ago and\nthey educated children, they had a school for children, they was interested in education. They\ncould not believe it. But why believe and they ask me if we should. I came there only on my\noccupation as a plumber, to repair these kettles.",
        "A: Yes. So with this they didn't knew it, that I have the wife, the SS men, in the camp. But\nthrough this...my profession, I could contact my wife and my son. And I arranged, she asked\nme, when she believed. Helga believed. And there were so many tricks what the SS men\nmade they shouldn't believe that they believe more the SS men than they did us. Yes, I wrote\nit all, this. And I suceed, managed with a doctor that he gave to my wife injection and he was\nas some signs of typhoid fever and they took them one, one night before the liquidation of\nthe camp, to this block, to this infirmary, epidemic block 32. And this they couldn't took.\nOnly this best, there were some so they didn't took this block. So they\nsurvived. Unbelievable, yes. I wrote this many, many times. I just wrote I will, maybe I\nforgot to give it to you, the first time after fifty years, thirty years, I wrote the story about my\nescape and survival, my son in a special about seventy pages. I will send it to you. So this is\nthe family camp. It was liquidated in one night. It was under commmando. They tried to\nmake a , yes, to burn the blocks, it was straw and wood with some fuel, you know,\nin this lighters, in this fuel, when you have the lighters for cigarette, there is a fuels, some\nsmall fuel, ampules (ph), and this we delivered to them from Kanada, many, much, but they\ndidn't believe and they didn't make it, an uprising. So that much details. So, this was the very\nstrong thing. But now, will this sonderkommando, the uprising of this sonderkommando,\nmaybe, and then the escape.",
        "A: Yes. So this sonderkommando, I give you a story. The escape. So now it came to the\nevacuation. We didn't believe and once it was in January, on the second of November, the\ngassing was stopped. I remember it very good. There was a transport from Slovakia and they\nwas, there were no, they came all to camp, none came to the selection, none came to the gas\nchambers. And then, they ordered the dismantling and destroying of the gas chambers. Yes,\nyes.",
        "A: 1944. And before, also, there were a huge transport from Hungary. And it was the top of the\ndestruction, they twenty thousand a day, during this Hungarian transport. And this\nsonderkommando brought about nine hundred people. And they liquidated two hundred and\ntwo hundred and for the liquidation. They other three hundred, these sonderkommando knew\nit and from the despair they made uprising and they killed three SS men, they wounded\ntwelve, but four hundred and fifty were killed and they burned as the cremetorium number\nfour was put in fire and was put out of operation.",
        "A: What I told for us. No. Look, I was not in this sonderkommando.",
        "A: No. We observed this, and I heard it, how, and I believed in the beginning that it was useless,\nthe powder, this this podwer for this, the crash of this when the roof collapsed,\nwhen the roof collapsed was so strong that it looked like explosion. But later it turned out it\nwas not, and it is written, this article which I will give you. But now, this destruction. So the\ncremetoria, this one cremetorium was put out of operations on the 7th of October 1944, from\nsonderkommando. They proved that it was possible to destroy with own hands and force the\nkilling facilities. But only the destruct (ph) group at Auschwitz, the fighting group of\nAuschwitz. They promise them help, and they never get help. In the last moment they\nrefused, the Polish. And they told later, it was in a document, they told that we will dare to\nmake an uprising only in the moment when we are in the such stage, endangered as the Jews.\nUntil that moment, the Polish, the non-Jews were not put to the gas chambers from the\ntransport, only when they were ill and. So later, three times they traited, they didn't keep their\nvow, they didn't help. So, there was one cremetoria was destroyed by prisoners. The two\nother cremetorias, the SS men, they exploded them. But there still are traces in Auchwitz,\nyes, you have the gas chambers, and the dismantling rooms, you can see them exactly. And\nthey make a hugh dismantling commando, mainly for women, and they cleaned the bricks,\none brick after another, and they put it on the wagons in a very nice manner. Like the\nGerman are accustomed. And we, the schlossers, the plumbers, the artists, the commando,\nthis Stermitz, Oberscharfihrer who were in charge of commando, he asked that we should\ndismantle this ventilaters, the pieces of the furnaces (ph) and we dismantled it and it was put\nin conserve with vaseline and put in tight paper nice and put in the wagons. And I asked this\nSteimitz, I asked him had Herr Oberscharfuhrer, where did you get it. I was good with him,\nhe asked sometimes what will you bring me, so I asked him, the Jews are alredy anhilated,\nand war will be finished. What will you do with this equipment? And he told me this. I will\ntell in German, original. I never forget it.\n. I will translate it for you. \"Look,\nJew,\" he told me, \"our Fuhrer has a secret weapon. Now it will come over Europe. And then\nwill come the downfall of the Poles and Czechs, and we will finish them quicker than the\nJews.\" So it was on the 26th of December, 1944. I never will forget this moment. Yes. This\nSteimitz. I later found him...when I identified an SS man, I found him in the SS hospital in\nZelek (ph) in Hamburg. So this is the...now the escape, yes. So it...one day, three or four\ndays, it came ordered that they should burn all the documents which were in the blocks, you\nknow--the cards, the names, the list, it was burned. The officers disappeared, the SS officers.\nThere were only the surgeons, and these law officers. And on the 18th of November it was\nordered evacuation. So there were still about in, about 50 or 60,000 prisoners in there all, the\nAuschwitz camps. There were many...39 camps, 39. And we... So I was Birkenau, was about\n16,000, yes. First we tried...we had...we organized a nice uh clothes, civilian clothes. And the\nprisoners want to only for them, and good boots. And so we tried, we would wait when the\nRussian came, it was before. So we digged near our workshop a hole, and we tried that we\nwill hide, make a hidden entrance. O.K., we tried; we are three or four. But then when the SS\nmen make these empty...the camps, so they came with bloodhounds there. And if they found\nsomebody they shot him on the spot. So we...we... So it 1s not possible; so we came to this\ntransport. There was about one thousand, always one thousand prisoners, under the guard of\nthese SS men, and we make three days march 'til we came to the station Loslau (ph). And if\nsomebody couldn't go, and was behind, so behind was a special shooting commando, they\nshot him. And I think about half of the prisoners, still they came from our bach (ph) to\nLoslau to the station where they put us in open coal trucks. Open coal trucks. They put about\nmore than one hundred in there. We were like sardines. We can only stand, yes. And during\nthe trip, the train was going to Austria, to Mauthausen, through different uh ways. And uh\nmany...there was snow. It was bitter cold and with high snow. And the Poles, the Polish\nprisoners, they jumped from the train. Yes, from train. It was an open train, but the SS men\nhad a platform on the back, a platform. They had the two wagons, two person wagons, on the\nplatform from planks; and they had lights, reflectors, and they had machine guns...in\ncurves..many poles jumped in curves and so we came to Austria. The train came through my\nnative land of Czechoslovakia, in the city Ostrava--which I knew very good, coal mines and\nso on. I known it's not far from my home. So there was a situation that I, the detail I will give\nyou brochure, there was a situation where it was possible to escape, yes The train stopped\nthere, and they make on the sideline a train, yes, it was not free then. And they make a rumor\nthere, the Germans, that the train is bearing the Germans who were bombed from the Allies,\nand they are telling them they are putting them to death. They would not tell that they are\nprisoners. And in Ostrava you have, there are some over-the-train bridges, and uh, the\npopulation told that there are Germans and they mobilized some Red , you know,\nRed Cross, the charity. And this charity came with two kettles of coffee or something and\nwould help to their own countrymen as they are told that are bombed out, the Germans. And\nwhen the prisoners, so these kettles, so they try to jump, and the SS men make a barrier and\nwould not allow the contact that when these charity men, and this, and so when the\nguard came nearer and nearer, and we also jumped with my son, he was eleven years old,\nfrom this, and once I saw there is no SS men. They shrank (ph) together, but they, they\nprohibit, should prohibit the contact between these prisoners, they would that the prisoners\nshould go back to the, the tracks and they should not make contact with these charity men\nwith these kettles. And when I saw there is nobody, so I run away. It was midnight. There\nwas shooting and so I, I didn't care. We were going, and running and running with my son\nand so we put off this prisoners\u2019 clothes and underneath we have a good civil organized from\nKanada, and so it was night, 1t was curfew, and we, we saw a pit and in this pit there was this\ncolony of miners. Yes, the miner, the miners. And we saw this small, small...",
        "A: Uh, we saw some small houses. Yes, family houses of miners, and in so was a very light, a\nvery small light...of light. It was...you know. And I dared to knock on the door. There came,\nand...a woman, and I asked her if we can get some help. And I spoke with the dialect of this\ncountry; and my son was there. So he let us inside, and he was a widow and had two sons.\nThey were preparing for a shift to miner to make. So if they believed or not, I don't know;\nbut they asked, I told we were working in Germany, yes, workers. And also my very dear\nwife, I told my wife was sealed off and we couldn't take her, and is my child, and I\nwill take him to the grandparents which are not far from here, Zarywa (ph). I knew the whole\nvicinity, yes. So they were nice to us. We could wash and so. And they, I asked how the train\nis going there and there, and they gave me a very good advice. But at the time there was\nmobilized the, the, men, they were digging anti-tank, uh, anti-tank uh graves for...",
        "A: Yes. And every manpower is very needed. So, and before on the, in the railway station, they\nwere full of pick axes and shovels, so I took a pick axe and shovel and I am going with this\ntrain who is going to the Valasske Mezerici village, yes. And I, this was the city, Valasske\nMezerici, where I studied.",
        "A: Valasske Mezerici.",
        "A: I studied there my high school. So I thought maybe...maybe I will get there. And I came to\nthis city, to this town, yes, so I saw, I have no even idea if I would make this digging, so I\nneed a proof that I am a citizen, and so I have nothing. So I phoned to my friend, to Vsetin,\nmy native, native uh city, where I was native, and before the war I was in connection as I\ntold you to this, to transmit, to help this crossing of the borders, and this man who was\nenterprise man, and he was also involved in this. But I didn't knew if he was catched or not\ncatched, but nevertheless I knew him. And I checked in the phone book and still his firm was\nthere, yes. So I phoned. And he answered. I told him the slogan, yavor, yavor (ph), was the\nslogan, yes.",
        "A: Yes, but he, yavor (ph), yes, but he recognized me on my voice. And he [said], \"Erich, you\nare here? Where are you?\" \"So in Mezerici (ph).\" \"I will come on the next train.\" And he\ncame. With the next train, he gave us money, he gave us these cards for food, yes, rations,\ncards and he brought with a hiding place, yes, 1t was a hiding place in mountains.\nHe had some connections. We must, we changed twice or something, but there we survived,\nalso with my son, and I, on this hiding, I started to write on this book, The Death Factory\n(ph), which was published in '46 in Prague and later translated in many languages, and so on.\nThis was the first book on Auschwitz, with the plan. I started. But later, my friend, Otto\nKraus (ph), who also ...who came with this transport to another camp and survived, so we\nwere returned to Auschwitz, to Birkenau. We'd hidden some documents there, digged in, so\nwe found, we gave it to the court, to the Polish court, to the Narodny Nationale (ph) Tribunal\n(ph). And we were first witness in this court, , against this Hoss and against forty\nothers , as witnesses. And so from this, we made The Death Factory. And it was the first\nbook...no, later, later. So we survived. So look, so I can give you some bibliography where I\nwrote most of this.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh, Czechloslovakia after the war. O.K. I lived twenty years after the Communist [takeover].\nI was persecuted then later in Czechloslovakia, therefore I escaped. When you must known\nthat in '68 I was in danger, when the Prague Spring. Was, you know, the Prague Spring. So I\nwas involved in the Jewish community to educate some Jewish people.

But then it was a second...there came a second transport with the same purpose; and\nafter they should also go to be liquidated. Then in the last moment, they decided\nthey will...they will make a selection, that they needed the manpower, yes. And they selected\nthe people who were without, women in the...without children.
