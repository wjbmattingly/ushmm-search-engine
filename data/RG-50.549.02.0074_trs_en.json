        "Q: So wha -- were you in a pretty well-off family?",
        "A: Middle class, but attend to the pretty good gymnasium. The story was this way,\nmy wi -- my father didn\u2019t believe there will be -- Poland will be free very long\ntime, and he taught me that if I will be survive, I have to s-study in the gymnasium\nwill be the good s -- good language. It was the to -- different schools it we -- I\nattend to the fi -- first -- first of all he ask me which language I prefer, Russian or\nGerman, because it was [indecipherable] I preferred German. Th-The reason I\nattend to the private s -- g-gymnasium Mikoyrai, what was practically run by the\nevangeli -- og -- evangi -- no -- the li -- evangelism ch-church, you know? And\nmost these people, the student would attend was from the German family, they\nspeak home German. That what there 1s, on that I was a very poor student with the\nGerman. Every year I have a student, you know, which teach me during the\nvacation. Usually my parents with another parents, you know, hired the student\nfrom the Germany, and to -- during the two months we sent for vacation, two or\nthree guys, and tal -- two or three months we talk German only. If we say between\nus one word Polish, the guy beat us because he thought [indecipherable] that we\u2019re\nst -- talking something against him. Th-The reason when I come home I start talk\nto my mother, you know, the German. And -- and this was -- was very good\nbecause this -- th-thanks to this I survive. It was many times this, during the\nGerman occupation that I survived. The first -- first day when the German arrived,\nyou know, on the [indecipherable] place, you know, they stop me, the French\ngendarmerie did, was the French gendarmerie and I was so upset, you know,\nbecause W-Warsaw survived -- surrendered, it was the first or second day, and the\nger -- the -- they [indecipherable] the people you know, to cover the holes, which\nwas where -- was for the [indecipherable] the bombs. And he ca -- ask me. You\nhave to work in [indecipherable] what for? And I -- very friendly German, I talk\nwith him, what for? [indecipherable] and he told -- he told me [indecipherable] me\nthis, I\u2019m sorry for you. I was so surprised that this way. He think probably that I\nam German. It was the de -- the reason that many time during the action -- I\nremembered another time, during the German occupation, I have lot of friends,\nyou know, what speaking for German [indecipherable] you know, and once during\nthere was the people g -- wa -- catch the people to -- to German. We have -- we\ncarry in the pocket, you know, the big sign, and [indecipherable] this was a sign\n[indecipherable] German member for the na-national [indecipherable] the national\nsocialist [indecipherable], but I will put in the pocket and this way we -- we so like\ndrunk, and to -- oh, you go away. It was the second time I survive, you know, like\nyoung people drink? Risk, make a lot of risk. How many times they dri -- they\ngoing with the, you know, with the guns during -- because we make a lot of\nsabotage, lot of working against th-the Nazis. We make many, many different\naction. The action -- the first my -- action was like in 19 -- 1940 or \u201941, we put the\nha -- to -- German got out, the Polish got out, you put the -- no, 1t wasn\u2019t a bomb\nburst, 1t was like a material would make a fire, what would burn the German tr-tr-\ntrucks and the Polish trucks. You -- it was my first action. And then later we blow\nthat -- I was trained, and we bl-blow that train. The same time I attend to the\nPolytech Institute because in the m -- in the beginning the German close the old\nschool, and later they opened the school only for the technician school, you know,\nthey need -- they don\u2019t -- they need only the people to work, the working people\nthat there is on that -- they opened the school for the technician and this -- this way\nwe working with -- and I attend to this -- this Polytechnic Institute, I study\nmechanic engineering. It wa-was not engineering [indecipherable] engineering,\nthey call it technical, the engineering was too high educated for the Polish people,\nthe Polish like -- supposed to be slaves. But the same time wa -- working -- was al-\nalways belong to the underground army, until I was trained like a miner, and my\nspecialist was the blowing the train. I-It was during the action what we did few\ntimes, it was action, the -- one day, the same day or the same time was to blow out\nthe train in many places, that\u2019s [indecipherable] it was this organization, and I was\ntrained, you know, the blowing the train. We trained [indecipherable] the trains\nwould bring supply for that -- wou-would bring supply to the east front, or we\nblow the train, which was most important, they could [indecipherable] special\ntrain would bring the German soldier from the east front to vaca -- for vacation to\nGermany. There was th -- it was most difficult because this train has a very strong\n-- very strong, you know, safety purpose. On the beginning, on the end of that\ntrain, there was a se -- se -- machines gun. Additional, this train has in the front of\nthe machine gun, the locomotive, two cars who are loading with the -- with the\nsand, you know, to prevent the -- if they were blowing the -- preferred they would\nbe blowing the empty -- the cars, not the -- not the locomotive. There was -- we\nfind this, they will make a method that was special delayed, they will blow up not\nthe empty train, but the train with the -- with the soldiers.",
        "Q: Me -- Mr. Madejski, one of the things that strikes me, listening to you, and that\nI noticed watching the video of your previous interview --",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: -- is you talk about killing, blowing things up, with a smile on your face.",
        "A: Smiling on my face, yes, because now I always, you know, always -- we didn\u2019t\npay attention, you know, I was -- there were -- were -- risk our life. We didn\u2019t pay\nattention for this. In this age we didn\u2019t scare too much. We didn\u2019t scare too much.\nTh-The -- the reason, you know, that we -- we fighting for the freedom, which was\nthe fighting for the freedom, and that in this time, there was lot of jokes. The jokes\nwhich keep the people, you know, in good light. The jokes was, for instance, this\nway. They calculated the people they -- for if -- once a week fe -- 1f we kill -- if\nthe Polish people kill one the German soldier, sometimes accidentally, sometimes\nthe German soldier was drunk or something like this, was killed. For th --\nanything, for this -- in this case, they s -- s -- we knew they ki-kill from the people,\ngrab the people from the street and for one soldier they\u2019d kill hundred Polish\ncitizen, you know. The same di -- if somebody -- 1-1f somebody hide the Jewish\npeople. This w -- immediately was -- was on the spot killed.

They immediately -- they bring all house for the yard\nand ki -- on the spot they kill all these people, they didn\u2019t fool around. You know,\nbut we talking we calculated that in Warsaw this time was almost million people,\nyou know, they calculate if they kill 100 people a day even, there is so many\n[indecipherable] we don\u2019t have to worry, it will take a long time to destroy\ncompletely, you know?

There were so many\njokes about this, you know, we -- but the people smuggle -- smuggle -- they\nsmuggle [indecipherable] smuggling was the same, but if they [indecipherable] the\nsmuggler was -- sometimes was a Volksdeutsche. Volksdeutsche di -- I talking\nabout the people which checking the -- the people who smuggle, was a different\ntype of soldier, sometimes was a Volksdeutsche was -- Volksdeutsche was a\nPolish people which f-feeling they are -- they\u2019re German. They have a -- like a\n[indecipherable] like a half German. The \u2018nother -- this was the worst. The \u2018nother\nwas a [indecipherable] the people which keep this -- usually most soldier which\ntake care about the trains, you know, and the people be [indecipherable] by the\ntrain. These people rather was the not so very bad because they looking always\nthey [indecipherable] to steal something. That mean those people smuggle in\nsomething, they always split something from these people because they send this\nback in spa -- back -- back to the German. This was not so very bad, but the worst\nwas the Gestapo, because the Gestapo sometime -- this was -- this was terrible.\nThis was kill on the spot, too.",

        "Q: How do you feel now toward armed conflict in the world?",
        "A: This 1s very, very difficult situation. This is very difficult situation, I don\u2019t\nknow how this -- everything will be finish. Is very difficult situation because is too\nmany terrorists, too many terrorists and this -- this terrorist 1s not terrorist pri-\nproblem. The ter -- the problem I think is the fanatics, and the -- the lot of leaders\nwhich you know, bring the young people to the -- to the fighting [indecipherable] I\n-- | feeling now how was the leader, we as young boy during the German -- during\nthe German occupation and this young people was bring to this action b -- at home\nby the older people. But we\u2019re fighting, we\u2019re feeling, we -- we -- we\u2019re feeling\nwe're trusting, we know what we\u2019re fighting for. In the same way I think lot of\nyoung people -- because if you take a look at these terrorists are young people, the\nsame the youth, the brave -- we no [indecipherable] wars, because we was patriot,\nbut these people, I think they -- like you [indecipherable] wars, and this the reason\nthat the -- this the -- the reason that they fighting, they are fanatics. They are\nfighting maybe they did it or something, what about. I tell you the example, th-the\nvery s -- the very simple example. In 1936, I think I was student, and this time was\nfight in the Spain between communist and Franco. And lot of people from Poland\n-- not a lot, but some young student, tried to run away from Poland, go to the\nSpain for fighting. One, oh, I will be fighting with the -- against the Franco, I go\nbe -- are you going to Franco, fight against the communists, you know the people\njust would like to do something, you know? Have so much energy they tried to do\nsomething. And this is the same -- same situation here, and this, I think is similar\nsituation because this terrorists what is coming, they\u2019re coming from different\ncountry, even if the Afghanistan, even if the -- in the Iraq, they coming the people,\nand not only the people which living over there, coming the -- the terrorist from\ndifferent -- from different country. You know about this. And this is -- this 1s the\nproblem. This is a very difficult situation, I don\u2019t know how [indecipherable]\nsurvive this is very, very difficult situation. Bush, my opinion going right way, but\nhe is -- has very, very, very difficult job, because with the partisan, what is\npartisan is very difficult to win. I know how during the German occupation, the\nGerman and th -- cannot win the partisan, and the -- the Russian, which is a much\nstronger, much [indecipherable] would try -- try fighting with the Afghanistan and\nthey go away from the Washingt -- Afghanistan they cannot win this, and th-the\nproblem is he -- not simply -- not easy. United State have a good politic because\nthey tried to involve in that -- to bring a de-democracy by the people which living\nover there, but still there\u2019s too many fanatics. This is a problem and the -- th-the\nproblem, education over there, the level of education, the people [indecipherable]\nnot very high. They know how reading and writing, but this -- this only\neverything, and this the reason that they still -- th-the reason that they still going to\nthe -- to the order of [indecipherable], or this -- or the -- this own priest, you know,\nI talking priest, but [indecipherable] this little -- that priest, you know. And this\n[indecipherable] his own business, not the business the country, not the business\nnothing, so it\u2019s -- they know if there will be democracy, they lost the power, they\nlost everything, because of democracy will not accepted the -- the fanatics.",
        "Q: So you think war is all right.",
        "A: The -- listen, it\u2019s no -- is not another way, no. What -- what you can do another\nway with these people?

        "A: Middle class, but attend to the pretty good gymnasium. The story was this way,\nmy wi -- my father didn\u2019t believe there will be -- Poland will be free very long\ntime, and he taught me that if I will be survive, I have to s-study in the gymnasium\nwill be the good s -- good language. It was the to -- different schools it we -- I\nattend to the fi -- first -- first of all he ask me which language I prefer, Russian or\nGerman, because it was [indecipherable] I preferred German. Th-The reason I\nattend to the private s -- g-gymnasium Mikoyrai, what was practically run by the\nevangeli -- og -- evangi -- no -- the li -- evangelism ch-church, you know? And\nmost these people, the student would attend was from the German family, they\nspeak home German. That what there 1s, on that I was a very poor student with the\nGerman. Every year I have a student, you know, which teach me during the\nvacation. Usually my parents with another parents, you know, hired the student\nfrom the Germany, and to -- during the two months we sent for vacation, two or\nthree guys, and tal -- two or three months we talk German only. If we say between\nus one word Polish, the guy beat us because he thought [indecipherable] that we\u2019re\nst -- talking something against him. Th-The reason when I come home I start talk\nto my mother, you know, the German. And -- and this was -- was very good\nbecause this -- th-thanks to this I survive. It was many times this, during the\nGerman occupation that I survived. The first -- first day when the German arrived,\nyou know, on the [indecipherable] place, you know, they stop me, the French\ngendarmerie did, was the French gendarmerie and I was so upset, you know,\nbecause W-Warsaw survived -- surrendered, it was the first or second day, and the\nger -- the -- they [indecipherable] the people you know, to cover the holes, which\nwas where -- was for the [indecipherable] the bombs. And he ca -- ask me. You\nhave to work in [indecipherable] what for? And I -- very friendly German, I talk\nwith him, what for? [indecipherable] and he told -- he told me [indecipherable] me\nthis, I\u2019m sorry for you. I was so surprised that this way. He think probably that I\nam German. It was the de -- the reason that many time during the action -- I\nremembered another time, during the German occupation, I have lot of friends,\nyou know, what speaking for German [indecipherable] you know, and once during\nthere was the people g -- wa -- catch the people to -- to German. We have -- we\ncarry in the pocket, you know, the big sign, and [indecipherable] this was a sign\n[indecipherable] German member for the na-national [indecipherable] the national\nsocialist [indecipherable], but I will put in the pocket and this way we -- we so like\ndrunk, and to -- oh, you go away. It was the second time I survive, you know, like\nyoung people drink? Risk, make a lot of risk. How many times they dri -- they\ngoing with the, you know, with the guns during -- because we make a lot of\nsabotage, lot of working against th-the Nazis. We make many, many different\naction. The action -- the first my -- action was like in 19 -- 1940 or \u201941, we put the\nha -- to -- German got out, the Polish got out, you put the -- no, 1t wasn\u2019t a bomb\nburst, 1t was like a material would make a fire, what would burn the German tr-tr-\ntrucks and the Polish trucks. You -- it was my first action. And then later we blow\nthat -- I was trained, and we bl-blow that train. The same time I attend to the\nPolytech Institute because in the m -- in the beginning the German close the old\nschool, and later they opened the school only for the technician school, you know,\nthey need -- they don\u2019t -- they need only the people to work, the working people\nthat there is on that -- they opened the school for the technician and this -- this way\nwe working with -- and I attend to this -- this Polytechnic Institute, I study\nmechanic engineering. It wa-was not engineering [indecipherable] engineering,\nthey call it technical, the engineering was too high educated for the Polish people,\nthe Polish like -- supposed to be slaves. But the same time wa -- working -- was al-\nalways belong to the underground army, until I was trained like a miner, and my\nspecialist was the blowing the train. I-It was during the action what we did few\ntimes, it was action, the -- one day, the same day or the same time was to blow out\nthe train in many places, that\u2019s [indecipherable] it was this organization, and I was\ntrained, you know, the blowing the train. We trained [indecipherable] the trains\nwould bring supply for that -- wou-would bring supply to the east front, or we\nblow the train, which was most important, they could [indecipherable] special\ntrain would bring the German soldier from the east front to vaca -- for vacation to\nGermany. There was th -- it was most difficult because this train has a very strong\n-- very strong, you know, safety purpose. On the beginning, on the end of that\ntrain, there was a se -- se -- machines gun. Additional, this train has in the front of\nthe machine gun, the locomotive, two cars who are loading with the -- with the\nsand, you know, to prevent the -- if they were blowing the -- preferred they would\nbe blowing the empty -- the cars, not the -- not the locomotive. There was -- we\nfind this, they will make a method that was special delayed, they will blow up not\nthe empty train, but the train with the -- with the soldiers.",

This is a problem and the -- th-the\nproblem, education over there, the level of education, the people [indecipherable]\nnot very high.
