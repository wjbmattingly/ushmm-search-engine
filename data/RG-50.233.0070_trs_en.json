        "DECEMBER 8, 1991",
        "New York, New York\nI am immediately transported back to fifty years ago as you mentioned, December 8 and it was\nDecember 7 that I was in Budapest with my mother and my sister Chicha and we had gone to\nBudapest from the small town where I lived in Kisvarda, Hungary because we had received\ninstructions from my father in America to go to see the American consul in Budapest on Monday\nmorning. It was December 8. But we are now December 7 and my mother and my sister and I are\nenjoying a very happy and special breakfast at a friend's house in a beautiful part of Budapest,\nBuda,as a matter of fact, and we are looking forward to the appointment tomorrow morning because\nthat appointment is going to bring us to the promised land of America. And we were full of\nexpectations and joy because we are the chosen family, the lucky ones who will escape Hitler's\nhatred and it was Sunday morning and we were having this wonderful breakfast and the radio was\nturned on by our host and we heard the announcement that Hungary has declared war against the\nUnited States and that was of course Pearl Harbor, December 7, and since Hungary declared war\nagainst the United States needless to say there was no appointment at the American consul the\nfollowing morning so the very happy Sunday morning turned into a very tragic day, a very tragic\nbreakfast and that announcement on the radio resulted in our eventual deportation to Auschwitz\n[Japanese naval forces attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 at 7:55 a.m Hawaii time;\nHungary did not declare war on the United States on December 8, but Germany and Italy did so on\nDecember 11; Britain declared war on Hungary on December 6, 1941; the United States declared\nwar on Hungary on June 5, 1942].\nSo Hungary was not the promised land in 1941?\nHungary was the cursed land from the day I remember. I was always called the dirty Jew, smelly\nJew, the translation is smelly Jew. And I was called that by my classmates and as I was walking\ndown the main streets of my home town Kisvarda the riffraff hanging about referred to me as the\nsmelly Jew. I was not smelly, a very dear child of a wonderful Jewish family. I had to live with this\ninsult always and we thought that that's the way it is everywhere. It's certainly that way where I am\nliving. The anti-semitism was fierce always. If it was not on the surface it was so deeply imbedded\nin the character of the people we shared the town with, the non-Jews that it was a living presence\nalways. I do not remember anything but an anti-semitic atmosphere. That's what I grew up in, that's\nwhat I lived in, that's what I hoped to escape. When Hitler came of course all that was intensified a\nthousand fold and there was no escape.",
        "Could we back up a little bit and talk about the family and growing up in Kisvarda. When were you\nborn?\nIn May 28 1921.\nIn Kisvarda?\nIn Kisvarda.\nYour family?\nThey were, my mother I believe born in the town she grew up in she came from a town called\nHajdunanas. I have never been there 1t was some kilometers away, probably not very far, but those\ndays it seemed far. And she was the daughter of a very distinguished rabbi. It was a whole line of\nrabbinical background. From what I understand it was a very distinguished rabbinical background\nher mother was a Schreiber [scribe]. The word Schreiber is a writer [a scribe] and I think in\nHebrew it was called Sofair and there is great distinction to that name and I think that all of the\nSchreibers are the same family all over the world. My grandmother I think was actually the one\nwho inherited the rabbinical seed. It comes from her father I believe. And that she must have\nmarried my grandfather whose name was Halpert and he became the rabbi of the town Hajdunanas\nand then he died before I was born and my mother had enormous respect and high, tremendously\nhigh regard for her father. I always heard her talk about her father, not so much about her mother\nwhom we knew and I don't know, we weren't crazy about her, but my grandfather my mother spoke\nof with tremendously high regard that he was an extraordinarily intelligent man and a great\nTalmudic scholar who has written Talmudic works as many members of the family have written\nmany large Talmudic contributions to the Talmudic literature and I remember big books that were\nwritten by them, various members of my mothers family. And my mother claimed always that her\nfather as she spoke of him she would say that he was a very sensitive man and that he was very\nintelligent and he was so sensitive that he could not live with the idea that man kills his fellow man\nand evidently he died of a heart attack. But my mother always associated his death with the first\nworld war that it was such a blow to his philosophy of humanity that he couldn't live with the\nbrutality of the war even though I am sure that he knew the history of the world was full of wars but\nprobably because he was right in the midst of this world wide conflict which was evidently not\nmuch of a war in comparison to the one that followed it. And I always heard these very sensitive\ntalks about my grandfather. She evidently loved him very much. I never met him. He died during\nthe first world war, several years before I was born. My mother was one of seven children. There\nwere five girls and two boys. Both of the boys became rabbis. My uncle, one of my uncles, was\nthe rabbi in [ph 124 Shumkutch?] which eventually became Romania and Transylvania you know",
        "after the first World War and I remember him well because he came to our house once and I\nremember him on a Sunday morning listening to the radio and because in his own home as a rabbi\nhe did not have one in those days and he was an enormously tall beautiful looking man with a long\nbeard and the long kaftan and a remarkably sophisticated for the position he was in. And my\nmothers younger brother became the rabbi after his father died in this town, Hajdunanas, but also\nvery tall and very distinguished looking gentleman. Whenever I heard about my mother's family\nfrom strangers, visitors, people who we met as we travelled somewhere, that they were a very\nspecial family because the members of the family were very intelligent and very cultivated people.\nMy mother was in particular spoken of as the most intelligent of all. The kids who had worldly\nambitions that she could not fulfill because she was the daughter of a rabbi. She had to toe the line\nso to speak and could not do really what she wanted to do, but her mind was so active that she\nabsorbed all of the worldly influences not only that came her way but that she sought out and she\nwas a reader. She's read such an enormous amount. She was so cultivated and her ambition was to\nbecome a physician which she, of course, could not fulfill because of the status of her family. You\nknow the very religious rabbinical daughter would not go to a medical school, of course, but she\nwould have to get married at the age of eighteen or nineteen to a chosen groom who was of high\nreputation. My father was the son of a landowner, a very religious Jewish family from a small town.\nBut an arranged marriage came about because he was an outstanding Talmudic Yeshiva Bucher.\nHow do you translate Yeshiva Bucher? [Yeshiva student]\nRabbinical school\nRabbinical school and he had an extraordinary mind. As people were talking about my mother\nbeing so very intelligent he was being talked about as being the most learned Talmudic student and\nindeed he was really famous. Even to the point if today I go to one of these weddings, the\ndescendants of these people who come from my mother's hometown or my hometown or any other\npart of Hungary, they would remember this very intelligent Toby, my mother's Yiddish name.\nToby\nTereza, Terry Maria Tereza was her Hungarian name\nMaria Tereza?\nMaria Tereza, evidently she was named after the Hapsburg queen and my mother named me after\nQueen Isabella. I don't know what the association is the royal hangup.",
        "Could you please spell your mother's name?\nI think itwasTEREZA.\nAnd her last name?\nHALPERT\nAnd your father's?\nMy father's name was Menhir. I heard it spelled as Menyhert the e has an umlaut [accent], Katz K A\nT Z. And he was a very handsome looking man, a really beautiful face. He was totally different\nfrom my mother. My mother was steeped in this quiet worldly knowledge and cultivation of music\nand literature and my father shut all of that out entirely and was only interested and focused in on\nHasidic and Talmudic matters and Talmudic world. That was his world. So they were really two\nopposites, yet giants in their own rights\nequally matched in level of intellect\nYes the level of intellect was on par evidently but one was in total opposition to the other.\nWhat kind of schooling did your mother have?\nProbably public school and probably not much schooling because that was forbidden also in that\ncircle but tremendous self education. That was probably on par with any college eduction that we\nknow. The six children who came to this insane world of Auschwitz and some of us survived, then\nto America - whatever we are is what my mother poured into us; not my father at all because we\nwere not interested in his world but my mother poured so much into us that I feel we have had an\neducation on top of whatever little education was available to people in our station. It was so hugely\nenriched by my mother who endowed us with it, never stopped. I remember we would ask her\nquestions and she would say \"How would I know. I was six years old a long time ago.\" Two\nminutes later she gave the answer, of course. She had the answer to almost everything. We all talk\nabout her with such rich memories and admiration and I am sure it is justified. So many people\ncannot be wrong. So many people who still mention her with such reverence. I personally was",
        "unquestioningly like my father. There was something about her and he was nowhere near as good\nand gentle as my mother. He was much rougher in many ways but somehow I liked him. I always\nhad criticism from my mother but I didn't like many of the things, many of her ways, but I am my\nmothers daughter and I am trying to fulfill her expectations of me, almost totally ignoring what my\nfather might have expected from us. As a matter of fact I think all of us are fulfilling the\nexpectations my mother had of us and trusted that we would come through with those values that\nshe poured into us that were so important to her. And I think we did come through intact almost\nwith her values and her ideas about life both in humanitarian method which was the number one\nissue in her life - to be an absolute humanitarian. Although she was fully aware of the cruelties that\nman is capable of. I think that probably she didn't know the details of Auschwitz. She never even\nheard of Auschwitz because maybe in this country there were headlines in the New York Times but\nwe never heard the word Auschwitz. We lived in a totally repressive country where fascism was the\norder of the day. We didn't know anything. We only knew what Hitler fed us in the controlled\npress and the controlled radio. So we had absolutely no way of knowing anything and we certainly\ndidn't know they were burning people and because we were the last country occupied, all those\nyears passed us by with deprivations. We did not get enough potatoes or enough bread because\nHitler stole everything from my country. But we lived in our homes and we had no idea. We never\nheard the word Warsaw ghetto, only some of these people who were in leadership positions all\nover. The world knew a great deal more than we knew. We are even accused today. Why didn't we\ndo something? Why didn't we go. Who knew anything and certainly who would expect that the war\nis not going to end and we will be alive. We have suffered deprivations, separation from my father\nand everything sounded terribly ominous and frightening from what we heard of Hitler's speeches\nwhich were on incessantly and that he hates the Jews but none of that added up to a crematorium\nand we knew that certain people were caught and interrogated and beaten. We heard these stories\nfrom people who passed by trying to escape from neighboring countries which were occupied by\nHitler, like Czechoslovakia and Romania. They passed through and told us some horror tales.\nThose people were interrogated but no one said anything about people being transported in cattle\ncars to another planet named Auschwitz and burned. When we heard these gruesome stories we\nwere as incredulous as people are today when we tell them about the holocaust. Who would believe\nit?",
        "What kind of stories did you hear from refugees? Were they coming from Poland or Germany?",
        "No not from Poland or Germany. They usually came from Slovakia and Czechoslovakia and\nRomania. Those around us who passed by managed to escape and they found a nice lodging in my\nhome because my mother was always in the forefront of aiding the disadvantaged. So as children\nwe listened to some of these tales but there were not that many people who escaped and found their\nway to our home and how much do children believe; today there is television to show them what\nhappens in Ethiopia and children starving and all these horrible things that are. But at least it's\nshown on TV. It is more believable. But then the kids go back to school and go and listen to their",
        "rock and roll music and figure it is far away, it's not where we are; it's not going to happen to us, we\nare human beings.\nSpeaking of school what kind of schools did you attend? Can you tell us something about going to\nschool in Kisvarda?\nYes, there was a Jewish elementary school that my family was not allowed to attend because my\nfather was an anti-zionist. And they taught about zionism in the Jewish school. It's kind of crazy.\nMy father sent me to a non-Jewish school, the town elementary school,then we would go to junior\nhigh there. And it starts somewhere early. We didn't go to gymnasium, but very few Jews attended\nthe gymnasium and it wouldn't have been people like my father's children because he wouldn't\nallow us to go for that worldly education. Wo you know it starts somewhere after Junior High and\nmaybe it starts early enough, before eighteen.\nFourteen or so?\nProbably there were some kind of courses that we were attending. I remember that one time\nHungary was friends with Italy when Mussolini was still the good guy and there was something\ncalled Istituto Italiana di Cultura and we attended courses like that and there was a tremendous\namount of self education and reading and a tremendous amount at home and my mother's prompting\nand the kids all were very interested in all of the worldly matters and that kind of education went on\nin the home forever. When my father went to America we were able to send Rachel to a more....\nRachel being your younger sister?\nMy younger sister. My father was no longer there so my mother was able to send her to further\nschooling. I don't know how far she got but then when it came to my youngest sister, Potyo, it was\nthe antisemitism. When Hitler came was at our doorstep I know that she was brutalized. Her\nschool life was cut short with real brutality. I think she was thirteen and a half when she was killed.\nI think she was thirteen in January and she was killed in May in 1944. But as she was going to\nschool she was - I don't know a year or two, sometime before they deported us I don't have the time\nframe - she developed the - what is this thing you get?\nAppendicitis?",
        "Appendicitis, and she had to be operated on. In those days an operation like that was a major event\nand you had to stay home at least six weeks after the operation. I don't know how long she was in\nthe hospital but she had to be removed from school and had to have surgery. When she was at home\nrecovering and was getting very lonely and anxious to go back to school and my mother went to her\nschool. They refused her. She was not permitted to reenter school because she was out. Once she\nwas out for that long time they got rid of her and that was another Jewish kid they got rid of and\nthey don't have to take her back. She was no longer in the school system. They refused to take her\nback and I remember the child suffering enormously, pleading with my mother that she should go\nback to school and beg the principal to take her back. She was lonely and she was not learning\nanything and all her friends were in school and it was a tragic time. In the end she wound up in\nAuschwitz and she never went back to school. But I remember it with great pain, how she suffered\nfrom not being allowed to reenter school. Now some of the other Jewish kids probably continued\nbut this was a good way to get rid of another Jewish child. There is lots to say about my sister\nPotyo who was truly a child of war, as we all were children of war, but none more than she was\nbecause she was really born into the war. She was 13 years old. I'm talking now about 1944 so she\nmust have been born in 1931.\nHer name was?\nHer name was Helen but we called her Potyo that's some kind of endearing term for I don't know\n\"the little one\"\nThe baby in the family?\nYes, the baby in the family.\nAnd that's spelled?\nPOTYO O with an umlaut [accent]. And she was a very beautiful child and different from the other\nchildren in my family. Hitler was riding high already when she was growing up and she didn't even\nknow anything else than a life that is colored by Hitler and his speeches and everything else. She\nwas a different kind of child from the rest of us, tremendously self- centered and obviously a very\nintelligent child. You know I have great pain talking about her even now and by now she would be\nwell over 50. She would be an old woman and it would....\nOver 50, that's not old.",
        "But to me she 1s that child, that beautiful 13 year old lean child who evidently knew nothing but fear\nand love in her - this enormous love for the family and this fear of what Hitler's era did to her and\nthe war came. She was 9 years old when the war broke out and I can only think of her as fear and\nlove and by fear 1 mean the fact that she was so terrified of being torn away from the family. She\nwas already a tall little girl a normal not a little bit of a child, but a growing little child and she\ninsisted on sleeping with my mother. When my father left she always slept with my mother, but\neven when my father was home she wanted to sleep with my mother because she was afraid. I\nremember I do not know if other members of my family remember her crying out in the middle of\nthe night having terrible dreams and it was Hitler, something about Hitler. So this was a child of\nfear and love. The love of her family was enormous and I think her death might be somewhat the\nresult of her wanting to be with her mother because I am sure that she hung onto my mother,\nwanted to go with her wherever she was going and sure enough Mengele did ask her. From the\naccounts I heard from my sisters, my two sisters who were on their way to the crematorium because\nMengela picked us out separately. He picked out Chicha and myself first and my older sister, C1p1,\nand Rachel kept going to the crematortum and then Mengele turned around the group and made\nanother selection. I think Rachel still to this day does not remember if it was Potyo or she who\nanswered Mengele's question of \"Du kleine, wie alt bist du?\" and you little one, how old are you?\nAnd the indication was that he asked her for her age to contemplate to pick her out. Had she said 15\nhe probably would have put her out to the life side but my sister Rachel does not remember if it was\nthe child who answered, Potyo, that she was only 13, not saying that I am 13 and a half but lying a\nhalf a year, or she, Rachel, said it; and that sentence haunted, has been haunting Rachel all her life\nand she still doesn't know if she said it or the child said it and she's never free of guilt and its been a\nterrible life for her because she has been suffering tremendously. And Potyo wanted to go with my\nmother. Whether Potyo was killed with my mother in the crematortum or whether she was put in\nthe open fire that they built in those days when the Hungarian Jews were brought in. The\ncrematoriums were working day and night in Auschwitz and they burned according to the Kapo\nwho told us, who was there many years before. She survived a number of years. Eventually she\nwas killed also, but she told us that never had she seen in Auschwitz this kind [ph 510 homage] as\nwhen the Hungarian Jews were brought in. And whereas they used to burn 10,000 people a day\nthey were burning 10 to 24,000 people a day and the crematoriums. I think there were 5 of them.\nFour or five of them were not proved sufficient enough for the daily carnage so they built open fires\nand evidently Elie Wiesel saw some of these live children being thrown into the fires because there\nwas no room in the crematoriums. And I am still haunted because I don't now if Potyo because she\nwas a child was thrown alive into the open fire or if she was put into the crematorium but I do know\nthis much that I saw the flames and I heard the shrieks and it was obvious that in addition to the fire\nthat was burning in the crematoriums there was another fire to accommodate the extra world of the\nextra burden of Jews that they felt had to be burned up so there was a lot of live burning.",
        "Do you recall the date?",
        "Oh yes it was May 31, 1944.\nJust a day after your birthday?\nNo, we left Kisvarda on the May 29 and my birthday is on May 28 and that's the day we were\npacking for what they called the deportation and we didn't know what the hell it meant, deportation.\nBut we were packing getting ready for this.\nWho ordered you to pack?\nWho ordered us to pack? The sixteen year old SS who came into the ghetto of Kisvarda with a\nsilver pistol and a dog. I guess a German Shepherd and this is the first time we saw the Germans\nbecause after that point Hitler marched into Hungary on March 19, 1944 Sunday afternoon then in\nquick succession because they have learned their own method of madness by then so well of how to\nkill Jews. First they started manually killing one by one then they developed these incredibly\nsophisticated ways of burning them and gassing them and burning them and all that, and by the time\nit came to Hungary what they started in 1939 what they started in Poland, let's say, ended up in\nHungary as a push button system and that's how they were able to desecrate the Hungarian Jewish\npopulation in a matter of three weeks I believe. 600,000 Hungarian Jews I believe, it was a highly\ndeveloped system. But Hitler marched in on March 19 1944 and probably about four weeks later,\nwhich was the day after Passover they allowed us to stay in our homes on Passover, for Passover,\nand the day after Passover we were herded into the ghetto.\nBy the Germans?\nBy the Hungarians.\nBy the Hungarians?\nBy the Hungarian Gendarmes the most cruel creatures on the face of the earth with their high hats\nand feathers and rifles and shoulders.\nNo Germans in Kisvarda yet?",
        "No. It was the Gendarmes - the I don't remember much activity by the policemen but I do\nremember the Gendarmes. I remember clearly two Gendarmes took each family into the ghetto.\nThey came to each home - two Gendarmes - and delivered them into the ghetto with their fifty kilos\non their backs. And we did not see the Germans. Evidently the machinery worked in such a way\nthat the Germans had no authority on the fate of the Hungarian Jews until just before the deportation\nand then they seemed to co-mingle with the Gendarmes - the Gendarmes and the Nazis, the SS.\nThe first time we saw the SS was on Sunday afternoon May 28, 1944, on my birthday. And he\ncame in with the Gendarmes and they lined up all of the ...1 remember this beautiful sunny\nafternoon in May and we were ordered out of our cramped quarters and I think in each courtyard\nthey lined them up - I think the gendarmes did that and the ghetto police and people who worked in\nthe ghetto in some kind of leadership positions - and we were to appear in the courtyard and then the\nNazi came and he announced each name. As he called out the names, the names that were called\nout had to move over to the other side.\nHow did they know the names?\nThe names were collected well in advance by the Jewish management -people evidently the Nazis\nhad dealt with from Budapest throughout the country with this. They had various.....\nDid you have a council?\nYea, they had a council I guess.\nHow far back was this council set up?\nOh this was after Hitler marched in but before we were taken to the ghetto because this was when\nwe were in our home yet. And they had an actual census taker - one or two people assigned for\nthese jobs. Whether they were paid jobs, I don't remember. But I know that they came to our home.\nThey went to each home with a form and they listed each person living in that home. So there was\nno escape from that. You couldn't lie and say Mrs. Katz lives here but her children are not living\nhere - everybody was listed. And they compiled this - it was a regular census taking of Jews.\nOnly of Jews?\nOnly of Jews, of course.",
        "And no one suspected anything?\nNoone suspected anything. We knew that Hitler is doing his things but what this would result in,\nwe didn't know. This was another craziness that we had to comply with. And a lot of the orders\nprior to taking us to the ghetto were handed down to us by a town crier in the center of town, in the\ncircle; the town crier with his drum and his little funny hat and his uniform with a very important air\nabout him. He was an absolute idiot but he knew how to tap this out and how to read enough to\nread the orders that came to him from Budapest or from the council, certainly from the Nazi\nmachinery. And he would read out these orders. Whether you were in the town square or not you\nhad to know the orders. Not knowing the law was no excuse of course like it isn't here either. The\nkids would run home and tell their parents that these were the new orders and all that and then an\nhour later he would appear again and give out new orders - Jews cannot have bicycles. You have to\ntake them into the town hall. Jews can have no radios. This happened all the time and larger news\ncame from the Fascist newspapers that we were still able to purchase in which they what the Jewish\nstar has to be made of - how many inches of the yellow star, which side of the coat you have to wear\niton. All of these things came from the newspapers and then they were repeated by the town crier\nand the restrictions - every minute something else - every hour something else. All of this was\nheralded through the radio while we still had the radio, before we had to turn it in - and the\nnewspapers and the town crier. We were bombarded with it day and night.\nYou had to move out of your home, didn't you?\nWe did not have to move out of our home until they took us, until the two gendarmes came and took\neach family from the home and took us to the ghetto and then we ...\nSo you lived outside of the ghetto?\nWe lived on the main street in a perfectly beautiful home.\nAnd you weren't forced to move into the ghetto?\nNot for - it happened so fast. He marched in March 19. I don't know when Passover was then.\nApril",
        "Well, we had our Passover at home and the day after Passover the two gendarmes came to each\nhome with the list. In this home in this address these are the number of Jews who live. And we\nwere given orders to take 50 kilos of our best clothing and best food. Of course which they\nconfiscated immediately. They made us bring our finest clothes for the Germans.\nSo you brought your best clothes?\nOh absolutely. I remember what I was wearing when we boarded the cattle car. I was wearing a\nbeautiful big flowing cashmere coat with brown suede platform shoes made to order. They were\nbeautiful and I had a beautiful big handbag, beige, matching my coat. It was summer. It was May,\nit was hot but we didn't know where we were going. We dared not take our best coat.\nThey didn't tell you where you were going?\nDeportation, to the east. Whatever that meant, we had no idea.\nDo you recall what your mother was wearing?\nI\"m afraid I don't but it seems to me that she was wearing a wig usually, but this time she was\nwearing a kerchief on her head instead of wearing a wig and I remember her frantically shopping for\nlast minute food. They had kept the Jewish food stores open until a minute before they took us\naway, ten o'clock in the morning or whenever they had to close the Jewish shops and I remember\nmy mother sending me out to the store. That was very fancy, like a delicatessen kind of store nght\noutside of our courtyard on the main street. And she sent me out for a quarter pound of butter or\nsomething and I remember how the lady (by the way lived in our courtyard also, the people who\nowned the store, and they were very successful and it was a very elegant store.) She was counting\nthe pennies how I paid for the butter. In that respect it seems like insanity that I had to give every\nlast penny that the butter was priced at because I guess she thought she was coming back. Of\ncourse, she was killed immediately. She was a young woman. Her husband and her two children,\nthey were all murdered immediately. And then the gendarmes came and rolled down the iron roller\nthe way they used on the stores there. Shut the stores down. But I remember my mother went out\nto the market. There was a marketplace where you would buy live chickens, fruits and all kinds of\nthings while they were available. I clearly remember that my mother, a woman who came from\nsuch a religious background, went out to the market and bought ham because she wanted her\nchildren to be well fed in the train on that trip going east because there was no use trying to be\nkosher anymore. At least to her it was more important that her children should have some",
        "nourishing food than that it should be kosher. I'm not even sure that she ate it but I remember that\nshe bought ham for us - so that we would have a ham sandwich on the train. We didn't know then\nthat it was a cattle car.\nYou expected to travel in a passenger coach?\nWe had no idea because we didn't see these cattle cars before they pulled up. As a matter of fact we\nnever saw them until they pulled up because we sat out at the railroad station on the sand. We were\nkind of lying down and devastated by heat and thirst and then we were guarded by Germans and the\ngendarmes and everyone with rifles and we just couldn't stand on our feet so we lay down on our\nbackpacks. The insanity began but we didn't know what we were waiting for and we waited all the\nway till the afternoon. I think they took us away in the morning from the ghetto to the railroad\nstation. We didn't know what we were waiting for. So we were at the railroad station but there\nwere no cars yet. There were no trains. And then these cattle cars pulled up. That's what we were\nwaiting for all day, evidently. And the cattle cars pulled up and they shoved us in and the little\nwindow in the cattle car was barred with iron bars and then we found ourselves 75 or maybe more\nstanding in this cattle car like sardines. And then the fun began.\nThis was when you were separated from your baggage at that point?\nNo we were separated from the baggage - I am talking now about Kisvarda - we were not separated\nfrom our baggage until we arrived in Auschwitz.\nSo the baggage went into the cattle cars with you?\nYes and we were trying to sit on those baggages. I remember my mother was sitting against the\nwall, the far wall of the cattle car on these baggages that we had arranged for her and she was sitting\nthere with my sister, Potyo, and my brother kind of laid down in front of her, he placed some other\nbackpacks - 1t was 50 kilos each of us carried and he laid them down. But there was not enough\nroom so he lay on top of that and we sat on top of him, sort of. And of course there were no sanitary\n- there was some kind of a....\nA barrel?",
        "It wasn't a barrel. It was something smaller than that. That's what we used for a toilet and it was\nsplashing all over\nA bedpan?\nIt wasn't a bedpan. It was one of those big [kubel] 803 we used to call it, [kubel]. Then it was\nsplashing all over. By this time the whole thing was out of this world. People screaming, and I had\nmy period and I couldn't change my napkin, and people were dying already and going mad.\nDid anyone argue or resist in any way before getting on the train? I imagine the moment you saw\nthese cattle cars, must have been a shock of some sort.\nWe were surrounded by men with rifles. They all wore rifles, the SS had the ----------[814] those\npistols. And all these aides, Hungarians and Germans, they were all wearing rifles and we knew\nthey shoot immediately. You know if your spine was crooked they'll shoot you.\nSo you were too afraid to complain?\nOh there was no way to oppose, to do anything because these were not fighters. These were\nchildren and old people. The young men were all taken away long before into the labor battalions.\nAnd these were all young people and women and children and old and sick. What were you going\nto fight with?\nYour entire family?\nThe six of us. The six children and my mother. My father was already in America. But my brother\ndid try, fought the best he could. He went over to the Nazi at one of the stops, when we were\nalready choking because there was no air through that barred window, and he tried to make a deal\nwith him to take off the bars so that more air would come in. I think that there was one at this end\nand one at the other end, I don't remember. And he tried to pry it I think with his hands apart to get\nsome air. And as the train stopped he dared to go over to the Nazi and offer him some kind of bribe\nand for some reason I seem to remember, but he could tell you this better, there was some kind of a\nscissors they needed, or something or other, I wish you would check with him. He gave them a\nscissors or something and then he didn't keep his promise. He was going to pry the window open\nbut he didn't keep his promise. He took the scissors. I don't know if I'm telling you the story right.",
        "It's something that you might want to check with him. But he fought to get us air, I know that. He\nfought as best as he could. And the rest of us I guess want to stay alive until we finally arrive at this\n\"east\" place that we are deported to and where the families will be together we heard. And they will\nhave good treatment. We will work for the war effort but we will be treated well. We heard these\ntalks somewhere along that we will be treated well and work for the war effort and families will be\ntogether. So all we wanted to do is arrive at this precious place, you see, this east where we are\ndeported to and the families will be together. So lets get this insane trip over with because after this\neverything will be all right. And after that, two days later, we arrived at someplace that said\nAuschwitz M[861]. And we had no idea what that meant. And then it all began, you know.\nMengele and the crematoriums and the whole thing but you probably don't want to hear about that.\nYou have enough of that. All over. My mother, I remember, sitting through those two days from\nMonday afternoon through Wednesday afternoon. That's how long the trip took. She sat against\nthat wall cuddling my little sister and her eyes were filled with perception of this thing that we are in\nand that we are going to and there was no question that she knew in her soul what is happening.\nShe knew that this is the final road, the final trip, that this will result in death. I don't know how she\ncould have known there was a crematorium or a gas chamber but in her soul it was obvious that she\nknew everything and there was only one prayer in her eyes as she kept looking at her children that\nthey should survive this, that they should outlive this madness because there is a world out there that\nhas humanity still locked in somewhere and this is a passing madness of a madman but there is\ngoodness and there is dignity and there is life and there is purpose and man has a mind with which\nhe can create wondrous things and we should live up to those images in her head, those ideas that\nshe had rather than what the moment is which is evidently the ugliest part of humanity and that we\nhave to go beyond that and look for that in man which is noble and creative and good and has\nintellect of mind. All of these things were written in her eye. She spoke to us silently. She knew\neverything. I remember her having kind of a resigned look. I will not live but remember that there\nis so much to live for and you all should live for what can be not what is now here in front of us. To\nme it was unmistakable that she never stopped transmitting these messages while she was rocking in\nthat hideous cattle car. That car was jerking like this. I just have no doubt about it that she spoke to\nus all the time without saying anything. And I think her legacy was heard by us and understood and\nin some mysterious way it added to the effort that we made to stay alive. Had we not come from\nsuch a noble heart as she had I don't know if we would have been able to make that kind of effort to\nsurvive. But there's no question that she handed down that legacy. Now you can say this about all\nmothers, that their love carried through those who survived and they remembered their mother's\nlegacy. This is the way I have to talk about my mother because she had such largness in her heart.\nI can't put it any other way except that for two days she fed us her vision of a humanity that's greater\nthan what Hitler has created.\nIt seems like she had two visions, the vision of death and the vision of the triumph of humanity.\nShe had the vision of her own life and the triumph of humanity.",
        "Was she the only person in your car to imagine that this was the end?\nNo, I shouldn't think so. I don't know if we saw it as the end. Remember we were young and\nhealthy and not willing to bow our head to Hitler. There is the fighting spirit for you.\nDetermination?\nYeah, we were not willing to accept Hitler as the last word. There is something else out there and\nwe're going to destroy this Hitlerism, this Hitler world when we're free and we can add our voice to\nthose who create a better world. And I guess we always tried. We heard. After all it's that spirit\nthat moved me to wheel the stroller through the Washington marches in the Vietnam days. I took\nboth my kids, my husband and my two kids and we protested the Vietnam war. It was that same\nspirit that we have to fight for a better world, and I fought.\nWere there discussions in the train? Do you recall any discussions among the various families?\nYou probably knew some of the other people.\nThere was no way to get to anybody.\nNo, within your cattle car.\nYes but within the cattle car there was no way to move to the other end of the cattle car so we were\nin this spot, in this tiny little spot, the seven of us and you couldn't even go to the left or to the right.\nThere was no room.\nBut you recognized some of the other people?\nI don't remember anybody or anything. I only remember this little group huddled together trying to\nmake it through the night.\nVery little talking?",
        "Remember the clattering of the cattle car is very noisy.\nPrayers?\nI don't remember praying. I'm sure people were praying but I remember hearing screams and\nnightmarish screams of all kinds. People were going mad and people were dying, and the moans of\nthe sick. Who can ever describe that kind of ride. You know it is very hard to tell after so many\nyears but I think we were focused in on my mother's soul and that soul must have been incessantly\nfeeding us messages of life, not death. That's how I see it. You will talk to my brother and I don't\nknow what he will say but this is my inner interpretation of that trip. No, we didn't see anybody.\nIt was dark, wasn't it?\nOf course it was dark.\nYou had no windows.\nNo light. Who could hear from the screams and the tremendous noise of the rattling of the cars.\nYou couldn't hear your own voice. You could only hear your inner voice which gave you a\nmandate to live or end it right here - let me die or go on. Philip was an extraordinary force of\nstrength. He was all of 19 or 20, 21 and he knew that he was the man in the family that he's\nresponsible as\nlike he was the father of these six women. He was just great. He always has been. He 1s still the\nfather of us all. He is treating us as if we are his children and that my mother ordered him to shield\nher children. And he was shielding us all the time and he tried. How he managed to talk to the\nNazis, I don't know, but he tried to do some kind of negotiation. His story might be entirely\ndifferent than mine but these are my inner interpretations of what my mother was and my baby\nsister who couldn't breathe. Probably wouldn't let her finger go. She must have held on to my\nmother with her entire body and everything within her. My older sister, Cipi\nshe was one of these suffering more grown children because there were only the two little ones and\nmy brother who was shielding everybody and then there were the three grown girls and she had the\nbewildered protective look about her if I can remember. But she was very protective also, always.\nShe was a very good-hearted woman who had a tendency to speak first and think about it later. But\nthe first instinct was always good - to be good. I remember when somebody came into our house as\nthey often did, the gypsy lady who had nine [ph] 1048 million kids and she would come to my",
        "mother and say my children are hungry and my mother would pack things in her potato sack that\nshe came with. My older sister had a tremendous amount of goodness in her. I really remember\none Friday the lady came from a very poverty ridden area of town - a Jewish woman and said that\nit's already Friday afternoon and she doesn't have fish or chicken or largeness (shabbat bread). She\ndoesn't have it because she doesn't have a penny and it's getting too late in the afternoon and she still\ndoesn't have anything for the shabbat.\nThey were so religious that even if they had something on shabbat they wouldn't cook it so it had to\nbe Friday afternoon. And I clearly remember that my older sister had a gold ring with her name in\nit. I don't remember what they called it but it was very fashionable in those days that you would\nhave a ring with a kind of circle here and your name was imprinted in it and she had this gold ring\nthat she's gotten for a birthday or something or other and when she heard this lady come and cry that\nher children are hungry, she doesn't have anything for the shabbat, she just took off her ring and\ngave it to the woman. She was extremely good-hearted and she acted upon the first impulse. She\nthought about it later but she would always act immediately and some of her acts were acts of native\ngoodness. I was so focused in on my little sister that outside of the strength of my sister Chicha\nwho after all 1s responsible for our survival, there is no question about that. I remember her for her\nstrength and I remember my brother for his bigness not even all of this world but also of another\nworld of great ideals, goodnesses. I was duly focused in on the little one most but I remember my\nolder sister. There was always some kind of envy because she had the best clothes and she was the\none to be married off and she was very elegant and very well kept and you had to pay homage to\nthis older sister always.\nHow old was she?\nShe must have been 26, 27, 28, something like that. She was a grown woman.\nBut not married?\nNot married because there were no men around. They were all in the Munkaszolgalat, the labor\nbattalion. But I remember her most for her determination to live. She was the one, of course, who\ndidn't survive but I clearly remember in the second camp, not in Auschwitz but in Birnbaumel when\nshe was wearing this blanket, some kind of blanket that we had and we tore to pieces and each one\nwore another part of the blanket or sometimes we had a whole blanket and she was bundled up in\nthis blanket, frozen to death in the January snow and frost of Eastern Germany which 1s like the\nNorth Pole. I just remember her standing with that blanket on, weighing probably 50 pounds, a\nfrozen skeleton that's still alive. She said to me armless, legless, but I want to survive. Even if my\narms freeze off and my legs freeze off, no matter how much of me 1s left, I want to live, I want to\nsurvive. It made a tremendous impression on me because I didn't think of her as death. I thought\nthat she would be more depressed because I remember at one time that she had a failed love story",
        "where one of these men who came to my town with this labor battalion and she was in love with\none of them and then they took him away. The whole thing busted and she was terribly depressed.\nThis was when we were still at home. She felt like life was not worth living without him. I don't\nremember his name. But she looked like she just doesn't think life is worth living without him. I\nremember I was surprised she was so tremendously pro-life, how she wanted to live, even if only\npart of her is whole. And she's the one who didn't make it. That much can be said for determination\nand human spirit. It's just another indication that there is absolutely no way to tell - you cannot tell\nwhat made one survive. There are no rules to this game that can be detected by any normal human\nbeing and while psychiatrists make these idiotic utterances that survivors guilt I am supposed to be\nfeeling. On top of everything I carry in my battered heart I am supposed to be feeling guilty for\nsurviving. Survivors\u2019 guilt.\nI have never yet been able to consciously put my finger on that pronouncement because I feel guilty\nabout everything I do today; if I say a cross word to my husband, if I mistreat my children, if I insult\nanybody, if I'm not kind, if I'm not sensitive and G-d knows I am sure I do those things. I feel very\nguilty about those things but I have never consciously felt guilty about surviving. When I hear these\nlearned pronouncements and these psychiatrists seem to know so well why we survived and how we\nsurvived and what we feel and all that. What comes to mind is always what Golda Meir said once, I\nheard her on television, who said that she feels guilty not because I didn't do everything within my\npower but because I wasn't there. So I was there. I have no reason to feel guilty. If there is a\nsurvivors\u2019 guilt, it's mysterious to me. Maybe they know something that I don't know but I didn't\nkill six million people.\nYou didn't kill anybody.\nI didn't kill anybody. I didn't kill my mother. I didn't send my family to the crematorium. Hitler\ndid. I can't see why I feel guilty. I feel guilty about all kinds of other things. I think I feel very\nguilty about the fact that what this whole experience left me with is that I may have treated my\nchildren in the way not other people treat their children but with more worrying, more caution, and\ninfinitely more anxiety than normal parents who have not had my experience. I think that in that\nsense I have victimized my children. I think there is no question in my mind that children of\nsurvivors are deeply wounded by the experiences of their parents and they refuse to admit it but this\ntremendous drive to excel, nothing less than Harvard would do for some of them is always making\nup for the pain and deprivation that the parents have experienced. I think our children are in some\nways more sensitive because of the tales that the parents have told them but it's a very complicated\nissue of guilt between the parent and the child. They feel guilty for what happened not out of their\nvolition. It's not their fault, but what happened to their parent was something far more gruesome\nthan happened to any other parent unless in individual cases they have hideous experiences. But on\nthe whole their parents have experienced horrendous gruesomeness in life. Two really great victims\nof this outside of those of us who survived - because those who perished are no longer even victims,\nthey're just nothing anymore, but we are the living victims. I thought the two really mnocent\nvictims are our children and their children - the perpetrators - the Nazis whose children and",
        "grandchildren have to live with this knowledge though they don't know anything usually because\ntheir parents won't tell them. But they suspect it. Maybe my father is a murderer. And which child\nwants to be fathered by a murderer. Afraid to ask, they don't get any answers. Generally, I suppose\nthat's what happens. And I used to say that they're the true victims, those children and ours. And\nthen I've had quite a number of terrible experiences with German children and I stopped saying that\nand I say it's only our children who are the real victims. It's not quite true probably because there\nare probably a lot of sensitive German kids who are suffering tremendously. But I had two or three\nlousy experiences, so I stopped saying it. I just focus in on the fact that our children are terribly\npunished emotionally by being truly the extension of Auschwitz because when we are gone, long\nafter we are gone, when none of us will be left, perhaps decades later, these children will be the\nnearest thing that you can touch that is connected to Auschwitz. It is them they will ask how was it\nto grow up with a mother who was a survivor of Auschwitz. You know I'm talking 50 years from\nnow. I expect that our children should live longer than we live in our age. But you know, 20, 30,\n40 years from now there will be nothing as comnmonly visible as it is today that you can find a\nsurvivor here and there. So they will be the nearest link to the reality of Auschwitz. I don't envy\nthem. As a matter of fact I have noticed in some of these gathering that we have had in Israel, in\nWashington, in Philadelphia, the survivors, that the media was kind of wise to that reality because I\nhave noticed how they go after our children rather than us. It's as if we were already gone and let's\nbetter ask those who will be here with us for a long time, their children. Who knows what it is to be\nthe child of such a person. I want to hop back to some of the antisemitism that I grew up with that\nwas really mother's milk to me.\nBeing a Jewish girl in a Hungarian school in 1933?\nYes. First of all I had to be sort of the best student because I was this terrible minority of one or two\nthere. I think there were two of us in the class who were Jewish. So I had to be the best student. So\nwas my friend. We were both extraordinary students.\nJewish friend.\nThis Jewish friend of mine.\nDid you have any non-Jewish friends in this class?\nNone that I could trust. I might have had some superficial friends. I might have had, but I\nremember this one. Leah, I don't remember - something like that - was her name but her second\nname was Halpert I think and her father was equally...",
        "Not related to you Halpert?\nNo, not at all. But her father was so terribly religious, as mine, and did not want her to go to a\nJewish school which would teach her something about Zionism so she was very bright and she was\na good friend of mine and she was decent and darling and intelligent and the two of us just simply\nhad to be the best students. But you couldn't win because you had to be the best student because\nyou were such a minority and if you were the best student they hated your guts because you were\njust a damn Jew who was smarter than the next guy.\nWas this all girls?\nNo, it was a mixed class.\nBoys and girls.\nYeah. These very same kids that I was in school in the afternoon if I walked out later in the street, I\njust heard them say, \"Dirty Jews, dirty Jews, dirty Jews.\" You can't be a winner which is what I\napply as well to the fact that we cannot win this ugly reality of our life that we are survivors of this\nmadness because vis-a-vis our children. We cannot win because so many of us have shielded them\nfrom Auschwitz. We did not want to tell them anything about it. So there were those parents. And\nthey were losers because the kids came back at them. Why didn't you tell me? I know my niece did\nand so did others. I had told them and my husband was very helpful and tried to impart some of the\ninformation because they were seeking it out. But I must tell you they wanted to know it and they\ndidn't. Early in their lives they were already torn by conflicts because they wanted to know so much\nbut they did not want to know so much. I clearly remember when my children were going to\nschool, this Fieldstone we just mentioned, and we were walking distance from the school. We lived\nin over there. I remember my older one Peter who said one morning, \"Mommy, how did my aunt\ndie?\", referring to Potyo. They heard that maybe she died in an open fire alive they threw her in.\nMommy how did my aunt die, Potyo? And I realized that as he asked me the question he had his\nhand on the knob. He was opening the door to leave for school. So he wants to know but he didn't\nreally want to know and he left without finding out. But this terrible conflict was already imbedded\nin there at such an early age so the end result is that there are no winners 1n imparting the knowledge\nor not. Those of us who did lost in a sense and those of us who didn't lost. There's no way to win\nsomething as big as this, you cannot.\nI would imagine too that you found it difficult to think of Potyo as an aunt, thirteen years old.",
        "Clearly, sure. That's a very good point. As a matter of fact when I was saying aunt I was\nwondering who I was talking about because she was just a child. But indeed she was my children's\naunt. And would have been a lovely wonderful aunt of some fifty odd years.\nNot to mention a beautiful wife and a great mother.\nAnd a mother herself, yeah. There's not even any point to talk about that. But in that same vein as I\nmentioned some further antisemitic winds that I got -\nIn Hungary?\nYeah, I must tell you the story that pained us, or pained me, I don't know if the others know it the\nsame way. But the way I know the story of my two brothers, twins, their names were Shmuel and\nBarry.\nBarry? Could you spell it, please.\nI don't know how you would spell it but it was Beryl and Shmuel. That would be the Yiddish name.\nWould that be Samuel?\nSam would sound right and maybe Bernard. But I don't remember their non-Jewish names though\nthey had them because they had to be registered by their non-Jewish names.\nSo you had three brothers, then?\nI originally had three brothers. I don't remember - 1t seems to me yes, they were born before Potyo.\nThey would come between Rachel and Portyo. They were not identical twins. They were two\ndelicate little boys that I remember in their swaddling clothes. I didn't know about this because\nsomething evidently happened and they shipped us away from home and they sent us to my\ngrandmother in",
        "Nyiregyhaza. When we came back we found that we only had one brother out of the twins left. My\nmother was kind of totally destroyed. And they were telling us that we came home because\nsomething terrible had happened but we're going back to my grandmother and then we're going to\ncome back home again.\nThey sent us back and we didn't come back again because something terrible happened again and\nwhat happened was that the twins had a wet nurse and the wet nurse's child got ill with some kind of\nlung inflammation of some sort - I don't know what it was, maybe TB for all I know - but her milk\nwas infected with whatever this was and her child recovered. She was breast-feeding the three\nchildren. Her child got ill and recovered and our two children got very ill. My parents had a\nphilosophy in life when something is wrong, when somebody is ill, you seek out the best possible\ncare at any cost or any religion or any anti-semitism, no matter what it is you will get the very best\ncare. So you go to the most famous man in the field. The most famous man in the field, evidently,\nwas in this children's hospital which was very famous in the country, in Debrecen which was near\nthe town where my mother was born. My mother and father immediately took the children to this\nhospital. One died and my mother came home, I think, to sit shiva. You know what that 1s, I think.\nAfter the dead, you have to sit for a week on the floor, and that sort of thing. It was the time before\nthe child died that they shipped us off to my grandparents. She evidently left the other child there ill\nin Debrecen. And I guess left the other child there and a week later or so the other child died as\nwell. And somebody, I don't remember who, told us that when the other child died my mother left\nthe hospital and charged out to the street absolutely crazed. She was screaming. She was totally\ncrazed by it. And then she came home and finally we heard the story of what happened and she was\nabsolutely convinced or she had facts, I don't know, because conceivably she had friends. My\nmother was a very social person to whom people talked. She had real friends. In any field, people\nshe touched trusted her and confided in her and everything. So I suppose she must have heard this\nfrom other doctors, young doctors, perhaps Jewish doctors, colleagues of - there were a lot of people\ninvolved evidently in the two cases of death of these children. And my mother was absolutely\ncertain that the children were victims of antisemitism; that they had experimented on them and\ntreated them as Jewish children, not necessarily to be saved, but to learn from. And that they were\nsacrificial lambs. She never recanted on that. She maintained forever that the children were victims\nof anti-semitism.\nBack in those years, which goes way back, I don't remember when those children were born, but\nthis was before Hitler. But curiously the place, the hospital, was known for a sense of anti-\nsemitism. So it wasn't her imagination. She either had proof of it because they were twins that they\nwere a subject for experimentation.\nHow old were they?\nThey were eight months old when they died, within two, three weeks of each other. Of course my\nparents could never be consoled and that's how Philip remained the only son after that. My mother's\ninstincts were to be trusted on the whole in all of the big issues.",
        "One for instance which stands out in my mind always - I sort of cannot live it down. In a sense it\ndoes add to my pessimism which my family will testify that despite the fact that I show strength and\nhave survived and all that - I am a afflicted with a sense of pessimism. And G-d knows at this stage,\nI have enough to be pessimistic about, all of us, because the world is taking from bad turn - always\nseems to be making worse turns than last time and G-d knows what will become of the world now.\nAntisemitism rising everywhere in the world. So there is enough cause not only to be skeptical but\nto feel deeply sad about the state of the world and particularly in regard to anti-semitism and I\nalways thought I should be involved in the activity of leaving something behind for future\ngenerations about this whole event of the holocaust because I was there, I'm a first hand person, I\nhave a certain responsibility to leave the truth behind. I have done it very much at my own expense\nand undoubtedly at the expense of my children and my husband. I paid very dearly. They pay very\ndearly for what I have done in order to leave enough of the truth behind so that when the revisionists\nmake even bigger noises than they have made all throughout these years after my survival, our\ntestimonies will be there so that we can counteract their evil pronouncements regarding the\nholocaust. The holocaust never happened.",
        "Do you believe in G-d, Isabella?",
        "No. I have had tremendous trouble with the question of G-d because I never saw him when I\nneeded him and I really have questions only. I have absolutely no answers to any of them. How\ncan I have any answer to them when I remember standing in Auschwitz on a summer day when\nevidently planes were flying overhead - probably those were the planes that were going to takes\npictures of the Krupp [Buna] installments. Those are the pictures they have of Auschwitz itself.\nThe allies have had those pictures and they didn't bomb Auschwitz, as we know now. They didn't\nbomb the rails. It must have been those planes that flew overhead that we saw way up there.\nWhichever planes they were, I remember standing in Auschwitz in Lager C on a very hot summer\nafternoon in 1944 and as the planes flew overhead raising my hands in prayer saying G-d, please let\nthem kill us with their bombs. I'd rather die by the bombs of the west or the fighting forces or\nwhatever I might have said - I don't remember - but I'd rather die by the bombs than let Hitler have\nthe joy of killing me in the crematorium. I don't want him to have the last word. I really wanted to\ndie. There was no way out. Certainly there was no way to imagine that I'm ever going to survive\nthat. Since I have no other fate except dying, why shouldn't I die by the bombs. And the planes\nflew over us and never bombed us. It was only this much that I asked of that almighty G-d in those\ncircumstances and I wasn't granted this much. I cannot give you an answer on the question of G-d\nbecause I will as long as I live ask where he was hiding when they burned 24,000 people a day in\nAuschwitz and we, the few survivors, had to live with the stench of 24,000 people burning a day.\nEven G-d has to forgive me for asking this question. Where is an answer? Give me an answer to\nthat question. Where was G-d when the smoke was so thick, so gray, so dark. There was no sky.\nThere was nothing blue to be seen on some days. Nothing but smoke around the clock. My\nchildren throughout the years have been very conscious of thick smoke. I remember riding along in",
        "the car with my question via New Jersey and there would be a big fire in these - I don't know where\nthey keep these gasoline tanks or something...\nThe oil refineries.\nYeah, all kinds of fires and as soon as the thick smoke appeared, my children looked frightened, and\nlooking at me and looking at the smoke and trying to find out what's going on inside me because I\nsee the smoke that I used to speak of and my children were frightened for their mother to see smoke\nbecause it reminded her of the burning mother.\nIf it could remind them, it certainly reminded you.\nYou can imagine. So is that a way for children to grow up? And then I can ask, \"Where is G-d?\nWhy doesn't he protect my children from having these terrible feelings?\"\nAnd you were brought up as a religious girl.\nAnd I was brought up in a very religious home and I cannot answer your questions nor anybody's. I\ndon't know what to do.\nA religious girl who was forced to attend the public school because of her father's religion.\nAnd coming from a long line of rabbinical background. I am sure that in my mother's side, I have\nnothing but rabbis as great great great great great grandfathers. I\"m sure that that's the whole\nlineage - 1s rabbinical. But I welcome any of my ancestors to send me a supernatural message if\nyou will about the question of G-d and Auschwitz. Under normal circumstances I perhaps would\nnot have had to question.\nWho helped you survive, if anyone?\nMy sister. My good sister. I go back to Chicha but I must tell you about my pessimism I started out\nwith. My mother was so accurate in her pessimistic outlook vis-a-vis Jewish survival.",
        "She was also optimistic, remember?\nYes, because she hoped that her children would live and she expected them to live. But my mother,\nthroughout the war years while Hitler was making his big noises and big moves and was dancing all\nover our graves all over Europe, even before the war broke out in the 30s when I was old enough to\nremember, my mother used to say (all the time I heard this) Hitler will lose the war (there was no\nwar yet) - Hitler will lose the war but he will win it against the Jews. Nobody put it more\naccurately, more astutely\nthan she and she fed our young minds with this absolute truth. She proved to be absolutely right.\nAnd she had this submission that could not be placated by any kind of foolish talk about what Hitler\nwill turn out to be.\nIs this when you decided to seek visas to leave Hungary?\nNo, my father had come to America on a business trip in 1936 in connection with the World's Fair.\n1936?\nI think it was '36.\n'39 I know there was a World's Fair in New York.\nYeah, but he must have come earlier to make arrangements for a Hungarian wine pavilion. He was\na wine and liquor wholesale merchant. He came to America to make arrangements for a pavilion\nand one of the Hungarian ministers (I understand from my brother and he can give you the accurate\nname) made a comment after they issued the necessary papers to him. He was quoted as saying,\n\"It's a dirty shame that a G-d-damn Jew should represent us on the World's Fair.\" Antisemitism was\nin the highest places and lowest places and everywhere.\nYour father heard this?\nWell the quote was handed down to us enough so that my brother remembers it very accurately. He\nremembers the name of the Hungarian official, some very high official. In any event, my father\ncame early before the World's Fair to make arrangements for a Hungarian pavilion and he returned",
        "within ten days to Hungary. He came on a visitor's visa and he returned. In those days, anyone who\ncame to America would never dream of returning. They came as visitors, whichever way they\ncame, they stayed here. That's all they wanted was to escape those poverty-ridden lands of Poland,\nand Hungary and all of them. My father was the only one who returned. And because he returned\nwithin ten days and he came back because it was Passover and he had to be home for the seder. The\nAmerican consul trusted him so much because he was a weird person to return from America that\nwhen he came to ask for another visa they just issued it to him with no questions asked. He was\nvery trustworthy. So he finally went back to get a visa because my mother urged him to save his\nfamily and go to America. My mother saw this very early.\nWas this after the outbreak of the war?\nNo, before the outbreak of the war. Hitler was already too powerful and my mother was too\nfrightened. He got the visa and he had the visa in his breast pocket. People were offering him all\nkind of monies to buy the visa off him and somehow convert it to their own names or picture or\nwhatever it was. My father of course wouldn't give up the visa but at the same time he refused to\ncome back to America because he kept saying that America is not the kind of place - you don't want\nto bring up Jewish children there - they have people from all over the world - there is not enough\nYiddishkeit, Jewishness and religiosity. I think now there seems to be a lot more of surges of\nJewishness and religiosity. These kids going around with their skull caps and everything. There's a\nlot going on that's very Jewish consciousness. I welcome that. But he was afraid that if he brings\nhis family here his children would not be Jewish enough. They will absorb too much of\nAmericanism rather than Judaism. He was reluctant to come back. My mother constantly urged\nhim - you must save our children. You must go back. Finally he agreed to come to save his family.\nHe came back and arrived with probably the last boat that brought him here. The war had already\nbroken out. Courtesy of the great Franklin Delano Roosevelt who was such a great president. He\ndidn't have a Jewish soul. He didn't want to save the Jews. He wanted to win the war. The Jews\nwere not uppermost in his mind and we know now he refused to bomb the Auschwitz rails and he\ndid too much that was terribly, terribly wrong. One of those things was that when a Jew such as my\nfather from Hungary who was already in this country and applying for his papers to remain here to\neventually become a citizen, and asked for papers to bring over his family of seven so at least they\ncould save those seven people from Hitler's murder. He, I understand, spent all his waking hours\nknocking on the doors in Washington at the various authorities - give me the papers - give me the\npapers - save my children. And they managed to postpone it long enough so that by the time they\nwould give him the papers, Hungary had declared war against the United States. Witness the\nbeginning of the statement I said that on December 7...\nYes, I recall. So two years to get papers?",
        "They dilly-dallied. They would have had to give him the papers immediately. Let's save one\nJewish family. There is some legitimacy here because the father came here for that purpose and\nsome of us were underage and could have come under his auspices. They managed to sabotage this\nJewish family and they managed to sabotage all of the efforts to save Jews. This is not my story but\nit is well documented in G-d knows how many books. So Hungary declared war against the United\nStates and there was no American consulate because we were allies of Hitler. So were the Japanese.\nThe whole thing was aborted. So then my father evidently spent another year and a half or two\nyears - 41 until 44, I guess - to try to get papers to come to Israel since the American plan didn't\nwork. So he was knocking on the doors - get me papers to go to Palestine.\nBritish-controlled Palestine.\nYeah. And he was desperate. Day and night he worked to get them papers to go to Palestine\nbecause America was out of the question. And he finally succeeded again with so much\npostponement from these gentle souls who were not interested in saving at least one Jewish family.\nBy the time we got the papers, Hitler had occupied Hungary and I remember the papers had arrived\nand there they were - seven documents to get this family to Israel and Naziism was already in full\nforce in Hungary. I always say I don't know what we used it for, toilet paper or what, but it was\nworthless. And instead of\ngoing to America or to Palestine ......\nHow did you finally escape?\nI never mentioned to you that Philip, my brother, was torn away from us immediately in Auschwitz\nbut his last plea to us - actually it was a very dramatic and very unusual act of defiance on his part -\nthat when men and women were separated and we made it to the life side and we were led into this\nhuge wet monstrous place where they shaved us and threw a rag at us in Lager C - no it probably\nwasn't Lager C - and we saw two other monsters - this was Chicha and I - and we saw two other\nshaved monsters in rags who we barely recognized, but they looked familiar and these are our two\nsisters whom Mengele was originally leading to the crematorium and then he changed his mind and\ntook them out to the life side. As we were shaved and looking absolutely hideous some kind of a\nmagic force appeared--my brother Philip who by now was wearing a striped uniform. He was\nshaved and evidently his group was ready to be led to the camp where they were going to lead them\n- whether it was A or B or wherever they led the men. Evidently he kept looking for his sisters and\nhe knew already that his mother was no longer alive. There was somebody who shaved him and he\nwas evidently a prisoner in Auschwitz who was one of the people who shaved him and it was\nsomebody he knew. He could tell you more about this. And he said to him that your mother 1s\nalready dead, or something about the smoke that there is your mother. My brother evidently passed\ndown the word to the others, to the next guy and the next guy. Tell them to say kaddish. We no",
        "longer have parents. He was evidently looking for whatever was left of his family hoping that the\ngirls, because they are young and healthy, that they are on the life side and he kept peering through\nthis window and this incredibly brave human being, despite the Nazis all around, managed to climb\nthrough that window because he saw us and he flew into the window. How he did that I don't think\nhe knows. And he put his arm around these four naked-headed monsters, his sisters. And he shook\nus and he said, \"Listen to me! Eat! Eat everything they give you. If they give you shit, eat shit, but\nyou must survive. We must live. We must pay them back and create a better world.\" And he flew\nout. He was back through the window and he was gone. We never saw him again until we were in\nAmerica. But he managed to - talking about resistance, what this man did, we never ever forgot - I\ndon't know if he remembers the words he said to us. I clearly remember them as these words. How\nthe others remember them, I don't know. These are the words I remember and whenever it looked\nlike we were finished, there is no more life left in us, somehow this vision came up of Philip saying\nyou must eat no matter what they give you because we must survive. And then for three weeks he\nwas evidently in Auschwitz. He was the most ingenious public relations man or communication\nman probably in the world because he found pieces of wood in his camp because they were still\nbuilding the camp and there were pieces of wood. He somehow managed to barter his bread\nprobably to a prisoner who had been there longer and probably had a little chunk of a pencil. He\ncarved every day on a piece of wood - you must live, you must live, you must survive. And he\nwould say on that, my sisters are in Lager C. Their name is Katz. Whoever finds this piece of\nwood please toss it over the next camp, Lager they called it, until it reaches Lager C. And these\nband of resisters, these prisoners, managed to throw it over the wire, Lager to Lager, until 1t reached\nLager C. And we got the message every single day for about three weeks.",
        "Who would catch it?",
        "Somebody would find it in the same spot the same way and we would go there looking for it\nbecause by now we were trained. It was a secret language of the most powerful underground\ncommunication in the world and we found the piece of wood or somebody brought it to us because\nby this time they knew us so there were some people who knew us. They brought us this life\nmessage and then one day it stopped and then we were certain that he is up in smoke or Mengele\ntook him to another camp. We never heard from him again until we arrived in America. An\nAmerican soldier found him in a hospital and wrote to my father because the only thing - we didn't\nhave any belongings - the only thing we were all schooled in at home, by my mother, I guess, or by\neach other, that if we ever lived through this war, we should remember one thing - my father's\naddress, 166 Ross Street, Brooklyn, where my aunt lived, and my father lived with his sister. And\nthat's what we remembered, this address. That was the only document we had, that was the only\npaper, which was not a paper. It was in our head, engraved, 166 Ross Street. He gave this address\nto the American soldier who liberated him. He found him in a hospital with a bullet in his leg. He\nwas In six concentration camps while we were in two. He tried to escape, after he tried to make a\ndeal with the Nazi who he caught changing his clothes, I believe, because he wanted to escape when\nthe Americans were so near that they were overhead and they were in the cattle cars shipping them",
        "further into Nazidom. But this is something he would have to tell you. But in any event he shot\nhim in the leg. He didn't want to kill him, it looks like, but he shot him in the leg and this American\nsoldier found him in the hospital. We didn't know anything about him, this whole saga of six\nconcentration camps and the bullet until he arrived in January 1945. I will return to how we\nsurvived. When Auschwitz was beginning to be liquidated in the fall of 1944, we spent all our\nenergies - whatever was left in our 40 to 50 pound human being that we each weighed, 40, 50, 60\npounds, and I had typhus throughout the nine months that I was in the camps, whatever energy we\nhad we spent it on only one thing - to run away from Mengele's selections, because if Mengele will\nselect the four of us, one would go to another camp, one would go to the crematorium, one would\ngo yet to another camp, one would stay here. We cannot afford a selection if we still want to be\nfour sisters. We were a rather large family. There was another family who had six sisters. We\nwere probably the next largest because they were decimated. Families were totally decimated.\nBecause we were close in age, young and healthy, he picked us out. So the four of us made it all the\nway through six months of Auschwitz in the worst times of Auschwitz and escaped Mengele's\nselection even if we had to run, as we did one night, and he shot after us, but he didn't get us in the\ndark. So we remained alive. We tried anything and everything to remain together. We made it sort\nof to the entrance to the crematorium\nwhere they were going to take us out of Lager C in November on a bitter cold night and put us in\nthe crematorium and then as it happened so many times we were unable to figure out what they\nwere going to do and they changed the orders once more. Instead of putting us in the crematorium,\nthey put us on trains, on ice-cold trains, with heated cars for the Nazis and ours were ice-cold. They\ntook us to another concentration camp called Birnbaumel, or that's the way I remember the name, in\nEastern Germany. We traveled, I don't know how long, frozen to death and starved. We arrived in\na place called Birnbaumel where they had a thousand prisoners in a forest in umbrella-like paper-\nthin wood structures with no floor. It was only ice. The walls were ice and the floor was ice. It was\neastern Germany 1n a forest.\nWhat were you wearing?\nRags. Chicha was wearing a wooden shoe and one regular shoe. The only thing they let us keep\nwere eyeglasses and shoes and the shoes wore out and somehow all kinds of wooden clogs\nappeared. My sister had one wooden shoe and one regular shoe.\nCoats, blankets?\nRags and whatever we could somehow manage to - maybe they gave us something or we bartered\nsomething. We had a little more clothing than we had in Auschwitz but certainly not enough to\nkeep you warm in the forest. Every morning we had to go to the other end of the forest through the\ntown where all the Germans saw us. They said they never saw us. They were going to work and to",
        "school. Twice a day they saw us coming and going. They had to stop traffic for a thousand of\nwretched skeletons to walk through the town to reach the other end of the forest to do Schatzarbeit\n|Schutzarbeit| digging ditches for the tank traps. In the frozen earth, if we wanted to start digging,\nwe had to heat up the earth first because the earth was frozen. The Germans stood there with their\nincredible coats and uniforms and rifles and they would warm their fat rumps at the fire and they\nwould chase us away with the butt of their rifles because heat the earth, not the Jews, you know.\nThis went on all winter from November to January and we got thinner and frailer and sicker and my\ntyphus was raging. How I didn't die, I never know. I had typhus for nine months. The doctor said\nunder the best of care at home I would have died in days. Finally after digging the bloody German\nearth and watching how the Nazis were so gentle with their murderous dogs and what they did to us.\nFinally the end came. We were in Birnbaumel in these icy huts and on a Sunday afternoon on\nJanuary 21, they gathered us in a tremendous hurry. The word was always los, los, schnell, schnell,\nfast, fast, whatever the hell it meant. We had to line up in funferreih always five in a row. They\ncounted us and within minutes they marched us out of the camp. Had we hidden then, which we\ndidn't know, had we hidden anywhere, they had no time to come looking for us and the people who\nwere in the so called hospital which was called the Revier with their legs frozen off and they had\ngangrene and they couldn't take them out and they didn't want to shoot them because they didn't\nwant to leave the evidence behind - dead bodies. Those people were the ones who survived because\nif we had hidden anywhere we would have been liberated that very afternoon because the Russians\nwere that close but we didn't know anything about that. We only knew that we had to go very fast -\nrun, line up, and march out of the camp. We were out on the road on Sunday afternoon, bitter, bitter\ncold, snow and ice all over and we had to march fast and fast and faster. We were led out of the\ncamp and we were marching towards the west where Hitler was ostensibly ruling. We didn't know\nwhere we were going. We marched until the evening. In the evening they had put us up in another\nevacuated camp where a thousand girls had been taken out of. We spent the night there and that\nwas Sunday night and Monday we marched another day in these hideous conditions. Rachel was\ncoughing. It sounded like she had TB. It was terrible. But the four of us were still together.\nTuesday morning we tried to fight back again. One night we were housed in an evacuated\nconcentration camp and the second night they put us up in several barns. The cows were in one\nbarn and the straw and their bedding, I guess, was in another barn and we gathered enough strength,\ninner and physical strength, to try to make it once more and we hid ourselves in the straw, on the top\nlevel. We thought if they come with their pitchforks to drive us out of our hiding place well then\nthat's the way we'll die but let's try it anyhow. We successfully hid ourselves. Several other people\nhad done the same thing. They had no time to pitchfork us out of the hiding places. They knew that\nsome of us must have been hiding in these straw refuges. Cunningly, as always, they began to boil\npotatoes. It's not that they wanted to feed us but the smell would lure us out from the hiding place\nand that's exactly what it did. The four of us who struggled so hard to remain four together gave up\nour hiding place because the smell of potato was irresistible. To eat once more was more important\nthan perhaps freedom and we voluntarily gave up our hiding place and lined up for the potatoes, the\nfour of us together with the others. By the time we reached the kettle in which they were boiling the\npotatoes, there were none. They were all gone. But by now we were prisoners again.",
        "How did you get away now?",
        "This was Tuesday morning. Sunday we slept in the camp and Monday we slept in the barn and\nTuesday morning on the 23rd, we were prisoners again, and we lined up and we marched again. By\nthis time a great many girls had died and anyone who couldn't march was shot right there. It was\nTuesday morning, I don't know what hour it was, late morning probably, they were marching us.\nWe were in this town called Jagadschutz and there were three sisters in the back of us who escaped\nso the guards who were in the back guarding us in this marching line and the guards on the two\nsides went all back to shoot two girls, as we later found out, and the third one had to dig a grave for\nthe two sisters. Only the guard in the front remained. My sister Chicha, who was the heroine\nalways, was at the end of the line as we entered this little village called Jagadschutz. There was a\nlittle house of a blacksmith and she had enough presence to figure out that if no smoke is coming\nout of the chimney - they didn't have any sophisticated fire, heating arrangements - if no smoke is\ncoming out then they must be gone. They must have escaped from the oncoming liberators,\nwhoever they were - Americans or Russians or who knows what; we didn't know anything about the\nstatus of the war. But they have escaped evidently and she bolted and ran out. She had made\nanother attempt to escape but by this time we agreed that ostensibly we're not going to be aiding\neach other in the same way as we always did. There was no question that we were always going to\ndo the same thing. This time we said somebody has to survive. Whoever can, let's make it. So she\nbolted and she ran into the little house and she ran up to the stairs. Nobody was in there. It was ice\ncold. She went up to the attic. Rachel was marching right next to her and she ran. Nobody looked\nback. Nobody said anything. I saw Rachel and I ran and I was certain that Cipi standing next to me\nwould do exactly the same thing. Rachel and I ran into a little doghouse. The dog was gone. They\ntook the dog away. We hid in the doghouse crouched. Suddenly in this deadly silence and snow\nand it was a snowstorm but it was beautiful, white, it was Christmas time like Christmas time, peace\non earth, good will towards men. We were crouching in the doghouse and then we heard these steps\nin the silence, this absolute silence and snow. It was the oberschutzfuhrer, the Nazi with his dog.\nHe was walking on the road cursing the Jews mumbling things at who escaped behind holding him\nback from marching ahead away from the liberators and taking his precious cargo along. Whether\nthe wind blew our scent away, I don't know, but the dog evidently did not smell us and he passed us\nby. Evidently Chicha was watching this from the window in the attic and she yelled out all our\nnames and said Cipi, Rachel, Isabella are you all here. And we said yes, well we're here, Rachel\nand Isabella but Cipi is probably in the next house because she had to do exactly what we did. Once\nthe obershutzfuhrer was gone my sister yelled down, \"Come on up here to the attic. Here I am and I\nfound a frozen cabbage and it's delicious. We ran up and a few minutes later the door was slightly\nopened and there were three other wretched creatures who escaped and they made their way into the\nsame house. But it wasn't Cipi. This was the 23rd of January. We stayed in this house and had\nanother anti-semitic experience when a forced labor worker from Poland, they were working around\nin Germany, they were forced laborers. He came and he wanted to chase us out because he wanted\nto take the contents of the house. He threatened us that the Germans are all around and they are\ngoing to kill us and we'd better leave. I think Chicha told him if this is what you want in the house\nyou can take everything but let us stay here and eat some before we die. Leave us alone. He finally",
        "left. We stayed there Tuesday and Wednesday. Wednesday night the lights were cut. Chicha was\nsmart enough to say the Germans must have left. They cut the electricity. Sure enough it was true.\nIt was Thursday morning. We were in our warm bedding, barefooted and suddenly we saw a\ntremendous army entering the village, blood splattered soldiers, fighting soldiers, spent completely,\nand all kinds of war machinery, and we didn't know who they were. They didn't look like the\nHungarian soldiers we knew and they didn't look like the German soldiers. Who were they?\nSuddenly we saw the sickle and the hammer and the red flag. We knew that was Russian. We ran\nout barefooted in the snow and we started to scream. We are liberated, liberated. It was an insane\nsound. You probably heard it on 42nd street. Then we started to cry like nobody ever cried. We\nare liberated, we are liberated. But where are they all? They are all dead.",
        "And Cipi?",
        "And there was no Cipi. Now that we were liberated we went looking for Cipi. We spent six weeks\nthere on the road waiting for all the survivors who survived pass through our town going towards\nthe train and all we looked for was finding Cipi. We never found her. All those bastards who say\ntoday forget it, it happened long ago, I have only this to tell them. To me it happened yesterday\nbecause it took me thirty some years before somebody related the story to me of what happened to\nCipi. I looked for her for all those years. If I saw a familiar walk I followed that for blocks. I went\nto buy some bread in a bakery and I thought maybe this old lady is my sister who disappeared thirty\nsome years ago. And even today when I know that absolutely certain that she's dead, if I see a head\nthat looks familiar, I run. I never had any peace from that but I know from this eye-witness, one of\nthe girls who was with us, her name was Eva [Philip] [ph][385] who told me that 30 some years\nlater when I told her now you can tell me. I met her a couple of years before and she started to tell\nme what happened and I broke down crying so terribly that she stopped the story right there. But I\ntold her now I am sitting in my kitchen and I'm very comfortable. You won't see me cry. You're\ntalking on the telephone. Please tell me what happened. And then she told me that Cipi followed\nme some minutes later and they caught her and they beat her so brutally that she thinks she went\ncrazy. She wanted to die. Three more weeks they marched in the most wretched conditions and\nthey refused to kill her. She begged them kill me, kill me. They knew that her sisters were gone.\nShe said she doesn't want to live, please kill me. They refused to kill her because they knew that she\nsuffers more alive because her sisters are gone. She lost them to freedom. Over and over she\nbegged them to kill her and they refused to kill her. There were no more barbed wires so she had no\nway to kill herself. Another indication that you could not die when you wanted to. You could only\ndie when they wanted you to die and only die their way, not your way. They dragged her to\nBergen-Belsen for three weeks in that condition. Somebody saw her there. All she could say was\nmy sisters, thank G-d they're in America probably. They're free. At least they live, at least they're\nfree. She was lovingly talking about us to this person who later on was liberated, came to America,\nand she couldn't cope with memories of Auschwitz and hanged herself. But she left us with Cipi's\nwords. Then she was liberated. My sister Cipi was liberated. And then she died. And in those\nheaps of Bergen-Belsen, those mounds, those miles of bodies that they were churning up with",
        "machinery, one of them was my sister. And it was that same Bergen-Belsen that that damn Reagan\nwent to Bitburg and I don't wish him a good day because he did that. He went to Bitburg to honor\nthe SS forty-some graves and it was my sister Chicha who went, not along with him, to Bergen-\nBelsen on the same trip to protest him because it was that Bergen-Belsen that he was at that they\nwouldn't let my sister in, I think. He went to Bergen-Belsen also. He went to Bitburg and ed-\nBelsen. My poor sister went to protest Reagan's attention to Bitburg. Coming to the same ed-\nBelsen where my sister perished and I will always be angry about it, always, always hate him for\ndoing that, for going to Bitburg.\nYou wrote a poem about your youngest sister, did you not?\nYes I did.\nWould you please read it for us?\nBy the way I want you to know that we were the very first survivors of Auschwitz to reach this land.\nWe were put aboard a merchant marine ship called the Brand Whitlock in Odessa. Finally we made\nour way to Odessa by April, from January to April. We were put aboard this ship and we were\nthrough half the world for nearly five weeks and arrived by some mysterious coincidence on the\nvery day the war ended. We arrived on May 8, 1945. That made us the first survivors of\nAuschwitz. You want to hear the poem that I wrote about my sister: Ring around a rosy, six\nmillion is only a number, but each somebody's mother, somebody's child, somebody's lover,\nsomebody's bride. Potyo was just thirteen; she was my sister. She had the wisdom of a child of\nwar. She was full of fear yet tiptoed with tenderness, laughter and love in a world of madmen. She\nwas a weeping willow, a song of sorrow, a poem of infinite beauty. Why does Hitler hate me?\nWhy does he love hate? Mama, I am only thirteen. I have songs yet to learn, games yet to play.\nGive me time to live. Give me time to die. Mama, how can I do all the living in just an inch of\ntime? On a wretched piece of earth, alien land of terror and chaos, on another planet called\nAuschwitz, Mengele points at Potyo - Ring around a rosies, pocket full of posies, ashes, ashes. --\nThat it was.\nThank you, Isabella Leitner.",
