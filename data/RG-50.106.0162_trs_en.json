        "Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Frank Liebermann, conducted by Gail Schwartz, on\nSeptember 24\", 2003 in Bethesda, Maryland. This interview is part of the\nmuseum\u2019s project to interview Holocaust survivors and witnesses who are also\nvolunteers with the museum. This is tape number one, side A. What is your full\nname?",
        "Answer: Frank Nathan Liebermann.",
        "Q: And what was your name at birth?",
        "A: Franz Natan Liebermann.",
        "Q: And where and when were you born?",
        "A: January 19\", 1929, in Gleiwitz, on the main street, Wilhelmstrasse Funf.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s first talk a little bit about your family, about your parents. L -- can you\ntell me their names first?",
        "A: My father was Dr. Hans Liebermann, an ear, nose, throat specialist who\npracticed medicine in Gleiwitz, and we had an office attached to our apartment on\nthe main street.",
        "Q: And -- and your mother\u2019s name?",
        "A: Yeah. My mother was born Lotta Flora Olgala in Opin and married my fa --\nSeptember 24, 2003\nwas introduced to my father at a -- a fraternity dance when she was only 16 and\nthey were married four years later in 1928, February 28.",
        "Q: How far back can you trace your family 1-in that part of Germany\u201d",
        "A: Back to about 1650. The family Olgala and Bloch were in Lanendorf,\napparently having emigrated from Alsace-Lorraine during various pogroms there\nand settled in Opin. In fact, one of -- one of our foremothers married Michael\nGratz, who eventually -- whose -- I think granddaughter became Rebecca Gratz\nin Philadelphia. And my grandfather was very proud. He made a family tree,\nwhich we have, which showed the family and that branch.",
        "Q: What kind of a neighborhood did you live in, and was it a mixed neighborhood\nof Jews and non-Jews?",
        "A: Well, Gleiwitz was a town of little bit over a hundred thousand people, with\nprobably about a thousand Jews, primarily merchants, professional, and of course\nalso others. We lived, and as I said my father had his office on the main street with\na connected apartment. I considered myself very middle class, in the respect that a\n-- my mother had for the time a nursemaid for me who stayed almost until we left,\nand was active in the community. They had bil -- were quite active before 1935\nalso, in the general community, but that changed drastically with the coming of the\nNazis, to be limited really, to Jewish activities.\n ;September 24, 2003",
        "Q: How religious was your family?",
        "A: My father came from an Orthodox home, my mother came from a barely\nreligious home. My grandfather was kosher, my parents did not keep a kosher\nhome, except when my grandfather moved in after my grandmother died. He\nmoved to Gleiwitz from my father\u2019s birthplace, which was in Boyton, about 20\nmiles away from Gleiwitz. At that time we went to -- we had a kosher home and\nmy grandfather, even though he had a separate apartment, usually came to us for\nmeals, really until we left.",
        "Q: Did you celebrate any holidays?",
        "A: Yes. I mean, we celebrated all holidays. I also remember -- rather my father\nwas fairly observant in that I n -- I remember him taking me to the service for the\nfirst born, I think at six o\u2019clock in the morning, I guess when I was about seven or\neight years old. I only have one memory of doing it, but that stays in my memory\nbank.",
        "Q: Any other holidays that you can talk about, that you have memories of as a\nyoung child?",
        "A: Well, we always -- oh, by the way, our -- oh, we lived about one block from the\nTemple -- rather, the synagogue. I particularly always remembered -- sh -- oh --",
        "Q: Are you thinking of a holiday, or --\n ,September 24, 2003",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Pa-Passover?",
        "A: In -- no --",
        "Q: Rosh Hashanah?",
        "A: The [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Su --",
        "A: Where the old age home, which was right next to the Temple, always had a\nSukkor and a had sweets for the kids, and that was of particular interest. We al-\nalso always had, obviously Passover, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur. I remember\nthe Temple. The women sat in a balcony, but 1t wasn\u2019t closed. There was no\ncurtain. It also had music in terms of the boy\u2019s choir, conducted -- and I still\nremember him, by Lira Fleischer, who is also the head of the Jewish school,\nbecause the public school became closed in 1933, before I started, and the Jewish\ncommunity had four classrooms within the school, where the instruction took\nplace. The main negative I remember, and this was after 1936, was we had to\nleave the school grounds -- or not the school grounds, but the classrooms during\nlunch period. And we more or less had to draw a fine line of being in the\nschoolyard, between the boys and the girls which were separated, because there\nwere fights and so forth and it became more and more dangerous to be in the\n5September 24, 2003\nschoolyard. Toward 1937 - \u201938, we were dismissed five minutes earlier so that we\ncould be away from the grounds by the time school was open, so that we could get\nhome safely.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk a little bit about that. How did you feel about that? Is it something\nthat you would confide in your parents? Did you have any fears about this kind of\nsituation? You were very young, of course, but what can you remember about that\ndifferent treatment that you as a Jewish child got?",
        "A: I just realized I had to be careful. I was given quite a bit of independence. I was\nable to ride my bicycle wherever it was in town. In fact, when the public\nswimming pools were closed in 1936, at that time I was seven, there was an old\nrock quarry which had water in it, kind of a small lake, which became the Jewish\npool probably about three, four miles out of the city. And friends of mine and I\nused to regularly bicycle out there and as long as we weren\u2019t in groups, we didn\u2019t\nfeel particularly vulnerable.",
        "Q: What about the teachers in your school? Wa-a-a -- were any of them Jewish?",
        "A: They were all Jewish. In other words, we had no contact with the regular\nschool teachers. I remember my first gir -- first -- I went through first, second and\nthird grades, and it was strictly -- it was a German curriculum, but we had our own\nschool within the school. Upper Silesia had been protected by a treaty covering\n6September 24, 2003\nminorities when parts of the area were given to Poland, and therefore, during the\ntransition minorities were protected, the German minorities were protected in\nPoland and any other minorities were also protected in Germany. So that the\neffects of the Nazi government really started in 1936 when Der Stiirmer was at\nevery street corner. Der Sttiirmer was the anti-Semitic paper published by\nGoebbels and they had them behind glass for the public to read, virtually\neverywhere. I also recall that in beginning of 1936, my parents insisted that I\nimmediately take swimming lessons and be able to pass a swimming test of 20\nminutes, because it may be necessary to take an ocean voyage. When I was afraid\nof the test at the time, I remember my grandfather went with me and said, I\u2019m not\nleaving until you do it, because the pool 1s going to be closed very soon and I want\nyou to be a competent swimmer. And that was bef -- before the summer of \u00b036.\nDuring the time when the treaty was over, everybody was afraid of riots and there\nwere some broken windows and similar things. My parents had the foresight to\ntake a vacation in Bornholm, which is an island in the n -- nor -- the Baltic Sea,\nwhi -- during these times, and when we returned the atmosphere changed pretty\nsubstantially. In other words, the so-called treaty expired and the community\ncaught up with the rest of the country in a few weeks.\n7September 24, 2003",
        "Q: Were you a very fearful child at this time? Were -- how aware were you of the\ngrowing threat?",
        "A: I was pretty aware. I was never particularly fearful. I think I have very good\nnerves and that goes back to those days, I just learned to kind of mind my own\nbusiness and do whatever I wanted to. I had no real limitations except what I\nmentioned for school. In 1937, after my mother had taken a trip to Israel in --\nactually, I think late \u00b035, and determined that a doctor had no chance of making a\nliving in Israel, my parents decided I\u2019d better take English lessons and I remember\nI had an English teacher and I did this probably about once or twice a week.",
        "Q: This was a private English teacher that came to the house?",
        "A: It was not a -- it was not taught in school.",
        "Q: What language did you speak at home?",
        "A: German. Upper Silesia was strictly a German area. We did not -- people here\nwere surprised that we did not speak any Yiddish, because Yiddish 1s really\nmedieval German which combined with the local dialects. And since the language\nof our area was German, there was no -- it didn\u2019t stay stagnant and didn\u2019t get\nmixed with any other language, so that it wasn\u2019t used.",
        "Q: Did you feel very German?\n8September 24, 2003",
        "A: Yes. In other words, the philosophy of my parents was that they were Germans,\nbut happened to be Jewish. Like we\u2019re Americans, but religiously we\u2019re Jewish.",
        "Q: Did you feel very Jewish?",
        "A: Not particularly. In other words, except that I did go to a Jewish school and\nafter 1936, we couldn\u2019t go to movies or other children\u2019s activities, and it -- were\nrestricted to certain areas. I remember among the safer playgrounds was an\norganization which was the non-zia -- the co-community was pretty much divided\nbetween Zionists and non-Zionists. The non-Zionits-nists being called the Schild,\nor Shield Organization. And there was an old -- there was a mansion pretty close\nto the middle of town, which served as our playground, and that was a nice place\nto meet and of course, at that point we only played with Jewish kids. My parents\nalso shared what was called a Schrebergarten, which is a piece of land set aside a\nlittle bit at the ed -- kind of at the edge of town, into garden plots, where we had\nfruit trees and [indecipherable]. It was shared by about 10 families. And that was\na place where we could safely congregate and that was actually a private parcel,\nwhich was our other playground in summer. In winter the Schild building was a\nplace where we could go inside. The Temple really was just for worshipping.\nThere was no Sunday school, as such.",
        "Q: So did you get religious training at the school itself?\n9September 24, 2003",
        "A: Wi -- a -- a little bit of Hebrew. Not very much because I was -- it was too early\nto prepare for Bar Mitzvah. I was nine years old when I left, and --",
        "Q: Wh-When you played with your friends -- and I -- I realize you\u2019re quite young\nat the time, did you talk about the difficult times with them, or were you just\nchildren that played regular childhood games?",
        "A: We did pretty much -- we knew what -- what our limitations were, but within\nthat -- I don\u2019t think I was, as I said, particularly either worried, scared in an\neveryday way and we just continued to do what was pretty much what we wanted.\nBut there were limitations of things. We knew what not to do.",
        "Q: You had mentioned that you learned how to swim. Were there any other sports\nthat you got involved in as a young child?",
        "A: Oh, everybody played kind of sandlot soccer. That was probably the main\ngame. That was about the only one because anything that would be more formal\nwas really prohibited because you couldn't go to parks, you couldn\u2019t go to places\nwhere that existed.",
        "Q: So you did not have any contact with non-Jewish peers?",
        "A: Very, very little.",
        "Q: What about the non-Jewish neighbors of yours?",
        "A: Just no contact. We minded our business and that was it.\n10September 24, 2003",
        "Q: Were any of them pleasant to you?",
        "A: I don\u2019t really remember any contact with neighbors because living in an\napartment building, we were in the first floor. Therefore -- the f -- no, wait a mo --\nfir -- it was actually the second floor. There were stores on the bottom. The first\nfloor is what the Europeans call the f -- one flight up. And I didn\u2019t pass anybody\nexcept when I went out. So we had the whole floor. Our apartment had four\nbedrooms plus an office, so that I\u2019d have people over, we stopped using the\nplayground area in the apartment, because was considered a good idea. But there\nwere enough things to do that I didn\u2019t consider myself deprived.",
        "Q: Did you have a lot of toys and games, and did you read books?",
        "A: Yes, yes. I had -- I felt I had just about everything that -- I wasn\u2019t missing\nanything.",
        "Q: What were your favorite games to play?",
        "A: Probably trains. I had my -- I had model trains from as long as I can remember,\nand in fact, when we were ready to leave Germany, my grandfather gave me two\npresents. One was an HO gauge, which was new at that time. That was the small\ngauge model train, which could be set up on a table, that in case we were in a\nsmall apartment, 1t would fit on our dining room table. The other thing I got was a\ngolden watch for my Bar Mitzvah when I would have it, wherever we were.\n11September 24, 2003",
        "Q: Did you have any or -- or -- brothers or sisters?",
        "A: No, no. My mother had a couple of miscarriages and I was an only child.",
        "Q: Le -- I -- again, I realize you were very young at the time. Were you -- do you\nhave any memories, being a four year old, of the boycott, or any stories about the a\n-- the April 1\u2018, 1933 boycott. Family stories.",
        "A: We were not affected by that. In other words, due to the treaty, what the\nboycott was in the rest of Germany, 1936 was in -- was when it hit Upper Silesia.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: As far as memories is concerned, the only thing I -- I do remember my father\u2019s\nparents had a small hardware store, again on the main square, and I remember\ntheir house, which was above the store and I realize they did not have -- they only\nhad one area in the kitchen with running water, and for washing they still took a\nbasin with a jug for the hot water. So this must have been around 1934, because\nmy grandmother died of a stroke in 1935, after which my grandfather closed up\nthe store and moved to Gleiwitz to be near my parents.",
        "Q: So at the time, let\u2019s say, of the Nuremburg rally in 1935, your parents didn\u2019t\ntalk about this with you.",
        "A: It was -- it didn\u2019t affect us, therefore a lot of -- a-also, my father didn\u2019t lose his\nhospital privileges until 1936. Many other physicians left Berlin, for instance in\n12September 24, 2003\n1933 and 1934, because after the boycott, they saw the handwriting on the wall. It\ndidn\u2019t show up til much later in Silesia, so that it also had the fact that fewer\npeople really saw the urgency of leaving.",
        "Q: So when were the first restrictions, besides the school, that you remember?",
        "A: Mainly that we couldn't go into certain stores and that we more or less were\ngiven maps of what we could and what we couldn\u2019t do. But it didn\u2019t stop our\nmovement, but rather, there are just certain things which one doesn\u2019t do.",
        "Q: Did --",
        "A: And we took it in that sense, that same as parents said you don\u2019t -- you don\u2019t\ncross the main street.",
        "Q: Did you ever question any of this to your parents?",
        "A: Just that as si -- that it wasn't safe and that there are en-enough things for me to\ndo without it.",
        "Q: When did you see your first swastika?",
        "A: Probably quite early, because it was on every stamp, it was on every\ngovernment -- government building, but it was taken as something that -- that\nexisted, but didn\u2019t have the same connotations --",
        "Q: Same connotations of what?",
        "A: -- that we see now, of -- that it was a serious threat. And, in fact, most people\n13September 24, 2003\nfelt it would blow over and wouldn\u2019t last, particularly my mother\u2019s parents, who\nhad celebrated the hundredth anniversary of a wholesale leather business with a\ntannery in 1933, and survived in very good shape through the hunger of World\nWar I, when they could always barter leather for food at the local -- from the local\nfarmers. And felt they were pretty much immune from anything that would\nhappen. They really didn\u2019t appreciate what ha -- what was going on until\nKristallnacht.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Frank Liebermann. This is tape number one,\nside B. When did you first hear about a man called Adolf Hitler?",
        "A: Probably around 1935, because one did listen to speeches and the fact that he\nwas able to arouse almost riotous reactions, and people started talking about what\nwas going to happen next. Again, wa -- how political is a five year old, and I\ncouldn\u2019t really absorb what was going on in the same way as my parents, who\nobviously were quite concerned, as I said, whether it\u2019s a ocean voyage, learning\nEnglish and so forth. That became pretty clear even before the end of the treaty,\n14September 24, 2003\nand I\u2019d say around 1935. By the time I started school, which was in 1935, it was\nalready fully segregated and I just thought that\u2019s the way it had to be.",
        "Q: Now, 1935 is when you said your mother went to Palestine.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Were your parents already Zionists?",
        "A: No. No, it\u2019s -- they were always su -- very supportive of Zionism, mainly as a\nrefuge, and especially after the conclusion that a doctor couldn't make a living,\nthey eliminated the thought of moving to Palestine as one of the possibilities,\npretty early.",
        "Q: As things moved on, what about food? Were your -- were you able to get\nenough food? No -- any problems with that?",
        "A: No, there were no problems with food except there were certain regulations,\nthat on certain days -- I believe it was Friday or Thursdays, you had to do\neverything in one part in order to conserve fuel and I really don\u2019t know if these\nwere restricted -- restrictive laws for the Jewish community, or for everybody. Oh,\none other comment, which I think it interesting. The synagogue covered all\ndegrees of religious activities, from what we would say very Orthodox to quite\nReform. And there was only one synagogue. However, virtually all of the families\nbought from the kosher butcher, because he couldn\u2019t make a living on only the\n15September 24, 2003\npeople who were kosher. Consequently, we ate kosher food as a mitzvah for the\nrest of the community.",
        "Q: Did you observe Shabbat every week?",
        "A: We drove and I had my -- I once got caught with my scooter, and -- by my\nSunday school teacher, who objected, but I wasn\u2019t punished for it. And it\u2019s really a\nquestion of what is work in Biblical times, compared to what is work today, so I\nhave no strong feelings on the subject.",
        "Q: Did you have a family Friday night dinner?",
        "A: Yes, in fact for many years while my grandparents were still in Boyton, we\nalways went there for Friday night. My father had bought a car in 1933, which was\na major luxury at that time, was a convertible. Something like a VW convertible,\nexcept smaller. And every Friday night we would go to Boyton, which is -- as I\nsaid, it\u2019s about 20 miles away, and be at my grandmother\u2019s for dinner. And one of\nthe foods which I happened to have liked, which my kids could never understand,\nwas a liver soup. But she made a very good one.",
        "Q: Were -- did you have any childhood songs that you remember, that -- were you\nmusical? Was that something that gave you comfort?",
        "A: I would say most of the ones we had we learned from the maids, which were\n16September 24, 2003\nmo -- almost semi-Nazi songs. Bu -- rather war -- not Nazi, generally, but warlike,\nabout a comrade and things like this and [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Ca -- can you sing any?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Can you sing any of it?",
        "A: Yes. I had a comrade -- I mean, I\u2019m translating it -- we marched together in\nstep. Then a bullet came flying, I didn\u2019t know if it -- would it be meant for me or\nfor him? It was meant for him. He was tr -- he was shot down, he\u2019s lying on my\nfeet. I mean these ca -- and all kinds of militaristic th-things about the German\nforests and tha -- the songs were very nationalistic. Like -- almost like the army\nsongs that we learned here from the academies. Over hill, over dale, at -- and\netcetera.",
        "Q: How did your parents feel about you learning those songs?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what they knew or did anything else, but that was -- that\u2019s also\nwhat you heard on the radio. So that was almost pop culture. And I still remember\nquite a few of them.",
        "Q: Can you sing one or two lines from some of them?",
        "A: Like over hill, over dale, what was it? Just a second. [speaks German here]. In\nother words, hello, hello, what -- we\u2019re -- we\u2019re driving -- we\u2019re driving into the\n17September 24, 2003\nworld. Kind of suggesting the world is our oyster. And the re -- what you heard on\nthe radio was more and more that as it progressed. But I di -- again, as a six year\nold, I didn\u2019t understand the significance, except that I still remember some of\nthem.",
        "Q: All right, let\u2019s follow through now. When did you realize you were leaving, or\nwhat did your parents first seriously begin to do?",
        "A: First of all, my grandfather was a genealogist and when he -- when my father\nwere thinking of the United States, he looked up relatives. There were a couple of\nother relatives who had left and he gave em -- as I said before, he traced the family\nback to pretty early times. During my father\u2019s trip finally to the United States to\ntry to find affidavits for the family and the affidavit being to guarantee that\nwhoever comes over will not be on welfare, and would be supported for a year, he\nfou -- he sent my father to Philadelphia to check the grates records.\nUnfortunately --",
        "Q: What year was this?",
        "A: This was January, 1938. After correspondence, he took the trip an -- as a visitor\nand it happens that Rebecca\u2019s brother married a non-Jewish woman and emigrated\n-- rather, and went west to Louisville. There\u2019s some correspondence with the\nbrother, but only for the first generation, and then the family records were lost.\n18September 24, 2003\nAnd of course Rebecca never had any children, so that the family tree kind of\nstopped there.",
        "Q: Your -- your father did not have difficulty getting passage and a -- and a visa to\nvisit the United States in 1938\u201d?",
        "A: He could pay for it with German marks. The big problem was that you could\nonly spend German money, you couldn\u2019t take anything out. And visitor\u2019s visas\nwere granted. That isn\u2019t the same -- like you can go to Switzerland, but God\nforbid you should live there. At that point there was also a brother-in-law of my\nerandfather\u2019s father. No, wait a minute, it was a brother-in-law -- in-law of my\ngrandfather. Borrowed a substantial amount of money for a week and disappeared\nto the United States in 1935, almost causing -- causing a major business crisis, but\nthey averted bankruptcy. He found out that he was in New York and had a very\ngood job. In fact, he was vice president of Bendix aviation in 1938. And my father\ngot a vi -- an affidavit from him, on which we came over that July.",
        "Q: What was his relative\u2019s name?",
        "A: Charlie Marcus.",
        "Q: Was he willing to give your father the affidavit without any problem?",
        "A: He gave my -- my father got the affidavit and immediately left. I mean, he got\nthe affidavit in January. It took awhile for it to come through. We got a number\n19September 24, 2003\nand in fact I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s in the other records. Nothing was happening and\neverybody was getting kind of anxious. So a friend of theirs said look, what you\nhave to do is to get a box of candy for Fraulein Schmidt, who\u2019s the secretary of\nthe consul in Berlin. My father dutifully went to Berlin, got a box of candy and\nabout four weeks later nothing happened. And he called his friend again and what\ncan I do? And he said, well, what did you put into the box of candy? And he said\nnothing. I said, that was your first mistake. You have to put in a hu-hundred mark\nbill, and then you\u2019ll get action.",
        "Q: Now, this is from the American consulate?",
        "A: American consul. That was minor corruption compared to some of the smaller\ncountries, who took huge payouts and then very often issued fraudulent visas as\nhappened with the Saint Louis in Cuba. Virtually all the smaller countries made\nmajor businesses of giving visas with bribes. Some were legitimate and some were\nnot.",
        "Q: Now, were you aware at the time that your parents were making this effort to\nleave?",
        "A: Oh, definitely. I was aware that when I had to learn how to swim, that we\u2019 ll\nprobably take an ocean voyage.\n20September 24, 2003",
        "Q: And how did you feel that -- where you said you felt German, what were your\nthoughts before you left, about leaving Germany\u2019?",

        "Q: But you would be --",
        "A: [indecipherable] the question. I had no, basically at that age, the roots are with\nthe parents, not with the community. You\u2019re thinking now fo -- you\u2019re suggesting\nthe thoughts of a teenager --",
        "Q: Say you --",

        "A: Just that it was a fabulous country.",
        "Q: How did you know it?",
        "A: That\u2019s what my parents told me. I really knew very little, but that they had\nfriends there and they -- who\u2019ve gone before, and that they\u2019re sure I\u2019d like it.",
        "Q: Did you have a large extended family in Germany and therefore you\u2019d be\nleaving them?",
        "A: Primarily my mother -- my father had one brother who was in Austria, who\nemigrated to Austria. My mother\u2019s family was partly in -- was mostly in Opin,\n21September 24, 2003\nsome in Breslau and some in Berlin. The ones in Berlin were making plans to\nleave and another aunt was staying, and finally got to England around 1940.\nThat\u2019s about it -- that was about it of the content. The ca -- those were the major\ncontacts that we had.",
        "Q: So your father comes back and then applies for the visa with the candy and the",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and the money and then what happened?",
        "A: It finally came through, we had to go to Berlin for a physical in June, 1938 and\nthen we -- my father went on the next ship and left my mother to close the\nhousehold, because the visa was good for 120 days, so it was good through\nOctober. And we therefore booked in October, in order to pack what had -- d-deci\n-- my mother had to decide what belongings to take along. At that time we could\nstill pack what was called the lift, which is a container which, providing a tax was\npaid for the hundred percent value of whatever you\u2019re taking out. So that we did\ntake most of our furniture that was pack-able, most of my father\u2019s office\nequipment. We also -- he also bought the latest equipment that -- for state of the\nart and I also remember my mother bought the laser -- latest Singer sewing\nmachine, so that in case she had to sew our own clothes, and would -- she was\n22September 24, 2003\nquite good at being -- that was a way of eventually making money and surviving,\nbecause of course one couldn't take any money out, except the small amounts that\nthey were able to smuggle out by going to Czechoslovakia regularly and sending\nit forward. But that was necessary but quite dangerous and that was for bare\nsubsistence. Also, we went first class on the ship because you could pay for it in\nGerman money and first class pa -- allowed -- allowed you amount of spending\nmoney per person. So that spending money was our subsistence, because we used\nit and convert it in the -- in -- into dollars when we arrived here.",
        "Q: Why did your father go before you? Why didn\u2019t you three go together?",
        "A: Because he had to ta -- he had to study for the state boards, and he rented a\nroom for five dollars a week and signed up for the state boards in December, so\nthat -- and had to be a resident of Ohio in order to be eligible. If we w -- he would\nhave arrived in October, he would have lost six month. As it was, he signed up in\nJanuary on -- while a visitor and then took it in December. So for all appearances\nhe was a resident for almost a year, and he passed his state board. Ohio passed 50\npercent of those people taking it, and he passed it on the first try. And --",
        "Q: I-In English?\n23September 24, 2003",
        "A: In English. He had taken French and some English in high school. And of\ncourse medical terminology has quite a bit of Latin roots, which made that\nsomewhat easier.",
        "Q: So you and your mother were left in Germany to get ready to leave.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct. In other words, my mother basically sold the car, sold whatever\nshe could, had everything packed and in fact, we had an incident during that time,\nthat on the way -- that a -- while playing at the Schild area, I -- we were playing\ntag and I broke my arm. And when my mother called the hospital, a colleague of\nmy father, with whom they had -- not socialized, but with whom they had had\ndinner at various times in the early 30\u2019s, said I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t treat Jewish\nchildren, I can\u2019t help you. And she started making calls to have it set and found a\ndoctor in my father\u2019s hometown of Boyton, who agreed to meet us at the back\ndoor of a Catholic orphanage in Boyton. My mother took a taxi there, he set it and\nput it in a cast, and I -- this must have been in July and I -- by the time we left I\nwas out of the cast and it had pretty well healed.",
        "Q: We-Were there no Jewish doctors who would set it?",
        "A: Not in gli -- in Gleiwitz there was no -- there was no orthopedist. Remember, it\nwas a pretty small community. So --\n24September 24, 2003",
        "Q: And then, o-on your way out of the country, how did you -- what was your\njourney from Gleiwitz?",
        "A: From Gleiwitz, first we went to Opin to say goodbye to my grandparents, who,\nby the way were quite -- I won\u2019t say angry, but were not happy with my father\ntaking their only daughter to this strange country where we may not see them\nagain. My mother\u2019s brother -- one a -- one of the brothers, went with us. And I\nremember we had to stop in Berlin to get our passport stamped with a J. I think I\ngave that passport to the Holocaust Museum. We had to stand in line about four\nhours in the police station in Berlin before going on to -- to Bremerhaven from\nwhere we left.",
        "Q: Did your parents have those middle names that were assigned to Jews, Sarah\nand Israel on their papers?",
        "A: That -- no, that -- that was after -- I believe that was after Crystal Night. Oh,\none other incident. During the month of September, we got cable after cable from\nmy father to go on an earlier ship. We really didn\u2019t know why, because there was\nalmost complete censorship on what was going on at Munich, and that Hitler had\ncalled back the Europa, on which we were scheduled to sail from Cherbourg, as\na wharf rat. And when we finally arri -- ar -- my mother couldn\u2019t get an earlier\nsailing because it was -- it wa -- it was booked, and we needed to take a German\n25September 24, 2003\nship in order to take money out and to be able to pay in German money. When we\narrived in Bremen there was no ship. It was then that we found out that it was -- it\nlost, originally, two days, of which it had made up one, due to being called back.\nAnd the next day it arrived and we left one day late. And that was the first time I\nsaw my uncles cry, because he took us to the ship. That was my mother\u2019s brother,\nWalter. We had a pretty rough sailing, it was hurricane season and I was pretty\nmuch alone on the ship, most times, watching the bow go under the wav -- go into\nthe waves. But my mother I think, had partly a breakdown from all the strain and\npartly was seasick. We had a couple of other rather scary incidents. In the packing\n-- quote unquote friends said they wanted to help by packing my bicycle in a box\nand preparing it to use the least possible space. And they delivered the bicycle to\nus and it was packed, and -- with all the other things. And they had -- when we\npacked our bags, they had a customs inspector check all of the luggage to see that\nnothing illegal went in and put a seal on it. When we arrived on the ship, all the\nseals were broken open by the Gestapo, to check on the customs officials, because\nthe customs official said yes, I\u2019m going out for lunch now, don\u2019t touch anything.\nAnd -- but my mother didn\u2019t take any chances and left things copacetta.",
        "Q: Wha-What was it like for you to see people in Gestapo uniforms?\n26September 24, 2003",
        "A: By that time they were pretty scary and you just kept out of their way. My\nfather had quite an incident with an armed Gestapo coming into his office. As a\nresult of the -- there\u2019s a tra -- the way that you have a long term lease in -- or had a\nlong term lease in Germany, you gave a mortgage to the landlord, so it\u2019s basically\nyou lent him money. And for that it was a long term lease. When we decided to\nleave, he -- the landlord had to pay back the mortgage. And that was tra -- ordered\ntransferred to my father\u2019s bank account from the landlord\u2019s bank account.\nSomebody at the landlord\u2019s bank called the Gestapo that a large sum of money 1s\nbeing transferred to Dr. Liebermann, and consequently the two agents came in --\ninto the office while somebody was there and said we\u2019re here to arrest you. And he\nsaid, for what cause? You withdrew a large amount of money. I said, excuse me,\nthis was transferred to my account at such and such bank, which 1s frozen. I\nsuggest you call the bank. It\u2019s daytime. And fortunately the president of the bank\nwho knew him answered and said that they money is on deposit, and they left.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\n27September 24, 2003\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",

        "A: So that was shortly before he had left, but it 1s typical of the so-called small\nbureaucrats all trying to endear themselves to the party. And I\u2019m just giving that as\nan example. Wher -- as I mentioned, when we got to the ship, all of the seals were\nopened, but fortunately nothing was found and we were met -- we arrived here on\nOctober 20\".",
        "Q: What -- what day did you leave?",
        "A: On the 13\".",
        "Q: Were there any other people in your position on the boat?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know. I -- at -- th-there were times when I was probably one of\nabout half a dozen people in the dining room, mainly because I didn\u2019t get seasick.\nSo I spent most of my time just watching.",
        "Q: Were there other children?",
        "A: No. I didn\u2019t see anybody. Anyway, we stayed in New York for three days.",
        "Q: Do you -- and what was it like for you to land in New York? You would have\nbeen told about why --\n28September 24, 2003",
        "A: Well, the first thing -- the first thing that I was introduced to is the American\ndrink is a Coke and I thought I was getting cocoa. So that was my introduction to\nthe United States.",
        "Q: Did it have any meaning to you when you got off the boat and stepped on\nAmerican soil?",
        "A: Well, it looked gigantic. I had come from a small city, and New York is an\noverwhelming sight. One of the Americans on the ship showed me the Statue of\nLiberty and the Empire State Building before we landed. And --",
        "Q: Did you know what that was?",
        "A: Oh yes. I mean, he was very nice. He explained -- I think we left -- he told me\nabout Columbus Day. I got my first history lesson.",
        "Q: This was on the boat?",
        "A: On the boat, from an American passenger.",
        "Q: And you were speaking English to him?",
        "A: I have to -- I could speak a little English. I told you, I took English lessons. But\nof course I probably spoke it about as well as I speak German now, which is not\nvery good.",
        "Q: Were there many Americans on the boat?\n29September 24, 2003",
        "A: Again, I didn't see many people on the boat, because just a -- it was an\nextremely rough crossing, and as I say, it -- th -- most of the time there were\nmaybe -- between 10 and 20 people in the ma -- in the dining room. And that\u2019s a --\nthe first class section wasn\u2019t that big, but we had a lot of room to walk around on\nthe promenade deck. So I spent most of the time just being interest -- of course, I\nwas wondering why I wasn\u2019t invited to the Captain\u2019s table, since everybody -- in\nother words, I was about the only one who wasn\u2019t sitting on it. But I accepted that.",
        "Q: So then you -- you come to New York and your -- was your father at the dock?",
        "A: My father was at the dock. He splurged -- we had a room at the Hotel Taft for\nthree days, and then took the New York Central to Cleveland.",
        "Q: What was the reunion like between your mother and your father and you?",
        "A: Oh great, great. And in th -- Cleveland he rented one room -- one bedroom\napartment near Cain Park where I slept in the Murphy bed. That was my\nintroduction to the United States. And on the first Thursday we had a feast. We\nbought -- there was a deli downstairs and he bought a corned beef sandwich and a\nloaf of bread. And that was the first notaful American meal -- th-th -- the\nAmerican meal that I got. We had one other funny incident, we had a German\nsuper, who -- and I remember my parents commented that he spoke terrible\nEnglish and terrible German, saying in other words something was wr-wrong with\n30September 24, 2003\nthe faucet and th -- who answered [speaks German here]. In other words, I\u2019Il fix\nit for you, in other words sil -- and I remember my mother saying gee, I hope we\u2019ll\nbe able to learn at least one lang -- to speak one language well. They -- my parents\nwent out the first time, I remember -- I believe it was a Saturday, they went out to\na movie, and I believe it was -- it was a night of Kristallnacht, or rather the -- at\nthree o\u2019clock in the morning on -- and they had left somebody in the next\napartment to look after -- t-to look in on me. And I know -- and I remember\ngetting a call, a desperate call from my grandparents to talk to my mother, that the\ntwo brothers had been arrested and I think everything was -- and I just took\nmessages, who the operator was, and when they came back, the world changed. So\nthat was -- I said -- they got through to them and from that time on there was a --\nfirst of a -- the primary objective was still, the state boards were in December. And\nright after the state boards, after he got notice that he passed, which was, I think\nthe end of December, he had arranged to go to Philadelphia. Somebody had been\nrecommended, a professor at Hanneman. He wanted to learn American meth --\nmethods. That was a fraternity brother. He said, why don\u2019t you go there, and he\ndid that -- he wa -- he was at the pe -- their house, and he was particularly nice.\nAnd as he was leaving, he said, by the way, you mentioned that this Dr.\nSeiderman recommended me and I really don\u2019t know, who is he? So it turned out\n31September 24, 2003\nthat this colleague of his, a fraternity brother, basically wanted to get him out of\nCleveland because he shared an office with an ear, nose, throat surgeon. So he\nmade the suggestion that Dayton would be a good spot. And even though it wasn\u2019t\nwell meant, it turned out to be a very, very good recommendation, because it was -\n- there was no -- the reason he went there was that there was no Jewish ear, nose,\nthroat doctor in Dayton, but [indecipherable] he built up a very successful\npractice, partly with the help of the medical society in vetoing his admission by\npassing an expos facto law on a Friday night, sometime 1 -- after he made the\napplication requiring citizenship. Somebody leaked that to the newspaper and the\nDayton Herald, to which he was eternally grateful, had a Sunday editorial on\nfreedom of opportunity in the United States. And the following Monday he had\n11 new patients. So that was -- what do they generally say -- so anyway, the next\nMonday he had 11 new patients and that really established his practice. And oddly\nenough, his main practice was not Jewish. In other words, he was fair -- a fairly\nbrusque individual and -- who said what he wanted and didn\u2019t have the be-bedside\nmanners for Jewish pa -- that some Jewish patients preferred. By the way, another\nside. After the war, he was the recipient of the 75\" anniversary award for\ninternational HIAS, for his resettlement efforts. He gave over a hundred affidavits\n32September 24, 2003\npersonally, to sponsor people after World War II. He received that together with\nPresident Truman, and I think three others.",
        "Q: This is the Hebrew immigrant aid society award.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Let -- let\u2019s go back a little bit to when your parents heard the news about\nKristallnacht. Did they take any actions? After that you said they called the\nfamily.",
        "A: Well, when he went to Philadelphia, before going to Philadelphia -- oh, first\nof all, they fi -- they all wanted to leave at that point. In other words, they realized\nthat it was much more serious than they had believed at first. And he -- they made\nevery effort to try to get help. On the way to Philadelphia he stopped to see\nCharlie Marcus. And by the way, we had bought him a large crystal ass -- ashtray\nas a matter of thanks when we arrived. But on his second visit he said he can\u2019t take\nany more responsibility and it was my parent\u2019s belief that this was a little bit too\nclose. In other words, my father was once removed. My grandfather -- now it\u2019s --\nthey had -- he may want repayment for the debt, and he said he can\u2019t take any\nmore responsibility. This was, by the way, a man who filed, with the affidavit, his\nincome tax return of 1938 of 38,000 dollars. So I just say that for perspective. You\nknow what 38,000 dollars was in 1938. They did --\n33September 24, 2003",
        "Q: How did your par -- how did your parents handle this news?",
        "A: They did manage to get som -- my father\u2019s father, who had signed him into an\nold age home in -- or what would be called assisted living in Breslau, figuring that\nhe didn't want to be a burden. He was able to get an exit visa for him and he got\nsick on the way to the ship, and was taken directly to te -- Theresienstadt and\nnever got out. My mother\u2019s brothers were finally booked in 1940 on an Italian ship\nto Shanghai, which left, I think on the day of the breakthrough of the Maginot\nLine, which caused Italy to declare war on Britain and France, and the ship had\nto turn back because it didn\u2019t get through the Suez Canal. And that was the\nbrother that took us to the ship and my mother\u2019s other -- his twin, and his wife and\nfour year old daughter. My mother also had a younger brother, who was 11 years\nyounger, who was running constantly to Berlin to try to get every embassy for\nvisas. And at the age of something like 19, unfortunately was not successful. We\nnever knew whether it was a question of age or just that they were hitting their\nheads against a wall. But the next thing we heard that they were t-taken to\nTheresienstadt, I believe in 1941. And they had been married by Leo Baeck, who\nwas ara -- the rabbi in Opin before he moved to Berlin. After the war, my mother\ncontacted him when he visited Cincinnati. And he confirmed that they had been\nsent to Auschwitz in 1944.\n34September 24, 2003",
        "Q: So y --",
        "A: During this war -- during this time I got -- we got a few postcards through the\nRed Cross, heavily censored, only knowing that they were starving because they\nsaid, you know, they -- they gained weight and were -- and now we\u2019re up to 130\npounds. And -- typical correspondence, which the Red Cross was totally ignoring,\nbecause those conditions must have been apparent and nobody did anything.",
        "Q: So even after the anschluss in spring of \u201938, your -- your extended family did\nnot make an effort to leave, it was only after Kristallnacht?",
        "A: It was really only after KristalInacht. In fact, my grandfather offered my father\nthat if he moved to Breslau, there was enough of a Jewish community that he\ncould continue to practice medicine, and if he needed any help -- he had been the\nfamily patriarch. If anyone in the family couldn\u2019t make a living, he could open a\nleather business and get credit. And he just felt that he would be able to survive\nfrom his previous experience. Not particular -- not very atypical of a lot of other\npeople, unfortunately. I do remember o -- during the war period my mother helped\nmy father try to keep busy. She didn't stop wearing black until I asked her to stop\nin 1946, because from not knowing and basically --",

My father was\nfurious, because that was a capital offense and my mother and I could have been\nsent to a concentration camp for it. And he kept those gold pieces. After the war\nthey wanted a refrigerator from the United States, which he sent them pre-paid\nand my kids and my wife and I each have the gold pieces, which are of a Kaiser\nwho only served 90 days, and therefore very few were minted.

And he basically\nserved in Dayton. He volunteered for the army, but was rejected at that point --\nthis was in 1941, because Dayton became a very critical industrial area with a\nshortage of doctors.

And we went through the war in -- in Dayton, and as I said, he\nbecame very active -- he became the conduit for all immigrants coming in,\nbecause he had his connections in the Jewish community as well as being able to\nrelate to the immigrants.

        "A: I started in Cleveland being put back to -- a year. I started a -- I was put back\nin the third grade, as when I was 10 years old. But as soon as we moved to\nDayton, I was moved up a year and then again I skipped the fifth grade, so that I\nwas -- got back to myse -- to my level pretty quickly. I didn\u2019t have any problem\nwith friends, both Jewish and non-Jewish. I had an interesting experience in our\nTemple, since you asked about being religious. In Dayton the only tem -- the only\nsynagogue which had Sunday schools, had a Sunday school and a full time\nEnglish speaking rabbi -- was a Reform Temple, which at that time was ultra-\nReform. And I remember the first time we went -- I went to Sunday school, we\nhad an assembly which was -- they ran out of money during the Depression so that\nthe assembly hall was made into the Temple, a dual purpose with a -- with an\neverlasting light. And I did -- having been used to having something on my head,\nwhen I went into the Temple, I kept my baseball cap on and I remember -- I forget\nhis first now m -- his name -- name was Shapiro and he became a rabbi, said to\nme, Franz, it\u2019s impolite to wear a hat inside th -- rather, inside the Temple. So --\nbut he became very -- my father became very active in the Temple and was\nprobably pushing toward the more traditional side, because it was pretty much\nrealized that it had gone too far. I was never Bar Mitzvahed, because the Temple\ndidn\u2019t have Bar Mitzvahs in those days. Confirmation were thought to be a more\n39September 24, 2003\nappropriate age, especially since most kids stopped going to Sunday school after\nBar Mitzvah.

        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Frank Liebermann. This is tape number two,\nside B. And you -- I had asked you about whether you spoke about your\nexperiences.",
        "A: Really, that some -- I would say we kind of closed that chapter. I would --\nthat\u2019s also partly of the philosophy, whatever happened, you\u2019ve got to look\nforward. We made very strong effort -- I feel from the minute we stepped on\nAmerican soil, we considered ourselves American and kind of pushed anything\n40September 24, 2003\nthat we had before out of the picture. I -- we -- I learned to play one 0\u2019 cat, which\nwas the su -- the game in -- in those days of playing baseball with half a team. We\ndidn\u2019t have Little Leagues, or anything like that. I had to learn what football was\nbecause nobody here played soccer. And I became a -- an avid Cincinnati Reds\nfan. And I really didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t even know that I had an accent til I got to\ncollege, because was just ignored, this is who I was.",
        "Q: Were you still Franz at this point?",
        "A: Yes. I didn\u2019t really change my name until I got into business.",
        "Q: What was December 7\", 1941 like for you?",
        "A: We were -- we had gone out that morning and I remember after lunch, I think\nmy parents took a nap or went in the bedroom, tur -- we turned on the radio, and\nall [tape break] again, we had a -- we had a radio in the bedroom, and I guess it\nmust have been about two o\u2019clock that we heard the announcement, it was a state\nof disbelief. And of course I still vividly remember the speech of a day that wi-will\nlive in infamy. And that of course almost totally prevented any further contact\nwith the family, because the only mail that could go out was through Spain, or th -\n- through Portugal, up to that tor -- while Germany was ada -- rather, before\nDecember seventh. After that, all communication except the Red Cross, stopped.\n41September 24, 2003\nSo those -- that started a period of no communications that I really don\u2019t know\nhow my mother survived it. But I guess both parents were pretty strong people.",
        "Q: What was her state of mind? You said she was wearing black at that time.",
        "A: And she was just keeping busy. That\u2019s why I say, with volunteer organizations,\nshe decided to help in the office and it was pretty close to where we lived, so that\nwhen I came home -- she always had lunch for me and came home after school.\nAnd we really adapted very quickly to life in Dayton. In 1941 -- first of all in\n1940 I felt very privileged, we got a car, which was up to that point my father\ncould -- did -- commuted to the hospital by bus, because again, every dollar was\nextremely precious. I remember getting the car, getting the first glimpse of the\ncountry, and we took our first vacation in the Smokies that August. I was a boy\nscout and did all the basic activities that one is supposed to do and I felt very\ncomfortable, and had no problems getting used to the community.",
        "Q: Did anybody mistake you for just being German and not being a German Jew,\nand did you experience any discrimination?",
        "A: The one thing which we were laughing about is that I went to camp, I\ndeveloped hay fever, and when I -- I went to camp when I was 11 and I was able\nto take my folding camera. When I was 12, I became an enemy alien and we had\nto register as enemy aliens. And technically we\u2019re not allowed to get out of the\n42September 24, 2003\ncountry -- get out of the -- Montgomery county, which was Dayton, Ohio\u2019s\ncounty, without permission from the authorities. And basically we were laughing\nabout it. In other words, I as an 11 year old was free to travel, my parents weren\u2019t.\nBut --",
        "Q: Oh see -- you were not considered an enemy alien?",
        "A: Not until I turned 12.",
        "Q: Oh, oh, oh.",
        "A: That was in 1940 -- 1942 [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did that make you angry?",
        "A: We were laughing about it, because there was no place to go anyway. There\nwere travel restrictions, gasoline rationing. So what\u2019s the difference? But these\nother -- you -- you have to -- you have to laugh at anything that\u2019s funny.\nOtherwise, of course everybody -- we went through all the things which were done\nduring World War II. We were encouraged to ge -- to get Jo -- when we were in\nhigh school we were encouraged to get jobs to replace people. I worked in a\nclothing store for 35 cents an hour. But it -- there were such shortages and they\ndidn't -- I mean, my mother packed a lunch which was probably worth about two\nhours -- two or three hours work. But it gave everybody a sense of\naccomplishment, and my father regularly volunteered to give physicals, I think\n43September 24, 2003\ntwice a week at the recruitment center and every -- everybody pitched in and\nWorld War II was unique that it was -- got everybody\u2019s hundred percent -- it was a\nmoral war that everybody supported.",
        "Q: Did you follow the --",
        "A: The news? [indecipherable]",
        "Q: The news of the war, and how did you do that?",
        "A: Radio. In other words, I remember Lowell Thomas, H.V. Kaltenborn, oth --\nEdward R. Murrow and his reports, William Shire at first from Berlin, then\nelsewhere. I still na -- I still know all the reporters, and you basically pu -- could\nput everything together and it looked pretty bleak for awhile, but I think we\nquickly absorbed American optimism.",
        "Q: What about being aware of what was happening to the Jews?",
        "A: We knew it was bad, but there was a sense of helplessness. I remember the\nepisode with the Saint Louis, which was absolutely unbelievable, that -- we\nworshipped Roosevelt, who at the same time was such a political animal that he\nwould do anything to -- basically do what he felt was politically expedient. And of\ncourse, it\u2019s easy to say that in retrospect, but at the time, it couldn\u2019t be done.\nWhether it was a bombing of the rail lines, and -- or the camps.",
        "Q: When did your family know about the camps?\n44September 24, 2003",
        "A: Well, we knew about Dachau very er -- early on. Dachau was established\nbefore 1938. I was absolutely flabbergasted when I looked at the map, to see how\nclose Auschwitz was to Gleiwitz, and when we were back there, I took that one\nday trip into the area from czechsla -- from the Czech Republic, and when I\nlooked at the map I was flabbergasted. In fact, I had a very interesting -- got a very\ninteresting letter from the Holocaust Museum last week, forwarding a letter that\nthey received from Gleiwitz that in -- the local organization in Gleiwitz has -- I\nforgot the exact name, something for international relations, is going to dedicate a\nmemorial to the Jewish community, at the site of the synagogue. When I was there\nseven years ago, it was a rundown playground with asphalt and not a plaque,\nnothing. And the Jewish old age home became a police station. After that visit,\neverything else was pretty much unchanged, but I couldn\u2019t wait to get out and they\n-- now got notice that they\u2019re dedicating a memorial on the site of the synagogue\nand that the dedication is going to be on the 28\" and 29\" of October. And my wife\nand I and my three kids, and Joe and his family are going there for the dedication.\nAlso visiting Berlin, which I understand has a new Jewish museum. And I feel I\nwant to show the kids our roots, and I also want to show the people who are doing\nthis that it\u2019s about time. That\u2019s [indecipherable]. In fact, when I wrote the letter\nof acceptance that we\u2019re all coming, and I mentioned the European titles, that all\n45September 24, 2003\nmy children are being doctors and lawyers, all have the European titles as doctors,\nthat we\u2019re coming and that I hope the visit will be a very productive and\nmemorable experience for all of us and them. And that\u2019s the reason I feel strongly\nabout going. I si -- it still hasn\u2019t been determined whether they\u2019re financing it, but\nI\u2019m willing to finance it, because I think it 1s for a good cause, even though a\ncouple of my kids disagree.",
        "Q: Will you be speaking to any groups over there?",
        "A: Apparently yes. I don\u2019t know what the language barrier is going to be. But the\nhead of the organization writes perfect English, so knowing that most schools are\nbilingual, we should be able to communicate to some extent, although when we\nwere there seven years ago in Opin, that\u2019s the town where my mother was born,\nwhere I found the apartment where the business was and also where the Temple\nwas, which is now a Russian style office building, I couldn\u2019t communicate in\neither English or German. And when we went to a restaurant, we finally pointed to\nthe table next to us, where they had soup and a sandwich, and that\u2019s how we ate\nlunch. So it should be an interesting experience.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s get back to the war. Any other mention that you want to make of the war?\n[phone ringing, tape break]. As I was saying -- saying to get back t-to the war,\nyou were following what was happening and communication got less and less --\n46September 24, 2003",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- from the family, and -- and your parents state of mind because they were\nbusy, was functioning and they were doing worthwhile projects and so forth?",
        "A: They were definitely not only functioning, but became extremely active in any\nkind of relief efforts. And as I said, it went to other causes after that.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Because that was their way of making up for the family that was lost, that\nphilosophically our feeling is, you can\u2019t replace what\u2019s lost, but you can better\nwhat can be replaced.",
        "Q: Were you speaking to your family still in German?",
        "A: No. We stopped speaking German probably within six months. But of course\nwe all spoke with an accent, and I do not have very -- I am [indecipherable]\ngraphic and picture person and I do not have very much language talent.\nTherefore, I never heard the difference. And that\u2019s the only way I can explain the\nfact that I reta -- I retain my accent after 65 years.",
        "Q: Then it\u2019s the end of the war, and what was that like for you and your family?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s when everything unfolded and the realization came that nobody\ncould be traced. In other words, it was finalized by Leo Baeck, which must have\nbeen in the late 40\u2019s or early 50\u2019s when he came here. And it became quite\n47September 24, 2003\nobvious that my uncles never made -- never made it back to where they came\nfrom, and as I said, you have to use the energy positively and that was the family\nphi -- philosophy.",
        "Q: So you became a high school student, were you active in high school, and have\na lot of interests?",
        "A: Very -- a lot of interests, yes. I consider myself a reasonably good student. I\nparticipated in various clubs, a lot -- mostly political. And I guess it shaped me\nalso in a fairly liberal philosophy that Jews have always prospered in any fu --\nliberal society, and it\u2019s important that everybody has the rights that they\u2019re entitled\nto because it rubs off. And I still thi -- I travel a lot, being that it\u2019s my business, but\nI still kiss the ground every time we come home, whether I agree with policies or\nnot.",
        "Q: And then you completed high school, graduated from high school, and then\nwhat?",
        "A: I went to college, Western Reserve University and during my sophomore year\nI met my wife, who by some accident or act of faith was the first European woman\nI ever dated. And we got -- we were married as soon as I finished college. It\u2019s just\nabout 53 years ago.\n48September 24, 2003",
        "Q: Ho-How did you meet your wife?",
        "A: Both of us went on unwilling vacations where our parents wanted to rest a few\ndays in Lake Placid. And then we started corresponding and one thing led to\nanother. We kept the New York Central Railroad in business. They went\nbankrupt after we got married.",
        "Q: So where was she living?",
        "A: She lived in Kew Gardens, New York and I lived in Ohio, but I went to\nWestern Reserve in Cleveland and she went to Syracuse. And the distance to\nSyracuse was quite a bit shor -- shorter from Cleveland. That was kind of little bit\nbetter than halfway. So it was doable.",
        "Q: And did your -- you said your wife was European, where did her family come\nfrom?",
        "A: Vienna. And when -- when the anschluss occurred, her father was also in the\nleather business and had a customer in Philadelphia, a person, not Jewish, who\noffered them an affidavit. And they came here -- they wen -- their name is Simon,\nmaybe they had Jewish roots somewhere, but they definitely were not, and they\nlived on the Main Line in Philadelphia. And they came over in the same ship as I\ndid, one sailing earlier, the one that was -- that was sent back during Munich. But\n49September 24, 2003\nwe probably wouldn\u2019t -- wou-would have hated each other wa -- if we met when\nwe were nine years old.",
        "Q: And then you got married and where did you live?",
        "A: In -- first in Kew Gardens, and then Great Neck. And when I -- I worked in\nNew York for -- until 1992.",
        "Q: What kind of work did you do?",
        "A: I was in charge of production of textiles. I was in -- for a textile converting\nfirm, until I retired. And after six months of retirement we -- rather, we moved to\nWashington because my two daughters both had gone to school -- to graduate\nschool here and retire -- an-and found New York boys to marry in Washington,\nso we decided to live in -- to move here where we could grow new roots. And\nwe ve been living here for about 10 years, and since I\u2019d done a lot of business\ntravel, I went int -- went to travel school to learn the computers and I\u2019ve been\ndoing that since we live here and I work full time and travel a lot.",
        "Q: When were your children born?",
        "A: 1951, \u201954 and \u201955. And they all have families. Joanie, being the oldest has two\n-- has a daughter of 18 and a son 16. And he is the one who is going with us to\nPoland na -- which became Poland after World War II when I -- I say -- I became\nPolish retroactively when the borders changed. And my other -- my son has a\n50September 24, 2003\ndaughter who is 12, and my other daughter has two daughters, age 14 and 12, who\nalso live in Washington. Jerry, my son, lives in Seattle.",
        "Q: Does he have any children?",
        "A: Yes, I said, a daughter of 12.",
        "Q: Oh [indecipherable]. Mm-h. Now -- and your parents stayed in Dayton?",
        "A: My fa -- my father stayed in Dayton unt -- until he died in 1979. My mother\ntried to s-stay in her house in Dayton and unfortunately developed fairly severe\nParkinson\u2019s Disease. And finally after she couldn\u2019t manage with round-the-clock\nhelp, she -- we brought her to Washington in 1993, and she died in the Hebrew\nhome, 1995. But my kids did know her.",
        "Q: Your parents you said were very active, Jewishly, in community --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and your father sponsored a lot of affidavits. Were they friendly with many\nother refugee Jews?",
        "A: Some, but their roots really were in the general community, both Jewish and\nnon-Jewish. In other words, we tended not to be cliquish and believed\nphilosophically in being fully integrated. To me it was a step backwards to move\nto Great Neck, which is kind of a gilded ghetto, and I prefer Washington for that.\n51September 24, 2003",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk now a little bit about some of your thoughts. Do you -- which you\u2019ve\nalready expressed some already. D-Do you feel that you would be a different\nperson today if you hadn\u2019t had the childhood and the experience that you went\nthrough?",
        "A: I\u2019ve been -- let me answer it in a different way. I\u2019ve met a fairly substantial\nnumber of Germans and I confront the history. I feel that the Holocaust is\nprobably almost as much part of the German psyche as it 1s the Jewish psyche.\nI\u2019ve also noticed that the -- by the numbers that come to the Holocaust Museum. I\nfeel ve had a much, much richer life in the United States than I ever would have\nhad in Gleiwitz, even if it hadn\u2019t -- there hadn\u2019t been a war or Holocaust. So I\nsometimes use a statement in speaking to Germans, the best revenge 1s living well.\nAnd I believe in that philosophy and I think our children reflect it, that the\nopportunities, I\u2019m talking about cultural and otherwise, that we\u2019ve had in New\nYork and Washington are far greater than anything we could have experienced in\nUpper Silesia in the best of times.",
        "Q: Ho-How did you convey your religious feelings to your children?",
        "A: We sent them to Sunday school. I\u2019m a great believer that the two most\nimportant things you give your children are roots and wings. And they all not only\nwent through Confirmation class, but they all went through post-Confirmation\n52September 24, 2003\nclass in order to be rooted not only Jewish religion, but Jewish philosophy. I\u2019m a\nphilosophical Jew. My father used to say, I may eat traif, but I like to think\nkosher.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\n53September 24, 2003\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Frank Liebermann. This is tape number\nthree, side A. When did you change your name to Frank?",
        "A: When I started working for a commercial firm. First th-there were two things\nwhich I had to do. One is sound American, and change my signature that nobody\ncould read it, because at the time we were doing export business, the first customer\nI di -- I did correspondence with was M.B. Herrairi in Baghdad. And when I\nwrote a letter and signed my name, my boss said, this is something you have to\nchange immediately. And he signed just initials and make a scribble and you never\nput any name, just initials, that we can tell whom -- who you are, and then I just --\nit was easier to be Frank because it\u2019s a common name, people remember it better,\nand I had no trouble doing it.",
        "Q: How did your parents feel about your changing your name?",
        "A: No objection. Although my father kept his name Hans, and he kept the second\nN, because he said, I don\u2019t want to be -- I don\u2019t want to live with any kind of\npretense. This is who I am and I don\u2019t want to change it. My wife has adopted that\nphilosophy and insists on the two N\u2019s. She sa -- wh-when my kids went to camp\nand the company made mistake on the nametags, she sent them back once,\n54September 24, 2003\nbecause she\u2019s very firm on it and my kids also retained the Liebermann with two\nN\u2019s.",
        "Q: Did your children have a -- become a Bar and Bat Mitzvah?",
        "A: Oh definitely. Again, we believe in -- we believe in studying and in the Jewish\nphilosophy that you really -- in 0 -- in order to defend yourself, you have to know\nwho you are. And probably the people who fared least well in the Holocaust were\nthose who really didn\u2019t know who they were. In other words, even the ones who\nconverted were considered Jews. And they didn\u2019t have the background to deal\nwith it. And I would say this is one of the things I learned from the Holocaust.",
        "Q: Well, you were very young when you went through what you did. When your\nchildren were that age, did it bring, you know, seven, eight, nine and so forth, did\nthat -- did it bring back that part of your childhood to you, when they were the\nsame age?",
        "A: No, not really at that age, but I know that my children persuaded my mother to\nwrite her autobiography, because they wanted their sense of history.\nUnfortunately, it was fairly late and we had to do a lot of editing because she\nwrote a lot of notes originally. And I want to thank my daughter-in-law, who did a\nwonderful job on the computer in putting her various stories together in a logical\n55September 24, 2003\nway, which became difficult at the time she did it, which was probably in her mid-\n80\u2019s.",
        "Q: What happens to you when you see a swastika now? What runs through your\nhead?",
        "A: Since I -- I an -- I would say I have come to grips with it. I woul -- I\u2019m\nsaddened when I see it. I\u2019m beyond angry. Basi -- as I say, I confront Germans at\nvarious times and I feel you can\u2019t undo history, but you have to ta -- you have to\nlearn from it. This is one reason why -- my wife managed to get me tickets for the\nconsecration of the Holocaust Museum on that rainy, cold, miserable day, when\nthere wasn\u2019t a seat to be had in the part that was roped off for people who wanted\nto bear witness, while in front, the part that was left for the dignitaries was half\nempty. It\u2019s also wa -- why, when I had a chance, I volunteered at the museum,\nbecause I feel I can convey a message and I\u2019m glad to be doing it. My kids are\nvery much aware of their roots, and that\u2019s a reason why they are going on the trip\nnext month, because I said we be -- as a family believe in roots and wings.",
        "Q: Are you angry that you had to leave Germany and your family had to go\nthrough what it did, and you had the losses that you had, and other people didn\u2019t?\nLet\u2019s say Jews here in the United States?\n56September 24, 2003",
        "A: Not at all. Look, we made the best of a bad situation. We were very fortunate.\nMy father\u2019s good fortune was that he lost his living relatively early in 1936, and\nthat he had the foresight to leave. My father-in-law, who left Vienna, said you\nknow, his good luck was that he was not too old or too rich. Either of those\ncircumstances made many people victims.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And early on it\u2019s a very, very traumatic experience to move. I know it from\nNew York, or fro-from Great Neck to Washington that it wasn\u2019t easy. Moving to\na strange country is extremely hard. But once you do it and succeed, I feel I could\nnot have had the life that I\u2019ve had, if we had stayed, forgetting about the politics\nand everything else that occurred. So, I\u2019m certainly not angry, but I\u2019m trying to be\nconstructive.",
        "Q: How old were your children when you told them about the loss of their -- their\nrelatives?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, but we made no secrets of it. No, it -- we\u2019ve always been\nopen. I\u2019ve -- I\u2019m not smart enough to keep secrets, because then you always have\nto remember what you s -- whom you said what to, and we kept various pictures.\nWe still have albums of family that are -- particularly my granddaughter has used\nfor some of her art projects, and that\u2019s part of our heritage, that we\u2019re survivors.\n57September 24, 2003",
        "Q: What does it mean to you to be a survivor?",
        "A: I\u2019m happy to have made the best of the situation. I\u2019ve probably become very\nfamily conscious on how important it is, and I think I\u2019m try -- I\u2019m trying to pass\nthat on to my children and grandchildren, with whom we try to travel and give\nthem as many benefits as we can f -- as we can find, or as they\u2019re willing to\naccept. That\u2019s -- that\u2019s all I can say.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about some of your political views. You -- you did allude to that\nbefore --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- because of what you went through. You want to le -- elaborate a little more?",
        "A: Well, I -- I would say I\u2019m -- I -- I\u2019ve become a student of history, Biblical and\notherwise. And if you do that, you realize that the Jewish community has always\ndone well in a free society. And therefore, I think there\u2019s a reason why Jews tend\nto be liberal in their own self interest. And some of the trends we have th -- do\nworry me, because we don\u2019t seem to be getting our message across as well as we\ndid in former years. In other words, I\u2019m not -- when -- even when Senator\nLieberman mentions God too often, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s -- that belongs in politics.\nNow, one of the things that made things so easy for the Germans is that the\nchurches and synagogues were fun-funded by the state. In other words, you gave a\n58September 24, 2003\ncertain part of your taxes to go to the church of your choice. And therefore, they\nhad complete records of what everybody was and thought, whether they were with\nthem inic -- or against them. And I therefore don\u2019t like some of the trends that we\nsee now in fighting terrorism, of invading civil liberties. I mean, I certainly don\u2019t\nmind giving my name, but some of the illegal searches and so forth, scare me.",
        "Q: Does that remind you of Germany in the 30\u2019s?",
        "A: That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. And being specific, Mr. Ashcroft, who I think is\ngoing over the line. So it has shaped my political views.",
        "Q: What are your thoughts about the State of Israel?",
        "A: Well, I am very sad that the middle in the world is losing power. In other\nwords, the extra -- you only hear from the extremes, in other words, the right wing\nor the left wing. The only way that that conflict will ever be solved is through\nsome fairly tough compromises on both sides. And the further we go to the\nextremes, the harder it\u2019s going to be to come to terms with It.",
        "Q: What are your thoughts about the necessity for a State of Israel?",
        "A: Look, it\u2019s -- 1t certainly -- I\u2019m very much for the state, even though I wasn\u2019t\nalways. I didn\u2019t want a nationalistic -- I didn\u2019t want to be identified with policies\nwith whi-which I disagree. At this point I believe it\u2019s here to stay, it\u2019s -- when the\nwhole world closed, if we had had a State of Israel, that wouldn\u2019t have happened.\n59September 24, 2003\nPhilosophically, I think the Likud policy of trying to presser -- of the occupied\nterritories 1s contrary to Jewish la -- to Jewish law and contrary to Jewish interests,\nbecause they\u2019re trying to create a South Africa, where we have -- you can\u2019t be a\nreligious state where some people are more equal than others. And there is merit in\n-- if you want to have a Jewish state, it has to be pretty much limited to the Jewish\npopulation and you can\u2019t be Imperialist. Because strictly on basis of the increased\nbirthrate, if they carry it on the way it was done in Lebanon, where it used to be\n50-50, and then you had a ruling minority, that is poison for stability. So I\u2019m --\nI\u2019m thinking of it again from a philosophical rather than a political point of view.",
        "Q: And you are concerned about the stability of the State of Israel?",
        "A: Certainly as an occupying power, it can\u2019t work in the long run.",
        "Q: Did you have -- or did you follow the Eichmann trial, and what were your\nthoughts when that was going on?",
        "A: Look, he was a monster. I had -- I don\u2019t think that he could get justice, no\nmatter what happened. And I suppose it was expedient to get rid of him, even\nthough a -- I think they were successful in not making him a martyr, but there was\na danger of that. Sometimes a MacArthur idea of old soldiers, sometimes if they\ncould have faded away, it probably would have been just as good. In other words,\nI\u2019m not a revenge person, but I\u2019m not always sure that that\u2019s for the best in the\n60September 24, 2003\nsame way that eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, which they are doing in Israel,\nbecause it just creates more unrest and more anger. On the other hand, I\nunderstand that you can\u2019t let yourself become a victim without reacting. It\u2019s a\ndilemma.",
        "Q: Do you feel German in any way now?",
        "A: No. In fact, my -- Iam much more sensitive, though, to German characteristics,\nwhich probably wouldn't bother somebody else, they do bother me. I\u2019m talking\nabout the pushiness that I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve gone through Germany in part. In a store, if\nthey have the sale, they go with elbows. That probably bothers me more than it\nwould bother somebody else. Or the very rigid bureaucrats. So I\u2019m sensitive to\nthose characteristics, but I try to avoid them.",
        "Q: So you have no emotional attachment in the sense of the place you were born.",
        "A: None at all. None at all. In fact, I once got in a conversation with a tra -- when\nwe were on a ferry in New Zealand. [| got on fairly early and I got a very good\nseat and opposite me sat -- somebody came in later and said in German to the\nneighbor, I wonder where I can get something to eat. And I gave him directions in\nGerman. So he looked at me and said, how come you speak such good German?\nAnd I gave him the answer, translated, I was once German. And he said, how can\nyou say that, it\u2019s your Fatherland. I said, not for me. And I got into a discussion\n61September 24, 2003\nwith him. His father was a minister and he hadn\u2019t really come to grips a fact that\nhe didn\u2019t speak up. And I think I had him in tears during that trip. He was a tour\nleader for Budget Tour. We were going on a f -- in a fairly comfortable way. And\nthat\u2019s where I originally started using the term, the best revenge 1s living well. And\nI\u2019ve used it several times since, but that really brought it up. And that sums up my\n-- my German feelings.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk a little bit now about the Holocaust Museum. You did mention that\nyour wife arranged for tickets for the opening ceremonies, but what was your first\nencounter with the museum?",
        "A: Well, at the opening, I had to take a woman from the Temple sisterhood on the\ncondition that I take her out for lunch. Which I dutifully did and I went through it\nand of course I heard the protest of six million lies right across the street. It was a\nvery emotional morning. And then I just felt I wanted to bear witness. But after\nSeptember 11\", when the travel business really collapsed, and for a month we did\nnothing but give credits and retur -- arrange for refunds for the days that nobody\ncould travel, I was asked to work three days a week, and I took the course at the\nmuseum, and I started to volunteer. Now my -- my agency asked me to come back\nin January, and I told her look, once they\u2019 ve invested their time, I feel I have an\n62September 24, 2003\nobligation. And ever since I\u2019ve been doing that Thursday morning, then I work the\nrest of the time. I get th -- I get to the office by about two o\u2019clock.",
        "Q: So you\u2019ve been working at the museum since January 2002?",
        "A: Actually, yeah, since the fall of 2001.",
        "Q: Right, after September 11\", and then you took --",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s almost two years.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It'll be two years fing -- December first.",
        "Q: In between the time of the opening in \u201993, and -- and September 11, 2001,\nwhat was your contact with the museum?",
        "A: Just that I had gone a couple of times. I decided to donate my grandparent\u2019s\nbusiness papers, which my mother kept with all kinds of correspondence, and the\nbookkeeper had preserved them, and whatever other letters we had in our\ncollection, because I felt my kids can\u2019t read German, I can barely read German\nbecause the grammar is so cumbersome that I may as well give it to somebody\nwho can -- who can use it. So I\u2019ve had that relationship with them, and I had gone\na couple of times, and of course, I\u2019d recommended it.",
        "Q: Recommended it to other people to see.\n63September 24, 2003",
        "A: Yeah, people. And I got a wonderful letter from a Catholic friend of my wife\u2019s,\nwhom I gave tickets to, about how moved they were.",
        "Q: What kind of work do you do at the museum?",
        "A: I\u2019m just information, you know. Greeting, elevators, tickets, information --",
        "Q: So you\u2019re 1n vi -- you\u2019re 1n visitor services.",
        "A: Visitor services, exactly. And frankly, I enjoy the once a week, invigorating\nexperience of going to the mall area and interesting people that we meet at the\nmuseum.",
        "Q: Has working there affected your memories of your early childhood?",
        "A: Not really. No, I have no -- I am -- I am past the point of being emotionally\nrepressive or -- in other words, I -- I handle it in an unemotional way now. Even\nthough when I gave the lecture and put it all together, at the end I was tearful.",
        "Q: Wh-When you gave a lecture --",
        "A: At Madera. That was --",
        "Q: This was your --",
        "A: -- that was draining.",
        "Q: This was your grandchild\u2019s --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- school.\n64September 24, 2003",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: This is a high school that you spoke to.",
        "A: Yes. But, let\u2019s see, I keep on living and try to make the most of it.",
        "Q: When you\u2019re at the museum and you\u2019ve gone through the exhibit in the fifth\nfloor, in the 1930\u2019s in Germany, do you identify with that?",
        "A: The one that really got me -- oh, sh -- one second, I turn it off [tape break] --\nnot re -- the one that I got -- probably was most emotional about was the present\nexhibit on the children.",
        "Q: This is the hidden children exhibit.",
        "A: Yes. And the last ti -- wa -- again, when I was emotional is in \u201cSchindler\u2019s\nList\u201d when they lead the children away. That\u2019s something that I can\u2019t come to\nterms with, and I think of my cousin, who when we left she was three years old.",
        "Q: And who did not survive.",
        "A: Who did not survive. I mean, none of the children survived.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Do you identify with the children yourself?",
        "A: No, no, no. I mean, I identify as what happened to -- children were totally\nhelpless and -- and I would sa -- it\u2019s probably -- that\u2019s the only pogrom that\u2019s di --\nthat really -- attacked the children first. From a phils -- philosophical way of\ndestroying the community.\n65September 24, 2003",
        "Q: What is your relationship with other survivor volunteers at the museum?",
        "A: Good. I have no -- I mean, I like some better than others. Some people you\nrelate to, that\u2019s normal.",
        "Q: Do you exchange stories with them?",
        "A: Not really. We don\u2019t have time.",
        "Q: Do you feel a connection with those who came from Germany\u201d",
        "A: Again, I look strictly as people. I don\u2019t have any -- no more -- I usually ask\nwhere people are from, whether they\u2019re from Ohio or New Zealand and places\nthat I\u2019ve been to. From the museum, that\u2019s more interesting.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Frank Liebermann. This is tape number\nthree, side B, and we were talking about your experiences at the museum. Would\nyou encourage other survivors to volunteer at the museum?",
        "A: I think it\u2019s -- I think it\u2019s quite important that I sometimes do ask, if I\u2019m the\nsurvi -- actually, I don\u2019t consider myself a survivor, because my parents with their\ngood fortune got me out before \u201938, or during \u00b038 and I really had a minimum of\n66September 24, 2003\ntrauma. But by being represented as somebody who 1s authentic, I think it adds to\nthe experience of people at the museum, and I do get asked.",
        "Q: You get asked what?",
        "A: Whether I was a survivor. And I say yes, even though I don\u2019t believe it myself.\nIn other words, the category of survivor is somebody who really went through\nsome of the hell which happened after Crystal Night.",
        "Q: What are your feelings when you walk into the building?",
        "A: I think it\u2019s a fabulous piece of architecture. In other words, the somewhat\ndisjointed look is, I think, a marvelous achievement. People often ask me, you\nknow, about the map that they give out. And I said, it really doesn\u2019t help because\npeople didn\u2019t know from one moment to the next what\u2019s going to happen. So you\ncan\u2019t put that in a map. That\u2019s my standard comment.",
        "Q: Do you feel like you belong there? There\u2019s a connection to the museum for\nyou?",
        "A: Yes. In other words, I feel that somewhere I can contribute more than I\nprobably could elsewhere.",
        "Q: But I meant an emotional connection when you walk in.",
        "A: Ah, I do not tend to be that emotional. In other words, I appreciate the\nhappenings and I -- I try to ra -- I try to believe in reason over emotion. Not that I\n67September 24, 2003\ndon\u2019t get emotional, but this is not -- I don\u2019t have the connection that way, except I\nthink that it -- that it\u2019s an important part of education and I have taken -- I\u2019ve\ninvited -- for instance, I\u2019ve invited my kids and grandchildren to the celebration of\nsurvivors, November first. And I think that\u2019s important. But from an educational\npoint of view, rather than a strict emotional point of view.",
        "Q: What are your thoughts about the non-Jewish staff and volunteers?",
        "A: They again -- 1t depends which ones. Some of them are strictly business, others\nare really devoted. And also in th -- among the volunteers are some non-Jewish\nvolunteers. You don\u2019t know what reasons people have for reacting. So-Some of\nthem take it strictly they\u2019ve had experience in museums and it\u2019s a museum job.\nOthers do it because they feel it -- it\u2019s particularly important. And both kinds of\npeople are useful. No other comments.",
        "Q: Do you go to many of the lectures and presentations?",
        "A: I don\u2019t have time, because I leave there and go directly to work. If they have\nsomething in the evening, preferably on weekends, it\u2019s much easier than during\nthe week. Course I -- I get home around quarter to six. By the time I have dinner\nduring the week, that\u2019s -- that makes for a long day -- we -- and we go to the\ntheater a lot in the weekends and have cond -- all kinds of subscriptions. It\u2019s -- you\ncan only do so much.\n68September 24, 2003",
        "Q: You had said that the hidden children exhibit was particularly meaningful for\nyou. Are there any other exhibits in the permanent collection that -- or any other\ntemporary exhibits that really were very memorable, or are very memorable for\nyou?",
        "A: Again, they have all been very educational, whether it\u2019s bringing up the book\nburning and the intellectual philosophy of race superiority and so forth, which was\npopular in -- throughout the world, it was just taking that to an extreme. And I say\none of the -- one of the things that\u2019s unbelievable about the Nazi movement is the\nhigh emotional pitch that it could get to. And that\u2019s such a danger sign that it still\nhasn\u2019t been explained to me. In other words, how the political rallies can be so\ndevastating. On so -- so-called educated people. That\u2019s the reason I tr -- I try to be\nunemotional.",
        "Q: Because it\u2019s dangerous to be emotional.",
        "A: Yes. You said it in different words.",
        "Q: Has the world learned lessons from the Holocaust, do you think?",
        "A: I wish it really had, but the fact that it\u2019s recognized hopefully will be helpful.\nWe probably won\u2019t know for another two or three generations.",
        "Q: In closing, do you have any message to those two or three generations?\n69September 24, 2003",
        "A: Unless you lear -- unless you study history, you can repeat mistakes. That\u2019s the\nreason I\u2019ve been -- i -- the Holocaust really has made me look at history, including\nby the way, the re-religious history of the New Testament, or rather the -- the\nChristian Bible, to be correct. That in making it the national religion of Rome,\nConstantine basically had to absolve the Romans. And therefore, it was easiest to\nblame the Jews. And that is not an uncommon way of interpreting history, that it\u2019s\nalways written by the victors, about the people who can\u2019t answer, after the fact. So\nthe study of accurate history is extremely important and history is generally not\ntaught very well, as to what the real issues are. I think that\u2019s the end of my\nthought.",

        "A: January 19\", 1929, in Gleiwitz, on the main street, Wilhelmstrasse Funf.",
        "A: My father was Dr. Hans Liebermann, an ear, nose, throat specialist who\npracticed medicine in Gleiwitz, and we had an office attached to our apartment on\nthe main street.",
        "A: Yeah. My mother was born Lotta Flora Olgala in Opin and married my fa --\nSeptember 24, 2003\nwas introduced to my father at a -- a fraternity dance when she was only 16 and\nthey were married four years later in 1928, February 28.",
        "A: Back to about 1650. The family Olgala and Bloch were in Lanendorf,\napparently having emigrated from Alsace-Lorraine during various pogroms there\nand settled in Opin. In fact, one of -- one of our foremothers married Michael\nGratz, who eventually -- whose -- I think granddaughter became Rebecca Gratz\nin Philadelphia. And my grandfather was very proud. He made a family tree,\nwhich we have, which showed the family and that branch.",
        "A: Well, Gleiwitz was a town of little bit over a hundred thousand people, with\nprobably about a thousand Jews, primarily merchants, professional, and of course\nalso others. We lived, and as I said my father had his office on the main street with\na connected apartment. I considered myself very middle class, in the respect that a\n-- my mother had for the time a nursemaid for me who stayed almost until we left,\nand was active in the community. They had bil -- were quite active before 1935\nalso, in the general community, but that changed drastically with the coming of the\nNazis, to be limited really, to Jewish activities.\n ;September 24, 2003",
        "A: My father came from an Orthodox home, my mother came from a barely\nreligious home. My grandfather was kosher, my parents did not keep a kosher\nhome, except when my grandfather moved in after my grandmother died. He\nmoved to Gleiwitz from my father\u2019s birthplace, which was in Boyton, about 20\nmiles away from Gleiwitz. At that time we went to -- we had a kosher home and\nmy grandfather, even though he had a separate apartment, usually came to us for\nmeals, really until we left.",
        "A: Yes. I mean, we celebrated all holidays. I also remember -- rather my father\nwas fairly observant in that I n -- I remember him taking me to the service for the\nfirst born, I think at six o\u2019clock in the morning, I guess when I was about seven or\neight years old. I only have one memory of doing it, but that stays in my memory\nbank.",
        "A: Well, we always -- oh, by the way, our -- oh, we lived about one block from the\nTemple -- rather, the synagogue. I particularly always remembered -- sh -- oh --\n ,September 24, 2003",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: In -- no --",
        "A: The [indecipherable]",
        "A: Where the old age home, which was right next to the Temple, always had a\nSukkor and a had sweets for the kids, and that was of particular interest. We al-\nalso always had, obviously Passover, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur. I remember\nthe Temple. The women sat in a balcony, but 1t wasn\u2019t closed. There was no\ncurtain. It also had music in terms of the boy\u2019s choir, conducted -- and I still\nremember him, by Lira Fleischer, who is also the head of the Jewish school,\nbecause the public school became closed in 1933, before I started, and the Jewish\ncommunity had four classrooms within the school, where the instruction took\nplace. The main negative I remember, and this was after 1936, was we had to\nleave the school grounds -- or not the school grounds, but the classrooms during\nlunch period. And we more or less had to draw a fine line of being in the\nschoolyard, between the boys and the girls which were separated, because there\nwere fights and so forth and it became more and more dangerous to be in the\n5September 24, 2003\nschoolyard. Toward 1937 - \u201938, we were dismissed five minutes earlier so that we\ncould be away from the grounds by the time school was open, so that we could get\nhome safely.",
        "A: I just realized I had to be careful. I was given quite a bit of independence. I was\nable to ride my bicycle wherever it was in town. In fact, when the public\nswimming pools were closed in 1936, at that time I was seven, there was an old\nrock quarry which had water in it, kind of a small lake, which became the Jewish\npool probably about three, four miles out of the city. And friends of mine and I\nused to regularly bicycle out there and as long as we weren\u2019t in groups, we didn\u2019t\nfeel particularly vulnerable.",
        "A: They were all Jewish. In other words, we had no contact with the regular\nschool teachers. I remember my first gir -- first -- I went through first, second and\nthird grades, and it was strictly -- it was a German curriculum, but we had our own\nschool within the school. Upper Silesia had been protected by a treaty covering\n6September 24, 2003\nminorities when parts of the area were given to Poland, and therefore, during the\ntransition minorities were protected, the German minorities were protected in\nPoland and any other minorities were also protected in Germany. So that the\neffects of the Nazi government really started in 1936 when Der Stiirmer was at\nevery street corner. Der Sttiirmer was the anti-Semitic paper published by\nGoebbels and they had them behind glass for the public to read, virtually\neverywhere. I also recall that in beginning of 1936, my parents insisted that I\nimmediately take swimming lessons and be able to pass a swimming test of 20\nminutes, because it may be necessary to take an ocean voyage. When I was afraid\nof the test at the time, I remember my grandfather went with me and said, I\u2019m not\nleaving until you do it, because the pool 1s going to be closed very soon and I want\nyou to be a competent swimmer. And that was bef -- before the summer of \u00b036.\nDuring the time when the treaty was over, everybody was afraid of riots and there\nwere some broken windows and similar things. My parents had the foresight to\ntake a vacation in Bornholm, which is an island in the n -- nor -- the Baltic Sea,\nwhi -- during these times, and when we returned the atmosphere changed pretty\nsubstantially. In other words, the so-called treaty expired and the community\ncaught up with the rest of the country in a few weeks.\n7September 24, 2003",
        "A: I was pretty aware. I was never particularly fearful. I think I have very good\nnerves and that goes back to those days, I just learned to kind of mind my own\nbusiness and do whatever I wanted to. I had no real limitations except what I\nmentioned for school. In 1937, after my mother had taken a trip to Israel in --\nactually, I think late \u00b035, and determined that a doctor had no chance of making a\nliving in Israel, my parents decided I\u2019d better take English lessons and I remember\nI had an English teacher and I did this probably about once or twice a week.",
        "A: It was not a -- it was not taught in school.",
        "A: German. Upper Silesia was strictly a German area. We did not -- people here\nwere surprised that we did not speak any Yiddish, because Yiddish 1s really\nmedieval German which combined with the local dialects. And since the language\nof our area was German, there was no -- it didn\u2019t stay stagnant and didn\u2019t get\nmixed with any other language, so that it wasn\u2019t used.\n8September 24, 2003",
        "A: Yes. In other words, the philosophy of my parents was that they were Germans,\nbut happened to be Jewish. Like we\u2019re Americans, but religiously we\u2019re Jewish.",
        "A: Not particularly. In other words, except that I did go to a Jewish school and\nafter 1936, we couldn\u2019t go to movies or other children\u2019s activities, and it -- were\nrestricted to certain areas. I remember among the safer playgrounds was an\norganization which was the non-zia -- the co-community was pretty much divided\nbetween Zionists and non-Zionists. The non-Zionits-nists being called the Schild,\nor Shield Organization. And there was an old -- there was a mansion pretty close\nto the middle of town, which served as our playground, and that was a nice place\nto meet and of course, at that point we only played with Jewish kids. My parents\nalso shared what was called a Schrebergarten, which is a piece of land set aside a\nlittle bit at the ed -- kind of at the edge of town, into garden plots, where we had\nfruit trees and [indecipherable]. It was shared by about 10 families. And that was\na place where we could safely congregate and that was actually a private parcel,\nwhich was our other playground in summer. In winter the Schild building was a\nplace where we could go inside. The Temple really was just for worshipping.\nThere was no Sunday school, as such.\n9September 24, 2003",
        "A: Wi -- a -- a little bit of Hebrew. Not very much because I was -- it was too early\nto prepare for Bar Mitzvah. I was nine years old when I left, and --",
        "A: We did pretty much -- we knew what -- what our limitations were, but within\nthat -- I don\u2019t think I was, as I said, particularly either worried, scared in an\neveryday way and we just continued to do what was pretty much what we wanted.\nBut there were limitations of things. We knew what not to do.",
        "A: Oh, everybody played kind of sandlot soccer. That was probably the main\ngame. That was about the only one because anything that would be more formal\nwas really prohibited because you couldn't go to parks, you couldn\u2019t go to places\nwhere that existed.",
        "A: Very, very little.",
        "A: Just no contact. We minded our business and that was it.\n10September 24, 2003",
        "A: I don\u2019t really remember any contact with neighbors because living in an\napartment building, we were in the first floor. Therefore -- the f -- no, wait a mo --\nfir -- it was actually the second floor. There were stores on the bottom. The first\nfloor is what the Europeans call the f -- one flight up. And I didn\u2019t pass anybody\nexcept when I went out. So we had the whole floor. Our apartment had four\nbedrooms plus an office, so that I\u2019d have people over, we stopped using the\nplayground area in the apartment, because was considered a good idea. But there\nwere enough things to do that I didn\u2019t consider myself deprived.",
        "A: Yes, yes. I had -- I felt I had just about everything that -- I wasn\u2019t missing\nanything.",
        "A: Probably trains. I had my -- I had model trains from as long as I can remember,\nand in fact, when we were ready to leave Germany, my grandfather gave me two\npresents. One was an HO gauge, which was new at that time. That was the small\ngauge model train, which could be set up on a table, that in case we were in a\nsmall apartment, 1t would fit on our dining room table. The other thing I got was a\ngolden watch for my Bar Mitzvah when I would have it, wherever we were.\n11September 24, 2003",
        "A: No, no. My mother had a couple of miscarriages and I was an only child.",
        "A: We were not affected by that. In other words, due to the treaty, what the\nboycott was in the rest of Germany, 1936 was in -- was when it hit Upper Silesia.",
        "A: As far as memories is concerned, the only thing I -- I do remember my father\u2019s\nparents had a small hardware store, again on the main square, and I remember\ntheir house, which was above the store and I realize they did not have -- they only\nhad one area in the kitchen with running water, and for washing they still took a\nbasin with a jug for the hot water. So this must have been around 1934, because\nmy grandmother died of a stroke in 1935, after which my grandfather closed up\nthe store and moved to Gleiwitz to be near my parents.",
        "A: It was -- it didn\u2019t affect us, therefore a lot of -- a-also, my father didn\u2019t lose his\nhospital privileges until 1936. Many other physicians left Berlin, for instance in\n12September 24, 2003\n1933 and 1934, because after the boycott, they saw the handwriting on the wall. It\ndidn\u2019t show up til much later in Silesia, so that it also had the fact that fewer\npeople really saw the urgency of leaving.",
        "A: Mainly that we couldn't go into certain stores and that we more or less were\ngiven maps of what we could and what we couldn\u2019t do. But it didn\u2019t stop our\nmovement, but rather, there are just certain things which one doesn\u2019t do.",
        "A: And we took it in that sense, that same as parents said you don\u2019t -- you don\u2019t\ncross the main street.",
        "A: Just that as si -- that it wasn't safe and that there are en-enough things for me to\ndo without it.",
        "A: Probably quite early, because it was on every stamp, it was on every\ngovernment -- government building, but it was taken as something that -- that\nexisted, but didn\u2019t have the same connotations --",
        "A: -- that we see now, of -- that it was a serious threat. And, in fact, most people\n13September 24, 2003\nfelt it would blow over and wouldn\u2019t last, particularly my mother\u2019s parents, who\nhad celebrated the hundredth anniversary of a wholesale leather business with a\ntannery in 1933, and survived in very good shape through the hunger of World\nWar I, when they could always barter leather for food at the local -- from the local\nfarmers. And felt they were pretty much immune from anything that would\nhappen. They really didn\u2019t appreciate what ha -- what was going on until\nKristallnacht.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Probably around 1935, because one did listen to speeches and the fact that he\nwas able to arouse almost riotous reactions, and people started talking about what\nwas going to happen next. Again, wa -- how political is a five year old, and I\ncouldn\u2019t really absorb what was going on in the same way as my parents, who\nobviously were quite concerned, as I said, whether it\u2019s a ocean voyage, learning\nEnglish and so forth. That became pretty clear even before the end of the treaty,\n14September 24, 2003\nand I\u2019d say around 1935. By the time I started school, which was in 1935, it was\nalready fully segregated and I just thought that\u2019s the way it had to be.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No. No, it\u2019s -- they were always su -- very supportive of Zionism, mainly as a\nrefuge, and especially after the conclusion that a doctor couldn't make a living,\nthey eliminated the thought of moving to Palestine as one of the possibilities,\npretty early.",
        "A: No, there were no problems with food except there were certain regulations,\nthat on certain days -- I believe it was Friday or Thursdays, you had to do\neverything in one part in order to conserve fuel and I really don\u2019t know if these\nwere restricted -- restrictive laws for the Jewish community, or for everybody. Oh,\none other comment, which I think it interesting. The synagogue covered all\ndegrees of religious activities, from what we would say very Orthodox to quite\nReform. And there was only one synagogue. However, virtually all of the families\nbought from the kosher butcher, because he couldn\u2019t make a living on only the\n15September 24, 2003\npeople who were kosher. Consequently, we ate kosher food as a mitzvah for the\nrest of the community.",
        "A: We drove and I had my -- I once got caught with my scooter, and -- by my\nSunday school teacher, who objected, but I wasn\u2019t punished for it. And it\u2019s really a\nquestion of what is work in Biblical times, compared to what is work today, so I\nhave no strong feelings on the subject.",
        "A: Yes, in fact for many years while my grandparents were still in Boyton, we\nalways went there for Friday night. My father had bought a car in 1933, which was\na major luxury at that time, was a convertible. Something like a VW convertible,\nexcept smaller. And every Friday night we would go to Boyton, which is -- as I\nsaid, it\u2019s about 20 miles away, and be at my grandmother\u2019s for dinner. And one of\nthe foods which I happened to have liked, which my kids could never understand,\nwas a liver soup. But she made a very good one.",
        "A: I would say most of the ones we had we learned from the maids, which were\n16September 24, 2003\nmo -- almost semi-Nazi songs. Bu -- rather war -- not Nazi, generally, but warlike,\nabout a comrade and things like this and [indecipherable]",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Yes. I had a comrade -- I mean, I\u2019m translating it -- we marched together in\nstep. Then a bullet came flying, I didn\u2019t know if it -- would it be meant for me or\nfor him? It was meant for him. He was tr -- he was shot down, he\u2019s lying on my\nfeet. I mean these ca -- and all kinds of militaristic th-things about the German\nforests and tha -- the songs were very nationalistic. Like -- almost like the army\nsongs that we learned here from the academies. Over hill, over dale, at -- and\netcetera.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what they knew or did anything else, but that was -- that\u2019s also\nwhat you heard on the radio. So that was almost pop culture. And I still remember\nquite a few of them.",
        "A: Like over hill, over dale, what was it? Just a second. [speaks German here]. In\nother words, hello, hello, what -- we\u2019re -- we\u2019re driving -- we\u2019re driving into the\n17September 24, 2003\nworld. Kind of suggesting the world is our oyster.

        "A: First of all, my grandfather was a genealogist and when he -- when my father\nwere thinking of the United States, he looked up relatives. There were a couple of\nother relatives who had left and he gave em -- as I said before, he traced the family\nback to pretty early times. During my father\u2019s trip finally to the United States to\ntry to find affidavits for the family and the affidavit being to guarantee that\nwhoever comes over will not be on welfare, and would be supported for a year, he\nfou -- he sent my father to Philadelphia to check the grates records.\nUnfortunately --",

And we therefore booked in October, in order to pack what had -- d-deci\n-- my mother had to decide what belongings to take along. At that time we could\nstill pack what was called the lift, which is a container which, providing a tax was\npaid for the hundred percent value of whatever you\u2019re taking out. So that we did\ntake most of our furniture that was pack-able, most of my father\u2019s office\nequipment.

But that was necessary but quite dangerous and that was for bare\nsubsistence. Also, we went first class on the ship because you could pay for it in\nGerman money and first class pa -- allowed -- allowed you amount of spending\nmoney per person.

And when my mother called the hospital, a colleague of\nmy father, with whom they had -- not socialized, but with whom they had had\ndinner at various times in the early 30\u2019s, said I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t treat Jewish\nchildren, I can\u2019t help you.

        "A: That -- no, that -- that was after -- I believe that was after Crystal Night. Oh,\none other incident. During the month of September, we got cable after cable from\nmy father to go on an earlier ship. We really didn\u2019t know why, because there was\nalmost complete censorship on what was going on at Munich, and that Hitler had\ncalled back the Europa, on which we were scheduled to sail from Cherbourg, as\na wharf rat. And when we finally arri -- ar -- my mother couldn\u2019t get an earlier\nsailing because it was -- it wa -- it was booked, and we needed to take a German\n25September 24, 2003\nship in order to take money out and to be able to pay in German money. When we\narrived in Bremen there was no ship. It was then that we found out that it was -- it\nlost, originally, two days, of which it had made up one, due to being called back.\nAnd the next day it arrived and we left one day late. And that was the first time I\nsaw my uncles cry, because he took us to the ship. That was my mother\u2019s brother,\nWalter. We had a pretty rough sailing, it was hurricane season and I was pretty\nmuch alone on the ship, most times, watching the bow go under the wav -- go into\nthe waves. But my mother I think, had partly a breakdown from all the strain and\npartly was seasick. We had a couple of other rather scary incidents. In the packing\n-- quote unquote friends said they wanted to help by packing my bicycle in a box\nand preparing it to use the least possible space. And they delivered the bicycle to\nus and it was packed, and -- with all the other things. And they had -- when we\npacked our bags, they had a customs inspector check all of the luggage to see that\nnothing illegal went in and put a seal on it. When we arrived on the ship, all the\nseals were broken open by the Gestapo, to check on the customs officials, because\nthe customs official said yes, I\u2019m going out for lunch now, don\u2019t touch anything.\nAnd -- but my mother didn\u2019t take any chances and left things copacetta.\n26September 24, 2003",
        "A: By that time they were pretty scary and you just kept out of their way. My\nfather had quite an incident with an armed Gestapo coming into his office. As a\nresult of the -- there\u2019s a tra -- the way that you have a long term lease in -- or had a\nlong term lease in Germany, you gave a mortgage to the landlord, so it\u2019s basically\nyou lent him money. And for that it was a long term lease. When we decided to\nleave, he -- the landlord had to pay back the mortgage. And that was tra -- ordered\ntransferred to my father\u2019s bank account from the landlord\u2019s bank account.\nSomebody at the landlord\u2019s bank called the Gestapo that a large sum of money 1s\nbeing transferred to Dr. Liebermann, and consequently the two agents came in --\ninto the office while somebody was there and said we\u2019re here to arrest you. And he\nsaid, for what cause? You withdrew a large amount of money. I said, excuse me,\nthis was transferred to my account at such and such bank, which 1s frozen. I\nsuggest you call the bank. It\u2019s daytime.

But I accepted that.",
        "A: My father was at the dock. He splurged -- we had a room at the Hotel Taft for\nthree days, and then took the New York Central to Cleveland.",
        "A: Oh great, great. And in th -- Cleveland he rented one room -- one bedroom\napartment near Cain Park where I slept in the Murphy bed. That was my\nintroduction to the United States. And on the first Thursday we had a feast. We\nbought -- there was a deli downstairs and he bought a corned beef sandwich and a\nloaf of bread. And that was the first notaful American meal -- th-th -- the\nAmerican meal that I got. We had one other funny incident, we had a German\nsuper, who -- and I remember my parents commented that he spoke terrible\nEnglish and terrible German, saying in other words something was wr-wrong with\n30September 24, 2003\nthe faucet and th -- who answered [speaks German here]. In other words, I\u2019Il fix\nit for you, in other words sil -- and I remember my mother saying gee, I hope we\u2019ll\nbe able to learn at least one lang -- to speak one language well. They -- my parents\nwent out the first time, I remember -- I believe it was a Saturday, they went out to\na movie, and I believe it was -- it was a night of Kristallnacht, or rather the -- at\nthree o\u2019clock in the morning on -- and they had left somebody in the next\napartment to look after -- t-to look in on me. And I know -- and I remember\ngetting a call, a desperate call from my grandparents to talk to my mother, that the\ntwo brothers had been arrested and I think everything was -- and I just took\nmessages, who the operator was, and when they came back, the world changed. So\nthat was -- I said -- they got through to them and from that time on there was a --\nfirst of a -- the primary objective was still, the state boards were in December. And\nright after the state boards, after he got notice that he passed, which was, I think\nthe end of December, he had arranged to go to Philadelphia. Somebody had been\nrecommended, a professor at Hanneman. He wanted to learn American meth --\nmethods. That was a fraternity brother. He said, why don\u2019t you go there, and he\ndid that -- he wa -- he was at the pe -- their house, and he was particularly nice.\nAnd as he was leaving, he said, by the way, you mentioned that this Dr.\nSeiderman recommended me and I really don\u2019t know, who is he? So it turned out\n31September 24, 2003\nthat this colleague of his, a fraternity brother, basically wanted to get him out of\nCleveland because he shared an office with an ear, nose, throat surgeon. So he\nmade the suggestion that Dayton would be a good spot. And even though it wasn\u2019t\nwell meant, it turned out to be a very, very good recommendation, because it was -\n- there was no -- the reason he went there was that there was no Jewish ear, nose,\nthroat doctor in Dayton, but [indecipherable] he built up a very successful\npractice, partly with the help of the medical society in vetoing his admission by\npassing an expos facto law on a Friday night, sometime 1 -- after he made the\napplication requiring citizenship. Somebody leaked that to the newspaper and the\nDayton Herald, to which he was eternally grateful, had a Sunday editorial on\nfreedom of opportunity in the United States. And the following Monday he had\n11 new patients. So that was -- what do they generally say -- so anyway, the next\nMonday he had 11 new patients and that really established his practice. And oddly\nenough, his main practice was not Jewish. In other words, he was fair -- a fairly\nbrusque individual and -- who said what he wanted and didn\u2019t have the be-bedside\nmanners for Jewish pa -- that some Jewish patients preferred. By the way, another\nside. After the war, he was the recipient of the 75\" anniversary award for\ninternational HIAS, for his resettlement efforts. He gave over a hundred affidavits\n32September 24, 2003\npersonally, to sponsor people after World War II. He received that together with\nPresident Truman, and I think three others.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, when he went to Philadelphia, before going to Philadelphia -- oh, first\nof all, they fi -- they all wanted to leave at that point. In other words, they realized\nthat it was much more serious than they had believed at first. And he -- they made\nevery effort to try to get help. On the way to Philadelphia he stopped to see\nCharlie Marcus. And by the way, we had bought him a large crystal ass -- ashtray\nas a matter of thanks when we arrived. But on his second visit he said he can\u2019t take\nany more responsibility and it was my parent\u2019s belief that this was a little bit too\nclose. In other words, my father was once removed. My grandfather -- now it\u2019s --\nthey had -- he may want repayment for the debt, and he said he can\u2019t take any\nmore responsibility. This was, by the way, a man who filed, with the affidavit, his\nincome tax return of 1938 of 38,000 dollars. So I just say that for perspective. You\nknow what 38,000 dollars was in 1938. They did --\n33September 24, 2003",

He was able to get an exit visa for him and he got\nsick on the way to the ship, and was taken directly to te -- Theresienstadt and\nnever got out. My mother\u2019s brothers were finally booked in 1940 on an Italian ship\nto Shanghai, which left, I think on the day of the breakthrough of the Maginot\nLine, which caused Italy to declare war on Britain and France, and the ship had\nto turn back because it didn\u2019t get through the Suez Canal. And that was the\nbrother that took us to the ship and my mother\u2019s other -- his twin, and his wife and\nfour year old daughter. My mother also had a younger brother, who was 11 years\nyounger, who was running constantly to Berlin to try to get every embassy for\nvisas. And at the age of something like 19, unfortunately was not successful. We\nnever knew whether it was a question of age or just that they were hitting their\nheads against a wall. But the next thing we heard that they were t-taken to\nTheresienstadt, I believe in 1941. And they had been married by Leo Baeck, who\nwas ara -- the rabbi in Opin before he moved to Berlin. After the war, my mother\ncontacted him when he visited Cincinnati. And he confirmed that they had been\nsent to Auschwitz in 1944.\n34September 24, 2003",

If anyone in the family couldn\u2019t make a living, he could open a\nleather business and get credit. And he just felt that he would be able to survive\nfrom his previous experience.

And of course I still vividly remember the speech of a day that wi-will\nlive in infamy. And that of course almost totally prevented any further contact\nwith the family, because the only mail that could go out was through Spain, or th -\n- through Portugal, up to that tor -- while Germany was ada -- rather, before\nDecember seventh. After that, all communication except the Red Cross, stopped.\n41September 24, 2003\nSo those -- that started a period of no communications that I really don\u2019t know\nhow my mother survived it. But I guess both parents were pretty strong people.",
        "A: And she was just keeping busy. That\u2019s why I say, with volunteer organizations,\nshe decided to help in the office and it was pretty close to where we lived, so that\nwhen I came home -- she always had lunch for me and came home after school.\nAnd we really adapted very quickly to life in Dayton. In 1941 -- first of all in\n1940 I felt very privileged, we got a car, which was up to that point my father\ncould -- did -- commuted to the hospital by bus, because again, every dollar was\nextremely precious. I remember getting the car, getting the first glimpse of the\ncountry, and we took our first vacation in the Smokies that August. I was a boy\nscout and did all the basic activities that one is supposed to do and I felt very\ncomfortable, and had no problems getting used to the community.",
        "A: The one thing which we were laughing about is that I went to camp, I\ndeveloped hay fever, and when I -- I went to camp when I was 11 and I was able\nto take my folding camera. When I was 12, I became an enemy alien and we had\nto register as enemy aliens. And technically we\u2019re not allowed to get out of the\n42September 24, 2003\ncountry -- get out of the -- Montgomery county, which was Dayton, Ohio\u2019s\ncounty, without permission from the authorities. And basically we were laughing\nabout it. In other words, I as an 11 year old was free to travel, my parents weren\u2019t.\nBut --",
        "A: Not until I turned 12.",
        "A: That was in 1940 -- 1942 [indecipherable]",
        "A: We were laughing about it, because there was no place to go anyway. There\nwere travel restrictions, gasoline rationing. So what\u2019s the difference? But these\nother -- you -- you have to -- you have to laugh at anything that\u2019s funny.\nOtherwise, of course everybody -- we went through all the things which were done\nduring World War II. We were encouraged to ge -- to get Jo -- when we were in\nhigh school we were encouraged to get jobs to replace people. I worked in a\nclothing store for 35 cents an hour. But it -- there were such shortages and they\ndidn't -- I mean, my mother packed a lunch which was probably worth about two\nhours -- two or three hours work. But it gave everybody a sense of\naccomplishment, and my father regularly volunteered to give physicals, I think\n43September 24, 2003\ntwice a week at the recruitment center and every -- everybody pitched in and\nWorld War II was unique that it was -- got everybody\u2019s hundred percent -- it was a\nmoral war that everybody supported.",

I still na -- I still know all the reporters, and you basically pu -- could\nput everything together and it looked pretty bleak for awhile, but I think we\nquickly absorbed American optimism.",
        "A: We knew it was bad, but there was a sense of helplessness. I remember the\nepisode with the Saint Louis, which was absolutely unbelievable, that -- we\nworshipped Roosevelt, who at the same time was such a political animal that he\nwould do anything to -- basically do what he felt was politically expedient. And of\ncourse, it\u2019s easy to say that in retrospect, but at the time, it couldn\u2019t be done.\nWhether it was a bombing of the rail lines, and -- or the camps.\n44September 24, 2003",
        "A: Well, we knew about Dachau very er -- early on. Dachau was established\nbefore 1938. I was absolutely flabbergasted when I looked at the map, to see how\nclose Auschwitz was to Gleiwitz, and when we were back there, I took that one\nday trip into the area from czechsla -- from the Czech Republic, and when I\nlooked at the map I was flabbergasted. In fact, I had a very interesting -- got a very\ninteresting letter from the Holocaust Museum last week, forwarding a letter that\nthey received from Gleiwitz that in -- the local organization in Gleiwitz has -- I\nforgot the exact name, something for international relations, is going to dedicate a\nmemorial to the Jewish community, at the site of the synagogue. When I was there\nseven years ago, it was a rundown playground with asphalt and not a plaque,\nnothing. And the Jewish old age home became a police station. After that visit,\neverything else was pretty much unchanged, but I couldn\u2019t wait to get out and they\n-- now got notice that they\u2019re dedicating a memorial on the site of the synagogue\nand that the dedication is going to be on the 28\" and 29\" of October. And my wife\nand I and my three kids, and Joe and his family are going there for the dedication.\nAlso visiting Berlin, which I understand has a new Jewish museum. And I feel I\nwant to show the kids our roots, and I also want to show the people who are doing\nthis that it\u2019s about time. That\u2019s [indecipherable]. In fact, when I wrote the letter\nof acceptance that we\u2019re all coming, and I mentioned the European titles, that all\n45September 24, 2003\nmy children are being doctors and lawyers, all have the European titles as doctors,\nthat we\u2019re coming and that I hope the visit will be a very productive and\nmemorable experience for all of us and them. And that\u2019s the reason I feel strongly\nabout going. I si -- it still hasn\u2019t been determined whether they\u2019re financing it, but\nI\u2019m willing to finance it, because I think it 1s for a good cause, even though a\ncouple of my kids disagree.",
        "A: Apparently yes. I don\u2019t know what the language barrier is going to be. But the\nhead of the organization writes perfect English, so knowing that most schools are\nbilingual, we should be able to communicate to some extent, although when we\nwere there seven years ago in Opin, that\u2019s the town where my mother was born,\nwhere I found the apartment where the business was and also where the Temple\nwas, which is now a Russian style office building, I couldn\u2019t communicate in\neither English or German. And when we went to a restaurant, we finally pointed to\nthe table next to us, where they had soup and a sandwich, and that\u2019s how we ate\nlunch. So it should be an interesting experience.\n46September 24, 2003",

        "A: Because that was their way of making up for the family that was lost, that\nphilosophically our feeling is, you can\u2019t replace what\u2019s lost, but you can better\nwhat can be replaced.",
        "A: No. We stopped speaking German probably within six months. But of course\nwe all spoke with an accent, and I do not have very -- I am [indecipherable]\ngraphic and picture person and I do not have very much language talent.\nTherefore, I never heard the difference. And that\u2019s the only way I can explain the\nfact that I reta -- I retain my accent after 65 years.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s when everything unfolded and the realization came that nobody\ncould be traced. In other words, it was finalized by Leo Baeck, which must have\nbeen in the late 40\u2019s or early 50\u2019s when he came here.

        "A: Very -- a lot of interests, yes. I consider myself a reasonably good student. I\nparticipated in various clubs, a lot -- mostly political. And I guess it shaped me\nalso in a fairly liberal philosophy that Jews have always prospered in any fu --\nliberal society, and it\u2019s important that everybody has the rights that they\u2019re entitled\nto because it rubs off. And I still thi -- I travel a lot, being that it\u2019s my business, but\nI still kiss the ground every time we come home, whether I agree with policies or\nnot.",

        "A: She lived in Kew Gardens, New York and I lived in Ohio, but I went to\nWestern Reserve in Cleveland and she went to Syracuse. And the distance to\nSyracuse was quite a bit shor -- shorter from Cleveland. That was kind of little bit\nbetter than halfway. So it was doable.",

And they came here -- they wen -- their name is Simon,\nmaybe they had Jewish roots somewhere, but they definitely were not, and they\nlived on the Main Line in Philadelphia. And they came over in the same ship as I\ndid, one sailing earlier, the one that was -- that was sent back during Munich.

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Some, but their roots really were in the general community, both Jewish and\nnon-Jewish. In other words, we tended not to be cliquish and believed\nphilosophically in being fully integrated. To me it was a step backwards to move\nto Great Neck, which is kind of a gilded ghetto, and I prefer Washington for that.\n51September 24, 2003",
        "A: I\u2019ve been -- let me answer it in a different way. I\u2019ve met a fairly substantial\nnumber of Germans and I confront the history. I feel that the Holocaust is\nprobably almost as much part of the German psyche as it 1s the Jewish psyche.\nI\u2019ve also noticed that the -- by the numbers that come to the Holocaust Museum. I\nfeel ve had a much, much richer life in the United States than I ever would have\nhad in Gleiwitz, even if it hadn\u2019t -- there hadn\u2019t been a war or Holocaust. So I\nsometimes use a statement in speaking to Germans, the best revenge 1s living well.\nAnd I believe in that philosophy and I think our children reflect it, that the\nopportunities, I\u2019m talking about cultural and otherwise, that we\u2019ve had in New\nYork and Washington are far greater than anything we could have experienced in\nUpper Silesia in the best of times.",
        "A: We sent them to Sunday school. I\u2019m a great believer that the two most\nimportant things you give your children are roots and wings. And they all not only\nwent through Confirmation class, but they all went through post-Confirmation\n52September 24, 2003\nclass in order to be rooted not only Jewish religion, but Jewish philosophy.

Herrairi in Baghdad. And when I\nwrote a letter and signed my name, my boss said, this is something you have to\nchange immediately. And he signed just initials and make a scribble and you never\nput any name, just initials, that we can tell whom -- who you are, and then I just --\nit was easier to be Frank because it\u2019s a common name, people remember it better,\nand I had no trouble doing it.",

        "A: Oh definitely. Again, we believe in -- we believe in studying and in the Jewish\nphilosophy that you really -- in 0 -- in order to defend yourself, you have to know\nwho you are. And probably the people who fared least well in the Holocaust were\nthose who really didn\u2019t know who they were. In other words, even the ones who\nconverted were considered Jews. And they didn\u2019t have the background to deal\nwith it. And I would say this is one of the things I learned from the Holocaust.",
        "A: No, not really at that age, but I know that my children persuaded my mother to\nwrite her autobiography, because they wanted their sense of history.\nUnfortunately, it was fairly late and we had to do a lot of editing because she\nwrote a lot of notes originally. And I want to thank my daughter-in-law, who did a\nwonderful job on the computer in putting her various stories together in a logical\n55September 24, 2003\nway, which became difficult at the time she did it, which was probably in her mid-\n80\u2019s.",

Basi -- as I say, I confront Germans at\nvarious times and I feel you can\u2019t undo history, but you have to ta -- you have to\nlearn from it. This is one reason why -- my wife managed to get me tickets for the\nconsecration of the Holocaust Museum on that rainy, cold, miserable day, when\nthere wasn\u2019t a seat to be had in the part that was roped off for people who wanted\nto bear witness, while in front, the part that was left for the dignitaries was half\nempty. It\u2019s also wa -- why, when I had a chance, I volunteered at the museum,\nbecause I feel I can convey a message and I\u2019m glad to be doing it. My kids are\nvery much aware of their roots, and that\u2019s a reason why they are going on the trip\nnext month, because I said we be -- as a family believe in roots and wings.\n56September 24, 2003",
        "A: Not at all. Look, we made the best of a bad situation. We were very fortunate.\nMy father\u2019s good fortune was that he lost his living relatively early in 1936, and\nthat he had the foresight to leave. My father-in-law, who left Vienna, said you\nknow, his good luck was that he was not too old or too rich. Either of those\ncircumstances made many people victims.",

Moving to\na strange country is extremely hard. But once you do it and succeed, I feel I could\nnot have had the life that I\u2019ve had, if we had stayed, forgetting about the politics\nand everything else that occurred. So, I\u2019m certainly not angry, but I\u2019m trying to be\nconstructive.",

And therefore, I think there\u2019s a reason why Jews tend\nto be liberal in their own self interest. And some of the trends we have th -- do\nworry me, because we don\u2019t seem to be getting our message across as well as we\ndid in former years. In other words, I\u2019m not -- when -- even when Senator\nLieberman mentions God too often, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s -- that belongs in politics.\nNow, one of the things that made things so easy for the Germans is that the\nchurches and synagogues were fun-funded by the state. In other words, you gave a\n58September 24, 2003\ncertain part of your taxes to go to the church of your choice. And therefore, they\nhad complete records of what everybody was and thought, whether they were with\nthem inic -- or against them. And I therefore don\u2019t like some of the trends that we\nsee now in fighting terrorism, of invading civil liberties.

At this point I believe it\u2019s here to stay, it\u2019s -- when the\nwhole world closed, if we had had a State of Israel, that wouldn\u2019t have happened.\n59September 24, 2003\nPhilosophically, I think the Likud policy of trying to presser -- of the occupied\nterritories 1s contrary to Jewish la -- to Jewish law and contrary to Jewish interests,\nbecause they\u2019re trying to create a South Africa, where we have -- you can\u2019t be a\nreligious state where some people are more equal than others. And there is merit in\n-- if you want to have a Jewish state, it has to be pretty much limited to the Jewish\npopulation and you can\u2019t be Imperialist. Because strictly on basis of the increased\nbirthrate, if they carry it on the way it was done in Lebanon, where it used to be\n50-50, and then you had a ruling minority, that is poison for stability.

        "A: Not really. No, I have no -- I am -- I am past the point of being emotionally\nrepressive or -- in other words, I -- I handle it in an unemotional way now. Even\nthough when I gave the lecture and put it all together, at the end I was tearful.",
        "A: At Madera. That was --",
        "A: -- that was draining.",
        "A: Yes.\n64September 24, 2003",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. But, let\u2019s see, I keep on living and try to make the most of it.",
        "A: The one that really got me -- oh, sh -- one second, I turn it off [tape break] --\nnot re -- the one that I got -- probably was most emotional about was the present\nexhibit on the children.",
        "A: Yes. And the last ti -- wa -- again, when I was emotional is in \u201cSchindler\u2019s\nList\u201d when they lead the children away. That\u2019s something that I can\u2019t come to\nterms with, and I think of my cousin, who when we left she was three years old.",
        "A: Who did not survive. I mean, none of the children survived.",
        "A: No, no, no. I mean, I identify as what happened to -- children were totally\nhelpless and -- and I would sa -- it\u2019s probably -- that\u2019s the only pogrom that\u2019s di --\nthat really -- attacked the children first. From a phils -- philosophical way of\ndestroying the community.\n65September 24, 2003",
        "A: Good. I have no -- I mean, I like some better than others. Some people you\nrelate to, that\u2019s normal.",
        "A: Not really. We don\u2019t have time.",
        "A: Again, I look strictly as people. I don\u2019t have any -- no more -- I usually ask\nwhere people are from, whether they\u2019re from Ohio or New Zealand and places\nthat I\u2019ve been to. From the museum, that\u2019s more interesting.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: I think it\u2019s -- I think it\u2019s quite important that I sometimes do ask, if I\u2019m the\nsurvi -- actually, I don\u2019t consider myself a survivor, because my parents with their\ngood fortune got me out before \u201938, or during \u00b038 and I really had a minimum of\n66September 24, 2003\ntrauma. But by being represented as somebody who 1s authentic, I think it adds to\nthe experience of people at the museum, and I do get asked.",
        "A: Whether I was a survivor. And I say yes, even though I don\u2019t believe it myself.\nIn other words, the category of survivor is somebody who really went through\nsome of the hell which happened after Crystal Night.",
        "A: I think it\u2019s a fabulous piece of architecture. In other words, the somewhat\ndisjointed look is, I think, a marvelous achievement. People often ask me, you\nknow, about the map that they give out. And I said, it really doesn\u2019t help because\npeople didn\u2019t know from one moment to the next what\u2019s going to happen. So you\ncan\u2019t put that in a map. That\u2019s my standard comment.",
        "A: Yes. In other words, I feel that somewhere I can contribute more than I\nprobably could elsewhere.",
        "A: Ah, I do not tend to be that emotional. In other words, I appreciate the\nhappenings and I -- I try to ra -- I try to believe in reason over emotion. Not that I\n67September 24, 2003\ndon\u2019t get emotional, but this is not -- I don\u2019t have the connection that way, except I\nthink that it -- that it\u2019s an important part of education and I have taken -- I\u2019ve\ninvited -- for instance, I\u2019ve invited my kids and grandchildren to the celebration of\nsurvivors, November first. And I think that\u2019s important. But from an educational\npoint of view, rather than a strict emotional point of view.",
        "A: They again -- 1t depends which ones. Some of them are strictly business, others\nare really devoted. And also in th -- among the volunteers are some non-Jewish\nvolunteers. You don\u2019t know what reasons people have for reacting. So-Some of\nthem take it strictly they\u2019ve had experience in museums and it\u2019s a museum job.\nOthers do it because they feel it -- it\u2019s particularly important. And both kinds of\npeople are useful. No other comments.",
        "A: I don\u2019t have time, because I leave there and go directly to work. If they have\nsomething in the evening, preferably on weekends, it\u2019s much easier than during\nthe week. Course I -- I get home around quarter to six. By the time I have dinner\nduring the week, that\u2019s -- that makes for a long day -- we -- and we go to the\ntheater a lot in the weekends and have cond -- all kinds of subscriptions. It\u2019s -- you\ncan only do so much.\n68September 24, 2003",
        "A: Again, they have all been very educational, whether it\u2019s bringing up the book\nburning and the intellectual philosophy of race superiority and so forth, which was\npopular in -- throughout the world, it was just taking that to an extreme. And I say\none of the -- one of the things that\u2019s unbelievable about the Nazi movement is the\nhigh emotional pitch that it could get to. And that\u2019s such a danger sign that it still\nhasn\u2019t been explained to me. In other words, how the political rallies can be so\ndevastating. On so -- so-called educated people. That\u2019s the reason I tr -- I try to be\nunemotional.",
        "A: Yes. You said it in different words.",
        "A: I wish it really had, but the fact that it\u2019s recognized hopefully will be helpful.\nWe probably won\u2019t know for another two or three generations.\n69September 24, 2003",
        "A: Unless you lear -- unless you study history, you can repeat mistakes. That\u2019s the\nreason I\u2019ve been -- i -- the Holocaust really has made me look at history, including\nby the way, the re-religious history of the New Testament, or rather the -- the\nChristian Bible, to be correct. That in making it the national religion of Rome,\nConstantine basically had to absolve the Romans. And therefore, it was easiest to\nblame the Jews. And that is not an uncommon way of interpreting history, that it\u2019s\nalways written by the victors, about the people who can\u2019t answer, after the fact. So\nthe study of accurate history is extremely important and history is generally not\ntaught very well, as to what the real issues are. I think that\u2019s the end of my\nthought.",
