        "Answer: My name is Michael Wolff. I was born in Breslau, Germany on June 29th, 1936.",
        "Q: First of all, let me thank you for taking the time to conduct this interview with us, and\nI would like to return to your early years and I would like to ask you about your family\nand about your town. Was it small, big, how many brothers and sisters you had?",
        "A: Okay. I was born in Breslau to -- to Arnold and Elsa Wolff, who lived in Reichenbach,\nwhere my father had an interest in a sawmill. I was very young when I left Germany. I\ndon't have any recollection of the size of the town. The reason I was born in Breslau is\nthat my father did not like the clinic in Reichenbach so he sent my mother to Breslau, but\nwe actually lived in Reichenbach. As far as the town, I have no memories at all because I\nwas just -- I left just before my third birthday.",
        "Q: I see. Did you have -- and do you have any brothers and sisters?",
        "A: I don't have brothers and sisters. I'm an only child. As a matter of fact, when my\nmother told her father that she was pregnant he was very annoyed with her. His comment\nwas that you don't bring a Jewish child into the world under the present conditions in\nGermany.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

        "Q: So both of your parents were Jewish or just --",
        "A: Both of my parents were Jewish. My father was born into an orthodox family. He was\nthe youngest of six, of Doctor Wilhelm (ph) Wolff and Hermenia (ph) Wolff. My mother\nwas -- was the youngest of two. She was born into the Frantz and Martha David family\nin -- in Guben.",
        "Q: What was their occupations by the time --",
        "A: My father -- my mother worked in -- in my grandfather's store when she was young.\nHer mother died when -- when she was only 13, and -- no, I'm sorry, 17, and she -- so she\nworked in the store helping my grandfather. He had a general -- a small general store,\ntoys and, you know, home goods and that kind of thing. My father was set up by my\ngrandfather with a half interest in a sawmill in Reichenbach. He was the youngest, like I\nsaid, and the rest of them, the older kids went to college, but by the time my father was\nready to go my grandfather was getting old so he just bought a business interest, half\ninterest in the business.",
        "Q: Would you describe your family as well off or middle class or, do you remember that?",
        "A: I would -- I don't remember much, but my -- my feeling is there -- they were\nreasonably well off. I think middle class is probably appropriate. My mother worked as a\nbookkeeper for quite a while until she got married, and I know she got pregnant pretty\nquick after that.",
        "Q: Do you remember if your parents were religious?",
        "A: My father was born -- was raised orthodox, and he had a problem when one of his\nfavorite cousins married out of the religion.

We\nwere not extremely religious, but we -- he always celebrated the holidays. That's about\nthe extent of the -- of their religious activities for -- for various reasons. Shavuot was\nnever a big thing in our house, but the Passover was very big always, always had\nPassover, and they always attended services for Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah, and we\ndid almost nothing for Hanukkah, so that was basically it.",
        "Q: Do you remember that day when you were sent off as a Kindertransport child?",
        "A: No, I don't.",
        "Q: You don't remember that?",
        "A: No, I don't, but I can tell you the story behind it.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: Of course in -- in early 1939 my mother's best friend sent her daughter Eva to be taken\nin by foster parents in Scotland, in Glasgow, Scotland, and my mother was unwilling to\nlet me go at that time. When -- by May she decided it was probably best if I go, so she\nmade arrangements for me to be adopted by the same family or by -- by a member of that\nfamily in -- in -- also in Glasgow, Scotland.So in mid June, and I believe it's the 15th of\nJune, but I'm not totally certain, she went to Berlin with me, and since I was -- I was two\nweeks short of my third birthday, she was allowed to go on the train to -- to the -- to the\nship. So as a matter of fact the story she tells is that they had to stop the train because\na -- the head count was one over. They had counted her as one of the children. So once\nthey got it straightened out we went to the -- shipboard, and she handed me over to one of\nthe older girls, you know, please take care of my child, and that's how I got onto the ship.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

You know, it was really hard, and she had\nhanded me off on a ship. She thinks there were about 180 on it, and I was the youngest of\nthe -- the group.When we got to London, Liverpool station, she had arranged -- with her\nusual thoroughness she had arranged for her -- one of her girlfriends who lived in London\nto meet me there, and I met this lady much later on in life and she told me that, you\nknow, she was the only person 1n the London station speaking German, so I grabbed onto\nher and I wouldn't let go. Now, the family that adopted me in Glasgow, Mr. and Mrs.\nNess, Mr. Ness came down to London in his car and picked me up, and she\nactually -- this lady Elsa Weiss (ph), was her name, you know, made sure I got with him,\nand we went to Glasgow.",
        "Q: And what are your first recollections of --",
        "A: I remember the house in Glasgow. I don't remember anything about the trip, but I do\nremember the house in Glasgow. You know, I remember at the end we were at a dead\nend street. At the end of the street there was a hill, and across the hill was a railroad track,\nand the trains would always fascinate me going by. I remember Mr. Ness very well. I\ndon't remember Mrs. Ness, and I don't remember Anita, their daughter, who was two\nyears older than I am, and I do remember him -- you know, they were very orthodox, and\nhe was -- he always put on his tefillin in the morning prayers, and I had my \u2014 my building\nblocks, my wooden building blocks, and I would tie those on standing next to him and I\nwould dove in with him, you know, kind of imitating him.

My father had a\nsmall prayer book, and inside that prayer book he has -- he took notes from this whole\nthing, you know, of when he was arrested in Christinenthal (ph) and where he was and\nwhen he got to England, so a lot of this stuff I pieced back from, you know, taking -- you\nknow, trying to get stuff out of my mother and from his notes in his prayer book, which I\nstill have.",
        "Q: Oh, so your parents ended up also in England?",
        "A: Not really, but let me go through with that.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: Okay. According to my father's records, he came to -- he came to England in August\nof '39. My mother -- back in Germany she was, you know, taking care of her father,\nwho lived with her. She was -- took over the -- charge of the sawmill because the partner\nwas also arrested. My father was arrested. The partner was arrested in Christinenthal (ph).\nThey were sent to Doha (ph), and my mother had all this responsibility, so -- plus she was\ntrying to get him out of there, and if you had a visa to get out to anywhere you\ncould -- they would let you out, and, you know, a little money also under the table also\nhelped. So in August of 1939 he came over to England, but he was not allowed to land in\nEngland per se. They kept him in what they called concentration camps at the time,\nwhich were actually work camps. He was on the Isle of Man, and then he was on several\nother ones during his stay. They kept moving him around. He -- he came to see me, and\nthis is what I get from his notes.

He came to visit me several times in Scotland. While this was going on my mother\nwas applying for visas worldwide, anywhere that she could go, and the only place that\nwould take her, the only visa she was able to get was in Bolivia, South America. So in\nearly 1940 she left for Bolivia. Somehow they managed to keep in touch with each other\nconstantly, and my father asked that she go through Italy and not through Holland\nbecause a lot of the ships out of Holland were being torpedoed. Well, she went through\nHolland, and not -- and not out of Italy, and irony would have it the ship out of Italy was\nsunk and the ship she was on, she made it to Bolivia. As soon as she got to Bolivia, she\nwent to work for a Jewish lawyer, who happened to be the partner of a Bolivian senator,\nDr. Bachnorsodo (ph), and through his help she got visas for my father and I to come and\njoin her in Bolivia. We had -- Mr. Ness drove us down to Liverpool, and we had three\nhiccups so to speak. We got to Liverpool the first time and my father was late because\nthey didn't release him on time, so we had to go back. We missed the boat. The second\ntime they arrested my father because his papers were out of date, so we had to go back,\nand he was in jail, and then they finally got it straightened out. On the third time -- excuse\nme -- in late 1940, I think 1t was December 23rd, around there, we finally sailed for -- for\nSouth America. I remember very little about the crossing. I remember that I heard cannon\nfires, and I heard -- you know, we were on emergencies. I don't know if it was a drill or\nactually a boat sighting, but we -- we came through, and I remember a little bit of\nBermuda. There was -- I remember very vividly there was a big ship model in -- in a\nwindow that I really wanted. You know, I was spoiled.

We went through the Panama Canal, went\nthrough -- you know, came down to Chile and to Bolivia, and I met this woman at the\nstation in La Paz. You know, my mother hadn't seen me for a year and-a-half, and of\ncourse I didn't know her. You know, it was a strange woman. We -- we were very poor.\nWhen my father had the sawmill back in Germany, he built a series of about 12 or 13\nboxes in which they put all their -- their goods in, big wooden boxes, and we went -- we\nmanaged to get one of them to Bolivia, and it happened to be linens and bedding, and she\nkept selling the linens and bedding to keep us going. My father finally found a job, which\nwas out of town, in a sawmill, run by a fellow Jew. My mother was working for\nthis -- Doctor Breeker (ph) was his name, you know, as a -- as a Secretary or something\nlike that, so I was in -- I was in day school, and sometimes I would stay with the Breekers\n(ph) in the evening. I can remember very little about the day school, but I do remember\nthat for lunch every day we had this fruit compote, and even at that age I would pick the\nraisins out of the compote because I never liked them, so just that's what I remember.\nEventually my father got job with a -- in a mining town, Potosi, which is very high up in\nthe Andes, about 12, 14,000 feet up in the Andes, and so we moved to Potosi, and we\nstayed with -- the first place we stayed was with my mother's girlfriend from -- my\nmother's grammar school girlfriend. Her name was Erma (ph) Freed (ph), and they had an\napartment. They let us stay there -- they had an extra bedroom -- until we got settled. Her\nand I were just -- you know, Erma was the total opposite of my mother.

And then\nwe moved into a -- our own apartment, which is kind of an interesting apartment. We had\na bedroom, a dining room and a kitchen, a very large kitchen, and the bathroom was -- I\nalways tell this to my grandkids because they don't believe me, but the bathroom was\nacross the patio, and it was shared by -- by three or four apartments. It did not have\nrunning water. It did not have any lights, so I always traipsed across the patio with my\nbucket to flush, my little board to sit on and toilet paper, a candle and matches. You\nknow, it was a big trick. We -- like I say, there was -- the only running water we had was\nin the kitchen, and we would take a bath once a week, you know, in a big tub just like the\nfarmers used to do, and you know, the water had to be boiled and the water had to be\nfiltered because it came to town in open channels. It was pretty primitive. And I went to\nschool, and I went to grammar school, and of course I stood out like a sore thumb. There\nwas about three or four of us gringos in the school, and the first -- my first year there I\ngot -- during one recess I got tripped up and broke my arm, so my parents didn't want me\nthere. So they moved me to a Catholic school, which was really -- really across the street\nfrom our house, and I wasn't treated very well there. They -- you know, they -- they didn't\nlike Jews, you know. They made me go to services. I got to kneel. I got to cross myself. I\nprobably knew more about the Catholism than I did about the Jewish religion, but I\nsurvived. Later on my father became a manager up in the mine, up in his section of the\nmine, and they gave us company housing, so we moved out to -- to a place called Chaco,\nwhich was outside of town, and it was kind of far out.

We had\na really nice house, you know, compared to what we had before, and I went to\nthe -- the -- to the school, the company school, which had, I think, eight kids total, you\nknow, from all -- from first grade through -- through sixth, seventh -- sixth grade, so we\nwere in a company school. I started learning English again, which I had totally forgotten.\nMy mother always kidded me. She says when I first got to Bolivia I spoke Spanish,\nEnglish and German in one sentence until I -- you know, I lost the English and then\npicked up Spanish and the German. So I went to school there until the sixth grade,\nand then they sent me out of town to school in Aurora, which is a town approximately\n400 miles away, and I was at boarding school -- I was in boarding school and went to an\nAmerican school there. It was an Angelo-American school, which mainly teaches from\nthe states, retired teachers from the states, spinsters mainly, and I was bar mitzvahed\nthere in town, and I -- I learned my Hebrew for, you know, a month -- two months before,\nand I forgot it two months afterwards, but it was -- it was interesting, the school. My\nmother believed that -- you know, in Germany you wear short pants, so I had to wear\nshort pants. So my first year there I'm -- I'm taller than most kids, and I was -- I was\nwearing short pants, and that was -- that was terrible. That was just a really bad year. The\nsecond year I grew into long pants, and, you know, I was one of the older kids so we\nwere pulling the tricks that had been pulled on me on the younger kids, so that was a little\nbit better.

Now, the whole time we were in Bolivia my parents and the\nNess family were corresponding with each other. They kept in touch. You know, my\nparents kept -- you know, I don't know -- through the Elfbaugh (ph), which was the\npublication for the German Jews basically, they kept -- I think 1t came out of New York.\nI'm pretty sure it was. They kept -- you know, you could put ads in there, you know,\nArnold and Elsa Wolff from Reichenbach, Germany looking for their family and friends,\nand they -- they got in contact with all my -- all my uncles on my father's side and my\naunt, and they -- they got in touch with a lot of their friends. So they -- they kept\nin -- they were big writers. They always wrote letters and always kept in touch, and they\nstill corresponded with the Ness family so -- while this was going on. In March of '52 we\nfinally got okay to come, so we left Potosi and we went through Oruro to La Paz, which\nwas a beautiful city, and then eventually to Arica, where we boarded the ship to come to\nthe states. We came up the West Coast of South America to the Panama Canal, and the\nfirst thing I saw -- actually Panama City was in United States territory. I saw first an\nAfrican-American speaking English, which just totally blew me away because in Bolivia,\nyou know, the Mestizos and the Indians only spoke Ketroamina (ph). They didn't even\nspeak Spanish, so that was a real surprise to me, and we flew to New Orleans and then to\nMemphis, Tennessee, where my mother had a cousin, and they -- they actually vouched\nfor us, and that's how we got in. I went to high school there. Well, they put me back a\nyear because we got here in March. The -- the school year here was almost over, so they\nput me back a grade, and they -- so I had to struggle with that.

I joined an AZA group, you know, the AZA group, leg of the B'nai\nB'rith, and I met a lot of kids and a lot of friends. My father was having a hard time\nwith -- with the heat in Memphis. He had arthritis and it was bothering him a lot, and,\nyou know, jobs were hard to get, so my mother had another cousin in San Francisco, and\nmy father decided he was going to go to San Francisco, so he went ahead of us.\nSometime, I believe, in March or April of '53, went to San Francisco, found a job and\nfound -- found a place for us to stay with a Jewish -- a boarding -- like a board house type\nof thing. So in June -- as soon as school was out in June of '53 my mother and I followed\nhim. We -- you know, we railroaded across the country into San Francisco, and there I\nagain joined another a see AZA chapter. Some of those -- some of my friends from the\nAZA chapter I'm still in touch with today, and that was a good experience for me. That\nwas really very interesting for me, and I went to high school there, and all this time -- oh,\nactually I forgot -- I forgot to mention that while we were in Memphis Mr. and Mrs. Ness\nwere coming to New York, and they wanted my parents to -- to meet -- you know, bring\nme up there so they could see me, and my parents had just arrived in the country. They\nboth had new jobs, and we really didn't have any money to -- to -- to spend on a trip. So\nmy parents, you know, were denied -- refused them, and they were very angry.

I lived in Concord, worked in Pittsburgh,\nand then I got drafted. What had happened is, I went to work for Pacific Gas Electric\nbecause of getting deferments from the Army and as soon as I got there they cut out the\ndeferments so I got drafted.

Every time you went to a show you had to wait in line, so I started looking\naround and I found a job in Santa Barbara. So in -- in May of 1970 I went up to Santa\nBarbara and stayed in a private home, just rented a bedroom and stayed there for -- for\nthree or four months until we found a house, and eventually my wife and the kids came\nup and we settled in Santa Barbara. All this time I was still corresponding with the\nNesses, but the -- you know, my parents had stopped because they were mad at them.\nThe Nesses were mad at my parents, and my -- you know, I eventually lost contact with\nthem.

We actually came into London. We stayed in\nLondon for a week, and her son, Richard, picked me up, picked us up and took us to\ndinner at their home, which was very nice. They had two children. Lauren and Jonathan\nwere the two kids, and, you know, we got along fine. Everything was fine, and then we\nfinally took the train up to -- up to Scotland, and Anita 1s -- is a strange bird. She's very\nnervous, I don't know, very sheltered person 1s, I guess, the best way to put it. So, you\nknow, she met us, but she was real scared to death, maybe we have two heads or we're\nweird or something, but everything worked out fine. We got along fine. She got a report\nfrom her son so she wasn't quite as nervous as she should be, but she -- she was -- she\nwas Okay with it, and we -- we stayed with her at the flat, and I got to meet -- you know,\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

Of course they all knew me. They were all older than I am, and I\nwas told how I used to bite Anita. I was told, you know, I had a purse and I used to hit\nher with it, and the thing that really, really bothered me was that when I left her mother\nlost her child, so her mother was really upset when I had left. And one thing we learned\njust this year when we were back in London, from Anita, is that when I -- when my father\ncame to -- when Mr. Ness took me away, they had -- Anita was out of the house.\nThey -- they -- they took her someplace so she wouldn't see the departure, so she\nwouldn't, you know, get sad at me leaving, and I just found that out this year. I didn't\nknow about that before. Anyway, we -- you know, like I say, we met the family, and I\nwas -- I was really unhappy that I, you know, caused that much pain to the mother. It just\nnever occurred to me. Why I don't know, and the night before we left for England my\nmother had called me and she says find out what happened to Eva. That was a little girl\nthat went ahead of me in 1939, and I said, who is Eva? That's the first I ever heard about\nit. So she told me. So I -- Eva was there in Glasgow at this -- this party. She was one of\nthe cousins. Her parents didn't make it through, so she -- she stayed there, and she is, you\nknow, the child of the family that adopted her. So that was -- that worked out very nice.\nIt was -- it was a pretty good reunion, and, you know -- you know, we keep in touch still\nto this day, and I finally convinced Anita that -- to come to the states a couple years later.\nSo in 1995, scared to death to fly, just actually petrified of flying, she and Eva came, and\nwe -- you know, we went all over. We went to San Francisco, went to Vegas, went to\nDisneyland. They wouldn't even get on the people mover at Disneyland. That's how\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

I finally got\nthem on there, and we went of course to see my mother, who lived in Orange County at\nthat time, and my mother wouldn't talk about it. I couldn't get -- my mother, you know,\nreally wouldn't talk about it. She did get the Spielberg tapes, very, very reluctantly and\nnever watched them. She was just -- it was just too hard for her, but she did 1t because we\nreally pushed her. Mainly my wife pushed her, and so I finally cornered my mother. I\nsaid, you know, you're the only living person that has met Eva's mother, and you have to\ntalk to her. So they finally went into a room. I don't know what happened, but hopefully\nshe told her something. So that's basically, you know, my story. I keep in touch with\nAnita, and we went over for the Bar Mitzvah of her grandson in -- in '97 I believe it was,\nand then we went over again in June of this year. We went to London. I took two of my\ngrandkids, an 18-year-old grandson and a 21-year-old granddaughter. We took them\nthere, and I made arrangements for Anita to come down to -- to visit us in -- in London,\nand we went to the -- we went to the war -- to the Kindertransport Monument. We finally\nfound it. It took a while because nobody knows where it is. We found it and took a lot of\npictures there with the kids, and then Anita came down, and both her daughter and her\nson live in London, although they don't speak to each other, so they came in separate\ngroups, and we sat down and we talked, and it was kind of interesting to see the reaction\nof my grandkids. You know, they were really taken.

Now, the family that adopted me in Glasgow, Mr. and Mrs.\nNess, Mr. Ness came down to London in his car and picked me up, and she\nactually -- this lady Elsa Weiss (ph), was her name, you know, made sure I got with him,\nand we went to Glasgow.",

I\ndon't remember Mrs. Ness, and I don't remember Anita, their daughter, who was two\nyears older than I am, and I do remember him -- you know, they were very orthodox, and\nhe was -- he always put on his tefillin in the morning prayers, and I had my \u2014 my building\nblocks, my wooden building blocks, and I would tie those on standing next to him and I\nwould dove in with him, you know, kind of imitating him.

He came to visit me several times in Scotland. While this was going on my mother\nwas applying for visas worldwide, anywhere that she could go, and the only place that\nwould take her, the only visa she was able to get was in Bolivia, South America. So in\nearly 1940 she left for Bolivia. Somehow they managed to keep in touch with each other\nconstantly, and my father asked that she go through Italy and not through Holland\nbecause a lot of the ships out of Holland were being torpedoed. Well, she went through\nHolland, and not -- and not out of Italy, and irony would have it the ship out of Italy was\nsunk and the ship she was on, she made it to Bolivia. As soon as she got to Bolivia, she\nwent to work for a Jewish lawyer, who happened to be the partner of a Bolivian senator,\nDr. Bachnorsodo (ph), and through his help she got visas for my father and I to come and\njoin her in Bolivia.

We got to Liverpool the first time and my father was late because\nthey didn't release him on time, so we had to go back. We missed the boat. The second\ntime they arrested my father because his papers were out of date, so we had to go back,\nand he was in jail, and then they finally got it straightened out.

We went through the Panama Canal, went\nthrough -- you know, came down to Chile and to Bolivia, and I met this woman at the\nstation in La Paz. You know, my mother hadn't seen me for a year and-a-half, and of\ncourse I didn't know her. You know, it was a strange woman. We -- we were very poor.\nWhen my father had the sawmill back in Germany, he built a series of about 12 or 13\nboxes in which they put all their -- their goods in, big wooden boxes, and we went -- we\nmanaged to get one of them to Bolivia, and it happened to be linens and bedding, and she\nkept selling the linens and bedding to keep us going. My father finally found a job, which\nwas out of town, in a sawmill, run by a fellow Jew. My mother was working for\nthis -- Doctor Breeker (ph) was his name, you know, as a -- as a Secretary or something\nlike that, so I was in -- I was in day school, and sometimes I would stay with the Breekers\n(ph) in the evening.

And then\nwe moved into a -- our own apartment, which is kind of an interesting apartment. We had\na bedroom, a dining room and a kitchen, a very large kitchen, and the bathroom was -- I\nalways tell this to my grandkids because they don't believe me, but the bathroom was\nacross the patio, and it was shared by -- by three or four apartments. It did not have\nrunning water. It did not have any lights, so I always traipsed across the patio with my\nbucket to flush, my little board to sit on and toilet paper, a candle and matches. You\nknow, it was a big trick. We -- like I say, there was -- the only running water we had was\nin the kitchen, and we would take a bath once a week, you know, in a big tub just like the\nfarmers used to do, and you know, the water had to be boiled and the water had to be\nfiltered because it came to town in open channels. It was pretty primitive. And I went to\nschool, and I went to grammar school, and of course I stood out like a sore thumb. There\nwas about three or four of us gringos in the school, and the first -- my first year there I\ngot -- during one recess I got tripped up and broke my arm, so my parents didn't want me\nthere. So they moved me to a Catholic school, which was really -- really across the street\nfrom our house, and I wasn't treated very well there. They -- you know, they -- they didn't\nlike Jews, you know. They made me go to services. I got to kneel. I got to cross myself. I\nprobably knew more about the Catholism than I did about the Jewish religion, but I\nsurvived. Later on my father became a manager up in the mine, up in his section of the\nmine, and they gave us company housing, so we moved out to -- to a place called Chaco,\nwhich was outside of town, and it was kind of far out.

I started learning English again, which I had totally forgotten.\nMy mother always kidded me. She says when I first got to Bolivia I spoke Spanish,\nEnglish and German in one sentence until I -- you know, I lost the English and then\npicked up Spanish and the German. So I went to school there until the sixth grade,\nand then they sent me out of town to school in Aurora, which is a town approximately\n400 miles away, and I was at boarding school -- I was in boarding school and went to an\nAmerican school there. It was an Angelo-American school, which mainly teaches from\nthe states, retired teachers from the states, spinsters mainly, and I was bar mitzvahed\nthere in town, and I -- I learned my Hebrew for, you know, a month -- two months before,\nand I forgot it two months afterwards, but it was -- it was interesting, the school.

So my first year there I'm -- I'm taller than most kids, and I was -- I was\nwearing short pants, and that was -- that was terrible. That was just a really bad year. The\nsecond year I grew into long pants, and, you know, I was one of the older kids so we\nwere pulling the tricks that had been pulled on me on the younger kids, so that was a little\nbit better.

So they -- they kept\nin -- they were big writers. They always wrote letters and always kept in touch, and they\nstill corresponded with the Ness family so -- while this was going on. In March of '52 we\nfinally got okay to come, so we left Potosi and we went through Oruro to La Paz, which\nwas a beautiful city, and then eventually to Arica, where we boarded the ship to come to\nthe states. We came up the West Coast of South America to the Panama Canal, and the\nfirst thing I saw -- actually Panama City was in United States territory. I saw first an\nAfrican-American speaking English, which just totally blew me away because in Bolivia,\nyou know, the Mestizos and the Indians only spoke Ketroamina (ph). They didn't even\nspeak Spanish, so that was a real surprise to me, and we flew to New Orleans and then to\nMemphis, Tennessee, where my mother had a cousin, and they -- they actually vouched\nfor us, and that's how we got in.

It just\nnever occurred to me. Why I don't know, and the night before we left for England my\nmother had called me and she says find out what happened to Eva. That was a little girl\nthat went ahead of me in 1939, and I said, who is Eva? That's the first I ever heard about\nit. So she told me. So I -- Eva was there in Glasgow at this -- this party.

I keep in touch with\nAnita, and we went over for the Bar Mitzvah of her grandson in -- in '97 I believe it was,\nand then we went over again in June of this year. We went to London. I took two of my\ngrandkids, an 18-year-old grandson and a 21-year-old granddaughter. We took them\nthere, and I made arrangements for Anita to come down to -- to visit us in -- in London,\nand we went to the -- we went to the war -- to the Kindertransport Monument. We finally\nfound it. It took a while because nobody knows where it is. We found it and took a lot of\npictures there with the kids, and then Anita came down, and both her daughter and her\nson live in London, although they don't speak to each other, so they came in separate\ngroups, and we sat down and we talked, and it was kind of interesting to see the reaction\nof my grandkids. You know, they were really taken. They really never -- you know, I've\ntold them the story, but they never really, you know, got to hear this as firsthand, you\nknow, knowledge, first hand talking about what happened, and then her daughter came\nwith her -- her son, and so we had another -- you know, another round of talks, and that\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

He has joined a temple and he is on the choir and he\nis starting to come back. He came up to Rosh Hashanah for services with us, so he is\ncoming back after th fold. My granddaughter today as a matter of fact 1s going to Israel\non the Birthright trip. She is leaving from New York probably right about now, so I'm\ncurious -- very curious to see what the effect will be when she comes back. I know\nthat -- she was also in London with me. They were very taken by the Holocaust Museum\nin London, and then when they heard the story, you know, that -- that really affected\nthem.

The 12-old-year old -- it was\ninteresting. In Santa Barbara there is -- they did an exhibition. It's a room that the Jewish\nFederation did. I guess they copied Toronto.

Of course my\ndaughter told the teacher about it so I was invited to speak, and I spoke, and they had\none -- they had about -- about 25 kids in the classroom. One -- one was a problem. You\nknow, he had attention deficit, but the rest of them were just amazingly attentive, and to\nbe honest with you, I got the best questions from those kids that I ever got on any speech.\nMost of the time we talked to, you know, high schoolers, and it's not cool to ask\nquestions so they don't ask a lot of questions, but I don't know -- since then Joshua has\nprobably not even thought about it.\nthat this Kindertransport and Holocaust experience was decisive in your life, like did it\naffect certain decisions?",

You know, how hard is\nthat? Just -- you know, it was just unbelievable what they went through, but for me it\nwas -- you know, I just don't have a memory of anything.

I\nremember very distinctly the day the war was over in Europe, there was a -- kind of like a\nbachelor's quarters for the people that worked for the mining -- you know, there was an\nAmerican mining company.
