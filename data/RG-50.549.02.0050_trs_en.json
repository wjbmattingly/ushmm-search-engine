        "Question: This is United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr\ncollection, and this is an interview with Carla Lessing, conducted by Joe Richmond, on\nJune 28\", 1999, in the Lessing home. And this is a follow up interview to the Memorial\nMuseum videotaped interview, conducted with Carla Lessing, in 1990. And the United\nStates Holocaust Memorial Museum grateful -- gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby\nHerr for making this interview possible. This is tape number one, side A. Let\u2019s start just\nwith sort of a brief overview of your experiences during the war, before we move on to --\nto after the war.",
        "Answer: Yeah. I was born, and went to school in Holland, in The Hague, and in August\nof 1942, my mother and my brother and I went into hiding. My father had already died, in\n1936. We had gotten a place to hide through the Jesuit, of the Catholic church, who were\nworking in the Resistance, and they found a place to hide in The Hague, with a widow\nwho took in Jews in order to -- not necessary help Jews, but to help her to go to heaven.\nThat particular hiding place did not work out, because the -- the lady was so in --\nexceedingly anxious that her sons, who knew about that we were hiding there, told us that\nwe needed to leave. They did tell us that we were found out, but that was not really the\ntruth. So then we went from The Hague, again to the Catholic church, we found another -\n- not we found, but th-the Underground found another place in Delft with a Catholic\nfamily with seven children in a very small, little whole downstairs, where it was the\nbarber shop and the beauty parlor, and we were upstairs, and we stayed there. We were\nsupposed to be staying there temporarily because it was not a proper -- not proper -- it\u2019s\nnot a good place to have three more people in the house, and especially three Jews,\nbecause there were seven children, it was very dangerous for the whole family. We did\nstay there until the end of the war, because my mother always told them that she did not\nwant to be separated from her children. So we stayed there until the war was over in\n1945, May fifth, 1945. We --",
        "Q: Wh-Who was it -- Who made up your family? How many -- it was your mother, and --",
        "A: My mother, my older brother, and myself. My father had already died. My\ngrandparents, who had immigrated from Germany, and my uncle, who had immigrated\nfrom Germany in the 30\u2019s, were hiding in the eastern part of Holland, but we did not\nknow where they were hiding. There was a little bit of contact between them and us,\nthrough a third party, who supplied us with ident -- false identity cards. So -- But we\nreally didn\u2019t know where they wer -- we didn\u2019t know where anybody was, really. We\ndidn\u2019t know that my uncle and aunt, and their little daughter had gone to Westerbork, and\nthen were transported to Auschwitz. My uncle went to Sobibor, we didn\u2019t know where\nanybody was. I mean, we only found that out later. So that was really my immediate\nfamily, my mother, my brother, and I, and my mother didn\u2019t want to be separated from\nher children. My brother, at the beginning of the war in 1940, was 14, and I was 11. So,\nanything else that you would like to know about this?",
        "Q: Well, during that time, how much information could you get when you were -- when\nyou were in hiding? I mean, did you have any sense of what was going on either in the\nworld, or how dangerous it was for you at that time?",
        "A: I found out later that -- I wasn\u2019t aware, I was kind of numb during the war. I found out\nlater that my brother would go in one -- 1n the only toilet of the -- of the house, and\napparently the neighbors had a new radio, and they were listening to -- illegally to -- it\nwas called ra -- Radio Oranga, Radio Orange [indecipherable] was -- 1t came from\nEngland, and he knew -- he -- he would listen very carefully what they had to say, what\nwas going on. He did hear a little bit what\u2019s going on. We knew that the invasion of\nNormandy, for instance, we were very happy, because we thought we would be liberated\nquickly. And we knew that they -- all they had -- all -- came all the way to Ireland, I\nmean Holland, and -- I mean, we -- we heard some stuff, but we didn\u2019t know really the --\nthe -- the -- the -- the scale of the -- of the war, and the destruction of the Jews. We would\nhear planes coming over, going -- the German planes going to England, and the English\nplanes going to Germany to bomb [indecipherable]. We -- I was really pretty numb, that\u2019s\nreally what it was, so I was -- I Just was kind of waiting for it to be over, and took a long,\nlong, long time. You have nothing to do, [indecipherable] happen. Nothing to do, so days\nwere very long, and nothing happened, you know.",
        "Q: Was that one of the hardest, the boredom?",
        "A: No, th-the -- the hardest thing was really the fear. Boredom was -- somehow you --\nyou know, as a g -- as a girl I would -- could -- if there was some food, we could peel\npotatoes, I could knit, I could read. We were keenly aware that we were very much in the\nway, that we endangered the people we were hiding with, that there was not enough food.\nThat we had -- somehow there was a terribly -- disturbance in the family, that my hiding\nmother was extremely anxious, that my hiding father was the one who wanted this, who\ndid this, with all his heart. So we -- we -- we kind of picked up constantly these -- these --\nthese cues, I would say, from everyone. The children were angry, the little ones were --\nthe young ones in -- in that family were not -- you know, they -- they couldn\u2019t play the\nway they would play before, or talk, because they had to keep this a secret that we were\nthere. A family would visit, we had to quickly go upstairs to the bedrooms, and then be\nvery quiet. So it was a very tense situation. I -- Boredom was -- I would almost say\nsecondary [indecipherable] you know, it was -- it was really the fear that any of us would\ndo the wrong thing, and then it would leak out that we were hiding there, and then we\nwould be sh -- sent to the camps, and al -- and of course, my hiding father would be also\npicked up and sent to the concentration camps. We didn\u2019t quite know that, but we knew it\nwas extremely dangerous.",
        "Q: You often mentioned in the videotaped interview about Walter?",
        "A: Walter?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Walter, Walter Verhane -- see, in Holland, that -- the -- the young man, who between\n16, and whatever, older, 26 or so, were sent to the camps -- not the camps, to the -- they\nhad to go work camps, yes, work camps. And he was -- he was the one who was called up\nto go to one of those work camps in -- in -- in Germany. He decided to go and not to go\ninto hiding. And luckily he came back. That was one of the most horrendous things for\nus, because we knew -- we always suspected he had gone there because we were in the\nhouse, and that he really couldn\u2019t go into hiding, because, well, we needed to find another\nplace, they would be looking for him. And after the war, we -- we always heard that he\nsuffered terribly. It was very difficult to think about, always, that he went there because\nof us, and I never realized how long he was there, he was there from 1943 to \u201945. I\nthought he was there maybe for a half year. So many, many years are -- many, many\ndecades after the war, I wrote him a letter, and asked him exactly why he had decided to\ngo to a work camp, and then he wrote back that he -- it was adventurous -- an adventure\nfor him. I don\u2019t know if he was completely truthful. He was a very religious man and he\nbelieved that he -- that he would be saved, that he would not get hurt or killed. He had a\nterrible time there. He was -- He was imprisoned there, I found out later. I -- I mean, I -- I\n-- I probably heard this all in 1945, but somehow I pushed it away, and he -- I found out\nlater that he had been in a work camp, and then he said something that -- against the\nGerman nation, and somebody revealed that to -- I don't know to whom, and he was\neventually taken to prison in Germany.",
        "Q: Did you -- So, did you continue a correspondence with him [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, well, I go regularly to Holland, I mean, regularly every three years, four years,\nfive years, and we always meet up. And he has done -- which is very interesting, he has\nmade contact with other people who were in there, in [indecipherable] were in the same\nprison, in the same workcamp, and they have a reunion, so they have done quite, you\nknow, similar thing what we have done, kind of come out, and talked to others who were\nin the same situation, and he even wrote about it, and I have his -- his story. So --",
        "Q: What was the name of his story?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I re -- can\u2019t remember. I [indecipherable] can\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t know\nif he gave it a name yet, or -- but, you know, it\u2019s just a personal memoir.",
        "Q: So what was the relationship like between your family and your hiding family? It was\n[inaudible]",
        "A: During the time, it was very -- it -- very tense at times. After the war, we would -- we\nstill -- we always go there, although my -- my hiding parents are dead now, but I -- when\nI\u2019m in Holland, I always visit with them. My brother always sends them -- he\u2019s in Israel -\n- he sends, around Christmas [indecipherable] he sends oranges, or -- or grapefruits from\nIsrael. We call at Christmas, and we call at birthday, to the er -- just the oldest d-\ndaughter, not all -- not all seven of them, but one or two are -- have -- one -- one of the\nsons 1S very angry with us, because they thought that my mother was very rich, that she\nhad a lot of money, and that she didn\u2019t give enough money for our hiding to her parents.\nMy mother was very poor, she was a widow. The -- The other childs, that\u2019s the one, two,\nthree, fourth oldest, and there is another one who also doesn\u2019t feel so comfortable\nbecause they think that, you know, he -- we should have given more money. We didn\u2019t --\nMy mother didn\u2019t have money, and they were paid very little through the underground, or\nthrough my uncle, who was -- he was -- as a fact, he was in hiding in -- in -- 1n the east of\nHolland, and I think they sent like, only some money, cause he owned a factory. With the\nothers, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a pretty good relationship. We always have to be thankful for\nthem because we -- now the children, you know, they -- they are aware that they suffered,\ntoo, while we were in hiding there, and the interesting thing is this happened very\nrecently, I got -- for our 50\" anniv -- wedding anniversary, we got a letter from the third\noldest child, who is really -- I would almost say obsessed with the war. He reads\neverything, he talks second World War, and -- all the time, and he now has written -- he\nwanted us to read this during our party, but we didn\u2019t because we had to translate this,\nand it wasn\u2019t quite appropriate. But in the -- in this particular letter that he -- was sent the\n10 of May, which was kind of interesting, this -- the war started in Holland, 10\u201c of May\nof 1999, he sent this letter, and there was a paragraph in there which said that the children\nof rescuers were not recognized, especially not in Holland. And it just so happened that I\nknow a psychologist in Holland, who had just written a book about the -- the selection,\nand dislocation of the children of rescuers. So, what I did, I put them in contact with each\nother, so that this man, who is in his 70\u2019s now, not well, can talk to this woman who just\nwrote the book. She is -- Her name is Luma Abbas-Amden, she\u2019s a psychologist, she has\nwritten quite a few books about rescuers. She was in hiding herself, was found, and went\nto a concentration camp, so she has -- she is very, very, very familiar with -- with subject,\nhas done quite a bit of resear -- research. So, I hope it will help this particular man,\nDonald Prafana is his name. Maybe if he speaks to this Luma Abbas-Amden, maybe he\ngets a little bit of validation, and a little bit of relief. So that\u2019s kind of right now my\nrelationship with -- actually the -- only now with the children of my rescue family.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s -- I guess let\u2019s -- let\u2019s go on to after the -- after the war, after liberation.",
        "A: After liberation, that was very strange. We -- We had to leave there, but we had no\nplace to go, we were 1n hiding in Delft, and we were -- returned from The Hague. So my\nmother found a place for me to stay with a -- actually, it was the hiding family of a great\naunt of mine, who was an ice skater, I can\u2019t remember for how long, until she found an\napartment, you know, she was given an apartment in -- in -- in The Hague. I -- I can\u2019t tell\nyou how long, or -- how long I was there. The -- The only thing I remember that, it was a\nvery strange family, and that for the first time, I saw somebody who used opium. Th--Th-\nThe father in that -- in that household [indecipherable] can\u2019t tell you, it\u2019s the only thing I\nremember. He was addicted. That was like in May, June, of 1945. My mother found it\nvery necessary that I would go back to school, and my brother went -- they tried to find\nwork for him. He didn\u2019t want to go to school. He went and -- He went on hashava\n[indecipherable] from Israel. I don\u2019t know exactly what the dates were when he went. So\nmy mother and I lived in the apartment, which was -- she had gotten apartment in a very\nbad neighborhood of The Hague, and eventually we moved to a better neighborhood. I\ndid go to school. I went -- My mother felt that it was necessary that I would go to school\nwith girls my age, 16 or 17 years old. So I went -- She got me -- and this is remarkable --\nshe got me into a school for home economics, which was kind of an -- kind of after high\nschool you went there, and at night I went to evening high school. And then we found the\nZionist organization, and that\u2019s what we did in our free time, and that\u2019s where we found\nback -- actually we didn\u2019t find back, we found other people that were in hiding that came\nback -- back from -- from the concentration camps. I didn\u2019t find back my friends, my old\nfriends from before the war, except one. So that was really my life after -- after the war.\nMy mother tried to make a living, didn\u2019t succeed very well. She didn\u2019t have specific\nskills, she was -- I think she was selling some perfume, and stuff to stores, and then\neventually she found a job as a manager in a clothing -- in clothing stores.",
        "Q: Was everyone at that time trying to -- just go back to normal life? I mean, did -- did --\ndid it -- you know, like it could possibly be like [indecipherable]",
        "A: We tried desperately to go back to normal life, but it was very difficult, because all\naround us, everything was different. You know, you always be -- you -- you know, just\nme going to school for home economics with girls who had gone [indecipherable] to\nschool -- to high school. I didn\u2019t fit in, you know? In the evening school, the evening high\nschool, I didn\u2019t fit in either. So, it was kind of an -- we tried desperately to kind of live a\nnormal life, but I think in Holland, we couldn\u2019t really do it. There were too many -- it -- it\n-- it was just so -- 1t was such a destruction of the Jews that w-we constantly were\nreminded of it, even if you don\u2019t want just to really face it on, [indecipherable] see it, but\nwe were constantly reminded of it. And my uncle, and my aunt, and my -- my cousins\nwere -- were killed in a concentration camp. So, I didn\u2019t have family. My -- Luckily, my\ngrandparents, and my uncles also survived the war. They were just caught maybe two\ndays before the liberation, and they didn\u2019t know what to do with two old people. And my\nuncle, they put him in prison, and then the Germans left, and so my -- then -- then they\nwere freed. But it was just at the last moment that they were caught, and -- and like I said,\nthe Germans didn\u2019t quite know what to do with them because the war was almost over. I-\nIt -- What I remember, the best part of our lives was then the Zionist organization where\nwe all came together with those who survived, and had weekends of -- you know, like\ncamp -- like studying, and we danced, and we sang, and we talked every night. We all\nwanted to go to Israel. My brother was called up to go to Indonesia, because that\u2019s -- in\n1946, they were going to fight to keep Indonesia at that time, the Dutch East Indies\nindependent. And the Jewish -- many of the Jewish survivors, young men, didn\u2019t go, and\nthey went on illegal alleyah to -- to Israel. And my -- So my brother left -- I guess 1t was\nin 19 -- maybe 1946, or so -- earlier than that, to southern France, and -- and then went, I\ndon\u2019t know, maybe stayed there. The whole trip was like three months, and then he went\non one of those boats illegally to Israel, and he was -- he was on the last boat that\n[indecipherable] was caught, but went all the way to Israel, and went into an -- in a camp.\nHe didn\u2019t go -- The next boat went to Cyprus [indecipherable]. So he has been, since\n1946 [indecipherable]. So -- So my mother and I were left. I met Ed in the -- in Zionist\norganization. He left in -- Yeah, go ahead.",
        "Q: What was it about the Zionist organization that -- what did that do for -- for you, and -\n- and the other [indecipherable]",
        "A: We didn\u2019t talk about it, wh-what it did for us was we -- we knew that we had the same\nexperience. We didn\u2019t talk about it, but we knew, we -- it felt comfortable. It didn\u2019t feel\ncomfortable with the non-Jewish youngsters because they had -- didn\u2019t have such a\ndisruption in their lives as we had had, and they didn\u2019t have so many losses in their lives\nas we had had. They said they suffered terribly in -- in -- in the war, but it -- they didn\u2019t\nquite understand what happened to us, that when you -- when we came out of the war, we\ncouldn\u2019t go home, because there was no home any more. Our -- To go back\n[indecipherable] that it seems that as soon as we went into hiding, they emptied our\napartment, and all the furniture, everything was gone, in no time. You know, they just\nemptied it out. So, we didn\u2019t have a place to go back to, so to be with them was\nwonderful, wonderful. And then the other thing that was wonderful, we had the Israeli\nsoldiers, who were in the British brigade, came also to Holland, and they represented\nhealthy young men who had fought in the second World War, and were not persecuted,\nand so they were like symbols of health, and -- and -- and was wonderful. And many of\nour friends went with them back to Israel. Some got married, they fell in love, got\nmarried, some married [indecipherable] you know, just to bring somebody into Israel\nwithout being -- I forgot what [indecipherable] in -- in the -- something that they were\nallowed to go into as well, so our friends also disappeared, you know, like my brother, he\nwent illegally to Israel, so even in those times, people went -- left us. They kind of, you\nknow they went to Israel, and -- and then I, like I said, I met Ed. Ed left in June of 1947,\nand we didn\u2019t quite know if we were going to get married, or not, but we were going to\nkind of see if -- the separation, if it lasted through writing. I completed my schools there,\nand I -- we got a visa for United States because -- very quickly, because my mother was\nGerman born, and the quota for German born people was very low, compared to the\nDutch, and I was underage, too, so I left for the United States in January of \u201949, which\nwas quite something, because we really didn\u2019t want to go to the United States, really\nwanted to go to Israel, but I want to get married to Ed, so I had to go first to United\nStates, before I could go to Israel.",
        "Q: But you knew -- you -- you [indecipherable] United States, but you -- you didn\u2019t think\nyou [indecipherable] want to stay in Holland? Is that --",
        "A: There was really very little in Holland for us. Looking back now, it -- it didn\u2019t feel\ncomfortable any more. There were very few Jews at that time. I don\u2019t know what -- I\ndon\u2019t think we saw a future in Holland. Course you have to remember, the Zionists, so\nthere was only a future in Israel. You didn\u2019t even want to even consider that there was a\nfuture in -- in -- in Holland. And we would just go to United States to kind of go there,\nand then go to Israel, which we did in *51. The period in -- in -- in -- here in United\nStates, between \u00b049 -- for me from \u00b049 until \u2019?51 was kind of strange. I don\u2019t know. We\ngot married six weeks after I came to the States, it was the smallest wedding you can\nimagine, there were -- you know, there were five people at this ceremony, with the justice\nof peace, and seven people at the lunch. Course we didn\u2019t have -- everybody was poor,\nand we didn\u2019t have family. Ed went back to work, he had a job there, I went with him to -\n- it was in Ossening, New York.",
        "Q: What did you think when you got to the United States, [indecipherable] strange?",
        "A: Strange, well, because I never really wanted to go, probably, and it was -- was kind of\nanother disruption, and we really didn\u2019t want to stay, so it was like a vacation here, but\nnot quite, because we had to live a daily life, and -- and again, I had a hard time\nconnecting. I realize that now, I didn\u2019t realize that then. I wasn\u2019t like the other American\nkids who were 19 years old and had gotten married, I di -- hadn\u2019t gone to school here. I\nhad a strong accent, I didn\u2019t know the ways of you -- you know the ways of the\nAmericans. So it -- it felt as if I didn\u2019t belong, which I -- I didn\u2019t belong, really. I\neventually went to work [indecipherable] to make some money, go to Israel. That felt a\nlittle better because I -- I worked, and my days were structured. I didn\u2019t work there very\nlong. I was a filing clerk, I knew foreign geography, so I had a special assignment. Was --\nI think at that time I always wanted to go to Israel, that\u2019s [indecipherable]. Also, my\nfriends had gone there, you know, fr-friends from Holland. We went in 1951 to Israel,\nbecause Ed was about to be called up for the Korean war, and so he left before he got\nenlisted for the Korean war. I -- We arrived in late January of \u201951 in Israel, we went to\nthe kibbutz where my brother was, and I felt really very good there. I had my first child\nwas born in December of \u201951, 1t was for me a very good time [indecipherable]. I was a\nworker, a mother, and a member of the kibbutz. I had voting rights, which was very\nunusual as a woman. I fitted in. There were other people from Holland, which, you know,\nwe had the little group of Dutch people, not that we always spoke Dutch, I don\u2019t think so,\nbut we had the same background, so I was really appreciated as a -- as a worker, I was --\nworked with babies, and with the toddlers, and I had my own group, and that was -- that\nwas a good time. Our child got sick, she had tuberculosis of the lymph nodes, here,\nlymph, and that was a horrible time, she was 1n the hospital for six months, and then she\nneeded to be separated still from other people. That was horrendous. Ed was not very\nhappy in -- in the kibbutz, it was very difficult for him to kind of fit in that -- in that kind\nof rigid structure.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is an continuation of the interview with Carla -- Carla Lessing, and this is tape\none, side B. You were just talking about in the kibbutz that Ed was --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- less happy.",
        "A: Ed was less happy. He had a hard time with -- like I said, rigid structure. Also, at that\ntime, there was very -- what can I say, little chance for anybody to do any -- anything\ndifferent than what you were assigned to do. To get, for instance, go to Haifa to take a\npainting course, I as -- I remember was somebody want to do that, that had to go through\nmany, many people, it had to be okayed by the general meeting. I mean, everything was -\n- nowadays you could do it easily, you could go and study, but in those days it was a --\nmore of the pioneer times. So we decided to -- Ed decided really, and I kind of agreed, to\ngo back to the United States for a couple of years, because E-Ed I think, might have been\none of the very few people who had not one relative in Israel. I had, besides my brother\nand my sister-in-law, I me -- they had one child at that time, I had an uncle, a maternal\nuncle and aunt, and a cousin in Israel. So I had a little bit of family in Israel, but he had\nnone. So that was a difficult period because we went back, and that, of course, in those\ndays, was very, very bad that you go back to the United States. You were kind of a\ndeserter. And we couldn\u2019t go back to the States, because my daughter had had\ntuberculosis, we could go back to Holland. So we decided -- we couldn\u2019t enter the United\nStates because she had had tuberculosis, we decided to go to Holland. And we stayed for\none year in Holland, she was then healthy enough to go. The American embassy let us\ngo, gave us a visa. The year in Holland, and that was in 1955 - \u201956, was kind of a\nvacation for us. We went to Holland knowing that we\u2019re not going to stay, we kind of\nenjoyed it. Ed went to work, I took care of our daughter. We had some old friends there,\nit was familiar, we spoke the language. And we knew it was only going to be a short\nperiod of time. So we arrived here in the United States in October of \u201956. Let\u2019s see, Ed\nhad an -- h-his grandfather lived in Amsterdam, so we had a little bit of family in Holland\nwhen we were there. We arrived October \u00b056, in the United States, again.",
        "Q: At that point, were you thinking that maybe you would get back to Israel?",
        "A: Yeah, we were going to go back to Israel in -- after a few years. I -- I -- I didn\u2019t really\nwant to go to the United States. That never happened. He started -- Ed found a job here\nwhere -- in the neighborhood where we lived, in Dobb\u2019s Ferry. My daughter went to\nschool, went to kindergarten and Dan was born in \u201958. Ed went to evening school, to\nPratt Institute. So, we kind of led this normal family life, where the husband g-goes to\nwork, and he went to school at night, and I took care of the children, and -- and we tried\nto live kind of an -- a normal life, as Holocaust survivors. It was more normal than when\nwe did not have children, because you know, you have to -- you have children, you have\nmore contact with the other people, because the -- like my daughter went to kindergarten,\nand we met some other people whose children went to kindergarten, or she brought\ngirlfriends home, and I met the parents, and so that was more often a normal life,\nalthough it was a difficult life, cause Ed was away a lot, going to school, and then that he\nhad a lot of homework and so on. And we didn\u2019t have a lot of money, we had very little\nmoney. That time I see as -- 1t was kind of a good time, having th-the children, and\nhaving contact with other people. We then moved from Dobb\u2019s Ferry, actually to here.\nThat was in 1963, Ed had just graduated from Pratt Institute, and my daughter went to\njunior high, and our son went to kindergarten here. And we were not involved at all with\nsurvivors, except my whole family. My mother was a -- is a -- you know, was a survivor,\nshe w-worked in New York City, my in-laws were survivors, they lived in Springfield,\nMassachusetts. My -- My two brothers-in-law were, you know, they -- they went to\ncollege. Like I said, my children were surrounded by survivors, they grew up with\nsurvivors, that\u2019s -- was their family. I went to college too, in 1967, to community college,\nWestchester Community College, completed that, went to Mercy College, the Catholic\nCollege right near here, completed my Bachelor\u2019s degree. Trying to catch up, because I\nreally wanted to do something, but I didn\u2019t have the degrees. Before that, I was an\nassistant nursery school teacher. I worked part time when Dan was five years old. So I\nworked from, he was five, \u201963 to I went to -- full time to Columbia School of Social\nWork in s -- I worked for 10 years, \u201973 I went there. So I worked for 10 years as an\nassistant nursery school teacher, because I didn\u2019t have a degree. That was nice.",
        "Q: Had you known for a long time that you wanted to go back and get an education, and\nthe degrees?",
        "A: No, not really. Actually -- Ash -- Ed pushed me, said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go to school?\u201d\nAnd so I did, and I really enjoyed going to school, enjoyed very much going to social\nwork school, although again, it was kind of -- I don\u2019t think there was any survivor in my\nclass. There were lots of young people who had gone to Ivy League schools, and I\nrealized that my education was far less solid than their education, that my papers were not\nvery well written. But at that time, I was very lucky, Columbia Unis -- University School\nof Social Work had never ax -- never had accepted ex -- very, very few older people. And\nwhen I applied, they had -- they had to accept older people, so I was accepted, with some\nother older people. I was already in my 40\u2019s. So I was lucky at that time. Social work\nschool was interesting, because I was placed in -- my first internship was 1n an Protestant\nfoster care agency, and there was a woman there who was, I thought that she was a little\nanti-Semitic, and -- well, a lot anti-Semitic, and which happened, I would almost say to\nbe true. She -- The -- I was in the student unit, and there were two Orthodox Jewish\nstudent -- social work students, and one was taking off all the holidays, and she was kind\nof punished for that, she eventually had to leave. And there were other things that\nhappened that were kind of what I felt was anti-Semitic, and I feel very -- I felt very\nuncomfortable, and was about to quit, but I said, \u201cI can\u2019t. I -- I need to get a social work\ndegree. I must -- I must stay and -- and -- and conquer this.\u201d And I did, 1n a very -- it was,\nI felt, a very hostile environment. I finished the first year, but tha-that really was -- was\nvery hard on me. The second year, luckily, I was placed in an -- in another place where\nthere -- I had a Jewish supervisor, so she couldn\u2019t be anti-Semitic.",
        "Q: Well, at that time, how much of your identity had to do with being Jewish, or being a\nsurvivor? I know you said that you didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t have many survivor friends, you didn\u2019t\nreally know, sort of, you know, you -- there wasn\u2019t a sort of community. How much was\nit part of your identity at that point?",
        "A: I think I wasn\u2019t aware of it, that I -- it -- it was always there. I was always different,\nlike I was saying to you, when I went to social work school, and all these young -- young\nS -- young men, women, who had gone to the very good schools. I mean, I had nothing --\nand I was older. I had nothing 1n common with them. Even the ones who were maybe in\ntheir late 20\u2019s and early 30\u2019s had -- I don\u2019t think there was anyone who had gone through\n-- through what I had gone through. No [indecipherable] interest, somebody would say,\nyou know, where you come from, I said from Holland, and okay so, interesting, I like\nHolland, I like Amsterdam. They would say to me, \u201cPeople are friendly in Holland?\u201d\nAnd you know, that was about it. People were not really interested, as I recall. I might\nalso have given them messages that I didn\u2019t want to talk about it. So, 1t wasn\u2019t really -- it\nwas a -- aS you say, how much was my identi -- I wasn\u2019t so much aware of it, but 1t was\nalways there. I always felt different. And if people were asking, and -- about maybe you\nknow, where were you in the war, and in hiding, I didn\u2019t want to talk about it, because it\nfelt uncomfortable. It felt uncomfortable because -- and it -- over and over and over\nagain, I noticed that when I started to talk about it, people became very serious, and some\npeople kind of looked at me, and they became sad when I was talking about it. And I felt\nI inflicted pain on them, rather than not -- not inflict pain. That\u2019s really what I always saw\nwhen I would talk about it, and you know, when I would say, you know. If somebody\nwould say to -- how -- \u201cWhat happened to you when you were a teenager?\u201d You know,\n\u201cWere you allowed to wear silk stockings?\u201d I mean, when I was a teenager, I was in\nhiding. I mean, or you know, it was such -- it was funny bizarre, if you know\n[indecipherable] these questions. I was glad to have socks, you know? So, how could I\nexplain this to them, that you know, or that the main thing was that you know, in the\nmorning that there was a piece of bread with maybe a little bit marmalade on it. That was\n-- That was wonderful, but going out --",
        "Q: Tell me about within your family, with -- with your kids, and with your husband Ed,\ndid -- you know, did you have conversations about --",
        "A: About --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Like I said, it was always there. I can\u2019t recall. I spoke less about it. When I took my\ndaughter in 19 -- in -- when was it, 1976, how old was she then? Yeah, 1976 to -- to\nIsrael, and then later on to Holland, and introduced her to my rescuers. I mean, there was\nalways something going on, but it wasn\u2019t very open, you know? I introduced my daughter\nto my -- actually when we were in Holland the first time, she knew already my rescuers,\nso -- and then we went again in \u201976, we again mes -- met my rescuers. We t -- also took\nour son to Israel, and to -- to Holland, and all -- France. He also met my rescuers. So it --\nit was always there, but it wasn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t a -- they never asked, tell me now from the\nbeginning, you know, what happened. There were little funny stories sometimes, that we\ntalked about. The interesting thing is our son spoke at our anniversary party, and he kind\nof said that when he was a teenager, he realized that his parents were different from other\nparents. Something -- He didn\u2019t realize when he was a kid, but he realized that we didn\u2019t\nknow a lot about baseball, or all these -- foo -- or football. He didn\u2019t realize that, but later\non he realized that we had a different history than his par -- than the parents of his\nAmerican friends. So it was there, always, with our children, because not only that, my\nmother-in-law had been in Bergen-Belsen, and my father-in-law always kind of protected\nher, because she had been in Bergen-Belsen, she had suffered more than us. My father-in-\nlaw, and my brothers-in-law, and Ed were in hiding. My mother-in-law had suffered\nmore than an-anyone else, so it was always there, it was kind of there, and -- but not a\nwhole lot of -- talked about. The kids knew, and it -- it -- 1t was there, yes. You know,\neverybody had an accent, to start out with. You know, my -- my mother, my mother-in-\nlaw, my father-in-law, not my younger brothers-in-law. S -- He -- They knew they were\nchildren of immigrants, and -- and they were n -- interesting if -- is that my son\u2019s best\nfriend was a -- I don\u2019t know exactly when his father came, his father was an immigrant. I\ndon\u2019t know if his father came in late 30\u2019s or early 40\u2019s. Father was originally born in\nRussia, went to France, and came here wh -- I don\u2019t know if he was a survivor, but\nmaybe a refugee. My daughter\u2019s very best friend father escaped from Poland, came here\nthe United States. I don\u2019t know ex -- he probably was a refugee. And so there 1s\nsomething that they got connected up with people who had a similar background. They\ndidn\u2019t quite know, I mean, what it was, they just kind of discovered it later, that this was\nthe -- the attraction, or the connection that they had with -- with their friends. My\ndaughter, later on, when she moved up to -- near Peekskill, across the road was another\nfamily, a young family, and th -- and she was a daughter of a hol -- of hol -- two\nHolocaust survivors. Best friends still, today. So something is, you know, they get\nconnected with people who have a similar family history.",
        "Q: And when did that start to happen for you? When did you start to become more of a\ncommunity of survivors?",
        "A: Actually, in the early -- in the early 80 -- actually, probably late 70\u2019s, or early 80\u2019s, I\nbecome more aware that I was different, that I had been in hiding, and there must be a lot\nof people who were in h -- had been in hiding, right around here, but I couldn\u2019t get to\nthem, and since I was a social worker, and was a group -- also a group worker, I said, I --\nI should maybe get this support group together. And what I did was I called the Dutch\nconsulate, and I knew that other Dutch Jewish immigrants were in -- had been registered\nthere. And so -- And luckily, the woman I spoke to was a social worker, so she knew\nwhat I was talking about. And I ask her if I could send -- if she would send a letter from\nme to people she knew who had been in the war in Holland, Jewish people who had been\nin war in Holland, and if they would then contact me, maybe we could meet. And so I\nstarted a support group, I think it was in 1982, of Dutch Holocaust survivors who had\nbeen in hiding. And the difficulty was that I th -- that we came from New York City,\nWestchester county, New Jersey -- I had k-kind of asked her to send letters to the me --\nmetropolitan area. And we met the first time was kind of an interesting [indecipherable]\nmaybe 20 people in -- in New York City. We met, and there were older people who had\nbeen in hiding, and younger ones, like people who had been in hiding when they were in\ntheir 20\u2019s. And one man said immediately, he said, \u201cYou know, we don\u2019t need a group,\nwe know who we are, but you youngsters, you were children and teenagers, you didn\u2019t ha\n-- you really didn\u2019t have an identity. You suffered more than we did, because we had an\nidentity.\u201d And he wasn\u2019t so wrong, but I couldn\u2019t quite understand what this was all\nabout. And so we met another two years with the people who were younger, because the\nolder people said you know, that we don\u2019t want the group, and so on. We had this -- I had\nthis support group with younger people who were children and teenagers in the war. And\nthat was very interesting, only difficult -- we had a difficult time to find a place to meet,\nand -- and that kind of -- like I said, it was two years, that was until 1984. And so we had\n-- | ha -- I realized that y -- I found people I had something in common with. I think what\n-- maybe what I\u2019m not talking about 1s that we really kind of led a so-called normal social\nlife here, in -- in resh -- here in Hastings. You know, we went out, we had friends, we had\ndinner parties, but it -- it -- plus we were always a little different. It wasn\u2019t that we were\ncompletely isolated from -- from -- you know, from our neighbors, or the parents of our\nfriends, or friends we had made on our own. But it wasn\u2019t like -- we didn\u2019t quite belong,\nit -- I can tell you, we were at the dinner party, and people had invited some friends, and\nthere were like a couple of couples, and there were two couples who didn\u2019t know each\nother, and then they found out that they grew up on you know, in the same neighborhood\nin the Bronx, and all of a sudden, they had such a strong connection, even, to you know, I\ndon\u2019t know which one it was, Public PS whatever, and do you know that, you know, this\none, and do you know that one, and what did you play in the street, stickball, and you\nknow, we didn\u2019t do this, whatever they played. And I realized, I never can meet anybody\nwho I went to school with. So these kind of things did happen, and I felt very kind of\nisolated, and when the -- when do I ever meet somebody I went to school with? So, I\nguess what I wanted to say to you is we kind of led an -- an -- a normal social life here,\nbut felt different, because we had gone through the war. When we -- When I had the s-\nsupport group of Dutch Hidden Children, we had some connection, I had some\nconnection. And in the meantime, I had become a Social Worker, and I was working as a\nSocial Worker, and -- which was -- I -- I -- I loved my work, and -- but I didn\u2019t have the\nsame background as they had, although, you know, I was very well integrated in my, you\nknow, professional community, of where I worked, at work, you know, there was -- | -- I\n-- I felt pretty -- pretty comfortable there. Then, in ni -- 1980 -- 1990, we did our\ninterview in -- in -- in Washington, and it\u2019s a very complicated story how we -- how they\n-- how we found them, and how they found us. We did go for a weekend to Washingt --\nto be int -- to Washington to be interviewed, and I forgot ex -- was a terribly rainy day,\nand it wasn\u2019t in the museum yet, because the museum wasn\u2019t there yet, 1t was somewhere\nelse in the studio. And I remember that I watched -- watched Ed on a monitor, but not in\nthe same room, and he watched me on a monitor, and we were completely wiped out after\nwe had told the whole story. It was really from -- you probably saw -- you saw the video,\nso it was from early years, and then into -- into the war years. And we were absolutely\nemotionally exhausted. And that was really the very first time that I had told my whole\nstory. I -- I even now get, you know, very moved about it, and I don\u2019t know why. So that\nwas in 1990. At the same time -- at the same -- around that time, one of my colleagues\ngave me an -- he said, \u201cYou know, you might be,\u201d -- I had spoken with him, I guess,\nabout my background. He gave me an announcement of an -- of a conference in -- in New\nYork City, about the psycho-his -- the psycho-history association gave an -- an -- an -- an\n-- an -- an conference for children of the Holocaust. And it was -- he said, \u201cYou might be\ninterested.\u201d So, I said, \u201cYeah, I might be interested to do that.\u201d So I went there, I took a\nday off, I went to that seminar, and there was a whole row of people there sitting behind a\ntable, and -- and I was there, and I -- you know, somebody was going to listen to all these\npapers they were going to present. And I listened to the papers they were presenting there\nall about -- they were very professional and they had done a lot of research on children of\nthe Holocaust. And all I heard was kids who had been in a concentration camp. And I, at\none time I wanted to ask -- I ask a question to these professional people, was -- one was\nJudith Kastneberg, and some others, Eva Fogelman, and some others, and I ask a\nquestion, if they had done any research on children who ha -- children of the Holocaust\nwho had been in hiding. And they said no, they hadn\u2019t, they don\u2019t have any data on that.\nAnd somebody in the back heard my question, and came over to me, and she says, \u201cYou\nhave been in hiding?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cYou know, we are planning a conference for\nHolocaust survivors who had been in hiding, or children who had -- Holocaust survivors\nwho had been in hiding, are you interested?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes, I\u2019m interested.\u201d So, we\nexchanged telephone numbers, and she said, and there\u2019s a meeting whenever, to -- in one\nweek or two week. I went to that first meet -- for me that first meeting, of children -- wh-\nwhich was -- which was later called Hidden Children of the Holocaust. And they p --\nwere planning a conference from the Memorial Day weekend of \u201991. And so I started to\nwork with them, and I said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m a social worker, I can plan workshops.\u201d And\nso I got connected to this group of people who all were -- had been in hiding, and -- and\nwherever, Poland, France, Belgium, not one from Holland. And we started to work on\nthis conference, which was very intense, and regular, you know, meetings, and planning,\nand shouting, and arguing, and -- and was very interesting. And I started my work,\ngetting workshop leaders together, I got -- you know, there were lots of people who had\nbeen in hiding, who were in the mental health profession, so I had no problem finding\npsychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, in this country, or overseas, or in Holland, or\nin England, or in Israel, I mean there were lots of them. So I began my work with the\nHidden Children, and in a ki -- in a sense, I found my community. I -- I did things I had\nnever done before. I didn\u2019t know anything about how to organize workshops, but I did. I -\n- | -- You know, we made all kinds of decisions about -- about the conference, how\nconfidential it should be, who should -- what we -- we -- we planned workshops, we had\nto give names, you know, we had to find out what was -- what would be appropriate\nworkshop for people who had been in hiding as children. And we came up with all kinds\nof -- you know, we got some consultants, there\u2019s a psychiatrist in -- in Vancouver, who\nwas a hidi -- had been in hiding as a child, who had been very involved in child survivors\nof the Holocaust, so we -- we contacted him, and we -- we got all the names for the\nworkshops, and -- and titles for the workshops, really. We had to read up on it, you know,\nlike abandonment, trust, you know, relationships, all these problems of -- of people\nhaving because of the Holocaust, and the experiences they went through.",
        "Q: What was that -- What was that like to all of a sudden look at these issues in such an\nintellectual way, rather than just from your own, you know --",
        "A: From my own exp -- oh, it was wonderful to do it in that way. Was great, I mean, I --\nwell, don\u2019t forget, I have been in psychotherapy -- I ha -- in -- in therapy since ni -- I was\nin therapy already since 1979. 1970, I had been in therapy, so I mean, I could look into --\nintellectually in -- in a way that -- cause I had my -- you know, I had done some work in\ntherapy. There was -- I think what happened that you felt kind of a little control, and a\nlittle power, to do it like that, you know. It wasn\u2019t that easy when people talked about it,\nyou know, when other people talked about how they were abandoned by their mother,\nwhen their mother waved them goodbye, or when they were placed in a convent, you\nknow, I mean that -- that wasn\u2019t easy to kind of listen to. But to plan it, wonderful. I still -\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the interview with Carla Lessing, and this is tape two, side A.\nAnd you were just -- actually, I want to backtrack just a little bit --",
        "A: Go ahead.",
        "Q: -- from where you were before, when you -- you said you did the first video interview,\nand that was the first time that you really told your whole story , sort of [indecipherable]",
        "A: Chronologically, right.",
        "Q: And -- And I wonder if you just could talk about that a little bit more, what that was\nlike to begin to see that experience as a -- as a story\u201d?",
        "A: You know, you talked about how was it intellectually, you know, you can do all these\nworkshops, you know, that -- the titles of the workshops, and you can talk about\nabandonment, and all this kind of stuff, and the -- the interesting thing is that when I have\nwritten a -- a paper about the vanished culture of Holocaust survivors, and I was just\ngoing to be published this summer, and I write about it, that there are other therapies for\nHolocaust survivors, other than individual and group therapy. There -- Such as giving a\ntestimony in a chronological order, not only that you\u2019re going to validated, but somebody\nis listening, and that your -- for whatever hours it is, to your story, rather than to just a\nbrief segment, and -- but that you are being validated, that you go through it, that it is\nyour story, that -- and not only I say that it is, you know, therapeutically very important\nfor anyone to tell their whole story, chronologically, other professionals, I mean I -- it\u2019s\nnot my inve -- you know, I didn\u2019t find that out, I -- I read that over and over again, from\nother professionals. It is -- I didn\u2019t realize that it was so important. Not that I\u2019m watching\nmy video, I never look at it, I -- you know, but it\u2019s there, and we gave it to our children,\nas a document. And you can see I get -- every time [indecipherable] and I don\u2019t know\nwhy. Because I have kept it -- You know, one of the workshops we have, keeping --\nkeeping a secret, I -- I actually did the workshop, keeping -- keeping a secret, and this 1s\nwhat we really have done, because we wanted to lead a normal life. And we succeeded.\nYou know, we had -- we had a family, we had children, we went to the PTA meetings,\nwe went -- we went on vacations with our children, but there was so much else. So, I\nthink that when I did this interview, in a sense, for the first time somebody listened, and\nasked me questions. Like I said, I was -- I s -- I was -- I was validated, it was -- it\nappeared to be a very important document. And when I so casually said, you know, they\ntake a little s -- you know, a little piece out of, then put it on the -- I wasn\u2019t pleased with\nwhat they took out at the museum, but it\u2019s there, and -- and you know, when my -- my --\none of my daughter\u2019s friends went to the museum, and she said, \u201cI saw your mother on\nthe -- you know, on th -- on the -- on the video.\u201d Or -- And somebody else said, \u201cI looked\nfor you on the video.\u201d Something happened, something -- and like I said, something -- the\nstory that I kept hidden all these years is now out in the open. So, I think that\u2019s important.\nIt\u2019s -- It seems to be more important than writing 1t down, because when I -- when I wrote\nmy paper, or -- or when I spoke, you know at some conferences about it, it isn\u2019t the same.\nIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m talking about myself in the paper, but it\u2019s about Holocaust survivors and\ntheir losses, and their -- the -- the terrible harm that it has done to people who have been\nin the Holocaust emotionally, and how people have continuously to suffer, some more,\nsome less, and you know, s -- most of us every day think about the Holocaust in -- in a\nvery -- Sometimes just a minute, you know, or -- or sometimes longer, but there\u2019s always\na reminder, something. There\u2019s always in your life a reminder of the -- those years that\nwe were in hiding, or even before. See, you must have seen in my video, that when I was\nin Germany with my grandparents, I already was persecuted there in a s -- in a sense,\nbecause I couldn\u2019t -- like [indecipherable] and my grandfather said, \u201cOh, you may not\nspeak loudly, you may -- don\u2019t -- don\u2019t draw any attention to yourself.\u201d And I saw -- you\nknow, I saw the SS already marching around. So I grew up with -- for a long time since\n1936 until 1945. So I -- My -- My -- My whole life until 1945 was the Holocaust really,\nyou know? So when it is -- when I gathered -- when -- you were asking about the video, I\nthink 1t was very important for me, and that I had a -- like I said, it\u2019s been -- it\u2019s stored\naway, and I don\u2019t think of it.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] just to know it\u2019s there?",
        "A: No, I actually -- maybe to know that it\u2019s there. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to\nit when I\u2019m not here any more, but it\u2019s there. And -- And -- And there are so many\n[indecipherable] I don\u2019t know how important -- it\u2019s important for my family, my\ncountrymen. We were a -- a -- I don\u2019t know if you know, we were also interviewed by\nJane Marks, who published the book, \u201cHidden Children: Secret Survivors of the\nHolocaust.\u201d I don\u2019t know if you know that. And our stories is in that book, and -- and\npeople read our story. It\u2019s -- It wasn\u2019t so intense as the one in the -- you know, in 1990.\nThis was after the conferences she did this. Actually, in February of \u201991, I was\ninterviewed by New York Magazine, and I also told my story there, and it was published\nin the New York Magazine, with five others who were in hiding. That wasn\u2019t as\nimportant to me as the -- as the video. You know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- I\u2019m in a magazine, you\nknow, so -- and my story 1s in there, so people read it. It didn\u2019t have the depth of it, you\nknow? Because he edited it, of course, a lot, you know?",
        "Q: [indecipherable] the whole story from beginning to end?",
        "A: Now I don\u2019t know. I -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know exactly what it is. I -- I guess I don\u2019t\nwant to minimize this, but I guess the video makes it more real, because I\u2019m there, I\u2019m\ntalking. But it is printed, it\u2019s kind of I have given it away, you know? And -- And the\nperson who interviewed me, and edited it, it becomes more her story. I don\u2019t know, I -- I\ndid something with it that I don\u2019t know I want -- I don\u2019t know what I did with it. It\u2019s\nreally what -- what -- what this video did for me. Is there anything else that you\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: Well, a couple other things just in terms of how, you know, as you look back on your\nexperiences, and how it shaped who you\u2019ve become now, in terms of things like, let\u2019s\ntalk about religion, first off. I know that in your video interview you say, one thing that I\nthought was very interesting, about how proud you were to wear a yellow star, and to be\nJewish.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And --",
        "A: Not Jewish as a religious person, Jewish as [indecipherable] people. One experience I\nremember 1s that when I was in hiding in the second -- with the second family, maybe a\nyear into that, so let\u2019s say that 19 - 1943 - 1944, at one time I realized I don\u2019t understand\nthat I -- I, or any -- or my mother, my brother, had to go through this. Cause we were kind\nof innocent people, we didn\u2019t harm anybody. And if there was a god, why -- why did He\ndo this? Why did He do this to us, and to the other Jews? And in particularly there was\nround -- when we -- we -- before the war, there was a Jewish family around the corner,\nthey had two very small children, babies, and they -- somehow we knew that they were\nnot in hiding, I don\u2019t know why, but that they were shipped -- that they went to -- to the\ncamps, and I just could remember these little girls, and [indecipherable] what happened\nto them, and -- and you know, that they would not sleep in their own beds, and they\nwould be somewhere in -- in Westerbork, and I don\u2019t know what would happen to them,\nwe didn\u2019t quite know what happened to them. These little kids, you know? Horrible,\nwhen I think about it. So I -- I -- At the time when I was in hiding, I think about\n[indecipherable] of God. Why, why did He put us here? I mean, in hiding, we afraid\nevery day for your life, and for the other people\u2019s lives. So, I kind of said, I -- I don\u2019t es --\nI don\u2019t believe there is a God. And I still don\u2019t -- I mean, I\u2019m still struggling with this in a\nsense, because I don\u2019t know how this all happened around me. But we are not religious.\nWe celebrate Hanukah, and Pesach, and Rosh Hashanah, mo-more as a -- as a tradition,\nand as ee -- having a Jewish identity, not necessarily religious identity. And we were also\n[indecipherable], so we got kind of an -- a different identity. When you go to Israel, you -\n- you don\u2019t need to be religious to be Jewish. So, our children were not Bar Mitzvahed,\nand Bat Mitzvahed, we have never belonged to -- to a temple, we are not affiliated. But\nwhen my mother -- before my mother died, I went to a - to the temple down here, it\u2019s a\nReform temple, went to the rabbi, if he wanted to do a service, and he said yes. And when\nmy mother died, I went down there, and he did the service -- graveside service, you\nknow? So there is some -- I think it is more -- my Jewishness is more connected to\ntradition, and to the Jewish people, rather than to religion. I went a little bit to Hebrew\nschool in Holland, but that was not a very good experience, because my mother sent us to\nshul on the holidays, and she usually didn\u2019t go, and -- and it was very boring, and it was\nall in Hebrew, and we didn\u2019t understand anything, and -- and -- you know, the men were\nthere, and the women were upstairs, and it was not a good experience. So, I guess you get\nthe picture.",
        "Q: How about in terms of your [indecipherable] family, and -- you -- you talked a little\nbit today about the importance of having, you said, a normal life.",
        "A: Oh. I think what we all -- most of us who went through the war wanted to lead a\nnormal life, which meant getting married, and having children, although there are many --\nquite a few hidden children who never got married because they\u2019re -- they\n[indecipherable] had a terrible hard time with relationships. With -- I got married when I\nwas 19, and -- and I think that\u2019s the most important thing, to have a family lead so called\na normal life, have -- our -- both our children got married, they both have two children.\nIt\u2019s amazing. I mean, that -- that this happened after we were not supposed to be here. So\nwhen -- when we had our anniversary, and yo-you know, months ago, there were our\nchildren and our grandchildren. Unbelievable, you know\u201d So I think that\u2019s -- th-the -- the\naccomplishment that we -- I\u2019m most proud of. And they seem to -- a little -- I\u2019m -- our\nchildren are affected by our Holocaust experience, they seem to be managing quite well.\nMy daughter is married for 23 years. Our son is married for 10 years, more than 10 years.\nSo somehow we have instilled in our children that family is important. They\u2019re good\nparents, they are extremely good parents, sometimes a little too permissive, but they\u2019re\ngood parents, they love their children very much. And you see it every day, you know?\nThey -- So, I think that that\u2019s my proudest accomplishment.",
        "Q: Is there anything else that you would want to add?",
        "A: To what? To family?",
        "Q: To everything.",
        "A: Oh. Oh, the -- you want to know a little bit? How much more do we have?",
        "Q: We -- We have enough time.",
        "A: Well, the -- the -- the mo -- the other important thing is that -- I was telling you about\nworking on the Hidden Child conference, and that we did have the conference, and it was\nan incredible success. We had -- We had expected 300 - 400 people, there was 1600\npeople and we didn\u2019t know what to do, the people in the workshops, that were like\nworkshops -- 75 people [indecipherable] you know, the workshops [indecipherable]. But\nit was such a success, and it changed many people\u2019s lives, including my husband\u2019s,\nwhich you probably will hear on tape. It changed because people found each other,\nconnected with each other, and what we did after the conference, we started support\ngroups, and I\u2019m still running a support group here in Westchester county. We just had a\nmeeting yesterday. So that\u2019s from August of \u201991 until now, is eight years, we run -- once\na month we have a meeting. It\u2019s not always easy, but we do have a meeting, and I have\nbeen working since then for the Hidden Child Foundation, which is the organization, and\nin the last few years since I retired from the clinic, and I only working part time at night,\nprivate practice, I am working with Holocaust -- needy Holocaust survivors. What I\u2019m\ndoing is trying to help them connect with resources, financial or psychological resources,\nso that they don\u2019t continue to suffer unnecessarily. And that keeps me quite busy. I go\nonce a week to New York City, and I work with -- I -- with agencies, or with the\nHolocaust survivors. They don\u2019t [indecipherable] to have been in hiding, anyone --\nanyone who was in concentration camp, or child of Holocaust survivors who are needy\nfor whatever, psychological services, or financial services, I will connect them up with\nwhatever 1s available. So, that fills kind of, my life. This is not all, you know, because I s-\nspend about two -- two and a half days in my private practice. I have my family,\nwhenever they want to come over [indecipherable] we always there. But it is a major part\nof my life to be involved in Holocaust survivors, and their -- their needs, or just maybe a\nparty or an -- an -- like we had yesterday a brunch, where people get together and\nconnect, because that\u2019s really one of the most important things for the survivors, to\nconnect with others. So -- Because, for instance, with hiding, we understand what it\nmeans -- when I talk to somebody else who has been in hiding, I know what it means to\nbe -- have been in hiding, and have your schooling interrupted, your family life\ninterrupted, your friendships interrupted, everything interrupted, I never was normal\nagain after that.",
        "Q: What -- What is it about you and your husband that have led you both to become so\ninvolved in this way, where others may -- may not?",
        "A: Well, Ed wasn\u2019t involved in the planning of the conference. I did -- I kind of dragged\nhim along. And then he got involved very much when -- with the sh -- with the Shoah\nFoundation, when he started to do the interviews, he got very involved, which is only I\nthink the last three years or so. I don\u2019t know -- I am involved because I think I can\ncontribute. It\u2019s my community. Although socially we don\u2019t get together, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s an\ninteresting contradiction. I can work with them, but socially, you know, with a few, but\nnot with the whole -- with all the people that I am in contact with. I can only -- it -- it -- it\nfeels -- it feels good to -- to do this. It -- I ha -- kind of -- I can contribute because I\u2019m a\nsocial worker, ca -- ca -- I can do the work, it\u2019s not difficult for me to do this. I -- I can\u2019t\nreally tell you why -- it -- it -- it just -- that\u2019s what I need to do. I can also tell you that I\nnever was a member of any organization before this. I never was a member of Hadassah,\nI never was a member of, like I say, of the temple. I never was a member of any\norganization before I got connected to the Hidden Child Foundation. I didn\u2019t belong, I\ndidn\u2019t feel comfortable, I -- I me -- I mean, I am now a member of the Clinical Social\nWork Society, I go to their meetings, but it\u2019s not the same, it\u2019s a professional\norganization. So, I guess that\u2019s where I feel I belong.",

    "answers": [
        "Answer: Yeah. I was born, and went to school in Holland, in The Hague, and in August\nof 1942, my mother and my brother and I went into hiding. My father had already died, in\n1936. We had gotten a place to hide through the Jesuit, of the Catholic church, who were\nworking in the Resistance, and they found a place to hide in The Hague, with a widow\nwho took in Jews in order to -- not necessary help Jews, but to help her to go to heaven.\nThat particular hiding place did not work out, because the -- the lady was so in --\nexceedingly anxious that her sons, who knew about that we were hiding there, told us that\nwe needed to leave. They did tell us that we were found out, but that was not really the\ntruth. So then we went from The Hague, again to the Catholic church, we found another -\n- not we found, but th-the Underground found another place in Delft with a Catholic\nfamily with seven children in a very small, little whole downstairs, where it was the\nbarber shop and the beauty parlor, and we were upstairs, and we stayed there. We were\nsupposed to be staying there temporarily because it was not a proper -- not proper -- it\u2019s\nnot a good place to have three more people in the house, and especially three Jews,\nbecause there were seven children, it was very dangerous for the whole family. We did\nstay there until the end of the war, because my mother always told them that she did not\nwant to be separated from her children. So we stayed there until the war was over in\n1945, May fifth, 1945. We --",
        "A: My mother, my older brother, and myself. My father had already died. My\ngrandparents, who had immigrated from Germany, and my uncle, who had immigrated\nfrom Germany in the 30\u2019s, were hiding in the eastern part of Holland, but we did not\nknow where they were hiding. There was a little bit of contact between them and us,\nthrough a third party, who supplied us with ident -- false identity cards. So -- But we\nreally didn\u2019t know where they wer -- we didn\u2019t know where anybody was, really. We\ndidn\u2019t know that my uncle and aunt, and their little daughter had gone to Westerbork, and\nthen were transported to Auschwitz. My uncle went to Sobibor, we didn\u2019t know where\nanybody was. I mean, we only found that out later. So that was really my immediate\nfamily, my mother, my brother, and I, and my mother didn\u2019t want to be separated from\nher children. My brother, at the beginning of the war in 1940, was 14, and I was 11. So,\nanything else that you would like to know about this?",
        "A: I found out later that -- I wasn\u2019t aware, I was kind of numb during the war. I found out\nlater that my brother would go in one -- 1n the only toilet of the -- of the house, and\napparently the neighbors had a new radio, and they were listening to -- illegally to -- it\nwas called ra -- Radio Oranga, Radio Orange [indecipherable] was -- 1t came from\nEngland, and he knew -- he -- he would listen very carefully what they had to say, what\nwas going on. He did hear a little bit what\u2019s going on. We knew that the invasion of\nNormandy, for instance, we were very happy, because we thought we would be liberated\nquickly. And we knew that they -- all they had -- all -- came all the way to Ireland, I\nmean Holland, and -- I mean, we -- we heard some stuff, but we didn\u2019t know really the --\nthe -- the -- the -- the scale of the -- of the war, and the destruction of the Jews. We would\nhear planes coming over, going -- the German planes going to England, and the English\nplanes going to Germany to bomb [indecipherable]. We -- I was really pretty numb, that\u2019s\nreally what it was, so I was -- I Just was kind of waiting for it to be over, and took a long,\nlong, long time. You have nothing to do, [indecipherable] happen. Nothing to do, so days\nwere very long, and nothing happened, you know.",
        "A: No, th-the -- the hardest thing was really the fear. Boredom was -- somehow you --\nyou know, as a g -- as a girl I would -- could -- if there was some food, we could peel\npotatoes, I could knit, I could read. We were keenly aware that we were very much in the\nway, that we endangered the people we were hiding with, that there was not enough food.\nThat we had -- somehow there was a terribly -- disturbance in the family, that my hiding\nmother was extremely anxious, that my hiding father was the one who wanted this, who\ndid this, with all his heart. So we -- we -- we kind of picked up constantly these -- these --\nthese cues, I would say, from everyone. The children were angry, the little ones were --\nthe young ones in -- in that family were not -- you know, they -- they couldn\u2019t play the\nway they would play before, or talk, because they had to keep this a secret that we were\nthere. A family would visit, we had to quickly go upstairs to the bedrooms, and then be\nvery quiet. So it was a very tense situation. I -- Boredom was -- I would almost say\nsecondary [indecipherable] you know, it was -- it was really the fear that any of us would\ndo the wrong thing, and then it would leak out that we were hiding there, and then we\nwould be sh -- sent to the camps, and al -- and of course, my hiding father would be also\npicked up and sent to the concentration camps. We didn\u2019t quite know that, but we knew it\nwas extremely dangerous.",
        "A: Walter?",
        "A: Walter, Walter Verhane -- see, in Holland, that -- the -- the young man, who between\n16, and whatever, older, 26 or so, were sent to the camps -- not the camps, to the -- they\nhad to go work camps, yes, work camps. And he was -- he was the one who was called up\nto go to one of those work camps in -- in -- in Germany. He decided to go and not to go\ninto hiding. And luckily he came back. That was one of the most horrendous things for\nus, because we knew -- we always suspected he had gone there because we were in the\nhouse, and that he really couldn\u2019t go into hiding, because, well, we needed to find another\nplace, they would be looking for him. And after the war, we -- we always heard that he\nsuffered terribly. It was very difficult to think about, always, that he went there because\nof us, and I never realized how long he was there, he was there from 1943 to \u201945. I\nthought he was there maybe for a half year. So many, many years are -- many, many\ndecades after the war, I wrote him a letter, and asked him exactly why he had decided to\ngo to a work camp, and then he wrote back that he -- it was adventurous -- an adventure\nfor him. I don\u2019t know if he was completely truthful. He was a very religious man and he\nbelieved that he -- that he would be saved, that he would not get hurt or killed. He had a\nterrible time there. He was -- He was imprisoned there, I found out later. I -- I mean, I -- I\n-- I probably heard this all in 1945, but somehow I pushed it away, and he -- I found out\nlater that he had been in a work camp, and then he said something that -- against the\nGerman nation, and somebody revealed that to -- I don't know to whom, and he was\neventually taken to prison in Germany.",
        "A: Yeah, well, I go regularly to Holland, I mean, regularly every three years, four years,\nfive years, and we always meet up. And he has done -- which is very interesting, he has\nmade contact with other people who were in there, in [indecipherable] were in the same\nprison, in the same workcamp, and they have a reunion, so they have done quite, you\nknow, similar thing what we have done, kind of come out, and talked to others who were\nin the same situation, and he even wrote about it, and I have his -- his story. So --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I re -- can\u2019t remember. I [indecipherable] can\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t know\nif he gave it a name yet, or -- but, you know, it\u2019s just a personal memoir.",
        "A: During the time, it was very -- it -- very tense at times. After the war, we would -- we\nstill -- we always go there, although my -- my hiding parents are dead now, but I -- when\nI\u2019m in Holland, I always visit with them. My brother always sends them -- he\u2019s in Israel -\n- he sends, around Christmas [indecipherable] he sends oranges, or -- or grapefruits from\nIsrael. We call at Christmas, and we call at birthday, to the er -- just the oldest d-\ndaughter, not all -- not all seven of them, but one or two are -- have -- one -- one of the\nsons 1S very angry with us, because they thought that my mother was very rich, that she\nhad a lot of money, and that she didn\u2019t give enough money for our hiding to her parents.\nMy mother was very poor, she was a widow. The -- The other childs, that\u2019s the one, two,\nthree, fourth oldest, and there is another one who also doesn\u2019t feel so comfortable\nbecause they think that, you know, he -- we should have given more money. We didn\u2019t --\nMy mother didn\u2019t have money, and they were paid very little through the underground, or\nthrough my uncle, who was -- he was -- as a fact, he was in hiding in -- in -- 1n the east of\nHolland, and I think they sent like, only some money, cause he owned a factory. With the\nothers, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a pretty good relationship. We always have to be thankful for\nthem because we -- now the children, you know, they -- they are aware that they suffered,\ntoo, while we were in hiding there, and the interesting thing is this happened very\nrecently, I got -- for our 50\" anniv -- wedding anniversary, we got a letter from the third\noldest child, who is really -- I would almost say obsessed with the war. He reads\neverything, he talks second World War, and -- all the time, and he now has written -- he\nwanted us to read this during our party, but we didn\u2019t because we had to translate this,\nand it wasn\u2019t quite appropriate. But in the -- in this particular letter that he -- was sent the\n10 of May, which was kind of interesting, this -- the war started in Holland, 10\u201c of May\nof 1999, he sent this letter, and there was a paragraph in there which said that the children\nof rescuers were not recognized, especially not in Holland. And it just so happened that I\nknow a psychologist in Holland, who had just written a book about the -- the selection,\nand dislocation of the children of rescuers. So, what I did, I put them in contact with each\nother, so that this man, who is in his 70\u2019s now, not well, can talk to this woman who just\nwrote the book. She is -- Her name is Luma Abbas-Amden, she\u2019s a psychologist, she has\nwritten quite a few books about rescuers. She was in hiding herself, was found, and went\nto a concentration camp, so she has -- she is very, very, very familiar with -- with subject,\nhas done quite a bit of resear -- research. So, I hope it will help this particular man,\nDonald Prafana is his name. Maybe if he speaks to this Luma Abbas-Amden, maybe he\ngets a little bit of validation, and a little bit of relief. So that\u2019s kind of right now my\nrelationship with -- actually the -- only now with the children of my rescue family.",
        "A: After liberation, that was very strange. We -- We had to leave there, but we had no\nplace to go, we were 1n hiding in Delft, and we were -- returned from The Hague. So my\nmother found a place for me to stay with a -- actually, it was the hiding family of a great\naunt of mine, who was an ice skater, I can\u2019t remember for how long, until she found an\napartment, you know, she was given an apartment in -- in -- in The Hague. I -- I can\u2019t tell\nyou how long, or -- how long I was there. The -- The only thing I remember that, it was a\nvery strange family, and that for the first time, I saw somebody who used opium. Th--Th-\nThe father in that -- in that household [indecipherable] can\u2019t tell you, it\u2019s the only thing I\nremember. He was addicted. That was like in May, June, of 1945. My mother found it\nvery necessary that I would go back to school, and my brother went -- they tried to find\nwork for him. He didn\u2019t want to go to school. He went and -- He went on hashava\n[indecipherable] from Israel. I don\u2019t know exactly what the dates were when he went. So\nmy mother and I lived in the apartment, which was -- she had gotten apartment in a very\nbad neighborhood of The Hague, and eventually we moved to a better neighborhood. I\ndid go to school. I went -- My mother felt that it was necessary that I would go to school\nwith girls my age, 16 or 17 years old. So I went -- She got me -- and this is remarkable --\nshe got me into a school for home economics, which was kind of an -- kind of after high\nschool you went there, and at night I went to evening high school. And then we found the\nZionist organization, and that\u2019s what we did in our free time, and that\u2019s where we found\nback -- actually we didn\u2019t find back, we found other people that were in hiding that came\nback -- back from -- from the concentration camps. I didn\u2019t find back my friends, my old\nfriends from before the war, except one. So that was really my life after -- after the war.\nMy mother tried to make a living, didn\u2019t succeed very well. She didn\u2019t have specific\nskills, she was -- I think she was selling some perfume, and stuff to stores, and then\neventually she found a job as a manager in a clothing -- in clothing stores.",
        "A: We tried desperately to go back to normal life, but it was very difficult, because all\naround us, everything was different. You know, you always be -- you -- you know, just\nme going to school for home economics with girls who had gone [indecipherable] to\nschool -- to high school. I didn\u2019t fit in, you know? In the evening school, the evening high\nschool, I didn\u2019t fit in either. So, it was kind of an -- we tried desperately to kind of live a\nnormal life, but I think in Holland, we couldn\u2019t really do it. There were too many -- it -- it\n-- it was just so -- 1t was such a destruction of the Jews that w-we constantly were\nreminded of it, even if you don\u2019t want just to really face it on, [indecipherable] see it, but\nwe were constantly reminded of it. And my uncle, and my aunt, and my -- my cousins\nwere -- were killed in a concentration camp. So, I didn\u2019t have family. My -- Luckily, my\ngrandparents, and my uncles also survived the war. They were just caught maybe two\ndays before the liberation, and they didn\u2019t know what to do with two old people. And my\nuncle, they put him in prison, and then the Germans left, and so my -- then -- then they\nwere freed. But it was just at the last moment that they were caught, and -- and like I said,\nthe Germans didn\u2019t quite know what to do with them because the war was almost over. I-\nIt -- What I remember, the best part of our lives was then the Zionist organization where\nwe all came together with those who survived, and had weekends of -- you know, like\ncamp -- like studying, and we danced, and we sang, and we talked every night. We all\nwanted to go to Israel. My brother was called up to go to Indonesia, because that\u2019s -- in\n1946, they were going to fight to keep Indonesia at that time, the Dutch East Indies\nindependent. And the Jewish -- many of the Jewish survivors, young men, didn\u2019t go, and\nthey went on illegal alleyah to -- to Israel. And my -- So my brother left -- I guess 1t was\nin 19 -- maybe 1946, or so -- earlier than that, to southern France, and -- and then went, I\ndon\u2019t know, maybe stayed there. The whole trip was like three months, and then he went\non one of those boats illegally to Israel, and he was -- he was on the last boat that\n[indecipherable] was caught, but went all the way to Israel, and went into an -- in a camp.\nHe didn\u2019t go -- The next boat went to Cyprus [indecipherable]. So he has been, since\n1946 [indecipherable]. So -- So my mother and I were left. I met Ed in the -- in Zionist\norganization. He left in -- Yeah, go ahead.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t talk about it, wh-what it did for us was we -- we knew that we had the same\nexperience. We didn\u2019t talk about it, but we knew, we -- it felt comfortable. It didn\u2019t feel\ncomfortable with the non-Jewish youngsters because they had -- didn\u2019t have such a\ndisruption in their lives as we had had, and they didn\u2019t have so many losses in their lives\nas we had had. They said they suffered terribly in -- in -- in the war, but it -- they didn\u2019t\nquite understand what happened to us, that when you -- when we came out of the war, we\ncouldn\u2019t go home, because there was no home any more. Our -- To go back\n[indecipherable] that it seems that as soon as we went into hiding, they emptied our\napartment, and all the furniture, everything was gone, in no time. You know, they just\nemptied it out. So, we didn\u2019t have a place to go back to, so to be with them was\nwonderful, wonderful. And then the other thing that was wonderful, we had the Israeli\nsoldiers, who were in the British brigade, came also to Holland, and they represented\nhealthy young men who had fought in the second World War, and were not persecuted,\nand so they were like symbols of health, and -- and -- and was wonderful. And many of\nour friends went with them back to Israel. Some got married, they fell in love, got\nmarried, some married [indecipherable] you know, just to bring somebody into Israel\nwithout being -- I forgot what [indecipherable] in -- in the -- something that they were\nallowed to go into as well, so our friends also disappeared, you know, like my brother, he\nwent illegally to Israel, so even in those times, people went -- left us. They kind of, you\nknow they went to Israel, and -- and then I, like I said, I met Ed. Ed left in June of 1947,\nand we didn\u2019t quite know if we were going to get married, or not, but we were going to\nkind of see if -- the separation, if it lasted through writing. I completed my schools there,\nand I -- we got a visa for United States because -- very quickly, because my mother was\nGerman born, and the quota for German born people was very low, compared to the\nDutch, and I was underage, too, so I left for the United States in January of \u201949, which\nwas quite something, because we really didn\u2019t want to go to the United States, really\nwanted to go to Israel, but I want to get married to Ed, so I had to go first to United\nStates, before I could go to Israel.",
        "A: There was really very little in Holland for us. Looking back now, it -- it didn\u2019t feel\ncomfortable any more. There were very few Jews at that time. I don\u2019t know what -- I\ndon\u2019t think we saw a future in Holland. Course you have to remember, the Zionists, so\nthere was only a future in Israel. You didn\u2019t even want to even consider that there was a\nfuture in -- in -- in Holland. And we would just go to United States to kind of go there,\nand then go to Israel, which we did in *51. The period in -- in -- in -- here in United\nStates, between \u00b049 -- for me from \u00b049 until \u2019?51 was kind of strange. I don\u2019t know. We\ngot married six weeks after I came to the States, it was the smallest wedding you can\nimagine, there were -- you know, there were five people at this ceremony, with the justice\nof peace, and seven people at the lunch. Course we didn\u2019t have -- everybody was poor,\nand we didn\u2019t have family. Ed went back to work, he had a job there, I went with him to -\n- it was in Ossening, New York.",
        "A: Strange, well, because I never really wanted to go, probably, and it was -- was kind of\nanother disruption, and we really didn\u2019t want to stay, so it was like a vacation here, but\nnot quite, because we had to live a daily life, and -- and again, I had a hard time\nconnecting. I realize that now, I didn\u2019t realize that then. I wasn\u2019t like the other American\nkids who were 19 years old and had gotten married, I di -- hadn\u2019t gone to school here. I\nhad a strong accent, I didn\u2019t know the ways of you -- you know the ways of the\nAmericans. So it -- it felt as if I didn\u2019t belong, which I -- I didn\u2019t belong, really. I\neventually went to work [indecipherable] to make some money, go to Israel. That felt a\nlittle better because I -- I worked, and my days were structured. I didn\u2019t work there very\nlong. I was a filing clerk, I knew foreign geography, so I had a special assignment. Was --\nI think at that time I always wanted to go to Israel, that\u2019s [indecipherable]. Also, my\nfriends had gone there, you know, fr-friends from Holland. We went in 1951 to Israel,\nbecause Ed was about to be called up for the Korean war, and so he left before he got\nenlisted for the Korean war. I -- We arrived in late January of \u201951 in Israel, we went to\nthe kibbutz where my brother was, and I felt really very good there. I had my first child\nwas born in December of \u201951, 1t was for me a very good time [indecipherable]. I was a\nworker, a mother, and a member of the kibbutz. I had voting rights, which was very\nunusual as a woman. I fitted in. There were other people from Holland, which, you know,\nwe had the little group of Dutch people, not that we always spoke Dutch, I don\u2019t think so,\nbut we had the same background, so I was really appreciated as a -- as a worker, I was --\nworked with babies, and with the toddlers, and I had my own group, and that was -- that\nwas a good time. Our child got sick, she had tuberculosis of the lymph nodes, here,\nlymph, and that was a horrible time, she was 1n the hospital for six months, and then she\nneeded to be separated still from other people. That was horrendous. Ed was not very\nhappy in -- in the kibbutz, it was very difficult for him to kind of fit in that -- in that kind\nof rigid structure.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Ed was less happy. He had a hard time with -- like I said, rigid structure. Also, at that\ntime, there was very -- what can I say, little chance for anybody to do any -- anything\ndifferent than what you were assigned to do. To get, for instance, go to Haifa to take a\npainting course, I as -- I remember was somebody want to do that, that had to go through\nmany, many people, it had to be okayed by the general meeting. I mean, everything was -\n- nowadays you could do it easily, you could go and study, but in those days it was a --\nmore of the pioneer times. So we decided to -- Ed decided really, and I kind of agreed, to\ngo back to the United States for a couple of years, because E-Ed I think, might have been\none of the very few people who had not one relative in Israel. I had, besides my brother\nand my sister-in-law, I me -- they had one child at that time, I had an uncle, a maternal\nuncle and aunt, and a cousin in Israel. So I had a little bit of family in Israel, but he had\nnone. So that was a difficult period because we went back, and that, of course, in those\ndays, was very, very bad that you go back to the United States. You were kind of a\ndeserter. And we couldn\u2019t go back to the States, because my daughter had had\ntuberculosis, we could go back to Holland. So we decided -- we couldn\u2019t enter the United\nStates because she had had tuberculosis, we decided to go to Holland. And we stayed for\none year in Holland, she was then healthy enough to go. The American embassy let us\ngo, gave us a visa. The year in Holland, and that was in 1955 - \u201956, was kind of a\nvacation for us. We went to Holland knowing that we\u2019re not going to stay, we kind of\nenjoyed it. Ed went to work, I took care of our daughter. We had some old friends there,\nit was familiar, we spoke the language. And we knew it was only going to be a short\nperiod of time. So we arrived here in the United States in October of \u201956. Let\u2019s see, Ed\nhad an -- h-his grandfather lived in Amsterdam, so we had a little bit of family in Holland\nwhen we were there. We arrived October \u00b056, in the United States, again.",
        "A: Yeah, we were going to go back to Israel in -- after a few years. I -- I -- I didn\u2019t really\nwant to go to the United States. That never happened. He started -- Ed found a job here\nwhere -- in the neighborhood where we lived, in Dobb\u2019s Ferry. My daughter went to\nschool, went to kindergarten and Dan was born in \u201958. Ed went to evening school, to\nPratt Institute. So, we kind of led this normal family life, where the husband g-goes to\nwork, and he went to school at night, and I took care of the children, and -- and we tried\nto live kind of an -- a normal life, as Holocaust survivors. It was more normal than when\nwe did not have children, because you know, you have to -- you have children, you have\nmore contact with the other people, because the -- like my daughter went to kindergarten,\nand we met some other people whose children went to kindergarten, or she brought\ngirlfriends home, and I met the parents, and so that was more often a normal life,\nalthough it was a difficult life, cause Ed was away a lot, going to school, and then that he\nhad a lot of homework and so on. And we didn\u2019t have a lot of money, we had very little\nmoney. That time I see as -- 1t was kind of a good time, having th-the children, and\nhaving contact with other people. We then moved from Dobb\u2019s Ferry, actually to here.\nThat was in 1963, Ed had just graduated from Pratt Institute, and my daughter went to\njunior high, and our son went to kindergarten here. And we were not involved at all with\nsurvivors, except my whole family. My mother was a -- is a -- you know, was a survivor,\nshe w-worked in New York City, my in-laws were survivors, they lived in Springfield,\nMassachusetts. My -- My two brothers-in-law were, you know, they -- they went to\ncollege. Like I said, my children were surrounded by survivors, they grew up with\nsurvivors, that\u2019s -- was their family. I went to college too, in 1967, to community college,\nWestchester Community College, completed that, went to Mercy College, the Catholic\nCollege right near here, completed my Bachelor\u2019s degree. Trying to catch up, because I\nreally wanted to do something, but I didn\u2019t have the degrees. Before that, I was an\nassistant nursery school teacher. I worked part time when Dan was five years old. So I\nworked from, he was five, \u201963 to I went to -- full time to Columbia School of Social\nWork in s -- I worked for 10 years, \u201973 I went there. So I worked for 10 years as an\nassistant nursery school teacher, because I didn\u2019t have a degree. That was nice.",
        "A: No, not really. Actually -- Ash -- Ed pushed me, said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go to school?\u201d\nAnd so I did, and I really enjoyed going to school, enjoyed very much going to social\nwork school, although again, it was kind of -- I don\u2019t think there was any survivor in my\nclass. There were lots of young people who had gone to Ivy League schools, and I\nrealized that my education was far less solid than their education, that my papers were not\nvery well written. But at that time, I was very lucky, Columbia Unis -- University School\nof Social Work had never ax -- never had accepted ex -- very, very few older people. And\nwhen I applied, they had -- they had to accept older people, so I was accepted, with some\nother older people. I was already in my 40\u2019s. So I was lucky at that time. Social work\nschool was interesting, because I was placed in -- my first internship was 1n an Protestant\nfoster care agency, and there was a woman there who was, I thought that she was a little\nanti-Semitic, and -- well, a lot anti-Semitic, and which happened, I would almost say to\nbe true. She -- The -- I was in the student unit, and there were two Orthodox Jewish\nstudent -- social work students, and one was taking off all the holidays, and she was kind\nof punished for that, she eventually had to leave. And there were other things that\nhappened that were kind of what I felt was anti-Semitic, and I feel very -- I felt very\nuncomfortable, and was about to quit, but I said, \u201cI can\u2019t. I -- I need to get a social work\ndegree. I must -- I must stay and -- and -- and conquer this.\u201d And I did, 1n a very -- it was,\nI felt, a very hostile environment. I finished the first year, but tha-that really was -- was\nvery hard on me. The second year, luckily, I was placed in an -- in another place where\nthere -- I had a Jewish supervisor, so she couldn\u2019t be anti-Semitic.",
        "A: I think I wasn\u2019t aware of it, that I -- it -- it was always there. I was always different,\nlike I was saying to you, when I went to social work school, and all these young -- young\nS -- young men, women, who had gone to the very good schools. I mean, I had nothing --\nand I was older. I had nothing 1n common with them. Even the ones who were maybe in\ntheir late 20\u2019s and early 30\u2019s had -- I don\u2019t think there was anyone who had gone through\n-- through what I had gone through. No [indecipherable] interest, somebody would say,\nyou know, where you come from, I said from Holland, and okay so, interesting, I like\nHolland, I like Amsterdam. They would say to me, \u201cPeople are friendly in Holland?\u201d\nAnd you know, that was about it. People were not really interested, as I recall. I might\nalso have given them messages that I didn\u2019t want to talk about it. So, 1t wasn\u2019t really -- it\nwas a -- aS you say, how much was my identi -- I wasn\u2019t so much aware of it, but 1t was\nalways there. I always felt different. And if people were asking, and -- about maybe you\nknow, where were you in the war, and in hiding, I didn\u2019t want to talk about it, because it\nfelt uncomfortable. It felt uncomfortable because -- and it -- over and over and over\nagain, I noticed that when I started to talk about it, people became very serious, and some\npeople kind of looked at me, and they became sad when I was talking about it. And I felt\nI inflicted pain on them, rather than not -- not inflict pain. That\u2019s really what I always saw\nwhen I would talk about it, and you know, when I would say, you know. If somebody\nwould say to -- how -- \u201cWhat happened to you when you were a teenager?\u201d You know,\n\u201cWere you allowed to wear silk stockings?\u201d I mean, when I was a teenager, I was in\nhiding. I mean, or you know, it was such -- it was funny bizarre, if you know\n[indecipherable] these questions. I was glad to have socks, you know? So, how could I\nexplain this to them, that you know, or that the main thing was that you know, in the\nmorning that there was a piece of bread with maybe a little bit marmalade on it. That was\n-- That was wonderful, but going out --",
        "A: About --",
        "A: Like I said, it was always there. I can\u2019t recall. I spoke less about it. When I took my\ndaughter in 19 -- in -- when was it, 1976, how old was she then? Yeah, 1976 to -- to\nIsrael, and then later on to Holland, and introduced her to my rescuers. I mean, there was\nalways something going on, but it wasn\u2019t very open, you know? I introduced my daughter\nto my -- actually when we were in Holland the first time, she knew already my rescuers,\nso -- and then we went again in \u201976, we again mes -- met my rescuers. We t -- also took\nour son to Israel, and to -- to Holland, and all -- France. He also met my rescuers. So it --\nit was always there, but it wasn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t a -- they never asked, tell me now from the\nbeginning, you know, what happened. There were little funny stories sometimes, that we\ntalked about. The interesting thing is our son spoke at our anniversary party, and he kind\nof said that when he was a teenager, he realized that his parents were different from other\nparents. Something -- He didn\u2019t realize when he was a kid, but he realized that we didn\u2019t\nknow a lot about baseball, or all these -- foo -- or football. He didn\u2019t realize that, but later\non he realized that we had a different history than his par -- than the parents of his\nAmerican friends. So it was there, always, with our children, because not only that, my\nmother-in-law had been in Bergen-Belsen, and my father-in-law always kind of protected\nher, because she had been in Bergen-Belsen, she had suffered more than us. My father-in-\nlaw, and my brothers-in-law, and Ed were in hiding. My mother-in-law had suffered\nmore than an-anyone else, so it was always there, it was kind of there, and -- but not a\nwhole lot of -- talked about. The kids knew, and it -- it -- 1t was there, yes. You know,\neverybody had an accent, to start out with. You know, my -- my mother, my mother-in-\nlaw, my father-in-law, not my younger brothers-in-law. S -- He -- They knew they were\nchildren of immigrants, and -- and they were n -- interesting if -- is that my son\u2019s best\nfriend was a -- I don\u2019t know exactly when his father came, his father was an immigrant. I\ndon\u2019t know if his father came in late 30\u2019s or early 40\u2019s. Father was originally born in\nRussia, went to France, and came here wh -- I don\u2019t know if he was a survivor, but\nmaybe a refugee. My daughter\u2019s very best friend father escaped from Poland, came here\nthe United States. I don\u2019t know ex -- he probably was a refugee. And so there 1s\nsomething that they got connected up with people who had a similar background. They\ndidn\u2019t quite know, I mean, what it was, they just kind of discovered it later, that this was\nthe -- the attraction, or the connection that they had with -- with their friends. My\ndaughter, later on, when she moved up to -- near Peekskill, across the road was another\nfamily, a young family, and th -- and she was a daughter of a hol -- of hol -- two\nHolocaust survivors. Best friends still, today. So something is, you know, they get\nconnected with people who have a similar family history.",
        "A: Actually, in the early -- in the early 80 -- actually, probably late 70\u2019s, or early 80\u2019s, I\nbecome more aware that I was different, that I had been in hiding, and there must be a lot\nof people who were in h -- had been in hiding, right around here, but I couldn\u2019t get to\nthem, and since I was a social worker, and was a group -- also a group worker, I said, I --\nI should maybe get this support group together. And what I did was I called the Dutch\nconsulate, and I knew that other Dutch Jewish immigrants were in -- had been registered\nthere. And so -- And luckily, the woman I spoke to was a social worker, so she knew\nwhat I was talking about. And I ask her if I could send -- if she would send a letter from\nme to people she knew who had been in the war in Holland, Jewish people who had been\nin war in Holland, and if they would then contact me, maybe we could meet. And so I\nstarted a support group, I think it was in 1982, of Dutch Holocaust survivors who had\nbeen in hiding. And the difficulty was that I th -- that we came from New York City,\nWestchester county, New Jersey -- I had k-kind of asked her to send letters to the me --\nmetropolitan area. And we met the first time was kind of an interesting [indecipherable]\nmaybe 20 people in -- in New York City. We met, and there were older people who had\nbeen in hiding, and younger ones, like people who had been in hiding when they were in\ntheir 20\u2019s. And one man said immediately, he said, \u201cYou know, we don\u2019t need a group,\nwe know who we are, but you youngsters, you were children and teenagers, you didn\u2019t ha\n-- you really didn\u2019t have an identity. You suffered more than we did, because we had an\nidentity.\u201d And he wasn\u2019t so wrong, but I couldn\u2019t quite understand what this was all\nabout. And so we met another two years with the people who were younger, because the\nolder people said you know, that we don\u2019t want the group, and so on. We had this -- I had\nthis support group with younger people who were children and teenagers in the war. And\nthat was very interesting, only difficult -- we had a difficult time to find a place to meet,\nand -- and that kind of -- like I said, it was two years, that was until 1984. And so we had\n-- | ha -- I realized that y -- I found people I had something in common with. I think what\n-- maybe what I\u2019m not talking about 1s that we really kind of led a so-called normal social\nlife here, in -- in resh -- here in Hastings. You know, we went out, we had friends, we had\ndinner parties, but it -- it -- plus we were always a little different. It wasn\u2019t that we were\ncompletely isolated from -- from -- you know, from our neighbors, or the parents of our\nfriends, or friends we had made on our own. But it wasn\u2019t like -- we didn\u2019t quite belong,\nit -- I can tell you, we were at the dinner party, and people had invited some friends, and\nthere were like a couple of couples, and there were two couples who didn\u2019t know each\nother, and then they found out that they grew up on you know, in the same neighborhood\nin the Bronx, and all of a sudden, they had such a strong connection, even, to you know, I\ndon\u2019t know which one it was, Public PS whatever, and do you know that, you know, this\none, and do you know that one, and what did you play in the street, stickball, and you\nknow, we didn\u2019t do this, whatever they played. And I realized, I never can meet anybody\nwho I went to school with. So these kind of things did happen, and I felt very kind of\nisolated, and when the -- when do I ever meet somebody I went to school with? So, I\nguess what I wanted to say to you is we kind of led an -- an -- a normal social life here,\nbut felt different, because we had gone through the war. When we -- When I had the s-\nsupport group of Dutch Hidden Children, we had some connection, I had some\nconnection. And in the meantime, I had become a Social Worker, and I was working as a\nSocial Worker, and -- which was -- I -- I -- I loved my work, and -- but I didn\u2019t have the\nsame background as they had, although, you know, I was very well integrated in my, you\nknow, professional community, of where I worked, at work, you know, there was -- | -- I\n-- I felt pretty -- pretty comfortable there. Then, in ni -- 1980 -- 1990, we did our\ninterview in -- in -- in Washington, and it\u2019s a very complicated story how we -- how they\n-- how we found them, and how they found us. We did go for a weekend to Washingt --\nto be int -- to Washington to be interviewed, and I forgot ex -- was a terribly rainy day,\nand it wasn\u2019t in the museum yet, because the museum wasn\u2019t there yet, 1t was somewhere\nelse in the studio. And I remember that I watched -- watched Ed on a monitor, but not in\nthe same room, and he watched me on a monitor, and we were completely wiped out after\nwe had told the whole story. It was really from -- you probably saw -- you saw the video,\nso it was from early years, and then into -- into the war years. And we were absolutely\nemotionally exhausted. And that was really the very first time that I had told my whole\nstory. I -- I even now get, you know, very moved about it, and I don\u2019t know why. So that\nwas in 1990. At the same time -- at the same -- around that time, one of my colleagues\ngave me an -- he said, \u201cYou know, you might be,\u201d -- I had spoken with him, I guess,\nabout my background. He gave me an announcement of an -- of a conference in -- in New\nYork City, about the psycho-his -- the psycho-history association gave an -- an -- an -- an\n-- an -- an conference for children of the Holocaust. And it was -- he said, \u201cYou might be\ninterested.\u201d So, I said, \u201cYeah, I might be interested to do that.\u201d So I went there, I took a\nday off, I went to that seminar, and there was a whole row of people there sitting behind a\ntable, and -- and I was there, and I -- you know, somebody was going to listen to all these\npapers they were going to present. And I listened to the papers they were presenting there\nall about -- they were very professional and they had done a lot of research on children of\nthe Holocaust. And all I heard was kids who had been in a concentration camp. And I, at\none time I wanted to ask -- I ask a question to these professional people, was -- one was\nJudith Kastneberg, and some others, Eva Fogelman, and some others, and I ask a\nquestion, if they had done any research on children who ha -- children of the Holocaust\nwho had been in hiding. And they said no, they hadn\u2019t, they don\u2019t have any data on that.\nAnd somebody in the back heard my question, and came over to me, and she says, \u201cYou\nhave been in hiding?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cYou know, we are planning a conference for\nHolocaust survivors who had been in hiding, or children who had -- Holocaust survivors\nwho had been in hiding, are you interested?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes, I\u2019m interested.\u201d So, we\nexchanged telephone numbers, and she said, and there\u2019s a meeting whenever, to -- in one\nweek or two week. I went to that first meet -- for me that first meeting, of children -- wh-\nwhich was -- which was later called Hidden Children of the Holocaust. And they p --\nwere planning a conference from the Memorial Day weekend of \u201991. And so I started to\nwork with them, and I said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m a social worker, I can plan workshops.\u201d And\nso I got connected to this group of people who all were -- had been in hiding, and -- and\nwherever, Poland, France, Belgium, not one from Holland. And we started to work on\nthis conference, which was very intense, and regular, you know, meetings, and planning,\nand shouting, and arguing, and -- and was very interesting. And I started my work,\ngetting workshop leaders together, I got -- you know, there were lots of people who had\nbeen in hiding, who were in the mental health profession, so I had no problem finding\npsychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, in this country, or overseas, or in Holland, or\nin England, or in Israel, I mean there were lots of them. So I began my work with the\nHidden Children, and in a ki -- in a sense, I found my community. I -- I did things I had\nnever done before. I didn\u2019t know anything about how to organize workshops, but I did. I -\n- | -- You know, we made all kinds of decisions about -- about the conference, how\nconfidential it should be, who should -- what we -- we -- we planned workshops, we had\nto give names, you know, we had to find out what was -- what would be appropriate\nworkshop for people who had been in hiding as children. And we came up with all kinds\nof -- you know, we got some consultants, there\u2019s a psychiatrist in -- in Vancouver, who\nwas a hidi -- had been in hiding as a child, who had been very involved in child survivors\nof the Holocaust, so we -- we contacted him, and we -- we got all the names for the\nworkshops, and -- and titles for the workshops, really. We had to read up on it, you know,\nlike abandonment, trust, you know, relationships, all these problems of -- of people\nhaving because of the Holocaust, and the experiences they went through.",
        "A: From my own exp -- oh, it was wonderful to do it in that way. Was great, I mean, I --\nwell, don\u2019t forget, I have been in psychotherapy -- I ha -- in -- in therapy since ni -- I was\nin therapy already since 1979. 1970, I had been in therapy, so I mean, I could look into --\nintellectually in -- in a way that -- cause I had my -- you know, I had done some work in\ntherapy. There was -- I think what happened that you felt kind of a little control, and a\nlittle power, to do it like that, you know. It wasn\u2019t that easy when people talked about it,\nyou know, when other people talked about how they were abandoned by their mother,\nwhen their mother waved them goodbye, or when they were placed in a convent, you\nknow, I mean that -- that wasn\u2019t easy to kind of listen to. But to plan it, wonderful. I still -\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Go ahead.",
        "A: Chronologically, right.",
        "A: You know, you talked about how was it intellectually, you know, you can do all these\nworkshops, you know, that -- the titles of the workshops, and you can talk about\nabandonment, and all this kind of stuff, and the -- the interesting thing is that when I have\nwritten a -- a paper about the vanished culture of Holocaust survivors, and I was just\ngoing to be published this summer, and I write about it, that there are other therapies for\nHolocaust survivors, other than individual and group therapy. There -- Such as giving a\ntestimony in a chronological order, not only that you\u2019re going to validated, but somebody\nis listening, and that your -- for whatever hours it is, to your story, rather than to just a\nbrief segment, and -- but that you are being validated, that you go through it, that it is\nyour story, that -- and not only I say that it is, you know, therapeutically very important\nfor anyone to tell their whole story, chronologically, other professionals, I mean I -- it\u2019s\nnot my inve -- you know, I didn\u2019t find that out, I -- I read that over and over again, from\nother professionals. It is -- I didn\u2019t realize that it was so important. Not that I\u2019m watching\nmy video, I never look at it, I -- you know, but it\u2019s there, and we gave it to our children,\nas a document. And you can see I get -- every time [indecipherable] and I don\u2019t know\nwhy. Because I have kept it -- You know, one of the workshops we have, keeping --\nkeeping a secret, I -- I actually did the workshop, keeping -- keeping a secret, and this 1s\nwhat we really have done, because we wanted to lead a normal life. And we succeeded.\nYou know, we had -- we had a family, we had children, we went to the PTA meetings,\nwe went -- we went on vacations with our children, but there was so much else. So, I\nthink that when I did this interview, in a sense, for the first time somebody listened, and\nasked me questions. Like I said, I was -- I s -- I was -- I was validated, it was -- it\nappeared to be a very important document. And when I so casually said, you know, they\ntake a little s -- you know, a little piece out of, then put it on the -- I wasn\u2019t pleased with\nwhat they took out at the museum, but it\u2019s there, and -- and you know, when my -- my --\none of my daughter\u2019s friends went to the museum, and she said, \u201cI saw your mother on\nthe -- you know, on th -- on the -- on the video.\u201d Or -- And somebody else said, \u201cI looked\nfor you on the video.\u201d Something happened, something -- and like I said, something -- the\nstory that I kept hidden all these years is now out in the open. So, I think that\u2019s important.\nIt\u2019s -- It seems to be more important than writing 1t down, because when I -- when I wrote\nmy paper, or -- or when I spoke, you know at some conferences about it, it isn\u2019t the same.\nIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m talking about myself in the paper, but it\u2019s about Holocaust survivors and\ntheir losses, and their -- the -- the terrible harm that it has done to people who have been\nin the Holocaust emotionally, and how people have continuously to suffer, some more,\nsome less, and you know, s -- most of us every day think about the Holocaust in -- in a\nvery -- Sometimes just a minute, you know, or -- or sometimes longer, but there\u2019s always\na reminder, something. There\u2019s always in your life a reminder of the -- those years that\nwe were in hiding, or even before. See, you must have seen in my video, that when I was\nin Germany with my grandparents, I already was persecuted there in a s -- in a sense,\nbecause I couldn\u2019t -- like [indecipherable] and my grandfather said, \u201cOh, you may not\nspeak loudly, you may -- don\u2019t -- don\u2019t draw any attention to yourself.\u201d And I saw -- you\nknow, I saw the SS already marching around. So I grew up with -- for a long time since\n1936 until 1945. So I -- My -- My -- My whole life until 1945 was the Holocaust really,\nyou know? So when it is -- when I gathered -- when -- you were asking about the video, I\nthink 1t was very important for me, and that I had a -- like I said, it\u2019s been -- it\u2019s stored\naway, and I don\u2019t think of it.",
        "A: No, I actually -- maybe to know that it\u2019s there. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to\nit when I\u2019m not here any more, but it\u2019s there. And -- And -- And there are so many\n[indecipherable] I don\u2019t know how important -- it\u2019s important for my family, my\ncountrymen. We were a -- a -- I don\u2019t know if you know, we were also interviewed by\nJane Marks, who published the book, \u201cHidden Children: Secret Survivors of the\nHolocaust.\u201d I don\u2019t know if you know that. And our stories is in that book, and -- and\npeople read our story. It\u2019s -- It wasn\u2019t so intense as the one in the -- you know, in 1990.\nThis was after the conferences she did this. Actually, in February of \u201991, I was\ninterviewed by New York Magazine, and I also told my story there, and it was published\nin the New York Magazine, with five others who were in hiding. That wasn\u2019t as\nimportant to me as the -- as the video. You know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- I\u2019m in a magazine, you\nknow, so -- and my story 1s in there, so people read it. It didn\u2019t have the depth of it, you\nknow? Because he edited it, of course, a lot, you know?",
        "A: Now I don\u2019t know. I -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know exactly what it is. I -- I guess I don\u2019t\nwant to minimize this, but I guess the video makes it more real, because I\u2019m there, I\u2019m\ntalking. But it is printed, it\u2019s kind of I have given it away, you know? And -- And the\nperson who interviewed me, and edited it, it becomes more her story. I don\u2019t know, I -- I\ndid something with it that I don\u2019t know I want -- I don\u2019t know what I did with it. It\u2019s\nreally what -- what -- what this video did for me. Is there anything else that you\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Not Jewish as a religious person, Jewish as [indecipherable] people. One experience I\nremember 1s that when I was in hiding in the second -- with the second family, maybe a\nyear into that, so let\u2019s say that 19 - 1943 - 1944, at one time I realized I don\u2019t understand\nthat I -- I, or any -- or my mother, my brother, had to go through this. Cause we were kind\nof innocent people, we didn\u2019t harm anybody. And if there was a god, why -- why did He\ndo this? Why did He do this to us, and to the other Jews? And in particularly there was\nround -- when we -- we -- before the war, there was a Jewish family around the corner,\nthey had two very small children, babies, and they -- somehow we knew that they were\nnot in hiding, I don\u2019t know why, but that they were shipped -- that they went to -- to the\ncamps, and I just could remember these little girls, and [indecipherable] what happened\nto them, and -- and you know, that they would not sleep in their own beds, and they\nwould be somewhere in -- in Westerbork, and I don\u2019t know what would happen to them,\nwe didn\u2019t quite know what happened to them. These little kids, you know? Horrible,\nwhen I think about it. So I -- I -- At the time when I was in hiding, I think about\n[indecipherable] of God. Why, why did He put us here? I mean, in hiding, we afraid\nevery day for your life, and for the other people\u2019s lives. So, I kind of said, I -- I don\u2019t es --\nI don\u2019t believe there is a God. And I still don\u2019t -- I mean, I\u2019m still struggling with this in a\nsense, because I don\u2019t know how this all happened around me. But we are not religious.\nWe celebrate Hanukah, and Pesach, and Rosh Hashanah, mo-more as a -- as a tradition,\nand as ee -- having a Jewish identity, not necessarily religious identity. And we were also\n[indecipherable], so we got kind of an -- a different identity. When you go to Israel, you -\n- you don\u2019t need to be religious to be Jewish. So, our children were not Bar Mitzvahed,\nand Bat Mitzvahed, we have never belonged to -- to a temple, we are not affiliated. But\nwhen my mother -- before my mother died, I went to a - to the temple down here, it\u2019s a\nReform temple, went to the rabbi, if he wanted to do a service, and he said yes. And when\nmy mother died, I went down there, and he did the service -- graveside service, you\nknow? So there is some -- I think it is more -- my Jewishness is more connected to\ntradition, and to the Jewish people, rather than to religion. I went a little bit to Hebrew\nschool in Holland, but that was not a very good experience, because my mother sent us to\nshul on the holidays, and she usually didn\u2019t go, and -- and it was very boring, and it was\nall in Hebrew, and we didn\u2019t understand anything, and -- and -- you know, the men were\nthere, and the women were upstairs, and it was not a good experience. So, I guess you get\nthe picture.",
        "A: Oh. I think what we all -- most of us who went through the war wanted to lead a\nnormal life, which meant getting married, and having children, although there are many --\nquite a few hidden children who never got married because they\u2019re -- they\n[indecipherable] had a terrible hard time with relationships. With -- I got married when I\nwas 19, and -- and I think that\u2019s the most important thing, to have a family lead so called\na normal life, have -- our -- both our children got married, they both have two children.\nIt\u2019s amazing. I mean, that -- that this happened after we were not supposed to be here. So\nwhen -- when we had our anniversary, and yo-you know, months ago, there were our\nchildren and our grandchildren. Unbelievable, you know\u201d So I think that\u2019s -- th-the -- the\naccomplishment that we -- I\u2019m most proud of. And they seem to -- a little -- I\u2019m -- our\nchildren are affected by our Holocaust experience, they seem to be managing quite well.\nMy daughter is married for 23 years. Our son is married for 10 years, more than 10 years.\nSo somehow we have instilled in our children that family is important. They\u2019re good\nparents, they are extremely good parents, sometimes a little too permissive, but they\u2019re\ngood parents, they love their children very much. And you see it every day, you know?\nThey -- So, I think that that\u2019s my proudest accomplishment.",
        "A: To what? To family?",
        "A: Oh. Oh, the -- you want to know a little bit? How much more do we have?",
        "A: Well, the -- the -- the mo -- the other important thing is that -- I was telling you about\nworking on the Hidden Child conference, and that we did have the conference, and it was\nan incredible success. We had -- We had expected 300 - 400 people, there was 1600\npeople and we didn\u2019t know what to do, the people in the workshops, that were like\nworkshops -- 75 people [indecipherable] you know, the workshops [indecipherable]. But\nit was such a success, and it changed many people\u2019s lives, including my husband\u2019s,\nwhich you probably will hear on tape. It changed because people found each other,\nconnected with each other, and what we did after the conference, we started support\ngroups, and I\u2019m still running a support group here in Westchester county. We just had a\nmeeting yesterday. So that\u2019s from August of \u201991 until now, is eight years, we run -- once\na month we have a meeting. It\u2019s not always easy, but we do have a meeting, and I have\nbeen working since then for the Hidden Child Foundation, which is the organization, and\nin the last few years since I retired from the clinic, and I only working part time at night,\nprivate practice, I am working with Holocaust -- needy Holocaust survivors. What I\u2019m\ndoing is trying to help them connect with resources, financial or psychological resources,\nso that they don\u2019t continue to suffer unnecessarily. And that keeps me quite busy. I go\nonce a week to New York City, and I work with -- I -- with agencies, or with the\nHolocaust survivors. They don\u2019t [indecipherable] to have been in hiding, anyone --\nanyone who was in concentration camp, or child of Holocaust survivors who are needy\nfor whatever, psychological services, or financial services, I will connect them up with\nwhatever 1s available. So, that fills kind of, my life. This is not all, you know, because I s-\nspend about two -- two and a half days in my private practice. I have my family,\nwhenever they want to come over [indecipherable] we always there. But it is a major part\nof my life to be involved in Holocaust survivors, and their -- their needs, or just maybe a\nparty or an -- an -- like we had yesterday a brunch, where people get together and\nconnect, because that\u2019s really one of the most important things for the survivors, to\nconnect with others. So -- Because, for instance, with hiding, we understand what it\nmeans -- when I talk to somebody else who has been in hiding, I know what it means to\nbe -- have been in hiding, and have your schooling interrupted, your family life\ninterrupted, your friendships interrupted, everything interrupted, I never was normal\nagain after that.",
        "A: Well, Ed wasn\u2019t involved in the planning of the conference. I did -- I kind of dragged\nhim along. And then he got involved very much when -- with the sh -- with the Shoah\nFoundation, when he started to do the interviews, he got very involved, which is only I\nthink the last three years or so. I don\u2019t know -- I am involved because I think I can\ncontribute. It\u2019s my community. Although socially we don\u2019t get together, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s an\ninteresting contradiction. I can work with them, but socially, you know, with a few, but\nnot with the whole -- with all the people that I am in contact with. I can only -- it -- it -- it\nfeels -- it feels good to -- to do this. It -- I ha -- kind of -- I can contribute because I\u2019m a\nsocial worker, ca -- ca -- I can do the work, it\u2019s not difficult for me to do this. I -- I can\u2019t\nreally tell you why -- it -- it -- it just -- that\u2019s what I need to do. I can also tell you that I\nnever was a member of any organization before this. I never was a member of Hadassah,\nI never was a member of, like I say, of the temple. I never was a member of any\norganization before I got connected to the Hidden Child Foundation. I didn\u2019t belong, I\ndidn\u2019t feel comfortable, I -- I me -- I mean, I am now a member of the Clinical Social\nWork Society, I go to their meetings, but it\u2019s not the same, it\u2019s a professional\norganization.
