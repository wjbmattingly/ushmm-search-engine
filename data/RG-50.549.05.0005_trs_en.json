        "Q: Just to test the tape, we\u2019re going to talk about what you think of the weather so far this summer.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s pretty hot, hazy and humid, the way the weather forecast says. I love Louisville. I\ndon\u2019t like the humidity right here. But last week it was lovely, for a week, for a few days and it\u2019s\ngetting hot again. But I don\u2019t think that bothers me that much. Nowadays you can get away\nfrom it if you want to, except right now, because of the air conditioned cars and the air condition,\nso... 1S that enough? That you wanted to...",
        "Q: That\u2019s fine.",
        "A: And now you\u2019re going to listen to it?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, I have a horrible feeling and I\u2019m sure everybody who you talk to say, I know what\nmy accent is like, but when you hear it, it sounds horrible.",
        "Q: Oh, I love it.",
        "A: And you don\u2019t want to believe that it sounds that bad, but I mean, you know, I have it. So you\ncannot deny it.",
        "Q: Well, I think people tend to... (tape goes off and on)",
        "Q: It\u2019s July the 15\", 1999 and I\u2019m with Ann Low Klein in her home in Louisville, Kentucky. And\nthis is a part of an interview project with Holocaust survivors in Kentucky. Ms. Low has been\ninterviewed twice before, so this interview is going to...",
        "A: It\u2019s Klein.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "A: You said, Ms. Low.",
        "Q: Oh, I\u2019m sorry. Ms. Klein has been interviewed twice before, so we\u2019re going to focus this\ninterview on areas of questioning that haven\u2019t been discussed in those other two interviews. And\nthose interviews were conducted by, the first one was conducted by Mary K. Tachau in January\n1982. And that interview is now in the collection of the University of Louisville, Kentucky.\nAnd the second interview was a Survivors of the Shoah Foundation interview that was conducted\non April 22\u2122, 1996. So, we\u2019re going to start out by summarizing, more or less, what was said in\n1\nthose interviews, which were very thorough, particularly the Mary K. Tachau interview. And\nfilling in on a few questions and then we\u2019ll go on and mostly focus on Ms. Klein\u2019s life in\nKentucky. So, I\u2019m going to just read this summary and you tell me if I\u2019ve gotten anything\nwrong. Actually, first of all before we start, you were born in October ninth, 1921 in Eger,\nHungary. I was interested in hearing before we go on from there, something about your family\nhistory. Do you know anything about your family history?",
        "A: Yes, as much as I know. People in those days didn\u2019t go into a lot of details. But my father was\nborn in 1880 and my mother was born in 1879.",
        "Q: Can you give their names, including her maiden name?",
        "A: Yes. My mother\u2019s maiden name was Frida Weisz and my father\u2019s name was B\u00e9la Low. In\nHungarian we would say Low B\u00e9la and Weisz Frida, you know the last name comes first. My\nfather worked in a bank that was a chain. The main office was in Budapest. And then different\ncities would had branches. It was called at the time, and I don\u2019t know whether you want to know\nit in Hungarian. It was called the Magyar Atolanos Hitel Bank. Magyar means... and the Hitel\nBank was the name of the outfit. My father became, first he probably was a clerk and I would\nnot remember that. And actually married my mother, who was working in that bank before.\nThat\u2019s how they apparently met. This was a second marriage for my father, because his wife, the\nfirst wife, died maybe after two years of marriage, and then he married my mom. And she was\nborn in Fegyvernek, Hungary and my father was born in a little town called Tiszafured, Hungary.\nNow, my father became the manager of the bank and so those are the years I would remember.\nIn Hungarian, they were called the izgazgato (ph) of the bank, but here you would call the\nmanager, I think, or the director of that bank. And he did work there for a while. We lived in a\nhouse, a little bit away from downtown. And when I was four years old we moved into the same\nbuilding where the bank was, above the bank there was a nice big apartment. And we were very\ncomfortable in my house. I remember we had pretty gardens and so on and so forth, up to the\nage of four. And after that we lived downtown. So all I remember that toward the end, I think\nmy father was supposedly had to retire, already maybe at age sixty, where people here maybe\nretire only in sixty-five. They had a lovely and very nice ceremony for him. In fact, I owned\u2014\nbut unfortunately I don\u2019t own anymore\u2014they gave him a silver wreath, which the employees, all\nthe employees\u2019 names were signed on. And they gave a lovely, nice speech at his retirement. I\ndo have a picture of that, by the way. You know, I was really lucky that either relatives or\nmaybe it was left in the house. I have more pictures than many other people who lost everything.\nWe lost everything, but still for example, and if you would be interested toward the end, I would\nshow you that picture. He\u2019s sitting at the desk and that was the time he retired from the bank.\nAnd my mother, after... she had three children, so she didn\u2019t work, so that was before they got\nmarried, I think, that she was like a secretary, maybe, in the bank. So, that\u2019s what my parents...\nexcept then he had a very good friend, who lived in Budapest. He wasn\u2019t a Jewish guy, who had\nvineyards in our hometown. Because our hometown, Eger is very famous of its wine and\nvineyards. And as a friendship, that wasn\u2019t really a paid job, he helped that friend to take care of\nthe vineyard. I mean, not so much take care, because he had employees, but look after it a little\nbit. And they had an apple orchard and he was doing that. So, we went out to that vineyard\nmany times. And it was a pleasant way that I remember my childhood. You don\u2019t want to know\nmuch about my childhood, no more like about my parents.\n2",
        "Q: You talked a fair amount about your childhood in the other...",
        "A: See, I don\u2019t remember what I did. So, that\u2019s about really about my father. And then in one of\nthe interviews, I did tell them that when the Germans came in, he was the head of that five\nmember committee. So, I don\u2019t want to repeat myself.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So, this is about all I can tell about my parents. And I might have talked about my brothers, but\nthis is the answer that what my father did, and so on.",
        "Q: I wondered if you knew about your grandparents and about your family\u2019s history in Hungary?",
        "A: I have pictures of them, but very little. I really don\u2019t...I have a picture of my grandfather and\ngrandmother on my father\u2019s side and no pictures on my mother\u2019s side. I know absolutely\nnothing of the family history on my mother\u2019s side, except that she had two sisters and we were\nclose to the sisters. But not previously what happened to the father or mother or when they died.\nNothing. My father\u2019s mother died when I was five years old and I do remember that, because,\nyou know, in Jewish funerals, you know, there was a black casket, and we were... but when my\ngrandfather died, I do not remember that. I think he died, might have died before I ever was\nborn.",
        "Q: Do you know what brought your parents both to Eger?",
        "A: No, sorry.",
        "Q: Okay. Going on with the summary of your experiences. So, you did talk some about your\nbrothers and then after the German occupation in March of 1944, you were moved into a ghetto.\nLived there for three weeks and then you were taken to a brick factory, called Kerecsend. And\nthere for a few days, then from there, loaded onto cattle cars and taken to Auschwitz, where you\nwere separated from your parents. You worked in the kitchen in Auschwitz.",
        "A: Not right away.",
        "Q: Not right away?",
        "A: First I was in Birkenau for a month. And then from Birkenau in a lager, which was called A\nLager. And two weeks after that I got in on the kitchen work. So that had to be, we were taken\nout in June, July, it had to be about toward the end of July.",
        "Q: In January of 1945, you were forced to leave Auschwitz to go on a Death March towards\nRavensbriick. And you were at that point, with a group of four other girls, who you had kind of\nbecome close with, right?\n3",
        "A: Closer, but I really mainly, that close to one, who she worked with me in the kitchen, who I still\nkeep contact with, who lives now in Israel. She was from Yugoslavia, actually, from the town of\nIsad (ph), which nowadays is very much in the news. And she\u2019s really the one, who I kept close.\nIf you would ask me what were the other girls\u2019 names, I do not remember, and I do not know,\nand...",
        "Q: Do you know what became of them?",
        "A: Nothing. I never kept in touch with any of the others, except one other girl, who was from our\nhometown. And I don\u2019t even believe we worked in the kitchen together, but towards, during the\nDeath March, we ran into each other. She was older than I am. She used to be a seamstress.\nAnd in my stories, I think it\u2019s mentioned that on some of the train rides, after we were already\nliberated, we were together. And I do know what happened to her. And she lives, she remarried.\nShe had a husband earlier and then she remarried and they, to my surprise, they lived in Berlin.\nAnd he died in the meantime. I think he was an artist. And although I never thought I want to\ngo back to Germany, but at one point, with some friends from here, we did a two weeks tour in\nGermany, which took us to Berlin, too. And my, another friend who knew of her, gave me her\naddress and phone number. And I wrote to her and she came over to see, visit me in the hotel.\nThat\u2019s the first time I have seen her after Auschwitz times. And she still lives in Berlin. She\u2019s\nmuch older than I am, so at times I\u2019ve heard that she\u2019s kind of ill. So, I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s\ndoing. I have a feeling her husband was originally from Berlin and then, you know, I think they\nwere getting money after the Holocaust and they made their home there.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Rosenfeld, B6zsi. B6zsi\u2019s like Elizabeth and Rosenfeld was her last name. That was actually\nher name from the first marriage. That\u2019s the way we always knew her and I do not know what\nher next husband\u2019s name was. So, we called her Rosenfeld, B6zsi and she was from Eger. So.\nAnd that\u2019s all. I never kept up with anybody else. I don\u2019t know what happened to them. But I\nagree with you that I did talk about five girls a lot together, but they were not from my\nhometown. And as I said in my stories, that my memory is not that good. Certain things are\nvery vivid in my mind and certain things like it never happened. So, I can\u2019t give you any names.",
        "Q: How did you become so close with Ilus!?",
        "A: She worked... yeah, I remember, she worked in the kitchen and we met. And she\u2019s exactly my\nage and somehow we liked each other. And then what has happened, that after that people were\nseparated a lot, transports were leaving, and my husband\u2019s two sisters were in Auschwitz, but\nthey were taken away to Germany. And they worked like, the so-called forced labor, now in\nfactories or whatever. But then we came so close and when people were separated from their so-\ncalled loved ones, of course our parents were gone, but we didn\u2019t know exactly what happened to\nthem. We somehow decided that we just never want to separate from each other. And we did\nbecome good friends to the last minute. And I told you that, maybe, or I might have said it in the\nvideo, that my husband thinks that maybe I survived because of her and she thinks maybe\nbecause of me. But she was a bright girl and lot more outgoing or spoke lot of languages and\n' Born Ilus Fleischman; later lived in Israel and changed her name to Ilana Fried.\n4\ntherefore she was very informed of lot of things what were happening after the January so-called\nDeath March. She met people more, and so, I got some information from her, which she\nremembered and I never remembered myself.",
        "Q: Was her situation similar to yours, in that she had lost her parents, she had been separated from\nher parents in Auschwitz, and they were... ?",
        "A: Yes, and I do not remember the details of her background, although we used to talk about that, I\nassume. But I do not recall it. Well everybody lost their parents the same way, but I don\u2019t even\nremember if she was taken out with her parents together or not. So, I cannot give you any\ninformation about that. Then later she got married and they moved to Israel. And we kept up.\nIn fact, last year I was in Hungary and she came to Hungary, to Budapest and spent a week. So\nwe saw each other then. And unfortunately now, she lives in Netanya. Have you ever been in\nIsrael, yourself? And the last I heard of her, she was hit by a car. And she doesn\u2019t have any\nfamily anymore, because she never had any children. Her husband died years ago. She might\nhave a niece or some, so she was very, very down with the idea of that she had enough already\nduring concentration camp. And she was first in the hospital for a long time. Then she was in\nsome sort of a nursing home situation, because I think she had a broken hip and whatever. And\nin that age, she\u2019s very little and fragile. And then she is now back in her apartment. She doesn\u2019t\nlike to write, but she calls once in a while and I write. I write more than I call, because in a short\nconversation you cannot... but she\u2019s somewhat better, but pretty depressed by the whole\nsituation. Because she says it was very painful, and really nobody who can take care of her\nexcept nurses would come to the place. And so I felt very sorry about that, because I used to say\nthat and now she must have felt the same way, that one tragedy was enough, how many more do\nyou have to have? And for her, you know, that was an additional something that she certainly\nwasn\u2019t looking forward to. That\u2019s all.",
        "Q: You mentioned about that time that you were in Auschwitz, that you didn\u2019t fully believe what\nwas happening there. And as far as... as far as your relationship with Ilus, did she believe, was\nshe more informed than you were on that?",
        "A: Well Ilus I met later, somewhat later, not even in the beginning of my kitchen work. Later,\nbecause I worked first in one part of the kitchen, then in another part. And I think we met a little\nbit later. But I don\u2019t know, you have talked to a lot of Holocaust survivors, and I don\u2019t know\nwhether I\u2019m just so naive or I was so naive at the time. Because you know, I even read right\nnow, just last week, I read a book, you probably read it, Night of Eli Wiesel. Have you read that\nbook?",
        "Q: I actually have only read parts of it.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s a very easy. And I read that just in Nashville, while, you know, I had a little time to\nread it. And you know, the stories I hear of people, you know, when they arrived and they would\nsee the smoke and they maybe right away would have known what that is. Or maybe if\nsomebody told them, they believed it. Well, I am either very naive... I could never have\nbelieved anything like that. We did see the smoke, and the people who were there already, the\nfirst two or three years, they of course knew exactly what was going on. They were from Poland\n5\nor Russia and they would tell us. But I assumed that they were kind of jealous that we were\ncoming just in the last minute of the war. See, they were already suffering for three years and\nsuffered quite a bit, you can imagine. And whoever survived that three years, they were pretty\ntough and kind of mean. Because a lot of the kapos in the barracks were Jewish refugees, I mean\nnot refugees, but prisoners from way back. And I used to think that they just want to scare us, or\nthey tell us stories which is so unbelievable. So, I never thought about that since my parents\ndisappeared that first day, that they would have been burned.",
        "Q: Do you think that was important for your survival that you didn\u2019t believe it?",
        "A: Well, I hope so. It could be. And we didn\u2019t read about this that much, you know like I listened\nor read different kind of stories about people. Even, even this Eli Wiesel said that in Hungary\nthey did not know anything about Auschwitz. We did not know anything about Auschwitz. And\nI don\u2019t think my parents did. At the same time, my parents were very protective, too. They were\nthe type of people that they didn\u2019t want to scare you. Even if they would have known a little bit\nmore, they did not discuss that. And if we would listen to the Voice of America, which I said in\nmy interviews before about what\u2019s going on and we would hear Hitler screaming and yelling.\nThe concentration camps were not... we did not know anything about it. Like when we\u2019re in the\ntrain, I never knew where we are going, and I never was afraid that it\u2019s going to be Auschwitz,\nbecause I did not know anything about that. And I am talking only about myself. You can talk\nto somebody else maybe and they have an entire different... and you want to know my feelings.\nWe were going somewhere and it was miserable, but we didn\u2019t know where.",
        "Q: Can you tell me, can you trace in your memory, how it happened that you became aware of what\nAuschwitz meant?",
        "A: I mean, later in... when we would have believed that they really... I can\u2019t remember when that\ncame to our mind, you know. For a long, long time we thought that, you know, our parents are\nsomewhere in another camp and taking care of the kids who were also taken away from people.\nWell, I was the youngest, and I didn\u2019t have, but as I told you in one of the stories, that my sister-\nin-laws had little children, a four and a six year old. Well, they wouldn\u2019t have imagined that\nthey were burned in the gas chambers. They would have thought that the mother was taking care\nof the kids in a different kind of a camp. When did we came to the realization? Toward the very\nend. I think maybe even during the Death March, and we heard this over and over and over\nagain, we assumed maybe. But it wasn\u2019t that it just happened one day. And I never remember\nreally, crying that suddenly now I might not have my parents anymore. It is just... everything\nwas so gradual that I couldn\u2019t recall anything like that. And I wanted to get back to Hungary.\nBy then, I kind of knew that I\u2019m not going to find my parents there, but I had big hopes that I\nwould find my brothers, because I didn\u2019t know what happened to them. Of course, I didn\u2019t find\nthem either, and I have mentioned that in some of my interviews. But when did that happen? I\ndon\u2019t really know. (Doorbell rings.) Oh gosh, would you turn that off for a minute?",
        "Q: Well, I wondered if you got to any point where you, even if it was years after the war, where you\ncried for them? That it hit you or that you felt safe enough to really mourn.\n6",
        "A: Yeah, well I could even cry now, but see what it 1s, that what amazes me, that during that time\nthat we were in that camp and so many horrible things were going on, I don\u2019t remember really\never crying. You know? The shock was so great. And afterwards, see, when I got back to\nHungary, there was just, it was such a trauma, the whole thing, that you know, it was almost like\nyou were, like you were under the influence of some sort of magical thing that everything hit you\nall at once. And so, I don\u2019t, of course I, even now, and you know I have pictures, or when I\ncouldn\u2019t find my brothers. But it\u2019s funny, I wasn\u2019t... it\u2019s not funny at all, but I apparently didn\u2019t\ncry that easily. I mean I might have held it back more. And the tears come now, for example, I\nsee a program on television, not about the Holocaust, but about something, a little kid getting\nhurt or little... I can so easily cry and have tears, you know, over that, but with this big event\nwhat happened, that was just so much, that I... I didn\u2019t... like that we go to the cemetery when\nwe are in my hometown, because they have a memorial for the adults and then they have a\nspecial one for the kids. My family\u2019s names are on it. And it\u2019s just, you know, you\u2019re just\nunder, it\u2019s a shock kind of, which never left me for ever, ever and ever, you know? Then I had\nother traumas yet, which I might have talked about it or I might have not. But I don\u2019t want to\njump ahead of myself. You ask me the question.",
        "Q: Okay, well I\u2019m not concerned about sticking to a chronology, so you can talk about...We\u2019ll just\nget back to the chronology when...",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I think that what made me survive, that I must be kind of tough. Or maybe I was\nbrought up in a nice family home and I didn\u2019t have any upsetting situations. But I think it has a\nlot to do, that some people are stronger for some reason and some people are not that strong.\nAnd I was able to handle many situations which for other people might have been very dramatic\nand I could do it. So, it must be my personality that I was able to... to survive, no. No?\nBecause you can get sick and you can die or they can kill you. But maybe the feeling that you\ndon\u2019t give up easily. Or it\u2019s like in my story, I might have said some that we had lice and we\nwould spend hours trying to get rid of the lice. Or if we were starving, you know, I was able\nto... then I was lucky that I didn\u2019t get really sick. I mean, that I don\u2019t think has anything to do\nwith one\u2019s personality. You may be stronger, and I\u2019m a pretty strong person. But in those days,\nyou know, being out in January and February, you could have gotten anything and just died, but I\ndidn\u2019t. And that I considered luck. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s a personality. Somebody who is\nstronger, maybe can endure all that. So I\u2019m not sure exactly what might have caused that, that I\nwas able to deal with it better than maybe the other people, who even now, maybe... I hate it that\nthey have nightmares about it and they remember all the horrible things. I think about it a lot and\nI remember them, but I deal with it, except sometimes it looks to me that, that wasn\u2019t me. That\nhad to be somebody else, because up to this moment, I can\u2019t believe and can\u2019t understand how in\nthe world somebody can survive it. And then talk about it later in life. It\u2019s... I have a hard time\nunderstanding that and I still feel that way.",
        "Q: And somebody pretty young...",
        "A: I was not that young, you know. I really not a 15-year-old kid. I was in my 23s or 24s. So, I\nwas mature enough to deal with it, but I worried about... see after the... and as of today, I\u2019m\ngoing to say something to you, I just thought about that. They died the way, you know how they\ndid. And at the same time I tried to compromise with it. I mean, I\u2019m not trying to forgive Hitler\n7\never, or what happened to us. But if I saw younger people with their mother doing the same\nthings I was doing and they would beat that mother or that mother was starving, you know? Just\nthe thought of that for me would have been horrible. So, the way I think now that they suddenly\nwere killed and they didn\u2019t suffer. That makes me feel almost better than if I would have gone\nwith them maybe for half a year and then slowly they would have died. Because they were in\ntheir sixties, they weren\u2019t young. Some people were only maybe in their forties. But when I was\nborn, my mother was already forty years old, so she had to be 63 some years old. And in those\ndays those were already old people, but they were healthy people. I never seen them sick or, you\nknow, in bed, in fact, with a sickness. So, to me, seeing them suffer right next to you would have\nbeen almost worse. I mean, I don\u2019t know if anybody ever felt that way. Because if they could\nhave survived the whole thing, that\u2019s a different story, but at that age, not many older people\ncould survive it. So.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side A\n8\nTape 1, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape number one, side B of an interview with Ann Low Klein. Well, let\u2019s, I have some\nquestions about the things that you brought up, but let\u2019s try to get back to them later and we\u2019 ll\nget back right now to the summary, to just finish saying what happened to you during the\nwartime. I believe when we left off, we mentioned that you were on a Death March. You were\nforced to go to Ravensbruck with this group of other girls and then we went off talking about\nwhat had become of them. So, you were in Ravensbriick for about three weeks.",
        "A: Ravensbrick for three weeks.",
        "Q: And then to Malchow for about two weeks. And then there was a lot of traveling around to\nvarious places.",
        "A: Well, either walking or in open trains. The open train was right after the Auschwitz, the\nevacuation of Auschwitz, because I remember it was very cold and the trains were open. And I\nhave already told that story, so I don\u2019t want to really repeat myself. The camps, unless you\nreally would want to, I haven\u2019t looked at my notes again, many of the names I got from my\nfriend, Ilus. Because she remembered names very well. But Ravensbriick really was the most\nfamous one, but nobody... it wasn\u2019t really a camp for us anymore. It was gathering places. And\nwherever, like what you mentioned near Dresden, this Malchow, it wasn\u2019t that we were supposed\nto be working there or we were supposed to be doing anything there. It was just a stop during\nthe wandering around or the trains and so on and so forth. So, the last part of it, which I (coughs)\nexcuse me, I already mentioned before, on the open field, where I ran into a lot of the... even\nsome people from my hometown, by then there were no camps, it was just... but by then the\nweather was a little bit better, because it was springtime. So we wouldn\u2019t suffer from ice and\ncold and so on. But our main and worse situation was in ice and cold and snow, trying to stop\nand sit down and possibly freeze to death. Is where my friend, Ilus and I kept ourselves from\ntrying to avoid that if possible. Because we were told that, that can happen. But after that I\ncouldn\u2019t tell you any of the real camps because then we ended up in Wurzen and that was...",
        "Q: And then finally you were actually liberated during that time of wandering, the last two weeks of\nthe war, you were liberated by American Army in Wurzen, Germany, where you stayed for about\nthree weeks. And you were recovering from an infection to your arm, to your finger. Oh yeah,\nthat finger nail 1s still...",
        "A: It\u2019s still gone forever, yeah. And so those were the start, and I show that to you. This scar was\nmy tattoo number and this where my hands are very worked up, there is a little scar. And a little\nscar right here, where the pus had to be taken out, because I would have... okay that was another\nway you could have died. I had blood poisoning, but with that surgery, since by then we were\nliberated, and they did it. If the war would to have gone on further, longer, I don\u2019t know what\nwould have happened to that arm. But I never thought about it then either, except that was very\npainful. And that was taken care of in Wurzen. And after that, 1t took a while for that to heal, I\nassume. And I never did get my finger nails back, but that should be my biggest problem.\n9",
        "Q: You described going to a Czech parachute camp, where British soldiers wanted to take you to\nEngland, but you went to Hungary instead because you were hoping to find your family.",
        "A: Well, because, yeah, well, we were, they wanted to help us and that was only this friend of mine\nand myself. And yes, I remember that very clearly. They gave us real good food, I mean really\nfood what we had never had before. Because, as I told you before, in Wurzen the first thing was\nI would eat the bag full of sugar and I would eat pickles. I mean that\u2019s alone a reason too, not to\nsurvive, I think, but then again, maybe I was strong or I don\u2019t get sick that easily. But after we\nheard about a transport, maybe from that area, leaving toward Hungary, we left them a note and\nwe told them \u201cThank you very much, but we\u2019re going to try,\u201d and we got on the train. And that\nwas a few more weeks of Czechoslovakia and all over the place. If I would look at my notes, I\nmight even get some ideas around Bern, for example, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that important and\nthat would really stretch it out. But the train was going slowly at different places. Now, my\nfriend, the reason she remembered more, first of all, she spoke languages better. She spoke\nFrench, she spoke German. She was from Yugoslavia. She spoke the Slavic languages, so in\nCzechoslovakia she could understand some of the Czecho... so, she found out a lot of little\nthings, exactly where we were. And I was immobilized because of that surgery on my arm. So\nmy arm was all tied up, so I didn\u2019t run around as easily as she did. Like, the train would stop and\nthen some people would bring up some food. That was, of course, after the war was over. Or\nshe would go down, they asked her down to a kitchen and they give her something to eat and\nthen she would bring some. But I just stayed put, because it was kind of hard for me to get\naround with that. And that was painful, because those things had to heal. But you know it\u2019s\nbecause that\u2019s the way I remember, and any other questions I\u2019Il be glad to help\nyou.",
        "Q: Just on the subject of your strength and being strong enough to survive that and also having the\nluck to survive it. I was wondering about your, how you thought of yourself and how you\nremember yourself before the war. You mentioned that during the war you just didn\u2019t cry and\nthat now you can cry at little things. But before the war was your personality that way? Did you\never cry then?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember that I was... I wasn\u2019t pampered really, by my parents, although they had\nthe means. But I remember... I don\u2019t think I was really spoiled. I was spoiled by them not to\nshare bad news. So, that\u2019s one thing I remember so well. Like my older brother was ill, had\nsome sort of a lung problem in his high school year. They took him to Budapest and the lungs\nhad to be filled at that time, you know that was more complicated. They never scared me with\nall that. Or I remember my younger brother, who was four years older than Iam. He once, he\nlived in another town, worked also in a bank. And he must have gotten sick with some sort of a\nso-called blood disease where the white cells were more than the red cells or so on and I didn\u2019t\nquite understand the whole thing. And my parents would talk to them on the phone and I think\nthey were worried about what was going on, but then he got well. But they never, ever shared\nthe worry with me, so therefore I was not exposed to anything bad, ever, up to that point. You\nknow? My parents lived together and my brother... we were... it was a close-knit family, but\nnot a spoiled. You know, like my father had probably enough money, but I made a big deal of\nasking for money. I remember I would say and that they laughed about that. That\u2019s not\nimportant to the interview, but I would say, \u201cI have a real, real, real big favor to ask, and a real\n10\nbig favor to ask.\u201d And they didn\u2019t know what it was I wanted, ten cents or 25 cents. I mean, I\nmade a big deal about it, you know? So up to the last moment that was the way I was brought\nup. My bad parts was my Catholic high school at the last year, which also was in my interview,\nbecause one of the nuns was very anti-Semitic and that hurt my feeling very much. But there\nagain, I didn\u2019t cry. I couldn\u2019t object to it. It wasn\u2019t like nowadays, people protest. So, I had to\nkind of swallow it and live with it. So, I don\u2019t remember ever being very upset or that I got hurt\neasily, you know, like some people get hurt over everything. I had friends and they liked me and\nI liked them and somehow that\u2019s the way I was brought up.",
        "Q: So it wasn\u2019t as if the war came and you became a different person?",
        "A: No, I think my personality was kind of strong all my, but I didn\u2019t have to. It was easy to be\nstrong when I had all the comfort. It\u2019s different. From ghetto time on, it hit us. It\u2019s just like for\neverybody else. But you might have had interviews with some people, maybe they had a bad\nchildhood or maybe somebody was abusive. And who knows? I didn\u2019t have any of that. It hit\nme at the time when the Germans came in. And I read that other places, too, people didn\u2019t\nimagine it could happen to you. And we never imagined that it could happen to us, whatever\nwas happening, everything was gradual. You know, the giving up your whole place, the ghetto,\nthe brick factory. It just... it hit you and we had to face it and I did without any, you know, any\ncrying, temper or fighting it. The only upset points I would have, and would see again my\nparents sitting in front of our ghetto home, where it was raining and they had to leave their stuff.\nI always used to think that they had all the nice things and now you just have to leave it there.\nSo, I always felt more sorry for them than for myself at the time. That\u2019s the way I remember.",
        "Q: What about when the war ended and you started trying to just go about your life? Did you feel\nas 1f you were transformed? You were a different person than you had been before?",
        "A: Well I was in a way like, by the time I got back to Hungary, to Budapest and I realized that I\ndon\u2019t have... I really realized that my parents are gone and my brothers are gone. And I have\nmentioned in some of the interviews how I found about what happened to my brothers, so I don\u2019t\nwant to repeat myself to that. But everything was still completely like a dream type of a thing,\nbecause I remember that people wanted me to meet friends and get together with them. And I\nwas just like, like blindfolded. I did what I was told. I didn\u2019t have my own personality, you\nknow. I don\u2019t remember much about the time, you know. And I was in Budapest for a whole\nyear before I came out to this country. And some things are fairly vivid in my mind, some\npeople I don\u2019t even remember. I just really don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t know if I ever mentioned it,\nbefore the war they wanted me to marry somebody. Did I say that? I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s\nimportant, but there was a real good friend of ours, a family. He was a lawyer and they were rich\npeople. And their nephew got married to a girl in my hometown, who 1s still alive now\nsomewhere. I never see her anymore, but she lived in Israel. And that person who was marrying\nthe girl brought his cousin. And they lived somewhere in the Yugoslavian area and they were\nbig farmers or landlords, landholders and very rich people. And they all decided that that would\nbe a great situation for me.",
        "Q: Who decided that, your parents?\n11",
        "A: That\u2019s... no, the couple, whose nephew was marrying the one girl and brought his cousin. And\nthey had a big dinner, a get together. And I don\u2019t know that should be in the Holocaust Museum,\nbut... briefly I would say it was a big dinner and I sat next to that guy and enough that he invited\nme to go to where he lives and meet his parents. And my mother and I took a train and we went\nwith this guy... can\u2019t even remember his name anymore. It was beautiful. They waited for us\nwith a sleigh. So, I liked, only thing is the sleigh rides in the snow. And at that time, of course, I\nknew my husband by then, because we were growing up together. We came to the United States\nand I liked him. And I certainly didn\u2019t like that guy. He was like about ten years older than I\nam. And so on the way back, on the train, I used my personality, where I might have cried, and\ntold my mother, \u201cI absolutely don\u2019t want anything to do with this situation.\u201d And they accepted\nit. They didn\u2019t force me to do that. But I think I was very upset and I might have cried then. On\nthe train home I kind of said, \u201c\u201cNo way do I want to do that.\u201d But then after the war, people\nwanted me to meet a friend and so on. And it\u2019s very vague in my mind. I can\u2019t remember. I\nlove music and somebody, my husband\u2019s wife, they got married just before the war. Not my\nhusband\u2019s, I\u2019m sorry, my brother. And she got me some opera tickets and I liked opera at the\ntime, it\u2019s a season ticket. And I went to all that because I was told to do but I didn\u2019t have my\nheart in it. You know? It was just something that I was so vague and my girlfriend, and I think I\nmight have said that. She was my good friend, who 1s still a friend of mine and I still see her all\nthe time. She sometimes comes to the United States and I have been visiting her.",
        "Q: What\u2019s her name?",
        "A: Her name is, her maiden name was Fleischman, Ibi. And the very interesting thing is that my\nfriend from Yugoslavia, her maiden name was Fleischman, too. Isn\u2019t that strange? And then she\nmarried, the woman in Budapest, married a furrier and his name was Fischer. And they had a\nfurrier business and when I arrived back to Budapest, I went down. And I remember one thing,\nthat I stood against a wall and of course, they never knew what happened to me. And I think it\nwas very vivid in my mind and I told my story to her. Then she hired me. She gave me a job,\nand I worked in that place. Oh, I don\u2019t know, just help out and they taught me how to make\npatterns for fur coats. You know there is a way to do that. And I worked in that furrier place\nuntil it was time for me to leave Budapest to come to this country. And I might have, you\nremember my tape? I must have told in it that I got a letter, letters from my sister-in-laws, where\nthey were happy that I\u2019m going to becoming a member of the family. And then I got a letter\nfrom my husband where he asked me to come out. But my Budapest time, that year and a half, I\nhad to go back to my hometown. I had to give up my apartment. I had to sell things which were\nso dear to my parents and cost, must have cost a lot of money. I practically had to just give it\naway. It was inflation time. And so, I got rid of all that. I got some money out of it, not very\nmuch, very little. And then I...",
        "Q: Yeah, you did talk about that in the interview with...",
        "A: ...with Mary K.",
        "Q: ...Mary K.",
        "A: Yeah, I must have.\n12",
        "Q: But I thought it would be a good time too, for you to say something that you haven\u2019t talked about\nin either interview, which is how you met Sandy and how long you\u2019ve known him.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019ve known him from the time he was a little boy. He\u2019s a year older than I am and we\nlived just a block away. And at that time, he used to play the violin and I used to play the piano.\nAnd we belonged to the same music school. And we did by then, like I was teenager, maybe\nfourteen and he might have been 15 and a half. And we had some pieces that we played together\nand then there would be a recital, and we did... so those are the ways that we really... and then\nwe played tennis together and his sister was a friend of mine, who is... in fact, she\u2019s coming\nAugust the 5\"\". She now lives in Argentina. She was one of them who had a little child and lost\nthe child, and she\u2019s coming to visit. And then he fell in love with me more, when, you know,\nyou\u2019re 16 or 17. And before he left, and he would ask me, he said he\u2019s going to marry me. And\nof course, he was only eighteen and I was sixteen and a half and he left to the United States. So,\nall kind of things could have happened. But I remember we went to Budapest at one time\nbecause I had to... no, he had to go after his papers, because he had an uncle in Washington,\nD.C., who brought him out with a student visa. And then he went to school in Washington. And\nso, for a while, until 1941, he would write very frequently. And like, I think I might have\nmentioned that for my birthday, he would ask his mother and she would send a bouquet of a\nhundred red roses, which at that time... she paid for it. And I think it wasn\u2019t as expensive as it is\nnow. But then the war came in \u201841 and after that, I never heard from him. First of all, you\ncouldn\u2019t get letters. He was in the service, in the Army, Air Force, actually. So, that was about,\nbut we played ping pong together. I mean, Eger is a small town and the Jewish community\nwasn\u2019t really that big. And by then when I graduated from high school, we really didn\u2019t keep up\nwith our non-Jewish friends that much.",
        "Q: Had you, did you feel about Sandy the way that he felt about you, in those early days?",
        "A: Yeah, I did, but I was a little bit, I remember at one point, I mean, I don\u2019t know why that\nHolocaust Museum has to know about it, but I remember I was telling my friend, the one who\nstill lives in Budapest and who I\u2019m close to, he was very much after me. And then you know\nhow sometimes you get tired of it, you know. He wanted to be with me a lot and so on and so\nforth. And then my friend said, \u201cJust stay away, pretend that you\u2019re not interested,\u201d and then he\nwill change being after me like that. And he did just that. So, he stayed away and then I\nsuddenly thought to myself, well it\u2019s more than... you know, I really didn\u2019t want to stay away.\nSo, I felt the same way toward him, but see I was younger and I went to a Catholic high school,\nand we had friends after that. And I had a boyfriend later, whom I really liked very much, but\ndifferently than Sandy. Because he was the kind of guy I would have never wanted to marry.\nAnd he flirted with one girl and then with another and then with a third one. But he was that\ntype, you know, that it was more like being impressed by he was somewhat after me, but at the\nsame time I would know that he would be after a divorced woman and have two other girlfriends\nhere and there. So, he wasn\u2019t very stable. So I would have never, ever have considered...",
        "Q: When was that?\n13",
        "A: That was after Sandy left. It had to be after 19... between 1939 and \u00b041, and then I guess, I\u2019m\nnot sure what happened to him. Then of course, he never survived either. But I would have\nnever... it wasn\u2019t a serious situation. I would have never considered...",
        "Q: What about after the war when you were in Budapest, were you thinking a lot about Sandy?",
        "A: See, then, in concentration camp and I told you that, we only thought about food and never about\nboys. And after I got back, it wasn\u2019t very much after I arrived, see, that I got those letters from\nmy sister-in-laws. And the first time that he wrote to me, which I still have that letter, in which\nhe asked me and gave me the choice of, that he thought about that he wants his sisters come... I\nthink I mentioned that he went to Bergen-Belsen to get his sisters. And he took them to\nCasablanca, because he was stationed in Casablanca at that time. And then he wanted to have\nthe girls come to the United States, which didn\u2019t work out, because one went back to Hungary.\nThe other one stayed and married somebody there. But he kind of thought that I could come out\nand we all could live together. We would get married. If it works, fine. If it doesn\u2019t, we could\nalways separate. See that was ten years after and you know a lot of things happen during ten\nyears. So, when I got that letter, you know, I never had a second thought that that ought not to\nwork out.",
        "Q: So, you weren\u2019t afraid that maybe you\u2019d both changed in that almost ten years?",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t afraid of it, but it helped me not to be afraid of it, that I didn\u2019t have to leave anybody\nbehind, and that\u2019s very important. If my parents would have been alive, I don\u2019t know whether I\ncould have that easily leave. Because at that time, you know, America was pretty far. And... or\nmy brothers, I didn\u2019t have anybody to leave. I mean I didn\u2019t have that feeling that, \u201cOh my God,\nwhat would be my choice?\u201d So, when I got that letter, I right away thought I\u2019d like to come.\nAnd not because I wanted to come out to the United States, but I knew him well and I felt like...\nyou know I never had a second thought that I ought not to do this. But I didn\u2019t have my parents\nanymore to leave. I didn\u2019t have my brothers to leave. I had maybe a friend or so, but I didn\u2019t\nmind leaving her. So, it was a test again that I was hoping that it will work out. I wasn\u2019t\nabsolutely sure about that, but I wanted to come.",
        "Q: What were your ideas about the United States or preconceptions about it? What had you\nexpected?",
        "A: Well, Sandy has written to me while I was Paris for six weeks, practically every day, and gave\nme a lot of ideas of what\u2019s going on. And two things were interesting...",
        "Q: Maybe I should just interrupt you to point, to say that, for the sake of the tape, that after the war\nyou spent a year or so in Budapest.",
        "A: Between Eger and Budapest, but I stayed in Budapest with an aunt and an uncle, who took me in.\nAnd to Eger I only went because I had to give up my apartment and I had to deal with that. I had\nan uncle, my father\u2019s brother, who moved into our apartment after... and he was the first who\ncame back. So a lot of stuff that I have left, that I found maybe pictures or something like that, it\ncould be that it got into his hands.\n14",
        "Q: What was that like, to return to Eger and have to deal with that?",
        "A: Well, the first thing, for example, was tremendously strange, but I do remember that we had help\nin our house, when I was growing up, and my mother tried to make me once in a while to, to help\na little bit. I think she wanted to train me to become eventually a good housewife. I think all\nmothers like to do that. And I remember that one day she was making me dust the furniture in\nthe bedroom, although all my friends were downstairs already, down on the main street walking.\nAnd I kept on looking out and I was just upset that I couldn\u2019t be there. I could have done dusting\nthe furniture in two seconds, but instead of that, I was fooling around and I wished I would be\ndown with my friends. So anyway, I was procrastinating that kind of stuff apparently, like many\nother kids, I didn\u2019t want to maybe do what my chore would have been. After I came back and I\nhad that big apartment, and I remember I worked like a dog. You know, we had hardwood\nfloors. And at that time, you know, you didn\u2019t have the kind of waxers and the facilities and the\nvacuum cleaners like they have them now. I remember I had a brush I put on the one foot and I\nwaxed the floor. And under your other foot, you have a rag. I mean, you never saw anything\nlike that, but...",
        "Q: Had anyone lived in that house during the war?",
        "A: Well, yes, different people lived in it and then they moved out and when I came back, my uncle\nwas there. But I tried to get the house back in the shape like I remembered that it was before.\nAnd all I could, always, and I think I cried at that time, if my mother just would see now, how\nI\u2019m trying to take care of the house, when earlier I wouldn\u2019t even want to dust the furniture. So,\nI was very proud of myself. And you know, I mean, I don\u2019t remember the crying spells, but I\nwould get very emotional, even now that I\u2019m talking about it. If she just could have seen now\nwhat I\u2019m doing, when I really didn\u2019t have to, but I did it for myself or maybe to just the way the\nplace looked like before. I wanted to put it back into that same shape.",
        "Q: It sounds like, over the years, it\u2019s kind of been, that your parents have been with you and a lot of\ntimes, you think about them looking on the things you\u2019ve done.",
        "A: I do, I even could cry, see, right now. But when you\u2019re in the middle of it, you know, I think I\njust took it the way I had to. But yes, of course, I mean I do think about them a lot.",
        "Q: Did you sell that house?",
        "A: That house wasn\u2019t owned by us. Our first house what we lived in, which was very pretty and\nvery big, with a big garden, that was sold. This apartment, I think, belonged to, as I said, it was\nabove the bank. And I think that was rented. So, I didn\u2019t sell anything there. I had to sell\nfurnitures. And I had to get rid of all that, but the apartment didn\u2019t belong to us. And I wrote, I\ngave, I talked to Mary K. about that, I think.",
        "Q: Yes, you did. So you were talking about when you came to the United States or I interrupted\nyou. You were talking about how, well I wanted to say for the sake of the tape that when you\n15\nwere leaving, heading toward the United States, you spent six weeks in Paris first, and that was\nin 1947. Right?",
        "A: 1946. I left in November and arrived to the States in 1947, January. So, I left in November and\nby the time I arrived here, I mean to New York, it was January the 20\". That was very hard six\nweeks for me, because I was alone. It was cold.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side B\n16\nTape 2, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number two, side A of an interview with Ann Low Klein. Since you talked about\nyour experiences in Paris when you did the interview with Mary K. Tachau, I wanted to focus\non, you also talked about arriving and what happened once you arrived in the United States and\nthe scary experience that you had being detained before you were let off. (Laughing.) You did\ntalk about that.",
        "A: Yeah, so I don\u2019t want to repeat that. That was just for one night.",
        "Q: One thing that I was particularly interested in was that it looked like... let me check my notes.\nBut it looked like you arrived, you arrived in the U.S. on January 20\".",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And then you were married on January 29\"?",
        "A: The 29\",",
        "Q: My goodness. So, how did you, was it difficult to... and also you mentioned that Sandy was in\nfinals at that time. So, he was extremely busy when you arrived. How did you... when did you\nhave time to catch up together?",
        "A: Well, I have also managed... I must have told in the interview that he had an uncle in\nWashington, so I stayed with them. And that was very hard for me too, as I mentioned, because\nI couldn\u2019t speak the language. And they were friendly and nice with me, but when you can\u2019t\ncommunicate... I mean, everything 1s so strange when you are at a new place. But what I must\nsay now, and I don\u2019t know if I ever said it. That I still, at this moment, I have this kind of a\nfeeling that I compare things to the 1944 situation. And I always used to think that\u2019s very hard,\nbut how much better it is than it was then. So, everything in all my life, since then, I compare it\nto, lots of times. That if I was able to take that, my God, I should be able to take this. It wasn\u2019t\nthat easy, but he, after school he would come over and then we would go out. Then we would\ntry, 1t wasn\u2019t that easy, because ten years went by, but we knew we were getting married, and it\nwas... you had to adjust to that, too. Plus I don\u2019t think I talked too much about my experiences\nthen. And he loved music and we talked about music, so on, and then we had a very small\nwedding and I must have told that to Mary K. And so, it was just something that I could adjust\nto things, easier I think than maybe many other people. And if something 1s a hardship or like,\nyou could say, \u201cMy God you haven\u2019t been with him for a long time, that must have been hard.\u201d\nMust have been hard to be in a home, a nice home in Washington, D.C. with an American\nwoman and a Hungarian man, but who has been in this country since age 14, children who\nwanted to be nice to me, but it\u2019s hard. And it was hard, but I adjusted to that too. And I mean I\ndidn\u2019t suffer, because I thought this is for, toward the better. And I always compared things like\nthat, even as of today, I put things on a scale in my mind, and how would it be better, you know?\nAnd so I adjust to things easier, I think. See I don\u2019t know whether I told Mary K. about my\nBloomington experiences or did we talk about that?\n17",
        "Q: Just a little bit. You mentioned that you were living in a trailer with no running water and Sandy\nwas in Graduate school at that time?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, so I don\u2019t want to repeat it again, but to me that\u2019s a hardship. I mean not... I hada\nnice home at home, we always had running water in bathrooms. In Auschwitz, we didn\u2019t have\nanything. In the Bloomington campus, living in a trailer, in a tiny, little place, where I had to\nbring the water in at night and go to the john and take a shower. And not many people who were\nbrought up in this country with all the comfort would accept that.",
        "Q: Did you talk with Sandy about your experiences during the war?",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m sure I did, but I don\u2019t recall it exactly when. I\u2019m sure. And, you know, but I don\u2019t think\nthat I talked about it all the trme. And as I mentioned, I didn\u2019t talk to other people for a long\ntime about it, till the opportunity arose that I would, maybe this subject matter would come up.\nBut that was years and years after. But I don\u2019t think this was my topic of conversation that I\nwould talk about that all the time. I probably thought about it a lot, but I didn\u2019t. And when my\nkids were growing up, I didn\u2019t want to, I didn\u2019t want to, I didn\u2019t want to make a big emphasis on\nthat I\u2019m Jewish. They knew it. I mean, we are Jewish. But because you are Jewish, something\nlike this could happen. I didn\u2019t want them to grow up like that. My older daughter was, later on\nin life, objecting to it that I was holding many things back. I did not want them to feel that they\nwould be persecuted just because they are Jewish. They knew I was Jewish and Sandy was, but I\ndidn\u2019t make a big deal about it. So, I was holding back. I didn\u2019t tell them stories about it till\nthey got much, much older. Now they all have the tape and they know about it. But I didn\u2019t feel\nthat, that should be important. I didn\u2019t want to make them worried and unhappy as time would\ngo on.",
        "Q: Did you feel safe in this country?",
        "A: I did, except in my interview I might have told you that I got a job. Did I say that in\nWashington, D.C. to do alteration at Garfinkel Department Store. And you had to fill out the\napplication and they asked what religion you are. And I think I wrote down, or I might put a\ndash, but I was very worried about that. You know, I thought to myself this country is a safe\ncountry and it\u2019s a free country and why do they want to know? What could be the result of it?\nSo, for a very long time, for years, and I told that in one of the interviews, I worked in that place\nand I was afraid that they were going to ask me what church I go to. I wouldn\u2019t have lied to\nthem.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But it concerned me that this should be a topic of conversation and what could be the result if\nthey find out that I\u2019m Jewish. And that worried me for a long, long time. I thought that in this\ncountry, everything is free. And I also told you that when I... in my interview, I\u2019m sure, that\nwhen I arrived to New York and we were waiting for a cab to go to the railroad station and my\nlittle suitcase was stolen. Did I say that?",
        "Q: Uh uh.\n18",
        "A: Okay, well my uncle in Budapest gave me a lovely, nice black patent leather, little overnight\ncase with red leather lining. And anything what I had valuable which people gave me, maybe\njewelry and I can\u2019t remember, as presents or Sandy\u2019s sister has given me certain things from her\nmom, was in that. And I held onto it in Paris. I took care of all my belongings. And when we\narrived in New York and a second uncle of Sandy and his son, waited for me and came with us\nto the railroad station. And by then I felt I don\u2019t have to watch that much anymore. I think I just\ndidn\u2019t take care of my things as much. And when they were putting the things into the cab... I\ndidn\u2019t have that much belonging, but that little black suitcase was missing. So somebody as we\nwere talking right next to the, on the railroad station waiting for a cab to come, must have picked\nit up and they stole it. And that disappointed me tremendously, because I thought this country 1s\nvery safe. Things like that, it would not happen. Because Sandy always used to write to me that\nthey put a 25 cents down near the newspaper and nobody takes that 25 cents and you can just get\nyour paper. So, I thought no crime is happening in this country. And that was one of my\ndisappointments. The other one was the Ellis Island and I had to be there. And he also wrote to\nme that the uncle had a black, they had a black maid. And he said to me that, you know, you\ngotta be, if you are going to meet her... because I\u2019ve never seen black people. And he just kind\nof tried to make me realize that, well, we were very liberal, in all this, in our upbringing, and\nSandy was too, that you got to be very nice and not make difference between a black and a\nwhite. And then when I met her, of course, she was very nice, but that was the first time I ever\nseen a black person, but I was already warned by Sandy that you got to be very nice. They\u2019re\njust like whites and they can\u2019t help that they\u2019re persecuted and stuff like that. So, I was prepared\nfor all that. And I tell you, in this country, in Louisville, Kentucky, I was terribly disappointed at\none time. I met a young couple, Jewish couple, who invited us to their house. And I don\u2019t know\nwhere they are now and they seemed like they were prejudiced against blacks from their talk.\nAnd I couldn\u2019t believe it. I could not understand it as of today, and I know there are very many\nJewish people who are prejudiced towards blacks. Now, I know. I couldn\u2019t believe that\nanybody who 1s persecuted themselves, how can they be prejudiced towards somebody else.\nAnd that was another disappointment in my life that I couldn\u2019t understand that.",
        "Q: That was the first ttme you had been confronted directly with that kind of person?",
        "A: That was already in Louisville, so that was several years after. At the Bloomington campus there\nwere black people. And... but when somebody would make a remark like that, it was some sort\nof prejudice remark and I was very surprised. I didn\u2019t know that Jews could be prejudiced, but I\nknow they are. I mean they could be, but it surprised me very much. When you said, \u201cHow did\nyou take, were you satisfied with everything in the United States?\u201d Mainly, yes, but little things\nlike that. That it\u2019s not as free and not as honest as I thought the way they were described to me\nat the time.",
        "Q: Let me ask you, you had, you had come to this country and begun to kind of settle down and live\nmore of a normal in quotes, life...",
        "A: Well, not very normal. In Washington, yes, we had couple of apartments and we worked hard to\nget it. Little apartments. But when we moved to Bloomington, Indiana, that\u2019s when we had the\ntrailer, because he would have liked to get housing for married couple. But they were hard to\n19\nget. They were not available all the time. So, I stayed in Washington with a friend of his for a\nfew weeks after he already had to be in school by September. And I had a baby by then, my son,\nAndy, was born May the 4\", 1948. And when did you come to talk to me last time here?",
        "Q: It was maybe a couple of months ago?",
        "A: Was it after January or was it before?",
        "Q: After.",
        "A: Did I tell you that my son died?",
        "Q: No, I don\u2019t think you did.",
        "A: My oldest, this one, I\u2019m just talking about.",
        "Q: Oh, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: That was, that\u2019s why I wondered if it was after January, then you had to be here before January,\nbecause I would have mentioned it to you. But I\u2019m not sure when you were here.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t remember either.",
        "A: So, anyway my son was born. His name was Andy.",
        "Q: Was he named after your brother?",
        "A: Yes, kind of, because my brother\u2019s name was Andras. In our family, cousins and so on, I don\u2019t\nknow why, but so many people name their children... in Argentina it\u2019s Andres, in Hungary it\nwas Andras and in the United States it was Andrew. But I started it. I named him Andrew. His\nmiddle name was Allen. So, I stayed with a young couple for a few weeks in Budapest, and\nSandy had to be already, not Budapest, 1n Washington. He had to be in Bloomington. And the\nonly thing he could get was that trailer. So, he didn\u2019t want me to stay in Washington that long,\nand so I think I took the train, at that time trains were more popular, with my baby, who was five\nmonths old when we moved to Bloomington.",
        "Q: And you lived in this trailer with a five month old baby and no running water? How did you\nmanage?",
        "A: Well, that is where I am tough. I never thought that a baby should not have a bath, so every\nsingle day I would go and get the water, put it in that little bitty sink... that whole trailer was not\nas big as this porch. Not really.",
        "Q: And this porch is about 20 feet long...",
        "A: It could not have been that big.\n20",
        "Q: ...by 15 feet.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t know whether the Holocaust Museum is even interested in that kind of stuff. I just\ntell you. One section of it was that if you opened the studio, gosh that made a bed. That\u2019s what\nwe slept on. Then the middle part was just a little sink, a tiny, little sink and some sort of a\ncooking facility, tiny. And the third part of it was, it was kind of those round top of the trailers.\nThe campus, I heard, bought them all from somewhere for a dollar apiece. And we paid 25\ndollars for that. The third part was just big enough for a little crib, so I don\u2019t think it was as big\nas this. Might have been half of the size. I was very... I accepted that, too. And you know, I\nused to think, well now I\u2019m free and I\u2019m not in Auschwitz. Some people wouldn\u2019t have lived\nlike that, they rented an apartment maybe, housing place. Then they complained all the time that\nthe landlady told them that they use too much water and they have the lights on too long. And\nwe were kind of feeling that we do whatever we want in that little trailer. And so that was\nsomewhat our own, 25 dollars, all utilities included. You couldn\u2019t go any better. And Sandy\nwas making, getting some kind of a, you know he was on the G.I. Bill. And then in graduate\nschool he did some sort of a little extra work. So, the G.I. Bill paid his tuition. Maybe he got a\nhundred twenty-five dollars or whatever, 150 dollars a month. So the 25 dollars was for rent and\nthen we lived on the rest of it. (Laughing.) But again I just accepted things better than a lot of\npeople. My God, if I would see my friends\u2019 children now living under that condition, they would\nthink, \u201cMy God, I can\u2019t live like that.\u201d But we did. Then we moved into another trailer which\nwas a little taller and we didn\u2019t bump our heads all the time. Might have mentioned it, too. And\nthen we got a Hoosier Court apartment, where we had two bedrooms and a kitchen and it was\nnormal, for $42.50. And that\u2019s where we lived then all during the time we were in Bloomington.",
        "Q: A couple of questions, one is you talked a little bit about how you felt, and there were a few\nexamples of how you were kind of hiding your Jewish identity. You had your number removed,\nyour Auschwitz number removed from your arm. And you talked about how when you were\nworking at Garfinkels you didn\u2019t, you didn\u2019t want to talk...",
        "A: I worried because I, see now I can talk to anybody and I don\u2019t care, you know, that I would be\ndenying my religion. At that time, I worried, you know, what could be the consequences of that?\nOr I mentioned that, maybe in Mary K.\u2019s interview, but I will say when we moved to Louisville,\nKentucky and we lived in the South end, so that was in 1953. And I was in concentration camp\nin \u201845, so that was almost eight years after. And we had a neighbor next door, she took me\naround, showed me the Iroquois Park. It\u2019s a pretty city. They had a child my son\u2019s, Andy\u2019s age.\nAnd she asked me what church I go to. And I told her, \u201cI don\u2019t go to any church, I\u2019m Jewish.\u201d\nAnd I said it without any worry. But I thought to myself, if she still will speak to me after this,\nI\u2019m okay. If not...? See, and that was eight years after that.",
        "Q: What about your own relationship with Judaism? Did you do anything to, any, go to services?",
        "A: I\u2019m not, not in Bloomington, Indiana. It went through my mind a lot of times, what so many\nother refugees might have told you, maybe not, some people might have gotten more religious.\nSome people might have had some doubts. Where was God when all this happened? So that\nwent through my mind a lot. Now, Sandy\u2019s family was Orthodox and they were very religious.\n21\nWhen he came to this country, he asked his uncle, the first Rosh Hashanah, that he would like to\ngo to the synagogue. And the uncle, since he was married to a non-Jewish person, said, \u201cIll ask\na friend of mine. He\u2019ll pick you up.\u201d Well, in Hungary, when you went to the temple, you first\nof all didn\u2019t go by car. You couldn\u2019t drive on that day. So, somebody picked him up and took\nhim to the synagogue. It was not a, it was not a Conservative one. And maybe the men did not\nwear hats, maybe they did. The men and the women were together, not like in... even where I\nbelong to... his family was, they were Orthodox. Mine were not. But in our synagogue, the\nwomen sit upstairs and the men sit downstairs. So, he was very, very disappointed. An organ in\nthe synagogue, music, I mean everything, just what he never had before. And somehow it didn\u2019t\nremind him of anything he remembered. And that turned him off somehow. I mean, maybe\nshouldn\u2019t have, but it did. So some people could be considered very religious and they keep it\nup. He didn\u2019t. When I came out to this country, we did not belong to anything, at all. And I\nsomehow didn\u2019t miss it, but when my kids were getting to be Sunday school age, and that was\nalready in Louisville, Kentucky, then we did join a synagogue at the time.",
        "Q: Which one did you join?",
        "A: At that time it was called B\u2019rith Sholom. It was not a Conservative. But we did, because I felt\nlike the kids ought to have some Jewish background.",
        "Q: It was not Conservative? Is that what you said? Or it was?",
        "A: Let\u2019s see, which 1s the least religious?",
        "Q: Oh, Reform?",
        "A: Reformed. It was Reformed. Conservative is more religious. But there you would go and it was\nthe type, again, it reminded me more of a Protestant type of church. You know, it was just so\nstrange to me and of course everything was in English and very little in Hebrew. But we\nbelonged there and I went to the holidays and took the kids. But since we did not observe it, the\nway some, and I don\u2019t know how religious your family is, so I\u2019m not comparing myself to\nanybody else. I\u2019m just telling it to you. Therefore I didn\u2019t expect my children to become that\nreligious either. I took them to Sunday school, because I felt like they should have that\nbackground. But the Sunday schools at that time, at least where we belonged, was not anything\nthat I would think desirable. The teachers were just volunteer people. The discipline was not\nvery good. The kids could do anything they wanted to and if they left Sunday school and they\nwalked over to an ice cream place and they came back. I would hear stories like that. And that\ndisappointed me, because it didn\u2019t leave any impression on them. Now, the Sunday schools now\nthat, let me see, my daughter, Linda, is married to a Jewish guy. And they do belong and I do\ntoo, now, to Temple Shalom, which is actually one branch of the B\u2019rith Sholom, which long time\nago closed up. And Adath Israel and B\u2019rith Sholom merged and it became the Temple, which is\na big and fancy one and a lot of rich people belong there. And the Temple Shalom is a lot more\nReformed and we do like our rabbi very much. And I go on High Holy days. I don\u2019t go that\noften, but he\u2019s a real nice guy. And Linda\u2019s kids go to Sunday school. And the teachers are\nnice. They learn a lot more and they like to go. My kids didn\u2019t like to go, because they just\ndidn\u2019t get anything out of it. And I\u2019m sorry about that, but that\u2019s the way it was. Now, my son-\n22\nin-law here, Mark, actually even teaches Sunday school at that same place. And I felt like I\nwanted to join. Sandy wouldn\u2019t have cared either way. I said, now in my older age, I kind of\nfelt like... because I\u2019m not so religious, but I have my, a traditional background, which you can\nnever ever get out of your system. So, it\u2019s not the same as the way I remember the high holidays\nin Europe. Everything was in Hebrew and I remember on Yom Kippur, I would go and visit my\nfamily while they were sitting, all day long at the synagogue. We were not Orthodox. We didn\u2019t\nkeep kosher, so... and I like that. Because I knew a lot of religious people who... like in\nSandy\u2019s family maybe they didn\u2019t eat in their home, but they would go out and eat stuff that they\nreally shouldn\u2019t. Or Mark\u2019s family in Brooklyn, they were very religious. They kept kosher.\nWhen they come to visit to Louisville, we would go out for dinner and absolutely never failed\nthat the father would not order maybe bacon or ham or that kind of thing. And I felt like that\u2019s\nkind of, you know, it\u2019s not really true. Either you keep it or you don\u2019t keep it. They were very\nnice people. They\u2019re both dead now and I liked them very much. But my family wasn\u2019t like\nthat. We ate anything and we weren\u2019t... and I kind of like that. I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019re\nreligious or not, very religious or not.",
        "Q: How did you get from Bloomington to Louisville?",
        "A: Well, we were living in Bloomington from 1948 to 1951. My daughter, actually she\u2019s coming\ntomorrow from Seattle. She was born in 1950 in Bloomington. Andy was born in Washington,\nD.C. \u201851 we moved to Marion, Indiana and spent one year there. And I might have told that to\nMary K. Sandy was having to do his internship in Psychology at the VA Hospital, so we lived\nthere for one year. The rents over there were a lot more expensive now than in Bloomington on\nthe campus. And his pay was a little bit more, but not very much and I had two kids by then.\nAnd many of the wives of the people who were there on internship, did some work at night. And\nI wanted to do some work myself. And there was a glass factory, the Forbes. They\nmanufactured all kinds of bottles, just beer bottles, little bottles and so on. And I got a job there.\nI never done that kind of work, but I did it. And I went to work at six o\u2019clock in the evening. He\ncame home from the VA at 4:30. So, he took care of the kids and I went to work at six and came\nhome at midnight.",
        "Q: My goodness.",
        "A: And that was kind of hard work, but again I wanted to do it. And the only reason I wanted to do\nit because I wanted a couple of things that I felt like I can\u2019t afford. I wanted an ironing board,\nwhich happened to be the Mary Proctor ironing board, which was expensive at the time and\nactually not very long ago it finally broke on me. And Sandy would have liked to have a good\ncamera, so I decided I would work, because nothing extra like that we would have had enough\nmoney. I\u2019ll work for a month or two, I thought, but then I couldn\u2019t leave the work. And I\nworked all the way until it was time for us to leave. I can\u2019t remember what the pay was. I do\nknow that it was really cold in winter time, because you had assembly lines and close to a door\nand it was freezing. And it would have, have you ever seen a Charlie Chaplin movie, you know?\nLike where the best part of my work was when there was something wrong with the assembly\nline and the machine stopped. And there would be a space. Otherwise you just had to constantly\npick up the bottles, check them for a minute, like this, and put them in a box. And you could not\nstop. Then somebody would be coming and relieve you in order to go to the restroom. And I did\n23\nthat from all the way till the end of our staying there, which was sometimes in the middle of\nsummer. And we went back to Bloomington, Indiana, because he had to get his Ph.D. See that\nwas just a year internship. Not much to be told about that year. You know, I had two kids and I\nworked and he worked, so not much was happening.",
        "Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism at all during that period?",
        "A: No, not there. But I don\u2019t think in Marion, yet, I talked to anybody about that. First of all, we\nknew a few people, but we didn\u2019t make too many friends. And the subject never came up. And I\nwas so busy with the kids that, you know, I didn\u2019t talk about it, or... I remember we were\nrenting in Marion, a National home for 92 dollars. And I was sick one time with strep throat.\nAnd Sandy got a call somewhere about some pay raise, something. And he got so excited and he\nwas doing the laundry. And we had some sort of washing machine that you had to stop it in\nbetween all the periods. And suddenly the water overflowed and the water was coming all over\nthe whole National home, you know, it\u2019s... I don\u2019t know if you know what they are like. They\nare pre-fab houses, so they\u2019re not very super, but it was nice. It was like a two or three bedroom\nlittle house with a modern kitchen. It was very nice. So then not much happened in Marion and\nwe went back to Bloomington, Indiana. And we bought a car. That was our first time that we\nhad a car already in Marion. And I learned, actually practiced, how to drive at the VA, because\nit was just a nice big campus that no traffic. But my real experience for learning how to drive\nwas still in Bloomington, Indiana. For five dollars, we got like a course, and I learned how to\ndrive, but since we didn\u2019t have a car, I couldn\u2019t practice it. So, in Marion we did have a car and I\npracticed how to drive. And I went back to Bloomington, Indiana, I got my license.\nEnd of Tape 2, Side A\n24\nTape 2, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape number two, side B.",
        "A: So then we... how did we get to Louisville, your question was. A friend of Sandy\u2019s heard about\na job and he was offered that job. It was a post-doctoral fellowship at the Child Guidance Clinic\nhere in Louisville. And his name was Fred Kanfer and he was more an experimental\npsychologist, not a clinical psychologist. And he did not want the job and he mentioned it to\nSandy. And so he came to Louisville and he applied for it. And he got that job at the Child\nGuidance Clinic, which was for one year only. And that was kind of very nice. We lived in an\napartment in the South end, it\u2019s where I met the person, who I first felt like, she still must like\nme, even so that she found out that I was Jewish. Now that was many years later. And the\npeople at the Child Guidance Clinic were very, very nice. They are all older social workers or\npsychiatrists or psychologists. They practically took us in like a family. They had lot of family\nget-togethers. And we didn\u2019t go out otherwise. Because then my daughter was born, Linda was\nborn, in 1954. So we moved to Louisville in \u201853 and we still lived in the South end when she\nwas born. And our assignment was only for one year. And now my story is really important\nhere, but I couldn\u2019t see myself moving in September when she was supposed to born in\nSeptember. And we didn\u2019t have much money because that pay was, you know, quite little. And\nour apartment at the Washington Park apartments was already then eighty-two dollars and\nninety-five cents or so. We had to pay utilities, too. So I told Sandy just anything he could do.\nAnd by then I could walk to the grocery, because it was right behind our apartments. I could\nwalk, we had one car, I could walk to the pediatrician. And I never did anything else, like go to\ntown or do that kind of stuff. And I said, \u201cI wish we could stay just at least maybe for one more\nyear, so we don\u2019t have to move just exactly in September.\u201d Because they usually would have\nseminars and then people would go to those seminars and then people come with job\nopportunities. So Sandy would have had to go to one of those things and find a job. And we\nwould have had to move. Well, it was very, very hard even for me to imagine and so, the Child\nGuidance Clinic gave him a part time job. And at Norton he worked part time and in one other\nhospital it was part time. I mean, just very little, here and there. Then he met two psychiatrists,\nwho needed somebody and they became our friends, too. And they needed somebody who\nwould do some testing for them. And they offered him to try and see if he would like that. And\nhe tried it and they offered him a nice salary and that\u2019s how we stayed in Louisville. He worked\nwith them for a long time. And those psychiatrists are still alive and they are very nice people.\nWe\u2019re still friends. And Linda was born in \u201854, so I didn\u2019t have to move away. And then we\nstayed in the apartments until 1957. And we were looking for a house and we found this and we\nhave been here ever since.",
        "Q: What year was that, that you moved here?",
        "A: 1957. So, from \u201853 to \u201857 we lived there. At that time, I didn\u2019t have my fourth child, yet. Now\nthere is, if you have any questions about our stay here, you can ask me. And then... but you ask\nme, because I don\u2019t know what you want.\n25",
        "Q: I wondered about when you first arrived and you talked about, you mentioned a little earlier, you\nhad a taken a walk through Iroquois Park and so forth, and it occurred to me that at that time,\nIroquois Park was segregated and black people, I think, were not...",
        "A: Was it?",
        "Q: Yeah, I read something about that. I was wondering if you noticed segregation in Louisville and\nwhether that, because you had mentioned earlier that 1t made an impression on you that black\npeople were treated differently than whites.",
        "A: Tell me, when was the Civil Right Movement and the Martin Luther King, and when... you\nknow I\u2019ve been watching those programs all the time, but I don\u2019t remember the dates. When\nwas it that finally, really, for example, black people didn\u2019t have to sit on the back of the bus and\nall that? Do you remember dates like that?",
        "Q: It was different in different cities, and I\u2019m not sure exactly for Louisville. But probably mid-\n1960s, early 1960s.",
        "A: Because I remember the Civil Rights movements in the \u201860s. I didn\u2019t, it didn\u2019t leave any special\nimpression with me. I didn\u2019t go anywhere much, you know. I was very busy with the kids. And\nI didn\u2019t even watch, well we didn\u2019t have any television at that time, I remember. It was later.\nAnd when you get busy, I spend a lot more time now, listening to the news and being involved.\nBut I was a very conscientious mother and there was just a lot to do. By then I had three kids\nand you know, diapers and just... I was very, very busy. And since Sandy worked, day and very\nmany times in the evening, he wasn\u2019t really that much of a help. He couldn\u2019t. In summertime\nwe would go one vacation, we did every year. Because his uncle in Washington had a summer\nhome in Annapolis, Maryland and he offered for us to go there. So, we would leave in the\nevening and drive all night to get to Annapolis by next day. And we would spend two weeks\nthere, which was again, some mothers might have been complaining about it, but I did not. It\nwasn\u2019t really that easy on me, because, you know, I did the cooking and it wasn\u2019t a luxury. But\nthe kids had a good time, you know, Sandy would take them out and they would fish and maybe\nthey go on a boat ride. But Linda was still a baby, so I was really more like a mom over there,\nthan it was a really exciting vacation. So, we had done that for many years, till my youngest one\nwas two years old, and then they sold that place. But no, I did not remember anything that I was\nthat worried about that. And when we come to schools maybe, you might like to... and I will\nhave a really important story, too, about my oldest son, Andy, who... the school was nearby us\nhere, where we live even now. That\u2019s where he went to elementary school.",
        "Q: What was the name of the school?",
        "A: Belknap, Belknap Elementary School, which is no longer existing, the building is there, but no\nmore. And all my kids went to that school. Then, we, well in the South end, I\u2019m sorry we lived.\nAndy went to, isn\u2019t that funny, I forgot the name of it, now. There was an elementary school\nthere. And he was in fourth grade when we moved here. And my youngest daughter, I mean\nElizabeth was two years younger, so she went to kindergarten over there. And the name would\ncome to me later, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that important. So in here, since we lived all our life here,\n26\nlet me just talk about that. They went to Belknap Elementary School. And then to, and Andy\nfinished here. He was in sixth grade. And he met some really nice friends on our street. Then\nthey went to Highland Junior High School. Now, the friend, who we met here and became\nfriendly with Andy was two years older. Non-Jewish people, he was very liberal type. And he\nstarted a club. I don\u2019t know how much you know about social clubs. We belonged to the Jewish\nCommunity Center, too. Sandy was pretty against those things, but he always said, I wish they\nwould ask them and I wish they could refuse it, meaning, you know... because he had problems,\nyou know, as a child psychologist with kids, they\u2019re so upset and depressed over that they were\nnot included in one of those clubs. And those social clubs were horrible things, but they existed.\nSo, my kids were invited to it, but they weren\u2019t terribly active at the Jewish Community Center.\nFor example, they had those, it\u2019s really not important to even talk about. But Andy\u2019s friend\nstarted a new club. It was called the Princeton. And there was no question that blacks should\nnot be a part of it or Jews should not be part of it, he was that kind of a kid.",
        "Q: You mean there was no question, that of course blacks should be part of 1t?",
        "A: They should be part of it. I mean his was an integrated club and that was his main concern, that\nanybody, Jews or blacks should be able to... whether they did or not, I\u2019m not sure. But Andy\nwas Jewish and he was part of that club. So, he finished, that was junior high school and I\ncannot talk forever about anything. Then he went to Atherton High School and he finished that.\nAnd he was in the marching band, but he never liked to wear uniforms. He had had to, would\nhave, but they were just kind of... that psychiatrist\u2019s son, who gave Sandy the job, he had a son\nAndy\u2019s age. And they were together in the marching band. And they would carry their uniform.\nThey wouldn\u2019t be caught dead putting it on and go like that. [ll try to make that all brief. He\ngraduated from high school in 1966 and went away to college to Lawrence University in\nAppleton, Wisconsin. He left in September. I got him all ready, with clothes and everything\nelse. By then I had my youngest one, who was six years old, because he was born in 1960...",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Robert, the younger one, who is now living in Nashville. Well, my big tragedy comes now, that\nin September he moved to Appleton, Wisconsin. Friday before Thanksgiving in November,\nSandy left, went to Atlanta to a psychological meeting. I was just cleaning up all the leaves in\nthe yard, got a call from Appleton that Andy was in an accident. Well, what happened, that they\nlived on the dorm... and there was a church, which was already barricaded and people didn\u2019t go\nin there, but sometimes they did, with the idea boys will be boys. One of Andy\u2019s friends asked\nhim if he wouldn\u2019t mind coming up there. And Andy says, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve been there last week. I\ndon\u2019t want to go.\u201d \u201cOh, come on, I don\u2019t want to go by myself.\u201d That kid wanted a light bulb. I\nmean silly thing, it doesn\u2019t make any sense. They went up into the place. It was barricaded, but\npeople went in all the time, because it was kind of like a hiding place. And they were way up\nhigh and he stepped on a false ceiling, that was... he was in the front and the boy was behind\nhim and he fell through, 35 feet. And I got the phone call. They wanted me to say that anything\nthey can do, that I should give my... I said my husband was out of town. So I want to make that\nstory kind of short, but it was...",
        "Q: What year?\n27",
        "A: It was in 1966 in November. So, I got into my car, quick went over to that psychiatrist friend of\nours, who was just recuperating from pneumonia. I told him quick what happened. He was\ntrying to reach Sandy in Atlanta. He called the hospital. He told them, they do whatever they\nneed to do. (Coughs.) Stop it now for a minute, I\u2019m going to get some...",
        "Q: Go ahead.",
        "A: The reason this is important, because at that time when this happened, I thought to myself, the\nHolocaust was enough. And I didn\u2019t expect to have another something like this to happen. But I\nhandled that pretty well, too. But I remember when the telephone calls were done and my\nfriend\u2019s wife offered that she\u2019ll come with me to Appleton. And I said, well maybe that\u2019s not\nnecessary. We left John Bell, Dr. Bell 1s the psychiatrist who reached Sandy at the Atlanta\nairport and he turned right back around on the airplane. So my friend, his wife, took me to the\nairport and we felt if he will be on that plane that we were supposed to be taking, then Nancy\nwould not come with me. In the meantime, I had to leave my six year old son, Linda was ten and\nElizabeth was twelve. But at that time, Sandy has a sister, whose daughter just graduated from\nhigh school, who was Andy\u2019s age. And she came to stay with us for a whole year. And that was\nthe year that she was staying here, from Buenos Aires, Argentina. And she had a hard time to\nadjust, too. She was very homesick. But at that time she already decided she\u2019s staying. Now,\nshe was a, she was, she liked to cook, and she was... well, I had a help in the house too, not all\nthe time, but a couple times a week. So, I just packed my stuff. I remember the kids all standing\nnext to me. And I thought about cold weather and warm weather and I packed my suitcase. And\nwith her, with Kathy being here, who is 18. No, I\u2019m sorry, Elizabeth was sixteen and Linda was\ntwelve and Robert was six. So, anyway, I said, \u201cI just have to leave.\u201d And I was hoping that\neverything will turn out okay. And I\u2019m still seeing the kids standing there, they were, you know,\nof course terribly worried. And I went to the airport. Sandy was on that plane coming back from\nAtlanta and we flew to Appleton, Wisconsin. It was in the middle of the night. We didn\u2019t know\nwhat we were going to find. And it was, you know, really heartbreaking in a way, and we...\nsomebody took us into the hospital and Andy was under all kind of wires. And he was in a coma\nactually for about three days, completely out of it. And Sandy stayed with me until he was\ncoming to, and... not that he was better, but he was not in a coma anymore. And one very\nimportant story I must tell you. The day we arrived, of course there was an article in that, in the\nAppleton paper. And somebody called the hospital and wanted to meet the parents of this young\nboy. And that was a Catholic family, a mother and a father, who had also four children, but they\nwere already older and out of the house. And they came to the hospital and not even knowing\nme or Sandy, they offered their house. They lived pretty close to the hospital. That I could stay\nwith them. And they were wonderful. And now see, something like that makes me cry. I was\nthere for six weeks and I could walk from the hospital to their home. The kids were out of her\nhouse already, so she had a place. I could talk to somebody at night about how things are going.\nAnd otherwise I spent the whole day in the hospital. See the result of all this was, that\neventually, I mean, his spinal cord was injured and he became a paraplegic. But we didn\u2019t know\nthat for a long time, you know. I don\u2019t know if you know anybody, when people are this sick,\nthat for example they have movements in their leg, which is just nothing. It doesn\u2019t mean\nanything. But sometimes I would talk to them on the phone all the time. See Sandy stayed for a\nlittle while and then he went back home. So, I talked to them on the phone all the time and\n28\neventually I got, and I still have that, I never wanted to throw it away. I thought now when Andy\ndied, then maybe I will throw it away. I can not. I have letters and letters and letters people\nwrote to me, to the hospital. And I still have them. In fact, just a little while ago, I re-read them.\nI never, never could open those letters until just recently. And they were helping with the kids\nand they were bringing food for them and you know, they were... the kids were wonderful.\nThey were behaving very nicely. And so, I was there for six weeks. At Christmas time or\nholiday time, they came, all of them, to Appleton. And that\u2019s the only time we stayed in a hotel,\nbecause this family, named Alice and Art, children came home for the holidays and there was not\nenough room. But that made it so much easier for me. And of course, I couldn\u2019t sleep well and I\ngot some tranquilizers from this psychiatrist doctor. Which even maybe even two pills couldn\u2019t\nmake me relax enough. But I there again was... I don\u2019t think I cried. I was under tremendous\ntension all the time, and not knowing what the outcome will be. Appleton was finished. Finally\nwe decided that we can bring him home. So, with an ambulance we brought him home to\nLouisville. And of course, he couldn\u2019t sit up or anything like that. I mean, it was... he was\nparalyzed from waist down. But at that time he wasn\u2019t absolutely sure about it, but they gave\nhim a final test. And the final test showed that the spinal cord was completely severed, so\ninjured, and that doesn\u2019t look like, you know, it can be ever... but making the story short, we put\nhim here in Louisville, into a hospital, which at that time was the St. Anthony Hospital. We had\na friend who was that kind of doctor who dealt with this kind of injuries, except... he was a\nwonderful man, he was a friend, but he didn\u2019t know enough about the whole deal. Because I\nremember we were very disappointed. The hospital, like the orderly put him, in the bathroom,\nput him on the toilet and left him there. I mean his back was... he shouldn\u2019t have done that. He\nwas there for six weeks and at the very end, our friend, the psychiatrist, made arrangements at\nthe Rusk Institute in New York City. That they can transfer him there. Which they did, and just\nvery briefly, before they left, a nurse offered, private nurse will stay with us for the weekend,\nbefore Andy goes, because Andy wanted to come home for the weekend. Well, that woman was\nabsolutely, she should have never been a nurse. She tried to show, she said that she had a\ndaughter who had polio and that daughter of hers walked after a while. She kept on telling\nAndy, if you have faith, you will be walking again. Well, she should have never said that. And\nthen we were over here in that weekend in my house. She made him, with crutches and braces,\nstand above behind the wheelchair. And Kathy, who 1s a big, heavyset girl, sat in the wheelchair.\nAnd he wanted to prove something, that how much he advanced. Well, with the braces, he\ncouldn\u2019t walk, but she made him stand up. So, then he sat in a chair in the living room and he\nsays, \u201cBoy that feels good.\u201d And the nurse says, \u201cMaybe it feels good for you, but it\u2019s not...\nmaybe it feels good, but it\u2019s not good for you.\u201d And Andy says, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not good for me,\nbut it still feels good.\u201d And the woman got so angry, that came out to the kitchen and says, \u201cI\u2019m\nleaving.\u201d And I went out to the kitchen... yes, I did cry then. I gave her the check, what I owed\nher. And I couldn\u2019t believe it, he was sitting in that chair upstairs. And Sandy calls home, \u201cHow\nis everything going?\u201d And I says, whatever the nurse\u2019s name was, she left. \u201cI\u2019ll be right home.\u201d\nSo, he came home and we had some real good friends, who are still our friends. He used to be\nour family doctor and his wife, and Doctor Eskind and his wife came over because they knew\nAndy\u2019s going to leave. And they wanted to say good-bye to him. And Andy\u2019s sitting in the\nchair. I tell them the whole story. They couldn\u2019t believe it. And finally Sandy and Harold\nEskind help him down... we have all those steps... helped him down to the bedroom. And\nHarold says, \u201cPll come over tomorrow morning.\u201d See she was supposed to be here and help us\ngetting him ready. I mean, you know, with a paraplegic, it takes a long time to do that. And\n29\nHarold said, \u201cPll come over early in the morning, because I\u2019m not sure when the plane was\nleaving.\u201d And we said, \u201cOh don\u2019t worry about it. We\u2019ll just get up an hour earlier,\u201d or\nwhatever. And Robert that night, who was only six, slept in the TV room right opposite of our\nbedroom. I mean, he was upset and he was worried. And he woke up with a hundred and four\nfever. And so, as I said, loud, I said, \u201c\u201cGod, we sure could use Doctor Eskind now. And as I said\nthat, apparently our living room was open and he did come anyway. And he was walking in and\nhe says, \u201cHere Iam.\u201d That was, you know, like an angel coming from heaven. He helped us get,\nhe helped us getting Andy ready. He gave Robert a shot, I think, whatever he needed. I didn\u2019t\ngo with them. It was only Sandy and Andy who flew to... the Ruskin Institute did marvels. He\nwas there for six weeks. Luckily his mind was completely well. They taught him how to drive.\nThey taught him how to get dressed. They taught him complete independency. And Andy used\nto be a very stubborn kid as a young person. When he wanted to do something, he wanted to do\nit right then. And that helped him tremendously in his accident. Of course, he decided and I\nhave a beautiful paper, which he wrote, then later he... I don\u2019t want to jump ahead of myself, but\nhe learned how to do all this. He got acar. It had a hand control. And he was home the first\nyear. He used to have a girlfriend from Myrtle Beach from before his accident. He says he\nwants to visit her. And we begged him, it\u2019s too early, yet. I mean he... all by himself to go to\nNorth Carolina or wherever the girl lived. He says, \u201cIf I would know that I\u2019m going to walk next\nyear, I would wait, but since I know I\u2019m not going to, I want to do it right now.\u201d _He got in the\ncar, he drove over there. I said, \u201cPlease call us the minute you get there.\u201d He did. So, anyway\nhe was really unbelievably... you know, I still say that. Then he went back to Lawrence, he\nwent back to Lawrence University for a semester. And he did very well, but it got very cold\nthere in Wisconsin and the snow was so high, that he couldn\u2019t even get out of his dormitory to\nget to the, like to the classes. So, Sandy sent somebody, a young man, who moved him back and\nhe was transferred to Houston, Texas. To the University where the climate is different. So, he\nwent back there and he finished college in three and a half years, instead of four. I mean, he\nmade up. And in summer time, he went to Chapel Hill, North Carolina and spent summer school\nthere. And one summer he went to Boston, to Harvard, just for a semester. So, he made up all\nhis lost time. He finished and then he moved out to California. He was very independent. He\ndid everything on his own. And in the beginning, he didn\u2019t really want to come back that much.\nI think the memories and all that. For example, he was fighting that we shouldn\u2019t put an elevator\nin the house. He didn\u2019t want us to move and we didn\u2019t. We tried to put an elevator in, but with\nthis split-level it wasn\u2019t that easy. And when he would come home, he was so matter of fact of\nanybody who wanted to help him, lift him up. I mean, he got used to the idea. Then he decided\nhe\u2019s going to go to Social Work school. And he applied to Kent Social Work School (ph) and\nthat\u2019s when he wrote... I could give you that, I mean just for your own fun. When he applied to\nthe school, he wrote a beautiful paper, which now after he died, Sandy made a bunch of copies of\nthem. And just since you\u2019re interested and all, I give you a copy of that and also a newspaper\nclipping after he died. He got interested in California and don\u2019t ask me why, with a Lyndon\nLaRouche political group. I don\u2019t know if you ever heard of him or not. But he met tremendous\namount and good friends through all those years, who became so close to him, that in the\nbeginning, I wondered what they are like. But then later on we met them. They became, besides\nthe political adventures, they were interested in poetry. And Andy also loved music, became\nmore and more so. He had a selection of CD\u2019s bigger than we have. And he, first they lived in\nSan Francisco, then they moved to Livermore, California and I visited him there. I met some of\nthose people. And then they moved to Los Angeles and I was there. Now just a year and a half\n30\nago, couple of years ago, he had to have a surgery, a bladder surgery. The doctor recommended\nhim, that if he wouldn\u2019t do it, then eventually his kidneys would become infected by it. He\ndecided, we asked a lot of informations whether is that a good thing to do. And everybody\nrecommended. And I went to Los Angeles. I stayed with him for three and a half weeks, while\nhe had the surgery. When... Sandy and I went together and then after Sandy had to leave and I\nstayed. And the people were very, very nice. They gave a big party. And they were singing and\nthey read poetry before he went into the hospital. Then after that they kept on coming all the\ntime. They enlarged the bladder, took a part of the intestine and made the bladder bigger. So,\nanyway, that was the... whatever they had to do. . In fact, both of his doctors were\nJewish, just so happened that from the name I could tell. Nice, nice people, very nice. And he\nwas in a hospital in Los Angeles, in a Mexican, you know, there were a lot of Mexican and\nSpanish speaking people there. And I worried a little bit, because he didn\u2019t have to pay a penny.\nIt was, you know he was... since he was a handicapped person, he had all the facilities there,\nwhich were paid. And they were wonderful. So, I was pleased with that. He recuperated. We\nwent home and he worried that his appetite is not as good as it used to be. I said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\nmean, they messed up your stomach. You\u2019ll be all right.\u201d So, my big job was cooking for him,\nplus showing him the CD\u2019s, which one he wants first. And we played all day long. The people\nhe lived with, he had two roommates. Andy never got married, two guys. They were very nice.\nThen I came home. Then I have never seen him afterwards, but he was all right. He was going\nto come back. And one day, on a Sunday, January 24\", I get a phone call from his roommate.\nAnd Chuck says, \u201cI have very sad news for you.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat?\u201d I thought he might have\ngotten sick again and then I would have gone out to be with him. Well, he died in his sleep. He\ndidn\u2019t wake up. It was a Sunday morning, from Saturday to Sunday. Saturday night, he was in\nthe office and they were doing some kind of an experiment. They were really bright, intelligent\npeople. How they got involved with Lyndon LaRouche...\nEnd of Tape 2, Side B\n31\nTape 3, Side A",
        "A: And I dealt with it, but I remember when I got this news I couldn\u2019t believe it. And I still right\nnow, when I say to you that Auschwitz seems like a dream and it wasn\u2019t me. Sometimes I think\nof this and I said, \u201cIs it really true that he\u2019s no longer alive?\u201d But then again, I measure certain\nthings. We used to worry, what will happen to Andy when we die, and this group falls apart?\nMy daughter, Linda, she\u2019s a nurse and she says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I'll take care of him.\u201d Well,\nAndy didn\u2019t like to be taken care of. He could do everything in the world on his own. Anything.\nDriving, shopping. I mean you wouldn\u2019t believe it, if I give you something about this, you\nwouldn\u2019t believe it. Like we have a friend here, who took him on a Sierra weekend, canoe trip.\nAnd in the mud, she pushed the wheelchair and he would get into the canoe. I mean, there was\nnothing that he would not want to do. He was just brave. And when I got this note, I mean I\ncouldn\u2019t believe it. And we didn\u2019t know quite what to do. We had Sandy\u2019s sister here from\nHungary for three months, who was eighty-four years old. She took this very hard, plus she was\ntoo old to travel. So, my youngest son, Robert, offered that he\u2019ll come with me to Los Angeles.\nAnd we flew over there a week later. That was the end of, it was January 31\u201c that they had a\nmemorial service for him. And it was really very, very nice. When I went into that room... and\nI know Jewish funerals, well that wasn\u2019t a funeral, just a memorial. They had some flowers.\nThey had a big poster of Andy. He was very involved with... he loved Shakespeare, and they\nwere very intellectual, but at the same time they were just nice, nice people. And we had a\nlovely... the whole memorial service lasted for three and half hours and about 11:30, well\neverybody decided, it\u2019s time to quit. But there were speeches and people were sending letters\nand all the letters were, some people read poems. The day when this happened, in Andy\u2019s house,\nthey were meeting for a poetry reading group, at 11 o\u2019clock, every Sunday. And Andy didn\u2019t get\nup on time, so they were kind of thinking that he went to bed late, maybe he just didn\u2019t wake up.\nBut they... and they wondered why, but they weren\u2019t going to wake him up. And later on, a few\nhours later, when he still wasn\u2019t up, Chuck opened his door and he was in bed, asleep. And he\nhad died maybe about maybe three, four o\u2019clock. So, he did not take good care of his eating\nhabits, I think. He loved all the things which are really not that good for you, butter and salami.\nHe exercised, but only in the wheelchair, naturally. And he just, it had to be a, it was his heart,\nyou know, like he must have had clogged-up arteries. Although when he had that surgery, they\nchecked him out and he was okay then. I mean, there were no problems, but that was a year and\na half later. And that\u2019s really what happened. Now you can ask me all kinds of questions.",
        "Q: Did you ever feel angry after that, at that point? You talked about...",
        "A: I felt angry when he had his accident, but not really angry. I just could not accept, I thought that\none... you know, just there is so much one person should take. And I felt to myself, it\u2019s not fair.\nBut in the meantime, I realized that it\u2019s nothing fair, you know, this friend of mine, who was\ngoing to take me to Annapolis and who was very sympathetic and they had four kids and one of\nthem was a good friend of Andy. Their older son was coming home, not even a year afterwards\nthat this happened, coming home from college, and was in a car accident and died in a car\naccident. So, Nancy said she always, she... at that time, I talked about this at the airport. We\nwere waiting for the plane to come. I told her the same thing I\u2019m telling you, that I thought that,\nyou know, that I had my share and it\u2019s just not fair that now this had to happen. And Nancy after\nthat realized, it\u2019s nothing 1s fair. There is no... whatever...\n32",
        "Q: Justice?",
        "A: Justice. Whatever is assigned for you, it will happen and you cannot say, just because this\nhappened, nothing else would happen. So, I\u2019m now prepared and I hope nothing else would\nhappen, but after he died, I wasn\u2019t angry about that, I was more angry about his... well, not\nangry, but sad when he had the accident. Because no matter how he accepted it and he was great\nby it. And I will give you that, I really will give you, because you seem interested in it. The way\nhis friends talked about it all. That he never married. If he would have been old in the\nwheelchair, he would have needed help, you know. Those people were his friends, but they were\nnot the family. If we would have died, we would have wondered. So, I used to think about that,\nwhat will happen to him. And he lived on the absolute minimum, you know? Like my youngest\nson, Robert, he has a big house, he has a boat. And he\u2019s an administer, I mean a hospital\nadminister, administrator. Andy, nothing, he didn\u2019t, you know he was in the 1960s. When the\nCivil Rights movement was... he was paralyzed... from Texas, he took a bus to Washington,\nD.C. when they had the march. And in the bus, his toes got burned, because his foot was close to\nthe heater and he could never feel it. And Sandy was saying, \u201cDo you think you have to go or\nyou want to go?\u201d I mean, he was there. He said, \u201cIf everybody would feel like that they\nshouldn\u2019t go and use all kinds of excuses, then nobody would be there.\u201d So, he just... causes\nwere terribly important to him. And now you have to just ask questions. I can\u2019t talk to you\nabout anything.",
        "Q: Well, I asked about the anger, because it\u2019s striking to me that you came out of the war and you\nhad lost, your whole family had been killed. And that was, of course, a terrible, terrible blow,\nbut my impression of you, from what you\u2019ve told me, is that you were very calm throughout.\nAnd then you jumped right into marriage and you had kids and you moved and you settled down.\nAnd then losing your son to such, to this...",
        "A: Well that\u2019s, as I said, that can, if I think over all that six weeks in Appleton and now, you know, I\nmean we got hundreds... well, then we had a memorial service in Louisville, after we came\nback. And I told you that we now belong to Temple Shalom. And when this happened, we got\nthe news of Andy dying. Linda and Mark, my daughter and husband came over, and I said, I\nwould like our rabbi to know this. And Mark called, his name is Stanley Miles. He\u2019s a very nice\nguy, turned out that he\u2019s Andy\u2019s age, lives around the corner. And he says, \u201cI'll be right over.\u201d\nThat was at night. And I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t really have to come, but I wanted you to know it,\u201d\nbecause I was thinking then, that I would like to have some sort of a memorial service or\nsomething for him in Louisville. And he came over and he was visiting with us. And he really\ndidn\u2019t know, he knows my daughter and her husband, better than he did us. Because as I said,\nwe\u2019re not such a, that we go constantly to the synagogue. But I was terribly impressed with him.\nAnd he was so nice and he learned a lot about Andy\u2019s life, because we told him. We said we\nwould like to have a memorial service and we did, in the Temple. February 28. See, that was\nJanuary, but then we wanted... my daughter from Seattle came home. And Sandy has three\ncousins that, psychiatrist\u2019s kids, who were in Washington when I arrived. And we keep, you\nknow, in touch and they like us very much. Without us asking, they all wanted to come and I\nwas very touched by it and they did come with their families. And we had to get all that put\ntogether, so it was February twenty-eight. And it was in the newspaper and then it was in the\n33\nJewish Post, you know we have a community paper with the community center. And there must\nhave been over two hundred people at that. I don\u2019t even know, because I sat in the first row. I\nnever looked back. And the rabbi was... and we played some music, the kind of things that he\nliked. And it was like a string quartet of Schubert. The name of it is, \u201cThe Death of a Maiden,\u201d\nand I used to joke with him. I said, \u201cWhen I die, that\u2019s what I want them to play.\u201d And he liked\nit too, so we did that. And the rabbi was very nice, talked about us, talked about Andy, as much\nas he learned from us. He met him, actually, once, because my grandson had a Bar Mitzvah two\nyears ago. He\u2019s now 15, when he was 13 years old. And Andy came for that. And then the\nrabbi asked him to read something at that occasion. So, he met him. He knew he was in the\nwheelchair, but otherwise he didn\u2019t know that much about him except what we told him. That\nI\u2019m not angry... I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not that type, I think. I don\u2019t get really, I don\u2019t have many\npeople that I don\u2019t like or that I get angry with. I just accept things.",
        "Q: What about, you mentioned earlier, that you\u2019ve taken trips back to Hungary. Have you?",
        "A: Oh, a lot of times. The first time, I didn\u2019t want to go back, maybe ever. But in 1971, I decided I\ngo back. The first time a friend wanted to take me to the house where I was living up to the age\n12. It\u2019s... the houses in Europe are closed up, you know, the big doors and you can\u2019t see inside.\nSo, that person rang the doorbell and I was very reluctant to do this. And somebody came to the\ndoor and he says, \u201cWell this young lady lived in this house long time ago.\u201d They took me in. Of\ncourse, nothing was the way it was at the time, because in the meantime there was a war. There\nwere chicken and pigs, you know like. We had flower gardens then. But what I appreciated,\nthey wanted to know if I wanted to go inside and I said, \u201cNo thank you.\u201d I really didn\u2019t want to\ngo back, because it was just, I remember those years so much and I just didn\u2019t want to. And\nduring the communism, you know, they divided the house. That was a big house, so that house\nwas divided into about three or four different sections. I didn\u2019t want to go in. And then the next\ntime... that was in \u201871. Of course it, I mean the first time, it was really hard. I didn\u2019t want to run\ninto anybody who I used to know from olden time, but luckily they died. You know like, I\nwould have never wanted to run into a police official person, who was in charge of making us go\nto the ghetto. The Germans gave them the orders, but somebody had to carry it through. Well, I\nnever, never ran into them. I never saw anybody. Old friends of ours, who we really liked, we\nkept in touch with. And we had a very, very, very good friend... this year was really hard for us,\nnot only that Andy died. And we had a real good friend in Hungary, who was from our\nhometown, who was a musicologist. And all our trips we took in the last few years... we were in\nSpain and in Italy and in Sicily and in Greece, several times. We did that with that couple. He\nwas a few years younger. His name was George Kroo and we loved him and his wife and he\nloved us. And one day I got a phone call from his daughter that his father died, he had a heart\nattack, at work. So Sandy went to Hungary to his funeral. He was married to a non-Jewish girl,\nbut we loved them dearly. So, I never even want to go on any trips. And we had another good\nfriend in Washington, D.C., who was George\u2019s friend, our friend, he just died. And had cancer.\nI mean, it\u2019s just, about four people from our life, who were kind of close to us, they all died\nwithin one year.",
        "Q: I wanted to know about, after you moved to Louisville, did you have any contact with other\nHolocaust survivors who were living here?\n34",
        "A: I had a Hungarian friend, who was pretty neurotic and she was supposedly in Auschwitz maybe\nfor a month and then she was taken away. We didn\u2019t really talk too much about it, but I didn\u2019t\nhave really close contacts with people. Then I had another Jewish friend, she died too, in the\nmeantime, who survived the Nazism in Budapest. Hiding. And that\u2019s a different way of doing it\nthere, you know, that like the Anne Frank. So we once in a while talked about it, but we did not\ntalk about this like all the time. And I don\u2019t know how the other people, who now I see them\nonce a year, when we have this... either at the movie theater or at the Jewish Community...\nevery year it is somewhere else. Where they have the Shoah, July, no not in July. They usually\nhave it here, somehow in May. We had ours just not too long ago. And in Hungary they have\none, always, exactly the time when the ghetto was evacuated and taken away. Then in the\ncemetery they have a big... and I\u2019ve never been there at that time. And then people come from\nBudapest, people who lived in Hungary before, I mean in Eger before, who had relatives. They\nwould come to this. But, no I really don\u2019t have any contact with any of the other Holocaust\nsurvivors here.",
        "Q: And is that occasion of going to the annual Yom ha Shoah event...",
        "A: Well, yeah...",
        "Q: _...it\u2019s much easier for you to do this?",
        "A: ...yes, to me, yes it 1s.",
        "Q: ...to see the other people...",
        "A: No, not that, it\u2019s for me, that\u2019s one way for me to remember my parents and my family. That\u2019s\none way, like some people light candles. Some people can go to a grave. In fact, when Andy\ndied, they cremated his body and it came back. And there was a question, how and where?\nThere is a beautiful cemetery here, it\u2019s Cave Hill Cemetery. And I didn\u2019t know that Jewish\npeople can be buried there. But it\u2019s a beautiful place. In Spring it is beautiful, in Fall it\u2019s\nbeautiful. There is a lake, a lot of sculptures all over. And it\u2019s just that people come and visit\nwithout visiting any graves. And I\u2019ve heard that Temple Shalom has a lot. When I heard that, I\nfigured, well Jews must be... and then I had some friends whose husbands are buried there. And\nwe decided we\u2019re going to do that. And Rabbi Miles... Robert by then wasn\u2019t home, but my\ndaughter, Elizabeth was here. And we went out to the cemetery and we did a private funeral for\nhim with Rabbi Miles. Then at that time he didn\u2019t have a marker yet, but then several months\nlater, not several months, maybe a couple of months later, I got a call from them. By the way,\nthe girl who is in charge of that cemetery, has been working there for twenty-five years and she\nis Jewish. She knew Rabbi Miles very much. She was very, very nice and helpful. And we\nordered a marker and that\u2019s there. Now, in fact, when Robert was home at Fourth of July\nweekend, we went out there, and he looked at it. And I\u2019m sure... my daughter is coming\ntomorrow for just ten days and we will go out and I took a picture of that marker. It says,\nAndrew Allen Klein, above it \u201cAndy\u201d and the date that he was born and the day that he died and\nthere is a little menorah.\n35",
        "Q: That makes me think of a question which may seem a little odd. But you don\u2019t have a grave to\nvisit for your parents or for most of the members of your family. Does that make it important to\nyou to have that?",
        "A: That\u2019s why I wanted Andy to be here.",
        "Q: And what about for yourself?",
        "A: Oh, well, if you\u2019re really interested in that, Sandy used to be the type of guy who would say, I\nwant my ashes in the parks and in the river. When this happened, we never talked to Andy about\nwhat he wants. We never thought that he\u2019s going to die before. The girl, I forgot her name now,\nat the cemetery says... she wasn\u2019t pressuring anybody, but she says, \u201cMany times people don\u2019t\nthink about it now, but later on suddenly they think they would like to be maybe near a dear one\nfrom the family. And then there is no place for it.\u201d\u201d, And she just thought she\u2019d mention. I kept\non thinking and thinking. And Sandy\u2019s sister was here at the time from Hungary. And I said to\nher, \u201cYou know I really would...\u201d I thought about it a lot. When we die, Linda and will the\nfamily just throw our ashes... I thought about this, but I never made a big deal about it. So I said\nto Sandy one day, \u201cYou know, I wouldn\u2019t mind to get two lots next to Andy\u2019s.\u201d And he didn\u2019t\nobject to it and we did that. So we have him and then two empty lots, which we paid for. And\nwe, of course, would like to be cremated. I mean a long time ago, I decided. So now I feel good,\nthat at least I know what our kids need to do with us.",
        "Q: Do you think that is a special comfort to you because...?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: ...your parents, you don\u2019t have places.",
        "A: And I thought, see, we went out on Andy\u2019s birthday for example. I mean I\u2019m not the type, who\nwould going out every week. But it gives me a comfort to know that he is here and he\u2019s close to\nus. And now that we decided to do this, and in fact Robert was kind of, almost funny... \u201cLet\u2019s\nall get a place.\u201d And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d but we do, and if they do that... I mean Sandy will\nbe eighty years old next year. Eventually we will die. I mean, we\u2019re in fairly good health. At\nleast it makes me feel good, first of all that we belong to a Temple, secondly that if our kids want\nto visit our graves, since we cannot. I don\u2019t know where my brothers are. I don\u2019t know where\nhis parents are. It does make me, give me a comfort. And I\u2019m not sure why, but it does. And\nI\u2019m glad that he agreed on this, because I thought he\u2019s going to give me a hard time. And then\nthe kids, what are they going to do with us? Throw our ashes all over the place? And I don\u2019t\nknow where my brothers are. I don\u2019t, I mean I know where my parents are, but we can\u2019t visit\nthem ever, and so, anyway.",
        "Q: Did you ever, have you ever visited Auschwitz?",
        "A: No. I never visited Auschwitz, but I did visit Dachau, one time when we were in Germany. He\nwanted to go and I went with him. We took the train. There were a bunch of people on the train,\nyoung students. And it did come up that I was there. And they asked me questions, but it\n36\nsomehow, again... I didn\u2019t cry there. It just was so manicured and it looked so different. And\nwe were in Austria, last summer, with an elder hostel group and there were hardly any Jews in\nthat group. But they had planned to go to Mauthausen. And we did that. And I saw there the\ngas chambers. Well of... it\u2019s hard for me to explain it. It\u2019s almost like that\u2019s not me. You\nknow, it\u2019s almost like I couldn\u2019t have been there. I mean I know I was, but I just, that\u2019s the way,\nmaybe, it\u2019s easier for me to deal with it. I just can\u2019t imagine how anybody can go through it and\nthen be here to talk about it. And I\u2019m not the only one, a lot of people who... and it was, you\nknow, the barracks, I peeked into some of the barracks. But, you know, I mean, it was so much\nworse than when I was there. I mean when I was there it was so horrible, that any of this thing\nnow, which is a museum, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s hard to imagine that people really were there. But that\nwas at the Dachau camp, where I went in. Some people, German people were sitting next to the\nentrance, in their houses with flowers and all. And I would walk by them and they looked maybe\nold. And I used to think at that time, I wonder what they knew. How much they knew? Did\nthey know what\u2019s going on in that camp? Stuff like that goes through my mind all the time, even\nnow. And Sandy gets very... if he runs into somebody who\u2019s old and maybe it would be a\nGerman, then he would never trust them. He would think he might have been a Nazi or\nwhatever, you know. So, you never can get that out of your system. But slowly we are getting\nolder and not that many people... and that\u2019s why I talk to many schools about this. And that\u2019s\nwhy I\u2019m doing this, too. That I think there ought to be a way of people to know what happened\nreally, after we die. Because there are not that many people left who survived it, slowly. I\u2019m\nseventy-seven years old and young people were killed. I\u2019m not saying in Theresienstadt or some\nof those places, because families were together. And a young person might live to be 90, and\nstill... but in Auschwitz there were no kids, not one.",
        "Q: Did you ever have the desire to visit Auschwitz?",
        "A: No. I... we went to see Schindler\u2019s List and I saw it a couple times. And then from the Temple,\npeople went. And somebody interviewed us, but there were some young people in the group and\none girl said that she visited... I think her grandparents might have been survivors. And she\nwent to visit some concentration camps and she was in Auschwitz. And I said, \u201cWhat did it look\nlike?\u201d And she says, \u201cIt has a souvenir shop, you can buy all these things.\u201d No, I really don\u2019t\nhave the desire to go. I see it on movies or on film. And it must look so different, you know? I\nremember the railroad tracks as we arrived. I remember that incident where Mengele was\nturning you, sending you to the right or the left. I remember the barracks at the time, but now\nit\u2019s probably, looks completely different.",
        "Q: So when you want to, when you\u2019re remembering your parents and you want to visit them, and\nyou don\u2019t have that. What do you...is there a place that you go? Or is there something that you\ndo?",
        "A: I can\u2019t accept... around the time, you know, when they took us away. No, well there is no place,\nyou know, really that I could. That\u2019s the reason that I didn\u2019t want that to happen to my children.\nThat they wouldn\u2019t have a place to go. I think about them. See, we were taken away June\ntwelfth or so, and I think about it a lot, but I do not talk about it. You know, many, many times.\nIt\u2019s just like with after Andy died. They did that beautiful music, and I have a tape of it, see,\nbecause we put it on tape. And I go down to my basement and I turn on that cassette when\n37\nnobody is there. And I re-hear it, and you know, then if I want to shed tears or cry over it, I do.\nBut I don\u2019t... I\u2019m never the type who does that very much in public.",
        "Q: Did there come...",
        "A: Maybe that\u2019s good, maybe it\u2019s bad. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Did there come a point when you felt that you had to talk about your experiences, your\nmemories?",
        "A: Well it came after, many years later. The very first time, I think I talked about it, that we were\ngoing to Cincinnati, to an art gallery, and Mary K. was with me and another friend. It was a two\nhour ride and somehow it came up and then I told them. When I used to walk with neighbors\nand friends and they have known me forever. So, years and years ago, we would walk for maybe\n45 minutes and one of my friends, not Jewish, asked me if I would talk about it. So, I said, \u201cPll\nbe glad to,\u201d and for many, many weeks that we would walk, we stopped at a certain point and\nthen they wanted to know the rest of it. So, by now it doesn\u2019t give me any problems to talk\nabout it. When some of the schools ask me, I did. I couldn\u2019t begin to tell you now how many\ntimes I did speak in schools. Once at the Catherine Spalding College, once at St. Andrews\nChurch and mainly then on Jewish situations, of course. And they might have a Jewish student\nthere or not. And now, I\u2019m completely at ease with myself and I can talk about it. Once ina\nwhile I kind of get a lump in my throat, you know, but I can do it.",
        "Q: Did you...",
        "A: And I\u2019m glad that I can, because Sandy\u2019s sister, the one who is coming from Argentina now, she\ncompletely held it back all the time. So much that if the subject comes up, she just completely\nbursts out crying. She couldn\u2019t talk to her kids about it... they know... or to her grandchildren\nabout it. And her granddaughter said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you make a tape of it,\u201d because she was with\nme one year. Sylvia, she\u2019s now about twenty some years old. She told her grandmother, \u201cWhy\ndon\u2019t you make a tape of it? Maybe it would be easier for you.\u201d And everybody tells this to\neverybody, but it\u2019s not easy to do. I would have never just done it, if Mary K. wouldn\u2019t have\ninsisted.",
        "Q: Was it important to you, personally to do it?",
        "A: I, I, it\u2019s nice. Like, for example, I have a neighbor two houses down, who is from Vienna and\nwho left Vienna, they took all of her things away. And she ended up in Shanghai. I said, \u201cWhy\ndon\u2019t you tell your story?\u201d She can not. And all alone, unless somebody asks you, it\u2019s very hard\nto do that. But I\u2019m glad. I am glad that I did it. And I\u2019m glad that there is a record of it, maybe\nfor the future generation. I mean, I don\u2019t care whether I would have it or not, but... so, I think\nit\u2019s... and that\u2019s why they make such a big deal about that now. Of course, a lot of people go\nback with transports to Auschwitz, and so I don\u2019t have any desire to do that.",
        "Q: How do you, how do you feel about living in Louisville?\n38",
        "A: I like Louisville. I do like it and I don\u2019t. Wouldn\u2019t like to live any other place. I\u2019ve not been in\ntoo many places in the United States, but Louisville 1s a nice town. And we made a lot of\nfriends. Now that we\u2019re getting older we don\u2019t see them as much anymore. And luckily one\ndaughter lives here and the two grandchildren, you know. I have in fact, a little one will have a\nbirthday tomorrow. He\u2019ll be seven years old. And I\u2019m invited to go to a cave for the birthday\nparty. But I like it here. I mean I am satisfied and I wouldn\u2019t want to live any other place\nanymore...\nEnd of Tape 3, Side A\n39\nTape 3, Side B",
        "A: ...Democrats, okay? Now if when we were younger and we would get together and like let\u2019s see,\nduring some of the presidential elections, we would all get together and everybody was for that\nsame person. We used to think everybody, like long, long time ago, Stevenson was running and\nwe all liked him. Then he didn\u2019t make it and we were so surprised. So we don\u2019t have any, non-\nliberal friends, but you run into a lot of people like that. And that doesn\u2019t mean that we are not\nfriendly with them. But as we get older we don\u2019t really... I used to have parties and now when\nmy kids come home, we get together. Pll be pretty busy, so I\u2019m glad you came today. Cause\nfrom tomorrow on, I'll be kind of busy with my daughter and her 13-year-old is coming from\nSeattle. And they usually... my kids here come over. And I was just now in Nashville with\nRobert, so... excuse me, So...",
        "Q: You keep pretty busy.",
        "A: Yeah, I keep busy, and I...",
        "Q: When you first moved to Louisville, how did you integrate into the community here? How did\nyou make friends? And was it with the Jewish community only?",
        "A: Well for a while, no, not really. We lived in the South end and we didn\u2019t, some people through\nhis work would come and look us up and so on. When we moved to this house, then we met\nmore and more people and they would invite us. But we\u2019re not the type that we congregate only\nthat they have to be Jewish. As I said, that thought, if anybody would be an anti-Semitic person,\nI would never want to have anything to do with them. But that\u2019s not the kind of friends we ever\nwould have. And after, you know, I got used to the idea and everybody knows we are Jewish, I\nmean it\u2019s not a problem anymore. And our kids, too, they have mixture of non-Jewish friends\nand Jewish friends. Now, my son, Robert, in Nashville, he married a Catholic girl. Now, he is\nthe least. He\u2019s the one who came with me to Los Angeles. And he said that he learned more\nabout Andy during that three hour memorial service than he ever knew, because he was just a\nlittle boy. And then he got away, Andy got away, you know, went to college and then he moved\nto Cal... so, I was very, very glad that he could come with me, that he wanted to come with me.\nAnd it made a very big impression on him. We got through music or through the universities or\nthrough work, that we made friends, you know, but it.... and some of them are Jewish, some of\nthem are not Jewish. So it\u2019s... we have some very, very good friends, who we still get together\nsometimes, have dinner out. He\u2019s almost ninety years old. And on their second marriage and\nthey\u2019re Jewish. So, it\u2019s not a matter that it has to be Jewish or not, but it has to be the same type\nof people.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to say something about... I have a question that I have to explain a little bit first. I\nthink and my assumption would be that most people living in Kentucky don\u2019t really realize that\nthere\u2019s a group of Holocaust survivors who live in this state. And most of the Holocaust\nsurvivors who live in the state, live in Louisville. And I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve had a chance or\nan opportunity to travel outside of Louisville or to talk to people who have been kind of\nsurprised, who know that you\u2019re a survivor... like for example, if you speak to school groups,\nhave you had experiences where you\u2019ve found people, where you\u2019ve spoken to people outside of\n40\nthe Louisville area, who maybe wouldn\u2019t have expected that even a Holocaust survivor lives in\nthe state?",
        "A: Well, there\u2019s some schools that I\u2019ve been speaking to, the teachers have been very, they\u2019re\nmostly non-Jewish people. A lot of them maybe half black, you know. And they prepare the\nkids, most of them. They had Holocaust pictures on the wall. They were studying it before they\nasked me. So they were somewhat, and then they would ask a lot of questions. And I did it once\nat Highland Junior High School. There were 150 kids in the group and all 150 wrote me a thank\nyou note about it. And I have all that. I have a box this full of all that kind of thing. They, one\nblack kid, for example, said, \u201cCan I touch you?\u201d I said, \u201cYes you can.\u201d And he said, \u201cAt least if\nsomebody would say sometimes that the Holocaust did not exist, because we talked about that, at\nleast I can say yes it did. Because I touched somebody who was part of it.\u201d So, it made me feel\ngood that they were thinking about that. And they hear once in a while stories where people\ndon\u2019t want to believe. And that\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m doing it, because it would very much\nbother me. And then, you know, I was very affected by this Yugoslavia problems, too, with this\nKosovo deal. Because it was so similar to what we have gone through. And there were... there\nagain, and I don\u2019t know how you feel about it, some people who hate our president and hate the\nDemocrats, would be very much against that he started this bombing and he started invading and\ngoing in. I had very mixed feelings toward the end, when the bombs kept on falling and maybe\ninnocent people were killed. That bothered me, but at the same time, I thought to myself, if\nanybody would have tried to do and stopped at least part of it. They would have bombed, let\u2019s\nsee, the railroad tracks, when the train was going to Auschwitz. Not necessarily mine, but\nhundreds and hundreds of them. It could have maybe stopped something. And nobody did\nanything. And therefore, because I feel that way so strongly, I was saying that they did the right\nthing. Although it\u2019s a very complicated situation and it\u2019s never going to be peace in that part of\nthe world. And even my friend, Ilus, we talked on the phone once and she was upset\u2014now that\nsurprised me\u2014over the bombing. And she was not, she didn\u2019t feel like I do.",
        "Q: The bombing of Kosovo?",
        "A: Kosovo. And she said, because she was from that part of the country, and she said something\nthat, those problems go back to eighteen whatever and there will be never peace. And Albanians\nand so on and so forth... that this is not going to help and the bombing just causes more, you\nknow, destruction and so on and so forth. And I was surprised by her saying that, because\nmaybe there will be never peace, but at least it showed something to the world. That\u2019s the way I\nfeel. That something like that has to be stopped. Whether they completely can stop it, you\nknow, one doesn\u2019t know. But I... it bothered me, the bombing. It bothered me, but then every\ntime I watched the news where people were happy that they were being helped, it made me feel\ngood. Because just some food given to them or the shelter or the whatever, what would we have\ngiven if somebody would have rescued us during the year. And what would those other people\nhave done, who were there for three years, if that could have been stopped? That\u2019s the way I\nfeel, whether that satisfies you or not.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah?\n4]",
        "Q: I also wanted to ask you, after you arrived here in the United States, did you want to have\nchildren? Was that a goal of yours? Or did you have any other goals?",
        "A: My husband (laughing) wrote me the long letter, when he invited me to come. And since he\nloves music so much, he even said that he would like to have six children. Like he wanted like a\nquintet or whatever. And after four, I think, we decided that\u2019s plenty. But yes, I was, you know,\nkind of, not in a depressed mood, that I went always, you know I had certain kind of a fate, will\nbe the way it is. Like I believe more in fate. Like in Auschwitz, I never tried to, this would\nbetter or that would be better. Whatever has to happen, would happen to me. Yes, children we\nwanted to, but I\u2019m not going to tell you that we exactly had it when we planned it. Because then\nit would have taken a long time for us. Because he didn\u2019t have much money. I didn\u2019t. When do\nyou feel now you are ready to have children? That you really can afford it? So, I\u2019m glad just\nexactly the way it happened.",
        "Q: It seems to me that you\u2019ve been overall just very accepting in your life of the circumstances...",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: ...and not had a tendency to try to make something...",
        "A: No, no, no, no. I really am and I think that\u2019s what helped me through, if that\u2019s a possibility, plus\nluck. I mean you can feel this way and get sick or they can shoot you and then you can have a\nhard attitude, but if that didn\u2019t happen to you, then maybe that\u2019s the reason. And why I was like\nthat, I don\u2019t know. But from whatever I told you, maybe that\u2019s the conclusion you come to.",
        "Q: Do you have anything else that you would like to say?",
        "A: No, except you poor soul, you\u2019re probably starving.",
        "Q: I\u2019m okay, I had breakfast. (Laughter.)",
        "A: But that\u2019s just what happened. I can give you some cheese. I can give you a sandwich before\nyou leave. And I'll be happy to.",

        "Q: Do you know what brought your parents both to Eger?",
        "Q: Okay. Going on with the summary of your experiences. So, you did talk some about your\nbrothers and then after the German occupation in March of 1944, you were moved into a ghetto.\nLived there for three weeks and then you were taken to a brick factory, called Kerecsend. And\nthere for a few days, then from there, loaded onto cattle cars and taken to Auschwitz, where you\nwere separated from your parents. You worked in the kitchen in Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Not right away?",
        "Q: In January of 1945, you were forced to leave Auschwitz to go on a Death March towards\nRavensbriick. And you were at that point, with a group of four other girls, who you had kind of\nbecome close with, right?",

I believe when we left off, we mentioned that you were on a Death March. You were\nforced to go to Ravensbruck with this group of other girls and then we went off talking about\nwhat had become of them. So, you were in Ravensbriick for about three weeks.",

        "Q: Just on the subject of your strength and being strong enough to survive that and also having the\nluck to survive it. I was wondering about your, how you thought of yourself and how you\nremember yourself before the war.

        "A: It\u2019s Klein.",
        "A: You said, Ms. Low.\nAnd the second interview was a Survivors of the Shoah Foundation interview that was conducted\non April 22\u2122, 1996. So, we\u2019re going to start out by summarizing, more or less, what was said in\n1\nthose interviews, which were very thorough, particularly the Mary K. Tachau interview. And\nfilling in on a few questions and then we\u2019ll go on and mostly focus on Ms. Klein\u2019s life in\nKentucky. So, I\u2019m going to just read this summary and you tell me if I\u2019ve gotten anything\nwrong. Actually, first of all before we start, you were born in October ninth, 1921 in Eger,\nHungary. I was interested in hearing before we go on from there, something about your family\nhistory. Do you know anything about your family history?",
        "A: Yes, as much as I know. People in those days didn\u2019t go into a lot of details. But my father was\nborn in 1880 and my mother was born in 1879.",
        "A: Yes. My mother\u2019s maiden name was Frida Weisz and my father\u2019s name was B\u00e9la Low. In\nHungarian we would say Low B\u00e9la and Weisz Frida, you know the last name comes first. My\nfather worked in a bank that was a chain. The main office was in Budapest. And then different\ncities would had branches. It was called at the time, and I don\u2019t know whether you want to know\nit in Hungarian. It was called the Magyar Atolanos Hitel Bank. Magyar means... and the Hitel\nBank was the name of the outfit. My father became, first he probably was a clerk and I would\nnot remember that. And actually married my mother, who was working in that bank before.\nThat\u2019s how they apparently met. This was a second marriage for my father, because his wife, the\nfirst wife, died maybe after two years of marriage, and then he married my mom. And she was\nborn in Fegyvernek, Hungary and my father was born in a little town called Tiszafured, Hungary.\nNow, my father became the manager of the bank and so those are the years I would remember.\nIn Hungarian, they were called the izgazgato (ph) of the bank, but here you would call the\nmanager, I think, or the director of that bank. And he did work there for a while. We lived in a\nhouse, a little bit away from downtown. And when I was four years old we moved into the same\nbuilding where the bank was, above the bank there was a nice big apartment. And we were very\ncomfortable in my house. I remember we had pretty gardens and so on and so forth, up to the\nage of four. And after that we lived downtown. So all I remember that toward the end, I think\nmy father was supposedly had to retire, already maybe at age sixty, where people here maybe\nretire only in sixty-five. They had a lovely and very nice ceremony for him. In fact, I owned\u2014\nbut unfortunately I don\u2019t own anymore\u2014they gave him a silver wreath, which the employees, all\nthe employees\u2019 names were signed on. And they gave a lovely, nice speech at his retirement. I\ndo have a picture of that, by the way. You know, I was really lucky that either relatives or\nmaybe it was left in the house. I have more pictures than many other people who lost everything.\nWe lost everything, but still for example, and if you would be interested toward the end, I would\nshow you that picture. He\u2019s sitting at the desk and that was the time he retired from the bank.\nAnd my mother, after... she had three children, so she didn\u2019t work, so that was before they got\nmarried, I think, that she was like a secretary, maybe, in the bank. So, that\u2019s what my parents...\nexcept then he had a very good friend, who lived in Budapest. He wasn\u2019t a Jewish guy, who had\nvineyards in our hometown. Because our hometown, Eger is very famous of its wine and\nvineyards. And as a friendship, that wasn\u2019t really a paid job, he helped that friend to take care of\nthe vineyard. I mean, not so much take care, because he had employees, but look after it a little\nbit. And they had an apple orchard and he was doing that. So, we went out to that vineyard\nmany times. And it was a pleasant way that I remember my childhood. You don\u2019t want to know\nmuch about my childhood, no more like about my parents.\n2",
        "A: See, I don\u2019t remember what I did. So, that\u2019s about really about my father. And then in one of\nthe interviews, I did tell them that when the Germans came in, he was the head of that five\nmember committee. So, I don\u2019t want to repeat myself.",
        "A: So, this is about all I can tell about my parents. And I might have talked about my brothers, but\nthis is the answer that what my father did, and so on.",
        "A: I have pictures of them, but very little. I really don\u2019t...I have a picture of my grandfather and\ngrandmother on my father\u2019s side and no pictures on my mother\u2019s side. I know absolutely\nnothing of the family history on my mother\u2019s side, except that she had two sisters and we were\nclose to the sisters. But not previously what happened to the father or mother or when they died.\nNothing. My father\u2019s mother died when I was five years old and I do remember that, because,\nyou know, in Jewish funerals, you know, there was a black casket, and we were... but when my\ngrandfather died, I do not remember that. I think he died, might have died before I ever was\nborn.",
        "A: No, sorry.",
        "A: Not right away.",
        "A: First I was in Birkenau for a month. And then from Birkenau in a lager, which was called A\nLager. And two weeks after that I got in on the kitchen work. So that had to be, we were taken\nout in June, July, it had to be about toward the end of July.\n3",
        "A: Closer, but I really mainly, that close to one, who she worked with me in the kitchen, who I still\nkeep contact with, who lives now in Israel. She was from Yugoslavia, actually, from the town of\nIsad (ph), which nowadays is very much in the news. And she\u2019s really the one, who I kept close.\nIf you would ask me what were the other girls\u2019 names, I do not remember, and I do not know,\nand...",
        "A: Nothing. I never kept in touch with any of the others, except one other girl, who was from our\nhometown. And I don\u2019t even believe we worked in the kitchen together, but towards, during the\nDeath March, we ran into each other. She was older than I am. She used to be a seamstress.\nAnd in my stories, I think it\u2019s mentioned that on some of the train rides, after we were already\nliberated, we were together. And I do know what happened to her. And she lives, she remarried.\nShe had a husband earlier and then she remarried and they, to my surprise, they lived in Berlin.\nAnd he died in the meantime. I think he was an artist. And although I never thought I want to\ngo back to Germany, but at one point, with some friends from here, we did a two weeks tour in\nGermany, which took us to Berlin, too. And my, another friend who knew of her, gave me her\naddress and phone number. And I wrote to her and she came over to see, visit me in the hotel.\nThat\u2019s the first time I have seen her after Auschwitz times. And she still lives in Berlin. She\u2019s\nmuch older than I am, so at times I\u2019ve heard that she\u2019s kind of ill. So, I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s\ndoing. I have a feeling her husband was originally from Berlin and then, you know, I think they\nwere getting money after the Holocaust and they made their home there.",
        "A: Rosenfeld, B6zsi. B6zsi\u2019s like Elizabeth and Rosenfeld was her last name. That was actually\nher name from the first marriage. That\u2019s the way we always knew her and I do not know what\nher next husband\u2019s name was. So, we called her Rosenfeld, B6zsi and she was from Eger. So.\nAnd that\u2019s all. I never kept up with anybody else. I don\u2019t know what happened to them. But I\nagree with you that I did talk about five girls a lot together, but they were not from my\nhometown. And as I said in my stories, that my memory is not that good. Certain things are\nvery vivid in my mind and certain things like it never happened. So, I can\u2019t give you any names.",
        "A: She worked... yeah, I remember, she worked in the kitchen and we met. And she\u2019s exactly my\nage and somehow we liked each other. And then what has happened, that after that people were\nseparated a lot, transports were leaving, and my husband\u2019s two sisters were in Auschwitz, but\nthey were taken away to Germany. And they worked like, the so-called forced labor, now in\nfactories or whatever. But then we came so close and when people were separated from their so-\ncalled loved ones, of course our parents were gone, but we didn\u2019t know exactly what happened to\nthem. We somehow decided that we just never want to separate from each other. And we did\nbecome good friends to the last minute. And I told you that, maybe, or I might have said it in the\nvideo, that my husband thinks that maybe I survived because of her and she thinks maybe\nbecause of me. But she was a bright girl and lot more outgoing or spoke lot of languages and\n' Born Ilus Fleischman; later lived in Israel and changed her name to Ilana Fried.\n4\ntherefore she was very informed of lot of things what were happening after the January so-called\nDeath March. She met people more, and so, I got some information from her, which she\nremembered and I never remembered myself.",
        "A: Yes, and I do not remember the details of her background, although we used to talk about that, I\nassume. But I do not recall it. Well everybody lost their parents the same way, but I don\u2019t even\nremember if she was taken out with her parents together or not. So, I cannot give you any\ninformation about that. Then later she got married and they moved to Israel. And we kept up.\nIn fact, last year I was in Hungary and she came to Hungary, to Budapest and spent a week. So\nwe saw each other then. And unfortunately now, she lives in Netanya. Have you ever been in\nIsrael, yourself? And the last I heard of her, she was hit by a car. And she doesn\u2019t have any\nfamily anymore, because she never had any children. Her husband died years ago. She might\nhave a niece or some, so she was very, very down with the idea of that she had enough already\nduring concentration camp. And she was first in the hospital for a long time. Then she was in\nsome sort of a nursing home situation, because I think she had a broken hip and whatever. And\nin that age, she\u2019s very little and fragile. And then she is now back in her apartment. She doesn\u2019t\nlike to write, but she calls once in a while and I write. I write more than I call, because in a short\nconversation you cannot... but she\u2019s somewhat better, but pretty depressed by the whole\nsituation. Because she says it was very painful, and really nobody who can take care of her\nexcept nurses would come to the place. And so I felt very sorry about that, because I used to say\nthat and now she must have felt the same way, that one tragedy was enough, how many more do\nyou have to have? And for her, you know, that was an additional something that she certainly\nwasn\u2019t looking forward to. That\u2019s all.",
        "A: Well Ilus I met later, somewhat later, not even in the beginning of my kitchen work. Later,\nbecause I worked first in one part of the kitchen, then in another part. And I think we met a little\nbit later. But I don\u2019t know, you have talked to a lot of Holocaust survivors, and I don\u2019t know\nwhether I\u2019m just so naive or I was so naive at the time. Because you know, I even read right\nnow, just last week, I read a book, you probably read it, Night of Eli Wiesel. Have you read that\nbook?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s a very easy. And I read that just in Nashville, while, you know, I had a little time to\nread it. And you know, the stories I hear of people, you know, when they arrived and they would\nsee the smoke and they maybe right away would have known what that is. Or maybe if\nsomebody told them, they believed it. Well, I am either very naive... I could never have\nbelieved anything like that. We did see the smoke, and the people who were there already, the\nfirst two or three years, they of course knew exactly what was going on. They were from Poland\n5\nor Russia and they would tell us. But I assumed that they were kind of jealous that we were\ncoming just in the last minute of the war. See, they were already suffering for three years and\nsuffered quite a bit, you can imagine. And whoever survived that three years, they were pretty\ntough and kind of mean. Because a lot of the kapos in the barracks were Jewish refugees, I mean\nnot refugees, but prisoners from way back. And I used to think that they just want to scare us, or\nthey tell us stories which is so unbelievable. So, I never thought about that since my parents\ndisappeared that first day, that they would have been burned.",
        "A: Well, I hope so. It could be. And we didn\u2019t read about this that much, you know like I listened\nor read different kind of stories about people. Even, even this Eli Wiesel said that in Hungary\nthey did not know anything about Auschwitz. We did not know anything about Auschwitz. And\nI don\u2019t think my parents did. At the same time, my parents were very protective, too. They were\nthe type of people that they didn\u2019t want to scare you. Even if they would have known a little bit\nmore, they did not discuss that. And if we would listen to the Voice of America, which I said in\nmy interviews before about what\u2019s going on and we would hear Hitler screaming and yelling.\nThe concentration camps were not... we did not know anything about it. Like when we\u2019re in the\ntrain, I never knew where we are going, and I never was afraid that it\u2019s going to be Auschwitz,\nbecause I did not know anything about that. And I am talking only about myself. You can talk\nto somebody else maybe and they have an entire different... and you want to know my feelings.\nWe were going somewhere and it was miserable, but we didn\u2019t know where.",
        "A: I mean, later in... when we would have believed that they really... I can\u2019t remember when that\ncame to our mind, you know. For a long, long time we thought that, you know, our parents are\nsomewhere in another camp and taking care of the kids who were also taken away from people.\nWell, I was the youngest, and I didn\u2019t have, but as I told you in one of the stories, that my sister-\nin-laws had little children, a four and a six year old. Well, they wouldn\u2019t have imagined that\nthey were burned in the gas chambers. They would have thought that the mother was taking care\nof the kids in a different kind of a camp. When did we came to the realization? Toward the very\nend. I think maybe even during the Death March, and we heard this over and over and over\nagain, we assumed maybe. But it wasn\u2019t that it just happened one day. And I never remember\nreally, crying that suddenly now I might not have my parents anymore. It is just... everything\nwas so gradual that I couldn\u2019t recall anything like that. And I wanted to get back to Hungary.\nBy then, I kind of knew that I\u2019m not going to find my parents there, but I had big hopes that I\nwould find my brothers, because I didn\u2019t know what happened to them. Of course, I didn\u2019t find\nthem either, and I have mentioned that in some of my interviews. But when did that happen? I\ndon\u2019t really know. (Doorbell rings.) Oh gosh, would you turn that off for a minute?\n6",
        "A: Yeah, well I could even cry now, but see what it 1s, that what amazes me, that during that time\nthat we were in that camp and so many horrible things were going on, I don\u2019t remember really\never crying. You know? The shock was so great. And afterwards, see, when I got back to\nHungary, there was just, it was such a trauma, the whole thing, that you know, it was almost like\nyou were, like you were under the influence of some sort of magical thing that everything hit you\nall at once. And so, I don\u2019t, of course I, even now, and you know I have pictures, or when I\ncouldn\u2019t find my brothers. But it\u2019s funny, I wasn\u2019t... it\u2019s not funny at all, but I apparently didn\u2019t\ncry that easily. I mean I might have held it back more. And the tears come now, for example, I\nsee a program on television, not about the Holocaust, but about something, a little kid getting\nhurt or little... I can so easily cry and have tears, you know, over that, but with this big event\nwhat happened, that was just so much, that I... I didn\u2019t... like that we go to the cemetery when\nwe are in my hometown, because they have a memorial for the adults and then they have a\nspecial one for the kids. My family\u2019s names are on it. And it\u2019s just, you know, you\u2019re just\nunder, it\u2019s a shock kind of, which never left me for ever, ever and ever, you know? Then I had\nother traumas yet, which I might have talked about it or I might have not. But I don\u2019t want to\njump ahead of myself. You ask me the question.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I think that what made me survive, that I must be kind of tough. Or maybe I was\nbrought up in a nice family home and I didn\u2019t have any upsetting situations. But I think it has a\nlot to do, that some people are stronger for some reason and some people are not that strong.\nAnd I was able to handle many situations which for other people might have been very dramatic\nand I could do it. So, it must be my personality that I was able to... to survive, no. No?\nBecause you can get sick and you can die or they can kill you. But maybe the feeling that you\ndon\u2019t give up easily. Or it\u2019s like in my story, I might have said some that we had lice and we\nwould spend hours trying to get rid of the lice. Or if we were starving, you know, I was able\nto... then I was lucky that I didn\u2019t get really sick. I mean, that I don\u2019t think has anything to do\nwith one\u2019s personality. You may be stronger, and I\u2019m a pretty strong person. But in those days,\nyou know, being out in January and February, you could have gotten anything and just died, but I\ndidn\u2019t. And that I considered luck. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s a personality. Somebody who is\nstronger, maybe can endure all that. So I\u2019m not sure exactly what might have caused that, that I\nwas able to deal with it better than maybe the other people, who even now, maybe... I hate it that\nthey have nightmares about it and they remember all the horrible things. I think about it a lot and\nI remember them, but I deal with it, except sometimes it looks to me that, that wasn\u2019t me. That\nhad to be somebody else, because up to this moment, I can\u2019t believe and can\u2019t understand how in\nthe world somebody can survive it. And then talk about it later in life. It\u2019s... I have a hard time\nunderstanding that and I still feel that way.",
        "A: I was not that young, you know. I really not a 15-year-old kid. I was in my 23s or 24s. So, I\nwas mature enough to deal with it, but I worried about... see after the... and as of today, I\u2019m\ngoing to say something to you, I just thought about that. They died the way, you know how they\ndid. And at the same time I tried to compromise with it. I mean, I\u2019m not trying to forgive Hitler\n7\never, or what happened to us. But if I saw younger people with their mother doing the same\nthings I was doing and they would beat that mother or that mother was starving, you know? Just\nthe thought of that for me would have been horrible. So, the way I think now that they suddenly\nwere killed and they didn\u2019t suffer. That makes me feel almost better than if I would have gone\nwith them maybe for half a year and then slowly they would have died. Because they were in\ntheir sixties, they weren\u2019t young. Some people were only maybe in their forties. But when I was\nborn, my mother was already forty years old, so she had to be 63 some years old. And in those\ndays those were already old people, but they were healthy people. I never seen them sick or, you\nknow, in bed, in fact, with a sickness. So, to me, seeing them suffer right next to you would have\nbeen almost worse. I mean, I don\u2019t know if anybody ever felt that way. Because if they could\nhave survived the whole thing, that\u2019s a different story, but at that age, not many older people\ncould survive it. So.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side A\n8\nTape 1, Side B",
        "A: Ravensbrick for three weeks.",
        "A: Well, either walking or in open trains. The open train was right after the Auschwitz, the\nevacuation of Auschwitz, because I remember it was very cold and the trains were open. And I\nhave already told that story, so I don\u2019t want to really repeat myself. The camps, unless you\nreally would want to, I haven\u2019t looked at my notes again, many of the names I got from my\nfriend, Ilus. Because she remembered names very well. But Ravensbriick really was the most\nfamous one, but nobody... it wasn\u2019t really a camp for us anymore. It was gathering places. And\nwherever, like what you mentioned near Dresden, this Malchow, it wasn\u2019t that we were supposed\nto be working there or we were supposed to be doing anything there. It was just a stop during\nthe wandering around or the trains and so on and so forth. So, the last part of it, which I (coughs)\nexcuse me, I already mentioned before, on the open field, where I ran into a lot of the... even\nsome people from my hometown, by then there were no camps, it was just... but by then the\nweather was a little bit better, because it was springtime. So we wouldn\u2019t suffer from ice and\ncold and so on. But our main and worse situation was in ice and cold and snow, trying to stop\nand sit down and possibly freeze to death. Is where my friend, Ilus and I kept ourselves from\ntrying to avoid that if possible. Because we were told that, that can happen. But after that I\ncouldn\u2019t tell you any of the real camps because then we ended up in Wurzen and that was...",
        "A: It\u2019s still gone forever, yeah. And so those were the start, and I show that to you. This scar was\nmy tattoo number and this where my hands are very worked up, there is a little scar. And a little\nscar right here, where the pus had to be taken out, because I would have... okay that was another\nway you could have died. I had blood poisoning, but with that surgery, since by then we were\nliberated, and they did it. If the war would to have gone on further, longer, I don\u2019t know what\nwould have happened to that arm. But I never thought about it then either, except that was very\npainful. And that was taken care of in Wurzen. And after that, 1t took a while for that to heal, I\nassume. And I never did get my finger nails back, but that should be my biggest problem.\n9",
        "A: Well, because, yeah, well, we were, they wanted to help us and that was only this friend of mine\nand myself. And yes, I remember that very clearly. They gave us real good food, I mean really\nfood what we had never had before. Because, as I told you before, in Wurzen the first thing was\nI would eat the bag full of sugar and I would eat pickles. I mean that\u2019s alone a reason too, not to\nsurvive, I think, but then again, maybe I was strong or I don\u2019t get sick that easily. But after we\nheard about a transport, maybe from that area, leaving toward Hungary, we left them a note and\nwe told them \u201cThank you very much, but we\u2019re going to try,\u201d and we got on the train. And that\nwas a few more weeks of Czechoslovakia and all over the place. If I would look at my notes, I\nmight even get some ideas around Bern, for example, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that important and\nthat would really stretch it out. But the train was going slowly at different places. Now, my\nfriend, the reason she remembered more, first of all, she spoke languages better. She spoke\nFrench, she spoke German. She was from Yugoslavia. She spoke the Slavic languages, so in\nCzechoslovakia she could understand some of the Czecho... so, she found out a lot of little\nthings, exactly where we were. And I was immobilized because of that surgery on my arm. So\nmy arm was all tied up, so I didn\u2019t run around as easily as she did. Like, the train would stop and\nthen some people would bring up some food. That was, of course, after the war was over. Or\nshe would go down, they asked her down to a kitchen and they give her something to eat and\nthen she would bring some. But I just stayed put, because it was kind of hard for me to get\naround with that. And that was painful, because those things had to heal. But you know it\u2019s\nbecause that\u2019s the way I remember, and any other questions I\u2019Il be glad to help\nyou.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember that I was... I wasn\u2019t pampered really, by my parents, although they had\nthe means. But I remember... I don\u2019t think I was really spoiled. I was spoiled by them not to\nshare bad news. So, that\u2019s one thing I remember so well. Like my older brother was ill, had\nsome sort of a lung problem in his high school year. They took him to Budapest and the lungs\nhad to be filled at that time, you know that was more complicated. They never scared me with\nall that. Or I remember my younger brother, who was four years older than Iam. He once, he\nlived in another town, worked also in a bank. And he must have gotten sick with some sort of a\nso-called blood disease where the white cells were more than the red cells or so on and I didn\u2019t\nquite understand the whole thing. And my parents would talk to them on the phone and I think\nthey were worried about what was going on, but then he got well. But they never, ever shared\nthe worry with me, so therefore I was not exposed to anything bad, ever, up to that point. You\nknow? My parents lived together and my brother... we were... it was a close-knit family, but\nnot a spoiled. You know, like my father had probably enough money, but I made a big deal of\nasking for money. I remember I would say and that they laughed about that. That\u2019s not\nimportant to the interview, but I would say, \u201cI have a real, real, real big favor to ask, and a real\n10\nbig favor to ask.\u201d And they didn\u2019t know what it was I wanted, ten cents or 25 cents. I mean, I\nmade a big deal about it, you know? So up to the last moment that was the way I was brought\nup. My bad parts was my Catholic high school at the last year, which also was in my interview,\nbecause one of the nuns was very anti-Semitic and that hurt my feeling very much. But there\nagain, I didn\u2019t cry. I couldn\u2019t object to it. It wasn\u2019t like nowadays, people protest. So, I had to\nkind of swallow it and live with it. So, I don\u2019t remember ever being very upset or that I got hurt\neasily, you know, like some people get hurt over everything. I had friends and they liked me and\nI liked them and somehow that\u2019s the way I was brought up.",
        "A: No, I think my personality was kind of strong all my, but I didn\u2019t have to. It was easy to be\nstrong when I had all the comfort. It\u2019s different. From ghetto time on, it hit us. It\u2019s just like for\neverybody else. But you might have had interviews with some people, maybe they had a bad\nchildhood or maybe somebody was abusive. And who knows? I didn\u2019t have any of that. It hit\nme at the time when the Germans came in. And I read that other places, too, people didn\u2019t\nimagine it could happen to you. And we never imagined that it could happen to us, whatever\nwas happening, everything was gradual. You know, the giving up your whole place, the ghetto,\nthe brick factory. It just... it hit you and we had to face it and I did without any, you know, any\ncrying, temper or fighting it. The only upset points I would have, and would see again my\nparents sitting in front of our ghetto home, where it was raining and they had to leave their stuff.\nI always used to think that they had all the nice things and now you just have to leave it there.\nSo, I always felt more sorry for them than for myself at the time. That\u2019s the way I remember.",
        "A: Well I was in a way like, by the time I got back to Hungary, to Budapest and I realized that I\ndon\u2019t have... I really realized that my parents are gone and my brothers are gone. And I have\nmentioned in some of the interviews how I found about what happened to my brothers, so I don\u2019t\nwant to repeat myself to that. But everything was still completely like a dream type of a thing,\nbecause I remember that people wanted me to meet friends and get together with them. And I\nwas just like, like blindfolded. I did what I was told. I didn\u2019t have my own personality, you\nknow. I don\u2019t remember much about the time, you know. And I was in Budapest for a whole\nyear before I came out to this country. And some things are fairly vivid in my mind, some\npeople I don\u2019t even remember. I just really don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t know if I ever mentioned it,\nbefore the war they wanted me to marry somebody. Did I say that? I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s\nimportant, but there was a real good friend of ours, a family. He was a lawyer and they were rich\npeople. And their nephew got married to a girl in my hometown, who 1s still alive now\nsomewhere. I never see her anymore, but she lived in Israel. And that person who was marrying\nthe girl brought his cousin. And they lived somewhere in the Yugoslavian area and they were\nbig farmers or landlords, landholders and very rich people. And they all decided that that would\nbe a great situation for me.\n11",
        "A: That\u2019s... no, the couple, whose nephew was marrying the one girl and brought his cousin. And\nthey had a big dinner, a get together. And I don\u2019t know that should be in the Holocaust Museum,\nbut... briefly I would say it was a big dinner and I sat next to that guy and enough that he invited\nme to go to where he lives and meet his parents. And my mother and I took a train and we went\nwith this guy... can\u2019t even remember his name anymore. It was beautiful. They waited for us\nwith a sleigh. So, I liked, only thing is the sleigh rides in the snow. And at that time, of course, I\nknew my husband by then, because we were growing up together. We came to the United States\nand I liked him. And I certainly didn\u2019t like that guy. He was like about ten years older than I\nam. And so on the way back, on the train, I used my personality, where I might have cried, and\ntold my mother, \u201cI absolutely don\u2019t want anything to do with this situation.\u201d And they accepted\nit. They didn\u2019t force me to do that. But I think I was very upset and I might have cried then. On\nthe train home I kind of said, \u201c\u201cNo way do I want to do that.\u201d But then after the war, people\nwanted me to meet a friend and so on. And it\u2019s very vague in my mind. I can\u2019t remember. I\nlove music and somebody, my husband\u2019s wife, they got married just before the war. Not my\nhusband\u2019s, I\u2019m sorry, my brother. And she got me some opera tickets and I liked opera at the\ntime, it\u2019s a season ticket. And I went to all that because I was told to do but I didn\u2019t have my\nheart in it. You know? It was just something that I was so vague and my girlfriend, and I think I\nmight have said that. She was my good friend, who 1s still a friend of mine and I still see her all\nthe time. She sometimes comes to the United States and I have been visiting her.",
        "A: Her name is, her maiden name was Fleischman, Ibi. And the very interesting thing is that my\nfriend from Yugoslavia, her maiden name was Fleischman, too. Isn\u2019t that strange? And then she\nmarried, the woman in Budapest, married a furrier and his name was Fischer. And they had a\nfurrier business and when I arrived back to Budapest, I went down. And I remember one thing,\nthat I stood against a wall and of course, they never knew what happened to me. And I think it\nwas very vivid in my mind and I told my story to her. Then she hired me. She gave me a job,\nand I worked in that place. Oh, I don\u2019t know, just help out and they taught me how to make\npatterns for fur coats. You know there is a way to do that. And I worked in that furrier place\nuntil it was time for me to leave Budapest to come to this country. And I might have, you\nremember my tape? I must have told in it that I got a letter, letters from my sister-in-laws, where\nthey were happy that I\u2019m going to becoming a member of the family. And then I got a letter\nfrom my husband where he asked me to come out. But my Budapest time, that year and a half, I\nhad to go back to my hometown. I had to give up my apartment. I had to sell things which were\nso dear to my parents and cost, must have cost a lot of money. I practically had to just give it\naway. It was inflation time. And so, I got rid of all that. I got some money out of it, not very\nmuch, very little. And then I...",
        "A: ...with Mary K.",
        "A: Yeah, I must have.\n12",
        "A: Well, I\u2019ve known him from the time he was a little boy. He\u2019s a year older than I am and we\nlived just a block away. And at that time, he used to play the violin and I used to play the piano.\nAnd we belonged to the same music school. And we did by then, like I was teenager, maybe\nfourteen and he might have been 15 and a half. And we had some pieces that we played together\nand then there would be a recital, and we did... so those are the ways that we really... and then\nwe played tennis together and his sister was a friend of mine, who is... in fact, she\u2019s coming\nAugust the 5\"\". She now lives in Argentina. She was one of them who had a little child and lost\nthe child, and she\u2019s coming to visit. And then he fell in love with me more, when, you know,\nyou\u2019re 16 or 17. And before he left, and he would ask me, he said he\u2019s going to marry me. And\nof course, he was only eighteen and I was sixteen and a half and he left to the United States. So,\nall kind of things could have happened. But I remember we went to Budapest at one time\nbecause I had to... no, he had to go after his papers, because he had an uncle in Washington,\nD.C., who brought him out with a student visa. And then he went to school in Washington. And\nso, for a while, until 1941, he would write very frequently. And like, I think I might have\nmentioned that for my birthday, he would ask his mother and she would send a bouquet of a\nhundred red roses, which at that time... she paid for it. And I think it wasn\u2019t as expensive as it is\nnow. But then the war came in \u201841 and after that, I never heard from him. First of all, you\ncouldn\u2019t get letters. He was in the service, in the Army, Air Force, actually. So, that was about,\nbut we played ping pong together. I mean, Eger is a small town and the Jewish community\nwasn\u2019t really that big. And by then when I graduated from high school, we really didn\u2019t keep up\nwith our non-Jewish friends that much.",
        "A: Yeah, I did, but I was a little bit, I remember at one point, I mean, I don\u2019t know why that\nHolocaust Museum has to know about it, but I remember I was telling my friend, the one who\nstill lives in Budapest and who I\u2019m close to, he was very much after me. And then you know\nhow sometimes you get tired of it, you know. He wanted to be with me a lot and so on and so\nforth. And then my friend said, \u201cJust stay away, pretend that you\u2019re not interested,\u201d and then he\nwill change being after me like that. And he did just that. So, he stayed away and then I\nsuddenly thought to myself, well it\u2019s more than... you know, I really didn\u2019t want to stay away.\nSo, I felt the same way toward him, but see I was younger and I went to a Catholic high school,\nand we had friends after that. And I had a boyfriend later, whom I really liked very much, but\ndifferently than Sandy. Because he was the kind of guy I would have never wanted to marry.\nAnd he flirted with one girl and then with another and then with a third one. But he was that\ntype, you know, that it was more like being impressed by he was somewhat after me, but at the\nsame time I would know that he would be after a divorced woman and have two other girlfriends\nhere and there. So, he wasn\u2019t very stable. So I would have never, ever have considered...\n13",
        "A: That was after Sandy left. It had to be after 19... between 1939 and \u00b041, and then I guess, I\u2019m\nnot sure what happened to him. Then of course, he never survived either. But I would have\nnever... it wasn\u2019t a serious situation. I would have never considered...",
        "A: See, then, in concentration camp and I told you that, we only thought about food and never about\nboys. And after I got back, it wasn\u2019t very much after I arrived, see, that I got those letters from\nmy sister-in-laws. And the first time that he wrote to me, which I still have that letter, in which\nhe asked me and gave me the choice of, that he thought about that he wants his sisters come... I\nthink I mentioned that he went to Bergen-Belsen to get his sisters. And he took them to\nCasablanca, because he was stationed in Casablanca at that time. And then he wanted to have\nthe girls come to the United States, which didn\u2019t work out, because one went back to Hungary.\nThe other one stayed and married somebody there. But he kind of thought that I could come out\nand we all could live together. We would get married. If it works, fine. If it doesn\u2019t, we could\nalways separate. See that was ten years after and you know a lot of things happen during ten\nyears. So, when I got that letter, you know, I never had a second thought that that ought not to\nwork out.",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t afraid of it, but it helped me not to be afraid of it, that I didn\u2019t have to leave anybody\nbehind, and that\u2019s very important. If my parents would have been alive, I don\u2019t know whether I\ncould have that easily leave. Because at that time, you know, America was pretty far. And... or\nmy brothers, I didn\u2019t have anybody to leave. I mean I didn\u2019t have that feeling that, \u201cOh my God,\nwhat would be my choice?\u201d So, when I got that letter, I right away thought I\u2019d like to come.\nAnd not because I wanted to come out to the United States, but I knew him well and I felt like...\nyou know I never had a second thought that I ought not to do this. But I didn\u2019t have my parents\nanymore to leave. I didn\u2019t have my brothers to leave. I had maybe a friend or so, but I didn\u2019t\nmind leaving her. So, it was a test again that I was hoping that it will work out. I wasn\u2019t\nabsolutely sure about that, but I wanted to come.",
        "A: Well, Sandy has written to me while I was Paris for six weeks, practically every day, and gave\nme a lot of ideas of what\u2019s going on. And two things were interesting...",
        "A: Between Eger and Budapest, but I stayed in Budapest with an aunt and an uncle, who took me in.\nAnd to Eger I only went because I had to give up my apartment and I had to deal with that. I had\nan uncle, my father\u2019s brother, who moved into our apartment after... and he was the first who\ncame back. So a lot of stuff that I have left, that I found maybe pictures or something like that, it\ncould be that it got into his hands.\n14",
        "A: Well, the first thing, for example, was tremendously strange, but I do remember that we had help\nin our house, when I was growing up, and my mother tried to make me once in a while to, to help\na little bit. I think she wanted to train me to become eventually a good housewife. I think all\nmothers like to do that. And I remember that one day she was making me dust the furniture in\nthe bedroom, although all my friends were downstairs already, down on the main street walking.\nAnd I kept on looking out and I was just upset that I couldn\u2019t be there. I could have done dusting\nthe furniture in two seconds, but instead of that, I was fooling around and I wished I would be\ndown with my friends. So anyway, I was procrastinating that kind of stuff apparently, like many\nother kids, I didn\u2019t want to maybe do what my chore would have been. After I came back and I\nhad that big apartment, and I remember I worked like a dog. You know, we had hardwood\nfloors. And at that time, you know, you didn\u2019t have the kind of waxers and the facilities and the\nvacuum cleaners like they have them now. I remember I had a brush I put on the one foot and I\nwaxed the floor. And under your other foot, you have a rag. I mean, you never saw anything\nlike that, but...",
        "A: Well, yes, different people lived in it and then they moved out and when I came back, my uncle\nwas there. But I tried to get the house back in the shape like I remembered that it was before.\nAnd all I could, always, and I think I cried at that time, if my mother just would see now, how\nI\u2019m trying to take care of the house, when earlier I wouldn\u2019t even want to dust the furniture. So,\nI was very proud of myself. And you know, I mean, I don\u2019t remember the crying spells, but I\nwould get very emotional, even now that I\u2019m talking about it. If she just could have seen now\nwhat I\u2019m doing, when I really didn\u2019t have to, but I did it for myself or maybe to just the way the\nplace looked like before. I wanted to put it back into that same shape.",
        "A: I do, I even could cry, see, right now. But when you\u2019re in the middle of it, you know, I think I\njust took it the way I had to. But yes, of course, I mean I do think about them a lot.",
        "A: That house wasn\u2019t owned by us. Our first house what we lived in, which was very pretty and\nvery big, with a big garden, that was sold. This apartment, I think, belonged to, as I said, it was\nabove the bank. And I think that was rented. So, I didn\u2019t sell anything there. I had to sell\nfurnitures. And I had to get rid of all that, but the apartment didn\u2019t belong to us. And I wrote, I\ngave, I talked to Mary K. about that, I think.\nwere leaving, heading toward the United States, you spent six weeks in Paris first, and that was\nin 1947. Right?",
        "A: 1946. I left in November and arrived to the States in 1947, January. So, I left in November and\nby the time I arrived here, I mean to New York, it was January the 20\". That was very hard six\nweeks for me, because I was alone. It was cold.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side B\n16\nTape 2, Side A",
        "A: Yeah, so I don\u2019t want to repeat that. That was just for one night.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The 29\",",
        "A: Well, I have also managed... I must have told in the interview that he had an uncle in\nWashington, so I stayed with them. And that was very hard for me too, as I mentioned, because\nI couldn\u2019t speak the language. And they were friendly and nice with me, but when you can\u2019t\ncommunicate... I mean, everything 1s so strange when you are at a new place. But what I must\nsay now, and I don\u2019t know if I ever said it. That I still, at this moment, I have this kind of a\nfeeling that I compare things to the 1944 situation. And I always used to think that\u2019s very hard,\nbut how much better it is than it was then. So, everything in all my life, since then, I compare it\nto, lots of times. That if I was able to take that, my God, I should be able to take this. It wasn\u2019t\nthat easy, but he, after school he would come over and then we would go out. Then we would\ntry, 1t wasn\u2019t that easy, because ten years went by, but we knew we were getting married, and it\nwas... you had to adjust to that, too. Plus I don\u2019t think I talked too much about my experiences\nthen. And he loved music and we talked about music, so on, and then we had a very small\nwedding and I must have told that to Mary K. And so, it was just something that I could adjust\nto things, easier I think than maybe many other people. And if something 1s a hardship or like,\nyou could say, \u201cMy God you haven\u2019t been with him for a long time, that must have been hard.\u201d\nMust have been hard to be in a home, a nice home in Washington, D.C. with an American\nwoman and a Hungarian man, but who has been in this country since age 14, children who\nwanted to be nice to me, but it\u2019s hard. And it was hard, but I adjusted to that too. And I mean I\ndidn\u2019t suffer, because I thought this is for, toward the better. And I always compared things like\nthat, even as of today, I put things on a scale in my mind, and how would it be better, you know?\nAnd so I adjust to things easier, I think. See I don\u2019t know whether I told Mary K. about my\nBloomington experiences or did we talk about that?\n17",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, so I don\u2019t want to repeat it again, but to me that\u2019s a hardship. I mean not... I hada\nnice home at home, we always had running water in bathrooms. In Auschwitz, we didn\u2019t have\nanything. In the Bloomington campus, living in a trailer, in a tiny, little place, where I had to\nbring the water in at night and go to the john and take a shower. And not many people who were\nbrought up in this country with all the comfort would accept that.",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m sure I did, but I don\u2019t recall it exactly when. I\u2019m sure. And, you know, but I don\u2019t think\nthat I talked about it all the trme. And as I mentioned, I didn\u2019t talk to other people for a long\ntime about it, till the opportunity arose that I would, maybe this subject matter would come up.\nBut that was years and years after. But I don\u2019t think this was my topic of conversation that I\nwould talk about that all the time. I probably thought about it a lot, but I didn\u2019t. And when my\nkids were growing up, I didn\u2019t want to, I didn\u2019t want to, I didn\u2019t want to make a big emphasis on\nthat I\u2019m Jewish. They knew it. I mean, we are Jewish. But because you are Jewish, something\nlike this could happen. I didn\u2019t want them to grow up like that. My older daughter was, later on\nin life, objecting to it that I was holding many things back. I did not want them to feel that they\nwould be persecuted just because they are Jewish. They knew I was Jewish and Sandy was, but I\ndidn\u2019t make a big deal about it. So, I was holding back. I didn\u2019t tell them stories about it till\nthey got much, much older. Now they all have the tape and they know about it. But I didn\u2019t feel\nthat, that should be important. I didn\u2019t want to make them worried and unhappy as time would\ngo on.",
        "A: I did, except in my interview I might have told you that I got a job. Did I say that in\nWashington, D.C. to do alteration at Garfinkel Department Store. And you had to fill out the\napplication and they asked what religion you are. And I think I wrote down, or I might put a\ndash, but I was very worried about that. You know, I thought to myself this country is a safe\ncountry and it\u2019s a free country and why do they want to know? What could be the result of it?\nSo, for a very long time, for years, and I told that in one of the interviews, I worked in that place\nand I was afraid that they were going to ask me what church I go to. I wouldn\u2019t have lied to\nthem.",
        "A: But it concerned me that this should be a topic of conversation and what could be the result if\nthey find out that I\u2019m Jewish. And that worried me for a long, long time. I thought that in this\ncountry, everything is free. And I also told you that when I... in my interview, I\u2019m sure, that\nwhen I arrived to New York and we were waiting for a cab to go to the railroad station and my\nlittle suitcase was stolen. Did I say that?\n18",
        "A: Okay, well my uncle in Budapest gave me a lovely, nice black patent leather, little overnight\ncase with red leather lining. And anything what I had valuable which people gave me, maybe\njewelry and I can\u2019t remember, as presents or Sandy\u2019s sister has given me certain things from her\nmom, was in that. And I held onto it in Paris. I took care of all my belongings. And when we\narrived in New York and a second uncle of Sandy and his son, waited for me and came with us\nto the railroad station. And by then I felt I don\u2019t have to watch that much anymore. I think I just\ndidn\u2019t take care of my things as much. And when they were putting the things into the cab... I\ndidn\u2019t have that much belonging, but that little black suitcase was missing. So somebody as we\nwere talking right next to the, on the railroad station waiting for a cab to come, must have picked\nit up and they stole it. And that disappointed me tremendously, because I thought this country 1s\nvery safe. Things like that, it would not happen. Because Sandy always used to write to me that\nthey put a 25 cents down near the newspaper and nobody takes that 25 cents and you can just get\nyour paper. So, I thought no crime is happening in this country. And that was one of my\ndisappointments. The other one was the Ellis Island and I had to be there. And he also wrote to\nme that the uncle had a black, they had a black maid. And he said to me that, you know, you\ngotta be, if you are going to meet her... because I\u2019ve never seen black people. And he just kind\nof tried to make me realize that, well, we were very liberal, in all this, in our upbringing, and\nSandy was too, that you got to be very nice and not make difference between a black and a\nwhite. And then when I met her, of course, she was very nice, but that was the first time I ever\nseen a black person, but I was already warned by Sandy that you got to be very nice. They\u2019re\njust like whites and they can\u2019t help that they\u2019re persecuted and stuff like that. So, I was prepared\nfor all that. And I tell you, in this country, in Louisville, Kentucky, I was terribly disappointed at\none time. I met a young couple, Jewish couple, who invited us to their house. And I don\u2019t know\nwhere they are now and they seemed like they were prejudiced against blacks from their talk.\nAnd I couldn\u2019t believe it. I could not understand it as of today, and I know there are very many\nJewish people who are prejudiced towards blacks. Now, I know. I couldn\u2019t believe that\nanybody who 1s persecuted themselves, how can they be prejudiced towards somebody else.\nAnd that was another disappointment in my life that I couldn\u2019t understand that.",
        "A: That was already in Louisville, so that was several years after. At the Bloomington campus there\nwere black people. And... but when somebody would make a remark like that, it was some sort\nof prejudice remark and I was very surprised. I didn\u2019t know that Jews could be prejudiced, but I\nknow they are. I mean they could be, but it surprised me very much. When you said, \u201cHow did\nyou take, were you satisfied with everything in the United States?\u201d Mainly, yes, but little things\nlike that. That it\u2019s not as free and not as honest as I thought the way they were described to me\nat the time.",
        "A: Well, not very normal. In Washington, yes, we had couple of apartments and we worked hard to\nget it. Little apartments. But when we moved to Bloomington, Indiana, that\u2019s when we had the\ntrailer, because he would have liked to get housing for married couple. But they were hard to\n19\nget. They were not available all the time. So, I stayed in Washington with a friend of his for a\nfew weeks after he already had to be in school by September. And I had a baby by then, my son,\nAndy, was born May the 4\", 1948. And when did you come to talk to me last time here?",
        "A: Was it after January or was it before?",
        "A: Did I tell you that my son died?",
        "A: My oldest, this one, I\u2019m just talking about.",
        "A: That was, that\u2019s why I wondered if it was after January, then you had to be here before January,\nbecause I would have mentioned it to you. But I\u2019m not sure when you were here.",
        "A: So, anyway my son was born. His name was Andy.",
        "A: Yes, kind of, because my brother\u2019s name was Andras. In our family, cousins and so on, I don\u2019t\nknow why, but so many people name their children... in Argentina it\u2019s Andres, in Hungary it\nwas Andras and in the United States it was Andrew. But I started it. I named him Andrew. His\nmiddle name was Allen. So, I stayed with a young couple for a few weeks in Budapest, and\nSandy had to be already, not Budapest, 1n Washington. He had to be in Bloomington. And the\nonly thing he could get was that trailer. So, he didn\u2019t want me to stay in Washington that long,\nand so I think I took the train, at that time trains were more popular, with my baby, who was five\nmonths old when we moved to Bloomington.",
        "A: Well, that is where I am tough. I never thought that a baby should not have a bath, so every\nsingle day I would go and get the water, put it in that little bitty sink... that whole trailer was not\nas big as this porch. Not really.",
        "A: It could not have been that big.\n20",
        "A: And I don\u2019t know whether the Holocaust Museum is even interested in that kind of stuff. I just\ntell you. One section of it was that if you opened the studio, gosh that made a bed. That\u2019s what\nwe slept on. Then the middle part was just a little sink, a tiny, little sink and some sort of a\ncooking facility, tiny. And the third part of it was, it was kind of those round top of the trailers.\nThe campus, I heard, bought them all from somewhere for a dollar apiece. And we paid 25\ndollars for that. The third part was just big enough for a little crib, so I don\u2019t think it was as big\nas this. Might have been half of the size. I was very... I accepted that, too. And you know, I\nused to think, well now I\u2019m free and I\u2019m not in Auschwitz. Some people wouldn\u2019t have lived\nlike that, they rented an apartment maybe, housing place. Then they complained all the time that\nthe landlady told them that they use too much water and they have the lights on too long. And\nwe were kind of feeling that we do whatever we want in that little trailer. And so that was\nsomewhat our own, 25 dollars, all utilities included. You couldn\u2019t go any better. And Sandy\nwas making, getting some kind of a, you know he was on the G.I. Bill. And then in graduate\nschool he did some sort of a little extra work. So, the G.I. Bill paid his tuition. Maybe he got a\nhundred twenty-five dollars or whatever, 150 dollars a month. So the 25 dollars was for rent and\nthen we lived on the rest of it. (Laughing.) But again I just accepted things better than a lot of\npeople. My God, if I would see my friends\u2019 children now living under that condition, they would\nthink, \u201cMy God, I can\u2019t live like that.\u201d But we did. Then we moved into another trailer which\nwas a little taller and we didn\u2019t bump our heads all the time. Might have mentioned it, too. And\nthen we got a Hoosier Court apartment, where we had two bedrooms and a kitchen and it was\nnormal, for $42.50. And that\u2019s where we lived then all during the time we were in Bloomington.",
        "A: I worried because I, see now I can talk to anybody and I don\u2019t care, you know, that I would be\ndenying my religion. At that time, I worried, you know, what could be the consequences of that?\nOr I mentioned that, maybe in Mary K.\u2019s interview, but I will say when we moved to Louisville,\nKentucky and we lived in the South end, so that was in 1953. And I was in concentration camp\nin \u201845, so that was almost eight years after. And we had a neighbor next door, she took me\naround, showed me the Iroquois Park. It\u2019s a pretty city. They had a child my son\u2019s, Andy\u2019s age.\nAnd she asked me what church I go to. And I told her, \u201cI don\u2019t go to any church, I\u2019m Jewish.\u201d\nAnd I said it without any worry. But I thought to myself, if she still will speak to me after this,\nI\u2019m okay. If not...? See, and that was eight years after that.",
        "A: I\u2019m not, not in Bloomington, Indiana. It went through my mind a lot of times, what so many\nother refugees might have told you, maybe not, some people might have gotten more religious.\nSome people might have had some doubts. Where was God when all this happened? So that\nwent through my mind a lot. Now, Sandy\u2019s family was Orthodox and they were very religious.\n21\nWhen he came to this country, he asked his uncle, the first Rosh Hashanah, that he would like to\ngo to the synagogue. And the uncle, since he was married to a non-Jewish person, said, \u201cIll ask\na friend of mine. He\u2019ll pick you up.\u201d Well, in Hungary, when you went to the temple, you first\nof all didn\u2019t go by car. You couldn\u2019t drive on that day. So, somebody picked him up and took\nhim to the synagogue. It was not a, it was not a Conservative one. And maybe the men did not\nwear hats, maybe they did. The men and the women were together, not like in... even where I\nbelong to... his family was, they were Orthodox. Mine were not. But in our synagogue, the\nwomen sit upstairs and the men sit downstairs. So, he was very, very disappointed. An organ in\nthe synagogue, music, I mean everything, just what he never had before. And somehow it didn\u2019t\nremind him of anything he remembered. And that turned him off somehow. I mean, maybe\nshouldn\u2019t have, but it did. So some people could be considered very religious and they keep it\nup. He didn\u2019t. When I came out to this country, we did not belong to anything, at all. And I\nsomehow didn\u2019t miss it, but when my kids were getting to be Sunday school age, and that was\nalready in Louisville, Kentucky, then we did join a synagogue at the time.",
        "A: At that time it was called B\u2019rith Sholom. It was not a Conservative. But we did, because I felt\nlike the kids ought to have some Jewish background.",
        "A: Let\u2019s see, which 1s the least religious?",
        "A: Reformed. It was Reformed. Conservative is more religious. But there you would go and it was\nthe type, again, it reminded me more of a Protestant type of church. You know, it was just so\nstrange to me and of course everything was in English and very little in Hebrew. But we\nbelonged there and I went to the holidays and took the kids. But since we did not observe it, the\nway some, and I don\u2019t know how religious your family is, so I\u2019m not comparing myself to\nanybody else. I\u2019m just telling it to you. Therefore I didn\u2019t expect my children to become that\nreligious either. I took them to Sunday school, because I felt like they should have that\nbackground. But the Sunday schools at that time, at least where we belonged, was not anything\nthat I would think desirable. The teachers were just volunteer people. The discipline was not\nvery good. The kids could do anything they wanted to and if they left Sunday school and they\nwalked over to an ice cream place and they came back. I would hear stories like that. And that\ndisappointed me, because it didn\u2019t leave any impression on them. Now, the Sunday schools now\nthat, let me see, my daughter, Linda, is married to a Jewish guy. And they do belong and I do\ntoo, now, to Temple Shalom, which is actually one branch of the B\u2019rith Sholom, which long time\nago closed up. And Adath Israel and B\u2019rith Sholom merged and it became the Temple, which is\na big and fancy one and a lot of rich people belong there. And the Temple Shalom is a lot more\nReformed and we do like our rabbi very much. And I go on High Holy days. I don\u2019t go that\noften, but he\u2019s a real nice guy. And Linda\u2019s kids go to Sunday school. And the teachers are\nnice. They learn a lot more and they like to go. My kids didn\u2019t like to go, because they just\ndidn\u2019t get anything out of it. And I\u2019m sorry about that, but that\u2019s the way it was. Now, my son-\n22\nin-law here, Mark, actually even teaches Sunday school at that same place. And I felt like I\nwanted to join. Sandy wouldn\u2019t have cared either way. I said, now in my older age, I kind of\nfelt like... because I\u2019m not so religious, but I have my, a traditional background, which you can\nnever ever get out of your system. So, it\u2019s not the same as the way I remember the high holidays\nin Europe. Everything was in Hebrew and I remember on Yom Kippur, I would go and visit my\nfamily while they were sitting, all day long at the synagogue. We were not Orthodox. We didn\u2019t\nkeep kosher, so... and I like that. Because I knew a lot of religious people who... like in\nSandy\u2019s family maybe they didn\u2019t eat in their home, but they would go out and eat stuff that they\nreally shouldn\u2019t. Or Mark\u2019s family in Brooklyn, they were very religious. They kept kosher.\nWhen they come to visit to Louisville, we would go out for dinner and absolutely never failed\nthat the father would not order maybe bacon or ham or that kind of thing. And I felt like that\u2019s\nkind of, you know, it\u2019s not really true. Either you keep it or you don\u2019t keep it. They were very\nnice people. They\u2019re both dead now and I liked them very much. But my family wasn\u2019t like\nthat. We ate anything and we weren\u2019t... and I kind of like that. I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019re\nreligious or not, very religious or not.",
        "A: Well, we were living in Bloomington from 1948 to 1951. My daughter, actually she\u2019s coming\ntomorrow from Seattle. She was born in 1950 in Bloomington. Andy was born in Washington,\nD.C. \u201851 we moved to Marion, Indiana and spent one year there. And I might have told that to\nMary K. Sandy was having to do his internship in Psychology at the VA Hospital, so we lived\nthere for one year. The rents over there were a lot more expensive now than in Bloomington on\nthe campus. And his pay was a little bit more, but not very much and I had two kids by then.\nAnd many of the wives of the people who were there on internship, did some work at night. And\nI wanted to do some work myself. And there was a glass factory, the Forbes. They\nmanufactured all kinds of bottles, just beer bottles, little bottles and so on. And I got a job there.\nI never done that kind of work, but I did it. And I went to work at six o\u2019clock in the evening. He\ncame home from the VA at 4:30. So, he took care of the kids and I went to work at six and came\nhome at midnight.",
        "A: And that was kind of hard work, but again I wanted to do it. And the only reason I wanted to do\nit because I wanted a couple of things that I felt like I can\u2019t afford. I wanted an ironing board,\nwhich happened to be the Mary Proctor ironing board, which was expensive at the time and\nactually not very long ago it finally broke on me. And Sandy would have liked to have a good\ncamera, so I decided I would work, because nothing extra like that we would have had enough\nmoney. I\u2019ll work for a month or two, I thought, but then I couldn\u2019t leave the work. And I\nworked all the way until it was time for us to leave. I can\u2019t remember what the pay was. I do\nknow that it was really cold in winter time, because you had assembly lines and close to a door\nand it was freezing. And it would have, have you ever seen a Charlie Chaplin movie, you know?\nLike where the best part of my work was when there was something wrong with the assembly\nline and the machine stopped. And there would be a space. Otherwise you just had to constantly\npick up the bottles, check them for a minute, like this, and put them in a box. And you could not\nstop. Then somebody would be coming and relieve you in order to go to the restroom. And I did\n23\nthat from all the way till the end of our staying there, which was sometimes in the middle of\nsummer. And we went back to Bloomington, Indiana, because he had to get his Ph.D. See that\nwas just a year internship. Not much to be told about that year. You know, I had two kids and I\nworked and he worked, so not much was happening.",
        "A: No, not there. But I don\u2019t think in Marion, yet, I talked to anybody about that. First of all, we\nknew a few people, but we didn\u2019t make too many friends. And the subject never came up. And I\nwas so busy with the kids that, you know, I didn\u2019t talk about it, or... I remember we were\nrenting in Marion, a National home for 92 dollars. And I was sick one time with strep throat.\nAnd Sandy got a call somewhere about some pay raise, something. And he got so excited and he\nwas doing the laundry. And we had some sort of washing machine that you had to stop it in\nbetween all the periods. And suddenly the water overflowed and the water was coming all over\nthe whole National home, you know, it\u2019s... I don\u2019t know if you know what they are like. They\nare pre-fab houses, so they\u2019re not very super, but it was nice. It was like a two or three bedroom\nlittle house with a modern kitchen. It was very nice. So then not much happened in Marion and\nwe went back to Bloomington, Indiana. And we bought a car. That was our first time that we\nhad a car already in Marion. And I learned, actually practiced, how to drive at the VA, because\nit was just a nice big campus that no traffic. But my real experience for learning how to drive\nwas still in Bloomington, Indiana. For five dollars, we got like a course, and I learned how to\ndrive, but since we didn\u2019t have a car, I couldn\u2019t practice it. So, in Marion we did have a car and I\npracticed how to drive. And I went back to Bloomington, Indiana, I got my license.\nEnd of Tape 2, Side A\n24\nTape 2, Side B",
        "A: So then we... how did we get to Louisville, your question was. A friend of Sandy\u2019s heard about\na job and he was offered that job. It was a post-doctoral fellowship at the Child Guidance Clinic\nhere in Louisville. And his name was Fred Kanfer and he was more an experimental\npsychologist, not a clinical psychologist. And he did not want the job and he mentioned it to\nSandy. And so he came to Louisville and he applied for it. And he got that job at the Child\nGuidance Clinic, which was for one year only. And that was kind of very nice. We lived in an\napartment in the South end, it\u2019s where I met the person, who I first felt like, she still must like\nme, even so that she found out that I was Jewish. Now that was many years later. And the\npeople at the Child Guidance Clinic were very, very nice. They are all older social workers or\npsychiatrists or psychologists. They practically took us in like a family. They had lot of family\nget-togethers. And we didn\u2019t go out otherwise. Because then my daughter was born, Linda was\nborn, in 1954. So we moved to Louisville in \u201853 and we still lived in the South end when she\nwas born. And our assignment was only for one year. And now my story is really important\nhere, but I couldn\u2019t see myself moving in September when she was supposed to born in\nSeptember. And we didn\u2019t have much money because that pay was, you know, quite little. And\nour apartment at the Washington Park apartments was already then eighty-two dollars and\nninety-five cents or so. We had to pay utilities, too. So I told Sandy just anything he could do.\nAnd by then I could walk to the grocery, because it was right behind our apartments. I could\nwalk, we had one car, I could walk to the pediatrician. And I never did anything else, like go to\ntown or do that kind of stuff. And I said, \u201cI wish we could stay just at least maybe for one more\nyear, so we don\u2019t have to move just exactly in September.\u201d Because they usually would have\nseminars and then people would go to those seminars and then people come with job\nopportunities. So Sandy would have had to go to one of those things and find a job. And we\nwould have had to move. Well, it was very, very hard even for me to imagine and so, the Child\nGuidance Clinic gave him a part time job. And at Norton he worked part time and in one other\nhospital it was part time. I mean, just very little, here and there. Then he met two psychiatrists,\nwho needed somebody and they became our friends, too. And they needed somebody who\nwould do some testing for them. And they offered him to try and see if he would like that. And\nhe tried it and they offered him a nice salary and that\u2019s how we stayed in Louisville. He worked\nwith them for a long time. And those psychiatrists are still alive and they are very nice people.\nWe\u2019re still friends. And Linda was born in \u201854, so I didn\u2019t have to move away. And then we\nstayed in the apartments until 1957. And we were looking for a house and we found this and we\nhave been here ever since.",
        "A: 1957. So, from \u201853 to \u201857 we lived there. At that time, I didn\u2019t have my fourth child, yet. Now\nthere is, if you have any questions about our stay here, you can ask me. And then... but you ask\nme, because I don\u2019t know what you want.\n25",
        "A: Was it?",
        "A: Tell me, when was the Civil Right Movement and the Martin Luther King, and when... you\nknow I\u2019ve been watching those programs all the time, but I don\u2019t remember the dates. When\nwas it that finally, really, for example, black people didn\u2019t have to sit on the back of the bus and\nall that? Do you remember dates like that?",
        "A: Because I remember the Civil Rights movements in the \u201860s. I didn\u2019t, it didn\u2019t leave any special\nimpression with me. I didn\u2019t go anywhere much, you know. I was very busy with the kids. And\nI didn\u2019t even watch, well we didn\u2019t have any television at that time, I remember. It was later.\nAnd when you get busy, I spend a lot more time now, listening to the news and being involved.\nBut I was a very conscientious mother and there was just a lot to do. By then I had three kids\nand you know, diapers and just... I was very, very busy. And since Sandy worked, day and very\nmany times in the evening, he wasn\u2019t really that much of a help. He couldn\u2019t. In summertime\nwe would go one vacation, we did every year. Because his uncle in Washington had a summer\nhome in Annapolis, Maryland and he offered for us to go there. So, we would leave in the\nevening and drive all night to get to Annapolis by next day. And we would spend two weeks\nthere, which was again, some mothers might have been complaining about it, but I did not. It\nwasn\u2019t really that easy on me, because, you know, I did the cooking and it wasn\u2019t a luxury. But\nthe kids had a good time, you know, Sandy would take them out and they would fish and maybe\nthey go on a boat ride. But Linda was still a baby, so I was really more like a mom over there,\nthan it was a really exciting vacation. So, we had done that for many years, till my youngest one\nwas two years old, and then they sold that place. But no, I did not remember anything that I was\nthat worried about that. And when we come to schools maybe, you might like to... and I will\nhave a really important story, too, about my oldest son, Andy, who... the school was nearby us\nhere, where we live even now. That\u2019s where he went to elementary school.",
        "A: Belknap, Belknap Elementary School, which is no longer existing, the building is there, but no\nmore. And all my kids went to that school. Then, we, well in the South end, I\u2019m sorry we lived.\nAndy went to, isn\u2019t that funny, I forgot the name of it, now. There was an elementary school\nthere. And he was in fourth grade when we moved here. And my youngest daughter, I mean\nElizabeth was two years younger, so she went to kindergarten over there. And the name would\ncome to me later, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that important. So in here, since we lived all our life here,\n26\nlet me just talk about that. They went to Belknap Elementary School. And then to, and Andy\nfinished here. He was in sixth grade. And he met some really nice friends on our street. Then\nthey went to Highland Junior High School. Now, the friend, who we met here and became\nfriendly with Andy was two years older. Non-Jewish people, he was very liberal type. And he\nstarted a club. I don\u2019t know how much you know about social clubs. We belonged to the Jewish\nCommunity Center, too. Sandy was pretty against those things, but he always said, I wish they\nwould ask them and I wish they could refuse it, meaning, you know... because he had problems,\nyou know, as a child psychologist with kids, they\u2019re so upset and depressed over that they were\nnot included in one of those clubs. And those social clubs were horrible things, but they existed.\nSo, my kids were invited to it, but they weren\u2019t terribly active at the Jewish Community Center.\nFor example, they had those, it\u2019s really not important to even talk about. But Andy\u2019s friend\nstarted a new club. It was called the Princeton. And there was no question that blacks should\nnot be a part of it or Jews should not be part of it, he was that kind of a kid.",
        "A: They should be part of it. I mean his was an integrated club and that was his main concern, that\nanybody, Jews or blacks should be able to... whether they did or not, I\u2019m not sure. But Andy\nwas Jewish and he was part of that club. So, he finished, that was junior high school and I\ncannot talk forever about anything. Then he went to Atherton High School and he finished that.\nAnd he was in the marching band, but he never liked to wear uniforms. He had had to, would\nhave, but they were just kind of... that psychiatrist\u2019s son, who gave Sandy the job, he had a son\nAndy\u2019s age. And they were together in the marching band. And they would carry their uniform.\nThey wouldn\u2019t be caught dead putting it on and go like that. [ll try to make that all brief. He\ngraduated from high school in 1966 and went away to college to Lawrence University in\nAppleton, Wisconsin. He left in September. I got him all ready, with clothes and everything\nelse. By then I had my youngest one, who was six years old, because he was born in 1960...",
        "A: Robert, the younger one, who is now living in Nashville. Well, my big tragedy comes now, that\nin September he moved to Appleton, Wisconsin. Friday before Thanksgiving in November,\nSandy left, went to Atlanta to a psychological meeting. I was just cleaning up all the leaves in\nthe yard, got a call from Appleton that Andy was in an accident. Well, what happened, that they\nlived on the dorm... and there was a church, which was already barricaded and people didn\u2019t go\nin there, but sometimes they did, with the idea boys will be boys. One of Andy\u2019s friends asked\nhim if he wouldn\u2019t mind coming up there. And Andy says, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve been there last week. I\ndon\u2019t want to go.\u201d \u201cOh, come on, I don\u2019t want to go by myself.\u201d That kid wanted a light bulb. I\nmean silly thing, it doesn\u2019t make any sense. They went up into the place. It was barricaded, but\npeople went in all the time, because it was kind of like a hiding place. And they were way up\nhigh and he stepped on a false ceiling, that was... he was in the front and the boy was behind\nhim and he fell through, 35 feet. And I got the phone call. They wanted me to say that anything\nthey can do, that I should give my... I said my husband was out of town. So I want to make that\nstory kind of short, but it was...",
        "A: It was in 1966 in November. So, I got into my car, quick went over to that psychiatrist friend of\nours, who was just recuperating from pneumonia. I told him quick what happened. He was\ntrying to reach Sandy in Atlanta. He called the hospital. He told them, they do whatever they\nneed to do. (Coughs.) Stop it now for a minute, I\u2019m going to get some...",
        "A: The reason this is important, because at that time when this happened, I thought to myself, the\nHolocaust was enough. And I didn\u2019t expect to have another something like this to happen. But I\nhandled that pretty well, too. But I remember when the telephone calls were done and my\nfriend\u2019s wife offered that she\u2019ll come with me to Appleton. And I said, well maybe that\u2019s not\nnecessary. We left John Bell, Dr. Bell 1s the psychiatrist who reached Sandy at the Atlanta\nairport and he turned right back around on the airplane. So my friend, his wife, took me to the\nairport and we felt if he will be on that plane that we were supposed to be taking, then Nancy\nwould not come with me. In the meantime, I had to leave my six year old son, Linda was ten and\nElizabeth was twelve. But at that time, Sandy has a sister, whose daughter just graduated from\nhigh school, who was Andy\u2019s age. And she came to stay with us for a whole year. And that was\nthe year that she was staying here, from Buenos Aires, Argentina. And she had a hard time to\nadjust, too. She was very homesick. But at that time she already decided she\u2019s staying. Now,\nshe was a, she was, she liked to cook, and she was... well, I had a help in the house too, not all\nthe time, but a couple times a week. So, I just packed my stuff. I remember the kids all standing\nnext to me. And I thought about cold weather and warm weather and I packed my suitcase. And\nwith her, with Kathy being here, who is 18. No, I\u2019m sorry, Elizabeth was sixteen and Linda was\ntwelve and Robert was six. So, anyway, I said, \u201cI just have to leave.\u201d And I was hoping that\neverything will turn out okay. And I\u2019m still seeing the kids standing there, they were, you know,\nof course terribly worried. And I went to the airport. Sandy was on that plane coming back from\nAtlanta and we flew to Appleton, Wisconsin. It was in the middle of the night. We didn\u2019t know\nwhat we were going to find. And it was, you know, really heartbreaking in a way, and we...\nsomebody took us into the hospital and Andy was under all kind of wires. And he was in a coma\nactually for about three days, completely out of it. And Sandy stayed with me until he was\ncoming to, and... not that he was better, but he was not in a coma anymore. And one very\nimportant story I must tell you. The day we arrived, of course there was an article in that, in the\nAppleton paper. And somebody called the hospital and wanted to meet the parents of this young\nboy. And that was a Catholic family, a mother and a father, who had also four children, but they\nwere already older and out of the house. And they came to the hospital and not even knowing\nme or Sandy, they offered their house. They lived pretty close to the hospital. That I could stay\nwith them. And they were wonderful. And now see, something like that makes me cry. I was\nthere for six weeks and I could walk from the hospital to their home. The kids were out of her\nhouse already, so she had a place. I could talk to somebody at night about how things are going.\nAnd otherwise I spent the whole day in the hospital. See the result of all this was, that\neventually, I mean, his spinal cord was injured and he became a paraplegic. But we didn\u2019t know\nthat for a long time, you know. I don\u2019t know if you know anybody, when people are this sick,\nthat for example they have movements in their leg, which is just nothing. It doesn\u2019t mean\nanything. But sometimes I would talk to them on the phone all the time. See Sandy stayed for a\nlittle while and then he went back home. So, I talked to them on the phone all the time and\n28\neventually I got, and I still have that, I never wanted to throw it away. I thought now when Andy\ndied, then maybe I will throw it away. I can not. I have letters and letters and letters people\nwrote to me, to the hospital. And I still have them. In fact, just a little while ago, I re-read them.\nI never, never could open those letters until just recently. And they were helping with the kids\nand they were bringing food for them and you know, they were... the kids were wonderful.\nThey were behaving very nicely. And so, I was there for six weeks. At Christmas time or\nholiday time, they came, all of them, to Appleton. And that\u2019s the only time we stayed in a hotel,\nbecause this family, named Alice and Art, children came home for the holidays and there was not\nenough room. But that made it so much easier for me. And of course, I couldn\u2019t sleep well and I\ngot some tranquilizers from this psychiatrist doctor. Which even maybe even two pills couldn\u2019t\nmake me relax enough. But I there again was... I don\u2019t think I cried. I was under tremendous\ntension all the time, and not knowing what the outcome will be. Appleton was finished. Finally\nwe decided that we can bring him home. So, with an ambulance we brought him home to\nLouisville. And of course, he couldn\u2019t sit up or anything like that. I mean, it was... he was\nparalyzed from waist down. But at that time he wasn\u2019t absolutely sure about it, but they gave\nhim a final test. And the final test showed that the spinal cord was completely severed, so\ninjured, and that doesn\u2019t look like, you know, it can be ever... but making the story short, we put\nhim here in Louisville, into a hospital, which at that time was the St. Anthony Hospital. We had\na friend who was that kind of doctor who dealt with this kind of injuries, except... he was a\nwonderful man, he was a friend, but he didn\u2019t know enough about the whole deal. Because I\nremember we were very disappointed. The hospital, like the orderly put him, in the bathroom,\nput him on the toilet and left him there. I mean his back was... he shouldn\u2019t have done that. He\nwas there for six weeks and at the very end, our friend, the psychiatrist, made arrangements at\nthe Rusk Institute in New York City. That they can transfer him there. Which they did, and just\nvery briefly, before they left, a nurse offered, private nurse will stay with us for the weekend,\nbefore Andy goes, because Andy wanted to come home for the weekend. Well, that woman was\nabsolutely, she should have never been a nurse. She tried to show, she said that she had a\ndaughter who had polio and that daughter of hers walked after a while. She kept on telling\nAndy, if you have faith, you will be walking again. Well, she should have never said that. And\nthen we were over here in that weekend in my house. She made him, with crutches and braces,\nstand above behind the wheelchair. And Kathy, who 1s a big, heavyset girl, sat in the wheelchair.\nAnd he wanted to prove something, that how much he advanced. Well, with the braces, he\ncouldn\u2019t walk, but she made him stand up. So, then he sat in a chair in the living room and he\nsays, \u201cBoy that feels good.\u201d And the nurse says, \u201cMaybe it feels good for you, but it\u2019s not...\nmaybe it feels good, but it\u2019s not good for you.\u201d And Andy says, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not good for me,\nbut it still feels good.\u201d And the woman got so angry, that came out to the kitchen and says, \u201cI\u2019m\nleaving.\u201d And I went out to the kitchen... yes, I did cry then. I gave her the check, what I owed\nher. And I couldn\u2019t believe it, he was sitting in that chair upstairs. And Sandy calls home, \u201cHow\nis everything going?\u201d And I says, whatever the nurse\u2019s name was, she left. \u201cI\u2019ll be right home.\u201d\nSo, he came home and we had some real good friends, who are still our friends. He used to be\nour family doctor and his wife, and Doctor Eskind and his wife came over because they knew\nAndy\u2019s going to leave. And they wanted to say good-bye to him. And Andy\u2019s sitting in the\nchair. I tell them the whole story. They couldn\u2019t believe it. And finally Sandy and Harold\nEskind help him down... we have all those steps... helped him down to the bedroom. And\nHarold says, \u201cPll come over tomorrow morning.\u201d See she was supposed to be here and help us\ngetting him ready. I mean, you know, with a paraplegic, it takes a long time to do that. And\n29\nHarold said, \u201cPll come over early in the morning, because I\u2019m not sure when the plane was\nleaving.\u201d And we said, \u201cOh don\u2019t worry about it. We\u2019ll just get up an hour earlier,\u201d or\nwhatever. And Robert that night, who was only six, slept in the TV room right opposite of our\nbedroom. I mean, he was upset and he was worried. And he woke up with a hundred and four\nfever. And so, as I said, loud, I said, \u201c\u201cGod, we sure could use Doctor Eskind now. And as I said\nthat, apparently our living room was open and he did come anyway. And he was walking in and\nhe says, \u201cHere Iam.\u201d That was, you know, like an angel coming from heaven. He helped us get,\nhe helped us getting Andy ready. He gave Robert a shot, I think, whatever he needed. I didn\u2019t\ngo with them. It was only Sandy and Andy who flew to... the Ruskin Institute did marvels. He\nwas there for six weeks. Luckily his mind was completely well. They taught him how to drive.\nThey taught him how to get dressed. They taught him complete independency. And Andy used\nto be a very stubborn kid as a young person. When he wanted to do something, he wanted to do\nit right then. And that helped him tremendously in his accident. Of course, he decided and I\nhave a beautiful paper, which he wrote, then later he... I don\u2019t want to jump ahead of myself, but\nhe learned how to do all this. He got acar. It had a hand control. And he was home the first\nyear. He used to have a girlfriend from Myrtle Beach from before his accident. He says he\nwants to visit her. And we begged him, it\u2019s too early, yet. I mean he... all by himself to go to\nNorth Carolina or wherever the girl lived. He says, \u201cIf I would know that I\u2019m going to walk next\nyear, I would wait, but since I know I\u2019m not going to, I want to do it right now.\u201d _He got in the\ncar, he drove over there. I said, \u201cPlease call us the minute you get there.\u201d He did. So, anyway\nhe was really unbelievably... you know, I still say that. Then he went back to Lawrence, he\nwent back to Lawrence University for a semester. And he did very well, but it got very cold\nthere in Wisconsin and the snow was so high, that he couldn\u2019t even get out of his dormitory to\nget to the, like to the classes. So, Sandy sent somebody, a young man, who moved him back and\nhe was transferred to Houston, Texas. To the University where the climate is different. So, he\nwent back there and he finished college in three and a half years, instead of four. I mean, he\nmade up. And in summer time, he went to Chapel Hill, North Carolina and spent summer school\nthere. And one summer he went to Boston, to Harvard, just for a semester. So, he made up all\nhis lost time. He finished and then he moved out to California. He was very independent. He\ndid everything on his own. And in the beginning, he didn\u2019t really want to come back that much.\nI think the memories and all that. For example, he was fighting that we shouldn\u2019t put an elevator\nin the house. He didn\u2019t want us to move and we didn\u2019t. We tried to put an elevator in, but with\nthis split-level it wasn\u2019t that easy. And when he would come home, he was so matter of fact of\nanybody who wanted to help him, lift him up. I mean, he got used to the idea. Then he decided\nhe\u2019s going to go to Social Work school. And he applied to Kent Social Work School (ph) and\nthat\u2019s when he wrote... I could give you that, I mean just for your own fun. When he applied to\nthe school, he wrote a beautiful paper, which now after he died, Sandy made a bunch of copies of\nthem. And just since you\u2019re interested and all, I give you a copy of that and also a newspaper\nclipping after he died. He got interested in California and don\u2019t ask me why, with a Lyndon\nLaRouche political group. I don\u2019t know if you ever heard of him or not. But he met tremendous\namount and good friends through all those years, who became so close to him, that in the\nbeginning, I wondered what they are like. But then later on we met them. They became, besides\nthe political adventures, they were interested in poetry. And Andy also loved music, became\nmore and more so. He had a selection of CD\u2019s bigger than we have. And he, first they lived in\nSan Francisco, then they moved to Livermore, California and I visited him there. I met some of\nthose people. And then they moved to Los Angeles and I was there. Now just a year and a half\n30\nago, couple of years ago, he had to have a surgery, a bladder surgery. The doctor recommended\nhim, that if he wouldn\u2019t do it, then eventually his kidneys would become infected by it. He\ndecided, we asked a lot of informations whether is that a good thing to do. And everybody\nrecommended. And I went to Los Angeles. I stayed with him for three and a half weeks, while\nhe had the surgery. When... Sandy and I went together and then after Sandy had to leave and I\nstayed. And the people were very, very nice. They gave a big party. And they were singing and\nthey read poetry before he went into the hospital. Then after that they kept on coming all the\ntime. They enlarged the bladder, took a part of the intestine and made the bladder bigger. So,\nanyway, that was the... whatever they had to do. . In fact, both of his doctors were\nJewish, just so happened that from the name I could tell. Nice, nice people, very nice. And he\nwas in a hospital in Los Angeles, in a Mexican, you know, there were a lot of Mexican and\nSpanish speaking people there. And I worried a little bit, because he didn\u2019t have to pay a penny.\nIt was, you know he was... since he was a handicapped person, he had all the facilities there,\nwhich were paid. And they were wonderful. So, I was pleased with that. He recuperated. We\nwent home and he worried that his appetite is not as good as it used to be. I said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\nmean, they messed up your stomach. You\u2019ll be all right.\u201d So, my big job was cooking for him,\nplus showing him the CD\u2019s, which one he wants first. And we played all day long. The people\nhe lived with, he had two roommates. Andy never got married, two guys. They were very nice.\nThen I came home. Then I have never seen him afterwards, but he was all right. He was going\nto come back. And one day, on a Sunday, January 24\", I get a phone call from his roommate.\nAnd Chuck says, \u201cI have very sad news for you.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat?\u201d I thought he might have\ngotten sick again and then I would have gone out to be with him. Well, he died in his sleep. He\ndidn\u2019t wake up. It was a Sunday morning, from Saturday to Sunday. Saturday night, he was in\nthe office and they were doing some kind of an experiment. They were really bright, intelligent\npeople. How they got involved with Lyndon LaRouche...\nEnd of Tape 2, Side B\n31\nTape 3, Side A",
        "A: And I dealt with it, but I remember when I got this news I couldn\u2019t believe it. And I still right\nnow, when I say to you that Auschwitz seems like a dream and it wasn\u2019t me. Sometimes I think\nof this and I said, \u201cIs it really true that he\u2019s no longer alive?\u201d But then again, I measure certain\nthings. We used to worry, what will happen to Andy when we die, and this group falls apart?\nMy daughter, Linda, she\u2019s a nurse and she says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I'll take care of him.\u201d Well,\nAndy didn\u2019t like to be taken care of. He could do everything in the world on his own. Anything.\nDriving, shopping. I mean you wouldn\u2019t believe it, if I give you something about this, you\nwouldn\u2019t believe it. Like we have a friend here, who took him on a Sierra weekend, canoe trip.\nAnd in the mud, she pushed the wheelchair and he would get into the canoe. I mean, there was\nnothing that he would not want to do. He was just brave. And when I got this note, I mean I\ncouldn\u2019t believe it. And we didn\u2019t know quite what to do. We had Sandy\u2019s sister here from\nHungary for three months, who was eighty-four years old. She took this very hard, plus she was\ntoo old to travel. So, my youngest son, Robert, offered that he\u2019ll come with me to Los Angeles.\nAnd we flew over there a week later. That was the end of, it was January 31\u201c that they had a\nmemorial service for him. And it was really very, very nice. When I went into that room... and\nI know Jewish funerals, well that wasn\u2019t a funeral, just a memorial. They had some flowers.\nThey had a big poster of Andy. He was very involved with... he loved Shakespeare, and they\nwere very intellectual, but at the same time they were just nice, nice people. And we had a\nlovely... the whole memorial service lasted for three and half hours and about 11:30, well\neverybody decided, it\u2019s time to quit. But there were speeches and people were sending letters\nand all the letters were, some people read poems. The day when this happened, in Andy\u2019s house,\nthey were meeting for a poetry reading group, at 11 o\u2019clock, every Sunday. And Andy didn\u2019t get\nup on time, so they were kind of thinking that he went to bed late, maybe he just didn\u2019t wake up.\nBut they... and they wondered why, but they weren\u2019t going to wake him up. And later on, a few\nhours later, when he still wasn\u2019t up, Chuck opened his door and he was in bed, asleep. And he\nhad died maybe about maybe three, four o\u2019clock. So, he did not take good care of his eating\nhabits, I think. He loved all the things which are really not that good for you, butter and salami.\nHe exercised, but only in the wheelchair, naturally. And he just, it had to be a, it was his heart,\nyou know, like he must have had clogged-up arteries. Although when he had that surgery, they\nchecked him out and he was okay then. I mean, there were no problems, but that was a year and\na half later. And that\u2019s really what happened. Now you can ask me all kinds of questions.",
        "A: I felt angry when he had his accident, but not really angry. I just could not accept, I thought that\none... you know, just there is so much one person should take. And I felt to myself, it\u2019s not fair.\nBut in the meantime, I realized that it\u2019s nothing fair, you know, this friend of mine, who was\ngoing to take me to Annapolis and who was very sympathetic and they had four kids and one of\nthem was a good friend of Andy. Their older son was coming home, not even a year afterwards\nthat this happened, coming home from college, and was in a car accident and died in a car\naccident. So, Nancy said she always, she... at that time, I talked about this at the airport. We\nwere waiting for the plane to come. I told her the same thing I\u2019m telling you, that I thought that,\nyou know, that I had my share and it\u2019s just not fair that now this had to happen. And Nancy after\nthat realized, it\u2019s nothing 1s fair. There is no... whatever...\n32",
        "A: Justice. Whatever is assigned for you, it will happen and you cannot say, just because this\nhappened, nothing else would happen. So, I\u2019m now prepared and I hope nothing else would\nhappen, but after he died, I wasn\u2019t angry about that, I was more angry about his... well, not\nangry, but sad when he had the accident. Because no matter how he accepted it and he was great\nby it. And I will give you that, I really will give you, because you seem interested in it. The way\nhis friends talked about it all. That he never married. If he would have been old in the\nwheelchair, he would have needed help, you know. Those people were his friends, but they were\nnot the family. If we would have died, we would have wondered. So, I used to think about that,\nwhat will happen to him. And he lived on the absolute minimum, you know? Like my youngest\nson, Robert, he has a big house, he has a boat. And he\u2019s an administer, I mean a hospital\nadminister, administrator. Andy, nothing, he didn\u2019t, you know he was in the 1960s. When the\nCivil Rights movement was... he was paralyzed... from Texas, he took a bus to Washington,\nD.C. when they had the march. And in the bus, his toes got burned, because his foot was close to\nthe heater and he could never feel it. And Sandy was saying, \u201cDo you think you have to go or\nyou want to go?\u201d I mean, he was there. He said, \u201cIf everybody would feel like that they\nshouldn\u2019t go and use all kinds of excuses, then nobody would be there.\u201d So, he just... causes\nwere terribly important to him. And now you have to just ask questions. I can\u2019t talk to you\nabout anything.",
        "A: Well that\u2019s, as I said, that can, if I think over all that six weeks in Appleton and now, you know, I\nmean we got hundreds... well, then we had a memorial service in Louisville, after we came\nback. And I told you that we now belong to Temple Shalom. And when this happened, we got\nthe news of Andy dying. Linda and Mark, my daughter and husband came over, and I said, I\nwould like our rabbi to know this. And Mark called, his name is Stanley Miles. He\u2019s a very nice\nguy, turned out that he\u2019s Andy\u2019s age, lives around the corner. And he says, \u201cI'll be right over.\u201d\nThat was at night. And I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t really have to come, but I wanted you to know it,\u201d\nbecause I was thinking then, that I would like to have some sort of a memorial service or\nsomething for him in Louisville. And he came over and he was visiting with us. And he really\ndidn\u2019t know, he knows my daughter and her husband, better than he did us. Because as I said,\nwe\u2019re not such a, that we go constantly to the synagogue. But I was terribly impressed with him.\nAnd he was so nice and he learned a lot about Andy\u2019s life, because we told him. We said we\nwould like to have a memorial service and we did, in the Temple. February 28. See, that was\nJanuary, but then we wanted... my daughter from Seattle came home. And Sandy has three\ncousins that, psychiatrist\u2019s kids, who were in Washington when I arrived. And we keep, you\nknow, in touch and they like us very much. Without us asking, they all wanted to come and I\nwas very touched by it and they did come with their families. And we had to get all that put\ntogether, so it was February twenty-eight. And it was in the newspaper and then it was in the\n33\nJewish Post, you know we have a community paper with the community center. And there must\nhave been over two hundred people at that. I don\u2019t even know, because I sat in the first row. I\nnever looked back. And the rabbi was... and we played some music, the kind of things that he\nliked. And it was like a string quartet of Schubert. The name of it is, \u201cThe Death of a Maiden,\u201d\nand I used to joke with him. I said, \u201cWhen I die, that\u2019s what I want them to play.\u201d And he liked\nit too, so we did that. And the rabbi was very nice, talked about us, talked about Andy, as much\nas he learned from us. He met him, actually, once, because my grandson had a Bar Mitzvah two\nyears ago. He\u2019s now 15, when he was 13 years old. And Andy came for that. And then the\nrabbi asked him to read something at that occasion. So, he met him. He knew he was in the\nwheelchair, but otherwise he didn\u2019t know that much about him except what we told him. That\nI\u2019m not angry... I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not that type, I think. I don\u2019t get really, I don\u2019t have many\npeople that I don\u2019t like or that I get angry with. I just accept things.",
        "A: Oh, a lot of times. The first time, I didn\u2019t want to go back, maybe ever. But in 1971, I decided I\ngo back. The first time a friend wanted to take me to the house where I was living up to the age\n12. It\u2019s... the houses in Europe are closed up, you know, the big doors and you can\u2019t see inside.\nSo, that person rang the doorbell and I was very reluctant to do this. And somebody came to the\ndoor and he says, \u201cWell this young lady lived in this house long time ago.\u201d They took me in. Of\ncourse, nothing was the way it was at the time, because in the meantime there was a war. There\nwere chicken and pigs, you know like. We had flower gardens then. But what I appreciated,\nthey wanted to know if I wanted to go inside and I said, \u201cNo thank you.\u201d I really didn\u2019t want to\ngo back, because it was just, I remember those years so much and I just didn\u2019t want to. And\nduring the communism, you know, they divided the house. That was a big house, so that house\nwas divided into about three or four different sections. I didn\u2019t want to go in. And then the next\ntime... that was in \u201871. Of course it, I mean the first time, it was really hard. I didn\u2019t want to run\ninto anybody who I used to know from olden time, but luckily they died. You know like, I\nwould have never wanted to run into a police official person, who was in charge of making us go\nto the ghetto. The Germans gave them the orders, but somebody had to carry it through. Well, I\nnever, never ran into them. I never saw anybody. Old friends of ours, who we really liked, we\nkept in touch with. And we had a very, very, very good friend... this year was really hard for us,\nnot only that Andy died. And we had a real good friend in Hungary, who was from our\nhometown, who was a musicologist. And all our trips we took in the last few years... we were in\nSpain and in Italy and in Sicily and in Greece, several times. We did that with that couple. He\nwas a few years younger. His name was George Kroo and we loved him and his wife and he\nloved us. And one day I got a phone call from his daughter that his father died, he had a heart\nattack, at work. So Sandy went to Hungary to his funeral. He was married to a non-Jewish girl,\nbut we loved them dearly. So, I never even want to go on any trips. And we had another good\nfriend in Washington, D.C., who was George\u2019s friend, our friend, he just died. And had cancer.\nI mean, it\u2019s just, about four people from our life, who were kind of close to us, they all died\nwithin one year.\n34",
        "A: I had a Hungarian friend, who was pretty neurotic and she was supposedly in Auschwitz maybe\nfor a month and then she was taken away. We didn\u2019t really talk too much about it, but I didn\u2019t\nhave really close contacts with people. Then I had another Jewish friend, she died too, in the\nmeantime, who survived the Nazism in Budapest. Hiding. And that\u2019s a different way of doing it\nthere, you know, that like the Anne Frank. So we once in a while talked about it, but we did not\ntalk about this like all the time. And I don\u2019t know how the other people, who now I see them\nonce a year, when we have this... either at the movie theater or at the Jewish Community...\nevery year it is somewhere else. Where they have the Shoah, July, no not in July. They usually\nhave it here, somehow in May. We had ours just not too long ago. And in Hungary they have\none, always, exactly the time when the ghetto was evacuated and taken away. Then in the\ncemetery they have a big... and I\u2019ve never been there at that time. And then people come from\nBudapest, people who lived in Hungary before, I mean in Eger before, who had relatives. They\nwould come to this. But, no I really don\u2019t have any contact with any of the other Holocaust\nsurvivors here.",
        "A: Well, yeah...",
        "A: ...yes, to me, yes it 1s.",
        "A: No, not that, it\u2019s for me, that\u2019s one way for me to remember my parents and my family. That\u2019s\none way, like some people light candles. Some people can go to a grave. In fact, when Andy\ndied, they cremated his body and it came back. And there was a question, how and where?\nThere is a beautiful cemetery here, it\u2019s Cave Hill Cemetery. And I didn\u2019t know that Jewish\npeople can be buried there. But it\u2019s a beautiful place. In Spring it is beautiful, in Fall it\u2019s\nbeautiful. There is a lake, a lot of sculptures all over. And it\u2019s just that people come and visit\nwithout visiting any graves. And I\u2019ve heard that Temple Shalom has a lot. When I heard that, I\nfigured, well Jews must be... and then I had some friends whose husbands are buried there. And\nwe decided we\u2019re going to do that. And Rabbi Miles... Robert by then wasn\u2019t home, but my\ndaughter, Elizabeth was here. And we went out to the cemetery and we did a private funeral for\nhim with Rabbi Miles. Then at that time he didn\u2019t have a marker yet, but then several months\nlater, not several months, maybe a couple of months later, I got a call from them. By the way,\nthe girl who is in charge of that cemetery, has been working there for twenty-five years and she\nis Jewish. She knew Rabbi Miles very much. She was very, very nice and helpful. And we\nordered a marker and that\u2019s there. Now, in fact, when Robert was home at Fourth of July\nweekend, we went out there, and he looked at it. And I\u2019m sure... my daughter is coming\ntomorrow for just ten days and we will go out and I took a picture of that marker. It says,\nAndrew Allen Klein, above it \u201cAndy\u201d and the date that he was born and the day that he died and\nthere is a little menorah.\n35",
        "A: That\u2019s why I wanted Andy to be here.",
        "A: Oh, well, if you\u2019re really interested in that, Sandy used to be the type of guy who would say, I\nwant my ashes in the parks and in the river. When this happened, we never talked to Andy about\nwhat he wants. We never thought that he\u2019s going to die before. The girl, I forgot her name now,\nat the cemetery says... she wasn\u2019t pressuring anybody, but she says, \u201cMany times people don\u2019t\nthink about it now, but later on suddenly they think they would like to be maybe near a dear one\nfrom the family. And then there is no place for it.\u201d\u201d, And she just thought she\u2019d mention. I kept\non thinking and thinking. And Sandy\u2019s sister was here at the time from Hungary. And I said to\nher, \u201cYou know I really would...\u201d I thought about it a lot. When we die, Linda and will the\nfamily just throw our ashes... I thought about this, but I never made a big deal about it. So I said\nto Sandy one day, \u201cYou know, I wouldn\u2019t mind to get two lots next to Andy\u2019s.\u201d And he didn\u2019t\nobject to it and we did that. So we have him and then two empty lots, which we paid for. And\nwe, of course, would like to be cremated. I mean a long time ago, I decided. So now I feel good,\nthat at least I know what our kids need to do with us.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And I thought, see, we went out on Andy\u2019s birthday for example. I mean I\u2019m not the type, who\nwould going out every week. But it gives me a comfort to know that he is here and he\u2019s close to\nus. And now that we decided to do this, and in fact Robert was kind of, almost funny... \u201cLet\u2019s\nall get a place.\u201d And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d but we do, and if they do that... I mean Sandy will\nbe eighty years old next year. Eventually we will die. I mean, we\u2019re in fairly good health. At\nleast it makes me feel good, first of all that we belong to a Temple, secondly that if our kids want\nto visit our graves, since we cannot. I don\u2019t know where my brothers are. I don\u2019t know where\nhis parents are. It does make me, give me a comfort. And I\u2019m not sure why, but it does. And\nI\u2019m glad that he agreed on this, because I thought he\u2019s going to give me a hard time. And then\nthe kids, what are they going to do with us? Throw our ashes all over the place? And I don\u2019t\nknow where my brothers are. I don\u2019t, I mean I know where my parents are, but we can\u2019t visit\nthem ever, and so, anyway.",
        "A: No. I never visited Auschwitz, but I did visit Dachau, one time when we were in Germany. He\nwanted to go and I went with him. We took the train. There were a bunch of people on the train,\nyoung students. And it did come up that I was there. And they asked me questions, but it\n36\nsomehow, again... I didn\u2019t cry there. It just was so manicured and it looked so different. And\nwe were in Austria, last summer, with an elder hostel group and there were hardly any Jews in\nthat group. But they had planned to go to Mauthausen. And we did that. And I saw there the\ngas chambers. Well of... it\u2019s hard for me to explain it. It\u2019s almost like that\u2019s not me. You\nknow, it\u2019s almost like I couldn\u2019t have been there. I mean I know I was, but I just, that\u2019s the way,\nmaybe, it\u2019s easier for me to deal with it. I just can\u2019t imagine how anybody can go through it and\nthen be here to talk about it. And I\u2019m not the only one, a lot of people who... and it was, you\nknow, the barracks, I peeked into some of the barracks. But, you know, I mean, it was so much\nworse than when I was there. I mean when I was there it was so horrible, that any of this thing\nnow, which is a museum, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s hard to imagine that people really were there. But that\nwas at the Dachau camp, where I went in. Some people, German people were sitting next to the\nentrance, in their houses with flowers and all. And I would walk by them and they looked maybe\nold. And I used to think at that time, I wonder what they knew. How much they knew? Did\nthey know what\u2019s going on in that camp? Stuff like that goes through my mind all the time, even\nnow. And Sandy gets very... if he runs into somebody who\u2019s old and maybe it would be a\nGerman, then he would never trust them. He would think he might have been a Nazi or\nwhatever, you know. So, you never can get that out of your system. But slowly we are getting\nolder and not that many people... and that\u2019s why I talk to many schools about this. And that\u2019s\nwhy I\u2019m doing this, too. That I think there ought to be a way of people to know what happened\nreally, after we die. Because there are not that many people left who survived it, slowly. I\u2019m\nseventy-seven years old and young people were killed. I\u2019m not saying in Theresienstadt or some\nof those places, because families were together. And a young person might live to be 90, and\nstill... but in Auschwitz there were no kids, not one.",
        "A: No. I... we went to see Schindler\u2019s List and I saw it a couple times. And then from the Temple,\npeople went. And somebody interviewed us, but there were some young people in the group and\none girl said that she visited... I think her grandparents might have been survivors. And she\nwent to visit some concentration camps and she was in Auschwitz. And I said, \u201cWhat did it look\nlike?\u201d And she says, \u201cIt has a souvenir shop, you can buy all these things.\u201d No, I really don\u2019t\nhave the desire to go. I see it on movies or on film. And it must look so different, you know? I\nremember the railroad tracks as we arrived. I remember that incident where Mengele was\nturning you, sending you to the right or the left. I remember the barracks at the time, but now\nit\u2019s probably, looks completely different.",
        "A: I can\u2019t accept... around the time, you know, when they took us away. No, well there is no place,\nyou know, really that I could. That\u2019s the reason that I didn\u2019t want that to happen to my children.\nThat they wouldn\u2019t have a place to go. I think about them. See, we were taken away June\ntwelfth or so, and I think about it a lot, but I do not talk about it. You know, many, many times.\nIt\u2019s just like with after Andy died. They did that beautiful music, and I have a tape of it, see,\nbecause we put it on tape. And I go down to my basement and I turn on that cassette when\n37\nnobody is there. And I re-hear it, and you know, then if I want to shed tears or cry over it, I do.\nBut I don\u2019t... I\u2019m never the type who does that very much in public.",
        "A: Maybe that\u2019s good, maybe it\u2019s bad. I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Well it came after, many years later. The very first time, I think I talked about it, that we were\ngoing to Cincinnati, to an art gallery, and Mary K. was with me and another friend. It was a two\nhour ride and somehow it came up and then I told them. When I used to walk with neighbors\nand friends and they have known me forever. So, years and years ago, we would walk for maybe\n45 minutes and one of my friends, not Jewish, asked me if I would talk about it. So, I said, \u201cPll\nbe glad to,\u201d and for many, many weeks that we would walk, we stopped at a certain point and\nthen they wanted to know the rest of it. So, by now it doesn\u2019t give me any problems to talk\nabout it. When some of the schools ask me, I did. I couldn\u2019t begin to tell you now how many\ntimes I did speak in schools. Once at the Catherine Spalding College, once at St. Andrews\nChurch and mainly then on Jewish situations, of course. And they might have a Jewish student\nthere or not. And now, I\u2019m completely at ease with myself and I can talk about it. Once ina\nwhile I kind of get a lump in my throat, you know, but I can do it.",
        "A: And I\u2019m glad that I can, because Sandy\u2019s sister, the one who is coming from Argentina now, she\ncompletely held it back all the time. So much that if the subject comes up, she just completely\nbursts out crying. She couldn\u2019t talk to her kids about it... they know... or to her grandchildren\nabout it. And her granddaughter said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you make a tape of it,\u201d because she was with\nme one year. Sylvia, she\u2019s now about twenty some years old. She told her grandmother, \u201cWhy\ndon\u2019t you make a tape of it? Maybe it would be easier for you.\u201d And everybody tells this to\neverybody, but it\u2019s not easy to do. I would have never just done it, if Mary K. wouldn\u2019t have\ninsisted.",
        "A: I, I, it\u2019s nice. Like, for example, I have a neighbor two houses down, who is from Vienna and\nwho left Vienna, they took all of her things away. And she ended up in Shanghai. I said, \u201cWhy\ndon\u2019t you tell your story?\u201d She can not. And all alone, unless somebody asks you, it\u2019s very hard\nto do that. But I\u2019m glad. I am glad that I did it. And I\u2019m glad that there is a record of it, maybe\nfor the future generation. I mean, I don\u2019t care whether I would have it or not, but... so, I think\nit\u2019s... and that\u2019s why they make such a big deal about that now. Of course, a lot of people go\nback with transports to Auschwitz, and so I don\u2019t have any desire to do that.\n38",
        "A: I like Louisville. I do like it and I don\u2019t. Wouldn\u2019t like to live any other place. I\u2019ve not been in\ntoo many places in the United States, but Louisville 1s a nice town. And we made a lot of\nfriends. Now that we\u2019re getting older we don\u2019t see them as much anymore. And luckily one\ndaughter lives here and the two grandchildren, you know. I have in fact, a little one will have a\nbirthday tomorrow. He\u2019ll be seven years old. And I\u2019m invited to go to a cave for the birthday\nparty. But I like it here. I mean I am satisfied and I wouldn\u2019t want to live any other place\nanymore...\nEnd of Tape 3, Side A\n39\nTape 3, Side B",
        "A: ...Democrats, okay? Now if when we were younger and we would get together and like let\u2019s see,\nduring some of the presidential elections, we would all get together and everybody was for that\nsame person. We used to think everybody, like long, long time ago, Stevenson was running and\nwe all liked him. Then he didn\u2019t make it and we were so surprised. So we don\u2019t have any, non-\nliberal friends, but you run into a lot of people like that. And that doesn\u2019t mean that we are not\nfriendly with them. But as we get older we don\u2019t really... I used to have parties and now when\nmy kids come home, we get together. Pll be pretty busy, so I\u2019m glad you came today. Cause\nfrom tomorrow on, I'll be kind of busy with my daughter and her 13-year-old is coming from\nSeattle. And they usually... my kids here come over. And I was just now in Nashville with\nRobert, so... excuse me, So...",
        "A: Yeah, I keep busy, and I...",
        "A: Well for a while, no, not really. We lived in the South end and we didn\u2019t, some people through\nhis work would come and look us up and so on. When we moved to this house, then we met\nmore and more people and they would invite us. But we\u2019re not the type that we congregate only\nthat they have to be Jewish. As I said, that thought, if anybody would be an anti-Semitic person,\nI would never want to have anything to do with them. But that\u2019s not the kind of friends we ever\nwould have. And after, you know, I got used to the idea and everybody knows we are Jewish, I\nmean it\u2019s not a problem anymore. And our kids, too, they have mixture of non-Jewish friends\nand Jewish friends. Now, my son, Robert, in Nashville, he married a Catholic girl. Now, he is\nthe least. He\u2019s the one who came with me to Los Angeles. And he said that he learned more\nabout Andy during that three hour memorial service than he ever knew, because he was just a\nlittle boy. And then he got away, Andy got away, you know, went to college and then he moved\nto Cal... so, I was very, very glad that he could come with me, that he wanted to come with me.\nAnd it made a very big impression on him. We got through music or through the universities or\nthrough work, that we made friends, you know, but it.... and some of them are Jewish, some of\nthem are not Jewish. So it\u2019s... we have some very, very good friends, who we still get together\nsometimes, have dinner out. He\u2019s almost ninety years old. And on their second marriage and\nthey\u2019re Jewish. So, it\u2019s not a matter that it has to be Jewish or not, but it has to be the same type\nof people.\nthe Louisville area, who maybe wouldn\u2019t have expected that even a Holocaust survivor lives in\nthe state?",
        "A: Well, there\u2019s some schools that I\u2019ve been speaking to, the teachers have been very, they\u2019re\nmostly non-Jewish people. A lot of them maybe half black, you know. And they prepare the\nkids, most of them. They had Holocaust pictures on the wall. They were studying it before they\nasked me. So they were somewhat, and then they would ask a lot of questions. And I did it once\nat Highland Junior High School. There were 150 kids in the group and all 150 wrote me a thank\nyou note about it. And I have all that. I have a box this full of all that kind of thing. They, one\nblack kid, for example, said, \u201cCan I touch you?\u201d I said, \u201cYes you can.\u201d And he said, \u201cAt least if\nsomebody would say sometimes that the Holocaust did not exist, because we talked about that, at\nleast I can say yes it did. Because I touched somebody who was part of it.\u201d So, it made me feel\ngood that they were thinking about that. And they hear once in a while stories where people\ndon\u2019t want to believe. And that\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m doing it, because it would very much\nbother me. And then, you know, I was very affected by this Yugoslavia problems, too, with this\nKosovo deal. Because it was so similar to what we have gone through. And there were... there\nagain, and I don\u2019t know how you feel about it, some people who hate our president and hate the\nDemocrats, would be very much against that he started this bombing and he started invading and\ngoing in. I had very mixed feelings toward the end, when the bombs kept on falling and maybe\ninnocent people were killed. That bothered me, but at the same time, I thought to myself, if\nanybody would have tried to do and stopped at least part of it. They would have bombed, let\u2019s\nsee, the railroad tracks, when the train was going to Auschwitz. Not necessarily mine, but\nhundreds and hundreds of them. It could have maybe stopped something. And nobody did\nanything. And therefore, because I feel that way so strongly, I was saying that they did the right\nthing. Although it\u2019s a very complicated situation and it\u2019s never going to be peace in that part of\nthe world. And even my friend, Ilus, we talked on the phone once and she was upset\u2014now that\nsurprised me\u2014over the bombing. And she was not, she didn\u2019t feel like I do.",
        "A: Kosovo. And she said, because she was from that part of the country, and she said something\nthat, those problems go back to eighteen whatever and there will be never peace. And Albanians\nand so on and so forth... that this is not going to help and the bombing just causes more, you\nknow, destruction and so on and so forth. And I was surprised by her saying that, because\nmaybe there will be never peace, but at least it showed something to the world. That\u2019s the way I\nfeel. That something like that has to be stopped. Whether they completely can stop it, you\nknow, one doesn\u2019t know. But I... it bothered me, the bombing. It bothered me, but then every\ntime I watched the news where people were happy that they were being helped, it made me feel\ngood. Because just some food given to them or the shelter or the whatever, what would we have\ngiven if somebody would have rescued us during the year. And what would those other people\nhave done, who were there for three years, if that could have been stopped? That\u2019s the way I\nfeel, whether that satisfies you or not.",
        "A: Yeah?\n4]",
        "A: My husband (laughing) wrote me the long letter, when he invited me to come. And since he\nloves music so much, he even said that he would like to have six children. Like he wanted like a\nquintet or whatever. And after four, I think, we decided that\u2019s plenty. But yes, I was, you know,\nkind of, not in a depressed mood, that I went always, you know I had certain kind of a fate, will\nbe the way it is. Like I believe more in fate. Like in Auschwitz, I never tried to, this would\nbetter or that would be better. Whatever has to happen, would happen to me. Yes, children we\nwanted to, but I\u2019m not going to tell you that we exactly had it when we planned it. Because then\nit would have taken a long time for us. Because he didn\u2019t have much money. I didn\u2019t. When do\nyou feel now you are ready to have children? That you really can afford it? So, I\u2019m glad just\nexactly the way it happened.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: No, no, no, no. I really am and I think that\u2019s what helped me through, if that\u2019s a possibility, plus\nluck. I mean you can feel this way and get sick or they can shoot you and then you can have a\nhard attitude, but if that didn\u2019t happen to you, then maybe that\u2019s the reason. And why I was like\nthat, I don\u2019t know. But from whatever I told you, maybe that\u2019s the conclusion you come to.",
        "A: No, except you poor soul, you\u2019re probably starving.",
