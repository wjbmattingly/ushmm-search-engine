        "Q: This is an interview with Abe, Abram Jakubowicz. It\u2019s July 14\", 1999. And this is part of a\ncollection of interviews with Holocaust survivors living in Kentucky, sponsored jointly by the\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Kentucky Oral History Commission. The\ninterviewer is Arwen Donahue. And for this interview we are going to not go over all of Mr.\nJakubowicz\u2019s experiences from his Holocaust and pre-Holocaust years, because he has already\nbeen interviewed by the Survivors of the Shoah Foundation. That interview was conducted on\nFebruary 19\", 1996. So, we\u2019re going to just briefly summarize what was said in that interview\nand ask some questions to fill in and then we\u2019re going to go on and explore his post-war life in\nmore detail. This is tape number one, side A. Okay, so, you tell me if I get any of the facts\nwrong and Ill tell you what I have written down from your Shoah Foundation interview. You\nwere born... hmm?",
        "A: I\u2019m listening.",
        "Q: Okay. You were born in Piotrkow, Poland on September 24, 1924. Grew up in Grodzisk,\nMazowiecki. Your grandfather Chaim Jakubowicz was the head of the Jewish community there.\nYou had one brother, Gershon, he was born in 1929. You mentioned that your parents worked,\nsay again what their work was?",
        "A: My grandfather from both sides, my grandmother, had shoe stores. But my father, he bought\nfrom the tannery, when they make the leather, one part is what makes leather, the other part is\nlike beady stuff. Doesn\u2019t smell good, you know it. They use it mostly for glycerin, Vaseline,\nchemical factories. So in any tannery, when they had enough that we could send in a truck, you\nknow it, so we could pick and give it to the tanneries. I don\u2019t know how I can explain it closer.",
        "Q: What was your mother\u2019s maiden name?",
        "A: Bluma, B L U M A and Hannah, Hannah was her middle name. Bluma Hannah.",
        "Q: And we got your father\u2019s name and her name on the other interview. Okay, now you mentioned\nthat you went to high school in Warsaw. Is that correct?",
        "A: I went to Warsaw and I went to Piotrkow. I went to Piotrkow first and I was away too much\nfrom my parents and I got homesick, so they took me back. They sent me from Grodzisk to\nWarsaw. And the gymnasium was not in [INAUDIBLE], it was... came out from the Jewish\nFederation, not Federation that time... the Gemennah (ph).",
        "Q: Were you in Warsaw when the war broke out in September, 1939?\n1",
        "A: We lived Grodzisk, but Warsaw is only about 30 kilometers, 20 miles from Warsaw. Now I\nknow, I found out they attached it to Warsaw, but at that time not.",
        "Q: Okay, so you were in Grodzisk.",
        "A: Grodzisk.",
        "Q: Grodzisk. And you were there, living through the various restrictions that happened, that came\nalong with the German occupation of Poland?",
        "A: Yeah, not quite, because the fifth of February, 1941, all the Jews had to leave Grodzisk, and we\nall had to go to the ghetto. And before this there was kind of restriction, but it wasn\u2019t that bad,\nyou know. You had to go to work, you had to do other things, but it was not too bad.",
        "Q: Can you, you did describe your, some general things about your experiences in the Warsaw\nghetto in your interview, in your prior interview. But I wondered if you would say something\nmore about it, in particular something about your living situation there. Where did you live and\nwith whom?",
        "A: We lived on Twarda (ph) 24\", Twarda 26, as far as I can remember now, was a corner from\nChepa (ph) and they called it the small ghetto. So, I went to school, when I went to school, I\nwent on the bus two streets away from the Twarda. You know. So I knew this very good, the\nsurrounding.",
        "Q: Who, what was your house like? And who did you live with?",
        "A: Okay, we got moved in and there was two young girls, approximately 18 and 20, and their\nparents went to Russia. You know, and they ran away and they couldn\u2019t get back or whatever it\nis, SO we lived with the girls in that flat, in that apartment. There was my grandfather, from my\nfather\u2019s side, my grandmother, and there was my father and mother and my brother, including\nme. We were the same. I can\u2019t recall was it two room or three rooms. I don\u2019t remember. It was\nthere on the second floor.",
        "Q: Was it a comfortable, living situation?",
        "A: It was not comfortable. It was, you know, you had to live. But comfort, in the ghetto, there was\nno such a thing. You know, but it was better than a lot of people, they got worse apartment.",
        "Q: I was asking because I know that so many people were so crowded and it sounded like you had a\nrelatively...",
        "A: Relatively we had, not bad, you know it, because it was second floor. It was only two girls, what\nthey lived before. So it was crowded, but it was not too bad. You could live, you know.",
        "Q: And you kept going to school.\n2",
        "A: Later on, since I went to the school before and there was only one school in the Natenzona (ph),\nyou know I told you it came from the Jewish, you know what they call it, the Jewish Federation,\nso they opened it. It was still open and I got a chance to go, yes, in the school.",
        "Q: This was the same... let me make sure I understand. This was the same school that you had gone\nto before?",
        "A: Exactly the same school I went before.",
        "Q: And it just ended up being within the ghetto?",
        "A: Yes, it was in the ghetto. And it was about two blocks, you know, where we lived from there, or\nthree blocks. So it was close. It was not too bad.",
        "Q: What was the name of the school?",
        "A: Natenzon (ph). And it was a technical school, if you want to be an engineer or something... as\nfar as I remember in Poland we had, I think it was in 1933, every student had to wear, I don\u2019t\nthink in the ghetto was, but before the war \u2014 it was on your arm, on the left hand side.",
        "Q: Did you have a goal of becoming an engineer at the time?",
        "A: Really, not, you know it. It\u2019s only for the while. It was close because I came from Piotrkow\nback. I couldn\u2019t stay, so they put me in there, more than to go in another high school. You\nknow, at that time, you still don\u2019t know what you want to be.",
        "Q: So you were, you also mentioned going to the movies and cultural life, I wondered if you\u2019d say a\nlittle bit more about that?",
        "A: In the ghetto? In the ghetto, yes, they had a lot of operettas. They had some movies and when\nyou had a little bit money, you know you could enjoy, do a lot of things with it. But we had to\nwatch out. I went out a lot with my mother and friends, we went to it, yes.",
        "Q: How did your family get money?",
        "A: We could bring certain things in. We rented a cart, with a horse and buggy and certain things we\nbrought in. And soon when we saw that it starts running out. We didn\u2019t know it would last so\nlong. And that was the reason why we later on, about three months, we left the Warsaw ghetto\nor it would mean starvation.",
        "Q: Okay, so you left the Warsaw ghetto after about three or four months...",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: ...when your family decided to separate and to escape.\n3",
        "A: That is right.",
        "Q: You and your mother and your brother went out of the ghetto together and then you met your\nfather there? Did your grandparents...?",
        "A: No, no. My grandparents stayed, from my father\u2019s side. But we went to Piotrk6w and you\nneeded, in order to escape if they caught you, you got shot. So, we thought we\u2019d split up and\nthen after a certain amount of time, I don\u2019t know exactly how long, my father joined us. He\nescaped the same way, you know it, and joined us in Piotrkow, because there is where my\ngrandmother from my mother\u2019s side lived.",
        "Q: And what was her name? Your grandmother?",
        "A: Zudla Ritterband, RIT TERBAN D or sometimes I see now, Riterband with one T and one\nwith two T\u2019s, so I don\u2019t know, I get confused.",
        "Q: And so you lived in the ghetto in Piotrko\u00e9w...",
        "A: Yeah, from there we escaped the Piotrkow ghetto.",
        "Q: And your father worked in a glass factory there.",
        "A: That is right.",
        "Q: And you worked for a company that made office furniture for the German army.",
        "A: That is right. Aus Deutsche Republic (ph).",
        "Q: Did your brother work? Gershon?",
        "A: He was too young. He was born in 1929, though and I was born \u201824. No, he did not, because in\n1941, he was only 12 years old.",
        "Q: Did you have... were you and Gershon very close?",
        "A: Yes, we were very close. It was a close family.",
        "Q: I wondered, just speaking of your family, I want to back track a little bit, because I had wanted to\nask you, you mentioned that your grandfather was the head of the Jewish community.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, he had a shoe store.",
        "Q: Would you say something about your family history? Was there a long tradition of leadership in\nthe Jewish community?\n4",
        "A: Yes. About the Jewish community. My father was only one son, but yes, every certain amount\nthere was always election. And they elected who they wanted to represent them. And he was\nalways involved in politics about the Jewish people, you know it. So he always, as far as I can\nremember, always was elected.",
        "Q: Your grandfather?",
        "A: My grandfather. And he had a shoe store, but mostly it was run, and years ago, it sounds funny,\nthe women ran the store. And they were doing a good job. So mostly Jewish men of that time,\nsay they divided their time, mostly. But for a lot of them, for the community... or they went to\nthe, they studied the Torah. And he was in that time, fairly religious.",
        "Q: Had your family been in that area of Poland, in Grodzisk, for a long time?",
        "A: My mother was from Piotrkow. And as far as I know it, my grandmother from my father\u2019s side\nwas from Piotrkow. And at that time, marriages was made in matchmaking marriages. So, since\nshe came... she was highly intelligent and her father was dead, so you know it, at that time years\nago with a dowry, you know. They didn\u2019t care, they were fairly off, they wanted somebody\nhighly intelligent in their family. I don\u2019t know, now it doesn\u2019t make sense, but that\u2019s the way\nwhat it worked.",
        "Q: Yeah, I understand. So then on October 13\", 1942, the ghetto was encircled. And it was\nliquidated within one week.",
        "A: That is right.",
        "Q: And then the 2,000 people who worked in the glass factory were allowed to stay.",
        "A: Yeah, because the factory didn\u2019t let them out. And then they made staravarshaska (ph), we\ncalled it the yiden (ph) gas. And on the other side was the gun, staravarshaska. I remember.\nThere was only one block, a big block, where they made wires, you know, where you couldn\u2019t\ngo. And then they brought them back. When everybody, everything was liquidated.",
        "Q: And your father was working in the glass factory, so he was allowed to, he was allowed to stay.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, there was a few of them. There was Hortensia (ph) and one was Kara (ph). He\nworked with Kara. They made glass and it was, in that time it was a war, so they put pieces of\nmetal in it. If the bomb fell, they didn\u2019t split any, it got... you know, so...",
        "Q: Your mother had the foresight to volunteer you as a carpenter.",
        "A: When we came to go away, you know, there is no volunteers. They ask, \u201cWho is a carpenter?\u201d\nSo, my mother said, \u201cHe 1s a carpenter.\u201d And I had a piece of paper that I could leave the ghetto,\nbefore it, in order to go to my work. She said, \u201cHe\u2019s a carpenter.\u201d So, this way they didn\u2019t ask\nquestions, just pulled me out. And I went as a carpenter. What was the carpenter work? It\u2019s to\nmake shelves in one of the buildings, Kompu-Stego (ph). And they bring from the old houses,\n5\nyou know it was about 20,000 people, 21,000 Jewish people. So they emptied everything and\nlater on they shipped it to Germany.",
        "Q: And you saw your father occasionally, but did not live with him?",
        "A: No, I couldn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Right. About two months, two or three months later, it was decided that about 1,000 more Jews\nwould be deported.",
        "A: Were liquidated, not deported. In fact there is now a monument, maybe you saw it, where they, I\ndon\u2019t know, six, 700 people, they got killed. They took all the people in the synagogue, you\nknow a lot of the kids, they got shot inside. It was really bad circumstances. You cannot\ndescribe it. After two or three days, you know, the screaming, they took us out and we were\nsupposed to be shot. And when they took me out, happened to be a gendarme, you know, a\npolice man, a German police man, whom I happened to work with. He says, \u201cHey, what are you\ndoing here?\u201d Like I volunteered. Kicked me out of it. You know, he would say, \u201cYou don\u2019t\nbelong here.\u201d",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you about that particular moment, because it was striking to me that this\ngendarme saved your life. Do you think he intended to save your life?",
        "A: He intended, yeah, because, a lot of the Germans, they go, \u201cWhat you doing?\u201d And he saw that I\nhad a job. See? Most of them, they were hiding out and they had no jobs and there was a lot of\nchildren. But he knew that I worked there. Not because he wanted to save my life, no. I didn\u2019t\nknow him so much. But he only knew that I worked for him.",
        "Q: So, you didn\u2019t have a personal relationship with him?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t know this guy at all. But I remember his name, Meister Poltin. Yeah, he was a stiff\nman, was an older man, in fact, a day before, two days before, he shot a little girl. She was 17,\n18 years, because he thought that she stole a pair of stockings, you know, when they put these\nthings in. He shot her, so... no, he did not know.",
        "Q: So, he was certainly not sympathetic...",
        "A: No, no. I didn\u2019t know him, no.",
        "Q: How did you feel at that point about the Germans in general? Were you getting a sense of what\nit was that they were capable of? The depths of...?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I knew. You know this didn\u2019t come overnight. When you saw it all the time, you\nknow what they did. And then when I was on the...when they took the people to Treblinka.\nAnd when somebody didn\u2019t go fast, they shot him. When an older woman couldn\u2019t move, they\nshot her. You saw literally corpses everywhere. You knew it. Despite what my parents,\nespecially my mother tried to keep me sheltered, but I knew it, you know. You cannot close...\n6\notherwise I wouldn\u2019t be normal. Yes, we knew it. In fact, a few days before they took\nTomaszow, they took already one. And they said to put him to death, put him to Treblinka. We\ncould still not believe it. Why would they take people and put them to death? So it didn\u2019t make\nany... you always, as long as you live, you have a little bit of hope that the people are lying. But\ndeep inside we knew it, yeah.",
        "Q: At that point, what did you know about Treblinka? Did you know...?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know it even existed. They only said they go in a place and I didn\u2019t know it was\nTreblinka. A place where the people get gassed. I didn\u2019t even know what place.",
        "Q: But you had heard that there was a extermination...?",
        "A: Yes, there was an extermination camp. That\u2019s right. It takes people, and you know they bring\nthem there... how or what, its only main purpose to liquidate the people. A liquidation camp,\nyou know.",
        "Q: So, your mother and your brother had already been taken at that point, to Treblinka.",
        "A: Yeah, that was... you know, the date when they pulled me out, they went already there.",
        "Q: Did you know at that point, were you certain at that point that they had been killed? Or was\nthere a question in your mind that they might still be alive?",
        "A: It\u2019s always a question in your mind, but you know, certain things in life you know it 1s. It\u2019s\neasier to believe things what you would like to believe, even when we were there, we say, \u201cThey\ncouldn\u2019t do it. They didn\u2019t do nothing. What do you want to take so many people and kill them\nat the same time?\u201d You know? But it was true. But I didn\u2019t know. I knew it and I didn\u2019t know\nit, you know, because I wasn\u2019t there. But people talked about tt.",
        "Q: After this gendarme took you...",
        "A: Meister Poltin (ph), yeah.",
        "Q: ...took you out of the group, then you said in your testimony that the other 900 or so people who\nhad been gathered, were taken away.",
        "A: Eight or nine, later now I see it\u2019s seven you know it, because some of them got killed in there,\ninside and I didn\u2019t count them. You know I knew it was a lot. I did not know that they got shot.",
        "Q: Oh, you didn\u2019t? At that time?",
        "A: No, later on, when I came and they... we knew that they took them. Rakhov was a little bitty\nforest and they shot them.",
        "Q: So, you found that out. Did you find that out after the war? Or..?\n7",
        "A: No, right away when I was in the ghetto back. Because they always took other Jews to cover the\ngraves and everything. The Germans didn\u2019t do this, so they took somebody to do it.",
        "Q: So, the word spread fast.",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",
        "Q: You mentioned something I wanted to hear more about. That the role of the Jewish police in\nthis. Can you say more about that?",
        "A: Jewish police was not angels. When they put me in the synagogue, the Germans didn\u2019t put me\nin, the Jewish police. The Germans probably told them we needed so many to put in and catch\neveryone. So, they did the dirty work for the Germans. It\u2019s like anything else, somebody wants\nto be very good and is a hundred percent, when they ask you. One thing you want to do ten\npercent better. Okay? And certain people, it is a matter of survival, they have to do what they\nhave to do. But they didn\u2019t do more. But certain people were bad. Jewish or not Jewish.\nMaybe they thought only this way they can survive. I don\u2019t know it. Certain people couldn\u2019t do\nit. You know?",
        "Q: Going on with the summary. After a few days, you were among 20 boys and 20 girls who were\nsent to Tomaszow.",
        "A: Tomaszow Mazowiecki.",
        "Q: Mazowiecki. You were there a few weeks.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: What were you doing there?",
        "A: Same thing what we did, what we did in PiotrkOw. We made shelving. Collected everything and\nthen we brought it to PiotrkOw. They called it sammische, sammische stellen (ph). That means\nthey brought everything together and they shipped it to Germany. When this was finished, they\ndidn\u2019t know what to do with us. Luckily for us, they sent us to Starachowice.",
        "Q: Where you made ammunition for the Germany military.",
        "A: That is right. As I said, called it Hermann Goering werk (ph). There was already a big factory.\nBut, I guess so, probably we did a good job. And then to be truthful, I think at that time, we was\nwatched by guys, other viklestande (ph) division. They were not so hateful, you know it. They\nwere young and we were young, so we talked. They weren\u2019t about to kill you. Maybe they put\nina good word. I don\u2019t know it, but anyway they took... because 40 people doesn\u2019t mean\nnothing... so we went to Starachowice from there.",
        "Q: So, is this right? That was around June or July of 1943?\n8",
        "A: That\u2019s right. Wait a minute, 1943? Yeah.",
        "Q: Tell me some more about your time in Starachowice. You didn\u2019t tell very much about that in the\nfirst interview.",
        "A: Starachowice was a big ammunition factory. They made 1.5 though 15 millimeter... they made\n8.8 millimeter and 7.5 millimeter. From the beginning I worked there, where you know, before\nyou put it in the press. There is a hydraulic press. You have to make it very, very hot, so the\nhydraulic press can press it out, you know.",
        "Q: Press out bullets?",
        "A: Yeah, they pressed out only the shell. The bullets come later on, you know. But this was the\nshell what they made. Oh, they get cleaned and all kinds of things they would get. So, I worked\nthere and it was very hard and very hot. Luckily for me, I met a guy, his name was Chaim\nEnischmann (ph). And his brother was from the Jews, the head of the Jews. You know, that the\nGerman told him... you know it...",
        "Q: In Starachowice...?",
        "A: Yeah, and this Chaim Enischmann, I didn\u2019t know it before, he... and there was four other boys.\nThere was five boys and he by risking his own life, he brought us always food in the evening.\nYou know it. Ironically, he never survived. Was a very, very good person. Only one from the\nfive boys, no, two. Is me and there was another guy. Heniek... I tried to remember his name,\nbut I can\u2019t. I saw him after the war. He went to Frankfurt and to college. He was surprised that\nI didn\u2019t go to college. But stupid Abe got married. (Laughing.)",
        "Q: How did you find out what happened to Chaim Enischmann?",
        "A: Chaim, what\u2019s his name, from him, from the other guy, he was with him together. Enischmann.",
        "Q: Say his name again?",
        "A: Chaim Enischmann.",
        "Q: Enischmann.",
        "A: Because his brother, had from the camp, from the Jewish side. And he worked, his brother\nworked in the kitchen. You know the older, when we came home, he made sure that we got\nsomething.",
        "Q: Why this... five particular boys? Did he chose you out or were you part of a group?",
        "A: Yeah, no, we slept together, you know when you go up on the benches and you sleep. Some of\nus slept together. And you know sometimes a chemistry from a person to a person. He didn\u2019t\n9\nwant nothing in return. He just wanted to help. He knew he cannot help more. He can\u2019t help\neverybody. The other four boys, probably he knew them from before, they already were from\nthere. And somehow he said, you know, \u201cI'll help you do whatever I can.\u201d In life, what I found\nout everywhere, you need a little bit luck, but other people will help you. You have to be in the\nright spot. And he just, you can say, it\u2019s God\u2019s will or not, if you are religious. And he really\nhelped me, you know, there.",
        "Q: Speaking of religion, was religion a really important part of your life, up until that point?",
        "A: Religion was a very big point until 1939. You know, I was not... my father... you saw the\npictures from my grandfather, you know, he was religious. He had a beard, he had the traditional\nthing. My father, not more. But we went Saturdays to the synagogue. We ate kosher. You\nknow what kosher is? We Jewish people separate the milk from the, you know, you have to wait\nwhen you eat meat six hours after it. It\u2019s one way of hygiene or something. We did this. That\nwas... I knew what I was. Like some people maybe they would die for it. And if somebody\nwere to tell me, Abe, if tomorrow you are a Christian and you live, I would chose either side.\nYou know, it\u2019s like, you know, always like in Spain, when you had....\nEnd of Tape 1, Side A\n10\nTape 1, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape one, side B of an interview with Abe Jakubowicz. You were saying about religion...",
        "A: Yeah, until then, you know, it did not, I knew where I belonged. I like to help the people,\nbecause I know what this is. But it was not later on, the main. I suffered because of it, but it was\nnot my main thing, you know.",
        "Q: You mentioned that when the war started, that changed. Did your feelings about religion, about\nGod change?",
        "A: No, what had changed is that you couldn\u2019t go in the Synagogue no more. Because they caught\nyou, you know, they shoot you or they shot you or they did something to you or they beat you up\nif you was lucky. So, we were scared. So... it did not change. I believed certain... if you ask\nme now, I think God is for everybody. There is no such a thing about being closer or not. We\u2019re\nhaving to live together and if you try to separate yourself, you end up like in Yugoslavia. Can\u2019t\ndo it. There\u2019s not a Jewish God, there\u2019s not a Catholic God. It\u2019s a God, you know.",
        "Q: Did you think about, I mean at this point, when the war is well underway... at the time you were\nin Starachowice, you were separated from your entire family. You didn\u2019t know whether they\nwere alive. Did you feel, did you think at all about your spirituality, your relationship with...",
        "A: Number one at that time, is survival. You want to survive, regardless. You want to survive.\nYou ask yourself, \u201cWhy me, oh Lord?\u201d You know. But you want to survive, you know it, that\u2019s\nall what it is. Like an animal, we become simply like animals, you want to survive. Only certain\npeople would do more to survive and certain people would do less, something different, but we\nall want to survive.",
        "Q: So, there wasn\u2019t the time or the experience for that kind of questioning?",
        "A: No, we did not, no, there was not.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you want to say about Starachowice?",
        "A: In Starachowice, when we saw the Russians came too close, and there was already a train\nstanding. We did not know where we are going. We thought we all will be liquidated. So, we\nsaw a lot of them, maybe 50 people. So that... and we run always, you know, a place, and we\nrun away. I... some they went with machine guns. A lot of them got caught. I happened to be,\nbut I didn\u2019t get shot by the machine gun. And being there one night, two nights, you need to eat,\nyou have to get something. There was very big forest they called Lasisvindikshe (ph), very big\nforest. And then I came, I saw a hut standing there. And I thought \u201cOkay, I'll try,\u201d and I go in.\nAnd when the guy saw me, he said, \u201cHey,\u201d he said, \u201cJew. You\u2019re a, you know, really, you\u2019re a\nJew.\u201d \u201cWait a minute, because when the Germans come they will shoot me.\u201d But he went on\nthe street and he saw the German police. But this is military police, you know, they directed\nalready, you know it... brought \u2018em in. So Abe, now you\u2019re at the end of it. He says, \u201cOkay,\n11\nwhere did you run away?\u201d Listen, he didn\u2019t know it. I said, \u201cI was in this camp, and we all, we\nget, you know...\u201d He says, \u201cIt\u2019s good. I will take you there back.\u201d",
        "Q: Tell me again who this was? What nationality this person was?",
        "A: Pole. He was a Roman Catholic, or whatever it is, but not Jewish. And I went to the... so, they\ntook me in to... and luckily I told you this Enischmann. All day he talked... he says, \u201cOkay,\nwe're going now to...\u201d\u201d He knew already we\u2019re going now to Auschwitz. \u201cWhy now do you\nwant to shoot him? We take him with us.\u201d And then I went to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: So, you were deported with Enischmann and the five other boys?",
        "A: Yeah. But I was not with them. This is his process. I don\u2019t know what car they went, but we all\nwent to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: So when you were deported from Starachowice to Auschwitz, you weren\u2019t necessarily with\npeople that you knew and were close with?",
        "A: No, you just, you are a number. You are not... it was maybe a hundred people in a train. You\nknow, maybe you thought you were... And they\u2019d say, \u201cGet out, get! Get! Get!\u201d You know, so\nyou were scared. No, I could not see him anymore in Auschwitz, either. Somehow I got away\nfrom them.",
        "Q: When you look back on that time, to me something that really is striking 1s that you had been... I\nget the impression you were such a close-knit family and your family was all depending on each\nother and counting on each other. And all of a sudden, you are thrust, you\u2019re just thrust into this\nindependent and solitary....",
        "A: Then it takes over something else. You want to survive to tell it to the other people. I didn\u2019t\ncare to survive, but they would tell me, \u201cListen Abe, you will survive.\u201d For one year, until it was\nfine. That such an atrocity happened. I owed it to my parents. I owed it to... it takes over in\nyour body, the will to survive. And if you have to crawl, if you have to eat something, you have\nto do it, you will do it. And when you are younger, you got a better chance. Say you stood\nnear... if they want to shoot somebody, it was you, it was you. There was not anymore... you\nknow. Sometimes it\u2019s luck, too.",
        "Q: Uh huh. But it was almost, it was as if this whole different person, you became a whole different\nperson.",
        "A: A whole, completely different person. But later on, it\u2019s a funny thing, when I was liberated, I\nwas the same me, you know.",
        "Q: So you left Starachowice, according to what you said before, around March 1944, as a ballpark\nguess of when you left. And then...\n12",
        "A: \u201844, that\u2019s right. Because when the Russians came closer... yeah, it\u2019s a ballpark. I don\u2019t even\nknow it, but it\u2019s probably, it is. It\u2019s probably in the ballpark.",
        "Q: And you described your journey and you described arriving in Auschwitz and being taken to the\nGypsy lager.",
        "A: Gypsy camp. They did not make selections, because they saw all these people worked and they\nneeded at that time, they needed workers. And a lot of Hungarian Jews came in that time and\nmostly they put them in D camp. So, since they didn\u2019t have any place, they put us for a while in\nthe Gypsy camp.",
        "Q: Did you have any interactions at all with the gypsy families that were there?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Can you describe what kinds of interactions you had?",
        "A: You went out and you saw there was whole families living, you know it, and they had a curtain,\nnot a curtain, just a blanket, you know it. And here was this family, there was that family and\nthat was as far as the interaction. Because being there a few days, they liquidated all the gypsies\nin that camp. At night you hear the cars, you know, going back and forth, trucks taking them to\nthe crematory. But it was three days and I came over to the family and everything is fine.",
        "Q: Had you known at that point that the Nazis were exterminating other groups than the Jews?",
        "A: Oh yeah, sure. Yeah, we knew it. I knew if you wasn\u2019t their way, they exterminate you. But I\ndidn\u2019t know before that they took the Gypsies. You know, only when I was in Auschwitz, I saw\nthat they disappeared. I knew where they went.",
        "Q: Did the Jews in the lager and the Gypsies generally interact with one another? Talk to one\nanother?",
        "A: We spoke, yeah, we spoke, but that is it, as far as it went. In the first few days, we were in\nquarantine. We didn\u2019t go to work. We stayed there. You were afraid to go far. They catch\nyou....But yes, you get to talk to some of them. They said their son is on the front, works for the\nGermans, makes ditches, you know.",
        "Q: And then you described how you started working with the Canada commando. And I wondered\nhow it was that you got that position, because that was a somewhat coveted position.",
        "A: No, nobody wanted it, nobody wanted it. Usually when you stand, you know, I worked that time\nbefore I worked in katowe bunker (ph), you know, where the potatoes was. And you had to,\nthere was two people, one in front and one in the back and then they filled it up. You lift it up\nand you go to other place, you know, and filled it, put it in there. Because mostly when they\ncame with the railroads, they dumped it. And I knew one thing, there was always selection going\non. There was selection to go in the crematoria if you didn\u2019t look good or if they didn\u2019t like you.\n13\nSo, you always watched out. Your eyes went the right way. Somehow I missed him. He was\nstanding in front of me. And he said, write down here the number. You know, my number what\nI got right here on my hand. He wrote it down and they called me out. I didn\u2019t know where\nwe'll go. You know, nobody wanted to work in two different places. Sonderkommando, where\nwhat the people burned them, you know it. And Canada, where you take the clothes. You told\nthem, \u201cOh you will live, and it\u2019s nothing,\u201d whole kind of thing, \u201cTake off, when you come out,\nyou will find it.\u201d You know, we had to take it away, and they sold it. But this meant a certain\ndeath, too. Say, sonderkommando maybe three months, the other one may be six months.",
        "Q: Well, it\u2019s interesting to hear you say that nobody wanted it, because I\u2019ve heard other people say\nthat it was, that they would try to get a position, because you would have advantages of clothing\nand food and so forth.",
        "A: Now, you had advantages, but you didn\u2019t want to, because you knew that you would be dead,\ntoo. And you always have that little hope, you know? They did not, they picked you, you didn\u2019t\npick them. They picked me out. And I said, \u201cOh,\u201d you know it. No, I didn\u2019t like it. I had a\nlittle bit of food, but then I had to watch out. Somebody would see me shoving it down my\nmouth, they would kill me, and all these things. But in a way, this food helped, but I didn\u2019t want\nto, no. So I was in Canada. It\u2019s like nobody wanted for the Sonderkommando.",
        "Q: Did you have friends in Auschwitz?",
        "A: Friends what I knew only, I met them in the camp, but nothing else. Friends, but I slept with\nthem, but no, you did not have friends. You didn\u2019t have nothing. What binded with them, they\nall had a miserable life, but that was it. No, I did not have nobody. Some brothers stayed\ntogether, or even high management maybe stayed . I did not. Somehow I, I got\naway somehow.",
        "Q: Okay, back to the summary. Something that you mentioned in the first interview that I wanted to\nask you a little bit more about... you mentioned that God was watching over you. Did you feel\nthat at the time that God was watching over you?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: No, I felt later on when I saw all the deaths, that he was watching over me. In fact, the opposite.\nI always ask, you know, \u201cWhy me, oh Lord?\u201d You know, to have suffered. And a lot of people,\nyou know, they was weak, they grabbed the electric wire. If I had guts I would have done it, but\nI have no guts to doit. But no, no. Later when I see so many dead, I say probably God was\nwatching over me. This is what saying about God.",
        "Q: So, about September 1944 you were shipped to Oranienburg-Sachsenhausen.\n14",
        "A: That is right. And there we stayed about two weeks, I think. And that was a quarantine, you\nknow, it was near Berlin. In fact, we saw, you know, we were in a station in Berlin and there\nwas bombing, all things. It was already going, you know, everything going strong.",
        "Q: And I was a little confused about what happened next. I heard something... either you went to\nOhrdruf or you went to Krauwinkle (ph)?",
        "A: At first we went to Krauwinkle. Krauwinkle was a little small place, you know it? But then we\nhad to build this big place for all the people to come, because we built the tunnels, you know, in\nthe mountains. So Krauwinkle was, yes, Krauwinkle was a very, very small place.",
        "Q: How long did you stay there?",
        "A: It all went fast, about a week, two. I remember it was so cold in the mountains, you know. I\nremember we had to go so far, to the mountains, to drill and do this here. In fact, at times they\ndidn\u2019t have a lot of SS guarding us \u2014 it was a volkstrom (ph), was an old man. Almost as old as\nme. And they guarded us.",
        "Q: And did you do something, taking care of a dog?",
        "A: Yeah, when I was, late in... was it Ohrdruf or was it Krauwinkle? I had an SS guy ask me to\ntake care, really it was not to take care of the dog. Really it was to make chopped wood for his\nwife, if she wanted something to do, you know it. But beside there was a German Shepherd, he\ntold me to, you know, feed him too, and this was just caring for the dog. So he gave me\npermission to go in the SS kitchen, you know and pick up all the bones. But everything was\nedible, so you can imagine. I always got beat over by the dog. He gives him so much food, and\nhe\u2019s so skinny. . (laughing)",
        "Q: But you got a little bit of extra food by doing that?",
        "A: Yeah, you got always a little. Not from him... the food what I got in the SS kitchen that I could\nsteal. Nobody gave you anything extra, you know. Extra you had to take. Was it in Krauwinkle?\nYou see he picked them... you know, in that time they told me, if you let yourself go, you don\u2019t\nwash yourself, you go down very fast. And I didn\u2019t want to go down fast. And also our hopes\nfor the war, it\u2019s winding down. I only thought they would shoot us before... you know it. So,\nprobably I was maybe cleaner like near the time. You know he said that I should take care...\nyou know, for his wife, and other things.",
        "Q: So, you found ways to wash yourself through that time?",
        "A: Yeah, you go and, washings, you know, it was cold, but they want you to wash yourself, you\nknow it. So, what I did, I did. The other ones were afraid, you know, it\u2019s cold, they didn\u2019t want\nto, not all of them, ninety percent washed. It\u2019s only when your mind goes down, your body goes\nwith it. Your feet start swelling and you give up. You can know it. So in that time I didn\u2019t give\nup yet.\n15",
        "Q: When you were in Auschwitz and the other camps before...?",
        "A: I still tried to maintain, you know, as much as I could to be clean, because otherwise they would\nput you in the selection, to the crematoria.",
        "Q: How did you... was it difficult when you were in Auschwitz to obtain water to clean?",
        "A: No, no, no. We got, there was a shower, only you went in, you know, you were supposed to\nwash a little bit. It was not difficult. In fact they didn\u2019t want any sicknesses to break out either.\nThey cut your hair, pick lice all around your arm. No, I could wash, it was not that hard to\nshower, but they took us so we could wash ourselves.",
        "Q: After you arrived in Ohrdruf, you started to build a camp, build the camp?",
        "A: That\u2019s right, we started building the camp. The camp to Treblinka, no to Krauwinkle, we went\nand built the camp. And then they moved us over into the...",
        "Q: And then you described that, your time in Ohrdruf in the first interview. And then in February\n1945, around, around then, you set out on a death march towards Buchenwald.",
        "A: That is right. The Americans came closer, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And you talked about how you thought you would die before you arrived in Buchenwald.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And the Dutch prisoners, Jewish prisoners helped you.",
        "A: I assumed it was Jewish prisoners, maybe not. It was Dutch people. I knew that they spoke\nDutch. And they dragged me in to Buchenwald.",
        "Q: It\u2019s kind of remarkable how there were certain key points where people, people were there for\nyou.",
        "A: It was, if they could help me, I was too. Lot of times I was younger than an older man, if there\nwas something to do, I tried to do it, too. You tried, you know? You didn\u2019t lose your humanity,\nyou got a sense of survival, but if you knew it\u2019s a danger, you stayed away. But if you could\nhelp somebody you were there. Because I was, when I was in Ohrdruf, we went, there\u2019s a city\ncalled Arnstadt and we had to make ditches, because they laid cables. And there happened to be\na Jewish guy, much older, and he told me he was head of one of the Jewish bigger newspaper\nfrom Heit (ph). He told me, you know, and we talked and I tried to help him as much as I could.\nWhenever there is an older person with who his work was pen and pencil, wasn\u2019t as good at\nditch digging, you know, to dig the ditches. You know, and I was a young kid, and you learn.\nNot that I was better, but I tried to learn much better than an older person.\n16",
        "Q: Did you, you talked in the first interview about being in Buchenwald and recovering and about\nhow at first you were 1n a horrible place, and then you walked out of there.",
        "A: That is right. When they brought me to Buchenwald, they dumped everybody. No shower, no\nkind of thing. This guy came to me, this Kapo and he said, \u201cWhat you got? You got diarrhea?\nYou got stomach, you cannot control your bowel movement?\u201d I say, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s fine.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cGo in here.\u201d There was a place about five and I got on top, got the place he told me to lay\ndown...",
        "Q: Five bunks?",
        "A: Ya, ya, so I was there, but I thought, my gosh, if I have to survive. Here\u2019s a death, here\u2019s a\ndeath, smells horrible. And I went down and I told the guy, \u201cHey listen, I\u2019m nice and clean, but I\ndon\u2019t really do such things.\u201d In the meantime always when, simples Juden ein treiden (ph), all\nthe Jews should go because they put them on march. I said, \u201cMy gosh, I cannot go, they have to\nshoot me, let them shoot me here.\u201d And I ignored it. And they needed a few clean people. They\nhad a small place where girls worked and they needed a few cleaners, because they wanted to\nkeep for the SS some woman, you know? So they put me in there and I was liberated there.\nThat place was a little bit cleaner.",
        "Q: What were the nationalities of the women who were kept there?",
        "A: Oh, this was prisoners, but mostly they spoke German. But they was prisoners. But they keep\nthem, you know, as nurses for the people that worked there. But this was only to pretend, to\nshow, you know, it was not...",
        "Q: It was a kind of brothel, you mentioned.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, part of a brothel.",
        "Q: And how did they, can you say how business was undertaken?",
        "A: No, I was there in that time. I was really sick. Then Americans they say they come. And they\nprobably went, whatever it is. I don\u2019t know it. I would have had to invent it, but I don\u2019t know it.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know whether they were forced into the...",
        "A: They were forced, ya, surely, yes they were forced.",
        "Q: At that time, you, were you so sick it was hard for you to even get up? Or how...?",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t get up. I could really not... I was, when I came into Buchenwald I had already\ndiarrhea by myself. I had to run. And after a while if you have nothing behind, you get weaker\nand weaker. But I was... in fact after the liberation it took about six weeks, six months, until I\ncould learn to walk again. So, when the Americans came, I couldn\u2019t walk. They told me that the\nAmericans are there, but I... And there were two Polish guys with me. Got still some pictures\n17\nfrom them. They brought me a little bit food, they brought me that, you know it? They could\nmove better than I could. I couldn\u2019t move.",
        "Q: Do you remember when the Americans came into the camp?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I remember, it was, you know it. But that was the eleventh of April. But probably a\nlittle bit later, but then you saw the people came and took pictures. You know, ironically today, I\nwent out with a guy on Shoah, he spoke as a liberator. And he came to Buchenwald one day\nlater that it was liberated. He\u2019s Mr. Knight, his son happened to be an opthamologist.",
        "Q: You went out with him today?",
        "A: Yeah, I went out today. He\u2019s 81 years, with his wife. And we went out to eat something. I say,\n\u201cHey you liberate me, I go and meet.\u201d",
        "Q: Have you been in regular contact with him?",
        "A: I met him only... no, I met him when I went first time to Shoah. And he spoke how they\nliberated Buchenwald. And then I went to him. I say, \u201cHey, I was one what you liberated.\u201d So,\nI give him my telephone number and he gives me his telephone number. So, we happened to go\nout today.",
        "Q: So when you say you went to Shoah, what do you mean?",
        "A: Once in a year, it\u2019s a memorial for the Holocaust survivors.!",
        "Q: Here in Louisville?",
        "A: In Louisville, 1t\u2019s everywhere. And the last few times, he\u2019s always picked me, but you cannot\nalways pick the next, the same person to speak. First you hear it, and then it gets like old coffee.\nSo, last time, I didn\u2019t, they did it differently. But I had got to light the candle and all the things,\nyeah. And this guy spoke as a liberator from Buchenwald, but I didn\u2019t know him before, you\nknow. So, we went out today.",
        "Q: How did that go?",
        "A: Oh, it was nice, you know, my gosh. I only wished we came in \u2014 when I was sick and\nwas liberated, people came with cameras and the press and everything and made pictures. I wish\nI would find somewhere a picture from me, because I\u2019ve got at least thousands of pictures what\nthey made. But I didn\u2019t get it. I\u2019m still looking. My wife says, \u201cWhy do you watch it?\u201d I say,\n\u201cT want to recognize me somewhere.\u201d (laughing)",
        "Q: Did you talk today with him about...?\n' Yom ha Shoah, the annual Holocaust remembrance day.\n18",
        "A: Oh yes. He was as much interested as I was. He told me what he was, he was a platoon leader\nand he was in Weimar. Weimar is, I think seven kilometers from Buchenwald. So, he had to\nbuy some things, so he went with a jeep and drove in there and what he saw. You know, so we\ntalked about it, yeah.",
        "Q: Was he Jewish?",
        "A: No. No, he\u2019s not, but you don\u2019t have to be Jewish in order to see it, you know?",
        "Q: You were, you remained in Buchenwald then for how long after the liberation?",
        "A: Oh, I did not stay in Buchenwald very long. I stayed maybe a month, or maybe three weeks and\nthen the next little, tiny city was Blankenheim. They evacuated schools and they put us in there,\nyou know it. I remember a room like this, who knows how many beds. And most of them, they\ngive bread to each one. It was plenty, but they didn\u2019t want to give, because they was afraid they\nwill die. So, she gave me bread and the other ones couldn\u2019t eat it. So sometimes I ate twenty\npieces of bread and... \u201cOh!, you will get diarrhea and you will die.\u201d I tell you I was only one\nfrom few that survived. I got the diarrhea and survived. (Laughing.) But I gained every week,\nabout five pounds. And they were all the meat... I couldn\u2019t walk. They had to teach me how to\nwalk and to go. So I was in Blankenheim. Ironically, now let\u2019s go farther, one of the doctors,\nDoctor Lucas, I met him later on in Frankfurt and he was head from TB hospital. And I had TB,\nso we became really close friends, you know, he always took care. I remember when he met this\ngirl and he want... you know, he told me, everyone around. There was a bond because he saw\nhow I was.",
        "Q: And you did mention him...\nEnd of Tape 1, Side B\n19\nTape 2, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number two, side A of an interview with Abe Jakubowicz. Sorry, we got cut off and\nyou were just saying that he was a German prisoner of war.",
        "A: Prisoner of war, that\u2019s right. And they got a lot of doctors, German prisoners of war, so his\nnurses, they were German prisoners of war.",
        "Q: Did you... so some people, of course, feel that the German nation as a whole was responsible for\nwhat the Nazis did to Jewish people. The fact that you were able to befriend this man, who was\na German, non-Jewish man.",
        "A: I say the German was responsible, but I didn\u2019t say that every German killed or a German hated.\nFact is, you know it, 1t was their , you know it. But I think there\u2019s some good and\nsome bad in every nation. And I believe, first, life is too short to hate. Secondly, I believe if I\nteach my kids to hate, somebody will hate them and it is a vicious cycle. The cycle has to stop.\nAnd my mother always told me, \u201cYou know Abe, if somebody throws a rock at you, throw them\nbread back. Take a piece of bread and throw them back, don\u2019t hate.\u201d You know, so I... even\nwhen I was liberated, I wanted to tell my story, but I didn\u2019t hate. It\u2019s wrong to hate, I can\u2019t. I\nthink that people what hate, they are born... as you see now in Yugoslavia, they take kids, for\ntwo year, throw them down , and the training, and the ditch. It takes a\nspecial person, but everybody can do it.",
        "Q: So, you weren\u2019t angry even then? Were you angry?",
        "A: I was angry, but I didn\u2019t hate. I was angry at the SS. I was angry, but never hate. I think they\nshould be punished, what they did, but not hated. In fact, my wife is German, you know. I say\nyou can\u2019t make everybody responsible for something. But then I would be the same thing like\nHitler, he said all the Jews are bad. Maybe some of them were. It\u2019s like now in Russia, I saw in\ntoday\u2019s paper, the anti-Semitism. Because they blame the Jews for what\u2019s going on now, and\nJews had nothing to do... there\u2019s only a few of them. The difference is, now the Jews have a\nway, they can run away. I couldn\u2019t. And I would run for my life, but I couldn\u2019t.",
        "Q: What was the name of the doctor again?",
        "A: Lucas.",
        "Q: Did you talk with him at all about any of these issues?",
        "A: Yes, we talked a lot about it, because he saw and we became good friends. Certain things I tried\nto avoid, I didn\u2019t want to bring up things, you know, because I knew it will not help me and it\nwill not help him. He had already his opinion formed.",
        "Q: What kind of things did you not want to bring up?\n20",
        "A: Oh, the cruelty, because he saw it. Why try to win if there\u2019s nothing there to win, you know?\nHe knew it, he saw it, so certain things I tried to avoid.",
        "Q: What was his point of view that he shared with you?",
        "A: No German will tell you that he agreed, they only got forced to do it. But I knew he got forced\nto do it, you know. He was too smart. He was not in the SS. He was a good person. Certain\npeople, even when you are good, you can\u2019t do nothing about it. He was good in my book. He\nwas a very nice person.",
        "Q: It strikes me as very unusual that you were able to separate your anger from your hatred and to\nhave meaningful relationships with...",
        "A: You have to, otherwise, you become very bitter. I have a lot of friends, you know, friends from\nthere. They are bitter. And it doesn\u2019t help you really. And if I go around and be mean and\nmistreat other people, would my mother want me to see this way? No. So I have motive to show\nthat you are not the same. You have to be different. I am different. I would force myself more\nto be mean, you know, than that is my nature. You know.",
        "Q: Did you have friends or acquaintances who were Jewish, at that time, who couldn\u2019t understand\nwhy you would want to be friends?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I had, especially when I married my wife. They was against... they say, you know it,\n\u201cHow can you do it?\u201d I say \u201cListen, I go to them, they are very nice, they open the door. I\u2019m\nsick, so money doesn\u2019t play any part. I met the most beautiful person and now this married to\nme.\u201d . Here she was a young girl, good-looking, and at the time, I tell you the\ntruth, looking back now, I needed somebody. I really needed somebody. You know, I was not\nthe one what could live alone. You know it. And it was nice. And then when we went out. And\nI would be cruel and leave her. And only because she, it was nice. Then I leave her out. Then\nthe Germans later on will say... you know it. So it\u2019s again another thing, I would have to think a\nlifetime on it. And I tell you, we are 52 years married, we had all the kids college graduate. We\nnever had any problem about the religion, about other things. I think our marriage has evened\nout.",
        "Q: Did you, you were in the TB hospital for...",
        "A: Ya, this is where the Dr. Lucas was head of it, the TB Hospital.",
        "Q: Okay, going back to the summer, you were in Blankenheim first...",
        "A: Ya, and then the Russians came in. And I couldn\u2019t stay with the Russians. They ask you why\nyou don\u2019t go home. They thought because I murdered somebody. You know, therefore I don\u2019t\nwant to go. I told them everybody got killed. So I away. There were a lot of\nJewish guys. We went to the railroad, we drove to Berlin, and from Berlin we drove to\nFrankfurt. You know we came over in the American zone.\n21",
        "Q: Before you go on from there, regarding your statement that you knew you didn\u2019t want to go back\nto Poland because everybody had been killed.",
        "A: I just thought everybody was dead. It was a cemetery. I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Q: Did you get definite news at that point about your father and your brother and your mother?",
        "A: You ask, that\u2019s true, you ask. In fact, when I came to Berlin and it was all the troops from\neverywhere, from Russia. And there was a guy, he exactly looked like my father. And I want to\nbelieve and I asked him. I just direct asked him, you know it. Surely it was not, but I wanted to\nbelieve it. You know, I didn\u2019t know it. I found out later on from people what were with him,\nthat he died in 1945 in Dora, you know, not far away from where I was. Maybe the mountain\nwas from the other side, but I didn\u2019t know it. He died in 1945, in the beginning of \u201845.",
        "Q: When did you find that out? And from whom?",
        "A: I happened to be, you know, when you come after the war, you ask everybody. \u201cHey, you didn\u2019t\nyou see?\u201d \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d \u201cPiotrk\u00e9w.\u201d \u201cPiotrk6w? Did you know my dad?\u201d You\nknow, because in Piotrkow... and he said, \u201cYes.\u201d In fact, this guy, his name is Rappaport and he\nbecame a dentist in St. Louis. He\u2019s dead now, too. But I found out in Rupertstein (ph), he was\nsick on TB, too.",
        "Q: And when did you learn about Treblinka and what Treblinka...?",
        "A: I knew this all, this I knew right away. That the whole transport went to Treblinka. When you\nwent to Treblinka, it was death. And I knew this, so I didn\u2019t have to ask anymore.",
        "Q: Right away after the war, you mean? Or right away...?",
        "A: Yeah, right away after the war. In fact, I came late, because I was in Buchenwald, you know,\nand then I was in Blankenheim, in the hospital. So it was a few months after the war already. I\nwould say, we got liberated in April, maybe six months later, because I had to walk and I\ncouldn\u2019t walk right away. I got there about six months, seven months. Then it was awful cold\nand I didn\u2019t feel good. And I was coughing. And I got x-rayed and they told me, \u201cAbe, you\u2019ve\ngot TB. You better go to the hospital.\u201d",
        "Q: And that was when you went to Rupertstein? You were in there for quite a while, weren\u2019t you?\nHow long were you there?",
        "A: I stayed in Rupertstein until 1947. No, \u201857, \u201857. I got married in *47.",
        "Q: You stayed in the town?",
        "A: Ya, in town. I was in hospital maybe two, I would say to about a few months before I got\nmarried. End \u201846 or the beginning of \u201847.\n22",
        "Q: What did you, was that time, what was that time in the hospital like? Were you really sick and\nout of commission? Or did you...?",
        "A: No, you were sick. You felt good, TB doesn\u2019t hurt you. So all what in that time, now you got\npenicillin and streptomycin. In that time, all what could help you, so many people died... in fact,\na lot of people what I wasn\u2019t there was liberated, they died. You got to lay down and breathe\nfresh air. It was high in the mountains. They give you decent food, and that was it, you know.\nMother Nature in that time had to help. So certain people didn\u2019t make it... because a lot of\npeople years ago died on TB.",
        "Q: So, during your, what did you do to keep yourself busy and occupied during that time?",
        "A: Well, we went in the village. Really a lot of people weren\u2019t supposed to go, because there was,\nthey call it, plus and minuses. If you got the bacillus and you don\u2019t have it, but you still had TB.\nI could, because, you know... but a lot of people had it and went any way, because the Germans\nat that time would not stop you, you know. So, we went in the village. I got some... from\nUNRRA, United Refugees... anyway we got some packages and we traded. I couldn\u2019t eat, how\nmuch sugar can you eat? So, we traded for some different things, you know. Some had fruits.\nYou know, it was a village more, you know it, we traded with the people. We got coffee, you\nknow at that time coffee didn\u2019t mean nothing to me, but to them it meant a lot, you know.",
        "Q: You said something earlier about how when the war ended, you became again, the person who\nyou had been before.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Did you start to go to services in any way?",
        "A: There was not anymore services. There was in Salzheim. When I was in Rupertstein, I was\nalone, you know, with a few other people. But I had, not a cousin, but a relative far away and\nhe... Windheim (ph). He was liberated. No, he ran away on papers that he\u2019s a Pole or\nsomething. So, we went, for the high holiday, he invited me. And we went to the synagogue.\nBecause there wasn\u2019t a synagogue really, in Frankfurt everything bombed out anyway. It was in\nthe Rochiltalay (ph) there was a meeting where you could pray. So, I went for the high holidays,\nbut otherwise all what you wanted really is to survive.",
        "Q: And after you, so you still felt, even after the war ended, that your main goal was survival for a\ntime?",
        "A: When you are sick, you want to get well. And if that\u2019s not the goal, then you see, see a lot of\npeople, they survived and they\u2019re dying. But you wanted to survive, you wanted to live. I was\nonly 21 years old, 20 years old. But now I got surely, the will to live is very, very strong.",
        "Q: Did you start to have, as you started to recover and to feel healthier, did you start to have other\ngoals for what you wanted? Or did you start to remember, have thoughts about the past? What\nwas going on inside?\n23",
        "A: In my brain?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, from the beginning when I got better, then you know, you want to live, you want to\ngo toa dance. You\u2019re still young. I met my wife and we got married, then you got children. So,\nmaybe I didn\u2019t start it from the right side, but sometimes time dictates it. You know, certain\npeople were different. They first want the career. I wasn\u2019t smart enough to do all that thinking.\nI become a child again. (laughing)",
        "Q: Can you talk about, more about meeting your wife and what that was...?",
        "A: How I met my wife? We knew a girl, a Jewish girl, and she was not quiet sick. So, they had a\nhouse, and were rented the rooms there for her. Her name was Lutia (ph). And she happened to\nbe from Lodz and my friend was from Lodz. We always went there to see how she was doing.\nNothing else, we want, you know it. So, when I came, I say, \u201cMy gosh, that\u2019s a good looking\ngirl.\u201d But then you forget a lot of things. Oh look at this, he has all . My wife... and\nat that time girls played hard to get. But when you talk a lot and you talk and you know... my\ngoal was, not to stay in Germany, having children and leave, maybe for Israel, maybe for the\nUnited States. But since I had TB and I was sick, Israel and the climate would have been very\ntough. I was supposed to come here in 1952, but my wife talked me out. She says, \u201cListen,\nthese people want to go. Look here we got the nice apartment. We got everything to eat. Why\ndo you rush so much?\u201d So, I gave in and in 1957... was Hungarian uprising in 1956. And I\nknew that\u2019s the last way I can get out, and still I didn\u2019t want to. But that\u2019s the way we got here.",
        "Q: Was it difficult for you to live in Germany during those years?",
        "A: It was really not, because the Germans are very, very nice, even when what they think is\nsomething different. You learn to live with it. You know, if you have something, if you have a\nhunchback, you learn to live as a hunchback, you know. (Laughing.) You cannot go against a\ntrend. They was extremely nice. And then I thought I needed a trade. So, I went to work for the\nIG Farben. And they sent me to a school and they taught me, you know, about the way. So and\nthe people saw and I worked with them, that I was not different. I was not what they had told\nthem Iam. You know, so, no... in fact, when I was supposed to go to the United States, I told\nthem. They said, \u201cListen, we give you a year leave of absence and if you don\u2019t like it, you can\nalways come back.\u201d And they made an album and everybody wrote something nice in it. Iam\nnot a person what carries around hatred.",
        "Q: So, did you know when you started working for IG Farben, what their role, their history had\nbeen?",
        "A: Oh yeah. I knew it, because I told you, I saw the Zyklon B, and all the gas. In fact, near\nAuschwitz there was a, called Buna, they made gasoline from coal. And as far as I know it was\nconducted by IG Farben, too. Yes, I knew it, but I had to... when you have to live, you have to\n24\nlive. I want a trade, and then first things first. And then it\u2019s different. You cannot kill before\nyou're dead. (Laughing.)",
        "Q: But how ironic that they were, that IG Farben had Jews working as slave labor during the war\nand then you were working...",
        "A: That is right. I worked there, because I wanted to learn a trade. I cannot work physically hard\nanymore and there was... they paid me good. They were extremely nice. They went out of their\nway. And sometimes you have to take advantage, later on, you cannot forget, but you have to\nlearn to forgive a little bit.",
        "Q: Did they know that you were Jewish?",
        "A: Ya. And I didn\u2019t have to be ashamed then later on, you know. Yes, I told them.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t experience any anti-Semitism from them?",
        "A: If it was, it was only behind my back. They wouldn\u2019t openly show it, no. Germans are different,\nyou know. See, a Russian, if he is, he tells you. And Germans will be very, very nice, you\nknow. The nicer they get, then you know you have to watch out. (Laughing. )",
        "Q: Were you afraid, at all?",
        "A: Why would I be afraid? No, I wasn\u2019t afraid.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t feel that there was a danger of any Holocaust happening again?",
        "A: In Germany now? I will say Germany now is different. I was there a few times. You got still a\nfew, but they are, but most of them, they\u2019re educated, they\u2019re adaptable, you know. They know\nit was wrong. They know what Hitler... the older ones. All 1t brought them 1s, they couldn\u2019t\nspeak, they couldn\u2019t do. Now, they have a nice country built. When we went to Israel, saw a lot\nof German tourists. They\u2019re interested. You know, sure they will always find... like anything\nelse, here too, people would relate. And no matter what, if somebody tells me he hates blacks, I\nknow right away he hates everybody, stay away, you know. And I know it. So, this type will\nalways hate and you know why? Because it\u2019s an excuse for their misery. They will not say it. I\ndidn\u2019t go to school because I was dumb. If the Jews would not go, I would go there. You know?\nIt is the same thing. What do you agree it is this way? It doesn\u2019t work the other way.",
        "Q: There was a Nuremberg trial, a case brought against IG Farben that came to trial in 1947, 1948.\nWere you following that, interested in that?",
        "A: No, no. \u201847, \u201848 I was still... you know, I just got married. I followed a little bit, you know, you\nalways, but no.",
        "Q: When were you working for IG Farben?\n25",
        "A: I was working in 1954, \u201855, \u201856 and \u201857. But I tell you a story, while I was working for IG\nFarben and now when I retired, the German government couldn\u2019t say I was not . You\nget the SS the war years, they had to give me the war years, and I got a nice pension from\nGermany. Beside being a Holocaust survivor, you know, because they had to give me all the\nyears. And they cannot say, \u201cHey, we give an SS man.\u201d Say yes, wasn\u2019t in the war, and while I\nwas in concentration camp, I don\u2019t get it. They had to pay me back so much. I said only I\u2019Il try,\nbut in this case they was very generous.",
        "Q: How was your relationship with your wife\u2019s family?",
        "A: Oh, it was good. They was not... really you know everybody can say, but then when you live so\nlong, you see the history. You know, they live in a little village, they minded their own business.\nThey never knew Jews. Maybe if they knew they would hate one, but they did not know, I know\nit.",
        "Q: Did they have an understanding of the extent of what had been done in the name of Germany to\nthe Jews of Europe?",
        "A: Oh ya, oh ya. They tried those, a lot of them German... they tried to excuse and they didn\u2019t do\nit. I know a lot of them didn\u2019t do it, but that\u2019s the way, what it was. Yes.",
        "Q: So, they talked to you about it and...?",
        "A: We talked a lot about it, you know. But they was really, they maybe had to play the game, but\nnobody was in the Party. And ina small village, everybody will talk about you. In a big city,\nyou don\u2019t know it. All you had to do, is go to the neighbors and you know everything. You\nknow even what they cook.",
        "Q: Did you have friends who, you mentioned something earlier about how some of your friends\nwere saying you shouldn\u2019t...?",
        "A: Yes, I was in the hospital with them. They were my age. A few of them, ironically, came from\nBlankenheim, you know, from... after we was liberated, they came with me in the same train and\nwe stuck kind of together. He found out he had TB and I had TB, so we were kind of, there was\na bonding. If you have nobody, your friends become your relatives. You\u2019re bonding, it\u2019s true.\nAnd we could speak openly, you know, that is their opinion. And I value their opinion. I don\u2019t\nsay that they were wrong. I really didn\u2019t know, maybe I was mixed up and didn\u2019t know what\nwas right or wrong.",
        "Q: Did they come to your wedding?",
        "A: Yes, yes, ironically they came to my wedding, too. In fact, one was the best man, Trebletski\n(ph).",
        "Q: What kind of wedding did you have?\n26",
        "A: As little bitty as we could. It was not very much. We went only to the Justice of Peace. You\nknow. And he said, \u201cYou are man and wife.\u201d So, we made a little bit, what we could get at that\ntime. It was not very much. But it was... like the style you would say was very poor, but it was\nfine. I got the bride anyway. (Laughing.)",
        "Q: Right, that\u2019s what matters. Did you talk before hand about, I imagine you did, about what you\nwere going to do as far as religion?",
        "A: Well, sure. My wife is not Jewish. And I figured with the kids, it would not be fair for me and\nshe would not make a good Jew anyway. It is only because to please somebody, like I would not\nmake a good Catholic. Doesn\u2019t mean that I hate the Catholics, by no means not. But my kids\ngot to choose what they want to. Like Janet, she goes always on the holidays she goes with me\nto the synagogue. And my oldest daughter, she lives in Barrington, in Chicago. She does a lot.\nAnd what I\u2019m mostly proud is that they\u2019re all involved in the Holocaust survivors, the second\ngeneration. They\u2019re active. It is not that they hate. It is not to let people forget, look here what\nhappens. You cannot make it back. I cannot turn the clock back. But we can let the people\nknow what hatred can do.",
        "Q: So, at that point, religion, which had been important to you before the war was not as important\nto you...",
        "A: No, I saw what people, if they become fanatic. And you start to put religion in front, then you\nlose your sight. You have to first see, and really what\u2019s good when you are religious and go pray\nand don\u2019t live up to it. I call them the hypocrites. So you have to have it in the heart and nothing\nelse. And nobody can force you to be something. If you don\u2019t have it, you don\u2019t have it.",
        "Q: Why did you want to leave Germany\u2019?",
        "A: Because I didn\u2019t want my kids to be exposed anymore. And truthfully, very truthfully, I didn\u2019t\nwant them to get married there and be there, you know? I wanted them really to get away. That\nis really my, to give you the best answer what I know, really.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t necessarily feel fully trusting of Germany and the German people?",
        "A: Yeah, but, I feel trusting, but if you get wounded, a scar is there. Okay? I had the scar. But that\ndoesn\u2019t mean that can function perfect yet. You\u2019ve got now a lot of Jewish people that come\nfrom Israel, even, they live, and a lot of them from Russia. You know, but for me, was too much\nexperience and I didn\u2019t want to rub salt in the wounds. You know, I want to stay away. Maybe\nit was the easiest way out. I don\u2019t know it. This is just what I felt, you know.",
        "Q: Was talking... during those years just following the war, was talking about what had, what had\nhappened to you, and about your past and about your feelings about losing your family... was\nthat important to you? And was it a critical part of your relationship?",
        "A: It is still very important to me. In order to clear the air, you have to get everything on the table\nand then you can go on. If you play a game, it will be still there. Can\u2019t do it. So, yes it is fine.\n27\nIn fact my wife now, \u201cWhy do you watch all that?\u201d I say, I still have to watch it. It brings back\nbad memories, but you still have to go on, and not forget it. I will not forget it regardless, you\nknow.",
        "Q: Did you have... I\u2019m sorry, let me stop and flip the tape.\nEnd of Tape 2, Side A\n28\nTape 2, Side B",
        "Q: You mean both sides?",
        "A: Being here, and after liberation, how I felt... being a little boy...",
        "Q: Yeah, well, it\u2019s so complicated, isn\u2019t it? To try to think of what came before, and what...",
        "A: Life is complicated. You know it. You have only to learn to make the best right away. You\nhave to learn not to let it go, let it get to you, the teflon mentality, because otherwise you get\nsoaked on with it, you know.",
        "Q: The which mentality?",
        "A: The teflon mentality.",
        "Q: I thought that was what you said.",
        "A: You\u2019ve got to, because otherwise what are you going to do? You know. It\u2019s part of the Bible,\ntoo.",
        "Q: Well, I appreciate you taking the time to do this.",
        "A: Any time, you know.",
        "Q: You just mentioned something about other interviews. I wondered, have you been interviewed?\nHave you done other interviews besides...\u201d",
        "A: Only for Shoah\u2019.",
        "Q: Uh huh, Shoah.",
        "A: And then came a lady, she did interviews for that, but besides she did it for herself, too. So, I got\nanother interview. And then I had a few speeches for the... you know, when it\u2019s the Shoah. So I\nwent and I spoke a little. It is not as easy as you think, when you see so many thousands of\npeople. And to show, you know, your people and show . I can speak about\neverything, I have no problem. But this is hard. And then you don\u2019t want to show your\nemotions. The emotions come, you know it? So you know, this was the... you have to do it,\nwhat you have to do.",
        "Q: Yeah, I wondered whether when you first started, when you first had the experience of trying to\nsystematically tell the story of your experiences, whether that was a powerful experience for\nyou?\n* Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation.\n29",
        "A: It was. It was for me and it was for the other people, too. You know it. Because, you know, it\u2019s\nreally nothing to make you happy, basically, and nothing to be proud of, you know, it\u2019s part of\nwhat you went through. And you have to do it. I told myself in concentration, if I survive and I\ncan do something, I will go out and not tell the people, I will scream to the people. But the real\nworld is different.",
        "Q: You mentioned that two of, was it two of your children were born in Germany?",
        "A: Ya, my oldest one.",
        "Q: What\u2019s your oldest one\u2019s name?",
        "A: Bluma, is after my mother\u2019s name. Yeah, she was born in 1948. In July, no in June. And my\nson is born in July. His name is Ben, you know it, and he was born in July, in 1954. And Janet,\nthe youngest is when we came to the United States, my wife found out she is pregnant and then\nJanet, she was born here. That was in 1957.",
        "Q: What made you want to come to the United States?",
        "A: To get away and to be a free person, you know. To be free. I knew always. The United States,\nsure there\u2019s people like KKK, you know, but most people, they are not from here, they\nunderstand if somebody is nice to me, what do I care if he\u2019s an Arab, or but he\u2019s nice\ntome. Like my neighbor, Scotty, you know it, we\u2019ve already forty years to go. And we always\nused to go, when we were younger, together out. You know, so, it\u2019s too much of a mixture to\nundo it. And in Europe, you\u2019ve got only two religions. Say, go to Ireland. It was Catholic, only\none is Roman Catholic and the other one is Protestant and they hate each other, you know. So\nwhen you got a minority, you know, it\u2019s only two, always will be the same thing.",
        "Q: So, it appealed to you to come to a place that had a real mixture of people.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, people understand different culture, that\u2019s right. People are more tolerant.",
        "Q: Is that why the United States appealed to you more than Israel, for example?",
        "A: Israel appealed to me very much, but first thing, you know, I was too sick. I would have to stay\nmuch longer and then go to Israel. And I knew in Israel I would have to work much harder and\nthat the climate is much more, you know, it\u2019s warmer and hotter. So, if I had, had another\nchoice, I would go to Israel, yeah.",
        "Q: Did your wife have any feeling about where she wanted to be?",
        "A: My wife really wanted to stay in Germany. And I told her about the kids and everything. She\nsays, Okay, then we try and if I don\u2019t like it, you can always go back. The worst thing in life is\nwhen people don\u2019t try. And you don\u2019t know, you don\u2019t know your potential. You don\u2019t know\nnothing. You have to be willing to take risk and try in your life. And if it didn\u2019t go right, don\u2019t\nblame nobody. Pick up the pieces and keep on going. But that\u2019s life things.\n30",
        "Q: Did you have relatives in the United States?",
        "A: Yes, I had relatives, but they was very, very far, you know. From my grandmother, had a sister,\nthey lived in Philadelphia. And when we came there, they were so nice and they tried to help\nyou. But really, what you can help, is help yourself by doing... you know. But they were nice,\nin fact, we correspond a lot, a long time. He just died, he was 88 or something, you know, you\nget old. He had two children. In fact, his daughter came to visit us, you know. I got now\nrelatives. I got a cousin and he came from Israel. But still , from my grandmother,\nshe had another sister and she went to Israel. The name was Goldstein. And after 1947, he\nwanted to study engineering here in the United States. And he really told me in his mind was to,\ncooling systems, because they need... but when he came and he studied here, he went to\nBerkeley. He got approached by the Bechtel Corporation, if he wanted to take atomic\nengineering. He said, I don\u2019t know nothing about it. They say, we will put you through college\nand everything. So, he went and studied atomic engineering. In fact, he is now, he\u2019s built so\nmany reactors, and you know? And then he taught at Berkeley too for a while. But even\nnowadays, retired... his name is Golan (ph) now, from Goldstein changed. He still likes\n, like... when it was in Russia, when the explosion was in the, what was name is it?\nThey went there to see what they can do.",
        "Q: Chernobyl?",
        "A: Chernobyl, ya. So they still, like last week, he went to Paris, they have all this, scientists. In\nfact, two months ago we went to visit him. He lives in San Francisco.",
        "Q: What\u2019s his first name?",
        "A: Simcha. Simcha in Jewish means happiness and the last name is Golan from Goldstein. Ya, he\nwas here visiting. You know, it\u2019s family, so we stay close.",
        "Q: How 1s he related to you?",
        "A: My grandmother had, she was the oldest and she had five sisters. And one went to the United\nStates, one went to Israel. One, she lived in Lodz and went together in the same train with my\nmother and my grandmother to Treblinka. And she left a son, he ran away. She had a few kids,\nbut they all went together. He survived and he lives now in New York. And one lived in\nWarsaw with the , he was Rudja (ph), he was the youngest one of them. From these\ntwo, later on when you have no family, you look and whatever you can find.",
        "Q: Did you know very much about the United States when, before you came here?",
        "A: I knew quite a bit, but what you knew as a boy, it\u2019s completely different, you know. I read Jack\nLondon and had dreams and all kinds of junk, you know it. It\u2019s completely different. But later\non, I thought you know it. A place if I would like to go. I would like to go really to the United\nState. And we spoke fairly a little bit English already. We knew more than the average. When\n31\nwe needed some oil, we could buy oil and we didn\u2019t come home with vinegar. (Laughing.) You\nknow, ,",
        "Q: So, your wife also didn\u2019t speak very much English?",
        "A: Yeah, she didn\u2019t speak very much, but we understood. We took lessons. We prepared ourselves\na little bit, because we had time.",
        "Q: In Germany\u201d",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you have an idea of what you would do once you were here?",
        "A: No, I told you, I wanted to go in chemistry. But most of them, like here when I came, they\ncouldn\u2019t hire me, because I was a citizen... I was not a citizen. So, I got my first paid job for a\nperson who made glasses. For a dollar an hour, and then it worked out and I liked it. Now, we\ngot the 20/20 Eye Care store. We\u2019re doing very good. If you feel you like it, you try it. And if\nyou don\u2019t succeed, try it again, get stubborn.",
        "Q: What were your initial experiences or your first impressions of the United States?",
        "A: It was always... oh! When I got my first paycheck and, you know, you are not spoiled. And you\ncan buy so many things. And it\u2019s a free world. We lived on, you don\u2019t know it here, St.\nCatherine Street, you know it. And you hear the bells from the church ringing. And the\nsunshine\u2019s nicer when you like it, you know. And we lived near a park and we took the kids to\nthe park. It was nice. Yeah. We loved it right away. Even if we didn\u2019t have nothing, but we\nloved it.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t come straight to Louisville, right? You were in...?",
        "A: I was first in Philadelphia. And in Philadelphia I didn\u2019t like it, only because my wife got\npregnant, was pregnant. In Germany we had the best hospital, the best everything. And since I\nworked for IG Farben, I could get anyplace, you know it, they had always. And we had a nice\nhome. So it was an adjustment. Like the garbage emptied only one time in a week and was\nstanding around. And we was in a hotel, very old. The Gladstone (ph) Hotel, I remember this.\nWe was maybe on the 17 or 20\" floor, but when you want to see what kind of weather, you have\nto open the window, everything was dusty. I didn\u2019t care for it, particularly, but... I had this one\nfriend, Colrink (ph). And he says, \u201cAbe, if you want to come here, I\u2019m working for Ford Motor\nCompany. I can get you there ajob.\u201d So, I came to Louisville. First I came and I said to my\nwife, \u201cIf I get the job, I gave you and, you know, call you up, and you come with the kids.\u201d Well\neven then you don\u2019t react. You\u2019ve got all this luggage, pregnant, two kids, you know,\n. But that was what we did. So we stayed in... we came over here. We rented an\napartment. And here it was different. It\u2019s a smaller city, everything was organized. I worked for\nFord Motor Company and at that time made about 100 dollars a week. My gosh, I could for ten\ndollars, load up so much groceries I couldn\u2019t even carry it, you know. So.\n32",
        "Q: Did you have any knowledge about Louisville at the time? Or what you might have expected?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t even know that Louisville exist. No.",
        "Q: So, you couldn\u2019t have any prejudices against it, then.",
        "A: No, I did not. No, I did not. But it\u2019s still a nice city. People are nice. I like it. In fact, my\ndaughter, she went to Lexington. She went to Law School. She went to Lexington.",
        "Q: During this time when you\u2019re beginning to rebuild your life, did you take time to mourn what\nyou had lost?",
        "A: No, you took later on. From the beginning, you couldn\u2019t even tell nobody. People wouldn\u2019t\nunderstand it. They thought that you are freaks. They tried to stay away from you, you know it.\nYou didn\u2019t act like the people here. In fact, it was hard on the kids, too, you know. We didn\u2019t\nspeak any perfect English, you know. It was hard, but we knew that we would catch up. First\nyou have to have a footage and then you get time. No, not from the beginning, but later on,\nyeah.",
        "Q: When were you able to take time to do that?",
        "A: When I saw... I went to the Jewish Community Center. We took the kids. Later on when I quit,\nnot I quit, they quit me from Ford Motor Company, because they laid off the whole second shift.\nAnd I went to work for dispenser Eli Jaffe (ph). He was Jewish, so I could at least speak with\nhim. How well you can speak to somebody else. So, it takes, it\u2019s a slowly thing. It doesn\u2019t\ncome overnight. It does not, you know. And then you didn\u2019t want to offend nobody. You didn\u2019t\nknow how the people would react, you know.",
        "Q: Did people ask you about your experiences?",
        "A: If you don\u2019t tell, nobody will ask me. And I didn\u2019t tell from the beginning. It\u2019s only the last,\nyou know, about ten years ago. No, we went, ten years, we went to Washington. Holocaust. So,\nmaybe about 15 years, yeah.",
        "Q: And how was the Louisville Jewish community? Did you become involved with people here?\nJewish people in the community?",
        "A: Ya, I came involved. But still, they in that time didn\u2019t want to hear it either. In order to find a\nlistener, somebody has to listen, you know. So, until later on when they found out that we are\nnot lying, that such things exist. A lot of people didn\u2019t want to believe that such exists, you\nknow. So, it took a while. I don\u2019t know how long. But I know it took a long time, you know.",
        "Q: So, when you met people and they knew that you were from Europe, they just would, they\nwouldn\u2019t ask you where you came from, anything like that?\n33",
        "A: No, no. In fact, when you interview people now, they will tell you the same thing. They had a\nvery hard time to communicate with them, you know it. Because you was different. They had\ntheir problems, they didn\u2019t want to hear my problems, even it was not a problem no more. Still\nsooner or later, you know... it was not overnight.",
        "Q: It seems like that would have made it difficult to form relationships, trusting friendships.",
        "A: It was not. Somewhere, I\u2019m already better than 90 percent, because I\u2019m easy trusting, so I have\nno problems. But a lot of them, they couldn\u2019t trust, they still cannot trust. And in fact, I cannot\nblame them. They are different.",
        "Q: Did you start meeting people who were Holocaust survivors in the Louisville area?",
        "A: Yeah, that was the first, you start to look for somebody what you got something in common.\nAnd people what came mostly, you know, we call them the greenah (ph). You know the green\npeople. That was the Holocaust survivors who are, you know. And then you want to show to the\npeople that you aren\u2019t a loser. That is not true, what they said, you know. Then you try to work\nharder than the other one, you want to be better than the other. You try to... you know it. The\nkids didn\u2019t understand it, but it was true.",
        "Q: So there was some competition going on?",
        "A: Not between the other ones, no. Between... I try to prove to the other world, that I am not really,\none what they think I am, you know? And then you\u2019ve got a guilt feeling too. They think, \u201cMy\ngosh he survived, how many people did he kill in order to survive? How come the other ones\ndidn\u2019t survive and he survived?\u201d So, there was a guilt feeling, too, you know. How come I\nsurvived?",
        "Q: You felt like people were judging you for surviving?",
        "A: I judged myself and other people judged me, too, you know it. I must have been very bad, when\nthe other ones didn\u2019t survive and I did, you know. So, you got the double whammy. (laughing)",
        "Q: Was there any kind of formal meeting of Holocaust survivors in Louisville?",
        "A: No... they lived here and they tried to share, it was a little bit longer than I am, where they shop,\nand then we bought some records, from old country. Yiddish. I still like to listen to them, you\nknow, and we formed a world within ourselves. But you cannot live in this world, because there\nis no walls. And certain people they still live with it, you know, they don\u2019t speak much English.\nThey don\u2019t trust other ones. And in this case I did much, much better than the other ones.",
        "Q: How did you find the other people? Was it through the Jewish community?",
        "A: Right, through the Jewish community center. And then when one found out, he told the other\none, so you knew them right away. Word got very fast out.\n34",
        "Q: So, were your meetings usually just one on one or did you ever gather at the...?",
        "A: Oh, we went to the Jewish Community Center, for example, you met them there. And if you\nliked somebody, you invite them to your house or they invite you. You cannot like everybody\nthe same way. God didn\u2019t meant it to be this. You know? Somehow the chemistry has to\nmatch.",
        "Q: Were you aware of other things going on in Louisville at the time that you moved here? Such as\nCivil Rights movement?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I could read the paper and I read the paper. And I was completely on their side, you\nknow it. Because it\u2019s more than fair, those people. In fact, I found out then, the German\nprisoners of war could go in places where they couldn\u2019t, when they were fighting for the United\nStates. To me it didn\u2019t make sense. Oh yes, and the one thing about our kids, we do not hate,\nyou know.",
        "Q: Did you see a parallel in the situation, between the situation of the blacks in the United States\nand the Jews of Europe? Of course, they\u2019re not at all the same. But did you see the issue of\nracism as being...",
        "A: The Jews had the advantage in this case. Because a lot of them don\u2019t look like blacks, so they\ndon\u2019t judge them, you know it. So, if they want to beat up, it was first the black and then the\nJew. They didn\u2019t hate him, they didn\u2019t like him, but they didn\u2019t know it, you know, what you\ndid. So... . Yes, if somebody will come to you and tells you, \u201cI hate blacks,\u201d you\nknow automatically he will hate you. Or somebody, I hate something for some reason, then you\nknow this man or this woman put their mind on hating or looking for excuses, because they are a\nfailure and therefore they hate. There is no reason. If you want to be, it is an open country, you\ncan do much better, work harder. We came in \u201857, you know. In 1960, we bought the house.\nWe worked hard. We couldn\u2019t maybe have afford it in that time, oh I could afford later on might\nbe, but it doesn\u2019t mean the kids... you know. But, and if I say \u201cOoh, I\u2019m living a lifetime here\nand can\u2019t afford it.\u201d Yes, if you go out and spend your paycheck, then you can\u2019t afford it. You\nhave to know it, what you got, and then they have a goal, what you want to . Dol\nwant to go and drink it away or do something, you know, you can do it. You have to balance\nyour money.",
        "Q: Did you experience anti-Semitism in Louisville at all?",
        "A: Really, really, no, you know. At first here where I live there is no Jewish people. No, I did not,\nto be truthful, no. And in business, where I had a Jewish boss, or here when I do this. I tell\nthem, you know, I\u2019m Jewish. But they work for us, so I don\u2019t think somebody would go out\nand... no. But we treat them right. If we don\u2019t give them a choice to be not to. You know, we\ngive them health care, and a lot of things. I know what it means to make a very dedicated\nemployee. There is no one way street. You cannot exploit somebody and tell them I\u2019m your\nfriend. It doesn\u2019t work.",
        "Q: Did you live in a Jewish neighborhood when you first arrived in Louisville?\n35",
        "A: No. I lived on St. Catherine Street, which wasn\u2019t a Jewish neighborhood. I tell you the truth.\nSometimes it crossed my mind, why don\u2019t you go move near the Jewish Community Center. But\nthen I thought, you know what, sometimes it 1s better when you stay away, even when you go up,\nyou climb. The higher you go, the more you can observe. You know it. So I say if I want to go,\nI can go there, I don\u2019t have to live there, you know. Back in the ghetto, they created their own\nghetto.",
        "Q: Do you, how have you, how do you feel about living in Kentucky? Do you, do you like it?",
        "A: It\u2019s a very nice state. And you got equal opportunity and it is not like a Southern state, now I\nknow more about states. People are different here.",
        "Q: How are they different?",
        "A: They\u2019re more tolerant. They\u2019re much more tolerant. Sometimes in life you develop, something\nwhat you can judge already, called instinct. I might not be always right, but sometimes my\ninstinct is right, you know. So, I know it is in there. If I go to New York, hustle, bustle, too\nmuch running, going to work so long and coming home, you have no time to spend with the\nfamily. Here you are right close to everything, you have more time to spend with the family, I\nthink. To bring up children, regardless, Louisville is a nice city.",
        "Q: Do you travel around elsewhere in the state at all?",
        "A: Yeah. We got stores, you know, but this is stores, but otherwise, yes. We go in state and out of\nstate. Yes, we do a lot of things. But sometimes I combine my work, you know. We got in\nElizabethtown, a store, we got in Litchfield, a store, we got in Jeffersonville, a store, you know.\nWe\u2019ll go around and, you know, talk with the people. See, I\u2019m 75 years old already. Have to be\nthankful for a lot of things.",
        "Q: You must enjoy your work a lot.",
        "A: I enjoy my freedom. It is not so much the work, as I enjoy talking to people. And this what I\nlike about uptakes (ph), you try their glasses, you can talk to them. I always enjoy talking to\npeople.",
        "Q: Do your employees know anything about your history?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do they ask you about it?",
        "A: In fact, yes, a few times. Some of them came when I had, told them I\u2019m speaking, if you want\nto... And everyone knows everybody and we got a lot of black people, they got to high\npositions, and they\u2019re doing good. To me, it is a person. Because we got here in Fern Creek one\nand he is a very good employee. And my wife says, \u201cWhy do you take the ;\n36\nand unfortunately people are prejudiced.\u201d I said, \u201cYou know I came from Poland. They hated\nthe Jews, but every Pole had his own Jew.\u201d You know, they come and ask more for them, they\nask for me. You know, they\u2019re good. What does they care, when they go out, and they see the\nglasses is good and he\u2019s nice to them, after a while they forget it.",
        "Q: And what do your employees think? Do they tell you what they think of knowing something\nabout your past?",
        "A: If you want to go this way, they all will be nice, but I know deep inside, you know what, I don\u2019t\ngive them a chance not to be nice. I\u2019m very nice to them.",
        "Q: They haven\u2019t talked... have they talked to you directly about your Holocaust history?",
        "A: Some yes, some of them didn\u2019t, don\u2019t even know the subject. We\u2019ve got a lot of young kids, 20,\n25, you know, you cannot put it up on them anyway, even if I would want to, you know.\nThey\u2019ve got their struggles. They\u2019re married. Especially now, when two people go to work.",
        "Q: Part of the reason I\u2019m asking is that I think people have in recent years, become so much more\naware of the Holocaust. And young people have become so interested...",
        "A: I saw it on television and I thought so. And they know my feelings, they will come and tell me,\nyes, you know. But otherwise I will not go there. If they do not approach me, I will not\napproach them.",
        "Q: What kind of responses have you gotten from people, when they\u2019ve heard you talk, for example\nat the Shoah day\u201d?",
        "A: Oh, very, very nice. People are different, you know, they got their own struggle. And they see\non television what you went through and now you\u2019 ve got the Bosnia and you\u2019ve got this. So,\nyou know it. And now you\u2019ve got in Russia, you\u2019ve got a powder keg, too. You know, so.\nEnd of Tape 2, Side B\n37\nTape 3, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number three, side A of an interview with Abe Jakubowicz. When did you become a\ncitizen of the United States?",
        "A: After being five years here, exactly, you know it. We came in \u201857, 1962. Yeah, we didn\u2019t wait\nvery long.",
        "Q: Was that a significant, important occasion for you?",
        "A: Very, very much. Now you feel, you saw this, yesterday, Kruschev\u2019s son became an American\ncitizen. And they asked him about it. He said it is a big honor. So, me a poor, Jewish guy got it,\nit\u2019s a very big honor, yes. You know, yes.",
        "Q: Can you recall some of your feelings at the time? Your thoughts and feelings?",
        "A: I felt like I am a part of the family. The circle is now getting closed. What\u2019s gone, you cannot\nforget it, but now I\u2019m a part of everything. I\u2019m a citizen. I represent the United States and I\nknow I will make a good citizen. I knew it at that time, you know it. I think I made a very good\ncitizen, you know. We\u2019re involved in a lot of things, you know, so we\u2019re doing it. We\u2019re paying\nback to society, too. You have to and it\u2019s much nicer to pay back than receive, much nicer.",
        "Q: A lot of people don\u2019t see it that way. (Laughing.)",
        "A: Yeah, if you need everything, all what you see, the things what I need. But you never see the\nreward, you know, in giving. That\u2019s why I always say the poor has one thing that he can afford.\nYou know, the reward of giving. And giving is very, very important. We got raised even as a\nchild, you know, that you have to collect more to help the other ones. We call it Schtucka (ph),\nyou know it. So to me it 1s you, it is always you are there. If I were to take a\njob for an hour, for a dollar an hour, I\u2019m ordered not to get it. You know. Because I saw there\u2019s\nother people that need it more. You know, but it\u2019s nice, a good feeling.",
        "Q: Do you still, do you observe...?",
        "A: High holidays?",
        "Q: ...high holidays and do you go at any other time, too?",
        "A: No, any other time, no, but the high holidays, I\u2019m going. And the main thing what I\u2019m going to\nis because that they have a prayer for the death, you know it. And that\u2019s the only one thing, I\nknow that I can\u2019t help them, but at least I can be with them in my mind. You know?",
        "Q: How much of a role in your daily life does that memory play? Is it there always with you every\nday?\n38",
        "A: Oh, I have to be thankful always, every day to my mother, to my father, give me life. They\ntaught me what\u2019s right and wrong. And they were good to me, really good to me, you know.\nYes, I think of them, in fact, I got their picture hanging where my bed is. To me, because we\nknow everybody has to die, period. But they got taken away this way, to me they are still the\ntwo young people, you know, my brother, it\u2019s different. Yes, it plays... they still, if you see your\nmother die or father. They\u2019re old, they\u2019re 80 years old and we know everybody can die. And\nthey get wrinkled. I saw them only as young people. You know, so maybe it\u2019s a difference.",
        "Q: You mentioned that it was maybe ten or 15 years ago that you really started talking about your...",
        "A: Because nobody wanted to listen.",
        "Q: What happened ten or 15 years ago that made you start?",
        "A: They came out with the Holocaust survival. They showed movies. People suddenly started\nrealizing, you know. And not only the other people. Jewish people didn\u2019t want to listen, too.\nYou know I speak about people. And you cannot speak when nobody listens.",
        "Q: Do you remember any particular events or incidents?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know it, because it\u2019s so many events, but suddenly something clicks.",
        "Q: I was wondering, just going back for a minute to the issue of when you became an American\ncitizen, and you talked about how important that was to you. You work a lot with young people,\nyoung Americans in your work and I was wondering if you see, if you see people as taking,\nyoung people as taking that too lightly... because I think, or taking it for granted?",
        "A: I speak to schools, a lot of the time, I get invited by a school. And the young kids. And I will\nsay, we don\u2019t give them enough credit. Surely they got now the pressure, they got now more\ndivorces, where parents go to work and it\u2019s harder. Surely when you have a little bit money, you\nsend them in private schools. But I will say, if you are open when you speak to them, they can\nabsorb as good as anybody else. But you need guidance, you know. We didn\u2019t have so many\nthings when I was, I tell you I wouldn\u2019t have done it. We didn\u2019t have drugs. I didn\u2019t even know\nsuch things exist, you know it. We didn\u2019t have a lot of things, so how in the world can I judge\nand tell them they are bad? They are not. My kids are good. Their kids are good. Sometimes\nyou are lucky. They hang out with the wrong people... you have to control it, which rooms they\ngo. You form only one opinion, but you have to trust your kids. And watch out with whom they\ngo. It is very important. And I will say it again, and if a child makes wrong, don\u2019t tell him he\u2019s\ndumb, he\u2019s stupid. Tell him that he made a mistake, but you\u2019re always there, because I know my\nmother would be there, you know. This way you don\u2019t break off the communication. I wonder\nsometimes how come all this homeless people come from, you know. Don\u2019t they have a family?\nDon\u2019t they... everything, you know? And I have no answer for it. You know.",
        "Q: You mentioned earlier that your children have been interested in Holocaust remembrance.\n39",
        "A: Yeah, in fact they belong to the second generation. How? It\u2019s the same thing, it\u2019s nothing what\nyou can change, but we can promote, you know, that people should listen what had happened.\nChanging, we cannot, because a lot of people don\u2019t even believe that such a thing existed.",
        "Q: Did you talk to them about your past, your experiences?",
        "A: Oh yeah, surely, my kids have very open minded, you can talk to them. You know, yes.",
        "Q: When they were children did you tell them about their...?",
        "A: Very little children, you can\u2019t, because you break their growing up period and you put something\nin it, what they will have a hard time. When you have formed your opinion, when you are grown\nup, then it 1s different. At least I feel about it this way. Not that I\u2019m right in everything. I\u2019m\nwrong in a lot of things.",
        "Q: Has that been something that they\u2019ve been particularly interested in learning about from you?\nDo they ask you a lot of questions?",
        "A: Oh, I can do nothing wrong. I am the greatest in their eyes. (Laughing.) No. No, if they have\nsomething, they ask me, you know. Or even Jessica, you know, she goes now... I have one\ngranddaughter, she goes to Berrington. She told me she would like me to speak for the class in\nBerrington, Illinois, you know. So, I think I got a lot of letters and all kinds of things from them,\nwhat they spoke about.",
        "Q: It must be very gratifying.",
        "A: It is gratifying, you know it. Especially when you don\u2019t expect a lot, then it\u2019s double gratifying.\nIf I would expect, then it\u2019s something different, you know. But I don\u2019t and it\u2019s double gratifying.\nMy youngest, she goes now to Purdue, she got accepted there.",
        "Q: Your granddaughter?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: How many grandchildren do you have?",
        "A: Seven.",
        "Q: And what are their names?",
        "A: Richard, Ben, then comes Jamie and Josh \u2014 we\u2019ve got a lot of J\u2019s, and Jessica and Jacob. See, a\nlot of J\u2019s. And there\u2019s my daughter, Janet. (Laughing.) You know, so we\u2019ve got a lot of J\u2019s.",
        "Q: Richard, Ben, Josh, Jacob, Janet, Jessica? No, not Janet.\n40",
        "A: No, Jessica and then we got Jacob and then we got the little baby, she\u2019s just born. She\u2019s one year\nold, name is Edie.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you want to add today?",
        "A: It was a pleasure to meet you. (Laughing. )",
        "Q: It was pleasure to meet you, too.",
        "A: You ask me all kinds of questions. What can I do, I don\u2019t know it. You know. Keep on doing\nthe good work.",
        "Q: One thing I didn\u2019t ask you about, I haven\u2019t quite figured out how to phrase the question, but it\u2019s\nSO impressive that you came with nothing to this country, not even being able to speak the\nlanguage. And how many, how many eye care stores do you own now?",
        "A: Five.",
        "Q: Five.",
        "A: We could have owned more, but we have to go slow, you know it. You know, and I did it more\nfor my kids, they are doing it now. I\u2019m only a, you know, checking... at 75 you can\u2019t do very\nmuch.",
        "Q: And you live in this very lovely house. So, it\u2019s just very impressive that you...",
        "A: Yeah, you know it is livable. My wife would like to move out. But I figure, you know, 75,\nwhere do I want to go, you know?",
        "Q: How do you, do you wonder about that or do you think about how it is that somebody can go\nfrom having so little to just building up so...",
        "A: Oh, some people got it even better. No, it is, in life, as I told you, you have to take risks. You\ntry to do good and be fair with everybody. You got friends, you know it. And when you have\nthis, they will support you. You cannot go through the world alone, you know it, you need\nfriends. You need family, you know. And then you take a risk and when you lose, you didn\u2019t\nlose everything, you made a wrong judgment. So as in life with the kids, I told them a lot of\ntimes, when you make a mistake, so you made a mistake. You know, pick yourself up and keep\non going, but don\u2019t brood on it.",
        "Q: I didn\u2019t ask you about your journey back. I know that you made a journey back to...",
        "A: Poland.",
        "Q: ...Poland. And you talked some about it in your videotape, but I wondered if you...\n4]",
        "A: Yeah, my kids, we decided we\u2019d take the kids, Janet. And they\u2019re always busy now. And\nBluma would live in Chicago. And Ben...",
        "Q: Whose idea was it?",
        "A: Well, I would say my daughters\u2019 more, because they want to keep on this relationship. More my\ndaughters, Janet and Bluma. So we lived in, I told you, in Germany. And my wife got a lot of\nrelatives still in Germany. So, we rented a car. Going to Poland, you don\u2019t get a car, because\nthey say they steal it. So, anyway we used all the relatives and we rented a car. We flew into\nFrankfurt, from there we went to Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia, why Czechoslo..., because\nAuschwitz is near the Czech border. And Czech, it was just liberated, you know, the Russians.\nAnd if you have money one time and want to have a nice trip, go to Prague. It\u2019s observed, the\nGermans didn\u2019t bomb. All the antiques are still there. It\u2019s a lot of culture. So anyway, we went\nto Prague. We stayed two days in Prague and then we went to Krakow. Krakow is near\nAuschwitz. We went to stay the night in Auschwitz, at Krakow, then we drove into Auschwitz.\nWe stayed all day long. And we had already made reservations in Warsaw. But we had a car,\nyou know, we drove. In Warsaw we made reservations at the hotel. And then from Warsaw, we\nmade all our journeys from there. First we went to Grodzisk where I told you.",
        "Q: What year was this?",
        "A: In 1992, I think or \u201891 or \u201892. And the kids, we went in the same house. You felt the hostility\nfrom the Poles, but give them a few dollars, it\u2019s okay, you know.",
        "Q: How did you feel it?",
        "A: First, they are afraid that you come here and you want to take the house away from them and all\nkinds of things. And then you, let\u2019s see, a lot of graffiti on the walls. You know, I still speak\nperfect Polish. So, I knew it. But if you win their confidence, at least they are not so hostile, you\ndon\u2019t trust them, but you are . So, and this lady, I told her all I wanted was to show\nmy kids where my mother lived, where my father lived, you know, and I give her a few dollars,\nso she spoke already different, you know. In fact, to be honest with you, before we left the first\ntime, you know, we had candle sticks, some silver. We didn\u2019t want to take it in Warsaw ghetto\nand they showed me where they buried it. But I saw the Poles, I didn\u2019t want them to risk myself\nto go take a look. They\u2019re probably not, but I didn\u2019t want to. So, anyway, we went to Grodzisk.\nShowed them where we lived. Showed them where my grandfather lived, where I went to\nschool. Oh, I made a lot of pictures, too, you know it. And then we went back to Warsaw. Next\nday we went to Piotrkow, you know it. And same thing, I showed them where the ghetto, and\nwhere we were. One thing what I couldn\u2019t bring myself in, to go in this room where my parents\nand my grandparents went out the last time. I told my kids, I can\u2019t go in, you know, somehow I\ncouldn\u2019t. So anyway, so we went there and we went back to Warsaw. And then we went to\nTreblinka, this is on the other side from Warsaw. And then we stayed there and then we went\nback to Germany. Went to Buchenwald, where I was liberated. And so we made our way home.\nAt least I showed the kids, that we still lived, we had an apartment. Really it was our house. You\nknow, we were still something. No doubt that we didn\u2019t come out from a rock. (Laughing.)\n42",
        "Q: Do you think this was important for your family?",
        "A: And for me and for them more, because I knew it. They didn\u2019t. Yes, it is very, very important.",
        "Q: Do you think they had a new, a different understanding of...?",
        "A: Not a new different understanding. They knew, they trusted me, they knew that I didn\u2019t lie. But\nit, seeing with your own eyes is different than imagine.",
        "Q: Was anything from that entire trip particularly important for you, personally? Did you come to\nterms with something?",
        "A: For me? For me was the worst thing was when I was supposed to go in that room, you know,\nwhere we lived, in the ghetto, in PiotrkOw. Couldn\u2019t get in, didn\u2019t go in. This sticks out.",
        "Q: Why that room in particular?",
        "A: In Piotrkow. And that is Fitarska (ph) ten, you know it\u2019s an address. And across the street, it\nwas high holidays in that time. And the people went over and cried and cried. I couldn\u2019t go in\nthere either, you know. This is what sticks out in my memory the most. You go to Treblinka.\nYou see all the rocks and all the things. It\u2019s cold. Here, you know, your mother got killed, but\nyou didn\u2019t see it visually, but the other ones, you know, I saw it. And when I went to\nAuschwitz, you know, and saw the crematorias there. I think I didn\u2019t have to see, I knew it. And\nyou saw the gate where everybody in Arbeit Macht Frei, you know.",
        "Q: Did you ever, I saw last time that you still have your tattoo. Did you ever consider having it\nremoved?",
        "A: Why would I remove it? I will have to die with it. To me, it is now an honor, you know. I will\nnot remove it.",
        "Q: Did people pressure you after the war to remove it or tell you that they think you ought to?",
        "A: No, no, nobody pressured me. In fact, if somebody would pressure me, I would tell them\ndifferent. No, no. They can\u2019t see me for my other side. I might not tell itin a harsh way, but I\ncan tell them in a nice way. Put them in place. No, it\u2019s my arm anyway in the long run.\n(Laughing. )",
        "Q: That\u2019s right. And do people comment on it, when they see it?",
        "A: Yeah, they saw it now. You see it on television. Now it\u2019s different.",
        "Q: Do people stop you to say anything to you after they see 1t?\n43",
        "A: It\u2019s most was when you speak to the kids, they\u2019re more sensitive. You know, you do not tell it in\na graphic way, because you do not want to hurt them. But they are more sensitive. They argue\nand it\u2019s honest. And otherwise you don\u2019t know it. You might question it or not, that\u2019s fine.",
        "Q: Okay, I\u2019m done. Do you have any other things you want to say?",
        "A: Listen I told you enough, to repeat again, I appreciate it and I like you for it, because you do a lot\nof things, which is good. Thank you very much.",
        "Q: Thank you very much.\nConclusion of Interview\nAd\n"

        "Q: This is an interview with Abe, Abram Jakubowicz. It\u2019s July 14\", 1999. And this is part of a\ncollection of interviews with Holocaust survivors living in Kentucky, sponsored jointly by the\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Kentucky Oral History Commission. The\ninterviewer is Arwen Donahue. And for this interview we are going to not go over all of Mr.\nJakubowicz\u2019s experiences from his Holocaust and pre-Holocaust years, because he has already\nbeen interviewed by the Survivors of the Shoah Foundation. That interview was conducted on\nFebruary 19\", 1996. So, we\u2019re going to just briefly summarize what was said in that interview\nand ask some questions to fill in and then we\u2019re going to go on and explore his post-war life in\nmore detail. This is tape number one, side A. Okay, so, you tell me if I get any of the facts\nwrong and Ill tell you what I have written down from your Shoah Foundation interview. You\nwere born... hmm?",
        "Q: Okay. You were born in Piotrkow, Poland on September 24, 1924. Grew up in Grodzisk,\nMazowiecki. Your grandfather Chaim Jakubowicz was the head of the Jewish community there.\nYou had one brother, Gershon, he was born in 1929.

        "Q: What was your mother\u2019s maiden name?",
        "Q: And we got your father\u2019s name and her name on the other interview. Okay, now you mentioned\nthat you went to high school in Warsaw. Is that correct?",

        "Q: Okay, so you were in Grodzisk.",
        "Q: Grodzisk. And you were there, living through the various restrictions that happened, that came\nalong with the German occupation of Poland?",
        "Q: Can you, you did describe your, some general things about your experiences in the Warsaw\nghetto in your interview, in your prior interview. But I wondered if you would say something\nmore about it, in particular something about your living situation there. Where did you live and\nwith whom?",
        "Q: Who, what was your house like? And who did you live with?",
        "Q: Was it a comfortable, living situation?",
        "Q: I was asking because I know that so many people were so crowded and it sounded like you had a\nrelatively...",
        "Q: And you kept going to school.",
        "Q: This was the same... let me make sure I understand. This was the same school that you had gone\nto before?",

        "Q: Did you have a goal of becoming an engineer at the time?",
        "Q: So you were, you also mentioned going to the movies and cultural life, I wondered if you\u2019d say a\nlittle bit more about that?",
        "Q: How did your family get money?",
        "Q: Okay, so you left the Warsaw ghetto after about three or four months...",
        "Q: ...when your family decided to separate and to escape.",

        "Q: Did you have... were you and Gershon very close?",
        "Q: I wondered, just speaking of your family, I want to back track a little bit, because I had wanted to\nask you, you mentioned that your grandfather was the head of the Jewish community.",
        "Q: Would you say something about your family history? Was there a long tradition of leadership in\nthe Jewish community?",
        "Q: Your grandfather?",
        "Q: Had your family been in that area of Poland, in Grodzisk, for a long time?",
        "Q: Yeah, I understand. So then on October 13\", 1942, the ghetto was encircled. And it was\nliquidated within one week.",
        "Q: And then the 2,000 people who worked in the glass factory were allowed to stay.",

        "Q: Right. About two months, two or three months later, it was decided that about 1,000 more Jews\nwould be deported.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you about that particular moment, because it was striking to me that this\ngendarme saved your life. Do you think he intended to save your life?",
        "Q: So, you didn\u2019t have a personal relationship with him?",
        "Q: So, he was certainly not sympathetic...",
        "Q: How did you feel at that point about the Germans in general? Were you getting a sense of what\nit was that they were capable of? The depths of...?",
        "Q: At that point, what did you know about Treblinka? Did you know...?",
        "Q: But you had heard that there was a extermination...?",
        "Q: So, your mother and your brother had already been taken at that point, to Treblinka.",
        "Q: Did you know at that point, were you certain at that point that they had been killed? Or was\nthere a question in your mind that they might still be alive?",
        "Q: After this gendarme took you...",
        "Q: ...took you out of the group, then you said in your testimony that the other 900 or so people who\nhad been gathered, were taken away.",
        "Q: Oh, you didn\u2019t? At that time?",
        "Q: So, you found that out. Did you find that out after the war? Or..?",
        "Q: So, the word spread fast.",
        "Q: You mentioned something I wanted to hear more about. That the role of the Jewish police in\nthis. Can you say more about that?",
        "Q: Going on with the summary. After a few days, you were among 20 boys and 20 girls who were\nsent to Tomaszow.",
        "Q: Mazowiecki. You were there a few weeks.",
        "Q: What were you doing there?",
        "Q: Where you made ammunition for the Germany military.",
        "Q: So, is this right? That was around June or July of 1943?",
        "Q: Tell me some more about your time in Starachowice. You didn\u2019t tell very much about that in the\nfirst interview.",
        "Q: Press out bullets?",
        "Q: In Starachowice...?",
        "Q: How did you find out what happened to Chaim Enischmann?",
        "Q: Say his name again?",
        "Q: Enischmann.",
        "Q: Why this... five particular boys? Did he chose you out or were you part of a group?",
        "Q: Speaking of religion, was religion a really important part of your life, up until that point?",
        "Q: This is tape one, side B of an interview with Abe Jakubowicz. You were saying about religion...",
        "Q: You mentioned that when the war started, that changed. Did your feelings about religion, about\nGod change?",
        "Q: Did you think about, I mean at this point, when the war is well underway... at the time you were\nin Starachowice, you were separated from your entire family. You didn\u2019t know whether they\nwere alive. Did you feel, did you think at all about your spirituality, your relationship with...",
        "Q: So, there wasn\u2019t the time or the experience for that kind of questioning?",
        "Q: Is there anything else you want to say about Starachowice?",
        "Q: Tell me again who this was? What nationality this person was?",
        "Q: So, you were deported with Enischmann and the five other boys?",
        "Q: So when you were deported from Starachowice to Auschwitz, you weren\u2019t necessarily with\npeople that you knew and were close with?",
        "Q: When you look back on that time, to me something that really is striking 1s that you had been... I\nget the impression you were such a close-knit family and your family was all depending on each\nother and counting on each other. And all of a sudden, you are thrust, you\u2019re just thrust into this\nindependent and solitary....",
        "Q: Uh huh. But it was almost, it was as if this whole different person, you became a whole different\nperson.",

She said, \u201cHe\u2019s a carpenter.\u201d So, this way they didn\u2019t ask\nquestions, just pulled me out. And I went as a carpenter. What was the carpenter work? It\u2019s to\nmake shelves in one of the buildings, Kompu-Stego (ph). And they bring from the old houses,\n5\nyou know it was about 20,000 people, 21,000 Jewish people. So they emptied everything and\nlater on they shipped it to Germany.",
        "A: No, I couldn\u2019t.",
        "A: Were liquidated, not deported. In fact there is now a monument, maybe you saw it, where they, I\ndon\u2019t know, six, 700 people, they got killed. They took all the people in the synagogue, you\nknow a lot of the kids, they got shot inside. It was really bad circumstances. You cannot\ndescribe it. After two or three days, you know, the screaming, they took us out and we were\nsupposed to be shot. And when they took me out, happened to be a gendarme, you know, a\npolice man, a German police man, whom I happened to work with. He says, \u201cHey, what are you\ndoing here?\u201d Like I volunteered. Kicked me out of it. You know, he would say, \u201cYou don\u2019t\nbelong here.\u201d",
        "A: He intended, yeah, because, a lot of the Germans, they go, \u201cWhat you doing?\u201d And he saw that I\nhad a job. See? Most of them, they were hiding out and they had no jobs and there was a lot of\nchildren. But he knew that I worked there. Not because he wanted to save my life, no. I didn\u2019t\nknow him so much. But he only knew that I worked for him.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t know this guy at all. But I remember his name, Meister Poltin. Yeah, he was a stiff\nman, was an older man, in fact, a day before, two days before, he shot a little girl. She was 17,\n18 years, because he thought that she stole a pair of stockings, you know, when they put these\nthings in. He shot her, so... no, he did not know.",
        "A: No, no. I didn\u2019t know him, no.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I knew. You know this didn\u2019t come overnight. When you saw it all the time, you\nknow what they did. And then when I was on the...when they took the people to Treblinka.\nAnd when somebody didn\u2019t go fast, they shot him. When an older woman couldn\u2019t move, they\nshot her. You saw literally corpses everywhere. You knew it. Despite what my parents,\nespecially my mother tried to keep me sheltered, but I knew it, you know. You cannot close...\n6\notherwise I wouldn\u2019t be normal. Yes, we knew it. In fact, a few days before they took\nTomaszow, they took already one. And they said to put him to death, put him to Treblinka. We\ncould still not believe it. Why would they take people and put them to death? So it didn\u2019t make\nany... you always, as long as you live, you have a little bit of hope that the people are lying. But\ndeep inside we knew it, yeah.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know it even existed. They only said they go in a place and I didn\u2019t know it was\nTreblinka. A place where the people get gassed. I didn\u2019t even know what place.",
        "A: Yes, there was an extermination camp. That\u2019s right. It takes people, and you know they bring\nthem there... how or what, its only main purpose to liquidate the people. A liquidation camp,\nyou know.",
        "A: Yeah, that was... you know, the date when they pulled me out, they went already there.",
        "A: It\u2019s always a question in your mind, but you know, certain things in life you know it 1s. It\u2019s\neasier to believe things what you would like to believe, even when we were there, we say, \u201cThey\ncouldn\u2019t do it. They didn\u2019t do nothing. What do you want to take so many people and kill them\nat the same time?\u201d You know? But it was true. But I didn\u2019t know. I knew it and I didn\u2019t know\nit, you know, because I wasn\u2019t there. But people talked about tt.",
        "A: Meister Poltin (ph), yeah.",
        "A: Eight or nine, later now I see it\u2019s seven you know it, because some of them got killed in there,\ninside and I didn\u2019t count them. You know I knew it was a lot. I did not know that they got shot.",
        "A: No, later on, when I came and they... we knew that they took them. Rakhov was a little bitty\nforest and they shot them.\n7",
        "A: No, right away when I was in the ghetto back. Because they always took other Jews to cover the\ngraves and everything. The Germans didn\u2019t do this, so they took somebody to do it.",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",
        "A: Jewish police was not angels. When they put me in the synagogue, the Germans didn\u2019t put me\nin, the Jewish police. The Germans probably told them we needed so many to put in and catch\neveryone. So, they did the dirty work for the Germans. It\u2019s like anything else, somebody wants\nto be very good and is a hundred percent, when they ask you. One thing you want to do ten\npercent better. Okay? And certain people, it is a matter of survival, they have to do what they\nhave to do. But they didn\u2019t do more. But certain people were bad. Jewish or not Jewish.\nMaybe they thought only this way they can survive. I don\u2019t know it. Certain people couldn\u2019t do\nit. You know?",
        "A: Tomaszow Mazowiecki.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Same thing what we did, what we did in PiotrkOw. We made shelving. Collected everything and\nthen we brought it to PiotrkOw. They called it sammische, sammische stellen (ph). That means\nthey brought everything together and they shipped it to Germany. When this was finished, they\ndidn\u2019t know what to do with us. Luckily for us, they sent us to Starachowice.",
        "A: That is right. As I said, called it Hermann Goering werk (ph). There was already a big factory.\nBut, I guess so, probably we did a good job. And then to be truthful, I think at that time, we was\nwatched by guys, other viklestande (ph) division. They were not so hateful, you know it. They\nwere young and we were young, so we talked. They weren\u2019t about to kill you. Maybe they put\nina good word. I don\u2019t know it, but anyway they took... because 40 people doesn\u2019t mean\nnothing... so we went to Starachowice from there.\n8",
        "A: That\u2019s right. Wait a minute, 1943? Yeah.",
        "A: Starachowice was a big ammunition factory. They made 1.5 though 15 millimeter... they made\n8.8 millimeter and 7.5 millimeter. From the beginning I worked there, where you know, before\nyou put it in the press. There is a hydraulic press. You have to make it very, very hot, so the\nhydraulic press can press it out, you know.",
        "A: Yeah, they pressed out only the shell. The bullets come later on, you know. But this was the\nshell what they made. Oh, they get cleaned and all kinds of things they would get. So, I worked\nthere and it was very hard and very hot. Luckily for me, I met a guy, his name was Chaim\nEnischmann (ph). And his brother was from the Jews, the head of the Jews. You know, that the\nGerman told him... you know it...",
        "A: Yeah, and this Chaim Enischmann, I didn\u2019t know it before, he... and there was four other boys.\nThere was five boys and he by risking his own life, he brought us always food in the evening.\nYou know it. Ironically, he never survived. Was a very, very good person. Only one from the\nfive boys, no, two. Is me and there was another guy. Heniek... I tried to remember his name,\nbut I can\u2019t. I saw him after the war. He went to Frankfurt and to college. He was surprised that\nI didn\u2019t go to college. But stupid Abe got married. (Laughing.)",
        "A: Chaim, what\u2019s his name, from him, from the other guy, he was with him together. Enischmann.",
        "A: Chaim Enischmann.",
        "A: Because his brother, had from the camp, from the Jewish side. And he worked, his brother\nworked in the kitchen. You know the older, when we came home, he made sure that we got\nsomething.",
        "A: Yeah, no, we slept together, you know when you go up on the benches and you sleep. Some of\nus slept together. And you know sometimes a chemistry from a person to a person. He didn\u2019t\n9\nwant nothing in return. He just wanted to help. He knew he cannot help more. He can\u2019t help\neverybody. The other four boys, probably he knew them from before, they already were from\nthere. And somehow he said, you know, \u201cI'll help you do whatever I can.\u201d In life, what I found\nout everywhere, you need a little bit luck, but other people will help you. You have to be in the\nright spot. And he just, you can say, it\u2019s God\u2019s will or not, if you are religious. And he really\nhelped me, you know, there.",
        "A: Religion was a very big point until 1939. You know, I was not... my father... you saw the\npictures from my grandfather, you know, he was religious. He had a beard, he had the traditional\nthing. My father, not more. But we went Saturdays to the synagogue. We ate kosher. You\nknow what kosher is? We Jewish people separate the milk from the, you know, you have to wait\nwhen you eat meat six hours after it. It\u2019s one way of hygiene or something. We did this. That\nwas... I knew what I was. Like some people maybe they would die for it. And if somebody\nwere to tell me, Abe, if tomorrow you are a Christian and you live, I would chose either side.\nYou know, it\u2019s like, you know, always like in Spain, when you had....\nEnd of Tape 1, Side A\n10\nTape 1, Side B",
        "A: Yeah, until then, you know, it did not, I knew where I belonged. I like to help the people,\nbecause I know what this is. But it was not later on, the main. I suffered because of it, but it was\nnot my main thing, you know.",
        "A: No, what had changed is that you couldn\u2019t go in the Synagogue no more. Because they caught\nyou, you know, they shoot you or they shot you or they did something to you or they beat you up\nif you was lucky. So, we were scared. So... it did not change. I believed certain... if you ask\nme now, I think God is for everybody. There is no such a thing about being closer or not. We\u2019re\nhaving to live together and if you try to separate yourself, you end up like in Yugoslavia. Can\u2019t\ndo it. There\u2019s not a Jewish God, there\u2019s not a Catholic God. It\u2019s a God, you know.",
        "A: Number one at that time, is survival. You want to survive, regardless. You want to survive.\nYou ask yourself, \u201cWhy me, oh Lord?\u201d You know. But you want to survive, you know it, that\u2019s\nall what it is. Like an animal, we become simply like animals, you want to survive. Only certain\npeople would do more to survive and certain people would do less, something different, but we\nall want to survive.",
        "A: No, we did not, no, there was not.",
        "A: In Starachowice, when we saw the Russians came too close, and there was already a train\nstanding. We did not know where we are going. We thought we all will be liquidated. So, we\nsaw a lot of them, maybe 50 people. So that... and we run always, you know, a place, and we\nrun away. I... some they went with machine guns. A lot of them got caught. I happened to be,\nbut I didn\u2019t get shot by the machine gun. And being there one night, two nights, you need to eat,\nyou have to get something. There was very big forest they called Lasisvindikshe (ph), very big\nforest. And then I came, I saw a hut standing there. And I thought \u201cOkay, I'll try,\u201d and I go in.\nAnd when the guy saw me, he said, \u201cHey,\u201d he said, \u201cJew. You\u2019re a, you know, really, you\u2019re a\nJew.\u201d \u201cWait a minute, because when the Germans come they will shoot me.\u201d But he went on\nthe street and he saw the German police. But this is military police, you know, they directed\nalready, you know it... brought \u2018em in. So Abe, now you\u2019re at the end of it. He says, \u201cOkay,\n11\nwhere did you run away?\u201d Listen, he didn\u2019t know it. I said, \u201cI was in this camp, and we all, we\nget, you know...\u201d He says, \u201cIt\u2019s good. I will take you there back.\u201d",
        "A: Pole. He was a Roman Catholic, or whatever it is, but not Jewish. And I went to the... so, they\ntook me in to... and luckily I told you this Enischmann. All day he talked... he says, \u201cOkay,\nwe're going now to...\u201d\u201d He knew already we\u2019re going now to Auschwitz. \u201cWhy now do you\nwant to shoot him? We take him with us.\u201d And then I went to Auschwitz.",
        "A: Yeah. But I was not with them. This is his process. I don\u2019t know what car they went, but we all\nwent to Auschwitz.",
        "A: No, you just, you are a number. You are not... it was maybe a hundred people in a train. You\nknow, maybe you thought you were... And they\u2019d say, \u201cGet out, get! Get! Get!\u201d You know, so\nyou were scared. No, I could not see him anymore in Auschwitz, either. Somehow I got away\nfrom them.",
        "A: Then it takes over something else. You want to survive to tell it to the other people. I didn\u2019t\ncare to survive, but they would tell me, \u201cListen Abe, you will survive.\u201d For one year, until it was\nfine. That such an atrocity happened. I owed it to my parents. I owed it to... it takes over in\nyour body, the will to survive. And if you have to crawl, if you have to eat something, you have\nto do it, you will do it. And when you are younger, you got a better chance. Say you stood\nnear... if they want to shoot somebody, it was you, it was you. There was not anymore... you\nknow. Sometimes it\u2019s luck, too.",
        "A: A whole, completely different person. But later on, it\u2019s a funny thing, when I was liberated, I\nwas the same me, you know.\n12",
        "A: \u201844, that\u2019s right. Because when the Russians came closer... yeah, it\u2019s a ballpark. I don\u2019t even\nknow it, but it\u2019s probably, it is. It\u2019s probably in the ballpark.",
        "A: Gypsy camp. They did not make selections, because they saw all these people worked and they\nneeded at that time, they needed workers. And a lot of Hungarian Jews came in that time and\nmostly they put them in D camp. So, since they didn\u2019t have any place, they put us for a while in\nthe Gypsy camp.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: You went out and you saw there was whole families living, you know it, and they had a curtain,\nnot a curtain, just a blanket, you know it. And here was this family, there was that family and\nthat was as far as the interaction. Because being there a few days, they liquidated all the gypsies\nin that camp. At night you hear the cars, you know, going back and forth, trucks taking them to\nthe crematory. But it was three days and I came over to the family and everything is fine.",
        "A: Oh yeah, sure. Yeah, we knew it. I knew if you wasn\u2019t their way, they exterminate you. But I\ndidn\u2019t know before that they took the Gypsies. You know, only when I was in Auschwitz, I saw\nthat they disappeared. I knew where they went.",
        "A: We spoke, yeah, we spoke, but that is it, as far as it went. In the first few days, we were in\nquarantine. We didn\u2019t go to work. We stayed there. You were afraid to go far. They catch\nyou....But yes, you get to talk to some of them. They said their son is on the front, works for the\nGermans, makes ditches, you know.",
        "A: No, nobody wanted it, nobody wanted it. Usually when you stand, you know, I worked that time\nbefore I worked in katowe bunker (ph), you know, where the potatoes was. And you had to,\nthere was two people, one in front and one in the back and then they filled it up. You lift it up\nand you go to other place, you know, and filled it, put it in there. Because mostly when they\ncame with the railroads, they dumped it. And I knew one thing, there was always selection going\non. There was selection to go in the crematoria if you didn\u2019t look good or if they didn\u2019t like you.\n13\nSo, you always watched out. Your eyes went the right way. Somehow I missed him. He was\nstanding in front of me. And he said, write down here the number. You know, my number what\nI got right here on my hand. He wrote it down and they called me out. I didn\u2019t know where\nwe'll go. You know, nobody wanted to work in two different places. Sonderkommando, where\nwhat the people burned them, you know it. And Canada, where you take the clothes. You told\nthem, \u201cOh you will live, and it\u2019s nothing,\u201d whole kind of thing, \u201cTake off, when you come out,\nyou will find it.\u201d You know, we had to take it away, and they sold it. But this meant a certain\ndeath, too. Say, sonderkommando maybe three months, the other one may be six months.",
        "A: Now, you had advantages, but you didn\u2019t want to, because you knew that you would be dead,\ntoo. And you always have that little hope, you know? They did not, they picked you, you didn\u2019t\npick them. They picked me out. And I said, \u201cOh,\u201d you know it. No, I didn\u2019t like it. I had a\nlittle bit of food, but then I had to watch out. Somebody would see me shoving it down my\nmouth, they would kill me, and all these things. But in a way, this food helped, but I didn\u2019t want\nto, no. So I was in Canada. It\u2019s like nobody wanted for the Sonderkommando.",
        "A: Friends what I knew only, I met them in the camp, but nothing else. Friends, but I slept with\nthem, but no, you did not have friends. You didn\u2019t have nothing. What binded with them, they\nall had a miserable life, but that was it. No, I did not have nobody. Some brothers stayed\ntogether, or even high management maybe stayed . I did not. Somehow I, I got\naway somehow.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, I felt later on when I saw all the deaths, that he was watching over me. In fact, the opposite.\nI always ask, you know, \u201cWhy me, oh Lord?\u201d You know, to have suffered. And a lot of people,\nyou know, they was weak, they grabbed the electric wire. If I had guts I would have done it, but\nI have no guts to doit. But no, no. Later when I see so many dead, I say probably God was\nwatching over me. This is what saying about God.\n14",
        "A: That is right. And there we stayed about two weeks, I think. And that was a quarantine, you\nknow, it was near Berlin. In fact, we saw, you know, we were in a station in Berlin and there\nwas bombing, all things. It was already going, you know, everything going strong.",
        "A: At first we went to Krauwinkle. Krauwinkle was a little small place, you know it? But then we\nhad to build this big place for all the people to come, because we built the tunnels, you know, in\nthe mountains. So Krauwinkle was, yes, Krauwinkle was a very, very small place.",
        "A: It all went fast, about a week, two. I remember it was so cold in the mountains, you know. I\nremember we had to go so far, to the mountains, to drill and do this here. In fact, at times they\ndidn\u2019t have a lot of SS guarding us \u2014 it was a volkstrom (ph), was an old man. Almost as old as\nme. And they guarded us.",
        "A: Yeah, when I was, late in... was it Ohrdruf or was it Krauwinkle? I had an SS guy ask me to\ntake care, really it was not to take care of the dog. Really it was to make chopped wood for his\nwife, if she wanted something to do, you know it. But beside there was a German Shepherd, he\ntold me to, you know, feed him too, and this was just caring for the dog. So he gave me\npermission to go in the SS kitchen, you know and pick up all the bones. But everything was\nedible, so you can imagine. I always got beat over by the dog. He gives him so much food, and\nhe\u2019s so skinny. . (laughing)",
        "A: Yeah, you got always a little. Not from him... the food what I got in the SS kitchen that I could\nsteal. Nobody gave you anything extra, you know. Extra you had to take. Was it in Krauwinkle?\nYou see he picked them... you know, in that time they told me, if you let yourself go, you don\u2019t\nwash yourself, you go down very fast. And I didn\u2019t want to go down fast. And also our hopes\nfor the war, it\u2019s winding down. I only thought they would shoot us before... you know it. So,\nprobably I was maybe cleaner like near the time. You know he said that I should take care...\nyou know, for his wife, and other things.",
        "A: Yeah, you go and, washings, you know, it was cold, but they want you to wash yourself, you\nknow it. So, what I did, I did. The other ones were afraid, you know, it\u2019s cold, they didn\u2019t want\nto, not all of them, ninety percent washed. It\u2019s only when your mind goes down, your body goes\nwith it. Your feet start swelling and you give up. You can know it. So in that time I didn\u2019t give\nup yet.\n15",
        "A: I still tried to maintain, you know, as much as I could to be clean, because otherwise they would\nput you in the selection, to the crematoria.",
        "A: No, no, no. We got, there was a shower, only you went in, you know, you were supposed to\nwash a little bit. It was not difficult. In fact they didn\u2019t want any sicknesses to break out either.\nThey cut your hair, pick lice all around your arm. No, I could wash, it was not that hard to\nshower, but they took us so we could wash ourselves.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, we started building the camp. The camp to Treblinka, no to Krauwinkle, we went\nand built the camp. And then they moved us over into the...",
        "A: That is right. The Americans came closer, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: I assumed it was Jewish prisoners, maybe not. It was Dutch people. I knew that they spoke\nDutch. And they dragged me in to Buchenwald.",
        "A: It was, if they could help me, I was too. Lot of times I was younger than an older man, if there\nwas something to do, I tried to do it, too. You tried, you know? You didn\u2019t lose your humanity,\nyou got a sense of survival, but if you knew it\u2019s a danger, you stayed away. But if you could\nhelp somebody you were there. Because I was, when I was in Ohrdruf, we went, there\u2019s a city\ncalled Arnstadt and we had to make ditches, because they laid cables. And there happened to be\na Jewish guy, much older, and he told me he was head of one of the Jewish bigger newspaper\nfrom Heit (ph). He told me, you know, and we talked and I tried to help him as much as I could.\nWhenever there is an older person with who his work was pen and pencil, wasn\u2019t as good at\nditch digging, you know, to dig the ditches. You know, and I was a young kid, and you learn.\nNot that I was better, but I tried to learn much better than an older person.\n16",
        "A: That is right. When they brought me to Buchenwald, they dumped everybody. No shower, no\nkind of thing. This guy came to me, this Kapo and he said, \u201cWhat you got? You got diarrhea?\nYou got stomach, you cannot control your bowel movement?\u201d I say, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s fine.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cGo in here.\u201d There was a place about five and I got on top, got the place he told me to lay\ndown...",
        "A: Ya, ya, so I was there, but I thought, my gosh, if I have to survive. Here\u2019s a death, here\u2019s a\ndeath, smells horrible. And I went down and I told the guy, \u201cHey listen, I\u2019m nice and clean, but I\ndon\u2019t really do such things.\u201d In the meantime always when, simples Juden ein treiden (ph), all\nthe Jews should go because they put them on march. I said, \u201cMy gosh, I cannot go, they have to\nshoot me, let them shoot me here.\u201d And I ignored it. And they needed a few clean people. They\nhad a small place where girls worked and they needed a few cleaners, because they wanted to\nkeep for the SS some woman, you know? So they put me in there and I was liberated there.\nThat place was a little bit cleaner.",
        "A: Oh, this was prisoners, but mostly they spoke German. But they was prisoners. But they keep\nthem, you know, as nurses for the people that worked there. But this was only to pretend, to\nshow, you know, it was not...",
        "A: That\u2019s right, part of a brothel.",
        "A: No, I was there in that time. I was really sick. Then Americans they say they come. And they\nprobably went, whatever it is. I don\u2019t know it. I would have had to invent it, but I don\u2019t know it.",
        "A: They were forced, ya, surely, yes they were forced.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t get up. I could really not... I was, when I came into Buchenwald I had already\ndiarrhea by myself. I had to run. And after a while if you have nothing behind, you get weaker\nand weaker. But I was... in fact after the liberation it took about six weeks, six months, until I\ncould learn to walk again. So, when the Americans came, I couldn\u2019t walk. They told me that the\nAmericans are there, but I... And there were two Polish guys with me. Got still some pictures\n17\nfrom them. They brought me a little bit food, they brought me that, you know it? They could\nmove better than I could. I couldn\u2019t move.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I remember, it was, you know it. But that was the eleventh of April. But probably a\nlittle bit later, but then you saw the people came and took pictures. You know, ironically today, I\nwent out with a guy on Shoah, he spoke as a liberator. And he came to Buchenwald one day\nlater that it was liberated. He\u2019s Mr. Knight, his son happened to be an opthamologist.",
        "A: Yeah, I went out today. He\u2019s 81 years, with his wife. And we went out to eat something. I say,\n\u201cHey you liberate me, I go and meet.\u201d",
        "A: I met him only... no, I met him when I went first time to Shoah. And he spoke how they\nliberated Buchenwald. And then I went to him. I say, \u201cHey, I was one what you liberated.\u201d So,\nI give him my telephone number and he gives me his telephone number. So, we happened to go\nout today.",
        "A: Once in a year, it\u2019s a memorial for the Holocaust survivors.!",
        "A: In Louisville, 1t\u2019s everywhere. And the last few times, he\u2019s always picked me, but you cannot\nalways pick the next, the same person to speak. First you hear it, and then it gets like old coffee.\nSo, last time, I didn\u2019t, they did it differently. But I had got to light the candle and all the things,\nyeah. And this guy spoke as a liberator from Buchenwald, but I didn\u2019t know him before, you\nknow. So, we went out today.",
        "A: Oh, it was nice, you know, my gosh. I only wished we came in \u2014 when I was sick and\nwas liberated, people came with cameras and the press and everything and made pictures. I wish\nI would find somewhere a picture from me, because I\u2019ve got at least thousands of pictures what\nthey made. But I didn\u2019t get it. I\u2019m still looking. My wife says, \u201cWhy do you watch it?\u201d I say,\n\u201cT want to recognize me somewhere.\u201d (laughing)\n' Yom ha Shoah, the annual Holocaust remembrance day.\n18",
        "A: Oh yes. He was as much interested as I was. He told me what he was, he was a platoon leader\nand he was in Weimar. Weimar is, I think seven kilometers from Buchenwald. So, he had to\nbuy some things, so he went with a jeep and drove in there and what he saw. You know, so we\ntalked about it, yeah.",
        "A: No. No, he\u2019s not, but you don\u2019t have to be Jewish in order to see it, you know?",
        "A: Oh, I did not stay in Buchenwald very long. I stayed maybe a month, or maybe three weeks and\nthen the next little, tiny city was Blankenheim. They evacuated schools and they put us in there,\nyou know it. I remember a room like this, who knows how many beds. And most of them, they\ngive bread to each one. It was plenty, but they didn\u2019t want to give, because they was afraid they\nwill die. So, she gave me bread and the other ones couldn\u2019t eat it. So sometimes I ate twenty\npieces of bread and... \u201cOh!, you will get diarrhea and you will die.\u201d I tell you I was only one\nfrom few that survived. I got the diarrhea and survived. (Laughing.) But I gained every week,\nabout five pounds. And they were all the meat... I couldn\u2019t walk. They had to teach me how to\nwalk and to go. So I was in Blankenheim. Ironically, now let\u2019s go farther, one of the doctors,\nDoctor Lucas, I met him later on in Frankfurt and he was head from TB hospital. And I had TB,\nso we became really close friends, you know, he always took care. I remember when he met this\ngirl and he want... you know, he told me, everyone around. There was a bond because he saw\nhow I was.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side B\n19\nTape 2, Side A",
        "A: Prisoner of war, that\u2019s right. And they got a lot of doctors, German prisoners of war, so his\nnurses, they were German prisoners of war.",
        "A: I say the German was responsible, but I didn\u2019t say that every German killed or a German hated.\nFact is, you know it, 1t was their , you know it. But I think there\u2019s some good and\nsome bad in every nation. And I believe, first, life is too short to hate. Secondly, I believe if I\nteach my kids to hate, somebody will hate them and it is a vicious cycle. The cycle has to stop.\nAnd my mother always told me, \u201cYou know Abe, if somebody throws a rock at you, throw them\nbread back. Take a piece of bread and throw them back, don\u2019t hate.\u201d You know, so I... even\nwhen I was liberated, I wanted to tell my story, but I didn\u2019t hate. It\u2019s wrong to hate, I can\u2019t. I\nthink that people what hate, they are born... as you see now in Yugoslavia, they take kids, for\ntwo year, throw them down , and the training, and the ditch. It takes a\nspecial person, but everybody can do it.",
        "A: I was angry, but I didn\u2019t hate. I was angry at the SS. I was angry, but never hate. I think they\nshould be punished, what they did, but not hated. In fact, my wife is German, you know. I say\nyou can\u2019t make everybody responsible for something. But then I would be the same thing like\nHitler, he said all the Jews are bad. Maybe some of them were. It\u2019s like now in Russia, I saw in\ntoday\u2019s paper, the anti-Semitism. Because they blame the Jews for what\u2019s going on now, and\nJews had nothing to do... there\u2019s only a few of them. The difference is, now the Jews have a\nway, they can run away. I couldn\u2019t. And I would run for my life, but I couldn\u2019t.",
        "A: Lucas.",
        "A: Yes, we talked a lot about it, because he saw and we became good friends. Certain things I tried\nto avoid, I didn\u2019t want to bring up things, you know, because I knew it will not help me and it\nwill not help him. He had already his opinion formed.\n20",
        "A: Oh, the cruelty, because he saw it. Why try to win if there\u2019s nothing there to win, you know?\nHe knew it, he saw it, so certain things I tried to avoid.",
        "A: No German will tell you that he agreed, they only got forced to do it. But I knew he got forced\nto do it, you know. He was too smart. He was not in the SS. He was a good person. Certain\npeople, even when you are good, you can\u2019t do nothing about it. He was good in my book. He\nwas a very nice person.",
        "A: You have to, otherwise, you become very bitter. I have a lot of friends, you know, friends from\nthere. They are bitter. And it doesn\u2019t help you really. And if I go around and be mean and\nmistreat other people, would my mother want me to see this way? No. So I have motive to show\nthat you are not the same. You have to be different. I am different. I would force myself more\nto be mean, you know, than that is my nature. You know.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I had, especially when I married my wife. They was against... they say, you know it,\n\u201cHow can you do it?\u201d I say \u201cListen, I go to them, they are very nice, they open the door. I\u2019m\nsick, so money doesn\u2019t play any part. I met the most beautiful person and now this married to\nme.\u201d . Here she was a young girl, good-looking, and at the time, I tell you the\ntruth, looking back now, I needed somebody. I really needed somebody. You know, I was not\nthe one what could live alone. You know it. And it was nice. And then when we went out. And\nI would be cruel and leave her. And only because she, it was nice. Then I leave her out. Then\nthe Germans later on will say... you know it. So it\u2019s again another thing, I would have to think a\nlifetime on it. And I tell you, we are 52 years married, we had all the kids college graduate. We\nnever had any problem about the religion, about other things. I think our marriage has evened\nout.",
        "A: Ya, this is where the Dr. Lucas was head of it, the TB Hospital.",
        "A: Ya, and then the Russians came in. And I couldn\u2019t stay with the Russians. They ask you why\nyou don\u2019t go home. They thought because I murdered somebody. You know, therefore I don\u2019t\nwant to go. I told them everybody got killed. So I away. There were a lot of\nJewish guys. We went to the railroad, we drove to Berlin, and from Berlin we drove to\nFrankfurt. You know we came over in the American zone.\n21",
        "A: I just thought everybody was dead. It was a cemetery. I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: You ask, that\u2019s true, you ask. In fact, when I came to Berlin and it was all the troops from\neverywhere, from Russia. And there was a guy, he exactly looked like my father. And I want to\nbelieve and I asked him. I just direct asked him, you know it. Surely it was not, but I wanted to\nbelieve it. You know, I didn\u2019t know it. I found out later on from people what were with him,\nthat he died in 1945 in Dora, you know, not far away from where I was. Maybe the mountain\nwas from the other side, but I didn\u2019t know it. He died in 1945, in the beginning of \u201845.",
        "A: I happened to be, you know, when you come after the war, you ask everybody. \u201cHey, you didn\u2019t\nyou see?\u201d \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d \u201cPiotrk\u00e9w.\u201d \u201cPiotrk6w? Did you know my dad?\u201d You\nknow, because in Piotrkow... and he said, \u201cYes.\u201d In fact, this guy, his name is Rappaport and he\nbecame a dentist in St. Louis. He\u2019s dead now, too. But I found out in Rupertstein (ph), he was\nsick on TB, too.",
        "A: I knew this all, this I knew right away. That the whole transport went to Treblinka. When you\nwent to Treblinka, it was death. And I knew this, so I didn\u2019t have to ask anymore.",
        "A: Yeah, right away after the war. In fact, I came late, because I was in Buchenwald, you know,\nand then I was in Blankenheim, in the hospital. So it was a few months after the war already. I\nwould say, we got liberated in April, maybe six months later, because I had to walk and I\ncouldn\u2019t walk right away. I got there about six months, seven months. Then it was awful cold\nand I didn\u2019t feel good. And I was coughing. And I got x-rayed and they told me, \u201cAbe, you\u2019ve\ngot TB. You better go to the hospital.\u201d",
        "A: I stayed in Rupertstein until 1947. No, \u201857, \u201857. I got married in *47.",
        "A: Ya, in town. I was in hospital maybe two, I would say to about a few months before I got\nmarried. End \u201846 or the beginning of \u201847.\n22",
        "A: No, you were sick. You felt good, TB doesn\u2019t hurt you. So all what in that time, now you got\npenicillin and streptomycin. In that time, all what could help you, so many people died... in fact,\na lot of people what I wasn\u2019t there was liberated, they died. You got to lay down and breathe\nfresh air. It was high in the mountains. They give you decent food, and that was it, you know.\nMother Nature in that time had to help. So certain people didn\u2019t make it... because a lot of\npeople years ago died on TB.",
        "A: Well, we went in the village. Really a lot of people weren\u2019t supposed to go, because there was,\nthey call it, plus and minuses. If you got the bacillus and you don\u2019t have it, but you still had TB.\nI could, because, you know... but a lot of people had it and went any way, because the Germans\nat that time would not stop you, you know. So, we went in the village. I got some... from\nUNRRA, United Refugees... anyway we got some packages and we traded. I couldn\u2019t eat, how\nmuch sugar can you eat? So, we traded for some different things, you know. Some had fruits.\nYou know, it was a village more, you know it, we traded with the people. We got coffee, you\nknow at that time coffee didn\u2019t mean nothing to me, but to them it meant a lot, you know.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: There was not anymore services. There was in Salzheim. When I was in Rupertstein, I was\nalone, you know, with a few other people. But I had, not a cousin, but a relative far away and\nhe... Windheim (ph). He was liberated. No, he ran away on papers that he\u2019s a Pole or\nsomething. So, we went, for the high holiday, he invited me. And we went to the synagogue.\nBecause there wasn\u2019t a synagogue really, in Frankfurt everything bombed out anyway. It was in\nthe Rochiltalay (ph) there was a meeting where you could pray. So, I went for the high holidays,\nbut otherwise all what you wanted really is to survive.",
        "A: When you are sick, you want to get well. And if that\u2019s not the goal, then you see, see a lot of\npeople, they survived and they\u2019re dying. But you wanted to survive, you wanted to live. I was\nonly 21 years old, 20 years old. But now I got surely, the will to live is very, very strong.\n23",
        "A: In my brain?",
        "A: You know, from the beginning when I got better, then you know, you want to live, you want to\ngo toa dance. You\u2019re still young. I met my wife and we got married, then you got children. So,\nmaybe I didn\u2019t start it from the right side, but sometimes time dictates it. You know, certain\npeople were different. They first want the career. I wasn\u2019t smart enough to do all that thinking.\nI become a child again. (laughing)",
        "A: How I met my wife? We knew a girl, a Jewish girl, and she was not quiet sick. So, they had a\nhouse, and were rented the rooms there for her. Her name was Lutia (ph). And she happened to\nbe from Lodz and my friend was from Lodz. We always went there to see how she was doing.\nNothing else, we want, you know it. So, when I came, I say, \u201cMy gosh, that\u2019s a good looking\ngirl.\u201d But then you forget a lot of things. Oh look at this, he has all . My wife... and\nat that time girls played hard to get. But when you talk a lot and you talk and you know... my\ngoal was, not to stay in Germany, having children and leave, maybe for Israel, maybe for the\nUnited States. But since I had TB and I was sick, Israel and the climate would have been very\ntough. I was supposed to come here in 1952, but my wife talked me out. She says, \u201cListen,\nthese people want to go. Look here we got the nice apartment. We got everything to eat. Why\ndo you rush so much?\u201d So, I gave in and in 1957... was Hungarian uprising in 1956. And I\nknew that\u2019s the last way I can get out, and still I didn\u2019t want to. But that\u2019s the way we got here.",
        "A: It was really not, because the Germans are very, very nice, even when what they think is\nsomething different. You learn to live with it. You know, if you have something, if you have a\nhunchback, you learn to live as a hunchback, you know. (Laughing.) You cannot go against a\ntrend. They was extremely nice. And then I thought I needed a trade. So, I went to work for the\nIG Farben. And they sent me to a school and they taught me, you know, about the way. So and\nthe people saw and I worked with them, that I was not different. I was not what they had told\nthem Iam. You know, so, no... in fact, when I was supposed to go to the United States, I told\nthem. They said, \u201cListen, we give you a year leave of absence and if you don\u2019t like it, you can\nalways come back.\u201d And they made an album and everybody wrote something nice in it. Iam\nnot a person what carries around hatred.",
        "A: Oh yeah. I knew it, because I told you, I saw the Zyklon B, and all the gas. In fact, near\nAuschwitz there was a, called Buna, they made gasoline from coal. And as far as I know it was\nconducted by IG Farben, too. Yes, I knew it, but I had to... when you have to live, you have to\n24\nlive. I want a trade, and then first things first. And then it\u2019s different. You cannot kill before\nyou're dead. (Laughing.)",
        "A: That is right. I worked there, because I wanted to learn a trade. I cannot work physically hard\nanymore and there was... they paid me good. They were extremely nice. They went out of their\nway. And sometimes you have to take advantage, later on, you cannot forget, but you have to\nlearn to forgive a little bit.",
        "A: Ya. And I didn\u2019t have to be ashamed then later on, you know. Yes, I told them.",
        "A: If it was, it was only behind my back. They wouldn\u2019t openly show it, no. Germans are different,\nyou know. See, a Russian, if he is, he tells you. And Germans will be very, very nice, you\nknow. The nicer they get, then you know you have to watch out. (Laughing. )",
        "A: Why would I be afraid? No, I wasn\u2019t afraid.",
        "A: In Germany now? I will say Germany now is different. I was there a few times. You got still a\nfew, but they are, but most of them, they\u2019re educated, they\u2019re adaptable, you know. They know\nit was wrong. They know what Hitler... the older ones. All 1t brought them 1s, they couldn\u2019t\nspeak, they couldn\u2019t do. Now, they have a nice country built. When we went to Israel, saw a lot\nof German tourists. They\u2019re interested. You know, sure they will always find... like anything\nelse, here too, people would relate. And no matter what, if somebody tells me he hates blacks, I\nknow right away he hates everybody, stay away, you know. And I know it. So, this type will\nalways hate and you know why? Because it\u2019s an excuse for their misery. They will not say it. I\ndidn\u2019t go to school because I was dumb. If the Jews would not go, I would go there. You know?\nIt is the same thing. What do you agree it is this way? It doesn\u2019t work the other way.",
        "A: No, no. \u201847, \u201848 I was still... you know, I just got married. I followed a little bit, you know, you\nalways, but no.\n25",
        "A: I was working in 1954, \u201855, \u201856 and \u201857. But I tell you a story, while I was working for IG\nFarben and now when I retired, the German government couldn\u2019t say I was not . You\nget the SS the war years, they had to give me the war years, and I got a nice pension from\nGermany. Beside being a Holocaust survivor, you know, because they had to give me all the\nyears. And they cannot say, \u201cHey, we give an SS man.\u201d Say yes, wasn\u2019t in the war, and while I\nwas in concentration camp, I don\u2019t get it. They had to pay me back so much. I said only I\u2019Il try,\nbut in this case they was very generous.",
        "A: Oh, it was good. They was not... really you know everybody can say, but then when you live so\nlong, you see the history. You know, they live in a little village, they minded their own business.\nThey never knew Jews. Maybe if they knew they would hate one, but they did not know, I know\nit.",
        "A: Oh ya, oh ya. They tried those, a lot of them German... they tried to excuse and they didn\u2019t do\nit. I know a lot of them didn\u2019t do it, but that\u2019s the way, what it was. Yes.",
        "A: We talked a lot about it, you know. But they was really, they maybe had to play the game, but\nnobody was in the Party. And ina small village, everybody will talk about you. In a big city,\nyou don\u2019t know it. All you had to do, is go to the neighbors and you know everything. You\nknow even what they cook.",
        "A: Yes, I was in the hospital with them. They were my age. A few of them, ironically, came from\nBlankenheim, you know, from... after we was liberated, they came with me in the same train and\nwe stuck kind of together. He found out he had TB and I had TB, so we were kind of, there was\na bonding. If you have nobody, your friends become your relatives. You\u2019re bonding, it\u2019s true.\nAnd we could speak openly, you know, that is their opinion. And I value their opinion. I don\u2019t\nsay that they were wrong. I really didn\u2019t know, maybe I was mixed up and didn\u2019t know what\nwas right or wrong.",

        "A: As little bitty as we could. It was not very much. We went only to the Justice of Peace. You\nknow. And he said, \u201cYou are man and wife.\u201d So, we made a little bit, what we could get at that\ntime. It was not very much. But it was... like the style you would say was very poor, but it was\nfine. I got the bride anyway. (Laughing.)",
        "A: Well, sure. My wife is not Jewish. And I figured with the kids, it would not be fair for me and\nshe would not make a good Jew anyway. It is only because to please somebody, like I would not\nmake a good Catholic. Doesn\u2019t mean that I hate the Catholics, by no means not. But my kids\ngot to choose what they want to. Like Janet, she goes always on the holidays she goes with me\nto the synagogue. And my oldest daughter, she lives in Barrington, in Chicago. She does a lot.\nAnd what I\u2019m mostly proud is that they\u2019re all involved in the Holocaust survivors, the second\ngeneration. They\u2019re active. It is not that they hate. It is not to let people forget, look here what\nhappens. You cannot make it back. I cannot turn the clock back. But we can let the people\nknow what hatred can do.",
        "A: No, I saw what people, if they become fanatic. And you start to put religion in front, then you\nlose your sight. You have to first see, and really what\u2019s good when you are religious and go pray\nand don\u2019t live up to it. I call them the hypocrites. So you have to have it in the heart and nothing\nelse. And nobody can force you to be something. If you don\u2019t have it, you don\u2019t have it.",
        "A: Because I didn\u2019t want my kids to be exposed anymore. And truthfully, very truthfully, I didn\u2019t\nwant them to get married there and be there, you know? I wanted them really to get away. That\nis really my, to give you the best answer what I know, really.",
        "A: Yeah, but, I feel trusting, but if you get wounded, a scar is there. Okay? I had the scar. But that\ndoesn\u2019t mean that can function perfect yet. You\u2019ve got now a lot of Jewish people that come\nfrom Israel, even, they live, and a lot of them from Russia. You know, but for me, was too much\nexperience and I didn\u2019t want to rub salt in the wounds. You know, I want to stay away. Maybe\nit was the easiest way out. I don\u2019t know it. This is just what I felt, you know.",
        "A: It is still very important to me. In order to clear the air, you have to get everything on the table\nand then you can go on. If you play a game, it will be still there. Can\u2019t do it. So, yes it is fine.\n27\nIn fact my wife now, \u201cWhy do you watch all that?\u201d I say, I still have to watch it. It brings back\nbad memories, but you still have to go on, and not forget it.

So you know, this was the... you have to do it,\nwhat you have to do.\n* Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation.\n29",
        "A: It was. It was for me and it was for the other people, too. You know it. Because, you know, it\u2019s\nreally nothing to make you happy, basically, and nothing to be proud of, you know, it\u2019s part of\nwhat you went through. And you have to do it. I told myself in concentration, if I survive and I\ncan do something, I will go out and not tell the people, I will scream to the people. But the real\nworld is different.",
        "A: Ya, my oldest one.",
        "A: Bluma, is after my mother\u2019s name. Yeah, she was born in 1948. In July, no in June. And my\nson is born in July. His name is Ben, you know it, and he was born in July, in 1954. And Janet,\nthe youngest is when we came to the United States, my wife found out she is pregnant and then\nJanet, she was born here. That was in 1957.",
        "A: To get away and to be a free person, you know. To be free. I knew always. The United States,\nsure there\u2019s people like KKK, you know, but most people, they are not from here, they\nunderstand if somebody is nice to me, what do I care if he\u2019s an Arab, or but he\u2019s nice\ntome. Like my neighbor, Scotty, you know it, we\u2019ve already forty years to go. And we always\nused to go, when we were younger, together out. You know, so, it\u2019s too much of a mixture to\nundo it. And in Europe, you\u2019ve got only two religions. Say, go to Ireland. It was Catholic, only\none is Roman Catholic and the other one is Protestant and they hate each other, you know. So\nwhen you got a minority, you know, it\u2019s only two, always will be the same thing.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, people understand different culture, that\u2019s right. People are more tolerant.",
        "A: Israel appealed to me very much, but first thing, you know, I was too sick. I would have to stay\nmuch longer and then go to Israel. And I knew in Israel I would have to work much harder and\nthat the climate is much more, you know, it\u2019s warmer and hotter. So, if I had, had another\nchoice, I would go to Israel, yeah.",
        "A: My wife really wanted to stay in Germany. And I told her about the kids and everything. She\nsays, Okay, then we try and if I don\u2019t like it, you can always go back. The worst thing in life is\nwhen people don\u2019t try. And you don\u2019t know, you don\u2019t know your potential. You don\u2019t know\nnothing. You have to be willing to take risk and try in your life. And if it didn\u2019t go right, don\u2019t\nblame nobody. Pick up the pieces and keep on going. But that\u2019s life things.\n30",
        "A: Yes, I had relatives, but they was very, very far, you know. From my grandmother, had a sister,\nthey lived in Philadelphia. And when we came there, they were so nice and they tried to help\nyou. But really, what you can help, is help yourself by doing... you know. But they were nice,\nin fact, we correspond a lot, a long time. He just died, he was 88 or something, you know, you\nget old. He had two children. In fact, his daughter came to visit us, you know. I got now\nrelatives. I got a cousin and he came from Israel. But still , from my grandmother,\nshe had another sister and she went to Israel. The name was Goldstein. And after 1947, he\nwanted to study engineering here in the United States. And he really told me in his mind was to,\ncooling systems, because they need... but when he came and he studied here, he went to\nBerkeley. He got approached by the Bechtel Corporation, if he wanted to take atomic\nengineering. He said, I don\u2019t know nothing about it. They say, we will put you through college\nand everything. So, he went and studied atomic engineering. In fact, he is now, he\u2019s built so\nmany reactors, and you know? And then he taught at Berkeley too for a while. But even\nnowadays, retired... his name is Golan (ph) now, from Goldstein changed. He still likes\n, like... when it was in Russia, when the explosion was in the, what was name is it?\nThey went there to see what they can do.",
        "A: Chernobyl, ya. So they still, like last week, he went to Paris, they have all this, scientists. In\nfact, two months ago we went to visit him. He lives in San Francisco.",
        "A: Simcha. Simcha in Jewish means happiness and the last name is Golan from Goldstein. Ya, he\nwas here visiting. You know, it\u2019s family, so we stay close.",
        "A: My grandmother had, she was the oldest and she had five sisters. And one went to the United\nStates, one went to Israel. One, she lived in Lodz and went together in the same train with my\nmother and my grandmother to Treblinka. And she left a son, he ran away. She had a few kids,\nbut they all went together. He survived and he lives now in New York. And one lived in\nWarsaw with the , he was Rudja (ph), he was the youngest one of them. From these\ntwo, later on when you have no family, you look and whatever you can find.",
        "A: I knew quite a bit, but what you knew as a boy, it\u2019s completely different, you know. I read Jack\nLondon and had dreams and all kinds of junk, you know it. It\u2019s completely different. But later\non, I thought you know it. A place if I would like to go. I would like to go really to the United\nState. And we spoke fairly a little bit English already. We knew more than the average. When\n31\nwe needed some oil, we could buy oil and we didn\u2019t come home with vinegar. (Laughing.) You\nknow, ,",
        "A: Yeah, she didn\u2019t speak very much, but we understood. We took lessons. We prepared ourselves\na little bit, because we had time.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, I told you, I wanted to go in chemistry. But most of them, like here when I came, they\ncouldn\u2019t hire me, because I was a citizen... I was not a citizen. So, I got my first paid job for a\nperson who made glasses. For a dollar an hour, and then it worked out and I liked it. Now, we\ngot the 20/20 Eye Care store. We\u2019re doing very good. If you feel you like it, you try it. And if\nyou don\u2019t succeed, try it again, get stubborn.",
        "A: It was always... oh! When I got my first paycheck and, you know, you are not spoiled. And you\ncan buy so many things. And it\u2019s a free world. We lived on, you don\u2019t know it here, St.\nCatherine Street, you know it. And you hear the bells from the church ringing. And the\nsunshine\u2019s nicer when you like it, you know. And we lived near a park and we took the kids to\nthe park. It was nice. Yeah. We loved it right away. Even if we didn\u2019t have nothing, but we\nloved it.",
        "A: I was first in Philadelphia. And in Philadelphia I didn\u2019t like it, only because my wife got\npregnant, was pregnant. In Germany we had the best hospital, the best everything. And since I\nworked for IG Farben, I could get anyplace, you know it, they had always. And we had a nice\nhome. So it was an adjustment. Like the garbage emptied only one time in a week and was\nstanding around. And we was in a hotel, very old. The Gladstone (ph) Hotel, I remember this.\nWe was maybe on the 17 or 20\" floor, but when you want to see what kind of weather, you have\nto open the window, everything was dusty. I didn\u2019t care for it, particularly, but... I had this one\nfriend, Colrink (ph). And he says, \u201cAbe, if you want to come here, I\u2019m working for Ford Motor\nCompany. I can get you there ajob.\u201d So, I came to Louisville. First I came and I said to my\nwife, \u201cIf I get the job, I gave you and, you know, call you up, and you come with the kids.\u201d Well\neven then you don\u2019t react. You\u2019ve got all this luggage, pregnant, two kids, you know,\n. But that was what we did. So we stayed in... we came over here. We rented an\napartment. And here it was different. It\u2019s a smaller city, everything was organized. I worked for\nFord Motor Company and at that time made about 100 dollars a week. My gosh, I could for ten\ndollars, load up so much groceries I couldn\u2019t even carry it, you know. So.\n32",
        "A: I didn\u2019t even know that Louisville exist. No.",
        "A: No, I did not. No, I did not. But it\u2019s still a nice city. People are nice. I like it. In fact, my\ndaughter, she went to Lexington. She went to Law School. She went to Lexington.",
        "A: No, you took later on. From the beginning, you couldn\u2019t even tell nobody. People wouldn\u2019t\nunderstand it. They thought that you are freaks. They tried to stay away from you, you know it.\nYou didn\u2019t act like the people here. In fact, it was hard on the kids, too, you know. We didn\u2019t\nspeak any perfect English, you know. It was hard, but we knew that we would catch up. First\nyou have to have a footage and then you get time. No, not from the beginning, but later on,\nyeah.",
        "A: When I saw... I went to the Jewish Community Center. We took the kids. Later on when I quit,\nnot I quit, they quit me from Ford Motor Company, because they laid off the whole second shift.\nAnd I went to work for dispenser Eli Jaffe (ph). He was Jewish, so I could at least speak with\nhim. How well you can speak to somebody else. So, it takes, it\u2019s a slowly thing. It doesn\u2019t\ncome overnight. It does not, you know. And then you didn\u2019t want to offend nobody. You didn\u2019t\nknow how the people would react, you know.",
        "A: If you don\u2019t tell, nobody will ask me. And I didn\u2019t tell from the beginning. It\u2019s only the last,\nyou know, about ten years ago. No, we went, ten years, we went to Washington. Holocaust. So,\nmaybe about 15 years, yeah.",
        "A: Ya, I came involved. But still, they in that time didn\u2019t want to hear it either. In order to find a\nlistener, somebody has to listen, you know. So, until later on when they found out that we are\nnot lying, that such things exist. A lot of people didn\u2019t want to believe that such exists, you\nknow. So, it took a while. I don\u2019t know how long. But I know it took a long time, you know.\n33",
        "A: No, no. In fact, when you interview people now, they will tell you the same thing. They had a\nvery hard time to communicate with them, you know it. Because you was different. They had\ntheir problems, they didn\u2019t want to hear my problems, even it was not a problem no more. Still\nsooner or later, you know... it was not overnight.",
        "A: It was not. Somewhere, I\u2019m already better than 90 percent, because I\u2019m easy trusting, so I have\nno problems. But a lot of them, they couldn\u2019t trust, they still cannot trust. And in fact, I cannot\nblame them. They are different.",
        "A: Yeah, that was the first, you start to look for somebody what you got something in common.\nAnd people what came mostly, you know, we call them the greenah (ph). You know the green\npeople. That was the Holocaust survivors who are, you know. And then you want to show to the\npeople that you aren\u2019t a loser. That is not true, what they said, you know. Then you try to work\nharder than the other one, you want to be better than the other. You try to... you know it. The\nkids didn\u2019t understand it, but it was true.",
        "A: Not between the other ones, no. Between... I try to prove to the other world, that I am not really,\none what they think I am, you know? And then you\u2019ve got a guilt feeling too. They think, \u201cMy\ngosh he survived, how many people did he kill in order to survive? How come the other ones\ndidn\u2019t survive and he survived?\u201d So, there was a guilt feeling, too, you know. How come I\nsurvived?",
        "A: I judged myself and other people judged me, too, you know it. I must have been very bad, when\nthe other ones didn\u2019t survive and I did, you know. So, you got the double whammy. (laughing)",
        "A: No... they lived here and they tried to share, it was a little bit longer than I am, where they shop,\nand then we bought some records, from old country. Yiddish. I still like to listen to them, you\nknow, and we formed a world within ourselves. But you cannot live in this world, because there\nis no walls. And certain people they still live with it, you know, they don\u2019t speak much English.\nThey don\u2019t trust other ones. And in this case I did much, much better than the other ones.",
        "A: Right, through the Jewish community center. And then when one found out, he told the other\none, so you knew them right away. Word got very fast out.\n34",
        "A: Oh, we went to the Jewish Community Center, for example, you met them there. And if you\nliked somebody, you invite them to your house or they invite you. You cannot like everybody\nthe same way. God didn\u2019t meant it to be this. You know? Somehow the chemistry has to\nmatch.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I could read the paper and I read the paper. And I was completely on their side, you\nknow it. Because it\u2019s more than fair, those people. In fact, I found out then, the German\nprisoners of war could go in places where they couldn\u2019t, when they were fighting for the United\nStates. To me it didn\u2019t make sense. Oh yes, and the one thing about our kids, we do not hate,\nyou know.",
        "A: The Jews had the advantage in this case. Because a lot of them don\u2019t look like blacks, so they\ndon\u2019t judge them, you know it. So, if they want to beat up, it was first the black and then the\nJew. They didn\u2019t hate him, they didn\u2019t like him, but they didn\u2019t know it, you know, what you\ndid. So... . Yes, if somebody will come to you and tells you, \u201cI hate blacks,\u201d you\nknow automatically he will hate you. Or somebody, I hate something for some reason, then you\nknow this man or this woman put their mind on hating or looking for excuses, because they are a\nfailure and therefore they hate. There is no reason. If you want to be, it is an open country, you\ncan do much better, work harder. We came in \u201857, you know. In 1960, we bought the house.\nWe worked hard. We couldn\u2019t maybe have afford it in that time, oh I could afford later on might\nbe, but it doesn\u2019t mean the kids... you know. But, and if I say \u201cOoh, I\u2019m living a lifetime here\nand can\u2019t afford it.\u201d Yes, if you go out and spend your paycheck, then you can\u2019t afford it. You\nhave to know it, what you got, and then they have a goal, what you want to . Dol\nwant to go and drink it away or do something, you know, you can do it. You have to balance\nyour money.",
        "A: Really, really, no, you know. At first here where I live there is no Jewish people. No, I did not,\nto be truthful, no. And in business, where I had a Jewish boss, or here when I do this. I tell\nthem, you know, I\u2019m Jewish. But they work for us, so I don\u2019t think somebody would go out\nand... no. But we treat them right. If we don\u2019t give them a choice to be not to. You know, we\ngive them health care, and a lot of things. I know what it means to make a very dedicated\nemployee. There is no one way street. You cannot exploit somebody and tell them I\u2019m your\nfriend. It doesn\u2019t work.\n35",
        "A: No. I lived on St. Catherine Street, which wasn\u2019t a Jewish neighborhood. I tell you the truth.\nSometimes it crossed my mind, why don\u2019t you go move near the Jewish Community Center. But\nthen I thought, you know what, sometimes it 1s better when you stay away, even when you go up,\nyou climb. The higher you go, the more you can observe. You know it. So I say if I want to go,\nI can go there, I don\u2019t have to live there, you know. Back in the ghetto, they created their own\nghetto.",
        "A: It\u2019s a very nice state. And you got equal opportunity and it is not like a Southern state, now I\nknow more about states. People are different here.",
        "A: They\u2019re more tolerant. They\u2019re much more tolerant. Sometimes in life you develop, something\nwhat you can judge already, called instinct. I might not be always right, but sometimes my\ninstinct is right, you know. So, I know it is in there. If I go to New York, hustle, bustle, too\nmuch running, going to work so long and coming home, you have no time to spend with the\nfamily. Here you are right close to everything, you have more time to spend with the family, I\nthink. To bring up children, regardless, Louisville is a nice city.",
        "A: Yeah. We got stores, you know, but this is stores, but otherwise, yes. We go in state and out of\nstate. Yes, we do a lot of things. But sometimes I combine my work, you know. We got in\nElizabethtown, a store, we got in Litchfield, a store, we got in Jeffersonville, a store, you know.\nWe\u2019ll go around and, you know, talk with the people. See, I\u2019m 75 years old already. Have to be\nthankful for a lot of things.",
        "A: I enjoy my freedom. It is not so much the work, as I enjoy talking to people. And this what I\nlike about uptakes (ph), you try their glasses, you can talk to them. I always enjoy talking to\npeople.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: In fact, yes, a few times. Some of them came when I had, told them I\u2019m speaking, if you want\nto... And everyone knows everybody and we got a lot of black people, they got to high\npositions, and they\u2019re doing good. To me, it is a person. Because we got here in Fern Creek one\nand he is a very good employee. And my wife says, \u201cWhy do you take the ;\n36\nand unfortunately people are prejudiced.\u201d I said, \u201cYou know I came from Poland. They hated\nthe Jews, but every Pole had his own Jew.\u201d You know, they come and ask more for them, they\nask for me. You know, they\u2019re good. What does they care, when they go out, and they see the\nglasses is good and he\u2019s nice to them, after a while they forget it.",
        "A: If you want to go this way, they all will be nice, but I know deep inside, you know what, I don\u2019t\ngive them a chance not to be nice. I\u2019m very nice to them.",
        "A: Some yes, some of them didn\u2019t, don\u2019t even know the subject. We\u2019ve got a lot of young kids, 20,\n25, you know, you cannot put it up on them anyway, even if I would want to, you know.\nThey\u2019ve got their struggles. They\u2019re married. Especially now, when two people go to work.",
        "A: I saw it on television and I thought so. And they know my feelings, they will come and tell me,\nyes, you know. But otherwise I will not go there. If they do not approach me, I will not\napproach them.",
        "A: Oh, very, very nice. People are different, you know, they got their own struggle. And they see\non television what you went through and now you\u2019 ve got the Bosnia and you\u2019ve got this. So,\nyou know it. And now you\u2019ve got in Russia, you\u2019ve got a powder keg, too. You know, so.\nEnd of Tape 2, Side B\n37\nTape 3, Side A",
        "A: After being five years here, exactly, you know it. We came in \u201857, 1962. Yeah, we didn\u2019t wait\nvery long.",
        "A: Very, very much. Now you feel, you saw this, yesterday, Kruschev\u2019s son became an American\ncitizen. And they asked him about it. He said it is a big honor. So, me a poor, Jewish guy got it,\nit\u2019s a very big honor, yes. You know, yes.",
        "A: I felt like I am a part of the family. The circle is now getting closed. What\u2019s gone, you cannot\nforget it, but now I\u2019m a part of everything. I\u2019m a citizen. I represent the United States and I\nknow I will make a good citizen. I knew it at that time, you know it. I think I made a very good\ncitizen, you know. We\u2019re involved in a lot of things, you know, so we\u2019re doing it. We\u2019re paying\nback to society, too. You have to and it\u2019s much nicer to pay back than receive, much nicer.",
        "A: Yeah, if you need everything, all what you see, the things what I need. But you never see the\nreward, you know, in giving. That\u2019s why I always say the poor has one thing that he can afford.\nYou know, the reward of giving. And giving is very, very important. We got raised even as a\nchild, you know, that you have to collect more to help the other ones. We call it Schtucka (ph),\nyou know it. So to me it 1s you, it is always you are there. If I were to take a\njob for an hour, for a dollar an hour, I\u2019m ordered not to get it. You know. Because I saw there\u2019s\nother people that need it more. You know, but it\u2019s nice, a good feeling.",
        "A: High holidays?",
        "A: No, any other time, no, but the high holidays, I\u2019m going. And the main thing what I\u2019m going to\nis because that they have a prayer for the death, you know it. And that\u2019s the only one thing, I\nknow that I can\u2019t help them, but at least I can be with them in my mind. You know?\n38",
        "A: Oh, I have to be thankful always, every day to my mother, to my father, give me life. They\ntaught me what\u2019s right and wrong. And they were good to me, really good to me, you know.\nYes, I think of them, in fact, I got their picture hanging where my bed is. To me, because we\nknow everybody has to die, period. But they got taken away this way, to me they are still the\ntwo young people, you know, my brother, it\u2019s different. Yes, it plays... they still, if you see your\nmother die or father. They\u2019re old, they\u2019re 80 years old and we know everybody can die. And\nthey get wrinkled. I saw them only as young people. You know, so maybe it\u2019s a difference.",
        "A: Because nobody wanted to listen.",
        "A: They came out with the Holocaust survival. They showed movies. People suddenly started\nrealizing, you know. And not only the other people. Jewish people didn\u2019t want to listen, too.\nYou know I speak about people. And you cannot speak when nobody listens.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know it, because it\u2019s so many events, but suddenly something clicks.",
        "A: I speak to schools, a lot of the time, I get invited by a school. And the young kids. And I will\nsay, we don\u2019t give them enough credit. Surely they got now the pressure, they got now more\ndivorces, where parents go to work and it\u2019s harder. Surely when you have a little bit money, you\nsend them in private schools. But I will say, if you are open when you speak to them, they can\nabsorb as good as anybody else. But you need guidance, you know. We didn\u2019t have so many\nthings when I was, I tell you I wouldn\u2019t have done it. We didn\u2019t have drugs. I didn\u2019t even know\nsuch things exist, you know it. We didn\u2019t have a lot of things, so how in the world can I judge\nand tell them they are bad? They are not. My kids are good. Their kids are good. Sometimes\nyou are lucky. They hang out with the wrong people... you have to control it, which rooms they\ngo. You form only one opinion, but you have to trust your kids. And watch out with whom they\ngo. It is very important. And I will say it again, and if a child makes wrong, don\u2019t tell him he\u2019s\ndumb, he\u2019s stupid. Tell him that he made a mistake, but you\u2019re always there, because I know my\nmother would be there, you know. This way you don\u2019t break off the communication. I wonder\nsometimes how come all this homeless people come from, you know. Don\u2019t they have a family?\nDon\u2019t they... everything, you know? And I have no answer for it. You know.\n39",
        "A: Yeah, in fact they belong to the second generation. How? It\u2019s the same thing, it\u2019s nothing what\nyou can change, but we can promote, you know, that people should listen what had happened.\nChanging, we cannot, because a lot of people don\u2019t even believe that such a thing existed.",
        "A: Oh yeah, surely, my kids have very open minded, you can talk to them. You know, yes.",
        "A: Very little children, you can\u2019t, because you break their growing up period and you put something\nin it, what they will have a hard time. When you have formed your opinion, when you are grown\nup, then it 1s different. At least I feel about it this way. Not that I\u2019m right in everything. I\u2019m\nwrong in a lot of things.",
        "A: Oh, I can do nothing wrong. I am the greatest in their eyes. (Laughing.) No. No, if they have\nsomething, they ask me, you know. Or even Jessica, you know, she goes now... I have one\ngranddaughter, she goes to Berrington. She told me she would like me to speak for the class in\nBerrington, Illinois, you know. So, I think I got a lot of letters and all kinds of things from them,\nwhat they spoke about.",
        "A: It is gratifying, you know it. Especially when you don\u2019t expect a lot, then it\u2019s double gratifying.\nIf I would expect, then it\u2019s something different, you know. But I don\u2019t and it\u2019s double gratifying.\nMy youngest, she goes now to Purdue, she got accepted there.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Seven.",
        "A: Richard, Ben, then comes Jamie and Josh \u2014 we\u2019ve got a lot of J\u2019s, and Jessica and Jacob. See, a\nlot of J\u2019s. And there\u2019s my daughter, Janet. (Laughing.) You know, so we\u2019ve got a lot of J\u2019s.\n40",
        "A: No, Jessica and then we got Jacob and then we got the little baby, she\u2019s just born. She\u2019s one year\nold, name is Edie.",
        "A: It was a pleasure to meet you. (Laughing. )",
        "A: You ask me all kinds of questions. What can I do, I don\u2019t know it. You know. Keep on doing\nthe good work.",
        "A: Five.",
        "A: We could have owned more, but we have to go slow, you know it. You know, and I did it more\nfor my kids, they are doing it now. I\u2019m only a, you know, checking... at 75 you can\u2019t do very\nmuch.",
        "A: Yeah, you know it is livable. My wife would like to move out. But I figure, you know, 75,\nwhere do I want to go, you know?",
        "A: Oh, some people got it even better. No, it is, in life, as I told you, you have to take risks. You\ntry to do good and be fair with everybody. You got friends, you know it. And when you have\nthis, they will support you. You cannot go through the world alone, you know it, you need\nfriends. You need family, you know. And then you take a risk and when you lose, you didn\u2019t\nlose everything, you made a wrong judgment. So as in life with the kids, I told them a lot of\ntimes, when you make a mistake, so you made a mistake. You know, pick yourself up and keep\non going, but don\u2019t brood on it.",
        "A: Poland.\n4]",
        "A: Yeah, my kids, we decided we\u2019d take the kids, Janet. And they\u2019re always busy now. And\nBluma would live in Chicago. And Ben...",
        "A: Well, I would say my daughters\u2019 more, because they want to keep on this relationship. More my\ndaughters, Janet and Bluma. So we lived in, I told you, in Germany. And my wife got a lot of\nrelatives still in Germany. So, we rented a car. Going to Poland, you don\u2019t get a car, because\nthey say they steal it. So, anyway we used all the relatives and we rented a car. We flew into\nFrankfurt, from there we went to Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia, why Czechoslo..., because\nAuschwitz is near the Czech border. And Czech, it was just liberated, you know, the Russians.\nAnd if you have money one time and want to have a nice trip, go to Prague. It\u2019s observed, the\nGermans didn\u2019t bomb. All the antiques are still there. It\u2019s a lot of culture. So anyway, we went\nto Prague. We stayed two days in Prague and then we went to Krakow. Krakow is near\nAuschwitz. We went to stay the night in Auschwitz, at Krakow, then we drove into Auschwitz.\nWe stayed all day long. And we had already made reservations in Warsaw. But we had a car,\nyou know, we drove. In Warsaw we made reservations at the hotel. And then from Warsaw, we\nmade all our journeys from there. First we went to Grodzisk where I told you.",
        "A: In 1992, I think or \u201891 or \u201892. And the kids, we went in the same house. You felt the hostility\nfrom the Poles, but give them a few dollars, it\u2019s okay, you know.",
        "A: First, they are afraid that you come here and you want to take the house away from them and all\nkinds of things. And then you, let\u2019s see, a lot of graffiti on the walls. You know, I still speak\nperfect Polish. So, I knew it. But if you win their confidence, at least they are not so hostile, you\ndon\u2019t trust them, but you are . So, and this lady, I told her all I wanted was to show\nmy kids where my mother lived, where my father lived, you know, and I give her a few dollars,\nso she spoke already different, you know. In fact, to be honest with you, before we left the first\ntime, you know, we had candle sticks, some silver. We didn\u2019t want to take it in Warsaw ghetto\nand they showed me where they buried it. But I saw the Poles, I didn\u2019t want them to risk myself\nto go take a look. They\u2019re probably not, but I didn\u2019t want to. So, anyway, we went to Grodzisk.\nShowed them where we lived. Showed them where my grandfather lived, where I went to\nschool. Oh, I made a lot of pictures, too, you know it. And then we went back to Warsaw. Next\nday we went to Piotrkow, you know it. And same thing, I showed them where the ghetto, and\nwhere we were. One thing what I couldn\u2019t bring myself in, to go in this room where my parents\nand my grandparents went out the last time. I told my kids, I can\u2019t go in, you know, somehow I\ncouldn\u2019t. So anyway, so we went there and we went back to Warsaw. And then we went to\nTreblinka, this is on the other side from Warsaw. And then we stayed there and then we went\nback to Germany. Went to Buchenwald, where I was liberated. And so we made our way home.\nAt least I showed the kids, that we still lived, we had an apartment. Really it was our house. You\nknow, we were still something. No doubt that we didn\u2019t come out from a rock. (Laughing.)\n42",
        "A: And for me and for them more, because I knew it. They didn\u2019t. Yes, it is very, very important.",
        "A: Not a new different understanding. They knew, they trusted me, they knew that I didn\u2019t lie. But\nit, seeing with your own eyes is different than imagine.",
        "A: For me? For me was the worst thing was when I was supposed to go in that room, you know,\nwhere we lived, in the ghetto, in PiotrkOw. Couldn\u2019t get in, didn\u2019t go in. This sticks out.",
        "A: In Piotrkow. And that is Fitarska (ph) ten, you know it\u2019s an address. And across the street, it\nwas high holidays in that time. And the people went over and cried and cried. I couldn\u2019t go in\nthere either, you know. This is what sticks out in my memory the most. You go to Treblinka.\nYou see all the rocks and all the things. It\u2019s cold. Here, you know, your mother got killed, but\nyou didn\u2019t see it visually, but the other ones, you know, I saw it. And when I went to\nAuschwitz, you know, and saw the crematorias there. I think I didn\u2019t have to see, I knew it. And\nyou saw the gate where everybody in Arbeit Macht Frei, you know.",
        "A: Why would I remove it? I will have to die with it. To me, it is now an honor, you know. I will\nnot remove it.",
        "A: No, no, nobody pressured me. In fact, if somebody would pressure me, I would tell them\ndifferent. No, no. They can\u2019t see me for my other side. I might not tell itin a harsh way, but I\ncan tell them in a nice way. Put them in place. No, it\u2019s my arm anyway in the long run.\n(Laughing. )",
        "A: Yeah, they saw it now. You see it on television. Now it\u2019s different.\n43",
        "A: It\u2019s most was when you speak to the kids, they\u2019re more sensitive. You know, you do not tell it in\na graphic way, because you do not want to hurt them. But they are more sensitive. They argue\nand it\u2019s honest. And otherwise you don\u2019t know it. You might question it or not, that\u2019s fine.",
        "A: Listen I told you enough, to repeat again, I appreciate it and I like you for it, because you do a lot\nof things, which is good. Thank you very much.\n"
