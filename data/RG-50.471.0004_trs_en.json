And yet as kids we, we\ndid nonsense too. Right\nin, in this ghetto.

If you mixed it\nwith snow in the winter and threw matches in\nit and the darned thing would explode you\nknow. And I mean I think we made believe we\nwere fighting the Germans with that. It was\nof course silly. Um. Of course at, at the\nbeginning, it's, it's I remember as things\nwent on frequently being, being hidden.
