        "Q: We're...we're on. The camera's starting. Would you tell me your full name, please?",
        "A: My name is Leo Schneiderman.",
        "Q: Where were you born, and when?",
        "A: I was born in, uh, Lodz, Poland, in August the 18th, 1921.",
        "Q: Leo, tell me about your childhood. I want to know about your family first.",
        "A: Well, my family, uh, was...I had, uh...two brothers and a sister. My father owned a very\nsmall store in Poland for supplies, uh, shoemaker supplies. We were not considered on\nthe poverty level, but, uh, we were comfortable before the war. I went to a private Jewish\nschool, because my parents believed in, uh, a Jewish education--but secular, not\nreligious. We were never strictly religious; but I would call ourselves traditional Jews.\nWhen the war broke out, uh, I was eighteen years old.",
        "Q: Let's talk a little bit more before the war. I want to know something.",
        "A: Uh huh.",
        "Q: Tell me about...what was Lodz like, pre-Hitler?",
        "A: Well, Lodz was a industrial city, about the second largest city in Poland. It was...it had a\nlarge Jewish population. I'd say about a hundred and seventy-five thousand Jews used to\nlive in Poland [NB: in Lodz]. Uh, most of the Jews were concentrated in uh...in one area.\nIt was voluntarily, because they...they like just to live.... It was just, I would call it, a\nvoluntary ghetto; because they like to, to stick to each other. They...they had a cultural\nlife. There were three Jewish theaters, three daily newspapers. It was a publishing house.\nIt was Jewish schools, which I attended one of them. It was also a very active religious\nlife and a political life. Uh, it was swarming with the unions and, uh, political parties. It\nwas really a bustling Jewish life, in the city of Lodz. A lot...most of the Jews were in\ntextile industry. Uh, many of them, uh, used to take out work from the factories, and they\ndid it at home; and by the end of the week they'd put it back together and they'd send it\nin. It was those...uh weavers, hand weavers, mostly. It was a large industry in...in Poland.\nAfter I finished school, you know, for a Jewish young kid, it was uh.... In, 1n our class, I\ncould not afford any higher education. I went to learn a trade, as an apprentice.\nWhat...[some (ph)] went as weavers, tailors, shoemakers. Well, I choose to be a tailor;\nand for a few years I worked as an apprentice even without getting paid. Just for the\nbenefit to learn the trade. And later on, I start to make a little money. And then come the\nwar. War broke out, I was about eighteen years old.",
        "Q: Alright. Tell me what happened the day the war broke out.",
        "A: Well, I remember...to, to talk about the outbreak of war, we have to go back a...a few\nweeks before. It was a war situation--like a war fever. We felt in our bones that war, war\nis coming. They dig trenches. They took away the young people to the...to the army; and\nwe, we knew for sure that war is going to break out any...any day. We were preparing for\nwar. We know. It's nothing we could do. We uh...we heard in the radio--for example, in\nour building it was two radios, and people were getting together to listen to the news. It\nwas not like uh we know today, that every family has a radio or TV. It was one radio in a\nbuilding, and it was enough. This, this was our contact with the world; and we heard the\nthe speeches from...from Hitler. We, we heard the...the speeches from Polish officials,\nand we know that any day we're going to be 1n the war. And sure enough...I remember\nlike today. It was Friday morning, September the Ist. We heard that this is war. And uh\nthe same day we, we, we heard German planes already; and three days later--it was the\n3rd of September--it came uh an order over the radio that all young people should move,\nget away in...towards Warsaw, to the east. Because the Germans are approaching, they\nwill need us to go into the army. And we, we...we packed our few things and we left. I\nleft my mother and...and my sister behind; and uh the men--even my, mine ten year old\nbrother--what also we were going to...towards Warsaw. Like the order said. We found\nout later that this was a German provocation. The...the voice on the radio was not from\nthe Polish government. It was from the German government, actually. Uh the Germans\nmade...tricked us; and they want to jam the roads so the Polish Army would have\ndifficulties to move. And sure enough...when we came on the road, we saw what's\nhappened. The, the vehicles couldn't move. The the the the the troops couldn't move.\nEverything, every road was jammed with refugees, with people going towards Warsaw.\nOn the way--it was not far away from Lodz, just uh several kilometers--German planes\nstart to bomb us. We...and many of those refugees were killed, right there on the fields. In\na little town near... outside Lodz, [Bierzyn (ph)], it was like one huge cemetery...\nrefugees [ (ph)] laying all over the fields--uh, injured, dead. And this was our first day\nactually that we experienced the war. And uh whatever we took with us, uh we had just\nenough food for a day or so. Soon we found out, little by little, actually there is no sense\nof running anymore; because with the German planes controlled the roads. They\ncontrolled the skies. It was no defense whatsoever. Even the Polish army was\ndisorganized. They could not understand where they had...they lost communication with\neach other, and we decided--uh, I mean, me, my...my brother, my father--that there's no\npoint in running. Maybe we should return back to L\u00e9dz, to...to our family, to the mother\nthat we.... And after another day, uh we decided there's no point in in running any longer.\nAnd we started to...to go back. On the way back, we met already the...the Polish Army\nlike uh uh...like they would quit. There's no point. And we came back...this was, uh...we\ncame back by Friday. It was...actually it was a Fri...the following Friday. After a week,\nwe came back to Lodz. And the same uh evening, the German, uh, patrols already came\ninto the city; and it was a Saturday when they marched in... into...to the city of Lodz. At\nthat day, we all stood and watched. Lodz also had a large German ethnic population, and\nimmediately they came out and start to throw flowers and candy at them, to welcome\nthem, finally, uh...like they would be liberated by the German army. For us Jews, the\nnightmare started that day; because, uh, here and there we saw already Jewish people\nwere beating [NB: beaten] up. And uh even our Polish neighbors took advantage of the,\nyou know, the long antisemitic feeling. They had a chance now to display, because\nnobody would protect any Jew anymore. And uh, religious Jews were caught in the street,\nand beards were shaved off. Uh, some beards were teared out from the faces, to the point\nthat blood came out. And Jews were caught in the street like uh dogs, and taken to work\nuh in doing all kinds of things. Every German had the right to do this. The civilian\nGerman population, the ethnic Germans, uh immediately they...they took out of the\nswastika armbands and they put on; and they became the masters of the street. Uh Jews\nused to own in business. They...everything was closed. And uh they they also threw out\nJews from homes, better looking homes. Immediately every German had the right to do\nthis. He just came in and said, \"Get out!\" And they took over and it...all the rights were\ntaken away immediately, the first day the German troops entered the city of Lodz. A Jew\nhad no right whatsoever. And uh at...by us, we...after a few weeks uh official Germans\nca...officers, they came into our home, to our...even to the apartment, the big apartment\nbuilding that we lived. And they gave us five minutes to leave the house, to leave our\napartment; and my mother said, \"Where should we go?\" He said, \"You should....\" It\nseems that he understood that question. Uh he said, \"I would suggest that you go to\nBa_uty.\" Ba_uty was a...a section, a very poor, it were the slum section of the city of\nLodz. He visualized that this is going to be the area for Jews to live, where Jews would\nbe forced to live. Uh so my mother start packing. He said, \"You don't have to pack. You\njust take uh the...your, your coat, and you...you take just the bread, the food that you\nhave. And you leave the house. Otherwise you will be thrown out.\" So my mother said,\n\"But uh we...we have a family. I have to take a few things. My little kid, you know, he'll\nneeds clothes.\" He said, \"Well, if you stay and talking, what there's now you got only\nthree minutes time.\" So my mother run to the...to the...to the closet, you know, and she\nstart uh to pack. And then he saw that there was a fur coat. He said, \"No, this you're\ngoing to leave.\" He didn't let her take. So we took just a few things. My father took uh a\nbox of tools; so he went over and checked the box of the tools, and see if there is not\nanything uh is not hidden under there. And so when we were about to leave the\nhouse...you see, my mother stood there by the...by the door and looked around our\napartment. And then he said that she should take off the pearls that she wore. So she took\noff the pearls and throwed away on the floor. And then he made her pick it up from the\nfloor and put it on the table; so she took the...the pearls from the floor and just throw it on\nthe table. And we walked out from our house, and here we stay on the street with no\nplace where to go. So we start walking to Ba_uty, to that section. And there already was\nsome kind of Jewish organization. They call it the [Geminde (ph)], the [Gemeinde (ph)];\nand they took all the refugees from--because they knew that building are coming to the\nghetto--and they gave us some kind of a shelter. And we did get an apartment through the\nJewish Council in that, in that section. We did get another apartment. It was a one-\nroom...we did not have a big apartment before. It was two, two rooms and a kitchen; but\nhere we got one room apartment. And please, we were so lucky. Everybody envied us\nthat we still had a roof over our head. And we start...we made that home; and later on, a\nfew months later, this was the official section for Jews to live. It was the ghetto. And\nJews were ordered from all of the sections in in the in the part of the town where we used\nto live, to leave. When we...we were a regular...thrown out actually from one building;\nbut then all the Jews in the city were ordered to leave. And it was like an exodus, you\nknow--like another war, where you could see through the city to the, to the...to the\nstreets, storming people with their belongings, whole families. They took carriages and\nmake uh little wagons. They took everything they could and load it up on those uh\ncarriages and wagons, and it's on backs; and they stormed into the ghetto. And that's how\nthe ghetto was formed. It was a very small part of town, mostly slums. And that's how a\nhundred and seventy-five thousand people were crowded 1n, in that uh.... Rooms had to\nbe shared for families. We, we were fortunate enough to have our own apartment. We\ndidn't have to share with nobody. It was that time uh...my, my father--I forgot to tell you-\n-my father at that time took some of the belongings and...and went to a small town where\nhis his sister lived and.... Just to put it away there. And by that time the ghetto was\nclosed, and you could not come back; and he was separated from us all through the war\nand we never saw him again. Uh my brother decided, one brother of mine that's younger,\ndecided that uh he will try his luck and go to that part of Russia...that Russia occupied, a\ncity by the name of \"Bia_ystok.\" Well, actually he told me to come with him. So I just\ncouldn't. My father was gone. And he...he went away because he had arrangement with\nsome friends; and he tried to stay in Bia_ystok. Now there was my mother, and a kid\nbrother only ten years old, and...and my sister. I just did not have the heart to leave them.\nAnd I decided to stay in the ghetto with them. And by May the Ist, the ghetto was...was\nclosed. And was like...like a big prison, barbed wires around, armed guards every few\nfeet. And this was our...our life, that time--1940. How did we live? Everybody still had\nsome, you know, money. And there is, there was some food to buy here and there. But we\ncould see the writing on the wall, what's going to happen next month, and a month later.\nThe Jewish Council that was formed came up with an idea that we should organize shops\nand work; and this was the... the plan that the the elders of the ghetto uh came up to the\nGerman peo...to the German authorities: that we have tremendous resources in the ghetto.\nWe got shoemakers--experts. We got tailors. We got weavers. We got such good\ncraftsmen that maybe we can interest German industrialists to use, to make use out of\nthose talents. And they did, for their...for their own reason. This, for them...a chance to\nhave a big bureaucracy. They wouldn't have to go to the Front. They employed a lot of\npeople. It's still better to guard Jews than to go to the Front. And uh and this was going\non for...until 1944. But conditions were worsening with every month, because it was less\nand less and less food. You see, we understood that the German people...the whole ghetto\nwas designed, actually, to starve the people out. Uh if the if the war would last another\n' According to Hilberg, the order to close the ghetto was issued May 10, 1940. See Hilberg, The\nDestruction of the European Jews, vol. 1, p. 223.\nten years, they would liquidate the entire ghetto without firing one shot; because the\nstatistics showed that every month more people died and died. Uh from families that used\nto be five people, there are only three; because people were dying out...and getting\nsicker...and getting smaller. And we could see they emaciated up to nothing. People start\nto look like skeletons. And it came to a point that people couldn't even work; and the\nwork was (cough) compulsory. We have to go work. If you miss a day of work, you get\nless food; because the, the, the place of work provided one soup a day. So if you didn't go\nto work, you get one soup less. You have to just make with that little food that you got\nfrom the monthly rations.",
        "Q: Leo, tell...tell me about a day in your life. What was it like for Leo Schneiderman?",
        "A: During the war?",
        "Q: Tell me what you did, and what your family did?",
        "A: OK. When we get up in the morning, all four of us, we had to prepare for work. I start off\nwith...with my mother. My mother worked at a...at the place where they used to, to, to...\nfuel, to distribute the fuel for the house. Coal. It's a.... So she had to go to work in order\nto get that pot of soup. My sister went to work in a...in a...a place where they used to\nmake shoes out of straw; used for the German army on the front, so when they stood\nguard they shouldn't freeze their feet. So those big shoes she used to make out of straw.\nMy little brother worked in uh one of the tailor shops, in the office; he was a runner. And\nI went to work as a tailor in the factory for uniforms. When we came to work 1n the\nmorning, we start...we started uh by...by the machines, of course, and we were making\nthe German uniforms. But uh the minute I sat down, un...until we finish, that's all it was\nin my mind at that time is twelve o'clock when we will go, we'll have a break and we'll\nget something to eat. Because I was constantly hungry. The...the hunger didn't leave me,\nbecause the little food that we had at home uh in, in the morning--it was one piece of\nbread that I ate in the morning, and the se...the other piece I took with me to have it in the\nshop. And I...I kept it in my pocket, or I kept it in in the pot that I took with me for\nthe...for the soup. Everybody had a little pot with them. And we could not wait; and this\nwas everybody. The whole day, it was in my mind. In the meantime, work has to be done.\nIt was strictly controlled. And twelve o'clock, the minute we have the break we have to...\neverybody was running for the soup. This was the major event in the...in the day. After\nwork, we came home. Uh if it was summer, it was bearable. In the wintertime, it was no\nfuel. It was cold. Uh, most of the furniture was gone already because we break, broke it\nup and burned it just to keep warm. And the minute we were ready with that little supper\nthat we had from the...we, we finished it all together. And then we went to bed, to...even\njust to keep warm. Uh, and this...when it...most of the time uh, we stood [NB: stayed] in\nbed. The summertime, when it was warm, we used to go out. We also had to go to stay in\nline for the rations to...to get. And sometimes uh the staying in line meant hours. And me\nbeing the...the man of the house, it was up to me; because I would not have my mother\nstanding in line, or my sister or my little brother, but it...1t was up to me to...to bring in\nthe food from the rations. And uh it was very little left for social life. Me being eighteen,\nnineteen year old--for some people this is the golden age. Uh, I spent my eighteen and\nnineteen and twenty years in...in the ghetto of Lodz. Always hungry, always tired, uh\noverworked, and with no hope for the...for the future. I didn't see any hope. Later, after a\nfew years, I got involved in...1n, in some educational project. We started to...to write. I\nparticular was interested in writing something about the ghetto. And I developed some...\npeople say that I did develop some talent for poetry, which later on it was used by some\nJewish dramatists like [Jonah Stogow (ph)]. I was also at one time involved in teaching\nYiddish, because I was a student of the Yiddish school in...1n Lodz, of the [Medem (ph)]\nschool. And we taught. It was...this was illegal. It was not allowed to teach. My students\nwere not the children, actually. It was young uh girls--uh, at the age of fifteen, sixteen--\nwho were interested in knowing, because before the war they went to Polish school and\nYiddish was strange to them. In the ghetto, they got that chance. They considered this\npart of the social life; and also beneficially, because they learned a language. And to me,\nit was very rewarding, very satisfactory for a while. And for the...for a few years,\nactually, I did that kind of teaching in Yiddish.",
        "Q: You told me before about a particular man in the ghetto who was particularly cruel.\nWould you tell us about it and tell us the name you knew him by?",
        "A: Yeah. Uh it was one German guard. He took some pleasure in abusing people physically.\nIt was a part of the ghetto where you used to cross from one...from one side to the other,\nunder guard. And this man many times stood there at those gates. And uh if he didn't like\nsomebody, or he went too fast, or he didn't take off his hat in the right way, or he'd\nwalked too slow, he went over to him (cough) and he punched him several times. And\nthat's how (cough) he got the name of \"The Boxer,\" because he used to box people. I\nlooked at that man several times, and somehow he registered in mine brain. At one time--\nit was in 1942, before that action that we used to call the \"Sperre\" [Translation:\n\"Closing,\" \"Closure\" (Ger)]|, that we were ordered for eight days not to leave the house\nand they selected all the people that got too weak to work anymore. The children--it were\nillegal to have children in...in the ghetto. The sick, the olderly [NB: elderly], that they\nconsidered useless people. But that...before this action actually started, they...they...all of\na sudden, they attacked the ghetto. They came in like a surprise, and they surrounded the\nhospital. And like wildfire the news spread that the Germans surrounded the hospital on\nLagowniecka Street. Before the war, this used to be the ...the....also a \"ambulance\"--like\nsocial...social medicine station [NB: perhaps \"ambulatorium\" (Pol), an outpatient facility\nof a hospital]. Kasa Chorych [NB: former National Health Service]. And we run over\nthere. It so happened that one of my friends was a patient at that hospital; because he had\nan attack, they took him to that hospital. And when I heard, the first name that came to\nmy mind, \"Oh, my God, Josek Feldman is in the hospital!\" And I run over and stood\nthere. I still had an hour before going to work, so I stood there for the hour and watched.\nWhat I saw, it's hard to describe, even. Wagons standing below the building, and nurses\nbringing out the patients and put them on the wagons. Uh some patients going on\nthemselves; like uh I saw them, they're going to the wagon. And then I saw from the\nsecond floor, they opened the window and people were throwing out sick people into the\nwagons. And who is there conducting the whole operation? That \"Boxer\"! Well, after the\nwar at one time I read in the paper that somebody is looking for me, that the the.... It was\nto the Jewish World Congress that were looking for me as a witness for that \"Boxer.\" Of\ncourse, I immediately replied; and I was called to the German Consul in Chicago and I\nwas told that somebody gave my name that I know what happened in that...1n that day. I\nsaid, \"I certainly do.\" I still don't know until today who gave my name; but I went to\nGermany and I testified against that \"Boxer,\" which I found out that his real name is\n\"Krisom\" because that's how they referred to him, \"Herr Krisom.\" And I was asked by\nthe prosecutor to...to tell what I know about him; and I told them the story about that\nhospital, what's happened in that...in that day. Uh, his lawyer asked me a question, if I\nknow for sure that the people were thrown out from the windows into the wagon. He said\nhow do I know for sure they were thrown out? Maybe they jumped out, out of fear, when\nthey saw the troops. They jumped out by themselves. So my question to him was, \"How\nabout the stretchers?\" People on stretchers. And also: belongings, packages, suitcases,\nbottles. Altogether were thrown out into the.... And then another question was put to me:\n\"Weren't you afraid to stay there and watch all this, with all the Germans around--with\nthat 'Boxer,' that you call him, around? Weren't you afraid to stand there? You told me\nthat he used to beat up people he didn't like.\" So I told them that I think that they wanted\nus to stay. If they wouldn't want us to stay there, they would chase us away. They want us\nto stay and observe all that fear, all that cruelty, that I did. Then the only defense was,\nfrom the lawyer in that same, that I mistake him for somebody else. They never denied\nthat such action happened there by the hospital. The only defense was: maybe it was\nsomebody else, not him. And sure enough, this was forty years later. I said, \"Looking at\nthat man I don't know if this is the man. I only know the 'Boxer.' And if he was the\n'Boxer,' he was the man.\" They showed me pictures from the past. I recognized him\nimmediately. And then they showed me different kind of hats that he wore, and I picked\nhis uniform. I picked his cap that he wore, and it was established that he was the one.\nAnd then the defense went--not referring to me, but referring to the prosecutor--that it\nwas a cruel war and every man in the war had to follow the orders, and this was the\norders. But I establish one point: that that action...that this man, Herr Krisom--or that one\nthat we called \"The Boxer\"--was in charge of that operation.",
        "Q: When and where was this trial?",
        "A: The trial was in Bochum (Westphalia), West Germany. It was outside of Dusseldorf. It\nwas in 1978. I don't recall the exact date.",
        "Q: Thank you. Let's go back to the ghetto in L\u00e9dz.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Q: Are there any other stories or incidents that you remember from Lodz that are important\nthat you want to tell us?",
        "A: Well, the most important is during the liquidation when we were running from the\ntransports, we were trying to stay in the ghetto, not to go away. Because to go away to\nnowhere, to a unknown destination, it's frightening. We don't know where. They...",
        "Q: Tell us...excuse me, what...what happened leading up to the liquidation of the ghetto, so\nwe know.",
        "A: Yes. The the people from the ghetto was taken out constantly...five hundred, six hundred,\nthousand, and they...we were told that they going to be resettled in a different place. That\nthey need--for example, at one time they need strong people, so they took all the strong\nmen and they put them to work, and they send them away. For a while, their families\nused to get a letter or two--even money paid by the by the Jewish Council in the ghetto--\nto make us believe they're working someplace else, and that's is the pay the family is\ngetting. But after a while, it stopped. There were no more letters. No more money. We\ndidn't hear about them; like they were gone. And a few months later another resettlement\nprogram. They took away other people. They need another five hundred, or six hundred,\nor...or a thousand. It was little by little. The ghetto was getting smaller and smaller. The\npopulation dying, and putting...and sending away. Until it came to a point that\neverybody, the whole ghetto, is being liquidated. And everybody was going away. And\n...and this was the the time that we tried, we tried very hard to stay. We hide. We built\neven uh hiding places underneath, uh underneath cellars. We...we kept on running;\nbecause uh it looked like uh the minute we leave the the ghetto from there, that there's no\nplace left for a Jew to run. They even promised us that that we were going away we can\ntake our tools. We can take machinery with us to establish ourself in the new place. But\nthe question was: What is wrong with this place? Why, why do we have to be a new\nplace? Our...this is not paradise that we are here. They promised us a huge amount of\nfood at the train for three days. Everybody will receive a whole loaf of bread. This was a\ntreasure. It was like a bait. But still we were...we would like to stay in one place, because\none precious thing was left to us--the family was together. And this we felt, it's going to\nbe...the minute we go on the train, we're going to be separated. The men probably will go\nto work someplace else. We did not imagine anything worse than that, that probably the\nmen will work in one place. The women will work in another place, and the...the\nyoungsters will work someplace else. This alone was frightening for us. And it came to a\npoint uh that they used to hunt there from street to street. And transport was formed every\nday, and going to the train and sent away. People among us working at those transports,\nthey told us what is going on at the train and how the people are packed 1n those trains.\nUnhuman conditions. And the question was: if we were sent to work, to do some work,\nand that's how you transport people going to work? And it was...it became clear that this\nis the end. And we used to run as much as we could and hide, to avoid those transport\ngoing away. It came to a point when our part of the ghetto was sealed off; and it was no\nmore place to hide and no more strength to run. And if one member of the family gives\nup, the rest follow. My mother told us she cannot run no more. This is it. She would like\nto go to the train, and get at least a loaf of bread and go away. Lets happen what's happen.\nThen she suggested that maybe I should keep on hiding with my little brother, and she\nwith my sister would go with them. The minute she said that, my kid brother grabbed my\nmother's hand and start to cry. He said, \"No, I'm going with you, too.\" At that moment we\nall decided that we shall go together. Either we're going to live together, or we're going to\ndie together. We reported to the train depot. We came there. It was a huge crowd. The\nboxcars were waiting; and uh German troops, armed guards all around us. Some even had\ndogs on their leashes. And they divided groups of a hundred...a hundred to each boxcar,\nand we started to go to train. And sure everybody received a loaf of bread. Two kilo, will\nbe around four pounds of bread. We never had so much bread since the war started. A lot\nof people started to eat even before they boarded the box car. You know, they start\ntearing the bread apart and eating. And in an hour when we all were in...1n that box car, a\nhundred of them, he came over-- the one with the dog came over--and looked around, and\nhe took some people from the other group and added to our train; because he felt that we\nhave too much room. And this was in August 1944. It was a very hot day at that time.\nAnd after he added the other people, then they put those gates together and we heard that\nbig noise that he locked the boxcar. And there we were in that train, over a hundred\npeople. The only facility in the train was two buckets for over a hundred men, women\nand children; and the train was standing on one place. It was unbearable hot. Lack of air.\nSo some people had an idea that the minute we start moving, it's going to get cooler.\n(Cough) But at one moment we heard that the gate opened up in the boxcar, so we\nthought maybe they changed their mind. They're going to leave us out. But instead, they\nbrought a few dozen Jews discovered in a hiding place; they were all badly beaten up\nbecause they were hiding. I remember one young man, all his front teeth were kicked out.\nAnd one boy's face was so badly swollen, it was just a nose that we could see--no eyes.\nAnd they added to our car. And soon we started to move. It didn't cool off. And at one\nmoment, we heard a young teenage girl crying. She had to go to the buckets in front of\neverybody. Her mother, her sister tried to shield her with a coat. A man was begging the\npeople around to give a little more room his pregnant wife. Me being among the\nyoungsters, I was asked to climb up those packages, and look out to see where are we\ngoing. I start to reading signs. One recognized those names. He said that we are moving\nsouth towards Krakow. I also saw some Polish peasants lining the road. They were\nprobably used to those scenes, those trains. Some made signs to us, pointing to the sky.\nAnd some went with the fingers across this throat, the throat. I didn't tell the people what\nI saw; but I mentioned that later on, after the war, to the Polish alderman in Chicago, Mr.\nRoman [Pochinsky (ph)]. And he told me that, \"They tried to warn you that you going to\nbe killed, that you should try to run away.\" Well, I tried to believe that; but the\nexpression on their faces told me something else. It was late at night that we arrived at\nAuschwitz. When we came in, the minute the gates [NB: the doors of the train] opened\nup, we heard screams, barking of dogs, blows from...from those kapos--those officials\nworking for them, over the head. And then we got out of the train, and everything went\nso fast: left, right, right, left. Men separated from women, children torn from the arms of\nmothers, the olderly chased like cattle. The sick, the disabled, were handled like packs of\ngarbage. They were thrown in a side together with broken suitcases and with boxes. My\nmother run over to me and grabbed me by the shoulders, and she told me, \"Leibele, I'm\nnot going to see you no more. Take care of your brother.\" Well, my brother was twelve,\nthirteen at that time. Ten minutes later, Mengele, the doctor--I didn't know in that time...I\nsaw a handsome looking gentlemen with white gloves--pointed to my little brother to go\nto the left. And before I realized, he was gone and I didn't see him no more. I didn't know\nat the time that I was the lucky one; because when I went into the showers, from the\nshower heads we got water. Other people got poison gas. But when we came out from the\nshowers, the sky was red. The air was filled with smoke and the odor of burning flesh\nand...and hair. A man went over to those officials, and he asked one of those officials\n(ph)--he called them the \"kapos\"--he asked him about his wife and his little girl. And the\nman looked him straight in the eye. He said, \"There is no more little girl. There\nwas...there is no more wife.\" He said, \"What do you mean? Where they are?\" And he\npointed to the chimney with that...that smoke bursting out. \"That's their funeral. Here\nthey go.\" Well, the man didn't cry. He didn't scream. He just stood there and stared at that\nchimney. We all stared at it. We would stay there probably for hours. But we started to be\nchased into the block, to the barracks where we were marched over. We couldn't even\nrecognize each other. No hair. The hair was shaved off. Dressed in striped uniforms--too\nsmall, too big, too large, too short. We all looked like clowns. And then we were\nwelcomed by a speech from one of those kapos. He said, \"You saw that sign that 'Arbeit\nMacht Frei\u2019? That means 'freedom through labor.'\" He said, \"Don't make any mistakes.\nNobody needs your labor here. You did not come here to work. You came here to be\nkilled. You're just waiting your turn. And remember I don't have any...I don't have to\nhave a reason to kill you, if I want it. So you better do what you're told.\" Well, this was\nthe beginning of Auschwitz. Every morning that we went out to be counted, we could\nfeel the crematoriums burning. And that most disgusting odor is the burning of flesh and\nhair together. I decided to make every effort to do everything I can to go away from\nAus... Auschwitz. Because they were forming transport to go away to labor; because\nAuschwitz itself was an extermination camp, not a labor camp. But for the time being,\nthey...they used to send transport to go for work in labor camps. I didn't succeeded in the\nbeginning, but I...I still tried. I still tried. Uh, at one time they asked, \"Who knows, who\never worked in road construction?\" The minute I run over, and I said, \"I did.\" He said,\n\"Where did you work?\" I said, \"Outside of 6d_, when they build the highway.\" I never\nsaw any construction worked at all. So they put a few hundred together, and they put us\nin a site. So we were in the transport. All the rest start to get the tatoos to stay in\nAuschwitz, their number. And we were put on a transport; and I went to a labor camp\noutside in Silesia, in a place called Kaltwasser.\u201d Kaltwasser was a labor camp under\nconstruction. It was a beautiful area. They were building uh new roads and a small\nrailroad, and that's what we worked. The conditions that time: 1t was very hard. We didn't\nhave adequate clothes; and starting to get cold in the morning, especially when we stood\nto be counted. We were freezing. There were no beds in our barracks. They just put uh\nsome straw on the floor, and that how's we slept, in our clothes. And the work was very\n* Administered by Wiistegiersdorf (subcamp of Gro Rosen).

So we, we\nconsider ourself the lucky ones, that we got away from Auschwitz. The...we did not stay\ntoo long in that particular camp; because as work progressed, we were sent to a different\ncamp called Larche.\u2019 Was the same work, a continuation of the same work. And, uh,\nthere we also worked at the same thing, but the living conditions were a little better.\nThere were beds already--bunks--and we did receive, uh, warmer clothes. Uh, but\nfortunately that...that work, in...1n that was finished in...1n a very short time; and they\ndecided again send us to a different camp, in a place called Wolfsberg.\u00b0 Uh at that\nparticular camp, I met some people--those officials that knew my family from before the\nwar--and I did get a better job. I worked in the hospital, in the Revier, in that hospital in\nthat camp. And my situation improved a little bit, and so did my physical uh condition\nimproved. And there I stood [NB: stayed] until we could hear the Russian army already\napproaching. At night we heard cannon sound, and we felt that any day we're going to be\nliberated.",

        "Q: OK. You are in uh Larche...",
        "A: ...Larche.",
        "Q: Tell us about...tell us about working in the hospital there.",
        "A: In the hospital, I worked in a place called Wolfsberg, not Larche. Yeah. Well, uh, people,\nuh, if they had some minor accident or they got sick, they report to the doctor. Uh, they\ncame in, and the doctor prescribed how many days he can stay in that hospital. Three\ndays, four days. A lot of people, uh, tried to just get in to be away and to get some kind of\na rest, and to be away from that hard work. They couldn't take it no more. And some\nlegitimately got sick, and they reported to the hospital. They didn't get any treatment, uh,\nfor anything. They just laid there, just to stay away from work. And after a few days, the\ndoctor decided, \"You're all right now, and you can go.\" If somebody got seriously sick,\nsomebody made a report. And every few weeks they came and they took the peo--\nGerman people, you know, the Gestapo, whatever--and they took them away. They said\nthey took them away to a real hospital where they can get better treatment. Actually, they\nwere taken to Auschwitz to the gas chambers. And, for example, uh, people who knew\nthat, uh, they were seriously ill, they tried as much as they could to stay away from the\nhospital; because the hospital...they know if they happened to be so unlucky and this is a\ntime when the Germans come.... Because they come every once in a while to check on\nthis hospital, and they could tell.... They didn't, they didn't care about those people who\ntried to get away from work for a day or so. Whoever was ill, they were taken away; and\nthey...they said they take them to a hospital to be cured, but this was the end of them. Uh,\nthe end station actually was Auschwitz, or any other extermination camp. My work in\nthat hospital was, uh, to keep order. Uh, in the morning, uh, they come in. I had to count\nthe people, uh, to get them ready to...for inspection; and after...and also the food. I also\ndistribute the food for those people. Uh, in some cases, people who did not work received\nhalf of the normal rations. Not in that camp where I worked, but in other camps this was\nthe case. For example, this was the case in the last camp where I was liberated, later on.\nThis was the case that non-working people received half of the rations. But in that camp,\nuh, where I worked--in Wolfsberg--it was not too bad, you know. But the only thing\nis...three, four days was the maximum that, uh, a person was allowed to be sick. If there\nwas a serious sickness for longer, they took them away. Uh, at one time, they they came\nin and they took away almost half of the hospital. Yeah, a lot of people. For example, in\nour...our barrack where I was, uh, in charge--1t was some over eighty people--that they\ntook out about thirty, thirty five people away that they considered actually they were not\nuh...they were emaciated. They looked so bad. So they took them away. And the rest of\nthe people stood [NB: stayed]; and a lot of people were frightened, and they reported out\nthat they said that they feel better. They want to go out to work already.",
        "Q: Where did you go from here? Tell us.",
        "A: That was like I said, that we fe...we heard already noise of the...of the Red Army\napproaching. And at one day the...we were told to assemble, and we started to march on\nfoot. The clothes that we had, it was uh not adequate; because this was February already.\u201d\nIt was cold and snowing; and we were marching on these columns, quite uh...almost eight\nhundred people at that time, the whole camp. And we were marching through the fields;\nand uh...there was no food. We marched the first day, until it was dark. We passed a lot\nof hamlets, a lot of villages. People came out and they looked at us. They were probably\nused to that scenes already. And when we passed a place uh on the field. There were two\nhuge barns, and that's...that how we stood overnight. In the morning we start marching\nagain, the second day. And also until late at night; and it was no food, only that what we\ngot when we started. It was a loaf of bread, and some uh artificial honey, it was a lump;\nand that's how we marched through two days. On the third day we were also put in...in\nbarns, very big barns; and that's how we stood one day, and another day. And no food.\nThe people was starving to die, from starvation. They didn't get up. In the morning we\nused to touch each other to get up, and some didn't. When we walked out, and we just\nwalking around...I remember one instance that the other side of the wall was a horse. And\nI heard that that horse in a grubbing of some food. So I was by the wall. So I took away, I\ntore away a board from that wall; and I saw that the horse was eating beets, sugar beets.\nSo I tried to grab one from that horse. He almost bit my hand off. He didn't let me. So L...I\noutsmarted the horse. I took a piece of straw, and I started to tickle the horse on the head.\nSo the minute he picked up the head, so I grabbed a beet out from...and that's how I ate it.\nThe German guards saw that they...they wouldn't have no nobody to march with\nanymore, because people were dying so fast--and so many of them. They slaughtered a\nfew of those horses, and they told the people to cook some soup. And then we received\na...a warm soup out of that horsemeat. This was the third day. The fourth day they\nassembled us. We start marching; and I saw that we are marching to a train depot,\nbecause it was railroad tracks already. We came there. And if we thought that the...the\nride from 6d_ ghetto to Auschwitz was bad, this was even worse; because this was in\nthe wintertime and the train car were open cars. Coal cars, out in the open. And there\nwere we packed in. And also we received some bread, also a loaf of bread; and they told\nus to be careful with the bread because we don't know how long we're going to stay in\nthose trains. And it took about five days. In every car, I would say about ten percent,\nfifteen percent of the people died. In our car, I remember it was a father and two sons.\nAnd the father survived; both sons died in that train. And the minute they...he start to\nmove, the other grabbed his part of bread. We become like animals. But at this point, I\nwould like also to...to mention it, we passed in Czechoslovakia one town. I even\nremember the name today, for so many years. The name of that town was Stara Paka.\nAnd it was a factory next to that train station. And people from the fac... factory run out;\nand everybody took those lunches they had and threw in in our train. Some people threw\neven apples, that we didn't see for years already. And they threw in our train. The\n> 1945.\nGerman guards started to shoot on them from their rifles. They shoot in the air. They\ndidn't kill nobody. They shoot...they try to scare them away. They didn't react. I saw a\nyoung woman. When she saw us on the train, she went into those factory, start to ring a\nbell. And everybody came out with the...with the food, with lunches, and they threw in to\nour.... This was the Czech people in a town called Stara Paka. They took us...on the fifth\nday we arrived in Austria. And this was the end of our journey, a concentration camp\ncalled Ebensee. It was the overflow of Mauthausen. Mauthausen was such a cruel camp\nthat the Germans themselves called it \"Mordhausen,\" which means \"House of Murder.\"\nWhen we came to...to Ebensee, the hunger and the labor and the way--especially for us\nJews--the way we were treated, we were sure that not one will survive that camp. That\nthis was it. The charge, the man in charge of our block was a professional killer. He\nenjoyed so much killing people. The...the people who went to the hospitals when they\nwere sick there, hardly one came out alive. The people who were not working, who were\nin that hospital: Jews received half of the rations that the normal worker received; non-\nJews they gave the regular rations if they were not too long in that hospital. The...we\nwent, I remember, to the shower in that camp. It was the end of February or the\nbeginning of March [NB: 1945]. It was still cold. When we came out from the shower,\nwe stood outside...I don't know how long. Without clothes. Without...without wiping\nourselves off. I would never believe that a person can survive standing in the outside in\nthe wintertime without clothes for so long. We were waiting 'til we get our bundles of\nclothes from disinfection, and then we run back to the block. I remember standing on\nthat, waiting for my clothes, like a pelican. I stood on one foot, and then I changed. I put\ndown the other foot, and I picked up the other foot. I didn't realize that this is possible for\na person to survive, but apparently it 1s possible. I did it. In that... in that camp we worked\nin tunnels. The...we built tunnels in behin...below the mountains. They decided to put the\nmunition factories inside those tunnels to be away from the bombing. The work was hard,\nno food; because scared...even the German guards were fighting for food for themselves.\nThe...1t was the end of the war. Conditions were terrible for everybody. Many times\nthe...there were bombings. Uh, we saw the planes coming. At one time, we stood; we\ncan't work. Bombs start to drop; and uh the Germans were running, hiding. We didn't. I\nstood there, and I did not care if I'm going to get killed or not. I was just looked up in the\nsky, and I was just looking that the bombs should drop. Nobody even cared anymore.\nSometimes people wonder, \"Why are you not afraid to die?\" Because when you are in\nsuch a condition that uh...that you really don't care no more, people are not afraid of to\ndie. I was not afraid to die. When we were led to a...a place of work in the morning--it\nwas around five or six kilometers--there was a pile of potatoes laying. The Germans\nknew that we're going to grab them. They stood with the big sticks, and everybody get\nnear those piles was beaten. And uh we didn't care. And I saw, for example, that they\ndrop the stick on somebody's head and the man started to bleed. And then I figure out that\nit must take time 'til they get the stick up. In the meantime, I--just like...like lightening--I\njumped on that pile; and I grabbed two, three potatoes and I run back. So he could have\nsplit my head, too. And I knew it, but I didn't care. In the meantime, I ate raw potatoes.\nThat's what hunger can do to a person. We can see what it does to a body, but it's very\nhard to describe what it can to do a person's mind. You gave up on life. I did. Until I was\nliberated, we also experienced a terrible ordeal. At one morning, we were told that we're\nnot going out to work. Is it in Ebensee, in this hell? They let us stay home? They said,\n\"You're not going out to work.\" They said, \"But the American army is approaching the\ncamp, and we decided that we have to go and hide because they're going to bomb that\ncamp. They might think this is a military camp. And that we should go and hide in those\ntunnels in the mountains.\" So one of those Kapos--he was a Frenchman--he got up, and\nhe says, \"No!\" And he starts screaming, \"No! No! No go to the stalls!\" So people was\nconfused. \"What do you mean?\" He said, \"Dynamite in the stalls!\" They had prepared\ndynamite charges, and they were ready to blow us up in the last minute. So that the...the\naltester from the...from the camp said, \"If you don't want to go hide, it's OK. You can\nstay here in the camp.\" And the next day in the morning, tanks came in. The American\ntanks came in, and we were free. Then I went to the hospital, uh, in the area to...I had at\nthat time weighted a hundred, a hundred and seventy kilogram. Uh, this was almost a\nhundred pounds.",
        "Q: Tell me about liberation, when the soldiers came in.",
        "A: Well, people were crying. People were hugging each other. They climbed up on those\ntanks. They were sticking to the tanks like flies. And, uh, they...already they realized at\nthat time the enormity of their tragedy. Especially for us Jews. People started to make the\npreparations to go home. Delegations came in from France, from Russia, from Poland;\nyou know, to get their people together. Nobody came for us. Nobody even was interested\nwhat is going to happen to the Jews. We had no homes to go. Our homes were destroyed.\nThere were no Jews. They came, and they explained it to us that \"Soon you will receive\nsome information how to get together.\" The Jewish Agency came and want to take us to\nPalestine. And they were told us Polish Jews, \"You're not even welcome back in Poland.\"\nThe French government wanted the Jews to come back, but there were very few. But the\nbulk of the Jewish population was from Russia, from Poland, from Hungary. Some did go\nback after the liberation, and some came back to the camps. They said, \"There is no more\nplace for us in our home.\" Especially in Poland. A Jew came back, and he said he almost\ngot killed when he tried to reclaim his hou... his house. And we decided to stay there. We\nestablished some kind of a Jewish community in Austria, some in Germany or in Italy. I\nwas in Austria. I worked for uh the Jewish Central Committee. My boss was the famous\nNazi hunter, Simon Wiesenthal, who headed the political department. Also the\ndocumentation center. He published our bulletin, that I was also involved because the\nYiddishe [Rundschau (ph?)]. I worked in the cultural department of...in Linz, Austria.\nUntil uh.... By the way, I also met my wife, that I knew from the ghetto, in Austria. We\ngot married and we lived in Linz, where I worked in the Central Committee of the Jews\nin Austria. Until we emigrated. We received a visa through the HIAS, and we came to the\nUnited States. But uh the memories of the Holocaust, from those camps-- especially that\none scene that when my mother grabbed me by the shoulders and said, \"I will never see\nyou again,\" that I should take care of my little brother--this stays with me for all those\nyears. And I'm sure it will never leave me.",
        "Q: Leo, what...besides that memory, what has been the effect of the war on you, of the\nHolocaust on you?",
        "A: The effect is that I got some, I feel that I have a responsibility to tell the story about the\nHolocaust. But I never dreamed that a time will come that I will have to convince the\npeople there was such a thing as a Holocaust. Beside all the ...the fact and documentation\nand witnesses, there are people who denied it, that said there wasn't a Holocaust. This I\nnever thought that I will have to do. I feel some kind of a responsibility towards future\ngenerations. I tell...I talk to my children about it. A lot of people--friends of mine--tried\nto spare their children, and their grandchildren, those horrible experiences that they went\nthrough. I think it was wrong. I feel that we should make every effort for the world to\nlearn the lesson of the Holocaust, so such an event should never, never happen again. To\nno people. I'm very sensitive at the misery of other people. Mainly because I'm a Jew,\nand I know what it means. The Holocaust Museum that is being built in Washington now\nmeans quite a bit to me. Mainly, it is not a Jewish project. It's an official United States\ninstitution, I feel, just like the Smithsonian Institute or the Library of Congress. Because\nif a revisionist goes who say that the Holocaust is a lie, I can tell him that the government\nof the United States said it is true. And go to Washington, and see for yourself. Yad\nVashem, it's also does a tremendous job, but they can say it's a Jewish institution. That\nboxcar who 1s in the Washington Museum, has...is significant because it was given by a\nPolish government. Just like the boat from Denmark was given by the Danish\ngovernment. That's why this museum means quite a bit to me. That mean this is one more\nway that the world will learn the lesson of the Holocaust. It is a mission that's almost\nsacred. (Pause) OK?",

We were not considered on\nthe poverty level, but, uh, we were comfortable before the war. I went to a private Jewish\nschool, because my parents believed in, uh, a Jewish education--but secular, not\nreligious. We were never strictly religious; but I would call ourselves traditional Jews.\nWhen the war broke out, uh, I was eighteen years old.",
        "A: Uh huh.",
        "A: Well, Lodz was a industrial city, about the second largest city in Poland. It was...it had a\nlarge Jewish population. I'd say about a hundred and seventy-five thousand Jews used to\nlive in Poland [NB: in Lodz]. Uh, most of the Jews were concentrated in uh...in one area.\nIt was voluntarily, because they...they like just to live.... It was just, I would call it, a\nvoluntary ghetto; because they like to, to stick to each other. They...they had a cultural\nlife. There were three Jewish theaters, three daily newspapers. It was a publishing house.\nIt was Jewish schools, which I attended one of them. It was also a very active religious\nlife and a political life. Uh, it was swarming with the unions and, uh, political parties. It\nwas really a bustling Jewish life, in the city of Lodz. A lot...most of the Jews were in\ntextile industry. Uh, many of them, uh, used to take out work from the factories, and they\ndid it at home; and by the end of the week they'd put it back together and they'd send it\nin. It was those...uh weavers, hand weavers, mostly. It was a large industry in...in Poland.\nAfter I finished school, you know, for a Jewish young kid, it was uh.... In, 1n our class, I\ncould not afford any higher education. I went to learn a trade, as an apprentice.\nWhat...[some (ph)] went as weavers, tailors, shoemakers. Well, I choose to be a tailor;\nand for a few years I worked as an apprentice even without getting paid. Just for the\nbenefit to learn the trade. And later on, I start to make a little money. And then come the\nwar. War broke out, I was about eighteen years old.",
        "A: Well, I remember...to, to talk about the outbreak of war, we have to go back a...a few\nweeks before. It was a war situation--like a war fever. We felt in our bones that war, war\nis coming. They dig trenches. They took away the young people to the...to the army; and\nwe, we knew for sure that war is going to break out any...any day. We were preparing for\nwar. We know. It's nothing we could do. We uh...we heard in the radio--for example, in\nour building it was two radios, and people were getting together to listen to the news. It\nwas not like uh we know today, that every family has a radio or TV. It was one radio in a\nbuilding, and it was enough. This, this was our contact with the world; and we heard the\nthe speeches from...from Hitler. We, we heard the...the speeches from Polish officials,\nand we know that any day we're going to be 1n the war. And sure enough...I remember\nlike today. It was Friday morning, September the Ist. We heard that this is war. And uh\nthe same day we, we, we heard German planes already; and three days later--it was the\n3rd of September--it came uh an order over the radio that all young people should move,\nget away in...towards Warsaw, to the east. Because the Germans are approaching, they\nwill need us to go into the army. And we, we...we packed our few things and we left. I\nleft my mother and...and my sister behind; and uh the men--even my, mine ten year old\nbrother--what also we were going to...towards Warsaw. Like the order said. We found\nout later that this was a German provocation. The...the voice on the radio was not from\nthe Polish government. It was from the German government, actually. Uh the Germans\nmade...tricked us; and they want to jam the roads so the Polish Army would have\ndifficulties to move. And sure enough...when we came on the road, we saw what's\nhappened. The, the vehicles couldn't move. The the the the the troops couldn't move.\nEverything, every road was jammed with refugees, with people going towards Warsaw.\nOn the way--it was not far away from Lodz, just uh several kilometers--German planes\nstart to bomb us. We...and many of those refugees were killed, right there on the fields. In\na little town near... outside Lodz, [Bierzyn (ph)], it was like one huge cemetery...\nrefugees [ (ph)] laying all over the fields--uh, injured, dead. And this was our first day\nactually that we experienced the war. And uh whatever we took with us, uh we had just\nenough food for a day or so. Soon we found out, little by little, actually there is no sense\nof running anymore; because with the German planes controlled the roads. They\ncontrolled the skies. It was no defense whatsoever. Even the Polish army was\ndisorganized. They could not understand where they had...they lost communication with\neach other, and we decided--uh, I mean, me, my...my brother, my father--that there's no\npoint in running. Maybe we should return back to L\u00e9dz, to...to our family, to the mother\nthat we.... And after another day, uh we decided there's no point in in running any longer.\nAnd we started to...to go back. On the way back, we met already the...the Polish Army\nlike uh uh...like they would quit. There's no point. And we came back...this was, uh...we\ncame back by Friday. It was...actually it was a Fri...the following Friday. After a week,\nwe came back to Lodz. And the same uh evening, the German, uh, patrols already came\ninto the city; and it was a Saturday when they marched in... into...to the city of Lodz. At\nthat day, we all stood and watched. Lodz also had a large German ethnic population, and\nimmediately they came out and start to throw flowers and candy at them, to welcome\nthem, finally, uh...like they would be liberated by the German army. For us Jews, the\nnightmare started that day; because, uh, here and there we saw already Jewish people\nwere beating [NB: beaten] up. And uh even our Polish neighbors took advantage of the,\nyou know, the long antisemitic feeling. They had a chance now to display, because\nnobody would protect any Jew anymore. And uh, religious Jews were caught in the street,\nand beards were shaved off. Uh, some beards were teared out from the faces, to the point\nthat blood came out. And Jews were caught in the street like uh dogs, and taken to work\nuh in doing all kinds of things. Every German had the right to do this. The civilian\nGerman population, the ethnic Germans, uh immediately they...they took out of the\nswastika armbands and they put on; and they became the masters of the street. Uh Jews\nused to own in business. They...everything was closed. And uh they they also threw out\nJews from homes, better looking homes. Immediately every German had the right to do\nthis. He just came in and said, \"Get out!\" And they took over and it...all the rights were\ntaken away immediately, the first day the German troops entered the city of Lodz. A Jew\nhad no right whatsoever. And uh at...by us, we...after a few weeks uh official Germans\nca...officers, they came into our home, to our...even to the apartment, the big apartment\nbuilding that we lived. And they gave us five minutes to leave the house, to leave our\napartment; and my mother said, \"Where should we go?\" He said, \"You should....\" It\nseems that he understood that question. Uh he said, \"I would suggest that you go to\nBa_uty.\" Ba_uty was a...a section, a very poor, it were the slum section of the city of\nLodz. He visualized that this is going to be the area for Jews to live, where Jews would\nbe forced to live. Uh so my mother start packing. He said, \"You don't have to pack. You\njust take uh the...your, your coat, and you...you take just the bread, the food that you\nhave. And you leave the house. Otherwise you will be thrown out.\" So my mother said,\n\"But uh we...we have a family. I have to take a few things. My little kid, you know, he'll\nneeds clothes.\" He said, \"Well, if you stay and talking, what there's now you got only\nthree minutes time.\" So my mother run to the...to the...to the closet, you know, and she\nstart uh to pack. And then he saw that there was a fur coat. He said, \"No, this you're\ngoing to leave.\" He didn't let her take. So we took just a few things. My father took uh a\nbox of tools; so he went over and checked the box of the tools, and see if there is not\nanything uh is not hidden under there. And so when we were about to leave the\nhouse...you see, my mother stood there by the...by the door and looked around our\napartment. And then he said that she should take off the pearls that she wore. So she took\noff the pearls and throwed away on the floor. And then he made her pick it up from the\nfloor and put it on the table; so she took the...the pearls from the floor and just throw it on\nthe table. And we walked out from our house, and here we stay on the street with no\nplace where to go. So we start walking to Ba_uty, to that section. And there already was\nsome kind of Jewish organization. They call it the [Geminde (ph)], the [Gemeinde (ph)];\nand they took all the refugees from--because they knew that building are coming to the\nghetto--and they gave us some kind of a shelter. And we did get an apartment through the\nJewish Council in that, in that section. We did get another apartment. It was a one-\nroom...we did not have a big apartment before. It was two, two rooms and a kitchen; but\nhere we got one room apartment. And please, we were so lucky. Everybody envied us\nthat we still had a roof over our head. And we start...we made that home; and later on, a\nfew months later, this was the official section for Jews to live. It was the ghetto. And\nJews were ordered from all of the sections in in the in the part of the town where we used\nto live, to leave. When we...we were a regular...thrown out actually from one building;\nbut then all the Jews in the city were ordered to leave. And it was like an exodus, you\nknow--like another war, where you could see through the city to the, to the...to the\nstreets, storming people with their belongings, whole families. They took carriages and\nmake uh little wagons. They took everything they could and load it up on those uh\ncarriages and wagons, and it's on backs; and they stormed into the ghetto. And that's how\nthe ghetto was formed. It was a very small part of town, mostly slums. And that's how a\nhundred and seventy-five thousand people were crowded 1n, in that uh.... Rooms had to\nbe shared for families. We, we were fortunate enough to have our own apartment. We\ndidn't have to share with nobody. It was that time uh...my, my father--I forgot to tell you-\n-my father at that time took some of the belongings and...and went to a small town where\nhis his sister lived and.... Just to put it away there. And by that time the ghetto was\nclosed, and you could not come back; and he was separated from us all through the war\nand we never saw him again. Uh my brother decided, one brother of mine that's younger,\ndecided that uh he will try his luck and go to that part of Russia...that Russia occupied, a\ncity by the name of \"Bia_ystok.\" Well, actually he told me to come with him. So I just\ncouldn't. My father was gone. And he...he went away because he had arrangement with\nsome friends; and he tried to stay in Bia_ystok. Now there was my mother, and a kid\nbrother only ten years old, and...and my sister. I just did not have the heart to leave them.\nAnd I decided to stay in the ghetto with them. And by May the Ist, the ghetto was...was\nclosed. And was like...like a big prison, barbed wires around, armed guards every few\nfeet. And this was our...our life, that time--1940. How did we live? Everybody still had\nsome, you know, money. And there is, there was some food to buy here and there. But we\ncould see the writing on the wall, what's going to happen next month, and a month later.\nThe Jewish Council that was formed came up with an idea that we should organize shops\nand work; and this was the... the plan that the the elders of the ghetto uh came up to the\nGerman peo...to the German authorities: that we have tremendous resources in the ghetto.\nWe got shoemakers--experts. We got tailors. We got weavers. We got such good\ncraftsmen that maybe we can interest German industrialists to use, to make use out of\nthose talents. And they did, for their...for their own reason. This, for them...a chance to\nhave a big bureaucracy. They wouldn't have to go to the Front. They employed a lot of\npeople. It's still better to guard Jews than to go to the Front. And uh and this was going\non for...until 1944. But conditions were worsening with every month, because it was less\nand less and less food. You see, we understood that the German people...the whole ghetto\nwas designed, actually, to starve the people out. Uh if the if the war would last another\n' According to Hilberg, the order to close the ghetto was issued May 10, 1940. See Hilberg, The\nDestruction of the European Jews, vol. 1, p. 223.\nten years, they would liquidate the entire ghetto without firing one shot; because the\nstatistics showed that every month more people died and died. Uh from families that used\nto be five people, there are only three; because people were dying out...and getting\nsicker...and getting smaller. And we could see they emaciated up to nothing. People start\nto look like skeletons. And it came to a point that people couldn't even work; and the\nwork was (cough) compulsory. We have to go work. If you miss a day of work, you get\nless food; because the, the, the place of work provided one soup a day. So if you didn't go\nto work, you get one soup less. You have to just make with that little food that you got\nfrom the monthly rations.",
        "A: During the war?",
        "A: OK. When we get up in the morning, all four of us, we had to prepare for work. I start off\nwith...with my mother. My mother worked at a...at the place where they used to, to, to...\nfuel, to distribute the fuel for the house. Coal. It's a.... So she had to go to work in order\nto get that pot of soup. My sister went to work in a...in a...a place where they used to\nmake shoes out of straw; used for the German army on the front, so when they stood\nguard they shouldn't freeze their feet. So those big shoes she used to make out of straw.\nMy little brother worked in uh one of the tailor shops, in the office; he was a runner. And\nI went to work as a tailor in the factory for uniforms. When we came to work 1n the\nmorning, we start...we started uh by...by the machines, of course, and we were making\nthe German uniforms. But uh the minute I sat down, un...until we finish, that's all it was\nin my mind at that time is twelve o'clock when we will go, we'll have a break and we'll\nget something to eat. Because I was constantly hungry. The...the hunger didn't leave me,\nbecause the little food that we had at home uh in, in the morning--it was one piece of\nbread that I ate in the morning, and the se...the other piece I took with me to have it in the\nshop. And I...I kept it in my pocket, or I kept it in in the pot that I took with me for\nthe...for the soup. Everybody had a little pot with them. And we could not wait; and this\nwas everybody. The whole day, it was in my mind. In the meantime, work has to be done.\nIt was strictly controlled. And twelve o'clock, the minute we have the break we have to...\neverybody was running for the soup. This was the major event in the...in the day. After\nwork, we came home. Uh if it was summer, it was bearable. In the wintertime, it was no\nfuel. It was cold. Uh, most of the furniture was gone already because we break, broke it\nup and burned it just to keep warm. And the minute we were ready with that little supper\nthat we had from the...we, we finished it all together. And then we went to bed, to...even\njust to keep warm. Uh, and this...when it...most of the time uh, we stood [NB: stayed] in\nbed. The summertime, when it was warm, we used to go out. We also had to go to stay in\nline for the rations to...to get. And sometimes uh the staying in line meant hours. And me\nbeing the...the man of the house, it was up to me; because I would not have my mother\nstanding in line, or my sister or my little brother, but it...1t was up to me to...to bring in\nthe food from the rations. And uh it was very little left for social life. Me being eighteen,\nnineteen year old--for some people this is the golden age. Uh, I spent my eighteen and\nnineteen and twenty years in...in the ghetto of Lodz. Always hungry, always tired, uh\noverworked, and with no hope for the...for the future. I didn't see any hope. Later, after a\nfew years, I got involved in...1n, in some educational project. We started to...to write. I\nparticular was interested in writing something about the ghetto. And I developed some...\npeople say that I did develop some talent for poetry, which later on it was used by some\nJewish dramatists like [Jonah Stogow (ph)]. I was also at one time involved in teaching\nYiddish, because I was a student of the Yiddish school in...1n Lodz, of the [Medem (ph)]\nschool. And we taught. It was...this was illegal. It was not allowed to teach. My students\nwere not the children, actually. It was young uh girls--uh, at the age of fifteen, sixteen--\nwho were interested in knowing, because before the war they went to Polish school and\nYiddish was strange to them. In the ghetto, they got that chance. They considered this\npart of the social life; and also beneficially, because they learned a language. And to me,\nit was very rewarding, very satisfactory for a while. And for the...for a few years,\nactually, I did that kind of teaching in Yiddish.",
        "A: Yeah. Uh it was one German guard. He took some pleasure in abusing people physically.\nIt was a part of the ghetto where you used to cross from one...from one side to the other,\nunder guard. And this man many times stood there at those gates. And uh if he didn't like\nsomebody, or he went too fast, or he didn't take off his hat in the right way, or he'd\nwalked too slow, he went over to him (cough) and he punched him several times. And\nthat's how (cough) he got the name of \"The Boxer,\" because he used to box people. I\nlooked at that man several times, and somehow he registered in mine brain. At one time--\nit was in 1942, before that action that we used to call the \"Sperre\" [Translation:\n\"Closing,\" \"Closure\" (Ger)]|, that we were ordered for eight days not to leave the house\nand they selected all the people that got too weak to work anymore. The children--it were\nillegal to have children in...in the ghetto. The sick, the olderly [NB: elderly], that they\nconsidered useless people. But that...before this action actually started, they...they...all of\na sudden, they attacked the ghetto. They came in like a surprise, and they surrounded the\nhospital. And like wildfire the news spread that the Germans surrounded the hospital on\nLagowniecka Street. Before the war, this used to be the ...the....also a \"ambulance\"--like\nsocial...social medicine station [NB: perhaps \"ambulatorium\" (Pol), an outpatient facility\nof a hospital]. Kasa Chorych [NB: former National Health Service]. And we run over\nthere. It so happened that one of my friends was a patient at that hospital; because he had\nan attack, they took him to that hospital. And when I heard, the first name that came to\nmy mind, \"Oh, my God, Josek Feldman is in the hospital!\" And I run over and stood\nthere. I still had an hour before going to work, so I stood there for the hour and watched.\nWhat I saw, it's hard to describe, even. Wagons standing below the building, and nurses\nbringing out the patients and put them on the wagons. Uh some patients going on\nthemselves; like uh I saw them, they're going to the wagon. And then I saw from the\nsecond floor, they opened the window and people were throwing out sick people into the\nwagons. And who is there conducting the whole operation? That \"Boxer\"! Well, after the\nwar at one time I read in the paper that somebody is looking for me, that the the.... It was\nto the Jewish World Congress that were looking for me as a witness for that \"Boxer.\" Of\ncourse, I immediately replied; and I was called to the German Consul in Chicago and I\nwas told that somebody gave my name that I know what happened in that...1n that day. I\nsaid, \"I certainly do.\" I still don't know until today who gave my name; but I went to\nGermany and I testified against that \"Boxer,\" which I found out that his real name is\n\"Krisom\" because that's how they referred to him, \"Herr Krisom.\" And I was asked by\nthe prosecutor to...to tell what I know about him; and I told them the story about that\nhospital, what's happened in that...in that day. Uh, his lawyer asked me a question, if I\nknow for sure that the people were thrown out from the windows into the wagon. He said\nhow do I know for sure they were thrown out? Maybe they jumped out, out of fear, when\nthey saw the troops. They jumped out by themselves. So my question to him was, \"How\nabout the stretchers?\" People on stretchers. And also: belongings, packages, suitcases,\nbottles. Altogether were thrown out into the.... And then another question was put to me:\n\"Weren't you afraid to stay there and watch all this, with all the Germans around--with\nthat 'Boxer,' that you call him, around? Weren't you afraid to stand there? You told me\nthat he used to beat up people he didn't like.\" So I told them that I think that they wanted\nus to stay. If they wouldn't want us to stay there, they would chase us away. They want us\nto stay and observe all that fear, all that cruelty, that I did. Then the only defense was,\nfrom the lawyer in that same, that I mistake him for somebody else. They never denied\nthat such action happened there by the hospital. The only defense was: maybe it was\nsomebody else, not him. And sure enough, this was forty years later. I said, \"Looking at\nthat man I don't know if this is the man. I only know the 'Boxer.' And if he was the\n'Boxer,' he was the man.\" They showed me pictures from the past. I recognized him\nimmediately. And then they showed me different kind of hats that he wore, and I picked\nhis uniform. I picked his cap that he wore, and it was established that he was the one.\nAnd then the defense went--not referring to me, but referring to the prosecutor--that it\nwas a cruel war and every man in the war had to follow the orders, and this was the\norders. But I establish one point: that that action...that this man, Herr Krisom--or that one\nthat we called \"The Boxer\"--was in charge of that operation.",
        "A: The trial was in Bochum (Westphalia), West Germany. It was outside of Dusseldorf. It\nwas in 1978. I don't recall the exact date.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "A: Well, the most important is during the liquidation when we were running from the\ntransports, we were trying to stay in the ghetto, not to go away. Because to go away to\nnowhere, to a unknown destination, it's frightening. We don't know where. They...",
        "A: Yes. The the people from the ghetto was taken out constantly...five hundred, six hundred,\nthousand, and they...we were told that they going to be resettled in a different place. That\nthey need--for example, at one time they need strong people, so they took all the strong\nmen and they put them to work, and they send them away. For a while, their families\nused to get a letter or two--even money paid by the by the Jewish Council in the ghetto--\nto make us believe they're working someplace else, and that's is the pay the family is\ngetting. But after a while, it stopped. There were no more letters. No more money. We\ndidn't hear about them; like they were gone. And a few months later another resettlement\nprogram. They took away other people. They need another five hundred, or six hundred,\nor...or a thousand. It was little by little. The ghetto was getting smaller and smaller. The\npopulation dying, and putting...and sending away. Until it came to a point that\neverybody, the whole ghetto, is being liquidated. And everybody was going away. And\n...and this was the the time that we tried, we tried very hard to stay. We hide. We built\neven uh hiding places underneath, uh underneath cellars. We...we kept on running;\nbecause uh it looked like uh the minute we leave the the ghetto from there, that there's no\nplace left for a Jew to run. They even promised us that that we were going away we can\ntake our tools. We can take machinery with us to establish ourself in the new place. But\nthe question was: What is wrong with this place? Why, why do we have to be a new\nplace? Our...this is not paradise that we are here. They promised us a huge amount of\nfood at the train for three days. Everybody will receive a whole loaf of bread. This was a\ntreasure. It was like a bait. But still we were...we would like to stay in one place, because\none precious thing was left to us--the family was together. And this we felt, it's going to\nbe...the minute we go on the train, we're going to be separated. The men probably will go\nto work someplace else. We did not imagine anything worse than that, that probably the\nmen will work in one place. The women will work in another place, and the...the\nyoungsters will work someplace else. This alone was frightening for us. And it came to a\npoint uh that they used to hunt there from street to street. And transport was formed every\nday, and going to the train and sent away. People among us working at those transports,\nthey told us what is going on at the train and how the people are packed 1n those trains.\nUnhuman conditions. And the question was: if we were sent to work, to do some work,\nand that's how you transport people going to work? And it was...it became clear that this\nis the end. And we used to run as much as we could and hide, to avoid those transport\ngoing away. It came to a point when our part of the ghetto was sealed off; and it was no\nmore place to hide and no more strength to run. And if one member of the family gives\nup, the rest follow. My mother told us she cannot run no more. This is it. She would like\nto go to the train, and get at least a loaf of bread and go away. Lets happen what's happen.\nThen she suggested that maybe I should keep on hiding with my little brother, and she\nwith my sister would go with them. The minute she said that, my kid brother grabbed my\nmother's hand and start to cry. He said, \"No, I'm going with you, too.\" At that moment we\nall decided that we shall go together. Either we're going to live together, or we're going to\ndie together. We reported to the train depot. We came there. It was a huge crowd. The\nboxcars were waiting; and uh German troops, armed guards all around us. Some even had\ndogs on their leashes. And they divided groups of a hundred...a hundred to each boxcar,\nand we started to go to train. And sure everybody received a loaf of bread. Two kilo, will\nbe around four pounds of bread. We never had so much bread since the war started. A lot\nof people started to eat even before they boarded the box car. You know, they start\ntearing the bread apart and eating. And in an hour when we all were in...1n that box car, a\nhundred of them, he came over-- the one with the dog came over--and looked around, and\nhe took some people from the other group and added to our train; because he felt that we\nhave too much room. And this was in August 1944. It was a very hot day at that time.\nAnd after he added the other people, then they put those gates together and we heard that\nbig noise that he locked the boxcar. And there we were in that train, over a hundred\npeople. The only facility in the train was two buckets for over a hundred men, women\nand children; and the train was standing on one place. It was unbearable hot. Lack of air.\nSo some people had an idea that the minute we start moving, it's going to get cooler.\n(Cough) But at one moment we heard that the gate opened up in the boxcar, so we\nthought maybe they changed their mind. They're going to leave us out. But instead, they\nbrought a few dozen Jews discovered in a hiding place; they were all badly beaten up\nbecause they were hiding. I remember one young man, all his front teeth were kicked out.\nAnd one boy's face was so badly swollen, it was just a nose that we could see--no eyes.\nAnd they added to our car. And soon we started to move. It didn't cool off. And at one\nmoment, we heard a young teenage girl crying. She had to go to the buckets in front of\neverybody. Her mother, her sister tried to shield her with a coat. A man was begging the\npeople around to give a little more room his pregnant wife. Me being among the\nyoungsters, I was asked to climb up those packages, and look out to see where are we\ngoing. I start to reading signs. One recognized those names. He said that we are moving\nsouth towards Krakow. I also saw some Polish peasants lining the road. They were\nprobably used to those scenes, those trains. Some made signs to us, pointing to the sky.\nAnd some went with the fingers across this throat, the throat. I didn't tell the people what\nI saw; but I mentioned that later on, after the war, to the Polish alderman in Chicago, Mr.\nRoman [Pochinsky (ph)]. And he told me that, \"They tried to warn you that you going to\nbe killed, that you should try to run away.\" Well, I tried to believe that; but the\nexpression on their faces told me something else. It was late at night that we arrived at\nAuschwitz. When we came in, the minute the gates [NB: the doors of the train] opened\nup, we heard screams, barking of dogs, blows from...from those kapos--those officials\nworking for them, over the head. And then we got out of the train, and everything went\nso fast: left, right, right, left. Men separated from women, children torn from the arms of\nmothers, the olderly chased like cattle. The sick, the disabled, were handled like packs of\ngarbage. They were thrown in a side together with broken suitcases and with boxes. My\nmother run over to me and grabbed me by the shoulders, and she told me, \"Leibele, I'm\nnot going to see you no more. Take care of your brother.\" Well, my brother was twelve,\nthirteen at that time. Ten minutes later, Mengele, the doctor--I didn't know in that time...I\nsaw a handsome looking gentlemen with white gloves--pointed to my little brother to go\nto the left. And before I realized, he was gone and I didn't see him no more. I didn't know\nat the time that I was the lucky one; because when I went into the showers, from the\nshower heads we got water. Other people got poison gas. But when we came out from the\nshowers, the sky was red. The air was filled with smoke and the odor of burning flesh\nand...and hair. A man went over to those officials, and he asked one of those officials\n(ph)--he called them the \"kapos\"--he asked him about his wife and his little girl. And the\nman looked him straight in the eye. He said, \"There is no more little girl. There\nwas...there is no more wife.\" He said, \"What do you mean? Where they are?\" And he\npointed to the chimney with that...that smoke bursting out. \"That's their funeral. Here\nthey go.\" Well, the man didn't cry. He didn't scream. He just stood there and stared at that\nchimney. We all stared at it. We would stay there probably for hours. But we started to be\nchased into the block, to the barracks where we were marched over. We couldn't even\nrecognize each other. No hair. The hair was shaved off. Dressed in striped uniforms--too\nsmall, too big, too large, too short. We all looked like clowns. And then we were\nwelcomed by a speech from one of those kapos. He said, \"You saw that sign that 'Arbeit\nMacht Frei\u2019? That means 'freedom through labor.'\" He said, \"Don't make any mistakes.\nNobody needs your labor here. You did not come here to work. You came here to be\nkilled. You're just waiting your turn. And remember I don't have any...I don't have to\nhave a reason to kill you, if I want it. So you better do what you're told.\" Well, this was\nthe beginning of Auschwitz. Every morning that we went out to be counted, we could\nfeel the crematoriums burning. And that most disgusting odor is the burning of flesh and\nhair together. I decided to make every effort to do everything I can to go away from\nAus... Auschwitz. Because they were forming transport to go away to labor; because\nAuschwitz itself was an extermination camp, not a labor camp. But for the time being,\nthey...they used to send transport to go for work in labor camps. I didn't succeeded in the\nbeginning, but I...I still tried. I still tried. Uh, at one time they asked, \"Who knows, who\never worked in road construction?\" The minute I run over, and I said, \"I did.\" He said,\n\"Where did you work?\" I said, \"Outside of 6d_, when they build the highway.\" I never\nsaw any construction worked at all. So they put a few hundred together, and they put us\nin a site. So we were in the transport. All the rest start to get the tatoos to stay in\nAuschwitz, their number. And we were put on a transport; and I went to a labor camp\noutside in Silesia, in a place called Kaltwasser.\u201d Kaltwasser was a labor camp under\nconstruction. It was a beautiful area. They were building uh new roads and a small\nrailroad, and that's what we worked. The conditions that time: 1t was very hard. We didn't\nhave adequate clothes; and starting to get cold in the morning, especially when we stood\nto be counted. We were freezing. There were no beds in our barracks. They just put uh\nsome straw on the floor, and that how's we slept, in our clothes. And the work was very\n* Administered by Wiistegiersdorf (subcamp of Gro Rosen).

So we, we\nconsider ourself the lucky ones, that we got away from Auschwitz. The...we did not stay\ntoo long in that particular camp; because as work progressed, we were sent to a different\ncamp called Larche.\u2019 Was the same work, a continuation of the same work. And, uh,\nthere we also worked at the same thing, but the living conditions were a little better.\nThere were beds already--bunks--and we did receive, uh, warmer clothes. Uh, but\nfortunately that...that work, in...1n that was finished in...1n a very short time; and they\ndecided again send us to a different camp, in a place called Wolfsberg.\u00b0 Uh at that\nparticular camp, I met some people--those officials that knew my family from before the\nwar--and I did get a better job. I worked in the hospital, in the Revier, in that hospital in\nthat camp. And my situation improved a little bit, and so did my physical uh condition\nimproved. And there I stood [NB: stayed] until we could hear the Russian army already\napproaching. At night we heard cannon sound, and we felt that any day we're going to be\nliberated.",

        "A: ...Larche.",
        "A: In the hospital, I worked in a place called Wolfsberg, not Larche. Yeah. Well, uh, people,\nuh, if they had some minor accident or they got sick, they report to the doctor. Uh, they\ncame in, and the doctor prescribed how many days he can stay in that hospital. Three\ndays, four days. A lot of people, uh, tried to just get in to be away and to get some kind of\na rest, and to be away from that hard work. They couldn't take it no more. And some\nlegitimately got sick, and they reported to the hospital. They didn't get any treatment, uh,\nfor anything. They just laid there, just to stay away from work. And after a few days, the\ndoctor decided, \"You're all right now, and you can go.\" If somebody got seriously sick,\nsomebody made a report. And every few weeks they came and they took the peo--\nGerman people, you know, the Gestapo, whatever--and they took them away. They said\nthey took them away to a real hospital where they can get better treatment. Actually, they\nwere taken to Auschwitz to the gas chambers. And, for example, uh, people who knew\nthat, uh, they were seriously ill, they tried as much as they could to stay away from the\nhospital; because the hospital...they know if they happened to be so unlucky and this is a\ntime when the Germans come.... Because they come every once in a while to check on\nthis hospital, and they could tell.... They didn't, they didn't care about those people who\ntried to get away from work for a day or so. Whoever was ill, they were taken away; and\nthey...they said they take them to a hospital to be cured, but this was the end of them. Uh,\nthe end station actually was Auschwitz, or any other extermination camp. My work in\nthat hospital was, uh, to keep order. Uh, in the morning, uh, they come in. I had to count\nthe people, uh, to get them ready to...for inspection; and after...and also the food. I also\ndistribute the food for those people. Uh, in some cases, people who did not work received\nhalf of the normal rations. Not in that camp where I worked, but in other camps this was\nthe case. For example, this was the case in the last camp where I was liberated, later on.\nThis was the case that non-working people received half of the rations. But in that camp,\nuh, where I worked--in Wolfsberg--it was not too bad, you know. But the only thing\nis...three, four days was the maximum that, uh, a person was allowed to be sick. If there\nwas a serious sickness for longer, they took them away. Uh, at one time, they they came\nin and they took away almost half of the hospital. Yeah, a lot of people. For example, in\nour...our barrack where I was, uh, in charge--1t was some over eighty people--that they\ntook out about thirty, thirty five people away that they considered actually they were not\nuh...they were emaciated. They looked so bad. So they took them away. And the rest of\nthe people stood [NB: stayed]; and a lot of people were frightened, and they reported out\nthat they said that they feel better. They want to go out to work already.",
        "A: That was like I said, that we fe...we heard already noise of the...of the Red Army\napproaching. And at one day the...we were told to assemble, and we started to march on\nfoot. The clothes that we had, it was uh not adequate; because this was February already.\u201d\nIt was cold and snowing; and we were marching on these columns, quite uh...almost eight\nhundred people at that time, the whole camp. And we were marching through the fields;\nand uh...there was no food. We marched the first day, until it was dark. We passed a lot\nof hamlets, a lot of villages. People came out and they looked at us. They were probably\nused to that scenes already. And when we passed a place uh on the field. There were two\nhuge barns, and that's...that how we stood overnight. In the morning we start marching\nagain, the second day. And also until late at night; and it was no food, only that what we\ngot when we started. It was a loaf of bread, and some uh artificial honey, it was a lump;\nand that's how we marched through two days. On the third day we were also put in...in\nbarns, very big barns; and that's how we stood one day, and another day. And no food.\nThe people was starving to die, from starvation. They didn't get up. In the morning we\nused to touch each other to get up, and some didn't. When we walked out, and we just\nwalking around...I remember one instance that the other side of the wall was a horse. And\nI heard that that horse in a grubbing of some food. So I was by the wall. So I took away, I\ntore away a board from that wall; and I saw that the horse was eating beets, sugar beets.\nSo I tried to grab one from that horse. He almost bit my hand off. He didn't let me. So L...I\noutsmarted the horse. I took a piece of straw, and I started to tickle the horse on the head.\nSo the minute he picked up the head, so I grabbed a beet out from...and that's how I ate it.\nThe German guards saw that they...they wouldn't have no nobody to march with\nanymore, because people were dying so fast--and so many of them. They slaughtered a\nfew of those horses, and they told the people to cook some soup. And then we received\na...a warm soup out of that horsemeat. This was the third day. The fourth day they\nassembled us. We start marching; and I saw that we are marching to a train depot,\nbecause it was railroad tracks already. We came there. And if we thought that the...the\nride from 6d_ ghetto to Auschwitz was bad, this was even worse; because this was in\nthe wintertime and the train car were open cars. Coal cars, out in the open. And there\nwere we packed in. And also we received some bread, also a loaf of bread; and they told\nus to be careful with the bread because we don't know how long we're going to stay in\nthose trains. And it took about five days. In every car, I would say about ten percent,\nfifteen percent of the people died. In our car, I remember it was a father and two sons.\nAnd the father survived; both sons died in that train. And the minute they...he start to\nmove, the other grabbed his part of bread. We become like animals. But at this point, I\nwould like also to...to mention it, we passed in Czechoslovakia one town. I even\nremember the name today, for so many years. The name of that town was Stara Paka.\nAnd it was a factory next to that train station. And people from the fac... factory run out;\nand everybody took those lunches they had and threw in in our train. Some people threw\neven apples, that we didn't see for years already. And they threw in our train. The\n> 1945.\nGerman guards started to shoot on them from their rifles. They shoot in the air. They\ndidn't kill nobody. They shoot...they try to scare them away. They didn't react. I saw a\nyoung woman. When she saw us on the train, she went into those factory, start to ring a\nbell. And everybody came out with the...with the food, with lunches, and they threw in to\nour.... This was the Czech people in a town called Stara Paka. They took us...on the fifth\nday we arrived in Austria. And this was the end of our journey, a concentration camp\ncalled Ebensee. It was the overflow of Mauthausen. Mauthausen was such a cruel camp\nthat the Germans themselves called it \"Mordhausen,\" which means \"House of Murder.\"\nWhen we came to...to Ebensee, the hunger and the labor and the way--especially for us\nJews--the way we were treated, we were sure that not one will survive that camp. That\nthis was it. The charge, the man in charge of our block was a professional killer. He\nenjoyed so much killing people. The...the people who went to the hospitals when they\nwere sick there, hardly one came out alive. The people who were not working, who were\nin that hospital: Jews received half of the rations that the normal worker received; non-\nJews they gave the regular rations if they were not too long in that hospital. The...we\nwent, I remember, to the shower in that camp. It was the end of February or the\nbeginning of March [NB: 1945]. It was still cold. When we came out from the shower,\nwe stood outside...I don't know how long. Without clothes. Without...without wiping\nourselves off. I would never believe that a person can survive standing in the outside in\nthe wintertime without clothes for so long. We were waiting 'til we get our bundles of\nclothes from disinfection, and then we run back to the block. I remember standing on\nthat, waiting for my clothes, like a pelican. I stood on one foot, and then I changed. I put\ndown the other foot, and I picked up the other foot. I didn't realize that this is possible for\na person to survive, but apparently it 1s possible. I did it. In that... in that camp we worked\nin tunnels. The...we built tunnels in behin...below the mountains. They decided to put the\nmunition factories inside those tunnels to be away from the bombing. The work was hard,\nno food; because scared...even the German guards were fighting for food for themselves.\nThe...1t was the end of the war. Conditions were terrible for everybody. Many times\nthe...there were bombings. Uh, we saw the planes coming. At one time, we stood; we\ncan't work. Bombs start to drop; and uh the Germans were running, hiding. We didn't. I\nstood there, and I did not care if I'm going to get killed or not. I was just looked up in the\nsky, and I was just looking that the bombs should drop. Nobody even cared anymore.\nSometimes people wonder, \"Why are you not afraid to die?\" Because when you are in\nsuch a condition that uh...that you really don't care no more, people are not afraid of to\ndie. I was not afraid to die. When we were led to a...a place of work in the morning--it\nwas around five or six kilometers--there was a pile of potatoes laying. The Germans\nknew that we're going to grab them. They stood with the big sticks, and everybody get\nnear those piles was beaten. And uh we didn't care. And I saw, for example, that they\ndrop the stick on somebody's head and the man started to bleed. And then I figure out that\nit must take time 'til they get the stick up. In the meantime, I--just like...like lightening--I\njumped on that pile; and I grabbed two, three potatoes and I run back. So he could have\nsplit my head, too. And I knew it, but I didn't care. In the meantime, I ate raw potatoes.\nThat's what hunger can do to a person. We can see what it does to a body, but it's very\nhard to describe what it can to do a person's mind. You gave up on life. I did. Until I was\nliberated, we also experienced a terrible ordeal. At one morning, we were told that we're\nnot going out to work. Is it in Ebensee, in this hell? They let us stay home? They said,\n\"You're not going out to work.\" They said, \"But the American army is approaching the\ncamp, and we decided that we have to go and hide because they're going to bomb that\ncamp. They might think this is a military camp. And that we should go and hide in those\ntunnels in the mountains.\" So one of those Kapos--he was a Frenchman--he got up, and\nhe says, \"No!\" And he starts screaming, \"No! No! No go to the stalls!\" So people was\nconfused. \"What do you mean?\" He said, \"Dynamite in the stalls!\" They had prepared\ndynamite charges, and they were ready to blow us up in the last minute. So that the...the\naltester from the...from the camp said, \"If you don't want to go hide, it's OK. You can\nstay here in the camp.\" And the next day in the morning, tanks came in. The American\ntanks came in, and we were free. Then I went to the hospital, uh, in the area to...I had at\nthat time weighted a hundred, a hundred and seventy kilogram. Uh, this was almost a\nhundred pounds.",
        "A: Well, people were crying. People were hugging each other. They climbed up on those\ntanks. They were sticking to the tanks like flies. And, uh, they...already they realized at\nthat time the enormity of their tragedy. Especially for us Jews. People started to make the\npreparations to go home. Delegations came in from France, from Russia, from Poland;\nyou know, to get their people together. Nobody came for us. Nobody even was interested\nwhat is going to happen to the Jews. We had no homes to go. Our homes were destroyed.\nThere were no Jews. They came, and they explained it to us that \"Soon you will receive\nsome information how to get together.\" The Jewish Agency came and want to take us to\nPalestine. And they were told us Polish Jews, \"You're not even welcome back in Poland.\"\nThe French government wanted the Jews to come back, but there were very few. But the\nbulk of the Jewish population was from Russia, from Poland, from Hungary. Some did go\nback after the liberation, and some came back to the camps. They said, \"There is no more\nplace for us in our home.\" Especially in Poland. A Jew came back, and he said he almost\ngot killed when he tried to reclaim his hou... his house. And we decided to stay there. We\nestablished some kind of a Jewish community in Austria, some in Germany or in Italy. I\nwas in Austria. I worked for uh the Jewish Central Committee. My boss was the famous\nNazi hunter, Simon Wiesenthal, who headed the political department. Also the\ndocumentation center. He published our bulletin, that I was also involved because the\nYiddishe [Rundschau (ph?)]. I worked in the cultural department of...in Linz, Austria.\nUntil uh.... By the way, I also met my wife, that I knew from the ghetto, in Austria. We\ngot married and we lived in Linz, where I worked in the Central Committee of the Jews\nin Austria. Until we emigrated. We received a visa through the HIAS, and we came to the\nUnited States. But uh the memories of the Holocaust, from those camps-- especially that\none scene that when my mother grabbed me by the shoulders and said, \"I will never see\nyou again,\" that I should take care of my little brother--this stays with me for all those\nyears. And I'm sure it will never leave me.",
        "A: The effect is that I got some, I feel that I have a responsibility to tell the story about the\nHolocaust. But I never dreamed that a time will come that I will have to convince the\npeople there was such a thing as a Holocaust. Beside all the ...the fact and documentation\nand witnesses, there are people who denied it, that said there wasn't a Holocaust. This I\nnever thought that I will have to do. I feel some kind of a responsibility towards future\ngenerations. I tell...I talk to my children about it. A lot of people--friends of mine--tried\nto spare their children, and their grandchildren, those horrible experiences that they went\nthrough. I think it was wrong. I feel that we should make every effort for the world to\nlearn the lesson of the Holocaust, so such an event should never, never happen again. To\nno people. I'm very sensitive at the misery of other people. Mainly because I'm a Jew,\nand I know what it means. The Holocaust Museum that is being built in Washington now\nmeans quite a bit to me. Mainly, it is not a Jewish project. It's an official United States\ninstitution, I feel, just like the Smithsonian Institute or the Library of Congress. Because\nif a revisionist goes who say that the Holocaust is a lie, I can tell him that the government\nof the United States said it is true. And go to Washington, and see for yourself. Yad\nVashem, it's also does a tremendous job, but they can say it's a Jewish institution. That\nboxcar who 1s in the Washington Museum, has...is significant because it was given by a\nPolish government. Just like the boat from Denmark was given by the Danish\ngovernment. That's why this museum means quite a bit to me. That mean this is one more\nway that the world will learn the lesson of the Holocaust. It is a mission that's almost\nsacred. (Pause) OK?\n"
