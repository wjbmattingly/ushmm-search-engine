        "Q: Would you tell me your whole name and when and where you were born?",
        "A: My name 1s Sonja Gottlieb Ludsin and I was born in Riga, Latvia in 1923, the twentieth of\nOctober, 1923. I lived in Latvia, with my family. And the War broke out.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about what your life was like, before the War.",
        "A: Okay. There were six children, four brothers, two sisters, my father and my mother. The\nRussians came in the year before the Germans. They took two of my brothers to fight against\nthe Germans. We did not know what happened to them. And then Germany came into\nLatvia. They separated our family by taking the young ones and putting them to work in big\napartment buildings, that they made in factories, for the SS men. Whoever was able to make\nshoes, worked so, or make clothes for them, of any kind. We used to work from the home, at\nfirst. And then they put us in a ghetto. In Latvia itself, they had two ghettos. One was\n, and one was . Not , -- . L landed in . Then they\ntransferred me to . And it was -- I did not know where the rest of my family was.",
        "Q: Let's go back a little bit. Tell me before, how old you were. And tell me a little bit about your\nfamily life. Were you happy? Tell me about your school, and tell me about the things -- the\ndreams that you and your siblings had.",
        "A: We were a very, very happy family. Because each one of us did something of musical (sic.).\nMy sister was an opera singer at the age of 17. She was the first Jewish girl accepted to the\nLatvian Opera. It was just the most thrilling, the most wonderful thing anybody -- parents\ncan imagine. My brother sang. I sang. We all played the piano. One played the guitar. One\nplayed another guitar, or like a -- what do you call it? I can't think of the word, the\ninstrument at the moment. But we were a very, very happy family. There was never just us\nalone in the house. There was always a friend of mine, or a friend of my brother, or maybe\nboth. And we all ate together. And we all had a very beautiful life. These are my memories\nof my family. My parents were young. At this stage, I realize just how young they were.\nBecause my mother was only 49 years old and she was killed by the Germans. And my\nfather was 50. I didn't know what happened to them. I was 14 years old. So, when I was\nconcentrated in the Latvia ghetto, they still -- my hopes were still that I was going to see my\nfamily. I was sure that my family is going to be saved, like I thought I was, not knowing\nwhat was happening to them. Now, my two older brothers, they were chosen to go in the\nwoods, to fight against the Germans, because they were already with the Russian army.\nBecause Russia came in a year before Germany. And then we were only left a few. But I\nthought they were alive. In that Latvian concentration camp we had a lot of Christian\nprisoners. What they did, to be prisoners, I did not know. But they were above us. They were\nlike capos, they called them. And they were very cruel. But we still walked from the ghetto\nto these different places, to be useful. I told them I could sew, which I learned -- I taught\nmyself. And I sitting on sewing on machine, part of the German, the Nazis' clothing. And we\nactually only lived on hopes.",
        "Q: The ghetto, the ghetto was formed after some big action, where a lot of people were killed; is\nthat correct?",
        "A: Yes. The ghetto was -- the ghetto was formed -- it was separated. You see, everybody that\nthey shipped from Germany they shipped to the Latvian ghetto. Families came from\nGermany, from Poland, from different places. They were separated from us. They split the\nghetto. And there was a small ghetto, because Latvia was not a big city. They took the very\nworst neighborhood, like, and they made it into a ghetto by wiring around it. Now, we were\nhappy as long as we were together. But, we lived now in two rooms, three families. At that\ntime, we were four children and my mother and father. Then when we went to work, in that\nplace, for the SS men, one day I heard that when we go back, there is going to be massive\nkilling of all the ghetto people. Because they were bringing in more and more trains from\nother countries. So, naturally, we wanted to be with our loved ones, but we also wanted to\nsave ourselves. Now, by the end of the day, get picked out the oldest people, the weakest\npeople. My youth helped me. And I knew somebody who was like a foreman. He was\nJewish, too. But he was the one who relayed the messages from the SS men to us. They\ndidn't speak to us. He spoke to us. And he was influential enough to put me aside, with\nanother few people. And not turn me back to the ghetto. Because that meant death. Now, the\nemotion that I had, to go back to the ghetto, was very, very hard. At this point I couldn't\nmake up my mind. And it wasn't a question of my mind. He saved me. He was alive until\nrecently. I saw him, and I thanked him, again, and again, and again. So we knew that that\nghetto was liquidated. And new people were brought in, from other countries. What they did,\nthey left us in that place and I worked there. And I lived there. But we were very few lucky\nones.",
        "Q: Tell me in that incident, who was the man, and how old were you, and where were your\nbrothers, or did you know where your brothers were, and who kept you from going back?",
        "A: Now, what happened was, I was still the same age, because it didn't take that long in Latvia.\nMaybe I had reached the age of 15, at the time. They heard that all the people who were in\nthe ghetto, the Latvian Jews and whoever lived in that ghetto were brought to a mass -- in the\nwoods. And they had big, tremendous grave dug out, where they shot them, threw them into\nthe grave, with shovels. And some of them were not killed by the bullet, were still alive. And\nthey were thrown into that same grave. And then they put the dirt over them. And even the\nones that were alive was killed. And I found out -- I found that out afterwards. There was\nrailroad man, the man that used to control the railroad closing and opening -- he witnessed\nthis thing. And he said -- he was not Jewish, he just lived there. And he said, \"I will never,\never be able to shut out the scenes and the horrors that the people that were trying to save\nthemselves, and couldn't. I cannot sleep. I cannot get it out of my mind. It is very difficult for\nme, which is very much -- to understand how it really affected a man who was totally\nremoved from it. After that, when they killed everybody in that massive grave, they\nliquidated the place where I was working. And they said they were going to send us to\nGermany, to a beautiful place. We were very few.",
        "Q: The man who saved you, what was his name?",
        "A: His name was Aaronson (ph.). He was actually, in normal times, he was a cellist, a very\nwell-known cellist. And he was in charge, like I said, to relay the messages, between the SS\nmen and us. And his name was , which was his stage name. But it was\nAaronson. I didn't know whether he was alive or not, afterwards. But I just -- I was in touch\nwith him, not too long ago. He lived in Texas. I spoke to him over the phone, and I thanked\nhim. And I told him I will never forget him, as long as I live. And I didn't, because he saved\nmy life.",
        "Q: Where were your brothers, at the time of the action?",
        "A: My two brothers that were sent in the woods when the Germans fought the Russians, I don't\nknow what -- I didn't know what happened to them. My other two brothers, on the other\nhand, I didn't know what happened to them. And my sisters, and my parents, I didn't know\nwhat happened to them. So, there I was, maybe 14 and a half, 15 years old, and I had no idea\nof where my family was. They -- when they told us they were going to ship us to Germany,\nthey piled us up in a big, huge fishing boat, which was totally empty inside. It had -- we were\nhundreds of us, from both the ghettos. And they put us in a standing position. There was no\nroom to sit down. There were no toilets. There was no food. And they shipped us to\nGermany. When we arrived there, in order to get where we had to go, they got us out of the\nboat, the ship, whatever you call it, and they put us in the trains, where they ship animals.\nThose trains -- what a horror. I can smell it now. And I remember so vividly, that it follows\nme. I just saw the Holocaust Museum and I saw that train. And I felt such emotions, that I\ncouldn't even cry, because when you live anything 1n life, like that, for five years, you cannot\ncry at sadness. I cry at gladness, because if I go to a birthday party, or any surprise party, it\ntouches me and I cry. When it comes to sadness, I don't whether it made me the more -- not\nstronger, but maybe I have more control over myself. Now, we arrived with the trains, at\nnight, in the rain, and these SS women wore capes with hoods. And we looked out of the\ntrain, and we saw the capes with hoods. And these women -- because we did not have SS\nwomen in Latvia. They only came into the picture in Germany. We looked out, and we saw\nthe camps. Then there was beautiful green grass and barracks. So we thought maybe we will\nfind our loved ones there. Maybe they were shipped on a different shipment. But it wasn't.\nThey weren't there. And they chased us into those barracks. And the barracks were the most\nhorrible thing. The -- what do you call it? The bunks were not as wide and the one that is at\nthe Museum. They were narrower. At the other camp, later on, they were as wide as the one\nat the Museum. And we had to sit, four of us, in one -- in one -- what 1s it called again?",
        "Q: Bunk.",
        "A: Bunk. It was three levels. The lights were dim, and we had one girl from Poland who was\npregnant, because she came into the picture later on. And she was pregnant, and the SS\nwomen knew that she was pregnant. And she gave birth. And we all listened. And we heard\nhow she cried, and how the baby was delivered. And she delivered it herself. And one of the\nSS women actually helped her. Then they made a little partition, and they put that baby\nwhere we could hear it. It was a little girl. And they allowed her to breast feed the baby. And\nthen, when the baby was two weeks old, they told her, she can't breast feed the baby\nanymore. She had to let the baby die. And we all died with it. I mean, that was so horrible.\nWe listened, the baby was crying, and crying, and crying. And no food was given to her, and\nshe died. And we had to comfort the mother. We were a lot of women in that bunk. But were\nall like one, all like one. Now comes the picture, where I -- we were starved. We were\nunder-nourished, with rashes on our bodies. We were shaved. I had a rash that covered my\nentire body. And I was in agony. But you can take a lot of pain, when you are young. Now,\nthe SS women were very cruel. They were crueler than the SS men. We had no toilets. We\nhad -- we did not have a period, because they gave us something in the so-called soup. It was\ngiven to us once a day. Even the circumstances that we lived in, we had no periods. So that\neliminated about how can we protect ourselves, if we don't have a period? And they dug a\nlong narrow strip outside, with a board across. That was our toilet, outside. And there were\ndays when it was like 30 below zero. We had to go and pull our clothing off. It freezing, just\nfreezing. But things were so sad that -- we were young, and we sat in those bunks, and I\nsang. I sang all kinds of songs. And then this SS woman came in, and she says -- she took the\nblack -- I don't know what you call it, but the policemen wear it. The black stick, the black --",
        "Q: Nightstick?",
        "A: Yeah, and she beat. And she said, \"You have it so good that you sing?\" Because you never\nanswered an SS woman. Then she remembered that I sang. And every time they took us out\nto be counted, which was four in the morning, twelve at night, any time they desired. And it\nwas beastly cold, in the winter. They counted us. They chased us in, back to the barracks.\nAnd anything that we could get to be busy with -- I personally always lifted my arm, no\nmatter what they asked. Can you sew? Yes. Can you clean? Yes. Can you go there? Yes.\nCan you go pick up the soup for the barracks? Yes. I always went. Then you be better. Then\nyou be better than any other prisoner. Maybe there were three or four more. And then they\nmade the Jewish men into capos. They called them capos. And they put a band around their\narms. And they had to hit us, chase us, hit us, get us out of the barracks as fast as possible, to\nbe counted. That was their pleasure. The Jewish boy that was concentrated there, like Hitler\nsaid, \"We don't have to kill the Jews. The Jews will kill each other.\" And in circumstances\nlike that, that is exactly what was happening. Those few guys who were the capos, they took\na bigger piece of bread. They took another dish of soup, which deprived us of having us\nwhat we were entitled to, because we were so starved. We were swollen from hunger. My\nlegs were twice, three times the size. And one day, there was a men's camp further out. And\nin order for them to get their rations of food, which was a big kettle, like, where the soup was\nin, they had to go to the women's camp to reach the kitchen. And somebody hollered out to\nme, \"Sonya, I just saw one of your brothers.\" And I ran out and I screamed at him, and it was,\none of my brothers, in the same place. It was the most unbelievable happening. And there\nwas this one SS woman, she was over six feet tall. And she was the meanest, meanest, most\nhorrible human being anybody can imagine -- even Napoleon. She took me and she said\nagain, you have it too good. You just made contact with the men. And I said to her, \"This\nwas my brother.\" And it didn't matter. They never hit us in the middle of the room. They\nalways put us against the wall. And then she slammed my face. She knocked my teeth out.\nAnd also you got like a back knock, at the wall. That was the purpose of the wall. So you get\na double pain. And she beat me until I just fell down and I just couldn't take it. I just laid\nthere. And it didn't bother her. And she just walked away. And she says, \" Now you're going\nto know you will never, ever make any motions to anybody.\" And we stayed there. And that\nactually was not a death camp. That actually was a camp that they took us out and brought us\nto an ammunition factory, where we used to -- it was a huge place. They made the bombs for\n-- the large bombs. And we were making them. I was upstairs with the women. And\ndownstairs were the men. And there again, I knew, my God, I was downstairs. And I was\nlucky enough -- and that is why I feel that my life had many miracles. I was lucky enough\nthat they asked, in that factory, \"Who can speak German fluently?\" And I said, \"I can.\" And\nI was the interpreter between him and the Jewish girls that came from Poland. The\nHungarian girls came in later on in the War, because Hungary was not jet included. And I\nrelayed the message, what they had to do next, whether he had complaints about anybody.\nWe were so undernourished, we didn't have the strength. We couldn't work on those\nmachines. They were big, huge machines. So, they put a white band on my arm, and they\nalways used me as an interpreter, between the Polish girls who did not speak German,\nbetween the Hungarian girls who did not speak German, between all the other ones who did\nnot speak German. And he was actually nice to me. And he threw slices of bread under the\nmachine, as he passed by, because he had to be careful. Once I got those extra few slices of\nbread, I was able to give my brother the bread that I got, legally. But how do I get to my\nbrother? I cannot go downstairs. So, this SS man, when he spoke to me, and he gave me the\norders, and he told me what to do, and who to tell what they have to do, he spoke to me very\nnicely. And I said to him, \"You know what you did was wonderful. And being as you are so\nwonderful, can you help me to get my slice of bread to my brother?\" And he says, \"Yes, I\nwill. \"He made me take a bomb. He put it in my arms, and says follow me. And he got me\ndown to the lower level, where my brother was working. And that was called the ;\nwhich meant that when the bomb was made upstairs, they had to use very hot ovens, to\nfinish it off. I don't know the technical way, how they finished it off, but it was like 120\ndegrees in there. And my brother was there, undernourished, just as swollen as I was. And he\nstood there, and he watched, the other SS men wouldn't see him. And I threw that bread\nunder that machine. And my brother got the bread. And I did it as often as I could. But that\nwas still while we were working. Now, we were shipped to another camp.",
        "Q: What was that camp called?",
        "A: We didn't know, at that time. But we landed in and they were putting numbers on the\nprisoners. And they just sent us to there, through another camp, which was called ;\nAnd that was a death camp. There was no work. There was no nothing. There was just --\nevery day was elimination. They counted us. One, two, three, out. One, two, out. One, four,\nout, which meant they were going to be burned in the ovens. So, knowing that at any time\nthey were about to pick me, they knew me, the SS women. And they said to each other,\n\" , which means later. They are not going to take you now. But they didn't say it in\nthat many words. So I was happy. I figured this was wonderful. How long is this going to\nlast? Because we were getting less, and less every day. They were eliminating, they were\nkilling. They were awaiting for new shipments. And also in this shipments (sic.) came with\nthe trains. They were all told they could take their personal belongings. Everybody thought\nthey were going live, so their personal belongings consisted of shoes, and a little clothing,\nand maybe even a little bit of jewelry, thinking that they were going to buy themselves out of\nthe hardest. Now, we had to go to those trains, and we had to -- they had to throw out their\nbelongings, their valise. And we had to open them, and sort them out, where the Nazis\nhelped themselves to it. And it was just people who were coming -- coming to be killed. But\nthey didn't know that. So, that was the second most horrible thing in my life, or the third. I\nalso was very happy that I was with the Polish girls, the Jewish Polish girls. They had a lot of\nvigor. They were never afraid. Before that death camp, when we were sent out to work, they\nmade contact, somehow. And they used to bring in, either between their legs, or someplace,\na piece of bread. And they got -- they heard of it, the SS men, and they stopped the entire --\nall of us, coming in from work, to the camp, and they looked all over and they said, \"You\nwill tell us who is bringing in what. And if you don't, we're going to put you outside, and we\nare going to pour water over you. You are going to be on your knees. And you will freeze to\nthe ground.\" Which we did. We all went out, the way they chased us out. He had us on our\nknees. It was late at night. It was bitter cold. It was way below zero. And they poured pails of\nwater over our bodies. And we froze to the ground. We could not lift our legs up. But none\nof us told them who brought that piece of bread in. None of us. And they saw, the following\nmorning, they got us up, somehow, and they left us alone. Because they saw they were\ndealing with something that they feel it isn't important enough yet, to kill them, because we\nwere still going into work. I jumped my report to you, because that was still when we were\ngoing into, every day, to work. Now --",
        "Q: Was that at the first camp?",
        "A: It wasn't the first.",
        "Q: It was the one you came to with the boat and the train?",
        "A: Right, that was -- that was . No, it wasn't Latvia. That was . And we had -- now one\nday, I came back from work, and I was picked out to be hung. And myself, two more girls,\nand three guys. Because they thought I brought something into the camp, like food, or\nsomething. And they said, they are going to fool around with us anymore. You are going to\nbe killed. You are going to be killed by -- we are going to hang you, right here, and when all\nthe prisoners come in, they are going to see the example, what can happen to you, to any one\nof you, if you date brig anything into the camp, like a slice of bread, or a raw potato, or a raw\nbeet, that we found in the ground. So, it was another miracle. As it happened, my brother\nwalked by, and he saw. I was standing there. And he knew I was going to be killed. But, as\nluck wanted it, there was an SS man, from Latvia, who came to oversee how they can torture\nmore and take a lesson, the way Germany had their camp. That Latvian SS man knew who I\nwas, that I was in his camp in Latvia. And as he walked by, in the Latvian language I asked\nhim to save me, and somehow it worked. He saved me. The others were hung. And he saved\nme. He told the other SS men not to kill me. And it was like God sent somebody to take this\nperson, to live, which was another miracle. And we were in the death camp. And they were\ngoing to -- they were going to give us a well-known shower, which was -- we didn't know.\nThey told us they were going to give us a regular shower. We have not had showers or baths\nor anything, or toilet paper, or anything. So, they chased us into a room. We were totally\nnaked. They put up a table. It was like a fashion show table, like a runway. And we had to\nwalk naked on that table. And the SS men -- they sat on both sides, and they looked at our\nbodies, whether we were worthwhile saving, or being gassed. I had this horrible rash, that I\nknew I was going to be gassed, because the gas was for -- the rash was from malnutrition and\ndirt. Naturally, we were shaved, so therefore, we couldn't have anything in the hair. And I\nhid behind my girlfriend, and walked in step into step, so the front of my body wouldn't\nshow how bad it was. Then came the other miracle. I was young. And to the right was the\nshowers. To the left was to go -- we didn't know where it was going. But as they -- as we\nstood there, to put our clothes on again, we heard the screaming of the women, because we\ndidn't know what way they were being killed. We knew they were screaming because they\nwere being killed. And that was with the gas. It came out of shower heads. Later we saw,\nwhen the doors opened, there were ten shower heads, many of them over the ceiling. And\nturned on the gas, and by the time they opened the door, and I peeked 1n, we all peeked in, all\nof them were dead on the ground. That was a sight. That was just unbelievable. That was\nworse than the ovens, because once those women went in there, they didn't know what was\ngoing to hit them, until -- just screaming. They inhaled the gas. And I was saved again. I was\nalive, still. When we were shipped to that death camp, like I told you before, we did not\nknow when the end was going to come. But, we did not lose our hopes. Because we thought,\nwhy isn't President Roosevelt doing something for us? We thought that President Roosevelt\nwas our savior. We thought -- we heard that he was going to save us. Nobody saved us.\nThere was no way for anybody to be saved. And we knew we were going to die, which, at\nthat time, was actually a relief, because we were starved to death. We had no -- nobody, I\ndidn't know, except for the one brother. We didn't know if they would come out dead or\nalive. But every morning at ten o'clock, planes were coming down, very low. And always\ncircling around the concentration camp, which I later found out, that was the American\nArmy, taking pictures, exactly. They knew that was a concentration camp. And they were\ntrying to bomb the city, but to avoid bombing the concentration camps, which actually was\nthe case. They did not bomb the camp. One day they chased us out, and they said that we had\nto go and pick something up. I think they said it was for food, because we had assigned\nwomen who did the food -- picking up the food. And as we went to pick up the food, we saw\non the other side of the gate, that there were some, a pile full of rotten beans, laying there.\nThey absolutely devoured it. We grabbed it. We ate it. It was pink. It tasted like the most\nwonderful thing in the world, because we were -- we just couldn't exist any longer, from the\nhunger alone. It was -- we stayed there for a while, and then we heard that the war is towards\nthe end. How we got that information, we didn't know. I don't know how it happened. Now,\nthe SS women who knew me, they used to entertain the SS men. And there was no radio.\nThe city was totally bombed out. There were no lights, no radio. They did not have radios\nlike today, with batteries. So, I entertained the SS men. They wanted somebody to give them\nmusic. So, they used to get me out of my bunk. And they used to take me in, and put me\nbehind a curtain, or behind a piece of furniture. And I used to stand for them, and sing for\nthem, German songs, which was wonderful. I thought it was the greatest thing, because that\nwould give me more life, which it did. It actually did. It actually -- every, like I said -- every\ntime they counted for the others, they always put me aside. It was very good. It was\nwonderful. But they had no mercy. They knew that in the very end, that regardless of what\nhappens, that we are all going to go.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: I am going to go back and ask you some questions from the very beginning. You were very\nyoung, but do you remember specifically when the first fight -- when you first knew there\nwas fighting going on?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Tell me what it was like, or what you remember, specifically.",
        "A: I didn't remember it at first. What was devastating for my parents was that the Russians came\nin the year before the Germans, to Latvia. And they immediately took young, strong men,\nboys, and drafted them, and pushed them into the fighting in the woods, against the\nGermans. Because the Germans were already coming, towards Latvia. They used to Lativia,\nLithuania, Poland, for all the killings, because Hitler was under the impression that he was\ngoing to end the War. And when he wins the War he will say, \"I never killed any Jews. The\nPolacks did, the Latvians did, the Lithuanians did, all the other countries. I never killed\nanybody.\" That was the first thing that was so horrible for my parents, and my sisters, and\nmy other two brothers, to know that we may ever see them again. And we didn't.",
        "Q: Before the ghetto was formed, you were already taken to go to work; is that right?",
        "A: The first thing was, they took us from our homes, and they put us into a ghetto.",
        "Q: That was the first thing.",
        "A: That was the first thing.",
        "Q: Do you remember when that was, what year?",
        "A: The very beginning of the War. The War broke out in 1940. I was liberated in 1945. 1940,\n'41 or '40. I don't remember exactly, because when the Germans came in, they made the\nghetto right away. They chased us out of our homes. We had no belongings. And that is\nwhen I remember we all lived in one room.",
        "A: And in the ghetto, horrible things happened, or tell me -- did you know about those things\nyourself, or were you insulated from knowing, because you were so young, or what did you\nknow, and what did your parents know?",
        "A: We didn't know much. We didn't know what was going to happen to us. We were just\nhoping that a miracle was going to happen. We did not know that they were actually going to\nkill us. They are actually going to tear us all apart. My two brothers were already gone, with\nthe Russians, at the time. And we were in the ghetto. We did not know anything. All I know\nis, when we walked, we walked in the middle of the street, even in the ghetto. You were not\nallowed to walk on the sidewalks, because that was too smooth and too good for the Jews.\nSo we walked in the middle of the street which was many years ago, naturally. It was paved.\nIt was big rocks, uneven rocks, that were cemented to the ground. And one day I didn't see it,\nbut I heard that a German SS man named Mengele came into the ghetto to oversee the\nghetto. And if he didn't like what you looked like, he took out his gun, and killed everyone\nthat walked. So the walking of the ghetto, from our apartment to a friend, was really\neliminated, because we were afraid that they were going to kill us. So, we stayed 1n, all the\ntime. But, morally, I mean we felt, we're together, whatever happens. We prayed it would\nhappen to all of us, at the same time, at the same place. But we still didn't believe that it\nwould. We still didn't believe it.",
        "Q: You didn't believe that you would die.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And your parents --",
        "A: Did not, did not believe that. Why would we die? I mean there was a German Jew that came\nin 1939 to Latvia. He met my father and he said, \"Do you have any money?\" And my father\nsaid, \"For what?\" And he said, \"Do you have enough money for your family to go to Israel,\ngo to the United States, go anywhere you can, just run away from Latvia, because Hitler is\ngoing to come and he is going to kill you. I came from Germany to Latvia to escape him. But\nhe is going to come here too.\" And my father says, \"Don't be ridiculous.\" It was just like\nsomebody today would say to me that I live in this country, in the United States, take your\nfamily and run. Run to a country that is not going to kill you. Why would I do that, if I know\nthat that cannot happen? We didn't think that it was going to happen. We did not think that\nHitler was going to come to Latvia. Latvia was an independent country. Why would they\nwant us? But he did. And that is when it all happened. But there were very few Latvian Jews\nthat made it to Germany, to the camps. Like I told you, they eliminated them. They killed\nthem.",
        "Q: Specifically the Latvian Jews?",
        "A: Yeah, and also -- it's a matter of fact -- two of my brothers were married in the Latvian\nghetto. Both of their wives were expecting a baby. And both of their wives gave birth almost\nwithin a week apart. But when the Germans came into the ghetto, the first thing they did,\nthey went to the hospital. And what they did there, they made the grownups, the mothers that\ngave birth, the father was imprisoned, they threw the babies out the window, onto a pile on\nthe ground, and then they threw the mother who gave birth to the child, and whoever was\nthere, into that pile. And the ones that were still alive, they gave us to shovel them up, they\nwere dead, and threw them into -- like a big dug out grave. And my brother had to -- saw his\nwife and his baby in that pile. And he had to help bury them. And that was something that\nwas unbelievable. You cannot believe this. So, it makes personally I feel in my life, at this\nmoment, and all the way from my day of liberation, I cannot forget it. I still have nightmares.\nAnd I have had depression ever since. I live on medication, in order to be happy. And I am\nhappy. I am a happy person. But it is something that you cannot erase. You just cannot erase.\nLike I listen to the television, and I went to see Shindler's List, and Oprah Winfrey was on\ntelevision, and she said she saw Shindler's List. And she absolutely swears she has become a\ndifferent person, from what she saw. And that was only -- as authentic as he did the story, as\nbeautifully as it was directed and done, it was only about maybe ten percent as painful and\nthe real thing was. And he noted later in the magazine, and even in the newspaper that it took\nhim ten years to create this movie, so people would accept it, and want to go to it and see it,\nbut not be -- see the real, real horrors. Because you cannot show the real horrors. It is\nimpossible. It is unbelievable. Why would anybody do things, kill us? But to torture, the\ntorture that you go through, that repeats on you over. But I must say -- I will compliment\nmyself. I did not ever show it to my husband or show it to my children, what my inside was\nreally like, because I wanted my children to be happy, and they are. And I wanted my\nhusband to be happy, and he 1s. As far as I am concerned, I am happy. But I cannot wipe it\nout. And it's already 47, 48 years, I think, 50, right? You can't wipe it out. It is impossible.\nIt's not something you can just close the door and say, \"Well, so what?\" I never talk about it.\nI never talk about it. I don't like to talk about it. I don't need anybody's sympathy. And in the\nbeginning, when I told some Americans, a little bit of it, because they questioned me. \"Yes,\"\nthey said. \"The War was horrible. We also couldn't get any nylon stockings in this country.\"\nSo I figured I never talk about it. My friends know very little. And my children don't know\nthat much either. But my son got very interested in it. And when he heard that President\nCarter was going to make it possible to have a Museum, even before that, they were building\na committee who would help the Holocaust -- explain to the world the Holocaust. He wrote a\nletter and he -- they actually wrote back to him and said you filled every deed of your\nknowledge, but unfortunately we need more influential people. Which meant, they need\npeople with money, to build the Holocaust Museum, and to support it. then one day he got a\n-- on his machine, Mr. Steven Ludsin (ph.), this is the White House calling. We want you to\nappear at so and so time. We want to speak to you. Because they had already chosen all the\npeople. But he was the child of a survivor. And he got very, very, very interested in it. And I\nstill didn't tell him all. If they ever heard this interview there are a lot of things that would be\nvery strange to them. Because I do not -- I don't want them to have nightmares about it. I\nonly hope and pray -- I only hope and pray that the only reason I wanted to do this, was for\nmy grandchildren, of which I have three of them, by my daughter, and for their children, and\nfor their children's children. For the world to know, and people that say the Holocaust never\nexisted -- for these people.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a couple of other questions. The trip from the ghetto --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: The deportation from the ghetto --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: First by boat, and then by train --",
        "A: Tell me how long the trip was. And tell me about the deportation itself, what you remember,\nand what season was it?",
        "Q: It must have been fall, because it was raining. The trip on that big shipping boat, which must\nhave held at least 1,000 prisoners was a very long time. I can't remember whether it was a\nday and a night, or two days and one night. I can't. I really can't, because a lot of things I like\nto choke out. From that boat, when they put us in the train, I think we left the day before.\nAnd we arrived in a very rainy, late night. That is why the SS women wore those capes and\nthe hoods, because it was raining. And they were chasing us off that train, and bringing us to\nthat real big concentration camp, which was ; . It was . was in\nLatvia. And like I said before, when we arrived there, the outside was so immaculate, the\ngrass and the barracks. It looked like -- gee, maybe it is going to be better. But once we got\nin there, 1t was a nightmare.",
        "Q: In the ghetto, were you already starting to starve; tell me what the ghetto life was like. Were\nyou hungry all the time?",
        "A: The ghetto life was not too bad, because it was the very, very beginning, when the German's\ncame in. Now Latvia itself was a very beautiful city, very beautiful country. We had\nbeautiful vegetables. We had beautiful food. Everybody was employed. Everybody lived\nnicely. And when we were in the ghetto, we did not have much, because we were taken\naway our homes. And we had no clothes to change. Whatever we could grab in a little bag,\nthat's what was ours. And once we got into the ghetto, we didn't know what was happening.\nWe only said, please God, let us only be left together. We did not care what we left behind.\nMaterial things don't mean anything anymore. If you fight for life, and the ghetto life was not\n-- it horrible, but it wasn't -- because we didn't believe it was going to get any worse. We felt,\noh, this is going to be our punishment. And after that, the War will be over, and we will be\nsaved. And once we are saved, like -- we are young enough to build a life again. And my\nparents were too, because my mother, like I said, was 49, and my father was 50. They\nworked -- my father worked, he took care of the family.",
        "Q: About how long before -- were you in the ghetto before you were deported?",
        "A: I think the whole ghetto thing was very short, well, maybe six months. Because they needed\nthe ghetto to bring the other trains from the other countries, to eliminate the Jews from\nGermany. And they didn't want to do their killing in Germany. So, then we walked from the\nghetto to these concentrated places, to serve them jobs like I told you where we lived, all day\nlong there, they took a big apartment building and from the bottom to the very top, which\nwas the six or seven stories high, was --one was the place where they made the boots for the\nNazis. One was a place where they made fur jackets for the Nazis' girlfriends. One was a\nplace where they made dresses for the Nazis' wives and girlfriends. And on top was one\nwhere they were making shoes, ladies' shoes. And anyone who had a trade was lucky,\nbecause they were used. But luckily, like I told you, when you are young enough, and you\nhave a lot of guts, which I did, I told them I could sew. And I did. I did know how to sew,\nbecause when I was in school, they taught us how to sew, like they do here, too, I\nunderstand, in the United States. But you are under pressure, of the necessity. You are the\nbest -- it is the best teacher. You learn an awful lot, even things you don't know how to do,\nyou learn how to do it. You have to. And it was a big help. And then they couldn't keep us in\nLatvia anymore. We had to go to Germany, to the camps, which was not really Germany,\nbecause if 1t was or , , or . And there's Dachau. They were all on\nthe outskirts of Germany, because, like I said, when the War would have been over, and\nHitler would have won, he would have said he did not kill the Jews. So, that's what it's all\nabout. That's why when I went yesterday to the Museum, it was very, very emotional. But by\nthe same token, I was very, very thrilled to see young kids, because school is out.",
        "Q: When you were still in the ghetto, and there were actions --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That were outside the ghetto, did you hear those; did you know they were going on?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Tell me what you saw, or what you heard.",
        "A: What it was, it was actually -- they used to take a gaggle of people, in the middle of the\nstreet, and they just were shooting them, and making the ghetto more available for the next\nshipments. So, I saw it. And I heard it. What I didn't see, I heard about it. And if I listened, I\nheard the screams. So, you are always -- and you still didn't believe it. You still didn't think\n-- you were very fearful. You were very careful, not to expose yourself. But, how can you\nnot hear? How can you not see? If one was saved, if one person was -- they didn't shoot, and\nhe survived, he told it to us, what they did. And there was not people who were any different\nthan you and I. It was just that they happened to be picked out, taken in the middle of the\nstreet, and just shooting them. And that was their biggest pleasure. They did 1t with so much,\nwith so much -- they were actually happy about it. They were -- when I saw Sophie's choice,\nI realized how great the movie was made, because they did it with a lot of love, although\nthey tell you today that they were assigned to do the job, and they followed instructions.\nThey enjoyed it. They loved it. They Latvians loved it. And the Germans loved it. They did it\nwith a lot of pleasure. And they were not, as far as I'm concerned, I could not believe the\nGerman people could do such a thing, because they were very cultured people, very\nintelligent people, very clean people, to become such murderers. And the Hitler Youth, little\nboys, 13 years old, 14 years old, they were just as poisoned as a 40 year old. They took their\nguns and they were shooting. So, as long as you were Jewish -- they got any kind of a Jew,\neven if you were a quarter of a Jew, and eighth of a Jew, they killed you. It was something\nthat is indescribable. You can't really -- to this day, I can't believe it. It's unbelievable, that\npeople can do it.",
        "Q: When you were in the camps, later on, did you end up forming any close friendships with\nother prisoners, that are -- where you sort of were like sisters?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Tell me about some of those, or tell me about that.",
        "A: I had one girlfriend in particular. She was from -- she was from Germany. And luckily we\nwere always -- we became friends. Luckily we were always shipped to the same place at the\nsame time. And we were even choosing our -- in the barracks when we came in, we chose\nthe upper level of the bunks, because it had a little light there. And we also had no control\nover our bodies. We were so weak, that some of the elderly people, the elderly women used\nto urinate and it just came down onto us, so we made up, we were going up to the top. So\nnobody would do anything on top of us. But we befriended each other. And we still keep in\ntouch, and she did not know that I survived. And I did not know that she survived. And the\noverall, the woman all were very civil to each other. The only time we became animals was\nwhen our piece of bread was given to us. Then we became animals. But otherwise, we had\nactually -- did not approach each other by name, as much, because there were lots of them\nthat were from different countries. And you have to shift for yourself. Whatever you did, you\nhad to shift for yourself. But I made friends. I made friends. And I have some of them, to this\nday. That I speak to my girlfriend, who landed in Mexico City. And I speak to her. We keep\nin touch with each other. And we even arranged to go away together, on vacation, so we\nwould be without husbands, and be by ourselves. That was very important, to have\nsomebody left, who has been through the same as you did. Because that person is the most\ncompassionate person to you, and me to her.",
        "Q: And when you were there, was that friendship -- did that friendship help you get through,\nfrom one day to another?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. In a way, yes. We always hung on together for the coping, because they watched\nus constantly, as though we could go someplace. And they also -- the day we walked in the\nshowers, she was not as badly infected as I was, with the body rash, and she was walking\nstep into step, and covering my -- the front of my body, so the SS men would not put me in\nthe shower. For whatever, we knew it was for death. We knew it wasn't for anything but\ndeath. By her covering me, I think it saved me. So, we went to the left, she went to the left,\nand the others went to the right, which was to the gas chamber.",
        "Q: There was some sort of an incident when you were selected, and you escaped by hiding, by\ncrawling into a gutter.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Tell me about that.",
        "A: Well, that was very interesting. We had heard that the American Army -- they are at the\nborder. And we had all the time planes flying. They were flying. And if they were giving one\nor two it meant that everybody had to turn their lights off in that city, the people who lived\nthere, because they did not want to be killed by the bombs of the Americans, or whoever\ncame across. I personally feel that if the War would have lasted another 10 days, we all\nwould have been dead, because it was the end of the line, as far as the hunger, and the\nsickness. So, now we hear a five alarm. And with that five alarm the gates opened up, and\nthe SS women and the SS men ran away from the camp. So, we ran. But immediately after\nthat -- a little while after that, and the gates are open, and we went into the city. And that city\nwas very bombed out. And we knew that the Americans were not there yet. So we found a\nplace where it was flat to the ground, the building was bombed out, the apartment buildings\nwere bombed out. And we opened up a little opening there, a little rock or two rocks, and we\ncrawled into the basement of that bombed out building and we were about nine or twelve of\nus. Once we got in there, now there was a question. What are we going to do about eating, if\nit lasts another few days, before the Americans come in? The first thing I did -- we did, is as\nwe were crawling in there we saw about -- I don't know how many feet away it was, one\nbuilding -- a little building remained, and it was not bombed out. And it was a cleaning store.\nSo, my brothers broke the window down, and the other guys, and got the clothing from the\ncleaning store, and we eliminated our striped clothes, and put on the clothes that didn't fit.\nBut it did not matter. And we waited. And while we were in that basement, we had heard\nthat the Americans were already in that city, so we took up the guys to walk out, and walk in\nthe street. And as we walked in the street, American soldiers came to us. And they saw that\nwe were shaved, and the men wore -- they called it , which was skinny bodies, skinny\narms, and fat legs from hunger. And one was a German Jew, who was an officer 1n the\nAmerican Army, and he said to us, what language do you speak, in German? Naturally, we\nall jumped on him, because we all spoke German. And he immediately organized for the\nsoldiers to go back to their place, where they were staying. And within half and hour or so,\nthey brought us all their rations, of their food, a toothbrush, I asked for. I hadn't brushed my\nteeth for years. And he brought us a bar of chocolate, to us was -- it was unbelievable. I mean\nhe did not eat -- now I know it was a big Hershey bar. And you know how it is cut? We ate\nlittle crumbs of it, so it would last longer. And -- before we walked out, the German found\nout that there were Jews hiding in that basement. Now we hear them. And how can we hide\nfrom them? So, it was like a little cubby, with steps originally going up, and underneath 1s\nalways a little cubby. And we all crawled into that cubby. And we did not breathe. So the\ndid not hear us. And they said in German, \"We knew there are Jews here, but where\nare they?\" And they walked out, luckily. And when we walked out, we met the American\nsoldiers. Now, the rest of our group found out that the camp is empty, but there is some food,\nsome food. So they went back there to get the food. And they were caught, because the Nazis\ncame back. It was not quite over. And I told my brothers, we are not going back. We are\nstaying right here. And we did. And I think in the last minute they killed a few people who\nwe were with, because they thought the war was still not over. That particular city was not\nliberated for them, yet. So, we decided to stay there, and we'll wait. And we'll be walked out.\nAnd then one -- I don't know where I got my brains, but I decided that we cannot eat a lot,\nbecause that would kill us. It killed quite a few of my friends, that I was with, because we\nwere so undernourished, our stomach was so -- could not conceive or accept that much food.\nAnd I did it for my brothers, as well. And thank God that he did it, because a lot of them\noverate. They ate too much. There was nothing much to be had, but people ate potatoes,\nwhich was like cake. And from then on in, they stayed there, when we were liberated and we\ntried to find the place where to live. And start to work for papers, to go someplace. Because\nwe didn't want to remain in Germany. The memories were horrible. The streets were bloody.\nThere was no need to stay there. So, we arranged it.",
        "Q: Do you -- did you know of any incidents with Partisens; did you ever hear any rumors of --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: What about an underground in the camps; was there ever any talk about trying to make --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: In Poland they did a Resistance. But they did not succeed. You cannot resist, when you are\nnaked. Do you know what I mean? It's like taking a person, and undressing the person and\nsaying, \"Fight for your life.\" With what? There was nothing, never. We never had anything.",
        "Q: In the camps, do you think it was easier for women, than men?",
        "A: That's a good question. No. It was only easier if you were young enough. Because they\neliminated anything under 13, and over 30 were killed. Okay? I shall also never forget, in\nLatvia, at the Latvian concentration camp, a few of the mothers had their children. They\nwere like ten years old, nine years old, five years old. And then they came one day and said,\n\"We are going to take your children. We are going to take them to a beautiful place where\nthey are going to be given more things than you have. So we are going to put them on a\ntruck. And we are going to ship them over to that place.\" And the mothers, and we all knew\nit was for death. Now, these mothers -- I had a friend that I knew through the camps, she had\na child. They actually hung onto those trucks -- it was an open truck. They piled them up,\nstanding up. They were hanging on, to whatever they could hang on. And they were dragged\nalong, until they had no more strength, and their arms couldn't hold them up, and they fell on\nthe ground, because they knew their children were going to death. And these children were\ncrying, screaming for their parents, crying for their mothers. \"Mama, mama, please, save\nme.\" You know, it was -- it was -- 1t was just horrible. And they were eliminated. And they\neliminated. They kept on eliminating, over 30 of them. They had one young boy who went\nthrough the whole thing with us, and we all saved him. When they counted us, we shoved\nhim -- he was little, we shoved him between us, we covered him with our upper parts of our\njackets. And then, when we had to go anywhere, the mother of this child somehow or other,\nshe sewed up -- you know our bunks -- we had a straw covered with burlap. That was our\nmattress. And we helped her take that burlap and sew it up, and she covered him, and\npretended it was like sugar, or flour, or whatever. And it was her child. He was the only child\nthat we saved. He is still alive.",
        "Q: How long was he hidden there, with you?",
        "A: He was hidden with us. He was like a big, big thing. Because they escaped taking him, plain\nas day. When they took the children away, somehow or other, they didn't get him. When all\nthese kids were shipped away, and they were all killed, and he was the only child, we found\nlater on, was living. And we weren't going to let him die. So, we all fought for his life, and he\nsurvived.",
        "Q: Did you hide him during the day, when you guys went off to work; or was this when you\nweren't going to work?",
        "A: We were going to work. We were hiding him. Somehow or other, he was hiding under the\nlast -- the -- in the bunk, you know. So we were hiding him there, and wherever -- wherever\nwe could. There's a lot to say about people who go through horrors, how your mind works,\nhow you really can do -- like the day when they were sending all -- there was another\nincident when they were sending everybody somewhere. And they were counting\neverybody. And there was a drain, where the water runs down? And I left myself -- I put\nmyself into that. I lifted that. I don't even know how I was able to lift up that iron drain. And\nI put myself, my body, into it. And I held on to the -- to those tron things, and I saved myself.\nBecause, your mind is -- it's the animal instinct, I think. If you want to live, that you can use\nso much imagination, to really save yourself. There are so many things -- I mean there were\nso many things happening. There was a man -- the oldest one in the camp, of the men's\ncamp. And he was -- also he played, he was a musician. I think he was a cellist, too. And\nthey beat the hell out of him, the Jewish guy, the one that wore the thing on his arm. He\ncouldn't get off his bunk, to go to be counted, because he was so sick. He was only 50 years\nold, and he was the oldest. So, he Absolutely -- they beat him, with that black police stick.\nAnd he crawled out to be counted, because 1f you wouldn't -- because if the number would\nbe off, then we would be killed, at least 10 of us, for one person. How -- you couldn't escape,\nbut they would say, where is he? You know. So, the men dragged him out. We weren't\ncounted together. The men's camp were counted. To say it was easier for a woman than for a\nman, I don't think so. I don't really know. I think it was equally as hard, because -- very, very\n-- it is actually up to the individual. In the first place, where we were working in Latvia,\nbefore the camps were made, there was a friend of mine. He was my age. And he turned out\n-- he is still alive. He is a violinist. He plays every instrument. And he was little enough, and\nI was little enough and they used to give us great food there. It was farina. And farina was\ncooked for 250 people, in one big kettle. It was about seven feet tall. So in order to clean\nthat, you have to get inside. So, my main friend, at that time we were not being together, but\nwe still had a little contact in this place where we worked. So, he used to clean the inside of\nthe pot, and I used to clean the outside of the pot, okay? And it was in the kitchen. And we\nhad an , what they called . He was the main -- the manager of the entire thing, the SS\nman. He was more than an ordinary SS man. He had a higher rank. He was the main man.\nAnd all of a sudden, we hear screams. And he brings 1n this guy, puts him in the middle of\nthe kitchen, and shoots him, kills him. That was so strange to us, because that was the first\nplace that we were working at, and going back to the ghetto. And we couldn't ask him, why\ndid you kill him? He felt like it. He found him and he wasn't working at that moment, so he\ntook him to the kitchen and he killed him. And that was for no reason at all. And he was\nnice. He was a nice SS man. He wasn't so bad, because he had -- and you want to hear the\nbest? When the War was over, he said, when the Americans liberated us, he said he was\nJewish. And you know what? He lived for a while. He lived. And when they asked him how\ncould you be Jewish? He didn't look like a German, he had dark hair. He put on the striped\nclothes, and he said, \"I'm Jewish.\" He says. So the American says, \"What was going on in\nthe camps?\" So, naturally he could describe everything that was going on, because he was\npart of it. And the American Army was lenient. We knocked our brains to find the Nazis,\nafter we were liberated, and when the fellows brought them -- they found them and brought\nthem to the American Embassy, and expected for them to be killed, they wouldn't kill them.\nThe Americans didn't kill them. Because now I know why. They have to have enough proof,\nto know whether or not he was really a capo or an SS man. So, that's -- there are so many\nepisodes, that we would -- if we sat now, for another eight hours, I could tell you, but I do try\nto choke it out. I try very hard. And I hope I will be able, but as I get older, I find it more\ndifficult, to be very honest. And the biggest pleasure, for me, is to speak to you right now,\nand to be able to come to Washington, and to see the Holocaust Memorial. Because that is\nabsolutely the greatest thing I have seen. The man who designed it, the architect, the people\nwho had the pictures, who saved it, who found it, or what they did, is unbelievable. The\nshoes, the original things that are in that museum. I am so angry at myself, that to save\nmyself, that I took off my striped clothes, and I threw it away. And I put something on, so I\nwouldn't be recognized as a prisoner. And I put the kerchief on my head. I am sorry I don't\nhave that jacket. But my brother saved it. And he gave it to the museum in Florida. That is\nwhere he lives. And he has his number on it. And it is his jacket. And it 1s written in that\nmuseum, that that belonged to the prisoner so and so, and so and so. I think that 1s very\ngratifying. I think that is -- that trip that I just took will definitely be very well remembered.\nBut I hope that for many, many years that everybody should know about it. That 1s my input,\nto do that. Because I am not -- I am hurting myself. But I am not that selfish. Somebody said\nto me, \"Did you go to see Shindler's List?\" I said, \"Of course. Why not?\" \"How could you do\nthat? How can you go and see it?\" I said, \"Did you?\" She says, \"Not yet, because I don't like\nto see sad things.\" I said, \"How can you be so selfish. It isn't that sad, to begin with. And how\ncan you ignore something of history? The world should know and you don't want to see it?\"\nAnd they went. And they all went.",
        "Q: Sonja, tell me about some of the songs that you sang.",
        "A: We had several songs that - first of all, these songs were made up by some talented that we\nwere with, at the camps. So, the one in particular that I remember, and I often sing it, 1s\n, which means do not say, ever, that you walked the last walk, which gave us courage,\ngave us hopes. And singing together many times, as bad as things were, we were happy. We\nwere happy to be able to make each other happy, by singing. And those songs were very\ngood for us, because we went, like I told you to the UJA meetings, that they had people who,\nfor an evening, for dinner, and then our songs. After we were finished singing those songs,\nthey were very willing to give money to the United Jewish Appeal, because they knew and\nthey saw the proof, what was -- how it happened, how we came to this country, since they\npaid for us.",
        "Q: When you were in the camps, did both you and your brother sing, did your brothers also\nsing?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you sing together?",
        "A: No. We were never together, never. We were only together by liberation.",
        "Q: When you sang behind the curtain, for the Germans --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What kind of songs did you sing then?",
        "A: I sang modern German songs, cheerful songs that they wanted to hear. And that was part of\ntheir pleasure. What was going on behind the curtain from -- I mean that was hiding me, I\nnever looked, because I wasn't interested. I wasn't supposed to. And I never did. But I know\nthat is the way they entertained the SS men. And I want you to know one more thing, how\nsick these women were, these SS women were. That when we were running out to run away,\nwe had to pass their quarters, where they were situated. And quickly, very quickly we ran\nthrough it. There were some photographs and we grabbed it and we ran with it. And they\nalways had dogs. They always -- every SS man had a dog. Every SS woman had a dog.\nWhen they walked through the camps, into the barracks, they always had a dog, because -- I\ndon't know why. They did. Then we saw pictures that they actually photographed their\nsexual satisfaction with a dog. That is how sick they were, which was not too clear to me.\nBut later on 1t was explained to me. And I also remember one more thing. My husband and I\nwent to Europe. And we went to visit friends, relatives, and so forth. And our trip was\nscheduled with a stop in . But somehow or other we had to land in , either to\nrefuel or I don't know what. But they didn't want to keep us on the plane. And they wanted\nus to get off the plane, and then come back. And then they will fly us where were supposed\nto fly. And I looked out of the little window of the plane and I saw a black raincoat, belted,\nblack, long, with a big German Shephard. And it was a policeman, a German policeman.\nAnd I actually lost my -- I felt like I was going through an emotional horror, because they\nlooked exactly, exactly like the Nazis did, during the War. And I said to my husband, \"I am\nnot getting off.\" And he said, \"Why not?\" And I said, \"I am afraid.\" He said, \"What are you\nafraid of?\" I said, \"Take a look at them. They look the same, just like the murderers.\" And\nthey did. So, the fact remains that it is not easy to go through life, to have experienced what\nwe experienced. And I am grateful, for myself, as well as for all the other survivors, that\nsome of us survived to tell the story. To me, this is the biggest, the best thing that could have\nhappened.",
        "Q: We have just a couple of minutes. Now, did you also sing in the barracks, you and the other\nprisoners?",
        "A: Yes. That is what happened. That's how the SS woman knew that I did, because I sang, we\nsang together, we sang apart. We taught each other songs. We put songs together. We had to\ndo that. We did it and that is how the SS woman knew that I could sing. She had no other\nknowledge. And that is when she started to send for me, to come to that place where she was\nliving, that part of the camp, to entertain her gentlemen, the SS men. They were sick. They\nwere very sick. But unfortunately I heard that some of the SS women pulled the same thing.\nThey said that they were Jews. And they came to the United States. Because they know\neverything that went on, in the camps. And they had no -- there was no proof. How can you\nprove you are not? I mean a German girl -- the SS women looked like we did. They were\ndark. They were light. They were blonde. There was no stamp on them, I am German. And\nyou are Jewish. They looked the same. As far as I'm concerned. And as far as anyone 1s\nconcemed. They look the same. That is why I can never tell apart, to this day, whether this\nperson is Jewish or not Jewish. It really doesn't matter to me. It has no meaning to me. I have\nvery, very good friends who are not Jewish, and I cherish them, and I respect them, and I\nlove them. So, during the War, before the War broke out, we had very dear friends who were\nnot Jewish. And they used to see us walking in the middle of the street, like horses. And they\ncouldn't even look at us. They were afraid to look at us. They didn't want to let on that they\nknew us, because it could have been hard too, you know. Knowing a Jew was a criminal\nthing.",

        "A: My name 1s Sonja Gottlieb Ludsin and I was born in Riga, Latvia in 1923, the twentieth of\nOctober, 1923. I lived in Latvia, with my family. And the War broke out.",
        "A: Okay. There were six children, four brothers, two sisters, my father and my mother. The\nRussians came in the year before the Germans. They took two of my brothers to fight against\nthe Germans. We did not know what happened to them. And then Germany came into\nLatvia. They separated our family by taking the young ones and putting them to work in big\napartment buildings, that they made in factories, for the SS men. Whoever was able to make\nshoes, worked so, or make clothes for them, of any kind. We used to work from the home, at\nfirst. And then they put us in a ghetto. In Latvia itself, they had two ghettos. One was\n, and one was . Not , -- . L landed in . Then they\ntransferred me to . And it was -- I did not know where the rest of my family was.",
        "A: We were a very, very happy family. Because each one of us did something of musical (sic.).\nMy sister was an opera singer at the age of 17. She was the first Jewish girl accepted to the\nLatvian Opera. It was just the most thrilling, the most wonderful thing anybody -- parents\ncan imagine. My brother sang. I sang. We all played the piano. One played the guitar. One\nplayed another guitar, or like a -- what do you call it? I can't think of the word, the\ninstrument at the moment. But we were a very, very happy family. There was never just us\nalone in the house. There was always a friend of mine, or a friend of my brother, or maybe\nboth. And we all ate together. And we all had a very beautiful life. These are my memories\nof my family. My parents were young. At this stage, I realize just how young they were.\nBecause my mother was only 49 years old and she was killed by the Germans. And my\nfather was 50. I didn't know what happened to them. I was 14 years old. So, when I was\nconcentrated in the Latvia ghetto, they still -- my hopes were still that I was going to see my\nfamily. I was sure that my family is going to be saved, like I thought I was, not knowing\nwhat was happening to them. Now, my two older brothers, they were chosen to go in the\nwoods, to fight against the Germans, because they were already with the Russian army.\nBecause Russia came in a year before Germany. And then we were only left a few. But I\nthought they were alive. In that Latvian concentration camp we had a lot of Christian\nprisoners. What they did, to be prisoners, I did not know. But they were above us. They were\nlike capos, they called them. And they were very cruel. But we still walked from the ghetto\nto these different places, to be useful. I told them I could sew, which I learned -- I taught\nmyself. And I sitting on sewing on machine, part of the German, the Nazis' clothing. And we\nactually only lived on hopes.",
        "A: Yes. The ghetto was -- the ghetto was formed -- it was separated. You see, everybody that\nthey shipped from Germany they shipped to the Latvian ghetto. Families came from\nGermany, from Poland, from different places. They were separated from us. They split the\nghetto. And there was a small ghetto, because Latvia was not a big city. They took the very\nworst neighborhood, like, and they made it into a ghetto by wiring around it. Now, we were\nhappy as long as we were together. But, we lived now in two rooms, three families. At that\ntime, we were four children and my mother and father. Then when we went to work, in that\nplace, for the SS men, one day I heard that when we go back, there is going to be massive\nkilling of all the ghetto people. Because they were bringing in more and more trains from\nother countries. So, naturally, we wanted to be with our loved ones, but we also wanted to\nsave ourselves. Now, by the end of the day, get picked out the oldest people, the weakest\npeople. My youth helped me. And I knew somebody who was like a foreman. He was\nJewish, too. But he was the one who relayed the messages from the SS men to us. They\ndidn't speak to us. He spoke to us. And he was influential enough to put me aside, with\nanother few people. And not turn me back to the ghetto. Because that meant death. Now, the\nemotion that I had, to go back to the ghetto, was very, very hard. At this point I couldn't\nmake up my mind. And it wasn't a question of my mind. He saved me. He was alive until\nrecently. I saw him, and I thanked him, again, and again, and again. So we knew that that\nghetto was liquidated. And new people were brought in, from other countries. What they did,\nthey left us in that place and I worked there. And I lived there. But we were very few lucky\nones.",
        "A: Now, what happened was, I was still the same age, because it didn't take that long in Latvia.\nMaybe I had reached the age of 15, at the time. They heard that all the people who were in\nthe ghetto, the Latvian Jews and whoever lived in that ghetto were brought to a mass -- in the\nwoods. And they had big, tremendous grave dug out, where they shot them, threw them into\nthe grave, with shovels. And some of them were not killed by the bullet, were still alive. And\nthey were thrown into that same grave. And then they put the dirt over them. And even the\nones that were alive was killed. And I found out -- I found that out afterwards. There was\nrailroad man, the man that used to control the railroad closing and opening -- he witnessed\nthis thing. And he said -- he was not Jewish, he just lived there. And he said, \"I will never,\never be able to shut out the scenes and the horrors that the people that were trying to save\nthemselves, and couldn't. I cannot sleep. I cannot get it out of my mind. It is very difficult for\nme, which is very much -- to understand how it really affected a man who was totally\nremoved from it. After that, when they killed everybody in that massive grave, they\nliquidated the place where I was working. And they said they were going to send us to\nGermany, to a beautiful place. We were very few.",
        "A: His name was Aaronson (ph.). He was actually, in normal times, he was a cellist, a very\nwell-known cellist. And he was in charge, like I said, to relay the messages, between the SS\nmen and us. And his name was , which was his stage name. But it was\nAaronson. I didn't know whether he was alive or not, afterwards. But I just -- I was in touch\nwith him, not too long ago. He lived in Texas. I spoke to him over the phone, and I thanked\nhim. And I told him I will never forget him, as long as I live. And I didn't, because he saved\nmy life.",
        "A: My two brothers that were sent in the woods when the Germans fought the Russians, I don't\nknow what -- I didn't know what happened to them. My other two brothers, on the other\nhand, I didn't know what happened to them. And my sisters, and my parents, I didn't know\nwhat happened to them. So, there I was, maybe 14 and a half, 15 years old, and I had no idea\nof where my family was. They -- when they told us they were going to ship us to Germany,\nthey piled us up in a big, huge fishing boat, which was totally empty inside. It had -- we were\nhundreds of us, from both the ghettos. And they put us in a standing position. There was no\nroom to sit down. There were no toilets. There was no food. And they shipped us to\nGermany. When we arrived there, in order to get where we had to go, they got us out of the\nboat, the ship, whatever you call it, and they put us in the trains, where they ship animals.\nThose trains -- what a horror. I can smell it now. And I remember so vividly, that it follows\nme. I just saw the Holocaust Museum and I saw that train. And I felt such emotions, that I\ncouldn't even cry, because when you live anything 1n life, like that, for five years, you cannot\ncry at sadness. I cry at gladness, because if I go to a birthday party, or any surprise party, it\ntouches me and I cry. When it comes to sadness, I don't whether it made me the more -- not\nstronger, but maybe I have more control over myself. Now, we arrived with the trains, at\nnight, in the rain, and these SS women wore capes with hoods. And we looked out of the\ntrain, and we saw the capes with hoods. And these women -- because we did not have SS\nwomen in Latvia. They only came into the picture in Germany. We looked out, and we saw\nthe camps. Then there was beautiful green grass and barracks. So we thought maybe we will\nfind our loved ones there. Maybe they were shipped on a different shipment. But it wasn't.\nThey weren't there. And they chased us into those barracks. And the barracks were the most\nhorrible thing. The -- what do you call it? The bunks were not as wide and the one that is at\nthe Museum. They were narrower. At the other camp, later on, they were as wide as the one\nat the Museum. And we had to sit, four of us, in one -- in one -- what 1s it called again?",
        "A: Bunk. It was three levels. The lights were dim, and we had one girl from Poland who was\npregnant, because she came into the picture later on. And she was pregnant, and the SS\nwomen knew that she was pregnant. And she gave birth. And we all listened. And we heard\nhow she cried, and how the baby was delivered. And she delivered it herself. And one of the\nSS women actually helped her. Then they made a little partition, and they put that baby\nwhere we could hear it. It was a little girl. And they allowed her to breast feed the baby. And\nthen, when the baby was two weeks old, they told her, she can't breast feed the baby\nanymore. She had to let the baby die. And we all died with it. I mean, that was so horrible.\nWe listened, the baby was crying, and crying, and crying. And no food was given to her, and\nshe died. And we had to comfort the mother. We were a lot of women in that bunk. But were\nall like one, all like one. Now comes the picture, where I -- we were starved. We were\nunder-nourished, with rashes on our bodies. We were shaved. I had a rash that covered my\nentire body. And I was in agony. But you can take a lot of pain, when you are young. Now,\nthe SS women were very cruel. They were crueler than the SS men. We had no toilets. We\nhad -- we did not have a period, because they gave us something in the so-called soup. It was\ngiven to us once a day. Even the circumstances that we lived in, we had no periods. So that\neliminated about how can we protect ourselves, if we don't have a period? And they dug a\nlong narrow strip outside, with a board across. That was our toilet, outside. And there were\ndays when it was like 30 below zero. We had to go and pull our clothing off. It freezing, just\nfreezing. But things were so sad that -- we were young, and we sat in those bunks, and I\nsang. I sang all kinds of songs. And then this SS woman came in, and she says -- she took the\nblack -- I don't know what you call it, but the policemen wear it. The black stick, the black --",
        "A: Yeah, and she beat. And she said, \"You have it so good that you sing?\" Because you never\nanswered an SS woman. Then she remembered that I sang. And every time they took us out\nto be counted, which was four in the morning, twelve at night, any time they desired. And it\nwas beastly cold, in the winter. They counted us. They chased us in, back to the barracks.\nAnd anything that we could get to be busy with -- I personally always lifted my arm, no\nmatter what they asked. Can you sew? Yes. Can you clean? Yes. Can you go there? Yes.\nCan you go pick up the soup for the barracks? Yes. I always went. Then you be better. Then\nyou be better than any other prisoner. Maybe there were three or four more. And then they\nmade the Jewish men into capos. They called them capos. And they put a band around their\narms. And they had to hit us, chase us, hit us, get us out of the barracks as fast as possible, to\nbe counted. That was their pleasure. The Jewish boy that was concentrated there, like Hitler\nsaid, \"We don't have to kill the Jews. The Jews will kill each other.\" And in circumstances\nlike that, that is exactly what was happening. Those few guys who were the capos, they took\na bigger piece of bread. They took another dish of soup, which deprived us of having us\nwhat we were entitled to, because we were so starved. We were swollen from hunger. My\nlegs were twice, three times the size. And one day, there was a men's camp further out. And\nin order for them to get their rations of food, which was a big kettle, like, where the soup was\nin, they had to go to the women's camp to reach the kitchen. And somebody hollered out to\nme, \"Sonya, I just saw one of your brothers.\" And I ran out and I screamed at him, and it was,\none of my brothers, in the same place. It was the most unbelievable happening. And there\nwas this one SS woman, she was over six feet tall. And she was the meanest, meanest, most\nhorrible human being anybody can imagine -- even Napoleon. She took me and she said\nagain, you have it too good. You just made contact with the men. And I said to her, \"This\nwas my brother.\" And it didn't matter. They never hit us in the middle of the room. They\nalways put us against the wall. And then she slammed my face. She knocked my teeth out.\nAnd also you got like a back knock, at the wall. That was the purpose of the wall. So you get\na double pain. And she beat me until I just fell down and I just couldn't take it. I just laid\nthere. And it didn't bother her. And she just walked away. And she says, \" Now you're going\nto know you will never, ever make any motions to anybody.\" And we stayed there. And that\nactually was not a death camp. That actually was a camp that they took us out and brought us\nto an ammunition factory, where we used to -- it was a huge place. They made the bombs for\n-- the large bombs. And we were making them. I was upstairs with the women. And\ndownstairs were the men. And there again, I knew, my God, I was downstairs. And I was\nlucky enough -- and that is why I feel that my life had many miracles. I was lucky enough\nthat they asked, in that factory, \"Who can speak German fluently?\" And I said, \"I can.\" And\nI was the interpreter between him and the Jewish girls that came from Poland. The\nHungarian girls came in later on in the War, because Hungary was not jet included. And I\nrelayed the message, what they had to do next, whether he had complaints about anybody.\nWe were so undernourished, we didn't have the strength. We couldn't work on those\nmachines. They were big, huge machines. So, they put a white band on my arm, and they\nalways used me as an interpreter, between the Polish girls who did not speak German,\nbetween the Hungarian girls who did not speak German, between all the other ones who did\nnot speak German. And he was actually nice to me. And he threw slices of bread under the\nmachine, as he passed by, because he had to be careful. Once I got those extra few slices of\nbread, I was able to give my brother the bread that I got, legally. But how do I get to my\nbrother? I cannot go downstairs. So, this SS man, when he spoke to me, and he gave me the\norders, and he told me what to do, and who to tell what they have to do, he spoke to me very\nnicely. And I said to him, \"You know what you did was wonderful. And being as you are so\nwonderful, can you help me to get my slice of bread to my brother?\" And he says, \"Yes, I\nwill. \"He made me take a bomb. He put it in my arms, and says follow me. And he got me\ndown to the lower level, where my brother was working. And that was called the ;\nwhich meant that when the bomb was made upstairs, they had to use very hot ovens, to\nfinish it off. I don't know the technical way, how they finished it off, but it was like 120\ndegrees in there. And my brother was there, undernourished, just as swollen as I was. And he\nstood there, and he watched, the other SS men wouldn't see him. And I threw that bread\nunder that machine. And my brother got the bread. And I did it as often as I could. But that\nwas still while we were working. Now, we were shipped to another camp.",
        "A: We didn't know, at that time. But we landed in and they were putting numbers on the\nprisoners. And they just sent us to there, through another camp, which was called ;\nAnd that was a death camp. There was no work. There was no nothing. There was just --\nevery day was elimination. They counted us. One, two, three, out. One, two, out. One, four,\nout, which meant they were going to be burned in the ovens. So, knowing that at any time\nthey were about to pick me, they knew me, the SS women. And they said to each other,\n\" , which means later. They are not going to take you now. But they didn't say it in\nthat many words. So I was happy. I figured this was wonderful. How long is this going to\nlast? Because we were getting less, and less every day. They were eliminating, they were\nkilling. They were awaiting for new shipments. And also in this shipments (sic.) came with\nthe trains. They were all told they could take their personal belongings. Everybody thought\nthey were going live, so their personal belongings consisted of shoes, and a little clothing,\nand maybe even a little bit of jewelry, thinking that they were going to buy themselves out of\nthe hardest. Now, we had to go to those trains, and we had to -- they had to throw out their\nbelongings, their valise. And we had to open them, and sort them out, where the Nazis\nhelped themselves to it. And it was just people who were coming -- coming to be killed. But\nthey didn't know that. So, that was the second most horrible thing in my life, or the third. I\nalso was very happy that I was with the Polish girls, the Jewish Polish girls. They had a lot of\nvigor. They were never afraid. Before that death camp, when we were sent out to work, they\nmade contact, somehow. And they used to bring in, either between their legs, or someplace,\na piece of bread. And they got -- they heard of it, the SS men, and they stopped the entire --\nall of us, coming in from work, to the camp, and they looked all over and they said, \"You\nwill tell us who is bringing in what. And if you don't, we're going to put you outside, and we\nare going to pour water over you. You are going to be on your knees. And you will freeze to\nthe ground.\" Which we did. We all went out, the way they chased us out. He had us on our\nknees. It was late at night. It was bitter cold. It was way below zero. And they poured pails of\nwater over our bodies. And we froze to the ground. We could not lift our legs up. But none\nof us told them who brought that piece of bread in. None of us. And they saw, the following\nmorning, they got us up, somehow, and they left us alone. Because they saw they were\ndealing with something that they feel it isn't important enough yet, to kill them, because we\nwere still going into work. I jumped my report to you, because that was still when we were\ngoing into, every day, to work. Now --",
        "A: It wasn't the first.",
        "A: Right, that was -- that was . No, it wasn't Latvia. That was . And we had -- now one\nday, I came back from work, and I was picked out to be hung. And myself, two more girls,\nand three guys. Because they thought I brought something into the camp, like food, or\nsomething. And they said, they are going to fool around with us anymore. You are going to\nbe killed. You are going to be killed by -- we are going to hang you, right here, and when all\nthe prisoners come in, they are going to see the example, what can happen to you, to any one\nof you, if you date brig anything into the camp, like a slice of bread, or a raw potato, or a raw\nbeet, that we found in the ground. So, it was another miracle. As it happened, my brother\nwalked by, and he saw. I was standing there. And he knew I was going to be killed. But, as\nluck wanted it, there was an SS man, from Latvia, who came to oversee how they can torture\nmore and take a lesson, the way Germany had their camp. That Latvian SS man knew who I\nwas, that I was in his camp in Latvia. And as he walked by, in the Latvian language I asked\nhim to save me, and somehow it worked. He saved me. The others were hung. And he saved\nme. He told the other SS men not to kill me. And it was like God sent somebody to take this\nperson, to live, which was another miracle. And we were in the death camp. And they were\ngoing to -- they were going to give us a well-known shower, which was -- we didn't know.\nThey told us they were going to give us a regular shower. We have not had showers or baths\nor anything, or toilet paper, or anything. So, they chased us into a room. We were totally\nnaked. They put up a table. It was like a fashion show table, like a runway. And we had to\nwalk naked on that table. And the SS men -- they sat on both sides, and they looked at our\nbodies, whether we were worthwhile saving, or being gassed. I had this horrible rash, that I\nknew I was going to be gassed, because the gas was for -- the rash was from malnutrition and\ndirt. Naturally, we were shaved, so therefore, we couldn't have anything in the hair. And I\nhid behind my girlfriend, and walked in step into step, so the front of my body wouldn't\nshow how bad it was. Then came the other miracle. I was young. And to the right was the\nshowers. To the left was to go -- we didn't know where it was going. But as they -- as we\nstood there, to put our clothes on again, we heard the screaming of the women, because we\ndidn't know what way they were being killed. We knew they were screaming because they\nwere being killed. And that was with the gas. It came out of shower heads. Later we saw,\nwhen the doors opened, there were ten shower heads, many of them over the ceiling. And\nturned on the gas, and by the time they opened the door, and I peeked 1n, we all peeked in, all\nof them were dead on the ground. That was a sight. That was just unbelievable. That was\nworse than the ovens, because once those women went in there, they didn't know what was\ngoing to hit them, until -- just screaming. They inhaled the gas. And I was saved again. I was\nalive, still. When we were shipped to that death camp, like I told you before, we did not\nknow when the end was going to come. But, we did not lose our hopes. Because we thought,\nwhy isn't President Roosevelt doing something for us? We thought that President Roosevelt\nwas our savior. We thought -- we heard that he was going to save us. Nobody saved us.\nThere was no way for anybody to be saved. And we knew we were going to die, which, at\nthat time, was actually a relief, because we were starved to death. We had no -- nobody, I\ndidn't know, except for the one brother. We didn't know if they would come out dead or\nalive. But every morning at ten o'clock, planes were coming down, very low. And always\ncircling around the concentration camp, which I later found out, that was the American\nArmy, taking pictures, exactly. They knew that was a concentration camp. And they were\ntrying to bomb the city, but to avoid bombing the concentration camps, which actually was\nthe case. They did not bomb the camp. One day they chased us out, and they said that we had\nto go and pick something up. I think they said it was for food, because we had assigned\nwomen who did the food -- picking up the food. And as we went to pick up the food, we saw\non the other side of the gate, that there were some, a pile full of rotten beans, laying there.\nThey absolutely devoured it. We grabbed it. We ate it. It was pink. It tasted like the most\nwonderful thing in the world, because we were -- we just couldn't exist any longer, from the\nhunger alone. It was -- we stayed there for a while, and then we heard that the war is towards\nthe end. How we got that information, we didn't know. I don't know how it happened. Now,\nthe SS women who knew me, they used to entertain the SS men. And there was no radio.\nThe city was totally bombed out. There were no lights, no radio. They did not have radios\nlike today, with batteries. So, I entertained the SS men. They wanted somebody to give them\nmusic. So, they used to get me out of my bunk. And they used to take me in, and put me\nbehind a curtain, or behind a piece of furniture. And I used to stand for them, and sing for\nthem, German songs, which was wonderful. I thought it was the greatest thing, because that\nwould give me more life, which it did. It actually did. It actually -- every, like I said -- every\ntime they counted for the others, they always put me aside. It was very good. It was\nwonderful. But they had no mercy. They knew that in the very end, that regardless of what\nhappens, that we are all going to go.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I didn't remember it at first. What was devastating for my parents was that the Russians came\nin the year before the Germans, to Latvia. And they immediately took young, strong men,\nboys, and drafted them, and pushed them into the fighting in the woods, against the\nGermans. Because the Germans were already coming, towards Latvia. They used to Lativia,\nLithuania, Poland, for all the killings, because Hitler was under the impression that he was\ngoing to end the War. And when he wins the War he will say, \"I never killed any Jews. The\nPolacks did, the Latvians did, the Lithuanians did, all the other countries. I never killed\nanybody.\" That was the first thing that was so horrible for my parents, and my sisters, and\nmy other two brothers, to know that we may ever see them again. And we didn't.",
        "A: The first thing was, they took us from our homes, and they put us into a ghetto.",
        "A: That was the first thing.",
        "A: The very beginning of the War. The War broke out in 1940. I was liberated in 1945. 1940,\n'41 or '40. I don't remember exactly, because when the Germans came in, they made the\nghetto right away. They chased us out of our homes. We had no belongings. And that is\nwhen I remember we all lived in one room.",
        "A: And in the ghetto, horrible things happened, or tell me -- did you know about those things\nyourself, or were you insulated from knowing, because you were so young, or what did you\nknow, and what did your parents know?",
        "A: We didn't know much. We didn't know what was going to happen to us. We were just\nhoping that a miracle was going to happen. We did not know that they were actually going to\nkill us. They are actually going to tear us all apart. My two brothers were already gone, with\nthe Russians, at the time. And we were in the ghetto. We did not know anything. All I know\nis, when we walked, we walked in the middle of the street, even in the ghetto. You were not\nallowed to walk on the sidewalks, because that was too smooth and too good for the Jews.\nSo we walked in the middle of the street which was many years ago, naturally. It was paved.\nIt was big rocks, uneven rocks, that were cemented to the ground. And one day I didn't see it,\nbut I heard that a German SS man named Mengele came into the ghetto to oversee the\nghetto. And if he didn't like what you looked like, he took out his gun, and killed everyone\nthat walked. So the walking of the ghetto, from our apartment to a friend, was really\neliminated, because we were afraid that they were going to kill us. So, we stayed 1n, all the\ntime. But, morally, I mean we felt, we're together, whatever happens. We prayed it would\nhappen to all of us, at the same time, at the same place. But we still didn't believe that it\nwould. We still didn't believe it.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Did not, did not believe that. Why would we die? I mean there was a German Jew that came\nin 1939 to Latvia. He met my father and he said, \"Do you have any money?\" And my father\nsaid, \"For what?\" And he said, \"Do you have enough money for your family to go to Israel,\ngo to the United States, go anywhere you can, just run away from Latvia, because Hitler is\ngoing to come and he is going to kill you. I came from Germany to Latvia to escape him. But\nhe is going to come here too.\" And my father says, \"Don't be ridiculous.\" It was just like\nsomebody today would say to me that I live in this country, in the United States, take your\nfamily and run. Run to a country that is not going to kill you. Why would I do that, if I know\nthat that cannot happen? We didn't think that it was going to happen. We did not think that\nHitler was going to come to Latvia. Latvia was an independent country. Why would they\nwant us? But he did. And that is when it all happened. But there were very few Latvian Jews\nthat made it to Germany, to the camps. Like I told you, they eliminated them. They killed\nthem.",
        "A: Yeah, and also -- it's a matter of fact -- two of my brothers were married in the Latvian\nghetto. Both of their wives were expecting a baby. And both of their wives gave birth almost\nwithin a week apart. But when the Germans came into the ghetto, the first thing they did,\nthey went to the hospital. And what they did there, they made the grownups, the mothers that\ngave birth, the father was imprisoned, they threw the babies out the window, onto a pile on\nthe ground, and then they threw the mother who gave birth to the child, and whoever was\nthere, into that pile. And the ones that were still alive, they gave us to shovel them up, they\nwere dead, and threw them into -- like a big dug out grave. And my brother had to -- saw his\nwife and his baby in that pile. And he had to help bury them. And that was something that\nwas unbelievable. You cannot believe this. So, it makes personally I feel in my life, at this\nmoment, and all the way from my day of liberation, I cannot forget it. I still have nightmares.\nAnd I have had depression ever since. I live on medication, in order to be happy. And I am\nhappy. I am a happy person. But it is something that you cannot erase. You just cannot erase.\nLike I listen to the television, and I went to see Shindler's List, and Oprah Winfrey was on\ntelevision, and she said she saw Shindler's List. And she absolutely swears she has become a\ndifferent person, from what she saw. And that was only -- as authentic as he did the story, as\nbeautifully as it was directed and done, it was only about maybe ten percent as painful and\nthe real thing was. And he noted later in the magazine, and even in the newspaper that it took\nhim ten years to create this movie, so people would accept it, and want to go to it and see it,\nbut not be -- see the real, real horrors. Because you cannot show the real horrors. It is\nimpossible. It is unbelievable. Why would anybody do things, kill us? But to torture, the\ntorture that you go through, that repeats on you over. But I must say -- I will compliment\nmyself. I did not ever show it to my husband or show it to my children, what my inside was\nreally like, because I wanted my children to be happy, and they are. And I wanted my\nhusband to be happy, and he 1s. As far as I am concerned, I am happy. But I cannot wipe it\nout. And it's already 47, 48 years, I think, 50, right? You can't wipe it out. It is impossible.\nIt's not something you can just close the door and say, \"Well, so what?\" I never talk about it.\nI never talk about it. I don't like to talk about it. I don't need anybody's sympathy. And in the\nbeginning, when I told some Americans, a little bit of it, because they questioned me. \"Yes,\"\nthey said. \"The War was horrible. We also couldn't get any nylon stockings in this country.\"\nSo I figured I never talk about it. My friends know very little. And my children don't know\nthat much either. But my son got very interested in it. And when he heard that President\nCarter was going to make it possible to have a Museum, even before that, they were building\na committee who would help the Holocaust -- explain to the world the Holocaust. He wrote a\nletter and he -- they actually wrote back to him and said you filled every deed of your\nknowledge, but unfortunately we need more influential people. Which meant, they need\npeople with money, to build the Holocaust Museum, and to support it. then one day he got a\n-- on his machine, Mr. Steven Ludsin (ph.), this is the White House calling. We want you to\nappear at so and so time. We want to speak to you. Because they had already chosen all the\npeople. But he was the child of a survivor. And he got very, very, very interested in it. And I\nstill didn't tell him all. If they ever heard this interview there are a lot of things that would be\nvery strange to them. Because I do not -- I don't want them to have nightmares about it. I\nonly hope and pray -- I only hope and pray that the only reason I wanted to do this, was for\nmy grandchildren, of which I have three of them, by my daughter, and for their children, and\nfor their children's children. For the world to know, and people that say the Holocaust never\nexisted -- for these people.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Tell me how long the trip was. And tell me about the deportation itself, what you remember,\nand what season was it?",
        "A: The ghetto life was not too bad, because it was the very, very beginning, when the German's\ncame in. Now Latvia itself was a very beautiful city, very beautiful country. We had\nbeautiful vegetables. We had beautiful food. Everybody was employed. Everybody lived\nnicely. And when we were in the ghetto, we did not have much, because we were taken\naway our homes. And we had no clothes to change. Whatever we could grab in a little bag,\nthat's what was ours. And once we got into the ghetto, we didn't know what was happening.\nWe only said, please God, let us only be left together. We did not care what we left behind.\nMaterial things don't mean anything anymore. If you fight for life, and the ghetto life was not\n-- it horrible, but it wasn't -- because we didn't believe it was going to get any worse. We felt,\noh, this is going to be our punishment. And after that, the War will be over, and we will be\nsaved. And once we are saved, like -- we are young enough to build a life again. And my\nparents were too, because my mother, like I said, was 49, and my father was 50. They\nworked -- my father worked, he took care of the family.",
        "A: I think the whole ghetto thing was very short, well, maybe six months. Because they needed\nthe ghetto to bring the other trains from the other countries, to eliminate the Jews from\nGermany. And they didn't want to do their killing in Germany. So, then we walked from the\nghetto to these concentrated places, to serve them jobs like I told you where we lived, all day\nlong there, they took a big apartment building and from the bottom to the very top, which\nwas the six or seven stories high, was --one was the place where they made the boots for the\nNazis. One was a place where they made fur jackets for the Nazis' girlfriends. One was a\nplace where they made dresses for the Nazis' wives and girlfriends. And on top was one\nwhere they were making shoes, ladies' shoes. And anyone who had a trade was lucky,\nbecause they were used. But luckily, like I told you, when you are young enough, and you\nhave a lot of guts, which I did, I told them I could sew. And I did. I did know how to sew,\nbecause when I was in school, they taught us how to sew, like they do here, too, I\nunderstand, in the United States. But you are under pressure, of the necessity. You are the\nbest -- it is the best teacher. You learn an awful lot, even things you don't know how to do,\nyou learn how to do it. You have to. And it was a big help. And then they couldn't keep us in\nLatvia anymore. We had to go to Germany, to the camps, which was not really Germany,\nbecause if 1t was or , , or . And there's Dachau. They were all on\nthe outskirts of Germany, because, like I said, when the War would have been over, and\nHitler would have won, he would have said he did not kill the Jews. So, that's what it's all\nabout. That's why when I went yesterday to the Museum, it was very, very emotional. But by\nthe same token, I was very, very thrilled to see young kids, because school is out.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: What it was, it was actually -- they used to take a gaggle of people, in the middle of the\nstreet, and they just were shooting them, and making the ghetto more available for the next\nshipments. So, I saw it. And I heard it. What I didn't see, I heard about it. And if I listened, I\nheard the screams. So, you are always -- and you still didn't believe it. You still didn't think\n-- you were very fearful. You were very careful, not to expose yourself. But, how can you\nnot hear? How can you not see? If one was saved, if one person was -- they didn't shoot, and\nhe survived, he told it to us, what they did. And there was not people who were any different\nthan you and I. It was just that they happened to be picked out, taken in the middle of the\nstreet, and just shooting them. And that was their biggest pleasure. They did 1t with so much,\nwith so much -- they were actually happy about it. They were -- when I saw Sophie's choice,\nI realized how great the movie was made, because they did it with a lot of love, although\nthey tell you today that they were assigned to do the job, and they followed instructions.\nThey enjoyed it. They loved it. They Latvians loved it. And the Germans loved it. They did it\nwith a lot of pleasure. And they were not, as far as I'm concerned, I could not believe the\nGerman people could do such a thing, because they were very cultured people, very\nintelligent people, very clean people, to become such murderers. And the Hitler Youth, little\nboys, 13 years old, 14 years old, they were just as poisoned as a 40 year old. They took their\nguns and they were shooting. So, as long as you were Jewish -- they got any kind of a Jew,\neven if you were a quarter of a Jew, and eighth of a Jew, they killed you. It was something\nthat is indescribable. You can't really -- to this day, I can't believe it. It's unbelievable, that\npeople can do it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I had one girlfriend in particular. She was from -- she was from Germany. And luckily we\nwere always -- we became friends. Luckily we were always shipped to the same place at the\nsame time. And we were even choosing our -- in the barracks when we came in, we chose\nthe upper level of the bunks, because it had a little light there. And we also had no control\nover our bodies. We were so weak, that some of the elderly people, the elderly women used\nto urinate and it just came down onto us, so we made up, we were going up to the top. So\nnobody would do anything on top of us. But we befriended each other. And we still keep in\ntouch, and she did not know that I survived. And I did not know that she survived. And the\noverall, the woman all were very civil to each other. The only time we became animals was\nwhen our piece of bread was given to us. Then we became animals. But otherwise, we had\nactually -- did not approach each other by name, as much, because there were lots of them\nthat were from different countries. And you have to shift for yourself. Whatever you did, you\nhad to shift for yourself. But I made friends. I made friends. And I have some of them, to this\nday. That I speak to my girlfriend, who landed in Mexico City. And I speak to her. We keep\nin touch with each other. And we even arranged to go away together, on vacation, so we\nwould be without husbands, and be by ourselves. That was very important, to have\nsomebody left, who has been through the same as you did. Because that person is the most\ncompassionate person to you, and me to her.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. In a way, yes. We always hung on together for the coping, because they watched\nus constantly, as though we could go someplace. And they also -- the day we walked in the\nshowers, she was not as badly infected as I was, with the body rash, and she was walking\nstep into step, and covering my -- the front of my body, so the SS men would not put me in\nthe shower. For whatever, we knew it was for death. We knew it wasn't for anything but\ndeath. By her covering me, I think it saved me. So, we went to the left, she went to the left,\nand the others went to the right, which was to the gas chamber.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, that was very interesting. We had heard that the American Army -- they are at the\nborder. And we had all the time planes flying. They were flying. And if they were giving one\nor two it meant that everybody had to turn their lights off in that city, the people who lived\nthere, because they did not want to be killed by the bombs of the Americans, or whoever\ncame across. I personally feel that if the War would have lasted another 10 days, we all\nwould have been dead, because it was the end of the line, as far as the hunger, and the\nsickness. So, now we hear a five alarm. And with that five alarm the gates opened up, and\nthe SS women and the SS men ran away from the camp. So, we ran. But immediately after\nthat -- a little while after that, and the gates are open, and we went into the city. And that city\nwas very bombed out. And we knew that the Americans were not there yet. So we found a\nplace where it was flat to the ground, the building was bombed out, the apartment buildings\nwere bombed out. And we opened up a little opening there, a little rock or two rocks, and we\ncrawled into the basement of that bombed out building and we were about nine or twelve of\nus. Once we got in there, now there was a question. What are we going to do about eating, if\nit lasts another few days, before the Americans come in? The first thing I did -- we did, is as\nwe were crawling in there we saw about -- I don't know how many feet away it was, one\nbuilding -- a little building remained, and it was not bombed out. And it was a cleaning store.\nSo, my brothers broke the window down, and the other guys, and got the clothing from the\ncleaning store, and we eliminated our striped clothes, and put on the clothes that didn't fit.\nBut it did not matter. And we waited. And while we were in that basement, we had heard\nthat the Americans were already in that city, so we took up the guys to walk out, and walk in\nthe street. And as we walked in the street, American soldiers came to us. And they saw that\nwe were shaved, and the men wore -- they called it , which was skinny bodies, skinny\narms, and fat legs from hunger. And one was a German Jew, who was an officer 1n the\nAmerican Army, and he said to us, what language do you speak, in German? Naturally, we\nall jumped on him, because we all spoke German. And he immediately organized for the\nsoldiers to go back to their place, where they were staying. And within half and hour or so,\nthey brought us all their rations, of their food, a toothbrush, I asked for. I hadn't brushed my\nteeth for years. And he brought us a bar of chocolate, to us was -- it was unbelievable. I mean\nhe did not eat -- now I know it was a big Hershey bar. And you know how it is cut? We ate\nlittle crumbs of it, so it would last longer. And -- before we walked out, the German found\nout that there were Jews hiding in that basement. Now we hear them. And how can we hide\nfrom them? So, it was like a little cubby, with steps originally going up, and underneath 1s\nalways a little cubby. And we all crawled into that cubby. And we did not breathe. So the\ndid not hear us. And they said in German, \"We knew there are Jews here, but where\nare they?\" And they walked out, luckily. And when we walked out, we met the American\nsoldiers. Now, the rest of our group found out that the camp is empty, but there is some food,\nsome food. So they went back there to get the food. And they were caught, because the Nazis\ncame back. It was not quite over. And I told my brothers, we are not going back. We are\nstaying right here. And we did. And I think in the last minute they killed a few people who\nwe were with, because they thought the war was still not over. That particular city was not\nliberated for them, yet. So, we decided to stay there, and we'll wait. And we'll be walked out.\nAnd then one -- I don't know where I got my brains, but I decided that we cannot eat a lot,\nbecause that would kill us. It killed quite a few of my friends, that I was with, because we\nwere so undernourished, our stomach was so -- could not conceive or accept that much food.\nAnd I did it for my brothers, as well. And thank God that he did it, because a lot of them\noverate. They ate too much. There was nothing much to be had, but people ate potatoes,\nwhich was like cake. And from then on in, they stayed there, when we were liberated and we\ntried to find the place where to live. And start to work for papers, to go someplace. Because\nwe didn't want to remain in Germany. The memories were horrible. The streets were bloody.\nThere was no need to stay there. So, we arranged it.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: In Poland they did a Resistance. But they did not succeed. You cannot resist, when you are\nnaked. Do you know what I mean? It's like taking a person, and undressing the person and\nsaying, \"Fight for your life.\" With what? There was nothing, never. We never had anything.",
        "A: That's a good question. No. It was only easier if you were young enough. Because they\neliminated anything under 13, and over 30 were killed. Okay? I shall also never forget, in\nLatvia, at the Latvian concentration camp, a few of the mothers had their children. They\nwere like ten years old, nine years old, five years old. And then they came one day and said,\n\"We are going to take your children. We are going to take them to a beautiful place where\nthey are going to be given more things than you have. So we are going to put them on a\ntruck. And we are going to ship them over to that place.\" And the mothers, and we all knew\nit was for death. Now, these mothers -- I had a friend that I knew through the camps, she had\na child. They actually hung onto those trucks -- it was an open truck. They piled them up,\nstanding up. They were hanging on, to whatever they could hang on. And they were dragged\nalong, until they had no more strength, and their arms couldn't hold them up, and they fell on\nthe ground, because they knew their children were going to death. And these children were\ncrying, screaming for their parents, crying for their mothers. \"Mama, mama, please, save\nme.\" You know, it was -- it was -- 1t was just horrible. And they were eliminated. And they\neliminated. They kept on eliminating, over 30 of them. They had one young boy who went\nthrough the whole thing with us, and we all saved him. When they counted us, we shoved\nhim -- he was little, we shoved him between us, we covered him with our upper parts of our\njackets. And then, when we had to go anywhere, the mother of this child somehow or other,\nshe sewed up -- you know our bunks -- we had a straw covered with burlap. That was our\nmattress. And we helped her take that burlap and sew it up, and she covered him, and\npretended it was like sugar, or flour, or whatever. And it was her child. He was the only child\nthat we saved. He is still alive.",
        "A: He was hidden with us. He was like a big, big thing. Because they escaped taking him, plain\nas day. When they took the children away, somehow or other, they didn't get him. When all\nthese kids were shipped away, and they were all killed, and he was the only child, we found\nlater on, was living. And we weren't going to let him die. So, we all fought for his life, and he\nsurvived.",
        "A: We were going to work. We were hiding him. Somehow or other, he was hiding under the\nlast -- the -- in the bunk, you know. So we were hiding him there, and wherever -- wherever\nwe could. There's a lot to say about people who go through horrors, how your mind works,\nhow you really can do -- like the day when they were sending all -- there was another\nincident when they were sending everybody somewhere. And they were counting\neverybody. And there was a drain, where the water runs down? And I left myself -- I put\nmyself into that. I lifted that. I don't even know how I was able to lift up that iron drain. And\nI put myself, my body, into it. And I held on to the -- to those tron things, and I saved myself.\nBecause, your mind is -- it's the animal instinct, I think. If you want to live, that you can use\nso much imagination, to really save yourself. There are so many things -- I mean there were\nso many things happening. There was a man -- the oldest one in the camp, of the men's\ncamp. And he was -- also he played, he was a musician. I think he was a cellist, too. And\nthey beat the hell out of him, the Jewish guy, the one that wore the thing on his arm. He\ncouldn't get off his bunk, to go to be counted, because he was so sick. He was only 50 years\nold, and he was the oldest. So, he Absolutely -- they beat him, with that black police stick.\nAnd he crawled out to be counted, because 1f you wouldn't -- because if the number would\nbe off, then we would be killed, at least 10 of us, for one person. How -- you couldn't escape,\nbut they would say, where is he? You know. So, the men dragged him out. We weren't\ncounted together. The men's camp were counted. To say it was easier for a woman than for a\nman, I don't think so. I don't really know. I think it was equally as hard, because -- very, very\n-- it is actually up to the individual. In the first place, where we were working in Latvia,\nbefore the camps were made, there was a friend of mine. He was my age. And he turned out\n-- he is still alive. He is a violinist. He plays every instrument. And he was little enough, and\nI was little enough and they used to give us great food there. It was farina. And farina was\ncooked for 250 people, in one big kettle. It was about seven feet tall. So in order to clean\nthat, you have to get inside. So, my main friend, at that time we were not being together, but\nwe still had a little contact in this place where we worked. So, he used to clean the inside of\nthe pot, and I used to clean the outside of the pot, okay? And it was in the kitchen. And we\nhad an , what they called . He was the main -- the manager of the entire thing, the SS\nman. He was more than an ordinary SS man. He had a higher rank. He was the main man.\nAnd all of a sudden, we hear screams. And he brings 1n this guy, puts him in the middle of\nthe kitchen, and shoots him, kills him. That was so strange to us, because that was the first\nplace that we were working at, and going back to the ghetto. And we couldn't ask him, why\ndid you kill him? He felt like it. He found him and he wasn't working at that moment, so he\ntook him to the kitchen and he killed him. And that was for no reason at all. And he was\nnice. He was a nice SS man. He wasn't so bad, because he had -- and you want to hear the\nbest? When the War was over, he said, when the Americans liberated us, he said he was\nJewish. And you know what? He lived for a while. He lived. And when they asked him how\ncould you be Jewish? He didn't look like a German, he had dark hair. He put on the striped\nclothes, and he said, \"I'm Jewish.\" He says. So the American says, \"What was going on in\nthe camps?\" So, naturally he could describe everything that was going on, because he was\npart of it. And the American Army was lenient. We knocked our brains to find the Nazis,\nafter we were liberated, and when the fellows brought them -- they found them and brought\nthem to the American Embassy, and expected for them to be killed, they wouldn't kill them.\nThe Americans didn't kill them. Because now I know why. They have to have enough proof,\nto know whether or not he was really a capo or an SS man. So, that's -- there are so many\nepisodes, that we would -- if we sat now, for another eight hours, I could tell you, but I do try\nto choke it out. I try very hard. And I hope I will be able, but as I get older, I find it more\ndifficult, to be very honest. And the biggest pleasure, for me, is to speak to you right now,\nand to be able to come to Washington, and to see the Holocaust Memorial. Because that is\nabsolutely the greatest thing I have seen. The man who designed it, the architect, the people\nwho had the pictures, who saved it, who found it, or what they did, is unbelievable. The\nshoes, the original things that are in that museum. I am so angry at myself, that to save\nmyself, that I took off my striped clothes, and I threw it away. And I put something on, so I\nwouldn't be recognized as a prisoner. And I put the kerchief on my head. I am sorry I don't\nhave that jacket. But my brother saved it. And he gave it to the museum in Florida. That is\nwhere he lives. And he has his number on it. And it is his jacket. And it 1s written in that\nmuseum, that that belonged to the prisoner so and so, and so and so. I think that 1s very\ngratifying. I think that is -- that trip that I just took will definitely be very well remembered.\nBut I hope that for many, many years that everybody should know about it. That 1s my input,\nto do that. Because I am not -- I am hurting myself. But I am not that selfish. Somebody said\nto me, \"Did you go to see Shindler's List?\" I said, \"Of course. Why not?\" \"How could you do\nthat? How can you go and see it?\" I said, \"Did you?\" She says, \"Not yet, because I don't like\nto see sad things.\" I said, \"How can you be so selfish. It isn't that sad, to begin with. And how\ncan you ignore something of history? The world should know and you don't want to see it?\"\nAnd they went. And they all went.",
        "A: We had several songs that - first of all, these songs were made up by some talented that we\nwere with, at the camps. So, the one in particular that I remember, and I often sing it, 1s\n, which means do not say, ever, that you walked the last walk, which gave us courage,\ngave us hopes. And singing together many times, as bad as things were, we were happy. We\nwere happy to be able to make each other happy, by singing. And those songs were very\ngood for us, because we went, like I told you to the UJA meetings, that they had people who,\nfor an evening, for dinner, and then our songs. After we were finished singing those songs,\nthey were very willing to give money to the United Jewish Appeal, because they knew and\nthey saw the proof, what was -- how it happened, how we came to this country, since they\npaid for us.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No. We were never together, never. We were only together by liberation.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I sang modern German songs, cheerful songs that they wanted to hear. And that was part of\ntheir pleasure. What was going on behind the curtain from -- I mean that was hiding me, I\nnever looked, because I wasn't interested. I wasn't supposed to. And I never did. But I know\nthat is the way they entertained the SS men. And I want you to know one more thing, how\nsick these women were, these SS women were. That when we were running out to run away,\nwe had to pass their quarters, where they were situated. And quickly, very quickly we ran\nthrough it. There were some photographs and we grabbed it and we ran with it. And they\nalways had dogs. They always -- every SS man had a dog. Every SS woman had a dog.\nWhen they walked through the camps, into the barracks, they always had a dog, because -- I\ndon't know why. They did. Then we saw pictures that they actually photographed their\nsexual satisfaction with a dog. That is how sick they were, which was not too clear to me.\nBut later on 1t was explained to me. And I also remember one more thing. My husband and I\nwent to Europe. And we went to visit friends, relatives, and so forth. And our trip was\nscheduled with a stop in . But somehow or other we had to land in , either to\nrefuel or I don't know what. But they didn't want to keep us on the plane. And they wanted\nus to get off the plane, and then come back. And then they will fly us where were supposed\nto fly. And I looked out of the little window of the plane and I saw a black raincoat, belted,\nblack, long, with a big German Shephard. And it was a policeman, a German policeman.\nAnd I actually lost my -- I felt like I was going through an emotional horror, because they\nlooked exactly, exactly like the Nazis did, during the War. And I said to my husband, \"I am\nnot getting off.\" And he said, \"Why not?\" And I said, \"I am afraid.\" He said, \"What are you\nafraid of?\" I said, \"Take a look at them. They look the same, just like the murderers.\" And\nthey did. So, the fact remains that it is not easy to go through life, to have experienced what\nwe experienced. And I am grateful, for myself, as well as for all the other survivors, that\nsome of us survived to tell the story. To me, this is the biggest, the best thing that could have\nhappened.",
        "A: Yes. That is what happened. That's how the SS woman knew that I did, because I sang, we\nsang together, we sang apart. We taught each other songs. We put songs together. We had to\ndo that. We did it and that is how the SS woman knew that I could sing. She had no other\nknowledge. And that is when she started to send for me, to come to that place where she was\nliving, that part of the camp, to entertain her gentlemen, the SS men. They were sick. They\nwere very sick. But unfortunately I heard that some of the SS women pulled the same thing.\nThey said that they were Jews. And they came to the United States. Because they know\neverything that went on, in the camps. And they had no -- there was no proof. How can you\nprove you are not? I mean a German girl -- the SS women looked like we did. They were\ndark. They were light. They were blonde. There was no stamp on them, I am German. And\nyou are Jewish. They looked the same. As far as I'm concerned. And as far as anyone 1s\nconcemed. They look the same. That is why I can never tell apart, to this day, whether this\nperson is Jewish or not Jewish. It really doesn't matter to me. It has no meaning to me. I have\nvery, very good friends who are not Jewish, and I cherish them, and I respect them, and I\nlove them. So, during the War, before the War broke out, we had very dear friends who were\nnot Jewish. And they used to see us walking in the middle of the street, like horses. And they\ncouldn't even look at us. They were afraid to look at us. They didn't want to let on that they\nknew us, because it could have been hard too, you know. Knowing a Jew was a criminal\nthing.",
