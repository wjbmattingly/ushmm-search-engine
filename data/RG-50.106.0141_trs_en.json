        "Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection\ninterview with Kurt Roberg, conducted by Gail Schwartz on March 16\", 2001 at the\nHolocaust Museum. This is tape number one, side A. Please give us your full name.",
        "Answer: I am Kurt w for Walter Roberg, r-o-b-e-r-g, and I |\u2014 am a resident \u2014 I\u2019m a\ncitizen of the United States and a resident of Tenafly, New Jersey.",
        "Q: And where were you born, and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Germany in a town called Celle, which is the German pronunciation,\nspelled c-e- double I-e, near Hannover in northern Germany, on May 16\", 1924.",
        "Q: Now let\u2019s talk a little bit about your family. How far back can you trace the\ngenerations in this area of Germany.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s a very interesting question and I will illustrate it by, well, telling you what\nhappened to me. I\u2014I went to a German school, as a matter of fact I was the only \u2014 during\nHitler time already, from 1934 to 1938 to Kristallnacht, I was the only Jewish student in\na Ss \u2014s \u2014 student body of about 280 in a high school that was a [indecipherable]\ngymnasium. One of the assignments we had \u2014 now thas \u2014 this was about 1936, and\nGermany of course was very, a-as we would say, a \u2014 a roots \u2014 you know, tracing your\nroots. They were interested in genealogy. So one of our assignments in social studies was\nMarch 16, 2001\nto trace our ancestry. How was I gonna trace my ancestry? My \u2014 I \u2014 ma \u2014 my mother\ncontacted her sister, a maiden sister who lived with my \u2014 in my mother\u2019s home village,\nand contacted my father\u2019s maiden sister, who lived in my father\u2019s home village, and they\nboth yeah, tried to do \u2014 trace our history. And Martha, which was the Roberg side of the\nfamily, got as far as great-grandfather, didn\u2019t get very far. And Aunt Babette(ph) of the\nMarx family, my mother\u2019s family near \u2014 in a village called Byetahl(ph) near Heidelberg\nwas much more successful. She first traced the history back to 1871, which was written\nup in the local \u2014 what do we call it in German? Standes amt, the local village registry.\nPrior to that, all births and deaths were, even of the Jewish community were inter \u2014\nentered in the church registry of the Catholic church. So she went to the priest and he, as\na favor, for 10 mark or so, wrote out our whole genealogy and we were able to trace the f\n\u2014 Marx family back to 1741. So I drew up a family tree based on this information. This\ntook about oh, a couple of months to get that all written out by hand, turning the pages in\nthe book and it became a matter of fascination for the priest himself. And I drew a\u2014a\nfamily tree, and I turned it in and it turned out that Roberg, the only Jew in the class,\ncould trace his ancestry in Germany back further than my 29 Christian stu \u2014 fellow\nstudents. And my teacher, who was very s-supportive, and nya \u2014 he was not a Nazi by\nany means, he made a point of it, to \u2014 yeah, tell the class that Roberg could trace his\nancestry back further than any of the German boys. So it\u2019s a longwinded answer to your\nvery brief question.\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "Q: But a very interesting answer. Tell me your father\u2019s name and his occupation.",
        "A: My father\u2019s name was Victor and he was a merchant, a m \u2014 well, by \u2014 by trade in dry\ngoods, soft goods. We owned a little store, he had learned a trade at age 14, he served an\napprenticeship, he learned a business and then he was a \u2014 a journeyman, a salesman and\nthen a traveling salesman for a Jewish firm. There \u2014 he was \u2014 Jews at that time were\nemployed by other Jews. It was unusual, I guess, to be employed by a Gentile firm. And",
        "Q: What was the name of the firm he worked for?",
        "A: In Celle, it was Gebriider Freidberg. That\u2019s Freidberg Brothers, f-r-e-i-d-b-e-r-g,\nFreidberg Brothers and they owned a department store in Celle and he came there, I\nguess, about 1904 or thereabouts, and he worked there through the war. My father was\nvery nearsighted and was unfit for military duty, so \u2014 and \u2014 and right after World War I,\nhe went into his own business across the street from Freidberg\u2019s, set up a cint \u2014\ncompetition, and ma \u2014 then the inflation came, and he strubbled \u2014 struggled, he wasn\u2019t a\nparticularly successful businessman, but \u2014 and it was a \u2014 it was a struggle.",
        "Q: Did your mother work?",
        "A: Yes, my mother. My parents got married in 1921 and my mother, of course, came into\nthe business. She had some sort of a dowry, which in those days was expected. I think it\nwas a marriage that was arranged. I\u2019m not sure, but I think it was through the newspaper,\nwhich was the customary way, rather than shotgun. And so that was the then modern\nMarch 16, 2001\nway. There was the \u2014 a newspaper, Jewish paper called Jiidische Familienblatt, the\nJewish Family paper, and there were marriage proposals or whatever and as we have\ntoday in some of the better United States papers, started from \u201cThe Village Voice\u201d on.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: My mother\u2019s name was Selma, but she was called Frieda. That\u2019s another story, but I\nwon\u2019t go into that now, and her maiden name was Marx, m-a-r-x.",
        "Q: Did you have any siblings?",
        "A: Yes, I have a \u2014 an older brother, Harry. He was Hans, Hans Werner, and I was\ncalled Walter. And he was called Hans and I was called Kurt.",
        "Q: And ha \u2014 what\u2019s the difference in age?",
        "A: He\u2019s two and a half years older. He was then, and still is.",
        "Q: Did you have a large extended family in the town? Aunts, uncles, grandparents,\ncousins?",
        "A: On my mother\u2019s side there was a large family. She was one of six surviving siblings,\nbut none in the same town. They lived all over me \u2014 Germany, but they were all in close\n\u2014 in close touch with each other, there were weekly letters to everybody, and \u2014 including\nGrandma in \u2014 in Byetahl(ph). And so it was a very special \u2014 my \u2014 on my mother\u2019s side\nwas a close knit family. On my father\u2019s side less so, he and his \u2014 my father and his\nbrother were not on particularly good terms, and the maiden aunt, sister, which he was a\nMarch 16, 2001\n\u2014a family of three siblings, she lived in her parents\u2019 house in a little village called\nLemforde, I-e-m-f-o-umlaut-r-d-e near Osnabriick in northern Germany.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about the town itself.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: How many Jewish families tell a \u2014 out of a total population?",
        "A: Ah, it\u2019s a good question. We were a small Jewish congregation, but rather distinct.\nCelle, as you may or may not know, is of historic significance in that it was a m \u2014 the seat\nof a duke, Herzog, the Duke of Brunswick-Ltineburg \u2014 Brunswick-Luneburg, and so\nit was a white collar community. Our synagogue in Celle was built in 1741 and is today\nthe on \u2014 the only surviving synagogue in northern Germany that was \u2014 well, it was\nvandalized of course, but that survived, it was not burned or destroyed. It was destroyed\nfrom the inside, but the building remains. It was during my time, had of course gone past\nits peak, people had started moving away after World War I. Some families moved to\nHannover, which was 40 kilometers. 25 miles away was the nearest large city, some\nmoved to Berlin. The remaining active members in the community were about a dozen\nfamilies. There were some Jewish people who were not active, they didn\u2019t attend\nservices. They, I guess were Jews by religion only, or th-they \u2014 the Germans so nicely put\nit, Jewish citizens of a Hebrew faith or persuasion. And that was by \u2014 by choice, they\nreally didn't want to be identified with the Jewish community per se, and that was their\nchoice. Give you an illustration, for \u2014 we only had services in our synagogue three times\nMarch 16, 2001\na year, on the high holidays, rush \u2014 you know, Passover and Rosh Hashanah and Yom\nKippur. Well, Simchas Torah was observed, and you know, but we had trouble getting a\nminyan together, of course, and we were, by German standards Conservative, not\nOrthodox, but the synagogue of course was built, like m-m-most German synagogues\nwith the women in \u2014 in the upper, on the balcony, whatever you call it, and the men\ndownstairs and only men counted for \u2014 yeah, for minyan. However, if you were 12 years\nold and you were gonna be Bar Mitzvahed the following year, you could already be\ncounted as a minyan man. So it was that kind of a thing, or if things got very tough and\nwe were nine, as a last resort they would say \u2014 we would send one of the boys, sometimes\nme, over to one of the non-observing Jews, one of them was Solomon \u2014 Solomon and\nsay \u2014 ask Solomon if hell come to minyan, you know, and then reluctantly and grumpily\nwould come and di \u2014 um, sit in for minyan.",
        "Q: How many Jewish families were there in town? How many Jewish families were in\ntown?",
        "A: Observing or otherwise, maybe 12 or 14. I really haven\u2019t counted them, I can \u2014 but I\nhave \u2014 I have the records at home, I mean, I can make that available if you\u2019re interested.",
        "Q: So, your family was observant? How would you describe your family?",
        "A: Well, we were traditionally observant. My mother came from a observant family,\nmeaning my grandmother kept milchig and fleishig separate. My father came from an\nOrthodox \u2014 well, an observant family. My father\u2019s family, it\u2019s a family of butchers,\nMarch 16, 2001\nkosher butchers, but I guess the scene at the turn of the 20\" century was really the \u2014 I\u2019m\nsure I\u2019m not telling you anything new, you know, the German Jewish community had\nbeen, well, had the opportunity for the first time to assimil \u2014 well, to try and assimilate or\nat least to practice by choice, and the tendency was away from \u2014 from religious\nobservations and to assimilate, to try and assimilate. So there were many Jews who felt\nprimarily as Germans of Jewish faith. And I guess we were \u2014 my father ate treyf\noccasionally, because when he traveled he couldn\u2019t observe all th \u2014 so as a \u2014 as a boy, as\na young man already, he stopped eating kosher as he did at home, and my mother the\nsame way when she got out into daily life, modified, and 1t was called new kosher, neu-\nkosher. New kosher meaning you would eat milk and meat mixed but no pork, and \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Did you observe the Sabbath, Shabbat?",
        "A: We were aware of Shabbat, but we were allowed to ride our bicycles, while on Rosh\nHashanah, Yom Kippur, we were not. So Shabbat was \u2014 it was a work day for us, we\ncouldn\u2019t afford to keep the store closed and I guess that sort of set the pattern.",
        "Q: Were your parents Zionists?\\",
        "A: We were sympathetic \u2014 well, Zionism for us started in 1933 or \u201934. We \u2014 the\ncommunity, our congregation was too small to have a rabbi, but we did have a cantor\nwho was a retired schoolteacher and had a pension and he was the cantor and also our,\nwell, Hebrew teacher and he would officiate at all services, of course. And that was \u2014 but\nyou know, we \u2014 we didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t have a \u2014 a rabbi, per se.\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "Q: What language did you speak at home?",
        "A: German, what else? I mean, well, again, as you probably know, German Jews tried to\nma \u2014 be very low key, be as un-Jewish in appearance, not that we were ashamed or \u2014 you\nknow, of being Jews, we were conscious Jews, but we were Jews in religious observance,\nnot, you know, it was not an ethnic group other than by designation by the Germans. I\nmean, we were \u2014 we were aware of being Jews, and we wanted to be Jews, but I guess we\nhad no choice anyway, so \u2014",
        "Q: Did you feel very German as a young child?",
        "A: N-No, that\u2019s a tough \u2014 I wa \u2014 we never really thought about it. We knew we \u2014 we \u2014\nwe knew we were nem \u2014 you know, German, we knew we were Jews, and of course,\nwell, consciously, wh-when Hitler came to power, it was in 1933, I was nine years old, I\nremember distinctly when I came to school. I started school in 1930. Before that I went a\nyear to kindergarten, I was four years old. And we were taught from small child on not to\nmake any, as it was known as rishiss(ph). Are you familiar with the \u2014 with the term\nrishiss(ph)?",
        "Q: No, could you explain it?",
        "A: Yes. Rishass(ph) I think is a Hebrew word. It \u2014 it is to draw attention to \u2014 yeah, don\u2019t\nmake wave, don\u2019t make rishiss(ph) means don\u2019t \u2014 you know, don\u2019t draw attention to\nyour Jewishness. If \u2014 so if you did anything that would be disturbing to the Christian\ncommunity, if you flaunted your Jewishness, you would say that makes rishiss(ph).\nMarch 16, 2001\nRishass(ph) is, I think \u2014 I don\u2019t know what it is in Hebrew, but I \u2014 anyway. So we were \u2014\nwe were taught not to make waves, to conform, not to draw attention to ourselves by\nbeing obnoxious or obviously Jewish. Do the things that were ascribed by the Gentile\ncommunity as being typically Jewish.",
        "Q: Such as?",
        "A: Be loud, be boisterous and you know, I mean, if you would see somebody with \u2014 with\n\u2014 with \u2014 with \u2014 with payos, obviously they\u2019re \u2014 and that \u2014 that was a Jewish trait. Or to\nwalk straight, to be \u2014 Jews were thought of as being non-athletic. My mother was very\nproud that we excelled in sports, my brother and I, and it was part of our \u2014 well, that we\nbelonged, we were as good as they were. And well, it was odd that even my brother and I,\nduring you know, Hitler times in high school, were allowed to participate in sporting\nevents which in many other cities, Jews were no longer allowed to participate. And I\nremember Harry, my brother, Hans got a gold oak leaf and \u2014 with some event we \u2014 we\nhad \u2014 from \u2014 from our school we had the sports event and I got a bronze even \u2014 oak leaf.\nNow, I must also tell you that on crystal \u2014 the night \u2014 yeah, Crystal Night, or the day \u2014\nthe morning after Crystal Night, when we found out, you know, what had happened in\ntown, our apartment was not searched or destroyed or what, but we expected that maybe\nthe Gestapo or city police would come and search the house. And we got rid of \u2014 my\nmother got rid of anything that would be intimidating, like foreign currency wi \u2014 my\nmother had a few British pounds, Palestinian pounds th \u2014 that her sister had brought back\nMarch 16, 2001\nfrom Palestine in 1934, and the oak leaves that Harry and I had earned, because if they\nwould come in and say \u2014 see that we had oak leaves, maybe the feeling was, what are you\ntrying to prove, you Jew bastards? You know. So she got rid of it, not to antagonize the\npolice should they come, and should they find this and question it.",
        "Q: So you were athletic.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you enjoy the athletics? Is it something you enjoyed doing?",
        "A: Of course I did, to this day.",
        "Q: What sports did you take part in?",
        "A: Well, I \u2014 swimming, but I was best in gymnastics, you know, which was the high bar,\nparallel bars, rings, that sort of thing, and I always got an A. I got an A in the fall, and \u2014\nand a B plus in the summer because we are \u2014 field and track, I didn't care for that too\nmuch.",
        "Q: How would you describe yourself? Were you a very independent young child?",
        "A: No. I wasn\u2019t in \u2014 I mean, I was lucky that I had a playmate, my brother Harry and I,\nwe had German friends in the neighborhood, a group, really sort of next door neighbors.\nBut after 1933 \u2014 well, \u201934, they started pulling back and also we did not want them to be\nembarrassed by associating with us because it \u2014 you know, some \u2014 a third party might \u2014\nmight say the \u2014 you know, there was one, his name was Willie Wrobleski(ph), I f\u2014 and\nthey were very poor working family. The father was unemployed during the depression, I\nMarch 16, 2001\nremember, but they were really decent people and we played with them. We had a shack\nin the back where they had like a little stable in the back where the boys\n[indecipherable] there were four of us that really sort of stuck together. But then my\nmother thought that maybe they would feel uncomfortable associating \u2014 having their kid\nassociate with us, so we eased back and \u2014",
        "Q: What did that mean to you as a young child? Were you aware of the ramifications of\nthat, of what it meant?",
        "A: Oh yes, of course we were aware. We were aware of the sensitivities, you know, of\nother people, of \u2014 now, I must say that Celle was considered, not only by us who lived in\nCelle, but ba \u2014 of course we were aware of what happened in other communities where\nkids were beaten up on the way to school, and \u2014 and all that \u2014",
        "Q: How \u2014 how were you aware of that?",
        "A: You heard, you know, you \u2014 you \u2014 y-you heard from other Jewish families o \u2014 in \u2014 in\nHessen, in he \u2014 yeah, where \u2014 where a lot of Jewish families lived in the country and\nwhere there was a lot of anti-Semitism, either for business reason or just to go and beat\nup a Jew. Were \u2014 the kids were intimidated on the way to school, they were called Jew \u2014\nJew bastard, Jude itsich(ph), you know \u2014",
        "Q: What does that mean to an eight year old or nine year old Jewish child?",
        "A: Well, it probably \u2014 it means the same thing, we are going through that right now, here\nin our society with the bullying. It was bullying, okay? You pick on a Jew kid, and Jew\nMarch 16, 2001\nkids were \u2014 reputedly couldn\u2019t take care of themselves, they \u2014 you know\n[indecipherable] that \u2014 gang up on a Jew and beat him up. Why? Because just like in\nAmerica today, kids gang up on others, on weak, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 1t had nothing\nparticularly to do with who we were, but what we were.",
        "Q: Because you were so athletic, did you feel as threatened?",
        "A: No, I never felt threatened. I remember I was still in elementary school, so I was\nprobably either eight or ni \u2014 must have been nine years old, my last year in elementary\nschool. So that would have made it 1933, and Hitler was already in power. It was after\nthe Macht Ubernahme, which you kn \u2014 power grab. Somebody from not my class but\nanother class, called me Jude itsich(ph), which was a Jew \u2014 Jew bastard, whatever,\nduring recess 1n the schoolyard. And we weren\u2019t allowed to fight in the schoolyard or in\nschool, that \u2014 it\u2019s not like \u2014 was not like America, it was like in Germany where we still\nhad corporal punishment. If children misbehaved they were caned in front of the entire\nclass. Pretty humiliating experience. So kids toed the line. But if you m \u2014 had a fight to\nfight, you fought it outside the school. So he want \u2014 he says, you want to fight, Pll \u2014 P\u2019ll \u2014-\nI said, Pll fight. ?\u201911 meet you in the park after school.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Kurt Roberg. This is tape number one, side B and you were\ntalking about this altercation with this young man in your class.",
        "A: You can call it altercation, I call it a challenge of a fight. So after school I went home,\nor w-went to my \u2014 our store, and in the park, which was the \u2014 you know, in the \u2014 1s the \u2014\nthe French park. This guy was waiting with \u2014 of course, the word had spread, he\u2019s going\nto fight with Roberg, the Jew, whatever they had spread. And everybody was around, I\ntook off my \u2014 my backpack, we had a Tornister it was called, a backpack. Took off my \u2014\nmy jacket and got into a fight. I\u2019d never fought in my life, but I knew what to do, I was\ninterested in Schmeling and Sharkey and Joe Louis, I think was around already. So I\nknew about fighting. And we started squaring off and he landed some punches and I\nlanded a lucky Sunday punch and bloodied his nose. So I was the first \u2014 first one to draw\nblood. Just then somebody hollered jute(ph), jute(ph), which does not mean Jew, but \u2014\nalthough it\u2019s close to it. A teacher approached too late, now we weren\u2019t allowed to fight\neven \u2014 even in the park. And he came right to it, he says, what is this fighting, why are\nyou fighting? I said, well he c \u2014 he called me juditsich(ph) and challenged me to a fight,\nI am fighting. So the teacher addressed the other boy and says, now that\u2019s not nice. You\nshouldn\u2019t say a thing like that. Now I want you to stop fighting and you both go home\nand that\u2019s the end of it. And that\u2019s how it was settled. So I came out the victor. The word\napparently spread and I never had any problems after that.\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "Q: What was your relationship with your parents? Di \u2014 were you very close to them, were\nyou dependent upon them?",
        "A: I was very close to my mother. My father was a rather \u2014 well, distant figure. He was\non the road all week. He was a quiet man, introspective. And so we \u2014 and nearsighted, so\nhe was limited in anything we did. Sunday \u2014 well, the routine, Sundays we would go for\nthe traditional Sunday afternoon Spaziergang in the woods, whatever. Sometimes we\nwould go on a boat ride on the river. But after 19 \u2014 let\u2019s say, well, after the Nuremberg\nlaws of 1935, which was the first really restrictive, official restrictive, then I think that\nstopped. We could have gone \u2014 I mean, we went walking, but we no longer would go,\nlet\u2019s say, using this excursion boat, which one of our neighbors \u2014 we lived right on the\nriver, a-and they were a family of fishermen who also owned a little excursion steamer\nmotorboat. So we no longer went. That was part of not raising any awareness and we\nreally \u2014 and apparently we did it successfully in our town, because there was no open\nanti-Semitism that I was aware of. Others in town complained about anti-Semitism, only\n\u2014 you know, somebody would say something, was either as a matter of competition or\nneighbors who didn\u2019t like the n\u2014 the Jews next to them for one reason or another. But\nthere really was very little and it \u2014 we used to almost brag about it, you know, to other\nJewish families, that we had no richiss(ph) \u2014 there was no anti-Semitism \u2014 open anti-\nSemitism in our town Nobody was ever beaten up, intimidated or you know, I mean \u2014\nand you could \u2014 anything could \u2014 could happen. Like a Hitler youth would see a Jewish\nMarch 16, 2001\nman coming down the street and bump into him, you know, why don\u2019t you watch where\nyou\u2019re going, or you know, walk in the gutter, or you know, make anti-Semitic remark\nand of course you couldn\u2019t do anything about it. But that never happened. It happened in\nother cities that we know. Whether it would, you know, intimidate or even challenge you\nor we didn\u2019t have any of that.",
        "Q: Le-Let\u2019s talk now about 1933 and Hitler coming into power. What was your first\nknowledge of him, your first awareness as a child, of Hitler.",
        "A: Well, I was really aware of parties because in school some kids \u2014 this was \u2014 this goes\nback I would think to 1931 \u2014 \u201932. Kids I think everywhere, take sides. You have a\nfavorite \u2014 well, sports idol and you have a political party of your choice. So kids would\nask you, so what are you? And I wa \u2014 I would say, I\u2019m SPD \u2014 SPD riz \u2014 there was this\nSocial Democratic party. What are you? I\u2019m NSDRP, it\u2019s a Nazi party, meaning they\nwere what their parents were, right? I mean it \u2014 not hard to figure. The kids \u2014 children\ndon\u2019t have opinions, they have the opinions of their parents. So that was reflected. So I\nwent SPD and I remember we had a \u2014 what do we call it, Jahrmakt, a \u2014 a \u2014 a fair, a\ncountry fa-fi-fair, twice a year, in the spring and in the fall. And you go there and you \u2014\nyou know, and you \u2014 you had the stands and I bought a \u2014 as a matter of identification, the\nsymbol of s \u2014 the SPD was three arrows. So I bought \u2014 I spent five cents and bought a pin\nso that I could have an identity. And I came home with that, and my mother says, what do\nyou have? I said, aren\u2019t we SPD? And my mother said yes, but I think it\u2019s better if you\nMarch 16, 2001\ndon\u2019t wear that, because you can be something and you don\u2019t have to advertise it,\nbecause if somebody who sees and doesn\u2019t like it, you may get into an argument or a\nfight and you know the Nazis of course \u2014 well, the Nazi kids, they would stick together\nand the SPD kids would stick together. So these were little clubs. So I was aware of\npolitical things. I remember well in the \u2014 in the paper that there were street fights in\nHamburg which was, of course, Hamburg was largely red, predominantly communist,\nbecause was a harbor city and of course everybody read about you know, the \u2014 what\nhappened \u2014 what went on in Munich and in Berlin where the Nazis would ride around in\ntrucks, have a demonstration and the communists would come and break it up and vice-a-\nversa. And they would let \u2014 and the SA, these storm \u2014 the SR then was the predominant\npower, the brown shirts and brown pants. The SS was not yet very predominant then. So\nSR would go around and these were bruisers. They were people who liked to fight. They\nwere, you know, bouncers, they were bru \u2014 they would go out \u2014 they joined the party so\nthey could get into a good fight just like people here go out on Saturday night, hey, let\u2019s\ngo to a bar where we can have some action. Same mentality. So I was aware of that as a\nchild, but there was a \u2014 you know, of course, a sobering effect from the home to say don\u2019t\nget involved and we have to, as Jews, be \u2014 lay low and you know, don\u2019t make waves.",
        "Q: And when were you aware of Hitler himself for the first time?",
        "A: Oh, before \u2014 before 1933 already. I mean, I was seven, eight years old, I knew Hitler\nwas in the limelight and I remember very distinctly the \u2014 about the putsch, the\nMarch 16, 2001\nReichstagsbrand, the torching of the Reichstag right after he was elected and acor \u2014 of \u2014\nof course the power grab on January 30\", 1933, everybody was aware of that.",
        "Q: Were you very frightened? Was this something you talked over with your parents?\nWas he a frightening figure to you at that point?",
        "A: No, no he wasn\u2019t. He was far away, he was in Berlin, that was \u2014 what I do remember\nis \u2014 I mean, parents were careful \u2014 not my parents, I think most parents at the time, not to\ndiscuss anything upsetting in front of the children. So there were no political discussions,\nbut we knew that in the Jewish \u2014 within the Jewish community \u2014 I mean, we had friends,\nJewish friends and the families would get together, usually on Saturday night. There were\n\u2014 well, about four or five or six families that sort of were the nucleus and there were card\ngames, Skat and you need four players. So there were four families that got together and\nit alternated at somebody\u2019s house, and that was the highlight of the social life was the\ncard games and the women would sit and talk and the mother would entertain, I mean,\nwith food and coffee and cake and all that and the men played cards and smoked cigars\nand \u2014",
        "Q: A-And if you were around, they wouldn\u2019t talk in front of you all.",
        "A: Yes, they did, but we children, we were allowed to say hello and you know, then off to\nbed, and that\u2019s the way it was, you know. And that \u2014 I mean, I don\u2019t know any \u2014 any\nother way and of course my brother and I \u2014 yeah, that \u2014 that was \u2014 that was about 8:30 \u2014\nnine o\u2019clock and it was time to go to bed anyway.\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "Q: For a young boy to see people in uniforms, what does \u2014 what did that mean to you?\nWas it a frightening sight or did you think it looked wonderful, with these boots and these\nuniforms?",
        "A: N \u2014 it was neither frightening \u2014 it wasn\u2019t intimidating. Well, if you saw a Nazi in the\nboots, you knew that he was a Nazi, and he was strutting it, but I was never, never afraid\nof them, because then we didn\u2019t have any reason to be afraid. I do, of course, remember\ndistinctly April 1*, 1933 was the day of \u2014 oh, what was it? What do we \u2014 what do you \u2014\nwhat do we call that? A boycott.",
        "Q: I was going to say, did you mean the boycott?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Was a boycott and we had a store, storefront and there were two SA Stormtroopers to\nthe left and right of the entrance, standing, you know, like this, la \u2014 not at attention, but at\n\u2014 Wi-wi \u2014 we\u2019d Say in our army, at parade rest, okay? And if somebody would wa \u2014 even\nif they wo \u2014 just walked by, kauft nicht bei Juden. Don\u2019t buy from the Jews. And I\nthink they had also, with white paint drawn a swastika on our \u2014 on our store windows. I\ncame from \u2014 I went to school as every other day, and I came home at one o\u2019clock, I mean\nwas \u2014 school was only til one o\u2019clock, from eight in the morning til one, and I was then in\nthird grade. I came to the store, cause that\u2019s where my mother was, we already \u2014 we no\nlonger had a maid. Before that we had, you know, when we were smaller we \u2014 we had a\nMarch 16, 2001\nmaid and the maid was al \u2014 I think already gone by then. And I walked in \u2014 of course\nthey looked at me and they knew where I belonged. And then a woman came in to buy \u2014\nwell, a woman came in, a customer, but a woman that we hadn\u2019t seen before. And in a\ntown of 30,000, your customers were repeat customers, people who came in to buy from\nus. And she said, this 1s terrible, what is going on. I really don\u2019t want to buy anything, but\nI just had to come in \u2014 into your store, she told my mother, to \u2014 you know, because I \u2014\nthis is \u2014 this 1s a terrible thing what they are doing. Was a demonstration of \u2014 you know,\nof solidarity. And she didn\u2019t buy anything, which was all right. And she stayed in the\nstore a few minutes and then she went out again. So there were people like that. There\nwas no business that day, but we kept the store open, of course, and after that. But 1t was\na struggle, you know, the business was getting less and less.",
        "Q: Tell me again, as a nine year old, you see these two people standing there in front of\nyour father\u2019s store. Do you have any recollection what your thoughts were, your feelings\nwere when you saw this, and the s \u2014 the white paint?",
        "A: Well, I \u2014 no, I b \u2014 I knew they were there, they were \u2014 they happened to \u2014 there were\nthree Jewish stores on that street, a shoe store sort of diagonally across the street and\nanother one, a soft goods store as \u2014 as we had up on the corner. And they were \u2014 they\nwere standing there, I knew all the Jewish stores, there were six \u2014 seven Jewish\nbusinesses in town, and they were standing in front \u2014 1-in front of all of them and it didn\u2019t\nMarch 16, 2001\n\u2014I had no \u2014I wasn\u2019t frightened, I wasn\u2019t \u2014 they were there and I made no more of it, I\nknew why they were there. Okay.",
        "Q: And you accepted it?",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah.",
        "Q: And had you heard about any \u2014 the book burning? Did your parents talk about or had\nthey heard about book burning?",
        "A: The book burnings were later. That was, I would think about 1936 or thereabouts.",
        "Q: There were some earlier.",
        "A: There were some earlier? Not in our town, no.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: No, there were no demonstrations of that kind or \u2014 as I say, it was pretty low level of\nopen anti-Semitism.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 before kri \u2014 we\u2019 ll get to Kristallnacht in a moment, but before that, did you\ntalk about what was happening with your other contemporary friends, children your age?\nDid \u2014 was that something you would talk about when you were together?",
        "A: There were only about \u2014 well, there were four Jewish families who had children our\nage. But the me \u2014 s \u2014 there was really only one family, the one down the block, the Wolf\nfamily, with whom we were friendly, our parents played cards together, and they had\nthree children. The boy was a year younger than I, the girl was a year younger than\nHarry and a third, she was two years younger than I, so they were all about our age, and\nMarch 16, 2001\nthey were sort of our only playmates after \u201933 or \u201934. There was another family,\nShule(ph) who had a boy and a girl, but we didn\u2019t socialize with them. Well, again, it\nwas part of the \u2014 well, Jewish \u2014 German Jewish society. The man had a \u2014 he was a rag\ndealer. Well, he \u2014 he had the local recycling center. He dealt in \u2014 what do we call that?\nYou got five minutes. Used, you know, iron, metals and rags and all that and I\u2019m sure \u2014\nI\u2019m \u2014 he made a living, but 1t wasn\u2019t on the same level as our \u2014 you know, our parents,\nwho were tradesmen and had a \u2014 you know, business owned \u2014 store owners. So there was\na social level that you didn\u2019t really \u2014 they were decent people and we respect them and\nwe were in, of course, 1n Hebrew school together. We had Hebrew school, and III tell\nyou about that. It was part of our social structure. But the \u2014 the s-social intercourse, you\nknow, I mean we \u2014 we never played with those kids. They also lived further away and we\njust \u2014 we just didn\u2019t, because our parents didn\u2019t get together. But you saw each other\nduring the high holidays in shul and of course we saw the kids during Hebrew school.",
        "Q: Tell me about the Hebrew school.",
        "A: Well, th \u2014 our teacher, Hal Lotheim was his name, I-o-t-h-e-i-m. He was a retired\nschoolteacher, on had \u2014 so he had a pension. And I don\u2019t know what the congregation\npaid him for being the cantor and \u2014 but he had free room and board in the apartment in \u2014\nabove a \u2014 in \u2014 at the synagogue. And the building, the congregation\u2019s building were two\nhouses adjoining and the main building was the entrance to the synagogue and right\nadjacent to that in the f \u2014 facing the street was the ca \u2014 the one room classroom, and there\nMarch 16, 2001\nwas a little storage room behind that. And we went to Hebrew school Sunday mornings\nand Wednesday afternoon. Why Wednesday afternoon? Wednesday was Hitler youth\nday. All German children who belonged to the Hitler youth, and there was, of course, a\nlot of pressure that everybody should join and almost had to join, whether they liked it or\nnot, you had to belong. And if you didn\u2019t, the parents were pressurized because Hitler\nwanted the youth. He didn\u2019t much care about the parents, but there was a lot of pressure,\nand I know because there were many \u2014 were people who really were not Nazis and\ndisagreed with the whole thing, and pressure was put on them for the boys to join the\nHitler youth, or the Jungvolk, which is the children from six to 10. You had to be 10 to\ngo into the Hitler youth, the hiyot(ph) HJ, Hitler youth. Bel \u2014 below that, you were the\nJungvolk, that is the young \u2014 the young people. They \u2014 and they then had meeting \u2014 no,\nI\u2019m sorry, I guess you had to be 14 for the Hitler youth and up to 14 was the Jungvolk.\nSo all my classmates, or most of my classmates then would go on Wednesday afternoon,\nthey had to put on their you \u2014 Hitler uniform. When you attended, you had to appear in\nuniform. And of course, we didn\u2019t have a uniform. I would have liked to have a uniform.\nThat was because we played war games. You played \u2014 well, we played cops and robbers,\nor you played cowboy and Indians, or you \u2014 you know? Or you played soldiers, you\nknow. The bad guys were the French and the good guys were the German soldiers. So\nthese were the war games you played. I guess all little boys do that. And so \u2014 well, but I\nhad no regrets that I didn\u2019t have a uniform per se. As a matter of fact, the corduroy short\nMarch 16, 2001\npants and the belt with a belt buckle and all that, which some boys would wear even\nwhen \u2014 you know, their uniform pants, even when they weren\u2019t in uniform, with the shirt\nand all that. We made su \u2014 my mother made sure that we never wore anything that would\nimply that we wanted to, or that we belonged and you know \u2014 of course, somebody\nwould say hey, what are you doing with those pants, you know. You are not entitled to\nwear these pants. But well, today I guess it\u2019s Nike\u2019s. Nothing has changed.",
        "Q: Tell me about your Bar Mitzvah, did you have one?",
        "A: Yes, I had a Bar Mitzvah, my brother had a Bar Mitzvah and you prepared for oh, a\nyear, year and a half, whatever and Hal Lotheim taught us and w-well, it became my\nbam \u2014 ma-ma \u2014 my brother\u2019s Bar Mitzvah in 1935.",
        "Q: Was there any problem having it?",
        "A: No, what should be the problem? I mean, we had the service, we had some relatives\ncome from out of town and we got a minyan together and everybody was very happy that\nthere was another minyan man now. So Bar Mitzvahs were looked forward to in the\ncommunity as a \u2014 it was \u2014 my Bar Mitzvah was May \u2014 on May 1\u201c, 1937. And our \u2014 we\nhad a nice dinner at home after that, and I said the table prayer, you know, tish\nkabaid(ph) afterwards and made Kiddush, and of course, in \u2014 1n synagogue, I \u2014 I read the\nTorah and you know, it was very traditional.",
        "Q: Were you proud of being a Jew?",
        "A: Yes, I mean I \u2014 well, proud.\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "Q: Or were you ang \u2014",
        "A: [indecipherable]",
        "Q: \u2014 or \u2014 or were you angry that you were a Jew because you had these problems?",
        "A: No, we weren\u2019t proud to be Jews. We were \u2014 we were content to be Jews. I think we\nwere \u2014 proud, I think is the wrong thing. We \u2014 I think \u2014 no, you\u2019re born into being a Jew,\nyou have no choice, but we didn\u2019t repudiate it as some did. I mean, obviously, you know,\npeople who didn\u2019t want to be identified as Jews, or who converted to Christianity\nobviously \u2014 and you could do that. There was one family, a woman with two daughters, I\ndon\u2019t know where the husband was, whether he died or whatever, and she thought it\nwould be easier for her and her daughters and they converted. They converted to\nChristianity. Turned out of course that subsequently didn\u2019t do them any good anyway,\nright? But that was not unusual, I mean that \u2014 this was part of the assimilation mentality\nand attempt to become equal. I mean, look \u2014 1-1-1f \u2014 if you look \u2014 you know, in history,\nyou know, there \u2014 there were many people who converted and still remained Jews \u2014 you\nknow, I mean, in the eyes of the world.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nMarch 16, 2001\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview\nwith Kurt Roberg. This is tape number two, side A. And were you aware of Hitler\u2019s\nmarch into Vienna?",
        "A: Yes. \u2019m a history buff and I \u2014 since I grew up in Celle with history, which wa \u2014 it\u2019s\nreally also the cradle of the present British monarchy, so the \u2014 the house of Hanover\noriginated in Celle. And at an early a \u2014 in school from, I guess about six or seven years,\nwe learned about the history of Celle and then the district and then the province and so I\n\u2014 I\u2019ve been interested. I grew up with history and been interested in history, and of course\nI was aware of the annexation of Austria, the so-called being invited in, and Hitler\u2019s\ntriumphant march and that v \u2014 you know, Vienna. Of course, Hitler coming from\nAustria and many Germans didn\u2019t accept him because he was not a German, he was an\nAustrian. He tried very hard to be German, but we Germans knew that he wasn\u2019t German.",
        "Q: Seeing pictures of him coming into Austria, again, to a young child, is that\nfrightening?",
        "A: No, wasn\u2019t frightening, it was a \u2014 you know, w-we \u2014 we saw it in the newsreels, there\nwas no other exposure \u2014 in the newsreels and we knew it was propaganda and it was \u2014 as\na matter of fact, well, din \u2014 one was \u2014 Hitler was everywhere. Of course it was \u2014 there\nwas \u2014 by then, every classroom had a picture of Hitler hanging in the front, that was\nordained. There wa \u2014 yeah, there was th-th-the \u2014 that came from \u2014 from the top. So there\nMarch 16, 2001\nwas a \u2014 there was a systematic indoctrination of the fuehrer being \u2014 he wasn\u2019t referred to\nas Hitler any more, he was der fuehrer, and he \u2014",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 did you have to salute the picture?",
        "A: No, not only I didn\u2019t have to, I wasn\u2019t allowed to. Jews were not allowed to give the\nNazi salute. They were \u2014 as a matter of fact, if there was a \u2014 an assembly in the \u2014 in the\nschoolyard, for instance, then everybody, you know, had to sieg heil, Jews were not\nallowed to. That was a \u2014 they \u2014 it was a privilege to give the \u2014 the \u2014 so Jews were not\npermitted to, that would have been sacrilegious. That\u2019s how they made the \u2014 the \u2014 you\nknow, Hitler salute. Nor did I want to. So when the national anthem was sung, I had to\nattend. I stood there, I didn\u2019t sing the Horst-Wessel-Lied, you know. And the only thing\nthat I remember is if they would sing, there were \u2014 there were certain \u2014 there were certain\nsongs that, you know boys \u2014 and that was a form of intimidation, of course. Like, guys\nwould \u2014 would pass by on their bicycle and they\u2019d see a Jew and they\u2019d sing a song,\nWenn das Judenblut vom Messer spritzt. When the Jews blood will \u2014 will squirt from\nthe knife, okay, that was \u2014 etcetera. They would, you know, intimid \u2014 form of\nintimidation, of teasing, of intimidating, okay? But there was never any \u2014 any physical\nintimidation, okay, but [indecipherable]. Young people, primarily boys, they feel their\noats and they are together, that\u2019s what they do, right? They let it out in one form another.\nAnd there was \u2014 there were the Jews, the minority that you could let it out on if you\nMarch 16, 2001\nwanted to without, you know, without any reprimand. Au contraire, it was a mitzvah for\nthem, you know?",
        "Q: Would you come home and talk this over with your parents?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, but if \u2014 if something hap \u2014 if something happened that shouldn\u2019t\nhappen, I wou \u2014 I would tell my mother, yes. Oh, of course, and she was good counselor\nand had a good head, and you know \u2014",
        "Q: What kinds of things would she advise you to do?",
        "A: Well, usually to keep cool, but I really can\u2019t think of any \u2014 any incident other than the\nfight that I had, to you know \u2014 there was \u2014 we didn\u2019t give our parents any reason. We\nwere \u2014 we were cautious, we were careful, we didn\u2019t make waves, we were, by and well\n\u2014 you know, well liked, well respected in the neighborhood, where are \u2014 all our neighbors\nwere decent. Those that were \u2014 that we knew were Nazis, we \u2014 we didn\u2019t tangle. W-We \u2014\nwe went out of their way, you know, we didn't \u2014 you didn\u2019t make eye contact with them,\nyou didn't give them any reason to \u2014 you know, we didn\u2019t give them the opportunity to be\nnasty to us. You went out of their way.",
        "Q: So you felt safe? You felt safe in your neighborhood?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: When you saw a swastika, did that elicit any feelings inside of you?",
        "A: Yeah, I didn't like it. I mean th \u2014 I \u2014 well, I was more w \u2014 of course you grow up with\nit and you see it and the swastikas everywhere, it was just another \u2014 it sort of made your\nMarch 16, 2001\nheart go a little faster, but you got used to it. When I later had to return to Germany from\nHolland \u2014 you know, I went to Holland after, and then I came back, that really hit me\nlike a sledgehammer, that I was back under the heel of the Nazi regime.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll get to that, we\u2019ll get to that. So you were s \u2014 you were able to stay in\nschool until Kristallnacht?",
        "A: Yes. My brother left school, he was 14 in 1936 and my mother\u2019s brother lived in\nHolland, he had become a Dutch citizen. He left Germany right after World War I, he\nwas in procurement in \u2014 in grains. And as you know, ger \u2014 Holland was neutral during\nWorld War I, and he had built up some very good relations with Dutch grain suppliers for\nthe army. He was in Berlin, in procurement. And he had learned the grain trade, grain\nbusiness, as a young man. And as soon as the war was over, he left Germany, he went to\nHolland, never ret \u2014 well, he returned to visit his mother, etcetera, but he established his\nbusiness and residence in Holland, became a Dutch citizen and he ended up saving the\nfamily. In 1936 he took my brother to Holland. My uncle was not married, bachelor, but\nhe was also the \u2014 well, he \u2014 there were five sisters and one brother, so he was the\nmatriarch \u2014 patriarch. Sorry, patriarch. My grandmother, his mother, died in 1931, and\nthat was the last time he was in Germany. Yeah, but [indecipherable] of course he\nwould come before that, come and visit, but he didn\u2019t think well of Germany, but he also\nwas interesting. The things that we told him later about what \u2014 what was going on in\nGermany, you know, the Hitler \u2014 the me \u2014 the mentality of what was going on, what\nMarch 16, 2001\nHitler did with the Jews. He was assimilated, I mean, he did not we \u2014 observe the high\nholidays, but he was not a practicing Jew, per se. He thought that we were really\noveremphasizing, that we were panicky, just like the rest of the world did not really\nbelieve that this was happening, and they \u2014 me -- said me \u2014 ma, he says, Jiidische\ngroil(ph) propaganda, if you understand that. That\u2019s Jewish prop \u2014 you know, he \u2014 he\ndidn\u2019t think that this was happening, that people panicked or saw things too Jewish. And\nunfortunately he found out after the invasion of Holland that it was real.",
        "Q: Wa-Was it hard for you to say goodbye to your brother?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t hard, it was a fact of life. Harry left. I mean, he went, you know, to go to\nschool in Holland and learn \u2014 when we \u2014 he went to a trade school, learned a trade. Now\nat this time, 1936, to go back to what you asked about Zionism, we did have classes twice\na week on Wednesdays. I sort of got away from that, but the Hitler youth \u2014 on\nWednesday afternoon we had Hebrew school, and in 1933, lot \u2014 Lotheim and \u2014 sorry,\nLotheim and \u2014 Mr. and Mrs. Lotheim went to Palestine and came back as ardent\nZionists. They were impressed with what was being done there and from there on he\nreally said, well we have to \u2014 we have to support Palestine, Zionism is our solution. And\nwe listened. Of course, we all subscribed to a Jewish paper out of Berlin called\n\u2018\u201cJiidische Rundschau,\u201d which is Jewish \u2014 well, was a Jewish weekly. And they had a\nchildren\u2019s section and it was Zionist oriented and told the Jewish community that they\nhad to A, support Palestine and B, prepare for leaving Germany, that it was prudent to\nMarch 16, 2001\nlearn to \u2014 a trade \u2014 for young people to learn a trade for HaSharat(ph) rather than what\nwas the trend before, an academic life. Jews in Germany, by and large wanted to get\naway being shopkeepers and the trend was to go into academic life, doctors, lawyers,\nwhatever. And that\u2019s \u2014 we were the first ones to go to a school of higher education in my\nfamily. My br \u2014 both my brother and I went to the \u2014 you know, gymnasium. And of\ncourse that was interrupted by Hitler, so Harry went to Holland to learn a trade and we\nhad no plans of where to go or what to do. My father was very reluctant to \u2014 he was 50,\nborn in 1884, so he was hesitant to go to a country. Knew some English, learned French\nin school, but that was it. Where do you go, what do you do? He wasn\u2019t too successful in\nGermany, how successful would he be in a foreign country? And so that was \u2014 you\nasked me did I find it hard to say goodbye? Well, I was on my own now, my playmate\nwas gone, you know, my confidant. Harry and I were very close as, you know, boys. But\nI adjusted to that and I knew it was a necessity and I lived with it, I accepted it.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s move forward to Kristallnacht. How did that begin for you?",
        "A: Well, let me \u2014 let precede that. In the summer of \u201938, I was 14. I went to visit my aunt\nin Byetahl(ph), my mother\u2019s home village, as I did every summer for the big vacation,\nfour weeks vacation.",
        "Q: Her name? Your aunt\u2019s name?",
        "A: My aunt\u2019s name was Babette(ph). And Aunt Babette was single. She was \u2014 well,\nphysically handicapped. She had an ac \u2014 bad accident as a child and had \u2014 one leg was\nMarch 16, 2001\nshorter than the other, so she wasn't married, she stayed home with her mother. When\nGrandma died in 1931, she of course continued to live in the f \u2014 family house that had\nbeen there since 1830. And this was my last \u2014 well, visit with her. During that time, in\nAugust, of course, you know that every year the Nazis in August had the\nNuremberger(ph) Parteitag, the party convention. And usually out of that came new\nlaws, new dogmas, new tightening. And again that was very significant, that things were\ntightening up and in August, mel \u2014 we had already closed our store in 1937. It n-no\nlonger paid. We moved \u2014 it so happened that our landlord, the owner of our house, it was\na three family house, we lived on the \u2014 they lived on the ground floor, the first floor was\na retired lawyer, he was a person that was working at the \u2014 the law \u2014 the supreme \u2014 there\nwere three Supreme Courts in Germany, one of them was in Celle. And he was \u2014 he had\nworked for the Supreme Court as a judge, but he was forced to resign in 1933, and Pll\ngive you that story separately. They lived on the second floor and we lived on the third\nfloor. The Zusskinds(ph) had given up their store about in 1928 or thereabouts and\nmoved some of the inventory into one of their rooms made a \u2014 yeah, and they permitted\nus to do the same. So, whatever inventory we had left, my father thought we could sell.\nWe moved into what was the living room and that became the office and the business and\nsome of his customers that were loyal to him and hi \u2014 prices were right, so rather than\nselling the inventory at, you know, 10 cents on the dollar as we had to do with the rest of\nit, we maintained that. So we no longer had a store since 1937. And in August 738, my\nMarch 16, 2001\nmother, when things were tightening up further, decided to take a trip to Hamburg and\nget three waiting numbers from the American consulate, because as you know there was\na waiting list and the list was about two years waiting. She said let \u2014 le \u2014 I \u2014 I want to get\nthe quota numbers in case we need them. And she also picked up three more for one of\nthe families that we were closest with, the Solomon \u2014 the young Solomons. There was an\nold family, the parents and the son; this was the son and his wife. And we \u2014 well, then\ncame November, of course, and we were all aware of the incident in Paris. What was his\nname?",
        "Q: Heinrich Grynszpan?",
        "A: Grynszpan. Hersh \u2014 Herschel \u2014",
        "Q: Herschel.",
        "A: \u2014 Herschel Grynszpan. It so happens that Herschel Grynszpan was from\nHannover, and I can tell you a story about that too, if you want to make a note, let me\nput that down. So we knew \u2014 and when he shot them, we knew there was going to be\ntrouble. And of course, the ninth of November was always a v \u2014 a day observed in\nGermany because it was when, in 1923, the first putsch and the whatever, so this was\nalways a solemn, commemorative day of the Nazi party, and that coincided. And so we\nwere keenly aware of what was happening, but of course, we didn't know what. Now, on\n\u2014 the ninth of November came and of course everybody kept a low profile, we didn't go\nout, whatever. Seven o\u2019clock in the morning our doorbell rang. We were upstairs, the\nMarch 16, 2001\nfront door was locked and so we looked out the window, who is it? Somebody from the\nWolf family who had the store down the street from where our store was. We lived not\nnear the store, we lived somewhere else. And, how are you? We are all right, why do you\nask? Don\u2019t you know? Nothing happened here? No, what happened? So they came up\nand told us that they still had their store and they lived above the store in the \u2014 1n the\nhouse, that the store was smashed, the store across the street, the shoe store, was sm \u2014 and\nthey also lived there. We were the only ones who had a separate \u2014 you know, residence\nbecause we rented the house and we rented the store. And they owned the buildings so\nlived above them. That \u2014 th \u2014 you know, they had totally smashed the store, that the\ngoods were lying all over the street. They went up into the attic and opened the \u2014 there\nwas a door because the attics were used also in the olden days \u2014 these were half timbered\nhouses from the 17\" century \u2014 to bring merchandise. So they opened the attic door and\nsaid, if they \u2014 if they come up here to get us, we\u2019ll jump. Well, they didn\u2019t find them in\nthe attic, they were just out to destroy the store. And so we knew what was going on in\ntown. And my father was home, and I was home and my mother. So what to do? So\nMother said \u2014 my mother was really running the family, my father was a very passive \u2014\nand at that point, you know, subdued individual. And \u2014",
        "Q: Was he subdued because of what \u2014",
        "A: Ah, the [indecipherable]",
        "Q: \u2014 of conditions changing?\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: Yes, conditions. Business was bad. You \u2014 I mean, you felt very inadequate. And \u2014 and\nreally, you know, was a matter of we didn\u2019t want to emigrate, what am I gonna do? I\ncan\u2019t see, you know, I can\u2019t hear, at least I have \u2014 I know my clientele, I have my\nfollowing. But we really didn\u2019t know what was gonna \u2014 you know, the \u2014 the Jewish\ncommunity said, this can\u2019t last, it has to get better, it can\u2019t get worse. What else can they\ndo\u2019? But they \u2014 you know, it progressed.",
        "Q: Did your parents have to take the middle names of Israel and Sarah?",
        "A: Not yet. That came la \u2014 that came \u2014 yeah, I think that was in 1938 as a matter of fact,\nwhen the \u2014 yes, I think that was \u2014 that came out of the Nuremberger(ph) laws of 1938. I\nthink there was one of the keys where my mother said, oh, it\u2019s another notch, you know,\nof tightening \u2014 tightening up and of intimidation. Yes, we did \u2014 she became Sarah and\nwe all became Kurt Walter Israel \u2014 I became isra \u2014 Kurt Walter Israel, my father\nVictor Israel, yes.",
        "Q: Did that bother you?",
        "A: Well, it was another significant thing because it was significant for us because Roberg\nwas not considered a Jewish name. It was never Rosenberg or anything like that. So\nRoberg was a German name. So it \u2014 yes, signified that we were Jews, even, you know,\nwherever you went. So Mother went to Hamburg and got waiting numbers. So now it is\nnov \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s November and she s \u2014 you know, we decided \u2014",
        "Q: This is the morning.\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: This is the morning, yes.",
        "Q: This is the morning after Crystal --",
        "A: And we just \u2014 we decide eight o\u2019clock. Now, I lived across \u2014 across from our school.\nOur garden backyard and the schoolyard were back to back. There was a little creek\nabout two yards across or less, in between. And \u2014 but my mother could look into my\nclassroom. It was maybe a hundred yards, or 120 yards across. And when we recited class\n\u2014 in class, you know, vocabulary or whatever with the windows open, she could hear us\nrecite. Okay, what\u2019s that [indecipherable]. So she said, I think you should \u2014 better go to\nschool. Go like any other day. If there is a problem, we had a whistle, with which we\nwere also summoned home if we were out in the street, Pll blow the whistle three times.\nSo I went to sc \u2014 class, and I must say my teacher, my homeroom teacher, Studienrat\nKlem(ph) was a fabulous guy who really supported me all the way. He was not a Nazi, I\nmean he was anything but. I must say the entire schoolyo \u2014 teachers\u2019 body, with one or\ntwo exceptions, were fabulous to me and very supportive. So he came into class and of\ncourse in those days, you know, ba \u2014 when the teacher came into class everybody had to\nstand up and heil Hitler, you know, they were \u2014 and he \u2014 he would just go, sit down. He\nhad to raise his hand, but it was like sit down, you know. He would never say heil Hitler,\ni-1t was \u2014 so he saw me and he called me \u2014 and of course when I came into class, my\nclassmates already looked at me like, what do you \u2014 what are you doing here? And I\nknew what had gone on at least, yeah, from the Wolfs. And of course there were students\nMarch 16, 2001\nwho came by train. They weren\u2019t local, they \u2014 they came from surrounding villages and\nwalking through town from the railroad station, they saw that the five remaining Jewish\nstores were smashed, and the word goes like wildfire. So everybody in class knew and\nthey looked at me, but nobody said anything. And he \u2014 the \u2014 Klem(ph) called me up and\nsaid, do you know what is going on in town? I said yes, I heard. He says, do you want to\nstay in school? I said yes, I\u2019d like to stay in school, school like any other day. He says\nokay, any time you want to go home, you can go. So I went, and the intermission was at\n10 o\u2019clock and I looked over to our house and everything was quiet. I could see our\nkitchen and bedroom windows from the schoolyard. And I went back into class and then\nat about a quarter to 11 or so, I heard my mother blow the whistle. So I asked Studienrat\nKlem(ph), I \u2014 may I go home? Yes, of course. And yeah, I did this very unobtrusive, I\nleft my books there. I just went out of the classroom like I went to the toilet, but I didn\u2019t\ncome back. I didn\u2019t want to make waves, you know, picking up my books and \u2014 and\ngoing out. I left my books and I just \u2014 like I went to the bathroom, but I went home.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape number two, side B. You were talking about how you left school after\nyour mother blew the whistle.",
        "A: She certainly did. So I\u2014 I went home and my mother told me that the Gestapo was\nthere \u2014 well, yeah, every town had a \u2014 th-the police, the city police, they was \u2014 they also\nMarch 16, 2001\nhad a couple of Gestapo agents who were whatever, that they \u2014 that part of the police\nwere there and took my father into protective custody, that was the term, schutzhaft,\nprotective custody. And they were at the police station and \u2014 and they asked her, don\u2019t\nyou have a son? And my mother says, my son is in school, where he should be. Oh.\nOkay. That was that. They didn\u2019t ask any further. And of course there were no phones,\nnobody \u2014 we di \u2014 yes, we did have a telephone, but we didn\u2019t dare use the phone because\nwe knew it was listened to or whatever. So one of our \u2014 the girl \u2014 the family under us,\nRusterveld, where the f \u2014 man was, you know, forced into retirement, he had a daughter,\nshe was a couple of years older than I, Alsa(ph) and she ran errands for us. And they\nwere violently anti-Nazi. She said, I don\u2019t want you to go out, I\u2019Il do some shopping for\nyou and you\u2019re not gonna stay in your apartment, you come and stay with us. And we\ndid. And then the word, you know, from other Jewish family, we \u2014 we \u2014 my \u2014 I think we\nfound out from the \u2014 through the grapevine that the men were leaving the police station\nand that they were being sent to Hamburg. And then the word came down that from\nHamburg they were sent to Berlin. And fr \u2014 in ber \u2014 from Berlin to concentration camp\nOranienburg, which was near Berlin. So we already were breathing a sigh of relief be \u2014\nthat they didn\u2019t go to Dachau. Dachau, near Munich had the worst reputation, that\nDachau was \u2014 was torture. The others were really just sort of like considered better grade\ndetention facilities, whatever, as far as we knew.",
        "Q: How did you, as a 14 year old know about Dachau?\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: Well you \u2014 you heard that people were put into concentration camps and \u2014 katset(ph),\nas it was referred to, for any infraction. Jews, I mean who \u2014 Jews who had sex with \u2014\nwith Gentile \u2014 with the Christian women, off into the concentration camp. For whatever \u2014\nwhatever reason, if you broke any of the laws, and that was the Nuremberger(ph) laws,\nwhere th-there was no, you know, wha-whatever. Cohabitation or \u2014 and we knew they\nwere concentration camps, everybody knew. Everybody knew they were concentration\ncamps, and what went on in them, and men \u2014 occasionally you heard of people \u2014 well,\nthat\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: What \u2014 what was your mother\u2019s emotional state of mind when your father was first\ntaken away, and yours?",
        "A: Well, when \u2014 we felt helpless, frustrated. We thought that\u2019s the end, you know, we \u2014\nwe didn\u2019t know. They said it\u2019s \u2014 well, only protective custody, but then they went to \u2014 we\ndidn\u2019t know. You really \u2014 and you don\u2019t \u2014 you don\u2019t think, you don\u2019t anticipate, you\ndon\u2019t know. You really don\u2019t know. I mean, you heard of people who came back, who\nwere released from concentration camps and you also heard from people where the\nfamilies had been notified they had a heart attack and was called \u2014 yeah, in German, heart\nattack is called herz schlag. And the \u2014 that \u2014 that used to \u2014 used to be called a schlag\naufs herz, which you know, play on words. I-Instead of a herz schlag you had a \u2014 okay.\nSo \u2014",
        "Q: Wer \u2014 were you frightened when your father was taken away\u201d?\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t there.",
        "Q: No, but when you came home and heard?",
        "A: When I \u2014 well, I was shocked. I mean, I was, you know, I was \u2014 yes, I mean it was\ncomplete upheaval of you know, you felt absolutely helpless. I guess \u2014 you know, you \u2014\nyou feel like no \u2014 I tell you, the only \u2014 the only thing I can compare it with 1s, have you\never been in a \u2014 either a hurricane or an earthquake, where you feel absolutely helpless?\nOkay, you \u2014 there\u2019s nothing you can do to try and save yourself or whatever. It\u2019s that\nkind of a feeling, that it\u2019s beyond your control. But we also \u2014 I mean, my mother was a\nvery rational individual and I think she kept her cool, and you know, maybe also for my\nconsideration she didn\u2019t go to pieces and she \u2014 well, she didn't \u2014 wouldn\u2019t serve any\npurpose, she wasn\u2019t that kind of an individual. Some people function best under pressure,\nas I do and which is a blessing. You know, other people react negatively. Well, we didn't.\nAnd well then, of course, what \u2014 can you do anything? We couldn\u2019t do anything other\nthan setting things in motion to get me out of the country. The only solution, of course,\nwas Holland. And no telephone calls, you would write. Everything was by mail, you\nknow. So my uncle agreed to take me in and started things rolling. Of course it wasn\u2019t\nthat easy in Holland either. Holland didn\u2019t want any Jews. Even Holland didn\u2019t \u2014 only if\n\u2014 you know, mm \u2014 so it took six weeks until I could get out from my \u2014",
        "Q: Di-Di-Did you go to school during that time? Did you go to school after your father\nwas taken away\u201d?\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: [indecipherable] No, I didn\u2019t, no. The - November 10\" was my last day in school.\nAfter that there was no \u2014 no more school for me or anybody else. I mean, it was a miracle\nthat I went to a non-Jewish school. See, the law by then had already changed, that\nwherever there were Jewish schools, that the Jews were no longer allowed to go to\nChristian schools, but there was nothing in Celle and I was the only Jew. Now the Wolf\nchildren, Herbert was already \u2014 he was goi \u2014 he was, I think in Hamburg or somewhere,\nthey had put him into a Jewish school in Hamburg. So their children were already out of\ntheir local schools. I was really the only Jew in the German school system there.",
        "Q: You were talking about six weeks to get to be able to go to Holland.",
        "A: No, my father \u2014 my father \u2014 this is, I think, significant. On December 17\", my father\ncame back. We didn't know, we had no word that I know of, until he walked in. I don\u2019t\nknow, I don\u2019t remember whether he phoned or whatever. I doubt it. We weren\u2019t a\ntelephone oriented and we couldn\u2019t trust the telephone. My father was released on\nDecember 16\" from Oranienburg together with Hans Solomon, who was this \u2014 the\nyounger man, the family that we were friendly with. Of course, all the German \u2014 th-the\nJews from Celle were sent to the same camp, Oranienburg. And I think Lotheim had\nalready been released a week earlier, but I couldn\u2019t be sure, because he was \u2014 he was in\nhis 70\u2019s. Hans and my father came out, as I say, on the 16\". They were just discharged\nand Hans was a \u2014 in his early 30\u2019s then, he was very inventive, he\u2019s a sharp guy. And my\nfather, you know, was nearly blind, so they took the old \u2014 the hat that \u2014 that they were\nMarch 16, 2001\ngetting in \u2014 giving \u2014 all their clothes had been disinfected and just rolled in a ball, they\nwere crumpled and smelled from this disinfectant, I can smell it today. And they \u2014 he\nwent to the railroad station and took his hat and went begging, you know, with a blind\nman, you know, here\u2019s a blind man, please give the blind \u2014 and they got enough money\ntogether from Germans to go from Oranienburg to Berlin, and Hans\u2019s sister-in-law\nlived in Berlin. They went to the sister-in-law, her husband had of course also been taken\nbut she was at home, and he bought enough money for the railroad fair for the two of\nthem to come back to Celle. And then they walked in and I remember my father coming\nin, his \u2014 well, he didn\u2019t have much hair, but the head was completely shaved and this\nhorrible smell of the disinfectant. And his body smelled from \u2014 you know, the only food\nthat they got was \u2014 apparently the Germans took whale blubber and cooked that into a\nstew and that\u2019s what they got to eat, that and some potatoes. And most people couldn\u2019t\neat it. Hans ate it, and whoever didn\u2019t want to, couldn\u2019t stomach this stuff. It smelled fa \u2014\nand my father e-exuded this smell of whale blubber oil type. I mean, incred \u2014 I \u2014I\u2014I can\nsmell it just thinking about it. And Hans was the only guy in the whole Oranienburg\ncamp who gained weight, because he ate everybody el \u2014 what everybody else could \u2014 he\nwas that kind of a guy. And then my father sat down and he cried. I had never seen my\nfather cry, and he related the tortures that they had gone through. They had to stand at\nattention, now this was December, to stand at attention for six hours and if somebody\ndropped they weren\u2019t allowed to help them. And just, you know, the bunks, that was\nMarch 16, 2001\nwhere they slept over there, wer \u2014 where they \u2014 and how they were well, humiliated and\nsomebody broke an infraction, everybody \u2014 everybody out to witness how they were put\naufbuch(ph) that was \u2014 it was a\u2014 a wooden whatever, gadget, where they were strung\nup, I guess, spread eagle and whipped 25 lashes in front of everybody. Or 50, whatever \u2014\nwhatever the leader of \u2014 you know, and people were dropping and collapsing and\nwatching that. And I guess luckily my father couldn\u2019t see too much. He wa \u2014 he \u2014 they\nhad taken his glasses away from him, he was like a blind man. He didn\u2019t see it, but he\nheard it, of course. And he would \u2014 he would tal \u2014 and he never talked about anything,\nbut he was talking about it, and who could listen to that? And he\u2019d break down and cry.\nAnd I left then, a week later, on the twe \u2014 December 24\", I left for Holland. Now here\u2019s\nagain a little well, incidence of the spirit that we had. When you left Germany of course,\nyou weren\u2019t allowed to take any valuables with you, anything that was called der\nwiesen(ph), de wiesen(ph) is what the Germans \u2014 what you consider either cash or\nanything that is of international value that can be translated into money afterwards. And\nof course, jewelry was already \u2014 I think there was also in August \u201938 that Jews had to\nturn 1n all their gold, they weren\u2019t allowed to have any jewelry other than their wedding\nrings. And well, what do you do with that? Yeah, how di\u2014 ho-how \u2014 do you keep your\ndiamonds, do you keep, if you have any, you know, decision. And then if the house was\nsearched and the \u2014 they find anything, you\u2019d be \u2014 everything would taken, you \u2014 they\ncould do whatever they wanted to. You were \u2014 you had broken an existing law, whatever.\nMarch 16, 2001\nSo \u2014 but I think my mother kept her \u2014 her diamond ring or whatever. Bril \u2014 brilliant ring,\nthat was. And some family jewels that we didn\u2019t turn in, had it \u2014 had been in the family\nfor a couple of generations, we refused to turn in. See, you took the chances on that, you\ndefied \u2014 you defied the orders and you tried to hide it or get it out, or whatever.",
        "Q: During the six weeks from the time that your father came home to until you left, did\nhe gain his strength back?",
        "A: Well, he \u2014 no, he didn\u2019t. I mean, he was only home a week. Yeah, I saw him only for a\nweek because he came back on December 16\" and I left on the 24\". But now I had to \u2014 I\nhad a stamp collection, which was a \u2014 you know, I collected stamps. Uncle Wilhelm\nfrom Holland was in international business, he would send me stamps, I collected, I had\na \u2014 I had a German album. I had a nice collection.",
        "Q: Your \u2014 your uncle\u2019s name was what?",
        "A: Wil \u2014 Wilhelm Marx. Wilhelm in Dutch. So I \u2014 so that I would not have to open my\nsuitcase at the Dutch border, you could have it examined locally, you would ta \u2014 you\ncould take it to the finance amt, the \u2014 the \u2014 the tax hall, or whatever, tax inspector and\nthey also were responsible for customs, and have it inspected and sealed there, and that\nseal then, you could take it acro \u2014 so my mother didn\u2019t want me to have to unpack my\nstuff, open it up at two o\u2019clock in the morning when I was at the Dutch border. So I put\nmy suitcase on my bicycle, took my bicycle over there and I went by myself. My mother\ndid not go with me. I went by myself, 14 years old. We grew up, we had to be\nMarch 16, 2001\nindependent, we had to be self sufficient and we learned \u2014 I mean, we had no childhood,\nwe were \u2014 we were young adults. I mean, we were \u2014 there was no time for childhood. So,\nthey looked at the stuff, everything, your \u2014 all the clothes that you took out, nothing could\nbe new, everything had to be washed so that you couldn\u2019t resell it in a foreign country.\nEverything had to have a monogram and \u2014 or initials in \u2014 1n it, either sewn on or\nembroidered. Everything had to be identified as being your personal whatever. I took my\nstamp albums with me, and this a \u2014 one agent looked at it and he says, stamps? I don\u2019t\nthink you can take stamps. I knew that you couldn\u2019t take stamps, this was \u2014 because\nstamps was a wonderful way of transferring value out and selling it in the \u2014 you know,\nand turn it into money. I knew that. I said, what do you mean, I can\u2019t? And then the o \u2014\nanother agent came. He says, oh come on, he says, that\u2019s a \u2014 that\u2019s a student collection,\nlet him take the stamps. And inside \u2014 of course I didn\u2019t move a muscle, you know, but\ninside I know, boy I got here \u2014 I got one past them. I \u2014 and of course, I took my s \u2014 my\nstamps and I came to the border at one o\u2019clock in the morning and \u2014",
        "Q: Y-You said goodbye \u2014 so you didn\u2019t go back home? Did you \u2014",
        "A: Oh no, no \u2014 oh yes, I went back home and then I\u2019m \u2014 this was a couple of days before.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And then with the \u2014 with the suitcase with the seal on it and the rucksack with the\nstuff and \u2014 you know.",
        "Q: What was it like to say goodbye to your parents?\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: Well, I really don\u2019t remember. Tearful, I suppose. And my parents took me to the train\nstation. I don\u2019t even remember if my father went along, because he wasn\u2019t good for\nanything, he was just [indecipherable]. I \u2014 I think only my mother went with me. I think\nI said goodbye to my father at home and my mother took me to the train station, and I got\non the train to Rotterdam and at the border, the, you know, came, pass(ph) kontrolle,\nyou know, koffer auf machen. And I said ma \u2014 it had the \u2014 the suitcase has already been\ninspected and sealed. They looked at the seal, okay, can put it back up, and that was it,\nand inside I was laughing. And \u2014 well, then as I rolled through the Dutch countryside, it\nlooked awfully good, seeing the cows and you know, the \u2014 came \u2014 arrived in Rotterdam.\nOf course, my uncle met me at the train station and it was a whole new life. So now I was\nsafe in Holland and my mother, in the meantime \u2014 now, my father had been released\nfrom Oranienburg. He had to sign a waiver that \u2014 yeah, he had to sign a paper. Germans\nwere great at that, I\u2019m sure you know that, that he was not mistreated in any way and that\nhe would leave Germany within 90 days. At that point, of course, they only wanted to\nget rid of the Germans \u2014 oh, of the Jews, and you could even at that point still take your\nfurniture with you, anything that was personal belongings, so my \u2014 my mother had to do\neverything, she did everything, arranged for a \u2014 in Bremen, which was the other port,\nbesides Hamburg, to have a \u2014 well, today we would call it a container, was a\nliftbahn(ph). There was a huge box, room size was built and your furniture were put into\nit and everything was packed, so she prepared for that. And by March, March 15\" they\nMarch 16, 2001\nhad to leave because my father\u2019s 90 days were up, and my uncle managed to get them\ninto Holland because we had the American visa applications, he could prove to the\nDutch government that we were only in transit and that he would \u2014 he had to guarantee of\ncourse, that he \u2014 he would vou \u2014 that we wouldn\u2019t be a financial burden to the Dutch\ngovernment. The Dutch did a lot, more than most, but \u2014 they took children, but a-adults?\nNobody wanted the Jews. So in \u2014 you know, in transit we could stay then, and we \u2014 my\nparents rented a room to live in and we ate at my uncles, and it was a\u2014 I went to s \u2014 of\ncourse started going to school in Holland, went to a trade school and learned a trade and\non \u2014 then the American visa came up and my parents ni \u2014 the decision, the family\ndecision was to take \u2014 we had three numbers that my mother had gotten for my father, my\nmother and me. Harry was already in Holland. But the decision was made, since he was\nthe older one, he had already completed school, he was already, you know, an apprentice\nat a electri \u2014 electrician\u2019s job, to take him along to America because my father was unfit\nto work, he was emotionally, physically broken, he really never regained his health. The\nAmerican consulate was very kind and looked the other way and \u2014 and I mean, they\ncould be tough too, you know. As a matter of fact, the \u2014 when they were called \u2014 we were\ncalled to the American consulate for the examination, had to be a physical examination\ninterview before you got your American visa stamped into your passport. And we went\nalready a couple of weeks before and we listened in the \u2014 in the anteroom as people were\nreading the eye chart. First line, A, E, F, G, K. Line two, etcetera, and we wrote it down\nMarch 16, 2001\nand my father memorized it. And came time for him to examine, sat there and he started\nreciting it. I\u2019m sure, yeah, the examiner looked at his glasses, he must have known, yeah.\nNow, read this line again, my father \u2014 yeah, and he would point at the bottom line, and\nyou know. Anyway, he passed and they left with my brother.",
        "Q: Wa \u2014 why didn't your mother get four visas? Why did she just get three?",
        "A: Because she was thinking Harry is safe in Holland, you know? That\u2019s why. But we\ncould have \u2014 the American consul in \u2014 in Rotterdam said to my mother, why don\u2019t you\ntake your s \u2014 take Kurt with you also? Said well, we want him to finish school here, and\nUncle Wilhelm, who was in an international business, he was 1n contact with people all\nover the world, he was a grain merchant and he was convinced that Holland would\nremain neutral. I mean, don\u2019t forget, in the meantime the war had started, the Sitzkrieg as\nit was called. I don\u2019t know, you familiar with that term? The sitting war, where French\nand Germans were staring at each other across their fortification, the Maginot line and\nthe Siegfried line.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And, I mean, the war had started in August \u201939.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And so we were aware of what was going on, you know, but my uncle was convinced\nthat \u2014 that Holland would remain neutral, that the Germans would need Rotterdam as a\nwindow to the world, just as they did during World War I and so he convinced my\nMarch 16, 2001\nmother to let me stay in Holland and finish school. And it made business sense, you\ncome to America, I was still of school age, my father couldn\u2019t work, who is gonna\nsupport us, right?",
        "Q: What were your thoughts about that?",
        "A: Didn\u2019t matter. My thought \u2014 I mean, whatever the \u2014 whatever the decision was,\nchildren weren\u2019t asked in those days and I was \u2014 I was happy to stay with my uncle and\nfinish school and all. I thought it was best for me to finish school rather than starting to \u2014\nyou know, and I studied English, I was learning English, and to go to America as\nprepared as I could be rather than coming in there having no trade, not knowing your\nlanguage, etcetera. So it was \u2014 was a rational decision and we were \u2014 we were convinced\nthat Holland would stay neutral. So anyway \u2014 so there was the story. So they left on\nApril 5\u201c, 1940. While they were at sea, on April 10,1940, Germany invaded Norway\nand overran Denmark, and my mother was in panic.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nMarch 16, 2001\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Kurt Roberg. This is tape number three, side A. And your\nparents and brother are on the boat?",
        "A: Yes, it is April 5\", 1940, they \u2014 my parents have \u2014 and Harry have left for America\nand I guess it\u2019s April 10\" now and they have found out about the invasion of \u2014 by\nGermany of Norway and Denmark and my mother is panicked and up in arms and of\ncourse she wrote a letter on board which was posted in New York, air mail, via Lisbon\nto americ \u2014 to \u2014 to Holland and reached us, I guess, just before the invasion of the\nNetherlands by the Germans. And of course on May 10\", 1940, six o\u2019clock in the\nmorning, we woke up and I heard planes, and having lived in Celle, where we had two air\nbases nearby, I knew by sound all the German planes, and I woke up and I heard and I\nsaid to my uncle, Uncle Wilhelm, I said, those sound like Ju-52. That\u2019s the Junkers 52\ntransport plane that was used for parachute jumps. He says, you\u2019re crazy. Ah, I was right,\nand he wasn\u2019t. For once he was not right. And well, the invasion came. The Dutch, who\nthought that if they inundated the \u2014 you know, th-the \u2014 the land and they could stop the\nGermans, but the Germans came by parachute. They \u2014 we lived in Rotterdam, they came\ndown and \u2014 and the Dutch Marines held the Maas bridges for three days, didn\u2019t surrender\nthem to the Germans, and I as a German citizen, having a German passport, which\nincidentally was on the \u2014 in the \u2014 at the American consulate in Rotterdam, we \u2014 I was \u2014\nMarch 16, 2001\nthe Dutch police came, since I was registered as a German citizen living with my uncle in\nHolland. The fact that you are Jewish, well, didn\u2019t mean anything to the Dutch. You\nwere German or you were Dutch or you were whatever. And politically it didn\u2019t make\nany difference. I mean, the individual policeman could have been sympathetic and knew\nwhat a \u2014 that the German Jews were not \u2014 you know, in \u2014 were not sympathetic to the\nGerman government, but there were also a lot of other Germans living in Holland who\nmight have been, and there was a fifth column in Holland, wa \u2014 a Nazi party run by\nMussert. And the Mussert Nazis in Holland were a force and the \u2014 so we were interned\nand my uncle, of course, you can imagine how he felt. He had convinced my mother to\nlet me stay and, you know, go to school in Holland, and I was being interned, and now\nwe didn't know what was gonna happen. So they took us to all the other \u2014 I knew some of\nthe German refugees, Jewish refugees in Holland and we were all taken to a large\nmeeting hall, which was right next to the police headquarters and we were kept there.\nThey brought in mattresses, they put them down on the big dance floor in the dance hall\nand that was our temporary lodgings. And we were there for four days and then on May\n14\" at noon \u2014 we were kept informed of what was happening, now there was \u2014 already\nthere were rumors that the Dutch \u2014 the \u2014 that the Germans had poisoned the water. This\nwas all \u2014 the fifth column spread these rumors to force the Dutch to surrender, and there\nwere all sorts of rumors spreading and anyway, th \u2014 by one o\u2019clock the Germans start \u2014\n1:30 the Germans started bombing Rotterdam. Now Rotterdam had been declared an\nMarch 16, 2001\nopen city as of noon on Tuesday because the Dutch were ready to surrender and they\ndidn\u2019t want the t-town \u2014 it\u2019s not a military target to \u2014 to be bombed, but the Germans\nbombed it anyway, claiming that the order came too late and they couldn\u2019t stop the\nbombers that were on the way, like they had no radio, or whatever. And they bombed\nRotterdam and of course as soon as the bombs started falling and our building was\nbombed too, the man standing next to me was hit by a shrapnel. I had learned in\nGermany \u2014 as part of our preparation for the war, when I was still going to school, we\nhad air raid drills. Oh, there was a systematic preparation of the German population for\nwar. That if there\u2019s an air raid and you\u2019re in a building, stand in a doorway. That\u2019s what I\ndid, and that\u2019s what saved me. So \u2014",
        "Q: So you were in this big dance hall when this bombing started?",
        "A: We were \u2014 yes, right. But of course the Dutch guards who were assigned to guard us,\nthey said look, you know, we\u2019re being bombed, run, save yourselves. They let us go.\nThey knew it was over, and you know, there was no sense in keeping us. So I ran home.",
        "Q: Were you with your uncle at the time?",
        "A: No, no, my uncle \u2014 I was \u2014 I was the \u2014 he was a Dutch citizen, he wasn\u2019t touched. I as\na 15 year old was interned by the Dutch. He was a Dutch citizen, he wasn\u2019t touched. So\nhe didn't know what happened to me and he tried to find out and they said well, we are\nsafe and we are being well fed, which we were, and \u2014 but we were retained. And they\nMarch 16, 2001\ncouldn\u2019t put us in jail, they didn\u2019t have enough jail space. So they interned us 1n this\ndance hall. So I ran home and \u2014",
        "Q: Did you have any communication with him while you were in \u2014 interned?",
        "A: No, nothing, there\u2019s no communication. There are no telephone call. You are interned,\nyou\u2019re out of \u2014 that\u2019s it. And \u2014",
        "Q: How did you \u2014 how did you manage that emotionally, being on your own without him,\nwitho \u2014",
        "A: I managed, I managed, there\u2019s \u2014 there wasn\u2019t \u2014 there wasn\u2019t a problem, I \u2014 I was self\nsufficient. You \u2014 when you grew up in Nazi Germany, at age 14 I was self sufficient,\ncertainly at age 15, yeah, just was a year later. So I had no \u2014 I had no problems with that.\nI\u2014I could fend for myself. And I ran home. I went into our house, I had the keys. And\nmy uncle\u2019s car wasn\u2019t there and a couple of his personal things were gone, so I knew that\nhe had left. I took my bicycle, took a few things into my rucksack and took my stamp\ncollection that I had saved once, put them the back on my bike and took off with the bike\nand out of the city. Now, we only had \u2014 we had relatives who lived in a suburb called\nHillerhausberg(ph), and I decided to go there, but to go there I had to well, go through a\nrailroad \u2014 go through a railroad underpass and of course the road was jammed with cars,\nbut I was on a bicycle, there were a few other people on bicycles, you know, Holland is a\n\u2014 bicycle is a means of transportation and there weren\u2019t that many cars in 1940. But I got\nthrough this traffic jam with my bicycle faster than the cars and I went to\nMarch 16, 2001\nHillerhausberg(ph) and when I got there I saw my uncle\u2019s car standing in front of the\nhouse that I was visiting, of course he was very happy to see me. He didn\u2019t know what\nhad hap \u2014 what would happen to me, whether I was alive, or whatever. And so we had a\nhappy reunion. Then that night and then the following night we saw Rotterdam burn.\nThe Germans had thrown a lot of incendiary bombs and Rotterdam went up in smoke,\nthe old Rotterdam. And then eventually, after I guess about four or five days after the\nfires were out we returned back to our address on Mauritsweg, and we found that the\ncity was well, burned, the center of the city. And our house was the second house left\nstanding. Next to us \u2014 these are very much like the brownstones in New York. They are\none room wide and foos \u2014 three stories high, but they\u2019re with a stoop. And our house was\nstanding. Our neighbor\u2019s next to us was standing and that was the m \u2014 consul of Monaco\nlived there and the flag was still flying. And I came into our house, nothing was touched.\nThere was no pilfering, there was no looting, not a window was broken. It was, yeah,\nreally everything was untouched. Well, we moved back in, but now the \u2014 the Germans of\ncourse came \u2014 came in that very afternoon. I saw Germans everywhere and we really felt\nwe were \u2014 well, we were occupied.",
        "Q: What was it like for you to see the Germans again?",
        "A: Terrible. It was really, I mean like \u2014 like a 10 ton weight was put on you. Before I had\nfelt free, that freedom I felt when I left the German border behind me, this, you know,\nbreathing free, and no \u2014 now I don\u2019t have to watch any more what I am saying, I don\u2019t\nMarch 16, 2001\nhave to be on my guard constantly. You don\u2019t have to look over your shoulder or try and\nanticipate what the people around you do, how they act and react and all that. All that\nwas gone, and \u2014 but at least I knew what to expect and what to do. Now the Germans, at\nthat point they came in and they really tried to befriend, or have the Dutch befriend them.\nThey were \u2014 they did not act as occupiers or so, at least their, well, PR relations, as we\nwould say today, they \u2014 they really tried to win the Dutch over to them by, you know,\npropaganda articles, radio broadcasts. Of course everything was taken over, we are not\nhere, we \u2014 we \u2014 this was a tactical move, we had to do that to prevent the British from\ninvading you. And we are, you know, you \u2014 or you are Aryan just as we are, and try to,\nyou know, take that tack to win the Dutch over. But in the meantime, of course, the\nDutch knew what the Germans were like, most Dutch. And that were there to grab the\nfood and they were exba \u2014 sending all the produce \u2014 Holland was known for cream and\ncheese and butter and all the, you know, good things in life that \u2014 that was being sent to\nGermany, and of course that was the case. So \u2014",
        "Q: Speaking about Aryan, did you \u2014 was your coloring very dark? What did you look\nlike, physically?",
        "A: My \u2014 no, I \u2014 as \u2014 as they used to say in America, I could pass. I didn\u2019t look Jewish.\nThere\u2019s a little anecdote I can tell you that happened in 1936 while I was still in \u2014 in\nGermany, and Harry, my brother was still in class. Of course the edict had come down,\nthe instructions that race theory had to be taught in school. And that \u2014 our biology teacher\nMarch 16, 2001\nha \u2014 also happened to be my brother\u2019s homeroom teacher. So one day 1-1n class, says\nwell, today we will talk about the Aryan race. We know of course that the characteristics\nof the Aryan race are a long \u2014 you know, oval face, high forehead, blue eyes, straight\nnose, blon \u2014 blonde hair. And he looked around the classroom and he said, like Roberg,\nfor instance. And he did that very deliberately, to make a point. I don\u2019t know on \u2014 how\nmany got the point that he made in the class, but he did it because he felt good about tt. It\nturned out \u2014 I found out after \u2014 I visited this teacher, Dr. Riegerberg(ph) after the war\nwhen I came back to Germany, and I visited with him, and I found out then that he had a\nJewish grandmother that some of his colleagues knew about, but nobody would tell. And\nthey protected him until 1944 when the director of the school thought it was best if he\nwould take early retirement, just to protect him. So those were the games people played,\nokay, and that was \u2014 so you asked me whether I looked Jewish, that\u2019s my answer.",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019re back in Rotterdam.",
        "A: We\u2019re back in Rotterdam. My uncle sold his car. I taught him how to ride a bike, he\nhadn\u2019t ridden a bike since he was a boy. And we \u2014 well, we pared down. His business, of\ncourse, was gone. He was a well-to-do man, but you know, there was no more\ninternational grain trade. And my \u2014 I had no papers at this point. My passport had been at\nthe American consulate, which went up in flames with the rest of the city. So first I had to\nget anew German passport, and that took about three months. By \u2014",
        "Q: Were you ever in fear for your life during any of this time? Direct fear of your life?\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: From the Germans, no. During the bombing, mm, I ran pretty fast. But not really. I\ncan\u2019t say that I was ever afraid because \u2014 I think because I was prepared, I was \u2014 you\nknow, as a child I think the air raid drills, that\u2019s something to \u2014 really that has served me\nwell throughout my life is I believe in preparation because I learned nearly in life that\npreparation and knowing what your alternatives are, making several choices, having a\nplan A, B and C is good planning and gets you set, you know, for various eventualities.\nSo maybe I can, you know, look at that as a positive thing that came out of this. Anyway,\nby about July, August, the Germans were, of course, pre-preparing for the invasion of\nGreat Britain. And whatever was afloat, they requisitioned. They were requisitioning\nevery barge, every boat, every whatever. But is also showed to us and the Dutch that they\nreally hadn\u2019t prepared \u2014 I think the war went so well for them, both in France and\nBelgium and in Holland, you know, they wiped out the allies and came to \u2014 to the North\nSea and the channel, and really weren't prepared to invade \u2014 to invade England when the\ntime was right. Had they prepared a \u2014 an invasion fleet to follow up on the ground\nvictory, England would have been mincemeat. So then they \u2014 the \u2014 well, the Battle of\nBritain and the air war started and we followed that, of course, from Holland and we\nwould listen to BBC. The mul \u2014 the Dutch channel, the Orange channel broadcast every\nnight at nine o\u2019clock and all Dutch would listen to that. And of course you risked\nwhatever, your freedom, your life, if the Germans found out that you listened to \u2014 to \u2014\nMarch 16, 2001\nand they could arrest you, arrest you, but you took the chance and you did it discreetly,\nand \u2014",
        "Q: Were you permitted to have a radio?",
        "A: At that point in Holland, yes, they couldn't control it. In Germany, of course, Jews\nweren\u2019t allowed to have radios any more since 1936, I think. But yes, you were allowed\nto have radio because the \u2014 also they, at that point still wanted to look like the good\nGermans so they didn\u2019t come out with the edicts of no radios, or no this or that. Of\ncourse, it was known that \u2014 that you weren't allowed to listen to the enemy, but who\ncared?",
        "Q: To \u2014 to back up a little bit, do you remember your 16\" birthday in May 1940?",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question. I remember my 16\" birthday, yes, and we celebrated it in\nHillerhausberg(ph) and my uncle was \u2014 and I was exceedingly glad to be able to\ncelebrate it. I don\u2019t know how we celebrated it, but I guess we found a little cake. You\nknow, the Dutch are very good at finding sweets somewhere, so I\u2019m sure that we did it\nthe right way. I don\u2019t remember the details, but yes, yeah, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s interesting for you to\nnote that it was right there in the thick of it, while Rotterdam burned. By about August\nthen, when the invasion plans of the Germans became more prominent, all German born\nJews were ordered to leave the coastal zone of, I think 25 kilometers. So I had to move\nfrom Rotterdam and an aunt and uncle of mine, who were the parents of a cousin, ma \u2014\nthat\u2019s my uncle\u2019s older sister and her husband, they had also come to Holland because\nMarch 16, 2001\nher daughter lived in Holland. And we then had to move out of the Rotterdam area,\nfurther inland and we went to How-da, which to Americans in pronounced Gouda,\nwhere the cheese comes from. And I con \u2014 we rented a small apartment in a farmhouse\nand Aunt Lena kept house for her husband and me and I went to trade school. I resigned\nfrom the Rotterdam trade school that I went to and went to the trade school, continued in\ntrade school in Gouda.",
        "Q: Stu \u2014 studying what?",
        "A: Oh, I was studying auto mechanics. But in order to become an auto mechanic the first\nyear we had to work on bicycles, the second year on motorcycles and the third year on\nautomobiles. So I was up to working on an old Nash engine. And while we were there,\nmy uncle, in the meantime or \u2014 yeah, I \u2014 I had to get a new passport which eventually I \u2014\nI got from the Germans, of course, you know, with the new photo and a big J stamped\ninto it again, J for Jew.",
        "Q: Was the name Israel in it?",
        "A: Oh yes. Kurt \u2014 Kurt Walter Israel. I still have the passport, so I can check that. And\nwell, went to school and we heard from America. Of course, America heard from us via\nPortugal. I still have the card, the first card that we sent to America, a postcard. You\nwere only allowed to send postcards, no letters, because it was easier for the Germans to\ncensor them. Read a postcard easier than opening up a letter and closing it again. Where\nwe \u2014\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "Q: What \u2014 what kind of things did you say on the postcard?",
        "A: Very interesting that you \u2014 I have the postcard. We wrote it, of course, in Dutch, even\nthough my parents didn\u2019t understand Dutch, but Harry was there to translate it, and I\nwouldn\u2019t have written in German for all the tea in China.",
        "Q: Why not?",
        "A: Because we hated the Germans. I felt like a \u2014 like a Dutch person, I wanted to have\nnothing to do with \u2014 with Germans and I sort of denied that I \u2014 you know, that I certainly\nwould not let them know, or give them the satisfaction or make it easy for them to read\nmy mail. So this was \u2014 this is the only way we could get back. But there was that, you\nknow, resentment \u2014 well, resentment, you\u2019re gonna make it as tough for them as possible.",
        "Q: Were you still speaking in German though, to your uncle?",
        "A: No, we spoke Dutch only. Oh no, we \u2014 we \u2014 at that point we wouldn\u2019t have spoken\nGerman for anything, either in public or even in private. With my uncle and aunt, I mean,\nAunt Lena of course, I had to speak German because they didn\u2019t understand any Dutch.\nBut I was fluent in Dutch and of course, you know, in school. So \u2014 no, but we wouldn't\nhave spoken German for anything, so my corresponding was in \u2014 but I wrote everything\nin \u2014 well, we had a\u2014acode. This interesting point that you make. This is something that\nwe had already developed while living in Germany. When \u2014 when we wrote from\nGermany, let\u2019s say to Holland or to relatives, we would write it in such a way that they\nunderstood what we were talking about but nobody else could. For instance, in Celle, the\nMarch 16, 2001\n\u2014 the captain of the volunteer fire brigade, his name was Schnell, which happens to be\nquick, okay? Schnell. So I wrote on this postcard, we are well. Our old neighbor Herr\nSchnell had plenty of work for at least a week. So they knew how to interpret that, the\ncensor didn\u2019t. So this is how we got the information across without, you know \u2014 anyway,\nit worked for us and I think all families had that. Or we would \u2014 we would refer to family\nmembers who were already somewhere else, you know. If \u2014 if we had a relative, let\u2019s say,\nin Switzerland, we would say Uncle S-Simon, you know, we were able to get in touch\nwith Uncle Simon and send him something. Meaning we were able to send something to\nSwitzerland, okay? So that\u2019s how we disguised information. I think that was pretty\ncommon. You just had to adapt to conditions, and you did. And it became actually, a\nsport to try to outwit the Germans. That was our mentality and it was also, that\u2019s what\nkept us going. Chronologically now I want to move on to \u2014 my uncle, of course, was\ntrying desperately at that point to try and get me to America. Don\u2019t forget, America was\nstill neutral. Then he found out in oh, about in October, November must have been,\nsometime in the fall of 1940 that someone in Holland tried to organize a children\u2019s\ntransport to save or to reunite children who were left behind in Holland with parents who\nwere already in America. [ only found out about 10 years ago when I was in \u2014 in\nAmsterdam at the war museum and archives, who this woman was. And that was Mrs.\nWijsmuller. She was \u2014 and my uncle found out about it because her husband was a\nshipping magnate. He \u2014 he owned steamships. And my uncle was, you know, dealt with\nMarch 16, 2001\nsteamship companies, being in the grain business. And Mrs. vice \u2014 Mefrau Wijsmuller,\nthey were not Jewish, of course, had very good relations with the Germans, German\nofficers, in particular.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: \u2014 volunteer collection interview with Kurt Roberg, this is tape number three, side B.\nAnd you were talking about Frau Wijsmuller.",
        "A: Mefrau Wijsmuller, spelled w-i-j-s-m-u-l-l-e-r. Mefrau Wijsmuller had very good\nrelationships with German officers and other than with the Nazis and the \u2014 a lot of the\nmilitary were not necessarily \u2014 the professional military were not necessarily in\nagreement with what the Nazi party did, or the SS did. So there was la \u2014 she had \u2014 she\nhad good connections all the way to the top in Holland, and in Germany. And she was\napparently able to persuade the Germans to let her do humanitarian things, taking \u2014 you\nknow, reuniting children after the war who were in Holland and Belgium with the\nparents who were in southern France, etcetera. She would make a trip with six or eight\nchildren and take them to be reunited. On the way she would \u2014 she \u2014 she would also take\nmedicines with her and medical supplies and she was really quite a force, and obviously\nvery persuasive and would tha \u2014 now, there was an \u2014 there was an incident at the border\ntoo, that I understand she arranged fo \u2014 where she bribed the border guards with a couple\nof bottles of whiskey, etcetera. Here, have a good time, let me bring these children across,\nMarch 16, 2001\nyou know. And she was \u2014 she was really very good at what she did. So she tried to get\nthis \u2014 this experimental group going and I think she also enlisted or tried to enlist the Red\nCross and in America the HIAS, etcetera. She pushed all buttons, and was able to then\narrange for an experimental group. There were two groups, one that I was on, which was\nthe first group. We left Amsterdam on January 31, 1941. I had gotten my \u2014 oh, I\u2019m\nsorry, I\u2019m \u2014 cancel that. I got my American visa in Amsterdam on January 31, 1941.\nNow that I had the visa, I was eligible for Mefrau Wijsmuller\u2019s group of other\nyoungsters who were also getting their American visas during February, and on March\nfirst, we left Amsterdam. But, under the German rules we had to go back to Berlin\nbecause all trans \u2014 all officially sanctioned tr-transports out of greater Germany and\noccupied lands, originated in Berlin.",
        "Q: Was it \u2014 was it hard for you leave Holland?",
        "A: It was hard for me to leave Holland because even though we were occupied, I was\nstill among friends and now, I mean the feeling when we were on the train and we came\nback across the German border, I mean, there was still a border between Holland and\nGermany, but the border didn\u2019t mean anything, but now everything was \u2014 and now we\nwere traveling as a group of young Jews and well, we knew how to behave. We were all\nGerman Jewish \u2014 German, yeah, refugees. The oldest was 17, I was 15 and the youngest\ngirl was 11.",
        "Q: Y-You were 16, I think.\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: I was 16. So we \u2014 we went back into Germany and we were told that we would get \u2014",
        "Q: What was that like to go in \u2014 to go back?",
        "A: Very oppressive. Of course, we only spoke Dutch. We did not acknowledge that we\ncould speak German, even though we had German passports. We could have been, you\nknow, b-bor \u2014 come as children to Holland, we did not acknowledge Germany in any\nway. And among ourselves we spoke Dutch so that not everybody could understand what\nwe were saying. We arrived in Berlin and we were taken under the wing \u2014 well, we\narrived actually in two groups. There was our group of, I think eight, and then four more\ncame, or five more came a few days later. The plan was that we would stay one week in\nBerlin. There was a transport from Berlin once a week, from Berlin to Lisbon. Now, I\nhad received \u2014 oh, my uncle had received from my mother in America, a transatlantic\ncable stating that passage had been booked \u2014 passage booked for Kurt, American a \u2014\nexport company, 210 dollars paid, reservation booked from lis \u2014 Lisbon, New York,\nleaving March 15\". And I had that telegram \u2014 cable. I had nothing else. I had no ticket or\nanything, just the acknowledgement. When we got to Berlin and we were lodged by the \u2014\nby the Jewish congregation in Berlin at a place which was home \u2014 old age home.\nAltersheim. Located at Grosse Hamburger Strasse, number 19. It was a home for the\naged and was also a school and th \u2014 the building \u2014 behind the building, behind the school\nbuilding there was a gymnasi \u2014 a gym and that gym had been converted into a makeshift\nhall where there were about 80 \u2014 anywhere between 80 and 120 cots. A curtain was\nMarch 16, 2001\ndrawn in the middle for men on the \u2014 on one side, women on the other. There was one\npotbelly stove in the center for what passed as heat. It was all, you know, improvised, but\nit worked and the people that were there knew they were gonna be there only a short\ntime, but it was a transient location. We ate there where they had kitchen, we ate three\nmeals a day there and the Jewish community took care of that.",
        "Q: So you had direct contact with these Berlin Jews?",
        "A: Well, that was \u2014 that was arranged by the committee. The committee in \u2014 in\nAmsterdam that had arranged for us to, you know, and was in communication with\nBerlin. And there was also a group in Lisbon, the Jewish community, and I think the\nHIAS was sort of the overriding Jewish organization that coordinated that.",
        "Q: But my question was you ha \u2014 you were able to talk directly with these Berlin Jews,\ncould you \u2014",
        "A: Well, there was one man \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 have conversation with them?",
        "A: \u2014 thi \u2014 well, not at large. There was a man who was assigned to us. He was \u2014 he was\nthe contact, so we didn\u2019t just \u2014 you know, he was the contact, and we also in the group,\nthe oldest person \u2014 oh, there were two, there was one woman, Judith, she was 17, and\nthere was a fellow with whom I became very friendly, Jerry Cohen(ph) was 17. They\nwere the \u2014 the senior people and they sort of, you know, took everybody\u2019s passport so\nthat \u2014 there had to be an organization. They were in charge. Anyway, the first day, of\nMarch 16, 2001\ncourse, within 24 hours, within Germany, certainly within Europe, when you move, you\nknow, you have to register. When you leave Holland, whe-when I left Gouda, I had to\ngo to the city hall and say, I\u2019m leaving, I\u2019m going to Berlin, I will be in Berlin, okay?\nAnd then when I \u2014 when we got to Berlin we had to say, we are now in Berlin, we come\nfrom Gouda, etcetera, records, you know, transfer every \u2014 and everything with stamps\nand so we had to go to the city police in Berlin and s-state that we were there for one\nweek, we were staying at Grosse Hamburger Strasse and we were going \u2014 after one\nweek we would go \u2014 you know, continue on to Lisbon, we were in transit. Fine, got\npermission to stay for seven days, no problem. But after seven days we did not have our\ntransit visas for Spain. We needed transit visas for \u2014 well, France wasn\u2019t a problem, that\nwas an occupied country. It\u2019s \u2014 the Germans were in charge, but Spain and Portugal\nwere. And our passports were taken to \u2014 were taken to the Spanish consulate and they\nsaid oh, we will be glad to give you the visa, as soon as you have the Portuguese visa.\nWhat\u2019s the sense of giving you a Spanish, you don\u2019t even have the Portuguese? And\nunless we can be assured that you have the Portuguese so that you don\u2019t get stuck in\nSpain, we will give it to you. Went to the Portuguese. Of course we will give you\nPortuguese visa, as soon as you have the Spanish visa. What\u2019s the sense of giving you a\nPortuguese, you don\u2019t even have the Spanish? Get the Spanish and you will get the\nPortuguese, okay? Catch 22. We went back to the Spaniards and told them. And oh no,\nthey\u2019re wrong, they \u2014 we will give you the \u2014 1t went back and forth. This took, of course,\nMarch 16, 2001\nmore than a week so after seven days we had to go back to the Berlin police to get an\nextension of our permit to stay. Now they got nasty, and they hollered at us in German.\nYou\u2019re eating the bread that the German workers are entitled to. The implication was that\nif we didn\u2019t work, we wouldn't eat. Now we also had heard and we knew that once you\nwere assigned as a labor force, if they put you into a factory, you were \u2014 became war\nessential. You could take your American visa and whatever, okay? You would never get\nyour exit permit. So they gave us another one week extension. Now within that week we\nstill did not have the papers. Now they said well, the \u2014 Berlin is not responsible for these\npapers, the American visa was issued in Holland. The \u2014 these people came from\nHolland, they should have gotten their Portuguese and Spanish transit visas in Holland,\nnot in Berlin. So they took our passports and sent them back to Amsterdam. Now we\nwere without identification. We got, I guess, a temporary, you know, bu \u2014 I \u2014I.D. card,\nwhatever from the \u2014 from the \u2014 Berlin. Now we did not dare to, you know, go out or\nwhatever. If we \u2014 if we would be caught without that \u2014 you know, you have to \u2014 you have\nto expl \u2014 well, we did go out, but only \u2014 things were very controlled in Berlin already at\nthat time. The British would fly over and bomb occasionally. It was not \u2014 but they would\ncome across, so there were air raids at night. The food was rationed, of course. And Jews\nhad special ration coupons. Everything was by coupons and the Jewish coupons were\nstamped with a red J. Jews were only allowed to buy after four p.m. There was nothing\nleft by four p.m. You go into a bakery, you took whatever \u2014 if they had anything left you\nMarch 16, 2001\ntook what, you know, didn\u2019t say well, I want a rye bread, you took whatever they had,\nright. Those were the conditions. Anyway, the Jewish congregation \u2014 and I\u2019m going to\ntry and find out how they did that, had a \u2014 had a gimmick. They protected us from being\nassigned to the workforce, and it worked as follows. We were assigned as a workforce in\nBerlin Wannsee. Now, I don\u2019t know whether you know what Wannsee. Wannsee was\nthere was a large estate which was \u2014 course had been Jewish, that was confiscated and\nhad been made as a R and R retreat for the SS. They were still in the process of fixing\nthat up and the Jewish congregation apparently had somehow managed to arrange that\nthey will supply X number of workers every day. Let\u2019s say 50 workers for doing ground\nkeeping etcetera. So now we were assigned twice a week to go out and work in\nWannsee. The Gestapo out there didn\u2019t care who came. Now we were \u2014 we were briefed,\nwe were told, you will see people in striped suits that are guarded by soldiers with guns.\nDon\u2019t even look at them, make no eye contact with anyone. Don\u2019t talk to anyone. Don\u2019t\ntalk among each other other than necessary, even the people that you know. Do your\nwork, keep your head down, mind your own business, don\u2019t make waves, okay? So, with\nthose instructions we took the S-Bahn, the subway, the elevated out to Wannsee and we\nwent to work, raking, cleaning up, whatever they told us to do. And now we had to go\nback after two weeks to the city police. What are you doing, you have been here \u2014 are\nyou \u2014 what \u2014 we are working for Gestapo Wannsee. That\u2019s all they had to hear. We got\nour stamp. You can stay. We had the extension. And that\u2019s how they rotated people who\nMarch 16, 2001\nwere about to leave to protect them from being entered into the labor force. And I\u2019m\ngoing to try and find out in Berlin when I am there this spring if they know how they\nmanaged to do that. In the meantime, political things march on. Things in the Balkan\nweren\u2019t going too well. We were watching, of course the political or the \u2014 how the war\ndeveloped. So far, for Germany everything went right. Italy started to invade Albany,\nAlbany couldn\u2019t be invaded.",
        "Q: Albania?",
        "A: Alb \u2014 right, Albania. What did I say, alba \u2014 Albania. Albany is upstate New York.\nAlbania. And the Germans had to go and help them out and then the invasion of Greece\nas a follow up. They parachute jumped to Crete. By this time it was April and we said oh\nwell, if the war expands, maybe we\u2019ll never get out. And we still didn\u2019t have our papers.\nThey were still haggling in Amsterdam and Berlin. We still didn\u2019t have our passports.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re still working at Wannsee.",
        "A: We\u2019re still working Wannsee.",
        "Q: Which is the site of the future Wannsee Conference.",
        "A: Right. Now it was \u2014 finally, by the end of April we said well, we are getting our\npapers, and we did get our papers finally, and now we were preparing, we were told the\ntrip takes five days. You will leave on \u2014 maybe in two or three weeks you will be able to\nget on the train. And I was telling them my, you know, my visa \u2014 my visa expired May\n318. I didn\u2019t have all that much time left. My American visa was issued January 31\u201c. It\nMarch 16, 2001\nexpired May 31\u201c. By that time I had to be on the boat. So time was getting short for me,\nthe other kids had maybe a week or two more, but not a lot. One day \u2014 well \u2014 how much\ntime do you \u2014 how much time do you have left? So one day, it was, I guess end of April\nor so, and I was walking past a Woolworth and there wa \u2014 it is \u2014 was a Woolworth,\nthere was a Woolworth in Berlin, and it was like 9:30 in the morning. And I saw that\nthey had a big ad in the window, Thermosflaschen(ph), Thermos bottles. They had a\nspecial. So \u2014 but Thermos bottles in Germany weren\u2019t that easy to come by during the\nwar. So my God, it\u2019s 9:30, I walked into this store. I would \u2014 and they were pretty cheap\ntoo, like four mark or something like that. I said yes, I would like some Thermos bottles,\nyes. I need 13. 13 Thermos bottles? Yes. He says, why do you need 13? I said, we\u2019re\ngoing on an excursion from school and you know, we \u2014 we all going and I need \u2014 of\ncourse I said this in perfect German. Are you sh \u2014 are you Aryan? Sind sie arisch? I said\nyes. He says, may I see your Ausweis? I said, I don\u2019t have an Ausweis, I have a passport.\nLet me see your passport. I said my passport is at the \u2014 at the German embassy. Are you\nsure you\u2019re Aryan? I said look, I am Auslandsdeutsche. Now I don\u2019t know whether you\nknow what that it. Auslandsdeutsche they \u2014 in Germany they had a very special\nstanding because they were the Germans, the Aryan, the good Germans, Aryan Germans\nwho lived in the foreign countries, and Hitler \u2014 the system really sort of depended on\nthem that if and when they moved in that they would support the German cause. So the\nAuslandsdeutsche was a status. I said, 1 am Auslandsdeutsche from Holland. I said,\nMarch 16, 2001\nI\u2019ve lived in Holland most of my life. My parents were German, but I lived in Holland\nand in Holland we don\u2019t know from Aryan or non-Aryan. I don\u2019t know what that means.\nYeah, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re German. I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t sell you now. Now this 1s called\nchutzpah. I| said well, 1f you don\u2019t want to sell me now, at least will you save me 13\nbottles so that when I come back at four ocl \u2014 he said, you have to come back after four\no\u2019clock \u2014 when I come back after four o\u2019clock that I \u2014 that I can still get these? I really\ndon\u2019t know why you don\u2019t want to sell me those now. Come back at four o\u2019clock. And I\ndid. And she was not waiting with the police. She was decent. She sold me 13 bottles.\nNow, be \u2014 all my co-travelers were very happy because now we were prepared for our\ntrip through France and Spain and Portugal. We at least could have hocked something.\nWhen I came to America and I told my mother that story, she almost died. How can you\nbe so stupid? Well, that\u2019s \u2014 I took the chance and I had to try and get out of it as best I\ncould, and you have to \u2014 you lived, or you survived or you didn\u2019t survive by your wits.\nAnd that\u2019s \u2014 that was the point of growing up under these conditions. Anyway, we had\nour Thermos bottles, we were ready to go and we were preparing, and on May 11\",\nRudolf Hess decided to fly to England. Rudolf Hess of course was Stellvertreter des\nFuhrers, and we thought this is the end, we\u2019re no \u2014 never going to get out. Well luckily,\nthe Germans played it down, they didn\u2019t make a big deal of it, it was in the paper one day\nand he was out of his mind, it was \u2014 well, whatever. He tried to \u2014 however they explained\nit and the newspapers will tell you how. And it did not change the foreign policy toward\nMarch 16, 2001\nAmerica, which was still neutral. And on May 19\", we left Berlin. We were sealed into a\nrailroad car, third class. This was a regular, you know, railroad car.",
        "Q: Y-You just passed your 17\" birthday?",
        "A: Yes. The doors were sealed, do not open the windows. Of course, we weren\u2019t going to\nget out, but they were afraid that maybe somebody would add \u2014 would \u2014 would climb in.\nAnd we were shunted, we were attached to a train that went to Paris. Of course in Paris\nyou arrive at Gare du Nord, and for the Spanish border you leave from Gare Austerlitz.\nHow do you get from one to the other? Well, we were shunted by whatever, like freight.\nIt took us about seven hours to get from one railroad station to the other, and then we\nwere eventually attached to the train that went to the f \u2014 Spanish border.",
        "Q: D-Did you have an adult accompanying you all this time?",
        "A: No. No, we were \u2014 we were \u2014 we were 13 adults ranging from age 18 to age 12.",
        "Q: Did the older children take care of the younger children?",
        "A: Yeah, the older \u2014 yeah, the two \u2014 the two \u2014 you know, Judith and Jerry who were by\nthis time, I guess 18, whatever. And no, there was \u2014 there was nobody. We knew what to\ndo.",
        "Q: Wer-Were the younger children in good spirits?",
        "A: Yes, they were \u2014 well, the younger one \u2014 she had an older brother too, he was sixt \u2014\n17 also, and you know, there were \u2014 there were no problems. There were no problems\nthat respect. And we arrived at the Spanish border, the name, ba-ba-ba-ba \u2014 Ondai(ph).\nMarch 16, 2001\nIn Ondai(ph). And in those days \u2014 when you do it now, you \u2014 you know, the \u2014 the\ndifferent \u2014 Spain has different rail gauge than the rest of Europe. In those days that was\nsolved by getting out on the French side, you walked across a bridge and then you were\nin Spain and you boarded the Spanish train and that\u2019s what we did.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nMarch 16, 2001\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Kurt Roberg. This is tape number four, side A, and you\u2019ve just\ncome over to the Spanish border.",
        "A: Well, now we were in Spain and while we knew, of course, that Spain, Franco\u2019s\nSpain was very sympathetic to the Germans, at least we had the feeling that we were not\nunder direct German control any more. The people who had organized our trip had\narranged for us to be overnight in San Sebastian and we stayed at the finest five star\nhotel, the Marie Louise, I think it is called, where we spent a glorious night and then\nwent on by train, and as we were riding through the Spanish countryside, we really saw\nan appalling sight. Spain had just come out of the civil war which lasted what, four years,\nfive years? And the people were devastated. We had hoarded bread for our trip because\nwe had to take along food for five days. We were locked into a \u2014 into a car and we knew\nthere was no food in \u2014 in Spain, so this was our third day. And suddenly we had really\npoor people coming along the railroad car and as we were standing at this station, or if we\nwere on a siding somewhere, begging, begging for bread and offering us oranges. I\nhadn\u2019t seen an orange since I left Holland. In Holland we had oranges, but Germany\nhad no oranges. So we traded bread for oranges. And then while the train then made its\nway slowly to the Spanish border, to the \u2014 to the Spanish-Portuguese border, and there\nwe had to change again into a Portuguese train, which was \u2014\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: Yeah, I just wanted to ask about how cohesive the group was, these are young\nteenagers. Were \u2014 were you a unified group, did you feel intensely close to each other?\nThe feeling among the group of children that you were with.",
        "A: Yes, we were. There were \u2014 there were some kids that felt closer, a couple of the \u2014\nwell, girls especially, sort of kept to themselves. I guess some of the guys were, I don\u2019t\nknow, they weren\u2019t coming on to them by today\u2019s standards, but there \u2014 you know, they\ndidn\u2019t want any involvement. Of course, the leaders wouldn\u2019t tolerate any an \u2014 romantic,\nlet\u2019s say, involvement, there was none of that. But m \u2014 m \u2014 well, to each his own, and \u2014",
        "Q: Wha-What did you all do inside this car for \u2014 for five days? What did you talk about?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t remember. Our conversations were very guarded. When a \u2014 whatever \u2014\nwhatever, even in Spain, you never knew who was listening.",
        "Q: No, I meant, in the sealed car.",
        "A: In the sealed car I don\u2019t know what we did, whether we played games, I don\u2019t really\nrecall, but we \u2014 maybe we played checkers or something like that, but the \u2014 there wasn\u2019t\na lot of reading, there wasn\u2019t a\u2014 a \u2014I really \u2014 you looked outside, you looked out the\nwindow and you ate whatever you had at various intervals. Now, while I was in \u2014 in\nBerlin still, Uncle Wilhelm had sent me a \u2014 packages, food packages. When he found\nout that I was going to be there more than a week he \u2014 in Holland you could still get\nthings, in Germany you couldn\u2019t, so I got a couple of food packages with chocolate,\nwhich of course I shared with my fellow \u2014 you know, travelers. And a couple of little\nMarch 16, 2001\nGouda cheeses. And I really saved a bar of chocolate and a cheese as a iron ration, I\ncalled it, you know, when things really get tough that \u2014 that I had something. We didn\u2019t\nknow where our next meal was coming from, so I always had that in reserve. And\u2014a\nmatter of fact, I brought a cheese to America. And \u2014 but I don\u2019t remember in particular\nhow we kept busy. But, you know, just looking outside, I don\u2019t know whether I did any \u2014\nI did \u2014 I did a lot of drawing then but I didn\u2019t \u2014 oh, by the way, I had \u2014 I had brought you\na couple of pictures, talking about drawing, I almost forgot, they are put into the record,\nyou can have th \u2014 I \u2014 this is what I \u2014 we are going back to May of 1940 in Rotterdam\nand there was the view of Rotterdam from the roof of my house, and this too.",
        "Q: And what is \u2014 could you describe that?",
        "A: Yes. Here we have a view, this is a pen and ink drawing, since I \u2014 we had no cameras.\nA pen and ink drawing of our view from Mauritsweg toward the city hall, and we see in\nthe background the oude kerk, the old church steeple. The old church was heavily\ndamaged during the fire and so was the city hall. And next to the city hall is \u2014 1s the\ntower, very modern with the carillon on it, which the Dutch are known for. And that was\nthe new stock exchange. That remained untouched, but everything around it was burned,\nburned out and devastated. The other picture is the street \u2014 sa \u2014 there was the \u2014 the trees\nin the background, was the zoo. And th \u2014 this street here there is a trolley with the tender\ngoing through there. The streets, once they were cleared the trolleys would run again, but\nthey were going through rubble and devastation. Everything up to the house on which I\nMarch 16, 2001\nwas \u2014 where I was on the roof, everything was burned out, bombed out and devastated.\nSo this is a pencil drawing which I now didn\u2019t complete, but I did sign it.",
        "Q: You made these actual drawings at the time?",
        "A: Im-\u2014I made these drawings at the time, yes. This 1s \u2014",
        "Q: And why did you do that?",
        "A: Because I wanted \u2014 I wanted to record what \u2014 what I \u2014 you know, what \u2014 what we had\nseen. I was always very conscious of, you know, historic events, this was certainly\nhistoric event. I had no camera and so \u2014 and I was into \u2014 into drawing, so I \u2014 I drew it and\nwell, this pen and ink, I haven\u2019t done very many pen and ink, but that\u2019s all I had available\nthen, and I think it\u2019s a very respectable little drawing. So Ill leave these with the records.",
        "Q: Okay, now we\u2019re back in Spain.",
        "A: Okay, back in Spain. Well, actually we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re crossing over into po \u2014 into\nPortugal, the Portuguese trains were new, aluminum, and very American looking. They\nwere, in fact, modern American railroad equipment and we really saw it as the preview of\ncoming attractions. We arrived in Lisbon and we were put up by the Jewish community\nthere m \u2014 or the organization that was sponsoring our trip, assumably the HIAS. We were\nput up in a pensionne and we had a very interesting experience. About the day after we\narrived, a man came to our pensionne and said, I am from the free Dutch government in\nLondon. And he showed us a\u2014 an I.D. And you have come from Berlin? Yes. And you\nwere in Holland before? Yes. And of course we were very eager to tell our story and also\nMarch 16, 2001\ngive the allies \u2014 don\u2019t forget there was, you know, the Dutch \u2014 the queen had escaped to \u2014\nand the \u2014 you know, the royal house was in London. There was a Dutch force \u2014 air force,\nand you know, whatever, armed forces and we were very eager to help the allies. So he\nsays well, I would like to interview you. I will come back tomorrow and I'd like you to \u2014\nyou know, to tell me whatever you can. And we were most eager to tell him. So we met\nthe following day, it was about six o\u2019clock at night. I and two other boys, Jerry\nCohen(ph), who was fluent in Dutch and one other boy. And first we went to a\nrestaurant, caf \u2014 caf\u00e9 on the main square in Lisbon and he ordered coffee for us, and oh,\nwe were glad to have real coffee after that bilge water we \u2014 we got in Germany. And\nthen he said, don\u2019t turn around but I don\u2019t think we can talk here because there is an \u2014 an\nforeign agent sitting at another table, watching us. We better leave here. And of course\nwe were not aware of \u2014 you know, we hadn\u2019t seen any of the movies that \u2014 that showed\nthat friend and foe met in Lisbon. And he says, I think we better go to my apartment,\nwhere we can talk freely. And we went, and he took us up some back alleys in the back\nwhere the \u2014 if you\u2019ve ever been in \u2014 in Lisbon, you have a \u2014 seven hills just like in\nRome, and cobblestone narrow streets and he led us to his apartment. All I can say is\nthank heaven he was legitimate. What we found out later, he could have been a German\nagent who posed as a free Dutch agent. Well, we spilled our guts. We told him what the\nGermans had done in Holland. We told him where the fortifications were in Berlin in the\n\u20141in the zoo area, Tiergarten and th-th-they had built high rise bunkers they call them,\nMarch 16, 2001\nsolid concrete. And where the anti-aircraft guns were agains \u2014 you know, when the\nBritish came o \u2014 flying over, we spilled our guts and felt very good about it, that we\ncould finally do something. What we didn\u2019t realize was that there were just as many\nGerman agents there as there were English and Dutch and whatever else. So he could\nhave \u2014 very easily it could have been the last of us, that we would have disappeared,\nnever to be seen again. Luckily, that didn\u2019t happen. Well, so now it was \u2014",
        "Q: Ho-How did you know so much about the locations of places in Berlin and so forth?",
        "A: It was a\u2014",
        "Q: Military.",
        "A: Well, tha-tha \u2014 that\u2019s militar \u2014 this was apparent to anybody who lived in Berlin. You\nknow, the Tiergarten, which is the \u2014 the zoo or the park area, they had built bunkers\nthere because they were \u2014 because it was \u2014 they were protected by the trees and were, you\nknow, camouflaged, natural camouflage. And well, we just told them what we knew\nabout what they were doing in \u2014 in Holland, that they had tried to, you know, build a\nfleet which \u2014 etcetera, etcetera. And \u2014 and well, there was that and then as time got near I\nwent, of course, speaking for my ow \u2014 my own interests, I went to the American export\nlines and told them that I was here. I had my cable showing that my mother had paid. I\nhad missed the March 15\", I had not taken advantage of the payment. You have a\npayment, and I\u2019m here now and I\u2019ve got to leave. I knew that the next ship was leaving\non March 30\". The Excambion, one of their lines. And yes, I said, well I have to be on\nMarch 16, 2001\nthat ship, and \u2014 okay, don\u2019t worry, I se \u2014 so starting on the 27\", I went to the office eight\no\u2019clock in the morning and I said I would like to see the passenger list. Don\u2019t worry,\nyou'll be on the \u2014 I said, I want to see the passenger list. Well, we don\u2019t have it yet. So I\nsat there all day and waited and \u2014 and I had no other place to go. And on the 29\", it was\ngetting a little closer, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be on the ship, and you know \u2014 anyway, they \u2014\nthey gave me a song and a dance, and let me see the \u2014 I said, you can see it but you can\u2019t\nhave it. It was my only receipt. And this went until the 30\", and then on the 30\", said,\nwell, the ship isn\u2019t sailing until tomorrow, which was May 31\u201c. I say, you\u2019re sure it\u2019s sai\n\u2014 yes, 1\u2014 tomorrow. Well anyway, they gave me their \u2014 you know, delayed me again.\nThey never came across with the passenger list. And I talked to the guy from the Jewish\ncommittee and he said, you\u2019ll be on the list, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be \u2014 you\u2019Il make it. Then,\non the \u2014 he said, yet \u2014 look, tomorrow morning you go to the pier \u2014 and I had to borrow\nmoney because we were only allowed 10 mark out of Germany, which was soon gone. I\nborrowed money from one of my fellow travelers and that \u2014 luckily the fares in Portugal\nwere very cheap, so I got to the pier and I was standing there waiting. I got there about\ntwo o\u2019clock in the afternoon with all the other refugees and we were \u2014 I was standing in\nthe sun. Here it was the end of May and I was wearing my winter clothes that I had left\nHolland with in March. Not good. And well, this guy finally \u2014 our guy showed up about\nfour, 4:30, climbs up on a crate and starts calling out names of refugees. The Americans\nwere going up the gangplank, you know, like Americans do, and the refugees were\nMarch 16, 2001\nstanding in the sun. And this guy starts reading names and reading names and well, the\nthird class \u2014",
        "Q: The-These are like American tourists, you\u2019re saying, or \u2014 or American visitors?",
        "A: Well [indecipherable] no tourists.",
        "Q: American visitors, or \u2014",
        "A: American visitors or people who were returning home from \u2014 from America, you\nknow? And the refugees were standing, waiting for this guy to call their names. So finally\nlike the third last name, Roberg, Kurt. Well, by this time it was six o\u2019clock. I flew up\nthat gangplank and I was on my way, so I thought. So, wait til about 10 o\u2019clock, this boat\nwas \u2014 it was supposed to leave at six. The boat was still in port, so I went to bed, and \u2014\nmy bunk and next morning I got up at seven o\u2019clock, I went to see the sun rise over the\nocean, I got up, we\u2019re still in Portugal. They\u2019re still loading cork. The Excambion was a\ncombination freight and passengers. There were 180 passengers and n \u2014 thank heaven,\none class. Da \u2014 did not have first and second or third class. So there were no\nubermenschen and untermenschen, which was nice. But hey, I\u2019m on board, it\u2019s an\nAmerican ship, I\u2019m on American territory, right, American grounds, under the American\nflag. I wasn\u2019t worried. So we finally left about nine o\u2019clock. They weighed anchor and\noff we went, stopped in Bermuda for six hours and well, 10 days later we arrived in the\ngood old U.S.A., so I guess the customs people got on board out in the bay, Customs and\n\u2014 customs and immigration. So the last two hours as the ship steams 1n, they are\nMarch 16, 2001\nprocessing everybody. So li \u2014 look at my passport, ah, sit over here. A couple of other\npeople sat over there, most people could go again. And then finally he calls me back.\nKurt Roberg? Yeah. Why are you trying to enter this country with an expired visa? I\nsaid, my visa was good when I came aboard ship. My visa expired at midnight. I was\naboard ship at six p.m. According to the ship\u2019s log, this vessel sailed on June first. Your\nvisa expired May 31. You can\u2019t come in. What do you mean I can\u2019t come in? I didn\u2019t\nsay that, but I\u2014 we were taught to be humble, even in America. So, well, we docked in\nHoboken, as was customary in those days. American export line docked in Hoboken, not\nin New York. And of course my mother knew \u2014 oh, I had \u2014 I had borrowed three dollars\nfrom a German speaking steward on board, to send a telegram from aboard ship to my\nmother that I was coming. She hadn\u2019t heard from me since I was in Berlin. I didn\u2019t write\nbecause every week we were supposed to leave and I was going to be there before the\nletters, right? So I didn\u2019t write. I wrote to my uncle, and he wrote to my mother and that\u2019s\nhow she got word about what was happening with me, but I didn\u2019t write, and well, she\nwent crazy \u2014 I mean, she understood, but why didn\u2019t you write? Anyway, so she was\ndown on the pier and I was up on board. All the passengers were leaving the ship except\nme and one other woman, we stayed on board. Do you think they would have let my\nmother up, or me down? No, not in America. We waved, she cried. I guess I was teary-\neyed. And I remember I s \u2014 I called to my mother, Mother, are you wearing lipstick? She\nsays, yes, in America we \u2014 in America we wear lipstick. Because in Europe women \u2014\nMarch 16, 2001\nhussies wore lipstick. My mother wearing lipstick, can you believe that? I said, before\nyou know it you probably will \u2014 will paint your nails red, too. So those were the little \u2014\nand that \u2014 that sort of stuck in my mind. Now anyway, my mother was told that I could\nnot come down. We hollered up and down, you know, across the \u2014 and they told me that\nI'd have to go to Ellis Island for a hearing, just a formality. And my mother, of course,\nwent the next day just for this formality and there was a hearing before a judge, and he\nlooked at my papers and decided that well, they couldn\u2019t let me in. Now they \u2014 the visa\nwas definitely expired. As a matter of fact, there was something wrong with the visa. The\nvisa was issued on January 31\u00b0, it should have only gone to May 30\". They gave you an\nextra day, why? Oh, this will have to go to Washington, the State Department will have\nto handle that. And so it happened that Kurt Roberg stayed on Ellis Island for four\nweeks while they debated in Washington whether they could take a risk, the risk of\nletting me in, or whether they would send me back. And I guess lawyers came cheap in\nthose days. American export lines had their lawyers working on it, because they would\nhave had to pay another 210 dollars to take me back to Lisbon and obviously lawyers\nwere paid a lot less than that in those days. So after four weeks they finally re \u2014 relented\nand \u2014 and they said, you can stay.",
        "Q: Did you have any physical contact with your mother during those four weeks?",
        "A: Physical only in that she would come \u2014 my mother worked, and \u2014 but on weekends\nshe could come to Ellis Island, or anybody else during visitors\u2019 hours and in the great\nMarch 16, 2001\nhall that you may have gone to, I know it very well, when it wasn\u2019t as tidy as it looks now\nand I became an expert Ping-Pong player there. Did crafts and a lot of drawing and\nreading papers and spending time, and I\u2019m an expert on Ellis Island.",
        "Q: What was it like to be close to your mother again, physically close?",
        "A: Well, it was wonderful. It was \u2014 it was great. It was wonderful.",
        "Q: Did your father come out to Ellis Island?",
        "A: I think he came \u2014 yeah, one \u2014 he was not well, also relations between my parents had\ngotten, you know, worse. And my mother worked in New Rochelle, he lived on the room\nin Washington Heights. My brother had a job in Bridgeport, Connecticut. We were all\nover the map.",
        "Q: During those four weeks, did you ever really fear that you might be sent back?",
        "A: Definitely. And I was very close to being sent back. Oh they \u2014 State Department gave\nno quarter, they went by the book. They absolutely went by the book, they couldn\u2019t care\nless about \u2014 there was no human consideration, the fact that if I would be sent back that\nI'd end up in the \u2014 you know, would be sent back all the way to Germany and end up in\nthe \u2014 wherever, right? In a pile of ashes. Oh, there was no \u2014 was no consideration\nwhatsoever of that, as far as I know. Now, my question to you, ca\u20141\u2014 how would I\nresearch something like that? Is there a file on me in the State Department that is in\nexistence to this day? And can I reach that under the whatever act?",
        "Q: Freedom of Information Act?\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: Freedom of Information Act.",
        "Q: You'll have to check that out, I can\u2019t answer that. What \u2014 you were so young, how did\nyou keep your emotional stability during those four weeks thinking you might be sent\nback? What \u2014 what gave you your inner strength to do that?",
        "A: Well, by taking things one day at a time and as long as I was here I felt I had a chance\nof staying here. I was \u2014 you know, I was hoping and I mean they were telling me that \u2014\nyou know, they have various Jewish organizations were working on it and they were\ndoing what they could. But if they wouldn\u2019t have, if it would have been up to State, they\nwould have sent me back. I have no doubt about that today, knowing what we know\ntoday. At the time, of course, we didn\u2019t know what the inner workings of \u2014 of mentality\nwas at the State Department.",
        "Q: So with all this uncertainty, putting your foot down on American soil was not a joyous\noccasion?",
        "A: Oh, it was a \u2014 it was a joyous occasion, I mean, well I \u2014 I thought it was sort of\nsymbolic that I only saw the back of the Statue of Liberty. You know, she turned her\nback on me, but I see humor in almost anything. But wha-what was also interesting was\nthat we were in the same complex with the Germans, the Bund Germans and Italians who\nwere considered enemy aliens. Well, wha \u2014 wa \u2014 wa \u2014 at least these were \u2014 the Bund\nGermans \u2014 America was still at peace with Germany, but they were \u2014 they were\nactivists who were interned on Ellis Island. They walked \u2014 we walked from 11 to 12 and\nMarch 16, 2001\nthey walked from 10 to 11. And we were separated by a \u2014 a fence, you know, by\nwhatever, a metal fence. But they were, and we were \u2014 we were treated like \u2014 well,\ncounted like prisoners when we walked from the \u2014 from the sleeping facilities to the\ndining hall, there was a guard clicking, counting. They \u2014 we had bunk beds, men only,\nyou know, in a huge \u2014 they were prison conditions, but I mean, it was \u2014 it was better than\nin Berlin, you know, and the food was better, and I mean, we knew that \u2014 you know,\nthere were no abuses or whatever. But we were \u2014 we lived a regimented life, you know.\nOne hour a day \u2014\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "Q: \u2014 volunteer collection interview with Kurt Roberg. This is tape number four, side B.\nWe were talking about the conditions in Ellis Island.",
        "A: It was a detention center and you know, it was \u2014 as I say, the food was good, we were\nkept occupied. The various Jewish organizations came in to, you know, give us material\nfor crafts, leatherwork, which I did. Drawing, you know, things you wanted to do. So, it\nwas nice, but we had to stay in the great hall, that was our living room. That\u2019s where\neverybody hung out, not by choice. And at the gong of the bell you\u2019d go into the dining\nroom and at the gong of the bell you\u2019d go into the sleeping quarters. And I \u2014 you know, it\nwas a regimented life, but well, look what we came from and what we \u2014 what we found\nhere. It was heaven, you know. And so it was \u2014 it was all right. Wasn\u2019t very \u2014 July \u2014\nMarch 16, 2001\nJune, July \u201941 was a very hot summer so we were \u2014 were \u2014 there was no air conditioner,\nof course, but at least out on the water, surrounded by water was cooler than anywhere\nelse. My mother would come on Sundays to visit and oh, the subway is so hot and I had\nno idea what that meant.

        "Q: What was your last day there like?",
        "A: Well, the last \u2014 I guess they had an \u2014 we had another hearing. My \u2014 when I could pack\nup, that was great. Now, was \u2014 was a \u2014 I guess it was a week, that was a Tuesday, so my\n\u2014 my uncle, m \u2014 one of my mother\u2019s other sisters who had spent the \u2014 well, a year and a\nhalf in London during the blitz, they came over here in 1940 and had an apartment in\nWashington Heights and I stayed \u2014 I stayed with them, because we didn\u2019t \u2014 my mother\nwasn\u2019t \u2014 had a job in New Rochelle as a sleep in ma \u2014 the housekeeper. And he picked\nme up. He picked me up and I came into \u2014 I \u2014 into the subway, down \u2014",
        "Q: When you left Ellis Island, then you were truly free from all of this government\nregulations, was that a special experience, just to walk out onto a sidewalk, knowing that\nyou don\u2019t have any more restrictions?",
        "A: Yes, yes, I think I \u2014 well, we \u2014 we \u2014 we got off the ferry boat at the \u2014 at \u2014 at the\nbattery and it was a \u2014 it was a \u2014 well, it was a great new world, I really don\u2019t think that I\nspent so much on, y-you know, trying to analyze my feelings other than being\noverwhelmed by, you know, the physicality of New York, and of course New York, the\nMarch 16, 2001\ndowntown then was the center of business and here was the \u2014 you know, the courthouse\nand \u2014 well, 17 Battery Place was a very tall building then, and I don\u2019t know how much\nyou know, but I\u2019m very familiar with that, I spent a lot of time later in that part of New\nYork. So it was, you know, Bowling \u2014 Bowling Green. We walked bif \u2014 Bowling\nGreen to the subway and we took the IRT and of course, well \u2014",
        "Q: Ho-How was your English then? Did you know any English?",
        "A: I had \u2014 I had learned some English in Holland. My English \u2014 I could speak some\nEnglish. My problem was in understanding it because I would, at that point, translate it\ninto Dutch. So by the time I had translated it, the other person speaking to me was three\nsentences further. You know, I mean, this is the \u2014 you know a language when you start\nthinking in it. And so that was really m \u2014 that \u2014 that took couple of months. But I \u2014 I\nremember the first impression of New York is that th \u2014 I \u2014 I s \u2014 seeing black people\nreally dressed up gaudily, you know. Big lips with lipstick and you know, make-up, and\nyou know the \u2014 I mean, people in Europe didn\u2019t do that. My God, 1s this really ex \u2014 an\nexotic country. And d \u2014 you know, all the \u2014 the noise and then well, then we got into the\nsubway, and of course I had seen movies, American movies in Holland, you know, we \u2014\nwe saw American movies, lot of cowboy movies and \u2014 you know, of New York, you\nknew what the skyline was like and \u2014 and Broadway, 42\" Street was Broadway, right?\nSo we came \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 my uncle and aunt lived on 171\u201c Street, so we took the train to\n168\" Street, Medical Center, right? Took the elevator up, I was impressed, my God, I \u2014\nMarch 16, 2001\nwe had fun, I took the elevator up. And come out and here all these low buildings, except\nfor Medical Center, I see \u2014 the first sign I see is Broadway. This is Broadway? Where\nare all the tall buildings? You know, the only \u2014 the first thing I saw, there was in\nWashington Heights, and I don\u2019t know how well you remember that, was a Johnny\nWalker \u2014 a huge advertising sign with Johnny Walker walking, it was a \u2014 it was an\nanimated sign. I said, oh, they have this \u2014 this great sign, but where the tall buildings? If\nthis is Broadway, I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I thought all of Broadway was that way. So that was my\nreally first impression of Broadway, and its disappointment. But I caught up.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and then what happened?",
        "A: Well, then I \u2014 I settled in with my uncle and aunt. I had to get a job, so first I had to\nget a Social Security card. In America you need a Social Security card. To get a Social\nSecurity card and work full time you have to be 18, otherwise you have to go to school. I\nwas done with school. I couldn\u2019t afford to go to school any more.",
        "Q: Financially, you mean.",
        "A: Financially, right. So I went to \u2014 and on advice of my cousin, my relatives they had \u2014\nthey were already in America for three years, my cousin. They came here in 1937 from\nPalestine. You \u2014 you have to tell them you\u2019re 18. So suddenly I was a year older, I was\n18 and I got a Social Security card, and \u2014",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t have to show any papers showing your age?\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: In America? What papers? No. They took my word for it. I li \u2014 I learned to lie in\nAmerica. In Germany you didn\u2019t dare lie, everything was on record. And I got a job, my\ncousin who was a salesman, got me a job within a week. I had to work. I worked \u2014 got\nme a job in a place called Jersey City. Jersey City, New Jersey, a job for 12 dollars a\nweek. I didn\u2019t know that they were paying \u2014 yeah, the minimum wage law had just been\npassed, which was 35 cents an hour, 40 hours, 14 dollars. They were paying me 12. You\nknow, I was a greenhorn just off the boat and in order to get the job as an upholsterer, I\nhad to buy a hammer, a magnetic hammer, which you put into your m \u2014 you \u2014 you\u2019ve\nnever \u2014 obviously you have never done any upholstery work. You have a box of blue\ntacks. You dip your magnetic hammer into it, it picks up nails. You swallow \u2014 you put\nthem into your mouth, you don\u2019t swallow them, and then you feed the hammer one at a\ntime with the tack. I learned that pretty quick but in order to do that you need your own\npersonal hammer. You don\u2019t want to li \u2014 lick anybody else\u2019s hammer, right? So before I\nhad the job I already had to invest a dollar and a quarter in a hammer, okay? But that\u2019s\nAmerica. So, I had this job for a week, I got paid 12 dollars. In the meantime my cousin\nhad lined up a better job for me cause I \u2014 well, I had | \u2014 trained as a \u2014 as an auto\nmechanic but they said can\u2019t get a job in New York as an auto mechanic, pump gas.\nThey don\u2019t pay minimum wage for that. So he got me a job in the machine shop for 14\ndollars and I worked in the machine shop for 14 dollars. And I we \u2014 stayed there til I\nMarch 16, 2001\nwent into the army. I became foreman, I ran the place. I was very good and he got a very\ngood deal, even for whatever he paid me at the time, I mean \u2014",
        "Q: Did you feel like an outsider, or were you totally accepted by the other men you were\nworking with?",
        "A: No, I\u2014 well, I f\u2014 I was accepted, but everybody knew that I was Dutch. There was a\nGerman worker there. I had n \u2014I wanted no identity with Germany whatsoever. First \u2014 I\nmean, first of all because I wanted to shed all of that and Holland was a lot closer to me\nemotionally than Germany. And people here in amer \u2014 in New York, in America didn\u2019t\nunderstand the difference between a German Jew and a German. You are German, you a\nGerman. Are you a Jew, or are you a German? They didn\u2019t understand. There was one\nfellow there, he worked in the shop who was German, he came here during the 1920\u2019s, a\nGerman, you know, Gentile. And he spoke German with me and I spoke German with\nhim. But I s-sort of \u2014 fractured German I spoke with him. And he would say, you know,\nyour German is awfully good for being a Dutchman. I said, well look, my parents were\nGerman, we spoke German at home, that\u2019s how I \u2014 and I didn\u2019t lie, we did speak German\nat home and my parents were German born, right? So I didn\u2019t lie. Said, but I am Dutch,\nbecause inside, I was Dutch. And \u2014",
        "Q: What happened on December 7\", 1941?",
        "A: On December 7\", 1941, im \u2014 we had gotten our lift to America. We had sent our lift\nvan that I told you 1t was m-made in \u2014 in Bremen and we had it sent, my mother had it\nMarch 16, 2001\nsent to Rotterdam and then from Rotterdam to America before they left, so our\nfurniture, everything was in America, and then when they got here, my parents, we\nstored the furniture in the basement of my aunt\u2019s apartment house in Washington\nHeights, made a deal with the superintendent and for like what, 10 dollars a month or\nsomething like that, in one of the storerooms, our furniture. So every Sunday, when my\nmother came from New Rochelle, we spent in the basement seeing to it that \u2014 spraying\nroach stuff and whatever, that we wouldn\u2019t get any roaches into the furniture, into the\nmattre \u2014 into whatever. And then they \u2014 you know, there were all sorts of bugs, we were\ntold, in America, you know, like \u2014 um \u2014 s-so anyway, housekeeping. On December\nseventh, which was a Sunday, we were in the basement. At this point I had already\nbought a radio, of course, to ma \u2014 so that I would learn English. And went to a lot of\nmovies on Saturday morning for 17 cents, to learn English. That\u2019s how you learned\nEnglish. And then as \u2014 Sunday we were in the basement, when about 2:30 we heard about\nthe sneak attack on Pearl Harbor and then we heard Roosevelt, so I know exactly where\nI was. And we were \u2014 well, we were glad.",
        "Q: Glad about what?",
        "A: We were glad that now America was forced to enter the war, on the English side,\nbecause Roosevelt was, of course, fighting that battle for a long time. And to us it was a\nstep in the right direction. And well \u2014 my brother tried to volunteer for the service. They\nsaid, you can\u2019t volunteer, you\u2019re not a citizen. But you can be drafted. And well, I\u2014 so he\nMarch 16, 2001\nwent into the service in \u201943 and I went into the service. And he went in May and I went in\nJuly of 43. And well, I had gotten several deferments because I worked in a war central\nplant in the machine shop, we were making parts for aircraft engines and stuff. But after\nthree deferments, I \u2014 they said you have to go. And well, my \u2014 I was \u2014 I was eager to go.\nI wanted to fight Hitler. And now I think I was one of the more motivated people\ncertainly in the ou \u2014 in my outfit. You know, everybody went because they were drafted.\nI went because I knew what I was fighting for, so it\u2019s \u2014 I didn\u2019t mind. But then, of course,\nthe outfit that I trained with went to Europe eventually, but our commanding officer said\nno German born personnel can go. So they pulled all the German refugee boys out and\nthey shipped us to the Pacific.",
        "Q: Are these German Jewish refugee \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: When you were with those young men, did you talk about your backgrounds and\nexchange stories?",
        "A: Yes, you knew where \u2014 you know, where you from, you know, what\u2019s your\nhometown, yes.",
        "Q: Did you feel a special connection to these young men?",
        "A: Yes. And especially in the army there were a lot of prejudices, you know, so I found\nout. Against Jews. And the sergeant major in the outfit I was in, who was an anti-Semite\nsaw to it that my papers \u2014 I was \u2014 when you are in the service you should \u2014 you know,\nMarch 16, 2001\nyou \u2014 you would become a \u2014 a citizen. I mean, normally it took five years to become a\ncitizen. In the service within 90 days you could become a citizen. The papers had to be\nput through, I mean, you n \u2014 on the theory you\u2019re good enough to fight for the country,\nyou're pledging allegiance, etcetera. And they couldn\u2019t send you overseas unless you\nwere a citizen. Anyway, he held back the papers and screwed it up so when the outfit was\nalerted to go overseas, my papers weren\u2019t ready. And the \u2014 whatever excuses he gave, but\nI mean \u2014",
        "Q: Did he do this with all the other German Jewish young men?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but none of them \u2014 he was the one in my \u2014 in my battalion. They w \u2014\nyou know, the others were not in my battalion, they were in other outfits, but we were in\nthe same [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So what did you think? Here you come to the United States and you\u2019re experiencing\nanti-Semitism again. What \u2014 what did you feel about that?",
        "A: Well, I think I learned as I came to Holland that there was \u2014 even in Holland \u2014 but\nthat everywhere in the world there 1s anti-Semitism, you know? When you had a church,\na Catholic church which preached until 20 years ago that the Jews killed Christ and this\nwas conveyed directly to the Irish, Italian and other predominantly Catholic societies,\nthere were \u2014 there was, you know, anti-Semitism was preached, you know, and look, we\ncertainly knew that in \u2014 in Germany, before Hitler there was anti-Semitism and that\nthere was anti-Semitism \u2014 I mean, in Holland I joined a Zionist organization because \u2014 I\nMarch 16, 2001\nmean in \u2014 in Celle we couldn\u2019t do much about it, but in principle we were \u2014 you know,\nlet\u2019s say zine \u2014 Zionist oriented. When I came to Holland, of course Harry was there\nalready and he belonged to a Zionist group, youth group and we would go to meetings.\nWe'd go on bike outings and we had meetings and speakers and all that. And these were\nyoung people, and you know, we \u2014 we learned, which was the Zionist dogma of the day\nthat you know, there\u2019s anti-Semitism everywhere and Jews cannot truly assimilate\nbecause it takes someone who wants to assimilate, which is the Jew, and someone who\nlets you assimilate, which is the non-Jewish society and they are not about to. So, you\nknow, I knew that, and thi \u2014 it was true in America, and you know, we \u2014 we heard and\nlearned that well, you can \u2014 that in certain businesses and banks you can\u2019t \u2014 you know,\nyou can\u2019t go into the banking business, you can\u2019t go into the \u2014 at the time, that that was \u2014\nthose were businesses or professions where Jews were not welcome.",
        "Q: At that time, or around that time, did you ever consider going to Palestine, or\neventually settling in Palestine?",
        "A: No, not really. Well, we had \u2014 as I say, my cousin tried \u2014 no, they went to Palestine\nbecause it was, you know, it was a way out of Germany, but we knew that Palestine was\nhard work and very physical and we were no \u2014 we were in a \u2014 we were in America and\nwe really didn\u2019t consider Palestine as a\u2014 as a\u2014 as a very pliable option. We were here.\nAnd you know, being \u2014 as a family, we could have never functioned there, and we were\nnot going to strike out on our own, let\u2019s say, my brother and I, go to Palestine, leave my\nMarch 16, 2001\nmother and my father here. My father died in October \u201942, and may \u2014 he really never\nrecovered from the aftereffects of the concentration camp, really. So, you know, weren\u2019t\ngoing to leave my mother by herself, you know, I mean it\u2019s just never \u2014 never entered our\nmind. The same when I came back from the service, you know, I could have done other\nthings, but I\u2014 you know, we \u2014 we \u2014 we were family oriented and you know, there was an\nobligation, a family loyalty and would have never considered, you know, picking up and\ngoing elsewhere.",
        "Q: So where were you sent when you were in the army?",
        "A: Well, first I went from New York, Camp Upton, to Camp Adair Oregon, I trained\nthere. From Oregon we went as a \u2014 as a unit the whole division moved to Fort Leonard\nWood, Missouri. And from Fort Leonard Wood, really, the \u2014 by this time it was 1944,\nthe division was alerted and went to Europe and they pulled us out and sent us to the\nPacific. So I went \u2014 I went to the Pacific on New Year\u2019s Day, 1945. Ended up in New\nCaledonia, entered a stray artillery battalion. If you read, \u201cTales of the South Pacific,\u201d\nthat was us. A stray battalion up in the hills of New Caledonia, away from everything\nuntil we got a new commanding officer. The worst possible combination you could have.\nThe rank that the com \u2014 command called for was lieutenant colonel. He was a major, so\nhe \u2014 he was a Jewish West Pointer, so he had to prove all sorts of things, and was he\neager to get that, you know, those colonel \u2014 that \u2014 that \u2014 colonel\u2019s \u2014 you know, own \u2014 so\n\u2014 well, I\u2019m happy to say that it worked out fine. We \u2014 we missed the invasion of\nMarch 16, 2001\nOkinawa and we missed the invasion of the Philippines. We got to the Philippines\nfairly late in the game. And then the war ended on August eighth.",
        "Q: Wa-Was your life ever in danger at that time?",
        "A: Yeah, yes it was, because of \u2014 well, the way the army runs. See, since we were in the\n\u2014 for instance, in the Philippines there were a lot of Japanese in the \u2014 in the hills. They\nwere pretty desperate because they were starving, you know, Americans were \u2014 but the\nisland was officially declared secured. Therefore, under army regulations, we were not\nissued any live ammo. But we would go out on exercises, we call them. And I was in the\nartillery, so they would send us out as forward observers. You go up ahead of the\ninfantry, ahead of everybody. Now, since I\u2019m the person that doesn\u2019t like to take chances,\nI had seen to it that I had a few clips of ammunition that I had forgotten to turn in, just for\ninsurance. And now we were \u2014 we were out on a\u2014 on a mission at night and we had a\nyoung lieutenant with us, someone we referred to as a shaved hair, that was second\nlieutenant just out of boot camp and whatever. And well, we camped for the night, strictly\ntactical and then he \u2014 we heard things moving around out there. And we were \u2014 we didn\u2019t\nknow what it was or who it was, but you have to assume that it is the enemy, right? I had\npassed the word to my two other colleagues that I had ammo, so we felt relatively\ncomfortable. But the lieutenant didn\u2019t know, and he also had no ammo. So he said, do\nyou think \u2014 do you think those are Japs? Lieutenant, we don\u2019t know, but when we find\nout we could probably arm wrestle them. So, you know, we found out that they had only\n99March 16, 2001\nraided our supply depot, the Japanese, they \u2014 they were hungry, they didn\u2019t want to fight.\nMaybe on a full stomach they would have felt like fighting, but \u2014 so you know, it\u2019s these\nlittle incidents, but otherwise \u2014\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\n100March 16, 2001\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Kurt Roberg. This is tape number five, side A, and you were\ntalking about being in the service and \u2014 and when did you leave the service? Or what\nhappened after you were in the \u2014 in the Pacific?",
        "A: Well, after \u2014 aft-after we \u2014 we won the war over there too, I \u2014 incidentally I \u2014 I was in\ntouch with my original outfit, which was in Europe, in Germany, and I would get letters\nand I still have the correspondence. My mother saved all mine and my brother\u2019s letters.\nAnd I\u2019ve \u2014 you know, they hoped that they wouldn\u2019t have to come to the Pacific after\nthey finished the war in Germany and help fight there and well, they were actually, they\nwere \u2014 they were trained to go for the invasion of Japan and all. Well, it didn\u2019t come to\npass, thank heaven. I was in the Philippines until March \u00b046, and then came home, was\ndischarged on April ninth and re-entered civilian life. I went back to my original job,\nwhich of course he had to take me back. But I couldn\u2019t see being a mish \u2014 tool and die\nmaker. So I wanted to get into business, I wanted to go to school, I wanted to you know,\npick up my life and make up for lost time. And \u2014 and I did. I found myself a new job in\nthe import export business, which was booming then. And I went back to school to get\nmy \u2014 well, pass the Regents in all the things that you have to do in New York. That was\nvery interesting too, I had submitted my records. I had all my German and Dutch records\nand they said, well you have to submit them to Albany, to the department of Regents.\n101March 16, 2001\nAnd then they sent them back, they said, they\u2019re in German. Yeah, they\u2019re in German,\nwhat do you expect in Germany, they write the records in German. But you\u2019re the\ndepartment of education, you mean you cou \u2014 oh no, you have to translate those. Well,\nyou \u2019ve been in the educational field and you know what it\u2019s like. So that gave me a\npreview of coming attractions. Well, I did get them translated and I \u2014 you know, they told\nme what I needed to complete my American education, and I did, and I passed the\nRegents and had a like 89 average.

        "A: I can di\u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 after being in the army\u2019?",
        "A: Yes, I\u2014I went \u2014 I went back to high school, and I went to Stuyvesant High School.\nNot that I knew of the reputation of Stuyvesant High School, but it was closest to where\nI worked on \u2014 I worked on Sixth Avenue and 20 Street and Stuyvesant was on 15\"\nStreet, on Second Avenue. So I walked over at night and you don\u2019t think I was going to\nblow a nickel each way to \u2014 to \u2014 I needed the money. And I finished high school and then\nentered City College, I guess in the spring of \u201948, on a \u2014 well, you know, I was fully\nmatriculated at that point, so I didn\u2019t need the G.I. bill. I could have taken the G.I. bill\nand gone anywhere. I could have gone to the Sorbonne, you know, but I didn\u2019t think that\nway. I wanted to be home near my mother and my family and that\u2019s how we were\n102\nMarch 16, 2001\nbrought up, you don\u2019t sponge off the government. So they \u2014 they paid for my books, and\nI\u2014",
        "Q: So you worked during the day and went to school at night?",
        "A: Oh, of course, yes. I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t even know that they had school during the day.\nWell, and yes, I chose \u2014 I chose to go to s \u2014 to work during the day, make an honest\nliving and went to school at night. And I \u2014 well, found a new \u2014 I got a new job after a\nyear in the export business. I knew enough about business that I wanted to change into\nsomething else. Taught myself how to type and I got into a lot of interesting experience\nin banking, 1n letters of credit and dealing with shipping companies. I spent a lot of time\ndowntown in the Wall Street area. It was very educational. When I felt I couldn\u2019t learn\nanything any more, I quit and I got a job with a friend of mine who had asked me to join\nhis young, growing company. And this was the man who came out of the concentration\ncamp with my father, Hans Solomon(ph), who had made it to America via Shanghai\nwith his wife and young daughter. Waited for their visas, American visas in Shanghai,\ncame here in 1940. And he was too old to go \u2014 I guess he was about 38 at the time, too\nold to go into the service and he built a \u2014 started his own business in 1945 and then asked\nme to come join him and I did in 1948, I guess. \u201947. And I was with him for 10 years and\nI was credit manager and I majored in accounting at City College for awhile, before I\nwent into marketing and management. And I started \u2014 went into sales, into marketing,\nmerchandising. And after 10 years with him I went \u2014 joined another company to set up a\n103\nMarch 16, 2001\nphotographic division for them, and became vice president of photo products and I was\nwith them for 32 years. So I don\u2019t \u2014 after that I didn\u2019t move around much any more.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and personally, your personal life?",
        "A: Personally, I \u2014 well, I\u2014 I found a very attractive young lady during my travels in\nSouth America, in Caracas, Venezuela. And she happened to be of German origin and\nshe came to New York and we got married in 1957.",
        "Q: G-German Jewish, or German \u2014",
        "A: No, German not Jewish, I \u2014 and well, that\u2019s an \u2014 that\u2019s a separate story that I don\u2019t\nwant to get into now because it\u2019s rather complex. But she became Jewish, converted and\nwe have a family, two children, a daughter who was born in 1959, my son in 1962. And\nwe had a good life. My wife, well, started contract \u2014 well, suffered from cancer, and she\ndied in 1989. And that\u2019s about the story. I retired in 1989, six months after she died. I had\nplanned on it anyway, but \u2014 unfortunately without her, but well, 1-1n the meantime of\ncourse, we lived in New Y \u2014 we lived in New York when we first got married. We\nmoved to Riverdale and then in \u2014 in Riverdale into a co-op and then when my daughter\nInez became of school age, we decided to leave New York and head for the wide open\nspaces of New Jersey. And we ended up in Tenafly because it had a school system we\nliked, and I\u2019ve lived there ever since. I\u2019m now in Tenafly 36 years.\n104\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "Q: Can we talk a little bit now about some of your thoughts and your feelings? Do you\nthink you would have been a different person today if you had not gone through the\nchildhood that you had?",
        "A: Yes, I would \u2014 I would be \u2014 my plans \u2014 I \u2014 I wanted to be an architect. I did a lot of\ndrawing, I\u2019m good at drawing, I enjoy drawing. I sketched houses, designed houses, I had\nam \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 well, have good manual dexterity. Channeling that as a result of the, what\nwas called in Germany, umschulung. That means converting to swi \u2014 switching your\neducation, really. So literally translated, switching your education into something quote\nunquote, practical. And \u2014 oh, well \u2014 or \u2014 I wanted architecture or interior design, and my\nexpert family in America, of course, interior design, in America nobody uses that. Learn\nsomething practical. So, when I came to Holland, what\u2019s more practical in America than\ncars, right? And I was interested in automobiles too, so that \u2014 so I chose what \u2014 we were\nsort of trained or oriented toward a nonacademic life.",
        "Q: What about personally, personality-wise? Do you think your personality would have\nbeen different if you hadn\u2019t had the challenging childhood that you did?",
        "A: No, I think it\u2019s been a m \u2014 it has been a good \u2014 I\u2014I can only see it as a good affect,\nwhether everybody agrees with me, I m\u2014 m \u2014 some people think that I\u2019m too \u2014 well, I\u2019m\na \u2014 I\u2019m a product of the 1930\u2019s environment. I think we have the same thing in America,\nyou know, people are products of the ba \u2014 depression era. We are oriented toward\npracticality, economy, frugality, etcetera, and of course my German background m \u2014 of\n105March 16, 2001\ncertainly m-me \u2014 German Jewish background, the emphasis in Germany is, I think\neverywhere in Jewish circles was education, you know? The saying was always,\nespecially if you move around, as the Jews have for hundreds of years, you \u2014 what you c\n\u2014 what you carry in your \u2014 you don\u2019t carry heavy in what\u2019s 1n your head, however that\ntranslates, you know. And so we were always oriented toward learning and well, I think\nthat is probably the basis of my [indecipherable] and planning ahead, I think. Planning,\nhaving a structured life rather than living out into the w-wild. But I think that\u2019s a matter\nof personality, I don\u2019t know whether that is any background. By the same token my wife,\nwho grew up in wartime Germany, and she was five years younger, so she had to leave\neastern Germany when the Russians came, as a small child. Her father by that time had\ndisappeared. Mother was left with two children, and the stories of, you know, the\nRussians coming, raping, killing, burning, whatever, they, you know, they took off. They\nleft with the last train. They were able to save themselves, they lost everything. And she,\nsince childhood really never wanted to own anything because she didn\u2019t want to go\nthrough what her mother had gone, having to leave everything behind. So Connie was\nreally very much oriented toward enjoying things. She said, I don\u2019t have to own\npaintings, P\u2019Il be very happy to see them in a museum. I don\u2019t want to own anything. I\ndon\u2019t want to \u2014 you know. So the different people are affected differently by the same set\nof circumstances. And so, if we put the finger on what causes certain developments, or\ndevelopmental trends, I think you can read a lot into conditions that you want to read into\n106March 16, 2001\nit. And you know, psychologists are so busy trying to come up with formulas of what\nhappens why. I\u2019m not a great believer in that.",
        "Q: You had said earlier, you \u2014 you\u2019ll never forget the smell when your father came back.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Any other sounds or smells or sights that remind you of those previous years? Any\nother ones.?",
        "A: Well, I think that we associate certain things, pleasant or unpleasant with first time\nexperiences. I think that\u2019s a common human thing. Whether this is sounds, noises, music\nwe hear under certain circumstances for the first time, you know. A \u2014 a song that we \u2014\nthat we hear for the first time under romantic conditi \u2014 it sticks. So I think that\u2019s just a\nhuman phenomena that ham \u2014mi \u2014 I mean, they \u2014 the smell, yes, it was \u2014 1t was very\nvivid, but I think that is like the question you asked, do you know where you were on\nPearl Harbor day or on the day Kennedy was assassinated, okay? So the day my father\ncame back from the concentration camp and the smell, and the way he looked is a\nlandmark impression, whether I was a child at the time, or whether it was when Kennedy\nwas assassinated and I was a man, you know, we were \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t think we should\nseparate that into either childhood or adulthood. I think it happens and it\u2019s lasting, or it\nisn\u2019t, So \u2014",
        "Q: What were your thoughts during the Eichmann trial?\n107March 16, 2001",
        "A: Get the bastard. During the Eichmann trial, well, I followed 1t with much interest.\nMatter of fact, I have the tape at home that I think I saw on PBS had a extensive \u2014 I have\na whole collection of wartime tapes and this is part of my library, it\u2019s where my interests\nlie, his \u2014 historical. Not only war, but of course, World War II was to me a very personal\nand historic event that I lived through and that I can identify with. But the Eichmann\ntrial was very \u2014 well, how should I say? Whatever goes around comes around, you know,\nthat \u2014 well, A, the Israelis did what they did to bring him back and to expose him for\nwhat he was. And also I\u2019ve seen enough of Nazi Germans, you know, in South America.\nI\u2019ve traveled in South America and I know that they were hiding and are still hiding and\nhave been hiding and that they were hiding in Argentina and Venezuela and Columbia.\nAnd, you know, ab \u2014 everywhere and that they got away \u2014 they got away with it and that\nthere is a clique that exists to this day.

        "Q: Do you feel very American today, very assimilated into American society? Do you\nfeel you really belong here?",
        "A: Oh absolutely. I feel it, I belong here. I mean, this 1s \u2014 this is my country, I spent most\nof my life here. I think I\u2019ve paid my dues. I \u2014 and \u2014 however, I have not given up on my\nlet\u2019s say, continental upbringing. I value \u2014 I like to think that I have the best of two\nsocieties. The European, which I have \u2014 I certainly was old enough at age 14, since I had\na good schooling, to take the best of that and take the best of the American and when it\ncomes to well, manners, attitudes, child education, child rearing, my wife and I brought\nup our children the way we were brought up. I mean, we didn\u2019t beat them up or anything,\nbut we \u2014 there was no great permissiveness either. They learned to eat with good table\nmanners. There were no different manners at home than when you go to a restaurant. So\nif we went to a restaurant with our children, from a very young age people would\ncomment, oh how well behaved are your children. You know, a restaurant was just\nanother place where to eat and there was no differ \u2014 what I\u2019m saying is that education\nstarts with the parents, and we felt we sh \u2014 we want to give them an education that\npleases us and ultimately will please them. And so the parts of American society that I\nplan, that I \u2014 that we chose to ignore was, for instance, the lapses in child education that\nwe saw, our view. And we\u2019re very happy with the results. Yeah, go ahead.\n109\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "Q: Wh-When your children were the age that you were, for instance when herb \u2014 Hitler\nfirst came into power in the rest of the 1930\u2019s and early 40\u2019s, did that make you think of\nyour childhood, when they were that age that you were at the time, you know, nine, 10 -\n11 - 12 - 13, did that remind you of what you were doing at that time?",
        "A: Not directly, but I will say that, you know, I\u2019m into sports and I \u2014 I played with my\nchildren in a very active way, which my father never did with us, but he was older. My\nfather was 38 when he married and plus that he was physically handicapped in a \u2014 by his\nsight. And other than that, I\u2014 you know, I \u2014 when \u2014 I think I always knew how a child\nfeels, whether the child is five years old, or eight, or 14, because I\u2019ve been there, and I\nremember. I remember what a child\u2019s emotions are, feelings, and I could identify with\nmy children at the various levels, my son more than with my daughter. I never had a \u2014\nyou know, I never had a sister, so that\u2019s \u2014 was a little touchier, but certainly with my son\n\u2014 and \u2014 but I never, I n \u2014 you know, I never did them, when I was your age, or you know,\nbit, the \u2014",

        "A: Well, no, I mean, that was \u2014 those were the facts, that was, you know, that doesn\u2019t \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t think that it influenced me or affected my \u2014 my life or my character or my \u2014 scarred\nme in \u2014 in any way. Of course, you know, people of my generation who went through the\ncamps, who saw unspeakable, you know, brutality, etcetera, that they had to react and\nthat it left scars, is beyond question. I was lucky 1n that the things that, well, I was\nexposed to were not, by and large, not traumatic enough, or I was able to deal with it\nbecause I, at the time, certainly in Berlin, all the things we saw, that I knew it was\ntemporary. I have a way out, I have a ticket to America. I have a way out, even though\nthat was very questionable, I always felt that I wasn't trapped over there.",
        "Q: Are you more religious, less religious than when you \u2014 what you were when you were\ngrowing up? How did it affect you in that sense?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t th \u2014 either way. I belong to a Reform congregation, by choice. I\u2019m\nconsidered, probably considered one of the more Conservative, but then the Reform\nmovement is going toward Conservative anyway, you know, it\u2019s not what it was 30 years\nago, Reform is no longer Reform. So no, I have no \u2014 I \u2014I don\u2019t think I\u2019m any more or\nless religious. I mean, the question of whether there is a God, you know, what does it\nreally mean is deeply philosophical, I don\u2019t think we should get into that. But my\nchildren are not religious. I don\u2019t particularly \u2014 well, I wish they were more oriented\n111March 16, 2001\ntoward being Jewish or feeling Jewish. They don\u2019t. But then, we gave \u2014 you know, those\nof us who give our children the freedom of decision making, we exposed them to\nJudaism, Jewish teachings. Unfortunately the Hebrew schools that they went to, while we\nthought they were excellent, turned them off rather than the other way, than inspired\nthem. The damage was done, they \u2014 they had the choice of, you know, or th \u2014 they have\nthe option of choosing and whatever they choose, what\u2019s important is they are good\npeople, they are decent human beings and that is what religion is supposed to do, in my\nview, 1s make decent people of everyone; the purpose of religion, one of the purposes of\nreligion. And that is the case, so I have no \u2014 I have no quarrel or problem with how they\nachieve their goodness, of being good. If they want to find religion, if later in their lives\nthey turn toward religion, as a lot of people do, so be it, you know, but I \u2014 I have no \u2014 no\nproblem with that. I mean, that\u2019s my view.\nEnd of Tape Five, Side A\nBeginning Tape Five, Side B",
        "Q: \u2014 volunteer collection interview with Kurt Roberg. This is si \u2014 tape five, side B.\nBecause you saw people deprived of their civil rights in \u2014 in Germany in the 30\u2019s, do\nyou think that makes you more sensitive, or did it make you more sensitive to the Civil\nRights movement here in the United States?",
        "A: More sensitive \u2014",
        "Q: Cause you actually saw it with your own eyes in Germany.\n112\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: Yes, I \u2014 well, I-I\u2019m certainly more aware of it, but I\u2019m also aware of the abuses and of\nthe limitations and it\u2019s interesting that I\u2019ve gone back to Germany many times and the\nchange I see in Germany today, the change toward democracy is really remarkable. I had\na very interesting experience. As a matter of fact I [indecipherable] I went back to my\nhometown, Celle on the anniversary of Crystal Night in \u201998, 50\" anniversary and\nparticipated in a \u2014 well, I really instigated a memorial service at the synagogue in Celle,\nand I went over there for that and I was the keynote speaker. And I'll be glad to send you\na copy of that speech. It was held in German, but I made a fairly accurate English\ntranslation for my congregation and for my friends. So Ill send you that, and you can put\nit into the records. But 1\u2014 I really \u2014 and I met with some of my former classmates for\nwhom I would vouch that they were not Nazis then or now. And it was a very interesting\nexperience and I think sort of telling. The \u2014 yeah, what went on under Hitler, how a lot\nof Germans who were, let\u2019s say scared into following the party line. Of course there was\na meal ticket too, that they didn\u2019t dare to go across the \u2014 against the party line because it\nmeant their livelihood. And I think there is really a lot of true democracy, especially in\nthe young people. We \u2014 we read about the skinheads, the anti-Semitism, etcetera. But just\nlike here, the good people don\u2019t make news, it\u2019s the bad people that make the news, and I\nthink in our society too, you hear about the killings of \u2014 you know, the teenagers that are\nshooting up our schools and all that, but you don\u2019t read about the good kids or the kids\nthat are scared. I met a little girl in Florida, she\u2019s 11 years old. There was a \u2014 well, talk\n113March 16, 2001\nabout a \u2014 an incident in school and she was scared and she asked her mother, I don\u2019t want\nto go to school today because there\u2019s gonna be trouble. You know, there are \u2014 so what\nI\u2019m saying 1s there\u2019s good and bad everywhere. We don\u2019t \u2014 we don\u2019t hear about the good\nkids, we only hear about the bad kids. And I think you as a \u2014 as an educator, know that\nthat is so. To condemn a whole generation or sector of the population because of a few, is\nunfair. Any time you generalize, it\u2019s unfair, or even inaccurate. What\u2019s his name,\nGoldhagen? Every German is guilty? I haven\u2019t read his book. I read the synopsis in the\n\u201cNew York Times\u201d book review and all that. I don\u2019t want to read his book. He can come\nwith statistics, but I don\u2019t think that every German down \u2014 deep down in his heart, felt\nanti-Semitic or was part \u2014 part-participated or wanted to participate. So he has a formula;\nthat formula too, is not accurate. I think you have to take people as individuals and that\u2019s\nwhat I try to do. They\u2019re good and they\u2019re not so good and they\u2019 re outright bad. And n \u2014\nthat has been \u2014 I mean, I made my peace with Germany in 19 \u2014 in the 1950\u2019s, when I\nwent back the first time on business with Hans Solomon(ph). We went back to\nGermany to try and do business in 1952. We went to the photo show in Cologne and we\nspent two weeks in Celle. Now he, being 15 years older than I, was there as an adult. He\nremem \u2014 knew a lot more people, and we looked up a lot of them and talked to them. Of\ncourse, in the 50\u2019s, nobody would know or admit that they knew anything. But we talked\nto people who said yes, we knew that Bergen-Belsen, which was 15 miles away from\nCelle, that 1t was there, but we didn\u2019t know what was going on. We \u2014 the man who was \u2014\n114\nMarch 16, 2001\nwho supplied meat there, he went in there every couple of weeks, driving a truck in there,\nsure he saw. But he was told these are foreign Zwangsarbeiter, forced labor. But that\nthey were systematically starved to death, or whatever, worked to death, he didn\u2019t know\nthat. Nobody \u2014 nobody knew that other than the guards and the guards didn\u2019t tell, because\nit was self-incriminating. He supplied meats, he supplied food. Hey, we\u2019re taking food in\nthere every week, you know. Whether \u2014 that this was only for the guards or whatever,\nnobody knew, right? So what I am \u2014 what I am saying is that we did talk about it. Ther-\nThere was a death march where people were marched from the railroad 15 miles to the\ncamp. And yes, some of the people saw it and even taunted the prisoners and whatever,\nyou know, on the death \u2014 that came out later. Yes, but those people aren\u2019t going to talk\nabout it or advertise it or admit it, even. They are the ones that say, we don\u2019t want to talk\nabout the past any more, we want to lo \u2014 but the young Germans, who now \u2014 I mean \u2014 I\nmean the new, young generation, whose grandparents were the perpetrators, participants\nor silent participants, they are now asking, why did you keep quiet? How could you k-\nkeep quiet? They don\u2019t understand how they could have \u2014 how their parents and\ngrandparents could have kept quiet. And it\u2019s very hard in the 1990\u2019s, or 2000, to\nunderstand what the mentality was 50 years ago unless, you know the zeitgeist of the era,\nwhat the fears were, what the attitudes were and why people kept quiet. Why people\ndidn\u2019t speak out. They were scared. The man I told you about who lived below us, the\npeople who helped us on Crystal Night, he was a high official at the court, the Supreme\n115\nMarch 16, 2001\nCourt. And he had the key for the ar \u2014 in \u2014 in the building, and up on \u2014 on the roof was a\nflag \u2014 you know, f \u2014 a \u2014a flagstaff. And when the Nazis took over, they went up there to\npull down the red, white and blue flag to hoist the Nazi flag. And who has the key?\nRusterfeld(ph) has the key, get Rusterfeld(ph), and they said, we want the key. I don\u2019t\nhave the key. Well, give us the key or we\u2019ll break down the door. So he rummaged and\nhe found the key. And as they stormed up there and up there, he was heard to mumble\nunder his breath, I hope they break their neck. Somebody heard it and he was indicted\nand \u2014 that he made this remark. He had enough friends in the court system that witnesses\ncame up and said oh no, you heard it wrong. He said, I hope they don\u2019t break their neck,\nbecause it was so dangerous to climb up there. They gave him the benefit of the doubt\nand he was permitted to retire earl \u2014 take early retirement, okay? Now, there were people\nlike that, okay? And he was watched from there on and he couldn\u2019t afford to make a\nwrong move, but he didn't permit his daughters to ever join the Nazi party, for the girl\nthey have the JungmAadel or whatever, the Hitler youth. He could have redeemed\nhimself to prove that he was not against them by saying I want you to join, even if it\u2019s\nonly pro forma. No, he stuck to his principles. There were people like that. So who\u2019s to\nsay who is good and who\u2019s bad?",
        "Q: Do you get reparations?",
        "A: I don\u2019t, no. My mother did, I don\u2019t. I got \u2014 yeah, I got a one time lump sum pre \u2014\nreparations because I was deprived of my education, which was, I think 5,000\n116\nMarch 16, 2001\ndeutschmark at the time, in 19 \u2014 in the early 50\u2019s, I think, under Adenauer. Nothing\nelse.",

        "A: No [indecipherable]",
        "Q: \u2014 talk about that we haven\u2019t, or any final comments that you\u2019d like to say?",
        "A: No, I really hadn\u2019t thought about any final comments, I just wanted to really put on\nrecord a firsthand, you know, witness account of how I came to this country and why I\ncame to this country and what the circumstances were because things are, when they are\nretold by people who have heard the story, it\u2019s often distorted, not intentionally, but just\nby repeating. And I would like it to go on record. I hope I have created a feeling of what\nthe spirit was, both in Holland and in Germany, what the mentality was of the Jews in\nCelle, certainly. Why they did what th \u2014 why we did what we did, and you know, like\nsome of them said, why do you stay so long? Why \u2014 you know, why didn't you leave\nearlier? I\u2019ve also, when we came to America, had people ask, you German Jews, why\ndidn\u2019t you fight back? Why k \u2014 you know, you should have fought the Nazis. It shows a\ntotal \u2014 comments like that at the time showed a total ignorance of what Nazi Germany\nwas all about. How they operated, how they functioned and I mean, there were \u2014 there\nwere people who fought back. They were hauled off to the concentration camp or shot on\nthe spot, you know. Known as 6fter(ph) flucht es schussen(ph). Shot while \u2014 you know,\nshot while trying to escape. Okay, so there \u2014 there was no th \u2014 they were gangsters. They\n117\nMarch 16, 2001\nwere \u2014 they didn\u2019t play by gentlemen\u2019s rules. I mean, if you see what \u2014 what \u2014 what \u2014\nwhat \u2014 what Hitler did to his own \u2014 to his own people whom he saw as threats, as rivals,\nas \u2014 you know, th-the Wurm(ph) affair. Anybody that \u2014 that was no longer convenient\nwas eliminated. How? How does the Mafia eliminate people, right? Yes. So, people who\nsay why didn't you fight back, there were people who fought back, but there was no way\nof beating a system where the government is the \u2014 where there is no government\nprotection, where there is no police that you can go to, where there\u2019s no one to \u2014 to \u2014 you\ncan appeal to for justice, for the right thing, for protection. No way of fighting that.",
        "Q: Do you feel more connection to Holland than you do to Germany\u201d",
        "A: No, I feel \u2014 I feel very comfortable with Germany now. People ask me \u2014 American\nJews ask me, how can you go back to Germany after all you \u2014 ve made my peace with\nGermany. They\u2019ve paid the price. They\u2019ve tried very hard to make up for \u2014 they\nrecognize today very much what they have done. They are, you know, I feel that what we\nknow today about the way the American government acted, the Roosevelt administration\nacted, of ignoring not only the Saint Louis affair, but the \u2014 you know, many other \u2014 look\nhow close did I come of being \u2014 not being accepted in. You know, I\u2019d like to find out.\nBut it wasn\u2019t all peaches and cream and not everything that was pretended, that the Jews\nwere a political pawn, that it was inconvenient to the American and British government\nto admit the to Palestine, that they wanted to s \u2014 you know, send them to Madagascar in\ntransit, right? The Jewish state of Madagascar and other faraway places where they\n118\nMarch 16, 2001\nwould be out of the way and not in the way of the Arab situation, the oil situation. So\nwhen you see all of that, it\u2019s not that one guy wears the black hat and the other guy wears\nthe white hat. Everybody wears a gray hat. Anyway.",

        "A: I was born in Germany in a town called Celle, which is the German pronunciation,\nspelled c-e- double I-e, near Hannover in northern Germany, on May 16\", 1924.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s a very interesting question and I will illustrate it by, well, telling you what\nhappened to me. I\u2014I went to a German school, as a matter of fact I was the only \u2014 during\nHitler time already, from 1934 to 1938 to Kristallnacht, I was the only Jewish student in\na Ss \u2014s \u2014 student body of about 280 in a high school that was a [indecipherable]\ngymnasium. One of the assignments we had \u2014 now thas \u2014 this was about 1936, and\nGermany of course was very, a-as we would say, a \u2014 a roots \u2014 you know, tracing your\nroots. They were interested in genealogy. So one of our assignments in social studies was\nMarch 16, 2001\nto trace our ancestry. How was I gonna trace my ancestry? My \u2014 I \u2014 ma \u2014 my mother\ncontacted her sister, a maiden sister who lived with my \u2014 in my mother\u2019s home village,\nand contacted my father\u2019s maiden sister, who lived in my father\u2019s home village, and they\nboth yeah, tried to do \u2014 trace our history. And Martha, which was the Roberg side of the\nfamily, got as far as great-grandfather, didn\u2019t get very far. And Aunt Babette(ph) of the\nMarx family, my mother\u2019s family near \u2014 in a village called Byetahl(ph) near Heidelberg\nwas much more successful. She first traced the history back to 1871, which was written\nup in the local \u2014 what do we call it in German? Standes amt, the local village registry.\nPrior to that, all births and deaths were, even of the Jewish community were inter \u2014\nentered in the church registry of the Catholic church. So she went to the priest and he, as\na favor, for 10 mark or so, wrote out our whole genealogy and we were able to trace the f\n\u2014 Marx family back to 1741. So I drew up a family tree based on this information. This\ntook about oh, a couple of months to get that all written out by hand, turning the pages in\nthe book and it became a matter of fascination for the priest himself. And I drew a\u2014a\nfamily tree, and I turned it in and it turned out that Roberg, the only Jew in the class,\ncould trace his ancestry in Germany back further than my 29 Christian stu \u2014 fellow\nstudents. And my teacher, who was very s-supportive, and nya \u2014 he was not a Nazi by\nany means, he made a point of it, to \u2014 yeah, tell the class that Roberg could trace his\nancestry back further than any of the German boys. So it\u2019s a longwinded answer to your\nvery brief question.\nMarch 16, 2001",

        "A: Yes, my mother. My parents got married in 1921 and my mother, of course, came into\nthe business. She had some sort of a dowry, which in those days was expected. I think it\nwas a marriage that was arranged. I\u2019m not sure, but I think it was through the newspaper,\nwhich was the customary way, rather than shotgun. And so that was the then modern\nMarch 16, 2001\nway. There was the \u2014 a newspaper, Jewish paper called Jiidische Familienblatt, the\nJewish Family paper, and there were marriage proposals or whatever and as we have\ntoday in some of the better United States papers, started from \u201cThe Village Voice\u201d on.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s name was Selma, but she was called Frieda. That\u2019s another story, but I\nwon\u2019t go into that now, and her maiden name was Marx, m-a-r-x.",
        "A: Yes, I have a \u2014 an older brother, Harry. He was Hans, Hans Werner, and I was\ncalled Walter. And he was called Hans and I was called Kurt.",
        "A: He\u2019s two and a half years older. He was then, and still is.",
        "A: On my mother\u2019s side there was a large family. She was one of six surviving siblings,\nbut none in the same town. They lived all over me \u2014 Germany, but they were all in close\n\u2014 in close touch with each other, there were weekly letters to everybody, and \u2014 including\nGrandma in \u2014 in Byetahl(ph). And so it was a very special \u2014 my \u2014 on my mother\u2019s side\nwas a close knit family. On my father\u2019s side less so, he and his \u2014 my father and his\nbrother were not on particularly good terms, and the maiden aunt, sister, which he was a\nMarch 16, 2001\n\u2014a family of three siblings, she lived in her parents\u2019 house in a little village called\nLemforde, I-e-m-f-o-umlaut-r-d-e near Osnabriick in northern Germany.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Ah, it\u2019s a good question. We were a small Jewish congregation, but rather distinct.\nCelle, as you may or may not know, is of historic significance in that it was a m \u2014 the seat\nof a duke, Herzog, the Duke of Brunswick-Ltineburg \u2014 Brunswick-Luneburg, and so\nit was a white collar community. Our synagogue in Celle was built in 1741 and is today\nthe on \u2014 the only surviving synagogue in northern Germany that was \u2014 well, it was\nvandalized of course, but that survived, it was not burned or destroyed. It was destroyed\nfrom the inside, but the building remains. It was during my time, had of course gone past\nits peak, people had started moving away after World War I. Some families moved to\nHannover, which was 40 kilometers. 25 miles away was the nearest large city, some\nmoved to Berlin. The remaining active members in the community were about a dozen\nfamilies. There were some Jewish people who were not active, they didn\u2019t attend\nservices. They, I guess were Jews by religion only, or th-they \u2014 the Germans so nicely put\nit, Jewish citizens of a Hebrew faith or persuasion. And that was by \u2014 by choice, they\nreally didn't want to be identified with the Jewish community per se, and that was their\nchoice. Give you an illustration, for \u2014 we only had services in our synagogue three times\nMarch 16, 2001\na year, on the high holidays, rush \u2014 you know, Passover and Rosh Hashanah and Yom\nKippur. Well, Simchas Torah was observed, and you know, but we had trouble getting a\nminyan together, of course, and we were, by German standards Conservative, not\nOrthodox, but the synagogue of course was built, like m-m-most German synagogues\nwith the women in \u2014 in the upper, on the balcony, whatever you call it, and the men\ndownstairs and only men counted for \u2014 yeah, for minyan. However, if you were 12 years\nold and you were gonna be Bar Mitzvahed the following year, you could already be\ncounted as a minyan man. So it was that kind of a thing, or if things got very tough and\nwe were nine, as a last resort they would say \u2014 we would send one of the boys, sometimes\nme, over to one of the non-observing Jews, one of them was Solomon \u2014 Solomon and\nsay \u2014 ask Solomon if hell come to minyan, you know, and then reluctantly and grumpily\nwould come and di \u2014 um, sit in for minyan.",
        "A: Observing or otherwise, maybe 12 or 14. I really haven\u2019t counted them, I can \u2014 but I\nhave \u2014 I have the records at home, I mean, I can make that available if you\u2019re interested.",
        "A: Well, we were traditionally observant. My mother came from a observant family,\nmeaning my grandmother kept milchig and fleishig separate. My father came from an\nOrthodox \u2014 well, an observant family. My father\u2019s family, it\u2019s a family of butchers,\nMarch 16, 2001\nkosher butchers, but I guess the scene at the turn of the 20\" century was really the \u2014 I\u2019m\nsure I\u2019m not telling you anything new, you know, the German Jewish community had\nbeen, well, had the opportunity for the first time to assimil \u2014 well, to try and assimilate or\nat least to practice by choice, and the tendency was away from \u2014 from religious\nobservations and to assimilate, to try and assimilate. So there were many Jews who felt\nprimarily as Germans of Jewish faith. And I guess we were \u2014 my father ate treyf\noccasionally, because when he traveled he couldn\u2019t observe all th \u2014 so as a \u2014 as a boy, as\na young man already, he stopped eating kosher as he did at home, and my mother the\nsame way when she got out into daily life, modified, and 1t was called new kosher, neu-\nkosher. New kosher meaning you would eat milk and meat mixed but no pork, and \u2014",
        "A: We were aware of Shabbat, but we were allowed to ride our bicycles, while on Rosh\nHashanah, Yom Kippur, we were not. So Shabbat was \u2014 it was a work day for us, we\ncouldn\u2019t afford to keep the store closed and I guess that sort of set the pattern.",
        "A: We were sympathetic \u2014 well, Zionism for us started in 1933 or \u201934. We \u2014 the\ncommunity, our congregation was too small to have a rabbi, but we did have a cantor\nwho was a retired schoolteacher and had a pension and he was the cantor and also our,\nwell, Hebrew teacher and he would officiate at all services, of course. And that was \u2014 but\nyou know, we \u2014 we didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t have a \u2014 a rabbi, per se.\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: German, what else? I mean, well, again, as you probably know, German Jews tried to\nma \u2014 be very low key, be as un-Jewish in appearance, not that we were ashamed or \u2014 you\nknow, of being Jews, we were conscious Jews, but we were Jews in religious observance,\nnot, you know, it was not an ethnic group other than by designation by the Germans. I\nmean, we were \u2014 we were aware of being Jews, and we wanted to be Jews, but I guess we\nhad no choice anyway, so \u2014",
        "A: N-No, that\u2019s a tough \u2014 I wa \u2014 we never really thought about it. We knew we \u2014 we \u2014\nwe knew we were nem \u2014 you know, German, we knew we were Jews, and of course,\nwell, consciously, wh-when Hitler came to power, it was in 1933, I was nine years old, I\nremember distinctly when I came to school. I started school in 1930. Before that I went a\nyear to kindergarten, I was four years old. And we were taught from small child on not to\nmake any, as it was known as rishiss(ph). Are you familiar with the \u2014 with the term\nrishiss(ph)?",
        "A: Yes. Rishass(ph) I think is a Hebrew word. It \u2014 it is to draw attention to \u2014 yeah, don\u2019t\nmake wave, don\u2019t make rishiss(ph) means don\u2019t \u2014 you know, don\u2019t draw attention to\nyour Jewishness. If \u2014 so if you did anything that would be disturbing to the Christian\ncommunity, if you flaunted your Jewishness, you would say that makes rishiss(ph).\nMarch 16, 2001\nRishass(ph) is, I think \u2014 I don\u2019t know what it is in Hebrew, but I \u2014 anyway. So we were \u2014\nwe were taught not to make waves, to conform, not to draw attention to ourselves by\nbeing obnoxious or obviously Jewish. Do the things that were ascribed by the Gentile\ncommunity as being typically Jewish.",
        "A: Be loud, be boisterous and you know, I mean, if you would see somebody with \u2014 with\n\u2014 with \u2014 with \u2014 with payos, obviously they\u2019re \u2014 and that \u2014 that was a Jewish trait. Or to\nwalk straight, to be \u2014 Jews were thought of as being non-athletic. My mother was very\nproud that we excelled in sports, my brother and I, and it was part of our \u2014 well, that we\nbelonged, we were as good as they were. And well, it was odd that even my brother and I,\nduring you know, Hitler times in high school, were allowed to participate in sporting\nevents which in many other cities, Jews were no longer allowed to participate. And I\nremember Harry, my brother, Hans got a gold oak leaf and \u2014 with some event we \u2014 we\nhad \u2014 from \u2014 from our school we had the sports event and I got a bronze even \u2014 oak leaf.\nNow, I must also tell you that on crystal \u2014 the night \u2014 yeah, Crystal Night, or the day \u2014\nthe morning after Crystal Night, when we found out, you know, what had happened in\ntown, our apartment was not searched or destroyed or what, but we expected that maybe\nthe Gestapo or city police would come and search the house. And we got rid of \u2014 my\nmother got rid of anything that would be intimidating, like foreign currency wi \u2014 my\nmother had a few British pounds, Palestinian pounds th \u2014 that her sister had brought back\nMarch 16, 2001\nfrom Palestine in 1934, and the oak leaves that Harry and I had earned, because if they\nwould come in and say \u2014 see that we had oak leaves, maybe the feeling was, what are you\ntrying to prove, you Jew bastards? You know. So she got rid of it, not to antagonize the\npolice should they come, and should they find this and question it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Of course I did, to this day.",
        "A: Well, I \u2014 swimming, but I was best in gymnastics, you know, which was the high bar,\nparallel bars, rings, that sort of thing, and I always got an A. I got an A in the fall, and \u2014\nand a B plus in the summer because we are \u2014 field and track, I didn't care for that too\nmuch.",
        "A: No. I wasn\u2019t in \u2014 I mean, I was lucky that I had a playmate, my brother Harry and I,\nwe had German friends in the neighborhood, a group, really sort of next door neighbors.\nBut after 1933 \u2014 well, \u201934, they started pulling back and also we did not want them to be\nembarrassed by associating with us because it \u2014 you know, some \u2014 a third party might \u2014\nmight say the \u2014 you know, there was one, his name was Willie Wrobleski(ph), I f\u2014 and\nthey were very poor working family. The father was unemployed during the depression, I\nMarch 16, 2001\nremember, but they were really decent people and we played with them. We had a shack\nin the back where they had like a little stable in the back where the boys\n[indecipherable] there were four of us that really sort of stuck together. But then my\nmother thought that maybe they would feel uncomfortable associating \u2014 having their kid\nassociate with us, so we eased back and \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, of course we were aware. We were aware of the sensitivities, you know, of\nother people, of \u2014 now, I must say that Celle was considered, not only by us who lived in\nCelle, but ba \u2014 of course we were aware of what happened in other communities where\nkids were beaten up on the way to school, and \u2014 and all that \u2014",
        "A: You heard, you know, you \u2014 you \u2014 y-you heard from other Jewish families o \u2014 in \u2014 in\nHessen, in he \u2014 yeah, where \u2014 where a lot of Jewish families lived in the country and\nwhere there was a lot of anti-Semitism, either for business reason or just to go and beat\nup a Jew. Were \u2014 the kids were intimidated on the way to school, they were called Jew \u2014\nJew bastard, Jude itsich(ph), you know \u2014",
        "A: Well, it probably \u2014 it means the same thing, we are going through that right now, here\nin our society with the bullying. It was bullying, okay? You pick on a Jew kid, and Jew\nMarch 16, 2001\nkids were \u2014 reputedly couldn\u2019t take care of themselves, they \u2014 you know\n[indecipherable] that \u2014 gang up on a Jew and beat him up. Why? Because just like in\nAmerica today, kids gang up on others, on weak, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 1t had nothing\nparticularly to do with who we were, but what we were.",
        "A: No, I never felt threatened. I remember I was still in elementary school, so I was\nprobably either eight or ni \u2014 must have been nine years old, my last year in elementary\nschool. So that would have made it 1933, and Hitler was already in power. It was after\nthe Macht Ubernahme, which you kn \u2014 power grab. Somebody from not my class but\nanother class, called me Jude itsich(ph), which was a Jew \u2014 Jew bastard, whatever,\nduring recess 1n the schoolyard. And we weren\u2019t allowed to fight in the schoolyard or in\nschool, that \u2014 it\u2019s not like \u2014 was not like America, it was like in Germany where we still\nhad corporal punishment. If children misbehaved they were caned in front of the entire\nclass. Pretty humiliating experience. So kids toed the line. But if you m \u2014 had a fight to\nfight, you fought it outside the school. So he want \u2014 he says, you want to fight, Pll \u2014 P\u2019ll \u2014-\nI said, Pll fight. ?\u201911 meet you in the park after school.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: You can call it altercation, I call it a challenge of a fight. So after school I went home,\nor w-went to my \u2014 our store, and in the park, which was the \u2014 you know, in the \u2014 1s the \u2014\nthe French park. This guy was waiting with \u2014 of course, the word had spread, he\u2019s going\nto fight with Roberg, the Jew, whatever they had spread. And everybody was around, I\ntook off my \u2014 my backpack, we had a Tornister it was called, a backpack. Took off my \u2014\nmy jacket and got into a fight. I\u2019d never fought in my life, but I knew what to do, I was\ninterested in Schmeling and Sharkey and Joe Louis, I think was around already. So I\nknew about fighting. And we started squaring off and he landed some punches and I\nlanded a lucky Sunday punch and bloodied his nose. So I was the first \u2014 first one to draw\nblood. Just then somebody hollered jute(ph), jute(ph), which does not mean Jew, but \u2014\nalthough it\u2019s close to it. A teacher approached too late, now we weren\u2019t allowed to fight\neven \u2014 even in the park. And he came right to it, he says, what is this fighting, why are\nyou fighting? I said, well he c \u2014 he called me juditsich(ph) and challenged me to a fight,\nI am fighting. So the teacher addressed the other boy and says, now that\u2019s not nice. You\nshouldn\u2019t say a thing like that. Now I want you to stop fighting and you both go home\nand that\u2019s the end of it. And that\u2019s how it was settled. So I came out the victor. The word\napparently spread and I never had any problems after that.\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: I was very close to my mother. My father was a rather \u2014 well, distant figure. He was\non the road all week. He was a quiet man, introspective. And so we \u2014 and nearsighted, so\nhe was limited in anything we did. Sunday \u2014 well, the routine, Sundays we would go for\nthe traditional Sunday afternoon Spaziergang in the woods, whatever. Sometimes we\nwould go on a boat ride on the river. But after 19 \u2014 let\u2019s say, well, after the Nuremberg\nlaws of 1935, which was the first really restrictive, official restrictive, then I think that\nstopped. We could have gone \u2014 I mean, we went walking, but we no longer would go,\nlet\u2019s say, using this excursion boat, which one of our neighbors \u2014 we lived right on the\nriver, a-and they were a family of fishermen who also owned a little excursion steamer\nmotorboat. So we no longer went. That was part of not raising any awareness and we\nreally \u2014 and apparently we did it successfully in our town, because there was no open\nanti-Semitism that I was aware of. Others in town complained about anti-Semitism, only\n\u2014 you know, somebody would say something, was either as a matter of competition or\nneighbors who didn\u2019t like the n\u2014 the Jews next to them for one reason or another. But\nthere really was very little and it \u2014 we used to almost brag about it, you know, to other\nJewish families, that we had no richiss(ph) \u2014 there was no anti-Semitism \u2014 open anti-\nSemitism in our town Nobody was ever beaten up, intimidated or you know, I mean \u2014\nand you could \u2014 anything could \u2014 could happen. Like a Hitler youth would see a Jewish\nMarch 16, 2001\nman coming down the street and bump into him, you know, why don\u2019t you watch where\nyou\u2019re going, or you know, walk in the gutter, or you know, make anti-Semitic remark\nand of course you couldn\u2019t do anything about it. But that never happened. It happened in\nother cities that we know. Whether it would, you know, intimidate or even challenge you\nor we didn\u2019t have any of that.",
        "A: Well, I was really aware of parties because in school some kids \u2014 this was \u2014 this goes\nback I would think to 1931 \u2014 \u201932. Kids I think everywhere, take sides. You have a\nfavorite \u2014 well, sports idol and you have a political party of your choice. So kids would\nask you, so what are you? And I wa \u2014 I would say, I\u2019m SPD \u2014 SPD riz \u2014 there was this\nSocial Democratic party. What are you? I\u2019m NSDRP, it\u2019s a Nazi party, meaning they\nwere what their parents were, right? I mean it \u2014 not hard to figure. The kids \u2014 children\ndon\u2019t have opinions, they have the opinions of their parents. So that was reflected. So I\nwent SPD and I remember we had a \u2014 what do we call it, Jahrmakt, a \u2014 a \u2014 a fair, a\ncountry fa-fi-fair, twice a year, in the spring and in the fall. And you go there and you \u2014\nyou know, and you \u2014 you had the stands and I bought a \u2014 as a matter of identification, the\nsymbol of s \u2014 the SPD was three arrows. So I bought \u2014 I spent five cents and bought a pin\nso that I could have an identity. And I came home with that, and my mother says, what do\nyou have? I said, aren\u2019t we SPD? And my mother said yes, but I think it\u2019s better if you\nMarch 16, 2001\ndon\u2019t wear that, because you can be something and you don\u2019t have to advertise it,\nbecause if somebody who sees and doesn\u2019t like it, you may get into an argument or a\nfight and you know the Nazis of course \u2014 well, the Nazi kids, they would stick together\nand the SPD kids would stick together. So these were little clubs. So I was aware of\npolitical things. I remember well in the \u2014 in the paper that there were street fights in\nHamburg which was, of course, Hamburg was largely red, predominantly communist,\nbecause was a harbor city and of course everybody read about you know, the \u2014 what\nhappened \u2014 what went on in Munich and in Berlin where the Nazis would ride around in\ntrucks, have a demonstration and the communists would come and break it up and vice-a-\nversa. And they would let \u2014 and the SA, these storm \u2014 the SR then was the predominant\npower, the brown shirts and brown pants. The SS was not yet very predominant then. So\nSR would go around and these were bruisers. They were people who liked to fight. They\nwere, you know, bouncers, they were bru \u2014 they would go out \u2014 they joined the party so\nthey could get into a good fight just like people here go out on Saturday night, hey, let\u2019s\ngo to a bar where we can have some action. Same mentality. So I was aware of that as a\nchild, but there was a \u2014 you know, of course, a sobering effect from the home to say don\u2019t\nget involved and we have to, as Jews, be \u2014 lay low and you know, don\u2019t make waves.",
        "A: Oh, before \u2014 before 1933 already. I mean, I was seven, eight years old, I knew Hitler\nwas in the limelight and I remember very distinctly the \u2014 about the putsch, the\nMarch 16, 2001\nReichstagsbrand, the torching of the Reichstag right after he was elected and acor \u2014 of \u2014\nof course the power grab on January 30\", 1933, everybody was aware of that.",
        "A: No, no he wasn\u2019t. He was far away, he was in Berlin, that was \u2014 what I do remember\nis \u2014 I mean, parents were careful \u2014 not my parents, I think most parents at the time, not to\ndiscuss anything upsetting in front of the children. So there were no political discussions,\nbut we knew that in the Jewish \u2014 within the Jewish community \u2014 I mean, we had friends,\nJewish friends and the families would get together, usually on Saturday night. There were\n\u2014 well, about four or five or six families that sort of were the nucleus and there were card\ngames, Skat and you need four players. So there were four families that got together and\nit alternated at somebody\u2019s house, and that was the highlight of the social life was the\ncard games and the women would sit and talk and the mother would entertain, I mean,\nwith food and coffee and cake and all that and the men played cards and smoked cigars\nand \u2014",
        "A: Yes, they did, but we children, we were allowed to say hello and you know, then off to\nbed, and that\u2019s the way it was, you know.

Well, if you saw a Nazi in the\nboots, you knew that he was a Nazi, and he was strutting it, but I was never, never afraid\nof them, because then we didn\u2019t have any reason to be afraid. I do, of course, remember\ndistinctly April 1*, 1933 was the day of \u2014 oh, what was it? What do we \u2014 what do you \u2014\nwhat do we call that? A boycott.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Was a boycott and we had a store, storefront and there were two SA Stormtroopers to\nthe left and right of the entrance, standing, you know, like this, la \u2014 not at attention, but at\n\u2014 Wi-wi \u2014 we\u2019d Say in our army, at parade rest, okay? And if somebody would wa \u2014 even\nif they wo \u2014 just walked by, kauft nicht bei Juden. Don\u2019t buy from the Jews. And I\nthink they had also, with white paint drawn a swastika on our \u2014 on our store windows. I\ncame from \u2014 I went to school as every other day, and I came home at one o\u2019clock, I mean\nwas \u2014 school was only til one o\u2019clock, from eight in the morning til one, and I was then in\nthird grade. I came to the store, cause that\u2019s where my mother was, we already \u2014 we no\nlonger had a maid. Before that we had, you know, when we were smaller we \u2014 we had a\nMarch 16, 2001\nmaid and the maid was al \u2014 I think already gone by then. And I walked in \u2014 of course\nthey looked at me and they knew where I belonged. And then a woman came in to buy \u2014\nwell, a woman came in, a customer, but a woman that we hadn\u2019t seen before. And in a\ntown of 30,000, your customers were repeat customers, people who came in to buy from\nus. And she said, this 1s terrible, what is going on. I really don\u2019t want to buy anything, but\nI just had to come in \u2014 into your store, she told my mother, to \u2014 you know, because I \u2014\nthis is \u2014 this 1s a terrible thing what they are doing. Was a demonstration of \u2014 you know,\nof solidarity. And she didn\u2019t buy anything, which was all right. And she stayed in the\nstore a few minutes and then she went out again. So there were people like that. There\nwas no business that day, but we kept the store open, of course, and after that. But 1t was\na struggle, you know, the business was getting less and less.",
        "A: Well, I \u2014 no, I b \u2014 I knew they were there, they were \u2014 they happened to \u2014 there were\nthree Jewish stores on that street, a shoe store sort of diagonally across the street and\nanother one, a soft goods store as \u2014 as we had up on the corner. And they were \u2014 they\nwere standing there, I knew all the Jewish stores, there were six \u2014 seven Jewish\nbusinesses in town, and they were standing in front \u2014 1-in front of all of them and it didn\u2019t\nMarch 16, 2001\n\u2014I had no \u2014I wasn\u2019t frightened, I wasn\u2019t \u2014 they were there and I made no more of it, I\nknew why they were there. Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah.",
        "A: The book burnings were later. That was, I would think about 1936 or thereabouts.",
        "A: There were some earlier? Not in our town, no.",
        "A: No, there were no demonstrations of that kind or \u2014 as I say, it was pretty low level of\nopen anti-Semitism.",
        "A: There were only about \u2014 well, there were four Jewish families who had children our\nage. But the me \u2014 s \u2014 there was really only one family, the one down the block, the Wolf\nfamily, with whom we were friendly, our parents played cards together, and they had\nthree children. The boy was a year younger than I, the girl was a year younger than\nHarry and a third, she was two years younger than I, so they were all about our age, and\nMarch 16, 2001\nthey were sort of our only playmates after \u201933 or \u201934. There was another family,\nShule(ph) who had a boy and a girl, but we didn\u2019t socialize with them. Well, again, it\nwas part of the \u2014 well, Jewish \u2014 German Jewish society. The man had a \u2014 he was a rag\ndealer. Well, he \u2014 he had the local recycling center. He dealt in \u2014 what do we call that?\nYou got five minutes. Used, you know, iron, metals and rags and all that and I\u2019m sure \u2014\nI\u2019m \u2014 he made a living, but 1t wasn\u2019t on the same level as our \u2014 you know, our parents,\nwho were tradesmen and had a \u2014 you know, business owned \u2014 store owners. So there was\na social level that you didn\u2019t really \u2014 they were decent people and we respect them and\nwe were in, of course, 1n Hebrew school together. We had Hebrew school, and III tell\nyou about that. It was part of our social structure. But the \u2014 the s-social intercourse, you\nknow, I mean we \u2014 we never played with those kids. They also lived further away and we\njust \u2014 we just didn\u2019t, because our parents didn\u2019t get together. But you saw each other\nduring the high holidays in shul and of course we saw the kids during Hebrew school.",
        "A: Well, th \u2014 our teacher, Hal Lotheim was his name, I-o-t-h-e-i-m. He was a retired\nschoolteacher, on had \u2014 so he had a pension. And I don\u2019t know what the congregation\npaid him for being the cantor and \u2014 but he had free room and board in the apartment in \u2014\nabove a \u2014 in \u2014 at the synagogue. And the building, the congregation\u2019s building were two\nhouses adjoining and the main building was the entrance to the synagogue and right\nadjacent to that in the f \u2014 facing the street was the ca \u2014 the one room classroom, and there\nMarch 16, 2001\nwas a little storage room behind that. And we went to Hebrew school Sunday mornings\nand Wednesday afternoon. Why Wednesday afternoon? Wednesday was Hitler youth\nday. All German children who belonged to the Hitler youth, and there was, of course, a\nlot of pressure that everybody should join and almost had to join, whether they liked it or\nnot, you had to belong. And if you didn\u2019t, the parents were pressurized because Hitler\nwanted the youth. He didn\u2019t much care about the parents, but there was a lot of pressure,\nand I know because there were many \u2014 were people who really were not Nazis and\ndisagreed with the whole thing, and pressure was put on them for the boys to join the\nHitler youth, or the Jungvolk, which is the children from six to 10. You had to be 10 to\ngo into the Hitler youth, the hiyot(ph) HJ, Hitler youth. Bel \u2014 below that, you were the\nJungvolk, that is the young \u2014 the young people. They \u2014 and they then had meeting \u2014 no,\nI\u2019m sorry, I guess you had to be 14 for the Hitler youth and up to 14 was the Jungvolk.\nSo all my classmates, or most of my classmates then would go on Wednesday afternoon,\nthey had to put on their you \u2014 Hitler uniform. When you attended, you had to appear in\nuniform. And of course, we didn\u2019t have a uniform. I would have liked to have a uniform.\nThat was because we played war games. You played \u2014 well, we played cops and robbers,\nor you played cowboy and Indians, or you \u2014 you know? Or you played soldiers, you\nknow. The bad guys were the French and the good guys were the German soldiers. So\nthese were the war games you played. I guess all little boys do that. And so \u2014 well, but I\nhad no regrets that I didn\u2019t have a uniform per se. As a matter of fact, the corduroy short\nMarch 16, 2001\npants and the belt with a belt buckle and all that, which some boys would wear even\nwhen \u2014 you know, their uniform pants, even when they weren\u2019t in uniform, with the shirt\nand all that. We made su \u2014 my mother made sure that we never wore anything that would\nimply that we wanted to, or that we belonged and you know \u2014 of course, somebody\nwould say hey, what are you doing with those pants, you know. You are not entitled to\nwear these pants. But well, today I guess it\u2019s Nike\u2019s. Nothing has changed.",
        "A: Yes, I had a Bar Mitzvah, my brother had a Bar Mitzvah and you prepared for oh, a\nyear, year and a half, whatever and Hal Lotheim taught us and w-well, it became my\nbam \u2014 ma-ma \u2014 my brother\u2019s Bar Mitzvah in 1935.",
        "A: No, what should be the problem? I mean, we had the service, we had some relatives\ncome from out of town and we got a minyan together and everybody was very happy that\nthere was another minyan man now. So Bar Mitzvahs were looked forward to in the\ncommunity as a \u2014 it was \u2014 my Bar Mitzvah was May \u2014 on May 1\u201c, 1937. And our \u2014 we\nhad a nice dinner at home after that, and I said the table prayer, you know, tish\nkabaid(ph) afterwards and made Kiddush, and of course, in \u2014 1n synagogue, I \u2014 I read the\nTorah and you know, it was very traditional.",
        "A: Yes, I mean I \u2014 well, proud.\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, we weren\u2019t proud to be Jews. We were \u2014 we were content to be Jews. I think we\nwere \u2014 proud, I think is the wrong thing. We \u2014 I think \u2014 no, you\u2019re born into being a Jew,\nyou have no choice, but we didn\u2019t repudiate it as some did. I mean, obviously, you know,\npeople who didn\u2019t want to be identified as Jews, or who converted to Christianity\nobviously \u2014 and you could do that. There was one family, a woman with two daughters, I\ndon\u2019t know where the husband was, whether he died or whatever, and she thought it\nwould be easier for her and her daughters and they converted. They converted to\nChristianity. Turned out of course that subsequently didn\u2019t do them any good anyway,\nright? But that was not unusual, I mean that \u2014 this was part of the assimilation mentality\nand attempt to become equal. I mean, look \u2014 1-1-1f \u2014 if you look \u2014 you know, in history,\nyou know, there \u2014 there were many people who converted and still remained Jews \u2014 you\nknow, I mean, in the eyes of the world.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nMarch 16, 2001\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Yes. \u2019m a history buff and I \u2014 since I grew up in Celle with history, which wa \u2014 it\u2019s\nreally also the cradle of the present British monarchy, so the \u2014 the house of Hanover\noriginated in Celle. And at an early a \u2014 in school from, I guess about six or seven years,\nwe learned about the history of Celle and then the district and then the province and so I\n\u2014 I\u2019ve been interested. I grew up with history and been interested in history, and of course\nI was aware of the annexation of Austria, the so-called being invited in, and Hitler\u2019s\ntriumphant march and that v \u2014 you know, Vienna. Of course, Hitler coming from\nAustria and many Germans didn\u2019t accept him because he was not a German, he was an\nAustrian. He tried very hard to be German, but we Germans knew that he wasn\u2019t German.",
        "A: No, wasn\u2019t frightening, it was a \u2014 you know, w-we \u2014 we saw it in the newsreels, there\nwas no other exposure \u2014 in the newsreels and we knew it was propaganda and it was \u2014 as\na matter of fact, well, din \u2014 one was \u2014 Hitler was everywhere. Of course it was \u2014 there\nwas \u2014 by then, every classroom had a picture of Hitler hanging in the front, that was\nordained. There wa \u2014 yeah, there was th-th-the \u2014 that came from \u2014 from the top. So there\nMarch 16, 2001\nwas a \u2014 there was a systematic indoctrination of the fuehrer being \u2014 he wasn\u2019t referred to\nas Hitler any more, he was der fuehrer, and he \u2014",
        "A: No, not only I didn\u2019t have to, I wasn\u2019t allowed to. Jews were not allowed to give the\nNazi salute. They were \u2014 as a matter of fact, if there was a \u2014 an assembly in the \u2014 in the\nschoolyard, for instance, then everybody, you know, had to sieg heil, Jews were not\nallowed to. That was a \u2014 they \u2014 it was a privilege to give the \u2014 the \u2014 so Jews were not\npermitted to, that would have been sacrilegious. That\u2019s how they made the \u2014 the \u2014 you\nknow, Hitler salute. Nor did I want to. So when the national anthem was sung, I had to\nattend. I stood there, I didn\u2019t sing the Horst-Wessel-Lied, you know. And the only thing\nthat I remember is if they would sing, there were \u2014 there were certain \u2014 there were certain\nsongs that, you know boys \u2014 and that was a form of intimidation, of course. Like, guys\nwould \u2014 would pass by on their bicycle and they\u2019d see a Jew and they\u2019d sing a song,\nWenn das Judenblut vom Messer spritzt. When the Jews blood will \u2014 will squirt from\nthe knife, okay, that was \u2014 etcetera. They would, you know, intimid \u2014 form of\nintimidation, of teasing, of intimidating, okay? But there was never any \u2014 any physical\nintimidation, okay, but [indecipherable]. Young people, primarily boys, they feel their\noats and they are together, that\u2019s what they do, right? They let it out in one form another.\nAnd there was \u2014 there were the Jews, the minority that you could let it out on if you\nMarch 16, 2001\nwanted to without, you know, without any reprimand. Au contraire, it was a mitzvah for\nthem, you know?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, but if \u2014 if something hap \u2014 if something happened that shouldn\u2019t\nhappen, I wou \u2014 I would tell my mother, yes. Oh, of course, and she was good counselor\nand had a good head, and you know \u2014",
        "A: Well, usually to keep cool, but I really can\u2019t think of any \u2014 any incident other than the\nfight that I had, to you know \u2014 there was \u2014 we didn\u2019t give our parents any reason. We\nwere \u2014 we were cautious, we were careful, we didn\u2019t make waves, we were, by and well\n\u2014 you know, well liked, well respected in the neighborhood, where are \u2014 all our neighbors\nwere decent. Those that were \u2014 that we knew were Nazis, we \u2014 we didn\u2019t tangle. W-We \u2014\nwe went out of their way, you know, we didn't \u2014 you didn\u2019t make eye contact with them,\nyou didn't give them any reason to \u2014 you know, we didn\u2019t give them the opportunity to be\nnasty to us. You went out of their way.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yeah, I didn't like it. I mean th \u2014 I \u2014 well, I was more w \u2014 of course you grow up with\nit and you see it and the swastikas everywhere, it was just another \u2014 it sort of made your\nMarch 16, 2001\nheart go a little faster, but you got used to it. When I later had to return to Germany from\nHolland \u2014 you know, I went to Holland after, and then I came back, that really hit me\nlike a sledgehammer, that I was back under the heel of the Nazi regime.",
        "A: Yes. My brother left school, he was 14 in 1936 and my mother\u2019s brother lived in\nHolland, he had become a Dutch citizen. He left Germany right after World War I, he\nwas in procurement in \u2014 in grains. And as you know, ger \u2014 Holland was neutral during\nWorld War I, and he had built up some very good relations with Dutch grain suppliers for\nthe army. He was in Berlin, in procurement. And he had learned the grain trade, grain\nbusiness, as a young man. And as soon as the war was over, he left Germany, he went to\nHolland, never ret \u2014 well, he returned to visit his mother, etcetera, but he established his\nbusiness and residence in Holland, became a Dutch citizen and he ended up saving the\nfamily. In 1936 he took my brother to Holland. My uncle was not married, bachelor, but\nhe was also the \u2014 well, he \u2014 there were five sisters and one brother, so he was the\nmatriarch \u2014 patriarch. Sorry, patriarch. My grandmother, his mother, died in 1931, and\nthat was the last time he was in Germany. Yeah, but [indecipherable] of course he\nwould come before that, come and visit, but he didn\u2019t think well of Germany, but he also\nwas interesting. The things that we told him later about what \u2014 what was going on in\nGermany, you know, the Hitler \u2014 the me \u2014 the mentality of what was going on, what\nMarch 16, 2001\nHitler did with the Jews. He was assimilated, I mean, he did not we \u2014 observe the high\nholidays, but he was not a practicing Jew, per se. He thought that we were really\noveremphasizing, that we were panicky, just like the rest of the world did not really\nbelieve that this was happening, and they \u2014 me -- said me \u2014 ma, he says, Jiidische\ngroil(ph) propaganda, if you understand that. That\u2019s Jewish prop \u2014 you know, he \u2014 he\ndidn\u2019t think that this was happening, that people panicked or saw things too Jewish. And\nunfortunately he found out after the invasion of Holland that it was real.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t hard, it was a fact of life. Harry left. I mean, he went, you know, to go to\nschool in Holland and learn \u2014 when we \u2014 he went to a trade school, learned a trade. Now\nat this time, 1936, to go back to what you asked about Zionism, we did have classes twice\na week on Wednesdays. I sort of got away from that, but the Hitler youth \u2014 on\nWednesday afternoon we had Hebrew school, and in 1933, lot \u2014 Lotheim and \u2014 sorry,\nLotheim and \u2014 Mr. and Mrs. Lotheim went to Palestine and came back as ardent\nZionists. They were impressed with what was being done there and from there on he\nreally said, well we have to \u2014 we have to support Palestine, Zionism is our solution. And\nwe listened. Of course, we all subscribed to a Jewish paper out of Berlin called\n\u2018\u201cJiidische Rundschau,\u201d which is Jewish \u2014 well, was a Jewish weekly. And they had a\nchildren\u2019s section and it was Zionist oriented and told the Jewish community that they\nhad to A, support Palestine and B, prepare for leaving Germany, that it was prudent to\nMarch 16, 2001\nlearn to \u2014 a trade \u2014 for young people to learn a trade for HaSharat(ph) rather than what\nwas the trend before, an academic life. Jews in Germany, by and large wanted to get\naway being shopkeepers and the trend was to go into academic life, doctors, lawyers,\nwhatever. And that\u2019s \u2014 we were the first ones to go to a school of higher education in my\nfamily. My br \u2014 both my brother and I went to the \u2014 you know, gymnasium. And of\ncourse that was interrupted by Hitler, so Harry went to Holland to learn a trade and we\nhad no plans of where to go or what to do. My father was very reluctant to \u2014 he was 50,\nborn in 1884, so he was hesitant to go to a country. Knew some English, learned French\nin school, but that was it. Where do you go, what do you do? He wasn\u2019t too successful in\nGermany, how successful would he be in a foreign country? And so that was \u2014 you\nasked me did I find it hard to say goodbye? Well, I was on my own now, my playmate\nwas gone, you know, my confidant. Harry and I were very close as, you know, boys. But\nI adjusted to that and I knew it was a necessity and I lived with it, I accepted it.",
        "A: Well, let me \u2014 let precede that. In the summer of \u201938, I was 14. I went to visit my aunt\nin Byetahl(ph), my mother\u2019s home village, as I did every summer for the big vacation,\nfour weeks vacation.",
        "A: My aunt\u2019s name was Babette(ph). And Aunt Babette was single. She was \u2014 well,\nphysically handicapped. She had an ac \u2014 bad accident as a child and had \u2014 one leg was\nMarch 16, 2001\nshorter than the other, so she wasn't married, she stayed home with her mother. When\nGrandma died in 1931, she of course continued to live in the f \u2014 family house that had\nbeen there since 1830. And this was my last \u2014 well, visit with her. During that time, in\nAugust, of course, you know that every year the Nazis in August had the\nNuremberger(ph) Parteitag, the party convention. And usually out of that came new\nlaws, new dogmas, new tightening. And again that was very significant, that things were\ntightening up and in August, mel \u2014 we had already closed our store in 1937. It n-no\nlonger paid. We moved \u2014 it so happened that our landlord, the owner of our house, it was\na three family house, we lived on the \u2014 they lived on the ground floor, the first floor was\na retired lawyer, he was a person that was working at the \u2014 the law \u2014 the supreme \u2014 there\nwere three Supreme Courts in Germany, one of them was in Celle. And he was \u2014 he had\nworked for the Supreme Court as a judge, but he was forced to resign in 1933, and Pll\ngive you that story separately. They lived on the second floor and we lived on the third\nfloor. The Zusskinds(ph) had given up their store about in 1928 or thereabouts and\nmoved some of the inventory into one of their rooms made a \u2014 yeah, and they permitted\nus to do the same. So, whatever inventory we had left, my father thought we could sell.\nWe moved into what was the living room and that became the office and the business and\nsome of his customers that were loyal to him and hi \u2014 prices were right, so rather than\nselling the inventory at, you know, 10 cents on the dollar as we had to do with the rest of\nit, we maintained that. So we no longer had a store since 1937. And in August 738, my\nMarch 16, 2001\nmother, when things were tightening up further, decided to take a trip to Hamburg and\nget three waiting numbers from the American consulate, because as you know there was\na waiting list and the list was about two years waiting. She said let \u2014 le \u2014 I \u2014 I want to get\nthe quota numbers in case we need them. And she also picked up three more for one of\nthe families that we were closest with, the Solomon \u2014 the young Solomons. There was an\nold family, the parents and the son; this was the son and his wife. And we \u2014 well, then\ncame November, of course, and we were all aware of the incident in Paris. What was his\nname?",
        "A: Grynszpan. Hersh \u2014 Herschel \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Herschel Grynszpan. It so happens that Herschel Grynszpan was from\nHannover, and I can tell you a story about that too, if you want to make a note, let me\nput that down. So we knew \u2014 and when he shot them, we knew there was going to be\ntrouble. And of course, the ninth of November was always a v \u2014 a day observed in\nGermany because it was when, in 1923, the first putsch and the whatever, so this was\nalways a solemn, commemorative day of the Nazi party, and that coincided. And so we\nwere keenly aware of what was happening, but of course, we didn't know what. Now, on\n\u2014 the ninth of November came and of course everybody kept a low profile, we didn't go\nout, whatever. Seven o\u2019clock in the morning our doorbell rang. We were upstairs, the\nMarch 16, 2001\nfront door was locked and so we looked out the window, who is it? Somebody from the\nWolf family who had the store down the street from where our store was. We lived not\nnear the store, we lived somewhere else. And, how are you? We are all right, why do you\nask? Don\u2019t you know? Nothing happened here? No, what happened? So they came up\nand told us that they still had their store and they lived above the store in the \u2014 1n the\nhouse, that the store was smashed, the store across the street, the shoe store, was sm \u2014 and\nthey also lived there. We were the only ones who had a separate \u2014 you know, residence\nbecause we rented the house and we rented the store. And they owned the buildings so\nlived above them. That \u2014 th \u2014 you know, they had totally smashed the store, that the\ngoods were lying all over the street. They went up into the attic and opened the \u2014 there\nwas a door because the attics were used also in the olden days \u2014 these were half timbered\nhouses from the 17\" century \u2014 to bring merchandise. So they opened the attic door and\nsaid, if they \u2014 if they come up here to get us, we\u2019ll jump. Well, they didn\u2019t find them in\nthe attic, they were just out to destroy the store. And so we knew what was going on in\ntown. And my father was home, and I was home and my mother. So what to do? So\nMother said \u2014 my mother was really running the family, my father was a very passive \u2014\nand at that point, you know, subdued individual. And \u2014",
        "A: Ah, the [indecipherable]\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: Yes, conditions. Business was bad. You \u2014 I mean, you felt very inadequate. And \u2014 and\nreally, you know, was a matter of we didn\u2019t want to emigrate, what am I gonna do? I\ncan\u2019t see, you know, I can\u2019t hear, at least I have \u2014 I know my clientele, I have my\nfollowing. But we really didn\u2019t know what was gonna \u2014 you know, the \u2014 the Jewish\ncommunity said, this can\u2019t last, it has to get better, it can\u2019t get worse. What else can they\ndo\u2019? But they \u2014 you know, it progressed.",
        "A: Not yet. That came la \u2014 that came \u2014 yeah, I think that was in 1938 as a matter of fact,\nwhen the \u2014 yes, I think that was \u2014 that came out of the Nuremberger(ph) laws of 1938. I\nthink there was one of the keys where my mother said, oh, it\u2019s another notch, you know,\nof tightening \u2014 tightening up and of intimidation. Yes, we did \u2014 she became Sarah and\nwe all became Kurt Walter Israel \u2014 I became isra \u2014 Kurt Walter Israel, my father\nVictor Israel, yes.",
        "A: Well, it was another significant thing because it was significant for us because Roberg\nwas not considered a Jewish name. It was never Rosenberg or anything like that. So\nRoberg was a German name. So it \u2014 yes, signified that we were Jews, even, you know,\nwherever you went. So Mother went to Hamburg and got waiting numbers. So now it is\nnov \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s November and she s \u2014 you know, we decided \u2014\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: This is the morning, yes.",
        "A: And we just \u2014 we decide eight o\u2019clock. Now, I lived across \u2014 across from our school.\nOur garden backyard and the schoolyard were back to back. There was a little creek\nabout two yards across or less, in between. And \u2014 but my mother could look into my\nclassroom. It was maybe a hundred yards, or 120 yards across. And when we recited class\n\u2014 in class, you know, vocabulary or whatever with the windows open, she could hear us\nrecite. Okay, what\u2019s that [indecipherable]. So she said, I think you should \u2014 better go to\nschool. Go like any other day. If there is a problem, we had a whistle, with which we\nwere also summoned home if we were out in the street, Pll blow the whistle three times.\nSo I went to sc \u2014 class, and I must say my teacher, my homeroom teacher, Studienrat\nKlem(ph) was a fabulous guy who really supported me all the way. He was not a Nazi, I\nmean he was anything but. I must say the entire schoolyo \u2014 teachers\u2019 body, with one or\ntwo exceptions, were fabulous to me and very supportive. So he came into class and of\ncourse in those days, you know, ba \u2014 when the teacher came into class everybody had to\nstand up and heil Hitler, you know, they were \u2014 and he \u2014 he would just go, sit down. He\nhad to raise his hand, but it was like sit down, you know. He would never say heil Hitler,\ni-1t was \u2014 so he saw me and he called me \u2014 and of course when I came into class, my\nclassmates already looked at me like, what do you \u2014 what are you doing here? And I\nknew what had gone on at least, yeah, from the Wolfs. And of course there were students\nMarch 16, 2001\nwho came by train. They weren\u2019t local, they \u2014 they came from surrounding villages and\nwalking through town from the railroad station, they saw that the five remaining Jewish\nstores were smashed, and the word goes like wildfire. So everybody in class knew and\nthey looked at me, but nobody said anything. And he \u2014 the \u2014 Klem(ph) called me up and\nsaid, do you know what is going on in town? I said yes, I heard. He says, do you want to\nstay in school? I said yes, I\u2019d like to stay in school, school like any other day. He says\nokay, any time you want to go home, you can go. So I went, and the intermission was at\n10 o\u2019clock and I looked over to our house and everything was quiet. I could see our\nkitchen and bedroom windows from the schoolyard. And I went back into class and then\nat about a quarter to 11 or so, I heard my mother blow the whistle. So I asked Studienrat\nKlem(ph), I \u2014 may I go home? Yes, of course. And yeah, I did this very unobtrusive, I\nleft my books there. I just went out of the classroom like I went to the toilet, but I didn\u2019t\ncome back. I didn\u2019t want to make waves, you know, picking up my books and \u2014 and\ngoing out. I left my books and I just \u2014 like I went to the bathroom, but I went home.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: She certainly did. So I\u2014 I went home and my mother told me that the Gestapo was\nthere \u2014 well, yeah, every town had a \u2014 th-the police, the city police, they was \u2014 they also\nMarch 16, 2001\nhad a couple of Gestapo agents who were whatever, that they \u2014 that part of the police\nwere there and took my father into protective custody, that was the term, schutzhaft,\nprotective custody. And they were at the police station and \u2014 and they asked her, don\u2019t\nyou have a son? And my mother says, my son is in school, where he should be. Oh.\nOkay. That was that. They didn\u2019t ask any further. And of course there were no phones,\nnobody \u2014 we di \u2014 yes, we did have a telephone, but we didn\u2019t dare use the phone because\nwe knew it was listened to or whatever. So one of our \u2014 the girl \u2014 the family under us,\nRusterveld, where the f \u2014 man was, you know, forced into retirement, he had a daughter,\nshe was a couple of years older than I, Alsa(ph) and she ran errands for us. And they\nwere violently anti-Nazi. She said, I don\u2019t want you to go out, I\u2019Il do some shopping for\nyou and you\u2019re not gonna stay in your apartment, you come and stay with us. And we\ndid. And then the word, you know, from other Jewish family, we \u2014 we \u2014 my \u2014 I think we\nfound out from the \u2014 through the grapevine that the men were leaving the police station\nand that they were being sent to Hamburg. And then the word came down that from\nHamburg they were sent to Berlin. And fr \u2014 in ber \u2014 from Berlin to concentration camp\nOranienburg, which was near Berlin. So we already were breathing a sigh of relief be \u2014\nthat they didn\u2019t go to Dachau. Dachau, near Munich had the worst reputation, that\nDachau was \u2014 was torture. The others were really just sort of like considered better grade\ndetention facilities, whatever, as far as we knew.\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: Well you \u2014 you heard that people were put into concentration camps and \u2014 katset(ph),\nas it was referred to, for any infraction. Jews, I mean who \u2014 Jews who had sex with \u2014\nwith Gentile \u2014 with the Christian women, off into the concentration camp. For whatever \u2014\nwhatever reason, if you broke any of the laws, and that was the Nuremberger(ph) laws,\nwhere th-there was no, you know, wha-whatever. Cohabitation or \u2014 and we knew they\nwere concentration camps, everybody knew. Everybody knew they were concentration\ncamps, and what went on in them, and men \u2014 occasionally you heard of people \u2014 well,\nthat\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: Well, when \u2014 we felt helpless, frustrated. We thought that\u2019s the end, you know, we \u2014\nwe didn\u2019t know. They said it\u2019s \u2014 well, only protective custody, but then they went to \u2014 we\ndidn\u2019t know. You really \u2014 and you don\u2019t \u2014 you don\u2019t think, you don\u2019t anticipate, you\ndon\u2019t know. You really don\u2019t know. I mean, you heard of people who came back, who\nwere released from concentration camps and you also heard from people where the\nfamilies had been notified they had a heart attack and was called \u2014 yeah, in German, heart\nattack is called herz schlag. And the \u2014 that \u2014 that used to \u2014 used to be called a schlag\naufs herz, which you know, play on words. I-Instead of a herz schlag you had a \u2014 okay.\nSo \u2014\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t there.",
        "A: When I \u2014 well, I was shocked. I mean, I was, you know, I was \u2014 yes, I mean it was\ncomplete upheaval of you know, you felt absolutely helpless. I guess \u2014 you know, you \u2014\nyou feel like no \u2014 I tell you, the only \u2014 the only thing I can compare it with 1s, have you\never been in a \u2014 either a hurricane or an earthquake, where you feel absolutely helpless?\nOkay, you \u2014 there\u2019s nothing you can do to try and save yourself or whatever. It\u2019s that\nkind of a feeling, that it\u2019s beyond your control. But we also \u2014 I mean, my mother was a\nvery rational individual and I think she kept her cool, and you know, maybe also for my\nconsideration she didn\u2019t go to pieces and she \u2014 well, she didn't \u2014 wouldn\u2019t serve any\npurpose, she wasn\u2019t that kind of an individual. Some people function best under pressure,\nas I do and which is a blessing. You know, other people react negatively. Well, we didn't.\nAnd well then, of course, what \u2014 can you do anything? We couldn\u2019t do anything other\nthan setting things in motion to get me out of the country. The only solution, of course,\nwas Holland. And no telephone calls, you would write. Everything was by mail, you\nknow. So my uncle agreed to take me in and started things rolling. Of course it wasn\u2019t\nthat easy in Holland either. Holland didn\u2019t want any Jews. Even Holland didn\u2019t \u2014 only if\n\u2014 you know, mm \u2014 so it took six weeks until I could get out from my \u2014\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: [indecipherable] No, I didn\u2019t, no. The - November 10\" was my last day in school.\nAfter that there was no \u2014 no more school for me or anybody else. I mean, it was a miracle\nthat I went to a non-Jewish school. See, the law by then had already changed, that\nwherever there were Jewish schools, that the Jews were no longer allowed to go to\nChristian schools, but there was nothing in Celle and I was the only Jew. Now the Wolf\nchildren, Herbert was already \u2014 he was goi \u2014 he was, I think in Hamburg or somewhere,\nthey had put him into a Jewish school in Hamburg. So their children were already out of\ntheir local schools. I was really the only Jew in the German school system there.",
        "A: No, my father \u2014 my father \u2014 this is, I think, significant. On December 17\", my father\ncame back. We didn't know, we had no word that I know of, until he walked in. I don\u2019t\nknow, I don\u2019t remember whether he phoned or whatever. I doubt it. We weren\u2019t a\ntelephone oriented and we couldn\u2019t trust the telephone. My father was released on\nDecember 16\" from Oranienburg together with Hans Solomon, who was this \u2014 the\nyounger man, the family that we were friendly with. Of course, all the German \u2014 th-the\nJews from Celle were sent to the same camp, Oranienburg. And I think Lotheim had\nalready been released a week earlier, but I couldn\u2019t be sure, because he was \u2014 he was in\nhis 70\u2019s. Hans and my father came out, as I say, on the 16\". They were just discharged\nand Hans was a \u2014 in his early 30\u2019s then, he was very inventive, he\u2019s a sharp guy. And my\nfather, you know, was nearly blind, so they took the old \u2014 the hat that \u2014 that they were\nMarch 16, 2001\ngetting in \u2014 giving \u2014 all their clothes had been disinfected and just rolled in a ball, they\nwere crumpled and smelled from this disinfectant, I can smell it today. And they \u2014 he\nwent to the railroad station and took his hat and went begging, you know, with a blind\nman, you know, here\u2019s a blind man, please give the blind \u2014 and they got enough money\ntogether from Germans to go from Oranienburg to Berlin, and Hans\u2019s sister-in-law\nlived in Berlin. They went to the sister-in-law, her husband had of course also been taken\nbut she was at home, and he bought enough money for the railroad fair for the two of\nthem to come back to Celle. And then they walked in and I remember my father coming\nin, his \u2014 well, he didn\u2019t have much hair, but the head was completely shaved and this\nhorrible smell of the disinfectant. And his body smelled from \u2014 you know, the only food\nthat they got was \u2014 apparently the Germans took whale blubber and cooked that into a\nstew and that\u2019s what they got to eat, that and some potatoes. And most people couldn\u2019t\neat it. Hans ate it, and whoever didn\u2019t want to, couldn\u2019t stomach this stuff. It smelled fa \u2014\nand my father e-exuded this smell of whale blubber oil type. I mean, incred \u2014 I \u2014I\u2014I can\nsmell it just thinking about it. And Hans was the only guy in the whole Oranienburg\ncamp who gained weight, because he ate everybody el \u2014 what everybody else could \u2014 he\nwas that kind of a guy. And then my father sat down and he cried. I had never seen my\nfather cry, and he related the tortures that they had gone through. They had to stand at\nattention, now this was December, to stand at attention for six hours and if somebody\ndropped they weren\u2019t allowed to help them. And just, you know, the bunks, that was\nMarch 16, 2001\nwhere they slept over there, wer \u2014 where they \u2014 and how they were well, humiliated and\nsomebody broke an infraction, everybody \u2014 everybody out to witness how they were put\naufbuch(ph) that was \u2014 it was a\u2014 a wooden whatever, gadget, where they were strung\nup, I guess, spread eagle and whipped 25 lashes in front of everybody. Or 50, whatever \u2014\nwhatever the leader of \u2014 you know, and people were dropping and collapsing and\nwatching that. And I guess luckily my father couldn\u2019t see too much. He wa \u2014 he \u2014 they\nhad taken his glasses away from him, he was like a blind man. He didn\u2019t see it, but he\nheard it, of course. And he would \u2014 he would tal \u2014 and he never talked about anything,\nbut he was talking about it, and who could listen to that? And he\u2019d break down and cry.\nAnd I left then, a week later, on the twe \u2014 December 24\", I left for Holland. Now here\u2019s\nagain a little well, incidence of the spirit that we had. When you left Germany of course,\nyou weren\u2019t allowed to take any valuables with you, anything that was called der\nwiesen(ph), de wiesen(ph) is what the Germans \u2014 what you consider either cash or\nanything that is of international value that can be translated into money afterwards. And\nof course, jewelry was already \u2014 I think there was also in August \u201938 that Jews had to\nturn 1n all their gold, they weren\u2019t allowed to have any jewelry other than their wedding\nrings. And well, what do you do with that? Yeah, how di\u2014 ho-how \u2014 do you keep your\ndiamonds, do you keep, if you have any, you know, decision. And then if the house was\nsearched and the \u2014 they find anything, you\u2019d be \u2014 everything would taken, you \u2014 they\ncould do whatever they wanted to. You were \u2014 you had broken an existing law, whatever.\nMarch 16, 2001\nSo \u2014 but I think my mother kept her \u2014 her diamond ring or whatever. Bril \u2014 brilliant ring,\nthat was. And some family jewels that we didn\u2019t turn in, had it \u2014 had been in the family\nfor a couple of generations, we refused to turn in. See, you took the chances on that, you\ndefied \u2014 you defied the orders and you tried to hide it or get it out, or whatever.",
        "A: Well, he \u2014 no, he didn\u2019t. I mean, he was only home a week. Yeah, I saw him only for a\nweek because he came back on December 16\" and I left on the 24\". But now I had to \u2014 I\nhad a stamp collection, which was a \u2014 you know, I collected stamps. Uncle Wilhelm\nfrom Holland was in international business, he would send me stamps, I collected, I had\na \u2014 I had a German album. I had a nice collection.",
        "A: Wil \u2014 Wilhelm Marx. Wilhelm in Dutch. So I \u2014 so that I would not have to open my\nsuitcase at the Dutch border, you could have it examined locally, you would ta \u2014 you\ncould take it to the finance amt, the \u2014 the \u2014 the tax hall, or whatever, tax inspector and\nthey also were responsible for customs, and have it inspected and sealed there, and that\nseal then, you could take it acro \u2014 so my mother didn\u2019t want me to have to unpack my\nstuff, open it up at two o\u2019clock in the morning when I was at the Dutch border. So I put\nmy suitcase on my bicycle, took my bicycle over there and I went by myself. My mother\ndid not go with me. I went by myself, 14 years old. We grew up, we had to be\nMarch 16, 2001\nindependent, we had to be self sufficient and we learned \u2014 I mean, we had no childhood,\nwe were \u2014 we were young adults. I mean, we were \u2014 there was no time for childhood. So,\nthey looked at the stuff, everything, your \u2014 all the clothes that you took out, nothing could\nbe new, everything had to be washed so that you couldn\u2019t resell it in a foreign country.\nEverything had to have a monogram and \u2014 or initials in \u2014 1n it, either sewn on or\nembroidered. Everything had to be identified as being your personal whatever. I took my\nstamp albums with me, and this a \u2014 one agent looked at it and he says, stamps? I don\u2019t\nthink you can take stamps. I knew that you couldn\u2019t take stamps, this was \u2014 because\nstamps was a wonderful way of transferring value out and selling it in the \u2014 you know,\nand turn it into money. I knew that. I said, what do you mean, I can\u2019t? And then the o \u2014\nanother agent came. He says, oh come on, he says, that\u2019s a \u2014 that\u2019s a student collection,\nlet him take the stamps. And inside \u2014 of course I didn\u2019t move a muscle, you know, but\ninside I know, boy I got here \u2014 I got one past them. I \u2014 and of course, I took my s \u2014 my\nstamps and I came to the border at one o\u2019clock in the morning and \u2014",
        "A: Oh no, no \u2014 oh yes, I went back home and then I\u2019m \u2014 this was a couple of days before.",
        "A: And then with the \u2014 with the suitcase with the seal on it and the rucksack with the\nstuff and \u2014 you know.\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: Well, I really don\u2019t remember. Tearful, I suppose. And my parents took me to the train\nstation. I don\u2019t even remember if my father went along, because he wasn\u2019t good for\nanything, he was just [indecipherable]. I \u2014 I think only my mother went with me. I think\nI said goodbye to my father at home and my mother took me to the train station, and I got\non the train to Rotterdam and at the border, the, you know, came, pass(ph) kontrolle,\nyou know, koffer auf machen. And I said ma \u2014 it had the \u2014 the suitcase has already been\ninspected and sealed. They looked at the seal, okay, can put it back up, and that was it,\nand inside I was laughing. And \u2014 well, then as I rolled through the Dutch countryside, it\nlooked awfully good, seeing the cows and you know, the \u2014 came \u2014 arrived in Rotterdam.\nOf course, my uncle met me at the train station and it was a whole new life. So now I was\nsafe in Holland and my mother, in the meantime \u2014 now, my father had been released\nfrom Oranienburg. He had to sign a waiver that \u2014 yeah, he had to sign a paper. Germans\nwere great at that, I\u2019m sure you know that, that he was not mistreated in any way and that\nhe would leave Germany within 90 days. At that point, of course, they only wanted to\nget rid of the Germans \u2014 oh, of the Jews, and you could even at that point still take your\nfurniture with you, anything that was personal belongings, so my \u2014 my mother had to do\neverything, she did everything, arranged for a \u2014 in Bremen, which was the other port,\nbesides Hamburg, to have a \u2014 well, today we would call it a container, was a\nliftbahn(ph). There was a huge box, room size was built and your furniture were put into\nit and everything was packed, so she prepared for that. And by March, March 15\" they\nMarch 16, 2001\nhad to leave because my father\u2019s 90 days were up, and my uncle managed to get them\ninto Holland because we had the American visa applications, he could prove to the\nDutch government that we were only in transit and that he would \u2014 he had to guarantee of\ncourse, that he \u2014 he would vou \u2014 that we wouldn\u2019t be a financial burden to the Dutch\ngovernment. The Dutch did a lot, more than most, but \u2014 they took children, but a-adults?\nNobody wanted the Jews. So in \u2014 you know, in transit we could stay then, and we \u2014 my\nparents rented a room to live in and we ate at my uncles, and it was a\u2014 I went to s \u2014 of\ncourse started going to school in Holland, went to a trade school and learned a trade and\non \u2014 then the American visa came up and my parents ni \u2014 the decision, the family\ndecision was to take \u2014 we had three numbers that my mother had gotten for my father, my\nmother and me. Harry was already in Holland. But the decision was made, since he was\nthe older one, he had already completed school, he was already, you know, an apprentice\nat a electri \u2014 electrician\u2019s job, to take him along to America because my father was unfit\nto work, he was emotionally, physically broken, he really never regained his health. The\nAmerican consulate was very kind and looked the other way and \u2014 and I mean, they\ncould be tough too, you know. As a matter of fact, the \u2014 when they were called \u2014 we were\ncalled to the American consulate for the examination, had to be a physical examination\ninterview before you got your American visa stamped into your passport. And we went\nalready a couple of weeks before and we listened in the \u2014 in the anteroom as people were\nreading the eye chart. First line, A, E, F, G, K. Line two, etcetera, and we wrote it down\nMarch 16, 2001\nand my father memorized it. And came time for him to examine, sat there and he started\nreciting it. I\u2019m sure, yeah, the examiner looked at his glasses, he must have known, yeah.\nNow, read this line again, my father \u2014 yeah, and he would point at the bottom line, and\nyou know. Anyway, he passed and they left with my brother.",
        "A: Because she was thinking Harry is safe in Holland, you know? That\u2019s why. But we\ncould have \u2014 the American consul in \u2014 in Rotterdam said to my mother, why don\u2019t you\ntake your s \u2014 take Kurt with you also? Said well, we want him to finish school here, and\nUncle Wilhelm, who was in an international business, he was 1n contact with people all\nover the world, he was a grain merchant and he was convinced that Holland would\nremain neutral. I mean, don\u2019t forget, in the meantime the war had started, the Sitzkrieg as\nit was called. I don\u2019t know, you familiar with that term? The sitting war, where French\nand Germans were staring at each other across their fortification, the Maginot line and\nthe Siegfried line.",
        "A: And, I mean, the war had started in August \u201939.",
        "A: And so we were aware of what was going on, you know, but my uncle was convinced\nthat \u2014 that Holland would remain neutral, that the Germans would need Rotterdam as a\nwindow to the world, just as they did during World War I and so he convinced my\nMarch 16, 2001\nmother to let me stay in Holland and finish school. And it made business sense, you\ncome to America, I was still of school age, my father couldn\u2019t work, who is gonna\nsupport us, right?",
        "A: Didn\u2019t matter. My thought \u2014 I mean, whatever the \u2014 whatever the decision was,\nchildren weren\u2019t asked in those days and I was \u2014 I was happy to stay with my uncle and\nfinish school and all. I thought it was best for me to finish school rather than starting to \u2014\nyou know, and I studied English, I was learning English, and to go to America as\nprepared as I could be rather than coming in there having no trade, not knowing your\nlanguage, etcetera. So it was \u2014 was a rational decision and we were \u2014 we were convinced\nthat Holland would stay neutral. So anyway \u2014 so there was the story. So they left on\nApril 5\u201c, 1940. While they were at sea, on April 10,1940, Germany invaded Norway\nand overran Denmark, and my mother was in panic.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nMarch 16, 2001\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Yes, it is April 5\", 1940, they \u2014 my parents have \u2014 and Harry have left for America\nand I guess it\u2019s April 10\" now and they have found out about the invasion of \u2014 by\nGermany of Norway and Denmark and my mother is panicked and up in arms and of\ncourse she wrote a letter on board which was posted in New York, air mail, via Lisbon\nto americ \u2014 to \u2014 to Holland and reached us, I guess, just before the invasion of the\nNetherlands by the Germans. And of course on May 10\", 1940, six o\u2019clock in the\nmorning, we woke up and I heard planes, and having lived in Celle, where we had two air\nbases nearby, I knew by sound all the German planes, and I woke up and I heard and I\nsaid to my uncle, Uncle Wilhelm, I said, those sound like Ju-52. That\u2019s the Junkers 52\ntransport plane that was used for parachute jumps. He says, you\u2019re crazy. Ah, I was right,\nand he wasn\u2019t. For once he was not right. And well, the invasion came. The Dutch, who\nthought that if they inundated the \u2014 you know, th-the \u2014 the land and they could stop the\nGermans, but the Germans came by parachute. They \u2014 we lived in Rotterdam, they came\ndown and \u2014 and the Dutch Marines held the Maas bridges for three days, didn\u2019t surrender\nthem to the Germans, and I as a German citizen, having a German passport, which\nincidentally was on the \u2014 in the \u2014 at the American consulate in Rotterdam, we \u2014 I was \u2014\nMarch 16, 2001\nthe Dutch police came, since I was registered as a German citizen living with my uncle in\nHolland. The fact that you are Jewish, well, didn\u2019t mean anything to the Dutch. You\nwere German or you were Dutch or you were whatever. And politically it didn\u2019t make\nany difference. I mean, the individual policeman could have been sympathetic and knew\nwhat a \u2014 that the German Jews were not \u2014 you know, in \u2014 were not sympathetic to the\nGerman government, but there were also a lot of other Germans living in Holland who\nmight have been, and there was a fifth column in Holland, wa \u2014 a Nazi party run by\nMussert. And the Mussert Nazis in Holland were a force and the \u2014 so we were interned\nand my uncle, of course, you can imagine how he felt. He had convinced my mother to\nlet me stay and, you know, go to school in Holland, and I was being interned, and now\nwe didn't know what was gonna happen. So they took us to all the other \u2014 I knew some of\nthe German refugees, Jewish refugees in Holland and we were all taken to a large\nmeeting hall, which was right next to the police headquarters and we were kept there.\nThey brought in mattresses, they put them down on the big dance floor in the dance hall\nand that was our temporary lodgings. And we were there for four days and then on May\n14\" at noon \u2014 we were kept informed of what was happening, now there was \u2014 already\nthere were rumors that the Dutch \u2014 the \u2014 that the Germans had poisoned the water. This\nwas all \u2014 the fifth column spread these rumors to force the Dutch to surrender, and there\nwere all sorts of rumors spreading and anyway, th \u2014 by one o\u2019clock the Germans start \u2014\n1:30 the Germans started bombing Rotterdam. Now Rotterdam had been declared an\nMarch 16, 2001\nopen city as of noon on Tuesday because the Dutch were ready to surrender and they\ndidn\u2019t want the t-town \u2014 it\u2019s not a military target to \u2014 to be bombed, but the Germans\nbombed it anyway, claiming that the order came too late and they couldn\u2019t stop the\nbombers that were on the way, like they had no radio, or whatever. And they bombed\nRotterdam and of course as soon as the bombs started falling and our building was\nbombed too, the man standing next to me was hit by a shrapnel. I had learned in\nGermany \u2014 as part of our preparation for the war, when I was still going to school, we\nhad air raid drills. Oh, there was a systematic preparation of the German population for\nwar. That if there\u2019s an air raid and you\u2019re in a building, stand in a doorway. That\u2019s what I\ndid, and that\u2019s what saved me. So \u2014",
        "A: We were \u2014 yes, right. But of course the Dutch guards who were assigned to guard us,\nthey said look, you know, we\u2019re being bombed, run, save yourselves. They let us go.\nThey knew it was over, and you know, there was no sense in keeping us. So I ran home.",
        "A: No, no, my uncle \u2014 I was \u2014 I was the \u2014 he was a Dutch citizen, he wasn\u2019t touched. I as\na 15 year old was interned by the Dutch. He was a Dutch citizen, he wasn\u2019t touched. So\nhe didn't know what happened to me and he tried to find out and they said well, we are\nsafe and we are being well fed, which we were, and \u2014 but we were retained. And they\nMarch 16, 2001\ncouldn\u2019t put us in jail, they didn\u2019t have enough jail space. So they interned us 1n this\ndance hall. So I ran home and \u2014",
        "A: No, nothing, there\u2019s no communication. There are no telephone call. You are interned,\nyou\u2019re out of \u2014 that\u2019s it. And \u2014",
        "A: I managed, I managed, there\u2019s \u2014 there wasn\u2019t \u2014 there wasn\u2019t a problem, I \u2014 I was self\nsufficient. You \u2014 when you grew up in Nazi Germany, at age 14 I was self sufficient,\ncertainly at age 15, yeah, just was a year later. So I had no \u2014 I had no problems with that.\nI\u2014I could fend for myself. And I ran home. I went into our house, I had the keys. And\nmy uncle\u2019s car wasn\u2019t there and a couple of his personal things were gone, so I knew that\nhe had left. I took my bicycle, took a few things into my rucksack and took my stamp\ncollection that I had saved once, put them the back on my bike and took off with the bike\nand out of the city. Now, we only had \u2014 we had relatives who lived in a suburb called\nHillerhausberg(ph), and I decided to go there, but to go there I had to well, go through a\nrailroad \u2014 go through a railroad underpass and of course the road was jammed with cars,\nbut I was on a bicycle, there were a few other people on bicycles, you know, Holland is a\n\u2014 bicycle is a means of transportation and there weren\u2019t that many cars in 1940. But I got\nthrough this traffic jam with my bicycle faster than the cars and I went to\nMarch 16, 2001\nHillerhausberg(ph) and when I got there I saw my uncle\u2019s car standing in front of the\nhouse that I was visiting, of course he was very happy to see me. He didn\u2019t know what\nhad hap \u2014 what would happen to me, whether I was alive, or whatever. And so we had a\nhappy reunion. Then that night and then the following night we saw Rotterdam burn.\nThe Germans had thrown a lot of incendiary bombs and Rotterdam went up in smoke,\nthe old Rotterdam. And then eventually, after I guess about four or five days after the\nfires were out we returned back to our address on Mauritsweg, and we found that the\ncity was well, burned, the center of the city. And our house was the second house left\nstanding. Next to us \u2014 these are very much like the brownstones in New York. They are\none room wide and foos \u2014 three stories high, but they\u2019re with a stoop. And our house was\nstanding. Our neighbor\u2019s next to us was standing and that was the m \u2014 consul of Monaco\nlived there and the flag was still flying. And I came into our house, nothing was touched.\nThere was no pilfering, there was no looting, not a window was broken. It was, yeah,\nreally everything was untouched. Well, we moved back in, but now the \u2014 the Germans of\ncourse came \u2014 came in that very afternoon. I saw Germans everywhere and we really felt\nwe were \u2014 well, we were occupied.",
        "A: Terrible. It was really, I mean like \u2014 like a 10 ton weight was put on you. Before I had\nfelt free, that freedom I felt when I left the German border behind me, this, you know,\nbreathing free, and no \u2014 now I don\u2019t have to watch any more what I am saying, I don\u2019t\nMarch 16, 2001\nhave to be on my guard constantly. You don\u2019t have to look over your shoulder or try and\nanticipate what the people around you do, how they act and react and all that. All that\nwas gone, and \u2014 but at least I knew what to expect and what to do. Now the Germans, at\nthat point they came in and they really tried to befriend, or have the Dutch befriend them.\nThey were \u2014 they did not act as occupiers or so, at least their, well, PR relations, as we\nwould say today, they \u2014 they really tried to win the Dutch over to them by, you know,\npropaganda articles, radio broadcasts. Of course everything was taken over, we are not\nhere, we \u2014 we \u2014 this was a tactical move, we had to do that to prevent the British from\ninvading you. And we are, you know, you \u2014 or you are Aryan just as we are, and try to,\nyou know, take that tack to win the Dutch over. But in the meantime, of course, the\nDutch knew what the Germans were like, most Dutch. And that were there to grab the\nfood and they were exba \u2014 sending all the produce \u2014 Holland was known for cream and\ncheese and butter and all the, you know, good things in life that \u2014 that was being sent to\nGermany, and of course that was the case. So \u2014",
        "A: My \u2014 no, I \u2014 as \u2014 as they used to say in America, I could pass. I didn\u2019t look Jewish.\nThere\u2019s a little anecdote I can tell you that happened in 1936 while I was still in \u2014 in\nGermany, and Harry, my brother was still in class. Of course the edict had come down,\nthe instructions that race theory had to be taught in school. And that \u2014 our biology teacher\nMarch 16, 2001\nha \u2014 also happened to be my brother\u2019s homeroom teacher. So one day 1-1n class, says\nwell, today we will talk about the Aryan race. We know of course that the characteristics\nof the Aryan race are a long \u2014 you know, oval face, high forehead, blue eyes, straight\nnose, blon \u2014 blonde hair. And he looked around the classroom and he said, like Roberg,\nfor instance. And he did that very deliberately, to make a point. I don\u2019t know on \u2014 how\nmany got the point that he made in the class, but he did it because he felt good about tt. It\nturned out \u2014 I found out after \u2014 I visited this teacher, Dr. Riegerberg(ph) after the war\nwhen I came back to Germany, and I visited with him, and I found out then that he had a\nJewish grandmother that some of his colleagues knew about, but nobody would tell. And\nthey protected him until 1944 when the director of the school thought it was best if he\nwould take early retirement, just to protect him. So those were the games people played,\nokay, and that was \u2014 so you asked me whether I looked Jewish, that\u2019s my answer.",
        "A: We\u2019re back in Rotterdam. My uncle sold his car. I taught him how to ride a bike, he\nhadn\u2019t ridden a bike since he was a boy. And we \u2014 well, we pared down. His business, of\ncourse, was gone. He was a well-to-do man, but you know, there was no more\ninternational grain trade. And my \u2014 I had no papers at this point. My passport had been at\nthe American consulate, which went up in flames with the rest of the city. So first I had to\nget anew German passport, and that took about three months. By \u2014\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: From the Germans, no. During the bombing, mm, I ran pretty fast. But not really. I\ncan\u2019t say that I was ever afraid because \u2014 I think because I was prepared, I was \u2014 you\nknow, as a child I think the air raid drills, that\u2019s something to \u2014 really that has served me\nwell throughout my life is I believe in preparation because I learned nearly in life that\npreparation and knowing what your alternatives are, making several choices, having a\nplan A, B and C is good planning and gets you set, you know, for various eventualities.\nSo maybe I can, you know, look at that as a positive thing that came out of this. Anyway,\nby about July, August, the Germans were, of course, pre-preparing for the invasion of\nGreat Britain. And whatever was afloat, they requisitioned. They were requisitioning\nevery barge, every boat, every whatever. But is also showed to us and the Dutch that they\nreally hadn\u2019t prepared \u2014 I think the war went so well for them, both in France and\nBelgium and in Holland, you know, they wiped out the allies and came to \u2014 to the North\nSea and the channel, and really weren't prepared to invade \u2014 to invade England when the\ntime was right. Had they prepared a \u2014 an invasion fleet to follow up on the ground\nvictory, England would have been mincemeat. So then they \u2014 the \u2014 well, the Battle of\nBritain and the air war started and we followed that, of course, from Holland and we\nwould listen to BBC. The mul \u2014 the Dutch channel, the Orange channel broadcast every\nnight at nine o\u2019clock and all Dutch would listen to that. And of course you risked\nwhatever, your freedom, your life, if the Germans found out that you listened to \u2014 to \u2014\nMarch 16, 2001\nand they could arrest you, arrest you, but you took the chance and you did it discreetly,\nand \u2014",
        "A: At that point in Holland, yes, they couldn't control it. In Germany, of course, Jews\nweren\u2019t allowed to have radios any more since 1936, I think. But yes, you were allowed\nto have radio because the \u2014 also they, at that point still wanted to look like the good\nGermans so they didn\u2019t come out with the edicts of no radios, or no this or that. Of\ncourse, it was known that \u2014 that you weren't allowed to listen to the enemy, but who\ncared?",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question. I remember my 16\" birthday, yes, and we celebrated it in\nHillerhausberg(ph) and my uncle was \u2014 and I was exceedingly glad to be able to\ncelebrate it. I don\u2019t know how we celebrated it, but I guess we found a little cake. You\nknow, the Dutch are very good at finding sweets somewhere, so I\u2019m sure that we did it\nthe right way. I don\u2019t remember the details, but yes, yeah, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s interesting for you to\nnote that it was right there in the thick of it, while Rotterdam burned. By about August\nthen, when the invasion plans of the Germans became more prominent, all German born\nJews were ordered to leave the coastal zone of, I think 25 kilometers. So I had to move\nfrom Rotterdam and an aunt and uncle of mine, who were the parents of a cousin, ma \u2014\nthat\u2019s my uncle\u2019s older sister and her husband, they had also come to Holland because\nMarch 16, 2001\nher daughter lived in Holland. And we then had to move out of the Rotterdam area,\nfurther inland and we went to How-da, which to Americans in pronounced Gouda,\nwhere the cheese comes from. And I con \u2014 we rented a small apartment in a farmhouse\nand Aunt Lena kept house for her husband and me and I went to trade school. I resigned\nfrom the Rotterdam trade school that I went to and went to the trade school, continued in\ntrade school in Gouda.",
        "A: Oh, I was studying auto mechanics. But in order to become an auto mechanic the first\nyear we had to work on bicycles, the second year on motorcycles and the third year on\nautomobiles. So I was up to working on an old Nash engine. And while we were there,\nmy uncle, in the meantime or \u2014 yeah, I \u2014 I had to get a new passport which eventually I \u2014\nI got from the Germans, of course, you know, with the new photo and a big J stamped\ninto it again, J for Jew.",
        "A: Oh yes. Kurt \u2014 Kurt Walter Israel. I still have the passport, so I can check that. And\nwell, went to school and we heard from America. Of course, America heard from us via\nPortugal. I still have the card, the first card that we sent to America, a postcard. You\nwere only allowed to send postcards, no letters, because it was easier for the Germans to\ncensor them. Read a postcard easier than opening up a letter and closing it again. Where\nwe \u2014\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: Very interesting that you \u2014 I have the postcard. We wrote it, of course, in Dutch, even\nthough my parents didn\u2019t understand Dutch, but Harry was there to translate it, and I\nwouldn\u2019t have written in German for all the tea in China.",
        "A: Because we hated the Germans. I felt like a \u2014 like a Dutch person, I wanted to have\nnothing to do with \u2014 with Germans and I sort of denied that I \u2014 you know, that I certainly\nwould not let them know, or give them the satisfaction or make it easy for them to read\nmy mail. So this was \u2014 this is the only way we could get back. But there was that, you\nknow, resentment \u2014 well, resentment, you\u2019re gonna make it as tough for them as possible.",
        "A: No, we spoke Dutch only. Oh no, we \u2014 we \u2014 at that point we wouldn\u2019t have spoken\nGerman for anything, either in public or even in private. With my uncle and aunt, I mean,\nAunt Lena of course, I had to speak German because they didn\u2019t understand any Dutch.\nBut I was fluent in Dutch and of course, you know, in school. So \u2014 no, but we wouldn't\nhave spoken German for anything, so my corresponding was in \u2014 but I wrote everything\nin \u2014 well, we had a\u2014acode. This interesting point that you make. This is something that\nwe had already developed while living in Germany. When \u2014 when we wrote from\nGermany, let\u2019s say to Holland or to relatives, we would write it in such a way that they\nunderstood what we were talking about but nobody else could. For instance, in Celle, the\nMarch 16, 2001\n\u2014 the captain of the volunteer fire brigade, his name was Schnell, which happens to be\nquick, okay? Schnell. So I wrote on this postcard, we are well. Our old neighbor Herr\nSchnell had plenty of work for at least a week. So they knew how to interpret that, the\ncensor didn\u2019t. So this is how we got the information across without, you know \u2014 anyway,\nit worked for us and I think all families had that. Or we would \u2014 we would refer to family\nmembers who were already somewhere else, you know. If \u2014 if we had a relative, let\u2019s say,\nin Switzerland, we would say Uncle S-Simon, you know, we were able to get in touch\nwith Uncle Simon and send him something. Meaning we were able to send something to\nSwitzerland, okay? So that\u2019s how we disguised information. I think that was pretty\ncommon. You just had to adapt to conditions, and you did. And it became actually, a\nsport to try to outwit the Germans. That was our mentality and it was also, that\u2019s what\nkept us going. Chronologically now I want to move on to \u2014 my uncle, of course, was\ntrying desperately at that point to try and get me to America. Don\u2019t forget, America was\nstill neutral. Then he found out in oh, about in October, November must have been,\nsometime in the fall of 1940 that someone in Holland tried to organize a children\u2019s\ntransport to save or to reunite children who were left behind in Holland with parents who\nwere already in America. [ only found out about 10 years ago when I was in \u2014 in\nAmsterdam at the war museum and archives, who this woman was. And that was Mrs.\nWijsmuller. She was \u2014 and my uncle found out about it because her husband was a\nshipping magnate. He \u2014 he owned steamships. And my uncle was, you know, dealt with\nMarch 16, 2001\nsteamship companies, being in the grain business. And Mrs. vice \u2014 Mefrau Wijsmuller,\nthey were not Jewish, of course, had very good relations with the Germans, German\nofficers, in particular.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: Mefrau Wijsmuller, spelled w-i-j-s-m-u-l-l-e-r. Mefrau Wijsmuller had very good\nrelationships with German officers and other than with the Nazis and the \u2014 a lot of the\nmilitary were not necessarily \u2014 the professional military were not necessarily in\nagreement with what the Nazi party did, or the SS did. So there was la \u2014 she had \u2014 she\nhad good connections all the way to the top in Holland, and in Germany. And she was\napparently able to persuade the Germans to let her do humanitarian things, taking \u2014 you\nknow, reuniting children after the war who were in Holland and Belgium with the\nparents who were in southern France, etcetera. She would make a trip with six or eight\nchildren and take them to be reunited. On the way she would \u2014 she \u2014 she would also take\nmedicines with her and medical supplies and she was really quite a force, and obviously\nvery persuasive and would tha \u2014 now, there was an \u2014 there was an incident at the border\ntoo, that I understand she arranged fo \u2014 where she bribed the border guards with a couple\nof bottles of whiskey, etcetera. Here, have a good time, let me bring these children across,\nMarch 16, 2001\nyou know. And she was \u2014 she was really very good at what she did. So she tried to get\nthis \u2014 this experimental group going and I think she also enlisted or tried to enlist the Red\nCross and in America the HIAS, etcetera. She pushed all buttons, and was able to then\narrange for an experimental group. There were two groups, one that I was on, which was\nthe first group. We left Amsterdam on January 31, 1941. I had gotten my \u2014 oh, I\u2019m\nsorry, I\u2019m \u2014 cancel that. I got my American visa in Amsterdam on January 31, 1941.\nNow that I had the visa, I was eligible for Mefrau Wijsmuller\u2019s group of other\nyoungsters who were also getting their American visas during February, and on March\nfirst, we left Amsterdam. But, under the German rules we had to go back to Berlin\nbecause all trans \u2014 all officially sanctioned tr-transports out of greater Germany and\noccupied lands, originated in Berlin.",
        "A: It was hard for me to leave Holland because even though we were occupied, I was\nstill among friends and now, I mean the feeling when we were on the train and we came\nback across the German border, I mean, there was still a border between Holland and\nGermany, but the border didn\u2019t mean anything, but now everything was \u2014 and now we\nwere traveling as a group of young Jews and well, we knew how to behave. We were all\nGerman Jewish \u2014 German, yeah, refugees. The oldest was 17, I was 15 and the youngest\ngirl was 11.\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: I was 16. So we \u2014 we went back into Germany and we were told that we would get \u2014",
        "A: Very oppressive. Of course, we only spoke Dutch. We did not acknowledge that we\ncould speak German, even though we had German passports. We could have been, you\nknow, b-bor \u2014 come as children to Holland, we did not acknowledge Germany in any\nway. And among ourselves we spoke Dutch so that not everybody could understand what\nwe were saying. We arrived in Berlin and we were taken under the wing \u2014 well, we\narrived actually in two groups. There was our group of, I think eight, and then four more\ncame, or five more came a few days later. The plan was that we would stay one week in\nBerlin. There was a transport from Berlin once a week, from Berlin to Lisbon. Now, I\nhad received \u2014 oh, my uncle had received from my mother in America, a transatlantic\ncable stating that passage had been booked \u2014 passage booked for Kurt, American a \u2014\nexport company, 210 dollars paid, reservation booked from lis \u2014 Lisbon, New York,\nleaving March 15\". And I had that telegram \u2014 cable. I had nothing else. I had no ticket or\nanything, just the acknowledgement. When we got to Berlin and we were lodged by the \u2014\nby the Jewish congregation in Berlin at a place which was home \u2014 old age home.\nAltersheim. Located at Grosse Hamburger Strasse, number 19. It was a home for the\naged and was also a school and th \u2014 the building \u2014 behind the building, behind the school\nbuilding there was a gymnasi \u2014 a gym and that gym had been converted into a makeshift\nhall where there were about 80 \u2014 anywhere between 80 and 120 cots. A curtain was\nMarch 16, 2001\ndrawn in the middle for men on the \u2014 on one side, women on the other. There was one\npotbelly stove in the center for what passed as heat. It was all, you know, improvised, but\nit worked and the people that were there knew they were gonna be there only a short\ntime, but it was a transient location. We ate there where they had kitchen, we ate three\nmeals a day there and the Jewish community took care of that.",
        "A: Well, that was \u2014 that was arranged by the committee. The committee in \u2014 in\nAmsterdam that had arranged for us to, you know, and was in communication with\nBerlin. And there was also a group in Lisbon, the Jewish community, and I think the\nHIAS was sort of the overriding Jewish organization that coordinated that.",
        "A: Well, there was one man \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 thi \u2014 well, not at large. There was a man who was assigned to us. He was \u2014 he was\nthe contact, so we didn\u2019t just \u2014 you know, he was the contact, and we also in the group,\nthe oldest person \u2014 oh, there were two, there was one woman, Judith, she was 17, and\nthere was a fellow with whom I became very friendly, Jerry Cohen(ph) was 17. They\nwere the \u2014 the senior people and they sort of, you know, took everybody\u2019s passport so\nthat \u2014 there had to be an organization. They were in charge. Anyway, the first day, of\nMarch 16, 2001\ncourse, within 24 hours, within Germany, certainly within Europe, when you move, you\nknow, you have to register. When you leave Holland, whe-when I left Gouda, I had to\ngo to the city hall and say, I\u2019m leaving, I\u2019m going to Berlin, I will be in Berlin, okay?\nAnd then when I \u2014 when we got to Berlin we had to say, we are now in Berlin, we come\nfrom Gouda, etcetera, records, you know, transfer every \u2014 and everything with stamps\nand so we had to go to the city police in Berlin and s-state that we were there for one\nweek, we were staying at Grosse Hamburger Strasse and we were going \u2014 after one\nweek we would go \u2014 you know, continue on to Lisbon, we were in transit. Fine, got\npermission to stay for seven days, no problem. But after seven days we did not have our\ntransit visas for Spain. We needed transit visas for \u2014 well, France wasn\u2019t a problem, that\nwas an occupied country. It\u2019s \u2014 the Germans were in charge, but Spain and Portugal\nwere. And our passports were taken to \u2014 were taken to the Spanish consulate and they\nsaid oh, we will be glad to give you the visa, as soon as you have the Portuguese visa.\nWhat\u2019s the sense of giving you a Spanish, you don\u2019t even have the Portuguese? And\nunless we can be assured that you have the Portuguese so that you don\u2019t get stuck in\nSpain, we will give it to you. Went to the Portuguese. Of course we will give you\nPortuguese visa, as soon as you have the Spanish visa. What\u2019s the sense of giving you a\nPortuguese, you don\u2019t even have the Spanish? Get the Spanish and you will get the\nPortuguese, okay? Catch 22. We went back to the Spaniards and told them. And oh no,\nthey\u2019re wrong, they \u2014 we will give you the \u2014 1t went back and forth. This took, of course,\nMarch 16, 2001\nmore than a week so after seven days we had to go back to the Berlin police to get an\nextension of our permit to stay. Now they got nasty, and they hollered at us in German.\nYou\u2019re eating the bread that the German workers are entitled to. The implication was that\nif we didn\u2019t work, we wouldn't eat. Now we also had heard and we knew that once you\nwere assigned as a labor force, if they put you into a factory, you were \u2014 became war\nessential. You could take your American visa and whatever, okay? You would never get\nyour exit permit. So they gave us another one week extension. Now within that week we\nstill did not have the papers. Now they said well, the \u2014 Berlin is not responsible for these\npapers, the American visa was issued in Holland. The \u2014 these people came from\nHolland, they should have gotten their Portuguese and Spanish transit visas in Holland,\nnot in Berlin. So they took our passports and sent them back to Amsterdam. Now we\nwere without identification. We got, I guess, a temporary, you know, bu \u2014 I \u2014I.D. card,\nwhatever from the \u2014 from the \u2014 Berlin. Now we did not dare to, you know, go out or\nwhatever. If we \u2014 if we would be caught without that \u2014 you know, you have to \u2014 you have\nto expl \u2014 well, we did go out, but only \u2014 things were very controlled in Berlin already at\nthat time. The British would fly over and bomb occasionally. It was not \u2014 but they would\ncome across, so there were air raids at night. The food was rationed, of course. And Jews\nhad special ration coupons. Everything was by coupons and the Jewish coupons were\nstamped with a red J. Jews were only allowed to buy after four p.m. There was nothing\nleft by four p.m. You go into a bakery, you took whatever \u2014 if they had anything left you\nMarch 16, 2001\ntook what, you know, didn\u2019t say well, I want a rye bread, you took whatever they had,\nright. Those were the conditions. Anyway, the Jewish congregation \u2014 and I\u2019m going to\ntry and find out how they did that, had a \u2014 had a gimmick. They protected us from being\nassigned to the workforce, and it worked as follows. We were assigned as a workforce in\nBerlin Wannsee. Now, I don\u2019t know whether you know what Wannsee. Wannsee was\nthere was a large estate which was \u2014 course had been Jewish, that was confiscated and\nhad been made as a R and R retreat for the SS. They were still in the process of fixing\nthat up and the Jewish congregation apparently had somehow managed to arrange that\nthey will supply X number of workers every day. Let\u2019s say 50 workers for doing ground\nkeeping etcetera. So now we were assigned twice a week to go out and work in\nWannsee. The Gestapo out there didn\u2019t care who came. Now we were \u2014 we were briefed,\nwe were told, you will see people in striped suits that are guarded by soldiers with guns.\nDon\u2019t even look at them, make no eye contact with anyone. Don\u2019t talk to anyone. Don\u2019t\ntalk among each other other than necessary, even the people that you know. Do your\nwork, keep your head down, mind your own business, don\u2019t make waves, okay? So, with\nthose instructions we took the S-Bahn, the subway, the elevated out to Wannsee and we\nwent to work, raking, cleaning up, whatever they told us to do. And now we had to go\nback after two weeks to the city police. What are you doing, you have been here \u2014 are\nyou \u2014 what \u2014 we are working for Gestapo Wannsee. That\u2019s all they had to hear. We got\nour stamp. You can stay. We had the extension. And that\u2019s how they rotated people who\nMarch 16, 2001\nwere about to leave to protect them from being entered into the labor force. And I\u2019m\ngoing to try and find out in Berlin when I am there this spring if they know how they\nmanaged to do that. In the meantime, political things march on. Things in the Balkan\nweren\u2019t going too well. We were watching, of course the political or the \u2014 how the war\ndeveloped. So far, for Germany everything went right. Italy started to invade Albany,\nAlbany couldn\u2019t be invaded.",
        "A: Alb \u2014 right, Albania. What did I say, alba \u2014 Albania. Albany is upstate New York.\nAlbania. And the Germans had to go and help them out and then the invasion of Greece\nas a follow up. They parachute jumped to Crete. By this time it was April and we said oh\nwell, if the war expands, maybe we\u2019ll never get out. And we still didn\u2019t have our papers.\nThey were still haggling in Amsterdam and Berlin. We still didn\u2019t have our passports.",
        "A: We\u2019re still working Wannsee.",
        "A: Right. Now it was \u2014 finally, by the end of April we said well, we are getting our\npapers, and we did get our papers finally, and now we were preparing, we were told the\ntrip takes five days. You will leave on \u2014 maybe in two or three weeks you will be able to\nget on the train. And I was telling them my, you know, my visa \u2014 my visa expired May\n318. I didn\u2019t have all that much time left. My American visa was issued January 31\u201c. It\nMarch 16, 2001\nexpired May 31\u201c. By that time I had to be on the boat. So time was getting short for me,\nthe other kids had maybe a week or two more, but not a lot. One day \u2014 well \u2014 how much\ntime do you \u2014 how much time do you have left? So one day, it was, I guess end of April\nor so, and I was walking past a Woolworth and there wa \u2014 it is \u2014 was a Woolworth,\nthere was a Woolworth in Berlin, and it was like 9:30 in the morning. And I saw that\nthey had a big ad in the window, Thermosflaschen(ph), Thermos bottles. They had a\nspecial. So \u2014 but Thermos bottles in Germany weren\u2019t that easy to come by during the\nwar. So my God, it\u2019s 9:30, I walked into this store. I would \u2014 and they were pretty cheap\ntoo, like four mark or something like that. I said yes, I would like some Thermos bottles,\nyes. I need 13. 13 Thermos bottles? Yes. He says, why do you need 13? I said, we\u2019re\ngoing on an excursion from school and you know, we \u2014 we all going and I need \u2014 of\ncourse I said this in perfect German. Are you sh \u2014 are you Aryan? Sind sie arisch? I said\nyes. He says, may I see your Ausweis? I said, I don\u2019t have an Ausweis, I have a passport.\nLet me see your passport. I said my passport is at the \u2014 at the German embassy. Are you\nsure you\u2019re Aryan? I said look, I am Auslandsdeutsche. Now I don\u2019t know whether you\nknow what that it. Auslandsdeutsche they \u2014 in Germany they had a very special\nstanding because they were the Germans, the Aryan, the good Germans, Aryan Germans\nwho lived in the foreign countries, and Hitler \u2014 the system really sort of depended on\nthem that if and when they moved in that they would support the German cause. So the\nAuslandsdeutsche was a status. I said, 1 am Auslandsdeutsche from Holland. I said,\nMarch 16, 2001\nI\u2019ve lived in Holland most of my life. My parents were German, but I lived in Holland\nand in Holland we don\u2019t know from Aryan or non-Aryan. I don\u2019t know what that means.\nYeah, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re German. I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t sell you now. Now this 1s called\nchutzpah. I| said well, 1f you don\u2019t want to sell me now, at least will you save me 13\nbottles so that when I come back at four ocl \u2014 he said, you have to come back after four\no\u2019clock \u2014 when I come back after four o\u2019clock that I \u2014 that I can still get these? I really\ndon\u2019t know why you don\u2019t want to sell me those now. Come back at four o\u2019clock. And I\ndid. And she was not waiting with the police. She was decent. She sold me 13 bottles.\nNow, be \u2014 all my co-travelers were very happy because now we were prepared for our\ntrip through France and Spain and Portugal. We at least could have hocked something.\nWhen I came to America and I told my mother that story, she almost died. How can you\nbe so stupid? Well, that\u2019s \u2014 I took the chance and I had to try and get out of it as best I\ncould, and you have to \u2014 you lived, or you survived or you didn\u2019t survive by your wits.\nAnd that\u2019s \u2014 that was the point of growing up under these conditions. Anyway, we had\nour Thermos bottles, we were ready to go and we were preparing, and on May 11\",\nRudolf Hess decided to fly to England. Rudolf Hess of course was Stellvertreter des\nFuhrers, and we thought this is the end, we\u2019re no \u2014 never going to get out. Well luckily,\nthe Germans played it down, they didn\u2019t make a big deal of it, it was in the paper one day\nand he was out of his mind, it was \u2014 well, whatever. He tried to \u2014 however they explained\nit and the newspapers will tell you how. And it did not change the foreign policy toward\nMarch 16, 2001\nAmerica, which was still neutral. And on May 19\", we left Berlin. We were sealed into a\nrailroad car, third class. This was a regular, you know, railroad car.",
        "A: Yes. The doors were sealed, do not open the windows. Of course, we weren\u2019t going to\nget out, but they were afraid that maybe somebody would add \u2014 would \u2014 would climb in.\nAnd we were shunted, we were attached to a train that went to Paris. Of course in Paris\nyou arrive at Gare du Nord, and for the Spanish border you leave from Gare Austerlitz.\nHow do you get from one to the other? Well, we were shunted by whatever, like freight.\nIt took us about seven hours to get from one railroad station to the other, and then we\nwere eventually attached to the train that went to the f \u2014 Spanish border.",
        "A: No. No, we were \u2014 we were \u2014 we were 13 adults ranging from age 18 to age 12.",
        "A: Yeah, the older \u2014 yeah, the two \u2014 the two \u2014 you know, Judith and Jerry who were by\nthis time, I guess 18, whatever. And no, there was \u2014 there was nobody. We knew what to\ndo.",
        "A: Yes, they were \u2014 well, the younger one \u2014 she had an older brother too, he was sixt \u2014\n17 also, and you know, there were \u2014 there were no problems. There were no problems\nthat respect. And we arrived at the Spanish border, the name, ba-ba-ba-ba \u2014 Ondai(ph).\nMarch 16, 2001\nIn Ondai(ph). And in those days \u2014 when you do it now, you \u2014 you know, the \u2014 the\ndifferent \u2014 Spain has different rail gauge than the rest of Europe. In those days that was\nsolved by getting out on the French side, you walked across a bridge and then you were\nin Spain and you boarded the Spanish train and that\u2019s what we did.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nMarch 16, 2001\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: Well, now we were in Spain and while we knew, of course, that Spain, Franco\u2019s\nSpain was very sympathetic to the Germans, at least we had the feeling that we were not\nunder direct German control any more. The people who had organized our trip had\narranged for us to be overnight in San Sebastian and we stayed at the finest five star\nhotel, the Marie Louise, I think it is called, where we spent a glorious night and then\nwent on by train, and as we were riding through the Spanish countryside, we really saw\nan appalling sight. Spain had just come out of the civil war which lasted what, four years,\nfive years? And the people were devastated. We had hoarded bread for our trip because\nwe had to take along food for five days. We were locked into a \u2014 into a car and we knew\nthere was no food in \u2014 in Spain, so this was our third day. And suddenly we had really\npoor people coming along the railroad car and as we were standing at this station, or if we\nwere on a siding somewhere, begging, begging for bread and offering us oranges. I\nhadn\u2019t seen an orange since I left Holland. In Holland we had oranges, but Germany\nhad no oranges. So we traded bread for oranges. And then while the train then made its\nway slowly to the Spanish border, to the \u2014 to the Spanish-Portuguese border, and there\nwe had to change again into a Portuguese train, which was \u2014\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: Yeah, I just wanted to ask about how cohesive the group was, these are young\nteenagers. Were \u2014 were you a unified group, did you feel intensely close to each other?\nThe feeling among the group of children that you were with.",
        "A: Yes, we were. There were \u2014 there were some kids that felt closer, a couple of the \u2014\nwell, girls especially, sort of kept to themselves. I guess some of the guys were, I don\u2019t\nknow, they weren\u2019t coming on to them by today\u2019s standards, but there \u2014 you know, they\ndidn\u2019t want any involvement. Of course, the leaders wouldn\u2019t tolerate any an \u2014 romantic,\nlet\u2019s say, involvement, there was none of that. But m \u2014 m \u2014 well, to each his own, and \u2014",
        "A: I really don\u2019t remember. Our conversations were very guarded. When a \u2014 whatever \u2014\nwhatever, even in Spain, you never knew who was listening.",
        "A: In the sealed car I don\u2019t know what we did, whether we played games, I don\u2019t really\nrecall, but we \u2014 maybe we played checkers or something like that, but the \u2014 there wasn\u2019t\na lot of reading, there wasn\u2019t a\u2014 a \u2014I really \u2014 you looked outside, you looked out the\nwindow and you ate whatever you had at various intervals. Now, while I was in \u2014 in\nBerlin still, Uncle Wilhelm had sent me a \u2014 packages, food packages. When he found\nout that I was going to be there more than a week he \u2014 in Holland you could still get\nthings, in Germany you couldn\u2019t, so I got a couple of food packages with chocolate,\nwhich of course I shared with my fellow \u2014 you know, travelers. And a couple of little\nMarch 16, 2001\nGouda cheeses. And I really saved a bar of chocolate and a cheese as a iron ration, I\ncalled it, you know, when things really get tough that \u2014 that I had something. We didn\u2019t\nknow where our next meal was coming from, so I always had that in reserve. And\u2014a\nmatter of fact, I brought a cheese to America. And \u2014 but I don\u2019t remember in particular\nhow we kept busy. But, you know, just looking outside, I don\u2019t know whether I did any \u2014\nI did \u2014 I did a lot of drawing then but I didn\u2019t \u2014 oh, by the way, I had \u2014 I had brought you\na couple of pictures, talking about drawing, I almost forgot, they are put into the record,\nyou can have th \u2014 I \u2014 this is what I \u2014 we are going back to May of 1940 in Rotterdam\nand there was the view of Rotterdam from the roof of my house, and this too.",
        "A: Yes. Here we have a view, this is a pen and ink drawing, since I \u2014 we had no cameras.\nA pen and ink drawing of our view from Mauritsweg toward the city hall, and we see in\nthe background the oude kerk, the old church steeple. The old church was heavily\ndamaged during the fire and so was the city hall. And next to the city hall is \u2014 1s the\ntower, very modern with the carillon on it, which the Dutch are known for. And that was\nthe new stock exchange. That remained untouched, but everything around it was burned,\nburned out and devastated. The other picture is the street \u2014 sa \u2014 there was the \u2014 the trees\nin the background, was the zoo. And th \u2014 this street here there is a trolley with the tender\ngoing through there. The streets, once they were cleared the trolleys would run again, but\nthey were going through rubble and devastation. Everything up to the house on which I\nMarch 16, 2001\nwas \u2014 where I was on the roof, everything was burned out, bombed out and devastated.\nSo this is a pencil drawing which I now didn\u2019t complete, but I did sign it.",
        "A: Im-\u2014I made these drawings at the time, yes. This 1s \u2014",
        "A: Because I wanted \u2014 I wanted to record what \u2014 what I \u2014 you know, what \u2014 what we had\nseen. I was always very conscious of, you know, historic events, this was certainly\nhistoric event. I had no camera and so \u2014 and I was into \u2014 into drawing, so I \u2014 I drew it and\nwell, this pen and ink, I haven\u2019t done very many pen and ink, but that\u2019s all I had available\nthen, and I think it\u2019s a very respectable little drawing. So Ill leave these with the records.",
        "A: Okay, back in Spain. Well, actually we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re crossing over into po \u2014 into\nPortugal, the Portuguese trains were new, aluminum, and very American looking. They\nwere, in fact, modern American railroad equipment and we really saw it as the preview of\ncoming attractions. We arrived in Lisbon and we were put up by the Jewish community\nthere m \u2014 or the organization that was sponsoring our trip, assumably the HIAS. We were\nput up in a pensionne and we had a very interesting experience. About the day after we\narrived, a man came to our pensionne and said, I am from the free Dutch government in\nLondon. And he showed us a\u2014 an I.D. And you have come from Berlin? Yes. And you\nwere in Holland before? Yes. And of course we were very eager to tell our story and also\nMarch 16, 2001\ngive the allies \u2014 don\u2019t forget there was, you know, the Dutch \u2014 the queen had escaped to \u2014\nand the \u2014 you know, the royal house was in London. There was a Dutch force \u2014 air force,\nand you know, whatever, armed forces and we were very eager to help the allies. So he\nsays well, I would like to interview you. I will come back tomorrow and I'd like you to \u2014\nyou know, to tell me whatever you can. And we were most eager to tell him. So we met\nthe following day, it was about six o\u2019clock at night. I and two other boys, Jerry\nCohen(ph), who was fluent in Dutch and one other boy. And first we went to a\nrestaurant, caf \u2014 caf\u00e9 on the main square in Lisbon and he ordered coffee for us, and oh,\nwe were glad to have real coffee after that bilge water we \u2014 we got in Germany. And\nthen he said, don\u2019t turn around but I don\u2019t think we can talk here because there is an \u2014 an\nforeign agent sitting at another table, watching us. We better leave here. And of course\nwe were not aware of \u2014 you know, we hadn\u2019t seen any of the movies that \u2014 that showed\nthat friend and foe met in Lisbon. And he says, I think we better go to my apartment,\nwhere we can talk freely. And we went, and he took us up some back alleys in the back\nwhere the \u2014 if you\u2019ve ever been in \u2014 in Lisbon, you have a \u2014 seven hills just like in\nRome, and cobblestone narrow streets and he led us to his apartment. All I can say is\nthank heaven he was legitimate. What we found out later, he could have been a German\nagent who posed as a free Dutch agent. Well, we spilled our guts. We told him what the\nGermans had done in Holland. We told him where the fortifications were in Berlin in the\n\u20141in the zoo area, Tiergarten and th-th-they had built high rise bunkers they call them,\nMarch 16, 2001\nsolid concrete. And where the anti-aircraft guns were agains \u2014 you know, when the\nBritish came o \u2014 flying over, we spilled our guts and felt very good about it, that we\ncould finally do something. What we didn\u2019t realize was that there were just as many\nGerman agents there as there were English and Dutch and whatever else. So he could\nhave \u2014 very easily it could have been the last of us, that we would have disappeared,\nnever to be seen again. Luckily, that didn\u2019t happen. Well, so now it was \u2014",
        "A: It was a\u2014",
        "A: Well, tha-tha \u2014 that\u2019s militar \u2014 this was apparent to anybody who lived in Berlin. You\nknow, the Tiergarten, which is the \u2014 the zoo or the park area, they had built bunkers\nthere because they were \u2014 because it was \u2014 they were protected by the trees and were, you\nknow, camouflaged, natural camouflage. And well, we just told them what we knew\nabout what they were doing in \u2014 in Holland, that they had tried to, you know, build a\nfleet which \u2014 etcetera, etcetera. And \u2014 and well, there was that and then as time got near I\nwent, of course, speaking for my ow \u2014 my own interests, I went to the American export\nlines and told them that I was here. I had my cable showing that my mother had paid. I\nhad missed the March 15\", I had not taken advantage of the payment. You have a\npayment, and I\u2019m here now and I\u2019ve got to leave. I knew that the next ship was leaving\non March 30\". The Excambion, one of their lines. And yes, I said, well I have to be on\nMarch 16, 2001\nthat ship, and \u2014 okay, don\u2019t worry, I se \u2014 so starting on the 27\", I went to the office eight\no\u2019clock in the morning and I said I would like to see the passenger list. Don\u2019t worry,\nyou'll be on the \u2014 I said, I want to see the passenger list. Well, we don\u2019t have it yet. So I\nsat there all day and waited and \u2014 and I had no other place to go. And on the 29\", it was\ngetting a little closer, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be on the ship, and you know \u2014 anyway, they \u2014\nthey gave me a song and a dance, and let me see the \u2014 I said, you can see it but you can\u2019t\nhave it. It was my only receipt. And this went until the 30\", and then on the 30\", said,\nwell, the ship isn\u2019t sailing until tomorrow, which was May 31\u201c. I say, you\u2019re sure it\u2019s sai\n\u2014 yes, 1\u2014 tomorrow. Well anyway, they gave me their \u2014 you know, delayed me again.\nThey never came across with the passenger list. And I talked to the guy from the Jewish\ncommittee and he said, you\u2019ll be on the list, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be \u2014 you\u2019Il make it. Then,\non the \u2014 he said, yet \u2014 look, tomorrow morning you go to the pier \u2014 and I had to borrow\nmoney because we were only allowed 10 mark out of Germany, which was soon gone. I\nborrowed money from one of my fellow travelers and that \u2014 luckily the fares in Portugal\nwere very cheap, so I got to the pier and I was standing there waiting. I got there about\ntwo o\u2019clock in the afternoon with all the other refugees and we were \u2014 I was standing in\nthe sun. Here it was the end of May and I was wearing my winter clothes that I had left\nHolland with in March. Not good. And well, this guy finally \u2014 our guy showed up about\nfour, 4:30, climbs up on a crate and starts calling out names of refugees. The Americans\nwere going up the gangplank, you know, like Americans do, and the refugees were\nMarch 16, 2001\nstanding in the sun. And this guy starts reading names and reading names and well, the\nthird class \u2014",
        "A: Well [indecipherable] no tourists.",
        "A: American visitors or people who were returning home from \u2014 from America, you\nknow? And the refugees were standing, waiting for this guy to call their names. So finally\nlike the third last name, Roberg, Kurt. Well, by this time it was six o\u2019clock. I flew up\nthat gangplank and I was on my way, so I thought. So, wait til about 10 o\u2019clock, this boat\nwas \u2014 it was supposed to leave at six. The boat was still in port, so I went to bed, and \u2014\nmy bunk and next morning I got up at seven o\u2019clock, I went to see the sun rise over the\nocean, I got up, we\u2019re still in Portugal. They\u2019re still loading cork. The Excambion was a\ncombination freight and passengers. There were 180 passengers and n \u2014 thank heaven,\none class. Da \u2014 did not have first and second or third class. So there were no\nubermenschen and untermenschen, which was nice. But hey, I\u2019m on board, it\u2019s an\nAmerican ship, I\u2019m on American territory, right, American grounds, under the American\nflag. I wasn\u2019t worried. So we finally left about nine o\u2019clock. They weighed anchor and\noff we went, stopped in Bermuda for six hours and well, 10 days later we arrived in the\ngood old U.S.A., so I guess the customs people got on board out in the bay, Customs and\n\u2014 customs and immigration. So the last two hours as the ship steams 1n, they are\nMarch 16, 2001\nprocessing everybody. So li \u2014 look at my passport, ah, sit over here. A couple of other\npeople sat over there, most people could go again. And then finally he calls me back.\nKurt Roberg? Yeah. Why are you trying to enter this country with an expired visa? I\nsaid, my visa was good when I came aboard ship. My visa expired at midnight. I was\naboard ship at six p.m. According to the ship\u2019s log, this vessel sailed on June first. Your\nvisa expired May 31. You can\u2019t come in. What do you mean I can\u2019t come in? I didn\u2019t\nsay that, but I\u2014 we were taught to be humble, even in America. So, well, we docked in\nHoboken, as was customary in those days. American export line docked in Hoboken, not\nin New York. And of course my mother knew \u2014 oh, I had \u2014 I had borrowed three dollars\nfrom a German speaking steward on board, to send a telegram from aboard ship to my\nmother that I was coming. She hadn\u2019t heard from me since I was in Berlin. I didn\u2019t write\nbecause every week we were supposed to leave and I was going to be there before the\nletters, right? So I didn\u2019t write. I wrote to my uncle, and he wrote to my mother and that\u2019s\nhow she got word about what was happening with me, but I didn\u2019t write, and well, she\nwent crazy \u2014 I mean, she understood, but why didn\u2019t you write? Anyway, so she was\ndown on the pier and I was up on board. All the passengers were leaving the ship except\nme and one other woman, we stayed on board. Do you think they would have let my\nmother up, or me down? No, not in America. We waved, she cried. I guess I was teary-\neyed. And I remember I s \u2014 I called to my mother, Mother, are you wearing lipstick? She\nsays, yes, in America we \u2014 in America we wear lipstick. Because in Europe women \u2014\nMarch 16, 2001\nhussies wore lipstick. My mother wearing lipstick, can you believe that? I said, before\nyou know it you probably will \u2014 will paint your nails red, too. So those were the little \u2014\nand that \u2014 that sort of stuck in my mind. Now anyway, my mother was told that I could\nnot come down. We hollered up and down, you know, across the \u2014 and they told me that\nI'd have to go to Ellis Island for a hearing, just a formality. And my mother, of course,\nwent the next day just for this formality and there was a hearing before a judge, and he\nlooked at my papers and decided that well, they couldn\u2019t let me in. Now they \u2014 the visa\nwas definitely expired. As a matter of fact, there was something wrong with the visa. The\nvisa was issued on January 31\u00b0, it should have only gone to May 30\". They gave you an\nextra day, why? Oh, this will have to go to Washington, the State Department will have\nto handle that. And so it happened that Kurt Roberg stayed on Ellis Island for four\nweeks while they debated in Washington whether they could take a risk, the risk of\nletting me in, or whether they would send me back. And I guess lawyers came cheap in\nthose days. American export lines had their lawyers working on it, because they would\nhave had to pay another 210 dollars to take me back to Lisbon and obviously lawyers\nwere paid a lot less than that in those days. So after four weeks they finally re \u2014 relented\nand \u2014 and they said, you can stay.",
        "A: Physical only in that she would come \u2014 my mother worked, and \u2014 but on weekends\nshe could come to Ellis Island, or anybody else during visitors\u2019 hours and in the great\nMarch 16, 2001\nhall that you may have gone to, I know it very well, when it wasn\u2019t as tidy as it looks now\nand I became an expert Ping-Pong player there. Did crafts and a lot of drawing and\nreading papers and spending time, and I\u2019m an expert on Ellis Island.",
        "A: Well, it was wonderful. It was \u2014 it was great. It was wonderful.",
        "A: I think he came \u2014 yeah, one \u2014 he was not well, also relations between my parents had\ngotten, you know, worse. And my mother worked in New Rochelle, he lived on the room\nin Washington Heights. My brother had a job in Bridgeport, Connecticut. We were all\nover the map.",
        "A: Definitely. And I was very close to being sent back. Oh they \u2014 State Department gave\nno quarter, they went by the book. They absolutely went by the book, they couldn\u2019t care\nless about \u2014 there was no human consideration, the fact that if I would be sent back that\nI'd end up in the \u2014 you know, would be sent back all the way to Germany and end up in\nthe \u2014 wherever, right? In a pile of ashes. Oh, there was no \u2014 was no consideration\nwhatsoever of that, as far as I know. Now, my question to you, ca\u20141\u2014 how would I\nresearch something like that? Is there a file on me in the State Department that is in\nexistence to this day? And can I reach that under the whatever act?\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: Freedom of Information Act.",
        "A: Well, by taking things one day at a time and as long as I was here I felt I had a chance\nof staying here. I was \u2014 you know, I was hoping and I mean they were telling me that \u2014\nyou know, they have various Jewish organizations were working on it and they were\ndoing what they could. But if they wouldn\u2019t have, if it would have been up to State, they\nwould have sent me back. I have no doubt about that today, knowing what we know\ntoday. At the time, of course, we didn\u2019t know what the inner workings of \u2014 of mentality\nwas at the State Department.",
        "A: Oh, it was a \u2014 it was a joyous occasion, I mean, well I \u2014 I thought it was sort of\nsymbolic that I only saw the back of the Statue of Liberty. You know, she turned her\nback on me, but I see humor in almost anything. But wha-what was also interesting was\nthat we were in the same complex with the Germans, the Bund Germans and Italians who\nwere considered enemy aliens. Well, wha \u2014 wa \u2014 wa \u2014 at least these were \u2014 the Bund\nGermans \u2014 America was still at peace with Germany, but they were \u2014 they were\nactivists who were interned on Ellis Island. They walked \u2014 we walked from 11 to 12 and\nMarch 16, 2001\nthey walked from 10 to 11. And we were separated by a \u2014 a fence, you know, by\nwhatever, a metal fence. But they were, and we were \u2014 we were treated like \u2014 well,\ncounted like prisoners when we walked from the \u2014 from the sleeping facilities to the\ndining hall, there was a guard clicking, counting. They \u2014 we had bunk beds, men only,\nyou know, in a huge \u2014 they were prison conditions, but I mean, it was \u2014 it was better than\nin Berlin, you know, and the food was better, and I mean, we knew that \u2014 you know,\nthere were no abuses or whatever. But we were \u2014 we lived a regimented life, you know.\nOne hour a day \u2014\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "A: It was a detention center and you know, it was \u2014 as I say, the food was good, we were\nkept occupied. The various Jewish organizations came in to, you know, give us material\nfor crafts, leatherwork, which I did. Drawing, you know, things you wanted to do. So, it\nwas nice, but we had to stay in the great hall, that was our living room. That\u2019s where\neverybody hung out, not by choice. And at the gong of the bell you\u2019d go into the dining\nroom and at the gong of the bell you\u2019d go into the sleeping quarters. And I \u2014 you know, it\nwas a regimented life, but well, look what we came from and what we \u2014 what we found\nhere. It was heaven, you know. And so it was \u2014 it was all right. Wasn\u2019t very \u2014 July \u2014\nMarch 16, 2001\nJune, July \u201941 was a very hot summer so we were \u2014 were \u2014 there was no air conditioner,\nof course, but at least out on the water, surrounded by water was cooler than anywhere\nelse. My mother would come on Sundays to visit and oh, the subway is so hot and I had\nno idea what that meant. The subway is no [indecipherable] you know, they had fans.\nHad to take the IRT all the way down from \u2014 well, she would come from 168\" Street.",
        "A: Well, the last \u2014 I guess they had an \u2014 we had another hearing. My \u2014 when I could pack\nup, that was great. Now, was \u2014 was a \u2014 I guess it was a week, that was a Tuesday, so my\n\u2014 my uncle, m \u2014 one of my mother\u2019s other sisters who had spent the \u2014 well, a year and a\nhalf in London during the blitz, they came over here in 1940 and had an apartment in\nWashington Heights and I stayed \u2014 I stayed with them, because we didn\u2019t \u2014 my mother\nwasn\u2019t \u2014 had a job in New Rochelle as a sleep in ma \u2014 the housekeeper. And he picked\nme up. He picked me up and I came into \u2014 I \u2014 into the subway, down \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes, I think I \u2014 well, we \u2014 we \u2014 we got off the ferry boat at the \u2014 at \u2014 at the\nbattery and it was a \u2014 it was a \u2014 well, it was a great new world, I really don\u2019t think that I\nspent so much on, y-you know, trying to analyze my feelings other than being\noverwhelmed by, you know, the physicality of New York, and of course New York, the\nMarch 16, 2001\ndowntown then was the center of business and here was the \u2014 you know, the courthouse\nand \u2014 well, 17 Battery Place was a very tall building then, and I don\u2019t know how much\nyou know, but I\u2019m very familiar with that, I spent a lot of time later in that part of New\nYork. So it was, you know, Bowling \u2014 Bowling Green. We walked bif \u2014 Bowling\nGreen to the subway and we took the IRT and of course, well \u2014",
        "A: I had \u2014 I had learned some English in Holland. My English \u2014 I could speak some\nEnglish. My problem was in understanding it because I would, at that point, translate it\ninto Dutch. So by the time I had translated it, the other person speaking to me was three\nsentences further. You know, I mean, this is the \u2014 you know a language when you start\nthinking in it. And so that was really m \u2014 that \u2014 that took couple of months. But I \u2014 I\nremember the first impression of New York is that th \u2014 I \u2014 I s \u2014 seeing black people\nreally dressed up gaudily, you know. Big lips with lipstick and you know, make-up, and\nyou know the \u2014 I mean, people in Europe didn\u2019t do that. My God, 1s this really ex \u2014 an\nexotic country. And d \u2014 you know, all the \u2014 the noise and then well, then we got into the\nsubway, and of course I had seen movies, American movies in Holland, you know, we \u2014\nwe saw American movies, lot of cowboy movies and \u2014 you know, of New York, you\nknew what the skyline was like and \u2014 and Broadway, 42\" Street was Broadway, right?\nSo we came \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 my uncle and aunt lived on 171\u201c Street, so we took the train to\n168\" Street, Medical Center, right? Took the elevator up, I was impressed, my God, I \u2014\nMarch 16, 2001\nwe had fun, I took the elevator up. And come out and here all these low buildings, except\nfor Medical Center, I see \u2014 the first sign I see is Broadway. This is Broadway? Where\nare all the tall buildings? You know, the only \u2014 the first thing I saw, there was in\nWashington Heights, and I don\u2019t know how well you remember that, was a Johnny\nWalker \u2014 a huge advertising sign with Johnny Walker walking, it was a \u2014 it was an\nanimated sign. I said, oh, they have this \u2014 this great sign, but where the tall buildings? If\nthis is Broadway, I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I thought all of Broadway was that way. So that was my\nreally first impression of Broadway, and its disappointment. But I caught up.",
        "A: Well, then I \u2014 I settled in with my uncle and aunt. I had to get a job, so first I had to\nget a Social Security card. In America you need a Social Security card. To get a Social\nSecurity card and work full time you have to be 18, otherwise you have to go to school. I\nwas done with school. I couldn\u2019t afford to go to school any more.",
        "A: Financially, right. So I went to \u2014 and on advice of my cousin, my relatives they had \u2014\nthey were already in America for three years, my cousin. They came here in 1937 from\nPalestine. You \u2014 you have to tell them you\u2019re 18. So suddenly I was a year older, I was\n18 and I got a Social Security card, and \u2014\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: In America? What papers? No. They took my word for it. I li \u2014 I learned to lie in\nAmerica. In Germany you didn\u2019t dare lie, everything was on record. And I got a job, my\ncousin who was a salesman, got me a job within a week. I had to work. I worked \u2014 got\nme a job in a place called Jersey City. Jersey City, New Jersey, a job for 12 dollars a\nweek. I didn\u2019t know that they were paying \u2014 yeah, the minimum wage law had just been\npassed, which was 35 cents an hour, 40 hours, 14 dollars. They were paying me 12. You\nknow, I was a greenhorn just off the boat and in order to get the job as an upholsterer, I\nhad to buy a hammer, a magnetic hammer, which you put into your m \u2014 you \u2014 you\u2019ve\nnever \u2014 obviously you have never done any upholstery work. You have a box of blue\ntacks. You dip your magnetic hammer into it, it picks up nails. You swallow \u2014 you put\nthem into your mouth, you don\u2019t swallow them, and then you feed the hammer one at a\ntime with the tack. I learned that pretty quick but in order to do that you need your own\npersonal hammer. You don\u2019t want to li \u2014 lick anybody else\u2019s hammer, right? So before I\nhad the job I already had to invest a dollar and a quarter in a hammer, okay? But that\u2019s\nAmerica. So, I had this job for a week, I got paid 12 dollars. In the meantime my cousin\nhad lined up a better job for me cause I \u2014 well, I had | \u2014 trained as a \u2014 as an auto\nmechanic but they said can\u2019t get a job in New York as an auto mechanic, pump gas.\nThey don\u2019t pay minimum wage for that. So he got me a job in the machine shop for 14\ndollars and I worked in the machine shop for 14 dollars. And I we \u2014 stayed there til I\nMarch 16, 2001\nwent into the army. I became foreman, I ran the place. I was very good and he got a very\ngood deal, even for whatever he paid me at the time, I mean \u2014",
        "A: No, I\u2014 well, I f\u2014 I was accepted, but everybody knew that I was Dutch. There was a\nGerman worker there. I had n \u2014I wanted no identity with Germany whatsoever. First \u2014 I\nmean, first of all because I wanted to shed all of that and Holland was a lot closer to me\nemotionally than Germany. And people here in amer \u2014 in New York, in America didn\u2019t\nunderstand the difference between a German Jew and a German. You are German, you a\nGerman. Are you a Jew, or are you a German? They didn\u2019t understand. There was one\nfellow there, he worked in the shop who was German, he came here during the 1920\u2019s, a\nGerman, you know, Gentile. And he spoke German with me and I spoke German with\nhim. But I s-sort of \u2014 fractured German I spoke with him. And he would say, you know,\nyour German is awfully good for being a Dutchman. I said, well look, my parents were\nGerman, we spoke German at home, that\u2019s how I \u2014 and I didn\u2019t lie, we did speak German\nat home and my parents were German born, right? So I didn\u2019t lie. Said, but I am Dutch,\nbecause inside, I was Dutch. And \u2014",
        "A: On December 7\", 1941, im \u2014 we had gotten our lift to America. We had sent our lift\nvan that I told you 1t was m-made in \u2014 in Bremen and we had it sent, my mother had it\nMarch 16, 2001\nsent to Rotterdam and then from Rotterdam to America before they left, so our\nfurniture, everything was in America, and then when they got here, my parents, we\nstored the furniture in the basement of my aunt\u2019s apartment house in Washington\nHeights, made a deal with the superintendent and for like what, 10 dollars a month or\nsomething like that, in one of the storerooms, our furniture. So every Sunday, when my\nmother came from New Rochelle, we spent in the basement seeing to it that \u2014 spraying\nroach stuff and whatever, that we wouldn\u2019t get any roaches into the furniture, into the\nmattre \u2014 into whatever. And then they \u2014 you know, there were all sorts of bugs, we were\ntold, in America, you know, like \u2014 um \u2014 s-so anyway, housekeeping. On December\nseventh, which was a Sunday, we were in the basement. At this point I had already\nbought a radio, of course, to ma \u2014 so that I would learn English. And went to a lot of\nmovies on Saturday morning for 17 cents, to learn English. That\u2019s how you learned\nEnglish. And then as \u2014 Sunday we were in the basement, when about 2:30 we heard about\nthe sneak attack on Pearl Harbor and then we heard Roosevelt, so I know exactly where\nI was. And we were \u2014 well, we were glad.",
        "A: We were glad that now America was forced to enter the war, on the English side,\nbecause Roosevelt was, of course, fighting that battle for a long time. And to us it was a\nstep in the right direction. And well \u2014 my brother tried to volunteer for the service. They\nsaid, you can\u2019t volunteer, you\u2019re not a citizen. But you can be drafted. And well, I\u2014 so he\nMarch 16, 2001\nwent into the service in \u201943 and I went into the service. And he went in May and I went in\nJuly of 43. And well, I had gotten several deferments because I worked in a war central\nplant in the machine shop, we were making parts for aircraft engines and stuff. But after\nthree deferments, I \u2014 they said you have to go. And well, my \u2014 I was \u2014 I was eager to go.\nI wanted to fight Hitler. And now I think I was one of the more motivated people\ncertainly in the ou \u2014 in my outfit. You know, everybody went because they were drafted.\nI went because I knew what I was fighting for, so it\u2019s \u2014 I didn\u2019t mind. But then, of course,\nthe outfit that I trained with went to Europe eventually, but our commanding officer said\nno German born personnel can go. So they pulled all the German refugee boys out and\nthey shipped us to the Pacific.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, you knew where \u2014 you know, where you from, you know, what\u2019s your\nhometown, yes.",
        "A: Yes. And especially in the army there were a lot of prejudices, you know, so I found\nout. Against Jews. And the sergeant major in the outfit I was in, who was an anti-Semite\nsaw to it that my papers \u2014 I was \u2014 when you are in the service you should \u2014 you know,\nMarch 16, 2001\nyou \u2014 you would become a \u2014 a citizen. I mean, normally it took five years to become a\ncitizen. In the service within 90 days you could become a citizen. The papers had to be\nput through, I mean, you n \u2014 on the theory you\u2019re good enough to fight for the country,\nyou're pledging allegiance, etcetera. And they couldn\u2019t send you overseas unless you\nwere a citizen. Anyway, he held back the papers and screwed it up so when the outfit was\nalerted to go overseas, my papers weren\u2019t ready. And the \u2014 whatever excuses he gave, but\nI mean \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but none of them \u2014 he was the one in my \u2014 in my battalion. They w \u2014\nyou know, the others were not in my battalion, they were in other outfits, but we were in\nthe same [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, I think I learned as I came to Holland that there was \u2014 even in Holland \u2014 but\nthat everywhere in the world there 1s anti-Semitism, you know? When you had a church,\na Catholic church which preached until 20 years ago that the Jews killed Christ and this\nwas conveyed directly to the Irish, Italian and other predominantly Catholic societies,\nthere were \u2014 there was, you know, anti-Semitism was preached, you know, and look, we\ncertainly knew that in \u2014 in Germany, before Hitler there was anti-Semitism and that\nthere was anti-Semitism \u2014 I mean, in Holland I joined a Zionist organization because \u2014 I\nMarch 16, 2001\nmean in \u2014 in Celle we couldn\u2019t do much about it, but in principle we were \u2014 you know,\nlet\u2019s say zine \u2014 Zionist oriented. When I came to Holland, of course Harry was there\nalready and he belonged to a Zionist group, youth group and we would go to meetings.\nWe'd go on bike outings and we had meetings and speakers and all that. And these were\nyoung people, and you know, we \u2014 we learned, which was the Zionist dogma of the day\nthat you know, there\u2019s anti-Semitism everywhere and Jews cannot truly assimilate\nbecause it takes someone who wants to assimilate, which is the Jew, and someone who\nlets you assimilate, which is the non-Jewish society and they are not about to. So, you\nknow, I knew that, and thi \u2014 it was true in America, and you know, we \u2014 we heard and\nlearned that well, you can \u2014 that in certain businesses and banks you can\u2019t \u2014 you know,\nyou can\u2019t go into the banking business, you can\u2019t go into the \u2014 at the time, that that was \u2014\nthose were businesses or professions where Jews were not welcome.",
        "A: No, not really. Well, we had \u2014 as I say, my cousin tried \u2014 no, they went to Palestine\nbecause it was, you know, it was a way out of Germany, but we knew that Palestine was\nhard work and very physical and we were no \u2014 we were in a \u2014 we were in America and\nwe really didn\u2019t consider Palestine as a\u2014 as a\u2014 as a very pliable option. We were here.\nAnd you know, being \u2014 as a family, we could have never functioned there, and we were\nnot going to strike out on our own, let\u2019s say, my brother and I, go to Palestine, leave my\nMarch 16, 2001\nmother and my father here. My father died in October \u201942, and may \u2014 he really never\nrecovered from the aftereffects of the concentration camp, really. So, you know, weren\u2019t\ngoing to leave my mother by herself, you know, I mean it\u2019s just never \u2014 never entered our\nmind. The same when I came back from the service, you know, I could have done other\nthings, but I\u2014 you know, we \u2014 we \u2014 we were family oriented and you know, there was an\nobligation, a family loyalty and would have never considered, you know, picking up and\ngoing elsewhere.",
        "A: Well, first I went from New York, Camp Upton, to Camp Adair Oregon, I trained\nthere. From Oregon we went as a \u2014 as a unit the whole division moved to Fort Leonard\nWood, Missouri. And from Fort Leonard Wood, really, the \u2014 by this time it was 1944,\nthe division was alerted and went to Europe and they pulled us out and sent us to the\nPacific. So I went \u2014 I went to the Pacific on New Year\u2019s Day, 1945. Ended up in New\nCaledonia, entered a stray artillery battalion. If you read, \u201cTales of the South Pacific,\u201d\nthat was us. A stray battalion up in the hills of New Caledonia, away from everything\nuntil we got a new commanding officer. The worst possible combination you could have.\nThe rank that the com \u2014 command called for was lieutenant colonel. He was a major, so\nhe \u2014 he was a Jewish West Pointer, so he had to prove all sorts of things, and was he\neager to get that, you know, those colonel \u2014 that \u2014 that \u2014 colonel\u2019s \u2014 you know, own \u2014 so\n\u2014 well, I\u2019m happy to say that it worked out fine. We \u2014 we missed the invasion of\nMarch 16, 2001\nOkinawa and we missed the invasion of the Philippines. We got to the Philippines\nfairly late in the game. And then the war ended on August eighth.",
        "A: Yeah, yes it was, because of \u2014 well, the way the army runs. See, since we were in the\n\u2014 for instance, in the Philippines there were a lot of Japanese in the \u2014 in the hills. They\nwere pretty desperate because they were starving, you know, Americans were \u2014 but the\nisland was officially declared secured. Therefore, under army regulations, we were not\nissued any live ammo. But we would go out on exercises, we call them. And I was in the\nartillery, so they would send us out as forward observers. You go up ahead of the\ninfantry, ahead of everybody. Now, since I\u2019m the person that doesn\u2019t like to take chances,\nI had seen to it that I had a few clips of ammunition that I had forgotten to turn in, just for\ninsurance. And now we were \u2014 we were out on a\u2014 on a mission at night and we had a\nyoung lieutenant with us, someone we referred to as a shaved hair, that was second\nlieutenant just out of boot camp and whatever. And well, we camped for the night, strictly\ntactical and then he \u2014 we heard things moving around out there. And we were \u2014 we didn\u2019t\nknow what it was or who it was, but you have to assume that it is the enemy, right? I had\npassed the word to my two other colleagues that I had ammo, so we felt relatively\ncomfortable. But the lieutenant didn\u2019t know, and he also had no ammo. So he said, do\nyou think \u2014 do you think those are Japs? Lieutenant, we don\u2019t know, but when we find\nout we could probably arm wrestle them. So, you know, we found out that they had only\n99March 16, 2001\nraided our supply depot, the Japanese, they \u2014 they were hungry, they didn\u2019t want to fight.\nMaybe on a full stomach they would have felt like fighting, but \u2014 so you know, it\u2019s these\nlittle incidents, but otherwise \u2014\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\n100March 16, 2001\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",

My mother saved all mine and my brother\u2019s letters.\nAnd I\u2019ve \u2014 you know, they hoped that they wouldn\u2019t have to come to the Pacific after\nthey finished the war in Germany and help fight there and well, they were actually, they\nwere \u2014 they were trained to go for the invasion of Japan and all. Well, it didn\u2019t come to\npass, thank heaven. I was in the Philippines until March \u00b046, and then came home, was\ndischarged on April ninth and re-entered civilian life. I went back to my original job,\nwhich of course he had to take me back. But I couldn\u2019t see being a mish \u2014 tool and die\nmaker. So I wanted to get into business, I wanted to go to school, I wanted to you know,\npick up my life and make up for lost time. And \u2014 and I did. I found myself a new job in\nthe import export business, which was booming then. And I went back to school to get\nmy \u2014 well, pass the Regents in all the things that you have to do in New York. That was\nvery interesting too, I had submitted my records. I had all my German and Dutch records\nand they said, well you have to submit them to Albany, to the department of Regents.\n101March 16, 2001\nAnd then they sent them back, they said, they\u2019re in German. Yeah, they\u2019re in German,\nwhat do you expect in Germany, they write the records in German. But you\u2019re the\ndepartment of education, you mean you cou \u2014 oh no, you have to translate those. Well,\nyou \u2019ve been in the educational field and you know what it\u2019s like. So that gave me a\npreview of coming attractions.

I could have taken the G.I. bill\nand gone anywhere. I could have gone to the Sorbonne, you know, but I didn\u2019t think that\nway.

Taught myself how to type and I got into a lot of interesting experience\nin banking, 1n letters of credit and dealing with shipping companies. I spent a lot of time\ndowntown in the Wall Street area. It was very educational. When I felt I couldn\u2019t learn\nanything any more, I quit and I got a job with a friend of mine who had asked me to join\nhis young, growing company. And this was the man who came out of the concentration\ncamp with my father, Hans Solomon(ph), who had made it to America via Shanghai\nwith his wife and young daughter. Waited for their visas, American visas in Shanghai,\ncame here in 1940. And he was too old to go \u2014 I guess he was about 38 at the time, too\nold to go into the service and he built a \u2014 started his own business in 1945 and then asked\nme to come join him and I did in 1948, I guess. \u201947. And I was with him for 10 years and\nI was credit manager and I majored in accounting at City College for awhile, before I\nwent into marketing and management. And I started \u2014 went into sales, into marketing,\nmerchandising. And after 10 years with him I went \u2014 joined another company to set up a\n103\nMarch 16, 2001\nphotographic division for them, and became vice president of photo products and I was\nwith them for 32 years.

But she became Jewish, converted and\nwe have a family, two children, a daughter who was born in 1959, my son in 1962. And\nwe had a good life. My wife, well, started contract \u2014 well, suffered from cancer, and she\ndied in 1989. And that\u2019s about the story. I retired in 1989, six months after she died. I had\nplanned on it anyway, but \u2014 unfortunately without her, but well, 1-1n the meantime of\ncourse, we lived in New Y \u2014 we lived in New York when we first got married. We\nmoved to Riverdale and then in \u2014 in Riverdale into a co-op and then when my daughter\nInez became of school age, we decided to leave New York and head for the wide open\nspaces of New Jersey.

And I was interested in automobiles too, so that \u2014 so I chose what \u2014 we were\nsort of trained or oriented toward a nonacademic life.",
        "A: No, I think it\u2019s been a m \u2014 it has been a good \u2014 I\u2014I can only see it as a good affect,\nwhether everybody agrees with me, I m\u2014 m \u2014 some people think that I\u2019m too \u2014 well, I\u2019m\na \u2014 I\u2019m a product of the 1930\u2019s environment. I think we have the same thing in America,\nyou know, people are products of the ba \u2014 depression era. We are oriented toward\npracticality, economy, frugality, etcetera, and of course my German background m \u2014 of\n105March 16, 2001\ncertainly m-me \u2014 German Jewish background, the emphasis in Germany is, I think\neverywhere in Jewish circles was education, you know? The saying was always,\nespecially if you move around, as the Jews have for hundreds of years, you \u2014 what you c\n\u2014 what you carry in your \u2014 you don\u2019t carry heavy in what\u2019s 1n your head, however that\ntranslates, you know. And so we were always oriented toward learning and well, I think\nthat is probably the basis of my [indecipherable] and planning ahead, I think. Planning,\nhaving a structured life rather than living out into the w-wild. But I think that\u2019s a matter\nof personality, I don\u2019t know whether that is any background. By the same token my wife,\nwho grew up in wartime Germany, and she was five years younger, so she had to leave\neastern Germany when the Russians came, as a small child. Her father by that time had\ndisappeared. Mother was left with two children, and the stories of, you know, the\nRussians coming, raping, killing, burning, whatever, they, you know, they took off. They\nleft with the last train. They were able to save themselves, they lost everything. And she,\nsince childhood really never wanted to own anything because she didn\u2019t want to go\nthrough what her mother had gone, having to leave everything behind. So Connie was\nreally very much oriented toward enjoying things. She said, I don\u2019t have to own\npaintings, P\u2019Il be very happy to see them in a museum. I don\u2019t want to own anything. I\ndon\u2019t want to \u2014 you know. So the different people are affected differently by the same set\nof circumstances. And so, if we put the finger on what causes certain developments, or\ndevelopmental trends, I think you can read a lot into conditions that you want to read into\n106March 16, 2001\nit. And you know, psychologists are so busy trying to come up with formulas of what\nhappens why. I\u2019m not a great believer in that.",

A \u2014 a song that we \u2014\nthat we hear for the first time under romantic conditi \u2014 it sticks.

        "A: Yes, I \u2014 well, I-I\u2019m certainly more aware of it, but I\u2019m also aware of the abuses and of\nthe limitations and it\u2019s interesting that I\u2019ve gone back to Germany many times and the\nchange I see in Germany today, the change toward democracy is really remarkable. I had\na very interesting experience. As a matter of fact I [indecipherable] I went back to my\nhometown, Celle on the anniversary of Crystal Night in \u201998, 50\" anniversary and\nparticipated in a \u2014 well, I really instigated a memorial service at the synagogue in Celle,\nand I went over there for that and I was the keynote speaker. And I'll be glad to send you\na copy of that speech. It was held in German, but I made a fairly accurate English\ntranslation for my congregation and for my friends. So Ill send you that, and you can put\nit into the records. But 1\u2014 I really \u2014 and I met with some of my former classmates for\nwhom I would vouch that they were not Nazis then or now. And it was a very interesting\nexperience and I think sort of telling. The \u2014 yeah, what went on under Hitler, how a lot\nof Germans who were, let\u2019s say scared into following the party line. Of course there was\na meal ticket too, that they didn\u2019t dare to go across the \u2014 against the party line because it\nmeant their livelihood. And I think there is really a lot of true democracy, especially in\nthe young people. We \u2014 we read about the skinheads, the anti-Semitism, etcetera. But just\nlike here, the good people don\u2019t make news, it\u2019s the bad people that make the news, and I\nthink in our society too, you hear about the killings of \u2014 you know, the teenagers that are\nshooting up our schools and all that, but you don\u2019t read about the good kids or the kids\nthat are scared. I met a little girl in Florida, she\u2019s 11 years old. There was a \u2014 well, talk\n113March 16, 2001\nabout a \u2014 an incident in school and she was scared and she asked her mother, I don\u2019t want\nto go to school today because there\u2019s gonna be trouble. You know, there are \u2014 so what\nI\u2019m saying 1s there\u2019s good and bad everywhere. We don\u2019t \u2014 we don\u2019t hear about the good\nkids, we only hear about the bad kids. And I think you as a \u2014 as an educator, know that\nthat is so. To condemn a whole generation or sector of the population because of a few, is\nunfair. Any time you generalize, it\u2019s unfair, or even inaccurate. What\u2019s his name,\nGoldhagen? Every German is guilty? I haven\u2019t read his book. I read the synopsis in the\n\u201cNew York Times\u201d book review and all that. I don\u2019t want to read his book. He can come\nwith statistics, but I don\u2019t think that every German down \u2014 deep down in his heart, felt\nanti-Semitic or was part \u2014 part-participated or wanted to participate. So he has a formula;\nthat formula too, is not accurate. I think you have to take people as individuals and that\u2019s\nwhat I try to do. They\u2019re good and they\u2019re not so good and they\u2019 re outright bad. And n \u2014\nthat has been \u2014 I mean, I made my peace with Germany in 19 \u2014 in the 1950\u2019s, when I\nwent back the first time on business with Hans Solomon(ph). We went back to\nGermany to try and do business in 1952. We went to the photo show in Cologne and we\nspent two weeks in Celle. Now he, being 15 years older than I, was there as an adult. He\nremem \u2014 knew a lot more people, and we looked up a lot of them and talked to them. Of\ncourse, in the 50\u2019s, nobody would know or admit that they knew anything. But we talked\nto people who said yes, we knew that Bergen-Belsen, which was 15 miles away from\nCelle, that 1t was there, but we didn\u2019t know what was going on.

But he was told these are foreign Zwangsarbeiter, forced labor. But that\nthey were systematically starved to death, or whatever, worked to death, he didn\u2019t know\nthat. Nobody \u2014 nobody knew that other than the guards and the guards didn\u2019t tell, because\nit was self-incriminating. He supplied meats, he supplied food. Hey, we\u2019re taking food in\nthere every week, you know. Whether \u2014 that this was only for the guards or whatever,\nnobody knew, right? So what I am \u2014 what I am saying is that we did talk about it. Ther-\nThere was a death march where people were marched from the railroad 15 miles to the\ncamp. And yes, some of the people saw it and even taunted the prisoners and whatever,\nyou know, on the death \u2014 that came out later. Yes, but those people aren\u2019t going to talk\nabout it or advertise it or admit it, even. They are the ones that say, we don\u2019t want to talk\nabout the past any more, we want to lo \u2014 but the young Germans, who now \u2014 I mean \u2014 I\nmean the new, young generation, whose grandparents were the perpetrators, participants\nor silent participants, they are now asking, why did you keep quiet? How could you k-\nkeep quiet? They don\u2019t understand how they could have \u2014 how their parents and\ngrandparents could have kept quiet. And it\u2019s very hard in the 1990\u2019s, or 2000, to\nunderstand what the mentality was 50 years ago unless, you know the zeitgeist of the era,\nwhat the fears were, what the attitudes were and why people kept quiet. Why people\ndidn\u2019t speak out. They were scared. The man I told you about who lived below us, the\npeople who helped us on Crystal Night, he was a high official at the court, the Supreme\n115\nMarch 16, 2001\nCourt. And he had the key for the ar \u2014 in \u2014 in the building, and up on \u2014 on the roof was a\nflag \u2014 you know, f \u2014 a \u2014a flagstaff. And when the Nazis took over, they went up there to\npull down the red, white and blue flag to hoist the Nazi flag. And who has the key?\nRusterfeld(ph) has the key, get Rusterfeld(ph), and they said, we want the key. I don\u2019t\nhave the key. Well, give us the key or we\u2019ll break down the door. So he rummaged and\nhe found the key. And as they stormed up there and up there, he was heard to mumble\nunder his breath, I hope they break their neck. Somebody heard it and he was indicted\nand \u2014 that he made this remark. He had enough friends in the court system that witnesses\ncame up and said oh no, you heard it wrong. He said, I hope they don\u2019t break their neck,\nbecause it was so dangerous to climb up there. They gave him the benefit of the doubt\nand he was permitted to retire earl \u2014 take early retirement, okay? Now, there were people\nlike that, okay? And he was watched from there on and he couldn\u2019t afford to make a\nwrong move, but he didn't permit his daughters to ever join the Nazi party, for the girl\nthey have the JungmAadel or whatever, the Hitler youth. He could have redeemed\nhimself to prove that he was not against them by saying I want you to join, even if it\u2019s\nonly pro forma. No, he stuck to his principles. There were people like that. So who\u2019s to\nsay who is good and who\u2019s bad?",
        "A: I don\u2019t, no. My mother did, I don\u2019t. I got \u2014 yeah, I got a one time lump sum pre \u2014\nreparations because I was deprived of my education, which was, I think 5,000\n116\nMarch 16, 2001\ndeutschmark at the time, in 19 \u2014 in the early 50\u2019s, I think, under Adenauer. Nothing\nelse.",
        "A: No [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, I really hadn\u2019t thought about any final comments, I just wanted to really put on\nrecord a firsthand, you know, witness account of how I came to this country and why I\ncame to this country and what the circumstances were because things are, when they are\nretold by people who have heard the story, it\u2019s often distorted, not intentionally, but just\nby repeating. And I would like it to go on record. I hope I have created a feeling of what\nthe spirit was, both in Holland and in Germany, what the mentality was of the Jews in\nCelle, certainly. Why they did what th \u2014 why we did what we did, and you know, like\nsome of them said, why do you stay so long? Why \u2014 you know, why didn't you leave\nearlier? I\u2019ve also, when we came to America, had people ask, you German Jews, why\ndidn\u2019t you fight back? Why k \u2014 you know, you should have fought the Nazis. It shows a\ntotal \u2014 comments like that at the time showed a total ignorance of what Nazi Germany\nwas all about. How they operated, how they functioned and I mean, there were \u2014 there\nwere people who fought back. They were hauled off to the concentration camp or shot on\nthe spot, you know. Known as 6fter(ph) flucht es schussen(ph). Shot while \u2014 you know,\nshot while trying to escape. Okay, so there \u2014 there was no th \u2014 they were gangsters. They\n117\nMarch 16, 2001\nwere \u2014 they didn\u2019t play by gentlemen\u2019s rules. I mean, if you see what \u2014 what \u2014 what \u2014\nwhat \u2014 what Hitler did to his own \u2014 to his own people whom he saw as threats, as rivals,\nas \u2014 you know, th-the Wurm(ph) affair. Anybody that \u2014 that was no longer convenient\nwas eliminated. How? How does the Mafia eliminate people, right? Yes. So, people who\nsay why didn't you fight back, there were people who fought back, but there was no way\nof beating a system where the government is the \u2014 where there is no government\nprotection, where there is no police that you can go to, where there\u2019s no one to \u2014 to \u2014 you\ncan appeal to for justice, for the right thing, for protection. No way of fighting that.",
        "A: No, I feel \u2014 I feel very comfortable with Germany now. People ask me \u2014 American\nJews ask me, how can you go back to Germany after all you \u2014 ve made my peace with\nGermany. They\u2019ve paid the price. They\u2019ve tried very hard to make up for \u2014 they\nrecognize today very much what they have done. They are, you know, I feel that what we\nknow today about the way the American government acted, the Roosevelt administration\nacted, of ignoring not only the Saint Louis affair, but the \u2014 you know, many other \u2014 look\nhow close did I come of being \u2014 not being accepted in. You know, I\u2019d like to find out.\nBut it wasn\u2019t all peaches and cream and not everything that was pretended, that the Jews\nwere a political pawn, that it was inconvenient to the American and British government\nto admit the to Palestine, that they wanted to s \u2014 you know, send them to Madagascar in\ntransit, right? The Jewish state of Madagascar and other faraway places where they\n118\nMarch 16, 2001\nwould be out of the way and not in the way of the Arab situation, the oil situation. So\nwhen you see all of that, it\u2019s not that one guy wears the black hat and the other guy wears\nthe white hat. Everybody wears a gray hat. Anyway.",
