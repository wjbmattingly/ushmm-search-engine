        "GILBRIDE, Bozenna Urbonowicz\nRG-50.233*0032\nInterviewed on April 15, 1992\nGarden City, Long Island, New York\nAbstract",
        "Bozenna Gilbride, n\u00e9e Urbonowicz, was born to Christian farming parents, Wictor and Janina\n(Janka), in Wolyn, near Tuczyn, Poland. Her father hid Jews 1n a shed on his farm early in World\nWar II, and was arrested often. In late summer 1943, they barely escaped when their farm and\nvillage were burned to the ground by Ukrainians who \u201cbutchered\u201d the villagers. Her family\nimmigrated to Germany, unaware of what was happening there, Bozenna says. At Freiburg\n(Freiburg im Breisgau), Germany, eight-year-old Bozenna and her family worked in a factory\nmaking leather goods for German soldiers. An aunt gave birth to a baby. Germans drained its\nblood for German troops, and the baby died.\nThe family was moved to a slave labor camp in Chemnitz, where her parents worked in a\nmunitions factory. Bozenna contracted TB, and friends saved her from receiving a lethal shot by\nswitching her medical papers. Her mother was suspected of being in the Polish underground, so\nGerman troops beat her and sent her to Ravensbruck, where she was sterilized. Her mother was\nsent eventually to Gross-Rosen.\nBozenna says the worst part of all her experience was being separated from her mother. The\nfather and the four children remained together throughout the war.\nWhen the American front approached their camp, the Germans took the several hundred inmates\nto the nearest city, and dumped them on the sidewalk. They walked for days. Germans gave them\nfood they begged for, but would not allow them to sleep on their property.\nEventually, the family was in a DP camp in Leipzig from 1945 until the beginning of 1947, when\nthey immigrated to the United States. Bozenna was 12 and a half years old.\nAfter the war, the mother returned to Poland. She wrote to relatives in US, who said her family\nwas in New York City. Denied a visa, the mother joined the Polish underground, and was\nimprisoned. Eventually freed, and finally granted a visa, she joined the family in NYC in 1957.",
        "Tape 1 Side A\nMy father was a farmer. I think he was self-educated; he had schooling. He was in the Polish\nArmy (AK), as were my uncles. My mother came from a farming family too. She came from a\nlarge family, as did my father. My mother\u2019s family seemed to be very musically inclined.\nEverybody took to an instrument. Nobody sang, though. Grandmother, my father\u2019s mother, left\nfor America, I think, in 1938, and stayed in America. She never returned. And my father, the last\nson to marry, took over the farm and ran it for profit.\nAnd your mother, she helped?\nShe worked side by side. There\u2019s even a story that she had a baby in the field, wrapped it up and\nreturned to work. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just as accurate as they tell it.\nBut you weren\u2019t that baby?\nI wasn\u2019t that baby, no. It was later on.\nWhat was religious life in your family?\nAs far as school goes, I remember being taught religion in our local school, we observed all holy\ndays. Church, we had to walk. Sometimes we would use the wagon and go to church in Tuczyn.\nIn Tuczyn, my father had a wonderful friend, Mr. Friedman. The reason they were such good\nfriends is they dealt in the market together, selling vegetables and farm goods. I remember one\ntime Friedman sent me a pair of white galoshes. I had never seen white galoshes in my life. I\ndidn\u2019t know what they were for. You put them over the shoes. I didn\u2019t know that.\nAnd what did you do with them?\nI just wore them and flopped around in the galoshes in the house. I thought, gee what wonderful\nfloppy shoes, you know, and they were white. I\u2019d never seen white shoes before.\nWhat was the house like? I imagine it would be a farmstead?\nYes, we had three rooms, a very large living room, with many windows, kitchen, and one\nbedroom. I remember sleeping sometimes in the living room because it was warmer by the\nstove. In Poland, they had stoves that you would warm up in the kitchen, and the wall behind,\nsometimes three walls from the other sides would keep the other rooms warm, so it depended, I\nguess what the situation was, how many of us were in the same room.\nAnd I, being the oldest of four children, I was already responsible to go out with the cows into\nthe meadow and stay there all day, which I didn\u2019t like, I didn\u2019t like getting up so early in the\nmorning. It was barely daybreak, and I heard my father or mother calling me. Oh, how I hated\nthat part. I didn\u2019t want to come out of bed, but I did. I would go out to the fields, and I would cry\nalmost the whole day that I had to go.",
        "So walking the cows out -- was that your primary job?\nThat was my primary thing, and I had to learn horseback riding, bareback. That was very hard\nbecause the horse that was mine, Mischka, (Myszka?) which means a \u201clittle mouse\u2019, Mischka\nwas very frisky and every time Mischka would bend down her head to graze, I would slide\ndown. And I would cry, why would she do that to me, why didn\u2019t she let me sit on top, because\nmy father would get furious, \u2018Can\u2019t you catch on that if you go into the grass, the horse is going\nto bend down and graze and then you\u2019ll slide right down\u2019.\nAnd how long did it take for you...?\nI don\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t remember if I ever mastered, but I know that when we left Poland I\nthought about Mischka a lot. That was my horse, she was a very smart horse. When I fell down\none time and she was walking, everyone said that she\u2019s going to trample me. But Mischka, I\ndon\u2019t know how she did this. I fell down, I was in her path. She stepped over me. She knew that\nI was there, and she just kept going, but she stepped over me. I remember my father or mother\nscreaming \u201c\u2019Bozenna, Bozenna, Bozenna\u2019\u201d\u2019. I was in the path of that horse. But Mischka didn\u2019t\nhurt, she just stepped over me.\nNow, you rode Myszka not as sport, this was not sport, this was...?\nSport, no this was for sport. I was learning, I was learning, but eventually I would have to\nmaster. Everybody had to learn these things. Skiing was something, was something you had to\nlearn. There wasn\u2019t much to do on a farm.\nIt was dull?\nWe didn\u2019t know it was dull, no. It wasn\u2019t what our children have now.\nDid you have electricity?\nNo. I remember a wireless radio though. And when we left Poland, when we ran, I remember\nrunning and thinking, oh, my gosh, we left that wireless behind. I thought that was magic, my\nradio. It was forbidden to listen to, forbidden.\nUnder the Germans or under the Russians?\nCommunists, Communists, yes. We kept it in the drawer in our bedroom, covered with cloth.\nAnd the only time they listened to the wireless was if you invited a neighbor or two. This way,\nthey wouldn\u2019t give you away.\nAccomplices?\nRight, right. But I remember my father talking about Hitler. I had no idea who Hitler was.\nWhat did your father say about Hitler?",
        "I remember him saying, \u201c\u201cOh my God, what is he doing now.\u2019\u201d That\u2019s about all I remember,\n\u201cLook what he\u2019s doing now,\u2019\u201d in shock, you know, \u201c\u201cLook what he\u2019s doing now.\u2019\u201d But I never\nknew what he was doing.\nYou didn\u2019t even know he was a German or a Nazi or anything of that sort?\nI had no idea. Even in school at Christmas time when the Communist authorities would come to\ninspect the schools, our teachers would suddenly speak Russian. We were told that when\nauthorities would come, that they will ask you, \"\u2018And who gives you candy?\u2019\" We were\nsupposed to shout, \u2018Papa Stalin gives us candy!\u2019 And then they would throw candy at us, which\nthey did. They would throw handfuls and handfuls of wrapped candy at us, and we would squeal\nwith delight. We had no idea who Stalin was. We had no television, no regular papers, wireless\nwas forbidden, how would you know anything, especially children? Nothing, children were\nprotected all the time. You tell children nothing, that\u2019s the best way.\nDid your parents ever talk about these things to you? Did they coach you in any way?\nMy only coaching came, there was one warm summer, my mother sent me to the River Bug [ph\n78], which was in our front yard almost. We had a shed there, and my mother\u2019s instructions\nwere to take the bread and soup to these people and give it to them. But if you are stopped on\nthe road, turn around, speak to no one, and come right back home. And I did this repeatedly,\nover and over, but I never saw people in the shed, just hands. I didn\u2019t know if they were men or\nwomen or children. There was no way of knowing. And this would go on, and then they would\nstop, these visits to the shed. And then later, they would resume again. And my father, at that\ntime, he was arrested frequently.\nThis would have been under the Russians?\nStill under Communism, yes. And I didn\u2019t know why, I thought this had something to do with\nhim being in the military. At this point my aunt, the wife of the Polish officer, moved in with us\none night. In the middle of the night she came, and it was all very hush-hush, whispers. She was\npregnant then, and had three little boys. But my uncle, her husband, was nowhere in sight that\nnight. She didn\u2019t stay long with us. The Communists came in the middle of the night, grabbed\nher, the three little children, and they were shipped to Siberia. At that time, we didn\u2019t know\nwhere they took them. But after the war, we had the full story. She lost the little baby girl in\nSiberia.\nDo you know when this happened?\nMy recollection is, it was less than a year before we left Poland, less. We left Poland in 1943,\nand it was before that, but not long. It wasn\u2019t long before that.\nBut under the Russians?",
        "Oh, yes, yes. Now I know that those people that my father was giving the shed to, and hiding\nthem, they were friends of friends, Jewish friends. I found out, when I got to America after the\nwar, that that\u2019s who these people were, I never knew who these people were, they were just\npeople. The children were protected, don\u2019t tell the children too much. Tell them nothing, it\u2019s\neven better. So we never knew.",
        "Under the Russian occupation in 1939, did your father lose his farm?",
        "No, it became a collective farm. I remember that you couldn\u2019t kill a pig. I remember that my\nfather and neighbors did kill a pig together, slaughtered it and divided it. You couldn\u2019t do it\nalone because you were afraid somebody would snitch, but of course, if you got your neighbors\nin on it, you could get away with it. Also, we had a bee farm, and a portion of the bees, the\nhoney, had to be given back to the Communists. They would send someone who would collect\nthe honey, and they would leave us a small portion.",
        "Did this bee farm precede the time of the Soviet occupation? I mean was this something\nthat ...?",
        "It was already there, but that wasn\u2019t our bee farm. It was rented by somebody else. He used our\nland for that. We also had nuts. We grew nuts, too. That too, a portion had to be given to the",
        "Communists.",
        "What else did your parents grow on the farm?",
        "Potatoes, wheat, those were the primary. Wheat and potatoes were the primary things.",
        "Do you remember the outbreak of war in September 1939?",
        "No, no. When parents listened to the wireless, they usually made sure you weren\u2019t there. The\nchildren didn\u2019t hear it or know that they\u2019re listening because you were afraid. Children go to",
        "school; children talk on the streets, children tell each other. You didn\u2019t let the children know",
        "these things. It was safer that way. That\u2019s why, to me, that wireless was a magic box. I didn\u2019t\nknow how you can get a voice out of that.",
        "You described going to school. You began going to school under the Soviets in the fall of",
        "1939. Besides telling you where your candy was coming from, what else did they teach\nyou?",
        "I don\u2019t remember anything else. I remember portraits of Stalin being in the classrooms, that I\nremember. Oh, yes, I remember when the Communists would come into town, and they would\nbe walking in the road in front of our house. We were given orders, I don\u2019t know by whom,\nthough. We had little red flags, and you had to put them every so often on the fence to welcome,\nthe red flags were to welcome the Communists who visit the town, that I remember. And I\nremember my father saying something like, \u2018Are they gone?\u2019 And he\u2019d run out and pick up all\nthe red flags, and hide them for the next time that we\u2019re told to put out the red flags.",
        "Did you see Soviet Army troops?\nMarching, mm-hmm, in front of our house, yup.\nAnd how did they behave?\nAs if they were our saviors. As if they were \u2014 I never saw any -- they never terrorized us. There\nwas nothing like that. They rode their horses, with their chins high. I was terrified of their boots\nand shoes because they were shiny. I never saw shiny shoes on a farm. We never saw shined\nshoes.\nMuddy would be the word.\nMuddy, yeah. To this day, I still have a fear of boots, high shiny boots like policemen wear. I\u2019m\nnot alone, I know a lot of other survivors that are scared of high, shiny boots.\nFor the sound that they make.\nClick, click, yes.\nHow was your mother taking these changes? We talked a little bit about your father.\nYou mean at that time, what was happening?\nYes, in 1938, 1939, 1940?\nMy mother, I don\u2019t remember her doing anything but working, working, working right alongside\nof my father. And then, of course, family matters. She was a very family oriented woman. We\ndid have hired help. When a new baby would be born, my mother would get a lovely Ukrainian\ngirl that was very friendly to us. She would come, take care of the baby so that my mother could\nwork the fields with my father. And then she would disappear until the next baby\u2019s born. And\nthen the same girl would come back, and she was very nice to us. She was a very gentle lady, a\nyoung girl, she wasn\u2019t a woman yet, she was a girl. But she was older then the rest of us, so to us\nshe seemed like a lady. But I don\u2019t remember a childhood really on the farm. I worked from the\nday I was born. I always felt like I was a mother, always, I don\u2019t remember anything else. I was\nalways taking care of somebody. I always had to be very grown up.\nSo you were kind of a baby sitter since your mother was working on the farm much of the\ntime?\nYeah.\nWould you call your mother strict?\nNever, no, no. My father, yes. There\u2019s a Polish expression that the man 1s the king of the house,\nbut the woman is the crown, so she is above him.",
        "So she is above him.\nIn a very nice way, right?\nUhm, did you have any pets other than your famous horse?\nYes, yes, we had dogs. As a matter of fact, when we ran from our farm, the dog had puppies.\nOh, and I was so upset, what will become, because the whole village was burned. That means if\nshe wasn\u2019t smart enough to drag those puppies from under the shed, they would perish.\nWhen was your village burned?\nLate summer of 1943. We had horses, cows, lots of cows, pigs, sheep. It was a regular farm.\nNow, from what I understand from relatives, our farm was a very thriving farm. My father was\nvery knowledgeable about farming, and he really was very devoted to his land. That land in\nWolyn, the soil is very black, it is a very rich soil, it\u2019s a farmers dream to till such soil. And my\nfather recognized that even then, that that 1s good, rich soil. We can live on land like that, and we\ndid. We were not wealthy, but we were never hungry, ever. There was always some fruit, there\nwere some nuts, there was honey. There was all kinds of ways of fixing potatoes. There were\nleftover scraps of meat. My mother would dream up these concoctions, and we thought it was\nheaven.\nSo as far as you knew you were not missing out on anything?\nNothing, we were fine.\nWere you old enough to have dreams, that is, dreams of what you would do when you grew\nup?\nNo, I never had dreams like that.\nWhen is the first time you saw Germans?\nWell, when we run from our village, from our farm, in 1943. The village was burned to the\nground and butchered by the Ukrainians, who wanted, from what I understand now, the land that\nwe were on. We were the minority in Wolyn. All summer long, we would sleep out on the\nfields, because we knew they were determined to kill us and burn the village. But this one\nsummer night, we decided to sleep in our beds, and that\u2019s the night that 1t happened.\nOur neighbor came to our window and quickly rapped on our bedroom window, waking us all.\nHe said, \u2018Wictor, Wictor, they are burning our village, this is the night.\u201d We just jumped out of\nthe bed. There was no time to find clothes. In the dark, you couldn\u2019t put lights on, you couldn\u2019t\nlight a candle or anything. We ran out the door, and we could already look back and see the\nvillage burning. You could hear the crackle, the homes collapsing already in the fire. We ran\nthrough the wheat, through the forest, heading for Grandma\u2019s house.",
        "We thought that from that end of the village, maybe we could get to Grandma and Grandpa and\neveryone there, and warn them and run together. But it wasn\u2019t like that. By the time we reached\nGrandma, that end of the village started to burn too. So we headed in another direction. While\nwe were running, my father had the bright idea that he\u2019d like to go back to the farm, and let all\nthe animals out of the barns because he had visions that we\u2019d return to the land again. So we\ndidn\u2019t know if he was safe, because he ran back. He told us to keep running towards the river.\nThen, as we were running towards the river and realized he\u2019s not behind us, we didn\u2019t know \u2014\ncontinue or wait for him, what? My mother said, \"\u2018Keep running, don\u2019t stop.\u2019\" So we\u2019re\nrunning and running and running, and behind us there\u2019s a man following us. And my mother\ngrabbed the youngest child who was almost three, and she told us, \u2018Hold on to each other, don\u2019t\nlet go, and run as fast as you can\u2019. As we were running, the man behind us is calling my\nmother\u2019s name \u2018Janka, Janka, Janka...\u201d My mother is so frightened, because many people knew\nus in the village, not just Poles, but Ukrainians knew us to.\nWell, we were running as fast as we could, and it was my father. He caught up to us, but in the\ndark, in the moonlit night, you couldn\u2019t tell. Eventually, we reached the river, and we went to\nthe forest near the river, and we spent the rest of the night hoping Grandma was okay. We were\nvery close to her house. Morning came. We all decided that we have to move on. We can\u2019t stay\nhere, it\u2019s daylight, because they\u2019Il come looking for us.\nThe Ukrainians?\nYes, they\u2019ll come looking for us to finish us off. So we crossed the river, and in the river, as we\nwere crossing, there was a teenage girl from the village, with a dog, a big German shepherd.\nAnd that dog barked and barked and barked. And she was still in the water, and she was begging\nus, \u201cPlease, please Mr. Urbonowicz, please take me with you.\u2019\" And there were lots of people.\nWe weren\u2019t alone. There were many other villagers with families. They had a conference, all\nthe grown-ups there at the river, and they decided not to take her along. They asked her to leave\nthe dog because he\u2019ll give us away with that barking. She wouldn\u2019t. She chose to stay with the\ndog. And we continued, and we crossed the river into the clearing.\nThis was the Bug [ph245] River?\nBug [ph245] River, yeah. And when we crossed the river, heading for my aunt\u2019s house, we\nstood up. And the field was open, no trees. The shots started to ring out. The Ukrainians or\nsomeone was waiting for us to stand up and show ourselves. So we all hit the dirt, and we\ncrossed on all fours into the next patch of woods into the forest.\nThere, we went to my aunt Leocadia\u2019s house. The house was empty, no one was there. We got\nfrightened, we started to walk away. Near her house was a pond, it was mud at this point. As we\nwere walking out of her house by the pond, bodies stood up covered with mud. My God, we\nthought, this is it for us, all of us. We\u2019re finished now. That was my aunt and my uncle and their\nchildren. They were hiding in the pond. When we knew they were okay, we went to another\naunt\u2019s house across the road to see if she\u2019s okay.",
        "There, the chicken and geese were running over the house. The front gate was swinging. But\nthey had children our age, so my mother thought she could get clothes for us and dresses,\nbecause we were only in our nightshirts and barefoot. My mother dressed us, and my father said\nhe was going back to the farm to see. My father loved his land. He had to go back to see if it\u2019s\nokay for us to return. And he was gone a long time. My mother got nervous. She decides to go\nfind him. She leaves us lying on the cot there, and she goes.\nShe told us that when she got to the farm, there was nothing standing. She didn\u2019t see Wictor\neither. She didn\u2019t know what to do. She knew we were hungry, so she grabbed a chicken by the\nhead, and decided she\u2019s going to take the chicken back to us, and we\u2019ll have dinner. As she\u2019s\nrunning with this chicken, holding the chicken by its neck, there\u2019s a man running after her. She\ngot so scared, she dropped the chicken and ran fast. But it was my father. He recognized her\nagain.\nTwo cases of mistaken identity in one week.\nThis is fright, this is fright you know. By then, my mother found some clothes for us, and we\nstarted to go deeper into Poland. We walked into Tuczyn that was where Mr. Friedman lived.\nWe stopped at Friedman\u2019s. We did that often at Friedman\u2019s house, because he lived close to our\nchurch. So we often stopped and shook the sand from our shoes and continued to our church,\nwhich was just a stone\u2019s throw away from him.\nIn Friedman\u2019s house, we were told to lie down and rest. Mr. and Mrs. Friedman took my mother\nand father to the kitchen, but they didn\u2019t close the door. And I being the oldest, and I wasn\u2019t that\ntired, I heard what they were saying. And my father was pleading with Mr. Friedman to leave\nthe town and run. \u201c\u2019Don\u2019t stay here.\u201d And Friedman said, \u201cNo, this is my home, this is my land,\nand I am staying.\u2019\u201d And we left them there in that house, standing in the doorway, and bidding\nus farewell.\nAnd Mr. Friedman was Jewish?\nHe was Jewish. They were friends that my father dealt with in the market.\nHow had he managed to survive two years of German occupation?\nNo, he did, he did.\nNot in hiding?\nNo, no, no.\nThe Ukrainians when they were burning your village, did they discriminate between\nUkrainian and Polish homes?\nWe didn\u2019t see a difference. The whole village was burning. I don\u2019t know. The whole village was\ndown to the ground, nothing remained. When my father ran back to see if any of our livestock",
        "was returned to the barns, or anything, nothing was standing. The brick schoolhouse, my father\nsaid, remained standing. But everything else was leveled. Nothing. You wouldn\u2019t recognize one\nhouse from another that stood there. You wouldn\u2019t know.\nWould you know where they got their weapons?\nNo, most of the arms, they were knives, that kind \u2014 most.\nSo they didn\u2019t have firearms?\nWe heard firearms, but I know for a fact that most of their arms \u2014 they were butchering people \u2014\nthat\u2019s why we use that expression. They were butchering because that is exactly what they were\ndoing. They would slit your throat or stab you.\nThis was a very primitive operation?\nVery primitive, yeah. But when we left Friedman, we decided to go deeper into Poland. There\nwere throngs of us by then on the road, with nap sacks, pushing baby carriages, homeless people\nlike us.\nFleeing the same?\nThat\u2019s right.\nFor two years you lived under German occupation?\nSoviet, Soviet that part of, that part, not German yet, I was still...\nSo this was still before 1941?\nThat\u2019s right. Now in 1943, I was still under the Soviet occupation, that part of ... we didn\u2019t see\nanything different. There was no difference there. When we left the farm and ran, we ran right\ninto the arms of the Nazis now.\nI\u2019m saying that period between 1941 when the Nazis took over your area and then in 1943\nwhen Soviets are returning, did you have any experience that\u2019s...?\nNo difference. No, we didn\u2019t see the difference there.\nNo difference?\nNo! I didn\u2019t see German soldiers.\nNo German soldiers, no atrocities?",
        "No, nothing.\nSo the first atrocity that you experienced was at the hands of those Ukrainians?\nThat was first, yes. That was first.\nIn 1943, and this is what drives you deeper into Poland, and when you first run into Nazis?\nThat\u2019s right, and there were throngs of people with knapsacks, and we didn\u2019t know which way to\ngo. And we marched right into the arms of the Nazis in Poland. I didn\u2019t know what city or what\ntown this was in, but when we arrived, it was getting towards the evening and the Nazis had told\nus that they\u2019Il put us up in this abandoned school building or something, or railroad station. It\nwas just a building really, a big building. As a matter of fact, we couldn\u2019t even get inside the\nbuilding, there were too many people. We wound up sleeping on the outside. But the Germans\ntold us that the Ukrainians, they frightened us really, now I see. They told us that they are\n\u2018\u201c\u2019 going to come back tonight to finish you off. We will give you arms. You can defend\nyourselves.\u2019\u201d\nThe Germans are going to help you to defend yourselves?\nAgainst the Ukrainians. This is what they told us the adults, yes. They are going to defend us. In\nthe morning, they made us an offer, the Germans, we couldn\u2019t refuse. They did come to attack\nus, by the way, all night long.\nThe Ukrainians?\nOh, yes, oh, yes. There was shooting all night long, bullets whizzing past our ears, because we\nweren\u2019t inside the building, we couldn\u2019t get in, 1t was too crowded. In the morning, the Germans\ntold us that we can go to Germany, that we\u2019ll have a place to live, we\u2019ll have a job, we\u2019ll be\nwarm, and we\u2019ll have food. What else could we do? We couldn\u2019t go back. We didn\u2019t know\nwhat was really happening in Germany.\nWagons came very quickly; this was done very, very fast. The cattle cars arrived. I had never\nseen a train in my life. I thought cattle cars were the only way to travel. What did I know? No\none ever showed me any other way. They rounded up the people and they very quickly pushed\nus into the wagons. There were too many people, so we ended up standing shoulder to shoulder.\nIn a cattle car, there\u2019s no windows, just slits on top, elongated kinds of slits. And you couldn\u2019t\nbreathe when there\u2019re so many people. And there were no facilities.\nWe traveled, I think, two nights or two days a night, I don\u2019t remember. I was only about eight\nand a half. I don\u2019t remember food or water being given, I\u2019m sure there was some at some point.\nI know that mothers were crying because they had no room. They wanted to nurse their babies;\nthey couldn\u2019t. There was no room.\nWhen we arrived finally in Freiburg, Germany and the doors slid open, I knew we left people\nbehind, but I didn\u2019t know that they were dead. There were babies, there were old people. They",
        "just fell down when we started to file out from the wagons. They probably died standing up,\nbecause there wasn\u2019t enough room to lie down. They quickly put us into an abandoned building\nin Freiburg (Freiburg im Breisgau), where my mother and father worked in a leather factory,\nmaking things for the Nazi troops. Children worked in a field. I can\u2019t remember what we did in\nthat field, though. Did we pick potatoes, plant potatoes? I can\u2019t remember a thing. I just\nremember walking and being very, very cold, and picking up rocks from the field.\nThis would have been late summer, fall?\nLate summer, fall, yes, yes, as soon as we got there.\nSo it would be harvest time?\nWe were doing something. I know now why I don\u2019t remember, because I started to get sick with\nTB. And my mother begged one of the guards in the factory to get some medical attention for\nme. Now, we were still not in the normal type of slave labor camp. They were just keeping us\nthere for factory work. Later, they started to divide us, and sending us wherever Germany\nneeded slave labor. By the time the German guard offered to help me, I was very, very sick\nalready. I was semi-conscious by then.\nHe came in a little black car like a Volkswagen, and he took me to a hospital. I remember riding\nwith him, and I saw a gray building that I thought would be a hospital, and I was impressed that\nI\u2019m going to be in that beautiful, beautiful kind of a building. But that was not for people like\nme. That was a German hospital. Far away from that hospital, he told me later, that that was for\nPolish swine. And that\u2019s where they kept people like me. I remember lying in that hospital. And\nmy mother said years later that she came to visit me. But I didn\u2019t know really that she snuck out\nfrom that place somehow and got to the hospital.\nI remember that I was very sick and I thought I was dreaming that my mother was sitting next to\nme and stroking my hand and talking sweet, you know, like mothers do. But I thought I was\ndreaming, so I wouldn\u2019t open my eyes. I thought if I open my eyes, the dream would stop. So I\nnever opened my eyes, and my mother died never knowing that I knew that she was there. But I\ndidn\u2019t want to open my eyes.\nI was in the hospital, my mother said, three to four months. It was very cold, but it was drawing\nclose to spring when another guard came to bring me back to my mother. But he didn\u2019t come in a\ncar this time, he came on a bicycle. And it was cold, and I was holding on to the handlebars. I\nwas sitting on the handlebars, holding on. And I remember the road still having patches of snow.\nBut it was thaw already, and it was mud, and the bicycle was constantly splashing mud all over\nmy legs. When we got to the building where they kept us, I couldn\u2019t get my hands off the\nhandlebars. I thought they froze to the handlebars. He had to help me get my fingers straightened\nout. My mother begged them, if they\u2019d only let me rest a little bit and they said no, I had to go\nback to the field with the other children.\nAt this point, my hair was already shaved, because I was infested with lice. All of us were. My\nhair was just growing back. I had to wear a beret. Somebody gave me a hat. But when I returned",
        "from the hospital, I had no shoes. My shoes were stolen, so I had to wrap rags around my feet.\nWe slept with our shoes under our pillows, that\u2019s how bad it was. No one had shoes.\nWhat did they feed you?\nIn this particular camp, they had the ugliest soup ever. It was soup made out of cherries. I hated\nthat. It was sweet-sour. I didn\u2019t remember anything but that soup, and there was vegetable that\nthey gave us, like turnip. That was an over abundance. I don\u2019t remember milk. Maybe we did get\nit. | don\u2019t remember seeing milk there.\nHow about sleeping conditions?\nSleeping, we slept, this building, there were no beds. We slept on a floor. Whatever we brought\nwith us, belongings, clothes for a pillow, or if you happened to have a blanket, you covered all\nyour children with one blanket. That\u2019s why we were so lice-infested there, because we were on\ntop of each other.\nWas the family allowed to stay together?\nYes, at this point, yes.\nSo there was segregation based on gender\u201d\nNo, no.\nWhich kind people were in this camp? Were they all from your town, village?\nNo, strangers, strangers at this point. But from what I remember, we were all Poles at this place.\nAll Poles?\nWe all spoke Polish, I don\u2019t remember hearing any other language there.\nNo Ukrainians?\nNo, I didn\u2019t hear it, no. In the end of the spring, beginning of the summer, wagons came and\ntrucks and all of us had to quickly get out, get into these trucks, and they drove us to a slave\nlabor camp. We didn\u2019t know what a slave labor camp was, in Chemnitz. This was a whole\ndifferent story. Chemnitz had tall fence, it had a wire on the top, and it was located between the\nrailroad tracks and a munitions factory, where my mother and father worked.\nMy father\u2019s job was loading torpedoes onto a truck that hauled them away to I don\u2019t know\nwhere. My mother worked in that factory with a Ukrainian woman, and they became best of\nfriends, these two women. Now, in this camp, it was all different. It was organized. We had\nother nationalities, we had French in there, we had Ukrainians, we had gypsies. And I never",
        "knew what a gypsy was. I thought gypsies only read tarot cards. They were nice people, you\nknow, but I thought that\u2019s all gypsies did.\nCould they tell fortunes?\nNo, no they were just like rest of us. But like I said. there were French, there were Russian\nwomen there, there were children, many, many children. We were forbidden to look towards the\nrailroad tracks, but I was curious, and I did look. I thought I could see something that would look\nlike human beings, but there were never any people at the train station. I never saw people. I\nknew trains stopped there, because I could hear the screech of the wheels coming to a stop. They\npicked up something or delivered something.\nIn this camp, we stayed from sometime from 1944 summer, late spring, to the end of the war\nalmost. My mother in Chemnitz somehow wrote a letter to her brother who was working as a\nslave laborer at a German farm. Now, how my mother managed this, I don\u2019t know. She wrote a\nletter...\nHow she managed to write the letter, how she managed to know that her brother was...?\nYes, how did she know? I never learned this from my mother. How did she know where to send\nthis letter? She wrote a letter and put three leaves of tobacco, because he was a chain smoker.\nAnd don\u2019t ask me where she got the tobacco. I don\u2019t know how these people managed these\nthings. They must barter somehow in the camp. Somebody must have had it. And in the letter,\nshe said something to the effect that it won\u2019t be long now when the children will be finished off\nfirst, because of the food, the lack of food. And the letter was thick. It was censored. They\nopened the letter, and they quickly arrested my father. My mother signed the letter with the\ninitial \u201cJ\u00b0\u2019 for Janina. And somehow, in their haste, they thought it was my father who wrote the\nletter. They came and arrested my father. They interrogated him all night, beat him something\nterrible, because he didn\u2019t know anything, and they insisted he did.\nThey showed my father in the morning the letter, and when he saw my mother\u2019s initial without\nrealizing he said, \u201c\u2019But that\u2019s Janka\u2019s letter.\u2019\u201d But he was so beaten at this point, he didn\u2019t know\nwhat he was saying anymore.\nSo he incriminated your mother?\nYeah, I\u2019m sure...\nIt\u2019s interesting that a prisoner could be arrested, because in effect, he\u2019s a prisoner already.\nYes, you were already a prisoner, right? But they came when they realized their mistake in the\nmorning. They brought my father back, and they took my mother. And I remember my mother\nand my father passing each other, and my father said to her, \u201c\u2019 Janka, we now have real trouble.\u2019\u201d\nAnd my mother whispered to me that she hid nine German marks, money, under the mattress.",
        "She said, \u201cIf you need it, use it\u2019\u201d. You know, very thrifty woman, she salvaged nine marks, and\nhid them in a mattress, for some day.\nIt seems the reason my mother was really in trouble, not only because of that letter, but the\nUkrainian woman that she worked with made a suit for her boyfriend out of a gray blanket, and\nhe escaped. That was a successful escape. There were other successful escapes. The Germans\nthought that there was a Polish or some underground working inside the camp. And my mother\nand this Ukrainian girl, they worked shoulder to shoulder, so they must know something.\nThey\u2019re probably part of it. That woman maybe was, but my mother definitely wasn\u2019t. So, they\narrested my mother and that woman too.\nMy mother and she were terribly beaten to reveal names of others. There were no others to\nreveal, and the more they denied, the more they were beaten. Both women were then sent -- this\nis already pushing towards the end of 1944 -- both women eventually were sent to Ravensbruck\nconcentration camp. My mother in the camp, she was sterilized so she would never have \u2014 they\nway they put it to her -- so there would be no more Polish bastards born in the world. That\u2019s\nwhat they told her.\nTape 1 Side B\nNever, never, never discussed, she could be a Polish or a German Jew but it was something the\nwomen protected. They protected each other like that, they knew.\nDid your mother wear a uniform\u201d\nShe did.\nWhat kind of badge or emblem did she have on?\nShe had her red triangle, red triangle with letter P.\nRed triangle, political?\nRed triangle with a \u201cP\u201d\u2019, with a \u201cP\u201d. I don\u2019t know her number. The reason we found, tracing my\nmother\u2019s number, her batch of numbers, could have been destroyed when Germans were\ndestroying all records, when the front was approaching. We had found some other women who\nalso lost, who were there with friends. Friends\u2019 numbers survived, records, and some women\nyou can\u2019t find. This is something we found in Poland very often. We met three women. One was\nonly listed, she said. We went through the camp together, the two other women, their records\nwere destroyed.\nBut going back to my mother, she did spent time in the hospital, Revier, in Ravensbruck. She\ntold us stories that you could only stay in the hospital three days. If you didn\u2019t get better, you\nwere administered a lethal shot. She said her friends had falsified her papers that hang over your\nbed. Someone had died, and they hung someone else\u2019s papers, switching, because if her original\npapers that she had come in there with three days ago stayed there, and she didn\u2019t get better and",
        "leave the bed, she would have received her lethal shot. So they switched papers somehow, so she\ncould stay another day or two, when she could be stronger and walk out. My mother was always\ndetermined that she would not go \u201c\u2019through the chimney.\u2019\u201d That was a favorite expression.\nThat\u2019s what gave them hope. That was not the way she\u2019s going to die, just as her friend was.\nThey\u2019re not going to go through the chimney.\nEventually, there was a German guard when my mother was in the solitary, there was a German\nguard who came one time to my mother with a little jar of vaseline. And, he said mater of factly\nto her, \u201c\u2019My wife feels sorry for you. She sent you this Vaseline.\u2019\u201d My mother said it was a\nblessing and a curse, because she couldn\u2019t show the vaseline to any of her friends, her inmates,\nbecause they would fight for it and take 1t away from her. She couldn\u2019t let anyone see it, because\nshe\u2019d be accused maybe of stealing 1t someplace. She slept with it under her armpit or between\nher legs.\nWhat did she do with it when she worked?\nI have no idea what she did. Did she have a pocket, did she have underwear, did she stick it\nsomeplace else? But she said this is what she had to do to make sure that they didn\u2019t steal that\nlittle jar of vaseline. You couldn\u2019t go to sleep with possessions like that.\nWas she able to use it?\nShe did, she did, while she was in solitary, she did. She was alone. But when she came out, she\nwent out to the barrack. But eventually, they send her from Ravensbruck to Gross-Rosen, where\nshe worked in the stone quarry. But we remained in Chemnitz, the family, until spring of 1945.\nThere weren\u2019t that many of us that survived. We were thinned out by then. We weren\u2019t as\ncrowded anymore.\nWhat did you do, what was an average day like for you?\nFor children?\nYes.\nThere were German women who took charge of the children while the adults worked in the\nfactory. They taught us the glories of the Third Reich. They taught us how to knit scarves. We\nthought the scarves were for us, because winter was approaching. They were for their own\nchildren for Christmas presents. They confiscated all these green little scarves, and took them\nhome for Christmas presesents for their own families.\nI know at one point there, when my mother was gone, I lost all interest in my appearance, and it\nwas very important to the Germans that we be very neat and clean, and our hair be combed. But\nwhen my mother was arrested, and I became the mother in the family, I lost interest in things.\nAnd one time I was sitting at a long bench with my brother and sisters, and I guess I wasn\u2019t very\nclean, or my hair wasn\u2019t combed, I don\u2019t know, but she grabbed me and she slapped me because\nI was dirty. She called me a dirty Pole and I fell, I was so surprised, I fell, I lost my balance and",
        "fell down. And she even kicked me once so the children would know that it\u2019s very important that\nwe listen and that we stay neat and clean. I remember one time there was no food, and I went to\nthe dump behind the kitchen there. There was a dump, and I found apple peels and potato peels. I\nwas in heaven. I thought potato peels. I thought, I hadn\u2019t seen a potato in so long. I brought the\npotatoes to the barrack, and the women were beside themselves with joy. How are we going to\ncook these? We want to have potatoes. We want to taste potatoes. And somehow they cooked the\npotatoes. I don\u2019t know how. I remember eating them, and they were full of sand. I don\u2019t think\nthey washed them very well.\nBut in 1944, in the spring, I suppose the front was approaching. The wagons came and trucks and\nthey told us to take our belongings, and get into the wagons. They took us to the outskirts of the\ncity. They dumped all of us on the sidewalk. We still had several hundred people. And no one\ntold us what this was all about. When we were all on the sidewalk, the German guards lined us\nup with guns, and told us to march and find the American front. We didn\u2019t know which way to\ngo. They told us not to turn back because they were going to shoot. We had too many\nbelongings. We started to leave things on the sidewalk. We started to walk in the direction they\npointed, towards the forest.\nAs we started to wind our way through the city into the open field and head into the forest, some\nGerman people came out they whispered to us to stay on the road not to go into the fields\nbecause the fields are mined. We stayed on the road for days. We traveled for days. We slept in\nthe forest. We slept in abandoned railroad cars. Sometimes, we would sneak into a German barn\nif it was dark, and we could do that without anyone noticing, if the dogs didn\u2019t bark. At this\npoint, people started breaking up into different units. Everybody had their own idea which way\nto find the American front.\nYou had no escorts, no guards?\nNo, nothing, they just let us go loose into the German population.\nWas your father with you?\nYes, my mother was already in the Ravensbruck, there were four of us.\nSo your father was your guide, so to speak?\nYes, he was, but the German people were afraid of us they would __ when we beg for food,\nthey would _, and then they would ask to spend the night in their shed or barn or something,\nthey would say \u201c\u2019nay\u2019\u201d no, there were afraid.\nYou were full of lice?\nWe were dirty, you have to remember, we were the people that they were taught to hate.\nEventually, we did find the American front. When we converged in this one place, the\nAmericans didn\u2019t know what to do with all of us. There were so many of us, every day a new\ngroup of people arriving. Where do you house all these people? Eventually, we wound up in an",
        "old abandoned schoolhouse, I think. The Americans sent us by mistake into German schools. We\nhad lost a few years of schooling. The German children ridiculed us. They called us a Polish\nswine, and I remember someone called me a Polish bandit, a Polish bandit. I thought to myself, I\nhave never done anything to be called a bandit. How did this happen? I\u2019m a swine and a bandit.\nThat was such a puzzlement to us. We couldn\u2019t figure this out.\nDid you even know what a bandit was?\nNo, I knew it was something bad, \u201cbandyta\u201d in Polish, I know what that is. How did these\nchildren consider me a swine and a bandit? What did I ever do? They were dressed beautifully,\nthese children. We were in rags. They made fun of our clothes. They had made fun of our names\ntoo, so when the Americans realized what was happening, they quickly took us out of these\nschools and they formed local schools within our group. There were teachers there. At one point,\nwe even had a priest that survived. He was with us, a Polish priest. We stayed in this one\nbuilding for few months, and then it got overcrowded, and by mistake, somehow, they shipped\nus to Buchenwald concentration camp.\nThe Americans shipped you to Buchenwald?\nThere were beds there. No one really knew how bad it was. I am sure no one knew. When we got\nto Buchenwald, and we saw what had happened in Buchenwald, they quickly took us out of there\ntoo. And they brought us to a place, a Displaced Person (DP) camp at this point. Then I learned\na name for this place, a DP camp. There were hundreds and hundreds of us, and the American\ntook care of us, there was an organization called UNRA, United Nations Relief Agency, I think,\nand they tried to send us back where we belonged. Where did we want to go? My father\nwouldn\u2019t go back to Poland. He was afraid because he had a prison record there, and he was\npositive that that record still existed, and he wouldn\u2019t go back. And he wouldn\u2019t take us children\nback, even though we had thought my mother perished, and my mother thought we had perished,\neven though the slightest chance that my mother was alive; she might be in Poland. Even that\nwouldn\u2019t make my father want to go back there. He was that afraid, so...\nNow Poland meaning...?\nCommunist Poland, yes.\nYeah, or worse. The Russian, the area that you had come from, was that still part of Poland\nat the end of the war?\nI don\u2019t think so, not any more. But he wouldn\u2019t go back. He had very bad memories.\nNow his prison record, you say he had a prison record in Poland, this was not under the\nPolish government, was it? This was under the Communist government.\nCommunists, right. And later, he told u she was also afraid someone might snitch on him for\nother activities. We were hiding people by the river. We don\u2019t know if anyone snitched ever on\nus. Did he spend time for some of that, too? I don\u2019t think he should have, but we don\u2019t know.",
        "As a prisoner of the Germans, did he get to wear a prison uniform with a triangle?\nMy father? No, not in a slave labor camp, no.\nAnd you continued to wear your usual rags?\nYour own rags, yes. There were no uniforms for us in that camp, no.\nDo you know where and when you were liberated by the Americans?\nSpring of 1945.\nYou don\u2019t know the month or the date?\nMm, mm.\nAnd the town where you were?\nI think we were in Leipzig.\nAnd the DP camp?\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking of, the DP camp was in Leipzig.\nBut you were liberated somewhere else, not far from Leipzig?\nNot far, no, very close, because this was very fast moving, so we couldn\u2019t have been very far\nfrom each place. But when, UNRA located relatives in New York, and told them that we\nsurvived the war, they sponsored us, and passports and birth certificates had to be made very\nquickly. And in that same DP camp, we were there till January 1947 in that DP camp, from 1945\ntill the beginning of 1947. We had our own little schools. They tried to teach children reading,\nwriting, math. We even made holy communion. There was priest there who taught us religion\nafter the war. Three of us, three out of the four children received holy communion. And we had\nPolish scouts, I remember. I was very impressed. I was already a teenager, 12 by then, 12 and a\nhalf I was. I was terribly impressed that Polish people even had scouts.\nWhen was the last time you attended church?\nOh, my God, from 1943 to 1947, I had no regular church, no. We prayed, but no church. Holy\ncommunion, they made a make-shift church for us for holy communion in the DP camp.\nYour schooling at the DP camp, was that in English, German, or Polish?\nPolish. It was still Polish. Yeah, but we all spoke German at this point already. Even when I\ncame here, I was able to speak German. You just pick up these things. Children pick up very",
        "quickly. And my father and mother, they could speak Russian, German, Ukrainian, Polish. They\ncould jump back and forth between these languages.\nWhen did you realize that your mother was alive?\nWe came to America in early 1947, and my mother, when she was sent to Gross-Rosen, that is\nthe rock quarry slave labor camp to work there. She with her Ukrainian best friend, again, when\nthe front was approaching, they didn\u2019t know it was. Something was changing at Gross-Rosen.\nMy mother noticed that the guards were not beating the women, they were almost kind. So my\nmother said to her friend, \u201c\u2019I am going to run for it tonight when it gets dark.\u2019\u201d And the woman\nsays, \u201c\u2019I\u2019m going with you.\u2019\u201d So my mother sat until dark and they went for the gate. The gate\nopened when they pushed. There were no sirens, no dogs, no search lights. The two women froze\nfor a second, and then took to their heels, and ran into the forest. They spent two to three days\nsleeping in the forest in dampness, until both were burning with a fever. So they decided that\nthey\u2019re going to enter the first house and ask for help.\nWhen they went to this one house, it was still dark. Lights were on inside, the door opened, and a\nman sees these two women in striped uniforms, with very short hair. He gets scared, he doesn\u2019t\nknow what to do, so he calls his wife. His wife comes in, and she sees the two women, and she\npulls them in quickly, and closes the door so no neighbors would see them standing there. And\nshe took pity on my mother and her friend, and she said, \u201c\u2019 You could spend time up in the attic,\nbut don\u2019t walk, because the ceiling creeks.\u2019\u201d So my mother said they were there two, three days\nuntil the fever subsided. The woman fed them. She took a tremendous risk, and her neighbors\ncould have reported her that she took 1n two prisoners.\nOne day, my mother hears tanks approaching the house. The roar was getting louder and louder,\nand closer and closer they came. She thought that that was the end for both of them. As they got\ncloser to the house, she recognized the language they were speaking, and it was Russian. They\nwere being liberated by the Soviet troops. And of course, the two women ran down, and the\nSoviet troops opened their arms, and welcomed them. They were very happy to find two of them\nalive.\nThey were taken after that, my mother said, to some holding camp, where in this camp they were\ntold they can either go back to Poland or to Russia. My mother, hoping we would be in Poland,\nwent to Poland. In Poland, my mother gets impatient to find us; are we dead or alive? So she\npieced an address, part of an address, and wrote something to a relative in Detroit, who knew\nsomebody in New York who knew us, who found us. This is by this point is 1949. They find us\nin New York. We start corresponding. My mother gets anxious to come to the United States. She\napplies for a visa. The visa is denied by the Communists because she is too young, she was then\n39. They need young people to rebuild Poland. We\u2019re corresponding furiously back and forth.\nMy mother gets very impatient to come. She joins the Polish underground in Poland. She tries to\ncross the border, on the water somehow. They were picked up off the water, three men and two\nwomen, by a Russian trawler. And my mother winds up in prison again. While she\u2019s sitting in\nprison, her visa does come up, but she doesn\u2019t know tt.",
        "She told her sister when she joined the underground -- she didn\u2019t tell her sister that she was\njoining the underground -- all she told her sister in Poland was, \u201c\u2019If I am in trouble, I will send\nyou a post card and the stamp will be upside down. That means I am in trouble.\u2019\u201d That\u2019s all she\nsaid, and she took off one night, without explaining anything. But when she finally came out of\nprison and reapplied for her visa from the Communists, they told her you can\u2019t leave the country,\nbecause you have a prison record. And this is like 1950, 1951 already. She came 1n1957 to\nAmerica.\nHow did she pull that?\nThe visa came through; they took pity on her, finally.\nThe Gomulka regime.\nThe Gomulka regime, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. She came on August 15, 1957. I was a married\nlady, my sister was married.\nIt\u2019s a Holy Day.\nThat\u2019s right, you remembered, good boy.\nBoy? (laughter)\nAnd we picked her up at. I remember picking her up at LaGuardia. I don\u2019t know why LaGuardia\nsticks out in my head. But I only had like a week\u2019s notice that she was coming. That\u2019s how\nquickly. A telegram arrived, that\u2019s it, \u201c\u2019Meet me at LaGuardia.\u2019\u201d I went there with my husband. I\ndidn\u2019t recognize her. I was looking for a different kind of woman, the woman that I remembered.\nThis is more than 15 years later. It wasn\u2019t anything what I expected, and I wasn\u2019t what she\nexpected.\nWas your father still around?\nHe was. He didn\u2019t come to the airport with us. He couldn\u2019t do it. Emotionally, he just couldn\u2019t do\nit.\nWhere did your mother stay during these years in Poland?\nShe knew her sister; this was Klodzko, Poland.\nSo she did not return to her hometown?\nNo, not that way, no, the opposite almost, the opposite end of Poland, near the German border,\nthe Czechoslovakian border, I think.\nAnd when did you Know that she was alive through all of this?",
        "In about 1949...\nSo when she applied for the visa, she knew you were in America?\nOh yes, she knew. That\u2019s way she applied for the visa then. Piecing little bits and pieces of the\naddress that she remembered in her head.\nSo all those years you thought that she was dead?\nOh yeah, yeah...\nAnd when you had left her in...when was that?\nThat was in about the end of 1944.\nThat is when she left you?\nYes, we were separated.\nIn Ravensbruck, that was the good bye...\nYes, that was last time.\nDid she get a chance to say goodbye to you then?\nNo, they were hustling her very fast. I\u2019m sure no one thought it was a goodbye. I don\u2019t think\nanyone thought that way at that time, mm mm. Sometimes people ask about our childhood.\nThere was no childhood for people like us. There was nothing.\nSo when did you reach adulthood, 1943?\nProbably, probably when everything -- I was the mother, definitely in the European tradition, the\noldest child takes the place of the parent that\u2019s not there. I was the mother. When my mother\narrived in New York, I was married, my sister was married, my brother was courting seriously a\nyoung girl, Polish girl. My youngest sister, the baby, who was pushing 19 already, 18, 19, she\nwas getting ready to leave and go to the convent.\nMy mother found four adults, not children. She didn\u2019t understand why we celebrated birthdays,\nnot feast days, because in Poland at that time we celebrated the saints. She couldn\u2019t understand\nwhy we do that. She couldn\u2019t understand Thanksgiving, why would you celebrate a turkey.\nDidn\u2019t make sense. We spoke English amongst ourselves. That hurt my mother, I know it did.\nA lot of things -- we never, really, really bounded after that. Now that I\u2019m mother and a\ngrandma, I understand. We never, never bonded after that. There was something torn, lost\nforever. That childhood bonding that occurs in normal average families never returned to us. It\nwas different, and I\u2019m sure my mother felt it until the day she died.",
        "She used to say, \u201c\u2019I welcome death, that\u2019s okay, that\u2019s okay.\u2019\u201d She was always disappointed that\npeople did that to people, what she saw, people did it to people, and that bothered her always,\nthat she had to witness. And I found out my mother would talk about her experience. That\u2019s why\nI know so much more, because I asked, and I kept a journal of things she said. My father had\nnightmares till the day he died. He would not talk. If we talked about the Holocaust, he would\nhear the subject beginning in the room, and he would walk out of the room. He wouldn\u2019t stay.\nHe\u2019d go and lie down, and for good measure, he would put the pillow over his head, turn towards\nthe wall, and want nothing to do with us. And he had endured a lot. He could have told us the\nstories how he had to take care of four children. What were his thoughts, trying to shelter and\nkeep these children alive? Never talked.\nWhom do you think suffered the most, your mother, you, your father?\nI think my mother. She was alone. We were together, four children and a father. We stayed\ntogether. But she was separated all by herself.\nAs a prisoner in a sense.\nYeah.\nThe Ukrainian friend was no substitute.\nWell, it\u2019s good to have a friend, you know. She remained with that woman to the end. And then,\nwhen they were liberated, each went her own way.\nDo you know when and where she was liberated?\nNo.\nSomewhere outside Gross-Rosen by Russian troops in the spring of 1945.\nYes.\nWhat was the worst experience for you during these years?\nI think when I heard in Germany after the war that -- I heard that they burned people and that\nthey put their ashes in jars and labeled the jars. I wanted to find a place like that with jars so that\nI could be convinced that she\u2019s alive or she\u2019s dead. It used to haunt me, that story that I heard\nabout the jars of ashes, and that the Germans labeled them so meticulously.\nSo the fear, the suspicion that your mother was dead, that was the worst?\nThis was at the end, already. We were liberated, but in the camp itself, it wasn\u2019t the lack of food\nthat was hurting the most, it\u2019s the separation from the mother. And then you know the father\nwould be working all day in the factory, and I was never sure if he would come back home\neither. And you would be there all day without mother, without father. These German women",
        "making fun of you and teaching you things that you didn\u2019t know why they were teaching you\nthese things. What is our future? Why are you teaching me all these things, what for?\nHow did you view the Germans?\nAt that time, I was confused. I knew they were bad, but I didn\u2019t know why. No one told us. See, I\nthought throughout the war, when I heard grownups talking, I thought that Hitler hated people,\nand he hated Poles. I didn\u2019t know at that time yet anything about the fate of the Jews. That\nwasn\u2019t discussed in front of us children, ever.\nDid you know any Jews when you were growing up?\nIn the village, yes, but I didn\u2019t know they were Jews. I found out later that these people -- I\nthought they were just Poles, because they spoke Polish. No, I never knew the difference.\nThere were no Jewish collective farmers?\nNo, I didn\u2019t see anything like that. When I came to America, I heard, when we lived in\nBrooklyn, our first place, adults talking at the kitchen table, and my father saying, \u201c\u2019My god, my\ngod, I should have seen what they were doing to the Jews.\u2019\u201d And I thought to myself, the Jews,\nand then I heard it again, \u201c\u2019to the Jews\u2019\u201d. I said to myself, how come no one says what they were\ndoing to us, too? And that was my first experience that Hitler was out to destroy all the Jews.\nAnd I was already in America when I learned this. We were never told these things.\nAnd this was from your father...?\nFrom my father, yes.\nWho, really -- did he even see what Hitler was doing to the Jews?\nHe saw. I saw Hitler in a parade someplace when we were in Germany. He was in a sidecar of a\nmotorcycle. I was very impressed with the way they were marching in this parade.\nYou literally saw him?\nI saw him.\nThis was when you were in...\nThis was sometime in 1943. It wasn\u2019t in 1943, it was sometime in 1944. We were being\ntransported from this Freiburg (Freiburg im Breisgau) to another camp, and there was a parade\ngoing. And we had to stop because of throngs and throngs of people. We got off the wagons and\nwe were standing, trying to see what was going on. My father lifted me, and my father said,\n\u201cYou see that, that\u2019s Hitler.\u201d I had no idea who Hitler was. All I remember is, he stood there",
        "and he was doing his \u201c\u2018Heil Hitler!\u2019\u201d Who is that person? I had no idea. Years later, my father\nreminded me of that. I had no idea.\nBut this is Hitler on parade, not for killing people?\nParade \u2014 oh no, no, no on parade, no, no, no. This was people screaming and shouting. And I had\nno idea who this famous or infamous person was at that time.\nNo, I was referring to your father\u2019s remark, \u201c\u2019 You should have seen what they were doing\nto the Jews.\u2019\u201d The fact is, he wasn\u2019t even seeing the worst...\nHimself. He still, he felt sorry for what they were doing to the Jews. That\u2019s why he was saying,\n\u201c\u2019My god, my god, you should see what they were doing to the Jews.\u2019\u201d But my father died\npeacefully. My mother died in her sleep.\nYou will never know what their most terrifying experience was.\nThere were so many, my father story? I can only tell you what his nightmare. I can tell you to the\nday he died, he used to beat the wall with his fists and scream. And he was always dreaming that\nthe Ukrainians were killing him; that they were successful; they butchering. He told us this, this\nwas from his lips. That was his most horrible nightmare. He was so afraid of being killed that\nway.\nAnd as it turned out, they took his farm.\nThey took his farm. They were happy, I suppose. They took the farm, they got what they wanted.\nAnd your most terrifying experience during the war?\nI think bombs falling, probably. When the sirens go off, you don\u2019t know where to hide your\nhead. Usually, when the sirens would go off, because we were between the railroad tracks and\nthe munitions factory, so the Allies were trying to bomb one or the other. I didn\u2019t know where to\nrun. We had no mother. My father couldn\u2019t come and grab us quick enough. Where do four\nchildren run? Where do we hide? That was scary, when there was no one to look after us, no one.\nAnd you didn\u2019t know whose bombs they were?\nNo we didn\u2019t know, no.\nAnd it probably would not have occurred to you that these were friendly bombs.\nNo. I remember one time, planes came and leaflets were dropped. The whole area was covered\nwith some kind of leaflet. I heard them talking later that the leaflets said something \u2014 that\n\u201c\u00b0 Hitler give up, you never win this war.\u2019\u201d But who dropped these leaflets, I have no idea. No\none ever told us. So I don\u2019t know where they came from. Was it the British or -- I have no idea,\nno idea.",
        "When did you, your father, since he was the brains of the family, at this point, realize that\nthe end was in sight, that this will not go on forever, this prison?\nI think, when they threw us from the city. They said go. They didn\u2019t know what to do with us.\nSo very late?\nYes. I\u2019m sure everybody thought that we\u2019re not going to make it, because they were\nsystematically starving. People who died, children would die. I wouldn\u2019t see actually dead\nchildren, but I knew there were children were missing, and I never questioned, where did they\ngo? Their parents are still there, where did they go? There\u2019s a child missing from this family,\nthere\u2019s a child from that. And eventually they would replace; they would send new people for the\nwork, for the labor, because that munitions factory was very important.\nAs a matter of fact, I went back to Germany last summer, and I went back to Chemnitz, and I\nstood where that camp was, and I recognized the railroad tracks. And I said to my husband as I\nlooked, I said, \u201c\u2019In back of me there should be a factory.\u2019\u201d And he said, \u201c\u2019Turn around.\u2019\u201d When I\nturned around, there\u2019s the factory. It\u2019s all there. When I asked the German woman in town about\nthe camp, did she see it? She says \u201c\u2019 Yeah.\u2019\u201d I said, \u201c\u2019 Well, I was there.\u2019\u201d And she says, \u201c\u2019That\u2019s\nimpossible, there were no children in there.\u2019\u201d And I said, \u201c\u2019\"Madam, there were many children\nthere.\u2019 She said, \u201c\u2019That\u2019s impossible, we would have known.\u2019\u201d I said, \u201c\u2019 When you saw people\nin there, behind the wire, didn\u2019t you wonder?\u2019\u201d \u201c\u2019Oh no,\u2019\u201d she said, \u201c\u2019 You\u2019re not allowed to\nasked questions. You don\u2019t know who you are talking to. They might report you, and you\u2019ll go to\na concentration camp, so you ask nothing.\u2019\u201d\nYou don\u2019t even take a close look.\nWell, she didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t know there where children there.\nAnd you weren\u2019t children any more.\nNo, no, we looked like children, though. But she was convinced that there were no children\nthere. So many people, and she didn\u2019t know. No one asked who were we, what were you doing\nthere. Nobody cared.\nSo this was the welcome that you got. You were fleeing the Ukrainians.\nYeah, always running from somebody.\nAnd Germany turned out to be a prison camp for you. Your crime?\nBeing Polish.\nBeing Polish, being refugees?",
        "No, we were their labor.\nYour parents had not committed any sabotage, or rose up against the German regime?\nNothing, nothing. An aunt of mine who left Poland with us at the same time, she was pregnant,\nand gave birth to a baby in Freiburg (Freiburg im Breisgau). They took the baby from her, and\ndrained the blood for the German troops. And eventually, in a few weeks, the baby died. My\ngrandmother worked for a German bower, a farm. She was fed so poorly that she just died of\nstarvation there, they were so cruel.\nSo family members perished?\nYeah, yeah. It\u2019s so hard to imagine things like that if you\u2019ve lived in freedom all your life, like in\nAmerica. It\u2019s so hard. Sometimes children say to me, \u201c\u2019 Why didn\u2019t you protest?\u2019\u201d Well, who, to\nwhom, where? Who was going to listen to you? I think, in Poland, probably, it was a paradox.\nWe were victims, and yet some managed to be rescuers of others. Some Poles were lucky enough\nto have saved some Jews. It\u2019s a paradox to me that they could have done that, and they did, they\ndid.\nYour younger brothers and sisters all survived?\nYes, my youngest sister died of cancer about five, six years ago. The rest are fine.\nDo you have anything to add, additional reflections?\nThe older I get, the wiser I get, the less I understand. Why? Why? Why? I\u2019m so disappointed in\npeople, sometimes, that we do that to each other. I don\u2019t know why, what for? We all look so\nmuch alike, feel the same way, hurt. There\u2019s so much more that binds us than divides us, and yet\nwe take sometimes pride in dividing from others as if we\u2019re different. I\u2019ve seen that in Europe,\nnow with national pride coming in, and that worries me. Human pride would have been so much\nbetter.\nWill it ever end?\nNo more for me.\nThank you for your story.",
