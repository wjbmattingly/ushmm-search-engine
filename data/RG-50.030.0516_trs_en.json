        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So one of the managers from the bookkeeping department, he took over with another one.\nAnd they were good friend -- I-I still was friends, he passed away.

        "Q: And when the -- the original owners left to go the u -- to the United States, was that before the\nwar, before the Nazis took over, you --",
        "A: I think it is maybe just before they came in. They still could do it, I guess --",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And they could leave.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you think they left because they thought the Germans were coming?",

        "A: A little bit, mm-hm. Nothing much happened, they bombed Rotterdam, and then they were\ngoing to bomb Amsterdam, and they didn\u2019t want -- that\u2019s why they gave over. They stopped the\nwar.",
        "Q: They stopped the war",
        "A: They saved the city.",
        "Q: -- so that they wouldn\u2019t bomb it.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",

        "A: No, I didn\u2019t look when they came in, but I know they came in, and they -- when my boss left\nthe office, the city government appointed a lawyer, you know, to look over it.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: And after that we got an German guy, he was an old soldier, he was hurt, he had one arm, I\nguess, and they put him down there, too.",

        "A: Yeah, when I had to leave in \u201942. I couldn\u2019t work any more.",
        "Q: Right. So -- so let\u2019s talk a little bit about what goes on between 1940 and \u00b042, after the Nazis\ncome in, are you identified as Jewish?",
        "A: We had to get I.D.\u2019s. I have one with me. And my parents had an J on it, and I didn\u2019t have to\nbecause I only knew two Jewish grandparents, and according to Hitler, you was not Jewish, and I\nwas someplace when we were picked up, and the men didn\u2019t know anything about Jewish\n[indecipherable] father was Jewish. And he really was not Jewish according to the Jewish\nreligion, you are what your mother is. And he was picked up and sent away and so I didn't have\nto have a J. I didn\u2019t want to be without my parents. So I took it and you could -- you couldn\u2019t go\nout after eight o\u2019clock, nobody could go out any more. And the Jews only could shop between\nthree and five, things like that. But nothing really happened til \u00b042.",
        "Q: There were -- there were a lot of restrictions, right, for those two years.",
        "A: Yeah, but not til \u201942, then they start picking up people.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, marketplaces and stoop --",
        "Q: But do you -- do you remember there were government workers who were fired because they\nwere Jewish. Do you remember that?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know, we -- where we lived it was not really a government town, was more in the\ncapital at The Hague, and all.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But I\u2019m sure they were. I was even in the private place, I couldn\u2019t work.",
        "Q: By \u00b042?",
        "A: The Jews couldn\u2019t work any more.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: But you can\u2019t -- you can\u2019t have a telephone, you can\u2019t have radios.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t have telephones.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t have a telephone anyway.",
        "A: No, only with aunt who was rich, yeah. And radios, no. They -- you could not do\n[indecipherable]. We had the radio -- see, we had the radio what you could rent and pay every\nmonth, four stations or something. And then they brought an regular one, a nice one. Well, that\nwe could not keep, you know. We have to turn that in.",
        "Q: You had to turn that in?",
        "A: Yeah. Not everybody did that but we did.",
        "Q: Right. So the restrictions are out --",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: -- they\u2019re --",
        "A: For everybody.",
        "Q: -- it\u2019s like a pain in the neck, right?",
        "A: Yeah, but it was for other people too, they couldn\u2019t listen to radio from England, and I always\nlisten to radio from England. And that you couldn\u2019t do.",
        "Q: That you couldn't do -- right.",
        "A: That\u2019s why they took it from everybody, yeah.",
        "Q: But that was true for Jews and people who were not Jewish as well?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Everybody.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Right. But there were certain restrictions that were just for Jews?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: We\u2019re -- we\u2019re gonna have to stop the tape now.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: You had an I.D. card, cause everybody had to have one.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Did it have a J on it?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It did. Is that your choice, to have it?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Yeah, that was my choice, for me yeah, cause I didn\u2019t have to. Because when I worked in the\noffice still, the lawyer went through the German embassy and got a paper for me that they could\nnot do anything to me because I was not supposed to have a J, but they didn't take it off. And I\nalways had to carry that with me, mm-hm.",
        "Q: And so that was in 1941?",
        "A: Uh--",
        "Q: The I.D. cards?",
        "A: Yeah, it could be \u201942, something around there, yeah.",
        "Q: Do you remember when the Jewish star had to be put onto people in \u201940 -- inf -- I f -- which I\nthink was in \u201942.",
        "A: That time, yeah, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Did you have to put on a Jewish star because --",
        "A: I did.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yeah, but I didn\u2019t always use it because nobody knew I was Jewish, so when they left, you\nknow. And Joe and I, we went sometimes someplace.",
        "Q: But did people know that your parents were Jewish?",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hm.",
        "Q: So wouldn\u2019t they then assume that you were Jewish, or not?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know if they thought about. Maybe I took it off later. I got --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- don\u2019t know exactly.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Were you scared when the Nazis were there, when they took over?",
        "A: No, no I\u2019m not the scary type, no, no, no.",
        "Q: You\u2019re not -- you\u2019re not the scary type?",
        "A: Joe was more than I was.",
        "Q: But when you started to see the deportations, when they started to take Jews and bring them\nto Westerbork -- well, you had heard about Westerbork before, because it was started by --",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah --",
        "Q: -- the Dutch, right?",
        "A: -- yeah.",
        "Q: For people who had come into Germany --",
        "A: Yeah, they did. Yeah, they did.",
        "Q: Right. But then when the Nazis take over, something else happens, right?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And where -- what\u2019s -- what\u2019s happening to your father? He -- he -- there\u2019s no business?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: No, I mean, bef-before he\u2019s ta --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- before he\u2019s arrested.",
        "A: Yeah, no --",
        "Q: He can\u2019t work.",
        "A: -- he could not [indecipherable] no. He -- they put him in a work camp. They did all the Jews,\nfrom the big company there, and every day they came home. Til one time, after maybe about\nthree, four weeks, they didn\u2019t come home, and they were sent to Westerbork.",
        "Q: And they were sent to Westerbork.",
        "A: And then the next day -- that was Fridays, and on Saturdays they came to pick up the wives\nand the kids.",
        "Q: And did you know he was in Westerbork, or you didn\u2019t know where he was?",
        "A: Yeah, we -- oh, we knew that, we heard that, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s up north, and you were at Amsterdam so it\u2019s a bit --",
        "A: Yeah, that is one of the northern --",
        "Q: -- it\u2019s a bit of a trip.",
        "A: -- provinces, yeah.",
        "Q: So the next day they come to pick up you and your mother?",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hm.",
        "Q: And what happened?",
        "A: We went through someplace where everybody went, and somebody asked -- my mother said\nthat I was a minor. I was already 20 [indecipherable] didn\u2019t have to show anything. He said okay,\nhe said, go home. So we could go home. And it didn\u2019t --",
        "Q: And they ju -- they believed you?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: He believed it?",
        "A: Oh yeah. I don\u2019t know if it was a Dutch guy or a German. And you know, they say too, if I\ndon\u2019t pick you up now, then somebody else will pick you up later, you know, so they let us go.\nSo my mother stayed in the [indecipherable] about almost a year.",
        "Q: Before you -- there was another arrest.",
        "A: Yeah, for half a year, something, yeah, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Did you go back to your old apartment?",

        "A: Yeah, yeah. Somebody must have told on us, and we both were, yeah. We had to go to a\ntheater, and there were a lot of people, family too, and other people, and usually people, they\nwere mixed marriage, we had friends, she was not Jewish, he was, they came out. On -- that\ntime, nobody came out. I was the only one. So they asked, anybody here that thinks they can get\nfree? [indecipherable] I said, I don\u2019t want it. And my mother says, go up front. And she push me\nand then she says, yes. So I told him. I says, yeah, I said, I am born in Germany, and my parents\ndidn\u2019t care if I was German or not, there, and they took care of me and all that, and I have an I.D.\n[indecipherable] So he said okay. He says, you can go. So it was night already. I had to go across\nthe street, was in a -- in a -- for children that went with people in the -- well, they went there, for\nchildren, so I had to go there. And somebody working in that theater, and I knew he lived across\nthe street from Joe. So I told him, says, tell Joe that I come out tomorrow morning. So next\nmorning I came out and I walked a little and there he came with a friend. His mother had my\ndog, and you should hear that doggie. Everybody was looking. He was so happy he screamed\nand screamed when he saw me. And -- and that was it. But what I did, was a good thing I did get\nthe key from the apartment. Found after people were taken out, the Germans came and took all\nthe furniture out. Everything. So I told Joe, said, what are we gonna do? And he said, you know,\nI told my other neighbor, he was Jewish, his wife was not, so he -- he had no trouble and he lived\non the fourth floor, but he slept in veranda [indecipherable] porch-like, in the back. And what\nthey did, they took all the nice furniture, put that down with the cable, I don\u2019t know how they did\nit, and up to that guy\u2019s house. He helped us. So, and what we -- was no good, we put in the front\nand they picked that up. So lucky that I have the key. And then somebody find out, his mother\ntold [indecipherable] and somebody that the neighbors downstairs has a sister and she likes to\nlive in that house. Was a beautiful apartment, was all new. Had bathroom, now nobody had an\nbathroom in Holland, except if you was rich. And -- and she told him, and Joe said to me, listen,\nwe have to go someplace else. So we found an ap --",
        "Q: Let -- le-let -- let me ask you something. When did you actually meet Joe the first time?",
        "A: Oh, I knew always, when they lived on top of me.",
        "Q: And so you were what, how old when you first met?",
        "A: I was only couple years younger, ma -- I still went to school. I was still a girl --",
        "Q: So you were [indecipherable |",
        "A: -- and he was working already.",
        "Q: I see, so you were 14 or 15?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you fell in love right away?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: He didn\u2019t pay attention to me.",
        "Q: He didn\u2019t pay attention?",
        "A: No, and I had a boyfriend and also, know?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Til later in the war, then my hus -- my mother gave some food for -- his father was in the\nhospital, and his mother picked it up. And then she saw me, and she told him, boy Joe, you\nshould see how she changed. She said, you have to come. So they both came, and that was it.",
        "Q: And that was it. And how old were then? This was -- this was when you were working?",
        "A: That was in -- no, I was about 20 - 21, something like that.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s -- uh-huh.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So that was when you were -- when it was 1941 or 1942 --",
        "A: No, that was in \u201940 -- let me see. Father wasn\u2019t there any more. Must be close to \u201943.",
        "Q: Closer to *43.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s rather late that you become very close --",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: -- but it -- 1t\u2019s rather immediate, once that happens?",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: Right. So he\u2019s somebody you want to lean on and call when --",
        "A: No, we went --",
        "Q: -- because you give a message when -- when you leave your mother. You gave a message to\nsomeone that Joe should come and pick you up, that you would be --",
        "A: No, that was in the theater, where we were.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And they were all transported to Westerbork.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I came out.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then I told somebody to tell Joe that I was coming out.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And then he picked me up, yeah.",
        "Q: Now, how --",
        "A: And we were going [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did you feel funny leaving your mother in the theater?",
        "A: Of course, mm-hm. I had s -- s -- I still thought maybe, you know, that they would come\nhome. I didn\u2019t know what they were doing that time. They never made that public.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know?",
        "Q: Right. But your mother was very clear.",
        "A: Oh, she knew.",
        "Q: She knew.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And she wanted you out of there.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: So then Joe picks you up with the dog and a friend --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s your -- it\u2019s the dog, it\u2019s the Maltese dog, the one --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- that guarded you. And how did he get the dog?",
        "A: His friend\u2019s parents took him, when Joe\u2019s parents had already dogs, mm-hm. She -- they took\ncare of him.",
        "Q: Right. So, it\u2019s clear that you shouldn\u2019t stay in the apartment where you were staying, right?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And Joe thinks you should have --",
        "A: Now, but somebody had to call that I lived there and they would pick me up --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- so, and Joe, too, and he was not supposed to live there either.",
        "Q: And -- and why was j -- Joe was vulnerable also. They were -- they were sending boys to\nGermany, is that right?",
        "A: Yeah, Germany, yeah. And his boss was working for a German company, and he was a little\nanti-Jew. And he know that Joe was going with me, and that -- he gave him up to -- for\nGermany. And he went there to the labor, there\u2019s a labor office where you go, and I went with\nhim, and he said -- he went there, and they have to report we never went to Germany. So he was\nreally at risk, too, you know?",
        "Q: Right, because he was refusing to go.",
        "A: Sure, yeah. Every young person had to go.",
        "Q: Right, right. So how did he find -- where did he find a place, another place for you to go?",
        "A: Oh, there was something, you know, as a part of the city, an apartment, so --",
        "Q: And you then had a fake name, right? Is that right?",
        "A: Then I got it -- then he got it for me, yeah. Mm-hm.",
        "Q: You had an -- you had a fake I.D.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And what was your name then?",
        "A: Karin Magteld [indecipherable] I guess, yeah.",
        "Q: Karin Magdel?",
        "A: Magteld, yeah.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Mm-hm. [indecipherable] too [indecipherable] people came from Denmark, original, mm-hm.\nSo --",
        "Q: And did -- did Joe have a fake I.D. as well?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: He could stay with his own name?",
        "A: Oh yeah, mm-hm. Was just because I had the J on it, that\u2019s why, mm-hm.",
        "Q: So he -- he and you were now separated from his family, right? Because his parents are still in\nthat apartment hou -- the original apartment house, am I right?",
        "A: Oh yeah, where I used to live, yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah. They knew, mm-hm.",
        "Q: But they knew?",
        "A: Oh yeah, mm-hm.",
        "Q: So how did you support yourselves?",
        "A: I tell you, first the -- I don\u2019t know if I told you that, that the lawyer that we had, her father was\nchief of police --",
        "Q: Mm-mm.",
        "A: -- from Amsterdam. And he to -- and she told him that we are going to live together, you\nknow, that was not nice years ago. We felt bad about it. So he said, okay, he said, when did you\nwant to get married? And we gave a date. He said, okay, he said, I'll put it in the register that you\nare married. I don\u2019t know if he did that just that we felt better, but he -- he said he did that. So we\nlived there, and Joe had no job, so -- and there was no food. So he had the good friend, and he\nsaid, go to another part from our county. He -- that was an guy that ground wheat for the farmers.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So he went there, that was 65 miles on a bicycle. And --",
        "Q: One way\u201d",
        "A: One way. And he got flour from him, and later he did again, but then he brought something,\nshe could use something, you know. And he came home the same day, he didn\u2019t want me to be\nby myself. And a little bit we had to sell to pay the rent and to buy some food. And then we had\nwheat, and I had to bake bread every time. And that\u2019s the way we did it. And he did it off --\nsometimes they took off -- took his food, too, you know, all around. But, yeah, it was quite a trip\nfor him. He always brought something home, mm-hm. And he had the --",
        "Q: And so o -- h-he left for the -- for the day and then would come back.",
        "A: Oh the same day [indecipherable]",
        "Q: It\u2019s a long trip.",
        "A: And then there\u2019s money we had, we paid for his car -- for his bicycle, because without a\nbicycle you couldn\u2019t go anyplace.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Were you able to go outside, since you were --",
        "A: Oh, I went.",
        "Q: You went outside?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: No longer wearing a star?",
        "A: No. And I had this false I.D..",
        "Q: Cause you have a false I.D..",
        "A: And nobody would say I was Jewish, I didn\u2019t look Jewish at all.",
        "Q: And you were now with people who didn\u2019t know you, so they didn\u2019t realize what your history\nwas.",
        "A: No, no, they didn't know me.",
        "Q: Right. So you felt pretty safe.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: What are you hearing about what the Germans are doing? Do you hear that there are\ndeportations from --",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Westerbork?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Are there rumors about what\u2019s going on?",
        "A: Oh yeah, we heard that, and I had an -- we had a doctor, she was a woman. And she came\nalways by to tell us, don\u2019t let Joe go out on the -- there\u2019s gonna be a razzia [indecipherable] they\npicked people. Oh, they picked just not Jews, everybody they picked up.",
        "Q: Right. So they would warn him?",
        "A: Mm-hm, yeah [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did he ever have a close call, did he ever almost get caught, or not?",
        "A: No, he was stopped by police sometimes when sa -- one time there on his bicycle.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: [indecipherable] because without my bicycle I can\u2019t -- and then when they\u2019re almost by the\npolice station they let him go, you know. They could not official do it. But like that. And\nsometimes he got picked up and he gave them cigarettes.",
        "Q: He gave them cigarettes?",
        "A: The Germans, yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And they let him go.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Oh yeah. He gave them a pack of cigarettes. Til the end when he came back the last time, the\nGermans had opened the dams, all of them, and all the water came in our county.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. And he was on top of that -- we had a lot of dykes, and he was driving then, he didn\u2019t\nknow if he could -- left or right there was all water, but he made it.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: That was almost the end of the war.",
        "Q: Did you see people being picked up around you?",
        "A: No. In daytime I didn\u2019t go outside much.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t go outside --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- you went out in the evening.",
        "A: Yeah. No, I went to the -- every day wi -- to the store, to the -- you know, to get some\npotatoes or stuff like that. And that was all, no.",
        "Q: In addition to Joe, did you have other friends who knew who you really were, or did you keep",
        "A: No, nobody re -- I --",
        "Q: Nobody.",
        "A: -- I saw people that I knew and they didn\u2019t even look at you because you could not trust\nanybody at that time.",
        "Q: What is that like not to be able to trust anybody?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It\u2019s awful.",
        "A: It\u2019s bad, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you learn that very early, that you couldn\u2019t trust anybody after the Nazis came 1n?",
        "A: If I what?",
        "Q: Did you learn that very soon after the Nazis came in that you can\u2019t --",
        "A: Oh yeah, sure. Oh yeah, yeah, you know that from people, yeah. And I know there was some\nguys and I think was a brother from Joe\u2019s mother, and nobody had contact with him, and he was\n-- you could not trust him, I know. He went to people\u2019s house and threatened them, and took\nthings from them, yeah.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. [indecipherable]. Once he tried, but he had no luck.",
        "Q: And did Joe do some resistance work as well --",
        "A: No, h --",
        "Q: -- as trying to get you food?",
        "A: What he did, that was still when he was working. He took I.D.s from people that worked\nthere, and hid them someplace and gave them to other people, Jewish people.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I know different people he gave them to, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Did you work for the resistance at all, or --",
        "A: No, I could not --",
        "Q: -- you couldn\u2019t.",
        "A: -- no. You could not do that. It di -- if they caught you for that, you know --",
        "Q: Then you were finished.",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: No, we had enough to do with the food and all, and --",
        "Q: It must have been difficult just trying to survive in those circumstances.",
        "A: Yeah. And you had no coals, you had nothing, no heat.",
        "Q: So it was c --",
        "A: So he -- so he went to the park and cut some trees.",
        "Q: He cut so --",
        "A: That was not nec -- was not allowed, yeah. And cut the root and put it in there, so we had that.\nWe could not complain. And a lot of people got food from [indecipherable], you know, and it\nwas so bad, and we got it, but we gave it to somebody. We didn\u2019t want to eat that.",
        "Q: And where did you -- where did he put the wood? Did you have a wood burning stove in the\napartment, or what?",
        "A: Oh yeah, we had an old stove, with the pipe.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hm. And put --",

        "A: Oh yeah.",

        "A: Yes, yeah. I still had it -- oh, when the second daughter was born we still had that.",
        "Q: You were in that apartment?",
        "A: No, I lived someplace else, but we still had that [indecipherable]",
        "Q: That same --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: That same stove?",
        "A: Yeah. But then we had coals, of course, yeah, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Right, right, right. The winter of 1944 was a terrible winter in -- in Holland, wasn\u2019t it?",

        "A: Yeah, it was bad, mm-hm. Yeah.",
        "Q: How bad was it?",
        "A: Well, snow and ice. But otherwise, I don\u2019t know. It was really cold, I know that.",
        "Q: And was food hard to get?",
        "A: Oh, there was no food in the stores, or so, no, no.",

        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: And then you could get some food. And he got one for me too, someplace. So -- well there\nwas not much food anyway, but -- and then, before the war was over, I think, on America, they\nsent on the Red Cross, they sent food over. And then everybody who had a ration card, you could\nget some.",
        "Q: Did you lose a lot of weight?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t?",
        "A: I stayed always the same.",
        "Q: You stayed the same.",

        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: If it was real meat or dog meat, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Did you ever get sick?",
        "A: No, I was very lucky.",
        "Q: No? You didn't get sick --",
        "A: Joe in the end, cause of his nerves, he had a little breakdown. When I went outside to see the\nsoldiers come in --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- and he could not, mm-hm.",
        "Q: And what was that like when you saw the soldiers come in, when that was the liberation --",
        "A: Pretty good.",
        "Q: -- it was pretty good, huh?",
        "A: Yeah, great.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. That\u2019s what I say, people should not forget that, what the Americans did.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you -- when the war was over did you try to look for your parents? Did you think that\nmaybe they were alive, or did you think that they were gone?",

And she was -- yeah, she was\nthe -- really the only one. And then my mother\u2019s sister, who was rich, she came out of hiding\nwith her husband, and so I had her. That was the only family we had.",
        "Q: So it was a very difficult time then --",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: -- when liberation came --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- cause in the end --",

        "Q: -- you can\u2019t go back to -- to what you were.",
        "A: Oh no. Mm-hm. And Joe couldn\u2019t find a job of nothing. So what he did -- my father had the\ntextile license and he took that and he bought textile and he st -- was standing on the market with\ntextile, to make some money. Well, you only could buy it on ration cards, you know?\n[indecipherable] by points. Like a handkerchief would be five points and a towel would be 10\npoints, something like that, you know?",
        "Q: So, to be th-these textiles he had to --",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah.",
        "Q: -- use the ration cards?",
        "A: Yeah. It was not easy after the war, mm-hm.",

        "A: \u00b044.",
        "Q: \u00b044.",
        "A: The first. And then I got the other one about three and half years later, mm-hm. And we\nmoved from that apartment where we lived during the war, and somebody, an uncle from Joe\nlived in a nice house, first floor. And was too much money for him, so we -- you couldn\u2019t get a\nhouse of a rent or anything, so we exchanged. That you could do. So he went to that apartment,\nwe came in his house.

And after a couple of months the teacher says, she\u2019s one of the smartest in the\nclass. She was very smart. But they -- they don\u2019t need somebody to talk in their own language.

He was so happy he screamed\nand screamed when he saw me. And -- and that was it. But what I did, was a good thing I did get\nthe key from the apartment.

        "A: I know different people he gave them to, mm-hm.",
        "A: No, I could not --",
        "A: -- no. You could not do that. It di -- if they caught you for that, you know --",

And was too much money for him, so we -- you couldn\u2019t get a\nhouse of a rent or anything, so we exchanged. That you could do. So he went to that apartment,\nwe came in his house.

Next time he was in the back of --\nin the front, and they took the back. He was lucky like that. But that\u2019s about all I heard. People\ndidn\u2019t talk much about it.",
        "A: When? After war?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember that any more. I heard from the American soldiers that came in, you\nknow, what they saw, and I saw that sometimes one television. [indecipherable] we didn\u2019t have a\ntelevision. Was no televisions --",
