        "Question: Now today, I\u2019m speaking with Juergen Simonson in a town called Ibthorpe in\nEngland. The date is the 28th of March, 1998. And Mr. Simonson is a minister and I\u2019m going to\nlet him talk about what got him to this country, where he lived, where he was born and I will\nstart now. Mist -- in this country, you\u2019re called mister, even thought you\u2019re ordained, is that\nright?",
        "Answer: Yes. That\u2019s correct, yes.",
        "Q: Would you be kind enough to give your name in there and tell me where you were born and\nwhere you lived as a young child and how you got to this country.",
        "A: My name is J-Juergen Simonson. I come from Germany. My father was a judge in Germany.\nHis parents had been Jewish and then converted to the Christian faith in the last century. But,\nunder Nazi laws we\u2019re regarded as Jews and so was my father, who was married to an Aryan,\nand so I was considered a mishling -- a 50 percent Jew or Aryan, whichever way you take it. We\nwere in a small town in east Germany, where my father was working as a judge and then when\nHitler came in, in \u201833 -- he was dismissed as judge in 1935 and lived in -- in this small town\ncalled Forst, until 1938. But because life was more difficult for somebody with a Jewish\nbackground in a small place, where everybody knew you, they were beginning to look for a\nmove to a bigger place, where they might be more anonymous.",
        "Q: Do you have memories of that period?",
        "A: Oh, yes, yes.",
        "Q: What are your memories of that period?",
        "A: My memories are that I went to this -- to this school in small town as second grade school and\nmy main and most painful memory is that -- well, I noticed that for some time, my school friends\ndistanced themselves from me. I used to walk with them to school and then there came a time\nwhen they said they wouldn\u2019t want to walk with me any more.",
        "Q: And you were how old?",
        "A: I was then -- 1938 -- 14 years old. Born in 1924. And one day, after break, I went back to my\nclassroom and there on the notice board, written with chalk, it said, \u201cThe -- the Juda mus game.\u201d\nThe Jew must be out. Which of course was awful sh-shock to me. So -- my class teacher was\nvery embarrassed about it. I left immediately. My parents had gone to Dresden -- because my\nfather\u2019s sister lived in Dresden -- to look for somewhere to live, just at that very moment. And I\nwas being looked after by a niece. And in the afternoon, I went to the acting headmaster to see\nwhat I should do and was told that he was resting, he could not see me. I mean -- this, sort of --\nso typical, this lacking the courage of their convictions, didn\u2019t want to be involved. So after the\nweekend, my parents came back, they\u2019d found a flat and within, I think 24 hours, I was on the\ntrain to Dresden. Never looked back again. And --",
        "Q: You felt you\u2019d be safe in Dresden?",
        "A: In Dresden, m-more. And, in fact, my father found a very good school for me, where I was\nadmitted by the headmaster, who knew my background, but was prepared to take me on. And,\nuntil \u201842, I went to that school, had very good school friends and even managed to do my -- take\nmy matric in 1942. Pll come back to that in a moment. I just want to mention that two years ago\nI was back in East Germany, with a Christian group, we were -- we were visiting some churches\nright on the Polish border. And I suddenly realized I was only about 50 miles from Forst, where I\nwas brought up and where I had this [indecipherable].",
        "Q: How do you spell that name?",
        "A: F-o-r-s-t.",
        "Q: Just as it sounds, yes.",
        "A: Yes. And decide to go by train back to Forst. It was a harrowing experience, because the town\nhad been just on the Polish border, had been overrun by the Russians and really looked like a\nvery neglected eastern town. It had been quite a thriving factory place, so -- in -- before \u201833, in\nthe early days of Hitler. And went round the place to identify my school and one or two other\nplaces. Went back to the station, had a few minutes to spare. Went back, waited at the station for\na moment. Walked down station roat and remembered that one of my school friends used to live\nthere and he -- his father had a agricultural place, shop. And I was totally amazed that the place\nwas still there, with the same name, Lishgut. So I walked in, the daughter-in-law was in the shop\nand said, \u201cYes, my father-in-law 1s here, I\u2019ll go call him.\u201d And he was out in the yard, I went out\nand said, \u201cHello, could I speak --\u201d. He didn\u2019t recognize me after 50 years. And I mentioned my\nname. And he looked at me, took my hand and before he said anything else, said, \u201cI\u2019m so very\nsorry for what we did to you. And it\u2019s been always on my mind.\u201d And we --",
        "Q: Did you think he meant what he said?",
        "A: -- and we embraced each other and I said to -- quote, \u201cThat was a long time ago, let\u2019s forget\nabout it.\u201d\u201d And we only had 15 minutes before my train was due, to catch up on 50 years. And\nthen of course we kept in touch by letter afterwards. And w -- he said, \u201cI\u2019m so glad that we\u2019ve\nmet again.\u201d But it was an extraordinary experience. And he died a week ago.",
        "Q: Is that right? Did you keep up with him?",
        "A: SO -- yes, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah, after that.",
        "A: So I was so glad that --",
        "Q: That you\u2019d gone.",
        "A: -- I went to Forst --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- and that we met again by pure chance, really.",
        "Q: Luck, luck.",
        "A: [indecipherable]. And there a sort of reconciliation took place, anyway.",
        "Q: He probably didn\u2019t know what had happened to you, either.",
        "A: No. No idea.",
        "Q: So he must have been so glad to see --",
        "A: No. Didn\u2019t know that I was in England or anywhere.",
        "Q: Yeah. Amazing, that\u2019s amazing.",
        "A: So then, as I say, I took my matric -- matric in \u201842. Because of my Jewish background,\nfortunately I was n-not allowed to be called up to the armed forces. All my school friends were.\nMost of them perished, many on the eastern front. And quite a few were in Stalingrad. And in the\nend, there were only four of them left and we still meet, every other year, in Germany.",
        "Q: Really, really.",
        "A: So I had to do some kind of forced labor -- first in armaments factory in Dresden, on the shop\nfloor and then in the offices.",
        "Q: And where were your parents now, this time?",
        "A: Oh, yes now, my father knew that his life was really in danger, but was very difficult to get\nout. You had to be sponsored by somebody abroad. And as it happened, years before, he had met\na young, English student, in Forst, who was staying with a family of friends in Forst. And my\nfather had written to him. He\u2019d, in the meantime, become a British diplomat and was out in the\nFar East, but came on leave in \u201838, saw this letter and wrote back to say that yes, he was\nprepared to sponsor him. And so in March, \u201839, he left us. With 10 shillings, that was all he was\nallowed to take. And really no -- no job in sight. I mean, as a judge, he really had no chance to\nfind a job in England.",
        "Q: How many siblings did you have?",
        "A: I was the only one. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: You were the only child? So when you say he left us, he left your mother and you?",
        "A: My mother and me, that\u2019s right, yes.",
        "Q: And, do you remember your reaction?",
        "A: Well, of course was a terribly sad moment for all three of us, to be separated and not to know\nwhat was going to happen. Now, I think I will first tell you about my father, perhaps, at this\npoint, because in the sequence of events, that comes next. He came to England, was met by this\nwonderful man, Dudley Cheek, who has since died, who later became an ambassador, British\nambassador. And stayed first with -- he had some distant relatives in London and then stayed\nwith other people, but of course had no prospect of an opening for a job. He had become an\nactive Christian towards the end of his time in Germany. He used to go -- there was an Anglican\nchurch in London, in -- in Dresden, which he used to attend. And there was, in London, an\norganization called the British German Christian Fellowship, with which Bishop Bell was\nassociated. He was the --",
        "Q: The British German Christian Fellowship?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: All right.",
        "A: Of which he, I think, was the chairman.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And father was introduced to him and there were -- 1n his typical way, sort of pulled out all of\nthe stops and eventually, in September \u201839, father was given a case at congregational theological\ncollege in Cambridge. Cherchant College in Cambridge. As a student again. He\u2019d been a judge\nand started again from scratch --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- there, as a -- as a student.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Theological student. And in the meantime, he had also arranged for us to follow him. Again,\nsome kind people had offered accommodation and there was even a place for me at a school near\nCambridge. And we wer-were supposed to follow in September \u201839. September \u201839 of course\nwas too late. We literally missed the boat.",
        "Q: Goodness.",
        "A: By about a week before that.",
        "Q: What -- what did you do?",
        "A: So we went on living in Dresden. My mother was eventually declared a widow, because my\nfather was no longer regarded as being alive or -- for all intents and purposes.",
        "Q: Did you -- she was not Jewish?",
        "A: No, she wasn\u2019t, no.",
        "Q: So therefore, she would have been allowed privileges.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: But you would not have been allowed them, because you were --",
        "A: Yes, but I was partly protected by my mother. I\u2019ve just been going through it all again,\nbecause I\u2019m now writing quite a few notes about the Holocaust in Germany, because the\nHolocaust was not only in Auschwitz and all the other places. Have you come across -- do you\nknow German, or --",
        "Q: No, I don\u2019t speak German.",
        "A: There is a -- there are some diaries by a German professor called -- it -- I'll look it up later --\nwho t -- who was a -- again, a Jew married to an Aryan lady and what they endured in Dresden.\nTh-They -- it was from Dresden, of all places, this diary.",
        "Q: Really? Yeah.",
        "A: And he writes every day, secretly, his diary is about this period. And what they endured 1s just\nunbelievable. In the end, out of 5,000 Jews in Dresden, 60 were still alive at the end of the war.",
        "Q: 5,000 Jews in Dresden, 60 alive at the end of the war.",
        "A: All the others were deported.",
        "Q: All the others were deported.",
        "A: Ta-Taken away.",
        "Q: Let me stop here. I just want to --. What was your -- what was your main fear? You hadn\u2019t\nmade it, you didn\u2019t know whether you\u2019d renite -- reu -- reunited with your father. What -- what\nwere the signs around you that -- that were most frightening?",
        "A: That one really had no idea what the future was going to bring. That one really lived from day\nto day. We lived a relatively normal life, because of my -- thanks to my mother being Aryan.",
        "Q: And how did she protect you? You were -- you yourself were half-Jewish, how did she\nprotect you? Did she not discuss what you were, or did you -- did people know or what? I mean,\nit sounded like it was very evident.",
        "A: Well, fortunately, as a -- I mean Jews from \u201841 on, had to wear the yellow star.",
        "Q: The yellow star, so --",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have to wear that, so --",
        "Q: But how did you get away with that?",
        "A: Because, I -- as a half-Jew or half-Aryan, I didn\u2019t have to, it was only full Jews. This wh-\nwhole crazy legislation of 100 percent and 75 percent and 50 percent. I was 50 percent and so I\ncould not be treated like a normal human being, but on the other hand, I was not treated as a Jew.\nI was sort of in-between.",
        "Q: What -- what did that mean for you, in terms of having friends who were Aryan, who were\nnot Jewish.",
        "A: They -- I mean, looking back on it now, I am absolutely amazed, because I mean, obviously I\nwas, to a certain extent, probably being watched. But they -- they stayed low and treated me as --\njust like a -- very good friends and so I owe a great deal to them. Then, of course, the critical\ntime came in \u201844, when things were pretty desperate, sort of, in the west and in the east. And at\nthis point, mishlings were also being called up, but not into the armed forces, but into the Tut\nOrganization. The Tut Organization was a -- run by one of Hitler\u2019s ministers, to be engaged in\nemergency work, for instance, the building of the Atlantic wall and the repair of bombed railway\nstations, lines and all that sort of thing, in east and west. So we were not soldiers, but we were\nsort of -- in fact, we were regarded as second class citizens. We didn\u2019t wear a uniform, we just\nwore an armband which said, Tut Organization. And we were made -- made up of people with\nmy background, political prisoners and also minor criminals. A queer mixture of people. And\nwhen was it? April \u00b044, I said good-bye to my mother, I did not know what was going to happen\nto her in Dresden. Obviously we had no real contact with my father in England. I didn\u2019t know\nwhere I was going to land up, they didn\u2019t tell us, we were just loaded onto a train in Dresden and\neventually we realized that we were on our way to France. And we\u2019re then sort of detailed to\nwork on railway sites that had been bombed, to repair them -- very often, with time bombs going\nout -- going off at place-places. And that went on til September -- from April \u201844 to September\n\u201844. Mainly in the Paris area. Again, we were subject to quite a few air raids, but survived. And\nthen there were four -- one, two, three, four of us -- five of us, I\u2019m sorry -- who realized that one\nday this train would be dur -- and this was all during the allies invasion. The allies were sort of\nadvancing, we were slowly being withdrawn and we knew that one day we would return to\nGermany and then of course, what was going to happen then? Especially towards the end of the\nwar. We had no idea. So we had determined that if there was the slightest opportunity, we would\njump off the train and try to find the French Resistance movement.",
        "Q: Could you say that a little louder, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Jump off the plane?",
        "A: We jumped off the train.",
        "Q: Train.",
        "A: We would jump off the train and try and find the French Resistance Movement.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And eventually in Se -- one day in September \u201844, we got that opportunity as the train was\nbeing pulled back towards Germany. One evening, the five of us jumped off, disappeared in the\nundergrowth and found some refuge with some French farmers. And we gather that only a day or\ntwo later, the whole train was destroyed by British or American fighters. So, we were --",
        "Q: Why do you think the French farmers would have given you refuge, given --",
        "A: Because we were all part of the French Resistance. And we -- we had said that we -- we\u2019d run\naway and --",
        "Q: Yeah. And they believed you?",
        "A: They believed us, but day or two later, we were being arrested by the official French forces,\nbecause they thought we were German spies.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what I was thinking.",
        "A: And they didn\u2019t quite know what to do with us. We weren\u2019t soldiers. We claimed we were of\nJewish origin. And so, at that time there was sort of complete chaos in France. There were\nrefugees from various countries which had been caught up by the Germans and also run away.\nAnd we were all taken down to the south of France to be repatriated to our various countries, but\nof course, they couldn\u2019t repatriate us. So we were eventually -- the Jews didn\u2019t want us, because\nwe weren\u2019t proper Jews. So we -- there was an organization called Free Germany, which was\nreally a -- a Communist organization, we landed up there. And we were indoctrinated to learn\nabout Stalin and Marx and Lenin and all the rest of it. And that was not a very pleasant time and\nfood was very short in France -- in the south of France at the time and there was no heating,\nterrible winter. But, eventually, I got a job with the American army. And also, about December, I\nmean post communications were [indecipherable] almost non-existent, but I wrote to the Bishop\nof Chichester -- Chichester, because that\u2019s all I knew, in very halting English, \u201cSir, ?\u2019m Juergen\nSimonson, I think you know my father. I would like to go to England and be reunited with him.\u201d\nAnd eventually he got the letter. I got a cable from him to say, \u201cLetter received. I will put you in\ntouch with my -- your father and I\u2019m trying everything with the British Home Office, to get you\na visa to England.\u201d That was still very difficult for a German.",
        "Q: Why did you pick Bishop Bell? What did you know that made you think --",
        "A: Because we had the occasional -- there was a Red Cross letter, that you could write every six\nmonths, with 25 or 50 words, which really said very little. In addition to that, we were extremely\nfortunate that we had friends in Switzerland and we could write to them and they in turn could\nwrite to my father and vice versa. So, very occasionally, we had some news through them and\nthey had mentioned this link with the Bishop of Chichester.",
        "Q: And -- and Bishop Bell by this time, had -- he\u2019d been working in the 30\u2019s -- am I correct --\nwith the German church, trying to --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- initially get them to speak out against Hitler.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, yes.",
        "Q: And then once the war started, of course, their tone changed. I suppose they felt it had to, and\nhe was much more persona non grata --",
        "A: Oh, yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- at this juncture.",
        "A: And of course, he had met Dietrich Vonhuffer.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: In Stockholm and I think in \u201842.",
        "Q: Did he ever talk to you about Vonhuffer? [telephone ringing]",
        "A: Would you like to just switch it off, please?",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: I just --",
        "Q: -- say that he didn\u2019t -- he didn\u2019t talk to you about Vonhuffer.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t talk to me about Dietrich Vonhuffer. But --",
        "Q: So you -- he got you and [indecipherable] your father.",
        "A: So he did manage to get this visa for me, and -- which took some time, but in June \u00b045, I came\nover and really when I arrived at Newhaven, I felt like the Pope, I wanted to touch British so-\nsoil. For the first time, I really felt safe again after -- what?",
        "Q: All those years.",
        "A: Over 10 -- 11 -- 12 -- 12 years. And met my father at Victoria and then sometime later I was\nintroduced to George Bell. I wish I could describe --",
        "Q: Where was your mother? Excuse me, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: She was still in England.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s --",
        "Q: No, you mean in Germany.",
        "A: I-In Germany, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: What was it like seeing your father after all that time?",
        "A: He didn\u2019t recognize me. Because he\u2019d left me when I was a boy of 14. I was a young man of\n21. We -- we\u2019d been separated for seven years. From -- over six years, from March \u201839 to June\n\u201845. It was incredible. And he, in the meantime had become -- been ordained and become an\nAnglican priest.",
        "Q: Did he ever discuss, or did you ever think about the fact that -- that the tradition, the religious\ntradition that had so let your family down -- let his family down, was the one that he joined? Was\nthat a -- was that a -- a -- an issue, or --",
        "A: No, because on the one hand, I seem to remember, when I was still a boy, father was forcibly\nretired, we lived in Forst. There was a church outside Forst where a member of the Confessional\nChurch --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- ministered, who later became a bishop in the German church.",
        "Q: After the war.",
        "A: After the war, yes. So our links were very much with the Confessional Church. And they were\nreally a great encouragement to us, because they were really the only organization in Germany\nthat was left, which offered some kind of resistance to Hitler. And of course, many of their\npastors were arrested and taken to concentration camps.",
        "Q: Yes. You never knew Paul Schneider, did you, the tr --",
        "A: No, but I know the book and his [indecipherable] story, yes.",
        "Q: His son was in Washington, we -- we --",
        "A: Really?",
        "Q: We honored him last fall.",
        "A: Oh, really?",
        "Q: Yes. [indecipherable] his son read something from Frau Schneider, who\u2019s still alive, who had\nhoped -- hoped to come, but could not make the trip.",
        "A: Oh, how amazing.",
        "Q: So it was --",
        "A: I\u2019ve just looked at his book the other da -- the other day.",
        "Q: The very thick one?",
        "A: No, just a little one -- book.",
        "Q: Oh, I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know that. No, I know Claude Foster\u2019s book is the one I have --",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: -- with 900 pages.",
        "A: No, no I don\u2019t know that one, no.",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re with your father, and --",
        "A: So, I -- I mean our experiences of the German church were not as unfavorable as that of\nothers. And also, of course he -- he joined the Anglican church.",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: And that --",
        "Q: Well, where had the Anglican church been in Germany during all this? Where --",
        "A: Well, I mean they were just colonial churches, which catered for the English people --",
        "Q: The English -- the English speaking people in Germany.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s --",
        "Q: The English were there.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: So, there were not -- in other words, there were no Anglican churches in Germany that were\nGerman?",
        "A: No, no. No, no, no, no --",
        "Q: Oh, I see -- I see.",
        "A: -- only -- they only catered for English speaking people.",
        "Q: Well, they were really in a peculiar position, weren\u2019t they?",
        "A: Yes, of course, I mean they just did their job of looking after the -- their English nationals.",
        "Q: And did they leave, most of them, did they --",
        "A: Oh, I would think so.",
        "Q: -- flee to England --",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- when the war came. They\u2019d have to --",
        "A: I would have -- think so --",
        "Q: -- Pd imagine.",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And the Anglican church in [indecipherable] must have come to an end, probably.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. So that was -- that was your tradition. Now, you met George Bell later, 1s that\nright?",
        "A: I met him later, quite a number of times.",
        "Q: What do you remember about him?",
        "A: The most -- I wish I could describe him. The only thing I can describe about him -- that he\nhad the most translucent blue eyes that I\u2019ve ever seen. You really saw through him -- through the\neyes, into his soul. A very fine face. A man who\u2019d obviously stood up and been rejected himself,\nas you probably know. I mean he -- you probably wouldn\u2019t --",
        "Q: Well, I don\u2019t know -- perhaps you could tell us. I know that the bishop -- Bishop Hedlum, I\nbelieve was the Bishop of Gloucester, is that right?",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: I know that Hedlum had written to the Archbishop about Bell and thinking Bell should keep\nquiet, because he was so vociferous against --",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- what Hitler was doing.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: But I don\u2019t know, other than Hedlum, I had a feeling that perhaps Bell was very supported by\nthe British church an-and -- wh-what what was your -- you tell me what you know. I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: It\u2019s more that he spoke up very strongly in the House of Lords, against the bombing of\nGerman cities.",
        "Q: And so he was considered a pacifist --",
        "A: And so --",
        "Q: -- or was he just considered a person who should not have --",
        "A: Who should not have -- have spoken up --",
        "Q: -- took a -- took a position that --",
        "A: And Churchill obviously didn\u2019t take kindly to him. I mean, there\u2019s no doubt, I think,\nnowadays that when Lang retired, that Bell --",
        "Q: Archbishop Lang, we\u2019re talking about --.",
        "A: -- would have -- would have -- yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- the Archbishop of Canterbury. Yes. And that year was what?",
        "A: I think it would have -- most probably \u201842 --",
        "Q: Two.",
        "A: -- that Bell would have become Archbishop of Canterbury, because he was the outstanding\necumenical figure of his time.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: In his place, Temple was made archbishop -- who also made an outstanding archbishop. I\nmean both of them are -- were outstanding figures. Sorry -- no, I\u2019ve got it wrong. It\u2019s the other\nway around. Temple was made archbishop in \u201842.",
        "Q: Yes, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: But sadly died in \u201844, which was a great tragedy. From -- I can\u2019t remember now what his\nillness was. And --",
        "Q: So he didn\u2019t live to the end of the war?",
        "A: No. And in his place, Bell should have been made archbishop.",
        "Q: Oh, I see. Bell shouldn\u2019t have succeeded Lang.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: He should have succeeded Temple.",
        "A: Temple, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And -- and who did succeed Temple, do you remember?",
        "A: Well, it would have been Fisher, I think.",
        "Q: Is that right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So Bell --",
        "A: Remained Bishop of Chichester and played a very important role in the ecumenical scene.",
        "Q: In what way? Do you know [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, he was -- he was one of the -- became one of the chairman of the Royal Council of\nChurches. And was re -- lauseal sponsor for the first assembly of the Royal Council of Churches\nin Amsterdam in 1948, when, for the first time, all the churches were able to come together\nagain. He also made visits to Germany and welcomed German church leaders to England and\nsort of reestablished the contact between the --",
        "Q: With the German church.",
        "A: With the German church.",
        "Q: Which must have been difficult, because he had been so close to them at one time --",
        "A: Mm, that\u2019s right, yes.",
        "Q: -- and then -- there\u2019s a -- a letter in Andrew Chandler\u2019s book about -- I believe it\u2019s Bell\nwriting to Carl Bart and expressing such surprise that Neimuller, from prison, had offered to\ncommand another U-boat. Do you remember that?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: And -- and he writes to Bart and says, \u201cHow could Neimuller have even remotely suggested\nthat he would fight in a war for people with whom he differed on every level?\u201d",
        "A: I know, that\u2019s right. Mm, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And Bart wrote back to Bell and said, \u201c\u201cNeimuller is too much of a German --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and too much of a Lutheran.\u201d",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Now, that\u2019s an interesting statement.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, yes, yes.",
        "Q: How would you interpret Bart\u2019s comment back to Bell?",
        "A: That\u2019s -- Neimuller was -- I suppose, deep down his heart, a patriot, and --",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And that -- that -- that superseded the moral sense of what was happening?",
        "A: Must have done. That\u2019s right. And also, of course, there was a terrible -- I mean this 1s -- was\none of the reasons and I read this again now -- terrible fear in Germany that the Russians, the\nBolshevists as they were called, would overrun Germany. And they would rather be under Hitler,\na -- a --a German Nazi, then under a Russian Bolshevists.",
        "Q: Well, of course, this is the argument that the church used all the time.",
        "A: Hm. That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And the church of -- of -- I mean, both Protestant and Roman Catholic. Certainly that was\nmuch of what I think generated the lack of support from Pius the -- the 12th.",
        "A: Hm. That\u2019s right, oh yes.",
        "Q: Was that -- that fear.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "Q: And -- and because there were some people who were Jewish who were Communists, that\nwas, of course, something that was always ascribed to the Jews, that --",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s all true, yes. Oh, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- that so often as a -- and then created some antagonism there.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: Was your -- were -- when you met Bell, in later years, did he ever talk about his difficulties in\nthe 30\u2019s?",
        "A: No, di-didn\u2019t talk to me, because I was a -- a junior. I really met him partly because I was -- at\nthat time -- looking for a job.",
        "Q: That\u2019s all right. I want to know where we are. I want to -- I\u2019m going to stop this right --\nexcuse me, tell me -- finish by what you were saying. You were looking for a?",
        "A: A -- a job 1-1n the church.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And so was seeking his advice.",
        "Q: Right. Let me just.",

        "Q: -- silence and then we\u2019re just discussing more general things, less the exact events,\nchronological events than some thoughts and opinions, then we\u2019ll get back to some chronological\nevents perhaps, too. I was just asking Mr. Simonson, who\u2019s the Reverend Mr. Simonson, how he\nfelt about the Goldhagen book and how that jibes with his own memories of Germany and -- and\n-- and what were you saying? It was a bit of revelation to you?",
        "A: It was really quite a shock to me, because in the wer -- I mean, he comes to the conclusion\nthat really the whole German people are responsible for what happened and I\u2019m just reflecting on\nthis and putting some of these thoughts on paper. And really, other -- I find very difficult,\nbecause some of my school friends have been very loyal to me and have stood by me. But they\nwere, of course, involved in the war. And --",
        "Q: This is your mother\u2019s family, though, too. I mean, this is your background, also.",
        "A: Oh yes, that\u2019s right, yes.",
        "Q: Did you -- did you sense that growing up? Was your mother\u2019s family ever voicing anything\nthat was that -- were they upset with your mother for marrying someone Jewish?",
        "A: Strangely not, because I think they very much respected my father. And -- I mean they must\nhave been in -- in a great conflict. I wonder what went on in their minds about this.",
        "Q: Did your mother ever talk about it?",
        "A: Not really, no, no. In fact they said very little after the war. I don\u2019t think they -- they could\ntalk about it, was too difficult a subject.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But --",
        "Q: Well, were there -- let me phrase it differently, then. When you were in Dresden, you had\npeople who stood by you, who were kind to you, who were good to you. Were there those who\nwere like the people in the forest, also?",
        "A: Not so much in Dresden, because we moved in a fairly small circle and they were all people\nwho stood by us. So we -- which to some extent sheltered and protected. But you always -- of\ncourse you always lived in fear, that -- I mean tha -- this is the awful thing that comes through in\nthese diaries by Klemperer, that every day they lived in fear that the Gestapo would knock on the\ndoor and call and either beat them or take them away. So one had this sort of --",
        "Q: Did you ever see that?",
        "A: No, the only thing I do remember was in the -- after the Kristallnacht --",
        "Q: 1938, November.",
        "A: 1938, when Jews were driven through the main street, the Praggerstrasser in Dresden, on their\nway to the station to be taken to the concentration camps.",
        "Q: And you actually saw people hoarded?",
        "A: I saw it, yes. And also I -- on the morning after the -- the synagogue was burned down --",
        "Q: In Dresden?",
        "A: I cycled past the synagogue and saw the -- just the sort of remains of it, like.",
        "Q: Did you wonder about whether you might have been caught up in that?",
        "A: Not so much about myself, but I knew that my father would have been caught up in it and I w\n-- but --",
        "Q: But you must have had Jewish friends in Dresden, did you not? Or did you not?",
        "A: Very -- well, very few. No, most of my friends were -- you see, we really -- my father was a\nChristian, was brought up as a Christian.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: So was I.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: And we had very few links with the -- the Jewish community. I mean I\u2019m absolutely shocked\nnow, to read these diaries of a man who lived not very far away from me and I knew nothing of\nwhat went on in those circles. And all these hundreds of people who were deported. The only\nthing that I do know, which sort of affects us more immediately, was that affe -- concerns my\ngrandparents. My -- my father\u2019s father had been one of the senior judges of the central court in\nLeipzig in the central German court in Leipzig. And so they lived in Leipzig, fairly comfortably,\nbecause he had a fairly senior post. Then, eventually, again, I only discovered this the other day,\nthey moved from Leipzig to Dresden -- to Berlin, because Leipzig was declared Judenfrie -- free\nof Jews. So they had to be -- clear out. And they had to move into rented accommodation in\nBerlin, which was allocated to them. And mercifully, my grandfather died there in \u201842. Now,\nwith them lived my aunt, my father\u2019s sister, who was single, who\u2019d always lived at home. And\nseveral times before *39, I think my father had also tried to bring her out to England. And she\nhesitated, because she couldn\u2019t bring herself to leave her parents. And so she was left behind.\nAnd in -- I\u2019ve only just had all the f-file from Berlin, my aunt -- eventually they just lived in two\nrooms in Berlin. My aunt went to the t -- some office to collect her rations for the month, for\nJews. They were treated as Jews, they had to wear the yellow star, of course. And was told that --\nto get herself ready to be deported the following day. And my grandmother who was then 83 or\n84, could not -- could not bear the thought of being left behind, so she decided to go with her\ndaughter to Theresienstadt. Does that name mean anything?",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: Which of course was for the more privileged Jews.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: And -- I mean she would have been deported anyway, later on. And what I found in these\npapers -- this were -- this was all about the disposal of their property and their possessions,\nbecause everything went -- went back automatically to the state.",
        "Q: And what particular branch of the state would have taken that? The Department of Treasury,\nCommerce, do you know?",
        "A: Finance.",
        "Q: Department of Finance.",
        "A: But, through the auspices of the Gestapo. I mean th-that was really --",
        "Q: So Himmler\u2019s --",
        "A: Yes. And so, in March \u201843, they went to Theresienstadt and I think my grandmother must\nhave died fairly soon after that. And I\u2019ve written now -- it\u2019s extraordinary that all this has taken\nso long. I\u2019ve written now to Theresien -- to -- no, to -- to an agency in Prague. They can\u2019t trace\nmy grandmother at all. They\u2019ve given me another address, which I haven\u2019t tried yet. Whether\nthere\u2019s still any -- I mean -- whether anyone knows where she was cremated --",
        "Q: And your father wouldn\u2019t have known any of this --",
        "A: No, no, no, no --",
        "Q: -- because he was in England.",
        "A: Not til after the war. And then my aunt was later on deported. Moved on to Auschwitz and\nprobably gassed immediately.",
        "Q: And you don\u2019t know what happened when they -- either of them were killed?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: Do you -- do you know the Red Cross? Th -- I don\u2019t know who liberated Theresienstadt, so I\ndon\u2019t know who has those records.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Do you know which nation did?",
        "A: I can show you. I can -- Pll look at the [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Well, when we\u2019re through this, let me get --",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- some information from you.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So you went --",
        "A: Su --",
        "Q: -- when did you find this out? In \u201845?",
        "A: Well, we -- no, what happened was that my other aunt in Dresden, my father\u2019s sister, wa-was\nalso married to an Aryan and she was allowed to send monthly food parcels to my grandmother\nin Theresienstadt. And I -- again -- only discovered this now, that all they were allowed to write\nback by way of n -- acknowledgment, was a printed card which said, \u201cParcel received, we are\nwell.\u201d They were not allowed to add any other information. And once that information -- that\nacknowledgment stopped, we knew that they had gone.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So probably after a few months, the -- these -- she must have died and my aunt was then\nmoved on to Auschwitz. The awful thing was that in one of these papers from Berlin, I found\nthat the official document says they were -- my grandmother and my aunt were aukershoben,\nwhich simply means -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a word that you use for cattle transports. They were just shoved\naway. I mean that\u2019s how people treated them. That\u2019s how they were looked at. Not as human\nbeings.",
        "Q: When did your father find out?",
        "A: Well, immediately after the war.",
        "Q: Right after the war he found out what happened to his mother and his sister?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: It\u2019s unbelievable, isn\u2019t it? What -- what a -- a funny sense it must have given you, of having\nbeen able to survive, when your own family was dying. It\u2019s a hard thing to deal with too, isn\u2019t it?",
        "A: That\u2019s right, yes, yes. And again I\u2019ve only just sort of realized that had my father not found\nthis diplomat as a sponsor, he probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to go. He would have had the\nyellow star and what happened to all the other Jews, he would have been deported eventually.\nAnd we would have all moved into -- after some time, all the Jews were moved into Jewish\nquarters, where the Gestapo could kee-keep a close -- watch them. And -- so we would have\nbeen --",
        "Q: This in -- this in Dresden?",
        "A: In Dresden, yes.",
        "Q: In Dresden.",
        "A: So we would have had to move into Jewish quarters.",
        "Q: So there was a ghetto there also?",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s right, yes. And so my father probably would have been -- and I wouldn\u2019t have had\nthe same protection. And also, after -- from \u201842 on, I -- as a mishling now, would no longer be\nallowed to go to a German school. I was extremely lucky, really.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a miracle.",
        "A: And also that I came through all the forced labor in France, and so --",
        "Q: What did you do in the forced labor? You -- you talked a little bit about it earlier.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Can you tell me anything about what that was?",
        "A: Well, we were working on railway stations, just sort of --",
        "Q: Physically building?",
        "A: No, exhuming. Quite a lot of trains were hit by these bombs and German soldiers were sort of\ncovered by the debris and we had to exhume them and take them to the local cemetery to in-inter\nthem and then reinstate the railway stations, that the trains could run through, the convoys to the\nfront. And very often in areas infested by the French resistance movement. So, on the one hand,\nwe had the bombs raining down from the allied forces. We were under the Nazis, who kept a\nclose eye on -- on us and we were also threatened by the French resistance movement, because\nthey saw us as being on the [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Saw you as the enemy of, course.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting how much of your life you spent being two different things.",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s right. Yes.",
        "Q: Goodness. You got to England --",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Yes, oh yes.",
        "Q: So yeah, so he was -- so they would not have played a role.",
        "A: No. Bell --",

        "Q: But your father\u2019s memories of Bell, he\u2019s -- he -- he saved his life, did he -- did he -- perhaps\nthis is the question. Why was Bell what Bell was? Does anybody know? He never talked about\nit.",
        "A: No, no. No idea.",

        "A: Yes, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: But Bell, at a time when the best of the clergy would say, \u201cWell, it\u2019s terrible what\u2019s\nhappening to the Jews, but --\u201d",
        "A: I know.",
        "Q: \u201c-- we don\u2019t really like them, so it\u2019s easy to understand.\u201d",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: You had a Bell, who wasn\u2019t saying any of those things, he was saying we care for these\npeople, we want to help them. But you don\u2019t know why?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: I wonder if Bell ever wrote anything about his feelings at all. Do you remember your father\nmentioning if -- Bell writing at all?",

        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: And the -- oh, I'll talk about that later. When you -- when you were with Bell, did he ask you\nabout your years in Germany? Was he interested in --",
        "A: Oh, of course, yes.",
        "Q: Very much.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: And -- and what could he do after the war? Or let me go back to what he did during the war.\nWe know he went to the House of Lords.",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Well, as a bishop, you could only go the House of Lords.",
        "Q: You could only go the House of -- of the Lords.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: All right.",
        "A: But --",
        "Q: And -- and -- was there -- what was the reception? I mean the bombing, we know the\nbombing --",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- of Dresden and -- and the -- I mean the bombing of the big cities --",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- people were not happy with him. When he went, did he -- did he not plea -- make a plea for\nrefugees, though, too?",
        "A: Yes, but again, I\u2019m amazed -- I\u2019ve just been reading another book, by a -- actually a Polish\nlady, who then lived in Berlin and then became refugee and came to England. And is now\nmarried to one of the labor lords. And she speaks very disparagingly of the British leadership as\nbeing anti-Semitic.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Mm. And of course, several instances where, to her -- I mean she is very outspoken and I\u2019m\nnot sure whether I can trust her judgment, but she believes that there was a great deal of an-anti-\nSemi -- and that even England could have done much more and let in more refugees.",
        "Q: To what degree do you think that the -- the teachings are what -- Jules Ithzak of course has\ncoined that phrase that 1s used so much, teaching of contempt, the 2,000 year history of -- of\nsaying that the Jews were responsible for the death of Jesus, that the Jews were a -- a group that\nhad been really disowned by God, that the covenant had been passed on, the mantle had been\npassed on to Christianity.",
        "A: Mm, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And that degenerate religion and -- and all of those things that -- that were so much a part of\nour Sunday school teaching, our church teaching.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: How much do you think the anti-Judaism played into the anti-Semitism of the church here,\nthe church in Germany -- what -- do you -- you probably don\u2019t have much sense, because you\nweren\u2019t involved with the church --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- in Germany at that time, but -- but picking it up here then, let\u2019s look at it in England.",
        "A: No, even -- I mean, looking back on it, I -- both in Germany and here, I\u2019m sure it hurt quite a\nlot to --",
        "Q: Quite a lot of impact.",
        "A: I think so, yes. And --",
        "Q: Do you ever meet with clergy from Germany? Did you, in -- in those early years, when you\nwere here and -- and did your father have contact with clergy in Germany and -- after the war,\nmuch?",
        "A: He -- some of them, yes.",
        "Q: And -- and, you remember your father talking about there was reaction to the Jewish people\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: No, I we -- unfortunately he\u2019s dead now. I wish I could ask him all these questions now.",
        "Q: Yeah. Of course you do.",
        "A: Too late.",
        "Q: Too late.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You and your work. Tell me a little bit about what you did after the war, when you came here\nand before you became a clergyman yourself. What -- what -- what prompted you to go into\nministry?",
        "A: Because of the experiences a-at the end, 1-1 -- during the forced labor.",
        "Q: Would you explain that a little bit?",
        "A: I especially -- as I told you, I was down in the south of France, working for the American\narmy. And one day a British padre who was a -- a chaplain in the forces, who was also a friend\nof my father\u2019s, they\u2019d been in theological college together -- appeared and said he was also\nlooking after a big, German prisoner of war camp, down in the south of France and didn\u2019t have\nthe language. Could I come and help him? And, of course, I\u2019d never done anything like it,\nbefore. And so I preached my first sermon in a German prisoner of war camp.",
        "Q: Now, are you saying you preached, but you weren\u2019t ordained --",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: -- at this time.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: So what --how did that come about?",
        "A: He just picked me up and --",
        "Q: And said, \u201cI want you to preach\u2019?",
        "A: That\u2019s right, yes.",
        "Q: Well, what did you preach on, do you remember?",
        "A: I preached -- when you\u2019re confirmed in Germany, which 1s a lovely custom, you\u2019re given a\nverse subscripter to -- as a sort of motto for your life.",
        "Q: And what was yours?",
        "A: And my pastor, who obviously knew about my circumstances, gave me John, chapter six,\nverse 68, \u201cLord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.\u201d And that time I did\nnot know where I was going to go.",
        "Q: Going, yeah. Isn\u2019t that amazing.",
        "A: And that was really the only verse I knew. So I preached on that. And of course that was true\nof the German POW\u2019s as well. They were in total chaos. They had no contact with their families\nat home. Their cities had been bombed at home. They were defeated and --",
        "Q: We don\u2019t think much about the young German boys --",
        "A: No, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- who were lost or who were suffering so much.",
        "A: Mm, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Caught -- conscripted and caught up in a war they didn\u2019t understand and didn\u2019t have any\nresponsibility for --",
        "A: Mm, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- and had no choice and -- and well, we frankly hated them.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, yes",
        "Q: Was a -- that was the enemy, and --",
        "A: Mm, that\u2019s right, yes.",
        "Q: And -- and because of what happened with the Gypsies and the handicapped and the Jews and\nmany groups, we focus so much on them, we do forget how much suffering --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And of course it was the second time this had happened in a major scale, so --",
        "A: Mm, that\u2019s right. Oh, yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- find it hard to be so -- I\u2019m sure a voice such as yours would have been a very welcome one\nfor them.",
        "A: So that was really the beginning, that I had sort of began to feel perhaps that --",
        "Q: That you were called.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: Then you were in England. What did you do, originally, when you got there?",
        "A: Well, then I had to do -- immediately after the war, I was the first enemy alien to arrive in\nBritain.",
        "Q: Oh, really?",
        "A: Yes. Mm-hm. Thanks to Bell.",
        "Q: Bishop Bell, right.",
        "A: Mm-hm, that\u2019s right. In June \u201845. Only, oh, less than a month from the end of the war in\nEurope and I had to do some import -- I mean some essential work, so I worked for the -- really\nsome clerical work, a filing clerk in London for a time. Partly also, because I had to retake my\nmatric, because the German matric wasn\u2019t valid. So I had to take a sort of equivalent. And also\nreally more -- to become more fluent in English. And then in \u201848, I went to theological college.",
        "Q: Where?",
        "A: And was again --",
        "Q: Where -- where [indecipherable]",
        "A: In -- near London. In Surrey. And was ordained in \u201852. And my college principal later became\nArchbishop of Canterbury, Donald Coggin. And --",
        "Q: Yeah. And where was your first assignment?",
        "A: First in -- in London, really in a very tough area, 40,000 people in Paddington. And then we\nwondered whether we should go abroad and serve the church overseas. So we were in Nigeria\nfor seven years, in the theological college, teaching.",
        "Q: Good heavens.",
        "A: And then came back to England and I was in two parishes in south London.",
        "Q: N-Now, were you there until you retired?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you have any contact with any Jewish Christian organizations, any organizations of\necumenical nature?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you have any interest in them?",
        "A: Probably -- probably not at the time, because I was so involved in my own work.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: [ve only really so -- I\u2019m catching up now.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I\u2019ve done the Council for Christians and Jews now.",
        "Q: I wonder if that\u2019s -- I\u2019m meeting tomorrow with somebody from that group, with -- with\nDorothy, I\u2019m having lunch with --",
        "A: Well, down in Southhampton?",
        "Q: Yes, I don\u2019t know who it 1s. She says there\u2019s a new -- maybe it\u2019s just in Southhampton --",
        "A: It\u2019s a new [indecipherable] that\u2019s right. That -- that I belong to.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, right.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to have lunch then. So this is a late -- a late in life interest?",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, yes",
        "Q: You\u2019ve got your father\u2019s papers, some of them?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Did your father write any memoir -- he wrote about Bell.",
        "A: Bell certainly must feature in his book very much, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I-PIl show it to you.",
        "Q: But his own experiences, he didn\u2019t write much?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: He did?",
        "A: There\u2019s his whole -- his whole story.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Pll give it to you.",
        "Q: And -- and looking at it today, what would you say about the state of Jewish Christian\nrelations here? Is there a lot of interest and -- for example, the liturgy -- on -- on Good Friday,\nthat whole Holy Week liturgy is so riddled with Johanine text --",
        "A: I know. That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: That make us so uncomfortable --",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- and we\u2019re really working to do something about the reading of those texts, perhaps\nselecting others, in America. Is that true of England, or is there not much of a movement in that\narea?",
        "A: Not a great deal I would have thought. And also I would have thought, there must be still\nquite a lot of latent anti-Semitism about.",
        "Q: Anti-Semitism. Uh-huh. Must be strange --",
        "A: I think if I looked into the hearts of my neighbors here, who are very much establishment and\nconservative, I think, deep down in their hearts -- I mean they wouldn\u2019t express it to me, because\nthey respect me for what I am.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: But I think deep down in their hearts, probably, 1t would be still there.",
        "Q: I would think that would be very upsetting.",
        "A: Yes, but I mean it\u2019s -- it\u2019s --",
        "Q: You live with it.",
        "A: -- such a long history, isn\u2019t 1t?",
        "Q: It\u2019s a long history. It\u2019s a long history.",
        "A: You can\u2019t sort of suddenly snap out of it.",
        "Q: Hm. We\u2019ve had a long time to try and snap out of it, though",
        "A: Hm.",
        "Q: What -- what does this -- the Christian and Jewish organization do to work on this, do you\nknow? I mean, you just joined it, so you probably don\u2019t know a great deal about what they\u2019 re\ndoing.",
        "A: Yes. No, and also I think that it\u2019s only a special interest for some people and it doesn\u2019t really\npenetrate into the heart and soul of --",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: -- the majority.",
        "Q: Would you think that the -- I mean one of the questions that one has to ask, really, is -- is it\npossible to rid Christianity of this anti-Judaism?",
        "A: I know.",
        "Q: I mean, is it? Is it something we\u2019re just going to always have to --",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: -- say is part of us, and if so, is that -- does that -- seems to me the church never lived up to\nthe ideals it set for itself during that period and -- and I -- I -- if we can\u2019t do something to foster a\nchange, then -- then we\u2019ve really got a -- a bit of a crippled tradition here.",
        "A: Mm. Oh yes. But I mean, in the first place, what do you do with the gospels?",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s a problem.",
        "A: Yes. What do you do about, St. John?",
        "Q: Well, of course, what I do, is I don\u2019t preach from St. John --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- and I don\u2019t read St. John --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- I read the -- the others and -- and --",
        "A: No, but -- that\u2019s right -- but I mean --",
        "Q: Or I -- or I put it in it\u2019s te -- context though --",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- I think that\u2019s what you have to ask clergy to do.",
        "A: Yes, yes. So I think depends very much on the way it\u2019s being interpreted by the church today.",
        "Q: And I suppose that really, then, to me, is what the crux of it all was about, that -- that we need\nto get into our seminaries --",
        "A: Mm, that\u2019s right. Here, here.",
        "Q: -- and teach students how to understand those texts.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, yes.",
        "Q: In the sitsinlabin and --",
        "A: Mm, that\u2019s right, yes.",
        "Q: -- and that\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s going to help us in our preaching, is if clergy trained in the\nfuture and I guess my question then 1s -- this is being done in some seminaries in the United\nStates, the Roman Catholic Church is doing it, but do you think it\u2019s being done in this country in\nthe seminaries today?",
        "A: I would doubt it, on the whole. I don\u2019t think it plays a very important --",
        "Q: I mean that\u2019s a -- tho -- there are three -- now four conciliar documents of the Roman Catholic\nchurch that have called for this. So, that has quite an imprimatur.",
        "A: Mm, mm.",
        "Q: And -- and sends a very strong message to the Catholic seminaries -- and I\u2019m a product of a\nCatholic seminary. But I -- it distresses me as a Protestant, that I don\u2019t think this 1s as much a\nconcern in our country --",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: -- in the Protestant seminaries. But if I hear you correctly, you\u2019re saying it\u2019s not really one\nhere.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way in Britain, I -- certainly not as far as I know.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: I think I would have picked it up.",
        "Q: When you talk --",
        "A: I mean what --",
        "Q: Please --",
        "A: -- in-interests me is that now, after 50 years, people are only beginning to address the\nHolocaust.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: I mean in the churches.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: I mean the Pope maping -- making this announcement only a few weeks ago.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The French church, last year I think.",
        "Q: Beautiful statement of the French bishop\u2019s, isn\u2019t it?",
        "A: I know. Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Do you have a copy of that?",
        "A: Yes. Mm. The various other things which only -- why has it taken us all this time to face up to\nit?",
        "Q: I think that\u2019s the question. And I think that\u2019s the question we need to keep asking.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah. What about your fellow clergy? What do you hear from them, anything? Do they -- do\nyou ever discuss it with them.",
        "A: No, [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Who comprises the -- this council of Christians and Jews here? Is it clergy, is it hum -- just --",
        "A: No, it\u2019s --",
        "Q: -- regular lay people?",
        "A: No, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s clergy and laity.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Obviously some very good people, but only -- it\u2019s only very small number of people, a tiny\nminority who are anxious to foster good relationships.",
        "Q: Yeah. Well, it\u2019s -- that must be a disappointment for you.",
        "A: I mean, one who has played an important role is my former principal, who then became\nArchb -- Canterbury, Donald Coggin, who has been one of the presidents of the Council of\nChristian and Jews.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And that\u2019s a -- that\u2019s a nice feeling, isn\u2019t it -- to have it be that.",
        "A: Hm, that\u2019s right, yes. And as -- as you probably know, Stoneberg has just received the\nTempleton prize.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah [inaudible] that. Well, as you look back on those years, knowing now what you\nknow about the church -- I mean one of the things you would not have been probably thinking\nabout so much when you decided to take this route, you wouldn\u2019t have been looking in depth at\nthe role of the church at that time, you were looking at what it said -- what 1t meant to you and\nhow it helped you.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And how you felt it could help others.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What -- and you have no contact with German clergy today, do you, really?",
        "A: Not directly, no -- no.",
        "Q: So you don\u2019t really know what they\u2019re -- what the teaching and preaching is from the seminar\n-- did you ever hear much about Marberg and Tubing and -- I mean, when the Aryan clause came\nin in -- in \u201833, it looks as if there was the acquiescence of all the seminaries, except Marberg\nseemed to be the one that held a little bit to it\u2019s belief.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t know that, hm.",
        "Q: But y -- that was not an iss -- you never discussed these kinds of things?",
        "A: No, no, no, no.",
        "Q: This was not part of your life, was it, at all?",
        "A: No, no -- you see, I was only a young boy, really, when --",
        "Q: You were so young, of course, of course. This was not --",
        "A: -- when [indecipherable] me. So again, I\u2019m only just catching up on things that I should have\nknown long time ago.",
        "Q: Let me go back to your mother. Your mother joined your father in what year?",
        "A: \u00b045,",
        "Q: \u201845 she came here.",
        "A: \u201846, \u201846.",
        "Q: \u201846. Must have been a difficult -- almost more difficult for them.",
        "A: Oh, very difficult",
        "Q: How many years had they been apart then, eight?",
        "A: Well, seven.",
        "Q: Seven years apart.",
        "A: Seven years apart, yes.",
        "Q: So each had learned to live --",
        "A: And she had -- again -- been through the terrible destruction of Ger -- of Dresden. Lost\neverything [inaudible]",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Run for 12 days through the countryside, to --",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, say that again. She ran for 12 days through the --",
        "A: Through the countryside --",
        "Q: Countryside.",
        "A: -- to find somewhere to -- where she could find refuge.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Then she was under the -- in the Russian zone. Tried to escape twice with her parents into\nwest Germany and failed. And then partly through Probst Grueber, of whom you may have\nheard, he was -- he did [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Could you spell that name?",
        "A: G-r-u-e-b-e-r. Probst -- Probst was a German -- he was a senior German clergyman in Berlin.",
        "Q: Grueber.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry. Yes, of course, of course. Well, tell me, go on.",
        "A: And he was instrumental in getting my mother out of the Russian zone to Berlin, into the\nwestern zone.",
        "Q: Pastor Grueber.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes. That was one of the great names, yes.",
        "A: And of course he worked very closely with Bell.",
        "Q: Yes, yes. One of the real shining lights in the church.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Now, how did he get your mother out exactly, though, do you know?",
        "A: Well, I suppose my mother must have sort of appealed to him or written to him and asked for\nhis help.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Or no, again, I\u2019m sure this came through Bell.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Bell --",
        "Q: So you think Bell got in touch with him?",
        "A: -- got in touch with Grueber. \u201cCould you please do something for this lady?\u201d",
        "Q: Yes, yes. Was he doing this with lots of people, do you know?",
        "A: Yes. Oh, yes.",
        "Q: Do you know what happened to him?",

        "A: I mean, there would be something about Grueber in my father\u2019s book, probably. [inaudible]",
        "Q: In your father\u2019s book, yeah. There wo -- wo -- the -- your mother got here, what -- what was\nlife for her then like? Did she speak much English?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: No, I wouldn\u2019t think she would.",
        "A: She -- she was very German and found quite difficult to -- and of course she hadn\u2019t married a\nclergyman.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right. She married a judge.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, yes. And suddenly she found herself the wife of a clergyman. So she found it\nquite -- quite difficult. And she was a -- there\u2019s a picture of her, under the [inaudible]",
        "Q: Pll have to go look at that, yes.",
        "A: Un-under this.",
        "Q: And she probably felt some hostility, did she not? Because she was German? Maybe not.",

        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- it was a miracle. It was an absolute miracle.",

        "A: Father retired at the age of 75. He was the vicar in Hampstead, in London.",
        "Q: Was he?",
        "A: And then he lived til he -- another 25 years and died at the age of hundred -- 101.",

        "A: Again that\u2019s -- again something that I\u2019ve only just realized, how much more they could have\ntalked about it.",

        "A: I think -- I think they found it too difficult.",
        "Q: Just too hard to mention, yeah. Too frightening. What about nightmares, did you ever have\nnightmares as a -- when you got here?",
        "A: Strange enough, no. Because really, the extraordinary thing was that from the moment I\narrived here, I felt at home and I felt relaxed and released and safe and free and it was the\nbeginning of a new life for me. I mean really life, for the first time, without all of these sort of\nfears and pressures that --",

        "A: No, no.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But I wondered how long it took you before you could go back?",
        "A: And strangely I\u2019ve never really had any deep resentment or hatred.",
        "Q: Would you consider yourself unusual in that respect?",
        "A: I would have thought so. Whether this was because the Christian message that really got into\nme and the message of forgiveness, I don\u2019t know. But -- and also because I had good friends in\nGermany who had -- as I said, stood by me and so --",
        "Q: Did you st -- you kept up with them, you said. You\u2019ve kept up with them.",
        "A: We made contact fairl-fairly soon after the war, certainly with one or two of them and then\none or two others followed and I forget now -- I -- I went back, I think first time, 1948 or \u201849,\nwhich was very --",
        "Q: Oh, you went back soon, yes",
        "A: Yes, yes. And really not -- as far as I can remember with many misgivings. But on the other\nhand, I knew that this was my home now.",

        "Q: In what way? Do you know [indecipherable]",

        "Q: Which must have been difficult, because he had been so close to them at one time --",
        "Q: -- and then -- there\u2019s a -- a letter in Andrew Chandler\u2019s book about -- I believe it\u2019s Bell\nwriting to Carl Bart and expressing such surprise that Neimuller, from prison, had offered to\ncommand another U-boat. Do you remember that?",
        "Q: And -- and he writes to Bart and says, \u201cHow could Neimuller have even remotely suggested\nthat he would fight in a war for people with whom he differed on every level?\u201d",

        "Q: -- and too much of a Lutheran.\u201d",
        "Q: Now, that\u2019s an interesting statement.",
        "Q: How would you interpret Bart\u2019s comment back to Bell?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And that -- that -- that superseded the moral sense of what was happening?",
        "Q: Well, of course, this is the argument that the church used all the time.",
        "Q: And the church of -- of -- I mean, both Protestant and Roman Catholic. Certainly that was\nmuch of what I think generated the lack of support from Pius the -- the 12th.",
        "Q: Was that -- that fear.",
        "Q: And -- and because there were some people who were Jewish who were Communists, that\nwas, of course, something that was always ascribed to the Jews, that --",
        "Q: -- that so often as a -- and then created some antagonism there.",
        "Q: Was your -- were -- when you met Bell, in later years, did he ever talk about his difficulties in\nthe 30\u2019s?",
        "Q: That\u2019s all right. I want to know where we are. I want to -- I\u2019m going to stop this right --\nexcuse me, tell me -- finish by what you were saying. You were looking for a?",

        "Q: Right. Let me just.",
        "Q: -- silence and then we\u2019re just discussing more general things, less the exact events,\nchronological events than some thoughts and opinions, then we\u2019ll get back to some chronological\nevents perhaps, too. I was just asking Mr. Simonson, who\u2019s the Reverend Mr. Simonson, how he\nfelt about the Goldhagen book and how that jibes with his own memories of Germany and -- and\n-- and what were you saying? It was a bit of revelation to you?",
        "Q: This is your mother\u2019s family, though, too. I mean, this is your background, also.",
        "Q: Did you -- did you sense that growing up? Was your mother\u2019s family ever voicing anything\nthat was that -- were they upset with your mother for marrying someone Jewish?",
        "Q: Did your mother ever talk about it?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Well, were there -- let me phrase it differently, then. When you were in Dresden, you had\npeople who stood by you, who were kind to you, who were good to you. Were there those who\nwere like the people in the forest, also?",
        "Q: Did you ever see that?",
        "Q: 1938, November.",
        "Q: And you actually saw people hoarded?",
        "Q: In Dresden?",
        "Q: Did you wonder about whether you might have been caught up in that?",

        "Q: B-But you -- and Temple was gone, really, by the time you got here, too, wasn\u2019t he?",

        "Q: Pil -- Pl send it back, but I'd feel better if I could buy one. You don\u2019t think I can purchase\none?",

        "Q: But your father\u2019s memories of Bell, he\u2019s -- he -- he saved his life, did he -- did he -- perhaps\nthis is the question. Why was Bell what Bell was? Does anybody know? He never talked about\nit.",
        "Q: I mean Bell was -- was so rare in his concern for the Jews.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t -- among Christian clergy anywhere. Here -- James Parks, yes.",
        "Q: But Bell, at a time when the best of the clergy would say, \u201cWell, it\u2019s terrible what\u2019s\nhappening to the Jews, but --\u201d",

        "Q: I hope you --",
        "Q: Treasure that, yeah.",
        "Q: And the -- oh, I'll talk about that later. When you -- when you were with Bell, did he ask you\nabout your years in Germany? Was he interested in --",
        "Q: Very much.",

        "Q: Did Bell also go to Parliament to speak at all?",
        "Q: You could only go the House of -- of the Lords.",

        "Q: How much do you think the anti-Judaism played into the anti-Semitism of the church here,\nthe church in Germany -- what -- do you -- you probably don\u2019t have much sense, because you\nweren\u2019t involved with the church --",

        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Would you think that the -- I mean one of the questions that one has to ask, really, is -- is it\npossible to rid Christianity of this anti-Judaism?",

        "Q: -- I read the -- the others and -- and --",
        "Q: Or I -- or I put it in it\u2019s te -- context though --",
        "Q: -- I think that\u2019s what you have to ask clergy to do.",
        "Q: And I suppose that really, then, to me, is what the crux of it all was about, that -- that we need\nto get into our seminaries --",

        "Q: Yeah, yeah [inaudible] that. Well, as you look back on those years, knowing now what you\nknow about the church -- I mean one of the things you would not have been probably thinking\nabout so much when you decided to take this route, you wouldn\u2019t have been looking in depth at\nthe role of the church at that time, you were looking at what it said -- what 1t meant to you and\nhow it helped you.",

        "Q: So you don\u2019t really know what they\u2019re -- what the teaching and preaching is from the seminar\n-- did you ever hear much about Marberg and Tubing and -- I mean, when the Aryan clause came\nin in -- in \u201833, it looks as if there was the acquiescence of all the seminaries, except Marberg\nseemed to be the one that held a little bit to it\u2019s belief.",

        "Q: Yeah. Why do you think that 1s?",

        "Q: Were gone.",
        "Q: Did you yourself hear anti-Semitic remarks those first years you were here?",
        "Q: Not really?",
        "Q: So you were -- you -- you didn\u2019t have that memory or reminder?",
        "Q: And you never wanted to go -- excuse me.",

    "answers": [
        "Answer: Yes. That\u2019s correct, yes.",
        "A: My name is J-Juergen Simonson. I come from Germany. My father was a judge in Germany.\nHis parents had been Jewish and then converted to the Christian faith in the last century. But,\nunder Nazi laws we\u2019re regarded as Jews and so was my father, who was married to an Aryan,\nand so I was considered a mishling -- a 50 percent Jew or Aryan, whichever way you take it. We\nwere in a small town in east Germany, where my father was working as a judge and then when\nHitler came in, in \u201833 -- he was dismissed as judge in 1935 and lived in -- in this small town\ncalled Forst, until 1938. But because life was more difficult for somebody with a Jewish\nbackground in a small place, where everybody knew you, they were beginning to look for a\nmove to a bigger place, where they might be more anonymous.",
        "A: Oh, yes, yes.",
        "A: My memories are that I went to this -- to this school in small town as second grade school and\nmy main and most painful memory is that -- well, I noticed that for some time, my school friends\ndistanced themselves from me. I used to walk with them to school and then there came a time\nwhen they said they wouldn\u2019t want to walk with me any more.",
        "A: I was then -- 1938 -- 14 years old. Born in 1924. And one day, after break, I went back to my\nclassroom and there on the notice board, written with chalk, it said, \u201cThe -- the Juda mus game.\u201d\nThe Jew must be out. Which of course was awful sh-shock to me. So -- my class teacher was\nvery embarrassed about it. I left immediately. My parents had gone to Dresden -- because my\nfather\u2019s sister lived in Dresden -- to look for somewhere to live, just at that very moment. And I\nwas being looked after by a niece. And in the afternoon, I went to the acting headmaster to see\nwhat I should do and was told that he was resting, he could not see me. I mean -- this, sort of --\nso typical, this lacking the courage of their convictions, didn\u2019t want to be involved. So after the\nweekend, my parents came back, they\u2019d found a flat and within, I think 24 hours, I was on the\ntrain to Dresden. Never looked back again. And --",
        "A: In Dresden, m-more. And, in fact, my father found a very good school for me, where I was\nadmitted by the headmaster, who knew my background, but was prepared to take me on. And,\nuntil \u201842, I went to that school, had very good school friends and even managed to do my -- take\nmy matric in 1942. Pll come back to that in a moment. I just want to mention that two years ago\nI was back in East Germany, with a Christian group, we were -- we were visiting some churches\nright on the Polish border. And I suddenly realized I was only about 50 miles from Forst, where I\nwas brought up and where I had this [indecipherable].",
        "A: F-o-r-s-t.",
        "A: Yes. And decide to go by train back to Forst. It was a harrowing experience, because the town\nhad been just on the Polish border, had been overrun by the Russians and really looked like a\nvery neglected eastern town. It had been quite a thriving factory place, so -- in -- before \u201833, in\nthe early days of Hitler. And went round the place to identify my school and one or two other\nplaces. Went back to the station, had a few minutes to spare. Went back, waited at the station for\na moment. Walked down station roat and remembered that one of my school friends used to live\nthere and he -- his father had a agricultural place, shop. And I was totally amazed that the place\nwas still there, with the same name, Lishgut. So I walked in, the daughter-in-law was in the shop\nand said, \u201cYes, my father-in-law 1s here, I\u2019ll go call him.\u201d And he was out in the yard, I went out\nand said, \u201cHello, could I speak --\u201d. He didn\u2019t recognize me after 50 years. And I mentioned my\nname. And he looked at me, took my hand and before he said anything else, said, \u201cI\u2019m so very\nsorry for what we did to you. And it\u2019s been always on my mind.\u201d And we --",
        "A: -- and we embraced each other and I said to -- quote, \u201cThat was a long time ago, let\u2019s forget\nabout it.\u201d\u201d And we only had 15 minutes before my train was due, to catch up on 50 years. And\nthen of course we kept in touch by letter afterwards. And w -- he said, \u201cI\u2019m so glad that we\u2019ve\nmet again.\u201d But it was an extraordinary experience. And he died a week ago.",
        "A: SO -- yes, yes.",
        "A: So I was so glad that --",
        "A: -- I went to Forst --",
        "A: -- and that we met again by pure chance, really.",
        "A: [indecipherable]. And there a sort of reconciliation took place, anyway.",
        "A: No. No idea.",
        "A: No. Didn\u2019t know that I was in England or anywhere.",
        "A: So then, as I say, I took my matric -- matric in \u201842. Because of my Jewish background,\nfortunately I was n-not allowed to be called up to the armed forces. All my school friends were.\nMost of them perished, many on the eastern front. And quite a few were in Stalingrad. And in the\nend, there were only four of them left and we still meet, every other year, in Germany.",
        "A: So I had to do some kind of forced labor -- first in armaments factory in Dresden, on the shop\nfloor and then in the offices.",
        "A: Oh, yes now, my father knew that his life was really in danger, but was very difficult to get\nout. You had to be sponsored by somebody abroad. And as it happened, years before, he had met\na young, English student, in Forst, who was staying with a family of friends in Forst. And my\nfather had written to him. He\u2019d, in the meantime, become a British diplomat and was out in the\nFar East, but came on leave in \u201838, saw this letter and wrote back to say that yes, he was\nprepared to sponsor him. And so in March, \u201839, he left us. With 10 shillings, that was all he was\nallowed to take. And really no -- no job in sight. I mean, as a judge, he really had no chance to\nfind a job in England.",
        "A: I was the only one. [indecipherable]",
        "A: My mother and me, that\u2019s right, yes.",
        "A: Well, of course was a terribly sad moment for all three of us, to be separated and not to know\nwhat was going to happen. Now, I think I will first tell you about my father, perhaps, at this\npoint, because in the sequence of events, that comes next. He came to England, was met by this\nwonderful man, Dudley Cheek, who has since died, who later became an ambassador, British\nambassador. And stayed first with -- he had some distant relatives in London and then stayed\nwith other people, but of course had no prospect of an opening for a job. He had become an\nactive Christian towards the end of his time in Germany. He used to go -- there was an Anglican\nchurch in London, in -- in Dresden, which he used to attend. And there was, in London, an\norganization called the British German Christian Fellowship, with which Bishop Bell was\nassociated. He was the --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Of which he, I think, was the chairman.",
        "A: And father was introduced to him and there were -- 1n his typical way, sort of pulled out all of\nthe stops and eventually, in September \u201839, father was given a case at congregational theological\ncollege in Cambridge. Cherchant College in Cambridge. As a student again. He\u2019d been a judge\nand started again from scratch --",
        "A: -- there, as a -- as a student.",
        "A: Theological student. And in the meantime, he had also arranged for us to follow him. Again,\nsome kind people had offered accommodation and there was even a place for me at a school near\nCambridge. And we wer-were supposed to follow in September \u201839. September \u201839 of course\nwas too late. We literally missed the boat.",
        "A: By about a week before that.",
        "A: So we went on living in Dresden. My mother was eventually declared a widow, because my\nfather was no longer regarded as being alive or -- for all intents and purposes.",
        "A: No, she wasn\u2019t, no.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Yes, but I was partly protected by my mother. I\u2019ve just been going through it all again,\nbecause I\u2019m now writing quite a few notes about the Holocaust in Germany, because the\nHolocaust was not only in Auschwitz and all the other places. Have you come across -- do you\nknow German, or --",
        "A: There is a -- there are some diaries by a German professor called -- it -- I'll look it up later --\nwho t -- who was a -- again, a Jew married to an Aryan lady and what they endured in Dresden.\nTh-They -- it was from Dresden, of all places, this diary.",
        "A: And he writes every day, secretly, his diary is about this period. And what they endured 1s just\nunbelievable. In the end, out of 5,000 Jews in Dresden, 60 were still alive at the end of the war.",
        "A: All the others were deported.",
        "A: Ta-Taken away.",
        "A: That one really had no idea what the future was going to bring. That one really lived from day\nto day. We lived a relatively normal life, because of my -- thanks to my mother being Aryan.",
        "A: Well, fortunately, as a -- I mean Jews from \u201841 on, had to wear the yellow star.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have to wear that, so --",
        "A: Because, I -- as a half-Jew or half-Aryan, I didn\u2019t have to, it was only full Jews. This wh-\nwhole crazy legislation of 100 percent and 75 percent and 50 percent. I was 50 percent and so I\ncould not be treated like a normal human being, but on the other hand, I was not treated as a Jew.\nI was sort of in-between.",
        "A: They -- I mean, looking back on it now, I am absolutely amazed, because I mean, obviously I\nwas, to a certain extent, probably being watched. But they -- they stayed low and treated me as --\njust like a -- very good friends and so I owe a great deal to them. Then, of course, the critical\ntime came in \u201844, when things were pretty desperate, sort of, in the west and in the east. And at\nthis point, mishlings were also being called up, but not into the armed forces, but into the Tut\nOrganization. The Tut Organization was a -- run by one of Hitler\u2019s ministers, to be engaged in\nemergency work, for instance, the building of the Atlantic wall and the repair of bombed railway\nstations, lines and all that sort of thing, in east and west. So we were not soldiers, but we were\nsort of -- in fact, we were regarded as second class citizens. We didn\u2019t wear a uniform, we just\nwore an armband which said, Tut Organization. And we were made -- made up of people with\nmy background, political prisoners and also minor criminals. A queer mixture of people. And\nwhen was it? April \u00b044, I said good-bye to my mother, I did not know what was going to happen\nto her in Dresden. Obviously we had no real contact with my father in England. I didn\u2019t know\nwhere I was going to land up, they didn\u2019t tell us, we were just loaded onto a train in Dresden and\neventually we realized that we were on our way to France. And we\u2019re then sort of detailed to\nwork on railway sites that had been bombed, to repair them -- very often, with time bombs going\nout -- going off at place-places. And that went on til September -- from April \u201844 to September\n\u201844. Mainly in the Paris area. Again, we were subject to quite a few air raids, but survived. And\nthen there were four -- one, two, three, four of us -- five of us, I\u2019m sorry -- who realized that one\nday this train would be dur -- and this was all during the allies invasion. The allies were sort of\nadvancing, we were slowly being withdrawn and we knew that one day we would return to\nGermany and then of course, what was going to happen then? Especially towards the end of the\nwar. We had no idea. So we had determined that if there was the slightest opportunity, we would\njump off the train and try to find the French Resistance movement.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We jumped off the train.",
        "A: We would jump off the train and try and find the French Resistance Movement.",
        "A: And eventually in Se -- one day in September \u201844, we got that opportunity as the train was\nbeing pulled back towards Germany. One evening, the five of us jumped off, disappeared in the\nundergrowth and found some refuge with some French farmers. And we gather that only a day or\ntwo later, the whole train was destroyed by British or American fighters. So, we were --",
        "A: Because we were all part of the French Resistance. And we -- we had said that we -- we\u2019d run\naway and --",
        "A: They believed us, but day or two later, we were being arrested by the official French forces,\nbecause they thought we were German spies.",
        "A: And they didn\u2019t quite know what to do with us. We weren\u2019t soldiers. We claimed we were of\nJewish origin. And so, at that time there was sort of complete chaos in France. There were\nrefugees from various countries which had been caught up by the Germans and also run away.\nAnd we were all taken down to the south of France to be repatriated to our various countries, but\nof course, they couldn\u2019t repatriate us. So we were eventually -- the Jews didn\u2019t want us, because\nwe weren\u2019t proper Jews. So we -- there was an organization called Free Germany, which was\nreally a -- a Communist organization, we landed up there. And we were indoctrinated to learn\nabout Stalin and Marx and Lenin and all the rest of it. And that was not a very pleasant time and\nfood was very short in France -- in the south of France at the time and there was no heating,\nterrible winter. But, eventually, I got a job with the American army. And also, about December, I\nmean post communications were [indecipherable] almost non-existent, but I wrote to the Bishop\nof Chichester -- Chichester, because that\u2019s all I knew, in very halting English, \u201cSir, ?\u2019m Juergen\nSimonson, I think you know my father. I would like to go to England and be reunited with him.\u201d\nAnd eventually he got the letter. I got a cable from him to say, \u201cLetter received. I will put you in\ntouch with my -- your father and I\u2019m trying everything with the British Home Office, to get you\na visa to England.\u201d That was still very difficult for a German.",
        "A: Because we had the occasional -- there was a Red Cross letter, that you could write every six\nmonths, with 25 or 50 words, which really said very little. In addition to that, we were extremely\nfortunate that we had friends in Switzerland and we could write to them and they in turn could\nwrite to my father and vice versa. So, very occasionally, we had some news through them and\nthey had mentioned this link with the Bishop of Chichester.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, yes.",
        "A: Oh, yes, yes.",
        "A: And of course, he had met Dietrich Vonhuffer.",
        "A: In Stockholm and I think in \u201842.",
        "A: Would you like to just switch it off, please?",
        "A: I just --",
        "A: He didn\u2019t talk to me about Dietrich Vonhuffer. But --",
        "A: So he did manage to get this visa for me, and -- which took some time, but in June \u00b045, I came\nover and really when I arrived at Newhaven, I felt like the Pope, I wanted to touch British so-\nsoil. For the first time, I really felt safe again after -- what?",
        "A: Over 10 -- 11 -- 12 -- 12 years. And met my father at Victoria and then sometime later I was\nintroduced to George Bell. I wish I could describe --",
        "A: She was still in England.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s --",
        "A: I-In Germany, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t recognize me. Because he\u2019d left me when I was a boy of 14. I was a young man of\n21. We -- we\u2019d been separated for seven years. From -- over six years, from March \u201839 to June\n\u201845. It was incredible. And he, in the meantime had become -- been ordained and become an\nAnglican priest.",
        "A: No, because on the one hand, I seem to remember, when I was still a boy, father was forcibly\nretired, we lived in Forst. There was a church outside Forst where a member of the Confessional\nChurch --",
        "A: -- ministered, who later became a bishop in the German church.",
        "A: After the war, yes. So our links were very much with the Confessional Church. And they were\nreally a great encouragement to us, because they were really the only organization in Germany\nthat was left, which offered some kind of resistance to Hitler. And of course, many of their\npastors were arrested and taken to concentration camps.",
        "A: No, but I know the book and his [indecipherable] story, yes.",
        "A: Really?",
        "A: Oh, really?",
        "A: Oh, how amazing.",
        "A: I\u2019ve just looked at his book the other da -- the other day.",
        "A: No, just a little one -- book.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: No, no I don\u2019t know that one, no.",
        "A: So, I -- I mean our experiences of the German church were not as unfavorable as that of\nothers. And also, of course he -- he joined the Anglican church.",
        "A: And that --",
        "A: Well, I mean they were just colonial churches, which catered for the English people --",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s --",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: No, no. No, no, no, no --",
        "A: -- only -- they only catered for English speaking people.",
        "A: Yes, of course, I mean they just did their job of looking after the -- their English nationals.",
        "A: Oh, I would think so.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: I would have -- think so --",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: And the Anglican church in [indecipherable] must have come to an end, probably.",
        "A: I met him later, quite a number of times.",
        "A: The most -- I wish I could describe him. The only thing I can describe about him -- that he\nhad the most translucent blue eyes that I\u2019ve ever seen. You really saw through him -- through the\neyes, into his soul. A very fine face. A man who\u2019d obviously stood up and been rejected himself,\nas you probably know. I mean he -- you probably wouldn\u2019t --",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: It\u2019s more that he spoke up very strongly in the House of Lords, against the bombing of\nGerman cities.",
        "A: And so --",
        "A: Who should not have -- have spoken up --",
        "A: And Churchill obviously didn\u2019t take kindly to him. I mean, there\u2019s no doubt, I think,\nnowadays that when Lang retired, that Bell --",
        "A: -- would have -- would have -- yes, yes.",
        "A: I think it would have -- most probably \u201842 --",
        "A: -- that Bell would have become Archbishop of Canterbury, because he was the outstanding\necumenical figure of his time.",
        "A: In his place, Temple was made archbishop -- who also made an outstanding archbishop. I\nmean both of them are -- were outstanding figures. Sorry -- no, I\u2019ve got it wrong. It\u2019s the other\nway around. Temple was made archbishop in \u201842.",
        "A: But sadly died in \u201844, which was a great tragedy. From -- I can\u2019t remember now what his\nillness was. And --",
        "A: No. And in his place, Bell should have been made archbishop.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Temple, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: Well, it would have been Fisher, I think.",

        "A: Must have done. That\u2019s right. And also, of course, there was a terrible -- I mean this 1s -- was\none of the reasons and I read this again now -- terrible fear in Germany that the Russians, the\nBolshevists as they were called, would overrun Germany. And they would rather be under Hitler,\na -- a --a German Nazi, then under a Russian Bolshevists.",
        "A: Hm. That\u2019s right.",

And really, other -- I find very difficult,\nbecause some of my school friends have been very loyal to me and have stood by me. But they\nwere, of course, involved in the war. And --",
        "A: Oh yes, that\u2019s right, yes.",
        "A: Strangely not, because I think they very much respected my father. And -- I mean they must\nhave been in -- in a great conflict. I wonder what went on in their minds about this.",
        "A: Not really, no, no. In fact they said very little after the war. I don\u2019t think they -- they could\ntalk about it, was too difficult a subject.",
        "A: But --",
        "A: Not so much in Dresden, because we moved in a fairly small circle and they were all people\nwho stood by us. So we -- which to some extent sheltered and protected. But you always -- of\ncourse you always lived in fear, that -- I mean tha -- this is the awful thing that comes through in\nthese diaries by Klemperer, that every day they lived in fear that the Gestapo would knock on the\ndoor and call and either beat them or take them away. So one had this sort of --",
        "A: No, the only thing I do remember was in the -- after the Kristallnacht --",
        "A: 1938, when Jews were driven through the main street, the Praggerstrasser in Dresden, on their\nway to the station to be taken to the concentration camps.",
        "A: I saw it, yes. And also I -- on the morning after the -- the synagogue was burned down --",
        "A: I cycled past the synagogue and saw the -- just the sort of remains of it, like.",
        "A: Not so much about myself, but I knew that my father would have been caught up in it and I w\n-- but --",
        "A: Very -- well, very few. No, most of my friends were -- you see, we really -- my father was a\nChristian, was brought up as a Christian.",
        "A: So was I.",
        "A: And we had very few links with the -- the Jewish community. I mean I\u2019m absolutely shocked\nnow, to read these diaries of a man who lived not very far away from me and I knew nothing of\nwhat went on in those circles. And all these hundreds of people who were deported. The only\nthing that I do know, which sort of affects us more immediately, was that affe -- concerns my\ngrandparents. My -- my father\u2019s father had been one of the senior judges of the central court in\nLeipzig in the central German court in Leipzig. And so they lived in Leipzig, fairly comfortably,\nbecause he had a fairly senior post. Then, eventually, again, I only discovered this the other day,\nthey moved from Leipzig to Dresden -- to Berlin, because Leipzig was declared Judenfrie -- free\nof Jews. So they had to be -- clear out. And they had to move into rented accommodation in\nBerlin, which was allocated to them. And mercifully, my grandfather died there in \u201842. Now,\nwith them lived my aunt, my father\u2019s sister, who was single, who\u2019d always lived at home. And\nseveral times before *39, I think my father had also tried to bring her out to England. And she\nhesitated, because she couldn\u2019t bring herself to leave her parents. And so she was left behind.\nAnd in -- I\u2019ve only just had all the f-file from Berlin, my aunt -- eventually they just lived in two\nrooms in Berlin. My aunt went to the t -- some office to collect her rations for the month, for\nJews. They were treated as Jews, they had to wear the yellow star, of course. And was told that --\nto get herself ready to be deported the following day. And my grandmother who was then 83 or\n84, could not -- could not bear the thought of being left behind, so she decided to go with her\ndaughter to Theresienstadt. Does that name mean anything?",
        "A: Which of course was for the more privileged Jews.",
        "A: And -- I mean she would have been deported anyway, later on. And what I found in these\npapers -- this were -- this was all about the disposal of their property and their possessions,\nbecause everything went -- went back automatically to the state.",
        "A: Finance.",
        "A: But, through the auspices of the Gestapo. I mean th-that was really --",
        "A: Yes. And so, in March \u201843, they went to Theresienstadt and I think my grandmother must\nhave died fairly soon after that. And I\u2019ve written now -- it\u2019s extraordinary that all this has taken\nso long. I\u2019ve written now to Theresien -- to -- no, to -- to an agency in Prague. They can\u2019t trace\nmy grandmother at all. They\u2019ve given me another address, which I haven\u2019t tried yet. Whether\nthere\u2019s still any -- I mean -- whether anyone knows where she was cremated --",
        "A: No, no, no, no --",
        "A: Not til after the war. And then my aunt was later on deported. Moved on to Auschwitz and\nprobably gassed immediately.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I can show you. I can -- Pll look at the [indecipherable]",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Su --",
        "A: Well, we -- no, what happened was that my other aunt in Dresden, my father\u2019s sister, wa-was\nalso married to an Aryan and she was allowed to send monthly food parcels to my grandmother\nin Theresienstadt. And I -- again -- only discovered this now, that all they were allowed to write\nback by way of n -- acknowledgment, was a printed card which said, \u201cParcel received, we are\nwell.\u201d They were not allowed to add any other information. And once that information -- that\nacknowledgment stopped, we knew that they had gone.",
        "A: So probably after a few months, the -- these -- she must have died and my aunt was then\nmoved on to Auschwitz. The awful thing was that in one of these papers from Berlin, I found\nthat the official document says they were -- my grandmother and my aunt were aukershoben,\nwhich simply means -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a word that you use for cattle transports. They were just shoved\naway. I mean that\u2019s how people treated them. That\u2019s how they were looked at. Not as human\nbeings.",
        "A: Well, immediately after the war.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, yes, yes. And again I\u2019ve only just sort of realized that had my father not found\nthis diplomat as a sponsor, he probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to go. He would have had the\nyellow star and what happened to all the other Jews, he would have been deported eventually.\nAnd we would have all moved into -- after some time, all the Jews were moved into Jewish\nquarters, where the Gestapo could kee-keep a close -- watch them. And -- so we would have\nbeen --",
        "A: In Dresden, yes.",
        "A: So we would have had to move into Jewish quarters.",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s right, yes. And so my father probably would have been -- and I wouldn\u2019t have had\nthe same protection. And also, after -- from \u201842 on, I -- as a mishling now, would no longer be\nallowed to go to a German school. I was extremely lucky, really.",
        "A: And also that I came through all the forced labor in France, and so --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, we were working on railway stations, just sort of --",
        "A: No, exhuming. Quite a lot of trains were hit by these bombs and German soldiers were sort of\ncovered by the debris and we had to exhume them and take them to the local cemetery to in-inter\nthem and then reinstate the railway stations, that the trains could run through, the convoys to the\nfront. And very often in areas infested by the French resistance movement. So, on the one hand,\nwe had the bombs raining down from the allied forces. We were under the Nazis, who kept a\nclose eye on -- on us and we were also threatened by the French resistance movement, because\nthey saw us as being on the [indecipherable]",

        "A: No, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: Mm, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: Mm, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, yes",
        "A: Mm, that\u2019s right, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Mm, that\u2019s right. Oh, yes, yes.",
        "A: So that was really the beginning, that I had sort of began to feel perhaps that --",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: Well, then I had to do -- immediately after the war, I was the first enemy alien to arrive in\nBritain.",
        "A: Yes. Mm-hm. Thanks to Bell.",
        "A: Mm-hm, that\u2019s right. In June \u201845. Only, oh, less than a month from the end of the war in\nEurope and I had to do some import -- I mean some essential work, so I worked for the -- really\nsome clerical work, a filing clerk in London for a time. Partly also, because I had to retake my\nmatric, because the German matric wasn\u2019t valid. So I had to take a sort of equivalent. And also\nreally more -- to become more fluent in English. And then in \u201848, I went to theological college.",
        "A: And was again --",
        "A: In -- near London. In Surrey. And was ordained in \u201852. And my college principal later became\nArchbishop of Canterbury, Donald Coggin. And --",
        "A: First in -- in London, really in a very tough area, 40,000 people in Paddington. And then we\nwondered whether we should go abroad and serve the church overseas. So we were in Nigeria\nfor seven years, in the theological college, teaching.",
        "A: And then came back to England and I was in two parishes in south London.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Probably -- probably not at the time, because I was so involved in my own work.",
        "A: [ve only really so -- I\u2019m catching up now.",
        "A: I\u2019ve done the Council for Christians and Jews now.",
        "A: Well, down in Southhampton?",
        "A: It\u2019s a new [indecipherable] that\u2019s right. That -- that I belong to.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh, right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Yes, yes",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Bell certainly must feature in his book very much, yes, yes.",
        "A: I-PIl show it to you.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: There\u2019s his whole -- his whole story.",
        "A: Pll give it to you.",
        "A: I know. That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Not a great deal I would have thought. And also I would have thought, there must be still\nquite a lot of latent anti-Semitism about.",
        "A: I think if I looked into the hearts of my neighbors here, who are very much establishment and\nconservative, I think, deep down in their hearts -- I mean they wouldn\u2019t express it to me, because\nthey respect me for what I am.",
        "A: But I think deep down in their hearts, probably, 1t would be still there.",
        "A: Yes, but I mean it\u2019s -- it\u2019s --",
        "A: -- such a long history, isn\u2019t 1t?",
        "A: You can\u2019t sort of suddenly snap out of it.",
        "A: Hm.",
        "A: Yes. No, and also I think that it\u2019s only a special interest for some people and it doesn\u2019t really\npenetrate into the heart and soul of --",
        "A: -- the majority.",
        "A: I know.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: Mm. Oh yes. But I mean, in the first place, what do you do with the gospels?",
        "A: Yes. What do you do about, St. John?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, but -- that\u2019s right -- but I mean --",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: Yes, yes. So I think depends very much on the way it\u2019s being interpreted by the church today.",
        "A: Mm, that\u2019s right. Here, here.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, yes.",
        "A: Mm, that\u2019s right, yes.",
        "A: I would doubt it, on the whole. I don\u2019t think it plays a very important --",
        "A: Mm, mm.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way in Britain, I -- certainly not as far as I know.",
        "A: I think I would have picked it up.",
        "A: I mean what --",
        "A: -- in-interests me is that now, after 50 years, people are only beginning to address the\nHolocaust.",
        "A: I mean in the churches.",
        "A: I mean the Pope maping -- making this announcement only a few weeks ago.",
        "A: The French church, last year I think.",
        "A: I know. Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes. Mm. The various other things which only -- why has it taken us all this time to face up to\nit?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, it\u2019s --",
        "A: No, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s clergy and laity.",
        "A: Obviously some very good people, but only -- it\u2019s only very small number of people, a tiny\nminority who are anxious to foster good relationships.",
        "A: I mean, one who has played an important role is my former principal, who then became\nArchb -- Canterbury, Donald Coggin, who has been one of the presidents of the Council of\nChristian and Jews.",
        "A: Hm, that\u2019s right, yes. And as -- as you probably know, Stoneberg has just received the\nTempleton prize.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Not directly, no -- no.",

        "A: No, no -- you see, I was only a young boy, really, when --",

        "A: Well, seven.",
        "A: Seven years apart, yes.",
        "A: And she had -- again -- been through the terrible destruction of Ger -- of Dresden. Lost\neverything [inaudible]",
        "A: Run for 12 days through the countryside, to --",
        "A: Through the countryside --",
        "A: -- to find somewhere to -- where she could find refuge.",
        "A: Then she was under the -- in the Russian zone. Tried to escape twice with her parents into\nwest Germany and failed. And then partly through Probst Grueber, of whom you may have\nheard, he was -- he did [indecipherable]",
        "A: G-r-u-e-b-e-r. Probst -- Probst was a German -- he was a senior German clergyman in Berlin.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And he was instrumental in getting my mother out of the Russian zone to Berlin, into the\nwestern zone.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And of course he worked very closely with Bell.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, yes, yes.",
        "A: Well, I suppose my mother must have sort of appealed to him or written to him and asked for\nhis help.",
        "A: Or no, again, I\u2019m sure this came through Bell.",
        "A: Bell --",
        "A: -- got in touch with Grueber. \u201cCould you please do something for this lady?\u201d",
        "A: Yes. Oh, yes.",
        "A: No, I -- I -- I\u2019m not sure, no. No, I don\u2019t think I can tell you.",
        "A: I mean, there would be something about Grueber in my father\u2019s book, probably. [inaudible]",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: She -- she was very German and found quite difficult to -- and of course she hadn\u2019t married a\nclergyman.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, yes. And suddenly she found herself the wife of a clergyman. So she found it\nquite -- quite difficult. And she was a -- there\u2019s a picture of her, under the [inaudible]",
        "A: Un-under this.",
        "A: I think she was so delighted to be reunited with my father and with me. And for all three of us\nto come together again, I mean --",
        "A: -- it was a miracle. It was an absolute miracle.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Father retired at the age of 75. He was the vicar in Hampstead, in London.",
        "A: And then he lived til he -- another 25 years and died at the age of hundred -- 101.",
        "A: She died a little earlier, she was 88.",
        "A: Yes, oh yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. But I mean, considering what they\u2019d been through, it\u2019s amazing that they lasted\nso long.",
        "A: Mm, yes.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Again that\u2019s -- again something that I\u2019ve only just realized, how much more they could have\ntalked about it.",
        "A: I think -- I think they found it too difficult.",
        "A: Strange enough, no. Because really, the extraordinary thing was that from the moment I\narrived here, I felt at home and I felt relaxed and released and safe and free and it was the\nbeginning of a new life for me.

        "A: I would have thought so. Whether this was because the Christian message that really got into\nme and the message of forgiveness, I don\u2019t know. But -- and also because I had good friends in\nGermany who had -- as I said, stood by me and so --",
