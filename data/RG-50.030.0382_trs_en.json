        "Question: I would like you to begin by asking both of you to state your date of birth, where were",
        "BZ: | Answer: My name is Belle Mayer Zeck. I was born in Port Henry, New York, on Lake\nChamplain. When I was about six years old, my family moved to Suffern, New York, here in\nRockland County. So I went all through the public schools in Suffern, attended Syracuse University\nand graduated from Fordham Law school in 1940.",
        "Q: Bill?\nWZ: Tam William Allen Zeck, born March 3rd, 1915. I grew up on 110th Street between Fifth\nand Lennox Avenue, at the north end of Central Park. I attended grammar school,\nTownsend-Harris Hall High School, New York University in University Heights, and the\nNew York University Law School, from which I graduated from in June of 1936, and I have\nbeen a lawyer all of these years since then.",
        "Q: I want you to talk a little bit about your family background and sort of values that you grew\nup with. And also perhaps tell me a bit about why you decided to become a lawyer.\nBZ: Well, my parents were both immigrants \u2014 both came to this country, my father slightly\nbefore the turn of the century, my mother at the turn of the century. They were married here\nand my father was an upstate dairy farmer, but my parents had four children and one\ncouldn't make a living. For four children doing dairy farming, if you know anything about\nthe upstate New York or Vermont dairy farmers, they are very poor people. And so he came\nto Suffern and went into business, but always had a farm. I was the youngest, my eldest\nsibling was a lawyer and perhaps that unconsciously had some influence on my going to law\nschool. I was also a child of the Depression and it was quite clear, 1t was made quite clear to\nall of us that we had to earn a living when we got out of school. It was all right to go to\ncollege, but it had to be a purposive venture. And I was told that I couldn't be an actress. I\nwas also told I had no talent whatsoever as a teacher, so I kind of backed into the law,\nseemed to be all that was left for me.",
        "Q: Isn't that sort of unusual though, for a woman of that time to go into law?\nBZ: _ It was, it was. There weren't many women who went into law at that time, it was still a\nman's field, I suppose it still is today. But actually, I came along just at the right time because two\nyears after I graduated we were at war and all of the men, all of the lawyers, were being drafted. I\nthink they were the first ones being drafted, so that not only was I welcome in Washington, I and\nother women lawyers, what few there were, we were rather sought-after. Of course after the war\nwas over and we returned to our private lives, everything went back to the old, to the old order and\nwomen were not sought-after and women could not get jobs for which their training and experience\nhad equipped them very well during those years of World War Two.",
        "Q: Any particular challenges that you underwent in terms of law and law school in those early\nyears?\nBZ: In my early years I can't remember any other than money, and I certainly was not\nimpoverished in the sense that I was helped a great deal with scholarship money towards tuition.\nAnd there were always people around me to see that I didn't starve. But things were very tight for\neverybody.",
        "Q: Anything in particular you want to add about your family or your values, the way you were\nraised, that might have prepared you a little bit for the rather challenging work ahead of you?\nBZ: No, except that the work ethic was very strong in our house. I mean we always had chores,\nfar more onerous than our children or our grandchildren. And aside from the work ethic, I can't\nthink of much. The first thing I heard about Germany, as I recall, was in high school. My father used\nto read the papers and he had family in Hungary. It was then \u2014 it had become Czechoslovakia\nduring World War One, but he had family and he was deeply concerned, as were most of the people\nwe knew, deeply concerned about Hitler. My mother had no family in Europe so that it didn't hit her\nquite as deeply as it hit my father, but she too was very concerned about what was happening to the\nJews in Europe. I can't say it was a daily topic of conversation. It was not until I got to Washington\nthat I became very immersed in Germany and in the war.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s just, I guess, ask Bill similar questions\u2014\nWZ: My parents also emigrated, they from Russia in the year 1900. Not together \u2014 they met over\nhere. My father got to live the United States, as he put it, just in time to understand that President\nWilliam McKinley was assassinated shortly after he got here. My father was in the coffee and tea\nbusiness. He used to import green coffee, blend it, roast it, package it, sell it both at wholesale and\nretail. The same also with tea. Not roasting or \u2014 but he would blend tea and sell tea, largely to retail\ncustomers. Our coffee roaster, at 110th Street, between Park and Madison Avenue, constantly\nspewed forth, every 20 minutes, a blast of wonderfully smelling coffee, which dispersed in the air,\nand it was the best advertising he could possibly do. It would spread over a period of about five\nblocks. We children were myself and two sisters. Belle talked about the discipline of hard work and\nthat was very much our discipline. If I had to specify an objective of my parents, both of them felt\nthat their three children, regardless of gender, should receive as much education as they could\nabsorb. So that \u2014 I told you about my college degrees; my older sister was a graduate of NYU at\nWashington Square. My youngest sister graduated from Hunter College and also got a Master\u2019s\nDegree in addition to her Bachelor\u2019s Degree. As far as the family beliefs are concerned, which I\ncertainly think was impounded into me, and it was the business of honesty, integrity. My mother\ntook care of all of the things she felt that she wanted in her children. My father wanted to be sure\nthat all of the family bills were paid, regularly paid, paid on time. I think things that kept him awake\nat night, if at all, other than possibly health factors, was getting his bills paid. And this was a very\nimportant discipline and challenge because we too went through the Depression years. During those\nyears I entered college at 19 in 1930 and graduated college and law school in 1936, but I worked\nregularly each day with my father in his business because he needed the help, so that this was the\nbasic influence, I think, that probably has carried me through this eighth or ninth decade of my life,\nwhichever it is. And the business of honesty and straight talking and integrity is something that I\nhave always looked for and felt and tried to practice, even in the business of politics, 1f you will.",
        "Q: [Technical conversation: Let me \u2014 you know what Bill? One thing I suggest \u2014 you're\ngripping your shirtsleeve here. |\nWZ:  I'msorry.",
        "Q: [Technical conversation: You're driving him crazy because he thought it was his\nmicrophone. You can't do that, that would be very helpful. |\nWZ: Ok.",
        "Q: Perhaps you can tell me what you knew about what was happening in Europe.\nWZ: In Germany? Well, I did enter college in 1930, and Hitler was beginning to scratch around\nand make his presence felt in one fashion or another in 1931 and '32. Hindenberg! was in\ncharge at government, Hitler was pushing in that direction. I didn't know too much about the\npre-1930 period, during Hitler's Munich and post-Munich, because it wasn't part of any of\nmy studies, and I was very much involved both with the work I did at home and with my\ngreat desire to play shortstop for the New York Yankees and also be a member of the United\nStates Davis Cup tennis team, you see. But once we got into the college level in our history\ncourses and our political science courses, we knew what was happening in Germany, and it\nwas neither pleasant nor pleasurable; but actually, we didn't regard it as a great threat until in\nthe middle '30s we began to realize that the Hitler program was a definite threat to the Jews\nof Germany and when we began to realize also in the middle '30s his appetite for spreading\npan-Germanism, we began to be very unhappy about what was happening in Germany.\n' Paul von Hindenburg (1847-1934), President of the Weimar Republic.\nBelle, as she told you, had some family left in Hungary. As far as I knew, none of my\nfather's family \u2014 he was the youngest child \u2014 came here in 1900, so we didn't have any\nfamily that I knew of in Europe and we didn't have that to concern us. My music was very\nimportant in our home. Under duress I studied the violin for six years. Both my sisters\nplayed the piano. My mother had a lovely singing voice and we did a good deal of singing\nand so forth. Music's been very important to us. My father used to buy numbers of \u2014 he\nloved the Italian tenors, particularly Caruso,\u201d and he loved some beautiful tenors who were\ncantors. We had all kinds of music in the house during that period.",
        "Q: Actually, you bring up something that I guess I didn\u2019t ask Belle about. Was religion\nimportant in your family?\nWZ: Religion? Yes, my parents were Conservative Jews. During my school years I would go to\ngrammar school from nine until three. I would come home at three, I would have a snack and from\nfour to five I would play the violin, with my mother glaring at me to see that I was giving her a full\nhour, except for five minutes she allowed me to go to the bathroom. At six o'clock I went to Hebrew\nschool, the Harlem Hebrew Institute at 111th Street between Lexington and Park Avenue, and I\nspent two hours there each day. So that this was a full day of education for kids of that era and\neducation was the principally important thing in raising children of those years. I was Bar\nMitzvahed at the usual age, and gradually after Bar Mitzvah I worked my way out from under both\nthe violin and Hebrew instruction. I was finished with all of that. But we had in those terms with a\npretty full Hebrew education. As a matter of fact, I can probably sit here and write Yiddish while\nyou speak English, writing Yiddish and translating as we go along. But I'm sure the scratching of\nthe pen would bother the gentleman out there.\n? Enrique Caruso (1873-1921), Italian tenor.",
        "Q: So you \u2014 did the fact that you knew Yiddish or some German help you later on?\nWZ: Yes, yes. As a matter of fact, I had five years of French. French was the language we all\nstudied then, but I had a year of German in college and between the German and the English, I\nmanaged to get along in Nuremberg. Not if I was interrogating a witness, not without the presence\nof an interpreter, a translator, but I do understand a good deal of the language, yeah.",
        "Q: And I'd like to pick up with what you were doing in Washington. You said that after law\nschool you went to Washington?\nBZ: \u2014 Well, two years after I graduated from law school, I went to work in the General Counsel's\nOffice of the United States Treasury and the General Counsel, then Randolf Poll(ph),\nassigned me to a fairly new bureau called Foreign Funds Control. It was in charge of\nadministering the Trading With the Enemy act. And that act, of course, as you know,\nforbade all communications, transmittals, remittances \u2014 any dealing whatsoever \u2014 with\nGermany. Then, as Germany successively occupied Austria, Poland, Scandinavia, the\nBenelux countries, and France, with each invasion the Trading With the Enemy act was\nextended to that country, so that by 1941, before I got to the Treasury, all of Europe and\nBritain was fairly well \u2014 it was insulated to the extent that we could insulate them, to the\nextent that we could prevent Hitler from getting any use of Germany's external assets. Those\nexternal assets, I may tell you, were mainly held by I.G. Farben, the giant chemical\ncompany which had offices and factories all over the world \u2014 certainly in every major\ncapital of the world \u2014 and I. G. was, they were consummate artists at camouflaging their\nholdings. They had had a bad experience in the first World War where several assets which\nthey had in this country had been vested by the Alien Property Custodian. So beginning as\nearly as 1936, they made a \u2014 they began a concerted effort to transfer out any holdings\nwhich they had here into the names of nominees who would cloak their assets for them. I\nwas, in the course of my work at Foreign Funds, I was assigned to the investigation of\nGerman assets in this country, specifically General Analine and Film, which was, I think,\ntheir largest holding in this country.\nBut they had so many other participations and holdings in so many companies, I won't recite\nthem all. And then they, if they didn't own three nominees, through Americans, through\nSwiss, if they didn't own controlling or majority interest in companies, they had\narrangements with American companies such as Standard Oil of New Jersey. And they\nformed new corporations with nominees for their half interests and with the other half being\nheld by the American company, mainly Standard Oil. I started to say that it was \u2014 that where\nthey didn't have a direct or indirect participation \u2014 they had cartel arrangements with some\nof the leading companies in this country which permitted them the use of patents in Europe\nand, of course, in the first instance it was difficult to prove, as I said, because of all these\ncloaking arrangements, pooling agreements, option agreements, and these sophisticated\nfinancial devices. It was difficult to prove ownership. Once we did though \u2014 and this was\nslightly before the Alien Property Custodian's office was established in the Justice\nDepartment \u2014 once the Treasury felt it had a very strong case and once it had penetrated\nthese layers and layers of nominees and cloaks, then the property was vested initially in the\nTreasury and then the Alien Property Custodian would do the vest and foreign funds control,\nwhich would just continue to freeze assets wherever we could show that they were\nbeneficially controlled by the Germans. [end of side 1, tape 1]",
        "Q: [Technical conversation: Ok, I want to get her frame a little tighter please... Yeah that\nworks good, you look great.] You were talking about collecting information on I. G. Farben 's\nassets. How did you go about that?\nBZ: Well, Treasury had, to begin with, lists of known German concerns in this country, possibly\nnot just from World War One, but from the ordinary sources, ordinary commercial sources\nand of course, it became more a matter not of identifying the company, but of proving that it\nwas German because by then they had been transferring shares. I mean, we knew the\nGeneral Analine and Film had once been a German company, but now these shares were in\nthe hands of Swiss nominees and the management was American.\nBZ: We sent investigators into these companies and examined their stock books, their transfer\nbooks, their books of account, and then we investigated the nominal share holders of the\ncompany. In the case of General Analine and Film, we found very useful memorandum\nwhen the army occupied Germany and Bernstein's cartel in finance division went into the\nFarben administration building and brought back to Washington documents that I will tell\nyou about in a moment. We found a memorandum from von Knieriem\u2019, the general council\nof I. G., to the members of the Vorstand* \u2014 that is, the managing board of directors of the\ncompany \u2014 outlining specifically, precisely what they were going to do to cloak their\nAmerican holdings in the United States. And as I said before they used very diverse means,\nvery intricate fiscal stratagems and combinations of stratagems. But we had teams of\ninvestigators \u2014 this is before we learned so much from the investigators \u2014 on the ground in\nGermany. We had teams of investigators at the Treasury who were out in the field\ninvestigating in the banks, investigating banking transactions involving the Germans and\ncompanies and factories all over.",
        "Q: And you personally were doing what?\nBZ: \u2014 I personally supervised the investigation of I.G. Farben's largest firm in this country,\nGeneral Analine and Film, and I wrote the investigative report, with our conclusions.",
        "Q: [Technical conversation: What is that? I'm hearing feedback. I don't know whether it's\naffecting anything. Okay, that's probably all it was. I'm sorry. |\nBZ: Well, that's it.",
        "Q: Do you want to, just sort of continue on with your experiences?\nBZ: \u2014 Then, well, take for example this investigative report. It would go from the General Counsel\nto others in the Treasury and they either would vest the company or they would ask the\n3 August von Knieriem, member of Central Committee of Farben\u2019s Board of Directors.\n* Board of directors (German).\nJustice Department, the Alien Property Custodian to vest it. But much \u2014 and then after\nabout, towards the end of '42, the Justice Department started its own investigations. They\nhad investigating teams in the field, too, because, of course, they were preparing for trial and\nthat required much finer tuning than our investigative reports represented. Then a former\nAssistant Secretary of the Treasury, Bernard Bernstein, who was drafted in 1942, became\nEisenhower's \u2014 General Eisenhower's financial aide in North Africa and in addition to his\nduties in North Africa, he tried to find out everybody in the North African theater who had\nTreasury experience or banking experience, because he was already paving the way for our\noccupation of Germany. He then sent us a telegram, well we didn't have telegrams, we had\nwhat we call TWXs,\u00b0 where the Pentagon would summon you to a TWX conference and\nBernstein would be on the other end of the Telex \u2014 it was more comparable to that. They\ncalled it TWX and he would ask me, in this particular instance, he asked me to send him the\nnames of likely personnel for his operation, which I did in conjunction with help from the\nCivil Affairs Division of the War Department. These men, when we did occupy Germany,\nthey went into mainly the Farben administration building in Frankfurt, that was in the\nAmerican zone, and they just took every document that was visible or that they could find in\nany cabinet. They put them in gunnysacks, they brought them back to the United States to\nthe Treasury, and on the basis of those \u2014 and then there was intensive work on the\ndocuments, because some related to war crimes, some didn't. Some related \u2014 were of great\nconcern to the Senate committee investigating wartime production and the conduct of our\nown businesses during the Hitler period, vis-a-vis their German counterparts.\n> Telegraphic message, interchangeable with Telex. Jennifer Mossman, ed., /nitialisms\nand Abbreviations Dictionary (Detroit: Gale Research Inc., 1992), s.v. \u201cTWX.\u201d\nSo that all of this did culminate in a way in the reports I discussed with you which\nrepresented the testtmony of Colonel Bernstein and Major General Hildering(ph), the head\nof Civil Affairs, before the Senate committees in December of 1944. And hundreds of these\ndocuments were annexed in a separate volume to the main report. The main report being a\nPart Seven of the Senate subcommittee hearings and the exhibits in Part 10.",
        "Q: Maybe you can tell me what the Senate hearings were, because I don't know how these\nworked. You don\u2019t need to show me papers, I just want you to explain to me that involvement.\nBZ: They were investigating our mobilization for war, directed by Senator Harley Kilgore\u00ae of\nWest Virginia. As a matter of fact I think the hearings were called \u201cMobilization for War.\u201d\nThey were also investigating the extent to which American industry helped, contributed to\nHitler's war machine, before and during the war. The Treasury also, of necessity, had to do\ninvestigations in South America because it was through South America, through Buenos\nAires, largely, and Ecuador and, well, I said Argentina and Rio, that a lot of trans-shipments\nwere made. Goods which originated in the United States were sent to South America,\nostensibly to non-German firms, which in turn sold them to German subsidiaries in South\nAmerica and they were trans-shipped back to the continent. Does that give you an idea?",
        "Q: So you were helping the Senate committee to learn more about the German industry and its\noperations?\n\u00b0 Harley Martin Kilgore (1893-1956).\nBZ: \u2014 That's right, that's right. And also helping the division of cartels and the finance division of\nmilitary government in Germany.",
        "Q: It's my understanding that, at this time, under the direction of Eisenhower, there was a big\neffort underway to try to get a handle on companies, like I. G. Farben so that\u2014\nBZ: Yes.",
        "Q: The process of war\u2014\nBZ: Yes, in the early stages of the occupation, there was a concerted effort at decartelization,\nwhich was breaking up these huge, these mammoth industries which had really had its roots\nin every country of Europe, and to a certain extent they were successful. After Nuremberg,\nmaybe Bill will talk later about the Clemency Commission, but Krupp\u2019 was not only put\nback together again, but they were given all their assets back. Farben was, I. G. Farben was\nbroken up.\nWZ: There was a special decartelization branch in OMGUS,\u2019 in the Office of Military\nGovernment in Berlin, and they did a great deal of investigative work and I think a great\ndeal of work under General Clay\u2019 to break up the German cartels. I did some work,\ntangentially of what Belle's describing, in Washington with the Board of Economic Warfare.\nI was in the General Counsel's office there for several months before I went into the army.\nAnd some of the work I did related to Lend Lease, I was a member of our interdepartmental\nland lease committee. And one of the things Belle just mentioned, relating to the trans-\nshipment of American goods into South America, we were sending, under land lease, goods\n\u2019 Krupp, after industrialist Gustav Krupp and his son and heir Alfred Krupp von Bohlen\nund Halbach (1907-1967).\n\u2019 Office of Military Government, United States\n* General Lucius D. Clay\nto England. And England was trans-shipping some of our land lease goods \u2014 intended for\nthem and for the war effort \u2014 trans-shipping them to South America to protect their markets.\nAnd quietly a fuss was raised about it by us, and I'm sure the land lease department and\nfinally the foreign officer \u2014 what was his name, Belle \u2014 issued a white paper out of London,\ndiscontinuing the practice and explaining that practice. I did some related work at BEW'\u201d as\nwell, in connection with the seizure of patents. I was assigned the business of writing an\nexecutive order for President Roosevelt, directing the seizure of enemy owned patents,\npursuant to the Trading With the Enemy act, which you mentioned. Also there, I worked on\nestablishing the curriculum for the school for military government. This was in the early\ndays of the war, but there would be a time when we were going to be the occupying power\nand so we established a school at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, indicating the\nprocesses and the tactics and the legalities of the work that we would be performing as an\noccupying power. If, God-willing, we got to that point, you know. And also I knew, with not\nthe great amount of detail that Belle did, about I. G. Farben, whose influence concerned not\nonly the Treasury Department but the antitrust division of the Department of Justice \u2014 our\nagency as well. Because I think it was very plain that as the war was developing or\u2014\n[interrupted by ringing telephone].\n' Board of Economic Welfare",
        "Q: Whenever you're ready. OK, Bill, you were?\nBZ: \u2014 Bill was talking about these cartels and I'd like to say a word about this. Cartels are not\nbusinesses, they're arrangements or agreements which divide up markets, fix prices, control\nproduction. The way this is done is through the use of patents. Now, Standard Oil of New\nJersey is a good example. It had had long-standing alliances with I. G. Farben, which went\nback to World War One, and they not only had these cartel arrangements but they had joint\nownership of about 10 companies in this country other than General Analine and Film,\nwhich I mentioned. In the \u201820s, Standard Oil agreed to give I. G. Farben the patents and\ndistribution rights for the production of synthetic gasoline. They were way ahead in terms of\nresearch, way ahead of I. G. Farben. In return, they were \u2014 and the right to the European\nmarket, where synthetic gasoline was badly needed. In return, they were supposed to get not\nonly the patents for the development of synthetic rubber, but they were supposed to get\nwhatever know-how I. G. Farben had in the production of synthetic rubber. All of our\nrubber came from Malaysia, 90 percent of it, and when the Japs attacked, the Japanese\nattacked us at Pearl Harbor, we found our rubber markets cut off completely. In the\nmeantime \u2014 and the perniciousness of these cartels becomes apparent when you realize that\nfrom, oh, the middle '20s, to as late as 1938, Standard Oil kept pressing Farben to give them\nthose patents and to give them what know-how they had, because whenever our own rubber\ncompanies, Goodyear and Firestone for example, tried to do research in producing synthetic\nrubber, Standard Oil would say to them, \u201cOh, now, don't spend the money. We have this in\nthe bag, we're going to get them; it's just that they're having a little trouble with Hitler.\u201d\nWell, we never did get them, but in the meantime in 1936, when all these preparations for\nwar were being made by I. G. Farben in conjunction with the German Wehrmacht,'! the\nFarben people filed thousands of applications for patents with the United States Patent\nOffice on their own. And of course they were accepted. Every single combination of\nelements known, they would file a patent on just to be sure that no one else could touch any\none of the fields in which they wanted to be pre-eminent. So we had critical shortages, we\nhad shortages in tungsten and in carbides and 1n nitrates and ironically, completely aside\nfrom the synthetic rubber deal, a lot of this critical war material was being shipped to South\nAmerica for eventual transmittal to Germany. I. G. Farben, I really don't like the fact that we\nalways identify it as a chemicals concern. Everybody knows of its size, but I don't think\npeople know how far afield Farben was from say, pharmaceuticals. For example, all during\nthe '30s, Farben produced 90% of the gun powder, and certainly during the war they\nproduced 95% of the explosives that were used by the German army.\nThere isn't a single bomb that could have been launched without the I. G. Farben explosives.\nThey made the treads for the tanks, they were in synthetics; there wasn't, I can't think really\nof a piece of equipment, of armament to which Farben had not contributed a vital part. So\nthat Hitler could not have possibly waged war without them because all Germany had was\ncoal and I. G. Farben's chemists, who Joe DuBois!\u201d who was the head of the Farben trial\nteam, called the devil's chemist,!\u2019 which they could not translate. They could take the coal\nand mix it with water and air and make all of these synthetics. So that \u2014 and what they could\n'! Armed Forces (German).\n'2 Josiah DuBois, Jr., Deputy Chief Counsel for the United States.\n'5 The interviewee is referring to DuBois\u2019s book The Devil\u2019s Chemists.\nnot make, because they were Germany's largest source of foreign exchange and hard\ncurrencies, namely dollars and Swiss francs, they got from their far flung enterprises. They\nknew what, the I. G. Farben people knew what Hitler was all about. They were responsible\nfor his rise to power. They attended a meeting in, at the invitation of Goering'* and\nKrauch,!\u00b0 one of the defendants.\nThey attended a meeting at Goering's house in February of 1933, early 1933. That is a very\nsignificant meeting; Flick'\u00ae and Krupp were there too. It's a significant meeting because just\nbefore that, just a few months before, the Nazis had been badly beaten in the elections. Then\ncame this meeting and Hitler spoke at great length, I have the translation here; it's not a very\ngood translation either, but Hitler spoke for well over an hour, two hours and in it he\noutlined very clearly his plans for Germany. He said that Germany's destiny was\ninextricably intertwined with that of a strong man. He went further, he said that it was only\nthrough military conquest that Germany had ever been great, led by a strong man. He talked\na little about \u2014 for Hitler half an hour was little \u2014 he talked about the threat of communism,\nand of course that was the big bogie man for German industry as it has been for industry\neverywhere. And he magnified the communist threat enormously. In fact later, when the\nNazis burned down the Reichstag,'\u2019 they blamed it on some poor homeless man who they\nclaimed he set the fire. He was a mentally incompetent, but they claimed it was a communist\n'4 Hermann Goering (1893-1946); Commander-in-Chief of Luftwaffe, President of\nReichstag, Hitler\u2019s designated successor.\n'S Carl Krauch (1887-1968), Nazi Military Economy Leader and professor of chemistry.\n'6 Friedrich Flick (1883-1972), industrialist and Nazi supporter.\n'7 Parliament (German).\nplot to burn down the Reichstag, all of which history proved to be incorrect. However, back\nto the meeting. The \u2014 I. G.

However, one of our judges said,\n\u201cWell, we have fund raising for our people, too. There's nothing wrong with politicians and\nfund raising.\u201d However, after that meeting, Farben directors approached Hitler to find out\nwhat his attitude was towards their experiments with synthetic gasoline and synthetic rubber\nand when Hitler said that it was indispensable to his future plans and gave them the go\nahead, they then, the Farben directors, persuaded von Hindenburg to resign and made Hitler\nChancellor of Germany.",
        "Q: Tape change.\nEnd of Tape One\nTape Two\nBZ: [Td like to go back to what I was talking about.",
        "Q: [Referring to interviewee\u2019s eyeglasses] So, let\u2019s see you put them\u2014take them off?\nBZ: _ I'd like to go back there. I was talking about what Farben had done in the way of stockpiling\nfor Hitler and critical war material, about their supplying him with foreign exchange to buy\nthat which he didn't have or couldn't produce in Germany, but all and also to show its\nworldwide influence, but it still didn't impress one of our judges who was reported to have\nsaid that he couldn't see the difference between I. G. Farben and our own Dupont. Well, we\nwere not\u2014incidentally, I could have told him the difference between I. G. Farben and\nDupont. I could have told him the difference between German industry and American\nindustry because German industry was his enthusiastic partner for a decade before he ever\nstarted his wars, whereas in the United States, even after Pearl Harbor, Franklin Roosevelt\nhad to bribe our businesses to convert to war production by way of tax breaks and tax\nincentives. To get back, we felt that we had to show the size of I. G. Farben and demonstrate\nits worldwide influence for the purpose of indicating what a necessary partner they were to\nthe entire Nazi enterprise, and I would just like to quote a few, two short sentences from\nTelford Taylor,'\u00ae who was our chief counsel of the subsequent proceedings. From the\nopening of the Flick case \u2014 Flick was the coal baron \u2014 he said, \u201cAt the threshold of this case\nand because of its unusual character, it is vital that these principles be clearly understood.\n'8 Telford Taylor (1908-), American Chief of Counsel for War Crimes at Nuremberg.\nThe defendants were powerful and wealthy men of history \u2014 of industry\u2019? \u2014 (pardon me),\nbut that is not their crime. We do not seek here to reform the economic structure of the\nworld or to raise the standard of living. We seek rather, to confirm and revitalize the\nordinary standards of human behavior embodied in the law of nations.\u201d So I think if you\nhave any more questions, this was I. G. Farben preparing for war. Then there came a point\nwhen I. G. Farben decided to build its fourth synthetic rubber plant at Auschwitz. They did\nit because of the availability of cheap labor in the form of concentration camp inmates. It is\nestimated that in the construction of this enormous plant, in the construction alone, 25,000\nworkers died. These workers were very, very badly treated and the plant was run with the\nhelp of the SS. In other words, there were SS guards in every part of the factory. Not only\nthat, but the SS brought the concentration camp inmates from Auschwitz to the factory\nevery day and I. G. Farben gave them receipts. They paid them, they paid the SS a dollar per\nman, a dollar a day, 75 cents for a woman and 50 cents for a healthy child, the child that\ncould work. Then the SS complained that 1t was too dangerous to move these people over\nsuch a long road, that there was a danger that they could escape, no matter how many guards\nthey put on. So Farben, in conjunction with the SS, recommended that Birkenau be built. It\nwas closer to Auschwitz proper and they built the crematorium, the gas chambers and the\ncrematorium right into the building so that after the inmates, and there were French and\nBelgian and Gypsies there, so that after they were gassed, their bodies could be disposed of\nimmediately in the ovens. That's why Birkenau has always been referred to as the four\n'\u00b0 Tt should be clear that the interviewee corrected herself and meant to quote the word\n\u201cindustry\u201d and not \u201chistory.\u201d\nchimneys or five chimneys of Auschwitz. In fact it was the title of the book by Olga\nLengyel.\u201d\u00b0\nBut to get back to the slave labor operation, the longest sentence meted out on the slave\nlabor count was seven years and another defendant got four years and two other defendants\ngot two years, which was the one part of the decision that I could not rationalize in any way,\nshape, or form. It was just a very arbitrary thing and then of course, all of the sentences were\ncommuted by McCloy\u2019s Clemency Commission, which Bill may want to talk about later.",
        "Q: Now let\u2019s go back a little bit now, because you\u2019re now talking about sentences and I don't\neven know how you got there.\nBZ: \u2014 I'm sorry.",
        "Q: That's okay. I know that prior to your going to Nuremberg you also, you went to London, is\nthat right?\nBZ: Yes, yes, in 1944, 1945, I went to London as US Treasury representative in London and my\nassignment was to work on the legislation which the occupying forces would enact in Germany, if\nand when they established an occupation government in Germany. And I had worked on that to\nsome extent in interdepartmental committees in Washington and then it became an intergovernment\nthing in London.",
        "Q: Can you tell me anything?\nBZ: \u2014 At that time, the commission, which had been set up by the \u2014 well, the London agreement\nwas being promulgated, in which the Allied powers dedicated themselves to the punishment\n0 The book mentioned by the interviewee is called Five Chimneys.\nof war criminals, and they were also drafting the charter, pursuant to which the trials were\nconducted. And I did not participate in that but I was very aware of their proceedings and\nwould from time to time report to the treasury about it, in the diplomatic pouch.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you want to say about the legislation that you were involved in, in\nterms of the occupation?\nBZ: Well, we \u2014 of course the first thing that the office of military government did was abolish all\nthe discriminatory legislation, the Nuremberg laws of 1936 and various other German laws which\ndeclared various acts to be criminal, such as intermarriage, such as even ordinary social intercourse\nwith Aryans was prohibited. And of course they were not allowed to practice, Jews and other\nundesirables, were not permitted to practice their professions, their own businesses and so forth, and\nwe drafted legislation which would annul all this terrible legislation.",
        "Q: You know it must have been pretty heady stuff to have been involved 1n this.\nBZ: _ It was very heady for a 27 year old girl, yes.\nWZ: You were not 27 when you went to London in 1945.\nBZ: \u2014 I was 26.",
        "Q: This was big stuff. What were you thinking?\nWZ: Sure, it was big stuff for a girl, too. There weren't many of those.\nBZ: _ It was very heady stuff. You felt that you were doing something of such vital importance\nthat the well-being of the world, you know, was interwoven with your work. At some points I felt\nthat I was carrying the entire war effort on my own shoulders, you know.",
        "Q: It must have been stressful and interesting.\nBZ: \u2014 Oh, very. Oh, very.",
        "Q: And as a woman, as a young woman, were you welcome? Were you treated differently?\nBZ: Well, by and large I was treated very well. The State Department in Washington was always\nvery supercilious. These hyphenated names, you know, who were very supercilious people, but I\nthink that they were nasty to everybody, not just women and they\u2014\nWZ: \u2014 Still are.\nBZ: And it was a matter of degree. I'm sure that women were on a lower totem pole than men,\nbut there were certain men that came in for their disapproval also. Now the British, both in\nWashington and in London, were also inclined to be very supercilious, and they would argue a word\nin a proclamation or an ordinance. They would\u2014sorry \u2014 they would argue it to death I mean,\nwhether business should be called a concern or a corporation or an entity, and it would just go on for\nhours. Of course, I was young and very impatient and we would lock horns and they would make\nunpleasant remarks about my youth, my impatience, my gender, my origins. That was \u2014 I don't\nthink 1t was exclusively because \u2014 I don't think it was exclusively a female-male thing. Like the\nState Department, I think that the British were generally very supercilious. They didn't realize that\nthey were bankrupt, you know, and that they should treat people better.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t ever feel at a disadvantage or you didn\u2019t have more difficulty as a result of being\na young woman\u2019?\nBZ: Well, I had difficulty getting a passport to go to London in the first place. But the Secretary\nof the Treasury, who was having his own battles with the State Department, really didn't know me\nat all, decided to make it a cause c\u00e9lebre, the State Department couldn't tell him who to send to\nLondon, or anywhere else, and he prevailed. There weren't, in retrospect, there weren't difficulties.\nThose, what difficulties I had as a result of gender, religion, perhaps age, I had after the war; I had\nafter the war when I tried to get a job at Chase Bank in their foreign exchange, foreign trade section\nand I couldn't even get an interview.",
        "Q: Let's go back and talk to Bill for a minute about how you came to all of this. After you were\nwith the Lend-Lease Commission, what you were doing?\nWZ: After I finished my military service, in January of 1946, I guess, I knew about the\nNuremberg trials. I had been in uniform as an aide-de-camp to General Don E. Scott(ph)\nwhen the requisition came through for military people interested in going to Nuremberg.\nBecause we were just before the end of the war, the General said to me, \u201cBill, if you want to\ngo to Nuremberg, I will let you go now. I will report you.\u201d And I said, \u201cGeneral, I want to\ngo to Nuremberg, but I want to get out of the uniform first,\u201d because I'd been away from\nhome for six years and so it took a few extra months. When I did get out as a civilian, the\nonly job I was interested in getting was a job in Nuremberg. I went to the Pentagon, I met\nTelford Taylor, who was still a colonel there and beginning to recruit for subsequent\nproceedings, subsequent trials. And I was promptly hired and went over there in March of\n1946.",
        "Q: Why were you so eager to go to Nuremberg?\nWZ: I was eager to go to Nuremberg because \u2014 and not only eager to go to Nuremberg, but eager\nto work on an I. G. Farben trial, because I'd had contact with it in my work at the Board of\nEconomic Welfare before I got into the Army. I was \u2014 I think being Jewish certainly had\nsomething to do with my eagerness to go there and since I had really been out for well over\nsomewhere between four and six years, I had no law practice to go back to and I was\ninterested in going to federal government again, and this seemed the place to do it and to do,\nbe part of the prosecution. So I went over there and what I found there was a few quick\nobservations I made. All of the people working on the IMT case \u2014 and just to set the time for\nit, this was the end of March of 1946 and the IMT trial ended in September of 1946. The\npeople working on the prosecution staff were virtually all in uniform, either Army or Air\nForce or Navy. The people who worked subsequent proceedings were all, excuse me,\nformer military people now in civilian mufti. And I went over with the first group of lawyers\nhired for subsequent proceedings and there were 12 of us on the ship which interestingly\nwas called the General Taylor, but apparently it wasn't named after Telford Taylor. When I\nreceived a call to report to the port to get on the ship I was told that the ship is the USS\nGeneral Taylor and I said, \u201cOh, my goodness, has he received a promotion,\u201d you know,\nbecause he'd been Colonel Taylor, but obviously it was a different Taylor. In any event, we\nformed a very close knit group on that victory ship. There were also some women going\nover as stenographers. There were a few former Germans who were going over as\ntranslators. We talked about the obvious things, things we'd been doing in recent years and\nwhat we hoped to do when we got over there. When we did get over there, there wasn't very\nmuch for us to do because the IMT trial was on, everybody working was concerned with it.\nWe didn't know whether there would be a second international trial of industrialists, but my\ninterest, Telford's interest certainly was, in beginning to research for one kind of a trial or\nanother involving the I. G. Farben people. I did sit in for a number of days between April\nand June on the IMT case, became familiar with the identities of the defendants, the people\nin the dock, also trying to get organized with respect to I. G. Farben. There were then only\ntwo of us who wanted to work the I. G. Farben case. One was a lawyer from Virginia named\nJim Heath,\u201d who'd been a railroad lawyer, whose father had been the counsel to the\nSouthern Railroad. And we knew, the thing we did know as background matter was Bell's\nreport to the Kilgore Committee, which was Part seven of that series of documents, and we\nalso had a Part 10 which detailed in narrative form some of the exhibits that they used. And\nthen we began looking for documents because we had reason to believe that there was an I.\nG. Farben document center in Frankfurt. There were German documents in Berlin. All of\nthese were captured documents. And there was one, what was the name of that little town\noutside of Frankfurt, Belle? Down by, no, down by Hoechst? No, I'll think of it. In any\nevent, went to all of those places, couldn't find significant I.G. documents. By the time June\narrived, it seemed reasonably clear that we wouldn't have a second international trial,\nalthough Telford was not sure of it and I'd exhausted all the possible sources of Kilgore\ndocuments. So we decided that I'd go to Washington to look for Kilgore documents because\nthe people on that investigating committee were Justice people, Treasury people, War\nDepartment people \u2014 a limited number. And he said, \u201cWhile you're there, while you're\nlooking for those documents, please open a document center in the Pentagon for the high\ncommand and general staff on military cases and also on SS cases.\u201d And he said, \u201cwhen you\n71 James E. Heath; Chief Counsel for the Farben trial team during its initial stages of\npreparation.\nget there, you can work with Mickey Marcus, Colonel David Marcus, who is the head of the\nWar Crimes Branch of the War Department.\u201d So I worked with Mickey, you know who\nColonel Marcus was, he was the West Point graduate who went over to Israel and was shot\nbecause he didn't know the password or tell the password. He was a very colorful figure,\nboth in Jewish lore and in military lore.\nHe was a lawyer who was buried up at West Point, who also after Telford, went back after\nhis hiring the first 12, did the interviewing and the hiring for the remaining civilian lawyers\nwho went over to Nuremberg. So in the months of July and August we hired a staff, did the\nnecessary work to collect all of those military and SS documents in the Pentagon, and then I\nwent to my first love, which was to find the I. G. Farben documents. So I took the\nintroduction to Part seven and I spoke with every one of the Kilgore people. There were I\nthink seven or eight of them I talked to, trying to avoid talking to Miss Belle Mayer, who\nwrote the report, you know. Oh, they didn't know where the documents were, but I damn\nwell better talk to Belle Mayer. I was not very fond of lady lawyers at that particular point in\nmy life, so I called over to the treasury shortly, at the end of August, and a lawyer named\nBob Scott answered her telephone and he said, \u201cYes, this is where she works, but she's in\nColorado now on vacation. She'll be back after Labor Day.\u201d So the Friday after Labor Day I\ncalled, she answered the phone, I went over there, and we met. And I told her my tale of\nwoe and said, \u201cWhat can you tell me?\u201d In despair I said, \u201c\u201cWhat can you tell me about the I.\nG. Farben documents, Miss Mayer?\u201d So she pulled open 12 file drawers and she said,\n\u201cThese are the I. G. Farben documents, at least the Kilgore documents.\u201d So I looked at this\ntall, blonde girl, had a lot of suntan from her vacation and I said, with a new look in my eye\nI said, \u201cMiss Mayer, you are a wondrous lady. I'll send over here for these documents from\nthe Pentagon.\u201d [end of side 1, tape 2]\nWZ: _ It's not confusing, it's just a matter of timing and we'll do, as far as I'm concerned, you call\nthe shots here. I'll tell you what you want to hear.",
        "Q: No, no, no, but I just\u2014to tell you the sorts of things that I'm interested 1n, I'll let you\n(indecipherable). Wait just a minute. Hold it a minute. Okay, Bill, maybe you'll continue on.\nWZ: Belle said to me in no uncertain terms, \u201c\u201cYou can't have these documents.\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cWe need\nthem. We need them desperately for trial. How can we prepare for trial?\u2019 And she said to\nme, \u201cI don't think you people would know how to use these documents,\u201d you know, in\nconnection with the business of how this young woman was treated over in government, you\nknow. She was giving me back some of what she undoubtedly faced herself. Well, she\nworked it out that the Treasury Department would work overtime over the weekend and\nphotostat the documents if I could assure her that the War Department would reimburse the\nTreasury Department for the extra cost and I assured her that we could. And I left\nWashington on Friday and I came back on Monday morning and there, sitting in four or five\nlarge gunnysacks, were the Xeroxed copies of the precious documents. So I telephoned her\npromptly \u2014 I had to get back to Nuremberg because they were about to issue the decision in\nthe IMT case, I certainly wanted to be present.\nI called her and said, \u201cThank you for the documents Miss Mayer. Can I take you to dinner?\u201d\nAnd her response was, \u201cThe bill for overtime is 47 dollars and you're committed to having\nthe War Department send us a check?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, the War Department will send you a\ncheck.\u201d We had dinner and I went back with the gunnysacks on Wednesday, back to\nNuremberg. Now it was very clear that we were going to have an I. G. Farben trial and it\nwould be conducted by the United States. No other powers in this case; we were going alone\non this case and we desperately needed people to staff the prosecution. So the first thing I\ntried to do was get Belle, and we were having these telecons\u201d* each week and Belle began\nto, I guess she began to think about coming over, although the first I realized was when she\nwas asking me on the telecon how much we would pay her, what her classification would\nbe, because she would have to transfer from the Treasury Department to the War\nDepartment and that kind of bureaucratic nonsense, you know. She wanted a raise above her\npresent salary and Jim Heath said, \u201cWell, let her have it,\u201d and I said, \u201cHell no, she's not\ngoing to get paid any more than we're getting paid.\u201d She came over, in any event, she came\nover in early November, I think. And she promptly went after several of her colleagues in\nTreasury who she felt would be useful here and one of them was Josiah DuBois, who came\nover and became the head of the whole trial team. And he put her to work drawing the\nindictment, which she did largely all by herself. At the same time, I had a special project set\nup in Frankfurt with a Paul Dencker, who was the chief bookkeeper of I. G. Farben, and I\nwas pumping him over a number of days for information about the work activity of each of\n2 Teleconferences.\nthese members of the Vorstand, so that we had curriculum vitae on all of them from\nDencker. And I came back from there, Belle worked on the indictment, and shortly after that\nI realized that I would not probably be able to function with the new hierarchy of\nprosecutors on the I. G. Farben case, because Joe DuBois had decided \u2014 he had seen a\npicture of an ugly SOB in an SS uniform, who somehow worked for I. G. Farben in some\ncapacity, named von der Hyde\u201d? and he said, \u201cI've got to have this man in the dock,\u201d and I\nsaid, \u201cThe man doesn't belong in our dock because of the careful selection we've made with\nrespect to background.\u201d\u2019 Every member in the dock was a member of the Vorstand.",
        "Q: [Technical conversation: I\u2019ve got to see what this noise 1s... |\nWZ: I decided that with all the work and effort I put into this thing, with the care with which I'd\nselected the individual defendants, developed their backgrounds through quizzing and\ninterrogating Dencker, and with the theory, the legal theory I had established with respect to\nthe individual responsibility of each of the Vorstand members. When Joe DuBois arrived\nfrom the United States of America \u2014 and I don't know what, if any background he had on I.\nG.; Belle had a lot of background. I didn't know what DuBois's background was, but that\ndidn't matter if all he could see himself doing, fresh off a plane, on the basis of a photograph\nhe saw, was make an arbitrary decision to replace a vulnerable defendant with a guy in an\nSS uniform, I figured that I'd had enough, you know. Belle was there, there was a new team,\nanother one arrived while I was busy interrogating in Frankfurt, in the coldest winter they'd\n3 Erich von der Hyde, Member of Political Economy Department.\nseen in a hundred years, a man came in off a plane named Morris Amchen, and he looked\naround and he saw what I was doing, and he said have I examined their income tax returns?\nSo I figured this was another one who was going to brighten my life as I try to proceed with\nthis prosecution. I decided to go home. Before I went home, I was asked to serve as the\ncounsel to the court in the Justice case; the Justice case was a marvelous case. You saw the\nbones of it in the movie Justice at Nuremberg. They structured that, the story, in terms of the\nJustice case and I was being pushed by a dear friend, Charlie LaFollette,** who was the chief\nprosecutor in that case, to come with that court. Telford Taylor called me on the telephone\nand he said, \u201cBill, with all the work you've done, why don't you stay and help put the case\ninto court?\u201d And I said, \u201cTelford, I am going home, period.\u201d So I went home, and I brooded\nall \u2014 for the rest of the year and finally decided to sit down and make my contribution to\nNuremberg, in the form of that article in the North Carolina law Journal. But my Nuremberg\nwork breaks off at this point, so that I think Belle better carry it forward.",
        "Q: I just wanted to ask you a couple of questions before we talk to Belle again.\nWZ: Go ahead, sure.",
        "Q: You had established, helped establish which defendants you were going to prosecute and\nyou talked about individual responsibility. Was there some overriding principle that needed to apply\nin your mind when you chose these people?\n4 Charles LaFollette (1890-1974); Representative from Indiana, Deputy Chief Counsel\nfor War Crimes at Nuremberg in 1947.\nWZ: Well, number one, you had to be able to indicate that these people were involved and\nimportantly involved in making policy and in their functioning together with the Hitler people,\ntogether with Goering, who was in charge of the, not the four year plan, what was it?\nBZ: Yes, he was.\nWZ: Incharge of the four year plan. You had to know what their activities were in the company\nand they were as varied in I. G. Farben as the 12 \u2014 the defendants in the 12 different cases \u2014 the 12\nindividual cases were. But all of these coagulated in our minds anyway in terms of their contribution\nto the war, you see. Now these Vorstand people were, some were chemists, some were engineers,\nthere's a couple of lawyers, some were salespeople, whose activities were involved in foreign\ndiplomacy.\nBZ: \u2014 Spying.\nWZ: Spying for the Nazis, sure. But we had all of these things set up and as a lawyer, we had to\ndo it that way. You couldn't just use a broad brush and decide because a man was on the Vorstand,\nwe'll put him in the dock. It wasn't that kind of thing, we had background, we had information, we\nhad evidence on all of these people.",
        "Q: Was it difficult to get that background?\nWZ: There were two ways in which we acquired evidence. One was through paper,\ndocumentation, which was really the bulk of what we did in all of the trials and the other was\nthrough interrogation. And the interrogation process proceeded exceedingly well, unlike trying to\nprosecute war criminals in Bosnia, because these people were our prisoners. We had won a war and\nthey really didn't have any alternative, so that when you interrogated them and you had some\ndocumentation when you did interrogate, I think you could expect for them to tell you the truth,\nparticularly since they all had one defense: Superior orders\u2014we had to do it because Hitler ordered\nit or we had to do it because the head of the company ordered it, you see. But you still didn\u2019t make a\ncase that requires individual knowledge and individual acquiescence and responsibility, without\nproving that the individual defendant did know what he was doing and did willingly collaborate\nwith the Hitler government.",
        "Q: Is there any way to sum up your impressions of some of these people you interrogated?\nWZ: I think, of the people that I interrogated, basically my useful interrogation on I. G. Farben\nwas with this bookkeeper Paul Dencker. And Dencker was a mousy little man with a\nmustache, who may have weighed about 147 pounds soaking wet. And he sat very\nsubmissively and referred to me as \u201cHerr Doktor,\u201d\u201d> you know, and he answered my\nquestions and I would question him about Krauch and about Schmitz\u201d\u00b0 and about\nSchnitzler?\u2019 and about Heinrich Mann,\u201d\u00ae and all the other people in the dock, what did they\ndo. And he knew what they all did, what their assignments were and so forth. He had a vast\nknowledge and I was fortunate to have Dencker, and I think you people knew of Dencker\nbecause I first saw his name in one of your reports, Belle. But then I went home and turned\nI. G. Farben, the prosecution, over to the tender mercies of Belle Mayer and Joe DuBois and\nI guess Drex Sprecher?\u201d became involved in the case too.",
        "Q: Did you interview any, did you interrogate these other members of the Vorstand?\n5 Doctor (German).\n6 Hermann Schmitz, Chairman of I.G. Farben\u2019s Board of Directors.\n717 Georg von Schnitzler, Chairman of Farben\u2019s Board of Directors.\n8 Wilhelm Mann, Chairman of Farben\u2019s Board of Directors.\n9 Drexel A. Sprecher, Assistant Trial Counsel for the United States at Nuremberg.\nWZ:  I'msure I did, some of them. At this particular moment I am hard pressed to remember\nwhich. I think you may gather, at this point, with my departure, that there's a certain philosophical\nrejection of that part of the I. G. Farben prosecution that followed my departure. They were in good\nhands.",
        "Q: Let me ask you one other question and then you're off the hook for a while.\nWZ: Right.",
        "Q: You initially went over to work on these cases during the time of the IMT, and you were an\nobserver there. What was, can you describe for me what it was like to be in that courtroom?\nWZ: During most of the time that early summer and late spring, the trial was being conducted by\na man who later became United States Senator Thomas J. Dodd.*\" He was a little white-\nhaired man with a round belly, and he was the least likely American impression of a great\ntrial lawyer, but he stuck it out you see, until many people, there were many who came there\nwith reputations, who came to Nuremberg, stayed a week, who were well known back\nhome, who were using this Nuremberg adventure, to which they contributed very little, for\npolitical purposes and to dress up their curriculum vitae(ph), you know. There were many of\nthose. There were a number of very competent young people, like my old colleague Tom\nLambert of the BEW, who was a naval officer at the time and a number of others who made\na contribution, worked hard and did make a contribution and then went home. Everybody\nwanted to get home. All the people in uniform wanted to get home.\n30 Thomas Dodd (1907-1971); Senator from Connecticut; Executive Trial Counsel, U.S.\nCounsel at Nuremberg.",
        "Q: What was it like in that courtroom? What was the atmosphere like?\nWZ: The atmosphere in the courtroom \u2014 number one in the dock was Hermann Goering; in\npolitical terms, the head of the whole team. And he was leaning over the \u2014 like I'm leaning\nover the edge of this table, you know, appearing disinterested. Generally, he had his own\nidea about where this was going and he knew what was going to happen. At the other end, at\nthe far end from Goering was sitting Mr. Schacht,*' Hjalmar Schacht. Schacht did not look\nahead. Schacht sat with his back, if this was the dock, Staccato was sitting here and looking\nout in this direction. Across from where I'm sitting would be the well of the courtroom, with\nthe lawyers and parallel to this, on the other side, were the judges. The legal staffs were off\nat one end and you have the twenty two people in the dock and each had a particular\ndifferent face and different approach. You had the disgusting pig of a man, who was the\npublisher of a dirty magazine, Der Stiirmer, you know, Julius Streicher.** You had the two\nmilitary leaders, Jodl** and Keitel** and they were wearing uniforms that hadn't been\npressed that morning for sure. You had the two naval leaders, Raeder*> and the guy who\u2014\nBZ: \u2014 Jodl?\nWZ: No, no. Raeder and the one who succeeded Hitler. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: It's okay, I'm just trying to get a sense of \u2014\n31 Hyalmar Schact (1897-1970), President of the Reichsbank.\n2 Julius Streicher (1882-1946), Founder and Editor-in-Chief of Der Sturmer.\n3 Alfred Jodl (1890-1946); Chief of Operations Staff of the High Command of the\nGerman Armed forces, 1939-1945.\n4 Wilhelm Keitel (1882-1946), General Field Marshall and Chief of Staff of the German\nArmed Forces, 1938-1945.\n5 Erich Raeder (1876-1960), Grand Admiral and Commander in Chief of German Navy.\nWZ: Iknow his\u2014",

You had the Nazi philosopher Rosenberg,*\u2019 you had the\nguy who looked like he was left with half a brain, Rudolf Hoess,** whose look never\nchanged. He just sat there looking out like this. You had people like von Papen,*\u201d the\ndiplomat, who was well-controlled, who also was acquitted. You had the butchers, Hans\nFrank,*\u00b0 who was the Gauleiter*! of Poland, who was a prominent Catholic and who said,\nquote, \u201cIf Germany lives for 1000 years, it will never be able to atone for what it's done to\nthe Jews.\u201d A few others, I would have to look, yeah. But that was it and it went along in\nvery desultory fashion. Now I was not there when this happened, but one of the spectacular\nparts of the trial was when Goering testified, and when Goering testified, because this was\nthe piece de resistance, our chief prosecutor, who delivered most wonderful opening and\nclosing addresses with magnificent prose, came in to cross-examine Goering. And he wasn't\n6 Karl Doenitz (1891-1980), Commander in Chief of German Navy and Hitler\u2019s\ndesignated successor.\n7 Alfred Rosenberg (1893-1946), Hitler\u2019s mentor and semi-official philosopher of Nazi\nparty.\n8 Rudolph Hoess (1900-1947); Commandant of Auschwitz, 1940-1943.\n*\u00b0 Franz von Papen (1879-1969), Reich Chancellor in 1932 and Hitler\u2019s Deputy\nChancellor.\n\u00a9 Hans Frank (1900-1946), Nazi party jurist and Governor-General of Poland during\nWorld War II.\n+! Term used for head of a Nazi administrative district (German).\nwell-prepared for the kind of stuff he was getting from Goering, and the press was reporting\nthat very sharply and in abundance, so that after a day or two of Justice Jackson,\u201d the\nBritish were called in to put some semblance of usefulness into this cross examination of\nGoering. And that was done by Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, who had just become the Attorney\nGeneral. That was it. There was a lot of \u2014 so there was a lot of sitting and time was passing\nduring the Tom Dodd period and the trial was just \u2014 much of the stuff, the documentation\npart of it, didn't have any fireworks, you see, because under the rules established, every\ndocument had to be translated into four languages and document books, with respect to each\ndefendant, had to be delivered in advance to the defendant's counsel. And so it was a very\nslow and quite tedious process. But the reason really, the basis for the convictions was very\nmuch more the documentation than the interrogation of the witnesses. The witnesses all\nsaid, superior orders, Hitler ordered it, we had to do it. But the Germans, this is generally\nknown, were absolutely wonderful document keepers, you know. They loved nothing better\nthan General Ohlendorf* reporting each day in the Einsatzgruppen documents in the village\nof wherever, \u201cWe shot 167 Jews, 72 Gypsies, a dozen or so Communists,\u201d and so forth. And\nthese, even at the level of the industrialists, in terms of their production, in terms of the\nconferences and the work they did for the Nazi government, were very well recorded.",

That,\nyes.",
        "Q: [Inaudible]. Belle, your colleague left At this point and you were\u2014\nBZ: Well, I want to say first one thing in self defense. Bill made it sound as if my reluctance to\ngo to Nuremberg was predicated on mercenary grounds and it was not. I did ask for a raise\nin salary, but that was very incidental to the proposition that Schacht and Funk*\u00ae had been\nacquitted and I knew that it was going to be very hard to convince judges that these nice\nlooking businessmen, these important businessmen, could be guilty of the heinous crimes\nthat they committed. What did Funk have, a few, some years? But anyway \u2014 and Speer got\nsome years, but the economics people\u2014\nWZ: Speer got 20 years.\nBZ: None of the economics people were sentenced to death or anywhere near it, and 1t was\nbecause if these leaders of the economic life of the country had got such light sentences,\nthen I couldn't see them going after these men who looked like businessmen, talked like\nbusinessmen, and were really murderers. I haven't even got into poison gas, or gotten into\nmedical experiments for which four of the Farben defendants were convicted and again\ngiven very light sentences. The medical experiments which the United States Holocaust\n46 Walther Funk (1890-1960); Minister of Economic Affairs, 1937-1945.\nMuseum has so well documented, I won't go into them, but the Farben people sent quantities\nof serums to be tested on concentration camp inmates. They were injected with various\ntyphus and typhoid serums, which were experimental.\nThey were subjected to atmospheric pressure experiments where the inmates not only died\nbut they, their brains exploded; they died in incredible agony. And our court could give you\nan example of what, for want of a more elegant word, I will call nit-picking \u2014 took the word\nVersuch,*\u2019 V-e-r-s-u-c-h, and in its decision the court wrote, the prosecution claims, I'm\nparaphrasing, the prosecution claims that that means experiment. The defendants claim that\nit means test. In a criminal case, we must give the favor of the doubt to the defendants. Now\nif anyone can tell me the difference between experiment and test, I'd be glad to hear it.\nFarben also manufactured the poison gas, the Zyklon B, and the serum and the Sarin and the\nTabun which were used to exterminate the concentration camp inmates, knowing full well\nthe purposes for which it was going to be used, because these were volatile gases and only I.\nG. Farben, only their technicians, could control the incidence of the gas, the volatility of it.\nAside from that, though, I do think this \u2014 again going back to the prosecution, that we came\nfrom very diverse walks of life and obviously very different exposures. But by and large, all\nof the lawyers were, as Bill said, very idealistic, very knowledgeable about the atrocities\ncommitted by Hitler and other people in the Third Reich and determined to mete out justice.\n47 Experiment, trial, or test (German).\nMany of us felt as the British felt in London \u2014 that the crimes that these people had\ncommitted had been repeated so often and were of such common knowledge that the courts\nshould take res adjudicata*\u00ae of some of these events and acts that had been publicized on a\nworldwide basis. Take judicial notice of the fact that they were committed, without the\nnecessity of these very labored proofs. And that's where the trials bogged down, because as\na result of the problems in the IMT, they'll also mention that the subsequent proceedings\nwere conducted under the charter, that was the substantive law, but because of the terrible\nproblems of the translation and the reproduction of documents, the subsequent proceedings\nwere conducted under Allied Control Counsel law number 10, which said, in effect, that if\nan original document could not be produced, that a Photostat might be used. That if it were\nimpossible to authenticate a particular document, if the authenticating party was dead or\nmissing or couldn't be located, that proof of the source of that document would make it\neligible for admission into evidence. In other words, the rules of evidence were ameliorated\nbecause of physical exigencies, while our, the Farben court, our judges, went back to the\nbasic rules of the evidence, Anglo-Saxon rules, would not permit in evidence any document\nthat hadn't been authenticated and reauthenticated. In fact, if I may be personal, and we've\nbeen very personal here, this was the only continuing brawl I had with my colleagues at\nNuremberg. The case of von Schnitzler is a good point, is a good example. The\ninvestigating group that had initially gone into Germany had taken several depositions of\n8A matter adjudged; a thing or matter decided by judgment. Rule that a final judgment\nrendered by a court of competent jurisdiction on the merits is conclusive as to the rights\nof the parties and their privies, and, as to them, constitutes an absolute bar to a\nsubsequent action involving the same claim, demand, or cause of action.\u201d Henry Campell\nBlack, M.A. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (St. Paul: West Publishing Co., 1983) s.v. \u201cres\nadjudicata.\u201d\nvon Schnitzler in which he bared his breasts, so to speak, in which he said yes. They\ndescribed he was the first person to describe the meeting of February 1933, in which I. G.\nFarben had cast its lot with Hitler. He was the first person to say, once we got the assurances\nthat our plans for developing synthetic oil and synthetic rubber were very much to Hitler's\nliking, we then supported him in every possible way. And these depositions of his were\npretty lengthy. Well, somebody on our trial staff said, \u201cOh, you can't introduce this\ndocument because of some technical flaw,\u201d very minor and so Drex Sprecher went back and\nhe again examined von Schnitzler after all these years, after von Schnitzler had been sitting\nin jail, talking to his former colleagues and undoubtedly taking a beating from them for the\ncandor with which he had spoken two years earlier.\nAnd he said, he didn't exactly retract but he said that he didn't know what he was saying\nbecause he said \u2014 now I'm quoting, \u201cI was terribly\u201d (quote) \u201cdepressed at the time.\u201d He\nrecanted. Eventually Drex went back to him and he finally said, \u201cWhat I initially told those\npeople in Frankfurt in 1944 or '45, I forget which was the truth.\u201d\u2019 But I mean this constant\nrevisiting of a document \u2014 don't forget that in the Farben case, over 2000 documents were\nintroduced. That doesn't include the interrogations of the defendants and of other employees\nof I. G. Farben, who had written very damning memos to the board of directors. So I would\nlike to comment on something else, because I don't think that young people today, even\nlawyers, can begin to visualize the mechanical difficulties under which we were operating.\nWe did not have modern Xerox machines, copying machines; we had these old photo\ncopiers, which were a wet process and they had to, you had to use this thin copy paper\nwhich came out and curled at the edges. Now we were required to give the defendants\u2019\ncopies of all of our exhibits 24 hours in advance of their introduction. This called for a very\nstrict trmetable. In the meantime the mimeograph people \u2014 I didn't mean photocopying, I\nmeant mimeographing. The mimeograph people were working double shifts, but even so,\nthey couldn't handle this volume of business. We never were able to get things from them on\ntime. Instead of having our own duplicating machines, we had to rely on this pen. The\nmimeograph \u2014 pen is not the right word for it but \u2014 they were 1n isolation and somebody\nwould hand them something, it could be a Rand McNally atlas with a hundred pages of\ncharts. We also had to assist the defendants 1n locating things they considered material to\ntheir defense, which they did not have the means to locate, so that half the time we were\nworking for the defendants, assisting them. I felt these were the only brawls we had, that we\nwere leaning backwards to show how fair we were being. Charles LaFollette, whom Bill\nmentioned, the former congressman from Indiana \u2014 Bill described his role in the case, the\nJustice case and against the judges, the people's court.\nLaFollette said that, once said jestingly, but with great weariness, that he had always thought\nthat the aim of the trials was to punish the prosecution and all that the trials were doing was\nkilling, to punish the defendants. But all they were doing was killing the prosecution, and\nthere was a lot of truth in that. In fact, we had, I think what the prosecution was lacking, if I\nmay be as frank as Bill, I think that what we were lacking was top-notch trial counsel. This\nis in retrospect. I think if we had had some good homicide lawyers over there, we might\nhave made a more telling case. As it was, we did have some trial lawyers who came with\ngood reputations for advocacy, who left, because these were people, no matter how\nprimitive our technical equipment, these were people who were used to pushing a button\nand summoning a staff who would immediately respond. Our typewriters were antiquated,\nmaking carbon copies, 25 of every single thing that was done, was just back-breaking. And\nso we had trial lawyers who just would not stay because they could not operate in this very\nfrustrating milieu.",
        "Q: What else can you tell me about preparing for the trials themselves \u2014 the collection of\nevidence, who helped you in that endeavor?\nBZ: Well, we had analysts, translators, and we would tell them what we were looking for. I had\ndone a draft of a trial memorandum but I'm wondering how many people on the trial team was\nfollowing it very rigidly, because frequently we would send off an analyst, say to Berlin document\ncenter because we felt that certain points we were going to make, needed some bolstering. And they\nwould go to Berlin and these people did work, but they would decide what they wanted to prove and\nthey would come back with documents which they considered really incriminatory, but they were\nnot the documents you sent them for. There were analysts, there were stenographers, there were\npeople to whom one gave documents already in one's possession and asked them to give you a\ndigest of them. So this was the staff, there were lawyers, analysts, stenographers and then these kind\nof separate omnibus groups, like the mimeograph people.\nWZ: We did use Germans. The Germans were eager to work because they would get a decent\nration, you know, and they weren't in policy positions. They did mechanical work, you\nknow. And they mounted mechanical work required, you can gather from Belle's\ndescription, of the movement of the document from a cave in which it was uncovered by the\narmy and its intended use by an attorney after the document had been translated, and so on\nand so forth. And then it had to be gotten into the hands of the defendant. It was a very,\nvery, very difficult operation. I must say this, I don't intend really to sound sour on the\nNuremberg activity, regardless of how I felt and why I left when I did. Three things I think\nmust be mentioned: Number one, the law we established, which provided that a head of the\ngovernment could be prosecuted as a war criminal, was brand new. Nobody ever thought of\ntrying the Kaiser\u2019? or I don't want to speak about Napoleon because it escapes me at the\nmoment, but that is now accepted international law. Number two, with respect to superior\norders, it has always been, in the American order of battle, that you obeyed the order of the\nsuperior officer and if that superior were a corporal or a sergeant or a captain or a general,\nhis order was sacrosanct. As a result of Nuremberg, our order of battle was changed to\nprovide you had to obey only the lawful order of a superior officer. So now, even the private\nis invested with a policy gene. He has to obey what he's ordered to do, but not if he's ordered\nto kill babies and defenseless people, as happened in the Lieutenant Calley case in...\nBZ: \u2014 Vietnam.\nWZ: Vietnam. So those two things, and perhaps the most important thing \u2014 and I certainly did not\ngo to Nuremberg for the purpose of creating a history. I went to Nuremberg with the\npurpose of establishing certain law with respect to initiating and waging aggressive war.\nAnd I don't feel that we were successful, basically, in that respect, but we established a\n* Emperor (German).\nhistory and all the skinheads that can be collected on anywhere and all the naysayers have to\nface the history, the transcripts of the Nuremberg trials, the volumes \u2014 several different sets\nof volumes, the first one on the IMT, a terrible volume, 42 of them, the blue back, and so\nforth.\nBut this kind of thing \u2014 and mine is not a document recital \u2014 but those compilations, which\nlargely Drex Sprecher was the head of editing and gathering, that's been Sprech\u2019s career,\nreally have been on file in European countries and in libraries and the Library of Congress,\nof course, and in law libraries all over the United States of America. And that is not policy\nstuff, that's historical fact. Fortunately most of it\u2019s supplied by documents maintained by the\nGermans themselves. So that to me is the warming aspect of my recollection of Nuremberg.\nIt was a terrible place in which to work and if when they didn't pay attention to you, you\nformed a softball team and you played out where Hitler used to conduct his meetings in the,\nwhat was the\u2014\nBZ: \u2014 Sportpalast(ph).\nWZ: Sportpalast, yeah. And you sat around and you talked and you talked about many, many\nthings, but you did an enormous amount of reading of documents and so forth. And \u2014 but\nthe history of Nuremberg is something that pleases me very much. It was worth all the \u2014\nthere was a good deal of agony involved in doing that work over there, no question about it.\nSo I'm glad I was associated with it.\nBZ: \u2014 And it certainly is the answer to the revisionists.",
        "Q: Let's just go back a little bit more to the I. G. Farben trial?\nBZ: \u2014 Oh, is this going to go on much longer?",
        "Q: I just want you to sort of wrap up this \u2014 what else can you tell me about\u2014\nBZ: \u2014 And incidentally, Randy, I'd like to say this, that the documents, which were unearthed by\nthe troops in 1944, which were the subject of the Senate investigation hearings, they were just a\nsmall part of the evidence, because after we got to Nuremberg, many of the defendants who had\nnever been interrogated were interrogated. We found caches of documents at various individual\nfactories throughout Germany. After all, I.G. Farben had about 500 factories and owned\ninnumerable related establishments. And so we sent investigators into all of these establishments,\nlooking for evidence to plug a lot of holes that we had and\u2014\nWZ: But you're talking I. G. Farben, aren't you?\nBZ: \u2014 Right. And to supplement what we already had.",
        "Q: Did you get support from other governments, from Jewish organizations?\nBZ: Well, none from Jewish organizations. I doubt that they had the kind of material that we\nhad. The support we got was from survivors of the camps, who might have been directed to us by\nthe Jewish organizations, but not as far as documentation was concerned, because they were not in\nGermany at the time, the Jewish organizations were not. We did talk to many survivors, of\nAuschwitz in particular.",
        "Q: Did you personally?\nBZ: No. In anon-assignment fashion. I would talk to people in the DP camps, but I was severely\nhandicapped in that sense. I could not speak Yiddish and no one could understand my German. I\nthought I was pretty good at German, but nobody could understand it. I have a terrible accent in\neverything. As a matter of fact the only way I could talk to people in the DP camps and particularly\nto the children was in my baby Hungarian, because you'd always find a Hungarian Jew who could\ntranslate for you. And my discussions with them rarely bordered on their experiences because the\nkind of evidence we could use had to be really in-depth kind of probe.",
        "Q: Were you involved in the interrogation of any of the defendants?\nBZ: \u2014 Before the trial, yes. I was involved with this same von Schnitzler we've been talking about\nand with Ilgner.\u00b0\u00b0 Now many of our defendants were very dignified people whose bearing\nand whose looks and whose speech were not lost upon the court, believe me. But then there\nwere other defendants who were really rather loathsome, including one whom I interrogated,\nMax II gner, and he was the chief salesman of the group and he had salesmen throughout the\nworld, but his salesmen in South America were called Verbingsdungsmanner\u201d! and they\nwere, they became spies for the German government. It's interesting to me that every place\nwe went in Germany was full of documentation, but there were two special groups in Berlin\nwhich dealt directly with the Wehrmacht, (the German army), and exclusively with them.\nAnd one was called the Vermittlungsstelle\u00b0\u2019, which was the headquarters of these salesmen.\nAnd they reported, the bureau in Berlin reported directly to the German high command. And\n\u00b0\u00b0 Max IIgner, I.G. Farben Director.\n>! Middleman, contact (German).\n\u00b0\u00b0 Agency (German).\nthey, 1t was that bureau whose records were all destroyed, before the United States and\nAllied advance in 1944. And there was another bureau which dealt directly with the army\nand with the intelligence people and that was called VOWI,>? V-O-W-L, and their records\nwere destroyed. So I did interrogate this salesman and asked him what happened to the\ndocuments, to try to find out, and he protested mightily against being examined by a girl and\nhe said that he had been humiliated a lot by everything that had gone on since the war's end,\nbut the worst humiliation he'd ever had to face was being interrogated by a female.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about the trial itself. I'd love you to tell me a little bit about the trial itself,\nsort of describe what was going on, what it felt like, and any particularly interesting aspects of it.\nBZ: Well, there were three judges and an alternate sitting at the side, facing the defendants on a\nraised kind of platform and opposite there were 21 chairs in the dock. And incidentally, Bill\nwas talking about the selection of the defendants before \u2014 we could have selected 50\ndefendants worthy of the title but there were only 21 chairs so the prosecution was limited in\nthat respect. And they were on either side to the front of the courtroom and beneath them on\na long table, a long, almost platform-y kind of apparatus, were the interpreters and the\nstenographers and in front \u2014 that was on one side \u2014 on the other side, in front of the dock\nwere the defendants counsel, who were numerous. I don't think that, I'm sure that every\ndefendant didn't have his private lawyer, but there were several defense lawyers, some like\nDix,>* represented four or five defendants, others just represented one. But and then there\n3 Volkswirtschaftliche Abteikung, or Political Economy Office (German).\n4 Dr. Rudolph Dix, Hermann Schmitz\u2019s Defense Counsel.\nwas the prosecution table, fairly close to the judges\u2019 dais, but more toward the center of the\nroom, and they had a table. Why the defense counsels\u2019 table wasn't alongside, I don't know\n\u2014 maybe so they could talk to their clients more readily. Then behind the table at which the\ndefense counsel were sitting were the chairs for the audience. The Farben case had a big\npress there, pardon me. Then in the gallery, in a balcony, there were observers, ordinary\npeople who wanted to see the trial and the witnesses were kept in a separate room off the\ncourtroom. There are many pictures of the courtroom and particularly of the Farben defense.",
        "Q: What was it like being there?\nBZ: Well, it was a little nerve-wracking because the thing that made it worse was that \u2014 were the\nobjections of defense counsel, which would come rattling into your earphones while you\nwere trying to make a point. And after a while I decided that if I were going to get anything\naccomplished, I'd better put my earphones down and not listen to them, which is something\nI should not have said in public. But the Chief Justice, Curtis Shake*> was very, very polite\nto me and there again maybe my sex helped me because I sure didn't get the lectures that\nsome of the men got, nor was I a party to some of their brawls. I think the judges all,\nwhether they were sympathetic to the prosecution or not \u2014 and none of them were\nsympathetic except for Paul Hebert>\u00b0, the dean of Louisiana State Law School, of Louisiana\nLaw School. He was the only person who seemed to understand what the prosecution was\n\u00b0> Curtis Grover Shake, Presiding Judge, International Military Tribunal.\n\u00b06 Paul Macarius Hebert, Judge, International Military Tribunal.\ndoing and was sympathetic. But the other three\u2014well, Merrell\u2019 doesn't count, but Shake\nand Morris\u00b0\u00ae were unfailingly courteous to me. Now, I left after the first count\u2014Crimes\nAgainst Peace \u2014 which we discussed in great detail, after that was put in, I did not stay for\nthe rest of the case, but I followed the case for a number of years, best I could and got letters\nfrequently from Nuremberg and we had some friends on the New York Times. When they'd\nget back from Germany, they would bring me up to date, but there were brawls that were\nreported in the newspapers, in the New York Times and in other publications. For example,\nJudge Morris at one point asked Drexel Sprecher how many more documents he intended to\nput in and Drex said ,\u201c*500,\u201d and Morris just plain had a fit. He said, \u201cWe're going to be here\nfor another year\u201d and, \u201c\u201cWhy can't you curtail your evidence?\u201d and \u201cYou're bringing in\neverything including the kitchen bathtub.\u201d And he really reamed Drex out in a very\ninjudicial manner.",
        "Q: What was the morale like over there among the prosecution team?\nBZ: \u2014 It was not good because of what I told you before, that one of the judges was reported to\nhave said that he couldn't see the difference between I. G. Farben and Dupont and that not only\ncaused, was not calculated to lift up people's morale, but I decided or I felt that it would be a good\nidea if we didn't lead off with Crimes Against Peace and lead off with all these innumerable charts\nshowing I. G. Farben's organization and particularly where the defendants that Bill had so much to\ndo with, where they fit into the hierarchy, whether it was manufacturing or sales or administration or\n*7 Clarence F. Merrell, Alternate Judge, International Military Tribunal.\n8 James Morris, Judge, International Military Tribunal.\nwhere. I think it might have been better if we had led off with Slave Labor or some of these\natrocities which might have created some interest in Morris. It would have been extremely difficult\nbut that was the sort of thing that would throw you off base and you'd have discussions about it until\nall hours. Discussions of strategy and how to cope with a couple of the judges, who were obviously\nhostile. Then again I might have had an advantage, Randy, not only because of my sex but I might\nhave had an advantage in that I was one of the first to lead off with a presentation of the\nprosecution's case, so that their patience might have been in better shape at that time.\nWZ: I think, and this is all in retrospect, on the political side, I hadn't any idea how the judges\nwere selected to sit on particular cases. I know generally that the way the judges were selected here\nin the United States. The chief judge of the United States Supreme Court refused to let any\nSupreme Court judges come over, he refused to let any District Court judges to come over, so that\nyou really got a potpourri of people from various states of the country. However, just as cautious as\nwe were in the selection of the prosecution staff for I. G. Farben, for example, and I think basically\nfor better or worse, we felt that the best people we were getting would go to I. G. Farben and the\nother industrialist cases, if those lawyers wanted to work those cases you see. There should have\nbeen some technique for evaluating which judges were better prepared to serve on an I. G. Farben\ncase, for example. Paul Hebert belonged there, Morris of North Dakota, obviously didn't belong\nthere and you know, I'm speaking without knowing any of these people but from what I've heard.\nThat part of the process was faulty, but if you suggested that to Telford Taylor, he would possibly\nsay, \u201cLook at what we had to do to get a document translated,\u201d you know, and delivered to the\ndefendant and so on and so forth. And of course it was very, very \u2014 the difficulty in the whole\noperation, having sat on the Supreme Court of New York for 10 years myself and having since my\nretirement spent a good deal of time looking at the two because nobody wants anyone of any age to\ngo to his grave without having sat 500 hours watching the O. J. Simpson case, you know. The\nselection of judges is part of the function of an administrative judge, who ought to know his people\nand their backgrounds and their predilections sufficiently to assign them sensibly to cases. This was\nbeyond comprehension in Nuremberg and probably beyond having being able to work out. But I\ndon't know what kind of curriculum vitae Telford Taylor had with respect to each of the 33 judges\nwho came over, but it would seem to me that somebody made these assignments and I can only\nassume that they were made on a helter-skelter basis, which was unfortunate.\nBZ: That's true, they were picked on the basis of their volunteering to go. Now, that didn't mean\nthat we didn't have some very good judges. Out of our personal knowledge, I think that we\ncould name them. And when I say good judge, I don't mean that they should have been\ngiven the litmus test for whether they were for the prosecution or against the prosecution. I\nthink, though, that they did require a degree of sophistication. I feel they should have had\nbackground on the whole German gestalt, the whole German business. If nothing else, the\nrise of Hitler, what he did, who he was, how he succeeded in taking over an entire continent\nand how he almost succeeded in taking over the rest of the world.\nWZ: And what kind of work these judges did as lawyers, what their backgrounds were.\nBZ: And how skillful they were in handling a trial of this really great significance, great\nimportance.",
        "Q: What was local reaction to the trials, from your perceptions, being over there?\nBZ: \u2014 That's a hard one for me.\nWZ: _ It's a forgettable part of history. When we make the turn into the twenty-first century and all\nthe remaining people in their nineties and so forth and the children of these concentration camp\nsurvivors also go deep into Social Security, I don't think the trial will have very much more\nsignificance than the Civil War, which will be that much older again, in terms of centuries. It's going\nto be forgotten. But the history 1s there.\nBZ: Of course, except for international law scholars.\nWZ: Yes, well, again \u2014 and they know what they have taken out or they'll be able to find out what\nthey have taken out in terms of international law. But look at another reason that I was not eager to\nget involved at the last gathering last March was because I know from the work that Belle was\ndoing that they were busy writing resolutions concerning the establishment of the International\nCriminal Court at the Hague as well as Bosnia and the apprehension of those war criminals, and so\non and so forth. And everybody was so involved emotionally and I'm involved emotionally, too, but\nI cannot escape from the politics of the situation and the difficulty of deciding to take these indicted\nwar criminals out of Bosnia and deliver them to the Hague if you are in effect the United States of\nAmerica. Because the most significant thing politically about the difference between Nuremberg\nand what we're doing now, or trying to do now, is the fact that we had won a war and these people\nwere our prisoners, these defendants were. There was no question of delivering any one of the\ndefendants to the dock in Nuremberg, you did it.",
        "Q: But what I was trying to ask you was, at the time of the trials, was there a local reaction?\nWZ: = In Germany\u2019?",
        "Q: Correct.\nWZ: Germany was so \u2014 what I saw of it, Nuremberg, Frankfurt, was so badly torn up and\ndevastated that the Germans wanted to have a bed to sleep in and they wanted to have a place to eat\nin and they wanted to have some food on the table and this was beyond their enmities. The enmities\nby and large evaporated with the end of the war. They had to survive; the problem was survival.\nAnd not only did we not interfere with their survival, with the Marshall Plan and money that we\npumped into Germany and the other devastated countries and Japan, we rebuilt their factories and\nput them on their feet, you see.\nBZ: They were hostile, they were hostile to the trials, naturally. That's a generalization, but\nneither Bill nor I are any tests of public opinion because we simply didn't deal with the public. We\nhave read accounts by Rebecca West and other journalists and reporters but we would not be able to\ngauge the German reaction at all.",
        "Q: I would love to\u2014\nEnd of Tape Three\nTape Four\nBZ: We talked a great deal about the tensions created by the difficulties of the place we were\nworking in. Incidentally, I haven't even mentioned the freezing cold of Nuremberg or the\ndust of Nuremberg. But there was a tension, a very important tension that was created by the\nshift in our policy towards the Soviet Republic. In the fall of 1946, before the trial even\nbegan, our Secretary of State, James Byrnes\u201d\u2019 had made a speech at Stuttgart, in which he\nindicated that it was \u201cobvious to some people\u2019, quote, \u201csome people, that we were going to\nend up with a conflict with Russia \u2014 in a conflict with Russia,\u201d and he intimated that we\nwould certainly need the Germans on our side. Well, as Bill once characterized it, here was\nthe United States Government, sitting with this wet baby on its lap, that baby being the\nNuremberg trials. So we on the prosecution never knew from day to day whether or not the\nrug was going to be pulled out from under us and, until the indictment was served in the\nUnited States, could we draw free breath and know that the I. G. Farben case was going to\nactually take place. I think that that, incidentally, I think that the court might have been very\nsensitive to that fact, too, that instead of punishing these defendants we ought to welcome\ntheir expertise in the martial arts and in chemistry and in warfare generally.\n*\u00b0 James Francis Byrnes (1882-1972), Representative and Senator from South Carolina;\nSecretary of State 1945-1947.",
        "Q: What about the emotional toll of absorbing so much difficulty of the nation?\nBZ: I didn't get the question.",
        "Q: What about the, personally, what about the emotional toll of absorbing so much difficulty of\nthe nation?\nBZ: \u2014 Oh, there was a toll, there was a very, a very definite toll. I can't quantify it, but I had\nthought before I went there that I knew a great deal about the atrocities that had taken place, but it\nseemed to me that every day was a fresh revelation. I think that after a while, one became inured to\nit. I remember hearing myself say, it's hard to believe of me, but I remember one of the analysts\ncoming to me once with a story about experiments on five people and I said something unpleasant\nlike, \u201cWhy would you bring me a document about five people when we have documents which\ninvolve several hundred people,\u201d and that's a perfectly horrible kind of comment to make. When I\ncame home from Nuremberg, or shortly thereafter, a little girl fell in a well, I think it was in Texas,\nand this entire country held its breath until that child was retrieved. But a million little girls like that\nand boys were murdered by the Nazis and the fact is that the world did very little about it.",
        "Q: What about the results of the trial and\u2014\nBZ: Well, as I indicated before, there were, there was general acquittal on both the commission\nof aggressive war and on conspiracy to prepare and wage a war of aggression. There were sentences\nfor the misuse of civilians, slave labor, not for medical experiments, no convictions, and there were\nsentences for the plundering of the industries of the countries that the Nazis occupied because the I.\nG. Farben defendants walked\u2014marched \u2014 right along with Wehrmacht and took over all of the\nchemical factories of the country involved. If a company was viable, they put in their own\nmanagement. If the company was borderline financially, they dismantled the factory or laboratory\nand shipped it back to Germany. And that went on in country after country including Norway's\nhydro-electric installations, which were the largest in Europe at the time.",
        "Q: On these slave labor charges, wasn't there some defense in terms of the necessity of 1t?\nBZ: \u2014 Oh, yes, well, that was the defense throughout, as Bill explained. Either that they were\nordered to do it, or that they had to do it as a patriotic German when his country is at war. But it was\nalways the defense of superior orders and many of the defendants who were not convicted on the\nslave labor count, said they knew nothing about it. Well, we had memoranda from employees of I.\nG. Farben to the Board of Directors, explaining the necessity of having the SS guard there at all\ntimes. One of these memos said that the Belgians and the French are very surly. They don't say\nanything, but their looks are so hostile that it is better to have the SS guard there at all times. They\nwent on to say, and as far as the Jews are concerned, they are intolerable, just that. So that,\nnotwithstanding that, many members of the Board of Directors said they didn't see that memo, they\ndidn't see any of the memos on the injections that were being carried on, on any of the experiments\nwhether they involved injections or not. They didn't know about the poison gas.",
        "Q: Did it anger you to learn of the sentences, or lack thereof?\nBZ: \u2014 Oh, yes. Oh, yes, I was 1n the States at the time. There is a wonderful picture of which I do\nnot have a copy and that is the picture of the prosecutors as the decision is being read by\nShake, and they say a picture is worth a thousand words, you can see the shock and the\ndejection of Sprecher and DuBois and Amchen and the others, Linscott(ph). It was a very\ntelling picture. If the museum doesn't have it, 1t surely should get it, but of course I was just\nstunned by the decision. Then it was eventually \u2014 when it was reproduced, but I did get a\nletter from General Taylor saying that he was sure that I was disappointed and that they\nwere all disappointed but that he had felt that we had made an important contribution to\ninternational criminal law and to think of it in that respect. Then I received a full copy of the,\nof Hebert's dissenting opinion and that indicated that some of our work had struck fertile\nground, but it was a two to one opinion and both Shake and Morris were very provincial\npeople. I don't know how much they read or how much they studied, but they, from the\noutset, could not believe that these very respectable former businessmen could be guilty of\nsuch perversion.\nWZ: Just to include in your record: five or six statistical numbers, in the 12, in the 13 trials, the 12\nplus the International Military Tribunal, 199 were tried, there were 36 death sentences, 23\nlife sentences, 102 prison sentences, lesser than life, of course, and 38 acquittals. When we\nspeak of this disappointment in terms of the sentencing, the impression should not be\ngathered that there weren't any severe sentences put out. Now, of the 102 prison sentences,\nthat's where I believe that the Clemency Commission did their nefarious work. Obviously\nthe \u2014 those that had been hanged were beyond the mercies of the Clemency Commission\nand I don't know how many life sentences were reduced. I would think if any, it was a small\nnumber, but in the total number of prison sentences, that's where, in my own description, the\nClemency Commission opened the doors of the prison without consulting with counsel,\nwithout doing anything other than being appointed by the high commissioner and sitting for\neither 30 or 60 days and doing their job.\nAnd this was a job they were selected to do. For my own, for my own pleasure, I point out\nthat of the 33 judges \u2014 and we talked a little bit about whether or not they were carefully\nassigned to their particular cases, should have been more carefully considered. Of the 33\nAmerican judges, no Jewish judges. I don't resent that at all, I think it 1s good in terms of\nwhat they were trying, that there not be Jewish judges. There was no lack of Jews on the\nprosecution stand, but the way in which the Clemency Commission was selected, and I do\nbelieve that the chief judge, the acting chief judge among the three members of the\nClemency Commission was a Jew and maybe from the high commissioner's viewpoint, or\npossibly from Washington's viewpoint, I don't know, I wouldn't say Washington in this\nsituation, Harry Truman was the president. If indeed Judge Peck was Jewish, that was also a\ncarefully contrived political maneuver to ease the passage of something politically desired,\nyou see.",
        "Q: And do you feel that Cold War politics were part of this?\nBZ: Oh, unquestionably, unquestionably and that's all understandable, but Cold War politics or\nno, in my ken, that game should not have been played with these sentences, in the fashion in\nwhich it was played, because I don't think it was necessary. No matter what Jimmy Byrnes\nsaid in Stuttgart, I don't think it was necessary to get the Germans on our side in the Cold\nWar against Soviet Russia. It wasn't necessary.\nBZ: | May I say one more thing? In fairness, I must say that despite the Cold War politics and\ndespite the fact that it a gave the prosecution, the various prosecutions ulcers, the War Department\nheld fast until the last trial was over and I think that the war department deserves all the credit in the\nworld for that. We were so sure that they were going to pull the rug out from under us. There was\nnever the slightest indication from that quarter that they were going to do anything to diminish their\nsupport of the trials.\nWZ: Because of Harry Stimson, the Secretary of War.\nBZ: Well, he wasn't there at the end.\nWZ: Well, but Roosevelt, however he may be blameworthy in connection with concern with the\nJews of Europe during the war, Roosevelt was foursquare for the trial of war criminals. Harry\nTruman was foursquare for the trial of these criminals.\nBZ: Well, the State Department certainly wasn\u2019t. That's all, let's not pick a bone about it.",
        "Q: Let me ask you your feelings about a few people who were major players at this time, if you\nhad personal contact with them. Judge Jackson, Telford Taylor I think you both know.\nWZ: We both know Telford exceedingly well.",
        "Q: DuBois?\nWZ: Great friend of Belle's. He's dead now, but we became friendly, too, after the war, and I\nnever even discussed with him later on. We'd visit them at their home, they'd come up here and visit\nus and I never said, Joe, you really were a horse's behind with von der Hyde \u2014 look what has\nhappened\u2014\nBZ: Let's not get into that one episode.\nWZ: No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm saying we never did, you know. It just evaporated, it was an\nevent.",
        "Q: But what I'm asking is your feelings about the way some of these men conducted themselves\nand what affected the hearings.\nWZ: They did the best they could. Go ahead.\nBZ: Joe DuBois was a very fine administrator in the Treasury Department. He was an assistant\nGeneral Counsel, he established the War Refugee Board, which\u2014and administered it. And he had\nseveral, to use a common word, he had several tickets so far as administration was concerned. And\nit was necessary \u2014 the reason I recommended that he be brought over was because I felt that the\nprosecution, in preparing the case, was a headless horseman, with people going off on their own\nadventures so to speak. I'm not talking about black marketeering, non-case adventures, but where\nthe case was concerned they were going, they were making the decision as to what was important\nand what to do. Amchen had, in private life, and he had also worked for the government during the\nwar. He had been a trial lawyer and we certainly needed someone who had a great deal of trial\nexperience. Drexel Sprecher had been there from the beginning of the IMT to the very end after all\nthe trials were concluded. He still stayed to edit and publish these sets of books that you're aware of,\nso that he brought to the prosecution of I. G. Farben extraordinary knowledge of both procedure and\na feeling for individual responsibility. He was always very grateful to Bill for pointing out that we\nhad to \u2014 that it was all very well and good to lump all these men into one category under the theory\nof conspiracy, but that it was necessary to point out where they sat in the organization, what their\ninfluence was, what their domain was and what their peculiar liability was.",
        "Q: What about the leadership of Taylor?\nBZ: Well, Taylor was very good. He did, he could not cope with the mechanical problems any\nmore than anyone else could. His deputy was Tom Erbin, who really worked very hard to get staff,\nto get bodies, to get machinery that worked, that didn't break down, to adjudicate the impasses that\noccurred between rival teams for mimeographs and duplicating machines, such as they were,\nantiquated as they were. Pardon me, they were \u2014 it was a tough job, not to mention the fact that they\nwere dealing with, not all, but several prima donnas among the prosecutors. So it was, I'm sure that\nin my lifetime I've seen better administrations, but I don't think that Telford's great forte was that of\nadministrator, nor indeed was Tom Erbin\u2019s. He was an excellent administrator in private life, but the\ndifficulties were, a lot of them were just insurmountable.",
        "Q: What about moral leadership?\nBZ: \u2014 Oh, I think there was extraordinary moral leadership. I think that the morale, up until this\nCold War business, I think that Taylor could inspire great dedication, hard work and he could rally\npeople to the cause, without any question. Taylor's problem was that he was \u2014 most people\nconsidered him rather cold. And he was, Taylor was a scholar, he wasn\u2019t a hale fellow, well met. He\nhad his circle of friends, he was not a good politician, in other words. On the other hand, if you went\nto him with a problem or if you went to him and just said, as I did, \u201cThis is one monumental\nSNAFU and I have instructions to leave whenever I don't feel my services are being properly\nutilized,\u201d he could be very understanding, indeed, warm. And I have letters, which are extremely\nwarm, which he was not obliged to write at all, but also it should be noted that he was one of the\nmost eloquent men, both in writing and in speech, that I have ever met. I mean everyone talks about\nJackson's eloquence, particularly in his opening and closing statements which are really, I think will\ngo down in history with the Gettysburg address, they were that touching and powerful. I think that\nTelford was equally eloquent.\nWZ: May I get a word in here? First about DuBois. Joe DuBois can be canonized for his devotion\nto the Jews, for the fight that he made in the face of people like Rabbi Wise,\u00b0\u00b0 who wouldn't\napproach the President during the war to tell him what was going on. Like his counsel, his\npersonal counsel who was with him every day, Sam Rosenman, Barney Baruch, who sat on\nthe bench and could walk into the President's office, supposedly at any time. The effort that\nthe Jews made to bypass the State Department and get through to FDR 1s virtually this: it is\nnot a proud part in my book of the Jewish history. DuBois got through. DuBois and a few\n60 Stephen Samuel Wise (1874-1949), U.S. Rabbi and Zionist Leader.\nother non-Jewish lawyers in the Treasury Department managed to incite the Secretary of\nTreasury, Henry Morganthau,\u00b0' to demand that something be done and the War Refugee\nBoard was set up. My little set-to with DuBois about von der Hyde and Haberland\u2122 pales\ninto nothingness against the totality of Joe DuBois's contribution that I know of, to the good\npart of the war effort and Nuremberg. Telford, I must say for Telford, I've had, I was part of\nthe circle, you know, the circle of friends.\nWZ: Telford had an absolutely monumental administrative job, because although all of us who\nwere there, were there because we were interested in what we were doing, all of us, after all the\nyears of military service and so forth, had a whole kind of, a mass emotional problem, you know.\nWe'd been away from home...\nBZ: \u2014 Randy, before we conclude, I would like to read you one paragraph from Telford Taylor's\nfinal report to the Secretary of the Army, dated August 15, 1949. It was a report on the War Crimes\nTrials conducted, known as \u201cSubsequent Proceedings\u201d and I think it is a very useful summary. He\nsaid, \u201cImportant as is the concept of aggressive war and beneficent as the Hague and Geneva\nconventions may be, we can hardly expect much further judicial development and interpretation of\ncrimes against peace or war crimes, except of course in the unhappy event of another war. The\nconcept of crimes against humanity however, if it becomes an established part of international penal\nlaw, as it seems to be doing, will be of the greatest practical importance in peacetime, indeed it may\n\u2018| Henry Morgenthau (1891-1967), U.S. Secretary of Treasury 1934-1945.\n\u00a9 Ulrich Hablerland, head of Lower Rhine Betriebsgemeinschaft [company staff] in\n1943.

        "Q: Now I am going to ask you because we started to talk off camera, if you feel that your\nexperience with Nuremberg had any long term impacts on your life, on the way you think, on the\nway you live?\nBZ: Well, yes I do, I think that the Nuremberg principles stay with one. I think they cause one to\nbelieve that there is no higher dedication than dedication to peace and as irritating as we find the\nUnited Nations, I don't believe we have any other choice but to support it and if anyone can point\nout to me a better way, I certainly would be interested. It's interesting how much every citizen in not\nonly the United States, in the world, from the youngest to the oldest, from the religious to the non-\nreligious, prattle about peace and so few of us try to do anything concrete about it.

        "Q: I\u2014actually, why don\u2019t you talk to me about the impact it\u2019s had on you?\nWZ: This was an important event in the history of the twentieth century. My life, between 1915\nand wherever it goes from 1996, was encapsulated in the twentieth century. There were two wars. I\nremember as a small boy, being taken to a parade, watching the AEF, the American Expedition\nForce, march back in 1919, up Fifth Avenue. I was sensitive to that war. When I was four years old\nI wore a soldier\u2019s suit, which was modeled on the soldier's suits, the soldier's clothing in World War\nOne. I lived through the Twenties and the exaggerated responses to the first World War. I lived\nthrough, as a student and as an adult, the 1930s. I have been very well aware of every campaign for\nthe presidency since Al Smith ran against Herbert Hoover in 1928. This history is part of my life,\nthe history of the entire century and the Nuremberg part of it 1s one that is terribly important because\nI participated 1n it, to the extent of which I participated in the presidency of Jack Kennedy, in the\npolitical life of Bobby Kennedy and an awareness of Harry Truman, in trying to achieve a better\nsociety through politics, in which I was heavily engaged and so was Belle engaged. And a\nrealization now, at this age, about the beauty and the value of the life of a small child. Nuremberg 1s\nconnected with all of that. I see those children in the concentration camps, emaciated, frightened,\nwearing their clothes, I know how I want a child to look like and these things all fit a pattern you\nknow. I have no illusions about my contribution to this society, but I don't downgrade or demean\nany of \u2014 it's had great, great pleasures, it's had very difficult periods and periods of pain and they,\nthey're part of most anybody's life, including at that present time, when the people dear to you,\neither dying or very close and so on and so forth. Nuremberg was a thing that I'll look back upon\nwith a great deal of pleasure and I have no complications about it.\nI wish I could believe, because I know the importance of politics in everything that goes on\non this earth, I wish I could believe that those people are going to be picked up and taken to the\nHague and tried. If we don't do it, nobody else is going to do it. But I think it's, I see all of the\ndifficulties and all of the complications and if Nuremberg 1s less than either of us would have\nwanted it to be, so be it. But Nuremberg was important in my life and I think Nuremberg was\nimportant in Belle's life. Although she chooses to talk of the pain, well she recovered from the pain\nof Nuremberg. We all recover from pain. I had coronary bypass surgery 21 years ago and I've\nforgotten about it, but I haven't forgotten about Nuremberg.",

I mean we always had chores,\nfar more onerous than our children or our grandchildren. And aside from the work ethic, I can't\nthink of much. The first thing I heard about Germany, as I recall, was in high school. My father used\nto read the papers and he had family in Hungary. It was then \u2014 it had become Czechoslovakia\nduring World War One, but he had family and he was deeply concerned, as were most of the people\nwe knew, deeply concerned about Hitler. My mother had no family in Europe so that it didn't hit her\nquite as deeply as it hit my father, but she too was very concerned about what was happening to the\nJews in Europe. I can't say it was a daily topic of conversation. It was not until I got to Washington\nthat I became very immersed in Germany and in the war.",

        "Q: Actually, you bring up something that I guess I didn\u2019t ask Belle about. Was religion\nimportant in your family?\nWZ: Religion? Yes, my parents were Conservative Jews. During my school years I would go to\ngrammar school from nine until three. I would come home at three, I would have a snack and from\nfour to five I would play the violin, with my mother glaring at me to see that I was giving her a full\nhour, except for five minutes she allowed me to go to the bathroom. At six o'clock I went to Hebrew\nschool, the Harlem Hebrew Institute at 111th Street between Lexington and Park Avenue, and I\nspent two hours there each day. So that this was a full day of education for kids of that era and\neducation was the principally important thing in raising children of those years. I was Bar\nMitzvahed at the usual age, and gradually after Bar Mitzvah I worked my way out from under both\nthe violin and Hebrew instruction. I was finished with all of that. But we had in those terms with a\npretty full Hebrew education. As a matter of fact, I can probably sit here and write Yiddish while\nyou speak English, writing Yiddish and translating as we go along.

I'm sure that women were on a lower totem pole than men,\nbut there were certain men that came in for their disapproval also. Now the British, both in\nWashington and in London, were also inclined to be very supercilious, and they would argue a word\nin a proclamation or an ordinance. They would\u2014sorry \u2014 they would argue it to death I mean,\nwhether business should be called a concern or a corporation or an entity, and it would just go on for\nhours.

That was \u2014 I don't\nthink 1t was exclusively because \u2014 I don't think it was exclusively a female-male thing.

I had\ndone a draft of a trial memorandum but I'm wondering how many people on the trial team was\nfollowing it very rigidly, because frequently we would send off an analyst, say to Berlin document\ncenter because we felt that certain points we were going to make, needed some bolstering. And they\nwould go to Berlin and these people did work, but they would decide what they wanted to prove and\nthey would come back with documents which they considered really incriminatory, but they were\nnot the documents you sent them for. There were analysts, there were stenographers, there were\npeople to whom one gave documents already in one's possession and asked them to give you a\ndigest of them.

We found caches of documents at various individual\nfactories throughout Germany. After all, I.G. Farben had about 500 factories and owned\ninnumerable related establishments. And so we sent investigators into all of these establishments,\nlooking for evidence to plug a lot of holes that we had and\u2014\nWZ: But you're talking I. G. Farben, aren't you?\nBZ: \u2014 Right. And to supplement what we already had.",

        "Q: What was local reaction to the trials, from your perceptions, being over there?\nBZ: \u2014 That's a hard one for me.\nWZ: _ It's a forgettable part of history. When we make the turn into the twenty-first century and all\nthe remaining people in their nineties and so forth and the children of these concentration camp\nsurvivors also go deep into Social Security, I don't think the trial will have very much more\nsignificance than the Civil War, which will be that much older again, in terms of centuries. It's going\nto be forgotten. But the history 1s there.\nBZ: Of course, except for international law scholars.\nWZ: Yes, well, again \u2014 and they know what they have taken out or they'll be able to find out what\nthey have taken out in terms of international law. But look at another reason that I was not eager to\nget involved at the last gathering last March was because I know from the work that Belle was\ndoing that they were busy writing resolutions concerning the establishment of the International\nCriminal Court at the Hague as well as Bosnia and the apprehension of those war criminals, and so\non and so forth. And everybody was so involved emotionally and I'm involved emotionally, too, but\nI cannot escape from the politics of the situation and the difficulty of deciding to take these indicted\nwar criminals out of Bosnia and deliver them to the Hague if you are in effect the United States of\nAmerica. Because the most significant thing politically about the difference between Nuremberg\nand what we're doing now, or trying to do now, is the fact that we had won a war and these people\nwere our prisoners, these defendants were. There was no question of delivering any one of the\ndefendants to the dock in Nuremberg, you did it.",
        "Q: But what I was trying to ask you was, at the time of the trials, was there a local reaction?\nWZ: = In Germany\u2019?",
        "Q: Correct.\nWZ: Germany was so \u2014 what I saw of it, Nuremberg, Frankfurt, was so badly torn up and\ndevastated that the Germans wanted to have a bed to sleep in and they wanted to have a place to eat\nin and they wanted to have some food on the table and this was beyond their enmities. The enmities\nby and large evaporated with the end of the war. They had to survive; the problem was survival.\nAnd not only did we not interfere with their survival, with the Marshall Plan and money that we\npumped into Germany and the other devastated countries and Japan, we rebuilt their factories and\nput them on their feet, you see.\nBZ: They were hostile, they were hostile to the trials, naturally. That's a generalization, but\nneither Bill nor I are any tests of public opinion because we simply didn't deal with the public. We\nhave read accounts by Rebecca West and other journalists and reporters but we would not be able to\ngauge the German reaction at all.",

        "Q: What about the, personally, what about the emotional toll of absorbing so much difficulty of\nthe nation?\nBZ: \u2014 Oh, there was a toll, there was a very, a very definite toll. I can't quantify it, but I had\nthought before I went there that I knew a great deal about the atrocities that had taken place, but it\nseemed to me that every day was a fresh revelation. I think that after a while, one became inured to\nit. I remember hearing myself say, it's hard to believe of me, but I remember one of the analysts\ncoming to me once with a story about experiments on five people and I said something unpleasant\nlike, \u201cWhy would you bring me a document about five people when we have documents which\ninvolve several hundred people,\u201d and that's a perfectly horrible kind of comment to make. When I\ncame home from Nuremberg, or shortly thereafter, a little girl fell in a well, I think it was in Texas,\nand this entire country held its breath until that child was retrieved. But a million little girls like that\nand boys were murdered by the Nazis and the fact is that the world did very little about it.",
        "Q: What about the results of the trial and\u2014\nBZ: Well, as I indicated before, there were, there was general acquittal on both the commission\nof aggressive war and on conspiracy to prepare and wage a war of aggression. There were sentences\nfor the misuse of civilians, slave labor, not for medical experiments, no convictions, and there were\nsentences for the plundering of the industries of the countries that the Nazis occupied because the I.\nG.

        "Q: On these slave labor charges, wasn't there some defense in terms of the necessity of 1t?\nBZ: \u2014 Oh, yes, well, that was the defense throughout, as Bill explained. Either that they were\nordered to do it, or that they had to do it as a patriotic German when his country is at war. But it was\nalways the defense of superior orders and many of the defendants who were not convicted on the\nslave labor count, said they knew nothing about it. Well, we had memoranda from employees of I.\nG. Farben to the Board of Directors, explaining the necessity of having the SS guard there at all\ntimes. One of these memos said that the Belgians and the French are very surly. They don't say\nanything, but their looks are so hostile that it is better to have the SS guard there at all times. They\nwent on to say, and as far as the Jews are concerned, they are intolerable, just that. So that,\nnotwithstanding that, many members of the Board of Directors said they didn't see that memo, they\ndidn't see any of the memos on the injections that were being carried on, on any of the experiments\nwhether they involved injections or not. They didn't know about the poison gas.",
        "Q: Did it anger you to learn of the sentences, or lack thereof?\nBZ: \u2014 Oh, yes. Oh, yes, I was 1n the States at the time. There is a wonderful picture of which I do\nnot have a copy and that is the picture of the prosecutors as the decision is being read by",

        "Q: But what I'm asking is your feelings about the way some of these men conducted themselves\nand what affected the hearings.\nWZ: They did the best they could.

And he had\nseveral, to use a common word, he had several tickets so far as administration was concerned. And\nit was necessary \u2014 the reason I recommended that he be brought over was because I felt that the\nprosecution, in preparing the case, was a headless horseman, with people going off on their own\nadventures so to speak. I'm not talking about black marketeering, non-case adventures, but where\nthe case was concerned they were going, they were making the decision as to what was important\nand what to do.

        "Q: What about the leadership of Taylor?\nBZ: Well, Taylor was very good. He did, he could not cope with the mechanical problems any\nmore than anyone else could. His deputy was Tom Erbin, who really worked very hard to get staff,\nto get bodies, to get machinery that worked, that didn't break down, to adjudicate the impasses that\noccurred between rival teams for mimeographs and duplicating machines, such as they were,\nantiquated as they were. Pardon me, they were \u2014 it was a tough job, not to mention the fact that they\nwere dealing with, not all, but several prima donnas among the prosecutors. So it was, I'm sure that\nin my lifetime I've seen better administrations, but I don't think that Telford's great forte was that of\nadministrator, nor indeed was Tom Erbin\u2019s.

I think they cause one to\nbelieve that there is no higher dedication than dedication to peace and as irritating as we find the\nUnited Nations, I don't believe we have any other choice but to support it and if anyone can point\nout to me a better way, I certainly would be interested.

        "BZ: | Answer: My name is Belle Mayer Zeck. I was born in Port Henry, New York, on Lake\nChamplain. When I was about six years old, my family moved to Suffern, New York, here in\nRockland County. So I went all through the public schools in Suffern, attended Syracuse University\nand graduated from Fordham Law school in 1940.\nWZ: Tam William Allen Zeck, born March 3rd, 1915. I grew up on 110th Street between Fifth\nand Lennox Avenue, at the north end of Central Park. I attended grammar school,\nTownsend-Harris Hall High School, New York University in University Heights, and the\nNew York University Law School, from which I graduated from in June of 1936, and I have\nbeen a lawyer all of these years since then.\nup with. And also perhaps tell me a bit about why you decided to become a lawyer.\nBZ: Well, my parents were both immigrants \u2014 both came to this country, my father slightly\nbefore the turn of the century, my mother at the turn of the century. They were married here\nand my father was an upstate dairy farmer, but my parents had four children and one\ncouldn't make a living. For four children doing dairy farming, if you know anything about\nthe upstate New York or Vermont dairy farmers, they are very poor people. And so he came\nto Suffern and went into business, but always had a farm. I was the youngest, my eldest\nsibling was a lawyer and perhaps that unconsciously had some influence on my going to law\nschool. I was also a child of the Depression and it was quite clear, 1t was made quite clear to\nall of us that we had to earn a living when we got out of school. It was all right to go to\ncollege, but it had to be a purposive venture. And I was told that I couldn't be an actress. I\nwas also told I had no talent whatsoever as a teacher, so I kind of backed into the law,\nseemed to be all that was left for me.\nBZ: In my early years I can't remember any other than money, and I certainly was not\nimpoverished in the sense that I was helped a great deal with scholarship money towards tuition.\nAnd there were always people around me to see that I didn't starve. But things were very tight for\neverybody.\nWilliam McKinley was assassinated shortly after he got here. My father was in the coffee and tea\nbusiness. He used to import green coffee, blend it, roast it, package it, sell it both at wholesale and\nretail. The same also with tea. Not roasting or \u2014 but he would blend tea and sell tea, largely to retail\ncustomers. Our coffee roaster, at 110th Street, between Park and Madison Avenue, constantly\nspewed forth, every 20 minutes, a blast of wonderfully smelling coffee, which dispersed in the air,\nand it was the best advertising he could possibly do. It would spread over a period of about five\nblocks. We children were myself and two sisters. Belle talked about the discipline of hard work and\nthat was very much our discipline. If I had to specify an objective of my parents, both of them felt\nthat their three children, regardless of gender, should receive as much education as they could\nabsorb. So that \u2014 I told you about my college degrees; my older sister was a graduate of NYU at\nWashington Square. My youngest sister graduated from Hunter College and also got a Master\u2019s\nDegree in addition to her Bachelor\u2019s Degree. As far as the family beliefs are concerned, which I\ncertainly think was impounded into me, and it was the business of honesty, integrity. My mother\ntook care of all of the things she felt that she wanted in her children. My father wanted to be sure\nthat all of the family bills were paid, regularly paid, paid on time. I think things that kept him awake\nat night, if at all, other than possibly health factors, was getting his bills paid. And this was a very\nimportant discipline and challenge because we too went through the Depression years. During those\nyears I entered college at 19 in 1930 and graduated college and law school in 1936, but I worked\nregularly each day with my father in his business because he needed the help, so that this was the\nbasic influence, I think, that probably has carried me through this eighth or ninth decade of my life,\nwhichever it is. And the business of honesty and straight talking and integrity is something that I\nhave always looked for and felt and tried to practice, even in the business of politics, 1f you will.\ngripping your shirtsleeve here. |\nWZ:  I'msorry.\nmicrophone. You can't do that, that would be very helpful. |\nWZ: Ok.\nWZ: In Germany? Well, I did enter college in 1930, and Hitler was beginning to scratch around\nand make his presence felt in one fashion or another in 1931 and '32. Hindenberg! was in\ncharge at government, Hitler was pushing in that direction. I didn't know too much about the\npre-1930 period, during Hitler's Munich and post-Munich, because it wasn't part of any of\nmy studies, and I was very much involved both with the work I did at home and with my\ngreat desire to play shortstop for the New York Yankees and also be a member of the United\nStates Davis Cup tennis team, you see. But once we got into the college level in our history\ncourses and our political science courses, we knew what was happening in Germany, and it\nwas neither pleasant nor pleasurable; but actually, we didn't regard it as a great threat until in\nthe middle '30s we began to realize that the Hitler program was a definite threat to the Jews\nof Germany and when we began to realize also in the middle '30s his appetite for spreading\npan-Germanism, we began to be very unhappy about what was happening in Germany.\n' Paul von Hindenburg (1847-1934), President of the Weimar Republic.\nBelle, as she told you, had some family left in Hungary. As far as I knew, none of my\nfather's family \u2014 he was the youngest child \u2014 came here in 1900, so we didn't have any\nfamily that I knew of in Europe and we didn't have that to concern us. My music was very\nimportant in our home. Under duress I studied the violin for six years. Both my sisters\nplayed the piano. My mother had a lovely singing voice and we did a good deal of singing\nand so forth. Music's been very important to us. My father used to buy numbers of \u2014 he\nloved the Italian tenors, particularly Caruso,\u201d and he loved some beautiful tenors who were\ncantors. We had all kinds of music in the house during that period.\nWZ: Yes, yes. As a matter of fact, I had five years of French. French was the language we all\nstudied then, but I had a year of German in college and between the German and the English, I\nmanaged to get along in Nuremberg. Not if I was interrogating a witness, not without the presence\nof an interpreter, a translator, but I do understand a good deal of the language, yeah.\nschool you went to Washington?\nBZ: \u2014 Well, two years after I graduated from law school, I went to work in the General Counsel's\nOffice of the United States Treasury and the General Counsel, then Randolf Poll(ph),\nassigned me to a fairly new bureau called Foreign Funds Control. It was in charge of\nadministering the Trading With the Enemy act. And that act, of course, as you know,\nforbade all communications, transmittals, remittances \u2014 any dealing whatsoever \u2014 with\nGermany. Then, as Germany successively occupied Austria, Poland, Scandinavia, the\nBenelux countries, and France, with each invasion the Trading With the Enemy act was\nextended to that country, so that by 1941, before I got to the Treasury, all of Europe and\nBritain was fairly well \u2014 it was insulated to the extent that we could insulate them, to the\nextent that we could prevent Hitler from getting any use of Germany's external assets. Those\nexternal assets, I may tell you, were mainly held by I.G. Farben, the giant chemical\ncompany which had offices and factories all over the world \u2014 certainly in every major\ncapital of the world \u2014 and I. G. was, they were consummate artists at camouflaging their\nholdings. They had had a bad experience in the first World War where several assets which\nthey had in this country had been vested by the Alien Property Custodian. So beginning as\nearly as 1936, they made a \u2014 they began a concerted effort to transfer out any holdings\nwhich they had here into the names of nominees who would cloak their assets for them. I\nwas, in the course of my work at Foreign Funds, I was assigned to the investigation of\nGerman assets in this country, specifically General Analine and Film, which was, I think,\ntheir largest holding in this country.\nBut they had so many other participations and holdings in so many companies, I won't recite\nthem all. And then they, if they didn't own three nominees, through Americans, through\nSwiss, if they didn't own controlling or majority interest in companies, they had\narrangements with American companies such as Standard Oil of New Jersey. And they\nformed new corporations with nominees for their half interests and with the other half being\nheld by the American company, mainly Standard Oil. I started to say that it was \u2014 that where\nthey didn't have a direct or indirect participation \u2014 they had cartel arrangements with some\nof the leading companies in this country which permitted them the use of patents in Europe\nand, of course, in the first instance it was difficult to prove, as I said, because of all these\ncloaking arrangements, pooling agreements, option agreements, and these sophisticated\nfinancial devices. It was difficult to prove ownership. Once we did though \u2014 and this was\nslightly before the Alien Property Custodian's office was established in the Justice\nDepartment \u2014 once the Treasury felt it had a very strong case and once it had penetrated\nthese layers and layers of nominees and cloaks, then the property was vested initially in the\nTreasury and then the Alien Property Custodian would do the vest and foreign funds control,\nwhich would just continue to freeze assets wherever we could show that they were\nbeneficially controlled by the Germans. [end of side 1, tape 1]\nworks good, you look great.] You were talking about collecting information on I. G. Farben 's\nassets. How did you go about that?\nBZ: Well, Treasury had, to begin with, lists of known German concerns in this country, possibly\nnot just from World War One, but from the ordinary sources, ordinary commercial sources\nand of course, it became more a matter not of identifying the company, but of proving that it\nwas German because by then they had been transferring shares. I mean, we knew the\nGeneral Analine and Film had once been a German company, but now these shares were in\nthe hands of Swiss nominees and the management was American.\nBZ: We sent investigators into these companies and examined their stock books, their transfer\nbooks, their books of account, and then we investigated the nominal share holders of the\ncompany. In the case of General Analine and Film, we found very useful memorandum\nwhen the army occupied Germany and Bernstein's cartel in finance division went into the\nFarben administration building and brought back to Washington documents that I will tell\nyou about in a moment. We found a memorandum from von Knieriem\u2019, the general council\nof I. G., to the members of the Vorstand* \u2014 that is, the managing board of directors of the\ncompany \u2014 outlining specifically, precisely what they were going to do to cloak their\nAmerican holdings in the United States. And as I said before they used very diverse means,\nvery intricate fiscal stratagems and combinations of stratagems. But we had teams of\ninvestigators \u2014 this is before we learned so much from the investigators \u2014 on the ground in\nGermany. We had teams of investigators at the Treasury who were out in the field\ninvestigating in the banks, investigating banking transactions involving the Germans and\ncompanies and factories all over.\nBZ: \u2014 I personally supervised the investigation of I.G. Farben's largest firm in this country,\nGeneral Analine and Film, and I wrote the investigative report, with our conclusions.\naffecting anything. Okay, that's probably all it was. I'm sorry. |\nBZ: Well, that's it.\nBZ: \u2014 Then, well, take for example this investigative report. It would go from the General Counsel\nto others in the Treasury and they either would vest the company or they would ask the\n3 August von Knieriem, member of Central Committee of Farben\u2019s Board of Directors.\n* Board of directors (German).\nJustice Department, the Alien Property Custodian to vest it. But much \u2014 and then after\nabout, towards the end of '42, the Justice Department started its own investigations. They\nhad investigating teams in the field, too, because, of course, they were preparing for trial and\nthat required much finer tuning than our investigative reports represented. Then a former\nAssistant Secretary of the Treasury, Bernard Bernstein, who was drafted in 1942, became\nEisenhower's \u2014 General Eisenhower's financial aide in North Africa and in addition to his\nduties in North Africa, he tried to find out everybody in the North African theater who had\nTreasury experience or banking experience, because he was already paving the way for our\noccupation of Germany. He then sent us a telegram, well we didn't have telegrams, we had\nwhat we call TWXs,\u00b0 where the Pentagon would summon you to a TWX conference and\nBernstein would be on the other end of the Telex \u2014 it was more comparable to that. They\ncalled it TWX and he would ask me, in this particular instance, he asked me to send him the\nnames of likely personnel for his operation, which I did in conjunction with help from the\nCivil Affairs Division of the War Department. These men, when we did occupy Germany,\nthey went into mainly the Farben administration building in Frankfurt, that was in the\nAmerican zone, and they just took every document that was visible or that they could find in\nany cabinet. They put them in gunnysacks, they brought them back to the United States to\nthe Treasury, and on the basis of those \u2014 and then there was intensive work on the\ndocuments, because some related to war crimes, some didn't. Some related \u2014 were of great\nconcern to the Senate committee investigating wartime production and the conduct of our\nown businesses during the Hitler period, vis-a-vis their German counterparts.\n> Telegraphic message, interchangeable with Telex. Jennifer Mossman, ed., /nitialisms\nand Abbreviations Dictionary (Detroit: Gale Research Inc., 1992), s.v. \u201cTWX.\u201d\nSo that all of this did culminate in a way in the reports I discussed with you which\nrepresented the testtmony of Colonel Bernstein and Major General Hildering(ph), the head\nof Civil Affairs, before the Senate committees in December of 1944. And hundreds of these\ndocuments were annexed in a separate volume to the main report. The main report being a\nPart Seven of the Senate subcommittee hearings and the exhibits in Part 10.\nworked. You don\u2019t need to show me papers, I just want you to explain to me that involvement.\nBZ: They were investigating our mobilization for war, directed by Senator Harley Kilgore\u00ae of\nWest Virginia. As a matter of fact I think the hearings were called \u201cMobilization for War.\u201d\nThey were also investigating the extent to which American industry helped, contributed to\nHitler's war machine, before and during the war. The Treasury also, of necessity, had to do\ninvestigations in South America because it was through South America, through Buenos\nAires, largely, and Ecuador and, well, I said Argentina and Rio, that a lot of trans-shipments\nwere made. Goods which originated in the United States were sent to South America,\nostensibly to non-German firms, which in turn sold them to German subsidiaries in South\nAmerica and they were trans-shipped back to the continent. Does that give you an idea?\nBZ: \u2014 That's right, that's right. And also helping the division of cartels and the finance division of\nmilitary government in Germany.\neffort underway to try to get a handle on companies, like I. G. Farben so that\u2014\nBZ: Yes.\nBZ: Yes, in the early stages of the occupation, there was a concerted effort at decartelization,\nwhich was breaking up these huge, these mammoth industries which had really had its roots\nin every country of Europe, and to a certain extent they were successful. After Nuremberg,\nmaybe Bill will talk later about the Clemency Commission, but Krupp\u2019 was not only put\nback together again, but they were given all their assets back. Farben was, I. G. Farben was\nbroken up.\nWZ: There was a special decartelization branch in OMGUS,\u2019 in the Office of Military\nGovernment in Berlin, and they did a great deal of investigative work and I think a great\ndeal of work under General Clay\u2019 to break up the German cartels. I did some work,\ntangentially of what Belle's describing, in Washington with the Board of Economic Warfare.\nI was in the General Counsel's office there for several months before I went into the army.\nAnd some of the work I did related to Lend Lease, I was a member of our interdepartmental\nland lease committee. And one of the things Belle just mentioned, relating to the trans-\nshipment of American goods into South America, we were sending, under land lease, goods\n\u2019 Krupp, after industrialist Gustav Krupp and his son and heir Alfred Krupp von Bohlen\nund Halbach (1907-1967).\n\u2019 Office of Military Government, United States\n* General Lucius D. Clay\nto England. And England was trans-shipping some of our land lease goods \u2014 intended for\nthem and for the war effort \u2014 trans-shipping them to South America to protect their markets.\nAnd quietly a fuss was raised about it by us, and I'm sure the land lease department and\nfinally the foreign officer \u2014 what was his name, Belle \u2014 issued a white paper out of London,\ndiscontinuing the practice and explaining that practice. I did some related work at BEW'\u201d as\nwell, in connection with the seizure of patents. I was assigned the business of writing an\nexecutive order for President Roosevelt, directing the seizure of enemy owned patents,\npursuant to the Trading With the Enemy act, which you mentioned. Also there, I worked on\nestablishing the curriculum for the school for military government. This was in the early\ndays of the war, but there would be a time when we were going to be the occupying power\nand so we established a school at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, indicating the\nprocesses and the tactics and the legalities of the work that we would be performing as an\noccupying power. If, God-willing, we got to that point, you know. And also I knew, with not\nthe great amount of detail that Belle did, about I. G. Farben, whose influence concerned not\nonly the Treasury Department but the antitrust division of the Department of Justice \u2014 our\nagency as well. Because I think it was very plain that as the war was developing or\u2014\n[interrupted by ringing telephone].\n' Board of Economic Welfare\nBZ: \u2014 Bill was talking about these cartels and I'd like to say a word about this. Cartels are not\nbusinesses, they're arrangements or agreements which divide up markets, fix prices, control\nproduction. The way this is done is through the use of patents. Now, Standard Oil of New\nJersey is a good example. It had had long-standing alliances with I. G. Farben, which went\nback to World War One, and they not only had these cartel arrangements but they had joint\nownership of about 10 companies in this country other than General Analine and Film,\nwhich I mentioned. In the \u201820s, Standard Oil agreed to give I. G. Farben the patents and\ndistribution rights for the production of synthetic gasoline. They were way ahead in terms of\nresearch, way ahead of I. G. Farben. In return, they were \u2014 and the right to the European\nmarket, where synthetic gasoline was badly needed. In return, they were supposed to get not\nonly the patents for the development of synthetic rubber, but they were supposed to get\nwhatever know-how I. G. Farben had in the production of synthetic rubber. All of our\nrubber came from Malaysia, 90 percent of it, and when the Japs attacked, the Japanese\nattacked us at Pearl Harbor, we found our rubber markets cut off completely. In the\nmeantime \u2014 and the perniciousness of these cartels becomes apparent when you realize that\nfrom, oh, the middle '20s, to as late as 1938, Standard Oil kept pressing Farben to give them\nthose patents and to give them what know-how they had, because whenever our own rubber\ncompanies, Goodyear and Firestone for example, tried to do research in producing synthetic\nrubber, Standard Oil would say to them, \u201cOh, now, don't spend the money. We have this in\nthe bag, we're going to get them; it's just that they're having a little trouble with Hitler.\u201d\nWell, we never did get them, but in the meantime in 1936, when all these preparations for\nwar were being made by I. G. Farben in conjunction with the German Wehrmacht,'! the\nFarben people filed thousands of applications for patents with the United States Patent\nOffice on their own. And of course they were accepted. Every single combination of\nelements known, they would file a patent on just to be sure that no one else could touch any\none of the fields in which they wanted to be pre-eminent. So we had critical shortages, we\nhad shortages in tungsten and in carbides and 1n nitrates and ironically, completely aside\nfrom the synthetic rubber deal, a lot of this critical war material was being shipped to South\nAmerica for eventual transmittal to Germany. I. G. Farben, I really don't like the fact that we\nalways identify it as a chemicals concern. Everybody knows of its size, but I don't think\npeople know how far afield Farben was from say, pharmaceuticals. For example, all during\nthe '30s, Farben produced 90% of the gun powder, and certainly during the war they\nproduced 95% of the explosives that were used by the German army.\nThere isn't a single bomb that could have been launched without the I. G. Farben explosives.\nThey made the treads for the tanks, they were in synthetics; there wasn't, I can't think really\nof a piece of equipment, of armament to which Farben had not contributed a vital part. So\nthat Hitler could not have possibly waged war without them because all Germany had was\ncoal and I. G. Farben's chemists, who Joe DuBois!\u201d who was the head of the Farben trial\nteam, called the devil's chemist,!\u2019 which they could not translate. They could take the coal\nand mix it with water and air and make all of these synthetics. So that \u2014 and what they could\n'! Armed Forces (German).\n'2 Josiah DuBois, Jr., Deputy Chief Counsel for the United States.\n'5 The interviewee is referring to DuBois\u2019s book The Devil\u2019s Chemists.\nnot make, because they were Germany's largest source of foreign exchange and hard\ncurrencies, namely dollars and Swiss francs, they got from their far flung enterprises. They\nknew what, the I. G. Farben people knew what Hitler was all about. They were responsible\nfor his rise to power. They attended a meeting in, at the invitation of Goering'* and\nKrauch,!\u00b0 one of the defendants.\nThey attended a meeting at Goering's house in February of 1933, early 1933. That is a very\nsignificant meeting; Flick'\u00ae and Krupp were there too. It's a significant meeting because just\nbefore that, just a few months before, the Nazis had been badly beaten in the elections. Then\ncame this meeting and Hitler spoke at great length, I have the translation here; it's not a very\ngood translation either, but Hitler spoke for well over an hour, two hours and in it he\noutlined very clearly his plans for Germany. He said that Germany's destiny was\ninextricably intertwined with that of a strong man. He went further, he said that it was only\nthrough military conquest that Germany had ever been great, led by a strong man. He talked\na little about \u2014 for Hitler half an hour was little \u2014 he talked about the threat of communism,\nand of course that was the big bogie man for German industry as it has been for industry\neverywhere. And he magnified the communist threat enormously. In fact later, when the\nNazis burned down the Reichstag,'\u2019 they blamed it on some poor homeless man who they\nclaimed he set the fire. He was a mentally incompetent, but they claimed it was a communist\n'4 Hermann Goering (1893-1946); Commander-in-Chief of Luftwaffe, President of\nReichstag, Hitler\u2019s designated successor.\n'S Carl Krauch (1887-1968), Nazi Military Economy Leader and professor of chemistry.\n'6 Friedrich Flick (1883-1972), industrialist and Nazi supporter.\n'7 Parliament (German).\nplot to burn down the Reichstag, all of which history proved to be incorrect. However, back\nto the meeting. The \u2014 I. G. Farben ended up making the largest contribution of the night \u2014\n400,000 Deutschmarks, which, let' say at the rate of four to one would be over a million and\na half dollars back in 1933, was a stunning contribution. However, one of our judges said,\n\u201cWell, we have fund raising for our people, too. There's nothing wrong with politicians and\nfund raising.\u201d However, after that meeting, Farben directors approached Hitler to find out\nwhat his attitude was towards their experiments with synthetic gasoline and synthetic rubber\nand when Hitler said that it was indispensable to his future plans and gave them the go\nahead, they then, the Farben directors, persuaded von Hindenburg to resign and made Hitler\nChancellor of Germany.\nEnd of Tape One\nTape Two\nBZ: [Td like to go back to what I was talking about.\nBZ: _ I'd like to go back there. I was talking about what Farben had done in the way of stockpiling\nfor Hitler and critical war material, about their supplying him with foreign exchange to buy\nthat which he didn't have or couldn't produce in Germany, but all and also to show its\nworldwide influence, but it still didn't impress one of our judges who was reported to have\nsaid that he couldn't see the difference between I. G. Farben and our own Dupont. Well, we\nwere not\u2014incidentally, I could have told him the difference between I. G. Farben and\nDupont. I could have told him the difference between German industry and American\nindustry because German industry was his enthusiastic partner for a decade before he ever\nstarted his wars, whereas in the United States, even after Pearl Harbor, Franklin Roosevelt\nhad to bribe our businesses to convert to war production by way of tax breaks and tax\nincentives. To get back, we felt that we had to show the size of I. G. Farben and demonstrate\nits worldwide influence for the purpose of indicating what a necessary partner they were to\nthe entire Nazi enterprise, and I would just like to quote a few, two short sentences from\nTelford Taylor,'\u00ae who was our chief counsel of the subsequent proceedings. From the\nopening of the Flick case \u2014 Flick was the coal baron \u2014 he said, \u201cAt the threshold of this case\nand because of its unusual character, it is vital that these principles be clearly understood.\n'8 Telford Taylor (1908-), American Chief of Counsel for War Crimes at Nuremberg.\nThe defendants were powerful and wealthy men of history \u2014 of industry\u2019? \u2014 (pardon me),\nbut that is not their crime. We do not seek here to reform the economic structure of the\nworld or to raise the standard of living. We seek rather, to confirm and revitalize the\nordinary standards of human behavior embodied in the law of nations.\u201d So I think if you\nhave any more questions, this was I. G. Farben preparing for war. Then there came a point\nwhen I. G. Farben decided to build its fourth synthetic rubber plant at Auschwitz. They did\nit because of the availability of cheap labor in the form of concentration camp inmates. It is\nestimated that in the construction of this enormous plant, in the construction alone, 25,000\nworkers died. These workers were very, very badly treated and the plant was run with the\nhelp of the SS. In other words, there were SS guards in every part of the factory. Not only\nthat, but the SS brought the concentration camp inmates from Auschwitz to the factory\nevery day and I. G. Farben gave them receipts. They paid them, they paid the SS a dollar per\nman, a dollar a day, 75 cents for a woman and 50 cents for a healthy child, the child that\ncould work. Then the SS complained that 1t was too dangerous to move these people over\nsuch a long road, that there was a danger that they could escape, no matter how many guards\nthey put on. So Farben, in conjunction with the SS, recommended that Birkenau be built. It\nwas closer to Auschwitz proper and they built the crematorium, the gas chambers and the\ncrematorium right into the building so that after the inmates, and there were French and\nBelgian and Gypsies there, so that after they were gassed, their bodies could be disposed of\nimmediately in the ovens. That's why Birkenau has always been referred to as the four\n'\u00b0 Tt should be clear that the interviewee corrected herself and meant to quote the word\n\u201cindustry\u201d and not \u201chistory.\u201d\nchimneys or five chimneys of Auschwitz. In fact it was the title of the book by Olga\nLengyel.\u201d\u00b0\nBut to get back to the slave labor operation, the longest sentence meted out on the slave\nlabor count was seven years and another defendant got four years and two other defendants\ngot two years, which was the one part of the decision that I could not rationalize in any way,\nshape, or form. It was just a very arbitrary thing and then of course, all of the sentences were\ncommuted by McCloy\u2019s Clemency Commission, which Bill may want to talk about later.\neven know how you got there.\nBZ: \u2014 I'm sorry.\nthat right?\nBZ: Yes, yes, in 1944, 1945, I went to London as US Treasury representative in London and my\nassignment was to work on the legislation which the occupying forces would enact in Germany, if\nand when they established an occupation government in Germany. And I had worked on that to\nsome extent in interdepartmental committees in Washington and then it became an intergovernment\nthing in London.\nBZ: \u2014 At that time, the commission, which had been set up by the \u2014 well, the London agreement\nwas being promulgated, in which the Allied powers dedicated themselves to the punishment\n0 The book mentioned by the interviewee is called Five Chimneys.\nof war criminals, and they were also drafting the charter, pursuant to which the trials were\nconducted. And I did not participate in that but I was very aware of their proceedings and\nwould from time to time report to the treasury about it, in the diplomatic pouch.\nBZ: Well, I had difficulty getting a passport to go to London in the first place. But the Secretary\nof the Treasury, who was having his own battles with the State Department, really didn't know me\nat all, decided to make it a cause c\u00e9lebre, the State Department couldn't tell him who to send to\nLondon, or anywhere else, and he prevailed. There weren't, in retrospect, there weren't difficulties.\nThose, what difficulties I had as a result of gender, religion, perhaps age, I had after the war; I had\nafter the war when I tried to get a job at Chase Bank in their foreign exchange, foreign trade section\nand I couldn't even get an interview.\nWZ: After I finished my military service, in January of 1946, I guess, I knew about the\nNuremberg trials. I had been in uniform as an aide-de-camp to General Don E. Scott(ph)\nwhen the requisition came through for military people interested in going to Nuremberg.\nBecause we were just before the end of the war, the General said to me, \u201cBill, if you want to\ngo to Nuremberg, I will let you go now. I will report you.\u201d And I said, \u201cGeneral, I want to\ngo to Nuremberg, but I want to get out of the uniform first,\u201d because I'd been away from\nhome for six years and so it took a few extra months. When I did get out as a civilian, the\nonly job I was interested in getting was a job in Nuremberg. I went to the Pentagon, I met\nTelford Taylor, who was still a colonel there and beginning to recruit for subsequent\nproceedings, subsequent trials. And I was promptly hired and went over there in March of\n1946.\nWZ: I was eager to go to Nuremberg because \u2014 and not only eager to go to Nuremberg, but eager\nto work on an I. G. Farben trial, because I'd had contact with it in my work at the Board of\nEconomic Welfare before I got into the Army. I was \u2014 I think being Jewish certainly had\nsomething to do with my eagerness to go there and since I had really been out for well over\nsomewhere between four and six years, I had no law practice to go back to and I was\ninterested in going to federal government again, and this seemed the place to do it and to do,\nbe part of the prosecution. So I went over there and what I found there was a few quick\nobservations I made. All of the people working on the IMT case \u2014 and just to set the time for\nit, this was the end of March of 1946 and the IMT trial ended in September of 1946. The\npeople working on the prosecution staff were virtually all in uniform, either Army or Air\nForce or Navy. The people who worked subsequent proceedings were all, excuse me,\nformer military people now in civilian mufti. And I went over with the first group of lawyers\nhired for subsequent proceedings and there were 12 of us on the ship which interestingly\nwas called the General Taylor, but apparently it wasn't named after Telford Taylor. When I\nreceived a call to report to the port to get on the ship I was told that the ship is the USS\nGeneral Taylor and I said, \u201cOh, my goodness, has he received a promotion,\u201d you know,\nbecause he'd been Colonel Taylor, but obviously it was a different Taylor. In any event, we\nformed a very close knit group on that victory ship. There were also some women going\nover as stenographers. There were a few former Germans who were going over as\ntranslators. We talked about the obvious things, things we'd been doing in recent years and\nwhat we hoped to do when we got over there. When we did get over there, there wasn't very\nmuch for us to do because the IMT trial was on, everybody working was concerned with it.\nWe didn't know whether there would be a second international trial of industrialists, but my\ninterest, Telford's interest certainly was, in beginning to research for one kind of a trial or\nanother involving the I. G. Farben people. I did sit in for a number of days between April\nand June on the IMT case, became familiar with the identities of the defendants, the people\nin the dock, also trying to get organized with respect to I. G. Farben. There were then only\ntwo of us who wanted to work the I. G. Farben case. One was a lawyer from Virginia named\nJim Heath,\u201d who'd been a railroad lawyer, whose father had been the counsel to the\nSouthern Railroad. And we knew, the thing we did know as background matter was Bell's\nreport to the Kilgore Committee, which was Part seven of that series of documents, and we\nalso had a Part 10 which detailed in narrative form some of the exhibits that they used. And\nthen we began looking for documents because we had reason to believe that there was an I.\nG. Farben document center in Frankfurt. There were German documents in Berlin. All of\nthese were captured documents. And there was one, what was the name of that little town\noutside of Frankfurt, Belle? Down by, no, down by Hoechst? No, I'll think of it. In any\nevent, went to all of those places, couldn't find significant I.G. documents. By the time June\narrived, it seemed reasonably clear that we wouldn't have a second international trial,\nalthough Telford was not sure of it and I'd exhausted all the possible sources of Kilgore\ndocuments. So we decided that I'd go to Washington to look for Kilgore documents because\nthe people on that investigating committee were Justice people, Treasury people, War\nDepartment people \u2014 a limited number. And he said, \u201cWhile you're there, while you're\nlooking for those documents, please open a document center in the Pentagon for the high\ncommand and general staff on military cases and also on SS cases.\u201d And he said, \u201cwhen you\n71 James E. Heath; Chief Counsel for the Farben trial team during its initial stages of\npreparation.\nget there, you can work with Mickey Marcus, Colonel David Marcus, who is the head of the\nWar Crimes Branch of the War Department.\u201d So I worked with Mickey, you know who\nColonel Marcus was, he was the West Point graduate who went over to Israel and was shot\nbecause he didn't know the password or tell the password. He was a very colorful figure,\nboth in Jewish lore and in military lore.\nHe was a lawyer who was buried up at West Point, who also after Telford, went back after\nhis hiring the first 12, did the interviewing and the hiring for the remaining civilian lawyers\nwho went over to Nuremberg. So in the months of July and August we hired a staff, did the\nnecessary work to collect all of those military and SS documents in the Pentagon, and then I\nwent to my first love, which was to find the I. G. Farben documents. So I took the\nintroduction to Part seven and I spoke with every one of the Kilgore people. There were I\nthink seven or eight of them I talked to, trying to avoid talking to Miss Belle Mayer, who\nwrote the report, you know. Oh, they didn't know where the documents were, but I damn\nwell better talk to Belle Mayer. I was not very fond of lady lawyers at that particular point in\nmy life, so I called over to the treasury shortly, at the end of August, and a lawyer named\nBob Scott answered her telephone and he said, \u201cYes, this is where she works, but she's in\nColorado now on vacation. She'll be back after Labor Day.\u201d So the Friday after Labor Day I\ncalled, she answered the phone, I went over there, and we met. And I told her my tale of\nwoe and said, \u201cWhat can you tell me?\u201d In despair I said, \u201c\u201cWhat can you tell me about the I.\nG. Farben documents, Miss Mayer?\u201d So she pulled open 12 file drawers and she said,\n\u201cThese are the I. G. Farben documents, at least the Kilgore documents.\u201d So I looked at this\ntall, blonde girl, had a lot of suntan from her vacation and I said, with a new look in my eye\nI said, \u201cMiss Mayer, you are a wondrous lady. I'll send over here for these documents from\nthe Pentagon.\u201d [end of side 1, tape 2]\nWZ: _ It's not confusing, it's just a matter of timing and we'll do, as far as I'm concerned, you call\nthe shots here. I'll tell you what you want to hear.\n(indecipherable). Wait just a minute. Hold it a minute. Okay, Bill, maybe you'll continue on.\nWZ: Belle said to me in no uncertain terms, \u201c\u201cYou can't have these documents.\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cWe need\nthem. We need them desperately for trial. How can we prepare for trial?\u2019 And she said to\nme, \u201cI don't think you people would know how to use these documents,\u201d you know, in\nconnection with the business of how this young woman was treated over in government, you\nknow. She was giving me back some of what she undoubtedly faced herself. Well, she\nworked it out that the Treasury Department would work overtime over the weekend and\nphotostat the documents if I could assure her that the War Department would reimburse the\nTreasury Department for the extra cost and I assured her that we could. And I left\nWashington on Friday and I came back on Monday morning and there, sitting in four or five\nlarge gunnysacks, were the Xeroxed copies of the precious documents. So I telephoned her\npromptly \u2014 I had to get back to Nuremberg because they were about to issue the decision in\nthe IMT case, I certainly wanted to be present.\nI called her and said, \u201cThank you for the documents Miss Mayer. Can I take you to dinner?\u201d\nAnd her response was, \u201cThe bill for overtime is 47 dollars and you're committed to having\nthe War Department send us a check?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, the War Department will send you a\ncheck.\u201d We had dinner and I went back with the gunnysacks on Wednesday, back to\nNuremberg. Now it was very clear that we were going to have an I. G. Farben trial and it\nwould be conducted by the United States. No other powers in this case; we were going alone\non this case and we desperately needed people to staff the prosecution. So the first thing I\ntried to do was get Belle, and we were having these telecons\u201d* each week and Belle began\nto, I guess she began to think about coming over, although the first I realized was when she\nwas asking me on the telecon how much we would pay her, what her classification would\nbe, because she would have to transfer from the Treasury Department to the War\nDepartment and that kind of bureaucratic nonsense, you know. She wanted a raise above her\npresent salary and Jim Heath said, \u201cWell, let her have it,\u201d and I said, \u201cHell no, she's not\ngoing to get paid any more than we're getting paid.\u201d She came over, in any event, she came\nover in early November, I think. And she promptly went after several of her colleagues in\nTreasury who she felt would be useful here and one of them was Josiah DuBois, who came\nover and became the head of the whole trial team. And he put her to work drawing the\nindictment, which she did largely all by herself. At the same time, I had a special project set\nup in Frankfurt with a Paul Dencker, who was the chief bookkeeper of I. G. Farben, and I\nwas pumping him over a number of days for information about the work activity of each of\n2 Teleconferences.\nthese members of the Vorstand, so that we had curriculum vitae on all of them from\nDencker. And I came back from there, Belle worked on the indictment, and shortly after that\nI realized that I would not probably be able to function with the new hierarchy of\nprosecutors on the I. G. Farben case, because Joe DuBois had decided \u2014 he had seen a\npicture of an ugly SOB in an SS uniform, who somehow worked for I. G. Farben in some\ncapacity, named von der Hyde\u201d? and he said, \u201cI've got to have this man in the dock,\u201d and I\nsaid, \u201cThe man doesn't belong in our dock because of the careful selection we've made with\nrespect to background.\u201d\u2019 Every member in the dock was a member of the Vorstand.\nWZ: I decided that with all the work and effort I put into this thing, with the care with which I'd\nselected the individual defendants, developed their backgrounds through quizzing and\ninterrogating Dencker, and with the theory, the legal theory I had established with respect to\nthe individual responsibility of each of the Vorstand members. When Joe DuBois arrived\nfrom the United States of America \u2014 and I don't know what, if any background he had on I.\nG.; Belle had a lot of background. I didn't know what DuBois's background was, but that\ndidn't matter if all he could see himself doing, fresh off a plane, on the basis of a photograph\nhe saw, was make an arbitrary decision to replace a vulnerable defendant with a guy in an\nSS uniform, I figured that I'd had enough, you know. Belle was there, there was a new team,\nanother one arrived while I was busy interrogating in Frankfurt, in the coldest winter they'd\n3 Erich von der Hyde, Member of Political Economy Department.\nseen in a hundred years, a man came in off a plane named Morris Amchen, and he looked\naround and he saw what I was doing, and he said have I examined their income tax returns?\nSo I figured this was another one who was going to brighten my life as I try to proceed with\nthis prosecution. I decided to go home. Before I went home, I was asked to serve as the\ncounsel to the court in the Justice case; the Justice case was a marvelous case. You saw the\nbones of it in the movie Justice at Nuremberg. They structured that, the story, in terms of the\nJustice case and I was being pushed by a dear friend, Charlie LaFollette,** who was the chief\nprosecutor in that case, to come with that court. Telford Taylor called me on the telephone\nand he said, \u201cBill, with all the work you've done, why don't you stay and help put the case\ninto court?\u201d And I said, \u201cTelford, I am going home, period.\u201d So I went home, and I brooded\nall \u2014 for the rest of the year and finally decided to sit down and make my contribution to\nNuremberg, in the form of that article in the North Carolina law Journal. But my Nuremberg\nwork breaks off at this point, so that I think Belle better carry it forward.\nWZ: Go ahead, sure.\nyou talked about individual responsibility. Was there some overriding principle that needed to apply\nin your mind when you chose these people?\n4 Charles LaFollette (1890-1974); Representative from Indiana, Deputy Chief Counsel\nfor War Crimes at Nuremberg in 1947.\nWZ: Well, number one, you had to be able to indicate that these people were involved and\nimportantly involved in making policy and in their functioning together with the Hitler people,\ntogether with Goering, who was in charge of the, not the four year plan, what was it?\nBZ: Yes, he was.\nWZ: Incharge of the four year plan. You had to know what their activities were in the company\nand they were as varied in I. G. Farben as the 12 \u2014 the defendants in the 12 different cases \u2014 the 12\nindividual cases were. But all of these coagulated in our minds anyway in terms of their contribution\nto the war, you see. Now these Vorstand people were, some were chemists, some were engineers,\nthere's a couple of lawyers, some were salespeople, whose activities were involved in foreign\ndiplomacy.\nBZ: \u2014 Spying.\nWZ: Spying for the Nazis, sure. But we had all of these things set up and as a lawyer, we had to\ndo it that way. You couldn't just use a broad brush and decide because a man was on the Vorstand,\nwe'll put him in the dock. It wasn't that kind of thing, we had background, we had information, we\nhad evidence on all of these people.\nthey really didn't have any alternative, so that when you interrogated them and you had some\ndocumentation when you did interrogate, I think you could expect for them to tell you the truth,\nparticularly since they all had one defense: Superior orders\u2014we had to do it because Hitler ordered\nit or we had to do it because the head of the company ordered it, you see. But you still didn\u2019t make a\ncase that requires individual knowledge and individual acquiescence and responsibility, without\nproving that the individual defendant did know what he was doing and did willingly collaborate\nwith the Hitler government.\nWZ: I think, of the people that I interrogated, basically my useful interrogation on I. G. Farben\nwas with this bookkeeper Paul Dencker. And Dencker was a mousy little man with a\nmustache, who may have weighed about 147 pounds soaking wet. And he sat very\nsubmissively and referred to me as \u201cHerr Doktor,\u201d\u201d> you know, and he answered my\nquestions and I would question him about Krauch and about Schmitz\u201d\u00b0 and about\nSchnitzler?\u2019 and about Heinrich Mann,\u201d\u00ae and all the other people in the dock, what did they\ndo. And he knew what they all did, what their assignments were and so forth. He had a vast\nknowledge and I was fortunate to have Dencker, and I think you people knew of Dencker\nbecause I first saw his name in one of your reports, Belle. But then I went home and turned\nI. G. Farben, the prosecution, over to the tender mercies of Belle Mayer and Joe DuBois and\nI guess Drex Sprecher?\u201d became involved in the case too.\n5 Doctor (German).\n6 Hermann Schmitz, Chairman of I.G. Farben\u2019s Board of Directors.\n717 Georg von Schnitzler, Chairman of Farben\u2019s Board of Directors.\n8 Wilhelm Mann, Chairman of Farben\u2019s Board of Directors.\n9 Drexel A. Sprecher, Assistant Trial Counsel for the United States at Nuremberg.\nWZ:  I'msure I did, some of them. At this particular moment I am hard pressed to remember\nwhich. I think you may gather, at this point, with my departure, that there's a certain philosophical\nrejection of that part of the I. G. Farben prosecution that followed my departure. They were in good\nhands.\nWZ: Right.\nobserver there. What was, can you describe for me what it was like to be in that courtroom?\nWZ: During most of the time that early summer and late spring, the trial was being conducted by\na man who later became United States Senator Thomas J. Dodd.*\" He was a little white-\nhaired man with a round belly, and he was the least likely American impression of a great\ntrial lawyer, but he stuck it out you see, until many people, there were many who came there\nwith reputations, who came to Nuremberg, stayed a week, who were well known back\nhome, who were using this Nuremberg adventure, to which they contributed very little, for\npolitical purposes and to dress up their curriculum vitae(ph), you know. There were many of\nthose. There were a number of very competent young people, like my old colleague Tom\nLambert of the BEW, who was a naval officer at the time and a number of others who made\na contribution, worked hard and did make a contribution and then went home. Everybody\nwanted to get home. All the people in uniform wanted to get home.\n30 Thomas Dodd (1907-1971); Senator from Connecticut; Executive Trial Counsel, U.S.\nCounsel at Nuremberg.\nWZ: The atmosphere in the courtroom \u2014 number one in the dock was Hermann Goering; in\npolitical terms, the head of the whole team. And he was leaning over the \u2014 like I'm leaning\nover the edge of this table, you know, appearing disinterested. Generally, he had his own\nidea about where this was going and he knew what was going to happen. At the other end, at\nthe far end from Goering was sitting Mr. Schacht,*' Hjalmar Schacht. Schacht did not look\nahead. Schacht sat with his back, if this was the dock, Staccato was sitting here and looking\nout in this direction. Across from where I'm sitting would be the well of the courtroom, with\nthe lawyers and parallel to this, on the other side, were the judges. The legal staffs were off\nat one end and you have the twenty two people in the dock and each had a particular\ndifferent face and different approach. You had the disgusting pig of a man, who was the\npublisher of a dirty magazine, Der Stiirmer, you know, Julius Streicher.** You had the two\nmilitary leaders, Jodl** and Keitel** and they were wearing uniforms that hadn't been\npressed that morning for sure. You had the two naval leaders, Raeder*> and the guy who\u2014\nBZ: \u2014 Jodl?\nWZ: No, no. Raeder and the one who succeeded Hitler. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n31 Hyalmar Schact (1897-1970), President of the Reichsbank.\n2 Julius Streicher (1882-1946), Founder and Editor-in-Chief of Der Sturmer.\n3 Alfred Jodl (1890-1946); Chief of Operations Staff of the High Command of the\nGerman Armed forces, 1939-1945.\n4 Wilhelm Keitel (1882-1946), General Field Marshall and Chief of Staff of the German\nArmed Forces, 1938-1945.\n5 Erich Raeder (1876-1960), Grand Admiral and Commander in Chief of German Navy.\nWZ: Iknow his\u2014\nWZ: I know his name like\u2014\nBZ: Doenitz?\u00b0\u00b0\nWZ: Pardon?\nBZ: \u2014Doenitz?\nWZ: Doenitz, that's right, Karl Doenitz. You had the Nazi philosopher Rosenberg,*\u2019 you had the\nguy who looked like he was left with half a brain, Rudolf Hoess,** whose look never\nchanged. He just sat there looking out like this. You had people like von Papen,*\u201d the\ndiplomat, who was well-controlled, who also was acquitted. You had the butchers, Hans\nFrank,*\u00b0 who was the Gauleiter*! of Poland, who was a prominent Catholic and who said,\nquote, \u201cIf Germany lives for 1000 years, it will never be able to atone for what it's done to\nthe Jews.\u201d A few others, I would have to look, yeah. But that was it and it went along in\nvery desultory fashion. Now I was not there when this happened, but one of the spectacular\nparts of the trial was when Goering testified, and when Goering testified, because this was\nthe piece de resistance, our chief prosecutor, who delivered most wonderful opening and\nclosing addresses with magnificent prose, came in to cross-examine Goering. And he wasn't\n6 Karl Doenitz (1891-1980), Commander in Chief of German Navy and Hitler\u2019s\ndesignated successor.\n7 Alfred Rosenberg (1893-1946), Hitler\u2019s mentor and semi-official philosopher of Nazi\nparty.\n8 Rudolph Hoess (1900-1947); Commandant of Auschwitz, 1940-1943.\n*\u00b0 Franz von Papen (1879-1969), Reich Chancellor in 1932 and Hitler\u2019s Deputy\nChancellor.\n\u00a9 Hans Frank (1900-1946), Nazi party jurist and Governor-General of Poland during\nWorld War II.\n+! Term used for head of a Nazi administrative district (German).\nwell-prepared for the kind of stuff he was getting from Goering, and the press was reporting\nthat very sharply and in abundance, so that after a day or two of Justice Jackson,\u201d the\nBritish were called in to put some semblance of usefulness into this cross examination of\nGoering. And that was done by Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, who had just become the Attorney\nGeneral. That was it. There was a lot of \u2014 so there was a lot of sitting and time was passing\nduring the Tom Dodd period and the trial was just \u2014 much of the stuff, the documentation\npart of it, didn't have any fireworks, you see, because under the rules established, every\ndocument had to be translated into four languages and document books, with respect to each\ndefendant, had to be delivered in advance to the defendant's counsel. And so it was a very\nslow and quite tedious process. But the reason really, the basis for the convictions was very\nmuch more the documentation than the interrogation of the witnesses. The witnesses all\nsaid, superior orders, Hitler ordered it, we had to do it. But the Germans, this is generally\nknown, were absolutely wonderful document keepers, you know. They loved nothing better\nthan General Ohlendorf* reporting each day in the Einsatzgruppen documents in the village\nof wherever, \u201cWe shot 167 Jews, 72 Gypsies, a dozen or so Communists,\u201d and so forth. And\nthese, even at the level of the industrialists, in terms of their production, in terms of the\nconferences and the work they did for the Nazi government, were very well recorded.\nformal\u2014\n\u201d Robert Jackson (1892-1954), United States Chief Prosecutor at the International\nMilitary Tribunal.\n4 Otto Ohlendorf (1908-1951), Head of Nazi Security Service.\nWZ: Sure, the German prosecutors \u2014 or the German defense counsel for example, were carefully\nselected from what was available then in Germany and they did their job as best they could, within\nthe limits of what the court was receiving. The court was receiving their statements with respect to\nsuperior orders, you know, and the court treated with it accordingly. I don't \u2014 now I don't think they\nwere delivering spectacular justifications of what happened in Nazi Germany. Many of the\ndefendants, for example the, what's the name, youth leader and the one\u2014\nBZ: \u2014 von Shirach.*\nWZ: \u2014 von Shirach and the one who died about two years ago\u2014\nBZ: \u2014 Speer.\u201d\nWZ: Speer, Albert Speer. He said, \u201cWe really didn't know what was going on in the\nconcentration camps,\u201d you know. They did plead lack of knowledge of what happened, what went\non in the concentration camps. The most wonderful\u2014\n\u201c Baldur von Schirach (1907-1974), Reich youth leader and Governor of Vienna during\nWWI.\n+ Albert Speer(1905-1981), Reich Minister for War Production from 1942 to 1945.\nTape Three\nWZ: The lawyers, from day to day, they showed no animus, but they, yes, they showed no\nanimus. They were doing a job, but it's a job they wanted to do. And it was a job that in most cases\nwas predicated upon their idealism with respect to, particularly in this case, achieving justice. That,\nyes.\nBZ: Well, I want to say first one thing in self defense. Bill made it sound as if my reluctance to\ngo to Nuremberg was predicated on mercenary grounds and it was not. I did ask for a raise\nin salary, but that was very incidental to the proposition that Schacht and Funk*\u00ae had been\nacquitted and I knew that it was going to be very hard to convince judges that these nice\nlooking businessmen, these important businessmen, could be guilty of the heinous crimes\nthat they committed. What did Funk have, a few, some years? But anyway \u2014 and Speer got\nsome years, but the economics people\u2014\nWZ: Speer got 20 years.\nBZ: None of the economics people were sentenced to death or anywhere near it, and 1t was\nbecause if these leaders of the economic life of the country had got such light sentences,\nthen I couldn't see them going after these men who looked like businessmen, talked like\nbusinessmen, and were really murderers. I haven't even got into poison gas, or gotten into\nmedical experiments for which four of the Farben defendants were convicted and again\ngiven very light sentences. The medical experiments which the United States Holocaust\n46 Walther Funk (1890-1960); Minister of Economic Affairs, 1937-1945.\nMuseum has so well documented, I won't go into them, but the Farben people sent quantities\nof serums to be tested on concentration camp inmates. They were injected with various\ntyphus and typhoid serums, which were experimental.\nThey were subjected to atmospheric pressure experiments where the inmates not only died\nbut they, their brains exploded; they died in incredible agony. And our court could give you\nan example of what, for want of a more elegant word, I will call nit-picking \u2014 took the word\nVersuch,*\u2019 V-e-r-s-u-c-h, and in its decision the court wrote, the prosecution claims, I'm\nparaphrasing, the prosecution claims that that means experiment. The defendants claim that\nit means test. In a criminal case, we must give the favor of the doubt to the defendants. Now\nif anyone can tell me the difference between experiment and test, I'd be glad to hear it.\nFarben also manufactured the poison gas, the Zyklon B, and the serum and the Sarin and the\nTabun which were used to exterminate the concentration camp inmates, knowing full well\nthe purposes for which it was going to be used, because these were volatile gases and only I.\nG. Farben, only their technicians, could control the incidence of the gas, the volatility of it.\nAside from that, though, I do think this \u2014 again going back to the prosecution, that we came\nfrom very diverse walks of life and obviously very different exposures. But by and large, all\nof the lawyers were, as Bill said, very idealistic, very knowledgeable about the atrocities\ncommitted by Hitler and other people in the Third Reich and determined to mete out justice.\n47 Experiment, trial, or test (German).\nMany of us felt as the British felt in London \u2014 that the crimes that these people had\ncommitted had been repeated so often and were of such common knowledge that the courts\nshould take res adjudicata*\u00ae of some of these events and acts that had been publicized on a\nworldwide basis. Take judicial notice of the fact that they were committed, without the\nnecessity of these very labored proofs. And that's where the trials bogged down, because as\na result of the problems in the IMT, they'll also mention that the subsequent proceedings\nwere conducted under the charter, that was the substantive law, but because of the terrible\nproblems of the translation and the reproduction of documents, the subsequent proceedings\nwere conducted under Allied Control Counsel law number 10, which said, in effect, that if\nan original document could not be produced, that a Photostat might be used. That if it were\nimpossible to authenticate a particular document, if the authenticating party was dead or\nmissing or couldn't be located, that proof of the source of that document would make it\neligible for admission into evidence. In other words, the rules of evidence were ameliorated\nbecause of physical exigencies, while our, the Farben court, our judges, went back to the\nbasic rules of the evidence, Anglo-Saxon rules, would not permit in evidence any document\nthat hadn't been authenticated and reauthenticated. In fact, if I may be personal, and we've\nbeen very personal here, this was the only continuing brawl I had with my colleagues at\nNuremberg. The case of von Schnitzler is a good point, is a good example. The\ninvestigating group that had initially gone into Germany had taken several depositions of\n8A matter adjudged; a thing or matter decided by judgment. Rule that a final judgment\nrendered by a court of competent jurisdiction on the merits is conclusive as to the rights\nof the parties and their privies, and, as to them, constitutes an absolute bar to a\nsubsequent action involving the same claim, demand, or cause of action.\u201d Henry Campell\nBlack, M.A. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (St. Paul: West Publishing Co., 1983) s.v. \u201cres\nadjudicata.\u201d\nvon Schnitzler in which he bared his breasts, so to speak, in which he said yes. They\ndescribed he was the first person to describe the meeting of February 1933, in which I. G.\nFarben had cast its lot with Hitler. He was the first person to say, once we got the assurances\nthat our plans for developing synthetic oil and synthetic rubber were very much to Hitler's\nliking, we then supported him in every possible way. And these depositions of his were\npretty lengthy. Well, somebody on our trial staff said, \u201cOh, you can't introduce this\ndocument because of some technical flaw,\u201d very minor and so Drex Sprecher went back and\nhe again examined von Schnitzler after all these years, after von Schnitzler had been sitting\nin jail, talking to his former colleagues and undoubtedly taking a beating from them for the\ncandor with which he had spoken two years earlier.\nAnd he said, he didn't exactly retract but he said that he didn't know what he was saying\nbecause he said \u2014 now I'm quoting, \u201cI was terribly\u201d (quote) \u201cdepressed at the time.\u201d He\nrecanted. Eventually Drex went back to him and he finally said, \u201cWhat I initially told those\npeople in Frankfurt in 1944 or '45, I forget which was the truth.\u201d\u2019 But I mean this constant\nrevisiting of a document \u2014 don't forget that in the Farben case, over 2000 documents were\nintroduced. That doesn't include the interrogations of the defendants and of other employees\nof I. G. Farben, who had written very damning memos to the board of directors. So I would\nlike to comment on something else, because I don't think that young people today, even\nlawyers, can begin to visualize the mechanical difficulties under which we were operating.\nWe did not have modern Xerox machines, copying machines; we had these old photo\ncopiers, which were a wet process and they had to, you had to use this thin copy paper\nwhich came out and curled at the edges. Now we were required to give the defendants\u2019\ncopies of all of our exhibits 24 hours in advance of their introduction. This called for a very\nstrict trmetable. In the meantime the mimeograph people \u2014 I didn't mean photocopying, I\nmeant mimeographing. The mimeograph people were working double shifts, but even so,\nthey couldn't handle this volume of business. We never were able to get things from them on\ntime. Instead of having our own duplicating machines, we had to rely on this pen. The\nmimeograph \u2014 pen is not the right word for it but \u2014 they were 1n isolation and somebody\nwould hand them something, it could be a Rand McNally atlas with a hundred pages of\ncharts. We also had to assist the defendants 1n locating things they considered material to\ntheir defense, which they did not have the means to locate, so that half the time we were\nworking for the defendants, assisting them. I felt these were the only brawls we had, that we\nwere leaning backwards to show how fair we were being. Charles LaFollette, whom Bill\nmentioned, the former congressman from Indiana \u2014 Bill described his role in the case, the\nJustice case and against the judges, the people's court.\nLaFollette said that, once said jestingly, but with great weariness, that he had always thought\nthat the aim of the trials was to punish the prosecution and all that the trials were doing was\nkilling, to punish the defendants. But all they were doing was killing the prosecution, and\nthere was a lot of truth in that. In fact, we had, I think what the prosecution was lacking, if I\nmay be as frank as Bill, I think that what we were lacking was top-notch trial counsel. This\nis in retrospect. I think if we had had some good homicide lawyers over there, we might\nhave made a more telling case. As it was, we did have some trial lawyers who came with\ngood reputations for advocacy, who left, because these were people, no matter how\nprimitive our technical equipment, these were people who were used to pushing a button\nand summoning a staff who would immediately respond. Our typewriters were antiquated,\nmaking carbon copies, 25 of every single thing that was done, was just back-breaking. And\nso we had trial lawyers who just would not stay because they could not operate in this very\nfrustrating milieu.\nWZ: We did use Germans. The Germans were eager to work because they would get a decent\nration, you know, and they weren't in policy positions. They did mechanical work, you\nknow. And they mounted mechanical work required, you can gather from Belle's\ndescription, of the movement of the document from a cave in which it was uncovered by the\narmy and its intended use by an attorney after the document had been translated, and so on\nand so forth. And then it had to be gotten into the hands of the defendant. It was a very,\nvery, very difficult operation. I must say this, I don't intend really to sound sour on the\nNuremberg activity, regardless of how I felt and why I left when I did. Three things I think\nmust be mentioned: Number one, the law we established, which provided that a head of the\ngovernment could be prosecuted as a war criminal, was brand new. Nobody ever thought of\ntrying the Kaiser\u2019? or I don't want to speak about Napoleon because it escapes me at the\nmoment, but that is now accepted international law. Number two, with respect to superior\norders, it has always been, in the American order of battle, that you obeyed the order of the\nsuperior officer and if that superior were a corporal or a sergeant or a captain or a general,\nhis order was sacrosanct. As a result of Nuremberg, our order of battle was changed to\nprovide you had to obey only the lawful order of a superior officer. So now, even the private\nis invested with a policy gene. He has to obey what he's ordered to do, but not if he's ordered\nto kill babies and defenseless people, as happened in the Lieutenant Calley case in...\nBZ: \u2014 Vietnam.\nWZ: Vietnam. So those two things, and perhaps the most important thing \u2014 and I certainly did not\ngo to Nuremberg for the purpose of creating a history. I went to Nuremberg with the\npurpose of establishing certain law with respect to initiating and waging aggressive war.\nAnd I don't feel that we were successful, basically, in that respect, but we established a\n* Emperor (German).\nhistory and all the skinheads that can be collected on anywhere and all the naysayers have to\nface the history, the transcripts of the Nuremberg trials, the volumes \u2014 several different sets\nof volumes, the first one on the IMT, a terrible volume, 42 of them, the blue back, and so\nforth.\nBut this kind of thing \u2014 and mine is not a document recital \u2014 but those compilations, which\nlargely Drex Sprecher was the head of editing and gathering, that's been Sprech\u2019s career,\nreally have been on file in European countries and in libraries and the Library of Congress,\nof course, and in law libraries all over the United States of America. And that is not policy\nstuff, that's historical fact. Fortunately most of it\u2019s supplied by documents maintained by the\nGermans themselves. So that to me is the warming aspect of my recollection of Nuremberg.\nIt was a terrible place in which to work and if when they didn't pay attention to you, you\nformed a softball team and you played out where Hitler used to conduct his meetings in the,\nwhat was the\u2014\nBZ: \u2014 Sportpalast(ph).\nWZ: Sportpalast, yeah. And you sat around and you talked and you talked about many, many\nthings, but you did an enormous amount of reading of documents and so forth. And \u2014 but\nthe history of Nuremberg is something that pleases me very much. It was worth all the \u2014\nthere was a good deal of agony involved in doing that work over there, no question about it.\nSo I'm glad I was associated with it.\nBZ: \u2014 And it certainly is the answer to the revisionists.\nBZ: No. In anon-assignment fashion. I would talk to people in the DP camps, but I was severely\nhandicapped in that sense. I could not speak Yiddish and no one could understand my German. I\nthought I was pretty good at German, but nobody could understand it. I have a terrible accent in\neverything. As a matter of fact the only way I could talk to people in the DP camps and particularly\nto the children was in my baby Hungarian, because you'd always find a Hungarian Jew who could\ntranslate for you. And my discussions with them rarely bordered on their experiences because the\nkind of evidence we could use had to be really in-depth kind of probe.\nBZ: \u2014 Before the trial, yes. I was involved with this same von Schnitzler we've been talking about\nand with Ilgner.\u00b0\u00b0 Now many of our defendants were very dignified people whose bearing\nand whose looks and whose speech were not lost upon the court, believe me. But then there\nwere other defendants who were really rather loathsome, including one whom I interrogated,\nMax II gner, and he was the chief salesman of the group and he had salesmen throughout the\nworld, but his salesmen in South America were called Verbingsdungsmanner\u201d! and they\nwere, they became spies for the German government. It's interesting to me that every place\nwe went in Germany was full of documentation, but there were two special groups in Berlin\nwhich dealt directly with the Wehrmacht, (the German army), and exclusively with them.\nAnd one was called the Vermittlungsstelle\u00b0\u2019, which was the headquarters of these salesmen.\nAnd they reported, the bureau in Berlin reported directly to the German high command. And\n\u00b0\u00b0 Max IIgner, I.G. Farben Director.\n>! Middleman, contact (German).\n\u00b0\u00b0 Agency (German).\nthey, 1t was that bureau whose records were all destroyed, before the United States and\nAllied advance in 1944. And there was another bureau which dealt directly with the army\nand with the intelligence people and that was called VOWI,>? V-O-W-L, and their records\nwere destroyed. So I did interrogate this salesman and asked him what happened to the\ndocuments, to try to find out, and he protested mightily against being examined by a girl and\nhe said that he had been humiliated a lot by everything that had gone on since the war's end,\nbut the worst humiliation he'd ever had to face was being interrogated by a female.\nsort of describe what was going on, what it felt like, and any particularly interesting aspects of it.\nBZ: Well, there were three judges and an alternate sitting at the side, facing the defendants on a\nraised kind of platform and opposite there were 21 chairs in the dock. And incidentally, Bill\nwas talking about the selection of the defendants before \u2014 we could have selected 50\ndefendants worthy of the title but there were only 21 chairs so the prosecution was limited in\nthat respect. And they were on either side to the front of the courtroom and beneath them on\na long table, a long, almost platform-y kind of apparatus, were the interpreters and the\nstenographers and in front \u2014 that was on one side \u2014 on the other side, in front of the dock\nwere the defendants counsel, who were numerous. I don't think that, I'm sure that every\ndefendant didn't have his private lawyer, but there were several defense lawyers, some like\nDix,>* represented four or five defendants, others just represented one. But and then there\n3 Volkswirtschaftliche Abteikung, or Political Economy Office (German).\n4 Dr. Rudolph Dix, Hermann Schmitz\u2019s Defense Counsel.\nwas the prosecution table, fairly close to the judges\u2019 dais, but more toward the center of the\nroom, and they had a table. Why the defense counsels\u2019 table wasn't alongside, I don't know\n\u2014 maybe so they could talk to their clients more readily. Then behind the table at which the\ndefense counsel were sitting were the chairs for the audience. The Farben case had a big\npress there, pardon me. Then in the gallery, in a balcony, there were observers, ordinary\npeople who wanted to see the trial and the witnesses were kept in a separate room off the\ncourtroom. There are many pictures of the courtroom and particularly of the Farben defense.\nBZ: Well, it was a little nerve-wracking because the thing that made it worse was that \u2014 were the\nobjections of defense counsel, which would come rattling into your earphones while you\nwere trying to make a point. And after a while I decided that if I were going to get anything\naccomplished, I'd better put my earphones down and not listen to them, which is something\nI should not have said in public. But the Chief Justice, Curtis Shake*> was very, very polite\nto me and there again maybe my sex helped me because I sure didn't get the lectures that\nsome of the men got, nor was I a party to some of their brawls. I think the judges all,\nwhether they were sympathetic to the prosecution or not \u2014 and none of them were\nsympathetic except for Paul Hebert>\u00b0, the dean of Louisiana State Law School, of Louisiana\nLaw School. He was the only person who seemed to understand what the prosecution was\n\u00b0> Curtis Grover Shake, Presiding Judge, International Military Tribunal.\n\u00b06 Paul Macarius Hebert, Judge, International Military Tribunal.\ndoing and was sympathetic. But the other three\u2014well, Merrell\u2019 doesn't count, but Shake\nand Morris\u00b0\u00ae were unfailingly courteous to me. Now, I left after the first count\u2014Crimes\nAgainst Peace \u2014 which we discussed in great detail, after that was put in, I did not stay for\nthe rest of the case, but I followed the case for a number of years, best I could and got letters\nfrequently from Nuremberg and we had some friends on the New York Times. When they'd\nget back from Germany, they would bring me up to date, but there were brawls that were\nreported in the newspapers, in the New York Times and in other publications. For example,\nJudge Morris at one point asked Drexel Sprecher how many more documents he intended to\nput in and Drex said ,\u201c*500,\u201d and Morris just plain had a fit. He said, \u201cWe're going to be here\nfor another year\u201d and, \u201c\u201cWhy can't you curtail your evidence?\u201d and \u201cYou're bringing in\neverything including the kitchen bathtub.\u201d And he really reamed Drex out in a very\ninjudicial manner.\nBZ: \u2014 It was not good because of what I told you before, that one of the judges was reported to\nhave said that he couldn't see the difference between I. G. Farben and Dupont and that not only\ncaused, was not calculated to lift up people's morale, but I decided or I felt that it would be a good\nidea if we didn't lead off with Crimes Against Peace and lead off with all these innumerable charts\nshowing I. G. Farben's organization and particularly where the defendants that Bill had so much to\ndo with, where they fit into the hierarchy, whether it was manufacturing or sales or administration or\n*7 Clarence F. Merrell, Alternate Judge, International Military Tribunal.\n8 James Morris, Judge, International Military Tribunal.\nwhere. I think it might have been better if we had led off with Slave Labor or some of these\natrocities which might have created some interest in Morris. It would have been extremely difficult\nbut that was the sort of thing that would throw you off base and you'd have discussions about it until\nall hours. Discussions of strategy and how to cope with a couple of the judges, who were obviously\nhostile. Then again I might have had an advantage, Randy, not only because of my sex but I might\nhave had an advantage in that I was one of the first to lead off with a presentation of the\nprosecution's case, so that their patience might have been in better shape at that time.\nWZ: I think, and this is all in retrospect, on the political side, I hadn't any idea how the judges\nwere selected to sit on particular cases. I know generally that the way the judges were selected here\nin the United States. The chief judge of the United States Supreme Court refused to let any\nSupreme Court judges come over, he refused to let any District Court judges to come over, so that\nyou really got a potpourri of people from various states of the country. However, just as cautious as\nwe were in the selection of the prosecution staff for I. G. Farben, for example, and I think basically\nfor better or worse, we felt that the best people we were getting would go to I. G. Farben and the\nother industrialist cases, if those lawyers wanted to work those cases you see. There should have\nbeen some technique for evaluating which judges were better prepared to serve on an I. G. Farben\ncase, for example. Paul Hebert belonged there, Morris of North Dakota, obviously didn't belong\nthere and you know, I'm speaking without knowing any of these people but from what I've heard.\nThat part of the process was faulty, but if you suggested that to Telford Taylor, he would possibly\nsay, \u201cLook at what we had to do to get a document translated,\u201d you know, and delivered to the\ndefendant and so on and so forth. And of course it was very, very \u2014 the difficulty in the whole\noperation, having sat on the Supreme Court of New York for 10 years myself and having since my\nretirement spent a good deal of time looking at the two because nobody wants anyone of any age to\ngo to his grave without having sat 500 hours watching the O. J. Simpson case, you know. The\nselection of judges is part of the function of an administrative judge, who ought to know his people\nand their backgrounds and their predilections sufficiently to assign them sensibly to cases. This was\nbeyond comprehension in Nuremberg and probably beyond having being able to work out. But I\ndon't know what kind of curriculum vitae Telford Taylor had with respect to each of the 33 judges\nwho came over, but it would seem to me that somebody made these assignments and I can only\nassume that they were made on a helter-skelter basis, which was unfortunate.\nBZ: That's true, they were picked on the basis of their volunteering to go. Now, that didn't mean\nthat we didn't have some very good judges. Out of our personal knowledge, I think that we\ncould name them. And when I say good judge, I don't mean that they should have been\ngiven the litmus test for whether they were for the prosecution or against the prosecution. I\nthink, though, that they did require a degree of sophistication. I feel they should have had\nbackground on the whole German gestalt, the whole German business. If nothing else, the\nrise of Hitler, what he did, who he was, how he succeeded in taking over an entire continent\nand how he almost succeeded in taking over the rest of the world.\nWZ: And what kind of work these judges did as lawyers, what their backgrounds were.\nBZ: And how skillful they were in handling a trial of this really great significance, great\nimportance.\nTape Four\nBZ: We talked a great deal about the tensions created by the difficulties of the place we were\nworking in. Incidentally, I haven't even mentioned the freezing cold of Nuremberg or the\ndust of Nuremberg. But there was a tension, a very important tension that was created by the\nshift in our policy towards the Soviet Republic. In the fall of 1946, before the trial even\nbegan, our Secretary of State, James Byrnes\u201d\u2019 had made a speech at Stuttgart, in which he\nindicated that it was \u201cobvious to some people\u2019, quote, \u201csome people, that we were going to\nend up with a conflict with Russia \u2014 in a conflict with Russia,\u201d and he intimated that we\nwould certainly need the Germans on our side. Well, as Bill once characterized it, here was\nthe United States Government, sitting with this wet baby on its lap, that baby being the\nNuremberg trials. So we on the prosecution never knew from day to day whether or not the\nrug was going to be pulled out from under us and, until the indictment was served in the\nUnited States, could we draw free breath and know that the I. G. Farben case was going to\nactually take place. I think that that, incidentally, I think that the court might have been very\nsensitive to that fact, too, that instead of punishing these defendants we ought to welcome\ntheir expertise in the martial arts and in chemistry and in warfare generally.\n*\u00b0 James Francis Byrnes (1882-1972), Representative and Senator from South Carolina;\nSecretary of State 1945-1947.\nchemical factories of the country involved. If a company was viable, they put in their own\nmanagement. If the company was borderline financially, they dismantled the factory or laboratory\nand shipped it back to Germany. And that went on in country after country including Norway's\nhydro-electric installations, which were the largest in Europe at the time.\nShake, and they say a picture is worth a thousand words, you can see the shock and the\ndejection of Sprecher and DuBois and Amchen and the others, Linscott(ph). It was a very\ntelling picture. If the museum doesn't have it, 1t surely should get it, but of course I was just\nstunned by the decision. Then it was eventually \u2014 when it was reproduced, but I did get a\nletter from General Taylor saying that he was sure that I was disappointed and that they\nwere all disappointed but that he had felt that we had made an important contribution to\ninternational criminal law and to think of it in that respect. Then I received a full copy of the,\nof Hebert's dissenting opinion and that indicated that some of our work had struck fertile\nground, but it was a two to one opinion and both Shake and Morris were very provincial\npeople. I don't know how much they read or how much they studied, but they, from the\noutset, could not believe that these very respectable former businessmen could be guilty of\nsuch perversion.\nWZ: Just to include in your record: five or six statistical numbers, in the 12, in the 13 trials, the 12\nplus the International Military Tribunal, 199 were tried, there were 36 death sentences, 23\nlife sentences, 102 prison sentences, lesser than life, of course, and 38 acquittals. When we\nspeak of this disappointment in terms of the sentencing, the impression should not be\ngathered that there weren't any severe sentences put out. Now, of the 102 prison sentences,\nthat's where I believe that the Clemency Commission did their nefarious work. Obviously\nthe \u2014 those that had been hanged were beyond the mercies of the Clemency Commission\nand I don't know how many life sentences were reduced. I would think if any, it was a small\nnumber, but in the total number of prison sentences, that's where, in my own description, the\nClemency Commission opened the doors of the prison without consulting with counsel,\nwithout doing anything other than being appointed by the high commissioner and sitting for\neither 30 or 60 days and doing their job.\nAnd this was a job they were selected to do. For my own, for my own pleasure, I point out\nthat of the 33 judges \u2014 and we talked a little bit about whether or not they were carefully\nassigned to their particular cases, should have been more carefully considered. Of the 33\nAmerican judges, no Jewish judges. I don't resent that at all, I think it 1s good in terms of\nwhat they were trying, that there not be Jewish judges. There was no lack of Jews on the\nprosecution stand, but the way in which the Clemency Commission was selected, and I do\nbelieve that the chief judge, the acting chief judge among the three members of the\nClemency Commission was a Jew and maybe from the high commissioner's viewpoint, or\npossibly from Washington's viewpoint, I don't know, I wouldn't say Washington in this\nsituation, Harry Truman was the president. If indeed Judge Peck was Jewish, that was also a\ncarefully contrived political maneuver to ease the passage of something politically desired,\nyou see.\nBZ: Oh, unquestionably, unquestionably and that's all understandable, but Cold War politics or\nno, in my ken, that game should not have been played with these sentences, in the fashion in\nwhich it was played, because I don't think it was necessary. No matter what Jimmy Byrnes\nsaid in Stuttgart, I don't think it was necessary to get the Germans on our side in the Cold\nWar against Soviet Russia. It wasn't necessary.\nBZ: | May I say one more thing? In fairness, I must say that despite the Cold War politics and\ndespite the fact that it a gave the prosecution, the various prosecutions ulcers, the War Department\nheld fast until the last trial was over and I think that the war department deserves all the credit in the\nworld for that. We were so sure that they were going to pull the rug out from under us. There was\nnever the slightest indication from that quarter that they were going to do anything to diminish their\nsupport of the trials.\nWZ: Because of Harry Stimson, the Secretary of War.\nBZ: Well, he wasn't there at the end.\nWZ: Well, but Roosevelt, however he may be blameworthy in connection with concern with the\nJews of Europe during the war, Roosevelt was foursquare for the trial of war criminals. Harry\nTruman was foursquare for the trial of these criminals.\nBZ: Well, the State Department certainly wasn\u2019t. That's all, let's not pick a bone about it.\nWZ: Great friend of Belle's. He's dead now, but we became friendly, too, after the war, and I\nnever even discussed with him later on. We'd visit them at their home, they'd come up here and visit\nus and I never said, Joe, you really were a horse's behind with von der Hyde \u2014 look what has\nhappened\u2014\nBZ: Let's not get into that one episode.\nWZ: No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm saying we never did, you know. It just evaporated, it was an\nevent.\nwar. He had been a trial lawyer and we certainly needed someone who had a great deal of trial\nexperience. Drexel Sprecher had been there from the beginning of the IMT to the very end after all\nthe trials were concluded. He still stayed to edit and publish these sets of books that you're aware of,\nso that he brought to the prosecution of I. G. Farben extraordinary knowledge of both procedure and\na feeling for individual responsibility. He was always very grateful to Bill for pointing out that we\nhad to \u2014 that it was all very well and good to lump all these men into one category under the theory\nof conspiracy, but that it was necessary to point out where they sat in the organization, what their\ninfluence was, what their domain was and what their peculiar liability was.\nBZ: \u2014 Oh, I think there was extraordinary moral leadership. I think that the morale, up until this\nCold War business, I think that Taylor could inspire great dedication, hard work and he could rally\npeople to the cause, without any question. Taylor's problem was that he was \u2014 most people\nconsidered him rather cold. And he was, Taylor was a scholar, he wasn\u2019t a hale fellow, well met. He\nhad his circle of friends, he was not a good politician, in other words. On the other hand, if you went\nto him with a problem or if you went to him and just said, as I did, \u201cThis is one monumental\nSNAFU and I have instructions to leave whenever I don't feel my services are being properly\nutilized,\u201d he could be very understanding, indeed, warm. And I have letters, which are extremely\nwarm, which he was not obliged to write at all, but also it should be noted that he was one of the\nmost eloquent men, both in writing and in speech, that I have ever met. I mean everyone talks about\nJackson's eloquence, particularly in his opening and closing statements which are really, I think will\ngo down in history with the Gettysburg address, they were that touching and powerful. I think that\nTelford was equally eloquent.\nWZ: May I get a word in here? First about DuBois. Joe DuBois can be canonized for his devotion\nto the Jews, for the fight that he made in the face of people like Rabbi Wise,\u00b0\u00b0 who wouldn't\napproach the President during the war to tell him what was going on. Like his counsel, his\npersonal counsel who was with him every day, Sam Rosenman, Barney Baruch, who sat on\nthe bench and could walk into the President's office, supposedly at any time. The effort that\nthe Jews made to bypass the State Department and get through to FDR 1s virtually this: it is\nnot a proud part in my book of the Jewish history. DuBois got through. DuBois and a few\n60 Stephen Samuel Wise (1874-1949), U.S. Rabbi and Zionist Leader.\nother non-Jewish lawyers in the Treasury Department managed to incite the Secretary of\nTreasury, Henry Morganthau,\u00b0' to demand that something be done and the War Refugee\nBoard was set up. My little set-to with DuBois about von der Hyde and Haberland\u2122 pales\ninto nothingness against the totality of Joe DuBois's contribution that I know of, to the good\npart of the war effort and Nuremberg. Telford, I must say for Telford, I've had, I was part of\nthe circle, you know, the circle of friends.\nWZ: Telford had an absolutely monumental administrative job, because although all of us who\nwere there, were there because we were interested in what we were doing, all of us, after all the\nyears of military service and so forth, had a whole kind of, a mass emotional problem, you know.\nWe'd been away from home...\nBZ: \u2014 Randy, before we conclude, I would like to read you one paragraph from Telford Taylor's\nfinal report to the Secretary of the Army, dated August 15, 1949. It was a report on the War Crimes\nTrials conducted, known as \u201cSubsequent Proceedings\u201d and I think it is a very useful summary. He\nsaid, \u201cImportant as is the concept of aggressive war and beneficent as the Hague and Geneva\nconventions may be, we can hardly expect much further judicial development and interpretation of\ncrimes against peace or war crimes, except of course in the unhappy event of another war. The\nconcept of crimes against humanity however, if it becomes an established part of international penal\nlaw, as it seems to be doing, will be of the greatest practical importance in peacetime, indeed it may\n\u2018| Henry Morgenthau (1891-1967), U.S. Secretary of Treasury 1934-1945.\n\u00a9 Ulrich Hablerland, head of Lower Rhine Betriebsgemeinschaft [company staff] in\n1943. Peter Hayes. /ndustry and Ideology: I.G. Farben in the Nazi Era (Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press, 1987), 337.\nprove to be a most important safeguard against future wars, in as much as large scale domestic\natrocities caused by racial or religious issues, always constitute a serious threat to peace.\u201d\nWe have seen this happen in Ireland, in Bosnia, in Rwanda and in many, many other places,\nBurundi and many other places in the world and I believe that just as how we eventually got the\ngenocide convention ratified by all of the peace-loving members of the United Nations, I believe\nthat we will one day see a permanent, international, military court, established under the auspices of\nthe United Nations, with an enforcement apparatus, which will put out these brush fires before they\nbecome sad and long sagas of revenge and retaliation and brutality, because as is the case in Bosnia\nand elsewhere and as I said before, these wars, internal as they may be, which are directed against\none religious or racial group, constitute a threat to the peace of every nation in the entire world.\nThat's about all I have to say.\nlike Benjamin Ferencz and like Henry King of Ohio, who have since the Nuremberg trials,\ndedicated their entire, have spent this past 50 years dedicated to the strengthening of international\nlaw, to the perpetuation of the Nuremberg principles and to the cause of human rights.\nOne. I lived through the Twenties and the exaggerated responses to the first World War. I lived\nthrough, as a student and as an adult, the 1930s. I have been very well aware of every campaign for\nthe presidency since Al Smith ran against Herbert Hoover in 1928. This history is part of my life,\nthe history of the entire century and the Nuremberg part of it 1s one that is terribly important because\nI participated 1n it, to the extent of which I participated in the presidency of Jack Kennedy, in the\npolitical life of Bobby Kennedy and an awareness of Harry Truman, in trying to achieve a better\nsociety through politics, in which I was heavily engaged and so was Belle engaged. And a\nrealization now, at this age, about the beauty and the value of the life of a small child. Nuremberg 1s\nconnected with all of that. I see those children in the concentration camps, emaciated, frightened,\nwearing their clothes, I know how I want a child to look like and these things all fit a pattern you\nknow. I have no illusions about my contribution to this society, but I don't downgrade or demean\nany of \u2014 it's had great, great pleasures, it's had very difficult periods and periods of pain and they,\nthey're part of most anybody's life, including at that present time, when the people dear to you,\neither dying or very close and so on and so forth. Nuremberg was a thing that I'll look back upon\nwith a great deal of pleasure and I have no complications about it.\nI wish I could believe, because I know the importance of politics in everything that goes on\non this earth, I wish I could believe that those people are going to be picked up and taken to the\nHague and tried. If we don't do it, nobody else is going to do it. But I think it's, I see all of the\ndifficulties and all of the complications and if Nuremberg 1s less than either of us would have\nwanted it to be, so be it. But Nuremberg was important in my life and I think Nuremberg was\nimportant in Belle's life. Although she chooses to talk of the pain, well she recovered from the pain\nof Nuremberg. We all recover from pain. I had coronary bypass surgery 21 years ago and I've\nforgotten about it, but I haven't forgotten about Nuremberg.\nEnd of Tape Four\nConclusion of interview.\n"
