        "Answer: I went through my library and selected out of 15 books, two or three which are correct and\nsuch as that is, there are two Auschwitz publications, of\nAuschwitz, has the wrong , So if they had got to swindle or to\nretouch or to add something to an aerial view, then the whole United States aerial view, aerial view\nphotographs should be now investigated.",
        "Question: If who swindled?",
        "A: There are photographs, you said, taken by the Air Force.",
        "Q: Well, yes.",
        "A: That doesn't look to me like a photograph taken by the Air Force. That is a photo mounting of\naerial, of aerial, aerial view of the region and a drawing which was added on top of the, of the map,\njust for educational purposes.",

        "Q: Sorry.",
        "A: I've been moving from barrack to barrack in the whole region, including later on,\nnew zone that was established with the new camp and I had the permission to\nmeasure each barrack, each, to take all the measurements because I pretended that I don't, that I\nwant to do that myself because I don't want to use original architectural\ndrawings. Because we were smuggling out plans and if we would have ever caught, then they\nwould have suspected that I have been involved, yeah? So I camouflaged my whole operation by,\nby, measuring the whole model which I made, measuring barrack by barrack and distances from\neach barrack and so on. So I had set camp in, still in my head, I can know the numbering system,\ngood or bad, whatever afterwards, I couldn't care less, but I,\nI produced a camp model and a good one which were sent, taken away and\nsent first to the, to the headquarters of the SS and then they told me it was to\nBerlin. And so did all my other, other work of drafts and diagrams went to the\nofttimes. But we had no fifth row in the camp flag like produced in all of those\ndrawings. As I have shown you, I have here some publications, with correct, with correct drawings,\nwith correct numbers. Everything else were done and copied by, by a people who were more\ninterested in, in, in, telling their stories than to make a correct, authentic, they are people who could\nnot read a map then and from young people like Kitty Hart(ph), I don't where she learned to read an\narchitectural map or a land drawing or so. And she just copies it and if go further you will find\ndozens and dozens, many dozens of ____. But how could the Air Force produce aerial views if,\nof things which did not exist then, I mean that is a very touchy, touchy, situation, don't you think so?",

So , when I went\nwith her [speaks foreign language here], she instructed me what to tell girls. So\nshe said, write home, write to your people and write to them whatever you want, that you are here\nand you are alive and you are well off.

Write to the center Jewish office and ask them to\nforward it to certain people.\" And the Hungarian girls were mad at me because I told them not to\nwrite to their people, but to write through a center office. So they're running to the SS woman and\ntold SS woman that I told them not to write. Now, then what could I do, she nearly, she went mad.\nShe said, \"Are you out of your mind?\" I said, \"No, they did not understood Hungarian.\" So, but it,\nit was, it wasn't fun.",

        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: Now I'm telling her about one situation because she's arrived at the end of\n'42, but she's did not know prior to that what I have experienced as being amongst the very first\nwomen in the camp. And she's interested because the Auschwitz people at the museum, in their\nwhole research and report have very little reports on the day by day happenings during. We have\ngeneral, general idea, but we don't know individual cases and so my case is a unique one, because as\nI have been spared by a camp commander of Birkenau, was only for two months, who had a\nsecretary who was [speaks foreign language here]. She had a Jewish boyfriend and for that she was\narrested. Now, there is a special, an English expression for , you probably\nknow it, but it turns my tongue around and I have to look that up. In any case, if a Jew and a non-\nJew live together, were married together, they were either forced to, to divorce, or if they were\nunmarried, the man were arrested if he was Jewish and usually killed and the German woman ended\nup 1n a concentration camp. The insignia of the badges turned into a combined yellow-purple star,\nyeah and so that commander of the camp, whose name was Miller, he was there only for two\nmonths, had a secretary who was one of those Jew lovers and, and she begged for mercy. I, because\nI was sitting there just to be loaded onto the trucks and while walking she walked from her barrack\nduring lunchtime or so, to her office, which was in front of the entrance of the temp women's camp\nand I called out to her, \"Look, honey, I'm here.\" And she was running up to her office and all of a\nsudden, a notorious SS man arrived, his name was Shteebitz(ph), \"Where is that inmate so and so?\"\nAnd then they guided him to me and then he asked me, \"What are you doing here?\" I said, \"I don't\nknow. I want to go back to work.\" So he said, \"Come with me.\" Took me back to the barrack and\nasking me to go up and three tier of, three rows of bed which were built, one on\ntop of the others, exactly the one you have at your museum, asking, I had Typhus and I was very\nsick, asking me to go up and down and up and down and up and down several times. Little he knew\nthat I was trained to, to go up and down mountains and I'm a girl, I could climb\nand I, I was very weak, but still I, I, I managed. I was used to go up the ladder, by doing murals\nduring my professional career and so on. He didn't know that and I managed nicely up and down as\nmany times as he wanted me to do and then taking me out, asking me to jump over the, the, what\nwas this thing, _, it's a ditch, yeah. There were ditches alongside the center, the central camp\nroad, not like, said, [speaks foreign language here].",

        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: It was quite, and I could jump, yeah, so I jumped. So I passed my jump, I passed my up and\ndown and then, into the camp infirmary. [speaks foreign language here]",

And he, he was not\nhappy that the camp leader, sending over who was , to overrule\nhis desire to kill everybody and to gas everybody who is, who was there already waiting to be\nloaded onto the trucks. And while he, he, and, so he made it his business, he didn't know exactly\nhow, what to do. Hirst(ph) described him as the most reliable SS man in the camp, yeah?

        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: They had to, they had to grow up much earlier than anybody else because they had to be already\nin the kitchen where the peeling took place, they were sitting and peeling potatoes, yeah? But they\nhad to be there before the whole camp was, was alarmed to wake up and before roll call took place.\nSo that was the only disadvantage.",
        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: And then she turned, then she became ill.",
        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: But she reported immediately to the hospital, but she was warned don't do it, because if you will\ndo that, you may be subject in selection for .",
        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: [speaks foreign language here]. I'm always explaining to people generally,\ntimes, [speaks foreign language here]. I always explain that in the beginning, non-Jewish inmates\nwere gassed too. [speaks foreign language here]",
        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: But she, as a non-Jewess was three times selected. So when I made the statement to several\ngroups of people or individuals, that non-Jews, Poles and Germans alike were gassed, selected, they\nwere selected and gassed, just like the Jews, people do not believe me, yeah? And here you have a\nwitness, who went through three selections. But then later on, some of the researchers already\nsometimes it 1s mentioned, but all Jewish people do not want to hear that, yeah.",
        "Q: And it was through out the entire time, or did it become different?\nI: In the beginning.",
        "Q: In the beginning, right.\nI: And later on, I don't know at what occasion, I would say, let's listen to her. [speaks foreign\nlanguage here]",
        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: They stopped approximately in April '43, when the large influx of transports, of Jewish transports\narrived from Holland, France, Greece and so on. Then , when they discovered\nanother thing, not , was they discovered then, that the Jewish numbers, the\ntattooed numbers, [speaks foreign language here], they did not, they couldn't distinguish all of a\nsudden who is Jewish and who is not Jewish among the women, by selecting and when the, when\nthe switch or the change of policy occurred, the Jews, non-Jews should not be gassed any more,\nduring an in-house selection, because there were no transports coming from outside, where non-\nJews were selected like the Jews, but I'm talking about in camp selection, there was, they stopped\nwhen the big influx of Jewish people were coming. But then they discovered, all of a sudden that\nwe are carrying the same number, the Jews and non-Jews alike. So how to distinguish during the\nselections? With a man they could do anything they want as they were marked, but a woman was\nnot circumcised. So they had some big idea we are going to supply, we are going to include a\ntriangle under your number for Jewish women. And then when the triangle, the tattoo triangle was\ninvented. And no one of those big shots who are now in research, engaged in Holocaust and\nAuschwitz research have the slightest idea why is the triangle is there. Now they started to put the\ntriangle retroactive, but I was hiding. I knew what it meant and I just took, I decided if I can go\naway without the triangle, I do. And I'm still running around without the triangle of course it could\nhave saved my life once in awhile, yeah, but not always because you were not gassed before your\nidentity not established anyhow. But you know, that ad hoc, ad hoc selection, I\nescaped many times those things because I had no triangle.",
        "Q: So non-Jews, when they were selected, it was only inside the camp, it wasn't on the ramp, it\nwasn't in coming in.\nI: Never. Only the transports, let me explain that to her. [speaks foreign\nlanguage here]",
        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: [speaks foreign language here]. Most of the non-Jews were coming from jails, from police\nstations and then transferred into system of .

Well, the, the...\nI: We had to sleep in the beginning, outside.\nI: Yeah and from the beginning they had to sleep outside.\nI: Outdoors, because they couldn't wait until the barrack was not put into order and cleaned.\nBecause the men were living before us there and that, they were not as good as a woman would\nhave been by keeping the barrack clean. In any case, it was a dirty barrack. Full of all kinds of\nfleas, bugs. I remember there were rats too, but she does not remember. Rats. [speaks foreign\nlanguage here]",

And so it's couldn't even enter or sleep there because after the\nextermination, which took place in , It was smelly and we were afraid to sleep\nindoors because we had the impression that's the same gas they have used for the extermination, but\nthey've used on, on humans, so it took awhile until the whole barrack was allowed, of us, we were\nable to enter, to breathe, to sleep and to work.",
        "Q: So they actually tried to clean the barrack?",
        "A: Yeah. Because the neglected the whole thing and the women were afraid to\nenter.",
        "Q: Now were the women actually treating the barracks better than the men?\nI: Definitely, definitely. [speaks foreign language here]",
        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: Iam going to translate, but I'm going to historically answer your question, okay? Because it was\nnot 100 percent answer to be what you want it to be. If men were, if a woman was, if our women\nwere better in housekeeping than previously the men, that was your question. Now my answer and\nher answer combined is that when the barrack was assigned for the administrative, administrative\nwork details, to work and to be housed there, it was very a neglected one, the male prisoners left for\nthe male camp and we were assigned to that barrack, which was Block four, a wooden barrack. So\ndisinfecting took place and then the women organized the barrack to be cleaned, cleaned,\n, we had enough of water and scrubbing material, all wooden parts, floors,\nwhatever we had were cleaned and was, the barrack was assigned for half of administrative\nactivities, like the camp office, as the private room of the Katya and special\nroom for the drawing office, of which I became part, not part, but in charge. We\nwere administratively part of the camp office adjacent, but they assigned me to a private room\nwhere I could prepare my activities and, and work undisturbed. What\nunderlined, which is of importance, and among others, end result of my, of the beginning of my\ncareer was that any trait, profession or activity, which had to be performed, like repair of the roof,\nlaying of the floor, of the wooden floor, repairing of any inside work to be done, erecting some\nwalls up between, between the, in the barracks to, to, to have some partitions erected actually, to\nhave an room, you see it was in big hall and then it was divided into certain rooms for certain\nactivities, so the camp office was erected by putting wall and, and, and dividing\nthat into a certain size. Then the private room also, top administrative inmate, like Katya, who was,\nbecame the report and another room which I, which was assigned to me where I\ncould work and was called the drawing office. They had neglected the drawing\noffice all the time, I don't know why, I have been known , known as\nthe from the camp office, but I was actually in charge of the drawing office, in\naddition to, to, to the administrative belonging to the camp office. So drawing office became\noffice of the drawing office. So I was from the [speaks\nforeign language here]. But, but she, especially on the , certain functions could\nnot be performed by a woman, because we had no know-how, like repairing of the roof, the\nreplacing of broken glasses, putting a new floor, building partitions to, to divide\ncamp, barracks, , designated to us, into a housing or sleeping,\nsleeping area and another area, so there we had the first time, certain male work details who were\ncoming from the mens camp to perform those activities. And what I just want to add to it, that\nbecause of that, the policy was, if there's a woman who can perform anything a man would have had\nto do, a man was, if there was a capable woman, able to perform those that did it as they preferred, a\nwoman, because they wanted to avoid the, the contact between men and women and that was\nalways an opportunity to exchange certain views, to spread certain news, or words or whatever.\nAnd if that wouldn't have been the policy, I would have never obtained my drawing office, never\nhave been put in charge of the drawing office, where I could practice whatever I have been trained\nfor, that means graphics, okay?",
        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: [speaks foreign language here]. I have been just explaining what I said, what I've been adding to\nher previous statement and made my remarks that while reading, while counting the kind of\nprofessions, which women could not perform and therefore we had to engage male prisoners, well,\nin addition she added painters. So I said but we had painters only later and they have been always\nlooking for painters in the , but in those days we had no painters, no.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you, when Katya came into your barrack...",

        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: It's the right person, it's the right time that you add.\nI: She said that was something that the reason that the men didn't have the drawing room, there was\nsomething really new and really unusual that women in this barracks had a drawing room and then\nbecause of Tsippy(ph)'s(ph) talent, she was a very talented drawer and, and, and graphic designer,\nso that was the reason why they opened a drawing room in, in the Barrack four.",

        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: She had no intention to change, because she couldn't, change the system, but she wanted to\nexchange the personnel in charge of the inmates to be able to conduct a more efficient organization\n, but to, to obtain an out, an better out, yeah, so she switched from one inmate in\ncharge to a better one. She was a very efficient person, a very success oriented person and all of a\nsudden she had here on one hand, a primitive prostitute from Ravensbruck in charge of the Polish\nwomen who were wives of officers of and, and, and the high ex-Polish officials, where the balance\nwas impossible, I mean you can imagine how primitive Slovakian girl, even from village with a\nhighly trained Polish intellectual, she could not deal, she only could be rough and was not able to\nperform anything of what was asked her to do, not even a list of an inmate because they could\nhardly write. So he or she matched the inmate population of one barrack to the people in charge,\nwho will, were, will be able to conduct exactly what she needed to bring her system or the system in\nwhich, which was created by the Germans in a certain way, to satisfy the Germans but not to serve\nthe Germans, to satisfy the Germans and to help us.

Since the Auschwitz exhibit at the UN,\narguing about the, about the correctness, that's better, yeah, of the insignias, which was, they were\nwrongly interpreted, the Washington Holocaust office, the Washington Museum produced wrong\ninformation, the Auschwitz people in the, what's the museum in Auschwitz? Produced wrong\ninformation, cause they engaged in so-called consultants, a famous from\nAuschwitz, who didn't know the difference between an, an, Jehovah Witness and an Jewish and a\nnon-Jewish person who had a love affair with a Jewish man, they were differently marked, the\nwomen's camp had their own, yeah and I will probably sit down with you and explain to you my\nactivities and my functions and my work in the drawing office. And then you will understand why\nI'm objecting to the insignias, why I'm objecting to other things, to, to the plans of Birkenau in\ngeneral. I have never disclosed to anybody because I've never been asked, never been understood\nwhat I did because to be, to have, I mean the historians don't even know how to read a map, to be\nquite honest, they don't look for the, for any clues which could be misleading. They are looking\nthings from an entire different angle and I cannot blame them. But if there comes some graphic\nartist, who, who was trained and worked all her life in the profession and is trying to argue about\nsomething of, of a graphic nature with an historian, it is an tragedy, yeah? Because I had cases\nwhere, was mentioned yesterday, I had to explain what a stencil 1s, yeah? By explaining what I\ndesigned for a particular, in a particular situation.

I'm not quoted in\nany world famous historical literature because I've been living a world of silence\ndue to my handicap, where I couldn't hear, where I couldn't communicate and when I finally opened\nmy mouth it was, I was totally isolated, misunderstood and too technical for their taste. No, now\nyou know. Now let's come back to the aerial views. The aerial views as we've discovered is that\nthey were, I mean for the purpose of explanation and important that they have inserted the plans\nand, and brought out the area they were, the area in question, but why couldn't they do the right\nthing, why have they used and copied the wrong thing, that is my, I am had no, no objections that\nthey have inserted the camp, the women's camp on their aerial views. I've given strong signal,\nyeah? Can I call that...",
        "Q: You mean, you mean with a diagram as opposed to a photograph?",
        "A: With a diagram, correct. But then they had not and you cannot even blame the people what they\ndid because from the first day on, the very first publications after World War 2, produced in Poland,\nby famous researchers like Dr. for example, he published the very first book on\nAuschwitz and it's a good one, I have that in both languages, in German and 1n, in, in Polish, which\nhe forwarded to me because I, that's always active and tried to keep in touch with the post-war\nAuschwitz family of inmates, I mean, it's not the families, but we got a small family of people who\ntried to stay in touch with. That was in Warsaw in headquarters of the international Auschwitz\ncommittee, under the stewardship of ____. And then there was the museum and there are people\nwho tried to do their best but the world was not very sympathetic, they had no money, they had no,\nthey were not very, we were not very popular because the world had enough in those days, so there\nwas a Stagnation of interest and after awhile people started to publish correct or incorrect. But then\nit comes to diagrams and to the drawings of the camp, there were irregularities, they were using\nsome, they couldn't, tools, all those by foot, they had no experts to perform, they,\nto perform a layout of the measurement instruments, they had no access to the camp building office,\nthey didn't even know then that it ever existed. People, the historians who were trying to start to\nbring the history down to paper, had no idea that there was an Auschwitz official building office and\nso that those, that, maps and drawings and sketches were preserved miraculously, yeah. We know\ntoday how the camp looked, we know and, but somebody was, sit down and\ncomplain. So the first plan was used, the first basic information was used from\n, that document of, the Berlin planning of Auschwitz. I mean they tried and\nthey still have enough of material and they had enough of material, but it was wrongly interpreted\nbecause the draftsman who was able to read the drawings, was not reading the historical\nbackground, yeah? If they would have done what I did all my life before I had to perform a drawing\nfor my husband for his publication, I first had to learn the text and to translate his scientific language\ninto simple lines and diagrams. The people who were assigned to make the sketches of the first\nsketches after the war, were not presented with an historic background, they're not even asked to\nread or to understand what they are drawing, what they are doing and so we have know the after\neffects.",

We have\ngeneral, general idea, but we don't know individual cases and so my case is a unique one, because as\nI have been spared by a camp commander of Birkenau, was only for two months, who had a\nsecretary who was [speaks foreign language here]. She had a Jewish boyfriend and for that she was\narrested. Now, there is a special, an English expression for , you probably\nknow it, but it turns my tongue around and I have to look that up. In any case, if a Jew and a non-\nJew live together, were married together, they were either forced to, to divorce, or if they were\nunmarried, the man were arrested if he was Jewish and usually killed and the German woman ended\nup 1n a concentration camp. The insignia of the badges turned into a combined yellow-purple star,\nyeah and so that commander of the camp, whose name was Miller, he was there only for two\nmonths, had a secretary who was one of those Jew lovers and, and she begged for mercy. I, because\nI was sitting there just to be loaded onto the trucks and while walking she walked from her barrack\nduring lunchtime or so, to her office, which was in front of the entrance of the temp women's camp\nand I called out to her, \"Look, honey, I'm here.\" And she was running up to her office and all of a\nsudden, a notorious SS man arrived, his name was Shteebitz(ph), \"Where is that inmate so and so?\"\nAnd then they guided him to me and then he asked me, \"What are you doing here?\" I said, \"I don't\nknow. I want to go back to work.\" So he said, \"Come with me.\" Took me back to the barrack and\nasking me to go up and three tier of, three rows of bed which were built, one on\ntop of the others, exactly the one you have at your museum, asking, I had Typhus and I was very\nsick, asking me to go up and down and up and down and up and down several times. Little he knew\nthat I was trained to, to go up and down mountains and I'm a girl, I could climb\nand I, I was very weak, but still I, I, I managed. I was used to go up the ladder, by doing murals\nduring my professional career and so on. He didn't know that and I managed nicely up and down as\nmany times as he wanted me to do and then taking me out, asking me to jump over the, the, what\nwas this thing, _, it's a ditch, yeah. There were ditches alongside the center, the central camp\nroad, not like, said, [speaks foreign language here].",

And he, he was not\nhappy that the camp leader, sending over who was , to overrule\nhis desire to kill everybody and to gas everybody who is, who was there already waiting to be\nloaded onto the trucks. And while he, he, and, so he made it his business, he didn't know exactly\nhow, what to do. Hirst(ph) described him as the most reliable SS man in the camp, yeah?

I've rememorized a lot, but I lost the time, the times, time, development, step by step. I\ndon't know what happened before and what happened afterwards, yeah?\nI: Auschwitz I and I have been relocating to Birkenau on, crowding on those necks and arms, it was\na horrible thing, but I had to do it because they were, they were killing some people who were left\nbehind and were reported sick.",

        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: [speaks foreign language here]. After she arrived and put into block one at B one A, she was\nselected to work in the potato peeling, in the work detail and then transferred to the Barrack 10,\nwhere all the potato peelers were in, okay?",
        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: was beautiful, because...",
        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: Yeah, see, they were, they were exempted from, from ,",
        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: She had, but there was, was one, one disadvantage...",
        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: They had to, they had to grow up much earlier than anybody else because they had to be already\nin the kitchen where the peeling took place, they were sitting and peeling potatoes, yeah? But they\nhad to be there before the whole camp was, was alarmed to wake up and before roll call took place.\nSo that was the only disadvantage.",
        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: And then she turned, then she became ill.",
        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: But she reported immediately to the hospital, but she was warned don't do it, because if you will\ndo that, you may be subject in selection for .",
        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: [speaks foreign language here]. I'm always explaining to people generally,\ntimes, [speaks foreign language here]. I always explain that in the beginning, non-Jewish inmates\nwere gassed too. [speaks foreign language here]",
        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: But she, as a non-Jewess was three times selected. So when I made the statement to several\ngroups of people or individuals, that non-Jews, Poles and Germans alike were gassed, selected, they\nwere selected and gassed, just like the Jews, people do not believe me, yeah? And here you have a\nwitness, who went through three selections. But then later on, some of the researchers already\nsometimes it 1s mentioned, but all Jewish people do not want to hear that, yeah.",
        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: They stopped approximately in April '43, when the large influx of transports, of Jewish transports\narrived from Holland, France, Greece and so on. Then , when they discovered\nanother thing, not , was they discovered then, that the Jewish numbers, the\ntattooed numbers, [speaks foreign language here], they did not, they couldn't distinguish all of a\nsudden who is Jewish and who is not Jewish among the women, by selecting and when the, when\nthe switch or the change of policy occurred, the Jews, non-Jews should not be gassed any more,\nduring an in-house selection, because there were no transports coming from outside, where non-\nJews were selected like the Jews, but I'm talking about in camp selection, there was, they stopped\nwhen the big influx of Jewish people were coming. But then they discovered, all of a sudden that\nwe are carrying the same number, the Jews and non-Jews alike. So how to distinguish during the\nselections? With a man they could do anything they want as they were marked, but a woman was\nnot circumcised. So they had some big idea we are going to supply, we are going to include a\ntriangle under your number for Jewish women. And then when the triangle, the tattoo triangle was\ninvented. And no one of those big shots who are now in research, engaged in Holocaust and\nAuschwitz research have the slightest idea why is the triangle is there. Now they started to put the\ntriangle retroactive, but I was hiding. I knew what it meant and I just took, I decided if I can go\naway without the triangle, I do. And I'm still running around without the triangle of course it could\nhave saved my life once in awhile, yeah, but not always because you were not gassed before your\nidentity not established anyhow. But you know, that ad hoc, ad hoc selection, I\nescaped many times those things because I had no triangle.",
        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: [speaks foreign language here]. Most of the non-Jews were coming from jails, from police\nstations and then transferred into system of .

        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: [speaks foreign language here]. Yeah, I'm just explaining that some difference between\nnewcomers, from jail or or yeah. What the difference was administratively, even\nif a Jew went from police station in front of a judge, just for not wearing a star or for stealing\na or who knows, but he was, he had some guarantee not to be gassed, he could be\nkilled, he could be starved to death, but he was not allowed to be gassed, because he belonged to the\nsame category of criminals, like the non-Jews.",

        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: Yeah, waiting for the SS doctor. They had all temperature. If the people were diagnosed as\nTyphus, patient, they were killed with injections. We had an inmate doctor there,\nan Slovakian doctor, under the name Anna Weiss(ph).",
        "A: Anna Weiss(ph).\nI: And she took over. As the doctor arrived, she reported not Typhus, but flu, flu,\nflu, flu. And she was a flu patient all of a sudden and that was the moment she was saved from\nbeing killed. So [speaks foreign language here]",

And it was still, today you\nstill have to argue with non-believers, with revisionists, even with our own Jewish people. How do\nyou know, how do you know, how do you know? But proof, that wasn't very\nreliable proof, that when, when the clothing was sorted or cleaned or, or steamed, deloused and\nsome numbers were still on those clothes and the inmates of course, if is an individual, wanted to\nknow if one, if the inmate is still there that just went to the barrack where he used to live,\n, but it was very complicated, very hard to prove to the world that we know\nwhat happened.",

        "A: [speaks foreign language here]\nI: Iam going to translate, but I'm going to historically answer your question, okay? Because it was\nnot 100 percent answer to be what you want it to be. If men were, if a woman was, if our women\nwere better in housekeeping than previously the men, that was your question. Now my answer and\nher answer combined is that when the barrack was assigned for the administrative, administrative\nwork details, to work and to be housed there, it was very a neglected one, the male prisoners left for\nthe male camp and we were assigned to that barrack, which was Block four, a wooden barrack. So\ndisinfecting took place and then the women organized the barrack to be cleaned, cleaned,\n, we had enough of water and scrubbing material, all wooden parts, floors,\nwhatever we had were cleaned and was, the barrack was assigned for half of administrative\nactivities, like the camp office, as the private room of the Katya and special\nroom for the drawing office, of which I became part, not part, but in charge. We\nwere administratively part of the camp office adjacent, but they assigned me to a private room\nwhere I could prepare my activities and, and work undisturbed. What\nunderlined, which is of importance, and among others, end result of my, of the beginning of my\ncareer was that any trait, profession or activity, which had to be performed, like repair of the roof,\nlaying of the floor, of the wooden floor, repairing of any inside work to be done, erecting some\nwalls up between, between the, in the barracks to, to, to have some partitions erected actually, to\nhave an room, you see it was in big hall and then it was divided into certain rooms for certain\nactivities, so the camp office was erected by putting wall and, and, and dividing\nthat into a certain size. Then the private room also, top administrative inmate, like Katya, who was,\nbecame the report and another room which I, which was assigned to me where I\ncould work and was called the drawing office. They had neglected the drawing\noffice all the time, I don't know why, I have been known , known as\nthe from the camp office, but I was actually in charge of the drawing office, in\naddition to, to, to the administrative belonging to the camp office. So drawing office became\noffice of the drawing office. So I was from the [speaks\nforeign language here]. But, but she, especially on the , certain functions could\nnot be performed by a woman, because we had no know-how, like repairing of the roof, the\nreplacing of broken glasses, putting a new floor, building partitions to, to divide\ncamp, barracks, , designated to us, into a housing or sleeping,\nsleeping area and another area, so there we had the first time, certain male work details who were\ncoming from the mens camp to perform those activities. And what I just want to add to it, that\nbecause of that, the policy was, if there's a woman who can perform anything a man would have had\nto do, a man was, if there was a capable woman, able to perform those that did it as they preferred, a\nwoman, because they wanted to avoid the, the contact between men and women and that was\nalways an opportunity to exchange certain views, to spread certain news, or words or whatever.\nAnd if that wouldn't have been the policy, I would have never obtained my drawing office, never\nhave been put in charge of the drawing office, where I could practice whatever I have been trained\nfor, that means graphics, okay?",

I have been just explaining what I said, what I've been adding to\nher previous statement and made my remarks that while reading, while counting the kind of\nprofessions, which women could not perform and therefore we had to engage male prisoners, well,\nin addition she added painters. So I said but we had painters only later and they have been always\nlooking for painters in the , but in those days we had no painters, no.",

She had a\nvery strange function, yesterday I mentioned that she produced vouchers for the canteen, as a matter\nof fact I called her last night, but the phone was constantly busy the whole night so we have to wait\nuntil they repair in Prague the phones and I'm going to talk to her.

Or to resist.\n, 1, I, I played an very important part, see I never spoke about it, but if you want\nto know I may mention something and I wanted to speak yesterday to , but\nshe, there was no, I'm afraid she's not alive because since two weeks I'm trying to contact her and\njust a constant busy sign. Finally I asked the operator yesterday to, there was\nonly, the telephone, busy sign, but no conversation, so.\nI'm objecting to the insignias, why I'm objecting to other things, to, to the plans of Birkenau in\ngeneral. I have never disclosed to anybody because I've never been asked, never been understood\nwhat I did because to be, to have, I mean the historians don't even know how to read a map, to be\nquite honest, they don't look for the, for any clues which could be misleading. They are looking\nthings from an entire different angle and I cannot blame them. But if there comes some graphic\nartist, who, who was trained and worked all her life in the profession and is trying to argue about\nsomething of, of a graphic nature with an historian, it is an tragedy, yeah? Because I had cases\nwhere, was mentioned yesterday, I had to explain what a stencil 1s, yeah? By explaining what I\ndesigned for a particular, in a particular situation. So I'm fighting against many thing, it's not\nfighting, I'm just arguing about it and I always, I never had a real sympathetic ear by anybody to\nlisten to me and it's, I've developed a situation where I suffer from an certain kind of loneliness, I\ncannot talk always to myself. People don't know what I'm talking about. I'm not quoted in\nany world famous historical literature because I've been living a world of silence\ndue to my handicap, where I couldn't hear, where I couldn't communicate and when I finally opened\nmy mouth it was, I was totally isolated, misunderstood and too technical for their taste. No, now\nyou know. Now let's come back to the aerial views. The aerial views as we've discovered is that\nthey were, I mean for the purpose of explanation and important that they have inserted the plans\nand, and brought out the area they were, the area in question, but why couldn't they do the right\nthing, why have they used and copied the wrong thing, that is my, I am had no, no objections that\nthey have inserted the camp, the women's camp on their aerial views. I've given strong signal,\nyeah? Can I call that...",
        "A: With a diagram, correct. But then they had not and you cannot even blame the people what they\ndid because from the first day on, the very first publications after World War 2, produced in Poland,\nby famous researchers like Dr. for example, he published the very first book on\nAuschwitz and it's a good one, I have that in both languages, in German and 1n, in, in Polish, which\nhe forwarded to me because I, that's always active and tried to keep in touch with the post-war\nAuschwitz family of inmates, I mean, it's not the families, but we got a small family of people who\ntried to stay in touch with. That was in Warsaw in headquarters of the international Auschwitz\ncommittee, under the stewardship of ____. And then there was the museum and there are people\nwho tried to do their best but the world was not very sympathetic, they had no money, they had no,\nthey were not very, we were not very popular because the world had enough in those days, so there\nwas a Stagnation of interest and after awhile people started to publish correct or incorrect. But then\nit comes to diagrams and to the drawings of the camp, there were irregularities, they were using\nsome, they couldn't, tools, all those by foot, they had no experts to perform, they,\nto perform a layout of the measurement instruments, they had no access to the camp building office,\nthey didn't even know then that it ever existed. People, the historians who were trying to start to\nbring the history down to paper, had no idea that there was an Auschwitz official building office and\nso that those, that, maps and drawings and sketches were preserved miraculously, yeah. We know\ntoday how the camp looked, we know and, but somebody was, sit down and\ncomplain. So the first plan was used, the first basic information was used from\n, that document of, the Berlin planning of Auschwitz. I mean they tried and\nthey still have enough of material and they had enough of material, but it was wrongly interpreted\nbecause the draftsman who was able to read the drawings, was not reading the historical\nbackground, yeah? If they would have done what I did all my life before I had to perform a drawing\nfor my husband for his publication, I first had to learn the text and to translate his scientific language\ninto simple lines and diagrams. The people who were assigned to make the sketches of the first\nsketches after the war, were not presented with an historic background, they're not even asked to\nread or to understand what they are drawing, what they are doing and so we have know the after\neffects.",

Because the, the Polish bloody underground, yeah,\nwere coming for men, during the day the male prisoners were coming, gathering all the Polish\nwomen in my office, in my drawing office, throwing me out so that they can discuss their secret\nconnections and messages. I went out walking around the camp and having fun visiting all people\nand then at night I had to perform my duties because I had to deliver. So then, sometimes, while\nworking, or wanted to work, it was intellectually, mentally, a very demanding job. I performed\nmany, many things where I had to concentrate, where I had to be correct and where I had to, not\nwanted to be disturbed because it was sometimes a very delicate job I performed. So then anybody\nwas coming in of those little monkeys and talking to me and, and so I started to scream, get out of\nhere, because I have to work, yeah.

The political situation, how to camouflage things, how to pretend, how to lure the people into\nbe able to be driven into the gas chamber without any resistance.

Katya overheard once in an\ntelephone conversation, while she was on her own, it is actually, but I'm not [speaks foreign\nlanguage here], I wouldn't like to talk about it because it's very, very described what I have to say\nabout Katya in one of the books of wrote in his last years.
