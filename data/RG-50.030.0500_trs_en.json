        "Q: So let\u2019s spend a little time talking about your family and h-how you were raised, and what it\nwas like to live with your parents and your sister.",
        "A: Iam the oldest one, my sister 1s six and a half years younger, so I was the only child for six\nand a half years.",
        "Q: So that means you have an only child perspective, almost.",
        "A: Ob-Obviously.",
        "Q: What did your dad do?",
        "A: My dad was a journalist in a Jewish newspaper that a group of young men got together and\nformed a cooperative, and it was a daily Jewish newspaper.",
        "Q: And was that -- that was his profession, to be a journalist?",
        "A: Right. Actually, what they did, it was -- at that time it was right after the first war -- war, and\nof course I was not there and don\u2019t remember anything of that, just by stories.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: My father was, to start with, a very active leader in unionization right after the war. And he\nhelped to establish the union of printers in Lodz. Now, a [indecipherable] statement is that Lodz\nwas the second largest city in Poland, Warsaw was the capital, Lodz was the industrial city, and\nit was called the Polish Manchester. And the -- really the only industrial city in Poland, which\nmeant that it was also a city of social and political ferment. The union -- uni -- birth of the\nunions, the workers movement etcetera, and I was born in that atmosphere. A big city coming\ninto being as a substantial industrial city, in a Poland that was mostly, or only agricultural before.\nThe city -- the population of the city consisted of sort of three parts. Pol -- Poles, Jews, and\nGermans. The industrial trend was coming from the west, so the Germans were a very important\nelement, establishing all kinds of industrial complexes, but the main thing how this textile\nbusiness came to be, is through -- I don\u2019t know th-the name would it be -- for people working at\nthe loom in their own apartments. So they would be home workers, and when you -- when I was\ngoing to school, from my home to my school, I would pass many homes where on the first floor\nyou could hear the click of the looms, one after another and you saw men sitting in the loom and\nworking. That -- that was the basic thing, what built, you know, industry in Lodz. And then of\ncourse, the -- were the big manufacturing things and Germans, it was mostly in German hands,\nbig, you know, big stores, and big commerce, led mostly by Germans and Jews and Poles. So it\nwas a three part city that lived pretty much in peace til the war broke out.",
        "Q: What was your home like? Wa -- did your mother work, by the way?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. So she was home?",
        "A: Yes, she was home, she was a homemaker. My father worked, and that is how I sort of\nlearned first hand from my mother about feminism. She never used the name, neither did I, but\nlooking back when I got in touch with my feminism in modern times here, in America, I was\nrecalling that where I -- where I got it from. And I don\u2019t know, life was good, and I knew that.\nWhy? Because I was very observant, and I was, you know, had many friends, and visited, and\nrevisited. And also each time when I went to another home, my mother was drilling me, what did\nyou see, what was the furniture, who lived there, etcetera.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: So I had to pay attention to all that, to give mother a report. So -- but I also saw the\nrelationship, you know, in the homes, and I always came back and ti -- this time that the\nrelationship were the best in my home, between my parents and between my parents and\nchildren. But i -- so what she was saying about her life was sometimes she got very a -- not\nsometimes, very often, she was very angry. She was also very laughing and singing, you know,\nso all -- all emotions were just on the surface. And she would say, when she was angry with my\nfather a little too much, I would say, \u201cMother, what do you want? Don\u2019t you realize you have the\nbest husband, and I have the best father?\u201d She says, \u201cI realize that, but look at his life and look at\nmy life. He gets up, I fix breakfast, he eats, he gets dressed. I see that he\u2019s properly dressed and\ngo -- he goes to work outside, for fun. What do I do? I clean, I cook, I clean, I cook, I shop and\nclean and cook. And I would like to work, I would like to be in the outside world.\u201d So I said,\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you?\u201d Because I cannot. You know, she was the daughter of a pretty well to do -- a\nconstruction -- a builder, he was building houses. And before the w -- first war, they were quite\nwell-to-do. After the war I saw a lot of paper money around, bags of paper money, and I knew\nthat that\u2019s where the money went. You know, there was a total wipe-out. And she says, \u201cI could\nnot work, my father would never let him, it would be a bad mark, if he -- his daughter, Shlomo\nGavcewicz\u2019s daughter would work? Never. And now, since I am married, if I would work, that\nwould mean that your father is not capable of supporting a family. So I cannot do that, it would\nbe hell. That\u2019s my life. But you, you will be different. You will get all the education so that you\ncan work, and life will be different for you.\u201d That was my mother.",
        "Q: It\u2019s very interesting. How -- do you remember about how old you were when you had this\nkind of a conversation?",
        "A: Oh, about 10 years.",
        "Q: About 10 years.",
        "A: Nine, 10 - 11.",
        "Q: But she didn\u2019t seem to say this with a lot of bitterness, 1t was just very straightforward.",
        "A: Not at all. Straightforward. And about bitterness and anger, I -- you know, particularly when I\nbecame a physician and I learned from families for women and I notice that the biggest\ncharacteristics of women\u2019s upbringing was don\u2019t be angry, cover it, don\u2019t be a -- and I -- at first I\ndidn\u2019t understand, but then I understood that those were the messages in this culture that families\ngave to girls. Anger is for boys, and for you, be nice and sweet. So, I remember then, you know,\nhow my life -- when I was angry, Mother never stopped me, only let me -- let me fume, then at\none point she says, \u201cOkay, you\u2019re angry. How long -- how long will it last?\u201d That stopped me. In\nother word, you can get angry, it\u2019s okay with me, but don\u2019t overdo that.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So that -- that was --",
        "Q: So you must have been very close to her. Somewhat --",
        "A: I was, yes.",
        "Q: -- yeah.",
        "A: And -- and without knowing, really, because she was not a doting mother. For that I had my\ngrandmother, her mother, you know? My grandmother\u2019s lap was always open and I can jump\nand be there, and she would cuddle me and hug me. My mother did not acknowledge any of\nthose things. It was all talk, but no close physical contact.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Other than, you know, there was a habit of kissing the hand of mommy and daddy when I\nwent to school.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. On -- as good-bye.",
        "Q: And when you came home, the same thing or not?",
        "A: No, not.",
        "Q: Only the -- only good-bye?",
        "A: O-O-Only the good-bye, yes.",
        "Q: So your mother was not physically affectionate, it was your -- your grandmother.",
        "A: No, not physic -- no, that\u2019s right, that I got from my grandmother, but mother always -- yo --\nit was a subject to talk with me, explain and ask give, you know, encouragement, to give reports,\nto observe and so on.",
        "Q: And was the grandmother your mother\u2019s mother?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And was she living in that house with you as well?",
        "A: Yes, we were living together, yes, yes.",
        "Q: So you had a lot of access to --",
        "A: And grandfather, it was the -- my grandfather\u2019s property. It was as -- a four story building,\napartment building and we lived there together in a large apartment, and my grandfather was a\ngood guy, he always watched as I was coming from school, with whom I am coming home,\netcetera. But ne -- also, no physical closeness. Only grandmother was th -- was for that.\nGrandfather I always had a good contact, I could talk to him, he would ask me things, but no\nphysical closeness.",
        "Q: And what about your father? Were you close with him?",
        "A: Very close.",
        "Q: You were.",
        "A: Very close, yes, ver -- we were very close. I was the first one, the only one for a long time --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and he was always watchful. He would make homework with me, and help me out and he\nwould read to me. And when I was a little older, nine, 10, he would bring me books. And, you\nknow, working in a newspaper, there were always books b-brought in by publishers, and so on,\nso he would bring me samples of those books. And they were pretty advanced books, Polish\nhistory, and the bloody Polish history of -- you know, Poland had a very bloody history. It is a\ncountry that is between Germany, Russia, Austria, the Hapsburgs, the Prussians, and the Norse.\nAnd though there was a part of history, there was the golden age of Poland in Middle Ages,\nwhere Poland was quite potent and -- militarily, and was attacking the neighbors, and also is\nknown for having the first university in Krakow, in Europe. So it was a pretty -- you know,\npretty acknowledged country, but bloody history, you know? Like we had the significant that I\nremember, and there were books written, the Norse 1-invaded, you know, the Swedes, the\nVikings, Middle Ages, invaded Poland and run down the whole country and the beautiful books\nthat the author got a Nobel Prize, part of the flood when the Vikings flooded the whole country.\nAnd the atrocities and interrogation and punishment. The underground places where they kept\nthe people that they -- you know, the invaders, bloody killings and so on. So I was exposed to\nthat really very early, so I knew history very well.",
        "Q: Did your father understand what your mother was si -- telling you about being independent?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: And he appreciated that?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: It was okay?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: But not for his wife?",
        "A: No, that was part of the culture.",
        "Q: That\u2019s culture.",
        "A: Both of them would not dare for my mother to work.",
        "Q: Right. But it was okay for that to be --",
        "A: I had -- I had the new generation.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, it\u2019s interesting.",
        "A: Different.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you eat lunch together? Did your father come home for lunch?",
        "A: It depends, you know, he worked shifts, you know, the ol -- the p -- the whole group worked\nshifts. He was a printer by -- by trade, so I remember him working this big linotype -- this big,\nmechanical machine came from America, and you know, I saw him working, and I -- I was\nfascinated by that. He also set types, he also wrote editorial. You know, there was -- everybody\ndid something of the same thing.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- so -- but they worked shifts, so I don\u2019t know how it was lunch. When I was going to\nschool I would take lunch and dinner was always early, two o\u2019clock, three o\u2019clock, that was the\nmain meal. We ate together, so everybody was at the table together.",
        "Q: So maybe that\u2019s what I mean. I\u2019m calling it lunch and I shouldn\u2019t, I should call it dinner,\nbecause --",
        "A: That\u2019s -- that was at dinnertime.",
        "Q: -- you had supper --",

        "A: When he worked that way, yes.",
        "Q: When he worked that way.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was that -- w-was -- was that nice, the dinner, the conversation? And were you included, or\nwere you really considered a kid, so you should be very quiet?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: I was included when I wanted to say something, yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right.",
        "A: I-It was a nice time.",
        "Q: And your grandmother and grandfather were --",
        "A: Separate. They --",
        "Q: Separate?",
        "A: That\u2019s right. We lived in one large apartment --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- but there were separate households.",
        "Q: That\u2019s interesting.",
        "A: And actually, you know, so they -- my grandmother was cooking for her husband, my\ngrandfather, and in earlier years there was, you know, my aunt was there, and my uncles. There\nwere three -- five children, including my mother. And then they got -- slowly they all got married\nand left home. So they was separate -- cooked separately, so it was a separate household.",
        "Q: In addition to being interested in history, what other interests did you have as a kid? Did you\nlike school?",
        "A: Oh, I loved school. To go -- oh, grade school, and high school, I loved school. My biggest\ninterest was natural sciences.",
        "Q: It was?",
        "A: Zoology, and bi -- bot -- botany.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes, mm-hm. And I remember, every summer we went on vacation in the country, you know?\nThat was a habit, a custom, not only for the rich by -- but middle class as well, and maybe lower,\ntoo. You would rent a cheap place, or more expen -- whatever your finances were, in the country,\nwhich would be maybe 50 kilometers, 30 kilometers outside the city, and spend the summertime,\nwhich was a long time, it was two and a half months. School was out. And my father would\ncome for weekends, and we stayed, you know, children, very often there was extended family,\ncousins. So that was a wonderful life. And each summer, after summer, I would come home with\nloads of samples of leaves and -- pressed leaves, ple -- pressed flowers. Preserved salamanders\nand snakes, and -- you know, things like that. My father taught me how to catch snakes and\npreserve them. That was for my classes, you know.",
        "Q: So you caught live snakes?",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: And then you killed them?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, okay. And then you --",
        "A: And salamanders.",
        "Q: And salamanders.",
        "A: And frogs, yes.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: So I was, you know that -- every summer. That was my -- my doing. And catch butterflies and\nkill them and make shows of different butterflies. It was fun. Very busy summers.",
        "Q: I can see that. And then you would take them to the class, and --",
        "A: Oh yes, I would take them to school, and show off, and [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So you did a lot of work for the teachers, actually, without knowing it.",
        "A: Oh, I didn\u2019t look at it like that --",
        "Q: Right, I understand.",
        "A: -- I was just showing what I did during my summertime.",
        "Q: And the -- the other kids, you told me you were friends. Were they as interested in school and\nstudy as you, or --",
        "A: Some were.",
        "Q: Some.",
        "A: Yes. And then there were some kids as we got older, got interest very much in the social\nissues, which was a burning question in Poland in those times between wars. You see, to our\nright was Russia, that just became Bolshevik Russia, and that was a big experiment, and we\ncouldn\u2019t stop talking about it. You know, kids. Grown-ups, too, but it was a forbidden thing to\neven think about. Ye -- Communism was forbidden by the Polish reactionary government, and\nother governments, you know, it was a sort of a new things, and so that was all discussed in hush\nwith friends, so I had some friends that were very interested in the question as was I, and I was\nreading to no end, all the, you know, chief writers of Communism, Socialism. And I know that\nwas not against what my father was thinking, but we nev -- it was unspoken because if you were\ncaught and went to -- the thing was that the kids that were then caught in the -- this Communist\nspirit, and infiltration, you know, there was infiltration from Soviet Union by youths, too, and\nyou could hear murmurs, you know, when we were going out of school by Friday, come to the\nmeeting, come to the meeting here and here. And we knew that was Communist meetings, but\nyou didn\u2019t dare to think about it because you could get expelled from school, and kids were\ngetting expelled from getting involved in Communist cells. But the curiosity at that age is so\nstrong, that I could just not -- you know, put it together aside. So we had couple kids that were\non the same wavelengths and we would read and discuss, and discuss, particularly about w-what\nis -- how -- what are the best way to edu -- to bring up children. And you know, part of the\nCommunist agenda was to -- to -- to put a wedge between parents and children and took away ch\n-- take away children, often to -- for separate education and so on. And that was dangerous stuff,\nyou know, at home to talk about. But we talked nevertheless, and what we think, what would be\nbetter, there was endless discussions. And then one time -- this friend of mine that was mostly\nknowledgeable said, look, there is a meeting such and such a day, such and such a place, I have a\nfriend and he wants us to go, a-and participate there. So I said, \u201cYou know, Stephanie, it\u2019s\ndangerous.\u201d \u201cOh, who cares, come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll go.\u201d So we went, and that\nwas the friend that took us there, and it was in the Polish section of town. Actually, 1t was in the\nsection of town that later was turned into the ghetto for Jews. So we were in there on a little,\nsmall, apartment, you know, very high up, and there were people around the table. It was cold, it\nwas winter, 1t was bitter cold. And there was a little iron stove that was giving a little heat, and a\nlot of people, and so we were sitting there. And you know the saying is that poverty s-smells.\nThat was just my experience, the poverty stunk there. It was so poor. People were from the very,\nvery poor population, sitting, and there was this guy, and this guy just came from Russia.\nCommunist, propagandist, and was talking, and everybody was hushed and listening. And he\nwas talking what a great country Soviet Union is, how things are good, how poor people are\ndoing well, how the regime 1s taking care of poor people, etcetera, etcetera, and of course they all\nlistened and loved it. And, okay, so we went -- you know, that was after that, went home and I\nhad all kinds of -- they were really not mixed feelings, I understood very well why this guy\nlooked and was received like a -- as a prophet. You know, smelling the smell of poverty, and the\nposture of those poor people, you know, the babushkas and so on. I said, well they are looking\nfor a prophet. They have it so bad that I am not surprised that they are looking for that. But then I\nsaid, you know, as for -- later on I said, well, it\u2019s not my life. I am not part of it. He da -- you\nknow, he cannot speak to me, he did not speak to me. And that was it for me, you know? The\ncontact with Communism, and the aura of paradise, but I understood that. So that was this\nepisode of my life.",
        "Q: How old were you when you went to that meeting, do you think?",
        "A: 14 year -- 13 - 14. But we were engaged in serious --",
        "Q: Serious discussion.",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",

        "Q: -- Trotsky?",
        "A: -- sure.",
        "Q: You were?",
        "A: Yes, and I thought Marx was great, and Engels was great. Oh, no question about it. And I had\nthe books and I didn\u2019t have them open, but I knew my parents did see them, and they did not tell\nme don\u2019t read them.",
        "Q: Don\u2019t read them.",
        "A: In other words, learn everything you can.",
        "Q: Right. Was -- was there any political discussion in school, or not?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. Not [indecipherable |",
        "A: No. Forbidden. And then another interesting thing. This guy whom -- my friend who brought\nmy friend and me to the cell, Communist cell, was in ghetto later. I had no contact with him,\nnothing close, but I knew who he is. And one day he was arrested in the ghetto for killing his\nmother and keeping her body in his place, and using his -- her ration cards to get bread.",
        "Q: So he could get two rations. Wow. So something about the --",
        "A: Is there a correlation or not? But I say, well, okay. What can you say? You know, that -- that\nwas just something to -- to note about people.",
        "Q: Now, your father was a Bundist?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think he was a -- officially a Bundist, but a Bundist\u2019s, you know, perception.",

        "A: All the time. My father was in -- at the newspaper.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Right? And he al -- always was bringing news from the -- from the first sort of thing. And\nthere was always a lot of discussion about anti-Semitism in the government, and what they are\ndoing. And the big discussion was in the Parliament about the Jewish question and the way that\nJews, they killed the animals. You know, for food, what do you call that?",
        "Q: Oh, Kaszrut rules, you mean?",
        "A: Kaszrut -- ritual killing.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Right?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And if the government wanted to do away with special way Jews were killing their animals.\nYou have no idea how much time was spent on that in the Sejm which was the Congress, and my\nfather knew it from the news coming year in, and year out.",

        "Q: Paula, I just want to go back a little bit. What kind of a school did you attend? Was this a\nregular public school, a mixed public school, or not?",
        "A: Well, it was considered a regular public school, but it also was clear that the public school\nwas segregated into -- aro -- along the line of sex and relig -- religion. So I was attending a girl\u2019s\nschool for Jewish girls.",
        "Q: And so would there be a girl\u2019s school for Catholic girls?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Huh. Were your friends mixed in your neighborhood? Were you with Catholics as well as\nJews, or were you primarily with Jewish kids?",
        "A: We lived in a mixed neighborhood. See, there were Jewish neighborhoods, but we lived in a -\n- a-and some Jews not, but the majority lived in Jewish quarters. But we lived in a mixed\nneighborhood. So my best friend was a Catholic girl next door, which was a Catholic family, a --\nwith five children. And I was the only child, so I was there a lot. One of the girls was my age,\nJadwiga, and we were best friends in both homes. And it was a wonderful friendship. Every year\nI will spend that Christmastime in their home at the Christmas tree, and you know, Santa Claus\ncoming, I was part of it. The only thing I couldn\u2019t do was to eat there, because we -- m -- respect\nKaszrut, y-you know? So --",
        "Q: So you were kosher?",
        "A: Kosher, yes. So -- mixed kosher, but still kosher enough that I could not eat any non-Jewish\nhome. But other than that, you know, I was part of their home, and it -- 1t was wonderful. They\nwere wonderful people. He -- Mr. Wojkowski worked on the railroad, and he was sort of a\nchunky guy with big whiskers, you know, like that, oh. Lovely man. And his wife was a chunky\nwoman, she cooked, you know, with big pots and so on. So -- I -- I -- I loved being there, a-and it\nwas great. Two things. In their home, on one wall, there was a big portrait of the -- 0-of -- of\nMary, and it was the black Mary of Matka Boska Czestochowska. Matka Boska, mother of God,\nfrom Czestochowa. And that was a holy part where some -- this portrait, this mother of Jesus\nsaved Czestochowa, stopped in Czestochowa, which was a western border city, stopped the\ninflux of the Vikings. Her portrait stopped the Vikings.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Imagine?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: So in very -- homes that respect that, it was her portrait with a red light on top of it that\nburned day and night. And I was so scared of that portrait. I remember that, cause there was a\nsuch a powerful black woman, you know?",
        "Q: Right. That\u2019s a very big symbol in Poland, isn\u2019t it?",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And it being a Catholic country, you had on holidays, eastern and other, you would have\npeople marching in the street with the holy -- holy pictures, and singing. It was part of life. The\nbad part for -- of that life for Jews was like that. Every Easter before the holiday, there came a\npriest with a bunch of holy water, and he was going -- it was a four story building, from top of\nthe building to the bottom and sprinkle -- sprinkling holy water and saying pray -- prayers. When\nhe was coming, Jewish people had to stay indoors. We could not get out. Okay? That was the\nanti-Semitism from top, right? Also, before Easter there was always, every Easter, there was a\nstory written up in papers, spoken, that the Jews caught a Christian boy, killed him and used his\nblood to bake matzohs. And that day, Jews were beaten up all around the city, just for the sake of\nbeating Jews. So that came with the holidays as well.",
        "Q: So how did this affect you as a young Jewish girl growing up, since you have -- you were\nliving in a mixed neighborhood, your best friend is Catholic. Does this provoke a kind of conflict\nin you, or this is just the way it is? I mean, I ca --",
        "A: That\u2019s life.",
        "Q: That\u2019s life.",
        "A: So at home there were alls -- always -- the oy veys, and who next, and who will be beaten,\nwho will be killed, and be careful on the street, stay home, don\u2019t expose yourself and things like\nthat. Between me and Jadwiga, we had -- we were all very curious girls, and all through the year,\nwe would walk on the street and have heavy discussions, mostly about religion.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. So the point of it was, whose religion is best?",
        "Q: That was the point? And?",
        "A: The end result. So we would bring up our arguments.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And my argument, it is the oldest religion, look how many years, 5,000 plus years, da da da\nda, we gave the Bible, we got Moses and -- and her was again about Jesus and so on, and so on.\nAnd then we play on the street, that was just part of the routine. And then when she or I would\nrun out of arguments, I don\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t know what to say any more to counter, I said wait a\nminute, I will be back, and run to my mother. And she did the same when she ran out. We would\nrun to our mothers and ask how to continue our discussion, and come back.",
        "Q: But this was not an argument. You weren't --",
        "A: We had -- it was a discussion.",
        "Q: It\u2019s really a discussion.",
        "A: It was really a discussion.",
        "Q: Did anybody win in the end?",
        "A: I\u2019m sure if she once, I wa -- you know --",
        "Q: Both of you si -- but it never -- it didn\u2019t affect your relationship?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. It\u2019s interesting because often that kind of a conflict you don\u2019t want to have with\nsomebody, so you avoid the discussion, but not you folks.",
        "A: Ha -- we had very smart mothers.",
        "Q: Yes, I guess you did.",
        "A: Both of us.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That, you know, knew how to continue our discussion --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- between us without getting hostile.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Cause they could have, if they wanted to --",
        "Q: Oh yes.",
        "A: -- they could -- they could have interfered that way.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But no, they just gave enough material to keep talking.",
        "Q: Did you ever want to be not Jewish, before --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No, no. And then to -- the only son -- you know, that I think there were five girls and one son,\nTadek, Tadeusz, was a nice guy. And Christmas time, of course, I was there, sitting in the circle,\nand then yo -- Santa Claus was coming and giving things and so on, and so I was part of it. And\nthen one time, I probably was six years old, seven maybe, Santa Claus is coming and does the\nsame thing, and I looked at him and I said, who is he? And I say in the moment, \u201cTadek!\u201d And\nthey all broke out laughing, because I -- you know, it was the first time that I --",
        "Q: That you realized.",
        "A: -- that I realized who Santa Claus is. And then later when I was thinking about it and\nlaughing, I said, well, if anybody should be Santa Claus, Tadek 1s fine. I like him, he wa --",
        "Q: You like him, he was good. Did they ever take you to church, or did you ever take them to\nsynagogue or was that also si -- you just didn\u2019t do that, right?",
        "A: You\u2019re kidding. No.",
        "Q: I -- I guess Iam. You didn\u2019t do that.",
        "A: It was forbidden. I tell you that this was so forbidden and such a touchy subject that I didn\u2019t\nknow the real -- realize that til late -- lately. The idea was that I was told -- excuse me -- was\nwhen I pass a church, I should run quickly and be gone. Don\u2019t look, just pass it quickly, and\nthat\u2019s it. I don\u2019t understood -- I -- I don\u2019t think I understood that commandment, you know, not\nto be there.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember why it was lately that I understood that.",
        "Q: You mean you had forgotten that you were told that?",
        "A: No, I remembered it all the time. Cause somebody I -- you know, cause a -- a -- in my life\nhere, I was in Catholic church or Protestant ch -- numerous times, on occasion of my friend\u2019s\ndifferent traditions, you know, weddings, birth of a child or something like that.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Funerals. But I -- you know, somebody asked me so why -- why was it such a -- such a -- you\nknow, anathema to avoid the church? And I -- I think it came with the realization how much anti-\nSemitism is connected with Christian religion. That it, for the 2,000 years since the death of\nJesus, Jews were accused of killing him, and encouraged by the church to hate Jews and kill\nJews. And it still goes on, til now.",
        "Q: But that wasn\u2019t your consciousness as a kid. You -- you knew there was a problem with being\nJewish in some way, certainly on these holidays when you knew you had --",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- right? But in general this was not -- this was not an every day feeling of yours, or was it?",
        "A: If not every day, very frequent.",
        "Q: It was frequent?",
        "A: Beating Jews was on the agenda. Plus, you know, that news that my father was bringing about\nthe Congress fighting Jews. Now, the ritual killing of animals, you know what that is, 1-1t -- it\ndepends on the humanitarian point to kill the animals in -- animal as quickly and p -- as pain free\nas possible, which means that the guy that is killing, using the knife, is looking for a artery in the\nneck of the animal and cuts the biggest artery, one or two on both sides. So that the death come\nquickest. And the government said no, don\u2019t do that. It is a Jewish -- Jewish thing. We kill it\ndifferently, which is not so humanitarian according to Jewish thinking -- Jewish ritual thinking.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, you know, I heard about -- you know, the -- the war against Jews really, the fight against\nJews from top to bottom. Killing on the street --",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Was it typical for most of Poland, or was this more in Lodz that -- that the schools\nwere segregated by sex and religion? Was this typical at the time?",
        "A: That was typical.",
        "Q: It was typical.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So that you and your friend -- and obviously when you\u2019re walking, you\u2019re going to walk to\nseparate schools.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And then you come together later.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Did that bother you?",
        "A: That was it --",
        "Q: That was it.",
        "A: -- that was life.",
        "Q: Were you worried, as a young Jewish girl?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. You figured you were okay, that this was --",
        "A: I was okay, I was protected by my parents --",
        "Q: Parents, right.",
        "A: -- life inside was good, life in school was good for me.",
        "Q: Would you have considered yourself wealthy?",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about --",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: -- if you ask me then.",
        "Q: You -- you lived in a comfortable place.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: You were at -- you had good food.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You had clothes, you had a -- a rabbit\u2019s fur coat until they got you a cloth coat, yes?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So you were f -- you were comfortable?",
        "A: Absolutely, very comfortable.",
        "Q: When Hitler took over in Germany in \u201933, when the Nazis come in --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- do you -- you hear about it, cause you\u2019re father\u2019s a journalist, you know.",
        "A: The radio was on all the time --",
        "Q: It was.",
        "A: -- with his speeches, with Hitler\u2019s speeches.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re 11 years old, so you really become conscious of what\u2019s going on?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes. And is Poland then becoming more radically right at that time as well, so there\u2019s more\nFascism in Poland at the time?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So it becomes worse in Poland as well?",
        "A: Right. And there was also big discussion about it, what\u2019s happening, what should Poland do --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- with the idea, you know, is what is happening there, and I think the resolution day came for\nis to -- to go to the right and to meet Hitler halfway, sort of be friends with Hitler --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- to avoid what may happen, which they did not avoid anyway.",
        "Q: Right. Do you remember before the war, in \u00b039, that there\u2019s any discussion about we\u2019ve got to\nget out of here, they\u2019re going to do something? There is discussion.",
        "A: And how. A lot of people got out. You had to have a lot of money, and you had to consider\nrunning away from your life.",
        "Q: Mm. It\u2019s a terrifying thing, isn\u2019t it?",
        "A: It became terrifying more and more as -- after 33. The relatives that we had in -- in Germany,\nin the Saar, my father\u2019s mother, my grandmother, and one of the daughters, Erna, who at that\ntime was married and had one child, and couple uncles emigrated to s -- to the Saar, Germany.\nThat was for -- I think that was in 19 -- 19 -- maybe \u201930. That was for economical reasons,\nbecause the depression in Poland was very bitter, and Germany, [indecipherable] and Germany\nhad it better. So for economic reasons they moved. Now, when Hitler came, the question was --\nthey were under Hitler, we were still free. What do they do? What does the family do? So, I think\neven before \u00b039, part of the family m-moved to Palestine, at that time, you know, Israel was not\nexisting --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- but to Palestine. And my father approved of that, you know, get out of Germany. Then, you\nknow, a year or two passed, or so, and they could not establish themselves. Econ -- economy in\nPalestine was horrendous and they could not make it. So they went back to Europe, and my\nfather was so mad. They should have stayed, do you know what\u2019s coming, don\u2019t they see what is\ncoming? They went to France, not to Germany, and lived in France. So that what my father\nthought about, you know, moving --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] different.",
        "A: -- but for himself and so on, there was not the urgency, there was not the money and there\nwere Mother\u2019s parents, aged parents that -- Mother was very reluctant to sit -- to separate herself\nfrom. So there were endless discussion, nothing happened. Then we got a -- eventually what\nhappened to the family that went eventually to friends was that my aunt was taken from the street\nof Paris to a death camp. My uncle and the three boys, my cousins, with whom we were\ncorresponding, were lucky enough to escape and stay in Switzerland. Because many were turned\naway, Switzerland was -- was not very kind. And they were interned in a camp for Jews --",
        "Q: In Switzerland?",
        "A: -- in Switzerland throughout the war. So the positive side was they survived in relative okay\ncondition, the negative that they were treating -- treated like criminals in Switzerland, in camp.\nSo that was this part of the family. Now shortly before \u201939, people were running away on foot to\nRussia as a way to escape Hitler. Many Jews did, and the question was, why don\u2019t we? I was the\none to instigating into -- who was instigating a run. Don\u2019t you see what\u2019s happening? We cannot\nstay here. Run. My mother says, if you want to run, go. It would be okay with me, but I cannot.\nHere are my grand -- my parents, I cannot leave them, so I won\u2019t go. And my father too, there\nwas a reluctance to leave on the simple premise, that\u2019s my home, that\u2019s my country. I don\u2019t want\nto run. Who can force me to run? And I don\u2019t have enough money, and beside they were news\ntoo, that people that invested money in running, to -- making plans to go to South America for\ninstance, we later find out that that was a lie, the offices took money and got -- transferred the\nJews to Gestapo. So there was no firm belief that you can really run, because you may lose\neverything and your life anyway. So that was the decision, to stay.",
        "Q: Did you think a war was coming?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: Did you think a war was coming?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t think, we knew it\u2019s coming.",
        "Q: You knew?",
        "A: Yes, we knew.",
        "Q: So when you all s -- when your father said to his relatives, why are you leaving Palestine, you\nknow what\u2019s happening --",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- he -- that\u2019s what he thought?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: And you thought so too?",
        "A: We took Hitler\u2019s \u201cMein Kampf\u201d literally. Hitler was still talking on the radio and me -- we I\nmean, my father and my mother and a bunch of other people believed that that is his plan and he\nis following it. There was no discussion that he will stop, unless friends in England will\nintervene, which they did not, they brou -- broke the pact with Poland.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They supposed to stand by Poland and they broke the pact, and they didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: And did you -- did you also feel that there was a particular vulnerability to the Jewish\npopulation, to you and your family because of what you heard from Hitler?",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: Absolutely.",
        "A: We believe in that.",
        "Q: So there\u2019s no question.",
        "A: There\u2019s no question. In our mind there was no question. Particularly that -- I think that was\n\u00b038, Hitler led -- Hitler ran out jew -- from Germany, Jews that were not German citizens, that\nwere Polish citizens. There were a lot of Jews from Poland that were in Germany, and they were\nnot citizens. He send them back to Poland. And we were in touch with those Jews, particularly in\nLodz, you know, we knew there was a bunch of young Jews coming, so we got, you know, our\ngroup got in touch with those guys, and they were telling us what\u2019s happening in Germany, and\nabout Hitler\u2019s pra -- plans, and to take it seriously. So for many ways, we knew to take him\n[indecipherable].",
        "Q: Right, right.",

        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: There was no question.",
        "Q: Let me change the subject for a minute, because I realize I\u2019ve forgotten about your sister.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Your sister was born in 1926? Four years, or si-six years?",

        "Q: Did your mother try to explain to you what was going to happen? Or did she just -- your\nmother got bigger and she arrived.",
        "A: Yeah, so -- oh, she -- it was talk, she let me feel her belly.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: She was -- my mother was pretty open, and --",
        "Q: Right. [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- you know, sort of down to earth. And that it\u2019s coming, but we didn\u2019t know of course, who.\nThey wanted -- my mother wanted a boy, but -- probably both parents wanted a boy, they had a\ngirl already.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But the sister came and here she was, and I had to adjust. It was horrible. And I was so mad\nbecause later on, you know -- my mother didn\u2019t expect me to raise my sister or do much for her,\nreally, she never did. I have to say, she was a wonderful mother. My father had chronic TB, you\nknow, which was endemic in -- in -- in Poland. And so he would get attacks, you know, of some\nbleeding from the lungs. And she never expected me to serve as a nurse or do things. She was --\nthat was her duty, and so on. A-And about my sister, too, that was her child and so on. But then\nwhen my sister was walking, going for a walk, she would ask me sometimes to take her for a\nwalk in the neighborhood. I protested, but I took her. My friends loved her, she was a cute girl. It\nwas pretty horrible.",
        "Q: But you were not happy to have this child around?",

If you help me Ill wash the dishes for you, and things like that. It was\nnot pleasant, you know, really. But she was growing up, and then we sort of parted ways, you\nknow. She had her life and I had my life, til we were sent to Auschwitz.",

        "Q: So it\u2019s September, 1939. What do y -- what do you remember about those first days in the\nwar? What -- what picture is in your head?",
        "A: Well, you know, before the war, there were all kinds of rumors coming from northern Poland.\nYou know, Gdansk -- y-you know the name of the city, Danzig German, Gdansk, Polish. It was a\n-- avery sore spot between Poland and Germany. Poland in s -- Danzig -- Gdansk and Danzig,\nboth countries thought it belongs to them. Finally, after the first World War, there was this\nagreement that Poland got a little bit of corridor, because Poland wanted some access to the sea,\nBaltic Sea. And if -- 1f Gdansk become Danzig, you know, Poland would have nothing. So they\nagreed to a small corridor that would lead to the Baltic Sea, so that both countries had access,\nand that Gdansk, or Danzig -- Poland will have access to -- to Gdansk to use it as a port. They\nwere building another port, Gdynia, but that was later. Okay, so that was sort of a sore spot\nbetween the two countries, and a sore spot to erupt. The news came that Polish troops crossed\ninto Germany across this small corridor, and germa -- Germany was ready to attack. What turned\nout later that the troops -- Polish troops were Germans dressed in Polish uniforms. So they\nprovoked that, and they attacked. In Lodz what did we do? Well, we knew they are coming, and\nwe developed, you know, sort of on the street, some defense. We will be watching or walking the\nstreets, particularly the youth, and I was part of it, and watching for signs of airplanes coming,\nGerman airplanes at-attacking. So we were watching -- you know, walking around the blocks for\na couple days. And then finally the news came on the radio that the German are on Polish so --\nsoil, and they are coming. So what I remember about that? I was there -- we were there, my\ngrandmother and my mother. I think Father was at work, and my mother burst out crying. And\nshe says, \u201cI won\u2019t make it, not a second time. Lived through the first World War, it was horrible,\nI won\u2019t be able to make it.\u201d And to me it was, my God, if Mother says that, I am doomed as well,\nI cannot take it, I cannot do anything like that without my mommy. So that was it. So we were\nstill marching and watching, and watching and reporting to the elders. Nothing was happening,\nand then all of a sudden we ha -- we heard some bombs falling. But Lodz did not suffer from the\nbombing. It was, you know, here and there [indecipherable] nothing was happening, and one day\nthe troops were marching in. And the Germans were in. And we were still waiting. We were\nating -- waiting, and pretty soon the Germans started to paste orders on the w -- on the street\nwalls, you know, the special walls when you put -- what do you call it when you put news?",
        "Q: Posters?",
        "A: Posters. About, you know, some orders what not to do, times and so on and be home, etcetera,\netcetera. And was a di -- probably the worst thing then that happened in those moments was that\nPolish -- Polish neighbors, particularly the -- there was a Polish couple that was taking care of\nthe building, you know, sort of administering cleaning and so on. And some others started --\nbegan to go to Jewish neighbors and taking out things, furniture, etcetera, etcetera. Sort of\nunprovoked, nothing, it was the Pole that started the war with the Jews. And I remember I was so\nfurious about it. We had a neighbor, another neighbor who was a middle-aged woman, a\nbusinesswoman, she was a widow, and she and her son were running a little factory, they were\nmaking cardboard boxes. And she spoke perfectly German and so on, and I talked with her and I\nsay, \u201cWhat do we do, Mrs. Kronenburg?\u201d And then I say, \u201cWell, let\u2019s do something.\u201d And she\nsays, \u201cHow about you and me will go to the German quarters and report our neighbors, they are\nrobbing us?\u201d I said okay, and Mother said okay, she didn\u2019t want to go. And that Mrs.\nKronenburg spoke German very well. I spoke German too because German was second language\nin -- in -- in high school, foreign language. So we went to the German commando, very innocent,\nyou know, and we asked to talk to the chief, and we tell him such and such, with disgust, that we\nare being ro-robed -- robbed, and that -- is that legal, is that how it should be? And he says no, it\nshould not be. So he s -- asks an officer to come with us and stop the rob-robbery from our\nneighbors. And the officer came with us and talked to the neighbors that were robbing. Then they\nnot [indecipherable]. So we were very proud of that.",
        "Q: Little did you think what would happen there.",
        "A: Oh my God, the chutzpah that we had, right? I mean, not --",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: -- innocent.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Then there came the announcement about Jews, pertaining Jews. All Jews had to wear a star -\n- the stars of davi -- David, and restriction of being on the street, and more and more of that. And\nthen pretty soon, as they settled in, you know, sort of, in Lodz, atrocities started to -- catching\nJews on the street, taking them to the Gestapo for beating, interrogation. Slugging Jews with\nbeards on the street, where mobs were hanging around, and enjoying -- the Polish mobs, and\nenjoying that. That was September, and the announcement of the ghetto, where the ghetto would\nbe, and that by April everybody will have to be there, moved out. School, we did not start, you\nknow, it was September, I supposed to be in high school, you know?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: 12\u2122 grade. Did not start, it was closed.",
        "Q: Was that true for non-Jewish kids, for the Gentile kids as well as for the Jewish kids, there\njust was no school? Or you didn\u2019t -- do you --",

        "Q: You don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: I know it was for Jewish kids.",
        "Q: Right. And the school were used then as sort of office space to make lists of Jewish\npopulation, we were sitting and making lists of people, this quota, this quota, that quota. And of\nplaces in the ghetto, design ghetto, of the houses, house numbers, street numbers etcetera, where\n-- where people were sent. So for good while, you know, kids were -- me among them, were\nbusy doing that.",
        "Q: So they had the kids who would have been at school being s -- pupils --",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",

        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- logistical work.",
        "A: Yes, yes, right. So -- okay, so the atmosphere was totally changed. Fear, unex -- unexpected\ncan be expected any time, beating, arrest, sending here, there, we didn\u2019t know what was going\non. After all, the -- within six days the German army occupied the whole Poland.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The total country. And as we were joking but not so happily about the Polish army that had\nbeautiful officers, you know, famous for their sitting on the horses, the officer on the horses in\ncorsets and handsome, and [indecipherable]. And the tanks, the German ca -- tanks, took them\npretty seriously and didn\u2019t -- all that they wanted with themself. No defense, no defense. It was\noccupation, and what can I say, 1-1-1t was -- it sort of was unimagabable -- the unimagable was\nhappening. A-A state of being nowhere, being nothing, and who knows? And nothing good\ncoming.",
        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s for sure, that you knew.",
        "A: Yes, so, we know that.",
        "Q: Did you wear the star?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: Did you wear the Jewish star?",
        "A: Sure, yes.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And did your little sister have to wear?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Yes. So everybody did.",
        "A: Yes, yes. And then it was something like that, and the family -- Mother\u2019s sister lived in\nWarsaw, and Warsaw was still free, and then already we knew that Warsaw will be treated\ndifferently than Lodz. See, the Germans in-incorporated L\u00e9dz into the Reich, they changed the\nmi -- map, and that became part of Germany, and got the name of Litmannstadt. Warsaw was the\nfree territory, 1t was just occupied -- a territory. And we were thinking maybe we should go to\nWarsaw. So the plan was for me and my -- a cousin that lived next door, a little older than\nmyself, that we will go to Warsaw, and bring some stuff there in preparation for the families to\ngo there. Well, so we went, and I didn\u2019t look very Semitic, and neither did she, but we were\nwearing the stars anyway, but we had some babushka, you know, around ourselves, and went to\nWarsaw. Uneventful. We made it back and forth, forth and back. So I saw my -- my aunt there,\nand her son and husband. And they were at limbo just as we were. So I deposited some stuff that,\nyou know, we could use when we come, and -- and that was it, I never saw my aunt again, you\nknow, and I don\u2019t know what happened to her, but she didn\u2019t survive and neither did her husband\nor her son, a little boy at that ttme. And we came back, a-a-and that was that. And pretty soon --\nsoon we were transported into the ghetto.",
        "Q: Did you think that you and your family should have moved to Warsaw, or you didn\u2019t?",
        "A: [had no opinion, I didn't know what to do. Ni -- nobody knew.",
        "Q: I see, so -- so all you were doing was transporting these things --",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- in case Someone made the decision.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, in case we would go there --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- to have something there.",
        "Q: Le-Let me ask you a small question. What about your friend, your Catholic friend? The war\ncomes, and Jews are clearly segregated in some very significant way, what happens with that\nfamily and you?",
        "A: Very soon after the Germans came, there were many arrests. He was -- Mr. Wojkowski was\narrested one of the first, and killed. Why? He was working for years on the railways. Railroads\nwere the most important thing -- way of transportation in Poland for the Poles, and was to be for\nthe Germans. Though the German had airplanes by that time, it was different. But that was very\nimportant for the Germans, to destroy the railways. So they took all that knowledge --\nknowledgeable workers, and shot them out. And Mr. Wojkowski was killed. And then the family\nmoved out to somewhere, they had relative in the country, so they moved in the count -- you\nknow, to the country.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Since we mentioning that, it was after the war, in Lodz, when I was back in Lodz and going\nsomeplace, that from far away I thought and then I knew that I saw one of the sisters, Wojkowsk1\nsisters, not Jadwiga. A-And -- and you cannot imagine what was going in my mind. I did not\nwant to approach her, because I thought, what if she asks me the question about my family. And\nI have to tell her I survived and they didn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t face up to that. So I let it by. That was\n[indecipherable] friends.",
        "Q: So you never saw them again, I think? No? No. So you were hard on yourself.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: You were hard on yourself, weren\u2019t you?",
        "A: I felt it was all my fault.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: What didn\u2019t I do? How comes I am here, and have nobody to show up that I supposed to save.\nProtecting my sister. So that what -- what happened.",
        "Q: Did you -- did you see brutality bef -- before the ghetto, did you see the Nazis on the street, or\nthe Poles, taking Jews and beating them up, did you see that?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: That must have been extremely difficult.",
        "A: We saw those pictures. We heard about those pictures on radio, what\u2019s happening in\nGermany, so we were not surprised, you know.",
        "Q: But the brutalization must do something to you, especially as a kid, when you first see it.\nYou\u2019re not -- you\u2019re not used to people being brutal like that, even if you see photographs, right?\nI mean, I don\u2019t know exactly what it does, but 1t must do something, to -- cause violence has a --\na -- I don\u2019t know, is a -- is a -- a level of violation about it that\u2019s so powerful, 1t seems to me,\nespecially for a young person.",
        "A: Tell you the truth, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: We knew that was happening. We saw mostly from the far. I was not exposed close by to the\nbrutality like, you know, dragging Jews by the beard, you know, the --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- Orthodox Jews, and beating them. I did not see it from close by, I have to say.",
        "Q: Mm. Let me ask you another question. Before the ghetto was actually formed, the head --\nwhat they called the -- the elder of the Jews, it was decided upon, and it was Rumkowsk1.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Had you heard about him before the ghetto, as head of the orphanage? Had you heard\nanything?",
        "A: We knew he was the head of the orphanage, and then he became a member of the Jewish\nCommittee --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and then he became the Alteste of the ghetto, but I didn\u2019t --",
        "Q: And that was it.",
        "A: -- have any close relationship --",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t [indecipherable] right.",
        "A: -- of people close by to him.",
        "Q: Right. Do you remember your parents talking about why is he being made head of a -- head of\nthe Jews? And this is what you -- no. Right.",
        "A: I am sure there was talk like that.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: But it was talk subdued by the feeling what\u2019s happening, the end of the world.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: We have no power, we -- we -- we are totally dependent now on Hitler and his promise to kill\nus. Tha-That was the essence, he is going to kill us.",
        "Q: So you believed very early?",
        "A: Certainly m-much earlier than Roosevelt did.",
        "Q: And earlier than when death camps are actually in existence?",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Right. So does -- do you have nightmares?",
        "A: Oh, I used to.",
        "Q: As a kid?",
        "A: No, not as a kid.",

        "A: Yes, uh-huh, yeah.",
        "Q: So it doesn\u2019t happen at the time?",
        "A: No, not now. I -- I think that is the best thing that psychotherapy did for me. I was able to\nsleep again. If nothing else, it did much more.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: But that was the biggest thing, that I can sleep now.",
        "Q: You can sleep again.",
        "A: And sleep well.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Not plagued by nightmares.",
        "Q: During this beginning period, do -- do you remember feeling scared all the time? I\u2019m trying to\nfigure out ho -- you know, what it\u2019s -- what it\u2019s like on a daily basis. Would you feel scared\nwhen you see a German soldier, or --",
        "A: N -- that came much later.",
        "Q: It came later. So not in the beginning.",
        "A: Not in the beginning.",

        "A: Oh yes, it was on poster, that at such and such date, all Jews have to be transported --\ntransport themselves to the ghetto, to -- a-and says what streets there were -- you know, w-what\nquarter, that means.",
        "Q: And it was Baluty, right?",
        "A: Baluty, yes.",
        "Q: And how do you pronounce that, Baluty?",
        "A: Baluty.",
        "Q: Baluty. And that was where you went when you were younger, to this cell, it was in that area,\nwhen you went to that Communist discussion.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, it was in that area, yes.",
        "Q: It\u2019s the same -- same section.",
        "A: Mm-hm. The poorest arna -- area in town.",
        "Q: Area of -- of -- in the town. And did you know where you were going to go? H-How was it\ndecided where --",
        "A: They formed a department of housing. Jews were in charge of it, and the Jew -- the housing\ndepartment had lists of the streets of the houses and how many square feet were available in each\napartment or room. And they were assigning people, people working in that department were\nassigning customers that came to the -- to that place, square feet, the street number, and the -- the\nhouse -- you know, the street number, and the place they will live. So it was -- and I worked for\nthat department for a few years. And I was, you know, giving people places to live.",
        "Q: So how did you decide? You\u2019d say four people have x number of square feet, and so this is\navailable, you go here?",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Was there corruption in this process?",
        "A: I\u2019m sure. Not among my level.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. But at some level.",
        "A: Mm-hm. At the highest level.",
        "Q: Because the conditions in this area are awful, in terms of just ordinary sanitation. In terms of\nwater and toilets and baths and -- there\u2019s practically nothing.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Right?",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: Not where you were living.",
        "A: No. Amazingly enough for all that squalor and density of population, the sanitation was pretty\ngood. The -- the reason -- the number one reason was clear, the Germans were very interested\nnot to start an epidemic in the ghetto. Because they -- in the center of the ghetto, they had their\noffices, the German had their offices, and they did not want to be exposed to a th -- epidemic. So\nwhat they did, you know, they had good sanitation department, and the street was smelling --\nstinking with chlor any time of day or night. They were pouring chlor, you know, o-on the street,\non the what do you call. So -- and on the toilets, the outside toilets, chlor, etcetera, and keeping\nthing clean. It was amazing.",
        "Q: But it stank.",
        "A: Oh, chlor is better than --",
        "Q: Chlor is -- yeah -- yeah, better than whatever else it would -- but that\u2019s quite amazing because\nthe circumstances in that area are --",

        "Q: Did you --",
        "A: You had to pick what you will take, and that was not much because it was a limited ti -- you\nknow, amount of things that you could take with yourself. And then you walked with -- I don\u2019t --\nsomehow I -- you know, in my mind 1s that we were schlepping it on what you ca -- call?",

        "Q: Nothing?",
        "A: No.",

        "A: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: We were given the address and --",
        "Q: And you went.",
        "A: -- we moved. It was empty.",
        "Q: So how many rooms did you have?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: How many rooms?",
        "A: How about one?",
        "Q: One.",
        "A: Isn\u2019t that enough for you? One.",
        "Q: One small room?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: For you --",
        "A: Four people. My grandmother and grandfather had another room on the same floor.",
        "Q: On the same floor?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And is there a bathroom on that floor? I knew you were going to look at me like that. There\u2019s\n-- there\u2019s nothing.",
        "A: Outhouse.",
        "Q: Outhouse.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Water? No, no water.",
        "A: No water. Pump downstairs.",
        "Q: But downstairs, so you pump the water to bring it -- so h-how do you get food? What -- what\ndo you do for food? Is there a sm -- anything to cook on?",
        "A: No, we --",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: -- got the ration cards, and so you had a prescribed amount of bread for a week per person.\nThen you had stamps to get -- to go to the grocery once, whatever, and get supplies for those\nstamps, which were minimal. And that\u2019s it. Vegetables would come to the ghetto every few\nweeks. In wintertime they were frozen. So you ate frozen vegetables, a-and that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: So there\u2019s very little hot meals that you\u2019re getting?",
        "A: Hot meals?",
        "Q: Hot meals?",
        "A: Well, you cook. You know, my mother was cooking, so she was -- you know, the women\nwere -- that were cooking, the housewives were very ingenious in providing some meals,\ncooking all things possible, like making sardines out of beet leaves. You didn\u2019t taste that, okay.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: But you roll this, the beet leave --",
        "Q: So it looks like a --",
        "A: So it looks like a sardine, you saut\u00e9 it a little bit and sprinkle some salt or -- and it\u2019s good.\nWhen you\u2019re very hungry, everything 1s good.",
        "Q: Everything is good.",
        "A: And we were very hun -- it was unbelievable hunger. I remember, you know, Mother was\nscolding me once because after a year or two I look in the mirror, and I said, \u201cMother, now I\nlook as I want to look.\u201d I was close to being a skeleton, you know? I said, \u201cMother, isn\u2019t that\nnice? I am so thin.\u201d And for awhile I really thought so.",
        "Q: You really thought so, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And she was aggravated with you?",
        "A: Oh yes. Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Did she get very thin?",
        "A: Yes. Everybody.",
        "Q: Everybody.",
        "A: People were dying on the street --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- from hunger.",
        "Q: When -- when you first move in, I understand that Rumkowski and the council began to take\nover certain things, sort of -- I don\u2019t know what you want to call it -- nationalizing it for the\nghetto and for his -- for his group. So there are schools --",
        "A: He established a monarchy.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Where he was the ruler, and he has a council to help him. He established a school of which he\nwas very proud, rightly so. Right? That was what he was doing. So consequently, I was in that\nschool for a year, and graduated from high school, from that school, right? So that was in his\nfavor. This school consisted of both the per -- teaching personnel and students, of remnants of\npeople that were in the ghetto. Remnants because a lot of people from each school were missing.\nEither they were killed off already, or they were able to run off to Russia, for instance. You\nknow, a good number of people survived living in Russia.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So there were sort of remnants of different student in different schools, so that was the new\nschool. And the same went for teachers. And the director of the school was a very acknowledged\nwoman, Mrs. Rhein, R-h-e-1-n, who was a director of one of the high schools, girl\u2019s high schools,\nprivate high schools in Lodz city. And she, you know, directed that school. So consequently, you\nknow, I graduated from high school. And it serves me -- served me right later. It was\nacknowledged by the university in Germany, this high school. Although he developed different,\nwhat we called, resorts. Resorts were really a industrial complex, not a resort like, you know,\nyou go to for a rest.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So they had th -- see, I have very mixed feelings about Rumkowski, okay? For once, I hate\nhim, for once I hate the whole Jewish kingdom that he built, which is no question about it. On\nthe other hand, he did something positive. What he did was to bargain with the Germans for life,\nthrough the -- through the whole period of ghetto\u2019s existence. So he told the German and they\nliked to hear that, that we will supply you with workers, and we will gi -- you first -- give you\nfirst class industries that you can use for yourself. For the price that you -- that I ca -- can keep\nthis place alive, I can have living people working for you here. And that\u2019s how it worked out. So\nat different resort, there was ro -- a resort, the industry of -- oh, I don\u2019t know. I -- where I was\nworking in Capol, the first one was we were ma -- a tailor industrial per -- complex, making --\nmaking uniforms and particularly coats for the German army. And that consi -- what we were\nworking at is -- it was called the Gummi Fabrik. You recall probably the coats that German\nsoldier -- they were stiff like a board, right? Broad shoulders, stiff and big things here. What we\nwere do -- the tailors were cutting them, you know, cutting out the part. We -- we were using a\nglue -- special glue to glue those parts together, you know, because they were double, sort of\ndouble.",
        "Q: So they weren\u2019t sewn, they were glued.",
        "A: They were glued, yes. So -- for stiffness, and for wearability and so on, we were doing that.\nAfter we graduated, and graduated with -- with big pomp and parade. Of course, it -- the par --\nthe pomp was for Rumkowsk1, that he did it. We were given -- we were given work, you know,\nthen we had to work. Otherwise we had no way of being in the ghetto. People that -- that worked\ncould be in the ghetto. Whoever didn\u2019t work was sent out to another camp, meaning Auschwitz,\nbut we didn't know about that then. So we were given work. So the first place that he send us\ngirls -- the girls, graduating girls, was to this factory of the Gummi coats, which was such a\nhorrendous place.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: It was run by man tailors of the lowest degree. And for them to get a group of intellectual\ngirls, God, how they treated us. Was terrible.",
        "Q: What\u2019d they do?",
        "A: Call us names, pinch us, I don\u2019t know what else he -- they did with some other girls, not with\nme, but the atmosphere was just full of perversion, laughter at us. It was horrible.",
        "Q: Hm. When do you -- when do you graduate? I\u2019m just trying to get a time frame here. You\nhadn\u2019t started high school when the war started.",
        "A: 1940 we gr -- I graduated.",
        "Q: In \u00b040?",
        "A: I think it was in \u00b040.",
        "Q: So the same year --",
        "A: It was the year after --",
        "Q: -- the same year as the ghetto starts?",
        "A: No, that\u2019s impossible. I don\u2019t remember the year. Probably couple years later.",
        "Q: So high -- is high school -- high school is not like American high school, it\u2019s not four years,\nit\u2019s less, right? Because you --",
        "A: It\u2019s 12 years, still the same.",
        "Q: Right, but the high school actually starts later, am I right? Or --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: High school is four years, high school.",
        "Q: It is four years?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But you go -- you actually graduated in less time in the ghetto, am I right? You didn\u2019t go for\nfour years?",
        "A: No, but I was in the junior high school, I\u2019ve -- I finished junior high school --",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So it was the last two years.",
        "A: -- and was to start -- yes, was to start high school --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- senior high school in the ghetto.",
        "Q: When you\u2019re going to get work after you graduate, do you know the person who 1s head of\nthe labor bureau, Bert Fuchs? Bert F-u-c-h. There\u2019s a Fuchs --",
        "A: In the ghetto?",
        "Q: Yeah. Jewish.",
        "A: It does not ring the bell.",
        "Q: Doesn\u2019t ring a bell.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He was the director of what?",
        "Q: The labor bureau.",
        "A: The labor bureau.",
        "Q: At a certain point there are two or three people, but at the beginning, he\u2019s the only one.",
        "A: Mm-hm. No, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember, okay. Cause I thought maybe you had crossed paths or something.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: So how did -- how long do you stay in that first job, a few months, few weeks?",
        "A: Probably months. I don\u2019t know exactly.",
        "Q: How is it for your parents? Is your father a -- are your father and mother working right away,\nor you -- only your father?",
        "A: My father was working. He became -- he got a job of being a -- ad -- administrator of a -- of a\npart of the ghetto, it\u2019s a couple streets. They were assigned different administrator to look after\nthe needs of the -- of the street, the needs of the building, etcetera. So he was doing that.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Mother was not working.",
        "Q: So would he be -- have been considered part of -- not the Jewish Council itself, but part of the\nadministration of the ghetto in some --",
        "A: Mm-hm, yeah.",
        "Q: -- in some way. Was -- did this mean you got more food?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. Meant nothing.",
        "A: Meant nothing. Meant nothing, that he was working, otherwise he would be sent out from the\nghetto.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And it meant that he got some -- the money was insignificant. But got some rations, you\nknow, maybe a little more of rations cards, though I don\u2019t think so, 1t meant nothing.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: He was just privilege by being able to work.",
        "Q: Right. Now, from my reading, I understand that in 1940 and \u201941, there were a lot of worker\ndemonstrations against Rumkowski and the -- and the Jewish Council, that the rations were\ninsufficient, the work wasn\u2019t sufficient, and that Rumkowski sent the Germans in, and got these\npeople depor --",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall that.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t recall that?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t see any demon --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: May -- maybe it was in another part of the ghetto.",
        "A: It might have been, but I was --",
        "Q: Uh-huh, but you didn\u2019t --",
        "A: -- it didn\u2019t come --",
        "Q: -- you weren't aware of that.",
        "A: -- close to me.",
        "Q: Right. So how did you get out of this first job? Did it just stop, or did you ask for another\nposition?",
        "A: .... am sort of wrestling with myself. I would like to share something with you, not about\nmyself, and not myself, but I would not like it to get in the record. Is that possible, or I shut up?",
        "Q: Well, we -- you can tell me at another time.",
        "A: Good. But anyway, he was organizing the police, okay, Jewish police.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, right.",
        "A: You heard about that.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And he also decided to have a troop of women police -- policewomen, okay? And he took the\n-- hi-his beloved high school graduates and sent them to the female police force, okay?",
        "Q: He really liked this group of girls, huh?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: He liked this group of --",
        "A: It was his pride --",
        "Q: Oh, his pride, uh-huh.",
        "A: -- he did something for the future.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know. And he was a social worker at heart, y -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a very mixed bag in that man.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So he -- a-and that what happened to me. Few of the girls from the -- from the -- this -- you\nknow, tailor resort, went into the police. And we as police women were given the task to be on\nthe street, and keep the street -- keep the street traffic in order. So we got uniforms, you know,\nand a office.",
        "Q: What kind of uniform?",
        "A: Green jackets with buttons.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And green pants, yes.",
        "Q: Hat?",
        "A: Hat. And then we were in the office. I and another girl were made to be officers, you know, in\ncharge of the troops, and above us was a elderly Czech Jew, who came from Prague. You know\none thing is that to the ghetto, Lodz ghetto, there were sent Jews from all over Europe to be there\nand dispose with them, you know, everyplace else. So there was -- was a wonderful group of\nCzech Jews that came to the ghetto, okay? Mostly young students graduate, and it was such a\nrefreshing -- I worked then at the housing department, so I met with them, you know, a lot,\nbecause they came for housing.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And they were so refreshing. I mean, innocent. They didn\u2019t know they are Jews, or nude. You\nknow, it was very -- a mixed culture, Jews and Gentiles. So one of the Prague guys was this\nelderly, handsome guy, you know, old -- pretty old, and he was in charge of [indecipherable] the\nwomen -- just -- 1t was comedy -- with another woman, a Czech woman, I think she was his\nassistant. So we\u2019re sitting in the office and telling stories from Czech -- P-Prague, etcetera,\netcetera. So that la-lasted for awhile, and that was disband, too. Okay, it was not such a innocent\ngroup in such a innocent job. Now, that I am talking freely because it\u2019s about myself, not about a\nfriend. So 1-1t -- other than keeping the traffic going -- not traffic, you know what traffic, there\nwere no Car --",
        "Q: It\u2019s walking traffic.",
        "A: -- walking traffic.",
        "Q: Yeah, yes.",
        "A: A-And there was other traffic. There was a lot of sewage people working, you know,\nsanitation, because the toilets had to be -- the outside toilets had to be cleaned regularly because\nof fear of epidemic, so that traffic was going. What else? And the -- the traffic to the cemetery,\nthat was a lot, you know, a lot of people were dying. You know, picked up from the street or\notherwise. Other than that, we were given a order there should not be any trade on the street.\nNow what kind of trade do you think there was? What there was is that people were making\ncandies out of the sugar rations. People were making candies with a taste, and wrapped them,\nand then they were selling it on the street. And their order was that that trade should not exist. So\nwe were supposed to watch for that, and if we -- when we catch a guy that is selling this candy,\nwe were supposed to bring them to the real police, the men police. So that\u2019s what we were doing,\nwe were supposed to do. Now, if the real police catch a guy like that, you know where he was\ngoing.",
        "Q: They\u2019d get deported.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So it was one -- one day, I and a friend of mine from the school, my previous school, she was\nper -- patrolling the street and she said -- I was a officer, you see, I was not patrolling. So she\nsays, \u201cPaula, you have to come with me. I want you to come with me and I want to show you\nwhat we are doing, our job.\u201d So, fine, you know, so we walked the street, and then we come to a\nguy that was selling candies, and she says, \u201cWell that what I have to do, and I will do you what --\nI am arresting him and bringing the -- to the police.\u201d Which she did, and we went to the police,\nand she depart. And she says, \u201cDo you know what will happen to the man?\u201d And she says, \u201cDo\nyou know what we are doing here?\u201d We spent all night walking and talking. And could not get a\npeace of mind. So I say, that\u2019s it, no more, I am leaving.",
        "Q: And did she do the same thing?",
        "A: The lucky thing was that the pol -- women police was disbanded in a week from that\noccurrence, so we didn\u2019t have to do anything. We were told, no more.",
        "Q: Was that because the two of you said you didn\u2019t want to do it, or --",
        "A: No, no, independently.",
        "Q: Independently.",
        "A: Rumkowski did away with it, for whatever reason I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: And for how long was this going on, a few months, a few week?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Not -- but not for very long.",
        "A: Not for very long, few months.",
        "Q: And were you -- the office that you were in, were the -- was the male police -- Jewish police\nthere also, or were you totally separate from the Jewish police?",
        "A: Separate.",
        "Q: You were separate?",
        "A: We were separate.",
        "Q: And was that your first confrontation with what that job was doing? When you went out with\nthis woman --",
        "A: Yes. That was.",
        "Q: -- you really didn\u2019t -- you didn\u2019t think about it, or know what he said to [indecipherable]",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Not so easy, huh?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: Not easy.",
        "A: Oh, horrible. But that what it was. The police was helping Rumkowski keeping order --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and keeping the deal with the Germans.",
        "Q: And did you have opinions then about the male Jewish police?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You want to tell me?",
        "A: The male Jewish police wasn -- no question about that they were fully cooperated with\nRumkowski and therefore with the Germans, and we had no good opinion about them.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Were you afraid of them?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: And they were very helpful at the time of getting Jews into the transport going to Auschwitz.\nI tell you, it was horrible, the thought that Jewish police is helping Germans. It was horrible. I\nchanged my mind a bit watching Lanzmann\u2019s movie. You know, when he interviews the\nSonderkommando in Auschwitz, and you saw people that were really on the other side, in\nAuschwitz, helping Germans to kill Jews, frankly to kill Jews.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And I got away with a different feeling. How can you blame people that were forced to do the\njob, knowing they are going to be killed in four months, how can you blame them?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It was very powerful.",
        "Q: On the other hand -- let me give you the other hand here.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: You couldn\u2019t do it. You couldn't do something that was in a way simpler, but was part of a\nprocess.",
        "A: No, I couldn\u2019t do it.",
        "Q: And it was something that you couldn\u2019t do.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: And I\u2019m sure other people couldn\u2019t either.",
        "Q: Right. So some could, and maybe they could live with themselves and maybe they couldn\u2019t,\nbut they did it anyway.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That -- you\u2019re right. And in Auschwitz, you know, the Sonderkommando that\ndid work, you know, the gas chambers and the crematoria, some were just picked and forced to\ndo it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: They had no way out other than go --",
        "Q: And be killed. Right.",
        "A: -- right away.",
        "Q: Right. You ever think what would have happened if everybody said no?",
        "A: There would be a revolution, and maybe successful.",
        "Q: It\u2019s hard to do that though, isn\u2019t it?",
        "A: That\u2019s why the big problem was, you know, is -- Hannah -- what was her name, Hannah --",
        "Q: Hannah Arendt.",
        "A: Arendt, accusing Jews in Poland that they went like sheep to the gas chambers.",
        "Q: Actually, she didn\u2019t.",
        "A: No?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Who did? Where did that come from?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know. Sometimes the resistance said that.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: Sometimes the resistance, the partisans --",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: -- said don\u2019t go like sheep.",
        "A: Oh, I see, yes.",
        "Q: She never s --",
        "A: But she didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: She didn\u2019t say it.",
        "A: I see, okay, so --",
        "Q: But it\u2019s a --",
        "A: Excuse me.",
        "Q: No, but it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s an accusation that people think she said things like that --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- she didn\u2019t. She -- she was not happy with the councils, but she never blamed the rest of the\nJews. She thought that the councils shouldn\u2019t have cooperated. That, yes, but she never said that\nother.",
        "A: And this gave me also another thought, you know, when I was in August in L\u00e9dz --",
        "Q: Oop, w-we have to stop? Okay, we\u2019ll stop. Sorry.",
        "A: Finish later.",
        "Q: Yes, we\u2019ll finish it later.\nEnd of Tape Four\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "Q: Okay. We forgot something. When you were talking about being in high school, weren\u2019t you\nat some point in something called a farm settlement that we didn\u2019t talk about? What was that?\nWas that while you were in high school? Was that part of the high school?",
        "A: That was part of Rumkowsk1\u2019s plan. As you know, he was a social worker and director of an\norphanage before the war. He also was a great Zionist. And at the -- at the time when the school\nopened, he gave us a proposition that whoever would volunteer can go to this place that was part\nof the ghetto, but 1t was sort of more rural, and it was a old house that used to be a orphanage.\nNot his orphanage, but the Polish population. And that we would, boys and girls go there and\nlearn farming in preparation for the -- to go into Palestine and become kibbutznik farmers. So,\nyou know, we needed to have the permission of our parents, and then a group of us went there.\nAnd we spent a full year there. And it was a wonderful time, a time that permit us who were\nwilling to be there, to forget where we were. It was out of this world, really. It was a huge house,\na orphanage, you know, so there was big halls. And our group was probably not more than 20\nboys and girls. Boys separate, girls separate bedrooms, etcetera. And in the morning we would\ngo to school. We would go by -- by carriages, you know, we had some people that were bringing\nu -- by horse and buggy, big buggy, to school, and then afternoon we would come to the farm.\nWe call it Hak\u2019shara, which is Hebrew for farm. And it has the Zionist implication, but we\ncouldn\u2019t give a damn about -- at that time about the implication of Palestine, 1t was just a lovely\nplace. It was a farm that used to be used -- you know, it was used by Poles as a farm, and also\nhad animals. It had goats, and chickens, etcetera. And there was one guy, he was a German Jew\nwho was a farmer, and knew about, you know, farming, and other than going to school,\nhomework, etcetera, he would teach us what to do. In other word, we would sow seeds, and all\nkinds of thing, and take care of the growing crop. There was a orchard, and there were the\nanimals. The animals we would -- let\u2019s see, there were some cows, and there were some goats,\nand we would learn how to milk them. And then distru -- distribute the milk by buggies, and --\nhorse and buggies to cooperative, to stores, you know, run by the -- by Rumkowski that will be\nselling it to the population on carts and so on. So it was a ideal love -- life, really. Very\ngratifying. Of course, we paired up, boys and girls, and so were some romances going and that\nwas, under the circumstances, unheard of. We -- of course, were properly chaperoned by mothers\nthat would take turn and come for overnight to be with -- with the -- you know, with us, to make\nsure nothing was happening. So that was the --",
        "Q: Did they really stop things from happening?",
        "A: I think, in a way, yes. So that was the time, and it was a lot of camaraderie, and there\u2019s sa --\nwere some evening that we had music, some of the people play [indecipherable] particularly\nplayed the piano, and there was a piano. So we had music, and we were dancing. You know, so\nwe were cooking [indecipherable] for the crew, you know. So we would take turns for 24 hours\nto prepare meals, a boy and a girl, cou -- you know, prepare breakfast, lunch, dinner, and\netcetera. So it was a unbelievable year.",
        "Q: So you were staying there as opposed to being with your parents and your sister.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Right. Did you have a boyfriend?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Was this a boyfriend from before, or somebody that you met in this group?",
        "A: Somebody who I met in this group.",
        "Q: In group?",
        "A: Yes, mm-hm.",
        "Q: And how many boys and girls were there, do you think?",
        "A: Altogether close to 20. 18 - 20.",
        "Q: Did you mother ever -- was she ever --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: -- chaperone?",
        "A: Yes, yes, she agreed to.",
        "Q: They never took the fathers for a chaperone, only the mothers.",
        "A: Yes, cause [indecipherable] why, why, why -- I don\u2019t know why.",
        "Q: And was this er -- wi -- like in 42 -- 1942, do you think? Do you have any recollection what\nyear? I mean, I know it\u2019s hard to figure out what years these things are.",
        "A: \u00b042 - \u00b043. Something like that.",
        "Q: I was just trying to figure it out in relationship to the work that you were doing.",
        "A: It was before.",
        "Q: It was before --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- right, because you were still in high school.",
        "A: That\u2019s right [indecipherable] said before high school. And then, when we graduate from high\nschool, what happened? O-Of course, the farm disbanded, why did it disband? Times got tougher\npolitically. I think Rumkowski did not have any more ji -- way of thinking and doing to\nsupervise or insist, or we simply -- that what happened, it was disband and we were given jobs.",
        "Q: So you --",
        "A: We were needed to work. We had to stop and we are needed to -- to work for the Germans.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know we --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- we -- we were needed to pay off.",
        "Q: So this is that same class, that last graduating class in the high school that you talked about\nbefore, yes?",
        "A: Right, yes. There was another class after us, so two classes graduated.",
        "Q: But they didn\u2019t have this opportunity.",
        "A: They\u2019re -- the --",
        "Q: The farm.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t come to the farm.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember why, or the times already toughened and, you know, there was no -- no time\nfor frivolities, so to speak.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So we were the only group that did it, that had this privilege, really. Oh f --",
        "Q: And did you --",
        "A: -- yes?",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry. Did you then go back to live with your parents and sister?",
        "A: Actually, I never went back to live with my parent again. I was emancipated. Oh, there was\nanother job immediately after, that was -- so many jobs in such a short time, so it --",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay.",
        "A: -- sort of get mixed up. Hm?",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay if it gets mixed up.",
        "A: Yes. One job was making, you know, in -- in a production of houses, what you call houses\nthat you build part -- parts for it.",
        "Q: Prefabricated?",
        "A: Prefabr -- prefabricated homes for export to Germany, okay? So some of us went to work on\nthat, and we got housing there, also outside, you know, the main part of the ghetto. And we -- we\nwere living there totally, and working. So that was -- lasted for awhile, and that was finished.\nNow, we were doing the -- the prevat -- prefabricated parts with cement, mixing cement, pouring\nit into forms, taking out -- you know, we learned the whole production of how do you do -- how\nyou do it. And that ended. But another job that I had was working in a kitchen, and that was the\nbest job. An-And really ended badly. There was a occasion to go to work for a kitchen that was\nestablished -- kitchen restaurant, so to speak, establish by Rumkowski that was producing\ndinners one -- once a day dinners for people that work in different kind of industries and were\ngiven a bonus to come to this -- to this kitchen for a dinner, for a week or two weeks or so. It was\na extra sort of a pay-off for good work and so on. And working in that kitchen, of course it was\nwonderful, because you could eat, okay? You didn\u2019t have to be hungry, right? So -- and it was\nnice, there was a nice by -- bunch of girls, familiar also from the school, and it was nice to work\nthere. We made hamburgers, we do this, we chopped up all kind that was needed 1n the kitchen,\nunder the supervise -- supervision of women cooks. And then what happened was that there was\na Sonderkommando older guy, you know, that I and he knew each other, I don\u2019t remember from\nwhere, but there were no hard feelings bet -- between us, there was some hostility. I don\u2019t know\nwhat -- what was the cause, but at any rate, he was on duty one day, and I went -- supposedly I\nwas asking the cook that was serving the soup -- I was serving -- you know, the guy that -- the\nCzech that was supervising the women police, and he was there e -- as a client, and I suppose\nthat he asked the server to give me a little more in the plate of soup, because I wanted to, you\nknow. And this Kohn, Kohn was his name, caught me doing that, and therefore did saw that I\nwas kicked out from the kitchen, from my good job. Himself was a -- a s-son of a gun, you\nknow, terrible guy to get to be accused of anything. And -- an-and -- and that was it, so that job\nended, and I was sent, as a punishment, I was sent to a -- to a resort, a -- a factory that was\nmaking stuff out of wood. That means they were making wooden chairs, wooden wagons, you\nknow, wheels, wooden wheels. It was a huge factory, under one roof, you know, just huge, full\nof machineries that produced a lot of dust when you worked them. So that was my punishment. I\nwas sent to Siberia, and I was there for about a year or so. It was a tough year, really. Hard work,\na lot of dust, and I was punished, you know, that was punishment. So what can I say.",
        "Q: And you were agai -- still living away from your parents. You -- you had found your own\nplace?",
        "A: No. At this time I think I went back --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- home, cause there was no place to -- to be. So -- but I found a very nice friend there,\nworking around the young people and we chummed together. And so from the social point of\nview, it was nice.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Except that it was a dirty job.",
        "Q: Right. Now, is this after you were in the women\u2019s police force? Do you --",
        "A: I think it was before, probably.",
        "Q: You think it was before?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Mm-hm. So -- a-and you know, my encounter with this Sonderpoliceman was as we were the\nlast day in the ghetto, as we were transported to Auschwitz, you know, before -- before being\n[indecipherable] to the -- you know, to the wagons, y-you know, that take us. And there was I\nand this policeman, and I looked at him and I didn\u2019t say a word, just thinking, you scoundrel.\nHere you are and here I am.",
        "Q: Right. Here you go.",
        "A: Common ending --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- of the story. So that was part of my life.",
        "Q: What\u2019s happening to you as a young woman? You\u2019re 20 -- in 1942, two years after the -- the\nghetto was formed, you\u2019re 20 -- 20 years old.",
        "A: Yes, 19 - 20, yes.",
        "Q: 19 - 20 years old.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: What kind of a person are you becoming? Are you -- you clearly -- as you tell the story, you\nclearly have moments when things are not so terrible. You\u2019re meeting friends, you have friends,\nthere\u2019s something -- thing -- there are things that make you happy. But clearly, there\u2019s an\nunderlying something that must be very wearing on you. Are you depressed, are you --",
        "A: I think the motto for that being then is we shall overcome.",
        "Q: You really felt that.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. And in the family too, you know. We didn\u2019t know the song we shall -- you know, that --",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: -- that black people brought and led the -- the Civil Rights Movement.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But that was what kept us going. We shall overcome. And the motto was life, keep on living.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t give up?",
        "A: Oh, no.",
        "Q: In spite of everything that you knew.",
        "A: Right. And neither would my mother or father, or within the close-knit family.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t give up either.",
        "A: No. We shall overcome. And, you know, listening to the ri -- radio --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- and of course we had to give up when the German came, first among their rules was all\nradios you bring to this place in Lodz, and sewing machines and all machinery, guns of course,\nyou know, etcet -- etcetera. So if you were caught listening to -- to the radio, you could be\ndeported.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But I want -- I wanted to say you can get killed, but deported was --",
        "Q: The same.",
        "A: -- equals death.",
        "Q: The same thing, yeah.",
        "A: So -- so no radio, no listening to the radio. So we didn\u2019t know, but somehow some rumors\nwere crossing, some people were listening to the radio. You know, they dared and they were\nlistening to it. And I think my father had some connection with somebody that got the news. So\nwe knew broadly what was happening, and we knew where the Germans were, you know, the\ntrip to Siberia, and Stalingrad. And also what we knew that at that time he had all Europe under\nhis hand, right? And -- and fighting England and bombing London, and so on. So we knew what\nwas th -- and some of the news were brought by people that were deported from Paris and\nVienna, and yi -- all your Holland, Dutch people, Czech -- Czech people, they were bringing\nnews because they still knew what was going on, closer than we did. So we knew that he has by\nnow all Europe under -- under his foot, and that there\u2019s little hope really, of very -- very m --\nvery changes that could happen in immediate future. So you just had to take a -- a long view to\nthe future, we shall overcome, in spite of everything that is happening. So you have to be strong.\nAnd one thing that became very important in every day life was how you live with almost\nnothing. That the ration that you got from the bakery, that piece of bread that you got per person,\nand you are in charge of it, it has to last you all week. Don\u2019t eat it in one setting. Because people\nthat did, died. People that didn\u2019t lost weight, and died too, some that could not go on and got\nsome infection and so on. So how do you do that? Families that could do that, and my mother\nwas the leader of it, we did it under her supervision. We stemmed the hunger and take very --\ntook very little, could survive and hope for later. Many people could not, and died just because\nthey could not do it.",
        "Q: Did you smoke?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did a lot of people smoke then?",
        "A: I take it back.",
        "Q: You take it back, you did smoke?",
        "A: My first experiment with smoking was when I was in the police fers -- force, and this guy, the\nCzech guy and his assistant were smoking, and I say, hey, let me try it. So I tried, and I got sick.\nDizzy, and so on, and I gave it up. But I smoked later, for a few years, you know, after the war.",
        "Q: After the war.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: The reason I ask is because many people smoked because it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know if it stops\nhunger, but you don\u2019t seem to be -- necessarily eat as much if you\u2019re smoking. So I thought\npossibly that was --",
        "A: I didn\u2019t get to that stage.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t get to that stage. So you -- you and your family were very disciplined about the\nrationing of food.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "Q: Your sister is much younger, was it more difficult for her because she was so much younger?\nOr was she old enough to understand by --",
        "A: I -- she was old enough --",
        "Q: -- she must have been, she was a teenager.",
        "A: -- and she was a smart little gi-girl.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Right. Let me ask you something about Rumkowsk1i. I interviewed someone, Lucille\nEichengreen, who both -- she wrote about and -- a-about her own experiences, and experiences\nof other people with Rumkowski.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: That he was abusing young women, sometimes boys. It happened in the orphanage, according\nto her, and it -- then it happened in [indecipherable]",
        "A: You mean before the war?",
        "Q: Before the war.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Pedophile.",
        "Q: And in the ghetto, as well. And I wondered if you heard anything or knew anything about\nRumkowski and what he did. Because we don\u2019t -- we can\u2019t -- she\u2019s the only person who has been\nwilling to talk about it, and she only talked about it once everybody she knew was dead, so she\nwouldn\u2019t hurt --",
        "A: Mm-hm. I see. I knew that -- but not directly -- and I never had any interview with him,\nthough people would go asking for special things, and would have a need to talk with him. I\nnever had the need, I never met him personally. But I heard that he wa -- you know, that if you\nwant a audience with him, you have to be prepared that he will sexually assault you. So I heard --\nthat was floating rumors all over, and to be believed. Now, I know about his life something else.\nHe got married in -- in the ghetto, you know, and his wife lived in the house -- same house that\nwe lived. And he was -- she was a lawyer, so-called a old maid, you know? I don\u2019t know if she\nwas 30 or 31 or 29, but she was all -- already old. You know, according. And he married her, so I\nsaw him come, you know, to the house, walking into the house and that -- few times, and that\u2019s\nit. Then when they were married, I suppose she lived with him not -- not in that house where I\nlived. So why he got married, I don\u2019t know, but who\u2019s to say?",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So, I think -- a-as you know, he was the last transport, both of them went to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And did not survive.",
        "Q: Right. Of course, there are different rumors about that, he was killed by people who had been\nin Lodz, or he was gassed, who knows?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Nobod -- nobody is sure.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- anything beyond that.",
        "Q: Do you remember the speech he gave in September of 1942, give me your children, were you\nthere? What was that like?",
        "A: The worst day in the world. He gathered a lot of people, cause 1t was known that he will give\nthe speech, so people came. And we knew that it cannot be any good news, so you know, that\nwas in the air. And he gave a speech. He was a good speaker, you know, telling how much he\ncares, telling how much work he puts in -- into survival, and do the best for the population, and\nwe should believe him and trust him. And in that vein, he wants to tell us that it 1s up to us to\nprevent any big loss of population, the Germans gave him a number of children between the ages\n-- I don\u2019t remember, young children, but not too young, you know, the -- they -- the Germans\nwill bring those children to a special care -- camp, that they will get a very good care, better than\nin the ghetto, that he can assure us will happen, and that will allow the ghetto to survive til war is\nended. So please, mothers, go home, prepare the children. Give them, you know, prepare\nsomething, clothing, some dishes to eat from. And it was not the dep -- you know, the collection,\nsuch and such day. That was it. And there was, of course, a lot of crying and screaming, and the\npeople dispersed. It was paralyzing, you know, paralyzing fear and anger. But what bothers --\nbothered me worst, as we ma -- were making our way home, I don\u2019t know if wha -- my mother\ncame or not, I know I was, and I was by myself, so I don\u2019t remember. What bothered me most 1s\nI was walking back home and some neighbors wi -- with me were walking too, how quickly\nthose women adjusted to that idea. I -- I couldn't understand that. Mainly -- mainly accepting his\npremise, believing him, and saying we need to do what he say, and maybe that way we\u2019 ll save\nour children. So they were eager to go home and prepare their children for that. I almost died\nthen.",
        "Q: Because you didn\u2019t believe it.",
        "A: Not a word.",
        "Q: Did you say anything to these women that you heard, or you just kept quiet and walked?",
        "A: No, but I went home, we talked and non -- nobody home believed that either. Many people\ndid not believe that.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But I was surprised how many people did believe.",
        "Q: Right. Yeah.",
        "A: So immediately.",
        "Q: Maybe they always believed him. We need to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape Five\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "Q: Paula, do you think what -- what do you think Rumkowski thought he was telling people? Did\nhe believe that these kids would be okay? Did he not know?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think he was so dumb. I he -- I think really that he was calculating. In his work with\n[indecipherable] the other German, he was simply calculating how to save most of Jews, how to\nhelp as many as possible Jews to survive. And that\u2019s how he was making the deals.",
        "Q: So as long as he could save some, it wouldn\u2019t matter?",
        "A: Yeah. Against liquidating the whole ghetto. That could have happened.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, the Germans just could come and erase the ghetto, you know, any time, either by\nbomb or sending out people. They had the power.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It -- so he was calculating how to make the best deal against that possibility. I think he was\nsincere about it.",
        "Q: About doing that?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes. Have you heard that speech again?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Have you ever read his speech again?",
        "A: No, no. Is there -- is there --",
        "Q: Yeah, I have it.",
        "A: On what, on paper?",
        "Q: Now I have it on paper, but I believe it\u2019s on tape. Some -- somehow you can hear his words.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Mm, I would be interested in hearing it.",
        "Q: Let me -- let me just read you the last part of it for a second.",
        "A: Yes, okay.",
        "Q: \u201cA broken Jew stands before you,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not envy me. This is the most difficult of all\nthe orders I\u2019ve ever had to carry out at any time. I reach out to you with my broken, trembling\nhands and I beg, give in to my hands the victims, so that we can avoid having further victims.\nAnd a population of a hundred thousand Jews can be preserved. So they promise me. If we\ndeliver our victims by ourselves, there will be peace.\u201d It\u2019s quite a speech. But he clearly was\ntrying to also talk about how difficult this was for him.",
        "A: Oh yes. I believe that.",
        "Q: Yeah. And you do believe it.",
        "A: I -- yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: He was a politician, and traded in human life.",

        "A: That\u2019s what I think. And the death of the president in Warsaw ghetto didn\u2019t produce anything\nbut a loss of one human life.",
        "Q: Czerniakow.",
        "A: Czerniakow.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. That doesn\u2019t say that I would not, given m-myself and that choice, I probably would kill\nmyself rather than stand like Rumkowski, saying that. But in judging, what is more pr -- I want\nto say productive -- of what is more -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t find a word for it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I -- I -- I cannot hate Rumkowski for it. You know I have some respect for him for that. And\nfor his pain, as he was saying.",
        "Q: Right, right. D-Do you have any recollection of when you -- I know that you thought that the\nGermans were going to kill Jews.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: But the -- but they don\u2019t start murdering until 1941. There\u2019s some murders, but there\u2019s no --\nthe Einsatzgruppen come with the attack on Russia in 1941, and the -- the killing centers start in\n41 and \u00b042, and the major killings are f -- 1942. When is it that you realize that what you think\nis going to happen 1s really happening? Do you know? Is it in the middle of the ghetto, is 1t when\n-- y-you have a friend who comes with her daughter to the Lodz ghetto -- I mean, she becomes a\nfriend of yours. Now, this may be towards the end, I don\u2019t know if this is 1942 or it\u2019s later, 1944,\nand she won\u2019t give up her daughter.",
        "A: Oh -- oh, you -- oh, the story that I told.",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Is -- is she the one who convinced you that what you thought was happening was really\nhappening, or did you think that before?",
        "A: Ire -- since 1939 and before, listening to Hitler did not think that he is talking kwotch.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And that the \u201cMein Kampf\u201d book is just a book of a sick mind. We took him very seriously,\nand I know we were listening to the radio for hours. The -- his speeches were transmitted live as\nit was happening in Berlin or wherever, so we had a chance to listen to the radio, and sort of\njudging the speeches, and my father, my mother, myself, we knew he is speaking the truth, and\nthat we have nothing to hope for if he 1s a-allowed to bring his plan forth. That is France,\nEngland -- we didn't talk about America, that was sort of, you know, outside of Europe. Unless\nthey come and stop him, he will bring it to fruition, kill us. How, what, when, that was unknown,\nbut we -- this projection we had way back.",
        "Q: So I guess when -- maybe you can repeat the story that you told about this friend, during the\nde -- it -- it -- that you told in the shi -- in the -- in the film, \u201cShoah.\u201d Not in the film, in the -- in\nthe interview that you did --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- it wasn\u2019t in the film, because it appeared as if it had a-an enormous impact.",
        "A: It was not in the film?",
        "Q: What? No.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t put it in the film?",
        "Q: Mm-mm.",
        "A: Hm.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Okay, yes --",
        "Q: No, your portion --",
        "A: -- yes.",
        "Q: -- in the film was --",
        "A: I know. That -- that\u2019s right, I forget.",
        "Q: -- it -- it was -- it was much smaller.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: But this is a story about this woman who comes in, she must be in her 20\u2019s, maybe not so\nmuch older than you --",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right --",
        "Q: -- with the daughter.",
        "A: -- yes, in 20\u2019s. And I know that I work then -- then I worked in the housing department, and\nshe came from the line, you know, she is from a little town, she named the town, you know,\nclose to Lodz. And she says 1s -- she is with the daughter so she needs housing for herself and the\ndaughter. Her husband was the Alteste of the -- of the -- the small Jewish community. He was\ntaken away and killed with others, and she is here. And in my heart was going out to her, she was\n-- so [ -- there was a room in my -- in the house that I was living, so I told her to go there and see,\nand if it is okay, she can move in. And then I started to contact with her and we -- we became\ngood friends and talked, you know, a lot. And she was telling me about the life there, and th --\nand you know that in the end, 1-1t w-was just killed off then -- you know, and she is sent here,\netcetera. So, it was nice to have -- she was a very warm, smart woman, and a cute kid, nine years\nold, a little girl. And then it came, you know, the speech of Rumkowsk1, and she said never. You\nknow, I will never give up my child. So we still had few days to talk about it, so we talked at\nlength, and I said, \u201cMy God, what are you going to do?\u201d So she said, \u201cNever will I give up\nvoluntarily my daughter.\u201d And I agreed with her, you know, I -- I was not quarreling. And then\nthe day came of our street being run, you know, with SS troops, and coming, and they ask all\npopulation of a given building to go in the backyard and line up. And two, three SS guys with,\nyou know, bayonets came into the yard. I was standing close to my fre -- I forget her name --\nclose to my friend. And they said -- announced, all children of this and this age, please come.\nAnd she was holding the girl\u2019s hand tightly. And, you know, she was not budging. Other kids\ncame forth. And then the SS guy comes to her and says, bring -- takes the girl\u2019s hand and wants\nto pull her away, and she said no. And he said in German, \u201cIf you don\u2019t let go, I will shoot you.\u201d\nAnd she says, \u201cOkay, shoot me.\u201d So he takes her by the neck, turns her around, and puts the\nrevolver to her neck and shoots. And she falls to my feet, on my feet. And I hardly could stand.\nAnd he took the girl.",
        "Q: Anyway. Right.",
        "A: You see?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Rumkowsk1\u2019s philosophy a-and the reality, and how can you say anything, just don\u2019t ask me\nany questions about it, cause there are no answers. For three days I could not talk and could not\neat, and my mother started to worry about me. And then there was no choice but to live.",
        "Q: I\u2019m not sure exactly what I ha -- I have thoughts in my -- my head, I\u2019m not quite sure what to\nask you about this because I -- on the one hand I thought to myself, she -- she had to know they\nwould take her daughter no match you -- no matter what she did, and worse comes to worse they\nwould shoot her and then the daughter would die, too.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And so I\u2019m just wondering, what was -- what -- what must have been going through -- and\nyou don\u2019t know what was going through her head, because she had to know if they were going to\nshoot her, they were going to take the daughter.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And I guess one would just say it was an impossible situation whichever way she did it, she\nwas going to die.",
        "A: But she was not going to agree.",
        "Q: Agree to it, period.",
        "A: Give her life first before agreeing. I can understand that. Over my dead body, it says.",
        "Q: Right, right. Ri-Right.",
        "A: Literally.",
        "Q: Yes. And the daughter was -- you think was gassed?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Unless by some fluke she could escape or something.",
        "Q: Right, right. Was this the first time you saw a dead person?",
        "A: Oh no, you could see many dead people on the streets of the ghetto.",
        "Q: But this was somebody you knew, and pretty well.",
        "A: Yeah -- ye -- my grandmother died in the ghetto. My -- my uncle died in the ghetto.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So I went to the funerals of my family.",
        "Q: And so they\u2019re buried in Lodz.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And after three days you said, I have to go on.",
        "A: Yes, somehow I revived.",
        "Q: So this was 1942, this was in the middle --",
        "A: Mm-hm",
        "Q: -- of the ghetto. But deportation meant death to you, that was clear.",
        "A: It was not clear, but it was clear.",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t known, but it was --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- the intent was clear.",
        "A: How did we -- there were people that came to the ghetto, some people that lived in the ghetto\nin Lodz, and were deported, and somehow run away and came, you know, sort of on the black --\nblack side --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- to the ghetto, and they brought news. One first news was about Chelmno. You -- y-you --\nyou know the name.",
        "Q: Yes, I was going to ask you, yes.",
        "A: That was -- that was a small time -- town, not far from the city, and that is where the first\nexperiment with gas were done in buses. So those guys that escaped, escaped that, but they were\nwitness to what\u2019s going on, and escape. So we knew about the gassing, etcetera. Then there were\nother news, also from peop -- you know, we got a lot of mail from people that were deported,\nthat they are in camp like that, and everything is fi -- you know, that was all hoax. But some\npeople came, and they brought news from Auschwitz, and that we could not believe, that there\nwere factories to gas people and burn their bodies, crematoria. We could not believe, but they\nwere circulate -- those news were circulating.",
        "Q: But Chelmno you believed?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: People believed what was going on in -- in Chelmno --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- but not Auschwitz?",
        "A: That\u2019s right. I -- are -- or -- impossible. And it -- but those were people they were talking\nabout, so it was sort of, we don\u2019t want to believe that, but --",
        "Q: Right, right, right.",
        "A: -- hey, you have to pay attention.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So there were news like that of what\u2019s happening in the world.",
        "Q: Was there a lot of corruption in Lodz, you think? That\u2019s a -- that\u2019s a lot, huh?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: It\u2019s inevitable though, isn\u2019t it, under those circumstances, since there\u2019s no -- was there a black\nmarket? Even though it was so isolated, there was a black market?",
        "A: I think so.",
        "Q: So when I say was there corruption and you look the way you did, what 1s it -- what -- what is\nit that\u2019s going through your head?",
        "A: Through my s -- head 1s I ca -- I -- I cannot tell her anything concrete that I know, any facts\n[indecipherable] he told me so, but I know there was.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Part of the cor -- not corruption but sort of tangentially, wer -- my experience was following.\nMy father was working, I was working, my sister was 1n school for a couple of years and then\nshe got some job to work. My mother was not working. And we began to worry about it because\nshe could be the next deported person. So the question was how do we get -- we need to get her a\njob. Who will get her a job? My father could not hit right. And then was the -- also the peculiar\nsituation in ghetto of reversed roles. You know, the people -- kids like myself that were coming\nof age in the ghetto, but they were children in school, but by the time it was going on, they were\n17 - 18. There was the support of the -- of the ghetto. That on them leaned the economy of life in\nthe ghetto. Those were the people with strength, that could work and buy time for Rumkowski\nfrom the Germans. So all of the sudden I became very important in the group -- in the populati --\nin the, you know, population. And influential. So my father said, \u201cWell you have to do\nsomething.\u201d But what can I do? We have to do something. At this time I was working 1n this\nhousing department which had couple bosses, one older man, and his assistant -- I forget their\nnames, Wolf -- one was Wolfe, the young one was Wolfe, and the older I don\u2019t remember. And\nthe -- you know, older guy and his assistant was the younger guy, and they -- you know, we had\nvery good relationship, they respected me, I respected them, 1-it was nice. So I said, I have to go\nto both of them and ask if they can find a job for Mother. It was a dangerous step, because you\nhad to pay. And what does a young girl pay? How does a young girl pay? Sex, right? So that was\nwritten in big letters. Am I willing to pay that for my mother getting a job? I had to count on that,\nwhen I go to one or the other. That\u2019s how Rumkowski comes in that category, too. When people\ncame, women, particularly young women came to him with begging for some favor, like for a\nsick person to get some medicine, or what n -- extraordinary thing, they had to pay. So I said,\nwhat do I do? And I cannot talk to Father about that. So I said, well, God help me, and I go to\nboth of them. But to one, the older one, he was a chief, and tell him such and such, and I need a\njob for Mother, to keep her alive. What can I tell you my surprise that he didn\u2019t ask for a prize,\nand he got Mother a job in a kitchen in some resort, you know, in some factory. And Mother\nstarted to work. I was surprised, but pleasantly, you know?",
        "Q: Absolutely.",
        "A: So that was a one thing. The other thing was Mother worked in that factory, the director was\nMrs. Sandberg, who was the father of my classmate in grade school, and we knew each other -- I\nforgot her name, first name, but not closely, but she -- she was a nice kid and I think she thought\nme, too. I knew her parents from all kinds of affairs for kids. Her father had a horrible opinion,\nyou know, as a explorator, as a bad guy, as nobody to talk to, y -- just -- that was the opinion of\nMrs. -- about Mr. Sandberg. Her mother was a nice lady. Mother was very happy working there.\nI told you my mother s -- wished to work --",
        "Q: Yes. She finally --",
        "A: -- and she could not. She got a job. And was she happy. She really was happy. She was going\nin the morning, she worked in the kitchen, peeling potatoes, all kinds of stuff, but being among a\nbunch of women -- my mother was an excellent talker, you know, and communi -- you know,\nsort of with people, she was a -- enjoyed it and was liked, and she would come back with stories.\nAnd I said, \u201cMother, I never saw you so happy.\u201d And also, in the kitchen, we -- they were\nallowed some stealing. They could take some -- first of all, they were allowed to do is to bring\nhome potato peels. Something that you throw out.",
        "Q: Throw away, yes.",
        "A: Potato peels.",
        "Q: It\u2019s good for you, right?",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That was delicious food. Mother would cook a kugel from potato peels.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes, and all kind of things. So it was food for the family. And she smuggled few potatoes\nwith it, so we had few potatoes. So she was double happy for herself and that she could bring\nsomething home from the job. Make me very happy, you know, it was just nice to see that\nwoman, under those conditions really thriving. Then one day comes the order through Mr.\nSandberg, as it was coming to all directors of the factories, to supply by that date, that many\nworkers of his to send out to -- for relocation. It was called relocation, to another ghetto. Right?\nSo Mother is in danger, and in serious danger. And what do I do? Mother says, go and talk to Mr.\nSandberg.",
        "Q: This time Mother says it, uh-huh.",
        "A: I may be sent out. Oh. I was beside myself. I didn\u2019t want to go. He\u2019s a mean -- I say, \u201cMother,\nhe is a mean man, I may make it worse.\u201d And she says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, just go and talk to him.\u201d I\nwalked the streets around my house half of the night, what do I do, what do I do? So I did -- first\nof all I went to talk to Mrs. Sandberg, the wife. And she knew me, you know, I was a classmate\nof her daughter, and I said, look, such and such, I don\u2019t know what to ask you for, but please\nunderstand where we are. She didn\u2019t say anything, yes, no, whatever, nothing. And then I made\nan appointment to see Mr. Sandberg, and I did see him, and he was nice enough. Not nice really,\nbut polite enough. And I begged him for my mother\u2019s life. Well, he didn\u2019t put her on the list. But\nyou asked me what were the fi -- feeling, living like that. You see this horror of those feelings?\nAnd horror of ever -- of being forced, not by my parents, by what\u2019s going on, to do something\nthat you may think that you contribute to your mother\u2019s death one way or another. Could have\nhappened very easily.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: He could have said, I have no choice. What would you do in my place?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Things like that. But that worked out that way. How does it leave you internally? Certainly\nnot with a feeling of power. A feeling of rage, of anger, that you cannot get riv -- rid of through\nyour lifetime.",
        "Q: Do you also think of the other side, your mother saved, but somebody else goes?\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: That\u2019s true, but I didn\u2019t think that far.",
        "Q: Not then, no.",
        "A: Mm-mm. But of course somebody -- you know, there was --",
        "Q: Yes, somebody\u2019s got to go.",
        "A: -- yes. He had to -- he had to produce the number of people --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- the Germans wanted. Rumkowski and the Germans wanted.",
        "Q: But to go beg for someone\u2019s life is not -- it\u2019s not what one wants to do in life.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: We have to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape Six\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "Q: This -- the -- the tales you were just telling about going and trying to get work for your\nmother came after I talked about corruption in the ghetto.",
        "A: Yes, mm-hm.",
        "Q: And clearly you think that these examples show in what sense there was corruption in the\nghetto. Can -- can you explain that a little bit more, why -- why you think so, even though these\nmen never asked you for sex.",
        "A: No, personally, I was afraid of that because we knew -- knew stories -- of the stories where\nyoung women would go asking for a favor, including Rumkowsk1, and they had -- you know,\nthey were sexually assaulted, and they had to submit if they wanted this vital -- begging to take --\nyou know, to be gratified. Had to do with saving a life of a mother, a sister, etcetera. So in that\nway there was corruption of the people that had positions, they had the power to demand pay-\noffs, and in a sexual way from -- from women. That what I meant [indecipherable] what I said.",
        "Q: Right. So this provides an example of what you may not know in terms of your personal\nexistence, but assumed that there was a lot of different --",
        "A: Oh, we heard about it --",
        "Q: -- kinds of corruption going on.",
        "A: -- yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: There were circulating stories that women were telling about, and warning other people.",
        "Q: And was there other kinds of corruption? People paying off people to not be put in\ndeportations? Do you know?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know enough about it to really speak of it.",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure there were.",
        "Q: What was -- what were the relationships like? Well -- well let me do it smaller first. Ho --\nhow were the relations with your parents and your sister during this period? Was -- did things\nbecome more tense, or was it easy? I -- were you angry at your parents because yo -- there was a\nrole reversal, and they weren\u2019t protecting you, you were now protecting them in some way\u2019?",
        "A: There was a anger that you probably could not admit even to yourself, knowing the situation.\nNo, anger with my father that he told me you have to find a job, of course I was angry, but I had\nto keep it in, most of it, because -- because he was right. It was this role reversal in the ghetto\nthat the young people were made to take over, make decisions, give yi -- e-etcetera. They were\nalso the people that the life of the ghetto depend on, because they had the strength to work, and\nthe older generation was sort of losing this physical strength of working the factories.",
        "Q: So you think it was the younger people who were -- who kept the ghetto going, really.",
        "A: Yes. They were given the role, not that they asked for, but by the exhaustion of the older\ngeneration of their strength by doing that work for a year or two under conditions of hunger,\nlosing weight, illnesses, the younger were coming up, they had the strength to work. So they\ncould not complain, but they were angry for sure.",
        "Q: They were?",
        "A: I was, sure.",
        "Q: Yes. Because you were given a burden you didn\u2019t -- you would have preferred not to have.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, I didn\u2019t ask for it, and -- and it was a burden of saving the life of your mother.\nYou know, that\u2019s not small potatoes.",
        "Q: No, it\u2019s not. Now I -- 1-in some of the work that -- that I\u2019ve done, I noticed that for long\nperiods of time in the ghetto, the men had more jobs, many more jobs than the women did. Now\nI don\u2019t know whether as a person living in the ghetto you could even notice that. Did -- did you\nnotice that there were more men working at certain jobs? I don\u2019t mean just that there was a male\npolice force, I -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t mean that, but even in the factory, were there many more men\nthan there were women?",
        "A: Look, when we went into the war, and into the ghetto, the structure of society was not\ndissimilar in th-the structure of my family. The men worked, the women kept house.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, in the ghetto too, the primary role of men was to get a job and bring the bacon, maybe\nsalami, right? But there was no salami either.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Right? It was only because -- and of course there were some jobs that women from the\nbeginning, like the sewing job, you know --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- they sew -- I mean what -- they making -- were making clothing --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- clothing, so they were sewing machine, and for those job women were hired, and women\ndid that before the war, too. So some of those jobs were -- you know, sort of women were\nworking, young women, older women, but the majority job was men\u2019s job.",
        "Q: So does that mean that more women, do you think, were deported, because they didn\u2019t have\njobs, so they\u2019re more vulnerable to deportation?",
        "A: Not necessarily, becau -- because women started to -- to work.",
        "Q: To work, uh-huh.",
        "A: They got jobs, and they started to work. And -- in bigger numbers.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: There was a hat factory, they were making hats. There was the sewing factory, the women\nwere -- were working and making all kinds of apparels. So, you know, those were jobs that\nwomen could easy fit in.",
        "Q: Yeah, right.",
        "A: Kitchen work, women were doing that.",
        "Q: So did you ni -- besides the -- the corruption of -- of men being in certain positions of power\nand being able to say, you want this, you know --",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: -- pay for it, sleep with me, right?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Were there other ways in which you think there was a kind of a -- using the word\ndiscrimination is a har -- is a strange -- strange word, but that there were differences between the\nlives that men were leading and the lives that women were leading in the context of the ghetto.\nWhere as this -- is this one very important, because sexual exchange, that\u2019s what women have to\nexchange. And so that would be a lot of what might be going on in many instances.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: So, do you think that that was the primary difference between men and women, that there was",
        "A: Men were -- I mean, it was their experience from before the war, where men were employed,\nand gain, as a group of men, experience and know-how and in different jobs -- of course, in the\nghetto men got that differentiation too.",
        "Q: Yes, right.",
        "A: They were more fit for jobs, women were not prepared, they were not trained, much more so\nthan nowadays, where women are everywhere. But years ago, that was a more patriarchal\nsociety, like in my family, the men worked, the women stayed home.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Was the housekeeper. So that was a big minus for women. They had to change --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- under conditions.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something. In -- in the interview with Lanzmann --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- he asked you about thi -- there was a part of the interview, not that\u2019s on the screen, but in\nthe -- about thinking, and at one point you said, I couldn't think, I had to withdraw, because if\nyou thought, you would commit suicide. You would -- it -- it was impossible to think too much.\nDo you still think that about who you were then, that you -- you really, in order to survive, you\nsimply had to keep going in some practical way? It --",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So too much consciousness could kill you, too, in some -- 1n some respects.",
        "A: Well, I think I was pretty much conscious of what\u2019s going on, and in talking with Father and\nMother, you know, we were not suppressed of not thinking, and go on.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But you -- you had to, foremost -- I told you, we shall overcome. I was not conscious of that\nsentence then, but the philosophy was, go on, survive and tell the story. Which --",
        "Q: That really was conscious?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Did you know people who didn\u2019t feel that way? Who really went down -- not to --",
        "A: They did not survive. They got sick and died.",
        "Q: So what do you think is the difference? What is -- what 1 -- what is 1t about you and your\nfamily, you think? Does -- I mean, is there an -- even any way to know what it is that kept you\ngoing that way?",
        "A: I was raised that way. Don\u2019t ask me --",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Well ask me, you know, I\u2019m just telling you it\u2019s --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- very hard to -- to answer that question. I was raised that way on one hand with tremendous\nlove and care, and a certain discipline. And one example of that is like that. I remember -- I told\nyou we lived with my grandparents, entrance, a little hall, kitchen, bathroom, you go in a big\ndining room, old fashioned, with old fashioned furniture, you know, the carved furniture. My\ngrandparent\u2019s bedroom, and then the last room was a very huge room, that was our family room.\nIt was a dining room and a bedroom at the same time, a children -- everything, but a big room, a\nhuge table in the middle, oval table, and a lamp, a ceiling lamp from the ceiling and I remember\nit had a green -- light green silk -- what do you call this outside of the lamp?",
        "Q: Ah, lampshade.",
        "A: Lampshade, and lights in the middle. And that was the place where everything was taking\nplace. We would eat there, I would make homework. And homework my father was involved for\na number of years with me, doing every day homework. And I would work with my father, he\nwas a pai -- he painted well, he drew well, and he showed me how, and all that. And I remember\none scene, I was sitting with my father, and he was watching me drawing, and watching. And I\nremember I drew a bunch of lilac. Blue lilac. So that was a little branch with blue lilac and\nleaves. And I was very busy drawing that, my father on this side. And I looked up, and there\u2019s\nmy mother standing beside me, and shaking her head to what my father saying, she\u2019s doing very\nwell, you know, without saying. And I looked, and I was so happy, because my mother was not\none to gr -- congratulate me or tell me you\u2019re doing well, never, okay? I was doing, it was my\njob, whatever, and that\u2019s it. It was the only time that I saw she really cares. And she approves of\nthe work that my father is doing with me. And that memory survived untouched for all those\nyears.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s what gave you a kind of strength, you think?",
        "A: I think so.",
        "Q: You think so?",
        "A: I think so. Approval and strength. Silent approval, not approval gushing you\u2019re great and so\non, to blow up my head, but approval. And you know, a message.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I don\u2019t have to tell you that. The -- only one time you can see that, but you know. You should\nknow.",
        "Q: But you also had something from your grandmother who was so affectionate, and clearly\nloved you a lot.",
        "A: Oh yes. It was another memory. I told you, I could always jump in her lap and she would hold\nme --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: --and caress me, and so on. And then too, there was a time -- you know, the -- really, my\nparents had it good, she was a built-in babysitter, right?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: She was not going out mu-much. So I stayed and they would go out, and they would go out to\nsee the concert and so on. Later they, when I grew up more, they were taking me Jewish theater\nand other theater, so I was -- and I got to know the writers and actors because I would come\noften with my father to the administration, to the newspaper room, and there were always some\nactors and writers bringing book -- you know, eager to be, you know, put into the press. And I\nwould shake hands, three years, four years old, with the biggest Jewish actors in town, that\nwould come for shows and so on. It was wonderful, you know? So this night they were going to\ntheater, and I stayed home and I got sick. As a kid I would get often sick with croup, you know,\nthis bad cough?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Croupy cough. And I was coughing and coughing and crying, Mama, Mama. My\ngrandmother got scared and she called the ambulance, you know, because she didn\u2019t know what\nto do with me. The ambulance came, and then my parents came, so [indecipherable] they still\nhere, the ambulance people left, and my mother got furious with grandmother and told her, she\njust fooled you, you should know better. [indecipherable]. Never do it again. You should not\nhave called the ambulance, because there\u2019s nothing wrong with her. She just had the croup. That\nwas my mother, too.",
        "Q: Was she right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That you were exaggerating?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And you knew it.",
        "A: Yeah, I thought she was right, later on particularly. When I became a mother. That was an\nexample. My mother was a doctor, she didn\u2019t need any other doctors, she was herself the doctor.",
        "Q: Right, she -- she knew.",
        "A: She knew.",
        "Q: Did you get sick in the ghetto, besides being hungry and turning into skeletons, sort of? No.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Doesn\u2019t that surprise you? Under those conditions that you never got sick?",
        "A: Maybe I had a cold or so, but I don\u2019t --",
        "Q: No, I mean --",
        "A: -- remember being seriously ill.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Not your parents either?",
        "A: In the ghetto? Yes, my mother got very ill. She got ill with dysentery and was very, very ill.\nAnd I was on the -- on the farm, living on the farm then. And that was the only time that I needed\nhelp for my mo -- mother, it was some medication, or food stamps, you know. And didn\u2019t want\nto go to Rumkowski, but I went to somebody else. What -- you say, what was her -- his\nsecretary.",
        "Q: Fuchs?",
        "A: Fuchs.",
        "Q: Oh, Dora Fuchs --",
        "A: Dora Fuchs, or somebody else.",
        "Q: -- was the secretary.",
        "A: And they gave me some -- what I needed for my mother. And then she recovered. But my\nfather took care of her, not I.",
        "Q: Because you were away.",
        "A: I was away. And -- and he wouldn\u2019t let me either, you know, they took care of each other.",
        "Q: What sort of medicine is there for dysentery? Do you know? [indecipherable]",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, whatever it was --",
        "Q: It helped.",
        "A: -- or maybe it was some cottage cheese, some spec -- special dairy product that was to be\nhelpful. But that\u2019s when I needed -- a-and then when I tell you that different people needed some\nhelp --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- from there up --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- on special occasions. But, it was frightful.",
        "Q: In -- in general, what were the relationships like among people? Were -- were peop -- was\ntheir solidarity in the ghetto, or was everybody out for themselves, or out for their small family\ngroup? How do you remember other people?",
        "A: It was mixed. I don\u2019t know if I paid much attention. I -- you know, told you about my getting\ninto the friendship with the woman whose daughter was taken away. And there was another\nfriendship or relationship that I developed there, and that was also a Czech woman. The cze --\nthe Czech transport was so outstanding.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Such wonderful people. Really unbelievable. So this woman was talking with me about the\nplace to live. So I gave her, you know, we looked through the -- what\u2019s available, and wrote out\nwhere she should go. And she went and she came back, and she says, it\u2019s wonderful, I love it.\nLet me do a favor to you. Can I give you this, and she takes out a tchocki or something. I said,\n\u201cNo, nothing.\u201d Can I give you some money? I have to do something, I have to tell you thank\nyou. She came back again. And I was telling my mother what was happening, and thi -- she said,\n\u201cLook, I am very good dressmaker. Let me sew you a dress.\u201d So I came home -- and I said no,\nno, no. Listen, I am happy that you\u2019re happy [indecipherable]. So I came home and I told\nMother, and Mother said, \u201cPaula, let her do something for you.\u201d So ma -- Mother took out a\ngreen dress of grandmother that was very beautiful material, and was old and grandmother by\nthat time, either was before she died, or maybe after she died. And Mother said, \u201cGive her this\ndress, and let her sew you a dress.\u201d Which I did. And that was great. The dress didn\u2019t look so\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: The dress didn\u2019t look so great? So tell me, what 1s it -- what is when you tell that story, what\u2019s\n-- what -- why does it move you so much, do you think?",
        "A: I think because it\u2019s about my mother.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And her relationship with me, that I could talk to her, tell her, and she would always give me\nthe right answer, that still now today seems very correct. I didn\u2019t want to take jewelry, I didn\u2019t\nwant to take money, but let her sew you a dress.",
        "Q: Let her do something for you.",
        "A: Yes, and let her do something.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Well, that was one sort of relationship, other than that, what can I say?",
        "Q: What about the Germans? There\u2019s a -- the Germans have their administrative office inside the\nghetto, which is not the most usual procedure in these ghettos. So does that mean that you have\ncontact with these Germans? Or you don\u2019t have contact?",
        "A: God forbid.",
        "Q: Gosh --",
        "A: That was, you know, the center of the ghetto was the -- the marketplace from before the\nghetto was formed, and through the ghetto, and now, because I visited in Lodz. So those were\nmarketplaces where people were coming, you know, sell their wares and so on. That was turned\nin -- into the center of the ghetto administration. It mean rums -- Rumkowski\u2019s office was there,\nhis secretaries, and other people in the administration, and the German headquarters. Beside\nthere, there was another building that was the Gestapo. And that was fearsome to walk across\nthat, because atrocities were happening there. People called for no reason for interrogation, for\nconfiscation, for killing. So that was the German influence in the ghetto. Now, on this Balutski\nrinnek, Rumkowski was there and if you want -- if you needed a audience with him, it\u2019s where\nyou would go, or a audience with this Miss Fuchs, that\u2019s where you would go. And that was a\nplace too, that you don\u2019t pass easily, or go in easily. Part of that Balutski rinnek was also dedic --\nsort of kept for transport for -- let\u2019s say for vegetables and fruit. Fruit we didn\u2019t have, but\nvegetables. Frozen cabbage, frozen potatoes, all kinds of things, that\u2019s where they were dished\nout, you know, if you -- if you got to know that there is something there, and you came so you --\nyou got some. So that was part of -- o-of that center, too. And that was it. There were no\nGermans -- well, there were Germans around the border of the ghetto, you know, and -- the\nsentries, and the Gypsies across the ghetto.",
        "Q: And [indecipherable] there\u2019s no -- there was no interaction between the Jews and the\nGypsies?",
        "A: No way.",
        "Q: No. There were about 5000 Gypsies, I gather, in that section.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know the number, but we knew they are there, and that was it.",
        "Q: Did you know where they came from?",
        "A: Hungary, Romania. That sort of comes to mind.",
        "Q: You know, I ask you about the Germans because I ask you so many questions about the\ninternal relationship amongst the Jews, and it isn\u2019t the Jews who formed the ghetto, or who\ndecided upon this process, it was the Germans.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: So I need to ask you about the Germans to see what sort of relationship. So did you ever see\nBiebow? No. Did -- Himmler visited -- you didn\u2019t see, no. Nothing. Do you remember ever\nseeing Rumkowski walk around, or be on his -- was -- did he have a -- a car that he rode in?",
        "A: He had a car, I told you I saw him few times --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- when he was coming courting his future wife --",
        "Q: His wife.",
        "A: -- on our street. Other than that, the one remarkable place, it was the graduation from school\nthat, you know, he was present and you know, asked the student and parent and he was giving\nspeeches and how proud he was and how grateful -- how great he felt to graduate a bunch of kids\nfrom high school.",
        "Q: Right. Do you remember seeing him wearing high boots? Someone said he wore very high\nboots.",
        "A: Like the Germans?",
        "Q: Yeah. [indecipherable] maybe like the Germans.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: No, huh?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: There were hangings in the ghetto, weren\u2019t there? And were you forced to see these wi -- you\nwere.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: So was everybody in the ghetto forced to --",
        "A: The hanging were on a little -- not place, but a -- a little marketplace, other than this Balutski\nrinnek. And there were buildings around that market, and one of the building was the office of\nhousing, where I worked. And when the hanging were happening, we were asked to come down\nand watch.",
        "Q: To watch people being --",
        "A: The hanging.",
        "Q: -- hung.",
        "A: Being hung.",
        "Q: That must have been really awful.",
        "A: Forced. We were forced.",
        "Q: You were forced.",
        "A: To see.",
        "Q: More than once?",
        "A: More than once. And there were speeches of course, that I think once those guys, they were\ntrying to run away from the ghetto and they were caught, or others were stealing or whatnot, you\nknow, but they were hung.",
        "Q: And who was doing the hanging? The Germans? Or could you tell, even?",
        "A: No German. Jews were doing the killing. Ger-Germans were there on their post, you know,\nwatching it all, supervising it.",
        "Q: But the so-called [indecipherable]",
        "A: But there were the Jews that were hanging, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay, I think we need to change tapes.\nEnd of Tape Seven\nBeginning Tape Eight",
        "Q: Paula, did -- did you -- was there something called the chronicles of the Lodz ghetto that you\nread, people put out a newspaper of some kind with the news on it? Or was the chronicle a sort\nof underground?",
        "A: Don\u2019t recall, really.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t recall, okay.",
        "A: But we had a theater and concerts --",
        "Q: You did.",
        "A: -- in the ghetto, yes, mm-hm.",
        "Q: And were they good?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And did you go often?",
        "A: I went enough, you know, we had quite few times.",
        "Q: Like once a week, or less than that?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think they were that often.",
        "Q: They weren\u2019t that often.",
        "A: Maybe once a month, or so.",
        "Q: Did somebo -- did you have to pay to get in?",
        "A: Yes, ghetto money, which was worthless anyway, so it was sort of -- what could you get for\nit? A concert.",
        "Q: But the ghet -- but the ghetto money functioned inside the ghetto, right?",
        "A: That\u2019s right, you could, you know, you could buy bread and other st-stuff with the ghetto\nmoney, yes.",
        "Q: Did it have his picture on it, Rumkowsk1?",
        "A: I cannot tell you, I don\u2019t recall.",
        "Q: Do you remember pictures of Rumkowski up in offices?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: And if there were, I don\u2019t recall.",
        "Q: Maybe you didn\u2019t want to see them, if they were.",
        "A: That\u2019s for sure.",
        "Q: In August there was going to -- there was a deportation, right, that\u2019s --",
        "A: \u00b044.",
        "Q: -- when they start, 1944.",
        "A: 1944.",
        "Q: Do you hear about this sort of liquidation -- it\u2019s not exactly a liquidation because people\naren\u2019t being killed then, they\u2019re being sent out.",
        "A: Mm-hm, but that was a liquidation of the ghetto.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: It stopped existing.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The structure stopped existing.",
        "Q: Right. And does -- it stopped before August, I as -- I imagine. Or am I wrong?",
        "A: End of August was the last transport that left the -- you know, the ghetto. And Rumkowski\nwas on that --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- transport. Now they left a crew of Jews on the Balutski rinnek you know, in the center, to\nclean up. You know, clean up the space, put away stuff, etcetera, clean up. And a good number\nof those people, I think two -- 300 people were able to hide in the last minute, and survived. Th -\n- it was shortly before the Russian troops marched in. So a good number -- good number, 200 or\nSO --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- Jews saved their lives, the ones that worked on -- on the Balutski rinnek, and were asked to\nstay to clean up.",
        "Q: You were not asked to stay.",
        "A: Oh no, I did -- I didn\u2019t work there.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Those were workers there.",
        "Q: Who worked in -- in that area.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s right, yes.",
        "Q: So what happened to you and your family at that -- at that time during the August\ndeportations?",
        "A: During the August deportation, y-you had to make a decision to go voluntarily or not, you\nknow? There was a station, a train station called Radogoszcz, where the trains were set up to\nleave. And you had to make up your mind if -- you were assigned a day where to -- when to go. I\ndon\u2019t remember how it happened. And I said, \u201cI am not going voluntarily. I am not going.\u201d And\nmy mother wrung her ha -- ha -- hands, what do we do, and turning to me, what do we do. You\nknow, I have to --",
        "Q: You have to give --",
        "A: -- to tell her what to do. So I say, \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I don\u2019t want to go.\u201d So let\u2019s try to hide.\nAnd we hid. I had a friend around there, and she had a policeman that was sort of high up in the\nSonderkommando, and he knew what to do, but eventually didn\u2019t know, nobody knew. So we\nwere hiding in a place that already was evacuated, but out -- out of a -- our house, because we\nhad to get out of where we lived, so -- to be close to the train station. So we hide -- we did hide\nin a house that was strange -- you know, we didn\u2019t know it, but -- and spend a couple days or\nmore, waiting for some signal from God, or who knows who, what to do. And then we were\nwatching through the windows how the German SS were walking and pulling people out, and\nbring -- you know, marching them to the train station. And we didn\u2019t know what they do with\nthem, do they shoot them on the way or not. So the outlook for successful hiding was ne-never --\nnot too good. And we were losing -- we are losing the -- the willpower to hide and be dragged\nout and killed. So it was sort of what happened to everybody, will happen to us too. You know,\nresignation. And one day we just showed up at the point where they were collecting people and\nmarching them to the station of Radogoszcz, and putting them on the cattle -- cattle train -- cattle\nwagons. And that\u2019s how we landed there.",
        "Q: So this was you, your younger sister, your mother and your father. Your grandparents have --",
        "A: Dead by then.",
        "Q: -- are dead by then.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And this is a train trip of a day, two days? It\u2019s hard to remember, I imagine.",
        "A: It\u2019s hard to remember how long it took.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: It\u2019s a pretty fair distance, with a train that doesn\u2019t go too fast. So hours, many hours.",
        "Q: Was it awful on the train?",
        "A: Pretty awful. No water, no toilet, nothing.",
        "Q: Was there a bucket for a toilet?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think there were buckets either.",
        "Q: How old are your parents by now? You\u2019re -- you\u2019re now 22 years old, about.",
        "A: Yeah. My mother was 47 years old, my father was 51 years old.",
        "Q: An-And are they still strong?",
        "A: Pretty strong --",
        "Q: They\u2019re okay, they\u2019re pretty strong.",
        "A: Yes, they were pretty -- in good health.",
        "Q: Right. So you get to Auschwitz, di -- you\u2019ve heard about Auschwitz? Bef --",
        "A: We heard the name mentioned, but not really, we did not hear, other than we heard, you\nknow, gas, and crematoria and death, mm-hm.",
        "Q: So is -- so is that what you expected?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That you would go there and you\u2019d be killed?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So you get off this train, is it daytime, nighttime, morning?",
        "A: Was daytime.",
        "Q: Daytime. A train with a lot of people on it?",
        "A: Lot of people, loaded, full trains.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s a full train from Lodz?",
        "A: Lodz, mm-hm. And as we get unloaded, there were SS men, few, but mainly Jews working\nthere, they were the sonderco -- Jewish jo -- Sonderkommando, and they were unloading us. Get\nout, outsteigen, get out, and so on. And we ask, where are we? Where are we going? And they\nsaid in Hebrew, to mishpitt.",
        "Q: Mishpitt?",
        "A: Mishpitt is the -- the day of reckoning -- wa -- how do you say it, the day of -- the judgment,\nday of judgment, the judgment day. In Hebrew, mishpitt. So it was clear what they were saying.",
        "Q: This is it.",
        "A: Death, to death, yes. So we are herded in groups and start marching. And of course, all the\nthings that we were carrying with us, bundles or so, were taken away and thrown on the street,\nyou know, next to the train. So we were relieved of the luggage, and marched to the camp.",
        "Q: Now you\u2019re -- the train comes up close to Birkenau, yes? So you go -- but does the train go\nunder this underpass, or are you outside and you walk in, do you remember\u2019?",
        "A: Life mu -- \u201cArbeit macht frei.\u201d That was the big sign there were.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Work sets you free, \u201cArbeit macht frei\u201d. And we marched -- we didn\u2019t know anything,\nBirkenau or not Birkenau, because they -- that probably the train stopped in Auschwitz proper\nand we were marched to Birkenau.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.",
        "A: Or we -- the train went to Birkenau and we were marched to the -- to the showers. You know,\nto the place where we were greeted, and the greeting was, take off your clothes, stay naked, and\naround were women, men, and the first thing that they were doing were shaving us. Our heads,\nall hair of our body. Man did that. I suppose that was Sonderkommando, too, Jews doing it. And\nthen we were --",
        "Q: But you\u2019re not with your father. You\u2019re father\u2019s been separated, or am I wrong?",
        "A: Take me back. We go, we walk, and then we -- we walk to the point where Mengele is\nstanding, you know, the German physician, and says, you know, women left, men right, and men\ngo right away to the other side, and women go to this side, and then we march in front of\nMengele. And so it is Mother, me and my sister. And he pulls Mother out to one side, and us to\nthe other side. And I said, \u201cI want to go with Mother.\u201d I follow Mother, and he pulls me out and\nsends me to the other side, to left instead of right, which the right was going to --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]. How -- how did you know it was Mengele?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know it was Mengele. That was a physician, we knew a physician, people were\ntalking, I don\u2019t know who.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.",
        "A: But we later find out that -- you know, or people were talking because they knew from some\nof the Sonderkommand that this is Mengele, this is Mengele. So we knew the name.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the face, now the face, so we knew that was the physician of Auschwitz, the famous one.\nAnd then we go, I and my sister are left, and we are led to this big hole where, you know, we sat\nnaked and shaved, and then led to showers. And we knew already that the showers mean death,\nso -- and that was sort of -- we all were looking for -- you know, for death. As it happened, of\ncourse, the ones that we were with did not get killed, we were really taking showers, and given\nsome so-called clothing, one shoe high heeled, one shoe low heeled, and s -- coup -- and a couple\nof sort of schmates, and led to barracks, we were led then to the barracks.",
        "Q: Were you tattooed?",
        "A: No, our transport was not tattooed.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: And there was a number of transport that -- I think it was August already and I don\u2019t think\nthey had time any more for things like -- for -- for playful things like that, so we didn\u2019t get\ntattooed. And we were led to the barracks, and a-acquainted with the kapo, which was a woman\nand her helper. And the kapo had, in this big barrack had a wonderful room, nicely furnished and\nall that, nice. She had a very important role, and was paid for that by special favors. And that\u2019s\nhow it started, life in Auschwitz started. So before we were sent to the barracks, we still had to\nstay on si -- c\u2019est l\u2019appel, which was counting down a -- how many people we are, and that took\nhours. It was way into the night. And then we were sent to the barracks, and given space enough\n-- not enough to stretch out. There were like five in a row, five women in a row, not enough to\nstretch out, but just to curl up somehow, and that was our first day and first night in Auschwitz.\nEarly in the morning was c\u2019est l\u2019appel again, where we were standing and were counted. Every\nday, twice a day, was hours, it took hours to be counted. And the number better be right, or else\nwe were --",
        "Q: Otherwise they count again.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: Otherwise they count again, yes.",
        "A: Right. And there were incidents where somebody would run away, and we would stand for\nhours, and then that person was brought back and killed. And so, you know, to give an example\nwhat happens if you think of running away. And life started there.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a bit ironic, isn\u2019t it? Life starts --",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Now, did you know rather soon what probably happened to your mother?",
        "A: Of course. We knew right away.",
        "Q: You knew right away.",
        "A: Yeah. Those people were sent o -- didn\u2019t know what happened to Father.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I found out much later on, you know, in Lodz, when I was back in Lodz from a friend of\nFather, that was with him in the same camp, they were sent off to camps outside Auschwitz, and\nI think he told me that my father died in one of those marches to another camp, on the way. So,\nhe died. If he was -- I assume that he was killed, you know, because in a march, when you si --\nwhen you slow down, there was the SS man then helped you die quicker. So I assume that what\nhappened to Father.",
        "Q: Now, a number of hours ago when we started, and I asked you about your relationship to your\nsister, it wasn\u2019t -- you didn\u2019t like that she was there, blah, blah, blah.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: But something changed in Auschwitz. So now --",
        "A: Yes, y-y-you see, though Mother was very careful not to load me, the older sister with\nresponsibility for my -- for my sister, nevertheless, it was I was the older sister, and I didn\u2019t like\nit, you know? If she didn\u2019t load me, I thought she expect me anyhow to help her with homework,\nand s -- so I had the special duty of an older sister that I did not like. And she couldn\u2019t do nothing\nfor me. You know, it was all one way, though she tried. She did the dishes, and she just tried.\nShe loved me and she tried so hard, poor thing. And then in Auschwitz, we were together. And\nthe c\u2019est \u2019appel you had to lined out with five -- five women to the count, and the five women\nslept together, sort of in one row. So there was myself, my sister and three other women. And we\nsort of hung out together, and that was it. Then I became ill. I developed -- really, I got sick with\ntyphoid fe-fever. You know, fever and diarrhea and all of that, and I had no choice but report to\nthe hospital, which was another terrible thing, because we hear terrible things what happens in\nthe hospital. But I had no choice, so I went to the hospital. My sister stayed. And 1-1n the\nhospital, I ended up on the ward, the infectious disease ward. And we had a wonderful woman\npediatrician that was from town, Dr. Greenberg, and her daughter was there, too. And she was a\nwonderful physician and treated us well. Every day or every other day, Mengele would come and\nsegregate people that he thought should die already. So we had visits to -- of that sort. And then\none day -- then it was one room, and there was the other room, and between the rooms were\nknocked out, you know, a knocked out hall that you could look into the other room. And I found\nout that my sister is there. You know, she got ill, too, and came. And so I could communicate,\nand we communicated. Twenty-sixth of September it was her birthday, so I made her a present, I\nsaved up some bread, and some sausage, and gave her the happy birthday sandwich. Not only\nthat, in Auschwitz, before I became ill, and when I started to be not feeling well, our role\nchanged. She took care -- was taking care of me and doing everything for me, and being\nthoughtful and caring. It was just a different sister I had. For the first time in my life she was\ntaking care of me. I needed her help. And it was so great. But short-lived, you know, so we\nended up in the hospital.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Then one day we hear -- oh, and then it was -- they -- medically they treated us very well.\nIsolated, with the -- was a -- they were examining every day the stool, etcetera, and blood, so\nthey know when people were well, and when they got well they were sent out back to the main\ncamp. And one day I was told that I am well, that her examination came negative and I can go\nback. And I told that to my sister, and she says, \u201cSo go back.\u201d So I said, \u201cNo, I will wait for\nyou.\u201d \u201cOh, what are you doing, that\u2019s dangerous, you know. You may get killed.\u201d Cause\nperiodically they were cleansing the hospital to the -- to the gas chambers. So she says, \u201cWell,\nyou know, they may catch you.\u201d I say, \u201cI don\u2019t care, you know, I don\u2019t want to be separate from\nyou. So I wait and then we\u2019ll go together.\u201d\u2019 And then in couple days we hear rumors that they are\ngoing to liquidate the infectious disease hospital. And true enough, one day the trucks come, and\nI could see it through the window, and they are going to do that, okay? So we hear the s -- SS\nmen coming in, and we were sort of in the middle, so they come there and the hole -- now we\ncould communicated -- communicate with my sister through the hole, but there was no way that I\ncould come to her -- her room, or she could come to my room. There was -- there was no\npossibility. They had sentry watching. So she and I talked, and she says, \u201c\u201cWhat are we going to\ndo?\u201d I say, \u201cDorka, I don\u2019t know what to do, do you?\u201d \u201cNo, what are we going to do?\u201d So I said,\n\u201cWell, I cannot come to your room so we could be together and go wherever together, you\ncannot come here, so I really don\u2019t know.\u201d I suppose we could not cry even, you know, it was\nbeyond crying. Then I hear steps and the sentries coming to our room, and saying to la -- for us\nto line up, so people start lining up. And I just was not eager to line up up front, so I was sort of\nholding back and watching. And people started to leave the room. And towards the end I see two\ngirls are jumping under the -- the beds, you know, the -- what you call it?",
        "Q: Bunk beds?",
        "A: Bunk bed -- beds. And I say, wow, not a bad idea. So people are leaving and I am holding\nback. And I start jumping under -- on the other end, under the bunk. Well -- and those two start\ncrying, don\u2019t do that, you will give us out, they will kill us because of you. Needless to say I did\nnot listen to that, and I stayed under one bunk bed, and that was it. And of course, I hear then,\nyou know, they go to the next room where my sister is, and the room gets emptied, and I could\nsee through the window, there was a window, the truck is waiting there, and they climb naked\ninto the truck. Hours pass, and it gets dark, and two SS men come in the room with lantern and\ndogs and start, you know, looking. Ser -- search light under the bunk beds, and did not find us.\nAnd they leave, and we still there, under, you know, waiting couple hours or so until 1t was\ntotally quiet. The buses were -- have left, and we started to talk with each other and say well,\nmaybe it\u2019s time to get out and see what\u2019s -- what\u2019s happening. So we get out and go up front,\nthrough a big hole, nurse\u2019s stations. And we find out that a number of people are left. First of all,\nsome people not from the infectious disease division. Some doctors, women doctors, and we join\nthe group. And then, I don\u2019t know how long we waited, but we were put on a train and\ntransported, we didn\u2019t know where to, but it was a benign atmosphere. We were transported to\nBirkenau to the old -- to the camp from which we originally came. And that camp was leaving\nnext morning in trains, to go who knows where -- to a camp, to another camp, you know, so who\nknows, and who has to believe that. And indeed we -- we left, still not knowing, still full of fear,\nwhat will be in the train, gas in the train, the -- you know, this in the train. And we were\ntransported to a camp in -- in a forest. It was Silesia, the German Silesia. You know, Auschwitz\nis in Silesia, the Polish Silesia, and more left is the German Silesia, but still Silesia in the forest\nand outl -- unloaded in woods. Forest, pine forest. And -- and led to -- to tents. In each tent there\nwere eight women or so. The bedding was pine branches, and the cover was pine branches a-and\n-- and hay. And that where we lived from then on, for the next couple months. Digging --\ndidding -- digging ditches --",
        "Q: Ditches.",
        "A: -- against tanks, Russian camp -- tanks that were -- that were a -- coming soon. So that was\nour -- and it was November, December.",
        "Q: So it was hard to dig?",
        "A: With hardly any clothes on us, o-on -- on our backs.",
        "Q: We have to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape Eight\nBeginning Tape Nine",
        "Q: C-Can I ask you something about Auschwitz for just a second? Because it\u2019s -- unless I\nmisheard you, you said that you were taken from the hospital back to Birkenau.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: So does that mean the hospital you were in was not in Birkenau? You were in Auschwitz one?",
        "A: No, no. I --",
        "Q: Or you were in another part of Birkenau?",
        "A: Another part of Birkenau.",
        "Q: Okay. And did they take you bay truck back to your barracks? Is that what they did? Or you\ndon\u2019t remember?",
        "A: I remember it being on the train. So maybe it was Auschwitz, you know, the real Auschwitz\ncamp, not Birkenau, but it was a distance. The hospital was a distance from the Birkenau\nbarracks.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So they were taking us back to the barrack parts.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then we had to walk a bit and go to the barracks.",
        "Q: Do you remember what barrack it was?",
        "A: Number? No, I don\u2019t.",
        "Q: Do you remember whether it was on the far right, where the -- they used to call Mexico, or --",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember Mexico.",
        "Q: -- you don\u2019t remember the ba --",
        "A: Mm-mm.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t say, but I\u2019m assuming that your sister was taken.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: She was. And that was --",
        "A: The end.",
        "Q: -- that was the end.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: So you were not able to say good-bye, nothing?",
        "A: Well, that I think was the worst day in my whole experience about Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Was that.",
        "A: Was that. That day. That always in my mind, you saved your life, but you could not save your\nsister.",
        "Q: Even though you know that you couldn\u2019t have saved her.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: It still -- and it\u2019s the same with your parents, in your head.",
        "A: Stronger.",
        "Q: Stronger?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That you somehow should have been able --",
        "A: Yes. Cause in a symbolic way, my mother in Auschwitz, gave me the job to take care of my\nsister. And the symbolic way was that before we entered -- before we were parted, she gave me a\nlittle handkerchief with few jewelry pieces, her pieces, few ri -- you know, that was not much to\ntalk about, but few rings, and a necklace of hers. And she gave it to me, and says -- she said, take\ncare.",
        "Q: You\u2019re not over it yet. I guess there\u2019s no getting over it. So I can\u2019t say anything.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: I can\u2019t say anything. I can\u2019t take it away. I'd like to take it away from you. But you also feel\nas if you\u2019re responsible for your parent\u2019s deaths.",
        "A: Yes. But especially for my sister, because of that exchange. And then later I was not so clear,\nbut later I said, well she kid not -- could not mean the few pieces of gold, she meant my sister, to\ntake care of.",
        "Q: Care of. Not to take care of these, yeah. Did you still have a desire to live in spite of that?\nWhen you went to this new camp, when you -- when you would say to me in -- in -- in Lodz,\nthough we didn\u2019t know the words, we were going to overcome, we were going to survive. Did\nyou feel that, or were you --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: You did?",

        "Q: Right. To yourself.",
        "A: The Germans, to give in and let them kill me? Take my life, too? That was a different\nmessage --",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: -- than --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I live and they died, and I shouldn\u2019t live. And that\u2019s a different --",
        "Q: Different message.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And it\u2019s not incongruous, it\u2019s --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- experience at the same time.",
        "Q: Yeah. So you\u2019re in this subcamp of Auschwitz in Silesia --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- with part of the people who were the staff of the hospital, is that true?",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know, then we got mixed up, totally, so it -- it was a different story.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, I see. Did you know any of these people?",
        "A: I knew a few people.",
        "Q: You knew a few.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: From way back, you know, those Lodz people --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So I knew some --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- the people.",
        "Q: How bad was it in the subcamp? Was it really -- was it worse than Auschwitz, or did you now\nknow they\u2019re not going to gas me?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know anything. They can take their way any place, anytime, so that was not\nunfinished story.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: But how was it? It was very cold, standing in the cold with hardly any clothes, digging ditches\nwith very little to eat, and then coming to this tent. There was sentry, there was a little stove, a\nlittle -- you know oven, that gave a little hit -- and heat, and we could dry maybe some clothing,\nsocks -- we didn\u2019t have socks -- you know, on the oven, and then go to sleep. The air was good,\nthough cold. And we huddled together, and we slept and we went up and we were up day in, day\nout. And in short time there was something very much that lifted our mood. And that was more\noften we heard airplanes buzzing overhead, and we saw at the same time the German commander\nand his helper looking up and crying.",
        "Q: Crying?",
        "A: Mm-hm. Those men -- those were not German airplanes, right?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You guess who it was.",
        "Q: Russians.",
        "A: Sure. And we were laughing. I-I mean, we didn\u2019t laugh in their face, right?",
        "Q: Right. So 1-in your view, something was going to happen quickly.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Did it?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: But before that, let me tell you one thing, in the barracks in Auschwitz. We had a -- we heard\na number of times airplanes above our head, and we could go out and see the airplanes flying\nvery low. Those were not Russians, those were American planes. With insigna -- insignias, U.S.,\netcetera, etcetera. And we are in the barrack, and praying in unison, drop a bomb on us. Why\ndon\u2019t you drop a bomb?",
        "Q: On you.",
        "A: On the barrack.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: At least --",
        "Q: But then you\u2019d be killed.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: It didn\u2019t matter.",
        "A: Didn\u2019t matter. Do something. Somebody do something. Drop a bomb on the railway. But at\nthat point we were praying drop a bomb, just don\u2019t be so sadistic and watch us and do nothing.\nThose were American planes.",
        "Q: Were you -- you left in October to go to this -- this subcamp 1n Silesia, I think. Am I right?",
        "A: Something like that, yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember whether the uprising in Auschwitz had taken place, or you went to this\ncamp before?",
        "A: I -- we heard about it, but frankly I don\u2019t remember much about it, and I -- I must have known\nmore, but I don\u2019t remember what I knew.",
        "Q: You may not have been there.",
        "A: I -- I might have been in the hospital.",
        "Q: Right. Okay. So were you angry at the Americans?",
        "A: And how.",
        "Q: Yeah. You still are.",
        "A: I\u2019m still.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Of course I still am. More so later, because you know there is history now. There were\npeople, particularly one Polish aristocrat, I forget his name, that went to Warsaw ghetto and saw\nwhat\u2019s going on, and he went to Washington to talk to Roosevelt and to London and tell them\nwhat\u2019s going on in Warsaw ghetto, and they wou -- didn\u2019t want to believe him.",
        "Q: Karsk1.",
        "A: Karski, right.",
        "Q: The courier.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Mm. That was [indecipherable]",
        "A: That what confirmed the airplanes going above our heads and doing nothing.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: What cynicism. And Roosevelt saying we -- first we have to finish the war, then we\u2019ll think\nabout the Jews.",
        "Q: Nothing much has changed, has it?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Mm. Do you escape from this camp in Silesia?",
        "A: Escaped from the route. I told you how the rou -- how the Germans reacted to the --",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: -- sight of planes, and probably to the news that they were getting through the radio and so on.\nYou know, they knew more than just the planes, they knew the army -- the Russians are coming.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So one day we get the order to get ready to march. We going to the west. And then when the\nDeath March, so-called Death March started -- you know about that, right?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Evacuating the camps to the west. So we got ready to the March. What -- how should we get\nready, w-we had nothing.",
        "Q: Nothing to pack, huh?",
        "A: Nothing to pack and nothing to worry about, who to li -- leave behi-behind or not. And the --\nthey had a good number of German women, SS women, and they packed their things, and they\nwent into the wagon, a big wagon, the women. And they -- we, the -- the slaves, had to pull that\nwagon with the -- those German madams sitting there, taking turns, and that was a added bonus\nfor the Death March. So we were going and going and going, and where are we going? We\ndidn\u2019t know where we going. You know what happened, the Death March ended in Bergen-\nBelsen, right, on the west border. We didn\u2019t dare s -- to slow down, because if you slowed down,\nyou were dead. You know, the -- you know, they shoot the women, many women were shot on\nthe way.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So you have to use all your strength to go. And on the third day I said I -- wherever we going\nI won\u2019t make it because I am totally exhausted. And that night we were finished at a farm, at a\nbig farm, and slept over, on the ground of course, under cover. And th -- in that farm there were\nin -- under a shed, there were three big kettles of molasses. They were making molasses, okay?\nHungry as we were, you know what we did. We threw us -- ourselves on the molasses and ate\nthe molasses and you know what happened later. Diarrhea and vomiting.",
        "Q: Oh my gosh.",
        "A: And I wake up, and I said, which way do I want to die. I have to find a way, because I am not\nmaking it. So at that time I was talking with a friend of mine, you know, a neighbor on my street\nfrom before the war, and in the same class, graduating from Rumkowski\u2019s high school. And she\ntoo said, well, we have to think about something. So we started to think and work together. And\nwhat we were observing is that we are going through one village after another with a very\nnarrow village street -- road, really, and that the houses beyond the fence looked empty, and we\ndon\u2019t see any people there. You know, one village after another. So the conclusion was that they\neva -- they evacuated the Germans earlier, wherever. So we thought, well, 1t will be easy enough\nto get to one of the houses if we think about it. And that\u2019s one way, taking a chance. If Germans\nare there, we are dead. If we march we are dead, so what do you have to lose? So we picked a\ntime where the sentries were not in the -- at the place that we were close by, but you know, it was\na very long line of women marching. Started with a thousand women and shrinking. So the\nsentries were sort of spaced, so we thought, well, that\u2019s time. And we just didn\u2019t have to go far to\nthe right, we were marching that way, houses were here. And we opened the door -- you know,\nthe -- undone the door, and we go in. And then, on the left hand side was a barn, so we go around\nthe barn and get into the barn and jump into the stack of hay, and stay quietly there.",
        "Q: Inside the hay.",
        "A: Inside the hay. And we heard the march going on, and in not too long time, it was quiet, so\nthey passed. So we waited longer, longer, til it cleared, til it was to -- completely quiet and got\ndark. And started to listen what\u2019s going on on this side. And we heard voices. We heard voices,\nand we heard a language -- a Slavic language but could not distinguish. It was not Polish, but we\nknew that 1-in Germany there were many workers -- farm workers taken from Russia, from\nUkrainia, from Belarus. So that all could be there. So after we got some reasonably time, we\nsaid, oh we have to go and see who is there. So we went and opened the door, and say hello, and\nhappy to see you, and there were few women and few men sitting around. And they don\u2019t look\nvery favorably at us. And they say -- they -- they didn\u2019t say anything, they knew who we are.\nShaved heads, you know, schmates on us. So we say, yes we just run away from the -- from the\nmarch, and we ask for help, kindly. You are Jews. Get out of here. Okay. There was no way to\ndiscuss an answer like that coming from the group. So we left, and we were in the -- you know,\non the outside again, and what to do? Well -- and they also said there are Germans in the village,\nand they will catch you. So we thought they may be right, they don\u2019t have to be right. Our\nthinking was clear, you know, in all that, the thinking was clear. So we look around, and started\nto explore slowly. And what we see on the street in the middle of the road, many dead German\nsoldiers, okay, with guts spilling out, and -- there was a fight, there was a battle, and left the\nGermans behind, so they are -- the Russians are probably advanced beyond that village. That\nwould be then to the east, and the Russians would be going west. So finally we see a house on a\nlittle hill, so we go out there. We\u2019re looking now for shelter. And we see the door is locked, but\nthe key 1s hanging on the left hi -- side of the door. The family left the key so when they come\nback they open the door again, okay? Evacuees. So we opened the door and farn -- found a well\nsupplied household, and food and wood and coal, you know, to heat and to eat and get sick from\novereating. And we made ourself at home there. And y -- cured our stomach eventually by, you\nknow, getting to some normal eating. And then what do we do? It\u2019s quiet, nobody moves. The\nnext few days we were explore the village slowly, seeing if somebody is there or not, and we\ndidn\u2019t find anybody so we were just, you know, nursing ourselves. It was warm and clean, and\nclean linen, and clean clothing, it was paradise. A German paradise. We can laugh now, huh?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So we say w-w-what\u2019s happening? And one night we hear marchers, you know, thump,\nthump on the road. We could oversee the road, the main road, east west, and we say who -- it\u2019s a\narmy we hear, who can it be? Either Germans or Russians. We didn\u2019t dare to move, but\neventually we say we have to see who it is. So we were slowly walking down that hill and\nlooking and trying to find who they are, and what we saw was a lot of white. A lot of white\nhorses, white, little horses. Soldiers on the horses are marching in white, and white hats and\nwhite fur. I say, well it looks like Siberia, you know, snow. So that -- perhaps they are Russian.\nSo we go closer, eventually, and then we had no doubt they are Russians, you know? Because --\nindeed, you know, the white hats and white thing and white horses. Everything to camouflage in\nSiberia, but that was winter, so that served everywhere in that part of Europe. And we see, you\nknow, officers on horses along the marchers and we say, well, let\u2019s take a chance, let\u2019s go and\ntalk to the officers. So we approach couple officers and we threw ourself in their arms and say,\nthank God, you are saving us, you know that? Well, they were glad to hear that, you know. They\n-- you know. So -- and we felt perfectly safe. So we asked, where you going? Na Berlin.",
        "Q: Ah.",
        "A: Okay. So I say, so what will be with us, aren\u2019t you going to stay here? And -- we were naive.\nAnd then they say no, we have to go -- we go to get Berlin, to free Berlin, and in couple days in a\ndifferent un -- different units will come here to stay, to -- the occupation army. So wait, they will\ncome. Well, we were jubilant, you understand, right? Our saviors are just here. Two, three days\npass, and then we see a bunch of young women marching 1n the direction of our house, because\nour house was lit. And as they come closer, we see those are our friends, those are the girls from\nAuschwitz. We know them. But they look -- they didn\u2019t look the same. So they come closer, and\nwe say, what happened to you? And they say, well, we were raped by the Russian army. And\nthey are coming here, too. They were much more east, so you know, the Russians encountered\nthem. Wow. They didn\u2019t want to stay, they wanted to go forwards, I don\u2019t know -- they had their\nplans how to go. And then is what are we going to do? We --",
        "Q: Never st -- never stops, right?",
        "A: Never stops.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We were forewarned, that\u2019s true. So, in another few days, and the army is marching again,\nand few officers are coming our way, every one with a bottle of whiskey in their hands. And they\noh, they hug us, my -- my was lublu. We love you. Let\u2019s have a party. So we -- w-we knew\nalready, but we are forewarned. We prepared a bundle to run away beforehand. And then we\nsaid, you know, come to the living room and sit down and they didn\u2019t need e-encouragement or\nmore invitation, so they came and sat down, and we said, my was lublu, too, but we will join you\nin few minutes, just be patient. And we --",
        "Q: Could you speak Russian? Some Russian, no?",
        "A: You could -- few words in Polish, you know, so y-you could make yourself understandable.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So we go and grab our bundles and go the back door to the road. And the Russians are\nmarching, you know, those were hu-humangous armies, you know? They are marching and we\nask them, where is your headquarters? So they told us, more east -- no, more west, and they were\ngoing, too. As you know they going now Berlin. So we [indecipherable] -- no, actually they said,\nthey -- the headquarters were most -- more east from they were coming. So they go west, we go\neast, and after awhile, we -- we chance upon the -- a small house that wa -- you know, a -- a\ncottage, really, German cottage, and the headquarters. And we ask to be led to the chief, to the\ncommander, and we tell the commander the story, where we from, and that we want -- we are on\nour way back home to Poland, Lodz, and would he -- and the danger of his soldiers, being raped,\netcetera, would he help us to get -- get back home? And he says yes, we\u2019ll help you. And he says\ngo to the kitchen, th-there are our women working, you join them, and -- and you can stay here.\nSo another chapter started. We were with the girls, the Russian girls in the kitchen, peeling\npotatoes, doing other things, and was fun. They are -- they were very friendly, they were singing\nall the time. And that part was fine. And we pel -- felt pretty safe. We slept -- so during the day\nwe were in the kitchen. At night -- it was the front line. From there, soldiers were going to the\nfront for the day, at night they came back to sleep. They were eating dinner in the dining room,\nand then they were sleeping on the floor, and we were sleek -- sleeping on the tables in the\ndining room. And it was pretty safe. It was -- it was good.",
        "Q: It\u2019s safer than being in the hay.",
        "A: Much.",
        "Q: Much safer. We have to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape Nine\nBeginning Tape 10",
        "Q: Paula, would you have considered that liberation? When you were with these -- the Russians,\nand you\u2019re sleeping on the tables, and the Russian soldiers are sleeping on the floor, I mean,\nwere you then free?",
        "A: We are on the way home.",
        "Q: On the way home. So you\u2019re going east.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: You\u2019re going towards Lodz.",
        "A: Towards Lodz. W -- our road to -- was to go west.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: No, east.",
        "Q: East.",
        "A: East, yes, mm-hm.",
        "Q: But are you -- do you consider yourself liberated from the Germans cause there are no\nGermans any more?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: So is there a -- a moment of -- you know, liberation is a very funny word, and I never un -- I\nnever know when -- is there really a moment when you feel free? It doesn\u2019t s -- 1t seems a little\nimpossible. It seems as if it\u2019s a -- a process as opposed to a moment.",
        "A: I think it\u2019s a process, and we were on the way.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And don\u2019t forget, we were on the front.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Right? The Russians were fighting to go -- they were going west, and they were fighting their\nway -- na Berlin, the goal was Berlin.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: They were -- they were far from Berlin still.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Right, right.",
        "A: So -- and there was no way of knowing if the Germans won\u2019t get back. You know, they could\nconquer -- a-and that what happened in that war. They were -- you know, they were not giving\nup easily.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Was the western armies or -- or the Russian armies. So we -- we knew that there is a big\nstrength that -- of -- of the --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- Germans. But they were, you know, the Russians were fight it -- fighting. And listening to\ntheir mood -- na Berlin and, the army\u2019s going na Berlin, ah, we are fighting with them.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know? It\u2019s happening. It\u2019s a turnaround. So we were just jubilous together with the --\nwith them.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: On the other hand, we knew that every morning troops were going out to the front that was\nnot far away. We -- we heard fightings, you know the shelling of each other, all day, and then the\nsoldiers came dead me -- you know, tired, home to the base, which was a small house, and they\nwere, you know, eating dinner, and -- and then conking out on the floor, going to sleep. So it was\nin the center of the war.",
        "Q: Right. What -- how was your being Jewish treated? Did they care? Were they sympathetic,\nwere they -- they di -- or what --",
        "A: No, we were so happy, so when we were sitting with the soldiers and eating dinner, they ask\nus about -- and a -- as I tol -- told you, between Polish and Russian we could understand each\nother, with difficulties, but we could make ourself understood, and they ask about us, where we\ncome from, who we are. So we were telling we are Jewish, we come from Auschwitz, and we are\nready to go home, thank you. And then one day, after a few days of such liberal talks, two\nofficers approached us, me and Vonda, and they introduced themselves, and they say, we are\nJewish. And we -- we -- we hear what you saying to the Russian soldiers and please stop telling\nthem that you are Jewish. They don\u2019t know we are Jewish. They hate Jews. So don\u2019t tell them\nwho you are. We will help you. Wow, that was a slap in the face. You know, to the liberators we\ncannot say we are Jewish. But those were astute officers, and they were Jews, and they -- we\nsensed that they know very well what they are talking about. And we were not surprised then.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So what\u2019s new?",
        "Q: Right. It\u2019s the same story.",
        "A: You know? Hm?",
        "Q: Same story.",
        "A: Same story. So that was that.",
        "Q: So no more talk about who you are?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And how did they help you, these officers?",
        "A: Oh, they were just keeping an eye on us for safety and so on. So just was good to know that\nwe have some comrades here that know what\u2019s cooking, and --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- share with us, so that was a good feeling. Friendship.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: This kind of a --",
        "Q: So did you stay with that group for awhile?",
        "A: We stay there for awhile, and they are promising us that they -- they are working on set -- on\nputting a train together that will go from that point to south Poland. And when the train is ready,\nwe are free to go. And it did not take very long. They told us, and they drove us to the station\nwhen the train was set. And we took a train and arrived in Lodz one day.",
        "Q: And you went back to Lodz because you thought what? You thought your father would\ncome? Did you think anyone would be there?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t think.",
        "Q: You didn't think.",
        "A: We were just wanting to go home.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Knowing that there\u2019s nobody, you know. I didn\u2019t have illusion that Mother will be there, or\nFather, or my sister.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: But that\u2019s home.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That\u2019s all I knew about home. My city.",
        "Q: And when you got there, a lot of survivors had come back, yes?",
        "A: Not a lot, but some.",
        "Q: But survivors from other circumstances came, not just from Lodz. Am I correct, or not?",
        "A: Well, first of all, there were the remnants of Jews in Lodz that stayed, you know, because of\nthey were needed to clean up --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- the -- the -- the quarter, and they were coming out of their holes now, you know, openly. So\nthey were there, and they were pre -- in pretty good shape, I have to tell you know, you know?\nThey probably -- they could not stop thanking God for what happened, that they were allowed --\nyou know --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- that their things were so different from others. There were people that coming from the\ncamps, very few. And for a long time, weeks, we sort of saw that that\u2019s it, nobody else survived.",
        "Q: Ah, out of the whole --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- Europe.",
        "A: That -- that that is -- that is all. So we tried to -- to live. We got assigned a apartment, and that\nwas an apartment that Germans were living in and then they evacuated, they -- they went west, to\nGermany. So we had an apartment. We had no job, there were no jobs to be had, we had no\nmoney. The Jewish Committee that was trying to form itself was very weak and inefficient. And\nthere was not much help that they could give us, me, my friend and some others. So life was\nvery, very hard. And what do we do? We wanted to enroll at school, at the university. Lodz did\nnot have a university before the war. It was opening, and they had a medical faculty. So that was\nnot possible to get to that, so I enrolled in natural sciences, and tried to go to school, which was\nvery hard to do, you know, we were not there, mentally. So life was hard and there was a\nquestion how do we survive.",
        "Q: And you were together with your friend.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Wanda -- Vonda?",
        "A: Vonda.",
        "Q: Wanda?",
        "A: Yes. How do we survive? Then there were the opportunities to make sa -- a living, where for\nmen, following, you know, after a war, and the war was not finish really, but Russians were in\nLodz so it was a city occupied. Usually it 1s -- people live from black market, you know,\nexchanging -- exchanging dollars, zlotys and so on. And a big thing was ba -- bringing food stuff\nto the west, to the German border, and exchanging it for other things like linen and so on, and\nthen coming to Poland and se-selling linen for money and living on that. The only thing that\nthere was a different between a -- men and women, men were very comfortable doing it. As a\nwoman you had to be prepared to get raped on the way. That was the -- the law of post-war\nwithout org -- or-order, without police, without anything. You know, you --",
        "Q: Rape w -- rape was common\u2019?",
        "A: Absolutely. You had to count on that. And some women didn\u2019t mind, or got used to that, and\nwe didn't want to do that, so we were like that. Then comes along a friend of Vonda\u2019s, whom she\nknew from ghetto. And she introduced me to him, and that was my future husband. And pe -- ex-\nhusband. And it was a typical story of a woman that cannot support herself, poor thing, so she\nhas to have a man who does. Is not rich, but he came also, you know, from Auschwitz, but he\nwent to his little town close to Lodz, and his parents had a little factory of producing oil from\ngrain. And he started this factory and he was making money. Not much, but enough to be very,\neffusively generous with us, helping us with bread and butter. And from little to little, you know,\nI was caught in that gratefulness. Had sex, and once I had sex, my Mama told me, that\u2019s your\nhusband.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: You marry him.",
        "Q: Period.",
        "A: My mother was dead, but that I imagined what Mother would say.",
        "Q: She never said that to you, but you imagined --",

        "Q: Uh-huh, right.",
        "A: -- when you married.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the Jewish law was when you marry -- when you have sex, you -- you are married, if you\ndidn\u2019t know it.",

        "Q: It\u2019s a good thing.",
        "A: I wish I would be so smart. So yeah, that was a terrible thing, because from the day one, I\ndidn\u2019t think he\u2019s a -- you know, he 1s a partner for me. But I was grateful, that\u2019s true and that\u2019s\nfine. But wi -- I was [indecipherable] myself, feeling obliged by Jewish law to be his partner.",
        "Q: Were you attracted to him?",
        "A: Not really.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But it was a question of loneliness, of no food, of having sex. And I was not a femist --\nfeminist then, free of my mother\u2019s beliefs about sex and marriage go together like a dove and\ncarriage, yes?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. You need to go farther, I guess.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, and leave that, and go on. That what I should have --",
        "Q: What was he like? When you say you -- you knew instinct -- that he really wasn\u2019t going to be\na partner, so was he not an intellectual, was he not a sensitive --",
        "A: Totally unintellectually.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Totally insensitive. Totally -- good heart he had, you know, in part, you know, to help Vonda\nand me, and that was of his good heart. He hel -- opened his house in that little town to some\nrelatives, they were coming also, from everywhere. And feeding them, and giving them sleep,\netcetera, so he was good in that way, and warm. But nothing else. Not a man to -- man to talk\nwith, to discuss things, and y-you know, that\u2019s -- that was a big miss, and I was just poor little\ngirl needing somebody to take care of her. I was not raised for that, but that\u2019s how it felt.",

        "Q: Well, no, I guess --",
        "A: I didn\u2019t. But I did.",
        "Q: But you did, yeah.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t know. Or you didn\u2019t know how not to do it.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know how not to do that.",
        "Q: And I\u2019m sure this is true, this is a very common kind of story, right?",
        "A: Aprow -- yes. It is the sort of morality that enslaved women, that their sexuality is not theirs,\nbut a man\u2019s, and they have no say over it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It\u2019s very hard to get away from it.",
        "Q: Absolutely.",
        "A: We\u2019re still not, as women, out of the woods, to comfortly -- comfortably to distinguish a\nrelationship, sexuality, laws, etcetera. Men have no problem. Men were doing it all the time.",
        "Q: Including during your time.",
        "A: Including during war time.",
        "Q: It\u2019s not a new thing.",
        "A: Not a new thing.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And we have a long way to go.",
        "Q: Yeah. How long did you stay in Poland together? You -- so you -- when did you get married,\n\u201946, \u00b047?",
        "A: \u00b046.",
        "Q: \u00b046.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: So, very soon after you came back.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Are you going to school when you got married? Cause you started school before?",
        "A: No, I enrolled in school before I was married, but then -- what happened then too, as I told\nyou, I intended to stend -- stay in Poland because I thought that\u2019s my country, and you have no\nright to kick me out, German or Pole -- or the Polacks. But what started then, if you don\u2019t know,\npogroms started in Poland, around in small towns, in Lodz Jews were killed. There were famous\nkilling in southern Poland, Kielce, where Jews were killed for nothing. And it was frightful. You\nknow, it was just a second ch-chapter of killing Jews, but now from Polacks, which was not a big\nsurprise. But after that war? So there was a big exodus from Poland by Jews to Germany. Why\nGermany? Because Germany was divided and occupied, you know, by the western powers and\nby Russia. And that was Germany, particularly American occupation that we were aiming for.\nWas a window out of Europe, and that was my resolve. I have enough of that continent, I\u2019m\ngetting out. So that was -- we went to Germany, smuggled, of course, you know, through the\nborder. It was a big exodus, many people left. But in Germany, what happened? The big powers\norganized DP camps, displaced people camps, in which they put Jews, and Jews were in those\ncamps for five, six years, cause nobody wanted to give them a visa, okay? So that was another\neye opener, you know, where you going? So I enrolled in school, the university opened in\nFrankfurt [indecipherable] in medical faculty, and I enrolled, and I could do it because German\ngovernment paid for tuition, it was the beginning of reparations for -- you know, for Jews after\nthe war. It took me five years, I started in Lodz, five years to get my diploma, and the visa cames\nat that time too. So I was ready to go with my M.D. title, to America.",
        "Q: And your husb -- your husband, was he shocked that you were going to medical school? I\nmean, this was not ordinarily in the 40\u2019s to -- for a woman -- maybe it was in Europe, I don\u2019t\nknow. Certainly wasn\u2019t here.",
        "A: In Europe this was much more acceptable.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And in that way I should say I admired him. He let me do what I wanted. He let me work,\nmake money and he took the money and gambled it away. He was a gambler.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Mm-hm. So I was grateful. I could work.",
        "Q: You were gra -- but you couldn\u2019t have your own money.",
        "A: Of course not.",
        "Q: So, you graduated with a medical degree in what? What sort of medical doctor were you at\nthat time, after five years?",
        "A: Medical, general medical.",
        "Q: Just general med-medical degree.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: So then, you came to this country in *51?",
        "A: Right. And hi -- I had a son two years old.",
        "Q: So while you were finishing medical school, you had a son?",
        "A: Right, David.",
        "Q: Wow, that\u2019s a lot.",
        "A: Yes, I always did a lot.",
        "Q: You always did a lot.",
        "A: Don\u2019t you get the feeling?",
        "Q: I get the feeling, yes.",
        "A: Oh, my. I was capable, and I liked doing a lot. You know, I -- I had the energy to do --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and enjoying it, yes.",
        "Q: Yes. And did your husband help? Was he good with David?",
        "A: Yes. [indecipherable]. But I -- I was so grateful to him that he -- you know, most husband\ndidn\u2019t like their wives to work or make money, right?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Stay home, you know, that was the common cry.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And he was different, he let me -- he helped me studying, he took care of David. You know, 1-\nit was So nice.",
        "Q: Well, you were also a way for him to have money so he could gamble, given what you said.",
        "A: Of course, of course.",
        "Q: Yes, hm.",
        "A: He trained me so he can [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Where did you go in the United States when you came here?",
        "A: Cincinnati.",
        "Q: Why Cincinnati?",
        "A: Tell you why. The idea was, when the visa finally came, through the Jewish institution HIAS,\nand you know, then there was a question where do I go. So they assigned you where to go. So\nmy first assignment was Seattle, Washington. You -- you won\u2019t think I am so smart any more\nafter I tell you that story. What do I know about Seattle, Washington?",
        "Q: I have no idea.",
        "A: I had nobody to talk to that knew anything. So I took out the map.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I look, America, Seattle, ocean, Russia. I want you to know, when we left Europe, since\nthe end of the war til we left, we lived in a constant fear that the Russia is going to overrun\nEurope, that they are not finished. So there was always a fear that Russia will overrun. I was\ninfected by that, too, stupidly. So there is Russia, and here is Seattle, a inch on the map.",
        "Q: So you really got afraid?",
        "A: Yes. Three -- we --",
        "Q: It\u2019s too close.",
        "A: Next door.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I said, I don\u2019t want to go there. Would you change, kindly. They changed. Next assignment\ncame, El Paso, Texas. I consult the map again. And I look at the map and I see El Paso. It\u2019s the\nend of the States. Mexico. Cowboy coun -- Texas. It\u2019s cowboy country. And beforehand I told\nthe guys at HIAS, one thing I won\u2019t go to is New York or Chicago.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Right. Cause that\u2019s Al Capone country.",
        "Q: Both is Al Capone country?",
        "A: New York had something else, but you know, those are -- you know, and I don\u2019t want to be\nthere. I just want you to tell -- to know. Before the war, the idea of going to America was a\nhorrible idea for most Jews. Only deserted of Russian army --",
        "Q: Went to --",
        "A: -- would go, or adventurers, or gamblers were going to America.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: A nice girl like I would not go to America. So New York, and Chicago were the biggest\ncenters of that. Well, anyway, El Paso I told them, that\u2019s cowboy country, and I-I don\u2019t know\nabout that. At that time friends of mine were already in Cincinnati, you know, with the same past\nhistory. So we corresponded, and we -- I told them the story, and they said, why don\u2019t you come\nto Cincinnati? I said, how can I come to Cincinnati, I am dependent on HIAS and all that. And\nthey se -- nevermind, they will ship you to -- to New Orleans from -- from Hamburg, and when\nyou are in New Orleans, we will call the leaders there, and they will ship you to Cincinnati. And\nthat\u2019s what happened. We were entering New Orleans, and then we correspond -- I mean, there\nwere telephones and so on, and they put us on a train from New Orleans to Cincinnati.",
        "Q: And did you have a job in a hospital, though?",
        "A: Oh, well, no. We were just --",
        "Q: You were just there.",
        "A: We were just there, in Cincinnati, no job. And he -- he got a job, finally. And you know the\ninstitutions, Jewish institution were helpful in the beginning, supportive, til he was making\nmoney. And that\u2019s how we start our life here.",
        "Q: So when did you start your practice?",
        "A: I had to do my state board.",
        "Q: Right. Did you speak English? I just thought of this.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Of course you didn\u2019t.",
        "A: But I took one year English in school, as an additional foreign language.",
        "Q: When? Way back?",
        "A: In high school, way back. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And that was enough?",
        "A: Then I learned, I worked and I learned.",
        "Q: And the medical terms, of course, are the same. Or --",
        "A: Different language.",
        "Q: Different la --",
        "A: Or the -- the Latin was the same.",
        "Q: Latin\u2019s the same.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But different language.",
        "Q: So when did you pass your boards?",
        "A: I think \u201955. We came in \u201951, I did my internship and residency in -- in medicine. I could not\ntake the board before because they had a problem with recognizing certain schools in Germany\nas worthy of -- you know, to acknowledge the graduation. So it took them few years, and finally\nI got the news that your school is recognized. So I took the state board, and then I was a doctor.",
        "Q: Then you were a doctor?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: We have to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape 10\nBeginning Tape 11",
        "Q: Did you start working as a doctor right after you passed your boards 1n \u201955?",
        "A: I opened my practice in \u201957.",
        "Q: And this was a family pract -- this was a --",
        "A: Family medicine.",
        "Q: Family medicine.",
        "A: Mm-hm, yeah.",
        "Q: So when did you decide to be -- to do psychiatry?",
        "A: I was about, you know, close to 15 years in practice, in family practice. And then I realized\nthat I -- you know, I had a lot -- my practice was mainly women -- women and children, very few\nmen. Family, so the husband would come and so on, but mainly women. And I was taken aback\nby observing how many women suffered from depression, deep depression. And that was a well-\nto-do suburb of Cincinnati, where families were ma -- mainly coming to work with Cincinnati\nwith General Motors, Ford company, PNG. So they were -- the husband were -- had good jobs.\nThe wives were taking care of the house and children, and I would see them in my office, and\nthey would come with all kinds of physical symptoms. And we did the work and nothing\nshowed. So I would have to tell them that I could not find anything else, so I don\u2019t know why\nyou -- why you hurt here and there. And try to sort of enlarge the questioning, what and how. I\nwas doing a lot of house calls, not because I was so generous, but maybe I wanted -- I was used\nto house calls back home. But I wanted to get to know the country I am living in, and that was a\nvery good way to do it, to see people\u2019s homes, and how they lived. So I know the ones -- one\nthing I knew that was very stressful, and that was the big companies were promoting people, but\nyou paid a price for it. The promotion would come and you had to move to another part of the\ncountry. If you get the promotion in Cincinnati, you would be sent to the west coast, and from\nthe west coast you would be sent to Cincinnati. So the family was always in a turmoil, having to\nlive with the idea that every two years you have to move, if you want to move up the ladder. And\nit was the wife that had to put in roots quickly, school, church, neighborhood. I knew that that\nwas a chore, but they were always sen -- saying that they are treated well -- they are treated well.\nThe husband really didn\u2019t move. He was still in the circles of national commerce, or\nproductivity. But the wife had to change totally her surrounding, and make it easy for the\nhusband. So I know -- knew that, but beyond that I didn\u2019t know. And I had friends, they were\neither in training of psychiatry, or psychiatrists, and they told me about it, and what -- and I\ndidn\u2019t know anything about Freudian psychiatry in Germany. We were learning psychiatry, you\nknow, but not about Freud. So, you know, the dynamic psychiatry, it was fresh to me, and it was\nexciting, so I said, I ka -- I have to do it. That\u2019s -- I went into training.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And that was very exciting, and that was good. Listen, I have to tell you part of my story that\nI omitted, and I ashamed of that. But it is very hard. And that -- I told you I had another son,\nright?",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: I was -- when I came to America, I was pregnant -- you know, David was two years old and I\nwas pregnant. And then Charlie was born in \u201951, still the same year we came. And he was a\nlovely child, so I had two children, right, and fine. He developed -- what can I say? He developed\npsychological problems, was in therapy. We did not recognize the depth of his depression.\nEventually he committed suicide. He was 21. So that is a thing I don\u2019t like to talk about. You\nunderstand why. Big pain.",
        "Q: Yeah. Is that also one of the reasons why you d -- wanted to go into psychotherapy?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: It was quite separate.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Course it\u2019s painful, it\u2019s horrible. And David is two years older?",
        "A: Two and a half years older, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Should I ask you something? I don\u2019t -- I --",
        "A: Yes, go ahead.",
        "Q: Did y -- did you understand und -- at any point before he died, how deep the depression was?\nHow -- how -- how much 1n pain he was, or was that too hard to tell?",
        "A: I knew some, but obviously I did not understand how deep it was.",
        "Q: Mm, mm.",
        "A: And how dangerous it was --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- to his life.",
        "Q: Yeah. Did David? His so -- his brother.",
        "A: Neither.",
        "Q: Nobody.",
        "A: No. He was in therapy.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But I don\u2019t think the psychiatrist understood it too.",
        "Q: So it seems as 1f no one could have -- I mean, there were no -- there were not enough signs for\nsomeone -- and it\u2019s not clear that one can do anything --",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- under those circumstances. And why did you say you were ashamed? You were ashamed\nbecause you didn\u2019t say it.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: If -- to -- as if to deny his existence, you know?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Which I don\u2019t want to do --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- but it is too hard to talk about it, so --",
        "Q: And I must admit, I was hesitating to ask you. I knew. I didn\u2019t know this -- I didn\u2019t know any\npart of the story, but I was hesitating. So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s very tough. When were you divorced?",
        "A: \u00b073. Charlie died in \u201973, too.",
        "Q: Sure. Wow. So that was quite a year.",
        "A: You can say that.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know, your life has these arcs of so many difficulties, and so -- and at the same time,\naccomplishments. No?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t treat it as accomplishment. It was work that I had to do.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Work I had to do to survive the war in the ghetto, in Auschwitz. You know, to bear witness,\nwhich I am doing now.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Just to tell the story that it -- it really was.",
        "Q: And when did you start talking about the Holocaust? Did you talk with your sons? I know you\ncouldn\u2019t talk with your husband, he -- he would not speak about any of his experiences.",
        "A: With my sons I talked, but very little.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Facts, giving facts.",
        "Q: But they didn\u2019t know your experience.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Certainly not in details how we talk now. So the silence was horrible.",
        "Q: Did you want to speak?",
        "A: I could not speak.",
        "Q: You couldn\u2019t.",
        "A: I could not speak. I could tell them some, but then I -- I -- I couldn\u2019t go any farther. And\npeople didn\u2019t want to listen --",
        "Q: I was going to ask, yeah.",
        "A: -- including my children.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So that was a sort of silence over the whole experience.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Individually, and as a Jewish experience.",
        "Q: So, the people that you met in Cincinnati didn\u2019t say what happened?",
        "A: There was a group of people, of Jews, that came here at the same time, about the same time,\nwith similar experiences. And I was involved with that group. One was the friend that, you\nknow, asked me to come, you know, from se -- from New Orleans here. Where it was by and\nlarge not a comfortable group, the same way as my relationship with my husband was not\nbecause he was not on my level, and we had very little in common in communicating and talking\nabout things, and -- but that group was the same cut of people. We were celebrating holidays\ntogether, we had parties like, you know, for holidays. The advantage of being part of the group\nwas one. We knew about our experiences, and we didn\u2019t have to talk about it, where we from.\nWe all had the same experience, and 1-it was just being together, and not to have -- to explain\nyourself, or listen to explanation.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But then, at the same time that I was contemplating moving away from my husband, my\nrelationship with that group also broke off. And it was funny and not funny how it did. You see,\nthat group was strictly Polish Jews of tradition and Jewishness, and patriarchy, and the woman is\na woman and I am the man. You know, in Jewish law, a woman cannot divorce a husband. The\nhusband always can divorce the woman, to the degree that if there is not a rabbi, he can tell the\nwoman, I divorce you, I divorce you, I divorce you, and that e-equals divorce, when you tell it to\nthe rabbi. But a woman cannot divorce a man. I didn\u2019t un-understand that for a long time, but\nthen, after I divorced my husband, that wo -- group turned against me, they stopped talking to\nme. And I didn\u2019t understand why til I became c -- became clear to me that I did do the\nunspeakable, I divorced a man. A woman divorced a man. So I was not sorry about breaking off\nthe relationship, but what made me very angry was realized why it happened.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So ts the -- the -- the next -- the next person with whom you actually talk about your\nexperiences Lanzmann? Because that\u2019s in the next couple of years, right? Or is it --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And once you do that, once you give that interview, do you decide, okay, now I don\u2019t have to\ntalk about it again? Or not?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but in the time since my divorce and all that, I was more free to talk with my\nfriends, many of whom were Gentiles, women we got sort of all together with a group of women\nthat we were sort of compatible, and they are all Ge-Gentiles. And I was free to talk with them\nabout it, or even with other -- other Jews. But how it happened really, maybe the impetus was the\ninterview with Lanzmann.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Have you spoken to students, or is this all very private? Or synagogue groups, or\nchurch groups, or --",
        "A: No, no --",
        "Q: No, no public --",
        "A: -- I never wanted to do it.",
        "Q: -- no. You didn\u2019t want to do it.",
        "A: No, no. I did once in a school, you know, in a public school to a group, to a class, talked about\nit, and that was very unsatisfactory. I didn't enjoy it, it was just not my --",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t your cup of tea.",
        "A: Ye -- right. So I didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Do -- have people in the last 10 years, or m-maybe since the Lanzmann film, do they, when\nthey meet you say -- ask you more questions? They don\u2019t?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: I guess I\u2019m surprised at that. In the last 10 years? Not --",
        "A: Be-Because they saw the -- the film?",
        "Q: Because they saw the film, or in the last 10 years, I mean, the Holocaust Museum in\nWashington opened, and then there was \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d and there seems to be more\ndiscussion about survivors, so I thought perhaps there was more discussion with you as well?\nNo.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: But you s -- you said you -- when you were in the ghetto, that you felt you needed to bear\nwitness, yes?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: So how were you going to do that? I mean, how did you, in your own head, think about ho --\nthe Lanzmann was accidental, actually --",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- if you hadn\u2019t gone up to him.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have it formulated either in the ghetto, or -- or in Auschwitz to bear witness. But\nthought was, you have -- you have to live through, you have to survive, be able to talk about the\npa -- because people won\u2019t believe if you don\u2019t talk about it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They won\u2019t believe those stories. So somebody has to tell how it was. And I didn\u2019t have any\nconcrete things to talk or write about it. But just to be alive, and show them you didn\u2019t -- you\nknow, I was not killed, I was --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- almost done away with, but I am alive.",

        "Q: Really?",

        "Q: -- in case Someone made the decision.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Le-Let me ask you a small question. What about your friend, your Catholic friend? The war\ncomes, and Jews are clearly segregated in some very significant way, what happens with that\nfamily and you?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: So you never saw them again, I think? No? No. So you were hard on yourself.",
        "Q: You were hard on yourself, weren\u2019t you?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you -- did you see brutality bef -- before the ghetto, did you see the Nazis on the street, or\nthe Poles, taking Jews and beating them up, did you see that?",
        "Q: You did?",
        "Q: That must have been extremely difficult.",
        "Q: But the brutalization must do something to you, especially as a kid, when you first see it.\nYou\u2019re not -- you\u2019re not used to people being brutal like that, even if you see photographs, right?\nI mean, I don\u2019t know exactly what it does, but 1t must do something, to -- cause violence has a --\na -- I don\u2019t know, is a -- is a -- a level of violation about it that\u2019s so powerful, 1t seems to me,\nespecially for a young person.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Mm. Let me ask you another question. Before the ghetto was actually formed, the head --\nwhat they called the -- the elder of the Jews, it was decided upon, and it was Rumkowsk1.",
        "Q: Had you heard about him before the ghetto, as head of the orphanage? Had you heard\nanything?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: And that was it.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t [indecipherable] right.",

        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "Q: So you believed very early?",
        "Q: And earlier than when death camps are actually in existence?",

        "Q: As a kid?",
        "Q: Not as a kid, after the war.",

        "Q: And it was Baluty, right?",
        "Q: And how do you pronounce that, Baluty?",
        "Q: Baluty. And that was where you went when you were younger, to this cell, it was in that area,\nwhen you went to that Communist discussion.",
        "Q: It\u2019s the same -- same section.",

        "Q: So how did you decide? You\u2019d say four people have x number of square feet, and so this is\navailable, you go here?",
        "Q: Was there corruption in this process?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. But at some level.",

        "Q: Right.",

The industrial trend was coming from the west, so the Germans were a very important\nelement, establishing all kinds of industrial complexes, but the main thing how this textile\nbusiness came to be, is through -- I don\u2019t know th-the name would it be -- for people working at\nthe loom in their own apartments.

That -- that was the basic thing, what built, you know, industry in Lodz. And then of\ncourse, the -- were the big manufacturing things and Germans, it was mostly in German hands,\nbig, you know, big stores, and big commerce, led mostly by Germans and Jews and Poles.

It is a\ncountry that is between Germany, Russia, Austria, the Hapsburgs, the Prussians, and the Norse.\nAnd though there was a part of history, there was the golden age of Poland in Middle Ages,\nwhere Poland was quite potent and -- militarily, and was attacking the neighbors, and also is\nknown for having the first university in Krakow, in Europe. So it was a pretty -- you know,\npretty acknowledged country, but bloody history, you know? Like we had the significant that I\nremember, and there were books written, the Norse 1-invaded, you know, the Swedes, the\nVikings, Middle Ages, invaded Poland and run down the whole country and the beautiful books\nthat the author got a Nobel Prize, part of the flood when the Vikings flooded the whole country.\nAnd the atrocities and interrogation and punishment. The underground places where they kept\nthe people that they -- you know, the invaders, bloody killings and so on. So I was exposed to\nthat really very early, so I knew history very well.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",

He was a printer by -- by trade, so I remember him working this big linotype -- this big,\nmechanical machine came from America, and you know, I saw him working, and I -- I was\nfascinated by that. He also set types, he also wrote editorial. You know, there was -- everybody\ndid something of the same thing.",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- so -- but they worked shifts, so I don\u2019t know how it was lunch. When I was going to\nschool I would take lunch and dinner was always early, two o\u2019clock, three o\u2019clock, that was the\nmain meal. We ate together, so everybody was at the table together.",

There\nwere three -- five children, including my mother. And then they got -- slowly they all got married\nand left home. So they was separate -- cooked separately, so it was a separate household.",

        "A: Yes, mm-hm. And I remember, every summer we went on vacation in the country, you know?\nThat was a habit, a custom, not only for the rich by -- but middle class as well, and maybe lower,\ntoo. You would rent a cheap place, or more expen -- whatever your finances were, in the country,\nwhich would be maybe 50 kilometers, 30 kilometers outside the city, and spend the summertime,\nwhich was a long time, it was two and a half months. School was out. And my father would\ncome for weekends, and we stayed, you know, children, very often there was extended family,\ncousins. So that was a wonderful life. And each summer, after summer, I would come home with\nloads of samples of leaves and -- pressed leaves, ple -- pressed flowers. Preserved salamanders\nand snakes, and -- you know, things like that. My father taught me how to catch snakes and\npreserve them. That was for my classes, you know.",

        "A: And salamanders.",
        "A: And frogs, yes.",
        "A: So I was, you know that -- every summer. That was my -- my doing. And catch butterflies and\nkill them and make shows of different butterflies. It was fun. Very busy summers.",
        "A: Oh yes, I would take them to school, and show off, and [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh, I didn\u2019t look at it like that --",
        "A: -- I was just showing what I did during my summertime.",
        "A: Some were.",
        "A: Yes. And then there were some kids as we got older, got interest very much in the social\nissues, which was a burning question in Poland in those times between wars. You see, to our\nright was Russia, that just became Bolshevik Russia, and that was a big experiment, and we\ncouldn\u2019t stop talking about it. You know, kids. Grown-ups, too, but it was a forbidden thing to\neven think about. Ye -- Communism was forbidden by the Polish reactionary government, and\nother governments, you know, it was a sort of a new things, and so that was all discussed in hush\nwith friends, so I had some friends that were very interested in the question as was I, and I was\nreading to no end, all the, you know, chief writers of Communism, Socialism. And I know that\nwas not against what my father was thinking, but we nev -- it was unspoken because if you were\ncaught and went to -- the thing was that the kids that were then caught in the -- this Communist\nspirit, and infiltration, you know, there was infiltration from Soviet Union by youths, too, and\nyou could hear murmurs, you know, when we were going out of school by Friday, come to the\nmeeting, come to the meeting here and here. And we knew that was Communist meetings, but\nyou didn\u2019t dare to think about it because you could get expelled from school, and kids were\ngetting expelled from getting involved in Communist cells. But the curiosity at that age is so\nstrong, that I could just not -- you know, put it together aside. So we had couple kids that were\non the same wavelengths and we would read and discuss, and discuss, particularly about w-what\nis -- how -- what are the best way to edu -- to bring up children. And you know, part of the\nCommunist agenda was to -- to -- to put a wedge between parents and children and took away ch\n-- take away children, often to -- for separate education and so on. And that was dangerous stuff,\nyou know, at home to talk about. But we talked nevertheless, and what we think, what would be\nbetter, there was endless discussions. And then one time -- this friend of mine that was mostly\nknowledgeable said, look, there is a meeting such and such a day, such and such a place, I have a\nfriend and he wants us to go, a-and participate there. So I said, \u201cYou know, Stephanie, it\u2019s\ndangerous.\u201d \u201cOh, who cares, come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll go.\u201d So we went, and that\nwas the friend that took us there, and it was in the Polish section of town. Actually, 1t was in the\nsection of town that later was turned into the ghetto for Jews. So we were in there on a little,\nsmall, apartment, you know, very high up, and there were people around the table. It was cold, it\nwas winter, 1t was bitter cold. And there was a little iron stove that was giving a little heat, and a\nlot of people, and so we were sitting there. And you know the saying is that poverty s-smells.\nThat was just my experience, the poverty stunk there. It was so poor. People were from the very,\nvery poor population, sitting, and there was this guy, and this guy just came from Russia.\nCommunist, propagandist, and was talking, and everybody was hushed and listening. And he\nwas talking what a great country Soviet Union is, how things are good, how poor people are\ndoing well, how the regime 1s taking care of poor people, etcetera, etcetera, and of course they all\nlistened and loved it. And, okay, so we went -- you know, that was after that, went home and I\nhad all kinds of -- they were really not mixed feelings, I understood very well why this guy\nlooked and was received like a -- as a prophet. You know, smelling the smell of poverty, and the\nposture of those poor people, you know, the babushkas and so on. I said, well they are looking\nfor a prophet. They have it so bad that I am not surprised that they are looking for that. But then I\nsaid, you know, as for -- later on I said, well, it\u2019s not my life. I am not part of it. He da -- you\nknow, he cannot speak to me, he did not speak to me. And that was it for me, you know? The\ncontact with Communism, and the aura of paradise, but I understood that. So that was this\nepisode of my life.",
        "A: 14 year -- 13 - 14. But we were engaged in serious --",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "A: Hm?",

        "A: -- sure.",
        "A: Yes, and I thought Marx was great, and Engels was great. Oh, no question about it. And I had\nthe books and I didn\u2019t have them open, but I knew my parents did see them, and they did not tell\nme don\u2019t read them.",
        "A: In other words, learn everything you can.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. Forbidden. And then another interesting thing. This guy whom -- my friend who brought\nmy friend and me to the cell, Communist cell, was in ghetto later. I had no contact with him,\nnothing close, but I knew who he is. And one day he was arrested in the ghetto for killing his\nmother and keeping her body in his place, and using his -- her ration cards to get bread.",
        "A: Is there a correlation or not? But I say, well, okay. What can you say? You know, that -- that\nwas just something to -- to note about people.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think he was a -- officially a Bundist, but a Bundist\u2019s, you know, perception.",

        "A: Right? And he al -- always was bringing news from the -- from the first sort of thing. And\nthere was always a lot of discussion about anti-Semitism in the government, and what they are\ndoing. And the big discussion was in the Parliament about the Jewish question and the way that\nJews, they killed the animals. You know, for food, what do you call that?",
        "A: Kaszrut -- ritual killing.",
        "A: Right?",
        "A: And if the government wanted to do away with special way Jews were killing their animals.\nYou have no idea how much time was spent on that in the Sejm which was the Congress, and my\nfather knew it from the news coming year in, and year out.",
        "A: Anti-Semitism was just unbelievable.\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: Well, it was considered a regular public school, but it also was clear that the public school\nwas segregated into -- aro -- along the line of sex and relig -- religion. So I was attending a girl\u2019s\nschool for Jewish girls.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We lived in a mixed neighborhood. See, there were Jewish neighborhoods, but we lived in a -\n- a-and some Jews not, but the majority lived in Jewish quarters. But we lived in a mixed\nneighborhood. So my best friend was a Catholic girl next door, which was a Catholic family, a --\nwith five children. And I was the only child, so I was there a lot. One of the girls was my age,\nJadwiga, and we were best friends in both homes. And it was a wonderful friendship. Every year\nI will spend that Christmastime in their home at the Christmas tree, and you know, Santa Claus\ncoming, I was part of it. The only thing I couldn\u2019t do was to eat there, because we -- m -- respect\nKaszrut, y-you know? So --",
        "A: Kosher, yes. So -- mixed kosher, but still kosher enough that I could not eat any non-Jewish\nhome. But other than that, you know, I was part of their home, and it -- 1t was wonderful. They\nwere wonderful people. He -- Mr. Wojkowski worked on the railroad, and he was sort of a\nchunky guy with big whiskers, you know, like that, oh. Lovely man. And his wife was a chunky\nwoman, she cooked, you know, with big pots and so on. So -- I -- I -- I loved being there, a-and it\nwas great. Two things. In their home, on one wall, there was a big portrait of the -- 0-of -- of\nMary, and it was the black Mary of Matka Boska Czestochowska. Matka Boska, mother of God,\nfrom Czestochowa. And that was a holy part where some -- this portrait, this mother of Jesus\nsaved Czestochowa, stopped in Czestochowa, which was a western border city, stopped the\ninflux of the Vikings. Her portrait stopped the Vikings.",
        "A: Imagine?",
        "A: So in very -- homes that respect that, it was her portrait with a red light on top of it that\nburned day and night. And I was so scared of that portrait. I remember that, cause there was a\nsuch a powerful black woman, you know?",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: And it being a Catholic country, you had on holidays, eastern and other, you would have\npeople marching in the street with the holy -- holy pictures, and singing. It was part of life. The\nbad part for -- of that life for Jews was like that. Every Easter before the holiday, there came a\npriest with a bunch of holy water, and he was going -- it was a four story building, from top of\nthe building to the bottom and sprinkle -- sprinkling holy water and saying pray -- prayers. When\nhe was coming, Jewish people had to stay indoors. We could not get out. Okay? That was the\nanti-Semitism from top, right? Also, before Easter there was always, every Easter, there was a\nstory written up in papers, spoken, that the Jews caught a Christian boy, killed him and used his\nblood to bake matzohs. And that day, Jews were beaten up all around the city, just for the sake of\nbeating Jews. So that came with the holidays as well.",
        "A: That\u2019s life.",
        "A: So at home there were alls -- always -- the oy veys, and who next, and who will be beaten,\nwho will be killed, and be careful on the street, stay home, don\u2019t expose yourself and things like\nthat. Between me and Jadwiga, we had -- we were all very curious girls, and all through the year,\nwe would walk on the street and have heavy discussions, mostly about religion.",
        "A: Yes. So the point of it was, whose religion is best?",
        "A: The end result. So we would bring up our arguments.",
        "A: And my argument, it is the oldest religion, look how many years, 5,000 plus years, da da da\nda, we gave the Bible, we got Moses and -- and her was again about Jesus and so on, and so on.\nAnd then we play on the street, that was just part of the routine. And then when she or I would\nrun out of arguments, I don\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t know what to say any more to counter, I said wait a\nminute, I will be back, and run to my mother. And she did the same when she ran out. We would\nrun to our mothers and ask how to continue our discussion, and come back.",
        "A: We had -- it was a discussion.",
        "A: It was really a discussion.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure if she once, I wa -- you know --",
        "A: No.",

        "A: That, you know, knew how to continue our discussion --",
        "A: -- between us without getting hostile.",

        "A: -- they could -- they could have interfered that way.",
        "A: But no, they just gave enough material to keep talking.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no. And then to -- the only son -- you know, that I think there were five girls and one son,\nTadek, Tadeusz, was a nice guy. And Christmas time, of course, I was there, sitting in the circle,\nand then yo -- Santa Claus was coming and giving things and so on, and so I was part of it. And\nthen one time, I probably was six years old, seven maybe, Santa Claus is coming and does the\nsame thing, and I looked at him and I said, who is he? And I say in the moment, \u201cTadek!\u201d And\nthey all broke out laughing, because I -- you know, it was the first time that I --",

        "A: You\u2019re kidding. No.",
        "A: It was forbidden. I tell you that this was so forbidden and such a touchy subject that I didn\u2019t\nknow the real -- realize that til late -- lately. The idea was that I was told -- excuse me -- was\nwhen I pass a church, I should run quickly and be gone. Don\u2019t look, just pass it quickly, and\nthat\u2019s it. I don\u2019t understood -- I -- I don\u2019t think I understood that commandment, you know, not\nto be there.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember why it was lately that I understood that.",
        "A: No, I remembered it all the time. Cause somebody I -- you know, cause a -- a -- in my life\nhere, I was in Catholic church or Protestant ch -- numerous times, on occasion of my friend\u2019s\ndifferent traditions, you know, weddings, birth of a child or something like that.",
        "A: Funerals. But I -- you know, somebody asked me so why -- why was it such a -- such a -- you\nknow, anathema to avoid the church? And I -- I think it came with the realization how much anti-\nSemitism is connected with Christian religion. That it, for the 2,000 years since the death of\nJesus, Jews were accused of killing him, and encouraged by the church to hate Jews and kill\nJews. And it still goes on, til now.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: If not every day, very frequent.",
        "A: Beating Jews was on the agenda. Plus, you know, that news that my father was bringing about\nthe Congress fighting Jews. Now, the ritual killing of animals, you know what that is, 1-1t -- it\ndepends on the humanitarian point to kill the animals in -- animal as quickly and p -- as pain free\nas possible, which means that the guy that is killing, using the knife, is looking for a artery in the\nneck of the animal and cuts the biggest artery, one or two on both sides. So that the death come\nquickest. And the government said no, don\u2019t do that. It is a Jewish -- Jewish thing. We kill it\ndifferently, which is not so humanitarian according to Jewish thinking -- Jewish ritual thinking.",
        "A: So, you know, I heard about -- you know, the -- the war against Jews really, the fight against\nJews from top to bottom. Killing on the street --",
        "A: That was typical.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right. And there was also big discussion about it, what\u2019s happening, what should Poland do --",
        "A: -- with the idea, you know, is what is happening there, and I think the resolution day came for\nis to -- to go to the right and to meet Hitler halfway, sort of be friends with Hitler --",
        "A: -- to avoid what may happen, which they did not avoid anyway.",
        "A: And how. A lot of people got out. You had to have a lot of money, and you had to consider\nrunning away from your life.",
        "A: It became terrifying more and more as -- after 33. The relatives that we had in -- in Germany,\nin the Saar, my father\u2019s mother, my grandmother, and one of the daughters, Erna, who at that\ntime was married and had one child, and couple uncles emigrated to s -- to the Saar, Germany.\nThat was for -- I think that was in 19 -- 19 -- maybe \u201930. That was for economical reasons,\nbecause the depression in Poland was very bitter, and Germany, [indecipherable] and Germany\nhad it better. So for economic reasons they moved. Now, when Hitler came, the question was --\nthey were under Hitler, we were still free. What do they do? What does the family do? So, I think\neven before \u00b039, part of the family m-moved to Palestine, at that time, you know, Israel was not\nexisting --",
        "A: -- but to Palestine. And my father approved of that, you know, get out of Germany. Then, you\nknow, a year or two passed, or so, and they could not establish themselves. Econ -- economy in\nPalestine was horrendous and they could not make it. So they went back to Europe, and my\nfather was so mad. They should have stayed, do you know what\u2019s coming, don\u2019t they see what is\ncoming? They went to France, not to Germany, and lived in France. So that what my father\nthought about, you know, moving --",
        "A: -- but for himself and so on, there was not the urgency, there was not the money and there\nwere Mother\u2019s parents, aged parents that -- Mother was very reluctant to sit -- to separate herself\nfrom. So there were endless discussion, nothing happened. Then we got a -- eventually what\nhappened to the family that went eventually to friends was that my aunt was taken from the street\nof Paris to a death camp. My uncle and the three boys, my cousins, with whom we were\ncorresponding, were lucky enough to escape and stay in Switzerland. Because many were turned\naway, Switzerland was -- was not very kind. And they were interned in a camp for Jews --",
        "A: -- in Switzerland throughout the war. So the positive side was they survived in relative okay\ncondition, the negative that they were treating -- treated like criminals in Switzerland, in camp.\nSo that was this part of the family. Now shortly before \u201939, people were running away on foot to\nRussia as a way to escape Hitler. Many Jews did, and the question was, why don\u2019t we? I was the\none to instigating into -- who was instigating a run. Don\u2019t you see what\u2019s happening? We cannot\nstay here. Run. My mother says, if you want to run, go. It would be okay with me, but I cannot.\nHere are my grand -- my parents, I cannot leave them, so I won\u2019t go. And my father too, there\nwas a reluctance to leave on the simple premise, that\u2019s my home, that\u2019s my country. I don\u2019t want\nto run. Who can force me to run? And I don\u2019t have enough money, and beside they were news\ntoo, that people that invested money in running, to -- making plans to go to South America for\ninstance, we later find out that that was a lie, the offices took money and got -- transferred the\nJews to Gestapo. So there was no firm belief that you can really run, because you may lose\neverything and your life anyway. So that was the decision, to stay.",

There were a lot of Jews from Poland that were in Germany, and they were\nnot citizens. He send them back to Poland. And we were in touch with those Jews, particularly in\nLodz, you know, we knew there was a bunch of young Jews coming, so we got, you know, our\ngroup got in touch with those guys, and they were telling us what\u2019s happening in Germany, and\nabout Hitler\u2019s pra -- plans, and to take it seriously.

        "A: -- you know, sort of down to earth. And that it\u2019s coming, but we didn\u2019t know of course, who.\nThey wanted -- my mother wanted a boy, but -- probably both parents wanted a boy, they had a\ngirl already.",
        "A: But the sister came and here she was, and I had to adjust. It was horrible. And I was so mad\nbecause later on, you know -- my mother didn\u2019t expect me to raise my sister or do much for her,\nreally, she never did. I have to say, she was a wonderful mother. My father had chronic TB, you\nknow, which was endemic in -- in -- in Poland. And so he would get attacks, you know, of some\nbleeding from the lungs. And she never expected me to serve as a nurse or do things. She was --\nthat was her duty, and so on. A-And about my sister, too, that was her child and so on. But then\nwhen my sister was walking, going for a walk, she would ask me sometimes to take her for a\nwalk in the neighborhood. I protested, but I took her. My friends loved her, she was a cute girl. It\nwas pretty horrible.",
        "A: No, I was not happy.",

        "A: It was so -- a-and then with homewo -- I was an excellent student, my sister was not, so my\nmother asked me to -- to help her with homework and so on, and my sister offered me all kinds\nof deals I couldn\u2019t resist. If you help me Ill wash the dishes for you, and things like that. It was\nnot pleasant, you know, really. But she was growing up, and then we sort of parted ways, you\nknow. She had her life and I had my life, til we were sent to Auschwitz.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It changed.\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "A: Mm-hm.",

        "A: Well, you know, before the war, there were all kinds of rumors coming from northern Poland.\nYou know, Gdansk -- y-you know the name of the city, Danzig German, Gdansk, Polish. It was a\n-- avery sore spot between Poland and Germany. Poland in s -- Danzig -- Gdansk and Danzig,\nboth countries thought it belongs to them. Finally, after the first World War, there was this\nagreement that Poland got a little bit of corridor, because Poland wanted some access to the sea,\nBaltic Sea. And if -- 1f Gdansk become Danzig, you know, Poland would have nothing. So they\nagreed to a small corridor that would lead to the Baltic Sea, so that both countries had access,\nand that Gdansk, or Danzig -- Poland will have access to -- to Gdansk to use it as a port. They\nwere building another port, Gdynia, but that was later. Okay, so that was sort of a sore spot\nbetween the two countries, and a sore spot to erupt. The news came that Polish troops crossed\ninto Germany across this small corridor, and germa -- Germany was ready to attack. What turned\nout later that the troops -- Polish troops were Germans dressed in Polish uniforms. So they\nprovoked that, and they attacked. In Lodz what did we do? Well, we knew they are coming, and\nwe developed, you know, sort of on the street, some defense. We will be watching or walking the\nstreets, particularly the youth, and I was part of it, and watching for signs of airplanes coming,\nGerman airplanes at-attacking. So we were watching -- you know, walking around the blocks for\na couple days. And then finally the news came on the radio that the German are on Polish so --\nsoil, and they are coming. So what I remember about that? I was there -- we were there, my\ngrandmother and my mother. I think Father was at work, and my mother burst out crying. And\nshe says, \u201cI won\u2019t make it, not a second time. Lived through the first World War, it was horrible,\nI won\u2019t be able to make it.\u201d And to me it was, my God, if Mother says that, I am doomed as well,\nI cannot take it, I cannot do anything like that without my mommy. So that was it. So we were\nstill marching and watching, and watching and reporting to the elders. Nothing was happening,\nand then all of a sudden we ha -- we heard some bombs falling. But Lodz did not suffer from the\nbombing. It was, you know, here and there [indecipherable] nothing was happening, and one day\nthe troops were marching in. And the Germans were in. And we were still waiting. We were\nating -- waiting, and pretty soon the Germans started to paste orders on the w -- on the street\nwalls, you know, the special walls when you put -- what do you call it when you put news?",
        "A: Posters. About, you know, some orders what not to do, times and so on and be home, etcetera,\netcetera. And was a di -- probably the worst thing then that happened in those moments was that\nPolish -- Polish neighbors, particularly the -- there was a Polish couple that was taking care of\nthe building, you know, sort of administering cleaning and so on. And some others started --\nbegan to go to Jewish neighbors and taking out things, furniture, etcetera, etcetera. Sort of\nunprovoked, nothing, it was the Pole that started the war with the Jews. And I remember I was so\nfurious about it. We had a neighbor, another neighbor who was a middle-aged woman, a\nbusinesswoman, she was a widow, and she and her son were running a little factory, they were\nmaking cardboard boxes. And she spoke perfectly German and so on, and I talked with her and I\nsay, \u201cWhat do we do, Mrs. Kronenburg?\u201d And then I say, \u201cWell, let\u2019s do something.\u201d And she\nsays, \u201cHow about you and me will go to the German quarters and report our neighbors, they are\nrobbing us?\u201d I said okay, and Mother said okay, she didn\u2019t want to go. And that Mrs.\nKronenburg spoke German very well. I spoke German too because German was second language\nin -- in -- in high school, foreign language. So we went to the German commando, very innocent,\nyou know, and we asked to talk to the chief, and we tell him such and such, with disgust, that we\nare being ro-robed -- robbed, and that -- is that legal, is that how it should be? And he says no, it\nshould not be. So he s -- asks an officer to come with us and stop the rob-robbery from our\nneighbors. And the officer came with us and talked to the neighbors that were robbing. Then they\nnot [indecipherable]. So we were very proud of that.",
        "A: Oh my God, the chutzpah that we had, right? I mean, not --",
        "A: -- innocent.",
        "A: Then there came the announcement about Jews, pertaining Jews. All Jews had to wear a star -\n- the stars of davi -- David, and restriction of being on the street, and more and more of that. And\nthen pretty soon, as they settled in, you know, sort of, in Lodz, atrocities started to -- catching\nJews on the street, taking them to the Gestapo for beating, interrogation. Slugging Jews with\nbeards on the street, where mobs were hanging around, and enjoying -- the Polish mobs, and\nenjoying that. That was September, and the announcement of the ghetto, where the ghetto would\nbe, and that by April everybody will have to be there, moved out. School, we did not start, you\nknow, it was September, I supposed to be in high school, you know?",
        "A: 12\u2122 grade. Did not start, it was closed.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",

        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Yes, yes, right. So -- okay, so the atmosphere was totally changed. Fear, unex -- unexpected\ncan be expected any time, beating, arrest, sending here, there, we didn\u2019t know what was going\non. After all, the -- within six days the German army occupied the whole Poland.",
        "A: The total country. And as we were joking but not so happily about the Polish army that had\nbeautiful officers, you know, famous for their sitting on the horses, the officer on the horses in\ncorsets and handsome, and [indecipherable]. And the tanks, the German ca -- tanks, took them\npretty seriously and didn\u2019t -- all that they wanted with themself. No defense, no defense. It was\noccupation, and what can I say, 1-1-1t was -- it sort of was unimagabable -- the unimagable was\nhappening. A-A state of being nowhere, being nothing, and who knows? And nothing good\ncoming.",
        "A: Yes, so, we know that.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: Sure, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Yes, yes. And then it was something like that, and the family -- Mother\u2019s sister lived in\nWarsaw, and Warsaw was still free, and then already we knew that Warsaw will be treated\ndifferently than Lodz. See, the Germans in-incorporated L\u00e9dz into the Reich, they changed the\nmi -- map, and that became part of Germany, and got the name of Litmannstadt. Warsaw was the\nfree territory, 1t was just occupied -- a territory. And we were thinking maybe we should go to\nWarsaw. So the plan was for me and my -- a cousin that lived next door, a little older than\nmyself, that we will go to Warsaw, and bring some stuff there in preparation for the families to\ngo there. Well, so we went, and I didn\u2019t look very Semitic, and neither did she, but we were\nwearing the stars anyway, but we had some babushka, you know, around ourselves, and went to\nWarsaw. Uneventful. We made it back and forth, forth and back. So I saw my -- my aunt there,\nand her son and husband. And they were at limbo just as we were. So I deposited some stuff that,\nyou know, we could use when we come, and -- and that was it, I never saw my aunt again, you\nknow, and I don\u2019t know what happened to her, but she didn\u2019t survive and neither did her husband\nor her son, a little boy at that ttme. And we came back, a-a-and that was that. And pretty soon --\nsoon we were transported into the ghetto.",
        "A: [had no opinion, I didn't know what to do. Ni -- nobody knew.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, in case we would go there --",
        "A: -- to have something there.",
        "A: Very soon after the Germans came, there were many arrests. He was -- Mr. Wojkowski was\narrested one of the first, and killed. Why? He was working for years on the railways. Railroads\nwere the most important thing -- way of transportation in Poland for the Poles, and was to be for\nthe Germans. Though the German had airplanes by that time, it was different. But that was very\nimportant for the Germans, to destroy the railways. So they took all that knowledge --\nknowledgeable workers, and shot them out. And Mr. Wojkowski was killed. And then the family\nmoved out to somewhere, they had relative in the country, so they moved in the count -- you\nknow, to the country.",
        "A: Since we mentioning that, it was after the war, in Lodz, when I was back in Lodz and going\nsomeplace, that from far away I thought and then I knew that I saw one of the sisters, Wojkowsk1\nsisters, not Jadwiga. A-And -- and you cannot imagine what was going in my mind. I did not\nwant to approach her, because I thought, what if she asks me the question about my family. And\nI have to tell her I survived and they didn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t face up to that. So I let it by. That was\n[indecipherable] friends.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: I felt it was all my fault.",
        "A: What didn\u2019t I do? How comes I am here, and have nobody to show up that I supposed to save.\nProtecting my sister. So that what -- what happened.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: We saw those pictures. We heard about those pictures on radio, what\u2019s happening in\nGermany, so we were not surprised, you know.",
        "A: Tell you the truth, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: We knew that was happening. We saw mostly from the far. I was not exposed close by to the\nbrutality like, you know, dragging Jews by the beard, you know, the --",
        "A: -- Orthodox Jews, and beating them. I did not see it from close by, I have to say.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: We knew he was the head of the orphanage, and then he became a member of the Jewish\nCommittee --",
        "A: -- and then he became the Alteste of the ghetto, but I didn\u2019t --",
        "A: -- have any close relationship --",
        "A: -- of people close by to him.",
        "A: I am sure there was talk like that.",
        "A: But it was talk subdued by the feeling what\u2019s happening, the end of the world.",
        "A: We have no power, we -- we -- we are totally dependent now on Hitler and his promise to kill\nus. Tha-That was the essence, he is going to kill us.",

        "A: They formed a department of housing. Jews were in charge of it, and the Jew -- the housing\ndepartment had lists of the streets of the houses and how many square feet were available in each\napartment or room. And they were assigning people, people working in that department were\nassigning customers that came to the -- to that place, square feet, the street number, and the -- the\nhouse -- you know, the street number, and the place they will live. So it was -- and I worked for\nthat department for a few years. And I was, you know, giving people places to live.",

        "A: No.",
        "A: No. Amazingly enough for all that squalor and density of population, the sanitation was pretty\ngood. The -- the reason -- the number one reason was clear, the Germans were very interested\nnot to start an epidemic in the ghetto. Because they -- in the center of the ghetto, they had their\noffices, the German had their offices, and they did not want to be exposed to a th -- epidemic. So\nwhat they did, you know, they had good sanitation department, and the street was smelling --\nstinking with chlor any time of day or night. They were pouring chlor, you know, o-on the street,\non the what do you call. So -- and on the toilets, the outside toilets, chlor, etcetera, and keeping\nthing clean. It was amazing.",

And that\u2019s it. Vegetables would come to the ghetto every few\nweeks. In wintertime they were frozen. So you ate frozen vegetables, a-and that\u2019s it.",
        "A: Hot meals?",
        "A: Well, you cook. You know, my mother was cooking, so she was -- you know, the women\nwere -- that were cooking, the housewives were very ingenious in providing some meals,\ncooking all things possible, like making sardines out of beet leaves. You didn\u2019t taste that, okay.",
        "A: But you roll this, the beet leave --",
        "A: So it looks like a sardine, you saut\u00e9 it a little bit and sprinkle some salt or -- and it\u2019s good.\nWhen you\u2019re very hungry, everything 1s good.",
        "A: And we were very hun -- it was unbelievable hunger. I remember, you know, Mother was\nscolding me once because after a year or two I look in the mirror, and I said, \u201cMother, now I\nlook as I want to look.\u201d I was close to being a skeleton, you know? I said, \u201cMother, isn\u2019t that\nnice? I am so thin.\u201d And for awhile I really thought so.",

        "A: He established a monarchy.",
        "A: Where he was the ruler, and he has a council to help him. He established a school of which he\nwas very proud, rightly so. Right? That was what he was doing. So consequently, I was in that\nschool for a year, and graduated from high school, from that school, right? So that was in his\nfavor. This school consisted of both the per -- teaching personnel and students, of remnants of\npeople that were in the ghetto. Remnants because a lot of people from each school were missing.\nEither they were killed off already, or they were able to run off to Russia, for instance. You\nknow, a good number of people survived living in Russia.",
        "A: So there were sort of remnants of different student in different schools, so that was the new\nschool. And the same went for teachers. And the director of the school was a very acknowledged\nwoman, Mrs. Rhein, R-h-e-1-n, who was a director of one of the high schools, girl\u2019s high schools,\nprivate high schools in Lodz city. And she, you know, directed that school. So consequently, you\nknow, I graduated from high school. And it serves me -- served me right later. It was\nacknowledged by the university in Germany, this high school. Although he developed different,\nwhat we called, resorts. Resorts were really a industrial complex, not a resort like, you know,\nyou go to for a rest.",
        "A: So they had th -- see, I have very mixed feelings about Rumkowski, okay? For once, I hate\nhim, for once I hate the whole Jewish kingdom that he built, which is no question about it. On\nthe other hand, he did something positive. What he did was to bargain with the Germans for life,\nthrough the -- through the whole period of ghetto\u2019s existence. So he told the German and they\nliked to hear that, that we will supply you with workers, and we will gi -- you first -- give you\nfirst class industries that you can use for yourself. For the price that you -- that I ca -- can keep\nthis place alive, I can have living people working for you here. And that\u2019s how it worked out. So\nat different resort, there was ro -- a resort, the industry of -- oh, I don\u2019t know. I -- where I was\nworking in Capol, the first one was we were ma -- a tailor industrial per -- complex, making --\nmaking uniforms and particularly coats for the German army. And that consi -- what we were\nworking at is -- it was called the Gummi Fabrik. You recall probably the coats that German\nsoldier -- they were stiff like a board, right? Broad shoulders, stiff and big things here. What we\nwere do -- the tailors were cutting them, you know, cutting out the part. We -- we were using a\nglue -- special glue to glue those parts together, you know, because they were double, sort of\ndouble.",
        "A: They were glued, yes. So -- for stiffness, and for wearability and so on, we were doing that.\nAfter we graduated, and graduated with -- with big pomp and parade. Of course, it -- the par --\nthe pomp was for Rumkowsk1, that he did it. We were given -- we were given work, you know,\nthen we had to work. Otherwise we had no way of being in the ghetto. People that -- that worked\ncould be in the ghetto. Whoever didn\u2019t work was sent out to another camp, meaning Auschwitz,\nbut we didn't know about that then. So we were given work. So the first place that he send us\ngirls -- the girls, graduating girls, was to this factory of the Gummi coats, which was such a\nhorrendous place.",
        "A: It was run by man tailors of the lowest degree. And for them to get a group of intellectual\ngirls, God, how they treated us. Was terrible.",
        "A: Call us names, pinch us, I don\u2019t know what else he -- they did with some other girls, not with\nme, but the atmosphere was just full of perversion, laughter at us. It was horrible.",
        "A: 1940 we gr -- I graduated.",

        "A: The labor bureau.",
        "A: Mm-hm. No, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Probably months. I don\u2019t know exactly.",
        "A: My father was working. He became -- he got a job of being a -- ad -- administrator of a -- of a\npart of the ghetto, it\u2019s a couple streets. They were assigned different administrator to look after\nthe needs of the -- of the street, the needs of the building, etcetera. So he was doing that.",
        "A: Mother was not working.",
        "A: Mm-hm, yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Meant nothing. Meant nothing, that he was working, otherwise he would be sent out from the\nghetto.",
        "A: And it meant that he got some -- the money was insignificant. But got some rations, you\nknow, maybe a little more of rations cards, though I don\u2019t think so, 1t meant nothing.",
        "A: He was just privilege by being able to work.",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall that.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: It might have been, but I was --",
        "A: -- it didn\u2019t come --",
        "A: -- close to me.",
        "A: .... am sort of wrestling with myself. I would like to share something with you, not about\nmyself, and not myself, but I would not like it to get in the record. Is that possible, or I shut up?",
        "A: Good. But anyway, he was organizing the police, okay, Jewish police.",
        "A: You heard about that.",
        "A: And he also decided to have a troop of women police -- policewomen, okay? And he took the\n-- hi-his beloved high school graduates and sent them to the female police force, okay?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: It was his pride --",
        "A: -- he did something for the future.",
        "A: You know. And he was a social worker at heart, y -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a very mixed bag in that man.",
        "A: So he -- a-and that what happened to me. Few of the girls from the -- from the -- this -- you\nknow, tailor resort, went into the police. And we as police women were given the task to be on\nthe street, and keep the street -- keep the street traffic in order. So we got uniforms, you know,\nand a office.",
        "A: Green jackets with buttons.",
        "A: And green pants, yes.",
        "A: Hat. And then we were in the office. I and another girl were made to be officers, you know, in\ncharge of the troops, and above us was a elderly Czech Jew, who came from Prague. You know\none thing is that to the ghetto, Lodz ghetto, there were sent Jews from all over Europe to be there\nand dispose with them, you know, everyplace else. So there was -- was a wonderful group of\nCzech Jews that came to the ghetto, okay? Mostly young students graduate, and it was such a\nrefreshing -- I worked then at the housing department, so I met with them, you know, a lot,\nbecause they came for housing.",
        "A: And they were so refreshing. I mean, innocent. They didn\u2019t know they are Jews, or nude. You\nknow, it was very -- a mixed culture, Jews and Gentiles. So one of the Prague guys was this\nelderly, handsome guy, you know, old -- pretty old, and he was in charge of [indecipherable] the\nwomen -- just -- 1t was comedy -- with another woman, a Czech woman, I think she was his\nassistant. So we\u2019re sitting in the office and telling stories from Czech -- P-Prague, etcetera,\netcetera. So that la-lasted for awhile, and that was disband, too. Okay, it was not such a innocent\ngroup in such a innocent job. Now, that I am talking freely because it\u2019s about myself, not about a\nfriend. So 1-1t -- other than keeping the traffic going -- not traffic, you know what traffic, there\nwere no Car --",
        "A: -- walking traffic.",
        "A: A-And there was other traffic. There was a lot of sewage people working, you know,\nsanitation, because the toilets had to be -- the outside toilets had to be cleaned regularly because\nof fear of epidemic, so that traffic was going. What else? And the -- the traffic to the cemetery,\nthat was a lot, you know, a lot of people were dying. You know, picked up from the street or\notherwise. Other than that, we were given a order there should not be any trade on the street.\nNow what kind of trade do you think there was? What there was is that people were making\ncandies out of the sugar rations. People were making candies with a taste, and wrapped them,\nand then they were selling it on the street. And their order was that that trade should not exist. So\nwe were supposed to watch for that, and if we -- when we catch a guy that is selling this candy,\nwe were supposed to bring them to the real police, the men police. So that\u2019s what we were doing,\nwe were supposed to do. Now, if the real police catch a guy like that, you know where he was\ngoing.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: So it was one -- one day, I and a friend of mine from the school, my previous school, she was\nper -- patrolling the street and she said -- I was a officer, you see, I was not patrolling. So she\nsays, \u201cPaula, you have to come with me. I want you to come with me and I want to show you\nwhat we are doing, our job.\u201d So, fine, you know, so we walked the street, and then we come to a\nguy that was selling candies, and she says, \u201cWell that what I have to do, and I will do you what --\nI am arresting him and bringing the -- to the police.\u201d Which she did, and we went to the police,\nand she depart. And she says, \u201cDo you know what will happen to the man?\u201d And she says, \u201cDo\nyou know what we are doing here?\u201d We spent all night walking and talking. And could not get a\npeace of mind. So I say, that\u2019s it, no more, I am leaving.",
        "A: The lucky thing was that the pol -- women police was disbanded in a week from that\noccurrence, so we didn\u2019t have to do anything. We were told, no more.",
        "A: No, no, independently.",
        "A: Rumkowski did away with it, for whatever reason I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Not for very long, few months.",
        "A: Separate.",
        "A: We were separate.",
        "A: Yes. That was.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right, mm-hm.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: Oh, horrible. But that what it was. The police was helping Rumkowski keeping order --",
        "A: -- and keeping the deal with the Germans.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The male Jewish police wasn -- no question about that they were fully cooperated with\nRumkowski and therefore with the Germans, and we had no good opinion about them.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: And they were very helpful at the time of getting Jews into the transport going to Auschwitz.\nI tell you, it was horrible, the thought that Jewish police is helping Germans. It was horrible. I\nchanged my mind a bit watching Lanzmann\u2019s movie. You know, when he interviews the\nSonderkommando in Auschwitz, and you saw people that were really on the other side, in\nAuschwitz, helping Germans to kill Jews, frankly to kill Jews.",
        "A: And I got away with a different feeling. How can you blame people that were forced to do the\njob, knowing they are going to be killed in four months, how can you blame them?",
        "A: It was very powerful.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: No, I couldn\u2019t do it.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: And I\u2019m sure other people couldn\u2019t either.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That -- you\u2019re right. And in Auschwitz, you know, the Sonderkommando that\ndid work, you know, the gas chambers and the crematoria, some were just picked and forced to\ndo it.",
        "A: They had no way out other than go --",
        "A: -- right away.",
        "A: There would be a revolution, and maybe successful.",

        "A: Excuse me.",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Finish later.\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "A: That was part of Rumkowsk1\u2019s plan. As you know, he was a social worker and director of an\norphanage before the war. He also was a great Zionist. And at the -- at the time when the school\nopened, he gave us a proposition that whoever would volunteer can go to this place that was part\nof the ghetto, but 1t was sort of more rural, and it was a old house that used to be a orphanage.\nNot his orphanage, but the Polish population. And that we would, boys and girls go there and\nlearn farming in preparation for the -- to go into Palestine and become kibbutznik farmers. So,\nyou know, we needed to have the permission of our parents, and then a group of us went there.\nAnd we spent a full year there. And it was a wonderful time, a time that permit us who were\nwilling to be there, to forget where we were. It was out of this world, really. It was a huge house,\na orphanage, you know, so there was big halls. And our group was probably not more than 20\nboys and girls. Boys separate, girls separate bedrooms, etcetera. And in the morning we would\ngo to school. We would go by -- by carriages, you know, we had some people that were bringing\nu -- by horse and buggy, big buggy, to school, and then afternoon we would come to the farm.\nWe call it Hak\u2019shara, which is Hebrew for farm. And it has the Zionist implication, but we\ncouldn\u2019t give a damn about -- at that time about the implication of Palestine, 1t was just a lovely\nplace. It was a farm that used to be used -- you know, it was used by Poles as a farm, and also\nhad animals. It had goats, and chickens, etcetera. And there was one guy, he was a German Jew\nwho was a farmer, and knew about, you know, farming, and other than going to school,\nhomework, etcetera, he would teach us what to do. In other word, we would sow seeds, and all\nkinds of thing, and take care of the growing crop. There was a orchard, and there were the\nanimals. The animals we would -- let\u2019s see, there were some cows, and there were some goats,\nand we would learn how to milk them. And then distru -- distribute the milk by buggies, and --\nhorse and buggies to cooperative, to stores, you know, run by the -- by Rumkowski that will be\nselling it to the population on carts and so on. So it was a ideal love -- life, really. Very\ngratifying. Of course, we paired up, boys and girls, and so were some romances going and that\nwas, under the circumstances, unheard of. We -- of course, were properly chaperoned by mothers\nthat would take turn and come for overnight to be with -- with the -- you know, with us, to make\nsure nothing was happening. So that was the --",
        "A: I think, in a way, yes. So that was the time, and it was a lot of camaraderie, and there\u2019s sa --\nwere some evening that we had music, some of the people play [indecipherable] particularly\nplayed the piano, and there was a piano. So we had music, and we were dancing. You know, so\nwe were cooking [indecipherable] for the crew, you know. So we would take turns for 24 hours\nto prepare meals, a boy and a girl, cou -- you know, prepare breakfast, lunch, dinner, and\netcetera. So it was a unbelievable year.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Somebody who I met in this group.",
        "A: Yes, mm-hm.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That\u2019s right [indecipherable] said before high school. And then, when we graduate from high\nschool, what happened? O-Of course, the farm disbanded, why did it disband? Times got tougher\npolitically. I think Rumkowski did not have any more ji -- way of thinking and doing to\nsupervise or insist, or we simply -- that what happened, it was disband and we were given jobs.",
        "A: We were needed to work. We had to stop and we are needed to -- to work for the Germans.",
        "A: You know we --",
        "A: -- we -- we were needed to pay off.",
        "A: Right, yes. There was another class after us, so two classes graduated.",
        "A: They\u2019re -- the --",
        "A: They didn\u2019t come to the farm.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember why, or the times already toughened and, you know, there was no -- no time\nfor frivolities, so to speak.",
        "A: So we were the only group that did it, that had this privilege, really. Oh f --",
        "A: -- yes?",
        "A: Actually, I never went back to live with my parent again. I was emancipated. Oh, there was\nanother job immediately after, that was -- so many jobs in such a short time, so it --",
        "A: -- sort of get mixed up. Hm?",
        "A: Yes. One job was making, you know, in -- in a production of houses, what you call houses\nthat you build part -- parts for it.",
        "A: Prefabr -- prefabricated homes for export to Germany, okay? So some of us went to work on\nthat, and we got housing there, also outside, you know, the main part of the ghetto. And we -- we\nwere living there totally, and working. So that was -- lasted for awhile, and that was finished.\nNow, we were doing the -- the prevat -- prefabricated parts with cement, mixing cement, pouring\nit into forms, taking out -- you know, we learned the whole production of how do you do -- how\nyou do it. And that ended. But another job that I had was working in a kitchen, and that was the\nbest job. An-And really ended badly. There was a occasion to go to work for a kitchen that was\nestablished -- kitchen restaurant, so to speak, establish by Rumkowski that was producing\ndinners one -- once a day dinners for people that work in different kind of industries and were\ngiven a bonus to come to this -- to this kitchen for a dinner, for a week or two weeks or so. It was\na extra sort of a pay-off for good work and so on. And working in that kitchen, of course it was\nwonderful, because you could eat, okay? You didn\u2019t have to be hungry, right? So -- and it was\nnice, there was a nice by -- bunch of girls, familiar also from the school, and it was nice to work\nthere. We made hamburgers, we do this, we chopped up all kind that was needed 1n the kitchen,\nunder the supervise -- supervision of women cooks. And then what happened was that there was\na Sonderkommando older guy, you know, that I and he knew each other, I don\u2019t remember from\nwhere, but there were no hard feelings bet -- between us, there was some hostility. I don\u2019t know\nwhat -- what was the cause, but at any rate, he was on duty one day, and I went -- supposedly I\nwas asking the cook that was serving the soup -- I was serving -- you know, the guy that -- the\nCzech that was supervising the women police, and he was there e -- as a client, and I suppose\nthat he asked the server to give me a little more in the plate of soup, because I wanted to, you\nknow. And this Kohn, Kohn was his name, caught me doing that, and therefore did saw that I\nwas kicked out from the kitchen, from my good job. Himself was a -- a s-son of a gun, you\nknow, terrible guy to get to be accused of anything. And -- an-and -- and that was it, so that job\nended, and I was sent, as a punishment, I was sent to a -- to a resort, a -- a factory that was\nmaking stuff out of wood. That means they were making wooden chairs, wooden wagons, you\nknow, wheels, wooden wheels. It was a huge factory, under one roof, you know, just huge, full\nof machineries that produced a lot of dust when you worked them. So that was my punishment. I\nwas sent to Siberia, and I was there for about a year or so. It was a tough year, really. Hard work,\na lot of dust, and I was punished, you know, that was punishment. So what can I say.",
        "A: No. At this time I think I went back --",
        "A: -- home, cause there was no place to -- to be. So -- but I found a very nice friend there,\nworking around the young people and we chummed together. And so from the social point of\nview, it was nice.",
        "A: Except that it was a dirty job.",
        "A: I think it was before, probably.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Mm-hm. So -- a-and you know, my encounter with this Sonderpoliceman was as we were the\nlast day in the ghetto, as we were transported to Auschwitz, you know, before -- before being\n[indecipherable] to the -- you know, to the wagons, y-you know, that take us. And there was I\nand this policeman, and I looked at him and I didn\u2019t say a word, just thinking, you scoundrel.\nHere you are and here I am.",
        "A: Common ending --",
        "A: -- of the story. So that was part of my life.",

        "A: No. We shall overcome. And, you know, listening to the ri -- radio --",
        "A: -- and of course we had to give up when the German came, first among their rules was all\nradios you bring to this place in Lodz, and sewing machines and all machinery, guns of course,\nyou know, etcet -- etcetera. So if you were caught listening to -- to the radio, you could be\ndeported.",
        "A: But I want -- I wanted to say you can get killed, but deported was --",
        "A: -- equals death.",
        "A: So -- so no radio, no listening to the radio. So we didn\u2019t know, but somehow some rumors\nwere crossing, some people were listening to the radio. You know, they dared and they were\nlistening to it. And I think my father had some connection with somebody that got the news. So\nwe knew broadly what was happening, and we knew where the Germans were, you know, the\ntrip to Siberia, and Stalingrad. And also what we knew that at that time he had all Europe under\nhis hand, right? And -- and fighting England and bombing London, and so on. So we knew what\nwas th -- and some of the news were brought by people that were deported from Paris and\nVienna, and yi -- all your Holland, Dutch people, Czech -- Czech people, they were bringing\nnews because they still knew what was going on, closer than we did. So we knew that he has by\nnow all Europe under -- under his foot, and that there\u2019s little hope really, of very -- very m --\nvery changes that could happen in immediate future. So you just had to take a -- a long view to\nthe future, we shall overcome, in spite of everything that is happening. So you have to be strong.\nAnd one thing that became very important in every day life was how you live with almost\nnothing. That the ration that you got from the bakery, that piece of bread that you got per person,\nand you are in charge of it, it has to last you all week. Don\u2019t eat it in one setting. Because people\nthat did, died. People that didn\u2019t lost weight, and died too, some that could not go on and got\nsome infection and so on. So how do you do that? Families that could do that, and my mother\nwas the leader of it, we did it under her supervision. We stemmed the hunger and take very --\ntook very little, could survive and hope for later. Many people could not, and died just because\nthey could not do it.",

Now, I know about his life something else.\nHe got married in -- in the ghetto, you know, and his wife lived in the house -- same house that\nwe lived. And he was -- she was a lawyer, so-called a old maid, you know? I don\u2019t know if she\nwas 30 or 31 or 29, but she was all -- already old. You know, according. And he married her, so I\nsaw him come, you know, to the house, walking into the house and that -- few times, and that\u2019s\nit. Then when they were married, I suppose she lived with him not -- not in that house where I\nlived. So why he got married, I don\u2019t know, but who\u2019s to say?",

And we knew that it cannot be any good news, so you know, that\nwas in the air. And he gave a speech. He was a good speaker, you know, telling how much he\ncares, telling how much work he puts in -- into survival, and do the best for the population, and\nwe should believe him and trust him. And in that vein, he wants to tell us that it 1s up to us to\nprevent any big loss of population, the Germans gave him a number of children between the ages\n-- I don\u2019t remember, young children, but not too young, you know, the -- they -- the Germans\nwill bring those children to a special care -- camp, that they will get a very good care, better than\nin the ghetto, that he can assure us will happen, and that will allow the ghetto to survive til war is\nended. So please, mothers, go home, prepare the children. Give them, you know, prepare\nsomething, clothing, some dishes to eat from. And it was not the dep -- you know, the collection,\nsuch and such day. That was it. And there was, of course, a lot of crying and screaming, and the\npeople dispersed. It was paralyzing, you know, paralyzing fear and anger. But what bothers --\nbothered me worst, as we ma -- were making our way home, I don\u2019t know if wha -- my mother\ncame or not, I know I was, and I was by myself, so I don\u2019t remember. What bothered me most 1s\nI was walking back home and some neighbors wi -- with me were walking too, how quickly\nthose women adjusted to that idea. I -- I couldn't understand that.

        "A: It -- so he was calculating how to make the best deal against that possibility. I think he was\nsincere about it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: No, no. Is there -- is there --",
        "A: On what, on paper?",
        "A: Mm-hm. Mm, I would be interested in hearing it.",
        "A: Yes, okay.",
        "A: Oh yes. I believe that.",
        "A: I -- yes.",
        "A: He was a politician, and traded in human life.",
        "A: And from the point of view as I told you when -- last August I saw this fairly large number of\nsurvivors of the ge -- lo -- ghetto Lodz, I said, that is because of Rumkowsk1. Not that I love him,\nor admire him.",
        "A: But that\u2019s a fact.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That\u2019s what I think. And the death of the president in Warsaw ghetto didn\u2019t produce anything\nbut a loss of one human life.",
        "A: Czerniakow.",
        "A: Yes. That doesn\u2019t say that I would not, given m-myself and that choice, I probably would kill\nmyself rather than stand like Rumkowski, saying that. But in judging, what is more pr -- I want\nto say productive -- of what is more -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t find a word for it.",
        "A: I -- I -- I cannot hate Rumkowski for it. You know I have some respect for him for that. And\nfor his pain, as he was saying.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Oh -- oh, you -- oh, the story that I told.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Ire -- since 1939 and before, listening to Hitler did not think that he is talking kwotch.",
        "A: And that the \u201cMein Kampf\u201d book is just a book of a sick mind. We took him very seriously,\nand I know we were listening to the radio for hours. The -- his speeches were transmitted live as\nit was happening in Berlin or wherever, so we had a chance to listen to the radio, and sort of\njudging the speeches, and my father, my mother, myself, we knew he is speaking the truth, and\nthat we have nothing to hope for if he 1s a-allowed to bring his plan forth. That is France,\nEngland -- we didn't talk about America, that was sort of, you know, outside of Europe. Unless\nthey come and stop him, he will bring it to fruition, kill us. How, what, when, that was unknown,\nbut we -- this projection we had way back.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It was not in the film?",
        "A: He didn\u2019t put it in the film?",
        "A: Hm.",
        "A: Okay, yes --",
        "A: -- yes.",
        "A: I know. That -- that\u2019s right, I forget.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right --",
        "A: -- yes, in 20\u2019s. And I know that I work then -- then I worked in the housing department, and\nshe came from the line, you know, she is from a little town, she named the town, you know,\nclose to Lodz. And she says 1s -- she is with the daughter so she needs housing for herself and the\ndaughter. Her husband was the Alteste of the -- of the -- the small Jewish community. He was\ntaken away and killed with others, and she is here. And in my heart was going out to her, she was\n-- so [ -- there was a room in my -- in the house that I was living, so I told her to go there and see,\nand if it is okay, she can move in. And then I started to contact with her and we -- we became\ngood friends and talked, you know, a lot. And she was telling me about the life there, and th --\nand you know that in the end, 1-1t w-was just killed off then -- you know, and she is sent here,\netcetera. So, it was nice to have -- she was a very warm, smart woman, and a cute kid, nine years\nold, a little girl. And then it came, you know, the speech of Rumkowsk1, and she said never. You\nknow, I will never give up my child. So we still had few days to talk about it, so we talked at\nlength, and I said, \u201cMy God, what are you going to do?\u201d So she said, \u201cNever will I give up\nvoluntarily my daughter.\u201d And I agreed with her, you know, I -- I was not quarreling. And then\nthe day came of our street being run, you know, with SS troops, and coming, and they ask all\npopulation of a given building to go in the backyard and line up. And two, three SS guys with,\nyou know, bayonets came into the yard. I was standing close to my fre -- I forget her name --\nclose to my friend. And they said -- announced, all children of this and this age, please come.\nAnd she was holding the girl\u2019s hand tightly. And, you know, she was not budging. Other kids\ncame forth. And then the SS guy comes to her and says, bring -- takes the girl\u2019s hand and wants\nto pull her away, and she said no. And he said in German, \u201cIf you don\u2019t let go, I will shoot you.\u201d\nAnd she says, \u201cOkay, shoot me.\u201d So he takes her by the neck, turns her around, and puts the\nrevolver to her neck and shoots. And she falls to my feet, on my feet. And I hardly could stand.\nAnd he took the girl.",
        "A: You see?",
        "A: Rumkowsk1\u2019s philosophy a-and the reality, and how can you say anything, just don\u2019t ask me\nany questions about it, cause there are no answers. For three days I could not talk and could not\neat, and my mother started to worry about me. And then there was no choice but to live.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But she was not going to agree.",
        "A: Give her life first before agreeing. I can understand that. Over my dead body, it says.",
        "A: Literally.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Unless by some fluke she could escape or something.",
        "A: Oh no, you could see many dead people on the streets of the ghetto.",
        "A: Yeah -- ye -- my grandmother died in the ghetto. My -- my uncle died in the ghetto.",
        "A: So I went to the funerals of my family.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes, somehow I revived.",
        "A: Mm-hm",
        "A: It was not clear, but it was clear.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: How did we -- there were people that came to the ghetto, some people that lived in the ghetto\nin Lodz, and were deported, and somehow run away and came, you know, sort of on the black --\nblack side --",
        "A: -- to the ghetto, and they brought news. One first news was about Chelmno. You -- y-you --\nyou know the name.",
        "A: That was -- that was a small time -- town, not far from the city, and that is where the first\nexperiment with gas were done in buses. So those guys that escaped, escaped that, but they were\nwitness to what\u2019s going on, and escape. So we knew about the gassing, etcetera. Then there were\nother news, also from peop -- you know, we got a lot of mail from people that were deported,\nthat they are in camp like that, and everything is fi -- you know, that was all hoax. But some\npeople came, and they brought news from Auschwitz, and that we could not believe, that there\nwere factories to gas people and burn their bodies, crematoria. We could not believe, but they\nwere circulate -- those news were circulating.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. I -- are -- or -- impossible. And it -- but those were people they were talking\nabout, so it was sort of, we don\u2019t want to believe that, but --",
        "A: -- hey, you have to pay attention.",
        "A: So there were news like that of what\u2019s happening in the world.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I think so.",
        "A: Through my s -- head 1s I ca -- I -- I cannot tell her anything concrete that I know, any facts\n[indecipherable] he told me so, but I know there was.",
        "A: Part of the cor -- not corruption but sort of tangentially, wer -- my experience was following.\nMy father was working, I was working, my sister was 1n school for a couple of years and then\nshe got some job to work. My mother was not working. And we began to worry about it because\nshe could be the next deported person. So the question was how do we get -- we need to get her a\njob. Who will get her a job? My father could not hit right. And then was the -- also the peculiar\nsituation in ghetto of reversed roles. You know, the people -- kids like myself that were coming\nof age in the ghetto, but they were children in school, but by the time it was going on, they were\n17 - 18. There was the support of the -- of the ghetto. That on them leaned the economy of life in\nthe ghetto. Those were the people with strength, that could work and buy time for Rumkowski\nfrom the Germans. So all of the sudden I became very important in the group -- in the populati --\nin the, you know, population. And influential. So my father said, \u201cWell you have to do\nsomething.\u201d But what can I do? We have to do something. At this time I was working 1n this\nhousing department which had couple bosses, one older man, and his assistant -- I forget their\nnames, Wolf -- one was Wolfe, the young one was Wolfe, and the older I don\u2019t remember. And\nthe -- you know, older guy and his assistant was the younger guy, and they -- you know, we had\nvery good relationship, they respected me, I respected them, 1-it was nice. So I said, I have to go\nto both of them and ask if they can find a job for Mother. It was a dangerous step, because you\nhad to pay. And what does a young girl pay? How does a young girl pay? Sex, right? So that was\nwritten in big letters. Am I willing to pay that for my mother getting a job? I had to count on that,\nwhen I go to one or the other. That\u2019s how Rumkowski comes in that category, too. When people\ncame, women, particularly young women came to him with begging for some favor, like for a\nsick person to get some medicine, or what n -- extraordinary thing, they had to pay. So I said,\nwhat do I do? And I cannot talk to Father about that. So I said, well, God help me, and I go to\nboth of them. But to one, the older one, he was a chief, and tell him such and such, and I need a\njob for Mother, to keep her alive. What can I tell you my surprise that he didn\u2019t ask for a prize,\nand he got Mother a job in a kitchen in some resort, you know, in some factory. And Mother\nstarted to work. I was surprised, but pleasantly, you know?",
        "A: So that was a one thing. The other thing was Mother worked in that factory, the director was\nMrs. Sandberg, who was the father of my classmate in grade school, and we knew each other -- I\nforgot her name, first name, but not closely, but she -- she was a nice kid and I think she thought\nme, too. I knew her parents from all kinds of affairs for kids. Her father had a horrible opinion,\nyou know, as a explorator, as a bad guy, as nobody to talk to, y -- just -- that was the opinion of\nMrs. -- about Mr. Sandberg. Her mother was a nice lady. Mother was very happy working there.\nI told you my mother s -- wished to work --",
        "A: -- and she could not. She got a job. And was she happy. She really was happy. She was going\nin the morning, she worked in the kitchen, peeling potatoes, all kinds of stuff, but being among a\nbunch of women -- my mother was an excellent talker, you know, and communi -- you know,\nsort of with people, she was a -- enjoyed it and was liked, and she would come back with stories.\nAnd I said, \u201cMother, I never saw you so happy.\u201d And also, in the kitchen, we -- they were\nallowed some stealing. They could take some -- first of all, they were allowed to do is to bring\nhome potato peels. Something that you throw out.",
        "A: Potato peels.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: That was delicious food. Mother would cook a kugel from potato peels.",
        "A: Yes, and all kind of things. So it was food for the family. And she smuggled few potatoes\nwith it, so we had few potatoes. So she was double happy for herself and that she could bring\nsomething home from the job. Make me very happy, you know, it was just nice to see that\nwoman, under those conditions really thriving. Then one day comes the order through Mr.\nSandberg, as it was coming to all directors of the factories, to supply by that date, that many\nworkers of his to send out to -- for relocation. It was called relocation, to another ghetto. Right?\nSo Mother is in danger, and in serious danger. And what do I do? Mother says, go and talk to Mr.\nSandberg.",
        "A: I may be sent out. Oh. I was beside myself. I didn\u2019t want to go. He\u2019s a mean -- I say, \u201cMother,\nhe is a mean man, I may make it worse.\u201d And she says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, just go and talk to him.\u201d I\nwalked the streets around my house half of the night, what do I do, what do I do? So I did -- first\nof all I went to talk to Mrs. Sandberg, the wife. And she knew me, you know, I was a classmate\nof her daughter, and I said, look, such and such, I don\u2019t know what to ask you for, but please\nunderstand where we are. She didn\u2019t say anything, yes, no, whatever, nothing. And then I made\nan appointment to see Mr. Sandberg, and I did see him, and he was nice enough. Not nice really,\nbut polite enough. And I begged him for my mother\u2019s life. Well, he didn\u2019t put her on the list. But\nyou asked me what were the fi -- feeling, living like that. You see this horror of those feelings?\nAnd horror of ever -- of being forced, not by my parents, by what\u2019s going on, to do something\nthat you may think that you contribute to your mother\u2019s death one way or another. Could have\nhappened very easily.",
        "A: He could have said, I have no choice. What would you do in my place?",
        "A: Things like that. But that worked out that way. How does it leave you internally? Certainly\nnot with a feeling of power. A feeling of rage, of anger, that you cannot get riv -- rid of through\nyour lifetime.",
        "A: That\u2019s true, but I didn\u2019t think that far.",
        "A: Mm-mm. But of course somebody -- you know, there was --",
        "A: -- yes. He had to -- he had to produce the number of people --",
        "A: -- the Germans wanted. Rumkowski and the Germans wanted.",
        "A: No.\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "A: Yes, mm-hm.",
        "A: No, personally, I was afraid of that because we knew -- knew stories -- of the stories where\nyoung women would go asking for a favor, including Rumkowsk1, and they had -- you know,\nthey were sexually assaulted, and they had to submit if they wanted this vital -- begging to take --\nyou know, to be gratified. Had to do with saving a life of a mother, a sister, etcetera. So in that\nway there was corruption of the people that had positions, they had the power to demand pay-\noffs, and in a sexual way from -- from women. That what I meant [indecipherable] what I said.",
        "A: Oh, we heard about it --",
        "A: -- yes.",
        "A: There were circulating stories that women were telling about, and warning other people.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know enough about it to really speak of it.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure there were.",
        "A: There was a anger that you probably could not admit even to yourself, knowing the situation.\nNo, anger with my father that he told me you have to find a job, of course I was angry, but I had\nto keep it in, most of it, because -- because he was right. It was this role reversal in the ghetto\nthat the young people were made to take over, make decisions, give yi -- e-etcetera. They were\nalso the people that the life of the ghetto depend on, because they had the strength to work, and\nthe older generation was sort of losing this physical strength of working the factories.",
        "A: Yes. They were given the role, not that they asked for, but by the exhaustion of the older\ngeneration of their strength by doing that work for a year or two under conditions of hunger,\nlosing weight, illnesses, the younger were coming up, they had the strength to work. So they\ncould not complain, but they were angry for sure.",
        "A: I was, sure.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, I didn\u2019t ask for it, and -- and it was a burden of saving the life of your mother.\nYou know, that\u2019s not small potatoes.",
        "A: Look, when we went into the war, and into the ghetto, the structure of society was not\ndissimilar in th-the structure of my family. The men worked, the women kept house.",
        "A: So, in the ghetto too, the primary role of men was to get a job and bring the bacon, maybe\nsalami, right? But there was no salami either.",
        "A: Right? It was only because -- and of course there were some jobs that women from the\nbeginning, like the sewing job, you know --",
        "A: -- they sew -- I mean what -- they making -- were making clothing --",
        "A: -- clothing, so they were sewing machine, and for those job women were hired, and women\ndid that before the war, too. So some of those jobs were -- you know, sort of women were\nworking, young women, older women, but the majority job was men\u2019s job.",
        "A: Not necessarily, becau -- because women started to -- to work.",
        "A: They got jobs, and they started to work. And -- in bigger numbers.",
        "A: There was a hat factory, they were making hats. There was the sewing factory, the women\nwere -- were working and making all kinds of apparels. So, you know, those were jobs that\nwomen could easy fit in.",
        "A: Kitchen work, women were doing that.",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Men were -- I mean, it was their experience from before the war, where men were employed,\nand gain, as a group of men, experience and know-how and in different jobs -- of course, in the\nghetto men got that differentiation too.",
        "A: They were more fit for jobs, women were not prepared, they were not trained, much more so\nthan nowadays, where women are everywhere. But years ago, that was a more patriarchal\nsociety, like in my family, the men worked, the women stayed home.",
        "A: Was the housekeeper. So that was a big minus for women. They had to change --",
        "A: -- under conditions.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: Well, I think I was pretty much conscious of what\u2019s going on, and in talking with Father and\nMother, you know, we were not suppressed of not thinking, and go on.",
        "A: But you -- you had to, foremost -- I told you, we shall overcome. I was not conscious of that\nsentence then, but the philosophy was, go on, survive and tell the story. Which --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: They did not survive. They got sick and died.",
        "A: I was raised that way. Don\u2019t ask me --",
        "A: Well ask me, you know, I\u2019m just telling you it\u2019s --",
        "A: -- very hard to -- to answer that question. I was raised that way on one hand with tremendous\nlove and care, and a certain discipline. And one example of that is like that. I remember -- I told\nyou we lived with my grandparents, entrance, a little hall, kitchen, bathroom, you go in a big\ndining room, old fashioned, with old fashioned furniture, you know, the carved furniture. My\ngrandparent\u2019s bedroom, and then the last room was a very huge room, that was our family room.\nIt was a dining room and a bedroom at the same time, a children -- everything, but a big room, a\nhuge table in the middle, oval table, and a lamp, a ceiling lamp from the ceiling and I remember\nit had a green -- light green silk -- what do you call this outside of the lamp?",
        "A: Lampshade, and lights in the middle. And that was the place where everything was taking\nplace. We would eat there, I would make homework. And homework my father was involved for\na number of years with me, doing every day homework. And I would work with my father, he\nwas a pai -- he painted well, he drew well, and he showed me how, and all that. And I remember\none scene, I was sitting with my father, and he was watching me drawing, and watching. And I\nremember I drew a bunch of lilac. Blue lilac. So that was a little branch with blue lilac and\nleaves. And I was very busy drawing that, my father on this side. And I looked up, and there\u2019s\nmy mother standing beside me, and shaking her head to what my father saying, she\u2019s doing very\nwell, you know, without saying. And I looked, and I was so happy, because my mother was not\none to gr -- congratulate me or tell me you\u2019re doing well, never, okay? I was doing, it was my\njob, whatever, and that\u2019s it. It was the only time that I saw she really cares. And she approves of\nthe work that my father is doing with me. And that memory survived untouched for all those\nyears.",
        "A: I think so.",
        "A: I think so. Approval and strength. Silent approval, not approval gushing you\u2019re great and so\non, to blow up my head, but approval. And you know, a message.",
        "A: I don\u2019t have to tell you that. The -- only one time you can see that, but you know. You should\nknow.",
        "A: Oh yes. It was another memory. I told you, I could always jump in her lap and she would hold\nme --",
        "A: --and caress me, and so on. And then too, there was a time -- you know, the -- really, my\nparents had it good, she was a built-in babysitter, right?",
        "A: You know.",
        "A: She was not going out mu-much. So I stayed and they would go out, and they would go out to\nsee the concert and so on. Later they, when I grew up more, they were taking me Jewish theater\nand other theater, so I was -- and I got to know the writers and actors because I would come\noften with my father to the administration, to the newspaper room, and there were always some\nactors and writers bringing book -- you know, eager to be, you know, put into the press. And I\nwould shake hands, three years, four years old, with the biggest Jewish actors in town, that\nwould come for shows and so on. It was wonderful, you know? So this night they were going to\ntheater, and I stayed home and I got sick. As a kid I would get often sick with croup, you know,\nthis bad cough?",
        "A: Croupy cough. And I was coughing and coughing and crying, Mama, Mama. My\ngrandmother got scared and she called the ambulance, you know, because she didn\u2019t know what\nto do with me. The ambulance came, and then my parents came, so [indecipherable] they still\nhere, the ambulance people left, and my mother got furious with grandmother and told her, she\njust fooled you, you should know better. [indecipherable]. Never do it again. You should not\nhave called the ambulance, because there\u2019s nothing wrong with her. She just had the croup. That\nwas my mother, too.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah, I thought she was right, later on particularly. When I became a mother. That was an\nexample. My mother was a doctor, she didn\u2019t need any other doctors, she was herself the doctor.",
        "A: She knew.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Maybe I had a cold or so, but I don\u2019t --",
        "A: -- remember being seriously ill.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: In the ghetto? Yes, my mother got very ill. She got ill with dysentery and was very, very ill.\nAnd I was on the -- on the farm, living on the farm then. And that was the only time that I needed\nhelp for my mo -- mother, it was some medication, or food stamps, you know. And didn\u2019t want\nto go to Rumkowski, but I went to somebody else. What -- you say, what was her -- his\nsecretary.",
        "A: Fuchs.",
        "A: Dora Fuchs, or somebody else.",
        "A: And they gave me some -- what I needed for my mother. And then she recovered. But my\nfather took care of her, not I.",
        "A: I was away. And -- and he wouldn\u2019t let me either, you know, they took care of each other.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, whatever it was --",
        "A: -- or maybe it was some cottage cheese, some spec -- special dairy product that was to be\nhelpful. But that\u2019s when I needed -- a-and then when I tell you that different people needed some\nhelp --",
        "A: -- from there up --",
        "A: -- on special occasions. But, it was frightful.",
        "A: It was mixed. I don\u2019t know if I paid much attention. I -- you know, told you about my getting\ninto the friendship with the woman whose daughter was taken away. And there was another\nfriendship or relationship that I developed there, and that was also a Czech woman. The cze --\nthe Czech transport was so outstanding.",
        "A: Such wonderful people. Really unbelievable. So this woman was talking with me about the\nplace to live. So I gave her, you know, we looked through the -- what\u2019s available, and wrote out\nwhere she should go. And she went and she came back, and she says, it\u2019s wonderful, I love it.\nLet me do a favor to you. Can I give you this, and she takes out a tchocki or something. I said,\n\u201cNo, nothing.\u201d Can I give you some money? I have to do something, I have to tell you thank\nyou. She came back again. And I was telling my mother what was happening, and thi -- she said,\n\u201cLook, I am very good dressmaker. Let me sew you a dress.\u201d So I came home -- and I said no,\nno, no. Listen, I am happy that you\u2019re happy [indecipherable]. So I came home and I told\nMother, and Mother said, \u201cPaula, let her do something for you.\u201d So ma -- Mother took out a\ngreen dress of grandmother that was very beautiful material, and was old and grandmother by\nthat time, either was before she died, or maybe after she died. And Mother said, \u201cGive her this\ndress, and let her sew you a dress.\u201d Which I did. And that was great. The dress didn\u2019t look so\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: I think because it\u2019s about my mother.",
        "A: And her relationship with me, that I could talk to her, tell her, and she would always give me\nthe right answer, that still now today seems very correct. I didn\u2019t want to take jewelry, I didn\u2019t\nwant to take money, but let her sew you a dress.",
        "A: Yes, and let her do something.",
        "A: Well, that was one sort of relationship, other than that, what can I say?",

        "A: That was, you know, the center of the ghetto was the -- the marketplace from before the\nghetto was formed, and through the ghetto, and now, because I visited in Lodz. So those were\nmarketplaces where people were coming, you know, sell their wares and so on. That was turned\nin -- into the center of the ghetto administration. It mean rums -- Rumkowski\u2019s office was there,\nhis secretaries, and other people in the administration, and the German headquarters. Beside\nthere, there was another building that was the Gestapo. And that was fearsome to walk across\nthat, because atrocities were happening there. People called for no reason for interrogation, for\nconfiscation, for killing. So that was the German influence in the ghetto. Now, on this Balutski\nrinnek, Rumkowski was there and if you want -- if you needed a audience with him, it\u2019s where\nyou would go, or a audience with this Miss Fuchs, that\u2019s where you would go. And that was a\nplace too, that you don\u2019t pass easily, or go in easily. Part of that Balutski rinnek was also dedic --\nsort of kept for transport for -- let\u2019s say for vegetables and fruit. Fruit we didn\u2019t have, but\nvegetables. Frozen cabbage, frozen potatoes, all kinds of things, that\u2019s where they were dished\nout, you know, if you -- if you got to know that there is something there, and you came so you --\nyou got some. So that was part of -- o-of that center, too. And that was it. There were no\nGermans -- well, there were Germans around the border of the ghetto, you know, and -- the\nsentries, and the Gypsies across the ghetto.",

And a good number\nof those people, I think two -- 300 people were able to hide in the last minute, and survived. Th -\n- it was shortly before the Russian troops marched in. So a good number -- good number, 200 or\nSO --",
        "A: -- Jews saved their lives, the ones that worked on -- on the Balutski rinnek, and were asked to\nstay to clean up.",

        "A: During the August deportation, y-you had to make a decision to go voluntarily or not, you\nknow? There was a station, a train station called Radogoszcz, where the trains were set up to\nleave. And you had to make up your mind if -- you were assigned a day where to -- when to go. I\ndon\u2019t remember how it happened. And I said, \u201cI am not going voluntarily. I am not going.\u201d And\nmy mother wrung her ha -- ha -- hands, what do we do, and turning to me, what do we do. You\nknow, I have to --",
        "A: -- to tell her what to do. So I say, \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I don\u2019t want to go.\u201d So let\u2019s try to hide.\nAnd we hid. I had a friend around there, and she had a policeman that was sort of high up in the\nSonderkommando, and he knew what to do, but eventually didn\u2019t know, nobody knew. So we\nwere hiding in a place that already was evacuated, but out -- out of a -- our house, because we\nhad to get out of where we lived, so -- to be close to the train station. So we hide -- we did hide\nin a house that was strange -- you know, we didn\u2019t know it, but -- and spend a couple days or\nmore, waiting for some signal from God, or who knows who, what to do. And then we were\nwatching through the windows how the German SS were walking and pulling people out, and\nbring -- you know, marching them to the train station. And we didn\u2019t know what they do with\nthem, do they shoot them on the way or not. So the outlook for successful hiding was ne-never --\nnot too good. And we were losing -- we are losing the -- the willpower to hide and be dragged\nout and killed. So it was sort of what happened to everybody, will happen to us too. You know,\nresignation. And one day we just showed up at the point where they were collecting people and\nmarching them to the station of Radogoszcz, and putting them on the cattle -- cattle train -- cattle\nwagons. And that\u2019s how we landed there.",
        "A: Dead by then.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It\u2019s hard to remember how long it took.",
        "A: It\u2019s a pretty fair distance, with a train that doesn\u2019t go too fast. So hours, many hours.",
        "A: Pretty awful. No water, no toilet, nothing.",

Get\nout, outsteigen, get out, and so on. And we ask, where are we? Where are we going? And they\nsaid in Hebrew, to mishpitt.",

        "A: Death, to death, yes. So we are herded in groups and start marching. And of course, all the\nthings that we were carrying with us, bundles or so, were taken away and thrown on the street,\nyou know, next to the train. So we were relieved of the luggage, and marched to the camp.",

        "A: Work sets you free, \u201cArbeit macht frei\u201d. And we marched -- we didn\u2019t know anything,\nBirkenau or not Birkenau, because they -- that probably the train stopped in Auschwitz proper\nand we were marched to Birkenau.",
        "A: Or we -- the train went to Birkenau and we were marched to the -- to the showers. You know,\nto the place where we were greeted, and the greeting was, take off your clothes, stay naked, and\naround were women, men, and the first thing that they were doing were shaving us. Our heads,\nall hair of our body. Man did that. I suppose that was Sonderkommando, too, Jews doing it. And\nthen we were --",
        "A: Take me back. We go, we walk, and then we -- we walk to the point where Mengele is\nstanding, you know, the German physician, and says, you know, women left, men right, and men\ngo right away to the other side, and women go to this side, and then we march in front of\nMengele. And so it is Mother, me and my sister. And he pulls Mother out to one side, and us to\nthe other side. And I said, \u201cI want to go with Mother.\u201d I follow Mother, and he pulls me out and\nsends me to the other side, to left instead of right, which the right was going to --",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know it was Mengele. That was a physician, we knew a physician, people were\ntalking, I don\u2019t know who.",
        "A: But we later find out that -- you know, or people were talking because they knew from some\nof the Sonderkommand that this is Mengele, this is Mengele. So we knew the name.",
        "A: And the face, now the face, so we knew that was the physician of Auschwitz, the famous one.\nAnd then we go, I and my sister are left, and we are led to this big hole where, you know, we sat\nnaked and shaved, and then led to showers. And we knew already that the showers mean death,\nso -- and that was sort of -- we all were looking for -- you know, for death. As it happened, of\ncourse, the ones that we were with did not get killed, we were really taking showers, and given\nsome so-called clothing, one shoe high heeled, one shoe low heeled, and s -- coup -- and a couple\nof sort of schmates, and led to barracks, we were led then to the barracks.",
        "A: No, our transport was not tattooed.",
        "A: And there was a number of transport that -- I think it was August already and I don\u2019t think\nthey had time any more for things like -- for -- for playful things like that, so we didn\u2019t get\ntattooed. And we were led to the barracks, and a-acquainted with the kapo, which was a woman\nand her helper. And the kapo had, in this big barrack had a wonderful room, nicely furnished and\nall that, nice. She had a very important role, and was paid for that by special favors. And that\u2019s\nhow it started, life in Auschwitz started. So before we were sent to the barracks, we still had to\nstay on si -- c\u2019est l\u2019appel, which was counting down a -- how many people we are, and that took\nhours. It was way into the night. And then we were sent to the barracks, and given space enough\n-- not enough to stretch out. There were like five in a row, five women in a row, not enough to\nstretch out, but just to curl up somehow, and that was our first day and first night in Auschwitz.\nEarly in the morning was c\u2019est l\u2019appel again, where we were standing and were counted. Every\nday, twice a day, was hours, it took hours to be counted. And the number better be right, or else\nwe were --",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: Right. And there were incidents where somebody would run away, and we would stand for\nhours, and then that person was brought back and killed. And so, you know, to give an example\nwhat happens if you think of running away. And life started there.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Of course. We knew right away.",
        "A: Yeah. Those people were sent o -- didn\u2019t know what happened to Father.",
        "A: I found out much later on, you know, in Lodz, when I was back in Lodz from a friend of\nFather, that was with him in the same camp, they were sent off to camps outside Auschwitz, and\nI think he told me that my father died in one of those marches to another camp, on the way. So,\nhe died. If he was -- I assume that he was killed, you know, because in a march, when you si --\nwhen you slow down, there was the SS man then helped you die quicker. So I assume that what\nhappened to Father.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes, y-y-you see, though Mother was very careful not to load me, the older sister with\nresponsibility for my -- for my sister, nevertheless, it was I was the older sister, and I didn\u2019t like\nit, you know? If she didn\u2019t load me, I thought she expect me anyhow to help her with homework,\nand s -- so I had the special duty of an older sister that I did not like. And she couldn\u2019t do nothing\nfor me. You know, it was all one way, though she tried. She did the dishes, and she just tried.\nShe loved me and she tried so hard, poor thing. And then in Auschwitz, we were together. And\nthe c\u2019est \u2019appel you had to lined out with five -- five women to the count, and the five women\nslept together, sort of in one row. So there was myself, my sister and three other women. And we\nsort of hung out together, and that was it. Then I became ill. I developed -- really, I got sick with\ntyphoid fe-fever. You know, fever and diarrhea and all of that, and I had no choice but report to\nthe hospital, which was another terrible thing, because we hear terrible things what happens in\nthe hospital. But I had no choice, so I went to the hospital. My sister stayed. And 1-1n the\nhospital, I ended up on the ward, the infectious disease ward. And we had a wonderful woman\npediatrician that was from town, Dr. Greenberg, and her daughter was there, too. And she was a\nwonderful physician and treated us well. Every day or every other day, Mengele would come and\nsegregate people that he thought should die already. So we had visits to -- of that sort. And then\none day -- then it was one room, and there was the other room, and between the rooms were\nknocked out, you know, a knocked out hall that you could look into the other room. And I found\nout that my sister is there. You know, she got ill, too, and came. And so I could communicate,\nand we communicated. Twenty-sixth of September it was her birthday, so I made her a present, I\nsaved up some bread, and some sausage, and gave her the happy birthday sandwich. Not only\nthat, in Auschwitz, before I became ill, and when I started to be not feeling well, our role\nchanged. She took care -- was taking care of me and doing everything for me, and being\nthoughtful and caring. It was just a different sister I had. For the first time in my life she was\ntaking care of me. I needed her help. And it was so great. But short-lived, you know, so we\nended up in the hospital.",
        "A: Then one day we hear -- oh, and then it was -- they -- medically they treated us very well.\nIsolated, with the -- was a -- they were examining every day the stool, etcetera, and blood, so\nthey know when people were well, and when they got well they were sent out back to the main\ncamp. And one day I was told that I am well, that her examination came negative and I can go\nback. And I told that to my sister, and she says, \u201cSo go back.\u201d So I said, \u201cNo, I will wait for\nyou.\u201d \u201cOh, what are you doing, that\u2019s dangerous, you know. You may get killed.\u201d Cause\nperiodically they were cleansing the hospital to the -- to the gas chambers. So she says, \u201cWell,\nyou know, they may catch you.\u201d I say, \u201cI don\u2019t care, you know, I don\u2019t want to be separate from\nyou. So I wait and then we\u2019ll go together.\u201d\u2019 And then in couple days we hear rumors that they are\ngoing to liquidate the infectious disease hospital. And true enough, one day the trucks come, and\nI could see it through the window, and they are going to do that, okay? So we hear the s -- SS\nmen coming in, and we were sort of in the middle, so they come there and the hole -- now we\ncould communicated -- communicate with my sister through the hole, but there was no way that I\ncould come to her -- her room, or she could come to my room. There was -- there was no\npossibility. They had sentry watching. So she and I talked, and she says, \u201c\u201cWhat are we going to\ndo?\u201d I say, \u201cDorka, I don\u2019t know what to do, do you?\u201d \u201cNo, what are we going to do?\u201d So I said,\n\u201cWell, I cannot come to your room so we could be together and go wherever together, you\ncannot come here, so I really don\u2019t know.\u201d I suppose we could not cry even, you know, it was\nbeyond crying. Then I hear steps and the sentries coming to our room, and saying to la -- for us\nto line up, so people start lining up. And I just was not eager to line up up front, so I was sort of\nholding back and watching. And people started to leave the room. And towards the end I see two\ngirls are jumping under the -- the beds, you know, the -- what you call it?",
        "A: Bunk bed -- beds. And I say, wow, not a bad idea. So people are leaving and I am holding\nback. And I start jumping under -- on the other end, under the bunk. Well -- and those two start\ncrying, don\u2019t do that, you will give us out, they will kill us because of you. Needless to say I did\nnot listen to that, and I stayed under one bunk bed, and that was it. And of course, I hear then,\nyou know, they go to the next room where my sister is, and the room gets emptied, and I could\nsee through the window, there was a window, the truck is waiting there, and they climb naked\ninto the truck. Hours pass, and it gets dark, and two SS men come in the room with lantern and\ndogs and start, you know, looking. Ser -- search light under the bunk beds, and did not find us.\nAnd they leave, and we still there, under, you know, waiting couple hours or so until 1t was\ntotally quiet. The buses were -- have left, and we started to talk with each other and say well,\nmaybe it\u2019s time to get out and see what\u2019s -- what\u2019s happening. So we get out and go up front,\nthrough a big hole, nurse\u2019s stations. And we find out that a number of people are left. First of all,\nsome people not from the infectious disease division. Some doctors, women doctors, and we join\nthe group. And then, I don\u2019t know how long we waited, but we were put on a train and\ntransported, we didn\u2019t know where to, but it was a benign atmosphere. We were transported to\nBirkenau to the old -- to the camp from which we originally came. And that camp was leaving\nnext morning in trains, to go who knows where -- to a camp, to another camp, you know, so who\nknows, and who has to believe that. And indeed we -- we left, still not knowing, still full of fear,\nwhat will be in the train, gas in the train, the -- you know, this in the train. And we were\ntransported to a camp in -- in a forest. It was Silesia, the German Silesia. You know, Auschwitz\nis in Silesia, the Polish Silesia, and more left is the German Silesia, but still Silesia in the forest\nand outl -- unloaded in woods. Forest, pine forest. And -- and led to -- to tents. In each tent there\nwere eight women or so. The bedding was pine branches, and the cover was pine branches a-and\n-- and hay. And that where we lived from then on, for the next couple months. Digging --\ndidding -- digging ditches --",

There was sentry, there was a little stove, a\nlittle -- you know oven, that gave a little hit -- and heat, and we could dry maybe some clothing,\nsocks -- we didn\u2019t have socks -- you know, on the oven, and then go to sleep. The air was good,\nthough cold. And we huddled together, and we slept and we went up and we were up day in, day\nout. And in short time there was something very much that lifted our mood. And that was more\noften we heard airplanes buzzing overhead, and we saw at the same time the German commander\nand his helper looking up and crying.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Those men -- those were not German airplanes, right?",
        "A: You guess who it was.",
        "A: Sure. And we were laughing. I-I mean, we didn\u2019t laugh in their face, right?",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: But before that, let me tell you one thing, in the barracks in Auschwitz. We had a -- we heard\na number of times airplanes above our head, and we could go out and see the airplanes flying\nvery low. Those were not Russians, those were American planes. With insigna -- insignias, U.S.,\netcetera, etcetera. And we are in the barrack, and praying in unison, drop a bomb on us. Why\ndon\u2019t you drop a bomb?",
        "A: On the barrack.",
        "A: At least --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Didn\u2019t matter. Do something. Somebody do something. Drop a bomb on the railway. But at\nthat point we were praying drop a bomb, just don\u2019t be so sadistic and watch us and do nothing.\nThose were American planes.",
        "A: Something like that, yes.",
        "A: I -- we heard about it, but frankly I don\u2019t remember much about it, and I -- I must have known\nmore, but I don\u2019t remember what I knew.",
        "A: I -- I might have been in the hospital.",
        "A: And how.",
        "A: I\u2019m still.",
        "A: Of course I still am. More so later, because you know there is history now. There were\npeople, particularly one Polish aristocrat, I forget his name, that went to Warsaw ghetto and saw\nwhat\u2019s going on, and he went to Washington to talk to Roosevelt and to London and tell them\nwhat\u2019s going on in Warsaw ghetto, and they wou -- didn\u2019t want to believe him.",
        "A: Karski, right.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That what confirmed the airplanes going above our heads and doing nothing.",
        "A: What cynicism. And Roosevelt saying we -- first we have to finish the war, then we\u2019ll think\nabout the Jews.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Escaped from the route. I told you how the rou -- how the Germans reacted to the --",
        "A: -- sight of planes, and probably to the news that they were getting through the radio and so on.\nYou know, they knew more than just the planes, they knew the army -- the Russians are coming.",
        "A: So one day we get the order to get ready to march. We going to the west. And then when the\nDeath March, so-called Death March started -- you know about that, right?",
        "A: Evacuating the camps to the west. So we got ready to the March. What -- how should we get\nready, w-we had nothing.",
        "A: Nothing to pack and nothing to worry about, who to li -- leave behi-behind or not. And the --\nthey had a good number of German women, SS women, and they packed their things, and they\nwent into the wagon, a big wagon, the women. And they -- we, the -- the slaves, had to pull that\nwagon with the -- those German madams sitting there, taking turns, and that was a added bonus\nfor the Death March. So we were going and going and going, and where are we going? We\ndidn\u2019t know where we going. You know what happened, the Death March ended in Bergen-\nBelsen, right, on the west border. We didn\u2019t dare s -- to slow down, because if you slowed down,\nyou were dead. You know, the -- you know, they shoot the women, many women were shot on\nthe way.",
        "A: So you have to use all your strength to go. And on the third day I said I -- wherever we going\nI won\u2019t make it because I am totally exhausted. And that night we were finished at a farm, at a\nbig farm, and slept over, on the ground of course, under cover. And th -- in that farm there were\nin -- under a shed, there were three big kettles of molasses. They were making molasses, okay?\nHungry as we were, you know what we did. We threw us -- ourselves on the molasses and ate\nthe molasses and you know what happened later. Diarrhea and vomiting.",
        "A: And I wake up, and I said, which way do I want to die. I have to find a way, because I am not\nmaking it. So at that time I was talking with a friend of mine, you know, a neighbor on my street\nfrom before the war, and in the same class, graduating from Rumkowski\u2019s high school. And she\ntoo said, well, we have to think about something. So we started to think and work together. And\nwhat we were observing is that we are going through one village after another with a very\nnarrow village street -- road, really, and that the houses beyond the fence looked empty, and we\ndon\u2019t see any people there. You know, one village after another. So the conclusion was that they\neva -- they evacuated the Germans earlier, wherever. So we thought, well, 1t will be easy enough\nto get to one of the houses if we think about it. And that\u2019s one way, taking a chance. If Germans\nare there, we are dead. If we march we are dead, so what do you have to lose? So we picked a\ntime where the sentries were not in the -- at the place that we were close by, but you know, it was\na very long line of women marching. Started with a thousand women and shrinking. So the\nsentries were sort of spaced, so we thought, well, that\u2019s time. And we just didn\u2019t have to go far to\nthe right, we were marching that way, houses were here. And we opened the door -- you know,\nthe -- undone the door, and we go in. And then, on the left hand side was a barn, so we go around\nthe barn and get into the barn and jump into the stack of hay, and stay quietly there.",
        "A: Inside the hay. And we heard the march going on, and in not too long time, it was quiet, so\nthey passed. So we waited longer, longer, til it cleared, til it was to -- completely quiet and got\ndark. And started to listen what\u2019s going on on this side. And we heard voices. We heard voices,\nand we heard a language -- a Slavic language but could not distinguish. It was not Polish, but we\nknew that 1-in Germany there were many workers -- farm workers taken from Russia, from\nUkrainia, from Belarus. So that all could be there. So after we got some reasonably time, we\nsaid, oh we have to go and see who is there. So we went and opened the door, and say hello, and\nhappy to see you, and there were few women and few men sitting around. And they don\u2019t look\nvery favorably at us. And they say -- they -- they didn\u2019t say anything, they knew who we are.\nShaved heads, you know, schmates on us. So we say, yes we just run away from the -- from the\nmarch, and we ask for help, kindly. You are Jews. Get out of here. Okay. There was no way to\ndiscuss an answer like that coming from the group. So we left, and we were in the -- you know,\non the outside again, and what to do? Well -- and they also said there are Germans in the village,\nand they will catch you. So we thought they may be right, they don\u2019t have to be right. Our\nthinking was clear, you know, in all that, the thinking was clear. So we look around, and started\nto explore slowly. And what we see on the street in the middle of the road, many dead German\nsoldiers, okay, with guts spilling out, and -- there was a fight, there was a battle, and left the\nGermans behind, so they are -- the Russians are probably advanced beyond that village. That\nwould be then to the east, and the Russians would be going west. So finally we see a house on a\nlittle hill, so we go out there. We\u2019re looking now for shelter. And we see the door is locked, but\nthe key 1s hanging on the left hi -- side of the door. The family left the key so when they come\nback they open the door again, okay? Evacuees. So we opened the door and farn -- found a well\nsupplied household, and food and wood and coal, you know, to heat and to eat and get sick from\novereating. And we made ourself at home there. And y -- cured our stomach eventually by, you\nknow, getting to some normal eating. And then what do we do? It\u2019s quiet, nobody moves. The\nnext few days we were explore the village slowly, seeing if somebody is there or not, and we\ndidn\u2019t find anybody so we were just, you know, nursing ourselves. It was warm and clean, and\nclean linen, and clean clothing, it was paradise. A German paradise. We can laugh now, huh?",
        "A: So we say w-w-what\u2019s happening? And one night we hear marchers, you know, thump,\nthump on the road. We could oversee the road, the main road, east west, and we say who -- it\u2019s a\narmy we hear, who can it be? Either Germans or Russians. We didn\u2019t dare to move, but\neventually we say we have to see who it is. So we were slowly walking down that hill and\nlooking and trying to find who they are, and what we saw was a lot of white. A lot of white\nhorses, white, little horses. Soldiers on the horses are marching in white, and white hats and\nwhite fur. I say, well it looks like Siberia, you know, snow. So that -- perhaps they are Russian.\nSo we go closer, eventually, and then we had no doubt they are Russians, you know? Because --\nindeed, you know, the white hats and white thing and white horses. Everything to camouflage in\nSiberia, but that was winter, so that served everywhere in that part of Europe. And we see, you\nknow, officers on horses along the marchers and we say, well, let\u2019s take a chance, let\u2019s go and\ntalk to the officers. So we approach couple officers and we threw ourself in their arms and say,\nthank God, you are saving us, you know that? Well, they were glad to hear that, you know. They\n-- you know. So -- and we felt perfectly safe. So we asked, where you going? Na Berlin.",
        "A: Okay. So I say, so what will be with us, aren\u2019t you going to stay here? And -- we were naive.\nAnd then they say no, we have to go -- we go to get Berlin, to free Berlin, and in couple days in a\ndifferent un -- different units will come here to stay, to -- the occupation army. So wait, they will\ncome. Well, we were jubilant, you understand, right? Our saviors are just here. Two, three days\npass, and then we see a bunch of young women marching 1n the direction of our house, because\nour house was lit. And as they come closer, we see those are our friends, those are the girls from\nAuschwitz. We know them. But they look -- they didn\u2019t look the same. So they come closer, and\nwe say, what happened to you? And they say, well, we were raped by the Russian army. And\nthey are coming here, too. They were much more east, so you know, the Russians encountered\nthem. Wow. They didn\u2019t want to stay, they wanted to go forwards, I don\u2019t know -- they had their\nplans how to go. And then is what are we going to do? We --",
        "A: Never stops.",
        "A: We were forewarned, that\u2019s true. So, in another few days, and the army is marching again,\nand few officers are coming our way, every one with a bottle of whiskey in their hands. And they\noh, they hug us, my -- my was lublu. We love you. Let\u2019s have a party. So we -- w-we knew\nalready, but we are forewarned. We prepared a bundle to run away beforehand. And then we\nsaid, you know, come to the living room and sit down and they didn\u2019t need e-encouragement or\nmore invitation, so they came and sat down, and we said, my was lublu, too, but we will join you\nin few minutes, just be patient. And we --",
        "A: You could -- few words in Polish, you know, so y-you could make yourself understandable.",
        "A: So we go and grab our bundles and go the back door to the road. And the Russians are\nmarching, you know, those were hu-humangous armies, you know? They are marching and we\nask them, where is your headquarters? So they told us, more east -- no, more west, and they were\ngoing, too. As you know they going now Berlin. So we [indecipherable] -- no, actually they said,\nthey -- the headquarters were most -- more east from they were coming. So they go west, we go\neast, and after awhile, we -- we chance upon the -- a small house that wa -- you know, a -- a\ncottage, really, German cottage, and the headquarters. And we ask to be led to the chief, to the\ncommander, and we tell the commander the story, where we from, and that we want -- we are on\nour way back home to Poland, Lodz, and would he -- and the danger of his soldiers, being raped,\netcetera, would he help us to get -- get back home? And he says yes, we\u2019ll help you. And he says\ngo to the kitchen, th-there are our women working, you join them, and -- and you can stay here.\nSo another chapter started. We were with the girls, the Russian girls in the kitchen, peeling\npotatoes, doing other things, and was fun. They are -- they were very friendly, they were singing\nall the time. And that part was fine. And we pel -- felt pretty safe. We slept -- so during the day\nwe were in the kitchen. At night -- it was the front line. From there, soldiers were going to the\nfront for the day, at night they came back to sleep. They were eating dinner in the dining room,\nand then they were sleeping on the floor, and we were sleek -- sleeping on the tables in the\ndining room. And it was pretty safe. It was -- it was good.",
        "A: Much.\nBeginning Tape 10",
        "A: We are on the way home.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Towards Lodz. W -- our road to -- was to go west.",
        "A: No, east.",
        "A: East, yes, mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I think it\u2019s a process, and we were on the way.",
        "A: And don\u2019t forget, we were on the front.",
        "A: Right? The Russians were fighting to go -- they were going west, and they were fighting their\nway -- na Berlin, the goal was Berlin.",
        "A: They were -- they were far from Berlin still.",
        "A: So -- and there was no way of knowing if the Germans won\u2019t get back. You know, they could\nconquer -- a-and that what happened in that war. They were -- you know, they were not giving\nup easily.",
        "A: Was the western armies or -- or the Russian armies. So we -- we knew that there is a big\nstrength that -- of -- of the --",
        "A: -- Germans. But they were, you know, the Russians were fight it -- fighting. And listening to\ntheir mood -- na Berlin and, the army\u2019s going na Berlin, ah, we are fighting with them.",
        "A: You know? It\u2019s happening. It\u2019s a turnaround. So we were just jubilous together with the --\nwith them.",
        "A: On the other hand, we knew that every morning troops were going out to the front that was\nnot far away. We -- we heard fightings, you know the shelling of each other, all day, and then the\nsoldiers came dead me -- you know, tired, home to the base, which was a small house, and they\nwere, you know, eating dinner, and -- and then conking out on the floor, going to sleep. So it was\nin the center of the war.",
        "A: No, we were so happy, so when we were sitting with the soldiers and eating dinner, they ask\nus about -- and a -- as I tol -- told you, between Polish and Russian we could understand each\nother, with difficulties, but we could make ourself understood, and they ask about us, where we\ncome from, who we are. So we were telling we are Jewish, we come from Auschwitz, and we are\nready to go home, thank you. And then one day, after a few days of such liberal talks, two\nofficers approached us, me and Vonda, and they introduced themselves, and they say, we are\nJewish. And we -- we -- we hear what you saying to the Russian soldiers and please stop telling\nthem that you are Jewish. They don\u2019t know we are Jewish. They hate Jews. So don\u2019t tell them\nwho you are. We will help you. Wow, that was a slap in the face. You know, to the liberators we\ncannot say we are Jewish. But those were astute officers, and they were Jews, and they -- we\nsensed that they know very well what they are talking about. And we were not surprised then.",
        "A: So what\u2019s new?",
        "A: You know? Hm?",
        "A: Same story. So that was that.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Oh, they were just keeping an eye on us for safety and so on. So just was good to know that\nwe have some comrades here that know what\u2019s cooking, and --",
        "A: -- share with us, so that was a good feeling. Friendship.",
        "A: This kind of a --",
        "A: We stay there for awhile, and they are promising us that they -- they are working on set -- on\nputting a train together that will go from that point to south Poland. And when the train is ready,\nwe are free to go. And it did not take very long. They told us, and they drove us to the station\nwhen the train was set. And we took a train and arrived in Lodz one day.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t think.",
        "A: We were just wanting to go home.",
        "A: Knowing that there\u2019s nobody, you know. I didn\u2019t have illusion that Mother will be there, or\nFather, or my sister.",
        "A: But that\u2019s home.",
        "A: That\u2019s all I knew about home. My city.",
        "A: Not a lot, but some.",
        "A: Well, first of all, there were the remnants of Jews in Lodz that stayed, you know, because of\nthey were needed to clean up --",
        "A: -- the -- the -- the quarter, and they were coming out of their holes now, you know, openly. So\nthey were there, and they were pre -- in pretty good shape, I have to tell you know, you know?\nThey probably -- they could not stop thanking God for what happened, that they were allowed --\nyou know --",
        "A: -- that their things were so different from others. There were people that coming from the\ncamps, very few. And for a long time, weeks, we sort of saw that that\u2019s it, nobody else survived.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: That -- that that is -- that is all. So we tried to -- to live. We got assigned a apartment, and that\nwas an apartment that Germans were living in and then they evacuated, they -- they went west, to\nGermany. So we had an apartment. We had no job, there were no jobs to be had, we had no\nmoney. The Jewish Committee that was trying to form itself was very weak and inefficient. And\nthere was not much help that they could give us, me, my friend and some others. So life was\nvery, very hard. And what do we do? We wanted to enroll at school, at the university. Lodz did\nnot have a university before the war. It was opening, and they had a medical faculty. So that was\nnot possible to get to that, so I enrolled in natural sciences, and tried to go to school, which was\nvery hard to do, you know, we were not there, mentally. So life was hard and there was a\nquestion how do we survive.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Vonda.",
        "A: Yes. How do we survive? Then there were the opportunities to make sa -- a living, where for\nmen, following, you know, after a war, and the war was not finish really, but Russians were in\nLodz so it was a city occupied. Usually it 1s -- people live from black market, you know,\nexchanging -- exchanging dollars, zlotys and so on. And a big thing was ba -- bringing food stuff\nto the west, to the German border, and exchanging it for other things like linen and so on, and\nthen coming to Poland and se-selling linen for money and living on that. The only thing that\nthere was a different between a -- men and women, men were very comfortable doing it. As a\nwoman you had to be prepared to get raped on the way. That was the -- the law of post-war\nwithout org -- or-order, without police, without anything. You know, you --",
        "A: Absolutely. You had to count on that. And some women didn\u2019t mind, or got used to that, and\nwe didn't want to do that, so we were like that. Then comes along a friend of Vonda\u2019s, whom she\nknew from ghetto. And she introduced me to him, and that was my future husband. And pe -- ex-\nhusband. And it was a typical story of a woman that cannot support herself, poor thing, so she\nhas to have a man who does. Is not rich, but he came also, you know, from Auschwitz, but he\nwent to his little town close to Lodz, and his parents had a little factory of producing oil from\ngrain. And he started this factory and he was making money. Not much, but enough to be very,\neffusively generous with us, helping us with bread and butter. And from little to little, you know,\nI was caught in that gratefulness. Had sex, and once I had sex, my Mama told me, that\u2019s your\nhusband.",
        "A: You marry him.",
        "A: My mother was dead, but that I imagined what Mother would say.",
        "A: You had to be a virgin --",
        "A: -- when you married.",
        "A: And the Jewish law was when you marry -- when you have sex, you -- you are married, if you\ndidn\u2019t know it.",
        "A: I\u2019m telling you.",
        "A: I wish I would be so smart. So yeah, that was a terrible thing, because from the day one, I\ndidn\u2019t think he\u2019s a -- you know, he 1s a partner for me. But I was grateful, that\u2019s true and that\u2019s\nfine. But wi -- I was [indecipherable] myself, feeling obliged by Jewish law to be his partner.",
        "A: Not really.",
        "A: But it was a question of loneliness, of no food, of having sex. And I was not a femist --\nfeminist then, free of my mother\u2019s beliefs about sex and marriage go together like a dove and\ncarriage, yes?",
        "A: That\u2019s right, and leave that, and go on. That what I should have --",
        "A: Totally unintellectually.",
        "A: Totally insensitive. Totally -- good heart he had, you know, in part, you know, to help Vonda\nand me, and that was of his good heart. He hel -- opened his house in that little town to some\nrelatives, they were coming also, from everywhere. And feeding them, and giving them sleep,\netcetera, so he was good in that way, and warm. But nothing else. Not a man to -- man to talk\nwith, to discuss things, and y-you know, that\u2019s -- that was a big miss, and I was just poor little\ngirl needing somebody to take care of her. I was not raised for that, but that\u2019s how it felt.",
        "A: Vonda was married in ghetto to a guy, and he came back from war --",
        "A: -- at that same time, so she was --",
        "A: She was set.",
        "A: She told me not to marry him, but I was not ready to listen. I knew myself that\n[indecipherable] don\u2019t, but I did anyhow.",
        "A: [indecipherable] of being alone, lonely, unhappy, abandoned by the world, by everybody.\nPoor thing. And he gives me shelter.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: But I didn\u2019t have to pay the price for it.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t. But I did.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know how not to do that.",
        "A: Aprow -- yes. It is the sort of morality that enslaved women, that their sexuality is not theirs,\nbut a man\u2019s, and they have no say over it.",
        "A: It\u2019s very hard to get away from it.",
        "A: We\u2019re still not, as women, out of the woods, to comfortly -- comfortably to distinguish a\nrelationship, sexuality, laws, etcetera. Men have no problem. Men were doing it all the time.",
        "A: Including during war time.",
        "A: Not a new thing.",
        "A: And we have a long way to go.",
        "A: \u00b046.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: No, I enrolled in school before I was married, but then -- what happened then too, as I told\nyou, I intended to stend -- stay in Poland because I thought that\u2019s my country, and you have no\nright to kick me out, German or Pole -- or the Polacks. But what started then, if you don\u2019t know,\npogroms started in Poland, around in small towns, in Lodz Jews were killed. There were famous\nkilling in southern Poland, Kielce, where Jews were killed for nothing. And it was frightful. You\nknow, it was just a second ch-chapter of killing Jews, but now from Polacks, which was not a big\nsurprise. But after that war? So there was a big exodus from Poland by Jews to Germany. Why\nGermany? Because Germany was divided and occupied, you know, by the western powers and\nby Russia. And that was Germany, particularly American occupation that we were aiming for.\nWas a window out of Europe, and that was my resolve. I have enough of that continent, I\u2019m\ngetting out. So that was -- we went to Germany, smuggled, of course, you know, through the\nborder. It was a big exodus, many people left. But in Germany, what happened? The big powers\norganized DP camps, displaced people camps, in which they put Jews, and Jews were in those\ncamps for five, six years, cause nobody wanted to give them a visa, okay? So that was another\neye opener, you know, where you going? So I enrolled in school, the university opened in\nFrankfurt [indecipherable] in medical faculty, and I enrolled, and I could do it because German\ngovernment paid for tuition, it was the beginning of reparations for -- you know, for Jews after\nthe war. It took me five years, I started in Lodz, five years to get my diploma, and the visa cames\nat that time too. So I was ready to go with my M.D. title, to America.",
        "A: In Europe this was much more acceptable.",
        "A: And in that way I should say I admired him. He let me do what I wanted. He let me work,\nmake money and he took the money and gambled it away. He was a gambler.",
        "A: Mm-hm. So I was grateful. I could work.",
        "A: Of course not.",
        "A: Medical, general medical.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Right. And hi -- I had a son two years old.",
        "A: Right, David.",
        "A: Yes, I always did a lot.",
        "A: Don\u2019t you get the feeling?",
        "A: Oh, my. I was capable, and I liked doing a lot. You know, I -- I had the energy to do --",
        "A: -- and enjoying it, yes.",
        "A: Yes. [indecipherable]. But I -- I was so grateful to him that he -- you know, most husband\ndidn\u2019t like their wives to work or make money, right?",
        "A: Stay home, you know, that was the common cry.",
        "A: And he was different, he let me -- he helped me studying, he took care of David. You know, 1-\nit was So nice.",
        "A: Of course, of course.",
        "A: He trained me so he can [indecipherable]",
        "A: Cincinnati.",
        "A: Tell you why. The idea was, when the visa finally came, through the Jewish institution HIAS,\nand you know, then there was a question where do I go. So they assigned you where to go. So\nmy first assignment was Seattle, Washington. You -- you won\u2019t think I am so smart any more\nafter I tell you that story. What do I know about Seattle, Washington?",
        "A: I had nobody to talk to that knew anything. So I took out the map.",
        "A: And I look, America, Seattle, ocean, Russia. I want you to know, when we left Europe, since\nthe end of the war til we left, we lived in a constant fear that the Russia is going to overrun\nEurope, that they are not finished. So there was always a fear that Russia will overrun. I was\ninfected by that, too, stupidly. So there is Russia, and here is Seattle, a inch on the map.",
        "A: Yes. Three -- we --",
        "A: Next door.",
        "A: I said, I don\u2019t want to go there. Would you change, kindly. They changed. Next assignment\ncame, El Paso, Texas. I consult the map again. And I look at the map and I see El Paso. It\u2019s the\nend of the States. Mexico. Cowboy coun -- Texas. It\u2019s cowboy country. And beforehand I told\nthe guys at HIAS, one thing I won\u2019t go to is New York or Chicago.",
        "A: Right. Cause that\u2019s Al Capone country.",
        "A: New York had something else, but you know, those are -- you know, and I don\u2019t want to be\nthere. I just want you to tell -- to know. Before the war, the idea of going to America was a\nhorrible idea for most Jews. Only deserted of Russian army --",
        "A: -- would go, or adventurers, or gamblers were going to America.",
        "A: A nice girl like I would not go to America. So New York, and Chicago were the biggest\ncenters of that. Well, anyway, El Paso I told them, that\u2019s cowboy country, and I-I don\u2019t know\nabout that. At that time friends of mine were already in Cincinnati, you know, with the same past\nhistory. So we corresponded, and we -- I told them the story, and they said, why don\u2019t you come\nto Cincinnati? I said, how can I come to Cincinnati, I am dependent on HIAS and all that. And\nthey se -- nevermind, they will ship you to -- to New Orleans from -- from Hamburg, and when\nyou are in New Orleans, we will call the leaders there, and they will ship you to Cincinnati. And\nthat\u2019s what happened. We were entering New Orleans, and then we correspond -- I mean, there\nwere telephones and so on, and they put us on a train from New Orleans to Cincinnati.",
        "A: Oh, well, no. We were just --",
        "A: We were just there, in Cincinnati, no job. And he -- he got a job, finally. And you know the\ninstitutions, Jewish institution were helpful in the beginning, supportive, til he was making\nmoney. And that\u2019s how we start our life here.",
        "A: I had to do my state board.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: But I took one year English in school, as an additional foreign language.",
        "A: In high school, way back. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Then I learned, I worked and I learned.",
        "A: Different language.",
        "A: Or the -- the Latin was the same.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: But different language.",
        "A: I think \u201955. We came in \u201951, I did my internship and residency in -- in medicine. I could not\ntake the board before because they had a problem with recognizing certain schools in Germany\nas worthy of -- you know, to acknowledge the graduation. So it took them few years, and finally\nI got the news that your school is recognized. So I took the state board, and then I was a doctor.",
        "A: Yes.\nBeginning Tape 11",
        "A: I opened my practice in \u201957.",
        "A: Family medicine.",
        "A: Mm-hm, yeah.",
        "A: I was about, you know, close to 15 years in practice, in family practice. And then I realized\nthat I -- you know, I had a lot -- my practice was mainly women -- women and children, very few\nmen. Family, so the husband would come and so on, but mainly women. And I was taken aback\nby observing how many women suffered from depression, deep depression. And that was a well-\nto-do suburb of Cincinnati, where families were ma -- mainly coming to work with Cincinnati\nwith General Motors, Ford company, PNG. So they were -- the husband were -- had good jobs.\nThe wives were taking care of the house and children, and I would see them in my office, and\nthey would come with all kinds of physical symptoms. And we did the work and nothing\nshowed. So I would have to tell them that I could not find anything else, so I don\u2019t know why\nyou -- why you hurt here and there. And try to sort of enlarge the questioning, what and how. I\nwas doing a lot of house calls, not because I was so generous, but maybe I wanted -- I was used\nto house calls back home. But I wanted to get to know the country I am living in, and that was a\nvery good way to do it, to see people\u2019s homes, and how they lived. So I know the ones -- one\nthing I knew that was very stressful, and that was the big companies were promoting people, but\nyou paid a price for it. The promotion would come and you had to move to another part of the\ncountry. If you get the promotion in Cincinnati, you would be sent to the west coast, and from\nthe west coast you would be sent to Cincinnati. So the family was always in a turmoil, having to\nlive with the idea that every two years you have to move, if you want to move up the ladder. And\nit was the wife that had to put in roots quickly, school, church, neighborhood. I knew that that\nwas a chore, but they were always sen -- saying that they are treated well -- they are treated well.\nThe husband really didn\u2019t move. He was still in the circles of national commerce, or\nproductivity. But the wife had to change totally her surrounding, and make it easy for the\nhusband. So I know -- knew that, but beyond that I didn\u2019t know. And I had friends, they were\neither in training of psychiatry, or psychiatrists, and they told me about it, and what -- and I\ndidn\u2019t know anything about Freudian psychiatry in Germany. We were learning psychiatry, you\nknow, but not about Freud. So, you know, the dynamic psychiatry, it was fresh to me, and it was\nexciting, so I said, I ka -- I have to do it. That\u2019s -- I went into training.",
        "A: And that was very exciting, and that was good. Listen, I have to tell you part of my story that\nI omitted, and I ashamed of that. But it is very hard. And that -- I told you I had another son,\nright?",
        "A: I was -- when I came to America, I was pregnant -- you know, David was two years old and I\nwas pregnant. And then Charlie was born in \u201951, still the same year we came. And he was a\nlovely child, so I had two children, right, and fine. He developed -- what can I say? He developed\npsychological problems, was in therapy. We did not recognize the depth of his depression.\nEventually he committed suicide. He was 21. So that is a thing I don\u2019t like to talk about. You\nunderstand why. Big pain.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Two and a half years older, mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes, go ahead.",
        "A: I knew some, but obviously I did not understand how deep it was.",
        "A: And how dangerous it was --",
        "A: -- to his life.",
        "A: Neither.",
        "A: No. He was in therapy.",
        "A: But I don\u2019t think the psychiatrist understood it too.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: If -- to -- as if to deny his existence, you know?",
        "A: Which I don\u2019t want to do --",
        "A: -- but it is too hard to talk about it, so --",
        "A: \u00b073. Charlie died in \u201973, too.",
        "A: You can say that.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t treat it as accomplishment. It was work that I had to do.",
        "A: Work I had to do to survive the war in the ghetto, in Auschwitz. You know, to bear witness,\nwhich I am doing now.",
        "A: Just to tell the story that it -- it really was.",
        "A: With my sons I talked, but very little.",
        "A: Facts, giving facts.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Certainly not in details how we talk now. So the silence was horrible.",
        "A: I could not speak.",
        "A: I could not speak. I could tell them some, but then I -- I -- I couldn\u2019t go any farther. And\npeople didn\u2019t want to listen --",
        "A: -- including my children.",
        "A: So that was a sort of silence over the whole experience.",
        "A: Individually, and as a Jewish experience.",
        "A: There was a group of people, of Jews, that came here at the same time, about the same time,\nwith similar experiences. And I was involved with that group. One was the friend that, you\nknow, asked me to come, you know, from se -- from New Orleans here. Where it was by and\nlarge not a comfortable group, the same way as my relationship with my husband was not\nbecause he was not on my level, and we had very little in common in communicating and talking\nabout things, and -- but that group was the same cut of people. We were celebrating holidays\ntogether, we had parties like, you know, for holidays. The advantage of being part of the group\nwas one. We knew about our experiences, and we didn\u2019t have to talk about it, where we from.\nWe all had the same experience, and 1-it was just being together, and not to have -- to explain\nyourself, or listen to explanation.",
        "A: But then, at the same time that I was contemplating moving away from my husband, my\nrelationship with that group also broke off. And it was funny and not funny how it did. You see,\nthat group was strictly Polish Jews of tradition and Jewishness, and patriarchy, and the woman is\na woman and I am the man. You know, in Jewish law, a woman cannot divorce a husband. The\nhusband always can divorce the woman, to the degree that if there is not a rabbi, he can tell the\nwoman, I divorce you, I divorce you, I divorce you, and that e-equals divorce, when you tell it to\nthe rabbi. But a woman cannot divorce a man. I didn\u2019t un-understand that for a long time, but\nthen, after I divorced my husband, that wo -- group turned against me, they stopped talking to\nme. And I didn\u2019t understand why til I became c -- became clear to me that I did do the\nunspeakable, I divorced a man. A woman divorced a man. So I was not sorry about breaking off\nthe relationship, but what made me very angry was realized why it happened.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but in the time since my divorce and all that, I was more free to talk with my\nfriends, many of whom were Gentiles, women we got sort of all together with a group of women\nthat we were sort of compatible, and they are all Ge-Gentiles. And I was free to talk with them\nabout it, or even with other -- other Jews. But how it happened really, maybe the impetus was the\ninterview with Lanzmann.",
        "A: No, no --",
        "A: -- I never wanted to do it.",
        "A: No, no. I did once in a school, you know, in a public school to a group, to a class, talked about\nit, and that was very unsatisfactory. I didn't enjoy it, it was just not my --",
        "A: Ye -- right. So I didn\u2019t.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Be-Because they saw the -- the film?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have it formulated either in the ghetto, or -- or in Auschwitz to bear witness. But\nthought was, you have -- you have to live through, you have to survive, be able to talk about the\npa -- because people won\u2019t believe if you don\u2019t talk about it.",
        "A: They won\u2019t believe those stories. So somebody has to tell how it was. And I didn\u2019t have any\nconcrete things to talk or write about it. But just to be alive, and show them you didn\u2019t -- you\nknow, I was not killed, I was --",
        "A: -- almost done away with, but I am alive.",
        "A: And that really happened.",
        "A: It was sort of more abstract by -- that was one way.",
        "A: To survive to tell the story. But very -- in a abstract way.",
        "A: It\u2019s not that he asked questions, but he -- we watched it together, and he told me how much he\nappreciate that, that we did it, and that I have done it.",
        "A: So we had a more unspoken feelings --",
        "A: -- of understanding.",
        "A: Which is invaluable, really.",
        "A: Thank you. And it\u2019s very important that we did it.",
        "A: I feel that\u2019s another step to sort of clear my heart and clear my brain.",
        "A: I thinks so.",
        "A: And also another thing. I think I told that to Raye, maybe to you, that the trip to Poland, you\nknow, to L\u00e9dz, the 60\" anniversary that I participate in, shook me very much, to the degree that I\nwas sorry I went.",
        "A: It really unsettled me unbelievably. And I don\u2019t have really all answers to that. One thing was\nthat it was the feeling like bearing witness to be there, established the fact that it really happened\nto me and to my family and to my people. It\u2019s sort of I put it to rest through the years, and being\nthere at the anniversary --",
        "A: -- it brought it, you know, physically --",
        "A: -- that it really did happen. And that was such a -- a reaction, physically and mentally my\nwhole body and -- was totally unsettled for months now.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: August.",
        "A: Yes, 60\" anniversary.",
        "A: I\u2019m still unsettled from it.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I done my duty.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if duty, but it is like going to a grave, you know\u201d? To a grave of my previous life.\nFamily and my own life. Ya -- 60\" anniversary.",
        "A: And of course, what else can you expect but a good dose of mourning. That\u2019s how I explained\nmy -- to myself, what I was going through since August [indecipherable] of -- you know, of this\nyear.",
        "A: You\u2019re right. It was a unfinished mourning. Because you had -- and probably for all of u --",
        "A: -- I mean, all survivors, you had to live against your wish to be dead --",
        "A: -- with your -- with your family.",
        "A: To join, you know, the family that was dead. So it took all energy to stay alive, and not to join\nthem.",
        "A: I asked, there was no -- you know, the cemetery supervision was in total disarray. They\ncouldn\u2019t find graves, so I gave up.",
        "A: But I tried.",
        "A: I hope so.",
        "A: And I think you know the interview with Lanzmann, and with you now, and talk with Raye\nhas a lot to do with it. To bring that feeling, or maybe of being free of it.",
        "A: Of the mourning.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but what can you do? How did you find that subject with other survivors when\nyou talked with --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It doesn\u2019t have the date of my mother, either.",
        "A: That\u2019s my dad.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: There\u2019s some Hebrew writing.",
        "A: Well, but he writes in Hebrew something, and the last sentence is in Polish. And he refers,\nreally, to his expression of the face, which is very angry, and he says it\u2019s a Polish thi-thing.\n[speaks Polish here]. The devil is not so terrible as he is painted.",
        "A: And that\u2019s my mother, and I don\u2019t know from when it is. And those are my parents.",
        "A: That\u2019s my father and myself. The year 1s 1927, so I am five years old.",
        "A: That\u2019s myself from the same year.",
        "A: That\u2019s a picture of myself, and I am five years old.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: Oh God, no.",
        "A: And this is the picture of my sister, Dora, and she is one year old.",
        "A: That\u2019s my family. In front is my grandmother, on m -- my mother\u2019s mother. Then is my\nmother just behind her. My father is to -- to the right. My sister next to grandmother, and I\nmyself are next to my mother.",
        "A: No, that was in the country on summertime.",
        "A: And this -- this shot is my family as well, the same constellation. In the back is my mother,\nand next to her my father. I am next to my father and in front is my grandmother, and to her right\nis my sister, Dora.\n"
