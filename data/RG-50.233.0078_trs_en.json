        "HENRY LUBELL",
        "March 2, 1992",
        "Peekskill, New York\nThe date is Monday, March 2 and we're talking with Mr. Henry Lubell of Peekskill, New York. Mr.\nLubell could you please tell us a little bit about yourself, your name during the war, your date of\nbirth, your place of birth.\nYeah, I was born 1911 in Dombrova Gornicza. This is by the German border in Poland and then in\n1916, this was during the first World War my parents moved out to Germany. Actually it was\nPoland and my father had there a job as hazan and shochet(mohel).\nIn what town?\nThe town, first it was a little town Rawicz and later on in Katowice. We were six children, four\nbrothers and two sisters. Somehow or other everybody got an education. It was no problem. My\noldest brother was a dentist. The second brother was a pharmacist. I went to business school and\nmy youngest brother also and we, I can't say well off, but better business class.\nHow was your home, Jewishly?\nJewish we only learned what we were taught at home by my father because it was a small\ncongregation, there was no Jewish lessons there. We had maybe history, Jewish history and so on\nbut otherwise we were only taught by our father, all bar mitzvah and everything my father taught\nthe same as he taught other children.\nWere you observant at home?\nNot too much. My father, yes. My mother was not so religious. Also naturally it was a kosher\nhome but we were not too religious. Also my parents knew about it and they didn't force us. They\nknew how it is and everybody finished school, high school or business school and everybody had to\ngo out from home on a job. This went on nice and quiet. We lived in Poland; this town became\nPolish again, but we didn't feel any anti-semitism.",
        "You didn't.\nNo, no. I had friends, gentile, Polish and even after the war I was in touch with him and he did a lot\nof favors what I needed, some documents from Poland and so on. Actually one of my brothers, he\nwas a lieutenant in the Polish army, the pharmacist. He enjoyed it. Especially in Poland, an officer\nin the army, a lieutenant and he had the science of the medical corps and everybody was in awe. He\nliked to put on his uniform. Till the war started out...we lived in Katowice when the war started\nright next to the German border.\nWhat were you doing at that time?\nAt that time I was in business and we were as I said pretty well off and we wanted to protect our\nparents so we sent my mother and two sisters to Kielce, this is a town maybe from the border maybe\n150 miles or so, a week before the war started. When the war started we had there this apartment in\nKatowice and the next day already the Germans all over. They came out from the holes with the\nswastika. Of course in this part of Poland you couldn't know who is a Polack and who is a German.\nThey could be whatever they wanted. Whatever was more convenient, this they took. Everybody\nspoke both languages in this part. And then we left with a little car, a little VW. Seven persons\npushed into this car and we went with interruptions and we came to this town to Kielce. This was\nFriday ninth the first day of the war. But the next day there came already rumors the Germans are\napproaching this town. We were there on the plaza in this town. It was maybe after midnight. My\nfriend put on the radio. It happened so that he had there a German station. There came already the\nmob around us that they called a spy because they heard us listening to the German radio. So the\npolice came and they took away this friend of ours with this car and he became the chauffeur of the\npolice department. Everybody said the men should go away because nobody could imagine that\nthey will punish or kill the women and children. I had a little suitcase that I put in all my necessities\nand my father just grabbed his tallis and tvillin and we went out going east. Hundreds of thousands\nof people walked away from the German border and everybody wanted to go as far east as possible.\nWe were walking and then we found a Jewish peasant who was going in the opposite direction so\nwe told him, (he had a horse and buggy) I said to come with us. We were taking all the expenses\nand we will go with this horse and buggy. And that's the way it was. We went all the way to the\nRussian border. Somehow it was defeating. We went there through these little towns in Poland and\nyou had the feeling that it's the Jew, he got to help us somehow. And it was also. We came to the\nlittle towns, the girls came out, they were washing our socks and shirts and we stayed overnight in\ndifferent Jewish places. Everybody accepted this as a normal thing. Then we were in the last town\n*Rajibiroff]ph109]. This was a prosperous little Jewish town. We came there in the market place.\nThis was Rosh Hashonah. There came out a Rabbi. We were eight or ten people in this horse and\nbuggy. So he divided us. He took my father to his house. There were some teachers. He gave him\nthere some other... They were not afraid because they didn't know that the front was moving so fast.",
        "The second day of Rosh Hashonah we wanted to leave so the Rabbi said you are already on the run,\nnever mind you can go. We will stay here and see what's going to happen. So we went another\nmaybe 20, 30 miles and we got to the Russian border. It was a small town, *Lanoftsa[ph122]. This\nlittle town was maybe 100% Jewish. Also the population took care of us...in line for fruit or bread.\nAnd they said not to worry, the Russians would come over here. We didn't believe it. Nobody\nbelieved that the Russians and the Germans made a pact to divide Poland. It happened so that the\nRussian army came to Poland. No Russian soldier came to this little town there. They went and\ncircled it and went they further and we stayed there and again the *Byezhenski[ph134] they called\nus. It came Yom Kippur and we went to the shool. The whole town was there. I come there in the\nshool, and in the hall outside I see there a man sitting there with a gun so I asked what is this. He\nsays this is the only militia man we have. He 1s Jewish. He wanted to go to Kol Nidre and the other\none is a great land owner here in this section and he had to watch him and not to lose him he took\nhim in the shool also. Then the Russians came and we went to the bigger city there in eastern\nPoland, Lvov or Lemberg. The city was so filled up with population. It had before the war some\n300,000 population and now with the refugees the town had over a million population. ..had to go\nback to bring some clothing and maybe some valuables and I went back to Germany, to the German\npart of Poland. I went there with a Ukrainian shiksa who was in love with me and another Jewish\ngirl and we went back to Poland. But this is all complicated.\nAre there any major things that happened at this time, episodes or incidents that you remember?\nThe Russian soldiers, wherever they were, when somebody wanted to come this way, the Russians\nsaid go back. So we were by the border and the Russians stopped us. This was already on the way\nback. So we told him we want to go to the German side but we changed our minds, we want to go\nback. He said so go back. So we crossed the border without being bothered by the Russians. This\nis luck. And then people didn't know what chances to take. It was only to take a chance. I survived\nbecause I didn't have any illusions. As soon as we were in the wagon I prepared for myself. I took\na carton of cigarettes, a loaf of bread and a blade, a sawing blade I put in my shoes between the\nsoles. We knew what's going on but the people didn't want to know it.\nYou knew about the camps?\nWe knew about the camps maybe not so close about it but we knew. When I jumped the train I\nknew that I was taking a chance with maybe two or three weeks of life.\nDo you want to tell us about the time when you jumped the train or was that much later?",
        "No this is later. I can tell you maybe skip the ghetto, how the ghetto worked and how it was\narranged.\nThat would be interesting. What did you do there?\nWhen they started with the ghetto and they needed people to work for them. But nobody wanted to\ngo to work. So they went out, the Germans, and they caught people on the street, wherever they\nfound them and they sent them to the railroad station. There the job was to widen the railroad tracks\nbecause the Russians have a different width of the railroad tracks. It was very hard work. There\nwas a man, his name was Horowitz, and he was the head of the congregation. That was a famous\nfamily. They had a tallis factory in Kolomjya. He came out and he had a big speech for volunteers\nto go to the railroad station so the Germans promised him they wouldn't catch nobody on the street.\nSo I volunteered. I was a strong young man. I spoke fluent German.\nWhere were you when you volunteered for this?\nIn the ghetto. We went only to German schools. So at home we spoke German and this helped a lot\nmaybe too. Anyhow we were there and everybody looked to have a bunker in the house where they\nlived. So we had the attic, like this was the wall from the attic, so we built up a second wall. We\nhad a foot, maybe two feet space between the two walls and if somebody came up the stairs and\nlooked left and right and he saw just the wall so he didn't expect that there are double walls. So the\nnext day I volunteered and the son of a bitches they hit us the same as before. Also I was a little\nexperienced with it. But anyhow I went home and I said no more volunteering. Later on it was the\nghetto a little organized and there came a lot of Hungarian Jews, among them my wife and parents\ntoo and they had there a soup kitchen and they made me in charge of order in the soup kitchen. It\nwas not an easy charge. They gave out maybe some five or six thousand portions and to keep order\namong a few thousand hungry people is not an easy job. But anyhow they had nobody else and\nthey made me the head of the kitchen. There among others my wife came there for soup, too. I\nalways treated her good. It was so there were these Hungarian Jews and I didn't come in one day to\nwork and everybody was asking for me because they knew when I was there everybody had to be\ndisciplined and that's all we needed because the soup they got five minutes earlier or later but\neverybody was hungry. And it happened so later on when I escaped from this ghetto I was in\nHungary and there some Jews were escaping from Kolomjya too and they heard about my name\nand they asked me if I was there in the soup kitchen.\nDo you want to tell us about your escape? How did you escape?",
        "In this ghetto there came every few weeks, there came an action they called it. They took thousands\nand thousands of people. First they segregated. I was there on the plaza and I was the head of the\nkitchen there with my personnel and I talked to this German and he gave me half the employees and\nme. After this went by, they took away this one day quite a few thousand people. But they always\ndid the same thing. When the day went by, whoever survived they made believe that this would be\nalready the end of it, that they wouldn't take any more people. But I didn't trust them. I forgot to\ntell you something else, let's skip it.\nDo you want to go back and tell me, it's okay.\nThe first action what there was, there were German and Hungarian soldiers. I had a little store there\nin the ghetto with sweets, bakery and so on. I went to work on a Sunday morning. I go out and I\nsee the street is empty. I kept going and I see there's a German SS standing and he stopped me and\nasked me where I'm going so I told him I am going to open up the store. So he looks at me and he\nsays you see over there on the road there is standing maybe some two three hundred people, Jews\nand they were surrounded by SS men and German shepherds and he says go there and join these\npeople. I was wearing a trench coat and here on the left arm I had the Jewish star and I was walking\nhere. I didn't go on the road, I stayed on the sidewalk. My coat opened up and covered here the star\nand as I approached this group they started walking towards me. I stayed on the sidewalk and I\nwalked by. There was a group of Polacks standing there and they said in Polish, for heaven's sake\nyou'd better go home because they will grab you too and you will never come back. I went around\nthere a few blocks and I went back home and this was the first action they took. I come home and I\ntold it to my father so he says in honor of your grandfather they didn't take you. Out of this group\nnone came back. Among others there was the sister or the wife of the *Judenratt[ph303] this Mrs.\nHorowitz and everybody was asking go and try to get the people out. He was collaborating as good\nas he could and he didn't intervene for his wife. He asked to intervene for the whole group and they\ndidn't want to give it to him. So this Mr. Horowitz later on when he realized that this was a lost\ncase committed suicide. This was the Mr. Horowitz in Kolomyya.\nDo you know what year this is?\nThis was in 1940, 41. This was the fall of 1941.\nDo you want to move on to your escape from this ghetto. You did go to other places. Is that right?\nI stayed in this ghetto till the last action was there and the Germans surrounded the whole ghetto.\nThey came at night between three and four o'clock and they took everybody out of the beds and put",
        "them all on this plaza. My father wasn't there anymore. He was taken away the action previous.\nThey kept us there on this plaza the whole day. Only in the afternoon we went out. I was there with\nfour other friends and everybody had some kind of instrument hidden on him. We didn't know\nwhere they will take us because they took people sometimes in the village behind this town and they\nprepared ditches and they took the people there and shot them there in the ditches or they could take\nus to the railroad station. So we made up, everybody was voting for me, I was always the guy who\ngot the votes, so I told the group - I said we go to the railroad station, then we have a better chance\nto jump out of the window or something. If they take us there to this little village then we will know\nthat we don't have much of a chance. So we went to the railroad station, eight abreast, and we go on\nthe road, so we knew that we're going to the railroad station. Here next to me was a woman with a\nlittle baby in the arm and as we walk along she takes the baby and pushes it on the Polish woman's\narm. She didn't know the woman, she didn't know her name. She just took a chance. She knew\nthat this child has more of a chance maybe to survive. This is what I say when it comes to\ndiscussions about the holocaust and so on about the books that came out in the tens and the\nhundreds, who can describe the feeling of this woman who gave away her baby. Who can describe\nthis? So anyhow we went to the railroad station and we were maybe in the middle of this whole\nmarch. I see that they're starting by the end of the train and they're chasing in there some seventy or\na hundred people. Then they go to the second train and they're hocking and beating everybody and\nthen I saw one of these cattle wagons had their window taken out and repaired. So I said to my\ngroup we stopped and we let the front go further and we went here and went to this wagon here, to\nthis wagon I picked out. We went in there. Nobody was hitting us and we were safe in this wagon.\nIt happened so that I was standing there and I had the feeling that I'm just a neutral observer. When\nI heard the people talking I had the feeling that it doesn't concern me and the episode with the water\ndid you put it in here before?",
        "No.",
        "There was in this wagon some seventy or a hundred people and there was no place to sit down.\nOnly part of the people could sit down. Then somebody looks out the window and it was very hot.\nThe sun was shining on the roof. It was only October. Then somebody hollers they're putting in\nbread and water in the wagons. So I said to my friends. You will see nobody will drink the water.\nThey said what are you crazy. And I said no, I,m not crazy but I know what's going to happen. And\nsure enough after a few minutes they're pushing in two loaves of bread and a pail of water and\neverybody goes and tries to grab a piece of bread or a sip of water and they turned over the pail. So\nI told my friends, you see, this is what I know will happen. And we were standing so in the corner\nthe whole day and it got dark the train started moving. I talked to my wife's parents before we\nbefore we went into the wagon. Then I said we have a chance to get out when we will take out the\npiece of wood there on this window. This was easy to take out. Everybody had a screw driver or a\nhammer or something. And I said we will jump out. There I saw a lot of people who jumped.\nEverybody who jumped from the train had here a scrape of the face like this because this movement\nof the train it went forwards and you had to jump backwards because you get the push from the",
        "movement. I was jumping the third. The first one I said you will be the first one jumping out you'll\ngo in the direction of the train and the second also and the third stays on the place and the rest of\nthem goes back and we will meet here. But it happened so that I met only one of my friends. This\nwas a young man by the name of Hammer. His parents had a paper factory in the village next to\nthis Kolomyya. This Hammer the Germans made him the manager of this paper factory and every\nday in the morning he went out with a group of workers from the ghetto. He went to work and at\nnight he came back. So he says we will go there to this village and we'll make believe that we came\nout of the ghetto to work. We had to stay there the whole day and wait till they went back to the\nghetto. He went to work and he put me there in a shack and he says I will bring you something to\neat. Just stay there. Sure enough he brought me to eat and at night we went back to the ghetto like\nfrom work. And the other group came back. And we went to the ghetto. And here comes a Mr.\nHaas, he was the head of the ghetto.\nA Jewish head?\nYeah, yeah. He says to me, Henry I want you to be the distributor of the bread. After each action or\nwhatever it was the Germans wanted to know how many were left and they sent so many portions\nof bread in. So I said no I'm not interested anymore in nothing, only one thing I want to get out of\nhere. This time there was maybe a few hundred maybe less than a thousand people there in the\nghetto out of 25,000 or more. So he says you can make a fortune. I say I know how to make a\nfortune by this bread distribution but I'm not interested anymore. So how is the gold mine there?\nYou got so and so many pounds of bread. I don't know, everybody got a pound or so, something\nlike this. The one who sold the bread had a scale - two pots, on each side a pot and one side were\nthe weights, on the other side the bread. It took a day to distribute a whole bread. So here where the\nbread was were crumbs. I never cleaned out the crumbs. The crumbs were staying there the whole\nday and from every portion of bread the crumbs may be a quarter of an ounce or something and by\nthe end of the day everything was distributed and you had one bread, maybe two breads left over.\nBut I said not interested anymore. And there was a Polish, a Ukrainian peasant maybe who\ndelivered to the Germans, they had a place where they collected metal, rags, and so on where they\ncould recycle. This peasant came one day and says next week Wednesday there came the smuggler\nto me and he has to have ten people and he will take you over the border. This smuggler was the\nsame that Elizabeth went with. I didn't know about it.\nWas he a Hungarian?\nNo,, no, this was Poland, Ukrainian. He comes. There was a girl living with me in the ghetto, a\nHungarian girl, not this one. They send the smuggler for her, to bring her back to Hungary. But the\nsmuggler wanted to go only with ten people because otherwise it doesn't pay so I told the guys and\nthey said they won't go, they will hire and go with the truck not with the peasant there. So I said",
        "okay you can do what you want. What do you think you have such a good credit rating? The Polak\nwill take you when he gets his money in advance. This peasant came and I spoke to him and I told\nhim that I will go only with this one girl and for this one girl they had the money in Hungary. The\nnext day we made arrangements and this peasant came there to this lot where they had these rags\nand he said he will go through town and by the end of the town there's a river and a bridge and when\nthey cross the bridge he will stop and take us on this buggy. So we went through town and this girl\nwas very semitic Jewish looking and whenever we went by a store and it was dark and the store was\nlight I told her to wear a hat and I took off my band and somehow I felt like I'm a free bird. Why\nshould I wear this? So I took it off and the girl took it off and we went through the whole town till\nwe caught up with this peasant and he stopped and said, get up. So we went on this buggy and we\nlaid flat on the floor and covered ourselves and he drove off. It took quite a few hours till we got\nwhere the peasant lived and we arrived on his farm and there was a big mountain of dried leaves.\nHe buried us in these leaves and he said to stay here and he will come back later. Maybe after a half\nan hour, an hour, the peasant comes and says let's go. He took us in the stable. In the stable was\nhay upstairs and he says go up there and stay there in the attic. After a long while he comes with a\nloaf of bread and a can of milk and we were eating supper, so called. And the peasant says\ntomorrow morning he goes back there and what shall he tell the people? So I told him you want to\ndo me a favor I wrote him down on a piece of paper in German to trust this man, that he is a very\ndecent guy and not to take chances with some trucks or something. I told the peasant to tell the\nsmuggler that we will have to go by ourselves because they don't know him and they don't trust him\nto go. The next day the peasant goes into town and at night he comes back and he opens up the trap\ndoor and sticks his head in and says in Hungarian[690], in English - in Kolomjya there's nothing\nleft. And it happened so that I had such a feeling that pulled me out of this ghetto, out of this town.\nThe Germans surrounded the whole rest of the ghetto what was there and they lit it up from all sides\nand hardly somebody could escape from it.\nWhat year was this?\nThis was 1943.\nWhere did you go after that?\nAfter that this peasant went with us. We went to the smuggler and I told him to tell the smuggler\nthat when we will be on the other side, on the Hungarian side, he will have to bring a piece of paper,\na letter that I gave him and other people will come the next time. They want to have proof that we\nare safe in Hungary. Besides me and this girl was another Jewish woman. She was hiding\nsomewhere in the woods and the peasants were feeding her and then there come another young boy\nand he says the next night we will go. And the smuggler says don't worry. If there is any danger\ndon't panic I will use the gun. So we went with the same smuggler and after a few days we're on the",
        "Hungarian side. The smuggler takes the letter there from this girl to her relatives. The smuggler\ngoes away and that night he comes back and says nobody is there at this address. The people ran\naway and he doesn't have nowhere to leave us. So I said what does this mean? He says we have to\ntry whatever you can but I would advise you to go to some gendarmes and give yourself up. This\nwas a sure death because the Hungarians when they caught somebody gave over to the German\ngestapo. They were right by the border. I had some Polish money so the smuggler exchanged some\nPolish money for Hungarian. This young boy who was with us said that he's going back with the\nsmuggler. This boy was living in the village where he lived before the war and he stayed overnight\nevery night somewhere else. He didn't even tell the peasants that he's there. Nobody knew, but he\nslept every night somewhere else. He went back. So I was left with these two women. The peasant\ncame. He gave me some other few pennies|*Hungarian731] he had, this Hungarian money and he\nleft us there. This was on a Friday night also. The peasant went away. When it got dark, I go out\nfrom this bunker. This was built up from pressed hay for the winter for the cows, and inside was\nhiding us. It was hollow. He goes away and that's all and he says lots of luck. We started walking\ntowards the village. It's light in the house and I hear singing Zemiros and I thought now we are safe.\nI go to the door and knock on the door and the woman asks in Hungarian who is it. I answered in\nYiddish to open up the door we need help. So this woman didn't open the door. But she was\nhollering so loud [*in Yiddish749]. She didn't open the door.",
        "Could you translate for the tape?",
        "Yes, go away from my door. You're killing me. So we left her and we're walking and we come to\nanother house. There was a light in it but it was not Jewish. And I said to the woman who was with\nus, she was a typical aryan face you go there (and she spoke very good the language also) and ask\nabout directions, where the railroad station is and so on. So the woman goes in. She knocks on the\ndoor. Somebody opened the door and she walks in and I never saw this woman again. We were\nsitting there maybe at least an hour and nobody came out. I didn't want to take any chances. We go\nthere to this village and all of a sudden a horse and buggy guy comes by and he stops and says\nwhere do you want to go? So I told him I want to go to the railroad station. So he says go sit down.\nSo we went there in this buggy and we went to this village. All of a sudden there's a little bar there\nand this guy stops and walks inside the bar and says wait here I'll be right back. We're waiting and\nhe didn't come out either. Another guy comes out and he's following us. We started walking and\nhe's following us. I said let's go in here. There's a dark yard there. We walk in there and he follows\nus too in there. I stopped and I said to this girl, talk to him in Hungarian. I didn't speak the\nlanguage. I said do something, try, do something. I started talking to the guy Polish, whatever I\ncould, Hungarian I didn't know much. I took off my watch and I had a lighter and I said here take\nthe watch and the lighter, what else can I give you and let us go. So he took the watch and the\nlighter and he says okay over there is the railroad station but watch out don't get caught because\nwhen you get caught here you are lost. This was right by the border. So we go to the railroad\nstation and outside it was dark and inside was only a pale light. I go inside and I tell the girl not to\nstand in the light. There is a line there and people are standing in line for these tickets. There come",
        "two policemen, two gendarmes, tall guys, and they started talking to me and I didn't want to answer,\njust moved my hand like this, but I understand, he wants to go ahead of me in the line. So he was\nahead of me and I came to this window in plain Polish but in Ukrainian it's the same thing. I said\nTwo to *Rachov[ph792]. This was the next town. In *Rachov this girl had a mach\ntainiste[*ph799].",
        "\"In-law\"",
        "Yeah, in *Rachov. So she says we'll go to *Rachov and then we'll see what's going to happen. So\nwe go into this train and I asked this girl how do you say in Hungarian good-night or good evening?\nI learned this and I said you take the tickets and I will sit here and sleep and when the conductor\ncomes to check the tickets you handle it. Sure enough he comes to take the tickets and *Rachov\nwas the next station. When we atrive in *Rachov I see a tumult, a lot of soldiers around. I said this\nis just perfect. In Europe when you go out from the railroad station they take your ticket when you\nwalk out and they look at everybody in the face. In this little town everybody knows each other.\nWhen we got to the gate I said in Hungarian[*815]. This means good evening. So the guy\nanswers[*816]| and salutes. We went out and we went to this *mach tainiste. This was again a\nFriday night. We get there and the girl knocks on the door and the *mach tainiste comes out and\nopens the door and she didn't recognize the girl. First of all she was maybe ten days in the woods\nand she didn't eat and so on. So she told her who she is. She started lamenting you can't stay here,\nit is dangerous and all kinds of stories. So I said to the woman, look you don't have to give nothing\nto me. I don't need nothing, but this is your relative. So she says okay. This was after Succos. She\nsaid my neighbor next door has there a succa. Go in there and you will stay there overnight. So I\nsaid look I will stay there only if your neighbor knows about it because I don't want him to come out\nand catch a thief. So the woman gave us a glass of milk, but cold because it's Shabbos and wouldn't\nbe heated and we stayed overnight. I said we won't go in the succa, we'll go in your outhouse, not\nthe neighbor's. We went in this outhouse and the wind blows and the door goes open and closed.\nSo I took out from my shoe the shoelace and I tied up the door. In the morning the woman comes\nout and she gave the girl some money and says go over there. There's a synagogue and they will\nhelp you. She didn't help anymore. She spoke Hungarian so I was not good for her. She goes away\nand I go in the street and I go to this big building where she shows me the synagogue and I see it's\nfull of soldiers there. It was taken over by the army and they made their barracks there in the\nsynagogue. Further down the block I see a Jew coming there with a tallis so I stopped him and\nasked him where's the shool and he says don't go in here. There's a barracks here. And he showed\nme there is another synagogue. He went there. He opened up, there was a padlock on the door. He\nsays, go inside. I will put up the padlock from the outside so that nobody will know somebody went\nin here. Sure enough he went away. I sit down and there was a big iron stove there, heated up. I sat\ndown and fell asleep. All of a sudden I wake up and I didn't know where I am. I think I'm\ndreaming. I see all the Jews there with the Streimel, fur hats and so on and everybody 1s singing and\ndancing and I was sleeping through the whole ceremony. One of the Jews comes over to me and\nasks me where are you from. I told him. He says you know what, do you see this gentleman there,",
        "this Jew, when we are going home, you follow him. He knows about it, you follow him. So I\nfollow this Jew to the house and we're coming in. There are his wife and three daughters but he told\nme, don't talk to my wife, don't tell her nothing because she will be afraid. I ate there and then he\nsays to go back to the synagogue. I went back to the synagogue. He told me that the padlock would\nbe open like it was in the morning. I sat down and there came in a congregation, they call it\n*shalisheedos|ph880]\nThe third meal of the sabbath.\nThat's right. They came there. They were singing and eating and drinking and they say the next\nday I will go to Marmarosz-sighet.\nRomania.\nYes but this was Hungary. So he says this young man goes to *Marmalo Sigurt. You just follow\nhim when you go off the train, don't talk to him nothing. Here is your ticket.\nWe're going to jump ahead a little bit 1f you don't mind. I'm interested in knowing about your time\nwith the partisans. Could you tell me a little bit about how you got involved with it, what you did\nthere?\nYeah, but again it's the same. It's too long.\nTell me about the major parts.\nThe major parts. In 1944, August the 28th erupted an uprising in Slovakia. It was organized by\nRussian paratroopers and the barracks of the Slovakian army. There's a difference between the\nCzechoslovakian army and the Slovakian army. They were in the barracks and the Russians drove\nin with a truck to the barracks and he said here we give you a choice, do you want to be with us or\nagainst us? So they joined this uprising and we were a group of 20 people. I said don't rush into\nsomething because we didn't know who was the leader. The communist party took over the Russian\npartisan movement and the democratic government had a branch in London. We had there a Polish\nlieutenant, he was Jew, and he got in touch through the Slovakian army with London and the army\nwanted us to join the army, and the Russians wanted us to join the partisans. This whole movement\nlasted two months. Then the Germans encircled it and we went in the woods. I forgot to mention",
        "when we were taken from the ghetto to the railroad station I learned something from the Germans\nright there. There came a truck of German soldiers to the town where we were and partisans\nencircled and took them off the truck. They were standing on the side of the road, about 40 German\nsoldiers. All of a sudden they dispersed the Germans. Everybody went in a different direction and\nyou couldn't shoot because you would shoot civilians. All these Germans escaped. So I took an\nexample from this and I told them if we go to this village if we run away, everybody has to run\naway in a different direction. But it didn't come to it. So the Germans came in and encircled this\nwhole piece of land. It went from *Bratislava [ph955] to *Korshitza [ph955]. When the Germans\ncame closer we decided we had to go in the woods. There was a whole groups of soldiers,2\nescapees from the POW camps and there was even an American B29 bomber landed there and he\ncouldn't get out of it because the lawns were wet and he couldn't start. We went in the woods and\nall of a sudden (I was very good in orienting myself by the stars or by the trees and so on) and we all\nthought that we're going east to meet a Russian army but I stopped and I said no we're not going\neast, we're going north and north are the Germans. There's the town of *Karzhmarop[ph973] and\nsome other towns and I stopped there one of the Russian officers and one of the Americans and they\ntook out a map and they took a soldier on a horse and they sent him ahead on the first line and told\nhim to come back. So they came back and they turned around and we went east. There the\nRussians were there pretty close so we came there it started snowing already and we came there on\ntop of the mountain *Prashiva[[ph985] is the name of this mountain and the Russians sent home the\nSlovakian soldiers, they didn't have confidence in them and only they kept the POWs or groups like\nwe that we couldn't go home. We were there a couple of days on this mountain and then they said\nthey will go east to try to join the Russian army. I didn't like the idea and I told my friends when\neverybody is going your way I would like to stay here. Why? I said they had the headquarters of\nthe partisans and they had there laying around bags of lentils and in the snow were frozen big beef\nliver and another piece of meat. So that's all stories.\nI'd like to know maybe about the story of how you met up with your wife. Could you tell us that?\nWhen I went with my wife..Anyhow after this whole episode we went through the front and in the\nvalley they were shooting and we were on top of the mountain and went through the front and came\nout behind the front lines on the Russian side. The first soldiers we met there were Romanians and\nthese Romanians were starving. They didn't have any food. We had food but we didn't have any\ncigarettes so we changed with the Romanian soldiers, bread for cigarettes. After we passed the\nfront line they took us to the barracks and the officers were mostly Jews.\nIn the Russian?",
        "No, in the Czechoslovakian army. There were Czechoslovaks were sent by the Russians to Siberian\nand then they came back with the army they organized in Siberia. They were mostly Jews because\nthey were running away from the Germans, from Hitler.\nThis is the army in exile. There were two Czech armies if I'm not mistaken.\nYeah. There were two Polish armies, too. One of my brothers was in the west in the Polish army\nand the other one was with the Russians in the east. Anyhow we went there and I had no idea if\nsomebody lives or doesn't live and we went to Bucharest. I heard that in Bucharest the JOINT is\nactive but the war was still on. We met the Russians and we had to give up our arms and I had left\naround some bullets and we were there with some Romanian soldiers that were collaborating with\nthe Russians. The Russians gave them guns but they didn't give them bullets. So they bought from\nus the bullets and we went to Bucharest. I thought I had a lot of money there. It was quite a few\nthousand lei. We came to Bucharest and we went to take baths in the public baths. The money was\njust enough for the bath and a glass of soda. I got in touch with the JOINT. I knew I have a cousin\nin Israel, in Tel Aviv. He went out of Poland before the war. His name was Saltzman. So I wrote\nthe address Saltsman, Tel Aviv. The first name I knew, too, Binim. We were there in Bucharest\ntwo, three weeks. After three weeks I go and they said there's a note there for me. So what\nhappened. They found this Saltzman and they gave him the note and they found out the first time\nthat I'm alive and my one brother was with my cousin there. My cousin had there a tannery during\nthe war and did business with the English. Elizabeth had here before this piece of paper from the\nJOINT. They write that I'm here and my brothers are here and one brother is there and one brother\nis in the Polish army and one is in England.\nCan we jump a little and see how close to your time of liberation. Where were you and what was\ngoing on and how were you liberated?\nLiberated? I liberated myself. I crossed the border there. When I went to Bucharest I was already\nliberated.\nI wasn't clear if the JOINT was already operating.\nThe JOINT operated there because Bucharest was liberated by the Russians before. But Budapest\nwas liberated only the middle of January 1945.\nYou were in Hungary?",
        "I was in Bucharest and then we went to Budapest and then I was looking for my wife. I had the\naddress and I walk in. The building is standing but there was a big hole in the building from the top\nto the bottom. The bomb went in but didn't explode. I went into the staircase and I see somebody 1s\ncoming down and there she was. She did not recognize me at first either and then she said are you\nthat Henry? And I said yes. It happened so that she had a guy waiting outside for her, a date. So\nshe didn't even go back to him. We went upstairs in the apartment. I have other episodes with the\npartisans.\nAnything that stands out in your mind, a particular adventure?\nWe were a group of Jews there with the partisans and they sent us out on missions to put bombs\nunder the tracks and so on. Among other things there came a Jewish group of four or five men.\nThey were with the English air force. They came from Israel but there was no Israel yet. They\nwere with the Hagana. They came with the idea to bring out the few thousand Jews hiding in the\nwoods in Slovakia and they came with the idea to make a bridge. They wanted to take out by plane\nthe group of Jews that were in the woods. They got in touch or we got in touch with them and they\nwanted to take out our group, there were some 20 Polish boys and girls and they wanted us to be the\nfirst ones coming out. But then the war started, the uprising collapsed. There was with us a young\nman by the name of Chaim *Hermish[ph1165] When we crossed the front the Russians took out us,\nthe Polish group, they didn't know what to do with us so they gave us to the Czechoslovakian army.\nThere was this Chaim Hermish and another Israeli soldier. There wasn't an Israel then. They went\nto Odessa and from Odessa they sent them back to Palestine. This was the end of Chaim Hermish.\nAfter the war, in 1950, we went the first time to Israel from Europe. This Chaim Hermish, he went\nto Palestine and he went on the radio and he was reading a list of names. Among others he had my\nname. Somebody heard it on the radio, a friend of my brother's and he called him up and he says\nsomebody heard your brother. So he says what are you crazy and this time he didn't have yet from\nthe JOINT. And he called up the radio station and asked who this was. So they gave him the\naddress of this Chaim Hermish. My brother\nwent and looked him up in a kibbutz and he was sitting with him there the whole night and he was\ntelling him stories about me. This was how he heard the first time. I wanted to get in touch with\nthis Chaim Hermish. So my brother couldn't catch him. They said he is a *\u201csheleach [ph1207]\nsomewhere in South America and he is not there. It took years. My brother passed away in the\nmeantime. In 1970 my brother was hardly alive. He says to me I heard Chaim Hermish lives 1n the\nkibbutz *Glitzon [ph1217] this 1s in the north near Haifa. So I called him up and they told me yes\nhe lives here but he isn't here now. In 1970 I finally met him and it was a reunion.\nI want to thank you very much. You have had many adventures. At some time maybe we can hear\nmore of them. I really appreciate your time.",
