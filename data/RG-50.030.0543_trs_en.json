Feiga,\nI\u2019m wondering if you can start by giving us your name before the war, as your birth\nname, and the date and place of your birth?",
        "Answer: Okay, my name \u2014 my cu\u2014 my mother gave me \u2014 I was named after my\ngrandmother, Feiga, my fa\u2014 on my father\u2019s side. And the Polish name, the school\nregistration was Fanci, f-a-n-c-i or c-y. And my last name was Hollenberg, h-o-I-l-e-\nn-b-e-r-g.",
        "Q: And your \u2014 your date of birth and place of birth?",
        "A: My date of birth, I\u2019m not totally sure. I picked a month that I love, I love May. I\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 I think I was born in March, but I really we \u2014 don\u2019t know. And I think I was\nborn \u2014 \u2019'm \u2014 I\u2019m registered in 1932, when I was in DP ca \u2014 \u201930 \u2014 1933, when I was in\nDP camp, either I was not totally understood when I gave the dates, or I was just t \u2014 it\nwas just written down for convenience, because if you were younger or older, you\nwent on this ship or on that ship. And I certainly couldn\u2019t pick any ships, or where I\nwent. But anyways, I don\u2019t think my birthday is that accurate, but I have been \u2014\nalways gone by May 28\", 1933.",
        "Q: And can you give the names of your parents and siblings?\nNovember 1, 2009",
        "A: Okay. My father\u2019s name is Hirsch Hollenberg, and I think he was born in \u2014 in\n1898, because I remember him telling us the stories that he was in the first World War\nwhen he was 16 or 17, so that puks \u2014 puts him approximately that age. My mom was\nSally Rosenberg, and I was told that she was 10 - 11 or 12 years older \u2014 younger than\nmy father, and I\u2019m not totally sure. So that would put her about \u2014 her birth date about\n1910 or 1912. I know she was 18 when she got married in 1930, and a year later, or\ntwo years later, I was born.",
        "Q: And you have \u2014 did you have any siblings?",
        "A: I have two younger brothers, I was the oldest of three. Actually four. But I had a\nbrother that was 15 months younger than I was, and his name was Haskell. And I had\nmy second younger brother was about four years younger than I was, and his name\nwas Bunion, b \u2014 b-u-n-i-o-n, [ think. And \u2014 and when we were in the ghetto, my mom\nhad a tiny baby, and about January of 1943, or February, and he died during one of the\npogroms.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Let\u2019s step back before the war. Can you tell me what your life was like\nbefore World War II broke out?",
        "A: Well, I remember my parents as extremely loving. My father had a big farm. We\nhad lots of land, and we actually were quite well off. My mom family lived down the\nstreet from us, the Rosenstocks(ph) and my grandma had a restaurant bar kind of\nthing. And her place, and her house was just across from the marketplace. So \u2014 the\nNovember 1, 2009\nmarketplace where they sold horses and cattle, so I remember going there on Thursday\nand early, very early Thursday morning, my grandma would come \u2014 she \u2014 to our\nhouse. And I remember her brown buns hair in the back. And she would say, okay\nchildren, it\u2019s time to get dressed. And she was just the most loving person. My mom,\nshe was one of six children, I think, maybe five. She had a older sister. She had three\nyounger brothers. I think she was one of six, maybe five. And \u2014 and again I remember\none of my mother\u2019s brother, when it was my first day of school he came by my house,\nand I had a white bow on my head, he made \u2014 wanted to make sure that I look my best,\nand \u2014 and I was sent off to school. But it was always, you know those memories a-are\nso vivid, and so important to me, that sort of \u2014 but it was sort of secret-like. It kept me\nalive for so long.",
        "Q: And what was the Jewish life like? Was \u2014 how was the Jewish community\nintegrated into the general life in the village, a \u2014",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 w-we \u2014 1n Korol\u00e9wka, there were houses a-along streets, the streets\nwere unpaved. And the town, the center of town was all Jewish, and there were\nsynagogues. My fa \u2014 my family was not very religious, and neither was my mother\u2019s\nfamily very religious, although my mom\u2019s father, my grandfather which I never knew,\neverybody talked of him being as a religious person. M-My \u2014 my \u2014 the Hollenbergs,\nmy \u2014 my father\u2019s two sisters were not too religious. So we\u2019d go to synagogue and I\u2019d\ngo with my father and brother, and my father would take us to synagogue to keep us\nNovember 1, 2009\nout of the house so my mom would have free time. But \u2014 and \u2014 and he loved the\nstudying of Judaism, as a studying, as \u2014 as a point of discussion. And I remember very\nhigh falutin\u2019 discussion, and very serious because I remember the voices going up and\ndown. But in the sense of devout, on the sense of \u2014 we were not. But again, 1-1n the\nmorning, he would say his prayers with the tallis and the \u2014 oh, whatever. And so in one\nsense we were Jewi \u2014 because we were Jewish my father said that it was important for\nall of us to know ar \u2014 and understand who we were. And I remember my younger\nbrother would go to chayder, I didn\u2019t go to chayder, I had a private tutor at home.\nAnd my father would talk about the stories in the Bible with my brother and I would\npipe in and tell the stories before my brother, and \u2014 and my father would say, now who\nam I talking to here? So, it w \u2014 it was just a very loving family.",
        "Q: And for holidays, did you celebrate with the extended family, and your cousins, and",
        "A: Ah, ye \u2014 sometimes. But my mom would start cleaning the house and \u2014 and\npreparing bread on Friday night, and bake it in the oven. And the house was cleaned\nfor Shabbat, thoroughly every week, and on Pesach it was over-cleaned and painted\nanew an \u2014 on the high holidays again. So twice a year the house was re-cleaned.",
        "Q: And in terms of social life, did your family socialize mostly with relatives, with\nother Jewish families, or with Polish neighbors also?\nNovember 1, 2009",
        "A: No, we didn't social \u2014 well, we socialized because my mom had brothers and\nsisters, So we socialized with them, they would come and I remember playing\n[indecipherable], all that stuff. And my father would spend an awful lot of time at his\nsister\u2019s house, and my mom would say, you\u2019re never here. But, because we had a lot of\nland and a big farm, we dealt with the Ukraine more than the Polish people on a daily\nbasis, but 1t was more in terms of labor and work being done than coming to a house\nand having coffee, nobody did that.",
        "Q: Did you help out on the farm also, or it was just \u2014",
        "A: Well, I helped out if I didn\u2019t bother anybody.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s jump ahead to start of World War II in 1939. I know that this is an area that\nthe Soviets occupied. Can you describe how life changed for you when you realized\nthat the war was entering your own little town?",
        "A: Well, when the Soviets came, the first year went according usual. But my father\nhad to report m-more precisely how many \u2014 how much grain wi \u2014 came in, or how\nmuch potatoes, that was important. And by the summer or spring of next year, my\nfather, I remember him worrying that if we had too much land, would they think us\nbeing rich, and would we have to be shipped away? So I remember already him\nworrying what will happen if the Soviets would stay \u2014 would have stayed, because the\nimposition and the taxes or the contribution of grain to the Soviet Union was quite\ndifferent than before, and he couldn\u2019t hire the \u2014 as many people as he did before.\nNovember 1, 2009",
        "Q: And as a young child, did your life change at all under the Soviets?",
        "A: No, no, as a matter of fact, 1t was quite nice. You know, I \u2014 I went to school freer; I\nwas not as fearful. I don\u2019t know what to be fearful, I couldn\u2019t tell you specifically, but\nit felt that the police was more on the Jewish side. As a matter of fact, one of my\nmother\u2019s brutha \u2014 brothers, which h-he is in the photograph, he served on the police\nforce as a consultant for awhile. So, that never happened before. No Jew would ever s-\nserve in government or a thing like that before the war. And one of my cousins \u2014 well,\nthat was maybe before the war, he tested so high in school that they were going to send\nhim to a high school in Borschev and that never happened in Korolowka before, that\na Jewish boy would go to a Polish high school.",
        "Q: Do you have any memory of whether your family was aware of what was\nhappening on the German side of the border?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know how \u2014 there was no newspaper in our town, or \u2014 or radio, although\nthe radio was just coming in, but it would be through a loudspeaker, so you never\nknew what the news were. But what happened, the Jewish community would get\npapers, a month or two months old, from Lvov or Krakow, or sometimes even from\nthe United States, and that\u2019s how they sort of got their news. The best news, if\nanybody got the London paper, or the other English, or other foreign papers, which\ncould have been six months old, I don\u2019t know, but it was old papers, you know, that\nwe got the news. But somehow, when \u2014 when in May or June, when the schism\nNovember 1, 2009\nbetween Russia and Germany came about, everybody knew immediately what was\nhappening. And I don\u2019t know how.",
        "Q: Can you describe those first days when the town fell under German occupation in\nJune 41, were there \u2014 did it take awhile before the front actually reached your town,\nor were you immediately aware?",
        "A: Well, we were immediately aware because the soldiers walked through, the German\nsoldiers walked through the town. And I was watching them walk through, you see, so\njust marching, and everybody was happy and laughing. But everybody in town knew\nthat something terrible was going to happen, because a few months before, there were\na lot of people from Silesia running to the Russian borders, and wa \u2014 and that was\neven before the war, before 1941, and there were some people that stayed with us in\nour house, because any \u2014 you have to offer hospitality to any strangers that c-come\nthrough the town. And there were quite a few different couples that \u2014 or families that\nstayed in different houses, and I remember them staying in our house.",
        "Q: And these are Jewish families \u2014",
        "A: Jewish families \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 from Silesia.",
        "A: Yes, who were running away from the Germans. So we knew that something\nterrible was going to ha \u2014 is \u2014 1s about to happen, but we didn\u2019t know the extent.",
        "Q: And did your life change immediately that day of \u2014\nNovember 1, 2009",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 when the German soldiers \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What were the first changes that you experienced?",
        "A: Well, the first changes, it was in June, and we were told, my father was told that he\ncannot hire people to work on the farm. So, my mother went to work on the farm, on\nthe \u2014 on the land with my father. A-And \u2014 in haying and all that stuff, he couldn\u2019t hire\nlaborers any more. So I re \u2014 the reason I remember, because I was the oldest, I was left\nin charge of my two younger brother, and I remember washing the floor, and being so\nproud that, you know, at seven, eight years, I wa \u2014 I \u2014 a-an \u2014 and \u2014 and I remember my\nmother being prou \u2014 but the point is that my mother couldn\u2019t do the daily chores and I\nwas left to do the daily chores, so it was immediate.",
        "Q: And, were there any anti-Jewish restrictions other than the hiring, that were\nimposed that first summer?",
        "A: Well, I-I \u2014 as a kid I don\u2019t know what they were.",
        "Q: Were you allowed to go to school come September?",
        "A: No, oh no, no. No, school was cut off even before then, right. And that was in \u201941.",
        "Q: Now, do you remember the attitude of your neighbors changing? You talked before\nabout how they were all laughing when the Germans marched through. Did they start\nto react differently to your family after the Germans came?\nNovember 1, 2009",
        "A: No, not really. I don\u2019t remember. If they did, I don\u2019t remember. Di \u2014 my family\ndidn\u2019t talk to them about it. And I don\u2019t remember any Ukraine family, even the\npeople that worked for my father [indecipherable] at least I don\u2019t remember my father\ntalking. Now that you mention it, I don\u2019t know, maybe some of those memories will\ncome back, but I don\u2019t remember it as of right now. I don\u2019t remember any Ukraine\nfamily or Polish family being happy on what was happening. Even as much as they\nhated the Russians, I don\u2019t remember anyone coming over and saying that they\u2019re\nhappy the Germans are there. The only people that I remember being happy is the\npolice force. They hired immediately \u2014 there was a new police force, and they were\nhappy, a-and they looked \u2014 went with their batons quite co \u2014 a-around, and everybody\nwas in their houses when the police went through town. But I don\u2019t remember any \u2014\nany Ukraines being happy that the Jews were \u2014",
        "Q: So other than the fact that your father couldn\u2019t hire Ukrainian laborers, for the first\nwar of the occupation, I\u2019m talking before the fall of 1942, during that first year of \u2014\nend of 1941, beginning of \u201942, were there any other changes in your life, or is it\nbasically carrying on as before?",
        "Q: Well, it was basically sort of the same. We heard the stories getting much worse,\nand \u2014 and all of a sudden there was a Jewish \u2014 a Jewish committee set up. And when\nthe Germans, or whoever it was needed things, they went to the committee and the\ncommittee obliged them. So I remember putting \u2014 asking people to give money at first.\nNovember 1, 2009\nThat was right after the high holidays of that year. I don\u2019t know when it was, whether\nit was before the first pogrom in Korol\u00e9wka, or when, but my father\u2019s older sister had\nthree boys. And I told you one of the boys was this genius type who was going to go to\nhigh school for the first year. And I think 1t was sometimes before the first pogrom that\nthey asked for young boys as laborers, and they would go to the committee and the\ncommittee would provide. And I think two of my cousins were taken as laborers and I\nthink that they were sent either to Lvov or to Belzec, or \u2014 I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Did you have to wear any identifying badge, or \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t remember when it was put on, whether when \u2014 after the first pogrom,\nI think, when we went to the ghetto, we had to \u2014 or maybe \u2014 maybe before. I\u2019m not\ntotally sure when we \u2014 we \u2014 we didn\u2019t wear yellow stars, we wore white stars, white\narmbands, and the white armband supposed to be pressed and very designating. And if\nit wasn\u2019t, you were taken off to labor camp, and so people had plastic, white plastic\nthings with elastic, and then the Jewish star, so the \u2014 the \u2014 the band was very neat and\nclear. And that I remember. And I always wanted to know where they got those plastic\nbands, and I didn't dare ask anybody, and I still think about it, yeah, 70 years later.",
        "Q: So the first pogrom, that was fall of 1942?",
        "A: Yeah, that was the first pogrom of 1942, it was during the Jewish holiday, or just as\nthe Jewish hol \u2014 or the first day of the Jew \u2014 it was sometimes in September, or\nwhenever the Jewish holiday was at that year.\nNovember 1, 2009",
        "Q: So describe the \u2014 your memory of what happened. It was the Jewish holiday, you\nwere getting ready for the holiday, and I mean, wha-what happened?",
        "A: Well, let me tell you before. Before, my father\u2019s family s \u2014 I told you we knew\nwhat was happening and my cousins were sent off to labor camp. And so \u2014 so that was\nbefore my cousins, I think, were sent to labor camp. I\u2019m not sure exactly, but my mo \u2014\nmy father\u2019s two sisters, their families, they had three boys, one had two, one was a\nhardware store manager, he had his own little hardware and another family on his side\ndug a bunker in my aunt\u2019s \u2014 my aunt\u2019s backyard. And there was a little outhouse, and\nunder the outhouse we dug \u2014 they dug the \u2014 the bunker that could hold 20 people, or\nthereabouts. So, that summer, before the first pogrom, or that actually was even before\nthe summer, because the earth was soft, so we already knew what was happening. I\ndidn\u2019t know, but them digging a bunker for no particular reason how to camouflage, so\nmy father and family knew what was going to happen.",
        "Q: And describe this bunker a little bit, besides being very big. Were there provisions,\nany food stocked, or was it just a big hole?",
        "A: N-No. It was a big hole under. You\u2019d go through the outhouse, in the outhouse\nyou'd leave the door open, so nobody would go into the outhouse. But underneath\nyou'd lift it up like going down a cellar and you\u2019d go into the bunker. But here, this \u2014\nthose marvelous people who dug the dunk \u2014 bunker, didn\u2019t dig a \u2014 for air to come in.\nThey thought the air would come in through the wood cracks in the entrance. So when\nNovember 1, 2009\nwe got into the bunker, there was no air. But that \u2014 Pll tell you that \u2014 what happened a\nlittle bit later.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s move int \u2014 describe the events before you went into the bunker. What\ntipped you off that there was an emergency?",
        "A: Okay, so there was the ha \u2014 all that summer, everybody was apprehensive and on\nthe lookout. So, if anything happened, our house was, here is the town, our semicircle\nof a town \u2014 is it okay?",
        "Q: Yeah, it\u2019s just a little \u2014 but the \u2014 just switch the volume a bit, cause it\u2019s \u2014 okay. I\ndon\u2019t know, there\u2019s some sort of noise, but I don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing it, but we\u2019ll \u2014",
        "A: Let me take this pen, and Ill draw you a picture. Here are two roads into the town,\nand here are the houses, right here. And my house is right here.",
        "Q: Okay, see if this is better. Okay.",
        "A: Okay. And my house is right here. And this road goes all the way to Borschev. So\nif you look out from my house, you can so \u2014 see the hill. So, 1t was a Saturday\nmorning. My father saw trucks coming right over there, so there was a little space in\nhere. And he calls me, he sees the trucks, and he s \u2014 calls me and he says, Fanci, go\naround and tell that the Germans are coming. We\u2019ll see you there in a bit, in a little\nwhile. Run. And I went, and they ran into the bunker.",
        "Q: So the whole extended family was together?\nNovember 1, 2009",
        "A: Prepared to \u2014 whoever was there. I don\u2019t know if my aunt and her husband, because\ntheir houses were a little bit away, but my younger \u2014 my \u2014 my father\u2019s younger sister,\nher children. The bunker was full. And my extended family, they had a baby, about a\n18 months old baby. And wasn\u2019t a baby, but it was a baby in terms of the comfort level\nof being in the bunker. Anyways, we are in the bunker for about an hour, and\neverybody\u2019s squishing back and not saying a word, and if somebody said, everybody\nwould say sshh. And the baby starts crying, and wouldn\u2019t stop. And the Germans came\ninto the backyard and they didn\u2019t have to look for anything, they heard the baby cry.\nSo it \u2014 they found all of us in the bunker. So, when I went to my aunt\u2019s, my father and\nmother were not there with me, they didn\u2019t catch up with me, they hid someplace e-\nelse, I \u2014 I assumed, after it was over. So, the Germans came and took everybody to the\nbig common. There was a common right here, green grass, a common right here and\nthey put everybody in this common.",
        "Q: Including you.",
        "A: Including me. And at one point when we taking out of the bunker, m-my uncle tried\nto run away and the German pulled him back and almost bra \u2014 broke his shoulder.\nAnyways, we all went there to the big common.",
        "Q: And did they catch your parents also?",
        "A: No, [ll tell you about \u2014 my \u2014 both my parents, my father went in a different\ndirection, he went, and my mother ran into a hiding place of a neighbor up in the thing.\nNovember 1, 2009\nAnd he-her house was right here in front of this common with all the people. So when\nthe trucks came to take everybody, that was about 10:30, 11 o\u2019clock, because I \u2014 you\nknow, you \u2014 ye \u2014 you knew \u2014 so, it was sometimes in the morning. So, everybody was\nscreaming, and everybody, you know, they were families, hold my hand, don\u2019t run\naway, stay with me. And nobody said to me, hold my hand. There was no mother or\nfather that was holding onto me. So, instead, I wasn\u2019t going to go in that truck and\nevery \u2014 and there was so much confusion and screaming and crying, that I ran away, I\nran this way, behind the monument. And there was a pharmacy here, and I ran behind\nthe pharmacy, and once I was out of sight, I ran into the fields, and I escaped.",
        "Q: How old were you, about, at this time?",
        "A: About nine, maybe. Eight or nine. It was in 1943, let\u2019s say even 10, but probably\nnine.",
        "Q: Did you ever find out what happened to the people who were captured that day?",
        "A: Of course, nobody 1s alive. And at night, I don\u2019t remember exactly when I went\nback to my house, but I found my mother with my two younger brothers, ha \u2014 they\nwere hiding. My father came back from the fields, he was hiding. And we were a\nfamily again.",
        "Q: And were there any other relatives that survived?",
        "A: My father\u2019s younger sister, where I ran to, she couldn\u2019t stay in the bunker either, so\nshe left the bunker and she \u2014 and she fell on the floor and put a blanket over her and\nNovember 1, 2009\nthe Germans came and looked and she even had stuff thrown in [indecipherable] and\nthey didn\u2019t realize that she was there, but she survived. And a month after the pogrom,\nmy ti\u2014\nEnd of Tape One\nNovember 1, 2009\nBeginning Tape Two",

        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: \u2014 second introduction. My name is Feiga Connors, but if you put in that\nHollenberg in the middle, it\u2019s just very important.",

        "A: Thank you.",
        "Q: And \u2014 pleasure \u2014 and before the tape ran out, we were just talking about how you\nmanaged to escape from the first aktion and you were separated from your aunt and\nuncle, and you went around the back and escaped and came home. So tell me what was\n\u2014 mood was like when you got home and your parents found you. That must have been\nincredible.",
        "A: Well, it was \u2014 it was \u2014 first of all, everybody said, who\u2019s here? We didn\u2019t ask how\nwe survived, but I remember my brothers holding my hands, so I didn\u2019t even get to my\nparents and my brothers were just four and seven, or something, or three. I mean, they\ndidn\u2019t know what was happ \u2014 I mean, they were kids, so \u2014 but the intensity of losing\neverything, and also what happened. The town was empty. Almost everybody was\nNovember 1, 2009\ntaken away. I use that euphemism, taken away, and I use the euphemism, I-I lost my\nfamily in the war, because in my heart, noth \u2014 every \u2014 that picture of my town and\nhome 1s static. So \u2014 and that also gives me excuse, I don\u2019t have to talk about anything,\nif things are the same. But the whole end is what I remember as a \u2014 before I ran away.\nIt\u2019s not that I felt alone withou \u2014 without my parents, but I felt the urgency of getting\nto my parents, or getting away. And I remember standing on the hill, where the trucks\npassed me by, and feeling such a\u2014 va\u2014I got you. You didn\u2019t get me. And I felt such a\n\u2014a-\u2014a defiance. Do you know, I re \u2014 I have never felt that defiance like I did at that\nmoment. So, what happened after that first ac \u2014 as you call it aktion or pogrom or\nkilling \u2014 well, it wasn't a killing, because they were not \u2014 there were only one or two\npeople or 10 people dead, but it was a town of \u2014 of about 15 to 2500 people, and there\nwas nobody left, just a few people left, literally. So what they did after that, they send\nus into the next town, into a ghetto.",
        "Q: And describe the ghetto for me.",
        "A: Ah, first, I don\u2019t remember getting to the ghetto. I don\u2019t know where I was, or I\ndon\u2019t remember the trip. It\u2019s about a 10 minutes, 15 minutes \u2014 well, by car, but we\ndidn\u2019t have a car. I don\u2019t remember how we got to Borschev or ho-how the few people\ngot to Borschev. But what I remember is we getting into Borschev and there is a room\nwaiting for us, so it means that my father or somebody went ahead and \u2014 and there was\na place for us to stay.\nNovember 1, 2009",
        "Q: And in Borschey, did \u2014 were you able to go to school, or was there forced labor?\nHow did you spend your day in the ghetto?",
        "A: Okay. It was \u2014 1n Borschev we got there right after the holiday, the end of\nSeptember, October, so 1t wasn\u2019t cold yet. There was no school. There was no labor.\nWe \u2014 my father must have \u2014 ho-how they found people to hide things, and \u2014 and oh, I\nremember too, when we closed up our house, when we left Korol6wka, my mom\ngiving things to people, and putting them in with Ukraines and Polish people for\nhiding, so we can use that either money, or linen or dishes or silver, all sorts of things,\nusing that during the war as to get food. How they did it and what, I don\u2019t remember.\nAnd so I remember sa \u2014 us getting \u2014 finding [indecipherable] and there were five\npeople; us, and my father\u2019s sister was with us at that time, she is the one that survived,\ntoo. And then a month later, how we lived. I was the one that, because I didn\u2019t look\nJewish, I was the one that went to the market to bring home food. I was the only one\nthat could leave the \u2014 the ghetto to get food.",
        "Q: And how did you do it? Was there ration coupons, or you are bartering with the\nbelongings?",
        "A: No, somehow I had money, and I would go to the market and give money a-a \u2014 and\nfor [indecipherable] and pick out what I wanted, and give the money and walk away,\nand, you know, just like what everybody does. So I did the market thing on a regular\nbasis. I don\u2019t know what my two younger brothers did with their time, or me with my\nNovember 1, 2009\ntime. It was \u2014 we were very good, nobody ever complained. I don\u2019t remember \u2014 I used\nto fight with my brothers, I don\u2019t remember one fight in the ghetto. Not that they were\nangels, but I don\u2019t even remember them.",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: And \u2014 and I told you that there was a baby that was born in the ghetto. I don\u2019t\nremember even my mother pregnant. I wasn\u2019t aware. She must have gotten pregnant at\nhome and gotten to the ghetto, because we left in October, and the baby was born in\nFebruary. So, she must have been pregnant, and I don\u2019t remember any such a thing.\nAll I remember is that we were all in the same room, me and my brother and\neverybody, when my mother had her baby, in the same room. There was a midwife.\nSo, again, how they procured the midwife, how they got the mid \u2014 I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: And, was a baby boy?",
        "A: And was a baby boy. And what I remember about the baby boy, we were all happy,\nI remember that. And I remember we all saying, well, we don\u2019t have to worry about\nnaming him, we have so many names to choose, because you name your baby after \u2014\nwell, after dead people. So my ba \u2014 so, in order to honor the people, we wer \u2014 so, we\nnamed my baby brother with certain names, know? And we \u2014 there was a bris. I\nremember somebody coming there, to that room. But I don\u2019t remember. I remember\nmy mother being fearful of the bris.",
        "Q: And who were some of the people that he was named after?\nNovember 1, 2009",
        "A: He was named Mendel. He was named \u2014 I forgot the other names, but I remember\nseven names [indecipherable] out, to honor the people, that they were \u2014 they were\ncousins, brothers. Some we didn\u2019t totally know that were dead, but we \u2014 my father told\nme, you know, wrote it down very clearly.",
        "Q: And when you were in the ghetto, was your father forced to do any forced labor?\nWas he taken out, or he \u2014 you \u2014 stayed home with you?",
        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014 he \u2014 we all stayed in the room all the time, but I don\u2019t remember seeing\nhim. So, I don\u2019t remember what it is that anybody did, you know, as an occupation. I\nhave no idea. And I know there was no school, there was no \u2014 before we had private\ntutoring, and all that stuff. If somebody didn\u2019t go to this school, they \u2014 they had all\nsorts of things, so schooling was an important thing. But I don\u2019t remember. And the\nother thing, just to summarize, we were in that ghetto, not for very long. So we were in\nthe ghetto from October \u2014 September, October, til the summertime, June, July. So it\nwas about eight or nine months. So, what happened in the ghetto, that every month or\ntwo, there was [knocking] \u2014 somebody at the door.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s pause for one second.\nEnd of Tape Two\nOctober 8, 2010\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, with Feigy Hollenberg\nConnors, conducted by Judith Cohen in Newton, Massachusetts on October 8\",\n2010. It\u2019s a continuation of an interview started last year. Want to just say your name\nto make \u2014 into the mike to make sure it\u2019s working?",
        "A: Okay. My name is Feiga Hollenberg Connors, and today is October \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, then I'll just [tape break] Last time \u2014 okay \u2014 we \u2014 we left off the interview\nright after your family had move Korolowska \u2014",
        "A: Korolowka.",
        "Q: Korolowka to the ghetto, and you had talked about the birth of your baby brother.\nAnd you had discussed a little bit about what life was like in the ghetto during the first\nmonths. And as I understand it, around Purim, things changed. Why don\u2019t we pick up\nthe interview over there?",
        "A: Okay. After my brother was born, he was born a \u2014 e \u2014 February \u2014 the end of\nFebruary, and then there was a pogrom around Purim. [tape noise|",
        "Q: Wait a second. Let\u2019s start again. Okay, this is the United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum, with Feiga Hollenberg Connors. It\u2019s a continuation of the\ninterview that was begun in 2009. Today\u2019s date is October 8\", 2010. Okay, Feiga,\nwhen we were last talking, we had \u2014 you had mentioned how your family was forced\nOctober 8, 2010\ninto the ghetto, and you talked about the birth of your baby brother, and what life was\nlike in the ghetto during that first month or two. Let\u2019s pick up the interview at this\npoint, and can you describe \u2014 I understand that things changed a lot as of March of\n1943.",
        "A: Right. So, we moved Korol\u00e9wka, we came Judenfrei after the major cleaning out\nof Korolowka and taking everybody away, and the people that were left were sent to\nthe bigger ghetto in Borschev. And we first lived in one building, then we moved to\nanother building. And my mom had a baby, I think the baby was stillborn in the o-\nother building before we moved to this building number two. And, he was a little boy.\nAnd he \u2014 and I remember him being born, and the midwife in the room, and all of us,\nmy mom, my dad, my two younger brothers and my aunt were all in the room while\nmy mom gave birth to the baby. And \u2014 and there was a bris, there was \u2014 the next day,\nor a few days later. So the ghetto had all the Jewish, the rabbis, everybody was there.",
        "Q: Can you describe the mood when he was born? Was it feeling celebratory, that\nthere was a new child, or was it fear?",
        "A: No, it wa \u2014 first of all, it was fear, not just for the baby\u2019s survival, but for the\nadults\u2019 survival, what would happen with a pogrom, with the killings, that we have to\ngo into hiding. So we already knew that he might not sur \u2014 I mean, we knew that we\nwere all in major danger, so I think, now that you mention it, that was probably one of\nthe reason that we moved from building number one to building number two, because\nOctober 8, 2010\nthere was a little bit more liberty, or people didn\u2019t say we won\u2019t allow the baby in the\n\u2014 in the bunker. Because every building had a bunker, and in building number one, the\nbunker was between the two houses, so it was a wall was walled off, and we\u2019d crawl\ninto a s \u2014 into a small place to get into th \u2014 this wall. And in building number two, the\none that we moved, the bunker was in the cellar. So when the killing began, everybody\nwent into the \u2014 to the building, that was during the Purim massacre, and \u2014 and they\ndidn\u2019t allow the baby to come in with us. He was, by then, four or five weeks old, he\nwas still tiny. And you know \u2014 and I know he was tiny in \u2014 in the recollection of what\nhe did, he was just lying there, he cou \u2014 you know, he couldn\u2019t even smile yet. So he\nwas very tiny. And so we all went into \u2014 into the bunker in the cellar, and we couldn\u2019t\nbring the baby, so we left the baby on a big bed, surrounded with pillows. And my\nmom was crying and they kept holding her down. And we stayed there, I don\u2019t\nremember how long, but we stayed there til it was almost dark, you know, from the\nmorning. And when we got upstairs we found the baby dead. But not just this, the\nbaby\u2019s cries were so loud, that the baby jeopardized the people next door, who were\nhiding in that compartment in between the walls, between one wall and another. So\nhere were the people, here were the two \u2014 you know, and the cry from this bed \u2014 from\nthis room to the \u2014 the police, it \u2014 this was not \u2014 this massacre wasn\u2019t a German\nmassacre, it was the Ukraine police and the German and the Poles that did it. So it\nOctober 8, 2010\nwasn\u2019t primarily the German Gestapo like when they cleaned out Korolowka, like in\nthe first pogrom. So this was a kind of cobr \u2014 co-cooperation with everybody.",
        "Q: And the people who conducted this, were they, the Ukrainians and the Poles, were\nthey known to the Jewish community from before, or were they brought in from the\noutside?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know anybody, and I don\u2019t recollect anybody knowing of retur \u2014 you\nknow, being friendly. I knew one of my cousins worked for the Ukraine police, and\none time I went to the market and the police caught me, and my cousin came and sort\nof rescued me in the poli \u2014 the Ukraine police let me go because of my cousin.",
        "Q: This was during the war, or before?",
        "A: That \u2014 everything was \u2014 that was in Borschev in the ghetto, a \u2014 a few weeks after \u2014\nafter the \u2014 the massacre. But \u2014 so, to finish the story with that \u2014 with that massacre o-\non y \u2014 on Purim, after it was over, we went upstairs and we saw the baby dead. And\nthe next day, or maybe it was even the same day, there was a cart with a horse, and\nwould drive by each building and people would put their dead on this cart. And my\nmother was so upset and crying that I took the baby, she gave me the baby, or I took\nthe baby \u2014 anyways, I took the baby out and put the baby wrapped up in a blanket, on\nthe cart. So I don\u2019t even know where the baby was buried.",
        "Q: And were these Jews who were doing the burial, or \u2014\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah. Nobody in those situation would \u2014 none of the Ukraines or the Poles\nwere just too good, nobody would do any cleaning, everything had to be done by Jews.\nAnd then during Passover a month later, there was the big massacre, where they\nrounded up hundreds of people and they shot them in the Borschev massacre. And\nthey lined them up and they shot all the people. I\u2014 I might be confusing a little bit\nbecause of such a long time, whether it was just at the Purim massacre, or the \u2014 or the\n\u2014 or \u2014 or the one just before Passover, where they lined up hundreds, everybody in\nBorschev and they shot them in the big grave. And again, this wasn\u2019t just a German \u2014\na German there with the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the Ukraine police with their shooting. And that\ngrave, it\u2019s still there, but what I recollect, maybe that\u2019s a childhood memory, was that\nthe grave itself was very long. It was about \u2014 longer than this house, which is this \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know how long. Well, anyways, it was almost a half a block long. And when I\nwent to market pe \u2014 the \u2014 the peasants were talking about the grave, how it was\nbubbling and the \u2014 and the blood was just going up and down, bluh, bluh, bluh. So I\nwent to the grave, and wanted to see it, to the Jewish cemetery and wanted to see the\ngrave itself. And sure enough, it wasn\u2019t as strong as the first day, but still, you can see\nthe heave of the grave, kind of, just the moving of the grave. And \u2014 and I let it be, and\nthere \u2014 one of the Sturmers(ph) \u2014 the people, the wife of Mr. Sturmer(ph), her name\nwas Chana(ph), she said to me, she says, I just want you to remember that I saw you\nin a blue coat, walking around, and I saw where you were coming from, which means\nOctober 8, 2010\nthe direction of the cemetery. So, do you know, I always thought that that was just a\nmemory kind of thing that I remembered kind of, and wouldn\u2019t say it til anybody til 50\n- 60 years later, Chana(ph) Sturmer(ph) affirmed my memory. So, I don\u2019t mean I was\nhappy, but it was like the memories were really memories, because I didn\u2019t talk much\nabout the Holocaust or anything like that, 1t was just like 1t was unshared. It was\nsomething that I knew, and it was mine. And to have somebody say, I saw from where\n\u2014 you know, in this blue coat, and all of a sudden, I remember the blue coat, and it was\nunbelievable. But after that big massacre, there were not that many Jews left in the\nBorschev ghetto.",
        "Q: Let me just stop and ask you two questions. So, with the big ghetto \u2014 the big\nmassacre, rather, on Passover, where \u2014",
        "A: Or thereabouts, I\u2019m not \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 totally sure.",
        "Q: Id like t \u2014 explain, where were you and your family? How did you and your family\nsurvive that massacre? And also, could you say, when you went to the market\nafterwards, and you heard the peasants talking, can you describe the mood of the\npeasants? Were they just talking about this with happiness, wer \u2014 with curiosity, with\nsadness?\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: No, they were \u2014 they were just talking like it was an [indecipherable] for them. It\nwas an unbelievable situation. None of them were happy, you know, was a happy -\u2014 it\nwas a market where people come on Thursday to do their business, you know. So, it\nwasn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it was Thursday; in Korolowka market day was a Thursday,\nin Borschev [ don\u2019t remember exactly. But anyways, it was \u2014 it was \u2014 people just were\ntalking in wonderment, and si \u2014 and really trying to look to scripture for affirmation\nthat those things will happen, and therefore they are happening. I mean, that\u2019s what I\nheard. That\u2019s why the complete amazement of what happened, and how it was actually\nthe \u2014 most of the peasants were really scared that such a thing could affect them\nforever, you know, in terms of the crops and \u2014 and the growth in the fields, and things\nlike that. So there was also a certain amount of wonderment and fear, and it was like,\ndid you see this? Tremendous wonderment. And \u2014 and one of the reasons that, all\nthose years later, 68 years, I want, before my time is up, I really wanted the kids to see\nthat grave. And it was nothing what I saw, and what I remember a-and felt, and never\ntalked about.",
        "Q: So how did your family survive the big massacre?",
        "A: The big ma \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 we were hiding. It was still in the same old cellar, in same\nhouse, but after that was over, there was rumors of sending the Jews to another place\nafter this massacre, and we knew what other places they were. So \u2014 so here you have\nPassover in the spring, and by May and June, we were looking for a place. My father\nOctober 8, 2010\nwent back to Korolowka to see if we could hide, if we could find somebody to hide\nus. And then in May, the end of May or the beginning of June of 1943, we left\nBorschev as a family, and went into hiding in Korolowka.",
        "Q: Can you describe how you were able to escape from the ghetto?",
        "A: The ghetto was not closed in, it was not \u2014 it was an open ghetto. The \u2014 the thing,\nthe Jews lived in the ghetto because there was no other place to live. So di \u2014 you didn\u2019t\nneed a gate or anything to close it in. There was an ordinance that nobody was allowed\nin or out of the ghetto except Jews. So, being non-Jewish looking and 10 years old, I\nwas the one that would go in and out of the ghetto with no complication except once.\nSo I did the marketing for, you know, people would give me whatever, and I would do\nthe marketing for our family and for people around us. So that\u2019s how I-I \u2014 I left. There\nwas no \u2014 no gate or electric stuff or anything like that.",
        "Q: So aft \u2014",
        "A: A-And nobody would \u2014 no Jew would dare live outside the prescribed area\nanyways, because that meant \u2014 so no matter how much you complied, it didn\u2019t make\nany difference, you died sooner or later.",
        "Q: So, did you leave in the middle of the night, or in the day?",
        "A: No, no, we left about 10 o\u2019clock in the daytime so we\u2019d have enough \u2014 because\nBorschev walking is a long ways, and so we wanted to make sure that we had enough\nlight when we \u2014 we didn\u2019t get to Korolowka, we got to some peasants house, and\nOctober 8, 2010\nfrom there they hid 1n the forest. And \u2014 and so w-we were six people, my fam \u2014 my\nmother, father, my two brothers and myself and my aunt, who survived from the big \u2014\nfrom the Korolowka killings. And we went into the forest, and there were two or three\nother peop \u2014 families that we met up for it. We didn\u2019t know, but we met up with it.\nAnd by, I think August, the \u2014 the Ukraine police found out, and they were just two or\nthree police, and they came into the forest and start shooting indiscriminately. And\nsomehow my father and I and my brother escaped, and my aunt was shot in the heart\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: Oh. Let\u2019s move back just a little bit. When you were in the get \u2014 in the forest, how\ndid you survive, where did you find food, where were you sleeping?",
        "A: Well, by then we were sleeping in the open air, you know, in the forest. And it was\nsummer, so there was no \u2014 and \u2014 and there was a stream in the forest, so we had water\nfrom the stream. My father went and got food for us. And then \u2014 I can\u2019t remember\nnow exactly whether my mother and my younger brother left us, and I can\u2019t remember\n\u2014 she \u2014 she felt she would find a safer place. That if we divide, we would have a better\nchance of survival, and finding a place. So my father took me and my brother, and my\nmother went with my younger brother, Bunion. And my father and I and my brother\nHaskell sur \u2014 went with my father. We stayed in forest a little longer after my aunt\nwas shot. Actually, maybe two days longer. My mother left. But I\u2019m not totally sure if\nshe left before my aunt was killed, or after my aunt was killed.\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "Q: Do you have memories of what it was like the day your mother and younger\nbrother, when you decided to break up as a family and she left?",
        "A: I\u2014I don\u2019t remember y \u2014 feeling of reflection or sadness. I don\u2019t remember when\nmy brother died, when the tiny baby died, or anything saying what a terrible thing just\nhappened to us. I remember that I was glad that whoever was with me was with me. It\nwas not in terms of the loss that I remember feeling sad, 1t was that I was there with\nsomebody. And if we wait it out, you know, just like they did, out the massacres, or\nlike in Korolowka, where the first massacre occurred and they put everybody on the \u2014\non the trucks, and every \u2014 and then the trucks came and everybody cried, hold my\nhand, hold my hand. And because my parents were not with me, nobody said to me,\nhold my hand, so I ran away. And that sense that I had some control and could run\naway, whether I went marketing, or whether I \u2014 I went to the grave to look at the\nfeeling, the sense that I could do something for me, and for whoever was next to my\nbody, you know. And I wanted everybody to be next to my body. And when they\nweren't there, the first part was the emptiness, the feeling of all empty, alone. You\nknow, it\u2019s just like when you go camping, and then nobody \u2014 you know, the other kids\ngo into the water, and you\u2019re still on the shore. It was a kind of unreal feeling, and it\nwas a kind of feeling that, if I don\u2019t feel th \u2014 a true feeling about it, everything will\ncome back. It will just go back to where it was. I don\u2019t know if I make sense, I\u2019m\nSOITY.\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "Q: No, it does. So, your mother and younger brother left, and \u2014 about the same time\nthat your aunt was shot. Did you actually see the Ukrainians who came into the forest,\nor were they shooting from a distance?",
        "A: No. No, no. What I remember, is my father put my head down and my brother, and\nwe crawled on our be-belly out from the area were, and we went out of the forest into\nthe field. There was a cornfield or some kind of field, and we were there. And when\nwe se \u2014 heard, when the shots were fired, and stopped firing, we stayed there for a\nlittle while longer, but we knew that they left. And when we were back \u2014 [phone\nringing, tape break]",
        "Q: So, how much longer than \u2014 afterwards did you and your sa \u2014",
        "A: Is it working?",
        "Q: Yes \u2014 did you and your father and brother remain in the forest?",
        "A: Til it got dark. \u2019'm not totally sure, but I know that we were in a village where we\nhad land. I think I told you we were farmers and we had lots of land. So, ar \u2014 we \u2014 we\nalways used the farmers, the peasants and the farmers to work for us. So my father\nknew almost everybody in the village \u2014 in the \u2014 in Korolowka and surrounding\nKorol\u00e9wka. So, the \u2014 we left the forest, and that was still hot, so 1t might have been\nJuly.",
        "Q: Did these people that you knew from before the war help you in terms of getting\nfood once you were in the forest?\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: Not in the \u2014 yeah, well, my father went and got some food, so he must have gone\nthere. But when we left \u2014 we paid everybody, by the way, nobody gave us, gave us,\nbut we paid, either in goods, we had some goods in \u2014 1n \u2014 with one farmer who gave\nus, you know, like \u2014 like pots and pans or bedding, or whatever, or whatever there\nwas, we had some goods with one person. And my father went and got some of the\ngoods to give it to anot \u2014 to give it to whoever gave us food and let us sleep over. So\nwe always paid, but the payment was nothing in comparison to be allowed to stay out\nof the rain, or out of the \u2014 oh, specially in October of \u201943 to \u00b044, when it was cold,\nwhen we found a woman who kept us i-i \u2014 f-f \u2014 til February 28\".",
        "Q: Is that someone you had known from before the war?",
        "A: Well, my father probably knew. She was an old woman, and I don\u2019t know how he\nfound her, but h-he \u2014 we paid her to stay through the months, and we paid her quite\nwell.",
        "Q: And where did she hide you?",
        "A: Sh-\u2014 we hid in the \u2014 in the barn. She had the \u2014 the \u2014 the hay, you know, for the\nwinter, and all the f-food that you accumulate through \u2014 you know, the way a farmer\naccumulates th-the wheats and the cornhusks and all that. And we stayed hidden under\nthe \u2014 under the \u2014 the \u2014 the wheat, you know, the \u2014",
        "Q: And did she bring you food, or did you \u2014\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: She brought us food every night and it was potato and water. Three and a half\npotatoes and water every night, sometimes four potatoes.",
        "Q: And did she stay to talk to you, to tell you what was going on, or \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: She just dropped the food and left?",
        "A: And left. And \u2014 and she had to do it, she had neighbors on each side, so she had to\ndo it dis \u2014 very discreetly.",
        "Q: So this time did you think that anybody else knew that you were there, or she was \u2014",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t even know the woman\u2019s name. There was one time \u2014 and we stayed\nfrom \u2014 from October, on \u2014 or November til February 28\" of 1944. So we stayed there\nfor a long time.",
        "Q: And how did you pass the time while you were hidden?",
        "A: We just sat there. And me and my brother would sometimes whisper. We couldn\u2019t\ntalk, whisper, h-how \u2014 what we would do with food, and how happy we would be, and\nof the memories, how things will be as soon as this was over.",
        "Q: Did your father whisper also, or \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, my father was between me and my brother. And one time toward the end, I \u2014\nI got very peculiar [indecipherable] with the end. I don\u2019t know why, it was night and I\nscreamed and I said I didn\u2019t care if I died, and I hope we all die today, and it was just\nnot worth. And I felt so sorry afterwards.\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: But my brother, who was two years younger than me, he was just so brave, he\nnever, never complained. I \u2014 I one time lost my temper with everybody, and my father\nfelt so helpless, he didn\u2019t know what to do. So my brother tried to talk to me. My\nfather felt that 1f nobody said anything I would calm down, which, that was what\nhappened.",
        "Q: And were you able to move around at all and stretch your legs \u2014",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: So you were lying flat?",
        "A: Lying and sitting. As a matter of fact, we had to sit close by because you don\u2019t want\nto make a big space under the \u2014 under the wheat, you know, uh, what is it called? The\nbrush, whatever. And you don\u2019t want to make a big space, because if anybody comes\nin, it has to look like nobody is there.",
        "Q: And were there times when other people walked into the barn?",
        "A: Well, toward the end, I think, 1n \u2014 either the end of January or the beginning of the\nFebruary, we her \u2014 we heard somebody coming in, but we didn\u2019t know who it was,\nand they left. And so, what happened, on February 28\" is, there was a snowstorm. It\nstarted early on, and the woman who kept us, asked us to leave. And when we got up\nto walk, stand up, it was hard, but what happened to me 1s I became very bloated. My\nOctober 8, 2010\nfeet were just so bloated. But anyways, we put on \u2014 and the clothes that I ha \u2014 because\nI was so bloated, just didn\u2019t fit. But anyways, w-we did leave, and \u2014",
        "Q: Did she say why she wanted you to leave, why she changed her mind?",
        "A: There\u2019s no question ah \u2014 she says, you have to leave. And we didn\u2019t question too\nmuch, or I didn\u2019t hear any discussion, let\u2019s put it that way. Maybe my father talked,\nbut th-there was no time that anybody sat down and talked with her, because then the\nneighbors would know what\u2019s going on. So here we were in the hiding place, and she\ndelivered th-the food at night and she said, you have to leave tomorrow. And so there\nwas no discussion, can you keep us a day longer, or anything, cause the \u2014 we didn\u2019t, at\nthe same time, we didn't want to give the place away, we didn't want to give ourselves\naway 1-1f anybody heard. So, we \u2014 we had to leave, so it was very obedient and very\nquiet, with no \u2014 no discussion. She said we had to leave, I don\u2019t remember my father\neven saying anything else. So we left, and in \u2014 and the s \u2014 and the snow was very high.\nYou know, in my part of the world the snow gets \u2014 and the cold gets cold, and the\nsnow gets very high. And so, for me to pick my feet up and down, I just couldn\u2019t do it,\nso we got to one place, and I just couldn't \u2014 and my father said that, if you just walk\njust a little while longer to this place, I'll see if you can stay there, so your body will\ncalm down. So we got to this one family \u2014 actually, there were two families, there was\nwa \u2014 one man and his wife lived in one side of the house and one woman, the other\none, lived in the other side. And so we got there at night and \u2014 and my fa \u2014 and my\nOctober 8, 2010\nfather begged the man to keep me. I think that was a kine \u2014 either Friday night or\nSaturday night \u2014 to keep me overnight and he\u2019|I come back for me the next day, and he\npromised him he would. And they knew each other, because you know, people worked\nfor us. So I was left there, and then the next day was either Saturday or Sunday,\nanyways, it was February 28\". Peasants come to that house. They must have known\nwe were there because the footprints were all over, because of the big snow. And I\nheard people saying that my father and my brother were killed, and put in the \u2014 in the\ngrotto. And the \u2014 the grotto has this big hole, this \u2014 the grotto where the\n[indecipherable] were hiding, and they put them there. And they said that the\nwoman\u2019s son-in-law, the woman that was hiding us for three months, her son-in-law\nkilled us \u2014 killed my father and my brother.",
        "Q: Do you know anything about who the son-in-law was?",
        "A: Well, he was the woman\u2019s son-in-law, so she had a daughter who had a husband,\nand the person that came in, I was telling you there was only one person we heard\ncoming into the barn, must have been the son-in-law sort of teasing us. And he must\nhave demanded from the woman to throw us out. And his name was Mucha, m-u-c-h-\na, which in Ukraine means fly. And I don\u2019t know if it was his last name or it was his\nnickname, but that was his name. And \u2014 and those people that my father\u2019s supposed to\ncome, they \u2014 they kept me, and because the Russians were back and forth for the last\nweek or two. And a month later, on March 28\", the Russian occupied the whole\nOctober 8, 2010\nterritory. So, this son-in-law, Mucha, must have known that the Russians were on the\nborder, or were within 150 miles of whatever, because there was \u2014 back and forth they\nwould progress, then they had to step back, then they \u2014 and so they were very close to\nKorol\u00e9wka. And so he must have known, so that\u2019s why he decided to make it unify.\nAnd so, when I went back in July of 209, and I asked about this person, nobody\nseemed to know about him. So, the anti-Semitism, and the quietness, who did what, is\nvery, very strong today, in 209.",
        "Q: So, the Russians came in in March, and you were, at that point, 11 years old, about?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: So, and \u2014",
        "A: 12 or\u2014or-\u2014no, right, 11. \u00b044, right.",
        "Q: And so, as \u2014",
        "A: \u201944, yeah.",
        "Q: So, your basic \u2014 you\u2019re still a young child and you\u2019re all by yourself. How did you\n\u2014 what was your reaction about liberation? You were liberated but an orphan, it must\nhave \u2014",
        "A: I didn\u2019t \u2014",
        "Q: Or did you know that your mother \u2014 did you still think your mother might be alive?",
        "A: Well, that was the thing. I \u2014 I thought my mother was alive, and I never thought of\nmyself as an orphan either, because an orphan means that somebody is dead. Although\nOctober 8, 2010\nI know that my father and brother are dead, somehow, because I didn\u2019t see it, they\nwere not dead. So, it was a word, and it didn\u2019t apply to me at all. As a matter of fact,\nthrough the whole 60 some years since \u201965 \u2014 eight years, I still have the fantasy that\nmy mother is alive, waiting for me. And my granddaughter, who is eight years old,\nwho 1s about that, you know, 10 years old, and I was saying to my son and his family,\nI said, gee, I\u2019m really afraid to go back. And my granddaughter Meagan said, but what\nif your mother stands in front of the door and is waiting for you? And that was the\nsame fantasy that I had. She didn't tell me anything new, and that\u2019s exa \u2014 exactly how I\nfeel, that she 1s still, you know. So, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m [indecipherable] teach on that,\nfrom grandmother to granddaughter, or whatever. But that was \u2014 and also when I think\nof home, I don\u2019t think of myself as a 78 year \u2014 78 year old woman, I think of myself as\n10 and 11 and 14 and 15 years old.",
        "Q: After the Russians came, did you tr \u2014 go back to the house where you grew up?",
        "A: Yeah. I \u2014 when the Russians came back, just what I did all the other times,\nwhenever \u2014 after the first killing of, we all went back to the same place to see who\nsurvived. And all the people in Korol6wka went back to Korol\u00e9wka and \u2014 and \u2014 and\nfirst of all, my house, or the whole of Korol\u00e9wka, all the Jewish houses were\ndestroyed, so it \u2014 there wouldn\u2019t be any Jewish house left. The only thing that was left\nwas the synagogue and the Jewish cemetery, that\u2019s all that was left.",
        "Q: And, did you find anyone?\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: And the pharmacy, and the pharmacy.",
        "Q: Did you find anyone to stay with, or were you staying alone?",
        "A: Well, I found an uncle and aunt, my mother\u2019s brother. My mother\u2019s brother and his\nwife, they were hiding someplace else. And I stayed with them, and we left\nKorol\u00e9wka, and \u2014 oh, we moved to Borschev. And my uncle served in the army for \u2014\nin the Russian army. And then we left. We \u2014 we left Borschev in \u201945, as soon as the\nwar was over, and we went to Germany, and I was \u2014 we were all in a displace \u2014",
        "Q: All three of you?",
        "A: All three of us. And I signed up to come to the United States, and came in \u201947, and\n\u2014 1947 in August, and \u2014 and \u2014 and came to New York, and \u2014 and I think you have\nsome of the pictures at the museum, of the \u2014 of the place, the DP camp that we stayed.\nAnd \u2014 and then \u2014",
        "Q: Were you with your aunt and uncle at this point also?",
        "A: No, they wouldn\u2019t allow them to come to \u2014 to the United States, so I could come\non the children\u2019s visa, and there was, from U.N. all one \u2014 U.S. something, a Mrs.\nBrown. She was, I think must have been a social worker. She was just so nice, she\ntalked so polite. And I wasn't sure of my birth date, and my birth \u2014 and I\u2014I know I\nwas born in March, but I wasn\u2019t sure. She said, and what month would you like? And I\nloved my little brother, and he was born in May. So I said, I think I was born in March,\nbut I love May, because the way I held on to my family is remembering things about\nOctober 8, 2010\nthem, not as much about me. So, if I remember all those little things about them, they\nwere never \u2014 they never died, you know. So she said, oh, May 1s a lovely month, how\nabout May? So we put down May 28\", but I\u2019m not totally sure of my birth date. We\nhave a\u2014 and one of the reasons too, I went back in \u2014 in July of 209, is another person\ntold me they went back and they found their birth date in the school records, and I\nwent for one year to school. I said, oh, I must go back and see if they have the record.\nAnd of course, that wasn\u2019t true.",
        "Q: And, so when you got to the States were you living alone, or did anyone adopt you,\nor \u2014",
        "A: Oh, no, no. They took the children to a \u2014 oh, I should have written down the name\nof the places \u2014 to the Bronx. Oh, I want to say \u2014 anyways, it was a \u2014 an orphagenage,\nand then the Jewish Family and Children Service asked the kids where they want \u2014\nsome of them had relatives in New York, some of the \u2014 and, of course, every \u2014 I\nwanted to stay in New York. And the reason was, in case anything happened, I could\ntake a boat right back. So, there was this lady, another very nice person, and said, well,\nwhere would you like to go? There\u2019s a pl \u2014 Jewish Family and Children right now,\nChicago or Boston. And so I said, well, is Boston on the coast, you know. Yes, it is.\nSo I went to Boston, and the Jewish and Family and Children\u2019s Service took me in,\nand they found adoptive families for me, and they found very nice families and they\nwanted to adopt me so badly. There was a Mrs. Wachs(ph) and Morris Wachs(ph),\nOctober 8, 2010\nhe was a soldier in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in Germany. And \u2014 and they were so nice, they had no\nchildren. And I just couldn\u2019t be adopted, because you see, I had all those birthdays and\nall those little things in my heart, that I didn't tell anybody. And so I couldn\u2019t be\nadopted. S-So I remember one time, it was another nice family that I don\u2019t know, they\ndi \u2014 I don\u2019t think they wanted to adopt me, but anyways, I sort of ran away from them\nan-and ended up at the harbor when the agency found me. So they found a \u2014 a \u2014a very\nnice overnight school for ma \u2014 for me, called the Windsor Mountain School in Lenox,\nand it\u2019s a high school. And I went there, and it was the most marvelous, beautiful place\nfor me, because I was among kids who were kids in this school, and I didn\u2019t have to\ngive loyalty to somebody that \u2014 that wasn\u2019t mine. Do y \u2014 do you understand? I didn't\nhave to love anybody except from sheer goodwill. So I was in this beautiful school that\nsaved my soul. You know, maybe coming to the United States saved my life, but that\nschool saved my soul. And also, what I discovered is books and reading. And so, after\nI graduate, I applied for scholarships, got scholarships. Oh, the first year, I was with\nthe Jewish Family Servi \u2014 there was a social worker named Edith Costa, and she took\nus to Revere beach, around here, and we had an accident, and I broke my nose\nbecause I was sitting on somebody\u2019s lap. And bingo, like this, and so I got 500 dollars\nfor the broken nose. So when I graduated high school, I applied for a scholarship and I\nhad 500 dollars, that paid for room and board, and I got scholarship. And then, when I\nOctober 8, 2010\ngraduated from \u2014 with my belach \u2014 bachelor\u2019s, I applied to the VA and got a\nscholarship to go to school of social work.",
        "Q: And let me ask about your decision to become a social worker.",
        "A: Well, I think Mrs. Brown, the first person that was so inviting; then I had a\u2014a\nsocial worker named Mrs. Levine, who wa \u2014 who told me always, don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s\nokay, if I messed up. That\u2019s okay. And \u2014 and she \u2014 and there was a woman in\nparticular, Mrs. Carter, of the Jewish Family and Children\u2019s Service, who worked\nvery hard to get money to send kids like us to a private school. And there were other\nkids, and it was really Mrs. Carter that made the difference.",
        "Q: Let me just ask if there\u2019s anything else that you would like to say that we haven\u2019t\ncovered?",
        "A: Well, not in terms necessarily of my story, because I\u2019m telling my story 68 to 69\nyears later, as an old woman. The silence for me was not that it didn\u2019t happen, but the\nsilence for me \u2014 are you looking at \u2014",
        "Q: No, no, no, I just \u2014",
        "A: The silence for me was to keep everything in place. And if I talk about the\nHolocaust, or missing my mother, or wanting my father so badly, and when in \u2014 and\nnot going to my own graduations, because I didn't have who I wanted, was because I\nmight lose that in my memory. That if I share those truths with somebody else, then\nthat might be taken away, too. And it was a peculiar kind of thinking. And I\u2019ve been\nOctober 8, 2010\nsort of reading more about it, and \u2014 and the kids, my own children, who run from 50 to\n40 now, really are telling me now how they wondered why they didn\u2019t have a\ngrandmother and why I never talked about it. And my husband too. And \u2014 and my\nhusband in particular felt that he wa \u2014 I was who I was, he didn\u2019t need \u2014 he knew\nenough to know, but I did-didn\u2019t have to talk about it, and the same thing his family.\nHis ma \u2014 his mom, that I like very much, my mother-in-law said, don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t hurt her\nany more. So, it was really \u2014 the thing that I think needs to be shared 1s not that I want\nto forget them, but I just need to say it. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s appropriate or not,\nbecause it\u2019s not the story",
        "Q: Oh absolutely. No, it\u2019s absolutely appropriate, and just want to thank you so much\nfor sharing it and just \u2014 despite the pain. We\u2019re very grateful. Thank you so much.",

My father\u2019s name is Hirsch Hollenberg, and I think he was born in \u2014 in\n1898, because I remember him telling us the stories that he was in the first World War\nwhen he was 16 or 17, so that puks \u2014 puts him approximately that age. My mom was\nSally Rosenberg, and I was told that she was 10 - 11 or 12 years older \u2014 younger than\nmy father, and I\u2019m not totally sure. So that would put her about \u2014 her birth date about\n1910 or 1912. I know she was 18 when she got married in 1930, and a year later, or\ntwo years later, I was born.",

And \u2014 and when we were in the ghetto, my mom\nhad a tiny baby, and about January of 1943, or February, and he died during one of the\npogroms.",
        "A: Well, I remember my parents as extremely loving. My father had a big farm. We\nhad lots of land, and we actually were quite well off. My mom family lived down the\nstreet from us, the Rosenstocks(ph) and my grandma had a restaurant bar kind of\nthing. And her place, and her house was just across from the marketplace. So \u2014 the\nNovember 1, 2009\nmarketplace where they sold horses and cattle, so I remember going there on Thursday\nand early, very early Thursday morning, my grandma would come \u2014 she \u2014 to our\nhouse. And I remember her brown buns hair in the back. And she would say, okay\nchildren, it\u2019s time to get dressed. And she was just the most loving person. My mom,\nshe was one of six children, I think, maybe five. She had a older sister. She had three\nyounger brothers. I think she was one of six, maybe five. And \u2014 and again I remember\none of my mother\u2019s brother, when it was my first day of school he came by my house,\nand I had a white bow on my head, he made \u2014 wanted to make sure that I look my best,\nand \u2014 and I was sent off to school. But it was always, you know those memories a-are\nso vivid, and so important to me, that sort of \u2014 but it was sort of secret-like. It kept me\nalive for so long.",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 w-we \u2014 1n Korol\u00e9wka, there were houses a-along streets, the streets\nwere unpaved. And the town, the center of town was all Jewish, and there were\nsynagogues. My fa \u2014 my family was not very religious, and neither was my mother\u2019s\nfamily very religious, although my mom\u2019s father, my grandfather which I never knew,\neverybody talked of him being as a religious person. M-My \u2014 my \u2014 the Hollenbergs,\nmy \u2014 my father\u2019s two sisters were not too religious. So we\u2019d go to synagogue and I\u2019d\ngo with my father and brother, and my father would take us to synagogue to keep us\nNovember 1, 2009\nout of the house so my mom would have free time. But \u2014 and \u2014 and he loved the\nstudying of Judaism, as a studying, as \u2014 as a point of discussion. And I remember very\nhigh falutin\u2019 discussion, and very serious because I remember the voices going up and\ndown. But in the sense of devout, on the sense of \u2014 we were not. But again, 1-1n the\nmorning, he would say his prayers with the tallis and the \u2014 oh, whatever. And so in one\nsense we were Jewi \u2014 because we were Jewish my father said that it was important for\nall of us to know ar \u2014 and understand who we were. And I remember my younger\nbrother would go to chayder, I didn\u2019t go to chayder, I had a private tutor at home.\nAnd my father would talk about the stories in the Bible with my brother and I would\npipe in and tell the stories before my brother, and \u2014 and my father would say, now who\nam I talking to here? So, it w \u2014 it was just a very loving family.",
        "A: Ah, ye \u2014 sometimes. But my mom would start cleaning the house and \u2014 and\npreparing bread on Friday night, and bake it in the oven. And the house was cleaned\nfor Shabbat, thoroughly every week, and on Pesach it was over-cleaned and painted\nanew an \u2014 on the high holidays again. So twice a year the house was re-cleaned.\nNovember 1, 2009",
        "A: No, we didn't social \u2014 well, we socialized because my mom had brothers and\nsisters, So we socialized with them, they would come and I remember playing\n[indecipherable], all that stuff. And my father would spend an awful lot of time at his\nsister\u2019s house, and my mom would say, you\u2019re never here. But, because we had a lot of\nland and a big farm, we dealt with the Ukraine more than the Polish people on a daily\nbasis, but 1t was more in terms of labor and work being done than coming to a house\nand having coffee, nobody did that.",

But my father\nhad to report m-more precisely how many \u2014 how much grain wi \u2014 came in, or how\nmuch potatoes, that was important. And by the summer or spring of next year, my\nfather, I remember him worrying that if we had too much land, would they think us\nbeing rich, and would we have to be shipped away? So I remember already him\nworrying what will happen if the Soviets would stay \u2014 would have stayed, because the\nimposition and the taxes or the contribution of grain to the Soviet Union was quite\ndifferent than before, and he couldn\u2019t hire the \u2014 as many people as he did before.\nNovember 1, 2009",
        "A: No, no, as a matter of fact, 1t was quite nice. You know, I \u2014 I went to school freer; I\nwas not as fearful. I don\u2019t know what to be fearful, I couldn\u2019t tell you specifically, but\nit felt that the police was more on the Jewish side. As a matter of fact, one of my\nmother\u2019s brutha \u2014 brothers, which h-he is in the photograph, he served on the police\nforce as a consultant for awhile. So, that never happened before. No Jew would ever s-\nserve in government or a thing like that before the war. And one of my cousins \u2014 well,\nthat was maybe before the war, he tested so high in school that they were going to send\nhim to a high school in Borschev and that never happened in Korolowka before, that\na Jewish boy would go to a Polish high school.",

But what happened, the Jewish community would get\npapers, a month or two months old, from Lvov or Krakow, or sometimes even from\nthe United States, and that\u2019s how they sort of got their news. The best news, if\nanybody got the London paper, or the other English, or other foreign papers, which\ncould have been six months old, I don\u2019t know, but it was old papers, you know, that\nwe got the news. But somehow, when \u2014 when in May or June, when the schism\nNovember 1, 2009\nbetween Russia and Germany came about, everybody knew immediately what was\nhappening. And I don\u2019t know how.",
        "A: Well, we were immediately aware because the soldiers walked through, the German\nsoldiers walked through the town. And I was watching them walk through, you see, so\njust marching, and everybody was happy and laughing. But everybody in town knew\nthat something terrible was going to happen, because a few months before, there were\na lot of people from Silesia running to the Russian borders, and wa \u2014 and that was\neven before the war, before 1941, and there were some people that stayed with us in\nour house, because any \u2014 you have to offer hospitality to any strangers that c-come\nthrough the town. And there were quite a few different couples that \u2014 or families that\nstayed in different houses, and I remember them staying in our house.",

And I don\u2019t remember any Ukraine family, even the\npeople that worked for my father [indecipherable] at least I don\u2019t remember my father\ntalking. Now that you mention it, I don\u2019t know, maybe some of those memories will\ncome back, but I don\u2019t remember it as of right now. I don\u2019t remember any Ukraine\nfamily or Polish family being happy on what was happening. Even as much as they\nhated the Russians, I don\u2019t remember anyone coming over and saying that they\u2019re\nhappy the Germans are there. The only people that I remember being happy is the\npolice force. They hired immediately \u2014 there was a new police force, and they were\nhappy, a-and they looked \u2014 went with their batons quite co \u2014 a-around, and everybody\nwas in their houses when the police went through town.

I don\u2019t know when it was, whether\nit was before the first pogrom in Korol\u00e9wka, or when, but my father\u2019s older sister had\nthree boys. And I told you one of the boys was this genius type who was going to go to\nhigh school for the first year. And I think 1t was sometimes before the first pogrom that\nthey asked for young boys as laborers, and they would go to the committee and the\ncommittee would provide. And I think two of my cousins were taken as laborers and I\nthink that they were sent either to Lvov or to Belzec, or \u2014 I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t remember when it was put on, whether when \u2014 after the first pogrom,\nI think, when we went to the ghetto, we had to \u2014 or maybe \u2014 maybe before. I\u2019m not\ntotally sure when we \u2014 we \u2014 we didn\u2019t wear yellow stars, we wore white stars, white\narmbands, and the white armband supposed to be pressed and very designating. And if\nit wasn\u2019t, you were taken off to labor camp, and so people had plastic, white plastic\nthings with elastic, and then the Jewish star, so the \u2014 the \u2014 the band was very neat and\nclear. And that I remember. And I always wanted to know where they got those plastic\nbands, and I didn't dare ask anybody, and I still think about it, yeah, 70 years later.",
        "A: Yeah, that was the first pogrom of 1942, it was during the Jewish holiday, or just as\nthe Jewish hol \u2014 or the first day of the Jew \u2014 it was sometimes in September, or\nwhenever the Jewish holiday was at that year.\nNovember 1, 2009",
        "A: Well, let me tell you before. Before, my father\u2019s family s \u2014 I told you we knew\nwhat was happening and my cousins were sent off to labor camp. And so \u2014 so that was\nbefore my cousins, I think, were sent to labor camp. I\u2019m not sure exactly, but my mo \u2014\nmy father\u2019s two sisters, their families, they had three boys, one had two, one was a\nhardware store manager, he had his own little hardware and another family on his side\ndug a bunker in my aunt\u2019s \u2014 my aunt\u2019s backyard. And there was a little outhouse, and\nunder the outhouse we dug \u2014 they dug the \u2014 the bunker that could hold 20 people, or\nthereabouts. So, that summer, before the first pogrom, or that actually was even before\nthe summer, because the earth was soft, so we already knew what was happening. I\ndidn\u2019t know, but them digging a bunker for no particular reason how to camouflage, so\nmy father and family knew what was going to happen.",
        "A: N-No. It was a big hole under. You\u2019d go through the outhouse, in the outhouse\nyou'd leave the door open, so nobody would go into the outhouse. But underneath\nyou'd lift it up like going down a cellar and you\u2019d go into the bunker. But here, this \u2014\nthose marvelous people who dug the dunk \u2014 bunker, didn\u2019t dig a \u2014 for air to come in.\nThey thought the air would come in through the wood cracks in the entrance. So when\nNovember 1, 2009\nwe got into the bunker, there was no air. But that \u2014 Pll tell you that \u2014 what happened a\nlittle bit later.",
        "A: Okay, so there was the ha \u2014 all that summer, everybody was apprehensive and on\nthe lookout. So, if anything happened, our house was, here is the town, our semicircle\nof a town \u2014 is it okay?",
        "A: Let me take this pen, and Ill draw you a picture. Here are two roads into the town,\nand here are the houses, right here. And my house is right here.",
        "A: Okay. And my house is right here. And this road goes all the way to Borschev. So\nif you look out from my house, you can so \u2014 see the hill. So, 1t was a Saturday\nmorning.

And he calls me, he sees the trucks, and he s \u2014 calls me and he says, Fanci, go\naround and tell that the Germans are coming. We\u2019ll see you there in a bit, in a little\nwhile. Run. And I went, and they ran into the bunker.\nNovember 1, 2009",
        "A: Prepared to \u2014 whoever was there. I don\u2019t know if my aunt and her husband, because\ntheir houses were a little bit away, but my younger \u2014 my \u2014 my father\u2019s younger sister,\nher children. The bunker was full. And my extended family, they had a baby, about a\n18 months old baby. And wasn\u2019t a baby, but it was a baby in terms of the comfort level\nof being in the bunker. Anyways, we are in the bunker for about an hour, and\neverybody\u2019s squishing back and not saying a word, and if somebody said, everybody\nwould say sshh. And the baby starts crying, and wouldn\u2019t stop. And the Germans came\ninto the backyard and they didn\u2019t have to look for anything, they heard the baby cry.\nSo it \u2014 they found all of us in the bunker. So, when I went to my aunt\u2019s, my father and\nmother were not there with me, they didn\u2019t catch up with me, they hid someplace e-\nelse, I \u2014 I assumed, after it was over. So, the Germans came and took everybody to the\nbig common. There was a common right here, green grass, a common right here and\nthey put everybody in this common.",
        "A: Including me. And at one point when we taking out of the bunker, m-my uncle tried\nto run away and the German pulled him back and almost bra \u2014 broke his shoulder.\nAnyways, we all went there to the big common.",
        "A: No, [ll tell you about \u2014 my \u2014 both my parents, my father went in a different\ndirection, he went, and my mother ran into a hiding place of a neighbor up in the thing.\nNovember 1, 2009\nAnd he-her house was right here in front of this common with all the people. So when\nthe trucks came to take everybody, that was about 10:30, 11 o\u2019clock, because I \u2014 you\nknow, you \u2014 ye \u2014 you knew \u2014 so, it was sometimes in the morning. So, everybody was\nscreaming, and everybody, you know, they were families, hold my hand, don\u2019t run\naway, stay with me. And nobody said to me, hold my hand. There was no mother or\nfather that was holding onto me. So, instead, I wasn\u2019t going to go in that truck and\nevery \u2014 and there was so much confusion and screaming and crying, that I ran away, I\nran this way, behind the monument. And there was a pharmacy here, and I ran behind\nthe pharmacy, and once I was out of sight, I ran into the fields, and I escaped.",
        "A: About nine, maybe. Eight or nine. It was in 1943, let\u2019s say even 10, but probably\nnine.",
        "A: Of course, nobody 1s alive. And at night, I don\u2019t remember exactly when I went\nback to my house, but I found my mother with my two younger brothers, ha \u2014 they\nwere hiding. My father came back from the fields, he was hiding. And we were a\nfamily again.",
        "A: My father\u2019s younger sister, where I ran to, she couldn\u2019t stay in the bunker either, so\nshe left the bunker and she \u2014 and she fell on the floor and put a blanket over her and\nNovember 1, 2009\nthe Germans came and looked and she even had stuff thrown in [indecipherable] and\nthey didn\u2019t realize that she was there, but she survived. And a month after the pogrom,\nmy ti\u2014\nEnd of Tape One\nNovember 1, 2009\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: Ah, can I say something about this \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 second introduction. My name is Feiga Connors, but if you put in that\nHollenberg in the middle, it\u2019s just very important.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "A: Well, it was \u2014 it was \u2014 first of all, everybody said, who\u2019s here? We didn\u2019t ask how\nwe survived, but I remember my brothers holding my hands, so I didn\u2019t even get to my\nparents and my brothers were just four and seven, or something, or three. I mean, they\ndidn\u2019t know what was happ \u2014 I mean, they were kids, so \u2014 but the intensity of losing\neverything, and also what happened. The town was empty. Almost everybody was\nNovember 1, 2009\ntaken away. I use that euphemism, taken away, and I use the euphemism, I-I lost my\nfamily in the war, because in my heart, noth \u2014 every \u2014 that picture of my town and\nhome 1s static. So \u2014 and that also gives me excuse, I don\u2019t have to talk about anything,\nif things are the same. But the whole end is what I remember as a \u2014 before I ran away.\nIt\u2019s not that I felt alone withou \u2014 without my parents, but I felt the urgency of getting\nto my parents, or getting away. And I remember standing on the hill, where the trucks\npassed me by, and feeling such a\u2014 va\u2014I got you. You didn\u2019t get me. And I felt such a\n\u2014a-\u2014a defiance. Do you know, I re \u2014 I have never felt that defiance like I did at that\nmoment. So, what happened after that first ac \u2014 as you call it aktion or pogrom or\nkilling \u2014 well, it wasn't a killing, because they were not \u2014 there were only one or two\npeople or 10 people dead, but it was a town of \u2014 of about 15 to 2500 people, and there\nwas nobody left, just a few people left, literally. So what they did after that, they send\nus into the next town, into a ghetto.",
        "A: Ah, first, I don\u2019t remember getting to the ghetto. I don\u2019t know where I was, or I\ndon\u2019t remember the trip. It\u2019s about a 10 minutes, 15 minutes \u2014 well, by car, but we\ndidn\u2019t have a car. I don\u2019t remember how we got to Borschev or ho-how the few people\ngot to Borschev. But what I remember is we getting into Borschev and there is a room\nwaiting for us, so it means that my father or somebody went ahead and \u2014 and there was\na place for us to stay.\nNovember 1, 2009",
        "A: Okay. It was \u2014 1n Borschev we got there right after the holiday, the end of\nSeptember, October, so 1t wasn\u2019t cold yet. There was no school. There was no labor.\nWe \u2014 my father must have \u2014 ho-how they found people to hide things, and \u2014 and oh, I\nremember too, when we closed up our house, when we left Korol6wka, my mom\ngiving things to people, and putting them in with Ukraines and Polish people for\nhiding, so we can use that either money, or linen or dishes or silver, all sorts of things,\nusing that during the war as to get food. How they did it and what, I don\u2019t remember.\nAnd so I remember sa \u2014 us getting \u2014 finding [indecipherable] and there were five\npeople; us, and my father\u2019s sister was with us at that time, she is the one that survived,\ntoo. And then a month later, how we lived. I was the one that, because I didn\u2019t look\nJewish, I was the one that went to the market to bring home food. I was the only one\nthat could leave the \u2014 the ghetto to get food.",
        "A: No, somehow I had money, and I would go to the market and give money a-a \u2014 and\nfor [indecipherable] and pick out what I wanted, and give the money and walk away,\nand, you know, just like what everybody does. So I did the market thing on a regular\nbasis. I don\u2019t know what my two younger brothers did with their time, or me with my\nNovember 1, 2009\ntime. It was \u2014 we were very good, nobody ever complained. I don\u2019t remember \u2014 I used\nto fight with my brothers, I don\u2019t remember one fight in the ghetto. Not that they were\nangels, but I don\u2019t even remember them.",
        "A: And \u2014 and I told you that there was a baby that was born in the ghetto. I don\u2019t\nremember even my mother pregnant. I wasn\u2019t aware. She must have gotten pregnant at\nhome and gotten to the ghetto, because we left in October, and the baby was born in\nFebruary. So, she must have been pregnant, and I don\u2019t remember any such a thing.\nAll I remember is that we were all in the same room, me and my brother and\neverybody, when my mother had her baby, in the same room. There was a midwife.\nSo, again, how they procured the midwife, how they got the mid \u2014 I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: And was a baby boy. And what I remember about the baby boy, we were all happy,\nI remember that. And I remember we all saying, well, we don\u2019t have to worry about\nnaming him, we have so many names to choose, because you name your baby after \u2014\nwell, after dead people. So my ba \u2014 so, in order to honor the people, we wer \u2014 so, we\nnamed my baby brother with certain names, know? And we \u2014 there was a bris. I\nremember somebody coming there, to that room. But I don\u2019t remember. I remember\nmy mother being fearful of the bris.\nNovember 1, 2009",
        "A: He was named Mendel. He was named \u2014 I forgot the other names, but I remember\nseven names [indecipherable] out, to honor the people, that they were \u2014 they were\ncousins, brothers. Some we didn\u2019t totally know that were dead, but we \u2014 my father told\nme, you know, wrote it down very clearly.",
        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014 he \u2014 we all stayed in the room all the time, but I don\u2019t remember seeing\nhim. So, I don\u2019t remember what it is that anybody did, you know, as an occupation. I\nhave no idea. And I know there was no school, there was no \u2014 before we had private\ntutoring, and all that stuff. If somebody didn\u2019t go to this school, they \u2014 they had all\nsorts of things, so schooling was an important thing. But I don\u2019t remember. And the\nother thing, just to summarize, we were in that ghetto, not for very long. So we were in\nthe ghetto from October \u2014 September, October, til the summertime, June, July. So it\nwas about eight or nine months. So, what happened in the ghetto, that every month or\ntwo, there was [knocking] \u2014 somebody at the door.",
        "A: Okay. My name is Feiga Hollenberg Connors, and today is October \u2014",
        "A: Korolowka.",
        "A: Okay. After my brother was born, he was born a \u2014 e \u2014 February \u2014 the end of\nFebruary, and then there was a pogrom around Purim. [tape noise|\nOctober 8, 2010\ninto the ghetto, and you talked about the birth of your baby brother, and what life was\nlike in the ghetto during that first month or two. Let\u2019s pick up the interview at this\npoint, and can you describe \u2014 I understand that things changed a lot as of March of\n1943.",
        "A: Right. So, we moved Korol\u00e9wka, we came Judenfrei after the major cleaning out\nof Korolowka and taking everybody away, and the people that were left were sent to\nthe bigger ghetto in Borschev. And we first lived in one building, then we moved to\nanother building. And my mom had a baby, I think the baby was stillborn in the o-\nother building before we moved to this building number two. And, he was a little boy.\nAnd he \u2014 and I remember him being born, and the midwife in the room, and all of us,\nmy mom, my dad, my two younger brothers and my aunt were all in the room while\nmy mom gave birth to the baby. And \u2014 and there was a bris, there was \u2014 the next day,\nor a few days later. So the ghetto had all the Jewish, the rabbis, everybody was there.",
        "A: No, it wa \u2014 first of all, it was fear, not just for the baby\u2019s survival, but for the\nadults\u2019 survival, what would happen with a pogrom, with the killings, that we have to\ngo into hiding. So we already knew that he might not sur \u2014 I mean, we knew that we\nwere all in major danger, so I think, now that you mention it, that was probably one of\nthe reason that we moved from building number one to building number two, because\nOctober 8, 2010\nthere was a little bit more liberty, or people didn\u2019t say we won\u2019t allow the baby in the\n\u2014 in the bunker. Because every building had a bunker, and in building number one, the\nbunker was between the two houses, so it was a wall was walled off, and we\u2019d crawl\ninto a s \u2014 into a small place to get into th \u2014 this wall. And in building number two, the\none that we moved, the bunker was in the cellar. So when the killing began, everybody\nwent into the \u2014 to the building, that was during the Purim massacre, and \u2014 and they\ndidn\u2019t allow the baby to come in with us. He was, by then, four or five weeks old, he\nwas still tiny. And you know \u2014 and I know he was tiny in \u2014 in the recollection of what\nhe did, he was just lying there, he cou \u2014 you know, he couldn\u2019t even smile yet. So he\nwas very tiny. And so we all went into \u2014 into the bunker in the cellar, and we couldn\u2019t\nbring the baby, so we left the baby on a big bed, surrounded with pillows. And my\nmom was crying and they kept holding her down. And we stayed there, I don\u2019t\nremember how long, but we stayed there til it was almost dark, you know, from the\nmorning. And when we got upstairs we found the baby dead. But not just this, the\nbaby\u2019s cries were so loud, that the baby jeopardized the people next door, who were\nhiding in that compartment in between the walls, between one wall and another. So\nhere were the people, here were the two \u2014 you know, and the cry from this bed \u2014 from\nthis room to the \u2014 the police, it \u2014 this was not \u2014 this massacre wasn\u2019t a German\nmassacre, it was the Ukraine police and the German and the Poles that did it. So it\nOctober 8, 2010\nwasn\u2019t primarily the German Gestapo like when they cleaned out Korolowka, like in\nthe first pogrom. So this was a kind of cobr \u2014 co-cooperation with everybody.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know anybody, and I don\u2019t recollect anybody knowing of retur \u2014 you\nknow, being friendly. I knew one of my cousins worked for the Ukraine police, and\none time I went to the market and the police caught me, and my cousin came and sort\nof rescued me in the poli \u2014 the Ukraine police let me go because of my cousin.",
        "A: That \u2014 everything was \u2014 that was in Borschev in the ghetto, a \u2014 a few weeks after \u2014\nafter the \u2014 the massacre. But \u2014 so, to finish the story with that \u2014 with that massacre o-\non y \u2014 on Purim, after it was over, we went upstairs and we saw the baby dead. And\nthe next day, or maybe it was even the same day, there was a cart with a horse, and\nwould drive by each building and people would put their dead on this cart. And my\nmother was so upset and crying that I took the baby, she gave me the baby, or I took\nthe baby \u2014 anyways, I took the baby out and put the baby wrapped up in a blanket, on\nthe cart. So I don\u2019t even know where the baby was buried.\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah. Nobody in those situation would \u2014 none of the Ukraines or the Poles\nwere just too good, nobody would do any cleaning, everything had to be done by Jews.\nAnd then during Passover a month later, there was the big massacre, where they\nrounded up hundreds of people and they shot them in the Borschev massacre. And\nthey lined them up and they shot all the people. I\u2014 I might be confusing a little bit\nbecause of such a long time, whether it was just at the Purim massacre, or the \u2014 or the\n\u2014 or \u2014 or the one just before Passover, where they lined up hundreds, everybody in\nBorschev and they shot them in the big grave. And again, this wasn\u2019t just a German \u2014\na German there with the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the Ukraine police with their shooting. And that\ngrave, it\u2019s still there, but what I recollect, maybe that\u2019s a childhood memory, was that\nthe grave itself was very long. It was about \u2014 longer than this house, which is this \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know how long. Well, anyways, it was almost a half a block long. And when I\nwent to market pe \u2014 the \u2014 the peasants were talking about the grave, how it was\nbubbling and the \u2014 and the blood was just going up and down, bluh, bluh, bluh. So I\nwent to the grave, and wanted to see it, to the Jewish cemetery and wanted to see the\ngrave itself. And sure enough, it wasn\u2019t as strong as the first day, but still, you can see\nthe heave of the grave, kind of, just the moving of the grave. And \u2014 and I let it be, and\nthere \u2014 one of the Sturmers(ph) \u2014 the people, the wife of Mr. Sturmer(ph), her name\nwas Chana(ph), she said to me, she says, I just want you to remember that I saw you\nin a blue coat, walking around, and I saw where you were coming from, which means\nOctober 8, 2010\nthe direction of the cemetery. So, do you know, I always thought that that was just a\nmemory kind of thing that I remembered kind of, and wouldn\u2019t say it til anybody til 50\n- 60 years later, Chana(ph) Sturmer(ph) affirmed my memory. So, I don\u2019t mean I was\nhappy, but it was like the memories were really memories, because I didn\u2019t talk much\nabout the Holocaust or anything like that, 1t was just like 1t was unshared. It was\nsomething that I knew, and it was mine. And to have somebody say, I saw from where\n\u2014 you know, in this blue coat, and all of a sudden, I remember the blue coat, and it was\nunbelievable. But after that big massacre, there were not that many Jews left in the\nBorschev ghetto.",
        "A: Or thereabouts, I\u2019m not \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 totally sure.\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: No, they were \u2014 they were just talking like it was an [indecipherable] for them. It\nwas an unbelievable situation. None of them were happy, you know, was a happy -\u2014 it\nwas a market where people come on Thursday to do their business, you know. So, it\nwasn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it was Thursday; in Korolowka market day was a Thursday,\nin Borschev [ don\u2019t remember exactly. But anyways, it was \u2014 it was \u2014 people just were\ntalking in wonderment, and si \u2014 and really trying to look to scripture for affirmation\nthat those things will happen, and therefore they are happening. I mean, that\u2019s what I\nheard. That\u2019s why the complete amazement of what happened, and how it was actually\nthe \u2014 most of the peasants were really scared that such a thing could affect them\nforever, you know, in terms of the crops and \u2014 and the growth in the fields, and things\nlike that. So there was also a certain amount of wonderment and fear, and it was like,\ndid you see this? Tremendous wonderment. And \u2014 and one of the reasons that, all\nthose years later, 68 years, I want, before my time is up, I really wanted the kids to see\nthat grave. And it was nothing what I saw, and what I remember a-and felt, and never\ntalked about.",
        "A: The big ma \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 we were hiding. It was still in the same old cellar, in same\nhouse, but after that was over, there was rumors of sending the Jews to another place\nafter this massacre, and we knew what other places they were. So \u2014 so here you have\nPassover in the spring, and by May and June, we were looking for a place. My father\nOctober 8, 2010\nwent back to Korolowka to see if we could hide, if we could find somebody to hide\nus. And then in May, the end of May or the beginning of June of 1943, we left\nBorschev as a family, and went into hiding in Korolowka.",
        "A: The ghetto was not closed in, it was not \u2014 it was an open ghetto. The \u2014 the thing,\nthe Jews lived in the ghetto because there was no other place to live. So di \u2014 you didn\u2019t\nneed a gate or anything to close it in. There was an ordinance that nobody was allowed\nin or out of the ghetto except Jews. So, being non-Jewish looking and 10 years old, I\nwas the one that would go in and out of the ghetto with no complication except once.\nSo I did the marketing for, you know, people would give me whatever, and I would do\nthe marketing for our family and for people around us. So that\u2019s how I-I \u2014 I left. There\nwas no \u2014 no gate or electric stuff or anything like that.",
        "A: A-And nobody would \u2014 no Jew would dare live outside the prescribed area\nanyways, because that meant \u2014 so no matter how much you complied, it didn\u2019t make\nany difference, you died sooner or later.",
        "A: No, no, we left about 10 o\u2019clock in the daytime so we\u2019d have enough \u2014 because\nBorschev walking is a long ways, and so we wanted to make sure that we had enough\nlight when we \u2014 we didn\u2019t get to Korolowka, we got to some peasants house, and\nOctober 8, 2010\nfrom there they hid 1n the forest. And \u2014 and so w-we were six people, my fam \u2014 my\nmother, father, my two brothers and myself and my aunt, who survived from the big \u2014\nfrom the Korolowka killings. And we went into the forest, and there were two or three\nother peop \u2014 families that we met up for it. We didn\u2019t know, but we met up with it.\nAnd by, I think August, the \u2014 the Ukraine police found out, and they were just two or\nthree police, and they came into the forest and start shooting indiscriminately. And\nsomehow my father and I and my brother escaped, and my aunt was shot in the heart\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, by then we were sleeping in the open air, you know, in the forest. And it was\nsummer, so there was no \u2014 and \u2014 and there was a stream in the forest, so we had water\nfrom the stream. My father went and got food for us. And then \u2014 I can\u2019t remember\nnow exactly whether my mother and my younger brother left us, and I can\u2019t remember\n\u2014 she \u2014 she felt she would find a safer place. That if we divide, we would have a better\nchance of survival, and finding a place. So my father took me and my brother, and my\nmother went with my younger brother, Bunion. And my father and I and my brother\nHaskell sur \u2014 went with my father. We stayed in forest a little longer after my aunt\nwas shot. Actually, maybe two days longer. My mother left. But I\u2019m not totally sure if\nshe left before my aunt was killed, or after my aunt was killed.\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: I\u2014I don\u2019t remember y \u2014 feeling of reflection or sadness. I don\u2019t remember when\nmy brother died, when the tiny baby died, or anything saying what a terrible thing just\nhappened to us. I remember that I was glad that whoever was with me was with me. It\nwas not in terms of the loss that I remember feeling sad, 1t was that I was there with\nsomebody. And if we wait it out, you know, just like they did, out the massacres, or\nlike in Korolowka, where the first massacre occurred and they put everybody on the \u2014\non the trucks, and every \u2014 and then the trucks came and everybody cried, hold my\nhand, hold my hand. And because my parents were not with me, nobody said to me,\nhold my hand, so I ran away. And that sense that I had some control and could run\naway, whether I went marketing, or whether I \u2014 I went to the grave to look at the\nfeeling, the sense that I could do something for me, and for whoever was next to my\nbody, you know. And I wanted everybody to be next to my body. And when they\nweren't there, the first part was the emptiness, the feeling of all empty, alone. You\nknow, it\u2019s just like when you go camping, and then nobody \u2014 you know, the other kids\ngo into the water, and you\u2019re still on the shore. It was a kind of unreal feeling, and it\nwas a kind of feeling that, if I don\u2019t feel th \u2014 a true feeling about it, everything will\ncome back. It will just go back to where it was. I don\u2019t know if I make sense, I\u2019m\nSOITY.\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: No. No, no. What I remember, is my father put my head down and my brother, and\nwe crawled on our be-belly out from the area were, and we went out of the forest into\nthe field. There was a cornfield or some kind of field, and we were there. And when\nwe se \u2014 heard, when the shots were fired, and stopped firing, we stayed there for a\nlittle while longer, but we knew that they left.

        "A: Til it got dark. \u2019'm not totally sure, but I know that we were in a village where we\nhad land. I think I told you we were farmers and we had lots of land. So, ar \u2014 we \u2014 we\nalways used the farmers, the peasants and the farmers to work for us. So my father\nknew almost everybody in the village \u2014 in the \u2014 in Korolowka and surrounding\nKorol\u00e9wka. So, the \u2014 we left the forest, and that was still hot, so 1t might have been\nJuly.\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: Not in the \u2014 yeah, well, my father went and got some food, so he must have gone\nthere. But when we left \u2014 we paid everybody, by the way, nobody gave us, gave us,\nbut we paid, either in goods, we had some goods in \u2014 1n \u2014 with one farmer who gave\nus, you know, like \u2014 like pots and pans or bedding, or whatever, or whatever there\nwas, we had some goods with one person. And my father went and got some of the\ngoods to give it to anot \u2014 to give it to whoever gave us food and let us sleep over. So\nwe always paid, but the payment was nothing in comparison to be allowed to stay out\nof the rain, or out of the \u2014 oh, specially in October of \u201943 to \u00b044, when it was cold,\nwhen we found a woman who kept us i-i \u2014 f-f \u2014 til February 28\".",
        "A: Well, my father probably knew. She was an old woman, and I don\u2019t know how he\nfound her, but h-he \u2014 we paid her to stay through the months, and we paid her quite\nwell.",
        "A: Sh-\u2014 we hid in the \u2014 in the barn. She had the \u2014 the \u2014 the hay, you know, for the\nwinter, and all the f-food that you accumulate through \u2014 you know, the way a farmer\naccumulates th-the wheats and the cornhusks and all that. And we stayed hidden under\nthe \u2014 under the \u2014 the \u2014 the wheat, you know, the \u2014\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: She brought us food every night and it was potato and water. Three and a half\npotatoes and water every night, sometimes four potatoes.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: And left. And \u2014 and she had to do it, she had neighbors on each side, so she had to\ndo it dis \u2014 very discreetly.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t even know the woman\u2019s name. There was one time \u2014 and we stayed\nfrom \u2014 from October, on \u2014 or November til February 28\" of 1944. So we stayed there\nfor a long time.",
        "A: We just sat there. And me and my brother would sometimes whisper. We couldn\u2019t\ntalk, whisper, h-how \u2014 what we would do with food, and how happy we would be, and\nof the memories, how things will be as soon as this was over.",
        "A: Yeah, my father was between me and my brother. And one time toward the end, I \u2014\nI got very peculiar [indecipherable] with the end. I don\u2019t know why, it was night and I\nscreamed and I said I didn\u2019t care if I died, and I hope we all die today, and it was just\nnot worth. And I felt so sorry afterwards.\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: But my brother, who was two years younger than me, he was just so brave, he\nnever, never complained. I \u2014 I one time lost my temper with everybody, and my father\nfelt so helpless, he didn\u2019t know what to do. So my brother tried to talk to me. My\nfather felt that 1f nobody said anything I would calm down, which, that was what\nhappened.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: Lying and sitting. As a matter of fact, we had to sit close by because you don\u2019t want\nto make a big space under the \u2014 under the wheat, you know, uh, what is it called? The\nbrush, whatever. And you don\u2019t want to make a big space, because if anybody comes\nin, it has to look like nobody is there.",
        "A: Well, toward the end, I think, 1n \u2014 either the end of January or the beginning of the\nFebruary, we her \u2014 we heard somebody coming in, but we didn\u2019t know who it was,\nand they left. And so, what happened, on February 28\" is, there was a snowstorm. It\nstarted early on, and the woman who kept us, asked us to leave. And when we got up\nto walk, stand up, it was hard, but what happened to me 1s I became very bloated. My\nOctober 8, 2010\nfeet were just so bloated. But anyways, we put on \u2014 and the clothes that I ha \u2014 because\nI was so bloated, just didn\u2019t fit. But anyways, w-we did leave, and \u2014",
        "A: There\u2019s no question ah \u2014 she says, you have to leave. And we didn\u2019t question too\nmuch, or I didn\u2019t hear any discussion, let\u2019s put it that way. Maybe my father talked,\nbut th-there was no time that anybody sat down and talked with her, because then the\nneighbors would know what\u2019s going on. So here we were in the hiding place, and she\ndelivered th-the food at night and she said, you have to leave tomorrow. And so there\nwas no discussion, can you keep us a day longer, or anything, cause the \u2014 we didn\u2019t, at\nthe same time, we didn't want to give the place away, we didn't want to give ourselves\naway 1-1f anybody heard. So, we \u2014 we had to leave, so it was very obedient and very\nquiet, with no \u2014 no discussion. She said we had to leave, I don\u2019t remember my father\neven saying anything else. So we left, and in \u2014 and the s \u2014 and the snow was very high.\nYou know, in my part of the world the snow gets \u2014 and the cold gets cold, and the\nsnow gets very high. And so, for me to pick my feet up and down, I just couldn\u2019t do it,\nso we got to one place, and I just couldn't \u2014 and my father said that, if you just walk\njust a little while longer to this place, I'll see if you can stay there, so your body will\ncalm down. So we got to this one family \u2014 actually, there were two families, there was\nwa \u2014 one man and his wife lived in one side of the house and one woman, the other\none, lived in the other side. And so we got there at night and \u2014 and my fa \u2014 and my\nOctober 8, 2010\nfather begged the man to keep me. I think that was a kine \u2014 either Friday night or\nSaturday night \u2014 to keep me overnight and he\u2019|I come back for me the next day, and he\npromised him he would. And they knew each other, because you know, people worked\nfor us. So I was left there, and then the next day was either Saturday or Sunday,\nanyways, it was February 28\". Peasants come to that house. They must have known\nwe were there because the footprints were all over, because of the big snow. And I\nheard people saying that my father and my brother were killed, and put in the \u2014 in the\ngrotto. And the \u2014 the grotto has this big hole, this \u2014 the grotto where the\n[indecipherable] were hiding, and they put them there. And they said that the\nwoman\u2019s son-in-law, the woman that was hiding us for three months, her son-in-law\nkilled us \u2014 killed my father and my brother.",
        "A: Well, he was the woman\u2019s son-in-law, so she had a daughter who had a husband,\nand the person that came in, I was telling you there was only one person we heard\ncoming into the barn, must have been the son-in-law sort of teasing us. And he must\nhave demanded from the woman to throw us out. And his name was Mucha, m-u-c-h-\na, which in Ukraine means fly. And I don\u2019t know if it was his last name or it was his\nnickname, but that was his name. And \u2014 and those people that my father\u2019s supposed to\ncome, they \u2014 they kept me, and because the Russians were back and forth for the last\nweek or two. And a month later, on March 28\", the Russian occupied the whole\nOctober 8, 2010\nterritory. So, this son-in-law, Mucha, must have known that the Russians were on the\nborder, or were within 150 miles of whatever, because there was \u2014 back and forth they\nwould progress, then they had to step back, then they \u2014 and so they were very close to\nKorol\u00e9wka. And so he must have known, so that\u2019s why he decided to make it unify.\nAnd so, when I went back in July of 209, and I asked about this person, nobody\nseemed to know about him. So, the anti-Semitism, and the quietness, who did what, is\nvery, very strong today, in 209.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: 12 or\u2014or-\u2014no, right, 11. \u00b044, right.",
        "A: \u201944, yeah.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: Well, that was the thing. I \u2014 I thought my mother was alive, and I never thought of\nmyself as an orphan either, because an orphan means that somebody is dead. Although\nOctober 8, 2010\nI know that my father and brother are dead, somehow, because I didn\u2019t see it, they\nwere not dead. So, it was a word, and it didn\u2019t apply to me at all. As a matter of fact,\nthrough the whole 60 some years since \u201965 \u2014 eight years, I still have the fantasy that\nmy mother is alive, waiting for me. And my granddaughter, who is eight years old,\nwho 1s about that, you know, 10 years old, and I was saying to my son and his family,\nI said, gee, I\u2019m really afraid to go back. And my granddaughter Meagan said, but what\nif your mother stands in front of the door and is waiting for you? And that was the\nsame fantasy that I had. She didn't tell me anything new, and that\u2019s exa \u2014 exactly how I\nfeel, that she 1s still, you know. So, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m [indecipherable] teach on that,\nfrom grandmother to granddaughter, or whatever. But that was \u2014 and also when I think\nof home, I don\u2019t think of myself as a 78 year \u2014 78 year old woman, I think of myself as\n10 and 11 and 14 and 15 years old.",
        "A: Yeah. I \u2014 when the Russians came back, just what I did all the other times,\nwhenever \u2014 after the first killing of, we all went back to the same place to see who\nsurvived. And all the people in Korol6wka went back to Korol\u00e9wka and \u2014 and \u2014 and\nfirst of all, my house, or the whole of Korol\u00e9wka, all the Jewish houses were\ndestroyed, so it \u2014 there wouldn\u2019t be any Jewish house left. The only thing that was left\nwas the synagogue and the Jewish cemetery, that\u2019s all that was left.\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: And the pharmacy, and the pharmacy.",
        "A: Well, I found an uncle and aunt, my mother\u2019s brother. My mother\u2019s brother and his\nwife, they were hiding someplace else. And I stayed with them, and we left\nKorol\u00e9wka, and \u2014 oh, we moved to Borschev. And my uncle served in the army for \u2014\nin the Russian army. And then we left. We \u2014 we left Borschev in \u201945, as soon as the\nwar was over, and we went to Germany, and I was \u2014 we were all in a displace \u2014",
        "A: All three of us. And I signed up to come to the United States, and came in \u201947, and\n\u2014 1947 in August, and \u2014 and \u2014 and came to New York, and \u2014 and I think you have\nsome of the pictures at the museum, of the \u2014 of the place, the DP camp that we stayed.\nAnd \u2014 and then \u2014",
        "A: No, they wouldn\u2019t allow them to come to \u2014 to the United States, so I could come\non the children\u2019s visa, and there was, from U.N. all one \u2014 U.S. something, a Mrs.\nBrown. She was, I think must have been a social worker. She was just so nice, she\ntalked so polite. And I wasn't sure of my birth date, and my birth \u2014 and I\u2014I know I\nwas born in March, but I wasn\u2019t sure. She said, and what month would you like? And I\nloved my little brother, and he was born in May. So I said, I think I was born in March,\nbut I love May, because the way I held on to my family is remembering things about\nOctober 8, 2010\nthem, not as much about me. So, if I remember all those little things about them, they\nwere never \u2014 they never died, you know. So she said, oh, May 1s a lovely month, how\nabout May? So we put down May 28\", but I\u2019m not totally sure of my birth date. We\nhave a\u2014 and one of the reasons too, I went back in \u2014 in July of 209, is another person\ntold me they went back and they found their birth date in the school records, and I\nwent for one year to school. I said, oh, I must go back and see if they have the record.\nAnd of course, that wasn\u2019t true.",
        "A: Oh, no, no. They took the children to a \u2014 oh, I should have written down the name\nof the places \u2014 to the Bronx. Oh, I want to say \u2014 anyways, it was a \u2014 an orphagenage,\nand then the Jewish Family and Children Service asked the kids where they want \u2014\nsome of them had relatives in New York, some of the \u2014 and, of course, every \u2014 I\nwanted to stay in New York. And the reason was, in case anything happened, I could\ntake a boat right back. So, there was this lady, another very nice person, and said, well,\nwhere would you like to go? There\u2019s a pl \u2014 Jewish Family and Children right now,\nChicago or Boston. And so I said, well, is Boston on the coast, you know. Yes, it is.\nSo I went to Boston, and the Jewish and Family and Children\u2019s Service took me in,\nand they found adoptive families for me, and they found very nice families and they\nwanted to adopt me so badly. There was a Mrs. Wachs(ph) and Morris Wachs(ph),\nOctober 8, 2010\nhe was a soldier in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in Germany. And \u2014 and they were so nice, they had no\nchildren. And I just couldn\u2019t be adopted, because you see, I had all those birthdays and\nall those little things in my heart, that I didn't tell anybody. And so I couldn\u2019t be\nadopted. S-So I remember one time, it was another nice family that I don\u2019t know, they\ndi \u2014 I don\u2019t think they wanted to adopt me, but anyways, I sort of ran away from them\nan-and ended up at the harbor when the agency found me. So they found a \u2014 a \u2014a very\nnice overnight school for ma \u2014 for me, called the Windsor Mountain School in Lenox,\nand it\u2019s a high school. And I went there, and it was the most marvelous, beautiful place\nfor me, because I was among kids who were kids in this school, and I didn\u2019t have to\ngive loyalty to somebody that \u2014 that wasn\u2019t mine. Do y \u2014 do you understand? I didn't\nhave to love anybody except from sheer goodwill. So I was in this beautiful school that\nsaved my soul. You know, maybe coming to the United States saved my life, but that\nschool saved my soul. And also, what I discovered is books and reading. And so, after\nI graduate, I applied for scholarships, got scholarships. Oh, the first year, I was with\nthe Jewish Family Servi \u2014 there was a social worker named Edith Costa, and she took\nus to Revere beach, around here, and we had an accident, and I broke my nose\nbecause I was sitting on somebody\u2019s lap. And bingo, like this, and so I got 500 dollars\nfor the broken nose. So when I graduated high school, I applied for a scholarship and I\nhad 500 dollars, that paid for room and board, and I got scholarship. And then, when I\nOctober 8, 2010\ngraduated from \u2014 with my belach \u2014 bachelor\u2019s, I applied to the VA and got a\nscholarship to go to school of social work.",
        "A: Well, I think Mrs. Brown, the first person that was so inviting; then I had a\u2014a\nsocial worker named Mrs. Levine, who wa \u2014 who told me always, don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s\nokay, if I messed up. That\u2019s okay. And \u2014 and she \u2014 and there was a woman in\nparticular, Mrs. Carter, of the Jewish Family and Children\u2019s Service, who worked\nvery hard to get money to send kids like us to a private school. And there were other\nkids, and it was really Mrs. Carter that made the difference.",
        "A: Well, not in terms necessarily of my story, because I\u2019m telling my story 68 to 69\nyears later, as an old woman. The silence for me was not that it didn\u2019t happen, but the\nsilence for me \u2014 are you looking at \u2014",
        "A: The silence for me was to keep everything in place. And if I talk about the\nHolocaust, or missing my mother, or wanting my father so badly, and when in \u2014 and\nnot going to my own graduations, because I didn't have who I wanted, was because I\nmight lose that in my memory. That if I share those truths with somebody else, then\nthat might be taken away, too. And it was a peculiar kind of thinking. And I\u2019ve been\nOctober 8, 2010\nsort of reading more about it, and \u2014 and the kids, my own children, who run from 50 to\n40 now, really are telling me now how they wondered why they didn\u2019t have a\ngrandmother and why I never talked about it. And my husband too. And \u2014 and my\nhusband in particular felt that he wa \u2014 I was who I was, he didn\u2019t need \u2014 he knew\nenough to know, but I did-didn\u2019t have to talk about it, and the same thing his family.\nHis ma \u2014 his mom, that I like very much, my mother-in-law said, don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t hurt her\nany more. So, it was really \u2014 the thing that I think needs to be shared 1s not that I want\nto forget them, but I just need to say it. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s appropriate or not,\nbecause it\u2019s not the story",
