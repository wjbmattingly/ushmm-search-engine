        "Q: Would you tell me your name please?",
        "A: Carla Lessing.",
        "Q: Where and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Rotterdam, Holland uh on November 4th, 1929. (laughter) I have to think\nabout this.",
        "Q: Tell me about your parents, your early childhood.",
        "A: OK. Uh, let me tell you first about my father's family. They are Heijmans and most of the\nfamily uh lived in the eastern part of Holland. My father's father was Dutch and my father's\nmother was a German Jew and her name was Rosalie, and my father's father was Jacob. Uh\nthey had three children. Uh I think my father was the oldest, then my aunt who died in\nAuschwitz, and a younger brother who died of diabetes in 1922, '24 - I don't know exactly\nand his name was Herman. Uh my father met my mother in Germany and my mother is, was\na German Jew. She grew up in the western part of Germany and she was one of three. Uh\nshe was the middle child. Her older brother, Rudie, immigrated to Israel\u2019 in 1935. Uh my\nmother married my father in 1925 and moved to Holland. Uh my youngest brother, her\nyoungest...my youngest uncle, her youngest brother, immigrated in 1934 or 'S to Holland and\nhe uh studied in Germany, so there's a lot of German in my family. Uh...my parents settled in\nRotterdam uh when they got married in 1925. My brother, Herman, uh who is now called\nJohanem (ph) who lives in Israel, was born in August 1926 and I was born in November\n1929 also in Rotterdam. In 1930 they moved to the Hague to get away from my mother's in-\nlaws who were very intrusive. My father's sister had already moved away from Rotterdam\nbecause of the same reason and they moved in a little suburb near the Hague. Uh now the\nstory about my parents' financial problems are very vague because nobody told me and my\nfather died in...actually he committed suicide in 1936. Before he died, they moved from a big\nhouse in the Hague to a very small apartment or small apartment and I was sent to my\ngrandparents in Germany. My grandparents lived in Germany in Gelsenkirchen (ph). My\nbrother who was going to school at that time stayed with my parents and later on with my\nmother and I was sent away because moving and the problems so I, I was in Germany in\n1935 and 1936 as a youngster before I went to school. So there is a big difference. At that\ntime already Jews were very careful. I was a little girl and when I was on the street, my\ngrandparents would say, don't speak too loudly, uh don't hop, don't skip, uh uh don't make\nyourself noticed because there were all the Nazis around us and so at a very early age I was\nalready aware that I was different, that I was Jewish, I shouldn't be noticed, should be quiet.\n(Cough) Also my grandparents did all kinds of things to be Jews. I mean they were not\n' Palestine\nreally religious but they would go to the synagogue because they felt as a Jew you needed to\nstay together. So I had to go to the synagogue on the sabath_ and uh participate. So I went\nback to Holland probably in April, May of 1936. I spoke German at that time because I, my\ngrandparents spoke German. I came back and my mother sent me to school, kindergarten uh\nfor me to quickly pick up the Dutch and I went to kindergarten and then to first grade. I then\ncame to a new apartment because I had moved...when I left for Germany I had lived in a big\nhouse and I came to an apartment, and my father wasn't there. So...and my mother was a\nwidow and uh had a very hard time making money and so we were very poor. Uh my mother\nand my brother and I did go back and forth to Germany. For my school vacations I would go\nto Germany so my mother had some free time I guess. And so in 1936, in 1937, in 1938 I\nspent my vacations in Germany with my grandparents, and kind of was aware of what was\nhappening then. So...and my mother would be taking jewelry from Germany to Holland\nwhen she would bring us and she would hang herself up with jewelry from my grandparents\nand from other families and so there was already kind of a preparation for, you know, saving\nsome money or some jewels or whatever it was. Also some of my grandmother's family uh\nwere immigrating to the United States and they came to Holland, so we had families coming\nthrough before they boarded the boat in Rotterdam to the United States. So we were kind of\nprepared for all this. Uh I was...go back to my school days...I was one of two in my class\nwho was Jewish. There was another boy who was Jewish, and the Dutch were very good at\nuh respecting the Jews so when the Princess Beatrice was born and all the Dutch school\nchildren gotuh (ph) \u2014__(ph) with some orange sprinkles on it, they got for the Jewish\nchildren kosher _ (ph) with butter on it. So they were very, you know, we were very well\nrespected. Uh I had around the corner where I lived was my . She was my best friend\nwho was also Jewish and we did play a whole lot together. Uh and so up until 19...1940,\nuntil the war broke out in Holland, we we were pretty I guess comfortable there as\nassimilated Jews and there was nothing too much going on except that I knew and my\nmother knew and my brother knew what was going on in Germany and anytime it could\ncome. So when the war broke out on May 5th, uh it was kind of anticipated but still a terrible\nshock. What happened on that day was that...or like my husband said early in the morning\nthe planes flew over and we were, I was certainly petrified. They came very low. We didn't\nknow what was going on. Uh and there was bombing in, I guess in the norther part of the\nHague. I was still in the Hague then and then we had heard the bombing. We had heard, we\ncould hear the bombing in Rotterdam, and I, I know I was petrified. I was absolutely\npetrified. Uh it was over in five days and uh kind of we tried to resume our lives but that\nkind of...very slowly all kinds of laws against the Jews. We were uh started up and we were\nlimited, limited a little bit more and more and more. Uh what you had to do first was you had\nto go to some office and of course I didn't go because I was a child, where you had to sign in\nand you had to sign in and write exactly how many Jewish grandparents you had. So my\nmother went there and she had four Jewish grandparents and she wrote this in and I had four\nJewish grandparents and my brother had four Jewish grandparents and we were signed up\nand wonderful for the Jews...they could find us any time. And uh I still went to school for\none year but in the same school that I went to uh originally uh but feeling a little different\nbecause every time there were some other things happening to us like uh you had to bring uh\nin your gold and any kind of jewelry and you had to bring it in or your had to bring in your\nbike. Small things all the time were, were asked to bring into the offices and give them, you\nknow. Uh now since we were very poor and I had gotten a bike from, a second-hand bike\nfrom friends of ours and my brother had a bike and so we took the bikes but my bike was a\nsmall bike, small-sized bike and they didn't want it, so I came back with a bike, but since\nnone of my Jewish friends had bikes, I couldn't ride my bike, so uh my mother was already a\nlittle cleaver because she had seen what happened in Germany, uh was hiding some of gold\nrings and some things already. Now, to back-track a little bit...my grandparents were in\nGermany in the Kristallnacht and they got out, I believe in July or August of 1939, and they\nsettled with my uncle in the western part of Holland. Uh they came with maybe eight\nguildens and they were very well-to-do German Jews in in in and uh they had, they\ngave ever....they had to give everything away and they came with no money. Uh so they\ncame to Holland and they lived with my youngest uncle who took care of them the rest of\ntheir lives. Uh at the end of 1941, we heard we couldn't go back to the schools again and that\nthey would organize a Jewish school maybe three-quarters of an hour away from us in\nand that we had to sign up there. So all the Jewish kids in the neighborhood like my\nfriend and her brother and myself and my brother and some friends would go to that\nparticular school that was organized, and I couldn't say goodbye to my friends in the\nprevious school, so in, I believe in September or so of 1941 we all walked...we kind of\nstarted walking and we picked up these kids up to go to school because it took us quite a\nwhile. Now I remember that as a very good time because we were together. It was like uh a\nfamily and everybody knew kind of what was up and and that year in school although at the\nend of that school year people disappeared. It was very strange. People kind of disappeared.\nNow...and we never knew what happened...if they were picked up or they fled or they went\ninto hiding, so sometimes we came to school and there were less people. Now at, towards the\nend of that school year uh it became very evident that we probably would not go back to\nschool anymore there because that was when in Amsterdam they started to uh pick up people\nand sent them on the trains and uh so...\nLONG PAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Q: OK. We're back on.",
        "A: I was...I guess I was talking about that uh...the year in the Jewish school was kind of a\nwonderful year with uh...but at the end of that school year people kind of disappeared and we\ndidn't know where they went, if they were picked up or if they were fleeing to uh Belgium,\nFrance, wherever to...or if they went into hiding. Uh also during that year we were supposed\nto, we were supposed to...we had to wear the Jewish star. And so uh we walked around with\nthe Jewish star. We were...could not go into the trolley car. We couldn't do actually anything\nvery much. Uh and somehow in order to deal with all this, I became pretty proud of wearing\nit. I guess it was like a...dealing with something that was horrible was kind of turning it\naround and saying I'm proud to be a Jew. Now my mother was not a religious Jew, uh but\nmy brother did become bar mitzvahed and once in a while we had to go to the synagogue,\nbut we were not religious really so...but we were very Jewish. We uh...I...1n Holland I was\nvery dark, very dark hair and uh I looked very Jewish. So did my mother who had black hair\nand black eyes and looked very Jewish. My brother, he was blond at that time and he did\nlook less Jewish, but we were different. Now what was also different is that my mother was a\nGerman Jew and she uh had a very strong German accent. She also had a whole lot of\ncontact with German Jews who had fled Germany in 1939 and uh '38 and uh so she knew a\nwhole lot of stories what had gone on uh in Germany and we were kind of aware because\nthese people were terrible displaced, these German Jews. Uh what happened in kind of...[...1\ngot...in June, July, we kind of were informed that the first people in the Hague would be\nshipped and these were the young men, sixteen years and older uh to work camps. Now my\nmother had a friend uh who told her that there was a Catholic priest who would help her find\na place for my brother. My mother had said we don't...we don't go to Poland. That's too far\naway. Uh and she kind of had made up her mind that's too far away. You don't go with your\nwhole family too far away. I mean you don't...you just don't do that. And since she had\nalready a little bit experience how to defy the Germans like, you know, getting money and\njewelry out of Germany, she knew kind of how to do things. I think she was not as afraid as\nmost of them. Anyway, the Catholic priest came to our house and that was very unusual\nbecause we had never had contact with any Catholic priest and he was uh from St., from St.\nFrancis...St. Fransican I guess...he was in kind of in garb. He didn't have a suit on and he was\nin sandals so he was quite different and he was...and I don't know if he was an older man or a\nyounger man, but he was a very, very lively man and made us feel very much at ease and he\nsaid that he had a woman in the Hague who would take my brother. And he told us that this\nwoman wanted to do some good because she had sinned so much in her life that...and was\nvery fearful that she would go to hell and that by rescuing or taking in a Jewish man, maybe\nshe would go to heaven. So that was the very beginning from our uh we planning to go in\nhiding. Now uh what happened was very, very quickly is that we thought that my brother\nwas going to be called up to go but very quickly afterwards we found out that my mother and\nmyself would go...had to go to. Now what they did was, in the Hague certainly, uh you\nwould get an announcement in the mail or with your name on it and you were supposed to\ngo at twelve midnight to the trolley car. Trolley car would take you to the train in the Hague\nand the train, trains would take you to Restabourk (ph), the Dutch concentration camp. That\nwas apparently the gathering point. That was the instructions. Uh so my brother had kind of\na place where he could go and so when we heard that we might need to go too, my mother\ncontacted the Catholic priest again and said, you know, we have to go too. We can't, you\nknow, look, we almost, we almost have to go. So he went to the woman and said could the\nmother and the sister come too, and she kind of agreed. So we had a place to go. Now we\nhad to go from our house and walk to the place where we went into hiding. You're not\nsupposed to walk after eight o'clock in the dark at night anywhere. So...and I don't know\nexactly how this was all done but I remember that I walked out of the house with my star on,\nand I was instructed at some point to take my little vest off and throw it into the uh gut...not\nin the gutter...it's in the uh...sewer. And for me that was just more fun....it's almost like you\nshed your identity. And and I don't know if I walked alone or with my mother and my\nbrother. I have no idea. I kind of...I don't know what we took. I... was asked if I took any\ntoys or any books. I don't know. I think we went with a little bit of stuff and we went to the\nplace where we were into hiding, went into hiding. Uh it appeared that my mother had\nalready taken some paintings and her silver and her chinawear and some other stuff...had\nalready...it had already disappeared. She had already taken care of it...it went into some\nplace, hiding with some friends. So we, my mother, my brother and I went to this first hiding\nplace. It was in August of 1942. Uh we had to go one flight up and there was a very small\napartment. It was a tiny little bedroom, a living room, another room and a closed-in porch, a\ntiny little kitchen and a bathroom, and then the next...it was...it was 1n...uh the person who\nlived upstairs went on the same staircase, uh the same hallway up to the next story. We got\nthe back room with the little porch. It was closed-in porch, and everything was dark and\nheavily upholstered and curtains were drawn and there were kind of two beds and a table and\nI don't know what...and there we were. And we were told that we had to whisper and we\nwere told that we could not go to the bathroom as we wanted because the person upstairs\nwould hear the flushing and there was three more people in the household of Mrs. Noen and\nher son or and...she had a foster son __ (ph) so we had to be very quiet and uh actually do\nnothing. Uh my brother right away got asthma attacks and uh he could not cough because the\nneighbors on the left and the neighbors on the...no...the neighbors upstairs and the\nshopkeepers downstairs could hear it, so he had to cough underneath his blanket and that\ndidn't, you know, he didn't get any better so that was horrendous. I mean it...you know,\npeople have asthma and they almost, you know, choke and die and that was horrible because\nhe was in a very dusty room with the heavy, heavy upholstery, and and the curtains. Uh and\nwe were all, all three of us were thrown together and it was horrible. We didn't know what to\ndo. We tried to play games and it didn't work out. Uh we invented all kinds of things and we\nkind of turned around each other. It was just absolutely horrible time. Uh what happened was\nthat the woman who hid us became extremely anxious. She couldn't sleep at night. She, she\ndidn't know what to do with herself. She was so afraid that that she would be caught and\ninstead of this plan that she had that she would go to heaven, she would be shot, you know,\nbecause she was hiding Jews. So her son concocted some kind of a plan to get us out and my\nmother...our contact person was a friend of my mother's who was not Jewish and that was\nour contact person from the outside world. And actually we never kind of found out what\nhappened exactly but we got a letter uh saying that some people knew where we were and\nwe had to come up with some money and we had to leave. Now the son had married...I guess\nhe can live in the house...had married and was...I had some little rings and some little\njewelry. My mother had some and he had saved that for us and we never got it back. Uh he\nalso said he needed some money and we had to find some money and I don't know where my\nmother got the money. We had to give that to him for some reason. It was all very strange,\nbut we were so powerless that we did everything they asked us to do and anyway the priest\nwas contacted again and he found us another place in Delft and we left. We were there from\nAugust whatever until November 29th of '42. Uh we were, we had to go on the trolley car.\nWe had to go on the train to Delft. Now since we hadn't been outside for three months to\nwalk out and to go on the trolley car and to go on the train was the most awful thing because\nyou exposed yourself and we were so afraid we'd got caught. At the end of the train ride,\nwhich was very short, we were going to meet somebody. We didn't know who it was. So we\ndid that and we met this Mr. Faheine (ph) at, in Delft. Uh now what the good thing about this\nbeing black-mailed and and that whole story was that what we didn't know was that the lady\nwho lived upstairs from where we were hiding had hid a whole lot of stuff for Jewish\npeople. Chinawear, silver...not ours, somebody else's...and she was caught, so what\nhappened was a couple of months after we had left, the Germans found out that she had\nstored stuff and came into the apartments, you know, looked over, you know, looked through\nall the apartments, the apartment where we had been hiding and upstairs and so actually that\nwhole plan of this son to free his mother from all this anxiety was to our advantage because\nwe would have been caught and we would not be here. We uh we went to Delft to this family\nand this man took us to his family and we found out that this was a family, a father, mother\nand seven children, and we all...the youngest child was two, and the oldest child was like\neighteen. And the house, you cannot believe how small the house was and he had promised\nthat he would take us in for a while and we got some room and there was no way that we\ncould escape ever. I mean it was all very small and all, all very tight. The houses were built\nvery close together and we could not escape to the roof or to the basement. There was no\nescape here also. We were there and we could not go too near the windows. We could not\nflush the toilets. We could not walk really because downstairs they had a barber shop and\nshe had a beauty parlor downstairs, so we were not supposed to be really there so we couldn't\ndo anything uh so you had to kind of walk on your stocking feet and you couldn't really go to\nthe bathroom because it was too much flushing. Uh it would all be suspicious. We could not\nbe near the window because the streets in Delft are very narrow and the people across the\nstreet could just see you. Just, you know, so that was also not the best place to hide. Uh the\nman who hid us, Mr. Faheine (ph), was an extraordinary man because on Sundays, three\nmore Jewish men came, would come to visit. They were hiding somewhere in Delft and he\nwould kind of bring them 1n and have a Sunday meal and then there was some uh...and you\nknow, it was all very small but he kind of wanted to help these people. Uh we didn't know\nthese people, but you know, they were...other people were hiding them. Now one of these\nthree men we found out while we were there that he was caught uh traveling and was shot.\nUh the other two men we don't know what happened to them. Uh the seven children never\nlet anybody know that we were there. Now they went to school, right, they went...and I don't\nthink they were told, you know, specifically that they don't tell anyone that, you know, we\nhave people in hiding here. I don't think so. They kind of knew. Uh...I'm trying to think a\nlittle bit what happened there...all kinds of things happened uh uh while we were there. Now\nthis was from like say December of...December '42 until May '45 we were there, so during\nthat time uh things happened in Delft such as uh...I don't think I can recall logically, but uh\nthe Germans were looking for blankets, right? They needed blankets for I don't know for\nwhat and so we heard that they would come to the house, to the house, right, and search the\nhouse for blankets. Now as soon as something like that came through we had to go\nsomewhere, or they would, we would hear that all men over sixteen would have to go to\nworkcamps and so in that family my brother was over sixteen and two more were over\nsixteen years old so they would...we had to do something. All the time something like that\nwould happen and we had to find a solution and not be with...this family had to find a\nsolution for us, so one time we stayed for three days in a Catholic church. The Catholic\nchurch was around the corner. Early in the morning we would walk to the Catholic church,\nsit through the mass, stay in a in a room. Every Mass that was we went to. We had pennies,\nyou know, to put in and and that was for us kind of, you know, it was like a beautiful show\nbecause it was music and colorful and and...and it was spacious and uh we felt we would not\nbe caught there. For some reason that was neutral ground and we wouldn't be caught there.\nOne time...I forgot what the reason was...we had to also leave that house and we would, and\nI I forgot what the reason was...we had to stay with people uh also two blocks away. Now\nwhat we did during the time that we were hiding, we would knit a lot. My mother would knit\nsocks for the whole family and so while we had to leave the house and went two blocks\naway to another family, she took her knitting along but very close to the house she lost the\nyarn, So we walked and the yarn unwound and, you know, the whole path with the yarn\nbehind her (laughter) and we found it very funny. Anyway we...she...[ don't\nknow...retrieved it, but, you know, it was like...and we stayed with a young family and with\nthat young family there was also a Jew hiding from Amsterdam, an investment banker, and\nfor us that was like wonderful because we had some other people to talk to and somebody\nwho was in the same position we were in and uh uh it was kind of a diversion from the usual\nlife we had. Uh I don't know how long we stayed there. Not very long, and we went back\nagain. Another time they were looking for a man who was sixteen years old and my uh\nbrother and the other two males would go to another house where they had built a uh fake\nwall, and what they would do if the houses would be searched, the men would go behind the\nfake wall. Now, again my brother went and he thought it was terrific because you could go\nsomewhere else and he played cards and until there was, you know, there was a sign that\nthey had to hide and these kind of diversions were kind of a relief for our, you know, just\nstaying in the house and not doing very much. Uh we did some cooking and some sewing\nand some knitting and some playing Monopoly and... playing a lot of Monopoly. I know that\nthat we were not as tense in that family as in the previous family because there was a little bit\nmore room and a little bit more uh...there were more people so we had uh but the woman we\nwere hiding with, Mrs. _, was also extremely anxious. I mean you just can't imagine if\nwe would be caught. Her husband would be...who knows, you know, so she was extremely\nanxious and she became sick. I mean she really became sick...physical illness but I think it\nwas probably uh due to some of the anxiety that she experienced in fearing that that\nsomething might happen to her whole family. She was sick for months, so...and she had\nreally no place...it was such a small house and she way lying 1n the living room. It was\nhorrendous. Uh now in that family, only two of their relatives knew that we were there. Her\nsister and his brother, and nobody else knew that we were there. Now in the Dutch families,\non Sundays everybody gathers always on Sundays, right. Sunday meal. They just come by to\nsay hello to every...Sunday was horrendous for us because we had to stay in an upstairs little\nroom almost all Sunday and couldn't get out because the family was downstairs and they\nshouldn't see us. Uh what happened uh...",
        "Q: What did you do when you were up there?",
        "A: I don't think very much. I mean you either sat...we knitted maybe. My brother...I don't know.\nI don't know. We didn't do very much. We did read. Uh but again we uh, the oldest daughter\nwould go to the library for us, but she couldn't get enough books for us. I mean we could\nread three books a day or, you know, easily, all of us. But she would get just a few books, so\nwe read. We read. But there was never enough because we, you know, she couldn't get\nenough books and there were no books in the house. There was no library. They were...the\nhusband was a barber and she was a beautician. They were not educated people. There were\nno books in the house really, so we...I guess we played Monopoly. We read a little bit. We\nuh...I don't know, I can't...we did...my mother and I would peel potatoes, you know, and and\nclean vegetables and do some cooking and do darning and so on. My brother had it much\nmore difficult. Uh there was very little food. Uh we uh...my hiding father as we called him,\nwould would get some food from the farmers because we were on the uh market right there\nand since he was a barber the farmers would come for a shave, and he would do some\ndealing with them, so he would get some vegetables and some fresh potatoes and we would\nget some food. Also he was really remarkable. He loved to uh get...defy the authority. I mean\nthat was his whole task there. I mean he loved it, so we had uh ration cards, but he had for\neverybody two, so we had...there were twelve fam...twelve people in the house. He had\ntwenty-four. So he, we had a little bit of more food than usual but still there was hardly any\nfood in the house and so there was a whole lot of tension about food in the house because\nyou cook for twelve people and and uh divide it up. It was very difficult and especially for\nthe hiding mother because she had her own children and us and it was horrendous and they\nwere all growing people, you know...they were all, like I said, from two to eighteen and I\nwas like thirteen, fourteen. My brother was sixteen, seventeen. I mean you could eat\nenormous amount of food. There was a lot of tension around food. Uh what happened...I\nthink in 1944...uh the hiding mother's youngest sister was pregnant and she needed some\nhelp and she asked me or my mother or somebody if I could help her. That meant that I had\nto go from the place where I was hiding to her house and uh for me again it was something\ndifferent, but I think you, you kind of learn to take a deep breathe and you walk and you\nhope nothing will happen, so I had to walk from the place I was hiding to her house, and then\nI slept overnight. I don't know how long it was, but I walked on the street there. I hadn't\nwalked on the street for a long time all by myself. And uh I stayed there and I don't know\nhow long - maybe a few weeks or a few months and helped her, which was was a welcomed\nchanged but there was also this fear that maybe my mother and my brother would be caught\nor that I would be caught, so...I mean...1t was very very tense is all I can say and very fearful.\nI was always very fearful. The worst fear that I had, and I can't tell for my mother and my\nbrother, that at night when there would be trucks coming through the streets, you would just\nlay in bed and you would just wait and you always anticipated that that truck would stop in\nfront of the house you were hiding in. The Germans would come out, bang on the door and\nwould get us, find us, and so trucks were like you would just lying in bed and if you heard\nsome noise you kind of hold it, and since we had no place to flee...most people, some people\nhad, in their hiding place, had another hiding place where they thought they would be safer.\nWe had nothing. Absolutely nothing to run to or to hide in. Nothing. So we were exposed\nand everything. Uh this didn't happen, you know. But there were many instances that the\nGermans would come in the barber shop and would ask for a shave and the man who hid us\nwould have to shave the German soldiers and we would be upstairs and we would never\nknow if they wanted to go to the bathroom or not, you know, because the bathroom was\nupstairs, so uh I can't really tell you exactly how frightened we were. I can't also tell you\nwhat we did because it's like one day was like the other and also you didn't really want to\nthink because you would hear things. We would get some bits of information and uh they\nwere all, like, you know, this man was caught and this man was caught and this family was\ncaught. You would hear that and we didn't really want to believe it because we hoped it\nwasn't true and we would maybe be next. We did have false identity cards. Uh we got them\nthrough another contact uh and again this was made uh so that we would...somehow we\nalways felt guilty that somebody did something for us. What happened is people would come\nto us and they had in their rain...raincoats all the paraphernalia to make false identity cards.\nNow uh they would come to us and they would go on the train, and if they would be caught\nthey would leave the raincoats there, but anyway they came to our house where we were\nhiding and would...gave us the...they did the whole thing with the stamping and the\nfingerprints and the whole thing. But it was always what if they were caught. It would be\nbecause of us, because they came to us to give us identity cards, and this really was like\nconstantly that we would feel so guilty that people were helping us. And that their lives was\nat...their lives were just uh in danger just like us and and everyone of them who knew about\nus, their life was in danger. Uh I remember that we didn't have any fuel and I was to go with\none of the...two of the children go to the road where there were little pieces of coal in the in\nthe road deck (ph) and we would go there and I was asked also to go because...well, I would\ndress up like any little Dutch girl with a kerchief on and wooden shoes and we would go to\nthe roadway and find little pieces of coal so we could have some fuel for a very little stove,\nso I could get out. My brother never got out because he was of the age that uh like, you\nknow, they needed him in in the work camps. Now one of the things that was...I'm glad that I\nremembered it...one of the most awful things happened in this family was that their oldest\nson was called up to go to a work camp. And there we were. We were hiding with them, and\nhe had to make a decision to go or not to go. What meant was if he wasn't going to go, we\nhad to leave because if he was going to go in hiding they were going to look for him and if\nhe was going to go to Germany to work camp, we would be...they were not going to look for\nhim, so we would be more or less safe. This man was a very religious Catholic and he\ndecided that he was going to go to the work camp. And I don't know what date that was. So\nhe went and we stayed. And we had no dealing at all in his decision making but again we felt\nlike he did it for us, because if he had decided not to go, we had to find another place and\nthat was very difficult. So he went and they didn't get very much mail from him, so there was\nthis constant kind of hanging over us - if he would die, he would die for us and and so we,\nyou know, you put this all together...denial is a wonderful thing...so we kind of lived with it\nand everybody else was there. Their daughter had married in the end of 1944, but all the\nother five children were there, so the daughter was married, he was in a work camp in\nGermany and the five children were there. But he wasn't there, so we were daily\nreminded...Walter was his name...wasn't there. He did come back from the work camp, but I\nalways felt for years and years that guilt that I had sent him to a work camp and we did some\ncorresponding and he said that part of his decision was adventure, but he suffered. Actually\nhe never did very well after he came back. He was like always extremely nervous and he\nretired early. Now we don't know if it was due to his experience in the work camp and just\nlike we don't know what our...if our our problems are because of the Holocaust or just maybe\njust, you know, problems. But I think his experiences in the work camp were horrendous and\nuh he he did come back, so that was...but the guilt of having...for him to make a decision to\ngo to Germany never left me, up until we corresponded, which was only a few years ago. Uh\nof course the whole thing with uh...we thought that autumn, that we would be liberated in\nSeptember of 1944 and we weren't and we had had such big hopes that we would be\nliberated and we had to go through the whole winter which was the hunger winter in\nHolland...there was no food...and I think we were all pretty depressed. Uh we would ask how\nlong...when will it be over, and he would say, the hiding father would say to me, and another\nday would go by...how long is it going to take and he would say soon, so we kind of...you\nknow...anyway the uh we were liberated in May the Sth. That winter was the most\nhorrendous winter because people died of hunger. Uh we just made it. There was food until\nthe last day and then the food was over (ph). Now I remember that I did not want to believe\neveryone that we were liberated because I did not want to be disappointed. I didn't believe it.\nThey would say...you know, we we heard that we were going to be lib...that we were\nliberated in May and I said no, it's not true. It's not true. I'm not going to go outside\nbecause...and everybody was kind of flocking...you know,going outside. Ah, we are\nliberated...and I...and they couldn't get me out because I...first of all I was afraid to go out but\nsecond of all I thought maybe if it isn't true, it's going to be worse. So they had to kind of\ndrag me out, to the outside, and then there was, it was...we were uh really liberated. Uh we\nstayed for quite a few weeks in, with the family and then my mother found an apartment in\nin in the Hague and went back to the Hague where we originally lived. Uh...uh...(pause) I\ncan only tell tell you what happened afterwards a little bit is that my brother was...a couple of\nmonths later was drafted into the...was supposed to be drafted into the Dutch army to fight in\nIndonesia so here we had already joined a Zionist organization and he decided to go illegally\nto Israel because he didn't want to go to Indonesia and fight or go into the Dutch army so\nmy...we had been together for thirty-three months in very small quarters and my brother left,\nearly '46 he left for Israel and we didn't see him for many years because, you know, we\nstayed in Holland for a few years. Uh now my grandparents and my uncle went also into\nhiding in the eastern part of Holland and they were in a barn on a farm and they were...they\nwere caught the week before the end of the war, but the Germans didn't know what to do\nwith them because they were in such a mess at that time and they put them in prison in in\nnearby village and kind of left them there while they fled and so they were saved. So my\nuncle, my my uh my uh grandparents survived also. My aunt, my fraternal aunt, uncle and\ncousins all died and uh one cousin who was about twenty years old uh had a uh extensive\nstamp collection and he sold his stamp collection in 1942, and with that money he wanted to\nbuy himself out of Holland. You know, you could, for a whole lot of money you could leave\nthe country. THey would get you over the border and over another border and so he did that\nand uh and I don't how much money but he was caught on the border of Holland and he was\nshot right there. He was killed uh very early also, in '42, '43. My uh oldest cousin uh married\nin 1942 her fiance. That's what people did...they married...they didn't want to be separated so\nwhat they did they married and then so that they could go together who knows where, and so\nmy uh oldest cousin married and she died in a concentration camp. Her husband also died in\na concentration camp, and then my, her mother, her father and her youngest sister all went,\nin December 1943, which was pretty late, uh to the Dutch camp, concentration camp\nRestabourk. Three days later they were sent to Auschwitz and my aunt and my youngest\ncousin died three days later and my uncle we don't know, and that whole family was was\nwiped out. Uh of my friends or my mother's friends, hardly anyone uh was saved. One very\nclose friend of my mother's survived. Uh her whole sister's family, husband and children, all\ndied. My mother's uh two other families, best friends and relations, all died...all left and died.\nUh uh one of my best friends survived with her whole family which was very unusual. But\nwhen we returned, I mean when we returned to the Hague we found this all out and it was\nlike horrendous because we thought...we didn't find back what we had left. We found\nnothing, that's what it was and we had to start our lives all over again and so what one thing\nwe did was join the Zionist organization to kind of have something that belonged to us, you\nknow, that was...we could relate to these people because either they had been in hiding or\nthey, because they were Jewish. We uh...I met my husband in the Zionist organization and he\nuh had promised his parents that he would help them settle in the United States, and he went\nin uh 1947, he went in '47 went to the United States while I finished my schooling.\nNow important to know is that our schooling was interrupted. I had finished elementary\nschool and when I was, came out of hiding I was fifteen years old and had no high school, so\nafter the war I went to evening high school and I went to during the day I went to school for\nhome economics. Uh but I mean the evening high school was like not very much and so that\npart uh you know, not having any really good education was terribly interrupted.",
        "Q: ...When did you come to USA ?",
        "A: Well, we came twice because I joined then my fiance in 1949, early, in January of '49 I came\nto the States with my mother. Uh and we got married in '49. We left in uh '41, 'S1 for Israel,\nbecause our plan was really always uh always to go to Israel. We went to Israel for five years\nbut my husband's family was here in the States and he had no one in Israel, so in 1955 we\nwent to Holland and stayed in Holland for a year and came back in 1956 to the United\nStates. Now my brother remained tn Israel and has a big family. He's married, has four\nchildren. Uh one of them died in the war with Lebanon. His oldest son died, and that\nwas...we were kind of rebuilding our family and this was the first death in the family. Uh so\nwe came back in '56. Now my daughter was born in Israel in 1951 and my son was born in\n1958 in uh in the United States. Uh and we settled in West Chester.",

        "A: I was born in Rotterdam, Holland uh on November 4th, 1929. (laughter) I have to think\nabout this.",
        "A: OK. Uh, let me tell you first about my father's family. They are Heijmans and most of the\nfamily uh lived in the eastern part of Holland. My father's father was Dutch and my father's\nmother was a German Jew and her name was Rosalie, and my father's father was Jacob. Uh\nthey had three children. Uh I think my father was the oldest, then my aunt who died in\nAuschwitz, and a younger brother who died of diabetes in 1922, '24 - I don't know exactly\nand his name was Herman. Uh my father met my mother in Germany and my mother is, was\na German Jew. She grew up in the western part of Germany and she was one of three. Uh\nshe was the middle child. Her older brother, Rudie, immigrated to Israel\u2019 in 1935. Uh my\nmother married my father in 1925 and moved to Holland. Uh my youngest brother, her\nyoungest...my youngest uncle, her youngest brother, immigrated in 1934 or 'S to Holland and\nhe uh studied in Germany, so there's a lot of German in my family. Uh...my parents settled in\nRotterdam uh when they got married in 1925. My brother, Herman, uh who is now called\nJohanem (ph) who lives in Israel, was born in August 1926 and I was born in November\n1929 also in Rotterdam. In 1930 they moved to the Hague to get away from my mother's in-\nlaws who were very intrusive. My father's sister had already moved away from Rotterdam\nbecause of the same reason and they moved in a little suburb near the Hague. Uh now the\nstory about my parents' financial problems are very vague because nobody told me and my\nfather died in...actually he committed suicide in 1936. Before he died, they moved from a big\nhouse in the Hague to a very small apartment or small apartment and I was sent to my\ngrandparents in Germany. My grandparents lived in Germany in Gelsenkirchen (ph). My\nbrother who was going to school at that time stayed with my parents and later on with my\nmother and I was sent away because moving and the problems so I, I was in Germany in\n1935 and 1936 as a youngster before I went to school. So there is a big difference. At that\ntime already Jews were very careful. I was a little girl and when I was on the street, my\ngrandparents would say, don't speak too loudly, uh don't hop, don't skip, uh uh don't make\nyourself noticed because there were all the Nazis around us and so at a very early age I was\nalready aware that I was different, that I was Jewish, I shouldn't be noticed, should be quiet.\n(Cough) Also my grandparents did all kinds of things to be Jews. I mean they were not\n' Palestine\nreally religious but they would go to the synagogue because they felt as a Jew you needed to\nstay together. So I had to go to the synagogue on the sabath_ and uh participate. So I went\nback to Holland probably in April, May of 1936. I spoke German at that time because I, my\ngrandparents spoke German. I came back and my mother sent me to school, kindergarten uh\nfor me to quickly pick up the Dutch and I went to kindergarten and then to first grade. I then\ncame to a new apartment because I had moved...when I left for Germany I had lived in a big\nhouse and I came to an apartment, and my father wasn't there. So...and my mother was a\nwidow and uh had a very hard time making money and so we were very poor. Uh my mother\nand my brother and I did go back and forth to Germany. For my school vacations I would go\nto Germany so my mother had some free time I guess. And so in 1936, in 1937, in 1938 I\nspent my vacations in Germany with my grandparents, and kind of was aware of what was\nhappening then. So...and my mother would be taking jewelry from Germany to Holland\nwhen she would bring us and she would hang herself up with jewelry from my grandparents\nand from other families and so there was already kind of a preparation for, you know, saving\nsome money or some jewels or whatever it was. Also some of my grandmother's family uh\nwere immigrating to the United States and they came to Holland, so we had families coming\nthrough before they boarded the boat in Rotterdam to the United States. So we were kind of\nprepared for all this. Uh I was...go back to my school days...I was one of two in my class\nwho was Jewish. There was another boy who was Jewish, and the Dutch were very good at\nuh respecting the Jews so when the Princess Beatrice was born and all the Dutch school\nchildren gotuh (ph) \u2014__(ph) with some orange sprinkles on it, they got for the Jewish\nchildren kosher _ (ph) with butter on it. So they were very, you know, we were very well\nrespected. Uh I had around the corner where I lived was my . She was my best friend\nwho was also Jewish and we did play a whole lot together. Uh and so up until 19...1940,\nuntil the war broke out in Holland, we we were pretty I guess comfortable there as\nassimilated Jews and there was nothing too much going on except that I knew and my\nmother knew and my brother knew what was going on in Germany and anytime it could\ncome. So when the war broke out on May 5th, uh it was kind of anticipated but still a terrible\nshock. What happened on that day was that...or like my husband said early in the morning\nthe planes flew over and we were, I was certainly petrified. They came very low. We didn't\nknow what was going on. Uh and there was bombing in, I guess in the norther part of the\nHague. I was still in the Hague then and then we had heard the bombing. We had heard, we\ncould hear the bombing in Rotterdam, and I, I know I was petrified. I was absolutely\npetrified. Uh it was over in five days and uh kind of we tried to resume our lives but that\nkind of...very slowly all kinds of laws against the Jews. We were uh started up and we were\nlimited, limited a little bit more and more and more. Uh what you had to do first was you had\nto go to some office and of course I didn't go because I was a child, where you had to sign in\nand you had to sign in and write exactly how many Jewish grandparents you had. So my\nmother went there and she had four Jewish grandparents and she wrote this in and I had four\nJewish grandparents and my brother had four Jewish grandparents and we were signed up\nand wonderful for the Jews...they could find us any time. And uh I still went to school for\none year but in the same school that I went to uh originally uh but feeling a little different\nbecause every time there were some other things happening to us like uh you had to bring uh\nin your gold and any kind of jewelry and you had to bring it in or your had to bring in your\nbike. Small things all the time were, were asked to bring into the offices and give them, you\nknow. Uh now since we were very poor and I had gotten a bike from, a second-hand bike\nfrom friends of ours and my brother had a bike and so we took the bikes but my bike was a\nsmall bike, small-sized bike and they didn't want it, so I came back with a bike, but since\nnone of my Jewish friends had bikes, I couldn't ride my bike, so uh my mother was already a\nlittle cleaver because she had seen what happened in Germany, uh was hiding some of gold\nrings and some things already. Now, to back-track a little bit...my grandparents were in\nGermany in the Kristallnacht and they got out, I believe in July or August of 1939, and they\nsettled with my uncle in the western part of Holland. Uh they came with maybe eight\nguildens and they were very well-to-do German Jews in in in and uh they had, they\ngave ever....they had to give everything away and they came with no money. Uh so they\ncame to Holland and they lived with my youngest uncle who took care of them the rest of\ntheir lives. Uh at the end of 1941, we heard we couldn't go back to the schools again and that\nthey would organize a Jewish school maybe three-quarters of an hour away from us in\nand that we had to sign up there. So all the Jewish kids in the neighborhood like my\nfriend and her brother and myself and my brother and some friends would go to that\nparticular school that was organized, and I couldn't say goodbye to my friends in the\nprevious school, so in, I believe in September or so of 1941 we all walked...we kind of\nstarted walking and we picked up these kids up to go to school because it took us quite a\nwhile. Now I remember that as a very good time because we were together. It was like uh a\nfamily and everybody knew kind of what was up and and that year in school although at the\nend of that school year people disappeared. It was very strange. People kind of disappeared.\nNow...and we never knew what happened...if they were picked up or they fled or they went\ninto hiding, so sometimes we came to school and there were less people. Now at, towards the\nend of that school year uh it became very evident that we probably would not go back to\nschool anymore there because that was when in Amsterdam they started to uh pick up people\nand sent them on the trains and uh so...\nLONG PAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: I was...I guess I was talking about that uh...the year in the Jewish school was kind of a\nwonderful year with uh...but at the end of that school year people kind of disappeared and we\ndidn't know where they went, if they were picked up or if they were fleeing to uh Belgium,\nFrance, wherever to...or if they went into hiding. Uh also during that year we were supposed\nto, we were supposed to...we had to wear the Jewish star. And so uh we walked around with\nthe Jewish star. We were...could not go into the trolley car. We couldn't do actually anything\nvery much. Uh and somehow in order to deal with all this, I became pretty proud of wearing\nit. I guess it was like a...dealing with something that was horrible was kind of turning it\naround and saying I'm proud to be a Jew. Now my mother was not a religious Jew, uh but\nmy brother did become bar mitzvahed and once in a while we had to go to the synagogue,\nbut we were not religious really so...but we were very Jewish. We uh...I...1n Holland I was\nvery dark, very dark hair and uh I looked very Jewish. So did my mother who had black hair\nand black eyes and looked very Jewish. My brother, he was blond at that time and he did\nlook less Jewish, but we were different. Now what was also different is that my mother was a\nGerman Jew and she uh had a very strong German accent. She also had a whole lot of\ncontact with German Jews who had fled Germany in 1939 and uh '38 and uh so she knew a\nwhole lot of stories what had gone on uh in Germany and we were kind of aware because\nthese people were terrible displaced, these German Jews. Uh what happened in kind of...[...1\ngot...in June, July, we kind of were informed that the first people in the Hague would be\nshipped and these were the young men, sixteen years and older uh to work camps. Now my\nmother had a friend uh who told her that there was a Catholic priest who would help her find\na place for my brother. My mother had said we don't...we don't go to Poland. That's too far\naway. Uh and she kind of had made up her mind that's too far away. You don't go with your\nwhole family too far away. I mean you don't...you just don't do that. And since she had\nalready a little bit experience how to defy the Germans like, you know, getting money and\njewelry out of Germany, she knew kind of how to do things. I think she was not as afraid as\nmost of them. Anyway, the Catholic priest came to our house and that was very unusual\nbecause we had never had contact with any Catholic priest and he was uh from St., from St.\nFrancis...St. Fransican I guess...he was in kind of in garb. He didn't have a suit on and he was\nin sandals so he was quite different and he was...and I don't know if he was an older man or a\nyounger man, but he was a very, very lively man and made us feel very much at ease and he\nsaid that he had a woman in the Hague who would take my brother. And he told us that this\nwoman wanted to do some good because she had sinned so much in her life that...and was\nvery fearful that she would go to hell and that by rescuing or taking in a Jewish man, maybe\nshe would go to heaven. So that was the very beginning from our uh we planning to go in\nhiding. Now uh what happened was very, very quickly is that we thought that my brother\nwas going to be called up to go but very quickly afterwards we found out that my mother and\nmyself would go...had to go to. Now what they did was, in the Hague certainly, uh you\nwould get an announcement in the mail or with your name on it and you were supposed to\ngo at twelve midnight to the trolley car. Trolley car would take you to the train in the Hague\nand the train, trains would take you to Restabourk (ph), the Dutch concentration camp. That\nwas apparently the gathering point. That was the instructions. Uh so my brother had kind of\na place where he could go and so when we heard that we might need to go too, my mother\ncontacted the Catholic priest again and said, you know, we have to go too. We can't, you\nknow, look, we almost, we almost have to go. So he went to the woman and said could the\nmother and the sister come too, and she kind of agreed. So we had a place to go. Now we\nhad to go from our house and walk to the place where we went into hiding. You're not\nsupposed to walk after eight o'clock in the dark at night anywhere. So...and I don't know\nexactly how this was all done but I remember that I walked out of the house with my star on,\nand I was instructed at some point to take my little vest off and throw it into the uh gut...not\nin the gutter...it's in the uh...sewer. And for me that was just more fun....it's almost like you\nshed your identity. And and I don't know if I walked alone or with my mother and my\nbrother. I have no idea. I kind of...I don't know what we took. I... was asked if I took any\ntoys or any books. I don't know. I think we went with a little bit of stuff and we went to the\nplace where we were into hiding, went into hiding. Uh it appeared that my mother had\nalready taken some paintings and her silver and her chinawear and some other stuff...had\nalready...it had already disappeared. She had already taken care of it...it went into some\nplace, hiding with some friends. So we, my mother, my brother and I went to this first hiding\nplace. It was in August of 1942. Uh we had to go one flight up and there was a very small\napartment. It was a tiny little bedroom, a living room, another room and a closed-in porch, a\ntiny little kitchen and a bathroom, and then the next...it was...it was 1n...uh the person who\nlived upstairs went on the same staircase, uh the same hallway up to the next story. We got\nthe back room with the little porch. It was closed-in porch, and everything was dark and\nheavily upholstered and curtains were drawn and there were kind of two beds and a table and\nI don't know what...and there we were. And we were told that we had to whisper and we\nwere told that we could not go to the bathroom as we wanted because the person upstairs\nwould hear the flushing and there was three more people in the household of Mrs. Noen and\nher son or and...she had a foster son __ (ph) so we had to be very quiet and uh actually do\nnothing. Uh my brother right away got asthma attacks and uh he could not cough because the\nneighbors on the left and the neighbors on the...no...the neighbors upstairs and the\nshopkeepers downstairs could hear it, so he had to cough underneath his blanket and that\ndidn't, you know, he didn't get any better so that was horrendous. I mean it...you know,\npeople have asthma and they almost, you know, choke and die and that was horrible because\nhe was in a very dusty room with the heavy, heavy upholstery, and and the curtains. Uh and\nwe were all, all three of us were thrown together and it was horrible. We didn't know what to\ndo. We tried to play games and it didn't work out. Uh we invented all kinds of things and we\nkind of turned around each other. It was just absolutely horrible time. Uh what happened was\nthat the woman who hid us became extremely anxious. She couldn't sleep at night. She, she\ndidn't know what to do with herself. She was so afraid that that she would be caught and\ninstead of this plan that she had that she would go to heaven, she would be shot, you know,\nbecause she was hiding Jews. So her son concocted some kind of a plan to get us out and my\nmother...our contact person was a friend of my mother's who was not Jewish and that was\nour contact person from the outside world. And actually we never kind of found out what\nhappened exactly but we got a letter uh saying that some people knew where we were and\nwe had to come up with some money and we had to leave. Now the son had married...I guess\nhe can live in the house...had married and was...I had some little rings and some little\njewelry. My mother had some and he had saved that for us and we never got it back. Uh he\nalso said he needed some money and we had to find some money and I don't know where my\nmother got the money. We had to give that to him for some reason. It was all very strange,\nbut we were so powerless that we did everything they asked us to do and anyway the priest\nwas contacted again and he found us another place in Delft and we left. We were there from\nAugust whatever until November 29th of '42. Uh we were, we had to go on the trolley car.\nWe had to go on the train to Delft. Now since we hadn't been outside for three months to\nwalk out and to go on the trolley car and to go on the train was the most awful thing because\nyou exposed yourself and we were so afraid we'd got caught. At the end of the train ride,\nwhich was very short, we were going to meet somebody. We didn't know who it was. So we\ndid that and we met this Mr. Faheine (ph) at, in Delft. Uh now what the good thing about this\nbeing black-mailed and and that whole story was that what we didn't know was that the lady\nwho lived upstairs from where we were hiding had hid a whole lot of stuff for Jewish\npeople. Chinawear, silver...not ours, somebody else's...and she was caught, so what\nhappened was a couple of months after we had left, the Germans found out that she had\nstored stuff and came into the apartments, you know, looked over, you know, looked through\nall the apartments, the apartment where we had been hiding and upstairs and so actually that\nwhole plan of this son to free his mother from all this anxiety was to our advantage because\nwe would have been caught and we would not be here. We uh we went to Delft to this family\nand this man took us to his family and we found out that this was a family, a father, mother\nand seven children, and we all...the youngest child was two, and the oldest child was like\neighteen. And the house, you cannot believe how small the house was and he had promised\nthat he would take us in for a while and we got some room and there was no way that we\ncould escape ever. I mean it was all very small and all, all very tight. The houses were built\nvery close together and we could not escape to the roof or to the basement. There was no\nescape here also. We were there and we could not go too near the windows. We could not\nflush the toilets. We could not walk really because downstairs they had a barber shop and\nshe had a beauty parlor downstairs, so we were not supposed to be really there so we couldn't\ndo anything uh so you had to kind of walk on your stocking feet and you couldn't really go to\nthe bathroom because it was too much flushing. Uh it would all be suspicious. We could not\nbe near the window because the streets in Delft are very narrow and the people across the\nstreet could just see you. Just, you know, so that was also not the best place to hide. Uh the\nman who hid us, Mr. Faheine (ph), was an extraordinary man because on Sundays, three\nmore Jewish men came, would come to visit. They were hiding somewhere in Delft and he\nwould kind of bring them 1n and have a Sunday meal and then there was some uh...and you\nknow, it was all very small but he kind of wanted to help these people. Uh we didn't know\nthese people, but you know, they were...other people were hiding them. Now one of these\nthree men we found out while we were there that he was caught uh traveling and was shot.\nUh the other two men we don't know what happened to them. Uh the seven children never\nlet anybody know that we were there. Now they went to school, right, they went...and I don't\nthink they were told, you know, specifically that they don't tell anyone that, you know, we\nhave people in hiding here. I don't think so. They kind of knew. Uh...I'm trying to think a\nlittle bit what happened there...all kinds of things happened uh uh while we were there. Now\nthis was from like say December of...December '42 until May '45 we were there, so during\nthat time uh things happened in Delft such as uh...I don't think I can recall logically, but uh\nthe Germans were looking for blankets, right? They needed blankets for I don't know for\nwhat and so we heard that they would come to the house, to the house, right, and search the\nhouse for blankets. Now as soon as something like that came through we had to go\nsomewhere, or they would, we would hear that all men over sixteen would have to go to\nworkcamps and so in that family my brother was over sixteen and two more were over\nsixteen years old so they would...we had to do something. All the time something like that\nwould happen and we had to find a solution and not be with...this family had to find a\nsolution for us, so one time we stayed for three days in a Catholic church. The Catholic\nchurch was around the corner. Early in the morning we would walk to the Catholic church,\nsit through the mass, stay in a in a room. Every Mass that was we went to. We had pennies,\nyou know, to put in and and that was for us kind of, you know, it was like a beautiful show\nbecause it was music and colorful and and...and it was spacious and uh we felt we would not\nbe caught there. For some reason that was neutral ground and we wouldn't be caught there.\nOne time...I forgot what the reason was...we had to also leave that house and we would, and\nI I forgot what the reason was...we had to stay with people uh also two blocks away. Now\nwhat we did during the time that we were hiding, we would knit a lot. My mother would knit\nsocks for the whole family and so while we had to leave the house and went two blocks\naway to another family, she took her knitting along but very close to the house she lost the\nyarn, So we walked and the yarn unwound and, you know, the whole path with the yarn\nbehind her (laughter) and we found it very funny. Anyway we...she...[ don't\nknow...retrieved it, but, you know, it was like...and we stayed with a young family and with\nthat young family there was also a Jew hiding from Amsterdam, an investment banker, and\nfor us that was like wonderful because we had some other people to talk to and somebody\nwho was in the same position we were in and uh uh it was kind of a diversion from the usual\nlife we had. Uh I don't know how long we stayed there. Not very long, and we went back\nagain. Another time they were looking for a man who was sixteen years old and my uh\nbrother and the other two males would go to another house where they had built a uh fake\nwall, and what they would do if the houses would be searched, the men would go behind the\nfake wall. Now, again my brother went and he thought it was terrific because you could go\nsomewhere else and he played cards and until there was, you know, there was a sign that\nthey had to hide and these kind of diversions were kind of a relief for our, you know, just\nstaying in the house and not doing very much. Uh we did some cooking and some sewing\nand some knitting and some playing Monopoly and... playing a lot of Monopoly. I know that\nthat we were not as tense in that family as in the previous family because there was a little bit\nmore room and a little bit more uh...there were more people so we had uh but the woman we\nwere hiding with, Mrs. _, was also extremely anxious. I mean you just can't imagine if\nwe would be caught. Her husband would be...who knows, you know, so she was extremely\nanxious and she became sick. I mean she really became sick...physical illness but I think it\nwas probably uh due to some of the anxiety that she experienced in fearing that that\nsomething might happen to her whole family. She was sick for months, so...and she had\nreally no place...it was such a small house and she way lying 1n the living room. It was\nhorrendous. Uh now in that family, only two of their relatives knew that we were there. Her\nsister and his brother, and nobody else knew that we were there. Now in the Dutch families,\non Sundays everybody gathers always on Sundays, right. Sunday meal. They just come by to\nsay hello to every...Sunday was horrendous for us because we had to stay in an upstairs little\nroom almost all Sunday and couldn't get out because the family was downstairs and they\nshouldn't see us. Uh what happened uh...",
        "A: I don't think very much. I mean you either sat...we knitted maybe. My brother...I don't know.\nI don't know. We didn't do very much. We did read. Uh but again we uh, the oldest daughter\nwould go to the library for us, but she couldn't get enough books for us. I mean we could\nread three books a day or, you know, easily, all of us. But she would get just a few books, so\nwe read. We read. But there was never enough because we, you know, she couldn't get\nenough books and there were no books in the house. There was no library. They were...the\nhusband was a barber and she was a beautician. They were not educated people. There were\nno books in the house really, so we...I guess we played Monopoly. We read a little bit. We\nuh...I don't know, I can't...we did...my mother and I would peel potatoes, you know, and and\nclean vegetables and do some cooking and do darning and so on. My brother had it much\nmore difficult. Uh there was very little food. Uh we uh...my hiding father as we called him,\nwould would get some food from the farmers because we were on the uh market right there\nand since he was a barber the farmers would come for a shave, and he would do some\ndealing with them, so he would get some vegetables and some fresh potatoes and we would\nget some food. Also he was really remarkable. He loved to uh get...defy the authority. I mean\nthat was his whole task there. I mean he loved it, so we had uh ration cards, but he had for\neverybody two, so we had...there were twelve fam...twelve people in the house. He had\ntwenty-four. So he, we had a little bit of more food than usual but still there was hardly any\nfood in the house and so there was a whole lot of tension about food in the house because\nyou cook for twelve people and and uh divide it up. It was very difficult and especially for\nthe hiding mother because she had her own children and us and it was horrendous and they\nwere all growing people, you know...they were all, like I said, from two to eighteen and I\nwas like thirteen, fourteen. My brother was sixteen, seventeen. I mean you could eat\nenormous amount of food. There was a lot of tension around food. Uh what happened...I\nthink in 1944...uh the hiding mother's youngest sister was pregnant and she needed some\nhelp and she asked me or my mother or somebody if I could help her. That meant that I had\nto go from the place where I was hiding to her house and uh for me again it was something\ndifferent, but I think you, you kind of learn to take a deep breathe and you walk and you\nhope nothing will happen, so I had to walk from the place I was hiding to her house, and then\nI slept overnight. I don't know how long it was, but I walked on the street there. I hadn't\nwalked on the street for a long time all by myself. And uh I stayed there and I don't know\nhow long - maybe a few weeks or a few months and helped her, which was was a welcomed\nchanged but there was also this fear that maybe my mother and my brother would be caught\nor that I would be caught, so...I mean...1t was very very tense is all I can say and very fearful.\nI was always very fearful. The worst fear that I had, and I can't tell for my mother and my\nbrother, that at night when there would be trucks coming through the streets, you would just\nlay in bed and you would just wait and you always anticipated that that truck would stop in\nfront of the house you were hiding in. The Germans would come out, bang on the door and\nwould get us, find us, and so trucks were like you would just lying in bed and if you heard\nsome noise you kind of hold it, and since we had no place to flee...most people, some people\nhad, in their hiding place, had another hiding place where they thought they would be safer.\nWe had nothing. Absolutely nothing to run to or to hide in. Nothing. So we were exposed\nand everything. Uh this didn't happen, you know. But there were many instances that the\nGermans would come in the barber shop and would ask for a shave and the man who hid us\nwould have to shave the German soldiers and we would be upstairs and we would never\nknow if they wanted to go to the bathroom or not, you know, because the bathroom was\nupstairs, so uh I can't really tell you exactly how frightened we were. I can't also tell you\nwhat we did because it's like one day was like the other and also you didn't really want to\nthink because you would hear things. We would get some bits of information and uh they\nwere all, like, you know, this man was caught and this man was caught and this family was\ncaught. You would hear that and we didn't really want to believe it because we hoped it\nwasn't true and we would maybe be next. We did have false identity cards. Uh we got them\nthrough another contact uh and again this was made uh so that we would...somehow we\nalways felt guilty that somebody did something for us. What happened is people would come\nto us and they had in their rain...raincoats all the paraphernalia to make false identity cards.\nNow uh they would come to us and they would go on the train, and if they would be caught\nthey would leave the raincoats there, but anyway they came to our house where we were\nhiding and would...gave us the...they did the whole thing with the stamping and the\nfingerprints and the whole thing. But it was always what if they were caught. It would be\nbecause of us, because they came to us to give us identity cards, and this really was like\nconstantly that we would feel so guilty that people were helping us. And that their lives was\nat...their lives were just uh in danger just like us and and everyone of them who knew about\nus, their life was in danger. Uh I remember that we didn't have any fuel and I was to go with\none of the...two of the children go to the road where there were little pieces of coal in the in\nthe road deck (ph) and we would go there and I was asked also to go because...well, I would\ndress up like any little Dutch girl with a kerchief on and wooden shoes and we would go to\nthe roadway and find little pieces of coal so we could have some fuel for a very little stove,\nso I could get out. My brother never got out because he was of the age that uh like, you\nknow, they needed him in in the work camps. Now one of the things that was...I'm glad that I\nremembered it...one of the most awful things happened in this family was that their oldest\nson was called up to go to a work camp. And there we were. We were hiding with them, and\nhe had to make a decision to go or not to go. What meant was if he wasn't going to go, we\nhad to leave because if he was going to go in hiding they were going to look for him and if\nhe was going to go to Germany to work camp, we would be...they were not going to look for\nhim, so we would be more or less safe. This man was a very religious Catholic and he\ndecided that he was going to go to the work camp. And I don't know what date that was. So\nhe went and we stayed. And we had no dealing at all in his decision making but again we felt\nlike he did it for us, because if he had decided not to go, we had to find another place and\nthat was very difficult. So he went and they didn't get very much mail from him, so there was\nthis constant kind of hanging over us - if he would die, he would die for us and and so we,\nyou know, you put this all together...denial is a wonderful thing...so we kind of lived with it\nand everybody else was there. Their daughter had married in the end of 1944, but all the\nother five children were there, so the daughter was married, he was in a work camp in\nGermany and the five children were there. But he wasn't there, so we were daily\nreminded...Walter was his name...wasn't there. He did come back from the work camp, but I\nalways felt for years and years that guilt that I had sent him to a work camp and we did some\ncorresponding and he said that part of his decision was adventure, but he suffered. Actually\nhe never did very well after he came back. He was like always extremely nervous and he\nretired early. Now we don't know if it was due to his experience in the work camp and just\nlike we don't know what our...if our our problems are because of the Holocaust or just maybe\njust, you know, problems. But I think his experiences in the work camp were horrendous and\nuh he he did come back, so that was...but the guilt of having...for him to make a decision to\ngo to Germany never left me, up until we corresponded, which was only a few years ago. Uh\nof course the whole thing with uh...we thought that autumn, that we would be liberated in\nSeptember of 1944 and we weren't and we had had such big hopes that we would be\nliberated and we had to go through the whole winter which was the hunger winter in\nHolland...there was no food...and I think we were all pretty depressed. Uh we would ask how\nlong...when will it be over, and he would say, the hiding father would say to me, and another\nday would go by...how long is it going to take and he would say soon, so we kind of...you\nknow...anyway the uh we were liberated in May the Sth. That winter was the most\nhorrendous winter because people died of hunger. Uh we just made it. There was food until\nthe last day and then the food was over (ph). Now I remember that I did not want to believe\neveryone that we were liberated because I did not want to be disappointed. I didn't believe it.\nThey would say...you know, we we heard that we were going to be lib...that we were\nliberated in May and I said no, it's not true. It's not true. I'm not going to go outside\nbecause...and everybody was kind of flocking...you know,going outside. Ah, we are\nliberated...and I...and they couldn't get me out because I...first of all I was afraid to go out but\nsecond of all I thought maybe if it isn't true, it's going to be worse. So they had to kind of\ndrag me out, to the outside, and then there was, it was...we were uh really liberated. Uh we\nstayed for quite a few weeks in, with the family and then my mother found an apartment in\nin in the Hague and went back to the Hague where we originally lived. Uh...uh...(pause) I\ncan only tell tell you what happened afterwards a little bit is that my brother was...a couple of\nmonths later was drafted into the...was supposed to be drafted into the Dutch army to fight in\nIndonesia so here we had already joined a Zionist organization and he decided to go illegally\nto Israel because he didn't want to go to Indonesia and fight or go into the Dutch army so\nmy...we had been together for thirty-three months in very small quarters and my brother left,\nearly '46 he left for Israel and we didn't see him for many years because, you know, we\nstayed in Holland for a few years. Uh now my grandparents and my uncle went also into\nhiding in the eastern part of Holland and they were in a barn on a farm and they were...they\nwere caught the week before the end of the war, but the Germans didn't know what to do\nwith them because they were in such a mess at that time and they put them in prison in in\nnearby village and kind of left them there while they fled and so they were saved. So my\nuncle, my my uh my uh grandparents survived also. My aunt, my fraternal aunt, uncle and\ncousins all died and uh one cousin who was about twenty years old uh had a uh extensive\nstamp collection and he sold his stamp collection in 1942, and with that money he wanted to\nbuy himself out of Holland. You know, you could, for a whole lot of money you could leave\nthe country. THey would get you over the border and over another border and so he did that\nand uh and I don't how much money but he was caught on the border of Holland and he was\nshot right there. He was killed uh very early also, in '42, '43. My uh oldest cousin uh married\nin 1942 her fiance. That's what people did...they married...they didn't want to be separated so\nwhat they did they married and then so that they could go together who knows where, and so\nmy uh oldest cousin married and she died in a concentration camp. Her husband also died in\na concentration camp, and then my, her mother, her father and her youngest sister all went,\nin December 1943, which was pretty late, uh to the Dutch camp, concentration camp\nRestabourk. Three days later they were sent to Auschwitz and my aunt and my youngest\ncousin died three days later and my uncle we don't know, and that whole family was was\nwiped out. Uh of my friends or my mother's friends, hardly anyone uh was saved. One very\nclose friend of my mother's survived. Uh her whole sister's family, husband and children, all\ndied. My mother's uh two other families, best friends and relations, all died...all left and died.\nUh uh one of my best friends survived with her whole family which was very unusual. But\nwhen we returned, I mean when we returned to the Hague we found this all out and it was\nlike horrendous because we thought...we didn't find back what we had left. We found\nnothing, that's what it was and we had to start our lives all over again and so what one thing\nwe did was join the Zionist organization to kind of have something that belonged to us, you\nknow, that was...we could relate to these people because either they had been in hiding or\nthey, because they were Jewish. We uh...I met my husband in the Zionist organization and he\nuh had promised his parents that he would help them settle in the United States, and he went\nin uh 1947, he went in '47 went to the United States while I finished my schooling.\nNow important to know is that our schooling was interrupted. I had finished elementary\nschool and when I was, came out of hiding I was fifteen years old and had no high school, so\nafter the war I went to evening high school and I went to during the day I went to school for\nhome economics. Uh but I mean the evening high school was like not very much and so that\npart uh you know, not having any really good education was terribly interrupted.",
        "A: Well, we came twice because I joined then my fiance in 1949, early, in January of '49 I came\nto the States with my mother. Uh and we got married in '49. We left in uh '41, 'S1 for Israel,\nbecause our plan was really always uh always to go to Israel. We went to Israel for five years\nbut my husband's family was here in the States and he had no one in Israel, so in 1955 we\nwent to Holland and stayed in Holland for a year and came back in 1956 to the United\nStates. Now my brother remained tn Israel and has a big family. He's married, has four\nchildren. Uh one of them died in the war with Lebanon. His oldest son died, and that\nwas...we were kind of rebuilding our family and this was the first death in the family. Uh so\nwe came back in '56. Now my daughter was born in Israel in 1951 and my son was born in\n1958 in uh in the United States. Uh and we settled in West Chester.",
