        "Question: I am Leslie Swift, speaking on behalf of the United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum, on September 20\", in New York, and I am speaking to Benni\nKorzen. And I would just like to start by asking what can you remember \u2014 I know\nyou were very young at the time that all of this happened. Can you tell me a little\nbit, if anything, that you remember from before the war?",
        "Answer: Sure. I was five, five and a half when, as a result of a very chao \u2014 chaotic\nand unplanned-for rescue operation, where people got together who had never been\ninvolved in saving anybody, decided to get together, save their Jewish neighbors.\nAnd so at \u2014 at five and a half years, oh you know, I\u2014 you\u2019re old enough to know\nwhat\u2019s going on, and I remember everything that I \u2014 the highlights. But let me just\ngo back and \u2014 and also just explain that I was born in \u2014 in Denmark, and from ninet\n\u2014 from April \u2014 Denmark was occupied by Germany, April of 1940, and for three\nyears, a little more than three years, for reasons that anybody whose \u2014 knows about\nhistory, the Germans pretty much left the population, including the Jewish\npopulation of Denmark, sort of alone. One reason was that the German war\nmachine, you know, took advantage of the fact that in Denmark there was a huge\nproduction of butter and bacon and all ho \u2014 and stuff like that. So it made sense not\nto cause any trouble there. Then, something happened in August and September of\nSeptember 18, 2015\n\u201943, as aresult of which things changed. And essentially, orders came from Berlin\nto round up and arrest all \u2014 and, you know, remove all of the dangerous Jews, and\nbring them down to concentration camps. Anyway, the \u2014 what \u2014 what happened to\nme was, my parents, in those chaotic days, which were in October of 1943, not\nknowing exactly what would happen, they decided to place me with a non-Jewish\nfamily, a colleague of my father, they were both lawyers, and they fer \u2014 they\nthought that would be the safer thing to do. And as it turned out, it \u2014 you know, it \u2014\nit worked out. I was there, and I stayed there for six to seven weeks, and then one\nnight somebody came and picked me up and took me acor \u2014 you know, during the\nmiddle of the night, and I ended up on a boat, and was sailed across to Sweden,\nwhere my father had been nervously waiting for a few days. And we then ended up\nin Stockholm, and stayed there until May, 1945, when we then went back to\nDenmark. There are some details that \u2014 that \u2014 along the way that I think are\nimportant to nat \u2014 to \u2014 to know. What happened between 19 \u2014 April \u201940, and\nAugust, or so, 1943, was this relative calm. Then, the \u2014 basically Eichmann\ndecided, and the order came from his office to, you know, not \u2014 no longer, you\nknow, leave the Jews alone. What happened then factually, was that a low ranking \u2014\nI think he was a trade attach\u00e9 at the German embassy in Copenhagen, saw a telefax\ncome in that wi-without any sp \u2014 you know, that \u2014 that gave him the informationSeptember 18, 2015\nthat there was a \u2014 a Gestapo order now, to round up the Jews. He decided, without\ntelling anybody, to tell a Danish friend, who \u2014 whom he knew was \u2014 wa-was, you\nknow, a person who \u2014 who would take that information. And that person took it to a\nhigh ranking politician, who went to the rabbi, and said, listen, this is about to\nhappen. And the rabbi \u2014 and the rabbi said, I don\u2019t believe that. And there \u2014 th-the\nreason why he didn\u2019t believe that, was that the king, King Christian the tenth, had,\nfrom the time Denmark was occupied, given out many signals that all added up to,\nnobody touches anybody, because \u2014 as long as I\u2019m the king. And \u2014 and he would\nsort of demonstrate his attitude by when he took his morning ride, horse ride,\nthrough the streets of Copenhagen, whenever he was then saluted by German\nsoldiers, he would simply turn his head away, ignoring them. And so, for three\nyears \u2014 three and a half years, everybody felt that with the king in charge, nothing\nbad would happen. And that led to the rabbi\u2019s reaction. However, wi \u2014 faced with\nthe very sh \u2014 harsh information, he then \u2014 the rabbi then changed his mind, and at a\ncertain sermon \u2014 evening in the synagogue in Copenhagen, word came out and\nspread like \u2014 like 1-1-instantly. The Jewish population at that time was a little under\n8,000, and 90 percent or so, lived in Copenhagen. So it was a very easy way to \u2014\nthrough \u2014 not through anything, other than word of mouth, for everybody to be\nreached. And that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s when this come \u2014 sort of chaotic and spontaneous \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 18, 2015\nwell, it was spontaneous and \u2014 but also, surrounded by chaos, because nobody had\ndone anything of this nature before. That a rescue operation that then took ple \u2014 the\n\u2014 the major numbers of people who \u2014 who were taken over, happened in October of\n1943.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t go until November, I think.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t go until November, and stayed with his family, where \u2014 where \u2014 because\nthe family had two daughters my age, I sort of \u2014 I\u2014 I \u2014 as I remember that time, 1-it\nwas an exciting time, because th-th-they \u2014 they treated me as I \u2014 I suddenly became\na member of a new family.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And \u2014 and there was a very nice house, and so 1-it was \u2014 it was \u2014 you know, I\nwas kept away totally, from the reality of what was happening.",
        "Q: Right. So as \u2014 continuing to speak about what you remember from that time, do\nyou remember being taken to the house, or \u2014 I mean, do y \u2014",
        "A: No, I remember being then taken from the house in \u2014 it was November 17\", and\nthe reason I know that date is that a very nice friend, a journalist, a Danish journ-\njournalist, dug up information that has to do with when we then \u2014 when all these\nDanish Jews arrived in Sweden, there was another sort of chaotic \u2014 under the chaos\nof \u2014 because nobody arrived in \u2014 in \u2014 at given points.\nSeptember 18, 2015",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The \u2014 the boats that took us over ranged from long boats to, you know, large\nfishing trawlers. And they ended up wherever they could. And wherever that\nhappened, the Swedish police took notes, and you know, took the information who\n\u2014 who \u2014 who had arrived. And so, I have a copy of that, dated November the 18\",\nwhere I, as a five and a half year old boy, described as \u2014 with, you know, not able to\nspeak Swedish, which I then le \u2014 later learned \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, of course.",
        "A: \u2014 cause I went to first grade there. And what I remember is that the night when I\nwas picked up by two very nice people that I had never seen before, one of whom\ngave me acomic strip, aba \u2014a\u2014a-\u2014was a\u2014",
        "Q: A comic book\u2019?",
        "A: A comic book.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Which I fo \u2014 thought was fascinating.",
        "Q: So that \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 did \u2014 he or she bought it?",
        "A: So this [indecipherable] yeah.",
        "Q: Oh, wow.September 18, 2015",
        "A: A-A-And then we drove, and I think if \u2014 this was not a fast thing. I think it took\nabout 24 hours, because I remember I \u2014 I was sleeping and then waking up, and\nthen it was the next night. All the \u2014 the \u2014 the core things took place at night, because\nthe German patrol boats covered the water between Denmark and Sweden, across\nwhich all of these both \u2014 boats sailed. So, it was probably something like 36 hours,\nand I do remember that when I was then placed on a boat, a brusque voice from, I\nguess th-the guy in charge, said, kid, you puke on this boat, and I throw you\noverboard. So you better behave. And it was said with some kind of a \u2014 you know, a\ntinge of humor, so I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t \u2014 it didn\u2019t scare me, it was just, hey, I be \u2014\nokay, I better behave here. And th-the crossing was fast, because this was a \u2014 a very\nfast moving boat. And at the other end, my fa \u2014 of course, in Sweden, my father\nthen, who had come down from Stockholm, where my parents had been settled, he\nhad been waiting there for three days, not knowing \u2014 it\u2019s not exactly like th-the\nschedule is this, you know\u2019?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So he was very happy, and \u2014 and then we ended up in Stockholm, and stayed\nthere until May of 1945.",
        "Q: A-And so, wh-what \u2014 what was your life like in Stockholm?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 18, 2015",
        "A: It \u2014 it was, under the circumstances, I \u2014 I \u2014 I was then \u2014 by the time I turned six,\nin the spring of \u201944, I was enrolled in a local school, first grade. And you know, that\nbecame a \u2014 a new f \u2014 lifestyle, that totally took me into a new world, and therefore,\nthe war had sort of vanished completely from our lives \u2014 from my life. Of course, in\nthe case of my parents it was different, because my father was given the task as a \u2014\nas an attorney, to deal with settlements by the Jewish community, the legal aspects\nof it. Bu-But, you know, that was not very much part of my life. I \u2014 I was \u2014",
        "Q: So, d-do you remember that your parents were anxious about anything, or it was\njust sort of like oh, this is our new life, or \u2014",
        "A: No, they were anxious and nervous because \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 they knew what \u2014 what was going on. But it was not until sometime late April\nof 1945, that a new event totally took me by surprise. It was a night \u2014 in the middle\nof the night, I hear voices that I never heard before. And I went into the kitchen of\nthe apartment where we live, and there were \u2014 this is like four a.m. My parents were\nset \u2014 were seated, and my uncle and aunt were sitting right next to them. And what\nhad happened was that in 1940 \u2014 and during the October days, when everybody\ntried to get across to Sweden, they were captured, along with a group of \u2014 of \u2014 of\npeople. They were \u2014 they had been hiding in a small village near the coast, whereSeptember 18, 2015\nthey were hoping to get off to Sweden. And they were then taken down to the\nTheresienstadt concentration camp. And they stayed there until April of \u00b045, when\nthey were rescued by, and taken to Sweden in those white buses that\n[indecipherable] had arranged. And so, at four a.m. I hear these voices, and I \u2014 I\nwalk in there. Th-Th-The \u2014 I knew them, but you know, at five before everything\nhappened, we had visited them, so \u2014 and I certainly recognized them. And they had\nsurvived without being able to function \u2014",
        "Q: To escape.",
        "A: \u2014 at four a.m., and having a meal, and so on. And I \u2014 and \u2014 and I do remember\nthat at some point, a \u2014 a\u2014 I\u2019m just standing there, and nobody is even paying\nattention to me, and I see my \u2014 my \u2014 my mother says to my Uncle Ben, don\u2019t eat\nthis, this is not fresh butter. Pll \u2014 ll \u2014 you know, PIl get you some fresh butter. To\nwhich he said, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s fresh enough for me. Now \u2014",
        "Q: So \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 what \u2014 what we \u2014 to \u2014 to finish that story, what happened was that the war\nended, and May fifth, Denmark was freed, and \u2014 and open again. And very shortly\nthereafter, we returned from Sweden, to \u2014 to Denmark. And we found our\napartment pretty much exactly the way we had left it during those chaotic days,\nbecause a neighbor had taken care of it.\nSeptember 18, 2015",
        "Q: And can \u2014 can you tell us more about that? I mean, do you know who that\nneighbor was? Do you remember that person from before the war, or \u2014",
        "A: Yes. It was a next door neighbor, and \u2014 but there were other people because I\nthink the next door neighbor had \u2014 there was a death in the family. An-Anyway, it \u2014\nit was a \u2014 1-1t \u2014 1t \u2014 1t was neighbors who took care of it. And I think that my parents\nwere totally, you know, astounded that this \u2014 and of course very happy, and \u2014 and \u2014\nand so, in celebration, what they had brought back from Sweden was a certain kind\nof chocolate that during the \u2014 during the war in Denmark, you know, you can\u2019t get\nchocolate, so what happened was there was a big party, where all the kids in \u2014 in the\n\u2014 in the complex where we lived, were invited up, and it \u2014 it was a sort of a \u2014 it \u2014 it\nwas a party that took several days, that ended up \u2014 that ended our Sweden odyssey.",
        "Q: And when did you come to the U.S., and how did that happen?",
        "A: That did not take place until \u201963. What happened was, before that, in ni \u2014 in\n1960, I star \u2014 as a young, you know, 22 year old kid, I went to wor \u2014 I \u2014 I started\nworking f \u2014 at a movie company aa \u2014 as a\u2014 you know, a P.A, a production\nassistant. One day, arrived a crew of five people from CBS in New York. They\ncame to Denmark in order to do a documentary about the rescue of the Danish\nJews. And so I was attached \u2014 I\u2014 I spoke English, and I was attached to them as\ntheir sort of show \u2014 their \u2014 their guide. And what happened was, we went around\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 18, 2015\nand interviewed a number of the people who had been actively involved in the\nrescue operation. And a-at some point, we sat in the town of Elsinore, which is on\nthe coast, five miles across the water from Sweden, at the office of a bookbinder,\nwho \u2014 whose last name is Kerr(ph). And he spoke not a word of English, so I not\nonly had to, you know, translate, but also sort of try to interpret what he was saying.\nAnd that \u2014 it was fine, it went on for 20 minutes, and the CBS writer got all the\ninformation he wanted, until suddenly Mr. Kerr(ph) turned to me and said in\nDanish, listen, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m busy, I\u2019m a busy guy. Get these damn Americans\nout, I\u2019ve had enough of them. Which was a \u2014 which made it slightly tricky for me to\ntranslate, and I didn\u2019t quite know how to handle that. But I wa \u2014 I was sort of saved\nby the bell, because in walk \u2014 into his office walked another man and \u2014 and \u2014 who\nwas Clearly a \u2014 his, you know, assistant, or friend, whatever, because he was then\nintroduced to all of us. And when it came to me, and \u2014 and he heard my last name,\nhe said, wait a minute, I \u2014 I remember that. Then it turned out that wha \u2014 what\nunfolded was sort of a \u2014 a\u2014 wa-was as follows: it turned out that this man who\ncame in, whose last name was Larsen(ph), had been the assistant of Kerr(ph)\nduring the transportations, and what then ev \u2014 developed was that it was on\nKerr\u2019s(ph) boat that I had been taken across. And he was the one who said, if you\npuke, you go overboard. And so, all of this happened within two minutes. And h\u2014\nSeptember 18, 2015\nand of course, Kerr(ph) changed his attitude, and we stayed and had beer and\n[indecipherable] and \u2014 and lunch, and stayed for hours. And then the next day, that\nstory was then made part of the \u2014 of \u2014 of the documentary. And again, I was,\nbecause Kerr(ph) still didn\u2019t speak a word of English, I had to sort of tran \u2014\ntranslate everything he said. He then \u2014 his story, as part of \u2014 of \u2014 of the people\nrescuing, you know, their Danish neighbors, Danish Jewish neighbors, was that he\ncontinued sailing across, even into 1943 - \u201944, the spring, in spite of the fact that it\ngot increasingly difficult, because there were more and more patrols boats. And so\nit was only on nights without any moon that \u2014 that he could cross without being\nseen. And what did help his \u2014 his enterprise was that he went \u2014 he was sort of a\u2014a\nScarlet Pimpernel of \u2014 you know, he \u2014 he didn\u2019t pay much attention to his own\nsafety. He \u2014 he \u2014 he went from a very small boat, to a f\u2014 pa \u2014 bigger boat, and by\nthe time, in November of \u00b043, he had a \u2014 as, under the circumstance, a very fast\nboat. And so, he managed to do this until he was caught and almost killed in 1944,\nand he spent a year in \u2014 in a concentration camp. He also, obviously, survived,\nbecause we had this wonderful lunch and thing in \u2014 in \u2014 in [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And \u2014 and \u2014 and so, did \u2014 did you talk at all about why he was motivated to do\nwhat he did?September 18, 2015",
        "A: Yes, we did, and his style was \u2014 he said \u2014 and I translated verbatim, and it ended\nup in the film, he said, I didn\u2019t rescue the Jews, or anybody, because I liked them. I\ndid it because I hated the Germans. That was \u2014 I mean, that \u2014 that \u2014 that was what\nhe said. Obviously, there was more to it, but that was what came out of his mouth.",
        "Q: Or he hated fascism, or he hated, you know \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 the government, or whatever.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s very interesting, and \u2014 so, one question I had, just\nwhen reading your story was, when this documentary was made, was it because the\nEichmann trial was going on, or was there any relationship to that?",
        "A: No, I\u2014 I \u2014 that may have been part of \u2014 of the thing, but I think more to the point\nwas that the producer of the CBS documentary, you know, had a personal interest.\nHe thought this was a very important story to show his viewers, and it \u2014 it became \u2014\nit was part of what was then the Sunday morning \u2014 CBS had Sunday morning \u2014 this\nbefore cable and anything. And so the public affairs-type service that was given\nmostly by CBS \u2014 and NBC, and AB \u2014 ABC and NBC did not do the same thing. So\nthey had a whole department of \u2014 of people on fi \u2014 on 11\", and 57\" Street, in the\nproduction office. And \u2014 and they did whatever they thought was important. And\nSeptember 18, 2015\nso, they told this story because they wanted th-the American \u2014 the American\nviewers to see it. And it was broadcast twice, because it did make \u2014 it was the first\ntime a\u2014a TV program had done this. Books had been written that \u2014 before, and\nmany ca-came afterwards, dealing with the same subject, so \u2014",
        "Q: And do you \u2014 do you know any other people who were rescued? I mean, 1s there\nany kind of community that you maintain because of, sort of that shared experience,\nor you\u2019re just an American now, or \u2014",
        "A: A few, but bi \u2014 because I have a very large family; my father is one of seven, my\nmother one of four, it was mo \u2014 it was more [phone ringing] I\u2019m sorry about this \u2014\nit was more \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s okay. [break] Talk a little bit more about coming to the U.S. \u2014",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: \u2014 and why and when, and how that whole thing \u2014 how it \u2014 how it all happened.",
        "A: Well, then, because of the contact that I made with the people at \u2014 at CBS, which\nlasted after they went back to New York from Copenhagen, they worked on the\nprogram, and then I got a call, would I \u2014 would I like to come to New York,\nbecause I could help sort of put it together, and then I \u2014 I stayed. I \u2014 I went back a\ncouple times, but I ended up liking New York, I thought it was very exciting, and I\n\u2014 they gave me a job, sort of being a production manager for a number of programsSeptember 18, 2015\nthat came out of the same office. The \u2014 the public affairs Sunday morning\nprograms. There were two shows, \u201cLamp Unto My Feet,\u201d and \u2014 and \u201cLook up\nand Live.\u201d Those were the two programs. And this precedes you know, cable, and \u2014\nand there \u2014 everything else. So, th \u2014 I\u2014I got stuck here, and I met a young lady in\n1964, and got married three \u2014 two and a half months after we met, and that is now\n51 years ago.",
        "Q: And now you\u2019re in California.",
        "A: And now \u2014 then we mo-moved from L.A. \u2014 from New York to L.A. in 1990,\nbecause we made a movie there, and it was easier to \u2014 to sti \u2014 to then stay, yes.",
        "Q: So what \u2014 I mean, just \u2014 just to go back to what you remember from the time,\nwhat sticks with you? What is \u2014 I guess what \u2014 what do you really sort of have clear\nmemories of?",
        "A: I have a very clear memory of spending something like an hour on a fast moving\nboat, because what also happened was in October \u2014 in November of 1943, pretty\nmuch all the Jews had been crossed \u2014 ha-had crossed to Sweden, and so those \u2014 th-\nthe transports then took care of \u2014 had people such as \u2014 on the boat it wa \u2014 it was a \u2014\nan RAF pilot who had parachuted over Denmark, and he had to get \u2014 be gotten out.\nThe Royal Air Force, you know, the British air force. And there were some other\npeople. So, later on, while I was still six or seven, and we talked about th-the \u2014 the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 18, 2015\ncrossing, I \u2014 I wi\u2014 my father said something, and I said, well, it was me and the\nother saboteurs that \u2014 that crossed th-the water. I \u2014 and because it was sort of a\u2014a\nvery \u2014 it was the first time I\u2019d bid \u2014 bid \u2014 been on a \u2014 on a boat of that type. It may\nhave been the first time I\u2019d e-e \u2014 been on a boat, ever. You know, as a five year \u2014\nand a half year old boy, I was very excited about how it worked, and \u2014 and since, at\nthat time, unlike before, during the really chaotic days in \u2014 in \u2014 in October, where s-\nsometimes young children were a\u2014 you know, given sleeping pills, or whatever, to\nmake sure that they would not make noise, this was different. And I guess th-the \u2014\nMr. Kerr(ph) took a chance. I guess he talked to me, and the way I responded made\nhim believe that it was not necessary to \u2014 to, you know, give me an injection to \u2014\nfor \u2014 for me to keep quiet. So, by the time we arrived in \u2014 near Helsingborg in\nSweden, which is across from the shortest distance from Denmark, I\u2019ve \u2014 as we\nmoved into the harbor, along the \u2014 the side, I \u2014 I saw my father from the boat, and\nhe was there with \u2014 I think with a policeman, nervously pacing back and forth. So\nthat\u2019s what I do remember.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and do you remember getting off the boat, and then seeing your father and\nbeing reunited, or \u2014",
        "A: Well, th-the mi \u2014 the image I remember is, as we moved into \u2014 towards, you\nknow, like maybe 25 yards before the boat actually moored. And then what\nSeptember 18, 2015\nhappened, I don\u2019t remember, but obviously what \u2014 what did happen was that we\ntook a train, my father and I, to Stockholm, where we reunited with my mother.",
        "Q: Right. I\u2014 I\u2014 I\u2014 I just asked that question because I\u2019m the mother of a couple of\nsix year old boys, and I can\u2019t imagine, you know, being that person who was\nwaiting for your child to arrive, and \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. And one reason why, during the interview where I discover \u2014 where\neverybody discovered that the boat had \u2014 actually had me on board, what actually\nhappened was that the man who walked in with a severe limp, because he\u2019d been\ninjured during the war, where his fellow \u2014 Mr. Kerr(ph) was almost killed, when he\nwas introduced to me, and remember the last name, which 1s somewhat unusual,\nthere \u2014 the \u2014 the reason why he remembered that was that my father had, as a gift,\nmade \u2014 given him a silver cigarette \u2014 he was a smoker \u2014 and had engraved in it, a\nthank you note from him, last name being Korzen. So, the name had sort of se \u2014\nwas a name that this guy \u2014",
        "Q: Remembered.",
        "A: \u2014 remembered very clearly.",
        "Q: So \u2014 I don\u2019t know how to end the interview. Any \u2014 1-is there anything else you\nwould like to say, to tell us today?",
        "A: Well, the \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 18, 2015",
        "Q: I mean, what does your experience \u2014 how does that inform your day to day life\ntoday?",
        "A: What happened then, where basically people put themselves at \u2014 at risk, and \u2014\nand many died, is an example that sort of stands as a, you know, role model for\nhuman behavior. Now, what we\u2019re witnessing these days, having to do with\nrefugees, and \u2014 and immigration, and people trying to escape alive from either war,\nor related horrible \u2014 horrible to human situation, 1-1-1s \u2014 is the opposite. And it\nwould be very nice if this example, which is not really that known, could be, let\u2019s\nsay, elevated a-as the role model to \u2014 for everybody to \u2014 to \u2014 to imitate. How that 1s\nto be done, remains to be seen. Obviously, it \u2014 it would take \u2014 1t would take a \u2014 an\nattitude that is the total opposite of what\u2019s happening right now. This is 19 \u2014 this is\n2015, where, as we witness the debate about who we are, and what we should do,\nand what we should allow, the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 as I see it, the idiocy of doing the\nopposite of what this country 1s all based on. This country is based on having people\ncome here, and then start a life that ends up making a country as good as it can be,\nbecause of the people. So there \u2014 so therefore the \u2014 whenever the opposite is being\nadvocated, that to me sounds like it\u2019s based on idiocy, it\u2019s based on ignorance, and\nanything we can do to counteract that, w-we \u2014 we all have, I think, a responsibility\nto do.\nSeptember 18, 2015",
        "Q: Thank you. Okay, can we cut for a minute, and let\u2019s \u2014 [break] Can you tell me a\nlittle bit about what you remember from life before the Holocaust, you know, did \u2014\nwas your family religious? Did \u2014 did you go to synagogue, that kind of thing.",
        "A: The answer is no. The previous germ \u2014 our gran \u2014 my grandparents, were\nsomewhat religious. They did not \u2014 they did celebrate the \u2014 the \u2014 the high holidays.\nI was Bar Mitzvahed when \u2014 13, as the \u2014 as the last of my sibling, and so we were,\nand still are, what you would call secular Jews. When our son turned 13, and we\nlived in New York at that time, we did not \u2014 what we did was, we sent him to be\ntutored by a Yiddish poet, who tutored kids, and dealt with everything Jewish,\nexcept for religion: history, music, culture, etcetera. And so, he got his \u2014 his\nupbringing in the same secular tradition. When my wife and I got \u2014 when I got\nmarried, which was in 1964, we went down to city hall in \u2014 in \u2014 in New York, but\nwe really didn\u2019t like the AstroTurf floor, and \u2014 and couldn\u2019t see ourselves, sort of,\ndoing the \u2014 the ceremony there. So we ended up, we lived on the Upper West Side\nof Manhattan, and we ended up finding a rabbi in a synagogue, who was willing to\nmarry us with the understanding that we were secular Jews. And so he \u2014 he\npromised to stay away from subject that had to do with \u2014 that would not really\nconnect with being a secular Jew. And 1\u2014 and the only thing he \u2014 a-and \u2014 and he\nsaid, so let\u2019s do it in my chambers, you know, not in the \u2014 in the big space, where\nSeptember 18, 2015\nactually, I think the synagogue seats about 3,000 people. So, we came there with\neight friends, and he changed his mind, he said no, let\u2019s go into the big space, even\nthough we are only 12 people. And so, you know, be-be-because he wanted to\ndemonstrate that he could deliver a \u2014 a sermon for people like us, and \u2014 and he \u2014\nand I \u2014 I\u2019ve \u2014 he did. So, he managed to stay away from, you know, the word God.\nAnd yet, he \u2014 he did not violate his own, let\u2019s say background and principles of\nbeing a rabbi. He \u2014 he knew how to do \u2014 to \u2014 to have that \u2014 that balance. So my \u2014\nthe fact that I was \u2014 went through a Bar Mitzvah, I \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m happy and proud\nof it, even though the truth is that very shortly thereafter, I lost the ability to s \u2014 to\nspeak whatever Hebrew I had learned. Which 1s what you need to understand, and \u2014\nan-and you know, it\u2019s like, it just ended up in \u2014 1n \u2014 in retrospect it\u2019s \u2014 it was a nice\nexperience, it was a nice thing that happened.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But it has not influenced our lives, going forward.",
        "Q: Right, right. And do you ha \u2014 do you feel a commonality with other Holocaust\nsurvivors, or do you feel, you know, that your experience was \u2014 because there \u2014 one\nthing we learn in this, you know, at the hol \u2014 at the museum, is that there are so\nmany different experiences. It is, you know, people say Holocaust survivor, but it is\na very diverse sort of set of circumstances.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 18, 2015",
        "A: It\u2019s a very diverse \u2014 yes. One thing that happened very early on, after I settle in\nNew York was my wife and I, we met a\u2014 a young girl our age, and for reasons that\nneither of us understood, we sort of \u2014 we became fast friends, and still are. This is\nnow 50 years later. She happened to be \u2014 she\u2019s my age, and she was a \u2014 she 1s a\nsurvivor, but under much more dramatic osten \u2014 circumstances, in that she was\nsaved by her grandmother, who was with her. And this was \u2014 she \u2014 she was born in\nBerlin, and under circumstances that cannot be described any other than\nmiraculous, survived, and ended up in sw \u2014 in Sweden, in Stockholm. And by the\ntime we met her in 1964 in New York, she had, like I, sort of gravitated from\nwherever, but \u2014 and had no longer \u2014 the fact that she was a German Jewish girl, had\ntotally changed into, she was now a New Yorker. But \u2014 but her story, and her\nattitude, and her whole demeanor, clearly was something that, you know, it made an\nimpression, and you know, th-the bond that \u2014 it\u2019s not that my story has much to do\nwith hers, because mine is a happy end, and hers is a bittersweet, with a happy end.\nSo, it is a very big difference.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, yes. So I would like to thank you for coming, and doing this.",
        "A: Sure.\nSeptember 18, 2015",
        "Q: And I \u2014 I think \u2014 am I missing anything? I said that already, but \u2014 so, can you tell\nme anything you remember about right before, and you know, were \u2014 what \u2014 was\nthere anti-Semitism, do you remember feeling that?",
        "A: No, growing up in Denmark, as \u2014 in Copenhagen as I did, the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the\n\u2014 the life that began after I came back in 1945, had \u2014 there was n-no anti-Semitism,\nor any other, let\u2019s say negative aspect of \u2014 of life. Denmark was then a society that\nhad very few prejudices. The Danish \u2014 the Jewish community in Copenhagen, that\nhad been there for a few hundred years, because in 16-something, the king of\nDenmark had invited a \u2014 a bunch of Jews from Germany or wherever, in sort of\nmiddle Europe, to settle, because he was an \u2014 an enterprising builder-type king, and\nhe\u2019d heard that having Jews around would be helpful. And so, from that moment\non, the Jewish community grew, and by the time we get to World War II, there\nwere, in Danish culture, a huge impact of the Jewish artists and playwrights, and so\non. One play that is always part of the repertory of the Royal Theater in\nCopenhagen, is written by a Jew, and \u2014 and deals with a Jewish holiday, and the\nreason for that. So, the au \u2014 so th-the \u2014 when I \u2014 un-until I left in 1964 and settled in\nNew York, the \u2014 th-the \u2014 being Jewish in Denmark was almost something that\npeople would boast of, or having a Jewish grandmother, etcetera. Things have\nchanged because there have been at \u2014 b-both because of politics, and so on, a-and\nSeptember 18, 2015\nbecause of Europe now is \u2014 1s a different continent than it was then. So th-th-the\nwonderful \u2014 let\u2019s say the \u2014 the days of peace and prosperity and cultural exuberance\nthat I re-relate to, when I was very young, that has changed, unfortunately, in the\nnegative direction.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Yeah. And, do you go back to Denmark?",
        "A: Yes, we go \u2014 we go quite often, at least once every two years. My very large\nfamily loves coming here. And so, we s \u2014 th-they come here more often than we go\nthere. But, you know, we are \u2014 you know, with everything, such as Skype and so\non, we \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 we Stay in very close contact.",

    "answers": [
        "Answer: Sure. I was five, five and a half when, as a result of a very chao \u2014 chaotic\nand unplanned-for rescue operation, where people got together who had never been\ninvolved in saving anybody, decided to get together, save their Jewish neighbors.\nAnd so at \u2014 at five and a half years, oh you know, I\u2014 you\u2019re old enough to know\nwhat\u2019s going on, and I remember everything that I \u2014 the highlights. But let me just\ngo back and \u2014 and also just explain that I was born in \u2014 in Denmark, and from ninet\n\u2014 from April \u2014 Denmark was occupied by Germany, April of 1940, and for three\nyears, a little more than three years, for reasons that anybody whose \u2014 knows about\nhistory, the Germans pretty much left the population, including the Jewish\npopulation of Denmark, sort of alone. One reason was that the German war\nmachine, you know, took advantage of the fact that in Denmark there was a huge\nproduction of butter and bacon and all ho \u2014 and stuff like that. So it made sense not\nto cause any trouble there. Then, something happened in August and September of\nSeptember 18, 2015\n\u201943, as aresult of which things changed. And essentially, orders came from Berlin\nto round up and arrest all \u2014 and, you know, remove all of the dangerous Jews, and\nbring them down to concentration camps. Anyway, the \u2014 what \u2014 what happened to\nme was, my parents, in those chaotic days, which were in October of 1943, not\nknowing exactly what would happen, they decided to place me with a non-Jewish\nfamily, a colleague of my father, they were both lawyers, and they fer \u2014 they\nthought that would be the safer thing to do. And as it turned out, it \u2014 you know, it \u2014\nit worked out. I was there, and I stayed there for six to seven weeks, and then one\nnight somebody came and picked me up and took me acor \u2014 you know, during the\nmiddle of the night, and I ended up on a boat, and was sailed across to Sweden,\nwhere my father had been nervously waiting for a few days. And we then ended up\nin Stockholm, and stayed there until May, 1945, when we then went back to\nDenmark. There are some details that \u2014 that \u2014 along the way that I think are\nimportant to nat \u2014 to \u2014 to know. What happened between 19 \u2014 April \u201940, and\nAugust, or so, 1943, was this relative calm. Then, the \u2014 basically Eichmann\ndecided, and the order came from his office to, you know, not \u2014 no longer, you\nknow, leave the Jews alone. What happened then factually, was that a low ranking \u2014\nI think he was a trade attach\u00e9 at the German embassy in Copenhagen, saw a telefax\ncome in that wi-without any sp \u2014 you know, that \u2014 that gave him the informationSeptember 18, 2015\nthat there was a \u2014 a Gestapo order now, to round up the Jews. He decided, without\ntelling anybody, to tell a Danish friend, who \u2014 whom he knew was \u2014 wa-was, you\nknow, a person who \u2014 who would take that information. And that person took it to a\nhigh ranking politician, who went to the rabbi, and said, listen, this is about to\nhappen. And the rabbi \u2014 and the rabbi said, I don\u2019t believe that. And there \u2014 th-the\nreason why he didn\u2019t believe that, was that the king, King Christian the tenth, had,\nfrom the time Denmark was occupied, given out many signals that all added up to,\nnobody touches anybody, because \u2014 as long as I\u2019m the king. And \u2014 and he would\nsort of demonstrate his attitude by when he took his morning ride, horse ride,\nthrough the streets of Copenhagen, whenever he was then saluted by German\nsoldiers, he would simply turn his head away, ignoring them. And so, for three\nyears \u2014 three and a half years, everybody felt that with the king in charge, nothing\nbad would happen. And that led to the rabbi\u2019s reaction. However, wi \u2014 faced with\nthe very sh \u2014 harsh information, he then \u2014 the rabbi then changed his mind, and at a\ncertain sermon \u2014 evening in the synagogue in Copenhagen, word came out and\nspread like \u2014 like 1-1-instantly. The Jewish population at that time was a little under\n8,000, and 90 percent or so, lived in Copenhagen. So it was a very easy way to \u2014\nthrough \u2014 not through anything, other than word of mouth, for everybody to be\nreached.

        "A: I didn\u2019t go until November, and stayed with his family, where \u2014 where \u2014 because\nthe family had two daughters my age, I sort of \u2014 I\u2014 I \u2014 as I remember that time, 1-it\nwas an exciting time, because th-th-they \u2014 they treated me as I \u2014 I suddenly became\na member of a new family.",
        "A: And \u2014 and there was a very nice house, and so 1-it was \u2014 it was \u2014 you know, I\nwas kept away totally, from the reality of what was happening.",
        "A: No, I remember being then taken from the house in \u2014 it was November 17\", and\nthe reason I know that date is that a very nice friend, a journalist, a Danish journ-\njournalist, dug up information that has to do with when we then \u2014 when all these\nDanish Jews arrived in Sweden, there was another sort of chaotic \u2014 under the chaos\nof \u2014 because nobody arrived in \u2014 in \u2014 at given points.\nSeptember 18, 2015",
        "A: The \u2014 the boats that took us over ranged from long boats to, you know, large\nfishing trawlers. And they ended up wherever they could. And wherever that\nhappened, the Swedish police took notes, and you know, took the information who\n\u2014 who \u2014 who had arrived. And so, I have a copy of that, dated November the 18\",\nwhere I, as a five and a half year old boy, described as \u2014 with, you know, not able to\nspeak Swedish, which I then le \u2014 later learned \u2014",

I think it took\nabout 24 hours, because I remember I \u2014 I was sleeping and then waking up, and\nthen it was the next night. All the \u2014 the \u2014 the core things took place at night, because\nthe German patrol boats covered the water between Denmark and Sweden, across\nwhich all of these both \u2014 boats sailed. So, it was probably something like 36 hours,\nand I do remember that when I was then placed on a boat, a brusque voice from, I\nguess th-the guy in charge, said, kid, you puke on this boat, and I throw you\noverboard. So you better behave. And it was said with some kind of a \u2014 you know, a\ntinge of humor, so I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t \u2014 it didn\u2019t scare me, it was just, hey, I be \u2014\nokay, I better behave here.

And I went into the kitchen of\nthe apartment where we live, and there were \u2014 this is like four a.m. My parents were\nset \u2014 were seated, and my uncle and aunt were sitting right next to them. And what\nhad happened was that in 1940 \u2014 and during the October days, when everybody\ntried to get across to Sweden, they were captured, along with a group of \u2014 of \u2014 of\npeople. They were \u2014 they had been hiding in a small village near the coast, whereSeptember 18, 2015\nthey were hoping to get off to Sweden.

And they stayed there until April of \u00b045, when\nthey were rescued by, and taken to Sweden in those white buses that\n[indecipherable] had arranged. And so, at four a.m. I hear these voices, and I \u2014 I\nwalk in there. Th-Th-The \u2014 I knew them, but you know, at five before everything\nhappened, we had visited them, so \u2014 and I certainly recognized them.

        "A: \u2014 what \u2014 what we \u2014 to \u2014 to finish that story, what happened was that the war\nended, and May fifth, Denmark was freed, and \u2014 and open again. And very shortly\nthereafter, we returned from Sweden, to \u2014 to Denmark. And we found our\napartment pretty much exactly the way we had left it during those chaotic days,\nbecause a neighbor had taken care of it.\nSeptember 18, 2015",
        "A: Yes. It was a next door neighbor, and \u2014 but there were other people because I\nthink the next door neighbor had \u2014 there was a death in the family.

        "A: That did not take place until \u201963. What happened was, before that, in ni \u2014 in\n1960, I star \u2014 as a young, you know, 22 year old kid, I went to wor \u2014 I \u2014 I started\nworking f \u2014 at a movie company aa \u2014 as a\u2014 you know, a P.A, a production\nassistant. One day, arrived a crew of five people from CBS in New York. They\ncame to Denmark in order to do a documentary about the rescue of the Danish\nJews. And so I was attached \u2014 I\u2014 I spoke English, and I was attached to them as\ntheir sort of show \u2014 their \u2014 their guide. And what happened was, we went around\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 18, 2015\nand interviewed a number of the people who had been actively involved in the\nrescue operation. And a-at some point, we sat in the town of Elsinore, which is on\nthe coast, five miles across the water from Sweden, at the office of a bookbinder,\nwho \u2014 whose last name is Kerr(ph). And he spoke not a word of English, so I not\nonly had to, you know, translate, but also sort of try to interpret what he was saying.\nAnd that \u2014 it was fine, it went on for 20 minutes, and the CBS writer got all the\ninformation he wanted, until suddenly Mr. Kerr(ph) turned to me and said in\nDanish, listen, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m busy, I\u2019m a busy guy. Get these damn Americans\nout, I\u2019ve had enough of them. Which was a \u2014 which made it slightly tricky for me to\ntranslate, and I didn\u2019t quite know how to handle that. But I wa \u2014 I was sort of saved\nby the bell, because in walk \u2014 into his office walked another man and \u2014 and \u2014 who\nwas Clearly a \u2014 his, you know, assistant, or friend, whatever, because he was then\nintroduced to all of us. And when it came to me, and \u2014 and he heard my last name,\nhe said, wait a minute, I \u2014 I remember that. Then it turned out that wha \u2014 what\nunfolded was sort of a \u2014 a\u2014 wa-was as follows: it turned out that this man who\ncame in, whose last name was Larsen(ph), had been the assistant of Kerr(ph)\nduring the transportations, and what then ev \u2014 developed was that it was on\nKerr\u2019s(ph) boat that I had been taken across. And he was the one who said, if you\npuke, you go overboard. And so, all of this happened within two minutes. And h\u2014\nSeptember 18, 2015\nand of course, Kerr(ph) changed his attitude, and we stayed and had beer and\n[indecipherable] and \u2014 and lunch, and stayed for hours. And then the next day, that\nstory was then made part of the \u2014 of \u2014 of the documentary. And again, I was,\nbecause Kerr(ph) still didn\u2019t speak a word of English, I had to sort of tran \u2014\ntranslate everything he said. He then \u2014 his story, as part of \u2014 of \u2014 of the people\nrescuing, you know, their Danish neighbors, Danish Jewish neighbors, was that he\ncontinued sailing across, even into 1943 - \u201944, the spring, in spite of the fact that it\ngot increasingly difficult, because there were more and more patrols boats. And so\nit was only on nights without any moon that \u2014 that he could cross without being\nseen. And what did help his \u2014 his enterprise was that he went \u2014 he was sort of a\u2014a\nScarlet Pimpernel of \u2014 you know, he \u2014 he didn\u2019t pay much attention to his own\nsafety. He \u2014 he \u2014 he went from a very small boat, to a f\u2014 pa \u2014 bigger boat, and by\nthe time, in November of \u00b043, he had a \u2014 as, under the circumstance, a very fast\nboat. And so, he managed to do this until he was caught and almost killed in 1944,\nand he spent a year in \u2014 in a concentration camp. He also, obviously, survived,\nbecause we had this wonderful lunch and thing in \u2014 in \u2014 in [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, we did, and his style was \u2014 he said \u2014 and I translated verbatim, and it ended\nup in the film, he said, I didn\u2019t rescue the Jews, or anybody, because I liked them. I\ndid it because I hated the Germans. That was \u2014 I mean, that \u2014 that \u2014 that was what\nhe said. Obviously, there was more to it, but that was what came out of his mouth.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, I\u2014 I \u2014 that may have been part of \u2014 of the thing, but I think more to the point\nwas that the producer of the CBS documentary, you know, had a personal interest.\nHe thought this was a very important story to show his viewers, and it \u2014 it became \u2014\nit was part of what was then the Sunday morning \u2014 CBS had Sunday morning \u2014 this\nbefore cable and anything. And so the public affairs-type service that was given\nmostly by CBS \u2014 and NBC, and AB \u2014 ABC and NBC did not do the same thing. So\nthey had a whole department of \u2014 of people on fi \u2014 on 11\", and 57\" Street, in the\nproduction office. And \u2014 and they did whatever they thought was important. And\nSeptember 18, 2015\nso, they told this story because they wanted th-the American \u2014 the American\nviewers to see it. And it was broadcast twice, because it did make \u2014 it was the first\ntime a\u2014a TV program had done this. Books had been written that \u2014 before, and\nmany ca-came afterwards, dealing with the same subject, so \u2014",
        "A: A few, but bi \u2014 because I have a very large family; my father is one of seven, my\nmother one of four, it was mo \u2014 it was more [phone ringing] I\u2019m sorry about this \u2014\nit was more \u2014",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Well, then, because of the contact that I made with the people at \u2014 at CBS, which\nlasted after they went back to New York from Copenhagen, they worked on the\nprogram, and then I got a call, would I \u2014 would I like to come to New York,\nbecause I could help sort of put it together, and then I \u2014 I stayed. I \u2014 I went back a\ncouple times, but I ended up liking New York, I thought it was very exciting, and I\n\u2014 they gave me a job, sort of being a production manager for a number of programsSeptember 18, 2015\nthat came out of the same office. The \u2014 the public affairs Sunday morning\nprograms. There were two shows, \u201cLamp Unto My Feet,\u201d and \u2014 and \u201cLook up\nand Live.\u201d Those were the two programs. And this precedes you know, cable, and \u2014\nand there \u2014 everything else. So, th \u2014 I\u2014I got stuck here, and I met a young lady in\n1964, and got married three \u2014 two and a half months after we met, and that is now\n51 years ago.",
        "A: And now \u2014 then we mo-moved from L.A. \u2014 from New York to L.A. in 1990,\nbecause we made a movie there, and it was easier to \u2014 to sti \u2014 to then stay, yes.",
        "A: I have a very clear memory of spending something like an hour on a fast moving\nboat, because what also happened was in October \u2014 in November of 1943, pretty\nmuch all the Jews had been crossed \u2014 ha-had crossed to Sweden, and so those \u2014 th-\nthe transports then took care of \u2014 had people such as \u2014 on the boat it wa \u2014 it was a \u2014\nan RAF pilot who had parachuted over Denmark, and he had to get \u2014 be gotten out.\nThe Royal Air Force, you know, the British air force. And there were some other\npeople. So, later on, while I was still six or seven, and we talked about th-the \u2014 the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 18, 2015\ncrossing, I \u2014 I wi\u2014 my father said something, and I said, well, it was me and the\nother saboteurs that \u2014 that crossed th-the water. I \u2014 and because it was sort of a\u2014a\nvery \u2014 it was the first time I\u2019d bid \u2014 bid \u2014 been on a \u2014 on a boat of that type. It may\nhave been the first time I\u2019d e-e \u2014 been on a boat, ever. You know, as a five year \u2014\nand a half year old boy, I was very excited about how it worked, and \u2014 and since, at\nthat time, unlike before, during the really chaotic days in \u2014 in \u2014 in October, where s-\nsometimes young children were a\u2014 you know, given sleeping pills, or whatever, to\nmake sure that they would not make noise, this was different. And I guess th-the \u2014\nMr. Kerr(ph) took a chance. I guess he talked to me, and the way I responded made\nhim believe that it was not necessary to \u2014 to, you know, give me an injection to \u2014\nfor \u2014 for me to keep quiet. So, by the time we arrived in \u2014 near Helsingborg in\nSweden, which is across from the shortest distance from Denmark, I\u2019ve \u2014 as we\nmoved into the harbor, along the \u2014 the side, I \u2014 I saw my father from the boat, and\nhe was there with \u2014 I think with a policeman, nervously pacing back and forth. So\nthat\u2019s what I do remember.",
        "A: Well, th-the mi \u2014 the image I remember is, as we moved into \u2014 towards, you\nknow, like maybe 25 yards before the boat actually moored. And then what\nSeptember 18, 2015\nhappened, I don\u2019t remember, but obviously what \u2014 what did happen was that we\ntook a train, my father and I, to Stockholm, where we reunited with my mother.",
        "A: Yeah. And one reason why, during the interview where I discover \u2014 where\neverybody discovered that the boat had \u2014 actually had me on board, what actually\nhappened was that the man who walked in with a severe limp, because he\u2019d been\ninjured during the war, where his fellow \u2014 Mr. Kerr(ph) was almost killed, when he\nwas introduced to me, and remember the last name, which 1s somewhat unusual,\nthere \u2014 the \u2014 the reason why he remembered that was that my father had, as a gift,\nmade \u2014 given him a silver cigarette \u2014 he was a smoker \u2014 and had engraved in it, a\nthank you note from him, last name being Korzen. So, the name had sort of se \u2014\nwas a name that this guy \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 remembered very clearly.",
        "A: Well, the \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 18, 2015",
        "A: What happened then, where basically people put themselves at \u2014 at risk, and \u2014\nand many died, is an example that sort of stands as a, you know, role model for\nhuman behavior. Now, what we\u2019re witnessing these days, having to do with\nrefugees, and \u2014 and immigration, and people trying to escape alive from either war,\nor related horrible \u2014 horrible to human situation, 1-1-1s \u2014 is the opposite. And it\nwould be very nice if this example, which is not really that known, could be, let\u2019s\nsay, elevated a-as the role model to \u2014 for everybody to \u2014 to \u2014 to imitate. How that 1s\nto be done, remains to be seen. Obviously, it \u2014 it would take \u2014 1t would take a \u2014 an\nattitude that is the total opposite of what\u2019s happening right now. This is 19 \u2014 this is\n2015, where, as we witness the debate about who we are, and what we should do,\nand what we should allow, the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 as I see it, the idiocy of doing the\nopposite of what this country 1s all based on. This country is based on having people\ncome here, and then start a life that ends up making a country as good as it can be,\nbecause of the people. So there \u2014 so therefore the \u2014 whenever the opposite is being\nadvocated, that to me sounds like it\u2019s based on idiocy, it\u2019s based on ignorance, and\nanything we can do to counteract that, w-we \u2014 we all have, I think, a responsibility\nto do.\nSeptember 18, 2015",
        "A: The answer is no. The previous germ \u2014 our gran \u2014 my grandparents, were\nsomewhat religious. They did not \u2014 they did celebrate the \u2014 the \u2014 the high holidays.\nI was Bar Mitzvahed when \u2014 13, as the \u2014 as the last of my sibling, and so we were,\nand still are, what you would call secular Jews. When our son turned 13, and we\nlived in New York at that time, we did not \u2014 what we did was, we sent him to be\ntutored by a Yiddish poet, who tutored kids, and dealt with everything Jewish,\nexcept for religion: history, music, culture, etcetera. And so, he got his \u2014 his\nupbringing in the same secular tradition. When my wife and I got \u2014 when I got\nmarried, which was in 1964, we went down to city hall in \u2014 in \u2014 in New York, but\nwe really didn\u2019t like the AstroTurf floor, and \u2014 and couldn\u2019t see ourselves, sort of,\ndoing the \u2014 the ceremony there. So we ended up, we lived on the Upper West Side\nof Manhattan, and we ended up finding a rabbi in a synagogue, who was willing to\nmarry us with the understanding that we were secular Jews. And so he \u2014 he\npromised to stay away from subject that had to do with \u2014 that would not really\nconnect with being a secular Jew. And 1\u2014 and the only thing he \u2014 a-and \u2014 and he\nsaid, so let\u2019s do it in my chambers, you know, not in the \u2014 in the big space, where\nSeptember 18, 2015\nactually, I think the synagogue seats about 3,000 people. So, we came there with\neight friends, and he changed his mind, he said no, let\u2019s go into the big space, even\nthough we are only 12 people. And so, you know, be-be-because he wanted to\ndemonstrate that he could deliver a \u2014 a sermon for people like us, and \u2014 and he \u2014\nand I \u2014 I\u2019ve \u2014 he did. So, he managed to stay away from, you know, the word God.\nAnd yet, he \u2014 he did not violate his own, let\u2019s say background and principles of\nbeing a rabbi. He \u2014 he knew how to do \u2014 to \u2014 to have that \u2014 that balance. So my \u2014\nthe fact that I was \u2014 went through a Bar Mitzvah, I \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m happy and proud\nof it, even though the truth is that very shortly thereafter, I lost the ability to s \u2014 to\nspeak whatever Hebrew I had learned. Which 1s what you need to understand, and \u2014\nan-and you know, it\u2019s like, it just ended up in \u2014 1n \u2014 in retrospect it\u2019s \u2014 it was a nice\nexperience, it was a nice thing that happened.",
        "A: But it has not influenced our lives, going forward.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 18, 2015",
        "A: It\u2019s a very diverse \u2014 yes. One thing that happened very early on, after I settle in\nNew York was my wife and I, we met a\u2014 a young girl our age, and for reasons that\nneither of us understood, we sort of \u2014 we became fast friends, and still are. This is\nnow 50 years later. She happened to be \u2014 she\u2019s my age, and she was a \u2014 she 1s a\nsurvivor, but under much more dramatic osten \u2014 circumstances, in that she was\nsaved by her grandmother, who was with her. And this was \u2014 she \u2014 she was born in\nBerlin, and under circumstances that cannot be described any other than\nmiraculous, survived, and ended up in sw \u2014 in Sweden, in Stockholm. And by the\ntime we met her in 1964 in New York, she had, like I, sort of gravitated from\nwherever, but \u2014 and had no longer \u2014 the fact that she was a German Jewish girl, had\ntotally changed into, she was now a New Yorker. But \u2014 but her story, and her\nattitude, and her whole demeanor, clearly was something that, you know, it made an\nimpression, and you know, th-the bond that \u2014 it\u2019s not that my story has much to do\nwith hers, because mine is a happy end, and hers is a bittersweet, with a happy end.\nSo, it is a very big difference.",

        "A: No, growing up in Denmark, as \u2014 in Copenhagen as I did, the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the\n\u2014 the life that began after I came back in 1945, had \u2014 there was n-no anti-Semitism,\nor any other, let\u2019s say negative aspect of \u2014 of life. Denmark was then a society that\nhad very few prejudices. The Danish \u2014 the Jewish community in Copenhagen, that\nhad been there for a few hundred years, because in 16-something, the king of\nDenmark had invited a \u2014 a bunch of Jews from Germany or wherever, in sort of\nmiddle Europe, to settle, because he was an \u2014 an enterprising builder-type king, and\nhe\u2019d heard that having Jews around would be helpful. And so, from that moment\non, the Jewish community grew, and by the time we get to World War II, there\nwere, in Danish culture, a huge impact of the Jewish artists and playwrights, and so\non. One play that is always part of the repertory of the Royal Theater in\nCopenhagen, is written by a Jew, and \u2014 and deals with a Jewish holiday, and the\nreason for that. So, the au \u2014 so th-the \u2014 when I \u2014 un-until I left in 1964 and settled in\nNew York, the \u2014 th-the \u2014 being Jewish in Denmark was almost something that\npeople would boast of, or having a Jewish grandmother, etcetera. Things have\nchanged because there have been at \u2014 b-both because of politics, and so on, a-and\nSeptember 18, 2015\nbecause of Europe now is \u2014 1s a different continent than it was then. So th-th-the\nwonderful \u2014 let\u2019s say the \u2014 the days of peace and prosperity and cultural exuberance\nthat I re-relate to, when I was very young, that has changed, unfortunately, in the\nnegative direction.",
        "A: Yes, we go \u2014 we go quite often, at least once every two years. My very large\nfamily loves coming here. And so, we s \u2014 th-they come here more often than we go\nthere. But, you know, we are \u2014 you know, with everything, such as Skype and so\non, we \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 we Stay in very close contact.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Well, you\u2019re welcome, as a \u2014 but Leslie, you know, if \u2014 if you \u2014 if you discover\nthat you need something more, I can phone it in, as we say.",
        "A: Ah, okay.",
        "A: We do \u2014 we do a lot of things like this on iPhones.\nSeptember 18, 2015",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Sure, no, no, I \u2014I appreciate that.",
        "A: Look, I think what you\u2019re doing is \u2014 is wonderful, and it \u2014 it\u2019s a\u20141t\u2019s a\u2014 for\nmany generations, 1-1-1t\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a documentation that probably has more meaning\nthan people reading books, and \u2014 and \u2014 and all of that.",
