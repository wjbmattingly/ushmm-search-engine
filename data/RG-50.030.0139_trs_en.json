        "Q: Bill, tell me your name and your place of birth and your date of birth?",
        "A: My name is William J. Lowenberg, Bill Lowenberg. I was born on August the 14th 1926 in\na small town in Westphalia by the name of Ochtrup. It's not far from the Dutch border.",
        "Q: Can you tell me just a little bit about your family, how many sisters or brothers that you\nhave?",
        "A: Yes. My parents were born in the same vicinity within a few miles from where I was born\nand so were my grandparents on both sides. And several generations, I don't know three or\nfour or five, maybe longer. I had one sister who was three years younger than I am. And my\nfather's parents lived in the same house with us on the second, two story house. And my\nfather had two sisters and a brother. One sister died 1n the early '30s of natural causes. And\nhis brother, my father's brother, and my father, they all were in the First World War as\nGerman soldiers. They were German citizens. And my father's brother died shortly after the\nFirst World War, he was gassed in France, during when they used gas in France, so he died\nof complications. And he died in 1920 or '21. I don't know exactly when those years, right\nafter the war. And my mother was born in a town next to us, about eight kilometers to the\nwest. And she had three brothers and a sister. They were some early children - born in... who\ndied in infancy. And my grandfather on my mother's side, he died two years before I was\nborn. My grandmother lived in that town next to Ochtrup - where I was born with her two\nsons. And one son lived and was married in another city, not very far from there. And we left\nGermany in the end of '36 about. We went over the border to Holland --",
        "Q: Let's not go there yet.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Let's get back a little bit. You were very young when the Nazis took over in 1933?",
        "A: Yah, I was six years old.",
        "Q: Yes, do you remember any particular change 1n your life in terms of friends and school?",
        "A: Indeed. I lived on a street, I remember vividly there, were four boys who were all the same\nage and all in the same grade. At the time I lived near a boy's school and a girl's school. It\nwas a Catholic community. Shortly after '32, about '33 or '34, they were not allowed to play\nwith me any longer. I remember that. I also was in, I think about the second or third grade, I\nwas not allowed to sit in the class with the rest of the students, I had to sit in the back. The\nteacher I had, the one I remember the best, he was very nice to me. But the principal was a\nNazi, because he insisted that I was sitting, that I would sit in the back. I only had about one\nor two report cards and then I was told I would not get any more report cards. I remember\nthat. And the other incident I remember quite well 1s, um, we had, we lived in a small town\nwhere there are only ten Jewish families. There was no professional teacher, and my mother\nused to teach me Hebrew, I'm talking about Hebrew. And so as much as my mother could\ntaught me the primers and the prayers and the alphabets, etcetera. It was necessary that we\nwent to the next town over, which was a provincial town, where they had a professional\nteacher and a school, and most of the Jewish children in that province area in the county\ncame to this town on various days of the week. I remember we used to go there one day a\nweek, and first myself and then my sister and cousins of ours. Another girl and my sister, and\nthree of us used to go by train once a week, I think it was on Tuesday, it was the early part of\nthe week. And we had to go by train which was probably about an hour and then you had to\nwalk for a bit to go to that school which was next to the synagogue in that town. The town's\nname was Burgsteinfurt. And I remember one incident in particular because there are always\nbullies on the street. For some reason they knew that we were Jews. And one day I was\nattacked by a boy maybe in his early teens, 15, 14 or 15. And he threw a knife at me and cut\nmy legs. I remember coming to school where they had bring in a nurse and they bandaid me.\nAnd then shortly thereafter I couldn't we couldn't go to that school anymore.",
        "Q: Were you alone when that happened?",
        "A: No, my sister and our friends, my sister's friend, our cousins were with me then. And I\nremember that and that's about all I remember as far as anti-Semitic attack on me physically.\nI was beaten up later on in the middle '30s in school by boys in the class. And then I couldn't\ngo. I went once in the years -- they took me in the early days to the city swimming pool and\nthen I was told that I could march with the class to the pool, but I couldn't be in the pool\nbecause I was a Jew. I happened to be the only Jew in the whole class, the whole school of\n800 children. But I remember distinctly that it bothered me a great deal that I could not be\npart of my friends to go into the pool once every few weeks or once a week when the class\nwent to the swimming outing, in the summer of course, it was an outside pool. But I wasn't\nallowed to go in there.",
        "Q: And when they said you couldn't have a report card anymore, did that mean you didn't do\nany work?",
        "A: Yes, I worked. I was a good student. I remember that. But the principal had decided that as a\nJew I was not entitled to a report card. So I sat in the back of the class until '36 when my\nparents saw that it was impossible for us to live there. And we had relatives in Holland and\nwe left then.",
        "Q: Do you remember discussions in your family about leaving, was it a surprise to you when\nyou left?",
        "A: I don't remember the discussions. I remember thinking about it in depth that my father and\nmother thought that Holland would be safe for us because during the First World War\nHolland was kept neutral just like Switzerland was kept neutral even in the Second World\nWar. Because the Germans needed Holland in the First War, that's where the Kaiser ended\nup. And I think my father believed that the same thing would happen again because they\nneeded an outlet where they could escape to maybe. That wasn't the case because on May the\n10th 1940 of course the Germans invaded Holland, and they were there early in the morning.\nWe were right on the border there.",
        "Q: How did you find out that you were going to Holland, who told you?",
        "A: I don't remember. I don't remember that. I know that we went late at night by car. We went\nover the border.",
        "Q: And who went?",
        "A: My father, my mother, my sister, myself, and I think my grandfather. I'm not too sure. My\ngrandmother had died, my father's mother had died in 1936. I remember because I was on\nvacation and I had to come back. I was with relatives in another city. And I don't remember\nif my grandfather came immediately with us or shortly thereafter. I think he didn't come until\nKristallnacht, which is another story here. And he lived with us. My aunt, my father's sister,\nwent to Belgium to live with her first cousins, my father's first cousins in Belgium.",
        "Q: Did you take a lot of things with you?",
        "A: No. Bare essentials. I don't remember if we even took furniture.",
        "Q: How about a toy? You were six or seven years old. No, you were ten.",
        "A: I was ten years old. I don't remember toys. Toys weren't as prevalent then as today.",
        "Q: Where did you go when you went to Holland?",
        "A: We went to a small town in the eastern part of Holland called Borculo. It had about 40\nJewish families, 40, 42 Jewish families, a very religious town, conservative. And it was a\nwonderful life for me there. It was the first time in my life that I was accepted among my\npeers. It was probably the best part of my life that I have ever had was from 1936, end of '36,\nuntil '40 because uh I wasn't a Jew any longer, meaning I was just one of the boys, one of the\nkids which I never knew before. And there were children my age, Jewish and non-Jewish. It\nso happened that one boy was my age and became my best friend. He was killed during the\nwar with the entire family. But we had a wonderful life there. It was very difficult for my\nfather and mother because they came with nothing. They had left everything behind. We had\na house in Germany. We are not people of means. My father had a hard life and he worked\nhard and there wasn't an abundance of money. To the contrary it was a struggle. And not on\nmy mother's side, they were affluent. But we never felt poor of course, we had a good life in\nthe family especially. But in Holland it was hard for him to begin because we had to start\nfrom point zero and it worked out quite well.",
        "Q: What did he do in Germany and what did he have to do in Holland?",
        "A: In Germany my father was in business with his father, in the cattle business. Most of the\nJews in that area were in cattle. Most the majority were in the cattle business. My father\nlearned the textile business when he was a young man. And when he came to Holland it\nwasn't possible to go in the cattle business, that would take lots of sums of money to pay and\ntrade, so he went back in textile, which he knew. And first he worked very hard with a\nbicycle and suitcases and went from one farmer to the next for about three years. And my\nmother did the sewing. He sold dresses and aprons and whatever, and he came home with\nthe measurements and my mother worked at night and during the days. She also had a\nvegetable garden and no help. But it was a good life. And then my father was able to buy a\nsmall store on the main street on this town. Somebody retired or died, something, a Jewish\nfamily, and the son I remember sold it to my father. I don't know the arrangements. And we\nlived behind the store which was a much better life for my father, he didn't have to go by\nbicycle every day. And then it developed that my father run the store. He went one day a\nweek sometimes 2 days a week, to travel. And my mother did take a very active part in the\nbusiness and did the sewing and helping in the store.",
        "Q: Did you work there too?",
        "A: I had to work after school hours. I had to deliver merchandise to the people that bought. I\nwas the delivery boy. It was nice. And then my grandfather came. He was living with us\nthen. And then in 1938, Kristallnacht, my grandmother came to live with us, my mother's\nmother.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Her name was Erica Soloman. My mother's maiden name was Soloman. She survived the\nwar. She went to Theresienstadt. I'm sure you'll ask me about that later, but she survived the\nwar. And my uncles, her two sons, my two uncles were arrested in Germany by the local\npolice in a small town, a very small town there. They were the only Jewish family there.\nThey were born there. And they were in jail, but during the night a few neighbors took them\nout of jail and held up the policeman who was their friend actually, and they took 'em by\nbicycles over the border, and took 'em over the border to get 'em from not being taken to one\nof the concentration camps, wherever they were taking them in those days, probably Dachau\nor Buchenwald. And they were immediately put under house arrest in Holland by the Dutch\ngovernment. And they lived with another cousin of ours. My mother uh, my grandmother\nrather, I think and her two sisters married in Holland and had their children. And then the\nDutch put 'em in a camp in southern Holland, and then from there they were building\nWesterbork which later became the transit camp. They were in Westerbork from about '38,\n'39 on. They stayed there during the war and they were liberated by the British or the\nCanadians, I forget now.",
        "Q: Bill, between '36 when you arrived in Holland and 1940 do you feel that this was -- when\nyou started to say this was the best time of your life up until then, it was a much more normal\nlife for you?",
        "A: Well, Holland is a very good country. It was a very good country even more so then than\nnow. Things have changed in Holland too. But the Dutch were just wonderful to us. And I\nfelt it very strongly because I came from a very severe system of antisemitism and total\nseparation from my surrounding area, my surrounding community where I was born and\nwhere I grew up as a small boy. When I came to Holland I was accepted like an equal. I\nalways remember that. The children in my class, the neighbors, that's like it should have\nbeen anyhow. But... So it was most revealing for me.",
        "Q: Then what happened in 1940 when the Germans came in, did it change radically?",
        "A: No, it didn't change radically. It took about a year in general. Yah, there were, laws were\nmade of course and we had to turn in our bicycles and there was a curfew at night for the\nJews from 7:00 o'clock on. So not immediately, but very soon. Then of course we also\ncouldn't go to school any longer, to public schools after about maybe eight, nine months to a\nyear. So we went by bus to the next town over which was a large community and they had\nbuilt a Jewish school. They took one of the schools that the city I think gave them and they\nmade it into a Jewish day school. And we went by bus every morning.",
        "Q: Were you frightened?",
        "A: Oh, sure. Because on the buses we had to wear a star. And when the Germans came on the\nbuses, were public transportation systems, the rails were not running any longer. law. They\nhad a bus system between all the different towns. And when Germans came in we had to get\nup and go in the back of the bus. And if there were too many Germans they threw the Jewish\nkids out of the bus, anyone with a star, they threw us out and we had to wait for the next\nbus. That happened once every other week maybe, sometimes more often. And then when\nwe walked -- for instance when we got to the town where we went to school I remember it\nwas quite a way, it was maybe 45 minutes to an hour walk, there were no buses. And our\nclassmates used to come by who lived there and picked us up on their bikes, and they picked\nus up and took us to the school. And then they had to turn 1n their bicycles, it was the end of\nthat transportation system. But it was good for me because we could continue our education,\nand they were good teachers, and that was the end of my education at that point. I had by\nthen maybe six, seven years of elementary education from the first grade to the sixth or\nseventh grade, I don't remember the details. It's a little different in Holland than it is here.\nThen at one point Jews could not be in the buses at all any longer. So my father thought, and\nbecause he was told that we couldn't sit at home either that we had to keep busy, and my\nfather called some acquaintances of his and I worked on a farm. I had to go every morning at\n6:00, go to a farm. I worked there in the fields as a child. My father had the store still, but\nthey were told that if you don't work you will be arrested earlier. So my father arranged that I\nwent to work on a farm.",
        "Q: What did you do?",
        "A: Anything you do on farms from milking cows to harvesting the wheat and feeding the\nanimals.",
        "Q: Were there other children like you?",
        "A: No, not on this farm. This was -- other children had to do it on other farms, yes. This age\ngroup. And even old people. This was mainly because information filters down and they said\nif you work they don't arrest you. They did anyhow.",
        "Q: Did this apply to your sister?",
        "A: No. My sister, no. She was a little too young.",
        "Q: Do you remember how you got your star?",
        "A: No. An edict came down and you had to buy them. I remember that you had to buy them. I\nremember that my father had to sell them because he had a textile store. They had a J-O-O-\nD. Jood. That's a Dutch name for \"Jew\" But you could not pin them on. I remember them\nsaying that you could not pin them on with a safety pin, you had to physically sew it on to\nyour outer garment. That was very very important, I remember that.",
        "Q: Did your mother make these?",
        "A: No, no, no. they were printed by the Germans or by edict of the Germans. No, no, you had to\nbuy them from some whatever institution. And you had to sew them on of course, you had to\ndo yourself. My mother did it. Most likely my mother. Excuse me.",
        "Q: Were you angry that you had to wear these?",
        "A: Oh, I don't know. I'm sure there was an anger. It was an embarrassment, it was degrading.\nBut there were so many things happening, one was heaped on top of the other. It was a\nsystematic, well thought out, and very orchestrated move to degrade, to belittle, to destroy\nthe minds of the people to make them powerless. It's not that -- it would have been simpler if\nthey pick us up and take us to the camps, but there was a whole prelude of acts from turning\nin your radios to turning in your cars and your bicycles. We didn't have a car, we had\nbicycles. Of turning in anything valuable, even turning in furniture. But one could not have a\nradio I remember distinctly. And I know the bicycles because I remember I had a bicycle for\na short time during that farm episode and then I know I had to turn the bicycle in, so I had to\nwalk every morning to that farm which was about an hour's walk. And you did it. I mean\nvery disciplined for various reasons. But, yah, 1t wasn't an anger that I remember a deep\nanger at this point in my life, I don't remember that. But I do remember \"why\"? It just was to\ntake away, step by step, your whole humanity. There was a system of dehumanizing\neverything we knew of from sitting in the back of the bus, wearing the star, a neighbor is not\nallowed to talk to you and wouldn't for fear of being put in the camps or being ostracized.\nEven in Germany as a child the children could not play with me. And I remember one\nepisode, I was standing in front of my house and I wanted to play so badly with the boys I\nused to play with, and they just said, \"you can't.\" And I used to cry a lot, I remember that.\nWhile I'm talking things come back to me. I used to cry. I felt 1t even harder on my mother\nand my father. See, a child has so much capacity and a lot of things a child doesn't\nunderstand, and in retrospect and I've thought about it in recent years a lot, is the anguish my\nparents must have gone through to see number one, their own life destroyed. They had\nfought for the same country that was doing it to them. My father was very popular, and my\nmother, in the local community, the bowling clubs and the veterans organizations. And then\nwhen their children their own life and their children, to me it must have been a horrible,\nhorrible part of life for my mother to see what happened to her children. I mean there was no\nfuture. And where do you go if 1t goes downhill orchestrated by a government, not only by\nindividuals. But they didn't give up easy, I must tell you. There's a thing I remember quite\nvividly. My father was very nationalistic. He loved what he did because he was a veteran, he\nwas wounded, he had medals from the First World War. And on Veterans Day, what we call\nhere Veterans Day, they had parades in those days just like we have here. And the veterans\nhad their rifles and they put their rifles over their shoulder and they march down the main\nstreet, and I remember that my mother was laughing. And my father he still left to go to that\nparade and march in the parade, but he couldn't have a rifle, and he was a Jew. So he took a\ncane and he wasn't the only one, others did too, and they took a cane and turned the can\nupside down and put a flower on the top of the cane and they marched with their Christian\nfriends, previous friends, they marched in the same parade and you could pick the Jews out\nbecause they carried a cane as a substitute for a rifle. In those days we didn't think much\nabout it because that's the way it was. You made the best of everything. But when I think\nabout it today it does make me angry obviously. So there were many instances like that, but\nUS...",
        "Q: What happened between you and your friends, did they all stop talking to you?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: All of them?",
        "A: All of them. There was no one who dared. It would reflect even in the school. It was an\norchestrated way of ostracizing the Jews. And they didn't monkey around by saying well\nmaybe I should or shouldn't. They just didn't talk. Actually, that's why my parents left. We\nleft early because we thought we could save ourselves. Now, my grandmother had arranged\nto take the whole family out of Germany to go to Chile. And she bought visas for us, for\nherself and her two sons. Her daughter was married with two small children, my aunt, my\nmother's sister. And shortly before this was all going to happen, when we would leave, we\nfound out that they were phonies. Someone had taken a great deal of money from my\ngrandmother. She was a matronly person. She was very very bright. She had been a widow\nsince she was in her early 50s. And these were phony, false, false visas. So there was an\nattempt made to get out obviously. But then we also lived in small towns. There was no\ncommunication like we have today. And just to give you an example how small, my\ngrandmother's phone number was number 2. Number | was the city hall. She had the second\nphone in the town. So you can imagine the system of communication in those days. No one\nknew what was going on except what filtered down through the government's edicts and\nattacks.",
        "Q: You said you wanted to talk about Kristallnacht and bringing your grandmother to Holland?",
        "A: Well, they came over the border that night and we knew it pretty fast because my\ngrandmother came over the border for some reason. I don't even remember how she got\nthere, I really don't. I remember my uncles come across, but we never saw them because they\ncouldn't stay with us. We were not Dutch citizens, we were there on permits as aliens. And\nthey let us stay there because my father did have a permit to move there in '36. -- but we\nnever became, the Dutch didn't make you citizens. They didn't make any of the German Jews\ncitizens. So I was made stateless when Germany declared the Jew status in the Nuremberg\nLaws. I don't remember what year that was, but I assume it was before we left Germany. I\nthink it was in '35 maybe. So we lived as normal citizens. We didn't have to report or\nanything like that. Maybe they kept an eye on us, I don't know. But my uncles who came\nover during Kristallnacht could not stay with us because we didn't have the permission from\nthe Dutch government to harbor even relatives, my mother's brothers. So they stayed with\ncousins who were Dutch citizens. They could not walk the streets. They were under house\narrest and then they put them in a camp. So my uncles in essence were in camps locked up\nfrom 1938 to '45. They never saw outside life for those years.",
        "Q: Did your father lose his store before you went to Westerbork?",
        "A: At first no, no. The store was open, the store was open until we were arrested to go to\nWesterbork. But he had a very difficult time getting merchandise because a lot of us was on\ncoupons already and the quarters were very little specifically because when the quarters were\nestablished he had very little business, so they were based on previous businesses. But no, I\nremember that the store had some merchandise on the shelf when we walked out to the local\nschool, the auditorium of the school where they assembled all the Jews that night. And we\nwere picked up by the Dutch police. They were not Germans. The Dutch police picked up us\nbecause they were told to pick up the Jews.",
        "Q: Were you hungry, did you have adequate food?",
        "A: In those days?",
        "Q: After '40?",
        "A: Yah. Food was not a big problem. We lived in a small town, farm towns, it wasn't that\nserious in those days. It became serious later I am told for all the Dutch people. But we didn't\nhave that much of a problem with food until we were arrested.",
        "Q: And you had Jewish friends?",
        "A: I had both Jewish and non Jewish friends.",
        "Q: Yes. But when you stopped being able to talk or be with your Christian friends?",
        "A: Well, in Holland this wasn't so.",
        "Q: It wasn't so?",
        "A: No. It was only in Germany. In Holland, no the Dutch people didn't follow that.",
        "Q: Did you talk about what was going on after the Germans came with your friends?",
        "A: Yes, indeed. And everybody felt sorry for you, but there was nothing you could do. They\nwere hard on the Dutch people too and the Christians. As long as they behaved and didn't do\nanything political they left them alone. There was rationing. There was no gasoline, etcetera.\nYou couldn't buy bicycles or tires for the bicycles. But in the cities it was very severe,\nespecially later part of the Occupation. But no, 1t wasn't that bad. We never had a shortage of\nfood. We may not have had everything, but there was no shortage of food for us until we\nwent to Westerbork. Just shortage of freedom. Excuse me.",
        "Q: What about your sister. Were you close as she got a little bit older during those years in\nHolland?",
        "A: Yah, we became very close in the last years when we got older. She was two years younger.\nShe had reddish hair and her name was Erika. She died in Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Can you talk about her a little bit?",
        "A: I don't know, I don't know. We had a very normal family life. And she had lots of friends like\nwe all had.",
        "Q: Did you play together?",
        "A: Yah.",
        "Q: What did you play?",
        "A: Oh, I don't know. I don't remember. What do children do? We did what everybody else did.",
        "Q: So you didn't mind having a little girl sister?",
        "A: No, no. First of all you don't have the choice, and second of all she was my sister. And she\nwas very bright. She was a good student, I remember. She went to a girls school and there\nwere two schools, boys and girls. They were separated. And she had lots of friends, I\nremember that. And I was 14 when I saw her last, 15.",
        "Q: Did you know anyone who went into hiding or did you think about going into hiding?",
        "A: Oh, I knew quite a few people in hiding. I mean not a lot, but several families went into\nhiding. See, we were relatively newcomers 1n the town because we had only gotten there.\nYou know, we weren't born there, my father wasn't born there, etcetera. So we knew... my\nfather knew people, I knew that, but he wasn't -- I don't know, there weren't these\nconnections like if you were born and raised with the same people. And then I think the other\nissue was finances. I mean the people were hiding people. Most people had to, most people,\nif not all, but most people had to pay, there had to be some resources. My father didn't have\nresources, but that doesn't mean that some people may have been hidden and saved who\ndidn't have resources, it may be so, but I know the ones that went into hiding had some\nresources which we didn't have. And then the other issue was that it was well known that if\nyou were caught, the Jew, you would be shot on sight or something very different, terrible\nwould happen. Furthermore, the Christians who were hiding the Jews were treated as Jews if\nthey were caught. They were taken to the camps or shot too. It was a heroic, heroic gesture,\nanyone who hid Jews. There was some abuses, but I don't think that's major at all. But the\nones who hid Jews are very heroic people. And I knew some after the war, but we didn't\nhave the connection in my opinion. And frankly no one expected that this was a matter of\neither life or death. All we knew is we were going to camps for the duration of the war\nperiod. And we believed it. Everybody believed it. Well, some maybe didn't, but as far as we\nknow we believed that this was just this period of time to be in camps. Where? We didn't\nknow. Later on when we got to Westerbork we knew we were going to eastern Europe. We\nknow some of them were going to eastern Europe, but letters came from eastern Europe,\nsome of them. We knew that Mauthausen was where the first Jews picked up in our\ncommunity, were taken to Mauthausen and then we were told they died there from hard\nlabor. Our rabbi, they picked off the leadership first and the younger people. But that hiding\nbusiness, it's hard to explain because we lived in an atmosphere of terrible, terrible fear, so\nfor all I know maybe my father tried and it didn't work.",
        "Q: When were you -- not when, but tell the circumstances of your arrest with your family?",
        "A: Well, you were notified.",
        "Q: How?",
        "A: By the local police. And you were given a list of what you could take.",
        "Q: A piece of paper came?",
        "A: A piece of paper came. I don't know how it got there, but we got a piece of paper from the\npolice I think that said you can only take this, this, and this, one suit or two suits, and two\nsets of underwear, and a toothbrush, and a pair of shoes, and etcetera. So orchestrated and\nwithout -- and the Dutch are very organized, very respectful citizens and we followed, we all\nfollowed. And we were told two days or three days before that we would have to be ready\nsuch and such an evening or afternoon, and we were taken. The local police came by, there\nwere only one or two policemen in the whole town, and they came by and took us to the\nschool auditortum. We stayed there for, I don't know how many hours, I don't remember the\ndetail, but I know we went in this auditorium where I used to play as a child, as a student\nrather. And then we were taken by bus to the closest railroad station.",
        "Q: Could you go back a little bit. How did you get from your house to the school?",
        "A: I think we walked over there.",
        "Q: With all the Jews of the --",
        "A: Yes, they all came there. And before the evening was over they were all there, whoever were\narrested, several hundred. There were 42 Jewish families in this down. Some of them had\nalready done in hiding, and a few were picked up earlier, and some got out. Some of the\nmore affluent ones, families, got out before 1940. They went to England.",
        "Q: Did you have food with you, did you take food?",
        "A: You took -- yes, we took food with us.",
        "Q: And how long were you in the auditortum?",
        "A: Just for maybe five, six, seven hours, maybe not even that long, I don't remember. We went\ndirect from there to Westerbork by train to the next town where the next railroad station was,\nand there they put us on a train with a police escort of course. And we had these big\nknapsacks, you know, what do you call them, the thing you put on your back, packs, and\nthat's all you could carry. You couldn't carry a suitcase with you, it was just all in this one\nbig backpack, it's called.",
        "Q: What did it look like when you arrived there?",
        "A: In Westerbork, well you got off the train and they marched you to a barrack, an there was a\nprocessing center and registration, etcetera. But you kept whatever you had with you, it\nwasn't taken away from you.",
        "Q: What was the registration like?",
        "A: I don't remember that. I don't remember that at all. But we worked there, we spent quite a\nwhile in Westerbork. I worked there in the metal shops.",
        "Q: Doing what?",
        "A: Anything to do with metal shops, repairing things, because I had gone to technical school in\n1938 or '39, I went to a technical school. It's like where you learn a trade. So I went back into\nthe metal shops. And my sister became a runner for the offices there in the camp. And my\nfather worked in -- it was a farm, the camp had a farm. That farm was there. They had cows,\nwhere my uncles since they were cattle dealers, book care of the cows so that the\ncommandant would have milk and fresh eggs, fresh chickens, and that's what they did. They\nhad that farm there for the benefit of the guards and the commandant.",
        "Q: Did your mother also work?",
        "A: My mother had to go to a place where they were doing some sewing 1n the hospital. There\nwas a hospital in the camp in Westerbork, and she worked there sewing. And my father\nworked most of the time in the kitchen, camp kitchen, because everyone had to go and pick\nup their food.",
        "Q: You said your sister was a runner?",
        "A: She was -- well, a messenger. They used messengers to take papers or whatever. Yes, that's\nwhat she did. I remember that.",
        "Q: What was the physical situation in the barrack, were you with your family or were you all in\ndifferent barracks?",
        "A: No, we all went together. Always we were together. But they also had a barracks for young\npeople. It was civilized in comparison with what I saw later. And then they also had cubicles,\none room, two rooms, where families could live if you were staying there like we were\nstaying there. But most people came in there and stayed maybe one or two days and then\nevery Tuesday the trains went from Westerbork to Auschwitz or Sobibor. But there was a\ncaddie\u2019, my father and mother were assigned to a caddie because he worked in the kitchen so\nwe were, what they may call at that point, permanent residents, or whatever the name, it was\na different name, but at least we didn't worry in the early days of going with them on the\ntransport.",
        "Q: Did you have a card of some kind?",
        "A: Yes, I think so. There may have been a card, yes. But then we worked and you picked up\nyour food and at least we had dinner together every night. Then I went separate. When I\nbecame -- I was under protection of my parents age-wise until I was 15, I remember. But\nwhen my 15th birthday was past, when I was at the end of my 15th year I was on my own,\nso-called. And then I was shipped to Auschwitz alone without my parents and my sister.",
        "Q: When you were there, you were there for almost a full year?",
        "A: About eight, nine months.",
        "Q: Eight, nine months. Did you think you were going to be deported?",
        "A: Oh, we all knew that it was eventually to happen. But I'm thinking by then of escape. You\ncould escape from there because the military or the guards were not as severe there as we\nsaw later. And I worked for a while in cutting peat, you know, peat, we cut peat and dry it. I\nworked with some teams there. We cut peat in the area. There, where Westerbork is, is\nknown for peat moss, peat for the stoves for heating. So I worked there and we are out in the\nfield. If one wanted to escape and you know what you were doing, you had to be disciplined\nI think.",
        "Q: Do you remember thinking about it, or thinking \"No, I can't do it.\"?",
        "A: No, not then. Because first of all I wouldn't escape without my parents. I mean we had this\nfamily and had to stay together. And when I left there my parents wanted to go with me and I\nsaid no. I felt very mature when I was that age as a child. I remember that. I decided that I\ncould handle it. I was hoping that if I would go they could stay. But then a week or two\n\u2018Correction: cadre.\nweeks later, very shortly after that, when I was in Birchenov, they came there too.",
        "Q: Let's just stay with Westerbork fora little bit. Was there a school there, was there some kind\nof school?",
        "A: Yes. Actually there was a whole community of life. What I mean by that is, yes children\nwould go to school. I think my sister did go to school. I was already past that because I\nworked in the metal shops and in the fields. But they had, for instance they had a wonderful\norchestra. Then they had opera and theater. Because there was a whole element of German\nJews who had come from Berlin mostly, from the stages, intellectual community, the artists\nwho developed in Westerbork an infrastructure of some very beautiful entertainment. For me\nit was beautiful because I came from a small town and I had never been to opera before in\nmy life obviously.",
        "Q: Do you --",
        "A: No, but they played the typical Strauss and Mozart pieces and all of the pieces which today\nwe take for granted. But they had a lot of musicians and the majority, I won't say majority,\nbut a lot of the leadership of that element were German Jews. Because they also were staying\nthere, they were the -- of the camp. And it was done for the Germans. They wanted it. It was\nalso done because it saved their lives and so they would stay longer. And then of course the\npeople who were in the camp could go in the evenings after the Germans had gotten their\nshare of it. The ones who had no freedom in the camps, there was a camp within the camp,\nwere Jews who were caught who were hidden. And when they caught them they came into\nthe camp and they were within a camp in the camp of Sobibor. They had no freedom at all.\nThey could only stay in the barracks waiting for the next transport to leave for Auschwitz.\nThe irony was that they thought they were punished more. We all got in the same train. But\nthere was again this orchestration of fear, and of total planning.",
        "Q: Did you read?",
        "A: Yes, in Westerbork you could read. There was -- somewhere I remember reading. I used to\nread a lot when I was a child.",
        "Q: Were you alone or were you--",
        "A: No, I had friends. I had friends, but I like to read. I remember when we were in Borquelo, we\nused to go every Friday afternoon to the public library and picked up half a dozen books, my\nfriend and I, and we read. Sometimes even books I shouldn't have been reading in those days\nat that age. But we read a lot and we had good guidance because they had good librarians. So\nwe traded books before we had to take them back the following week, so we did do a lot of\nreading. In the camp there were some books because the camp was started before the\nGermans got there. The camp was started in 1939 about.",
        "Q: Was it clean?",
        "A: Yes, it was clean. Hygiene was good. There wasn't any problem with hygiene that I\nremember. It was clean.",
        "Q: Do you remember differences in the population, richer people, poor people?",
        "A: Not really, not really, no. The difference was the ones who were caught in hiding, they were\ntreated very badly. They didn't get as much food as we did for instance either. There was a\npunishment there to make us understand that there was a wrong thing they had done. And\nalso probably --I think to send messages.",
        "Q: Was your grandmother with you?",
        "A: In Westerbork, yes. She was with us in Westerbork. And she went to Theresienstadt after I\nhad left. My grandfather was also with us, and he left I think, if I remember correctly, shortly\nbefore I did on the transport by himself. He went to Sobibor I found out in recent years\nlooking at lists. Excuse me.",
        "Q: When did you find out that you had to go to Auschwitz, how did you find out?",
        "A: I did not find out at all. I only find out I have to go on the train, and I never heard the name\nAuschwitz. I found out when the train stopped and we got out of the boxcars in Birkenau.",
        "Q: Okay, we have just a few minutes left on the tape, so why don't we break now so they can\nchange the tape, okay.",
        "A: Okay.\nTape #2",
        "Q: Let's talk about your arrest and going to Auschwitz. You went alone?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Can you talk about that day?",
        "A: I don't remember the day, but I know I had to say goodbye to my parents and my sister, my\nuncles. Went 1n a boxcar.",
        "Q: Can you describe that goodbye a little bit?",
        "A: I don't remember. I don't remember. I know I remember we said if we survive we all go back\nto Botula. I mean that's one thing we always had agreed on. But obviously it was emotional.\nBut I must say as a 15 year old, 16 year old it's one thing, but I think more and more about\nwhat it had to do to my mother and my father. It had to be absolutely the worst.",
        "Q: Did you think about that then?",
        "A: I don't think so. I don't think so because it was adventuresome to some extent. Maybe that's\nnot a proper word, but the fear, you were under this terrible fear and now it was already\nseveral years for me, a lifetime at that point, that we lived under this. So I don't remember\nwhat my feelings were. I have no idea. But I think about it since I am a father and a\ngrandfather, that it had to tear my parents apart, their hearts. It had to be unreal. I don't think\nwhat can describe that. That makes me sad. But in the boxcar it so happened that the girl I\nused to know, not dating, but friend, a good friend I went to school with, he was in the same\nboxcar. She was also by herself. And we sat together all the way from Westerbork to\nAuschwitz. And that's about all I remember.",
        "Q: This may seem a strange question, but did you date when you were in Westerbork?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: Did you in some way have girlfriends?",
        "A: Yes, indeed. The camp was -- you lived a life there, whatever that means. I don't know if\nthere was a movie there, I don't remember that, but it was -- I know we were talking about\nthe entertainment they had there. They had a large auditorium, I remember that. And\nevenings there were intellectual, there were lectures there.",
        "Q: Did you take a date, did you take a girlfriend?",
        "A: Yes, I did date. We didn't have many places to assemble or to be alone with a person, but it\nwas just the idea of having a friend. Yes, of course.",
        "Q: Did that seem even more -- well, you wouldn't know by comparison, but urgent in a way to\ndo that because life was so difficult?",
        "A: It was urgent to the extent that you clung to each other because there was obviously a terrible\nloneliness in each person, and a terrible fear. But I do remember that the friendships in the\ncamp in dating, that you just mentioned as dating, friendships were very very deep and very\nsincere. I didn't have anybody that I said I'm going to marry you, it wasn't even important in\nlife to even think that, but as friendships either from before we were there or we met there\nand found friendships there, new friends, and you saw that among others. And then there\nwere movements, there was a whole movement in the camp of Halutsim\u2019...Zionist movement\nwho met regular. Who had only one dream, they all would go together to Israel and they stay\ntogether. They all left together too, they all went to Auschwitz or the other camps. So there\nwas this Zionist movement, there was a cultural life for us to the extent, self-created, self-\ncreated.",
        "Q: Were you in any particular kind of --",
        "A: And the Zionist group, Halutsim, we called ourselves the Halutsim which 1s still used, but it\nwas a youth group, yes. I was younger than some of those kids, but I felt very privileged to\nbe among the bigger kids you see. And the girls, we call in America dating, but that dating\nwas a little different, but the friendships and the discussions and holding hands.",
        "Q: Did you have you first kiss in Westerbork?",
        "A: I wouldn't say it was the first one, but pretty close. No, yes, no, I don't know how to answer\nthat because I don't remember the details of 1t. I do remember certain things which are not\nimportant, in general it's not a matter of seriousness, it's just teenagers, you know.",
        "Q: When you say you clung to each other?",
        "A: Well, we were frightened. There was only so much our parents could do for you. They had\ntheir own problems, they had their own fears and heartbreak. So when you were with your\nown age group, especially girls, and I remember a few of them, we were frightened to death,\nand it was important that you had that emotional friendship. I'm not talking about sex per se,\nwe were too young for that, but there was certainly at the age in those days when you were\n15 and 16 it was a friendship where you could hold hands and embrace each other. How do\nwe know about kissing? Well, you kissed your parents and your sister, but not that emotion\n\u201cPossibly referring to the He-Haluts (Hebrew: \"The Pioneer\"),a Zionist youth group.\nthat we would think of today under the modern so-called post-war society thing in this\ncountry. No, it was just this deep friendship and affections. And I think they were important.\nOf course the last time I held a girl's hand was in the boxcar for a long time because --",
        "Q: That's this friend?",
        "A: This friend, yes.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: I don't remember her name. I know we went to the Jewish school together, I told you about,\nand I don't remember her name. I remember her face. But I remember the person because we\nwere in the same boxcar.",
        "Q: And you sat and you held hands?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And did that help?",
        "A: Yes, I would think so. I'm sure it did because it's got to help a little. And of course we were\nseparated when we got out of the boxcar.",
        "Q: Tell me about the trip?",
        "A: I don't remember anything about that. I know they opened it once for air. We didn't get food.\nApparently we took food I think. I don't remember how long it took, but I remember that\nsomeone said we are going past Berlin or the bombing building. And we heard bombs drop.\nThat's about all I remember. I remember very little.",
        "Q: Do you remember noise, smells in the boxcar?",
        "A: Well, obviously the human, there were no toilets so whatever happened I'm sure. But no one\ndied on that trip. Subsequent of course I have other stories to tell you. But on that trip no one\ndied that I knew of in our boxcar at least. Maybe in others older people. And there's very\nlittle that I remember.",
        "Q: There were other people your own age on that boxcar or were there a variety of people?",
        "A: A variety, older people, younger people, babies, you name it, all of us. The ones who were in\nthat camp within the camp in Westerbork, they had separate boxcars again for reasons that\nonly the Germans will know. Just to have more fear than fear, create more fear than fear.\nThey weren't with us. We never saw them. And them some of them, one particular family,\nthis boy was my closest friend from the day I came to Holland until they went in hiding, he\nwas in that group. They were found, they were in hiding. No one survived in that entire\nfamily of many people, 30, 40, 50 people. That entire family was hidden somewhere. No one\nsurvived, no one. So I remember he was in Westerbork. I saw him through the barbed wire.\nWe couldn't talk to each other, just wave to each other. I couldn't even send him food. That I\nremember.",
        "Q: Do you remember the opening of the boxcar at Auschwitz, do you remember what kind of a\nday it was?",
        "A: I don't know. I know it was in the late spring of '43, somewhere. I don't remember exactly\nwhen. And I remember the enormous screaming, screaming from the outside of get out, get\nout. And instructions where to put your luggage, so-called. We had to leave it right outside\nthe boxcar in a big heap. That's all. You were not allowed to take anything. And then I\nremember, what I remember vividly, we were marked, the men on one side, women on the\nother side, and I remember standing in front of --and I know that my mother had put double\nshirts on me, double sweater, everything was double to make sure and I looked quite heavy\nand was well fed. And I know men were putting this stick out to me and he said \"Wie alt?\",\nhow old. And for reasons I have never been able to say, I said \"achtzehn,\" 18. Now, why, I\nthink only God helped me at that moment because one thing I always wanted to be older. I\nalways wanted to be with older people, more mature people. So I said 18, achtzehn, and he\nused the stick and told me to go this aisle. I forget which side, I think to the left. And then I\nsaw other people going to the right, and I was very almost annoyed with myself that I had\nlied, because if I had told the truth maybe, I thought I was almost punished because I saw the\nothers going on the trucks and I know we had to march because I figured if they go on trucks\nand we have to march so I thought gee, why did I not tell the truth, I would have been able to\ngo on trucks. God knows how far we have to march. But obviously as you all know the ones\non the trucks went directly to the crematorium. And we went from there, we marched to, just\na very short march, I'm sure, to the camp where we then were undressed --",
        "Q: Well, wait one second. When you were in that selection process was there a lot of noise, was\nthere a lot of confusion, were people screaming?",
        "A: No, I don't remember screaming. The only screaming I remember was from the guards and\nthe prisoners who had to get us out of the boxcars, because it was a matter of you didn't\nwalk, you ran. You had to be fast, fast, fast, schnell, schnell, schnell, heraus, heraus, heraus,\nschnell, schnell, schnell. We didn't know why. Today I know why, there were boxcars\nwaiting to be unloaded. But it was always whatever you do, schnell, schnell, and heraus,\nheraus, heraus. That I remember. And we didn't have a chance, I didn't at least, have any\nchance to talk to those prisoners who were assigned to that command to do that work. And of\ncourse language was another problem. We were from Holland, the majority spoke Dutch,\nand we would speak German. No one spoke Yiddish. In Holland Yiddish was not known. I\nnever knew Yiddish until I got into camp. So, yes, it was a rush act, schnell, schnell, schnell.",
        "Q: When did you find out that this was Mengele?",
        "A: I don't know. Shortly after that. Malach-Ha-Mawies, the angel of death. I remember when\nthey talked about the Malach-Ha-Mawies when we got to talk to some other prisoners. And I\nmet a family friend there, which probably was my best -- that was probably my most\nimportant moment to survive. There were a couple of others, but when we left the\nUmschlagplatz where we got out of the boxcars we were taking into a barracks. I remember\nwe were stark naked. Men only. And they were tattooing us. I remember that. And a boy, a\nman, a cousin came up to me and he recognized me. And he was on the first transport which\nhad left Holland to Auschwitz. There were only one or two alive on that transport, and these\nwere young people. The first group out of Holland were young people. The biggest part was\nan orphanage of German Jewish boys and girls, but I think there was only boys that I knew, I\nremember. And they took all those boys, they went in the Jewish orphanage in Holland and\nthey emptied that orphanage. They were not orphans, they were orphans in Holland, they\nwere children that the parents had sent to Holland through some arrangement. And he was\nfrom Dortmund. His name was Hans Gelpter. He's still alive, thank God. He's a doctor, and\nhe's now in Africa. And he knew me, and we knew, we had a lot of mutual friends, and he\nknew my family and I knew his family, only by name. But he knew more about my parents,\nthere was an apparent friendship there or something or acquaintance. He knew my uncles.\nHe had also been at Westerbork. And said a few things to me, what to do and what not to do,\nI remember that. But I felt that I saw someone I knew which had a calming effect. And he\nalso told me that this the first -- the reason he came there, he had the freedom of the camp\nbecause he was one of the early ones. The end of '41 I think they took him, or very early .42.\nBut for six months there had never been a transport kept alive of Jews. This was the first one,\nhe told me. That's why he was so anxious to see who was there since he was amazed that\nthey kept this one alive too. He saw all the previous ones, and they were weekly, every\nTuesday they left Holland and crossed the border. So we talked and he said I'll come and\nvisit you, I know where you're going to be. Because he worked and he was very handy, he\ncould fix typewriters or sewing machine, he could do anything, and he still can. He's also a\nmagician. That saved his life. And he was very good to me by telling me what to do and\nwhat not to do. And we would go to Warsaw together and also to Dachau. So he was my big\nbrother, so-called. He was protective.",
        "Q: Did he see you before you were tattooed?",
        "A: About that hour at that point.",
        "Q: What was that like, standing there with all those -",
        "A: I have no idea. I mean the fear was so enormous that they grabbed your arm and just boom,\nboom, boom, boom, boom and you had a number on. And I don't remember, I don't\nremember if it hurt or if it didn't hurt. I have no idea.",
        "Q: Were you shaved?",
        "A: Yes, shaved. We were bewildered, you know. I mean it's hard to describe. And from there\nwe went to the barracks and we went through the sauna.",
        "Q: Do you want to explain the sauna?",
        "A: Well, it's just a shower, and they use some chemicals for delousing, they called it, and they\nput it on the arms and between your legs. And we all looked alike at that point, we were all\nbald, and we got clothes. We were given clothing, a striped uniform with a pair of galoshes,\nwhat we called wooden shoes with canvas on top, and that was it.",
        "Q: Were you given a hat?",
        "A: And a hat, indeed.",
        "Q: All men were given a cap?",
        "A: Oh, yes. That seemed to be very important for whatever reason. Whatever, it was used for\nanother item of \"Miitzen auf or Miitzen ab\"\u201d and you went through the gate with the music. I\nremember, the next thing I remember we got into the barracks and the way the sleeping\narrangements, you know, the bunks where they pack you in, and the toilet facilities in the\nbarracks which was just a big barrel. And the food distribution where they got -- you know,\nyou got a bowl and they gave you some soup.",
        "Q: An individual bowl?",
        "A: No, I remember in Birkenau you had to share it with two people to one and three people to\none. Whoever could get the biggest gulp out, he got the most before he --",
        "Q: We forgot, what is your number, can you just show your number? Your number is what?",
        "A: 145382.",
        "Q: Big number.",
        "A: I ran into somebody in France just recently on the trip we took with Army and for some\nreason we were talking and this man had a number very close, as close as I've ever seen, he\n*German: literally, \"Hats off, hats on.\" Accompanied by gesture of removing and replacing a hat.\ngot there the same day from Drancy, and we were about maybe a hundred numbers apart. I\nnever seen one that close. I've had a tough time. It was so heavy, the transports were coming\nin so fast, so many in that particular period that some of my friends have just ID cards, some\ncard system there in Birkenau, they don't even have one on me. I've sent one to the Germans,\nit was a German place somewhere I was told, in Bavaria I think and they're still researching\nit. But they told me that there was a period of a month or two that they couldn't keep up with\nthe administration of it. And they told me that yes these numbers were there, we know that,\nbut we are at a loss, we couldn't keep up with registering the Jew numbers.",
        "Q: Let's talk about you going 1n to the barrack for the first time?",
        "A: Wooden slab, sand floors I remember. The rows and rows and rows of bunks. And there\nwere beatings already right away.",
        "Q: Who beat you?",
        "A: The Germans, the guards, and the kapos.",
        "Q: Could you describe?",
        "A: Well, the Kapos were German fellow prisoners, Christians not Jews, who were in the\nGerman prisons for anything from car theft to bank thefts to homosexuals of course, a lot of\nthem. A lot of those German Kapos were homosexuals. And so were the barracks elderly.\u201d\nAnd I remember very distinctly that the barracks elderly he went and asked everybody where\nthey were from and who could speak German. I was one of the very few who spoke German.\nAnd then he asked me where are your folks, and I told him, and he was from the same area\nthat I was from in Germany. He knew the town very well. And since I spoke German he\nused to ask me every so often explain that. Not all Dutch spoke German in those days. Now,\nthey speak more languages because of communication, etcetera and open borders. So he\nevery so often used to give me a piece of bread also. He was a German federal prisoner. He\nwas in the German Gefingnis\u201d but he was a kapo. He never hit me, that one, the barracks\nelderly. The others it was different and the work teams, and so he used to take pity on me.\nBecause he slept separately. There was a section where this orderly slept with a wall around\nit. And he used to give me every so often a piece of bread. And then of course I saw my\nfriend as often as we could sneak or when there was freedom a little bit. He could walk\naround the camp a little bit more than anybody else because he was there for a long time.\nAnd one time he worked also in the Schreibstube, where they do all this--\n*Blockiiltester.\nGerman: prison.",
        "Q: Explain that.",
        "A: It's what they call in the Army the office part of the camp. He worked there for a while\nbecause he typed. My friend Hans was a very talented person, and still is. And then we went\nout -- working on the railroad, on the street gangs, on the street, digging in the street and\nrepairing the street, working on the streets working near the crematorium. I remember that.",
        "Q: Was that near your barracks?",
        "A: You had to go through the gate marching, and you have to take your hats off and you have to\nlook, you know, to the band and they counted, and it was right outside the camp where we\nworked on the work gangs. I did not go to Buna.\u2019 I stayed right in Birkenau.",
        "Q: Did he help you get this job?",
        "A: No, no, 1t was just every hundred, you know. They count a hundred. And then of course the\nworst part was this punishment on Sundays. Sundays, you know, they had to check\neverybody that could work on Monday again, but they kept us standing outside for hours and\nhours and hours, six hours, eight hours. People dropped like flies. And you just didn't stand,\nyou had to do it in a squat position with your hands out. Everything was done to degrade you\nmore and punish you more.\nAnd after a while I was run over by a lorry and I wasn't in too good a shape, but I was managing.\nAnd I was hiding after that with my legs cut. And I was beaten a few times on my back. I still have\nsome scars there. But my friend came to me and he says I'm going to get out of here, you go with\nme, there is a transport leaving. I don't know how long I was in Birchenov exactly, 1t wasn't maybe\nthree months at the most, and it could be even shorter. We were in a daze, we didn't know if it was\nnight or day. There was just this fear, this schnell, schnell, schnell, and no food, and the hunger and\nthe beatings and the screamings at night. He says I am going on this transport unknown. They're\nputting together 300 names and you're going on it with me. I said whatever you say. What did I\nknow, I was a kid and I trusted him because he was older and he was already seasoned, so-called.\nAnd he says I volunteered you, we are going on this transport now. He says the worst that can\nhappen we'll get killed this week rather than next month. With some kind of luck we'll get out of\nhere. We'll never survive here. There is no chance that anybody gets out of here. That we all knew.\nWe were told that no one gets out of Auschwitz and Birkenau. That we know. It's just a matter of\ntime how long. And we knew that the commanders who worked in the gas chambers were every 90\ndays approximately, some of them even every 30 days were killed. So they killed those teams that\nworked in the gas chambers and the crematorium. But they were given good food and then they\ndidn't realize they were going to be killed in those 90 days. And when you got sick it was automatic\n\u00b0 Auschwitz III, or Buna, was a factory for the slave loabor production of synthetics under the\naegis of the German corporation IG Farben.\nBarracks 13, for any reason. And they check you ever Sunday.",
        "Q: What was Barracks 13?",
        "A: That was the last station before you went to the crematorium. That's where they assembled\nthem. So we went into boxcars again --",
        "Q: Wait a minute, let's not leave Auschwitz so fast.",
        "A: I was in a hurry to leave it.",
        "Q: I know. Let's go back a little bit. Do you remember roll call?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: Was that different from what happened on Sunday?",
        "A: No. But Sunday lasted longer. During the roll call you got some tea, you know.",
        "Q: Do you remember how long you stood on roll call?",
        "A: Oh, it varied. Some of them were very very long. Some of them were very long. But on\nSundays it was worse, and they then made you sit in a squatting position, halfway down.\nAnd there were a lot of beatings to scare you more.",
        "Q: Did you try to avoid being beaten?",
        "A: Listen, there was no chance that you avoid that. I mean if they picked on you they picked on\nyou for whatever reason. And they found enough reasons. There were always reasons. I was\njust lucky, I didn't get beaten as much as some others. Maybe I was shorter. Who knows?",
        "Q: When did you find out about the gas chambers?",
        "A: Right away. We knew it within a day or two, maybe even sooner. Not until we got there. The\nsmell, the smell. I mean they were going, seven of them at that time and they were all around\nthe camp.",
        "Q: What did it smell like?",
        "A: Burned hair, burned flesh. It was -- it didn't feel normal, just the sun, the wind, you never\nsaw birds, you never saw green. I mean if there would be a green leaf ten people would jump\nfor it. | mean because everyone was terribly hungry. And so it was the smell, the stench was\njust awful. Plus the fact there was no hygiene as far as bathrooms. There was no such thing.\nThere were latrines, but there was --",
        "Q: Can you describe?",
        "A: In the barracks all they had was a very large wooden barrel. And during the night I\nremember, during the night to used to, whoever was in charge of the night shift, I don't know\nif they call them guards, but they were assigned there to stay up during the night to empty\nthat. They used to wake you up with a stick, hit you over the legs or whatever and you had to\njump out of your bunk and carry this thing down the street. I don't know far, but you can\nimagine a big -- it's like a big wine barrel, bigger than a 60 gallon barrel, even bigger, and\nyou had to carry that, three people, four people, sometimes two people. And they had to\nwatch, if you spilled it you got beaten up. If you didn't spill it you got beaten up. And it was\nso bad because some people just couldn't handle it mentally or physically, they were too\nweak. And I remember once, the first or second night in there, there were two brothers that\nwere Dutch, they couldn't speak German. I remember this distinctly. And they beat one\nbrother to a pulp, he couldn't carry it, so they just beat him to a pulp. And his other bother\nwas watching. So it was one after the other, it wasn't a matter of a single issue, it was hourly.\nIt never stopped, it never never stopped. Did it get better? No. Did it get worse? Yes. And\nthat's why when I said we were convinced we would never get out of here. But then there 1s\nsomething about the human being that you always have hope. Because the ones who didn't\nhave hope they disintegrated real fast. And for some reason I didn't. I always had hope. But a\nlot of people just --",
        "Q: Where do you think you got that from, where did it come from?",
        "A: I don't know.",
        "Q: Were you religious?",
        "A: Well, yes, I was very religious. We were very conservative. We went to Temple, to\nsynagogue. We had kosher food at home. We fasted whenever the Jewish holidays dictated\nthat. And we prayed after dinner. And we prayed at night when we went to bed. My father\ndid not light the fire, my grandfather did. Not my father anymore, I learned it at bar mitzvah\ntime. But most of the time I had to, for a while. But that doesn't mean whether or not my\ngrandfather read the Torah on Shabbas. And my grandfather's brother was the ;\ndid the kosher slaughtering. It was a small community, this is back to Germany. So my father\nwas the alternate with his cousin, president or vice president of the congregation. It was a\nsmall little building they had. So we had a very religious life. And in Holland even much\nmore so. The town we lived in was very religious. We went to -- every night, Temple. We\nwent most morning and on any holiday mentioned in our religion, it was an event. Plus we\nstudied Gomorrah and Rashi. I used to be able to read that. And we studied Mishna. So I've\ndone all that from when I was about ten until I was arrested, those years. And it was very\nserious and most pleasant. And every day we had Hebrew school after the public school,\nevery day, including Sundays. So it was a wonderful life -- we have everything. And they\nhad social events all the time, literary evenings, and that's usually when they brought in\nspeakers. And my father was always kind of the master of ceremonies. He was a really\nentertaining, and he played music. So there was a whole wonderful life for us especially in\nHolland. But going back to Auschwitz, it wasn't an event that is even where you can call it\nhuman. It was at the other end of anything you can imagine. The beatings, the devastation of\nthe people, you could see it, and the loss of everything. And then I worked in the work gangs\nand we saw them going into the gas chambers. A lot of them didn't know. The majority\ndidn't know when they came right up the railroads in boxcars. They didn't know. We knew.\nWe didn't tell them, what's the use. And the work gangs, we were right there. The gathering,\nwe were supposed to be gathering the -- on the crematorium. But you did what you had to\ndo.",
        "Q: Did anyone who was marching, were they close enough to ask you what was happening?",
        "A: No, not that close. And if you did talk to them they beat the hell out of you. I mean it wasn't a\nmatter of -- as an example when a guard threw a cigarette away, if you picked that cigarette\nup and you were caught you were dead. You didn't go near the towers because, you know,\nthey used to throw cigarettes out of the tower. The newcomers didn't realize, they went for\nthe cigarette butt and they never made it back.",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "A: They killed them, they shot them because they said well you're escaping, escaping. These\nthings you learn. That's when I said friend taught me a lot of things real fast. I had the fastest\ncollege education in about a day or a day and a half. Those things are pure luck.",
        "Q: Did you pray?",
        "A: A lot.",
        "Q: When you were there?",
        "A: I remembered the Shabbas. Yes. And I still do. And I take deep pride I think that I don't\nknow any Jew who went through this, I don't know one, not that they are religious, but I\ndon't know any Jew that I know personally who went through that who converted. And that\ngives me deep pride. Now, do we have a reason to convert or just drop the whole thing? Yes\nwe do, yes we do. We saw there was no God in Auschwitz. But then there was a God, for me\nthere was one.",
        "Q: In Auschwitz?",
        "A: Really. I got out. I got out. My parents didn't. My sister didn't. But I still believe in God. I\ncouldn't function otherwise. And I don't want to be even thinking that. I do not to be a very\nreligious Jew, not particularly. I got to Temple and I keep the holidays and I fast and I don't\neat pork. But that 1s maybe because it's maybe a different world today. If I were living in a\ncertain area where this was more handy for me or I could find less excuses, I would like to\nlive that way, I would like to spend more time studying the Torah and , 1 just\ndon't have that. I don't live in that -- which is only a cop-out on my part. I understand it fully.\nBut I'm still dreaming that some day I'll have the time to do that. So I have deep pride that\nmy kind of Jews who were int eh camps with me stayed Jews. And there must be exceptions\nI'm sure. There may be. But this is an important thing that I can think of. The same thing I\nbelieve, the deepest pride I have, I have -- and we were liberated -- the towns around the\ncamp. And I will tell you and I have double checked there with my colleagues, there wasn't a\nGerman killed by a Jew who was a prisoner. We took their food and we took their clothing\nbecause we needed it. We didn't beat him up and we didn't kill him. And I think that that\ngives me probably more pride as a Jew than anything that I can think of. That we had seen\nthe killings and we shouldn't have been killers. There wasn't a German killed by a survivor,\nthe Jewish survivors, because we didn't want to live like they lived with what they had done.\nAnd we didn't stoop down to the levels that we had seen humanity, but we wanted to get out\nof there the faster the better. That I will tell people as often as they ask me. There was no\nGerman killed by Jews after the war.",
        "Q: What did you think of other prisoners when you were there and yourself, what was\nhappening to you and how did you view each other?",
        "A: There wasn't an intimate relationship. First of all we didn't know each other. We were all\nthrown together. I didn't know -- I don't think I knew anybody. Maybe one or two, maybe.\nBut that doesn't mean we were in the same bunk together. And if you weren't in the same\nbunk together you had no time to do anything else. So there was very little social\nintercommunicating, discussion, because during the day you couldn't because you were\nwatched all the time, there was no talking, and at night it was too difficult. Furthermore, it\nwas a matter of survival too. You were constantly watching over your shoulder. To the\nextent that you did receive overnight, if you got a piece of bread in the evening you'd eat it as\nfast as you could.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: Because if you kept it out they stole it. Somebody -- people were not human. I'm not saying\nthat they were thieves, they're not thieves. You ate it so there was no possibility you could\nlose it. And were that hungry anyhow. But I don't remember in those days, and maybe later\non when we get into the other camps we can talk about that, but 1t was a little different\natmosphere in some other camp I'm thinking of for the moment. There was some discussion,\nbut as far as Birkenau was concerned it was all we saw was killings and dead people and\nbeatings.",
        "Q: And at night?",
        "A: At night they were running into the electric wires. They had the a special commander with\ncars who would go along the wires to pick up the people who run into wires. If they had the\ncourage to do it, they'd just get it over with.",
        "Q: Did you ever think about that?",
        "A: Not to go into the wires, no. Once I tempted a guard to shoot me, but it was later.",
        "Q: In Auschwitz?",
        "A: No, not in Auschwitz. Later, I wanted to get it over with. But he didn't.",
        "Q: You talked about getting a bowl. Was that an individual bowl or was this a bowl that was\nshared?",
        "A: No, it was shared. I remember you had to share it. Two people, three people, four people.",
        "Q: How many of you were in the bunk together?",
        "A: I don't remember. But you couldn't lay on your back. That much I remember. You had to be\non one side or the other side.",
        "Q: Did you talk at night?",
        "A: I don't remember.",
        "Q: Could you sleep?",
        "A: Yes, I'm sure we slept. I'm sure we slept. Because, you know, you worked during the day.\nI'm sure we slept.",
        "Q: Do you remember noise in the barrack, smells?",
        "A: Oh, the smells, I don't remember the smells. I know there were smells. There had to be. I told\nyou about the toilet facilities. Yes, noise, screaming, people would -- I know it was bad. I\ndon't know the details. I feel that, and it took me 40 years to even talk about it, I also feel that\nI really don't want to wake up totally to remember everything. This is the first time, as you\nwell know, that I am doing this. And I lived in San Francisco all these years until I got\ninvolved in this Holocaust movement in the '70s, and I don't think anybody knew I was in the\ncamps. I don't wear short-sleeved shirts.",
        "Q: You don't have short-sleeved shirts?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: Because I never. And I'm not the only one. I've heard this by survivors, it's either sympathy,\nand you don't want that sympathy. You don't want to advertise it. And I also believe another\nthing, Joan, that there were a lot of survivors who was ashamed that they were alive after the\nwar. For whatever reason they survived and the rest didn't. And I think it also had to do with\nanother thing, when we came back from the war there was no one who was interested. We\nhad no one to talk to. We had no one to talk to. Now, it's a little different. But there was no\noral history project, there wasn't even a social worker. There wasn't even a friend. There\nwere no friends left. There were no parents. And everybody had problems after the Jews\ncame back from either hiding or from the camps, and everyone was trying to put their life\ntogether. And the survivors, nobody was interested in us. We made it ourselves. We had no\none. I had no one to talk to, and I know my friends didn't either. And we didn't talk to each\nother because we already talked to each other. We saw it with our own eyes how much more.\nMy friend who I told you about, my friend I saw again in Birkenau, he visits me every few\nyears. He's been here about a dozen times. He lives in Bodachia (ph) now, in Bodachia\nnow, . We never talk about this. When I bring it up sometimes just to -- he says\nnext issue. We never talk about it. So we had no one to talk to. So why advertise it.",
        "Q: When you were in Auschwitz his name was?",
        "A: Hans.",
        "Q: Hans. He warned you about things in Auschwitz didn't he?",
        "A: Well, in general.",
        "Q: What was going on, what kind of work he was doing?",
        "A: Well, I know what he was, he worked and he was at that time when I met him he was in\ncharge of about maybe a hundred people repairing sewing machines and typewriters,\nsomething like this. Because he was a mechanic who knew how to teach those people. It was\nfor the administration there. And then he also was a magician, so he had to do magic for\nthose people.",
        "Q: He performed?",
        "A: For the Germans.",
        "Q: A lot?",
        "A: Not at the time I got there.",
        "Q: Did you ever see him perform?",
        "A: Not there, no. Here in our country, oh yes, when he put magic -- together. He's now well\nknown. He became well known after the war.",
        "Q: Did you know other boys your own age in Auschwitz, 16? You were about 15, 16 years old.",
        "A: Yes, well there were some of them the same age. Most of course were older. I don't\nremember. I don't remember anybody except Hans, my friend. And the others were all\nstrangers to me. I was thrown in with them.",
        "Q: You were near the gypsy camp?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember seeing the gypsies?",
        "A: Yes, we saw through the barbed wire, yes. Well, at camp I remember a lot of people in there,\nvery heavily populated. And they had their own clothes and they were men, women and\nchildren. And I remember at night they used to play the violin. I remember that distinctly.\nThis wonderful deep staccatto and the music the gypsies played. I know someone in our area\nwho is a gypsy and I ask him to do it and they can't do it like that, not the way we heard it,\nthe way I remember it. The shadows as you know, the gypsies, the Hungarian gypsies\nespecially. So I remember that music, I remember that music. And I also remember they beat\nthem up a lot. They used to beat the gypsies a lot -- screaming, we heard the screaming. But\nthat was all over the camp. That's about all I remember. I wasn't yet long there, you see.",
        "Q: Were you surprised that there were families together?",
        "A: To us there was no surprises. I mean it was all happening, things that we had no relationship\nto, neither did we understand it. I mean we just accepted hour by hour, day by day. I mean\nthings were moving so fast, but there was hunger and the living conditions and the beatings\nand the killings. I used to see there the camp commander, I think was (ph), I think\nit was, used to drive through the camps of Birkenau on a motorcycle with a pistol and\nwhoever was in front of him he shot.",
        "Q: Did you see that?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Is that the first time you saw somebody killed?",
        "A: I don't know when I saw the first person killed. I don't remember. But I remember him doing\nthat. On a motorcycle, running through the camp, and if he saw somebody in his way he shot\nthem. And we saw in front of the gas chambers when we worked there, you saw them throw\nthe babies in the air, smash the babies against the walls when they were standing in line.",
        "Q: You saw that?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you think about nothing, were you frightened?",
        "A: Well, it all was part of everything. I don't remember my emotions, because if you stopped\nworking they beat you, so you kept on working and shuffling with a shovel.",
        "Q: Did you dream at night?",
        "A: Then?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I don't remember. I don't know if I dream now. But I remember, I don't know, I still, and\nmaybe it's not the proper way to express it, but I have this deep down feeling that I was in a\ncoma, in a hypnosis for the entire duration of my camp life. I mean maybe it's because you\nwere so young. And probably that's what it 1s because very few older people, very older\npeople couldn't handle it. I was a child and maybe that's what gave me the benefit. Now,\ntoday I think different than I know I thought then. And only in very recent years, especially\nof the work I'm doing now even though it's voluntary, and some days I feel maybe I shouldn't\nhave gotten involved in it, but then I also feel very strong, almost overwhelmingly that we\nhave to tell this story. There was another drive I think I had and always had, everybody, to be\nable -- and I wanted it so badly, there was nothing more, than anything else that I wanted to\nget out and tell the story, and I think that drove me more than anything else.",
        "Q: You thought about that?",
        "A: Yes. And I believed I was going to do that. I always believed that I was going to tell the\nstory. Because it drove me so much that how well they know -- I remember I used to hear the\nscream \"Sohor, Sohor,\" remember.",
        "Q: Who would scream?",
        "Q: Whoever the Jews were when they were beating them, \"Sohor, tell, remember, remember\nwhat they did to us.\" I learned sohor very early in life.",
        "Q: This hope that you had and the sense that you would get out and tell the story, do you think\nthat was essential to you're being able to --",
        "A: Well, it didn't help me of creating the situation because I think the situation was created\nstrictly by accident and maybe with the help of God, but it certainly helped me to keep my\nsenses to the extent and to have not all these horrible things penetrate my mind, because I'm\ncertainly not a criminal. And what I have seen I should be a criminal. It happened to a good\nfriend of mine, a friend I had in camp, a young boy my age who came out, and we can talk\nabout it later, and became a criminal, a son of a rabbi, a Polish boy. He became a criminal in\nAmsterdam after the war.",
        "Q: Let's stop now. The tape is going to run out.",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: Let's stop.\nTape #3",
        "A: That's another story.",
        "Q: -- later we can go back to your friend who became a criminal.",
        "A: That's after the war. It wasn't really a nice story.",
        "Q: Had you seen women in Auschwitz?",
        "A: We saw them at a distance, very distant. No, we didn't see them close. When they march by\nsometimes, but not very close by.",
        "Q: Did you notice when you saw them marching that they were in a different condition than the\nmen?",
        "A: Oh, yes. But we knew they were women because they had dresses rather than jackets or\npants like we had. But then they were bald. As you well know they were also shaven. But we\nknew they were there, we saw them. You couldn't talk to them. You couldn't talk to anybody\nfrom any other camp, any other compounds, so-called, what you may call compounds.",
        "Q: Did you ever see women guards?",
        "A: Oh, yes. With the women, yes, women kapos. And we know they treat the women very\nbadly, very very badly, and we knew that .",
        "Q: Worse than the men?",
        "A: Well, we heard a lot of screaming. The screamings we knew. We heard the screamings. That\nwe knew.",
        "Q: Did you stay on this road work the whole time --",
        "A: I remember, yes. He worked on the work gangs. All I remember there were work gangs in\nthe camp, outside the camp.",
        "Q: Did you lose a lot of weight?",
        "A: Yes. I never became a Muselmann. Do you know what a Muselmann was?",
        "Q: No. Explain it?",
        "A: A Muselmann were really the ones which it would be unfortunate to see today on television\nwhen you see Somalia. That's how a lot of not all, most of our people looked. But if you get\nto that stage, since there was no help, that's how they ended up. And they called them\nnewswoman. I can't watch that on television I swear. I've seen a lot as you well know. When\nI see that Somalia thing, I'm ashamed to say that I cannot watch it, I have to turn my head\naway. It bothers me no end. And that's how a lot of our prisoners, all throughout the other\ncamps too.",
        "Q: Did you ever see yourself in a mirror at Auschwitz?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: In a glass?",
        "A: No. In Warsaw that's different. And you'll find out why in Warsaw, because the buildings\nthere they got into, but not in Birkenau, uh-uh.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you would like to say about Auschwitz?",
        "A: No. A lot of things are in my heart and my soul and my mind, but I don't know anything in\nparticular I can think of at this moment except that 1t was so overwhelming. People say well\nwhy didn't you do something, why didn't you escape, why wasn't -- the question isn't even\njustifiable because in Auschwitz the fear, the electric wires, the beatings, the hunger, the\nstarvation, the degradation, you know, the way you were treated, you never had time to\nthink. And then again I have to admit I'm in such a hypnosis still about that today, that now\nwhen I do remember things like chlorine, I can't stand the smell of chlorine. When I have\nchlorine in the water sometimes, especially here you Washingtonians, I can't stand your\nwater because it has a chlorine smell and it reminds me of Auschwitz and Birkenau, and all\nthe camps for that matter.",
        "Q: Why does it remind you?",
        "A: Because they used to spread chlorine around for disinfectant and that smell was always\noverwhelming. And the burning of hair, I can't bear to smell that, for me. Or flesh because it\nreminds you of the crematoria. But you asked me have you been back to Auschwitz, I will\nnot go back. I will never go back to any camp, and I can't. I don't want to wake up. I think\nthat's what it is. I'm afraid to wake up, really wake up. And since I'm having a very good\nnormal life, and I think I can function quite well, I believe, maybe not everybody agrees with\nme, but I agree with me on that issue, I don't want that potential interference. So I want it to\nstay the way it is. That's why I've never done an oral history until now. And look how many\nyears, 48 years, right. Yes, let's leave Auschwitz, and maybe something else will come to my\nmind. But it's very deeply buried, it's very deeply buried, and let's leave it that way for the\ntime being at least.",
        "Q: So let's talk about your friend coming to see you about going on this trip unknown.",
        "A: Yes, it's called transport unknown, something like that. And we went on that, 300 men from\nBirkenau. I believe they were all from Birkenau.",
        "Q: And he's the one who helped you get on this?",
        "A: He helped me indeed. Without him I wouldn't be around there. And how he did it I have no\nidea. And it could very well be that part of the barracks I was in, I don't know. I remember he\nsaid you must go on this. Because I asked him -- no, I didn't ask him, he told me. I said what\nshould I do, and he said you go because I'm going on it and he took me. And then we went\nback to the boxcars one day.",
        "Q: Took the same kind of a trip?",
        "A: No. I remember they gave us a piece of bread when we got into the boxcar. That I remember.\nI don't know why I remember that, but I remember that. Maybe I was very hungry. And then\nwe went in a boxcar. I don't know how long this trip was. It couldn't have been very long. If\nit was a day or two or one day, I don't know how long it was. I know that we ended up in a\nvery large railroad yard in the city, and then of course we found out it was Warsaw. And this\nwas in the summer of '43 I believe. I don't know the dates because we didn't know dates. The\nonly reason we knew it was Sunday in Auschwitz was because it was selection day. That's\nthe only reason we knew that. And then we were marched from the railroad yards in Warsaw\nto this bombed city, this bombed section of the city. And there were fires still going, and\nthere were many dead bodies laying in the streets and a lot of debris. And I remember there\nwere no barracks, that there were sections of barracks laying there. They marched us into the\nghetto. We found out later this was the ghetto. And we marked in, and I think the first couple\nof days we slept outside somewhere until they built this barracks, a wooden barracks. Better\nones than we had in Auschwitz I must say that.",
        "Q: And who built these, did you?",
        "A: Yes, the prisoners had to do most of the work, but it was German supervision. There were\nforeman there who were not prisoners. But the prisoners did all of the labor. Us guys. And\nthen when we started working, and the reason we were there, we were sent there to dynamite\nthe ghetto, to destroy all the evidence, to dynamite all the buildings, to preserve as much raw\nmaterial as we could find from transformers to cable, electric wiring, copper wiring, wood.\nAnd a lot of prisoners polished bricks because those buildings, and I happen to be, for a\nreason that I don't know why, but I was on the demolition team and we had to plant\ndynamite, dynamite they called it, underneath the walls. And then the Germans handled the\nplunger, the wires. We had to set the wires. And I remember a few occasions they, for joy\nrides, they'd push the plunger before the prisoners got out and got away from the walls. I got\nhit over my legs a few times. We didn't run fast enough because we had nothing, we didn't\nhave decent shoes, and couldn't walk that fast because we were not that well fed. And that's\nwhat I did for quite a while. And then for a while I did, and another groups of maybe 30\nguys, we had to find transformers in buildings, electrical transformers, and we had to put\nthem on trucks. And that also was part of the war machine. And then I worked for quite a\nwhile in the railroad yards where the equipment was transferred to and from the eastern\nfront, the Russian front. So that was about what we did. And one day I remember -- oh, and\nmy friend Hans was my helper and sometimes I got upset with him, he once said I got a good\njob, he said I have five people going to some work detail on the other side of the waxer to a\nGerman army camp, army whatever, maybe we can get some food there because five guys\nmaybe they feed you. So he put me, and I remember, and I was reminded of it recently when\ntwo boys, two boys from Croatia, from Zagreb, they were very nice boys, you know, my age,\nand two others, and I forgot the others, I think one was a boy from Berlin, and we went there\non a truck to this army post, German army post. They were all SS troops, most of them. And\nwe dug fortifications. We have to dig trenches. And they beat us up terribly that day, just\nbeat us up terribly. And two of the boys were killed that day. One of the brothers and one\nother man. So out of the five only two walked out. So that night when I found my friend I tell\nhim don't do me any more favors. And so that was Warsaw. And then I worked in Laundry\nfor a while. And my friend he had a job of assigning detail sometimes so he was always\nhelping me, he was always helping me. And Warsaw was different because we lived in this\nghetto. A camp, about two camps they was building. And they give us one camp and then we\nbuilt a new camp. We all got to do that. So out in the big ghetto there and the first camp, and\nthen during the winter, in the spring, in January there was another camp, and 300 were\namplified by several thousand, a lot of Hungarian Jews. And at the tail end we got out of\nWarsaw, there were 3,600 prisoners there. And a lot of them died even during this period\nwhile we were there. But 3,600 and they were mostly Hungarian Jews.",
        "Q: All men?",
        "A: All men. No, we never saw women. The only time we saw women was when we were in\ntrucks going to some work details on the streets. In addition to that they also did a lot of\nshooting of Polish political prisoners in the ghetto in our camp and we had to burn the\ncorpses. There were a lot of corpses when we got there first. We found basements full of\ncorpses. That's a prison they had there and lots of bodies we found. We burned them. There\nwas stacks we had to build. And one day we spend a few days in the Pawiak, I don't know\nabout ten of us who got sent there for a detail, and --",
        "Q: Do you want to explain Pawiak?",
        "A: Pawiak was a fellow prison in the City of Warsaw. I don't know if it's still there. But we were\nsent there for some work detail. I remember spending there a couple of days. I remember, the\nonly thing I remember this heavy heavy stone buildings. And the fed us soup. That shows\nyou what you remember, some odd things. And it tasted like pure soap water. So I asked\nthem why is there so much soap 1n there, and the reason, this person explained, whoever it\nwas, said apparently the soap, and I'm not talking about the Jewish people, I'm talking about\nthe prisoners in this Pawiak, the reason they gave them this soap, they threw a bar of soap in\nevery soup kettle because 1t would decrease their sexual desires. Soap or whatever chemical,\nthat's what they explained to us. Because it tasted like soap, which was even delicious, better\nthan what we had in the camp. But I remember they used that. We didn't have that problem,\nthe Jewish prisoners, believe me. So Warsaw, we didn't have the hunger because we found a\nlot of food in the buildings, staples. There were still staples to be found, barley, things like\nthat.",
        "Q: And you were allowed to keep these?",
        "A: If you could find it and could hide it. If they caught you you were in trouble. But we also had\nother avenues, and while we were in the ghetto the Poles came in and bought the bricks, the\npolished brick, and we used to find clothes and save them bundled up and sold them the\nclothes for a piece of bread or a couple of onions or some garlic and even sometimes vodka.\nAnd they brought things with them and they thought it was our's, those Poles who came in,\nthey had this cart with a horse 1n front of it, so they brought in food, not because they liked\nus, only because it was a business deal. I didn't speak Polish, but we had Poles who could\nspeak the language. And then there were what we found also was in the early days when we\nwere in Warsaw, Jews were in the bunkers, who once had done the uprising, and they were\nstill in bunkers and they came out when the dynamiting started. And when the Germans of\ncourse saw them they shot them on site. But I remember also one day there was a boy and a\ngirl came out. The Poles had been supplying them with food. And they run out of money and\nout of gold and I saw a Pole kill this girl. He killed her because he didn't want to have her\nalive so in case she would implicate him. They weren't very nice. And they were very bad.\nAnd so they didn't help us out of any human point of view, they helped us because it served\nthem. And I remember we worked in the railroad yards and they had Germany material like\nuniforms and shoes, etcetera. And we sold and traded, not so much traded, with the Polish\nrailroad people, traded with them for food. So the hunger was not as bad in Warsaw as it had\nbeen in Birkenau.",
        "Q: What was the barracks situation like, you said it was better?",
        "A: Well, it was more modern. I'll use those words. But they were a little better and there also\nwas heat, there was a stove there. A typical Polish stove out of stone I think they were made.\nI remember there was heat in there. Not always that we had something to burn, but there was\nenough wood laying around because of the demolition we did on those buildings, so it didn't\ncost anything to the Germans. But there is one point I want to make that just came to my\nmind. I happen to believe very strongly, and maybe that's in conclusion later on, that this\nentire issue of the Jews, Auschwitz, etcetera, the destruction of the six million of our people\nwas a very large money-making event for the Germans. That served and financed the biggest\npart of the war industry. Because a few realize how much we were told what to bring. You\nrealized that every person who went through Birkenau that I know of, and other camps I'm\nsure the same, and all the gas and all the crematoriums in the different camps, they looked in\nyour mouth and if you had gold fillings -- had rings, my mother had a wedding ring and my\nfather had a wedding band, so did everyone else who were married couples, there was\nenormous hordes of gold. And I remember one day in Warsaw I found in a house, someone\nhad found, and we had four diamonds, four diamond stones. Was worth about, maybe 5-6\ncarats of diamond. I didn't know anything about that, but somebody said it's a very good\namount. I sold it for a little piece of bread to a Hungarian because he only got there three\ndays before. He thought he made a big purchase. Well, I had the bread and I lived and he had\nno bread that day or for two days, so he didn't get anything for two days. So there was so\nmuch, I mean dollar bills, gold laying on the streets, silver. But the wealth of just the clothing\nalone, you'll see the lists that we have at our museum, and the valuable things just pulled out\nof that ghetto, and that's done in many places, that financed the Germans. It was a money\nmaking event for the Germans. It was a money making event. Aside from they hated the\nJews and wanted them all killed, but they made money on the deal. The clothing, the hair\nwas sold all over the world, recycled in some form.",
        "Q: When I mentioned whether you had seen yourself in Auschwitz you said no, but you didn't\nexplain?",
        "A: We, we were working in all these buildings, while we were working there were some mirrors\nthere and you saw.",
        "Q: Were you surprised at what you saw?",
        "A: No. You didn't have much time for that. It didn't make any difference. It didn't make any\ndifference. What did a mirror mean to us, what did a piece of gold mean to us. Gold had\nnothing to do with it. There was no one to sell it to or give it too. It was almost laying on the\nstreets. It had no value, what could you do with it? If you couldn't get food with it, it doesn't\nmean a damn. So that taught me, and I've said it often to younger people, that wealth is only\ngood if you buy a very fancy painting, it's only good if you can enjoy it and look at this\npainting. But what happens if you need to sell it and there is no one to buy it, then whatever\nyou paid for this write it off real fast. It has no value if you can't sell it, if there's no buyer.\nAnd that's what happened when I had those four pieces of diamonds in my hand. I had one\nbuyer and he didn't survive because he gave me his bread. He was dumb enough to do it, but\nI was at that point seasoned, and I don't want to say smart, certainly seasoned that I knew I\ncouldn't do anything with the diamonds except I needed a greenhorn to sell it to because I\nwas hungry.",
        "Q: Were the relationships among you as prisoners there, 3,600 you said, not that you had\nrelations with 3,600 people, was it different than Auschwitz?",
        "A: No comparison. Much much easier. It was easier. But we were under the treat of being killed\nby selection. We died because there was typhoid in Warsaw by the way, and I had typhoid,\nbut a very mild case, and I wasn't in the Krankenbau, in the hospital so-called. But I got out\nnot very much before when the Russians broke through and got out. But I was in there for a\nwhile, not long. And many died because there was typhoid in there. That's why they kept\nshin the camp. There were 3,600 left at that point. And I think at one time there was probably\nclose to 5,000 there. The camps replenished. That number is -- but I know it was more than\n3,600. And he was told to kill them all. And I'm told, and this 1s all hearsay, that the Polish\nunderground who was watching the camp very much so because they used to take, the Polish\nResistance --brought them in the ghetto and shut them in there with us -- on one wall there\nand we had to turn them then. The Polish underground allegedly told the Germans that if you\nkill all these people you'll never get out yourself, I'm told, because it was not difficult for\nthem to do. And we heard the rumblings of the big guns that was here already because the\nRussians were breaking through. So one morning they had 300 in the beds still, who couldn't\nget out of the bed. They shot them. 300, correct. And 300 were kept there. And the reason I\nknow is because a fellow I was friendly with because he was my age, was a Berlin Jew, and\nhe was selected to be and he had to stay there, that 300. And those 300 were kept\nthere to destroy all evidence, and they were killed. That we were told later on. I don't know\nhow I know, but I know. And because they were killed while we were marching out already,\nthey just burned the barracks or dynamited. It was done very very fast. And 3,000 marched\nout, and we marched and we marched and I remember two things very distinctly. Number\none, that you tried not to be in the back because we heard the machine guns going constantly\nand we were told that anybody who drops out is going to be killed. And they left their\ncorpses right on the road. So they had maybe four or five machine guns in the back of some\narmy truck and they shot those people. All men, there were no women there. They were all\nmen. And we marched and here 1s the thing I remember as much as anything else, we came,\nit was in the summer, it was very hot, no water, and for some reason it rained once and we\nwere going like this with our soup pan and we tried to catch the raindrops. We were very\nvery thirsty, almost to the point of sanity. People were going insane, people were drinking\ntheir urine. And all of a sudden we came over on a bridge, and over the bridge we saw a\nriver. And they took us over the bridge and there was a huge field there, an open field and we\nwent in that field apparently to stay overnight, but to wait for something. And we pushed, the\nmasses pushed so hard, and I happened to be in the earlier part of this grouping of 3,000. Of\ncourse it was not 3,000 anymore, but I was in the first, maybe the second hundred or third\nhundred, very up front. We got into this river, you could wade into the river and we drank\nand we drank and we drank. But the masses in back of us were so anxious to get to that\nwater they kept on pushing and they pushed us too far in the river so we couldn't walk, and\nthey wouldn't stop. And the Germans didn't know what to do, so they thought that we would\ngo in the river and get to the other side and escape. So they start shooting from the bridge\nand from the other side. They used machine guns. They shot. And I remember, because I\nwake up often, that river turned as red as blood. And the Jews wouldn't stop. Our people\nwould not stop. They kept on pushing from the back. And they couldn't stop the Jew and\nthese people. On the German side, they kept killing with bullets and they brought the dogs\nin. And the people in charge made those soldiers, those German SS go in the water with the\ndogs and when the dogs got into the water the Jews stopped. They wouldn't stop for the\nbullets. That I remember. And then they stopped pushing. I was out by then. Because, you\nknow, I got out because they pushed and it came up to here in the water so I got out. None of\nus could swim. I don't know how many could swim. I know I couldn't swim. I told you I\ncouldn't go to the swim because I was a Jew. They never taught me how to swim. So the soil\nwas just bodies and blood, and I could only think about why they called it the Red Sea.\nThere's no connection there, but it was red as pure blood. And they killed a lot. They killed,\nin my estimation, at least 1,000 people there, maybe more. No one knows. But there were\nvery few who got into the trains. And I don't remember if we walked much more, but in the\nend we got in boxcars. I know the town, that much I remember, Zychlin. That much I\nremember. Because you could see the names on there, and I remember Zychlin, so I knew\nthat we had marched due west from Warsaw and then we start trip in boxcars again.",
        "Q: And why did you go?",
        "A: We back in boxcars for quite a while, I remember. And there was no water and no food. I\nremember that. But I know we used the dead bodies to sit for seats or benches alongside.\nAnd I remember that --",
        "Q: Who did?",
        "A: And then --",
        "Q: So that was the worst experience 1n those boxcars?",
        "A: That was, yes. That was the last time I was in a boxcar. And I remember when they opened\nthe doors it was Dachau, and very few got out of the trains. I believe only maybe 200, 300,\n400 at the most.\n[Technical conversation]",
        "Q: I hate to ask you to do this, but can you re-describe the boxcar trip from Zychlin to Dachau?",
        "A: After we went through that river, I don't know how much time there was, not much time\nuntil we were back in boxcars in Zychlin. I know that's where we started this trip. We were\nin the boxcars and for how long I don't remember. I know a lot of people died en route\nbecause we had no food and no water after we had gotten out of the water that day in the\nriver. But no food. And we ended up in Dachau. That much I know. We were in Dachau.\nAnd I think we were only in Dachau for maybe a day or two or less and we went to Allach,\nwhich is a side camp to Dachau. We ended up there. No, pardon me. We went to Dachau,\nI'm too early, to Dachau, and I don't know where we were in Dachau, but I know that about\n200 to 300 only got out of the boxcars. We sat on the corpses.",
        "Q: You said that this was the worst boxcar experience?",
        "A: Well, because there was these people, first of all they were in very bad shape when we got\nstarted on this death march, then that river episode. We had drank too much water without\nfood and there was dysentery, what do you all it, dysentery, right?",
        "Q: Dysentery.",
        "A: Dysentery. So everything there was just horrible. And they died. Some were delirious. And\nwhen we got out we were in Dachau. And we didn't stay there too long. And in Dachau, I\ndon't know how, but I think we went in boxcars again, but I'm not too sure. It could have\nbeen trucks. I think it was trucks. I remember that. We were taken out of Dachau again and\nwe were taken to Landsberg area, Kaufering area, and there were a lot of small camps. We\nwere in a camp and there were other people there already and we were thrown in with them.\nI don't know how many. I think there were maybe 1,000, 1,500 people in this camp. They\nwere barracks. They were put on top of --they dug a hole and put a V, two roofs, I can't think\nof the name right now, but you had to step down. You sat down there on the ground. And we\nwere in there for quite a while, from '44 until -- we worked in various things. The biggest\nwork they did was digging underground munitions factories. What the Germans did, they\nbuilt those V2, it's V2 things they were building out there, but we were building the\nbuildings for that. And they used us prisoners, thousands of prisoners, to build a mountain, a\nmountain of dirt and sand and gravel, and when the mountain was high enough, maybe 40,\n50 foot high, they carried over the wooden pallets and wheelbarrows and then they poured\ncement on top of it and then they washed it out. So they built a building reversing the trench,\nsee.",
        "Q: Did you do that?",
        "A: Yes. I worked there to carry dirt up these planks, you walked up and you dumped it and you\ngot more. So you had this hugh mountain. And then they put lots of cement around it. I don't\nknow, I didn't know much about construction, at least not what I know today. And that was\nused for the V2 rocket engines up there on the buildings. We lost of lot of people there\nbecause there was typhoid again. The food was very mediocre of very bad. There were lots\nof beatings but not as much as we had seen in previous camps. Everything was bad. And the\nattrition was very very high. But there bodies weren't burned. They were taken to a site in\nmass graves, hugh mass graves. I don't think they have ever been found. I wouldn't be able to\nfind them. They were huge mass graves. It's not very far from the Landsberg prisons where\nHitler had been. It's very close by there. But huge mass graves. And it was so bad that we\nhad a lot of suicides there. People were going into the electric wires. And I remember that's\nthe only time I ever saw cannibalism. There was so little food in '45 there in January and\nFebruary and March that we saw that they were cannibalizing the bodies and people were\neating it.",
        "Q: Were you tempted?",
        "A: No. No, I never was tempted. I wasn't that bad off. I was bad off, but not that bad off yet. But\nI have seen it. You saw it. And the Germans caught those people and they killed them. So\neither they were dead or they went into electric wires.",
        "Q: So this was surrounded just like the other camps?",
        "A: Yes. Except it was smaller than the other camps we had been in. There must have been\nmaybe a dozen of them out there in the area. There were a lot of them. It was Muhldorf and\nKaufering and Landsberg, and the names just --",
        "Q: Were the procedures the same with roll call?",
        "A: Roll call, the same thing. The same thing and work, work, work, and no food and there was\ntyphoid around and it was --",
        "Q: And what did they do for uniforms, did you have the same uniforms?",
        "A: Always the same. All the same uniforms, yes.",
        "Q: You didn't change?",
        "A: Well, I don't know how we got -- we may have given them when they were torn and you got\nothers, but we always had those stripers. And I remember it got very cold in '44 and '45\nbecause it's in Bavaria. And that took a lot of lives.",
        "Q: Were you able to get additional clothes somehow? Did you steal clothes from the people\nwho died?",
        "A: Yes. If you could, but you had to show them -- there were inspections too, so if you were\ncaught, if you were caught anywhere with more than what you were supposed to have you'd\nwish you hadn't done it. They killed you or beat you. Then there were many days when the\npeople did escape or tried, and they caught them all. I've never seen anybody that I know of\nwho got out. And when they caught them, they had latches and they had this bench you had\nto bend over like a table, and lots of hangings, lots of hangings. As you may notice I haven't\ngotten into any of the gory things about brothers had to hang brothers if they knew it, and\nlots of beatings right in front of the prisoners when there was roll call. Daily almost. Findings\nways to keep your mind -- a lot of beatings, a lot of hangings. Not so much shootings.\nShooting was only when they started running. And they tempted you constantly by throwing\na cigarette butt out and if you were dumb enough to run after that you were dead. But lots of\nhangings. And then they brought in next to us a camp with women, with 30, 40 women. And\nthey used them to do their kitchen work and I think administration. And they have used these\nwomen.",
        "Q: What do you mean?",
        "A: They used them as prostitutes. They are mostly -- they were Czech, some Hungarians and\nsome -- Jewish girls, all young. They killed them at the tail end.",
        "Q: How did you find out about them?",
        "A: We saw it.",
        "Q: You saw it?",
        "A: They were right parallel to our camp.",
        "Q: So you could see them being raped?",
        "A: No, we did not, but we knew it. At night we used to sometimes be able to talk over the wire a\nlittle bit. It was very dangerous to do it. But one of our buddies was an electrician, was the\ncamp electrician, he was from Berlin, and he used to arrange there was a short sometimes so\nwe could toss some food to the girls.",
        "Q: And so the women would tell?",
        "A: Then they would tell the stories. And in the kitchen, you know, they did work in the kitchen\nso we had contact with them.",
        "Q: So this must have been very shocking.",
        "A: Yes, well, there's nothing shocking that we saw. Then I worked -- from there I worked on the\nrailroad yards in the town. I think it was Kaufering, I'm almost sure on the railroad yards\nthere, to do the loading and unloading. And there was one guard he said to me, he found out\nI spoke German, and he gave me, he says I want you to listen to this, he says, if it gets very\ndifficult to go and take off and go to this address. Which on the surface sounds very\nbenevolent and I should have maybe done that, but I didn't trust him. So I said \"Danke\nschon.\" I thanked him. I didn't take that chance. We were so mentally programmed that we\ncouldn't trust them. I couldn't true. And this may have been a sincere person, I don't know. I\nsaw him every day at the railroad cars where I worked and he said that to me. Because he\nasked, he said does anybody here speak German, so I put my hand up. And after maybe a\ncouple of weeks he saw the same face and I saw the same face and he said that to me. I didn't\ntrust him, I didn't do it. I wish I had done it a few weeks later when we were on another death\nmarch.",
        "Q: To where?",
        "A: From that camp back to Dachau. It was in the last week of April. We marked and we\nmarched and we marched and a lot of boys got killed. And then one night they had us on\nsome farm I think 1t was, and the Germans, part of their troops had already deserted, the\nGermans, and they were scared for us, but we didn't know that, but in retrospect I can figure\nthis. They said to us, look you all behave now, everything is fine, we are instructed to take\nyou to near the Swiss border. We had no idea where we were. We are near the Swiss border\nand we are taking you by orders of the International Red Cross over the Swiss border\ntomorrow morning. And I remember that night when they told us that, we all started crying\nof joy. We were free. They told us you are free. I remember distinctly, very distinctly, you\nare free but don't run away because you'll be better off if you stay with us because you are\ngoing to Switzerland. To us this was of course the beginning of a new life. And we stood\nthere and cried. I remember that. And especially one friend who was from Brussels. By that\ntime I had made some friends. We had been together for a long time. We stood there and\ncried and cried. And then morning came and we started marching believing we were going\nto the Swiss border and before we knew it we were in Dachau. The gate closed and it was\nAllach really which was a side camp of Dachau. So we were back behind the wires. And\nthen within a few days we saw the Americans come in, on the 30th of April that morning.\nThen they came over the little hill and we had to tell them we could walk, I could walk. We\ncould tell them and others could took. There were a lot of non Jewish prisoners there,\npolitical prisoners, Dutch, French, Belgium, Poles, mostly Western Europeans. And they had\nto tell the Americans not to touch the wires, they were under high tension. But the night, the\nlast night in that camp, the night of the 29th and the 30th there was a bombardment in that\ncamp. The Germans had for some reasons -- batteries around that camp, that I remember\nseeing, and the turned those batteries into the camp that night. They killed a lot of kids, a lot\nof people, mostly Jews. They turned to the Jewish part of the camp. The Jews were separate\nfrom the Christians. And they put their guns, aircraft guns go on an angle towards the sky\nand they put right through, straight out, horizontal into the camp and killed a lot of our\npeople the last night. And then the next morning the Americans came and they had to get the\nengineers to take the wires and the electricity off the wires, and we were liberated. And the\npicture you see that we use at the museum, that liberation picture, I'm in that picture. I think I\nknow who it is. I think I know who it 1s, that person that I see there.",

I always remember that when I saw my\nparents go to the gas chamber I couldn't cry, I was so hardened already. See, but then I'm\nvery grateful because I'm not that hateful. I just put it out of my mind. When I think about it,\nI pick up a book. I don't want to think about it. I read. I've done that ever since '45. If it starts\nto come into my mind, I pick up a book real fast. That's the only way I can survive.",

        "A: Yes. My parents were born in the same vicinity within a few miles from where I was born\nand so were my grandparents on both sides. And several generations, I don't know three or\nfour or five, maybe longer. I had one sister who was three years younger than I am. And my\nfather's parents lived in the same house with us on the second, two story house. And my\nfather had two sisters and a brother. One sister died 1n the early '30s of natural causes. And\nhis brother, my father's brother, and my father, they all were in the First World War as\nGerman soldiers. They were German citizens. And my father's brother died shortly after the\nFirst World War, he was gassed in France, during when they used gas in France, so he died\nof complications. And he died in 1920 or '21. I don't know exactly when those years, right\nafter the war. And my mother was born in a town next to us, about eight kilometers to the\nwest. And she had three brothers and a sister. They were some early children - born in... who\ndied in infancy. And my grandfather on my mother's side, he died two years before I was\nborn. My grandmother lived in that town next to Ochtrup - where I was born with her two\nsons. And one son lived and was married in another city, not very far from there. And we left\nGermany in the end of '36 about. We went over the border to Holland --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Yah, I was six years old.",
        "A: Indeed. I lived on a street, I remember vividly there, were four boys who were all the same\nage and all in the same grade. At the time I lived near a boy's school and a girl's school. It\nwas a Catholic community. Shortly after '32, about '33 or '34, they were not allowed to play\nwith me any longer. I remember that. I also was in, I think about the second or third grade, I\nwas not allowed to sit in the class with the rest of the students, I had to sit in the back. The\nteacher I had, the one I remember the best, he was very nice to me. But the principal was a\nNazi, because he insisted that I was sitting, that I would sit in the back. I only had about one\nor two report cards and then I was told I would not get any more report cards. I remember\nthat. And the other incident I remember quite well 1s, um, we had, we lived in a small town\nwhere there are only ten Jewish families. There was no professional teacher, and my mother\nused to teach me Hebrew, I'm talking about Hebrew. And so as much as my mother could\ntaught me the primers and the prayers and the alphabets, etcetera. It was necessary that we\nwent to the next town over, which was a provincial town, where they had a professional\nteacher and a school, and most of the Jewish children in that province area in the county\ncame to this town on various days of the week. I remember we used to go there one day a\nweek, and first myself and then my sister and cousins of ours. Another girl and my sister, and\nthree of us used to go by train once a week, I think it was on Tuesday, it was the early part of\nthe week. And we had to go by train which was probably about an hour and then you had to\nwalk for a bit to go to that school which was next to the synagogue in that town. The town's\nname was Burgsteinfurt. And I remember one incident in particular because there are always\nbullies on the street. For some reason they knew that we were Jews. And one day I was\nattacked by a boy maybe in his early teens, 15, 14 or 15. And he threw a knife at me and cut\nmy legs. I remember coming to school where they had bring in a nurse and they bandaid me.\nAnd then shortly thereafter I couldn't we couldn't go to that school anymore.",
        "A: No, my sister and our friends, my sister's friend, our cousins were with me then. And I\nremember that and that's about all I remember as far as anti-Semitic attack on me physically.\nI was beaten up later on in the middle '30s in school by boys in the class. And then I couldn't\ngo. I went once in the years -- they took me in the early days to the city swimming pool and\nthen I was told that I could march with the class to the pool, but I couldn't be in the pool\nbecause I was a Jew. I happened to be the only Jew in the whole class, the whole school of\n800 children. But I remember distinctly that it bothered me a great deal that I could not be\npart of my friends to go into the pool once every few weeks or once a week when the class\nwent to the swimming outing, in the summer of course, it was an outside pool. But I wasn't\nallowed to go in there.",
        "A: Yes, I worked. I was a good student. I remember that. But the principal had decided that as a\nJew I was not entitled to a report card. So I sat in the back of the class until '36 when my\nparents saw that it was impossible for us to live there. And we had relatives in Holland and\nwe left then.",
        "A: I don't remember the discussions. I remember thinking about it in depth that my father and\nmother thought that Holland would be safe for us because during the First World War\nHolland was kept neutral just like Switzerland was kept neutral even in the Second World\nWar. Because the Germans needed Holland in the First War, that's where the Kaiser ended\nup. And I think my father believed that the same thing would happen again because they\nneeded an outlet where they could escape to maybe. That wasn't the case because on May the\n10th 1940 of course the Germans invaded Holland, and they were there early in the morning.\nWe were right on the border there.",
        "A: I don't remember. I don't remember that. I know that we went late at night by car. We went\nover the border.",
        "A: My father, my mother, my sister, myself, and I think my grandfather. I'm not too sure. My\ngrandmother had died, my father's mother had died in 1936. I remember because I was on\nvacation and I had to come back. I was with relatives in another city. And I don't remember\nif my grandfather came immediately with us or shortly thereafter. I think he didn't come until\nKristallnacht, which is another story here. And he lived with us. My aunt, my father's sister,\nwent to Belgium to live with her first cousins, my father's first cousins in Belgium.",
        "A: No. Bare essentials. I don't remember if we even took furniture.",
        "A: I was ten years old. I don't remember toys. Toys weren't as prevalent then as today.",
        "A: We went to a small town in the eastern part of Holland called Borculo. It had about 40\nJewish families, 40, 42 Jewish families, a very religious town, conservative. And it was a\nwonderful life for me there. It was the first time in my life that I was accepted among my\npeers. It was probably the best part of my life that I have ever had was from 1936, end of '36,\nuntil '40 because uh I wasn't a Jew any longer, meaning I was just one of the boys, one of the\nkids which I never knew before. And there were children my age, Jewish and non-Jewish. It\nso happened that one boy was my age and became my best friend. He was killed during the\nwar with the entire family. But we had a wonderful life there. It was very difficult for my\nfather and mother because they came with nothing. They had left everything behind. We had\na house in Germany. We are not people of means. My father had a hard life and he worked\nhard and there wasn't an abundance of money. To the contrary it was a struggle. And not on\nmy mother's side, they were affluent. But we never felt poor of course, we had a good life in\nthe family especially. But in Holland it was hard for him to begin because we had to start\nfrom point zero and it worked out quite well.",
        "A: In Germany my father was in business with his father, in the cattle business. Most of the\nJews in that area were in cattle. Most the majority were in the cattle business. My father\nlearned the textile business when he was a young man. And when he came to Holland it\nwasn't possible to go in the cattle business, that would take lots of sums of money to pay and\ntrade, so he went back in textile, which he knew. And first he worked very hard with a\nbicycle and suitcases and went from one farmer to the next for about three years. And my\nmother did the sewing. He sold dresses and aprons and whatever, and he came home with\nthe measurements and my mother worked at night and during the days. She also had a\nvegetable garden and no help. But it was a good life. And then my father was able to buy a\nsmall store on the main street on this town. Somebody retired or died, something, a Jewish\nfamily, and the son I remember sold it to my father. I don't know the arrangements. And we\nlived behind the store which was a much better life for my father, he didn't have to go by\nbicycle every day. And then it developed that my father run the store. He went one day a\nweek sometimes 2 days a week, to travel. And my mother did take a very active part in the\nbusiness and did the sewing and helping in the store.",
        "A: I had to work after school hours. I had to deliver merchandise to the people that bought. I\nwas the delivery boy. It was nice. And then my grandfather came. He was living with us\nthen. And then in 1938, Kristallnacht, my grandmother came to live with us, my mother's\nmother.",
        "A: Her name was Erica Soloman. My mother's maiden name was Soloman. She survived the\nwar. She went to Theresienstadt. I'm sure you'll ask me about that later, but she survived the\nwar. And my uncles, her two sons, my two uncles were arrested in Germany by the local\npolice in a small town, a very small town there. They were the only Jewish family there.\nThey were born there. And they were in jail, but during the night a few neighbors took them\nout of jail and held up the policeman who was their friend actually, and they took 'em by\nbicycles over the border, and took 'em over the border to get 'em from not being taken to one\nof the concentration camps, wherever they were taking them in those days, probably Dachau\nor Buchenwald. And they were immediately put under house arrest in Holland by the Dutch\ngovernment. And they lived with another cousin of ours. My mother uh, my grandmother\nrather, I think and her two sisters married in Holland and had their children. And then the\nDutch put 'em in a camp in southern Holland, and then from there they were building\nWesterbork which later became the transit camp. They were in Westerbork from about '38,\n'39 on. They stayed there during the war and they were liberated by the British or the\nCanadians, I forget now.",
        "A: Well, Holland is a very good country. It was a very good country even more so then than\nnow. Things have changed in Holland too. But the Dutch were just wonderful to us. And I\nfelt it very strongly because I came from a very severe system of antisemitism and total\nseparation from my surrounding area, my surrounding community where I was born and\nwhere I grew up as a small boy. When I came to Holland I was accepted like an equal. I\nalways remember that. The children in my class, the neighbors, that's like it should have\nbeen anyhow. But... So it was most revealing for me.",
        "A: No, it didn't change radically. It took about a year in general. Yah, there were, laws were\nmade of course and we had to turn in our bicycles and there was a curfew at night for the\nJews from 7:00 o'clock on. So not immediately, but very soon. Then of course we also\ncouldn't go to school any longer, to public schools after about maybe eight, nine months to a\nyear. So we went by bus to the next town over which was a large community and they had\nbuilt a Jewish school. They took one of the schools that the city I think gave them and they\nmade it into a Jewish day school. And we went by bus every morning.",
        "A: Oh, sure. Because on the buses we had to wear a star. And when the Germans came on the\nbuses, were public transportation systems, the rails were not running any longer. law. They\nhad a bus system between all the different towns. And when Germans came in we had to get\nup and go in the back of the bus. And if there were too many Germans they threw the Jewish\nkids out of the bus, anyone with a star, they threw us out and we had to wait for the next\nbus. That happened once every other week maybe, sometimes more often. And then when\nwe walked -- for instance when we got to the town where we went to school I remember it\nwas quite a way, it was maybe 45 minutes to an hour walk, there were no buses. And our\nclassmates used to come by who lived there and picked us up on their bikes, and they picked\nus up and took us to the school. And then they had to turn 1n their bicycles, it was the end of\nthat transportation system. But it was good for me because we could continue our education,\nand they were good teachers, and that was the end of my education at that point. I had by\nthen maybe six, seven years of elementary education from the first grade to the sixth or\nseventh grade, I don't remember the details. It's a little different in Holland than it is here.\nThen at one point Jews could not be in the buses at all any longer. So my father thought, and\nbecause he was told that we couldn't sit at home either that we had to keep busy, and my\nfather called some acquaintances of his and I worked on a farm. I had to go every morning at\n6:00, go to a farm. I worked there in the fields as a child. My father had the store still, but\nthey were told that if you don't work you will be arrested earlier. So my father arranged that I\nwent to work on a farm.",
        "A: Anything you do on farms from milking cows to harvesting the wheat and feeding the\nanimals.",
        "A: No, not on this farm. This was -- other children had to do it on other farms, yes. This age\ngroup. And even old people. This was mainly because information filters down and they said\nif you work they don't arrest you. They did anyhow.",
        "A: No. My sister, no. She was a little too young.",
        "A: No. An edict came down and you had to buy them. I remember that you had to buy them. I\nremember that my father had to sell them because he had a textile store. They had a J-O-O-\nD. Jood. That's a Dutch name for \"Jew\" But you could not pin them on. I remember them\nsaying that you could not pin them on with a safety pin, you had to physically sew it on to\nyour outer garment. That was very very important, I remember that.",
        "A: No, no, no. they were printed by the Germans or by edict of the Germans. No, no, you had to\nbuy them from some whatever institution. And you had to sew them on of course, you had to\ndo yourself. My mother did it. Most likely my mother. Excuse me.",
        "A: Oh, I don't know. I'm sure there was an anger. It was an embarrassment, it was degrading.\nBut there were so many things happening, one was heaped on top of the other. It was a\nsystematic, well thought out, and very orchestrated move to degrade, to belittle, to destroy\nthe minds of the people to make them powerless. It's not that -- it would have been simpler if\nthey pick us up and take us to the camps, but there was a whole prelude of acts from turning\nin your radios to turning in your cars and your bicycles. We didn't have a car, we had\nbicycles. Of turning in anything valuable, even turning in furniture. But one could not have a\nradio I remember distinctly. And I know the bicycles because I remember I had a bicycle for\na short time during that farm episode and then I know I had to turn the bicycle in, so I had to\nwalk every morning to that farm which was about an hour's walk. And you did it. I mean\nvery disciplined for various reasons. But, yah, 1t wasn't an anger that I remember a deep\nanger at this point in my life, I don't remember that. But I do remember \"why\"? It just was to\ntake away, step by step, your whole humanity. There was a system of dehumanizing\neverything we knew of from sitting in the back of the bus, wearing the star, a neighbor is not\nallowed to talk to you and wouldn't for fear of being put in the camps or being ostracized.\nEven in Germany as a child the children could not play with me. And I remember one\nepisode, I was standing in front of my house and I wanted to play so badly with the boys I\nused to play with, and they just said, \"you can't.\" And I used to cry a lot, I remember that.\nWhile I'm talking things come back to me. I used to cry. I felt 1t even harder on my mother\nand my father. See, a child has so much capacity and a lot of things a child doesn't\nunderstand, and in retrospect and I've thought about it in recent years a lot, is the anguish my\nparents must have gone through to see number one, their own life destroyed. They had\nfought for the same country that was doing it to them. My father was very popular, and my\nmother, in the local community, the bowling clubs and the veterans organizations. And then\nwhen their children their own life and their children, to me it must have been a horrible,\nhorrible part of life for my mother to see what happened to her children. I mean there was no\nfuture. And where do you go if 1t goes downhill orchestrated by a government, not only by\nindividuals. But they didn't give up easy, I must tell you. There's a thing I remember quite\nvividly. My father was very nationalistic. He loved what he did because he was a veteran, he\nwas wounded, he had medals from the First World War. And on Veterans Day, what we call\nhere Veterans Day, they had parades in those days just like we have here. And the veterans\nhad their rifles and they put their rifles over their shoulder and they march down the main\nstreet, and I remember that my mother was laughing. And my father he still left to go to that\nparade and march in the parade, but he couldn't have a rifle, and he was a Jew. So he took a\ncane and he wasn't the only one, others did too, and they took a cane and turned the can\nupside down and put a flower on the top of the cane and they marched with their Christian\nfriends, previous friends, they marched in the same parade and you could pick the Jews out\nbecause they carried a cane as a substitute for a rifle. In those days we didn't think much\nabout it because that's the way it was. You made the best of everything. But when I think\nabout it today it does make me angry obviously. So there were many instances like that, but\nUS...",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: All of them. There was no one who dared. It would reflect even in the school. It was an\norchestrated way of ostracizing the Jews. And they didn't monkey around by saying well\nmaybe I should or shouldn't. They just didn't talk. Actually, that's why my parents left. We\nleft early because we thought we could save ourselves. Now, my grandmother had arranged\nto take the whole family out of Germany to go to Chile. And she bought visas for us, for\nherself and her two sons. Her daughter was married with two small children, my aunt, my\nmother's sister. And shortly before this was all going to happen, when we would leave, we\nfound out that they were phonies. Someone had taken a great deal of money from my\ngrandmother. She was a matronly person. She was very very bright. She had been a widow\nsince she was in her early 50s. And these were phony, false, false visas. So there was an\nattempt made to get out obviously. But then we also lived in small towns. There was no\ncommunication like we have today. And just to give you an example how small, my\ngrandmother's phone number was number 2. Number | was the city hall. She had the second\nphone in the town. So you can imagine the system of communication in those days. No one\nknew what was going on except what filtered down through the government's edicts and\nattacks.",
        "A: Well, they came over the border that night and we knew it pretty fast because my\ngrandmother came over the border for some reason. I don't even remember how she got\nthere, I really don't. I remember my uncles come across, but we never saw them because they\ncouldn't stay with us. We were not Dutch citizens, we were there on permits as aliens. And\nthey let us stay there because my father did have a permit to move there in '36. -- but we\nnever became, the Dutch didn't make you citizens. They didn't make any of the German Jews\ncitizens. So I was made stateless when Germany declared the Jew status in the Nuremberg\nLaws. I don't remember what year that was, but I assume it was before we left Germany. I\nthink it was in '35 maybe. So we lived as normal citizens. We didn't have to report or\nanything like that. Maybe they kept an eye on us, I don't know. But my uncles who came\nover during Kristallnacht could not stay with us because we didn't have the permission from\nthe Dutch government to harbor even relatives, my mother's brothers. So they stayed with\ncousins who were Dutch citizens. They could not walk the streets. They were under house\narrest and then they put them in a camp. So my uncles in essence were in camps locked up\nfrom 1938 to '45. They never saw outside life for those years.",
        "A: At first no, no. The store was open, the store was open until we were arrested to go to\nWesterbork. But he had a very difficult time getting merchandise because a lot of us was on\ncoupons already and the quarters were very little specifically because when the quarters were\nestablished he had very little business, so they were based on previous businesses. But no, I\nremember that the store had some merchandise on the shelf when we walked out to the local\nschool, the auditorium of the school where they assembled all the Jews that night. And we\nwere picked up by the Dutch police. They were not Germans. The Dutch police picked up us\nbecause they were told to pick up the Jews.",
        "A: In those days?",
        "A: Yah. Food was not a big problem. We lived in a small town, farm towns, it wasn't that\nserious in those days. It became serious later I am told for all the Dutch people. But we didn't\nhave that much of a problem with food until we were arrested.",
        "A: I had both Jewish and non Jewish friends.",
        "A: Well, in Holland this wasn't so.",
        "A: No. It was only in Germany. In Holland, no the Dutch people didn't follow that.",
        "A: Yes, indeed. And everybody felt sorry for you, but there was nothing you could do. They\nwere hard on the Dutch people too and the Christians. As long as they behaved and didn't do\nanything political they left them alone. There was rationing. There was no gasoline, etcetera.\nYou couldn't buy bicycles or tires for the bicycles. But in the cities it was very severe,\nespecially later part of the Occupation. But no, 1t wasn't that bad. We never had a shortage of\nfood. We may not have had everything, but there was no shortage of food for us until we\nwent to Westerbork. Just shortage of freedom. Excuse me.",
        "A: Yah, we became very close in the last years when we got older. She was two years younger.\nShe had reddish hair and her name was Erika. She died in Auschwitz.",
        "A: I don't know, I don't know. We had a very normal family life. And she had lots of friends like\nwe all had.",
        "A: Yah.",
        "A: Oh, I don't know. I don't remember. What do children do? We did what everybody else did.",
        "A: No, no. First of all you don't have the choice, and second of all she was my sister. And she\nwas very bright. She was a good student, I remember. She went to a girls school and there\nwere two schools, boys and girls. They were separated. And she had lots of friends, I\nremember that. And I was 14 when I saw her last, 15.",
        "A: Oh, I knew quite a few people in hiding. I mean not a lot, but several families went into\nhiding. See, we were relatively newcomers 1n the town because we had only gotten there.\nYou know, we weren't born there, my father wasn't born there, etcetera. So we knew... my\nfather knew people, I knew that, but he wasn't -- I don't know, there weren't these\nconnections like if you were born and raised with the same people. And then I think the other\nissue was finances. I mean the people were hiding people. Most people had to, most people,\nif not all, but most people had to pay, there had to be some resources. My father didn't have\nresources, but that doesn't mean that some people may have been hidden and saved who\ndidn't have resources, it may be so, but I know the ones that went into hiding had some\nresources which we didn't have. And then the other issue was that it was well known that if\nyou were caught, the Jew, you would be shot on sight or something very different, terrible\nwould happen. Furthermore, the Christians who were hiding the Jews were treated as Jews if\nthey were caught. They were taken to the camps or shot too. It was a heroic, heroic gesture,\nanyone who hid Jews. There was some abuses, but I don't think that's major at all. But the\nones who hid Jews are very heroic people. And I knew some after the war, but we didn't\nhave the connection in my opinion. And frankly no one expected that this was a matter of\neither life or death. All we knew is we were going to camps for the duration of the war\nperiod. And we believed it. Everybody believed it. Well, some maybe didn't, but as far as we\nknow we believed that this was just this period of time to be in camps. Where? We didn't\nknow. Later on when we got to Westerbork we knew we were going to eastern Europe. We\nknow some of them were going to eastern Europe, but letters came from eastern Europe,\nsome of them. We knew that Mauthausen was where the first Jews picked up in our\ncommunity, were taken to Mauthausen and then we were told they died there from hard\nlabor. Our rabbi, they picked off the leadership first and the younger people. But that hiding\nbusiness, it's hard to explain because we lived in an atmosphere of terrible, terrible fear, so\nfor all I know maybe my father tried and it didn't work.",
        "A: Well, you were notified.",
        "A: By the local police. And you were given a list of what you could take.",
        "A: A piece of paper came. I don't know how it got there, but we got a piece of paper from the\npolice I think that said you can only take this, this, and this, one suit or two suits, and two\nsets of underwear, and a toothbrush, and a pair of shoes, and etcetera. So orchestrated and\nwithout -- and the Dutch are very organized, very respectful citizens and we followed, we all\nfollowed. And we were told two days or three days before that we would have to be ready\nsuch and such an evening or afternoon, and we were taken. The local police came by, there\nwere only one or two policemen in the whole town, and they came by and took us to the\nschool auditortum. We stayed there for, I don't know how many hours, I don't remember the\ndetail, but I know we went in this auditorium where I used to play as a child, as a student\nrather. And then we were taken by bus to the closest railroad station.",
        "A: I think we walked over there.",
        "A: Yes, they all came there. And before the evening was over they were all there, whoever were\narrested, several hundred. There were 42 Jewish families in this down. Some of them had\nalready done in hiding, and a few were picked up earlier, and some got out. Some of the\nmore affluent ones, families, got out before 1940. They went to England.",
        "A: You took -- yes, we took food with us.",
        "A: Just for maybe five, six, seven hours, maybe not even that long, I don't remember. We went\ndirect from there to Westerbork by train to the next town where the next railroad station was,\nand there they put us on a train with a police escort of course. And we had these big\nknapsacks, you know, what do you call them, the thing you put on your back, packs, and\nthat's all you could carry. You couldn't carry a suitcase with you, it was just all in this one\nbig backpack, it's called.",
        "A: In Westerbork, well you got off the train and they marched you to a barrack, an there was a\nprocessing center and registration, etcetera. But you kept whatever you had with you, it\nwasn't taken away from you.",
        "A: I don't remember that. I don't remember that at all. But we worked there, we spent quite a\nwhile in Westerbork. I worked there in the metal shops.",
        "A: Anything to do with metal shops, repairing things, because I had gone to technical school in\n1938 or '39, I went to a technical school. It's like where you learn a trade. So I went back into\nthe metal shops. And my sister became a runner for the offices there in the camp. And my\nfather worked in -- it was a farm, the camp had a farm. That farm was there. They had cows,\nwhere my uncles since they were cattle dealers, book care of the cows so that the\ncommandant would have milk and fresh eggs, fresh chickens, and that's what they did. They\nhad that farm there for the benefit of the guards and the commandant.",
        "A: My mother had to go to a place where they were doing some sewing 1n the hospital. There\nwas a hospital in the camp in Westerbork, and she worked there sewing. And my father\nworked most of the time in the kitchen, camp kitchen, because everyone had to go and pick\nup their food.",
        "A: She was -- well, a messenger. They used messengers to take papers or whatever. Yes, that's\nwhat she did. I remember that.",
        "A: No, we all went together. Always we were together. But they also had a barracks for young\npeople. It was civilized in comparison with what I saw later. And then they also had cubicles,\none room, two rooms, where families could live if you were staying there like we were\nstaying there. But most people came in there and stayed maybe one or two days and then\nevery Tuesday the trains went from Westerbork to Auschwitz or Sobibor. But there was a\ncaddie\u2019, my father and mother were assigned to a caddie because he worked in the kitchen so\nwe were, what they may call at that point, permanent residents, or whatever the name, it was\na different name, but at least we didn't worry in the early days of going with them on the\ntransport.",
        "A: Yes, I think so. There may have been a card, yes. But then we worked and you picked up\nyour food and at least we had dinner together every night. Then I went separate. When I\nbecame -- I was under protection of my parents age-wise until I was 15, I remember. But\nwhen my 15th birthday was past, when I was at the end of my 15th year I was on my own,\nso-called. And then I was shipped to Auschwitz alone without my parents and my sister.",
        "A: About eight, nine months.",
        "A: Oh, we all knew that it was eventually to happen. But I'm thinking by then of escape. You\ncould escape from there because the military or the guards were not as severe there as we\nsaw later. And I worked for a while in cutting peat, you know, peat, we cut peat and dry it. I\nworked with some teams there. We cut peat in the area. There, where Westerbork is, is\nknown for peat moss, peat for the stoves for heating. So I worked there and we are out in the\nfield. If one wanted to escape and you know what you were doing, you had to be disciplined\nI think.",
        "A: No, not then. Because first of all I wouldn't escape without my parents. I mean we had this\nfamily and had to stay together. And when I left there my parents wanted to go with me and I\nsaid no. I felt very mature when I was that age as a child. I remember that. I decided that I\ncould handle it. I was hoping that if I would go they could stay. But then a week or two\n\u2018Correction: cadre.\nweeks later, very shortly after that, when I was in Birchenov, they came there too.",
        "A: Yes. Actually there was a whole community of life. What I mean by that is, yes children\nwould go to school. I think my sister did go to school. I was already past that because I\nworked in the metal shops and in the fields. But they had, for instance they had a wonderful\norchestra. Then they had opera and theater. Because there was a whole element of German\nJews who had come from Berlin mostly, from the stages, intellectual community, the artists\nwho developed in Westerbork an infrastructure of some very beautiful entertainment. For me\nit was beautiful because I came from a small town and I had never been to opera before in\nmy life obviously.",
        "A: No, but they played the typical Strauss and Mozart pieces and all of the pieces which today\nwe take for granted. But they had a lot of musicians and the majority, I won't say majority,\nbut a lot of the leadership of that element were German Jews. Because they also were staying\nthere, they were the -- of the camp. And it was done for the Germans. They wanted it. It was\nalso done because it saved their lives and so they would stay longer. And then of course the\npeople who were in the camp could go in the evenings after the Germans had gotten their\nshare of it. The ones who had no freedom in the camps, there was a camp within the camp,\nwere Jews who were caught who were hidden. And when they caught them they came into\nthe camp and they were within a camp in the camp of Sobibor. They had no freedom at all.\nThey could only stay in the barracks waiting for the next transport to leave for Auschwitz.\nThe irony was that they thought they were punished more. We all got in the same train. But\nthere was again this orchestration of fear, and of total planning.",
        "A: Yes, in Westerbork you could read. There was -- somewhere I remember reading. I used to\nread a lot when I was a child.",
        "A: No, I had friends. I had friends, but I like to read. I remember when we were in Borquelo, we\nused to go every Friday afternoon to the public library and picked up half a dozen books, my\nfriend and I, and we read. Sometimes even books I shouldn't have been reading in those days\nat that age. But we read a lot and we had good guidance because they had good librarians. So\nwe traded books before we had to take them back the following week, so we did do a lot of\nreading. In the camp there were some books because the camp was started before the\nGermans got there. The camp was started in 1939 about.",
        "A: Yes, it was clean. Hygiene was good. There wasn't any problem with hygiene that I\nremember. It was clean.",
        "A: Not really, not really, no. The difference was the ones who were caught in hiding, they were\ntreated very badly. They didn't get as much food as we did for instance either. There was a\npunishment there to make us understand that there was a wrong thing they had done. And\nalso probably --I think to send messages.",
        "A: In Westerbork, yes. She was with us in Westerbork. And she went to Theresienstadt after I\nhad left. My grandfather was also with us, and he left I think, if I remember correctly, shortly\nbefore I did on the transport by himself. He went to Sobibor I found out in recent years\nlooking at lists. Excuse me.",
        "A: I did not find out at all. I only find out I have to go on the train, and I never heard the name\nAuschwitz. I found out when the train stopped and we got out of the boxcars in Birkenau.",
        "A: Okay.\nTape #2",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I don't remember the day, but I know I had to say goodbye to my parents and my sister, my\nuncles. Went 1n a boxcar.",
        "A: I don't remember. I don't remember. I know I remember we said if we survive we all go back\nto Botula. I mean that's one thing we always had agreed on. But obviously it was emotional.\nBut I must say as a 15 year old, 16 year old it's one thing, but I think more and more about\nwhat it had to do to my mother and my father. It had to be absolutely the worst.",
        "A: I don't think so. I don't think so because it was adventuresome to some extent. Maybe that's\nnot a proper word, but the fear, you were under this terrible fear and now it was already\nseveral years for me, a lifetime at that point, that we lived under this. So I don't remember\nwhat my feelings were. I have no idea. But I think about it since I am a father and a\ngrandfather, that it had to tear my parents apart, their hearts. It had to be unreal. I don't think\nwhat can describe that. That makes me sad. But in the boxcar it so happened that the girl I\nused to know, not dating, but friend, a good friend I went to school with, he was in the same\nboxcar. She was also by herself. And we sat together all the way from Westerbork to\nAuschwitz. And that's about all I remember.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: Yes, indeed. The camp was -- you lived a life there, whatever that means. I don't know if\nthere was a movie there, I don't remember that, but it was -- I know we were talking about\nthe entertainment they had there. They had a large auditorium, I remember that. And\nevenings there were intellectual, there were lectures there.",
        "A: Yes, I did date. We didn't have many places to assemble or to be alone with a person, but it\nwas just the idea of having a friend. Yes, of course.",
        "A: It was urgent to the extent that you clung to each other because there was obviously a terrible\nloneliness in each person, and a terrible fear. But I do remember that the friendships in the\ncamp in dating, that you just mentioned as dating, friendships were very very deep and very\nsincere. I didn't have anybody that I said I'm going to marry you, it wasn't even important in\nlife to even think that, but as friendships either from before we were there or we met there\nand found friendships there, new friends, and you saw that among others. And then there\nwere movements, there was a whole movement in the camp of Halutsim\u2019...Zionist movement\nwho met regular. Who had only one dream, they all would go together to Israel and they stay\ntogether. They all left together too, they all went to Auschwitz or the other camps. So there\nwas this Zionist movement, there was a cultural life for us to the extent, self-created, self-\ncreated.",
        "A: And the Zionist group, Halutsim, we called ourselves the Halutsim which 1s still used, but it\nwas a youth group, yes. I was younger than some of those kids, but I felt very privileged to\nbe among the bigger kids you see. And the girls, we call in America dating, but that dating\nwas a little different, but the friendships and the discussions and holding hands.",
        "A: I wouldn't say it was the first one, but pretty close. No, yes, no, I don't know how to answer\nthat because I don't remember the details of 1t. I do remember certain things which are not\nimportant, in general it's not a matter of seriousness, it's just teenagers, you know.",
        "A: Well, we were frightened. There was only so much our parents could do for you. They had\ntheir own problems, they had their own fears and heartbreak. So when you were with your\nown age group, especially girls, and I remember a few of them, we were frightened to death,\nand it was important that you had that emotional friendship. I'm not talking about sex per se,\nwe were too young for that, but there was certainly at the age in those days when you were\n15 and 16 it was a friendship where you could hold hands and embrace each other. How do\nwe know about kissing? Well, you kissed your parents and your sister, but not that emotion\n\u201cPossibly referring to the He-Haluts (Hebrew: \"The Pioneer\"),a Zionist youth group.\nthat we would think of today under the modern so-called post-war society thing in this\ncountry. No, it was just this deep friendship and affections. And I think they were important.\nOf course the last time I held a girl's hand was in the boxcar for a long time because --",
        "A: This friend, yes.",
        "A: I don't remember her name. I know we went to the Jewish school together, I told you about,\nand I don't remember her name. I remember her face. But I remember the person because we\nwere in the same boxcar.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, I would think so. I'm sure it did because it's got to help a little. And of course we were\nseparated when we got out of the boxcar.",
        "A: I don't remember anything about that. I know they opened it once for air. We didn't get food.\nApparently we took food I think. I don't remember how long it took, but I remember that\nsomeone said we are going past Berlin or the bombing building. And we heard bombs drop.\nThat's about all I remember. I remember very little.",
        "A: Well, obviously the human, there were no toilets so whatever happened I'm sure. But no one\ndied on that trip. Subsequent of course I have other stories to tell you. But on that trip no one\ndied that I knew of in our boxcar at least. Maybe in others older people. And there's very\nlittle that I remember.",
        "A: A variety, older people, younger people, babies, you name it, all of us. The ones who were in\nthat camp within the camp in Westerbork, they had separate boxcars again for reasons that\nonly the Germans will know. Just to have more fear than fear, create more fear than fear.\nThey weren't with us. We never saw them. And them some of them, one particular family,\nthis boy was my closest friend from the day I came to Holland until they went in hiding, he\nwas in that group. They were found, they were in hiding. No one survived in that entire\nfamily of many people, 30, 40, 50 people. That entire family was hidden somewhere. No one\nsurvived, no one. So I remember he was in Westerbork. I saw him through the barbed wire.\nWe couldn't talk to each other, just wave to each other. I couldn't even send him food. That I\nremember.",
        "A: I don't know. I know it was in the late spring of '43, somewhere. I don't remember exactly\nwhen. And I remember the enormous screaming, screaming from the outside of get out, get\nout. And instructions where to put your luggage, so-called. We had to leave it right outside\nthe boxcar in a big heap. That's all. You were not allowed to take anything. And then I\nremember, what I remember vividly, we were marked, the men on one side, women on the\nother side, and I remember standing in front of --and I know that my mother had put double\nshirts on me, double sweater, everything was double to make sure and I looked quite heavy\nand was well fed. And I know men were putting this stick out to me and he said \"Wie alt?\",\nhow old. And for reasons I have never been able to say, I said \"achtzehn,\" 18. Now, why, I\nthink only God helped me at that moment because one thing I always wanted to be older. I\nalways wanted to be with older people, more mature people. So I said 18, achtzehn, and he\nused the stick and told me to go this aisle. I forget which side, I think to the left. And then I\nsaw other people going to the right, and I was very almost annoyed with myself that I had\nlied, because if I had told the truth maybe, I thought I was almost punished because I saw the\nothers going on the trucks and I know we had to march because I figured if they go on trucks\nand we have to march so I thought gee, why did I not tell the truth, I would have been able to\ngo on trucks. God knows how far we have to march. But obviously as you all know the ones\non the trucks went directly to the crematorium. And we went from there, we marched to, just\na very short march, I'm sure, to the camp where we then were undressed --",
        "A: No, I don't remember screaming. The only screaming I remember was from the guards and\nthe prisoners who had to get us out of the boxcars, because it was a matter of you didn't\nwalk, you ran. You had to be fast, fast, fast, schnell, schnell, schnell, heraus, heraus, heraus,\nschnell, schnell, schnell. We didn't know why. Today I know why, there were boxcars\nwaiting to be unloaded. But it was always whatever you do, schnell, schnell, and heraus,\nheraus, heraus. That I remember. And we didn't have a chance, I didn't at least, have any\nchance to talk to those prisoners who were assigned to that command to do that work. And of\ncourse language was another problem. We were from Holland, the majority spoke Dutch,\nand we would speak German. No one spoke Yiddish. In Holland Yiddish was not known. I\nnever knew Yiddish until I got into camp. So, yes, it was a rush act, schnell, schnell, schnell.",
        "A: I don't know. Shortly after that. Malach-Ha-Mawies, the angel of death. I remember when\nthey talked about the Malach-Ha-Mawies when we got to talk to some other prisoners. And I\nmet a family friend there, which probably was my best -- that was probably my most\nimportant moment to survive. There were a couple of others, but when we left the\nUmschlagplatz where we got out of the boxcars we were taking into a barracks. I remember\nwe were stark naked. Men only. And they were tattooing us. I remember that. And a boy, a\nman, a cousin came up to me and he recognized me. And he was on the first transport which\nhad left Holland to Auschwitz. There were only one or two alive on that transport, and these\nwere young people. The first group out of Holland were young people. The biggest part was\nan orphanage of German Jewish boys and girls, but I think there was only boys that I knew, I\nremember. And they took all those boys, they went in the Jewish orphanage in Holland and\nthey emptied that orphanage. They were not orphans, they were orphans in Holland, they\nwere children that the parents had sent to Holland through some arrangement. And he was\nfrom Dortmund. His name was Hans Gelpter. He's still alive, thank God. He's a doctor, and\nhe's now in Africa. And he knew me, and we knew, we had a lot of mutual friends, and he\nknew my family and I knew his family, only by name. But he knew more about my parents,\nthere was an apparent friendship there or something or acquaintance. He knew my uncles.\nHe had also been at Westerbork. And said a few things to me, what to do and what not to do,\nI remember that. But I felt that I saw someone I knew which had a calming effect. And he\nalso told me that this the first -- the reason he came there, he had the freedom of the camp\nbecause he was one of the early ones. The end of '41 I think they took him, or very early .42.\nBut for six months there had never been a transport kept alive of Jews. This was the first one,\nhe told me. That's why he was so anxious to see who was there since he was amazed that\nthey kept this one alive too. He saw all the previous ones, and they were weekly, every\nTuesday they left Holland and crossed the border. So we talked and he said I'll come and\nvisit you, I know where you're going to be. Because he worked and he was very handy, he\ncould fix typewriters or sewing machine, he could do anything, and he still can. He's also a\nmagician. That saved his life. And he was very good to me by telling me what to do and\nwhat not to do. And we would go to Warsaw together and also to Dachau. So he was my big\nbrother, so-called. He was protective.",
        "A: About that hour at that point.",
        "A: I have no idea. I mean the fear was so enormous that they grabbed your arm and just boom,\nboom, boom, boom, boom and you had a number on. And I don't remember, I don't\nremember if it hurt or if it didn't hurt. I have no idea.",
        "A: Yes, shaved. We were bewildered, you know. I mean it's hard to describe. And from there\nwe went to the barracks and we went through the sauna.",
        "A: Well, it's just a shower, and they use some chemicals for delousing, they called it, and they\nput it on the arms and between your legs. And we all looked alike at that point, we were all\nbald, and we got clothes. We were given clothing, a striped uniform with a pair of galoshes,\nwhat we called wooden shoes with canvas on top, and that was it.",
        "A: And a hat, indeed.",
        "A: Oh, yes. That seemed to be very important for whatever reason. Whatever, it was used for\nanother item of \"Miitzen auf or Miitzen ab\"\u201d and you went through the gate with the music. I\nremember, the next thing I remember we got into the barracks and the way the sleeping\narrangements, you know, the bunks where they pack you in, and the toilet facilities in the\nbarracks which was just a big barrel. And the food distribution where they got -- you know,\nyou got a bowl and they gave you some soup.",
        "A: No, I remember in Birkenau you had to share it with two people to one and three people to\none. Whoever could get the biggest gulp out, he got the most before he --",
        "A: 145382.",
        "A: I ran into somebody in France just recently on the trip we took with Army and for some\nreason we were talking and this man had a number very close, as close as I've ever seen, he\n*German: literally, \"Hats off, hats on.\" Accompanied by gesture of removing and replacing a hat.\ngot there the same day from Drancy, and we were about maybe a hundred numbers apart. I\nnever seen one that close. I've had a tough time. It was so heavy, the transports were coming\nin so fast, so many in that particular period that some of my friends have just ID cards, some\ncard system there in Birkenau, they don't even have one on me. I've sent one to the Germans,\nit was a German place somewhere I was told, in Bavaria I think and they're still researching\nit. But they told me that there was a period of a month or two that they couldn't keep up with\nthe administration of it. And they told me that yes these numbers were there, we know that,\nbut we are at a loss, we couldn't keep up with registering the Jew numbers.",
        "A: Wooden slab, sand floors I remember. The rows and rows and rows of bunks. And there\nwere beatings already right away.",
        "A: The Germans, the guards, and the kapos.",
        "A: Well, the Kapos were German fellow prisoners, Christians not Jews, who were in the\nGerman prisons for anything from car theft to bank thefts to homosexuals of course, a lot of\nthem. A lot of those German Kapos were homosexuals. And so were the barracks elderly.\u201d\nAnd I remember very distinctly that the barracks elderly he went and asked everybody where\nthey were from and who could speak German. I was one of the very few who spoke German.\nAnd then he asked me where are your folks, and I told him, and he was from the same area\nthat I was from in Germany. He knew the town very well. And since I spoke German he\nused to ask me every so often explain that. Not all Dutch spoke German in those days. Now,\nthey speak more languages because of communication, etcetera and open borders. So he\nevery so often used to give me a piece of bread also. He was a German federal prisoner. He\nwas in the German Gefingnis\u201d but he was a kapo. He never hit me, that one, the barracks\nelderly. The others it was different and the work teams, and so he used to take pity on me.\nBecause he slept separately. There was a section where this orderly slept with a wall around\nit. And he used to give me every so often a piece of bread. And then of course I saw my\nfriend as often as we could sneak or when there was freedom a little bit. He could walk\naround the camp a little bit more than anybody else because he was there for a long time.\nAnd one time he worked also in the Schreibstube, where they do all this--\n*Blockiiltester.\nGerman: prison.",
        "A: It's what they call in the Army the office part of the camp. He worked there for a while\nbecause he typed. My friend Hans was a very talented person, and still is. And then we went\nout -- working on the railroad, on the street gangs, on the street, digging in the street and\nrepairing the street, working on the streets working near the crematorium. I remember that.",
        "A: You had to go through the gate marching, and you have to take your hats off and you have to\nlook, you know, to the band and they counted, and it was right outside the camp where we\nworked on the work gangs. I did not go to Buna.\u2019 I stayed right in Birkenau.",
        "A: No, no, 1t was just every hundred, you know. They count a hundred. And then of course the\nworst part was this punishment on Sundays. Sundays, you know, they had to check\neverybody that could work on Monday again, but they kept us standing outside for hours and\nhours and hours, six hours, eight hours. People dropped like flies. And you just didn't stand,\nyou had to do it in a squat position with your hands out. Everything was done to degrade you\nmore and punish you more.\nAnd after a while I was run over by a lorry and I wasn't in too good a shape, but I was managing.\nAnd I was hiding after that with my legs cut. And I was beaten a few times on my back. I still have\nsome scars there. But my friend came to me and he says I'm going to get out of here, you go with\nme, there is a transport leaving. I don't know how long I was in Birchenov exactly, 1t wasn't maybe\nthree months at the most, and it could be even shorter. We were in a daze, we didn't know if it was\nnight or day. There was just this fear, this schnell, schnell, schnell, and no food, and the hunger and\nthe beatings and the screamings at night. He says I am going on this transport unknown. They're\nputting together 300 names and you're going on it with me. I said whatever you say. What did I\nknow, I was a kid and I trusted him because he was older and he was already seasoned, so-called.\nAnd he says I volunteered you, we are going on this transport now. He says the worst that can\nhappen we'll get killed this week rather than next month. With some kind of luck we'll get out of\nhere. We'll never survive here. There is no chance that anybody gets out of here. That we all knew.\nWe were told that no one gets out of Auschwitz and Birkenau. That we know. It's just a matter of\ntime how long. And we knew that the commanders who worked in the gas chambers were every 90\ndays approximately, some of them even every 30 days were killed. So they killed those teams that\nworked in the gas chambers and the crematorium. But they were given good food and then they\ndidn't realize they were going to be killed in those 90 days. And when you got sick it was automatic\n\u00b0 Auschwitz III, or Buna, was a factory for the slave loabor production of synthetics under the\naegis of the German corporation IG Farben.\nBarracks 13, for any reason. And they check you ever Sunday.",
        "A: That was the last station before you went to the crematorium. That's where they assembled\nthem. So we went into boxcars again --",
        "A: I was in a hurry to leave it.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: No. But Sunday lasted longer. During the roll call you got some tea, you know.",
        "A: Oh, it varied. Some of them were very very long. Some of them were very long. But on\nSundays it was worse, and they then made you sit in a squatting position, halfway down.\nAnd there were a lot of beatings to scare you more.",
        "A: Listen, there was no chance that you avoid that. I mean if they picked on you they picked on\nyou for whatever reason. And they found enough reasons. There were always reasons. I was\njust lucky, I didn't get beaten as much as some others. Maybe I was shorter. Who knows?",
        "A: Right away. We knew it within a day or two, maybe even sooner. Not until we got there. The\nsmell, the smell. I mean they were going, seven of them at that time and they were all around\nthe camp.",
        "A: Burned hair, burned flesh. It was -- it didn't feel normal, just the sun, the wind, you never\nsaw birds, you never saw green. I mean if there would be a green leaf ten people would jump\nfor it. | mean because everyone was terribly hungry. And so it was the smell, the stench was\njust awful. Plus the fact there was no hygiene as far as bathrooms. There was no such thing.\nThere were latrines, but there was --",
        "A: In the barracks all they had was a very large wooden barrel. And during the night I\nremember, during the night to used to, whoever was in charge of the night shift, I don't know\nif they call them guards, but they were assigned there to stay up during the night to empty\nthat. They used to wake you up with a stick, hit you over the legs or whatever and you had to\njump out of your bunk and carry this thing down the street. I don't know far, but you can\nimagine a big -- it's like a big wine barrel, bigger than a 60 gallon barrel, even bigger, and\nyou had to carry that, three people, four people, sometimes two people. And they had to\nwatch, if you spilled it you got beaten up. If you didn't spill it you got beaten up. And it was\nso bad because some people just couldn't handle it mentally or physically, they were too\nweak. And I remember once, the first or second night in there, there were two brothers that\nwere Dutch, they couldn't speak German. I remember this distinctly. And they beat one\nbrother to a pulp, he couldn't carry it, so they just beat him to a pulp. And his other bother\nwas watching. So it was one after the other, it wasn't a matter of a single issue, it was hourly.\nIt never stopped, it never never stopped. Did it get better? No. Did it get worse? Yes. And\nthat's why when I said we were convinced we would never get out of here. But then there 1s\nsomething about the human being that you always have hope. Because the ones who didn't\nhave hope they disintegrated real fast. And for some reason I didn't. I always had hope. But a\nlot of people just --",
        "A: I don't know.",
        "A: Well, yes, I was very religious. We were very conservative. We went to Temple, to\nsynagogue. We had kosher food at home. We fasted whenever the Jewish holidays dictated\nthat. And we prayed after dinner. And we prayed at night when we went to bed. My father\ndid not light the fire, my grandfather did. Not my father anymore, I learned it at bar mitzvah\ntime. But most of the time I had to, for a while. But that doesn't mean whether or not my\ngrandfather read the Torah on Shabbas. And my grandfather's brother was the ;\ndid the kosher slaughtering. It was a small community, this is back to Germany. So my father\nwas the alternate with his cousin, president or vice president of the congregation. It was a\nsmall little building they had. So we had a very religious life. And in Holland even much\nmore so. The town we lived in was very religious. We went to -- every night, Temple. We\nwent most morning and on any holiday mentioned in our religion, it was an event. Plus we\nstudied Gomorrah and Rashi. I used to be able to read that. And we studied Mishna. So I've\ndone all that from when I was about ten until I was arrested, those years. And it was very\nserious and most pleasant. And every day we had Hebrew school after the public school,\nevery day, including Sundays. So it was a wonderful life -- we have everything. And they\nhad social events all the time, literary evenings, and that's usually when they brought in\nspeakers. And my father was always kind of the master of ceremonies. He was a really\nentertaining, and he played music. So there was a whole wonderful life for us especially in\nHolland. But going back to Auschwitz, it wasn't an event that is even where you can call it\nhuman. It was at the other end of anything you can imagine. The beatings, the devastation of\nthe people, you could see it, and the loss of everything. And then I worked in the work gangs\nand we saw them going into the gas chambers. A lot of them didn't know. The majority\ndidn't know when they came right up the railroads in boxcars. They didn't know. We knew.\nWe didn't tell them, what's the use. And the work gangs, we were right there. The gathering,\nwe were supposed to be gathering the -- on the crematorium. But you did what you had to\ndo.",
        "A: No, not that close. And if you did talk to them they beat the hell out of you. I mean it wasn't a\nmatter of -- as an example when a guard threw a cigarette away, if you picked that cigarette\nup and you were caught you were dead. You didn't go near the towers because, you know,\nthey used to throw cigarettes out of the tower. The newcomers didn't realize, they went for\nthe cigarette butt and they never made it back.",
        "A: They killed them, they shot them because they said well you're escaping, escaping. These\nthings you learn. That's when I said friend taught me a lot of things real fast. I had the fastest\ncollege education in about a day or a day and a half. Those things are pure luck.",
        "A: A lot.",
        "A: I remembered the Shabbas. Yes. And I still do. And I take deep pride I think that I don't\nknow any Jew who went through this, I don't know one, not that they are religious, but I\ndon't know any Jew that I know personally who went through that who converted. And that\ngives me deep pride. Now, do we have a reason to convert or just drop the whole thing? Yes\nwe do, yes we do. We saw there was no God in Auschwitz. But then there was a God, for me\nthere was one.",
        "A: Really. I got out. I got out. My parents didn't. My sister didn't. But I still believe in God. I\ncouldn't function otherwise. And I don't want to be even thinking that. I do not to be a very\nreligious Jew, not particularly. I got to Temple and I keep the holidays and I fast and I don't\neat pork. But that 1s maybe because it's maybe a different world today. If I were living in a\ncertain area where this was more handy for me or I could find less excuses, I would like to\nlive that way, I would like to spend more time studying the Torah and , 1 just\ndon't have that. I don't live in that -- which is only a cop-out on my part. I understand it fully.\nBut I'm still dreaming that some day I'll have the time to do that. So I have deep pride that\nmy kind of Jews who were int eh camps with me stayed Jews. And there must be exceptions\nI'm sure. There may be. But this is an important thing that I can think of. The same thing I\nbelieve, the deepest pride I have, I have -- and we were liberated -- the towns around the\ncamp. And I will tell you and I have double checked there with my colleagues, there wasn't a\nGerman killed by a Jew who was a prisoner. We took their food and we took their clothing\nbecause we needed it. We didn't beat him up and we didn't kill him. And I think that that\ngives me probably more pride as a Jew than anything that I can think of. That we had seen\nthe killings and we shouldn't have been killers. There wasn't a German killed by a survivor,\nthe Jewish survivors, because we didn't want to live like they lived with what they had done.\nAnd we didn't stoop down to the levels that we had seen humanity, but we wanted to get out\nof there the faster the better. That I will tell people as often as they ask me. There was no\nGerman killed by Jews after the war.",
        "A: There wasn't an intimate relationship. First of all we didn't know each other. We were all\nthrown together. I didn't know -- I don't think I knew anybody. Maybe one or two, maybe.\nBut that doesn't mean we were in the same bunk together. And if you weren't in the same\nbunk together you had no time to do anything else. So there was very little social\nintercommunicating, discussion, because during the day you couldn't because you were\nwatched all the time, there was no talking, and at night it was too difficult. Furthermore, it\nwas a matter of survival too. You were constantly watching over your shoulder. To the\nextent that you did receive overnight, if you got a piece of bread in the evening you'd eat it as\nfast as you could.",
        "A: Because if you kept it out they stole it. Somebody -- people were not human. I'm not saying\nthat they were thieves, they're not thieves. You ate it so there was no possibility you could\nlose it. And were that hungry anyhow. But I don't remember in those days, and maybe later\non when we get into the other camps we can talk about that, but 1t was a little different\natmosphere in some other camp I'm thinking of for the moment. There was some discussion,\nbut as far as Birkenau was concerned it was all we saw was killings and dead people and\nbeatings.",
        "A: At night they were running into the electric wires. They had the a special commander with\ncars who would go along the wires to pick up the people who run into wires. If they had the\ncourage to do it, they'd just get it over with.",
        "A: Not to go into the wires, no. Once I tempted a guard to shoot me, but it was later.",
        "A: No, not in Auschwitz. Later, I wanted to get it over with. But he didn't.",
        "A: No, it was shared. I remember you had to share it. Two people, three people, four people.",
        "A: I don't remember. But you couldn't lay on your back. That much I remember. You had to be\non one side or the other side.",
        "A: I don't remember.",
        "A: Yes, I'm sure we slept. I'm sure we slept. Because, you know, you worked during the day.\nI'm sure we slept.",
        "A: Oh, the smells, I don't remember the smells. I know there were smells. There had to be. I told\nyou about the toilet facilities. Yes, noise, screaming, people would -- I know it was bad. I\ndon't know the details. I feel that, and it took me 40 years to even talk about it, I also feel that\nI really don't want to wake up totally to remember everything. This is the first time, as you\nwell know, that I am doing this. And I lived in San Francisco all these years until I got\ninvolved in this Holocaust movement in the '70s, and I don't think anybody knew I was in the\ncamps. I don't wear short-sleeved shirts.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Because I never. And I'm not the only one. I've heard this by survivors, it's either sympathy,\nand you don't want that sympathy. You don't want to advertise it. And I also believe another\nthing, Joan, that there were a lot of survivors who was ashamed that they were alive after the\nwar. For whatever reason they survived and the rest didn't. And I think it also had to do with\nanother thing, when we came back from the war there was no one who was interested. We\nhad no one to talk to. We had no one to talk to. Now, it's a little different. But there was no\noral history project, there wasn't even a social worker. There wasn't even a friend. There\nwere no friends left. There were no parents. And everybody had problems after the Jews\ncame back from either hiding or from the camps, and everyone was trying to put their life\ntogether. And the survivors, nobody was interested in us. We made it ourselves. We had no\none. I had no one to talk to, and I know my friends didn't either. And we didn't talk to each\nother because we already talked to each other. We saw it with our own eyes how much more.\nMy friend who I told you about, my friend I saw again in Birkenau, he visits me every few\nyears. He's been here about a dozen times. He lives in Bodachia (ph) now, in Bodachia\nnow, . We never talk about this. When I bring it up sometimes just to -- he says\nnext issue. We never talk about it. So we had no one to talk to. So why advertise it.",
        "A: Hans.",
        "A: Well, in general.",
        "A: Well, I know what he was, he worked and he was at that time when I met him he was in\ncharge of about maybe a hundred people repairing sewing machines and typewriters,\nsomething like this. Because he was a mechanic who knew how to teach those people. It was\nfor the administration there. And then he also was a magician, so he had to do magic for\nthose people.",
        "A: For the Germans.",
        "A: Not at the time I got there.",
        "A: Not there, no. Here in our country, oh yes, when he put magic -- together. He's now well\nknown. He became well known after the war.",
        "A: Yes, well there were some of them the same age. Most of course were older. I don't\nremember. I don't remember anybody except Hans, my friend. And the others were all\nstrangers to me. I was thrown in with them.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, we saw through the barbed wire, yes. Well, at camp I remember a lot of people in there,\nvery heavily populated. And they had their own clothes and they were men, women and\nchildren. And I remember at night they used to play the violin. I remember that distinctly.\nThis wonderful deep staccatto and the music the gypsies played. I know someone in our area\nwho is a gypsy and I ask him to do it and they can't do it like that, not the way we heard it,\nthe way I remember it. The shadows as you know, the gypsies, the Hungarian gypsies\nespecially. So I remember that music, I remember that music. And I also remember they beat\nthem up a lot. They used to beat the gypsies a lot -- screaming, we heard the screaming. But\nthat was all over the camp. That's about all I remember. I wasn't yet long there, you see.",
        "A: To us there was no surprises. I mean it was all happening, things that we had no relationship\nto, neither did we understand it. I mean we just accepted hour by hour, day by day. I mean\nthings were moving so fast, but there was hunger and the living conditions and the beatings\nand the killings. I used to see there the camp commander, I think was (ph), I think\nit was, used to drive through the camps of Birkenau on a motorcycle with a pistol and\nwhoever was in front of him he shot.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: I don't know when I saw the first person killed. I don't remember. But I remember him doing\nthat. On a motorcycle, running through the camp, and if he saw somebody in his way he shot\nthem. And we saw in front of the gas chambers when we worked there, you saw them throw\nthe babies in the air, smash the babies against the walls when they were standing in line.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, it all was part of everything. I don't remember my emotions, because if you stopped\nworking they beat you, so you kept on working and shuffling with a shovel.",
        "A: Then?",
        "A: I don't remember. I don't know if I dream now. But I remember, I don't know, I still, and\nmaybe it's not the proper way to express it, but I have this deep down feeling that I was in a\ncoma, in a hypnosis for the entire duration of my camp life. I mean maybe it's because you\nwere so young. And probably that's what it 1s because very few older people, very older\npeople couldn't handle it. I was a child and maybe that's what gave me the benefit. Now,\ntoday I think different than I know I thought then. And only in very recent years, especially\nof the work I'm doing now even though it's voluntary, and some days I feel maybe I shouldn't\nhave gotten involved in it, but then I also feel very strong, almost overwhelmingly that we\nhave to tell this story. There was another drive I think I had and always had, everybody, to be\nable -- and I wanted it so badly, there was nothing more, than anything else that I wanted to\nget out and tell the story, and I think that drove me more than anything else.",
        "A: Yes. And I believed I was going to do that. I always believed that I was going to tell the\nstory. Because it drove me so much that how well they know -- I remember I used to hear the\nscream \"Sohor, Sohor,\" remember.",
        "A: Well, it didn't help me of creating the situation because I think the situation was created\nstrictly by accident and maybe with the help of God, but it certainly helped me to keep my\nsenses to the extent and to have not all these horrible things penetrate my mind, because I'm\ncertainly not a criminal. And what I have seen I should be a criminal. It happened to a good\nfriend of mine, a friend I had in camp, a young boy my age who came out, and we can talk\nabout it later, and became a criminal, a son of a rabbi, a Polish boy. He became a criminal in\nAmsterdam after the war.",
        "A: All right.",
        "A: That's another story.",
        "A: That's after the war. It wasn't really a nice story.",
        "A: We saw them at a distance, very distant. No, we didn't see them close. When they march by\nsometimes, but not very close by.",
        "A: Oh, yes. But we knew they were women because they had dresses rather than jackets or\npants like we had. But then they were bald. As you well know they were also shaven. But we\nknew they were there, we saw them. You couldn't talk to them. You couldn't talk to anybody\nfrom any other camp, any other compounds, so-called, what you may call compounds.",
        "A: Oh, yes. With the women, yes, women kapos. And we know they treat the women very\nbadly, very very badly, and we knew that .",
        "A: Well, we heard a lot of screaming. The screamings we knew. We heard the screamings. That\nwe knew.",
        "A: I remember, yes. He worked on the work gangs. All I remember there were work gangs in\nthe camp, outside the camp.",
        "A: Yes. I never became a Muselmann. Do you know what a Muselmann was?",
        "A: A Muselmann were really the ones which it would be unfortunate to see today on television\nwhen you see Somalia. That's how a lot of not all, most of our people looked. But if you get\nto that stage, since there was no help, that's how they ended up. And they called them\nnewswoman. I can't watch that on television I swear. I've seen a lot as you well know. When\nI see that Somalia thing, I'm ashamed to say that I cannot watch it, I have to turn my head\naway. It bothers me no end. And that's how a lot of our prisoners, all throughout the other\ncamps too.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. In Warsaw that's different. And you'll find out why in Warsaw, because the buildings\nthere they got into, but not in Birkenau, uh-uh.",
        "A: No. A lot of things are in my heart and my soul and my mind, but I don't know anything in\nparticular I can think of at this moment except that 1t was so overwhelming. People say well\nwhy didn't you do something, why didn't you escape, why wasn't -- the question isn't even\njustifiable because in Auschwitz the fear, the electric wires, the beatings, the hunger, the\nstarvation, the degradation, you know, the way you were treated, you never had time to\nthink. And then again I have to admit I'm in such a hypnosis still about that today, that now\nwhen I do remember things like chlorine, I can't stand the smell of chlorine. When I have\nchlorine in the water sometimes, especially here you Washingtonians, I can't stand your\nwater because it has a chlorine smell and it reminds me of Auschwitz and Birkenau, and all\nthe camps for that matter.",
        "A: Because they used to spread chlorine around for disinfectant and that smell was always\noverwhelming. And the burning of hair, I can't bear to smell that, for me. Or flesh because it\nreminds you of the crematoria. But you asked me have you been back to Auschwitz, I will\nnot go back. I will never go back to any camp, and I can't. I don't want to wake up. I think\nthat's what it is. I'm afraid to wake up, really wake up. And since I'm having a very good\nnormal life, and I think I can function quite well, I believe, maybe not everybody agrees with\nme, but I agree with me on that issue, I don't want that potential interference. So I want it to\nstay the way it is. That's why I've never done an oral history until now. And look how many\nyears, 48 years, right. Yes, let's leave Auschwitz, and maybe something else will come to my\nmind. But it's very deeply buried, it's very deeply buried, and let's leave it that way for the\ntime being at least.",
        "A: Yes, it's called transport unknown, something like that. And we went on that, 300 men from\nBirkenau. I believe they were all from Birkenau.",
        "A: He helped me indeed. Without him I wouldn't be around there. And how he did it I have no\nidea. And it could very well be that part of the barracks I was in, I don't know. I remember he\nsaid you must go on this. Because I asked him -- no, I didn't ask him, he told me. I said what\nshould I do, and he said you go because I'm going on it and he took me. And then we went\nback to the boxcars one day.",
        "A: No. I remember they gave us a piece of bread when we got into the boxcar. That I remember.\nI don't know why I remember that, but I remember that. Maybe I was very hungry. And then\nwe went in a boxcar. I don't know how long this trip was. It couldn't have been very long. If\nit was a day or two or one day, I don't know how long it was. I know that we ended up in a\nvery large railroad yard in the city, and then of course we found out it was Warsaw. And this\nwas in the summer of '43 I believe. I don't know the dates because we didn't know dates. The\nonly reason we knew it was Sunday in Auschwitz was because it was selection day. That's\nthe only reason we knew that. And then we were marched from the railroad yards in Warsaw\nto this bombed city, this bombed section of the city. And there were fires still going, and\nthere were many dead bodies laying in the streets and a lot of debris. And I remember there\nwere no barracks, that there were sections of barracks laying there. They marched us into the\nghetto. We found out later this was the ghetto. And we marked in, and I think the first couple\nof days we slept outside somewhere until they built this barracks, a wooden barracks. Better\nones than we had in Auschwitz I must say that.",
        "A: Yes, the prisoners had to do most of the work, but it was German supervision. There were\nforeman there who were not prisoners. But the prisoners did all of the labor. Us guys. And\nthen when we started working, and the reason we were there, we were sent there to dynamite\nthe ghetto, to destroy all the evidence, to dynamite all the buildings, to preserve as much raw\nmaterial as we could find from transformers to cable, electric wiring, copper wiring, wood.\nAnd a lot of prisoners polished bricks because those buildings, and I happen to be, for a\nreason that I don't know why, but I was on the demolition team and we had to plant\ndynamite, dynamite they called it, underneath the walls. And then the Germans handled the\nplunger, the wires. We had to set the wires. And I remember a few occasions they, for joy\nrides, they'd push the plunger before the prisoners got out and got away from the walls. I got\nhit over my legs a few times. We didn't run fast enough because we had nothing, we didn't\nhave decent shoes, and couldn't walk that fast because we were not that well fed. And that's\nwhat I did for quite a while. And then for a while I did, and another groups of maybe 30\nguys, we had to find transformers in buildings, electrical transformers, and we had to put\nthem on trucks. And that also was part of the war machine. And then I worked for quite a\nwhile in the railroad yards where the equipment was transferred to and from the eastern\nfront, the Russian front. So that was about what we did. And one day I remember -- oh, and\nmy friend Hans was my helper and sometimes I got upset with him, he once said I got a good\njob, he said I have five people going to some work detail on the other side of the waxer to a\nGerman army camp, army whatever, maybe we can get some food there because five guys\nmaybe they feed you. So he put me, and I remember, and I was reminded of it recently when\ntwo boys, two boys from Croatia, from Zagreb, they were very nice boys, you know, my age,\nand two others, and I forgot the others, I think one was a boy from Berlin, and we went there\non a truck to this army post, German army post. They were all SS troops, most of them. And\nwe dug fortifications. We have to dig trenches. And they beat us up terribly that day, just\nbeat us up terribly. And two of the boys were killed that day. One of the brothers and one\nother man. So out of the five only two walked out. So that night when I found my friend I tell\nhim don't do me any more favors. And so that was Warsaw. And then I worked in Laundry\nfor a while. And my friend he had a job of assigning detail sometimes so he was always\nhelping me, he was always helping me. And Warsaw was different because we lived in this\nghetto. A camp, about two camps they was building. And they give us one camp and then we\nbuilt a new camp. We all got to do that. So out in the big ghetto there and the first camp, and\nthen during the winter, in the spring, in January there was another camp, and 300 were\namplified by several thousand, a lot of Hungarian Jews. And at the tail end we got out of\nWarsaw, there were 3,600 prisoners there. And a lot of them died even during this period\nwhile we were there. But 3,600 and they were mostly Hungarian Jews.",
        "A: All men. No, we never saw women. The only time we saw women was when we were in\ntrucks going to some work details on the streets. In addition to that they also did a lot of\nshooting of Polish political prisoners in the ghetto in our camp and we had to burn the\ncorpses. There were a lot of corpses when we got there first. We found basements full of\ncorpses. That's a prison they had there and lots of bodies we found. We burned them. There\nwas stacks we had to build. And one day we spend a few days in the Pawiak, I don't know\nabout ten of us who got sent there for a detail, and --",
        "A: Pawiak was a fellow prison in the City of Warsaw. I don't know if it's still there. But we were\nsent there for some work detail. I remember spending there a couple of days. I remember, the\nonly thing I remember this heavy heavy stone buildings. And the fed us soup. That shows\nyou what you remember, some odd things. And it tasted like pure soap water. So I asked\nthem why is there so much soap 1n there, and the reason, this person explained, whoever it\nwas, said apparently the soap, and I'm not talking about the Jewish people, I'm talking about\nthe prisoners in this Pawiak, the reason they gave them this soap, they threw a bar of soap in\nevery soup kettle because 1t would decrease their sexual desires. Soap or whatever chemical,\nthat's what they explained to us. Because it tasted like soap, which was even delicious, better\nthan what we had in the camp. But I remember they used that. We didn't have that problem,\nthe Jewish prisoners, believe me. So Warsaw, we didn't have the hunger because we found a\nlot of food in the buildings, staples. There were still staples to be found, barley, things like\nthat.",
        "A: If you could find it and could hide it. If they caught you you were in trouble. But we also had\nother avenues, and while we were in the ghetto the Poles came in and bought the bricks, the\npolished brick, and we used to find clothes and save them bundled up and sold them the\nclothes for a piece of bread or a couple of onions or some garlic and even sometimes vodka.\nAnd they brought things with them and they thought it was our's, those Poles who came in,\nthey had this cart with a horse 1n front of it, so they brought in food, not because they liked\nus, only because it was a business deal. I didn't speak Polish, but we had Poles who could\nspeak the language. And then there were what we found also was in the early days when we\nwere in Warsaw, Jews were in the bunkers, who once had done the uprising, and they were\nstill in bunkers and they came out when the dynamiting started. And when the Germans of\ncourse saw them they shot them on site. But I remember also one day there was a boy and a\ngirl came out. The Poles had been supplying them with food. And they run out of money and\nout of gold and I saw a Pole kill this girl. He killed her because he didn't want to have her\nalive so in case she would implicate him. They weren't very nice. And they were very bad.\nAnd so they didn't help us out of any human point of view, they helped us because it served\nthem. And I remember we worked in the railroad yards and they had Germany material like\nuniforms and shoes, etcetera. And we sold and traded, not so much traded, with the Polish\nrailroad people, traded with them for food. So the hunger was not as bad in Warsaw as it had\nbeen in Birkenau.",
        "A: Well, it was more modern. I'll use those words. But they were a little better and there also\nwas heat, there was a stove there. A typical Polish stove out of stone I think they were made.\nI remember there was heat in there. Not always that we had something to burn, but there was\nenough wood laying around because of the demolition we did on those buildings, so it didn't\ncost anything to the Germans. But there is one point I want to make that just came to my\nmind. I happen to believe very strongly, and maybe that's in conclusion later on, that this\nentire issue of the Jews, Auschwitz, etcetera, the destruction of the six million of our people\nwas a very large money-making event for the Germans. That served and financed the biggest\npart of the war industry. Because a few realize how much we were told what to bring. You\nrealized that every person who went through Birkenau that I know of, and other camps I'm\nsure the same, and all the gas and all the crematoriums in the different camps, they looked in\nyour mouth and if you had gold fillings -- had rings, my mother had a wedding ring and my\nfather had a wedding band, so did everyone else who were married couples, there was\nenormous hordes of gold. And I remember one day in Warsaw I found in a house, someone\nhad found, and we had four diamonds, four diamond stones. Was worth about, maybe 5-6\ncarats of diamond. I didn't know anything about that, but somebody said it's a very good\namount. I sold it for a little piece of bread to a Hungarian because he only got there three\ndays before. He thought he made a big purchase. Well, I had the bread and I lived and he had\nno bread that day or for two days, so he didn't get anything for two days. So there was so\nmuch, I mean dollar bills, gold laying on the streets, silver. But the wealth of just the clothing\nalone, you'll see the lists that we have at our museum, and the valuable things just pulled out\nof that ghetto, and that's done in many places, that financed the Germans. It was a money\nmaking event for the Germans. It was a money making event. Aside from they hated the\nJews and wanted them all killed, but they made money on the deal. The clothing, the hair\nwas sold all over the world, recycled in some form.",
        "A: We, we were working in all these buildings, while we were working there were some mirrors\nthere and you saw.",
        "A: No. You didn't have much time for that. It didn't make any difference. It didn't make any\ndifference. What did a mirror mean to us, what did a piece of gold mean to us. Gold had\nnothing to do with it. There was no one to sell it to or give it too. It was almost laying on the\nstreets. It had no value, what could you do with it? If you couldn't get food with it, it doesn't\nmean a damn. So that taught me, and I've said it often to younger people, that wealth is only\ngood if you buy a very fancy painting, it's only good if you can enjoy it and look at this\npainting. But what happens if you need to sell it and there is no one to buy it, then whatever\nyou paid for this write it off real fast. It has no value if you can't sell it, if there's no buyer.\nAnd that's what happened when I had those four pieces of diamonds in my hand. I had one\nbuyer and he didn't survive because he gave me his bread. He was dumb enough to do it, but\nI was at that point seasoned, and I don't want to say smart, certainly seasoned that I knew I\ncouldn't do anything with the diamonds except I needed a greenhorn to sell it to because I\nwas hungry.",
        "A: No comparison. Much much easier. It was easier. But we were under the treat of being killed\nby selection. We died because there was typhoid in Warsaw by the way, and I had typhoid,\nbut a very mild case, and I wasn't in the Krankenbau, in the hospital so-called. But I got out\nnot very much before when the Russians broke through and got out. But I was in there for a\nwhile, not long. And many died because there was typhoid in there. That's why they kept\nshin the camp. There were 3,600 left at that point. And I think at one time there was probably\nclose to 5,000 there. The camps replenished. That number is -- but I know it was more than\n3,600. And he was told to kill them all. And I'm told, and this 1s all hearsay, that the Polish\nunderground who was watching the camp very much so because they used to take, the Polish\nResistance --brought them in the ghetto and shut them in there with us -- on one wall there\nand we had to turn them then. The Polish underground allegedly told the Germans that if you\nkill all these people you'll never get out yourself, I'm told, because it was not difficult for\nthem to do. And we heard the rumblings of the big guns that was here already because the\nRussians were breaking through. So one morning they had 300 in the beds still, who couldn't\nget out of the bed. They shot them. 300, correct. And 300 were kept there. And the reason I\nknow is because a fellow I was friendly with because he was my age, was a Berlin Jew, and\nhe was selected to be and he had to stay there, that 300. And those 300 were kept\nthere to destroy all evidence, and they were killed. That we were told later on. I don't know\nhow I know, but I know. And because they were killed while we were marching out already,\nthey just burned the barracks or dynamited. It was done very very fast. And 3,000 marched\nout, and we marched and we marched and I remember two things very distinctly. Number\none, that you tried not to be in the back because we heard the machine guns going constantly\nand we were told that anybody who drops out is going to be killed. And they left their\ncorpses right on the road. So they had maybe four or five machine guns in the back of some\narmy truck and they shot those people. All men, there were no women there. They were all\nmen. And we marched and here 1s the thing I remember as much as anything else, we came,\nit was in the summer, it was very hot, no water, and for some reason it rained once and we\nwere going like this with our soup pan and we tried to catch the raindrops. We were very\nvery thirsty, almost to the point of sanity. People were going insane, people were drinking\ntheir urine. And all of a sudden we came over on a bridge, and over the bridge we saw a\nriver. And they took us over the bridge and there was a huge field there, an open field and we\nwent in that field apparently to stay overnight, but to wait for something. And we pushed, the\nmasses pushed so hard, and I happened to be in the earlier part of this grouping of 3,000. Of\ncourse it was not 3,000 anymore, but I was in the first, maybe the second hundred or third\nhundred, very up front. We got into this river, you could wade into the river and we drank\nand we drank and we drank. But the masses in back of us were so anxious to get to that\nwater they kept on pushing and they pushed us too far in the river so we couldn't walk, and\nthey wouldn't stop. And the Germans didn't know what to do, so they thought that we would\ngo in the river and get to the other side and escape. So they start shooting from the bridge\nand from the other side. They used machine guns. They shot. And I remember, because I\nwake up often, that river turned as red as blood. And the Jews wouldn't stop. Our people\nwould not stop. They kept on pushing from the back. And they couldn't stop the Jew and\nthese people. On the German side, they kept killing with bullets and they brought the dogs\nin. And the people in charge made those soldiers, those German SS go in the water with the\ndogs and when the dogs got into the water the Jews stopped. They wouldn't stop for the\nbullets. That I remember. And then they stopped pushing. I was out by then. Because, you\nknow, I got out because they pushed and it came up to here in the water so I got out. None of\nus could swim. I don't know how many could swim. I know I couldn't swim. I told you I\ncouldn't go to the swim because I was a Jew. They never taught me how to swim. So the soil\nwas just bodies and blood, and I could only think about why they called it the Red Sea.\nThere's no connection there, but it was red as pure blood. And they killed a lot. They killed,\nin my estimation, at least 1,000 people there, maybe more. No one knows. But there were\nvery few who got into the trains. And I don't remember if we walked much more, but in the\nend we got in boxcars. I know the town, that much I remember, Zychlin. That much I\nremember. Because you could see the names on there, and I remember Zychlin, so I knew\nthat we had marched due west from Warsaw and then we start trip in boxcars again.",
        "A: We back in boxcars for quite a while, I remember. And there was no water and no food. I\nremember that. But I know we used the dead bodies to sit for seats or benches alongside.\nAnd I remember that --",
        "A: And then --",
        "A: That was, yes. That was the last time I was in a boxcar. And I remember when they opened\nthe doors it was Dachau, and very few got out of the trains. I believe only maybe 200, 300,\n400 at the most.\n[Technical conversation]",
        "A: After we went through that river, I don't know how much time there was, not much time\nuntil we were back in boxcars in Zychlin. I know that's where we started this trip. We were\nin the boxcars and for how long I don't remember. I know a lot of people died en route\nbecause we had no food and no water after we had gotten out of the water that day in the\nriver. But no food. And we ended up in Dachau. That much I know. We were in Dachau.\nAnd I think we were only in Dachau for maybe a day or two or less and we went to Allach,\nwhich is a side camp to Dachau. We ended up there. No, pardon me. We went to Dachau,\nI'm too early, to Dachau, and I don't know where we were in Dachau, but I know that about\n200 to 300 only got out of the boxcars. We sat on the corpses.",
        "A: Well, because there was these people, first of all they were in very bad shape when we got\nstarted on this death march, then that river episode. We had drank too much water without\nfood and there was dysentery, what do you all it, dysentery, right?",
        "A: Dysentery. So everything there was just horrible. And they died. Some were delirious. And\nwhen we got out we were in Dachau. And we didn't stay there too long. And in Dachau, I\ndon't know how, but I think we went in boxcars again, but I'm not too sure. It could have\nbeen trucks. I think it was trucks. I remember that. We were taken out of Dachau again and\nwe were taken to Landsberg area, Kaufering area, and there were a lot of small camps. We\nwere in a camp and there were other people there already and we were thrown in with them.\nI don't know how many. I think there were maybe 1,000, 1,500 people in this camp. They\nwere barracks. They were put on top of --they dug a hole and put a V, two roofs, I can't think\nof the name right now, but you had to step down. You sat down there on the ground. And we\nwere in there for quite a while, from '44 until -- we worked in various things. The biggest\nwork they did was digging underground munitions factories. What the Germans did, they\nbuilt those V2, it's V2 things they were building out there, but we were building the\nbuildings for that. And they used us prisoners, thousands of prisoners, to build a mountain, a\nmountain of dirt and sand and gravel, and when the mountain was high enough, maybe 40,\n50 foot high, they carried over the wooden pallets and wheelbarrows and then they poured\ncement on top of it and then they washed it out. So they built a building reversing the trench,\nsee.",
        "A: Yes. I worked there to carry dirt up these planks, you walked up and you dumped it and you\ngot more. So you had this hugh mountain. And then they put lots of cement around it. I don't\nknow, I didn't know much about construction, at least not what I know today. And that was\nused for the V2 rocket engines up there on the buildings. We lost of lot of people there\nbecause there was typhoid again. The food was very mediocre of very bad. There were lots\nof beatings but not as much as we had seen in previous camps. Everything was bad. And the\nattrition was very very high. But there bodies weren't burned. They were taken to a site in\nmass graves, hugh mass graves. I don't think they have ever been found. I wouldn't be able to\nfind them. They were huge mass graves. It's not very far from the Landsberg prisons where\nHitler had been. It's very close by there. But huge mass graves. And it was so bad that we\nhad a lot of suicides there. People were going into the electric wires. And I remember that's\nthe only time I ever saw cannibalism. There was so little food in '45 there in January and\nFebruary and March that we saw that they were cannibalizing the bodies and people were\neating it.",
        "A: No. No, I never was tempted. I wasn't that bad off. I was bad off, but not that bad off yet. But\nI have seen it. You saw it. And the Germans caught those people and they killed them. So\neither they were dead or they went into electric wires.",
        "A: Yes. Except it was smaller than the other camps we had been in. There must have been\nmaybe a dozen of them out there in the area. There were a lot of them. It was Muhldorf and\nKaufering and Landsberg, and the names just --",
        "A: Roll call, the same thing. The same thing and work, work, work, and no food and there was\ntyphoid around and it was --",
        "A: Always the same. All the same uniforms, yes.",
        "A: Well, I don't know how we got -- we may have given them when they were torn and you got\nothers, but we always had those stripers. And I remember it got very cold in '44 and '45\nbecause it's in Bavaria. And that took a lot of lives.",
        "A: Yes. If you could, but you had to show them -- there were inspections too, so if you were\ncaught, if you were caught anywhere with more than what you were supposed to have you'd\nwish you hadn't done it. They killed you or beat you. Then there were many days when the\npeople did escape or tried, and they caught them all. I've never seen anybody that I know of\nwho got out. And when they caught them, they had latches and they had this bench you had\nto bend over like a table, and lots of hangings, lots of hangings. As you may notice I haven't\ngotten into any of the gory things about brothers had to hang brothers if they knew it, and\nlots of beatings right in front of the prisoners when there was roll call. Daily almost. Findings\nways to keep your mind -- a lot of beatings, a lot of hangings. Not so much shootings.\nShooting was only when they started running. And they tempted you constantly by throwing\na cigarette butt out and if you were dumb enough to run after that you were dead. But lots of\nhangings. And then they brought in next to us a camp with women, with 30, 40 women. And\nthey used them to do their kitchen work and I think administration. And they have used these\nwomen.",
        "A: They used them as prostitutes. They are mostly -- they were Czech, some Hungarians and\nsome -- Jewish girls, all young. They killed them at the tail end.",
        "A: We saw it.",
        "A: They were right parallel to our camp.",
        "A: No, we did not, but we knew it. At night we used to sometimes be able to talk over the wire a\nlittle bit. It was very dangerous to do it. But one of our buddies was an electrician, was the\ncamp electrician, he was from Berlin, and he used to arrange there was a short sometimes so\nwe could toss some food to the girls.",
        "A: Then they would tell the stories. And in the kitchen, you know, they did work in the kitchen\nso we had contact with them.",
        "A: Yes, well, there's nothing shocking that we saw. Then I worked -- from there I worked on the\nrailroad yards in the town. I think it was Kaufering, I'm almost sure on the railroad yards\nthere, to do the loading and unloading. And there was one guard he said to me, he found out\nI spoke German, and he gave me, he says I want you to listen to this, he says, if it gets very\ndifficult to go and take off and go to this address. Which on the surface sounds very\nbenevolent and I should have maybe done that, but I didn't trust him. So I said \"Danke\nschon.\" I thanked him. I didn't take that chance. We were so mentally programmed that we\ncouldn't trust them. I couldn't true. And this may have been a sincere person, I don't know. I\nsaw him every day at the railroad cars where I worked and he said that to me. Because he\nasked, he said does anybody here speak German, so I put my hand up. And after maybe a\ncouple of weeks he saw the same face and I saw the same face and he said that to me. I didn't\ntrust him, I didn't do it. I wish I had done it a few weeks later when we were on another death\nmarch.",
        "A: From that camp back to Dachau. It was in the last week of April. We marked and we\nmarched and we marched and a lot of boys got killed. And then one night they had us on\nsome farm I think 1t was, and the Germans, part of their troops had already deserted, the\nGermans, and they were scared for us, but we didn't know that, but in retrospect I can figure\nthis. They said to us, look you all behave now, everything is fine, we are instructed to take\nyou to near the Swiss border. We had no idea where we were. We are near the Swiss border\nand we are taking you by orders of the International Red Cross over the Swiss border\ntomorrow morning. And I remember that night when they told us that, we all started crying\nof joy. We were free. They told us you are free. I remember distinctly, very distinctly, you\nare free but don't run away because you'll be better off if you stay with us because you are\ngoing to Switzerland. To us this was of course the beginning of a new life. And we stood\nthere and cried. I remember that. And especially one friend who was from Brussels. By that\ntime I had made some friends. We had been together for a long time. We stood there and\ncried and cried. And then morning came and we started marching believing we were going\nto the Swiss border and before we knew it we were in Dachau. The gate closed and it was\nAllach really which was a side camp of Dachau. So we were back behind the wires. And\nthen within a few days we saw the Americans come in, on the 30th of April that morning.\nThen they came over the little hill and we had to tell them we could walk, I could walk. We\ncould tell them and others could took. There were a lot of non Jewish prisoners there,\npolitical prisoners, Dutch, French, Belgium, Poles, mostly Western Europeans. And they had\nto tell the Americans not to touch the wires, they were under high tension. But the night, the\nlast night in that camp, the night of the 29th and the 30th there was a bombardment in that\ncamp. The Germans had for some reasons -- batteries around that camp, that I remember\nseeing, and the turned those batteries into the camp that night. They killed a lot of kids, a lot\nof people, mostly Jews. They turned to the Jewish part of the camp. The Jews were separate\nfrom the Christians. And they put their guns, aircraft guns go on an angle towards the sky\nand they put right through, straight out, horizontal into the camp and killed a lot of our\npeople the last night. And then the next morning the Americans came and they had to get the\nengineers to take the wires and the electricity off the wires, and we were liberated. And the\npicture you see that we use at the museum, that liberation picture, I'm in that picture. I think I\nknow who it is. I think I know who it 1s, that person that I see there.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Let me take the watch off. They too, my bar mitzvah watch.",
        "A: That's as close in as I can get.",
        "A: Can you read it? What are you reading?",
        "A: 382.",
        "A: All right. I made it very easy for myself, I didn't go into any emotion.",
        "A: Why? Because it's hard to explain it. I don't remember how I felt. I know one thing, I felt\nvery lonesome and very angry and like crying. I always remember that when I saw my\nparents go to the gas chamber I couldn't cry, I was so hardened already. See, but then I'm\nvery grateful because I'm not that hateful. I just put it out of my mind. When I think about it,\nI pick up a book. I don't want to think about it. I read. I've done that ever since '45. If it starts\nto come into my mind, I pick up a book real fast. That's the only way I can survive.",
        "A: Okay. I think we got everything. The liberation we got in here.",
        "A: Yes, the liberation. Then I went back to Holland, you know that, which is unimportant.\n"
