        "uh going back to early January of 1945\nwhere we knew something was going to happen, that\u2019 the\nRussian Army was not too far. And sometime, I believe uh\nvery early, January the 7th or 8th, I don't remember\nexactly. We were taken out of the Camp and uh told to march\nuh It was a brutal winter, as I remember, wickedly cold, and\nthe the trouble quote un quote started almost aS soon as we\nleft the camp because the weakest people who didn't have\nsufficient protection from the elements and didn't have\nenough food, started to falter fall back, and within a very\nshort period of time we began to hear shots and we knew what\nthey were. Because anyone who faltered was taken to the\nside. And most the roads of Poland have ditches on both\nSides, so they were just pushed towards the ditch, shot and\nwe just continued. I do not recall exactly how many days we\nwere marching, but I do know that uh many people, many\npeople uh were shot during the first two days. I believe it\nwas after this second day of marching where we stopped at a\nwhat would appear a large farm uh I was one of the very\nlucky ones, because uh they put me with a group of people in\na pig sty, which was great, because it protected us from",
        "elements. Uh, we stayed there for a while and someone in\nthe group was very enterprising and he had a_e pocket-knife\nand uh we decided to butcher one of the pigs. There were\nloads you know around us. uh I recall it\ntoday...laugh..almost you know with some humor because uh I\nuh vividly recall a whole slew of us sitting on the pig\ntrying to hold it down while somebody tried to butcher it\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 Int.

And whatever was left\nover us and we started to march again. And just\naround the third day, uh I began to feel that I wasn't going\nto make it because cold was sever and I was getting weaker,\nalthough I was in relatively, and I emphasize the _ word,\nrelatively, better shape when I then most when I left",

It\nstopped at various points for hours and then moved again.\nAnyway, we arrived at a place and I saw at a railroad\nstation which I recognize immediately because we\nall knew Mauthausen was another one another one of the\nconcentration camps.

And he said, \"you\nhave arrived at\" (I'm not quoting ver ba ver bedim) but eh\nhe said something to the effect extent you have arrived in\nMounthauser??? eh if you behave you have a chance if you\ndon't you don't have a change.

Eh, we....pause....got in, we were glad that we had a\nroof over our head. We were given towards the evening a the\nusual bowl of of liquid eh which was cold soup, but really,\nthere wasn't much more to it. Then we were told it was time\nto go to sleep and that was an interesting situation because\nthere were the couples who stood with big sticks over us,\nand they put people on the floor, head to toe, head to toe,\nlike sardines.

And eh he continued\nand just asked eh eh there were a number of eh bodies lying\naround and says, \"what happened to them?\" And a couple of\nthe blacks said \"oh the usual thing.\" He that was the end\nof that. We were, he left the the barracks, and we were\nthen allowed to mingle or whatever. Eh he went towards the\ngate of this camp and I followed him. I don't know why, eh\nI went with him all the way to the gate and when he opened\nthe gate and when he opened the gate, I asked him, I don't\nknow what posses me, but I asked him, \"May I go through the\ngate?\" And he kind of shrugged his shoulders again that\nhalf a smile on his face and um I went through. And that\nallowed me to go into the main camp were all the old\nprisoners were, prisoners who might have been in in\nMounthausen??? for several years. And as I walked around,\nand I knew I had to get back because we all had numbers and\nwe had to\neh stand for the counting at the, twice a day. But, again\neh providence, luck or whatever it was as I walked around I\nnoticed a familiar face and I walked over to the man. And\nof course he was in a prisoners uniform, but, well in a",

And I asked him, \"do you recognize\nme?\" And he looked at me and said \"of course.\" The man was\neh ah someone who was my father's employee before the war\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 Int.

Where did you come\nfrom?\" I said, \"just a few days ago I came from .\"\nHe looked at me, he was a wonderful man, I I will never\nforget him, and he said, \"sit over here and don't move until\nI come.\" I did not know, I did not know at all what he had\nin mind, why, but I certainly sat down and waited for him.\nEh in about a half an hour, and that was late afternoon, in\nabout a half an hour he came to me and he said, eh \"try to\nmake sure that you wear your shirt eh sleeves all the way\ndown so that know one sees your tatoo.\" Eh I says, \"why?\"\n\"Well the fact that today you are a Roman Catholic and you\nare Polish and you have been transferred from Camp 4 to Camp\n1 and you are going to go I think it was Block number\n3\" And eh I just couldn't believe it because eh in\nMounthausen???? Jews were not supposed to live. It was\nsomething that was well known. Anyway I reported to the",

He just left my name on it but it changed where it said\nJew, he changed it to Roman Catholic which the nationality,\nhe said Pole. Eh, that single ev event with without\nquestion saved my life.

        "eh I seen this eh wonderful man several times. He brought\nme food and eh I survived. Eh, as time went by, close to\nMay eh we knew something was happening. Eh, one of the\nthings that I noticed immediately is that a lot of the SS\nmen were disappearing and those who stayed suddenly were not\nwearing SS uniform, but rather the uniform. I also\nnoticed that the guards around the parameter of the camp,\nthe SS guards disappeared, and we were being watched by eh\nsome comical looking eh guys with eh in the sixties with\nguns and eventually some would tell us that these were the\nfire-brigades eh from Vienna. Eh somewhere around that time\nI remember there waS an air-raid and we had eh great\nMauthausen on the top of the mountain with a great vantage\npoint to observe what was going on. And eh one of the\nthings that I remember is that a eh plane was shot down by\nthe anti-aircraft and three American soldiers were brought\ninto the camp, eh chained to the wall near the gate, beaten\nbrutally. And eh the following day they were taken to\u2019 the\ngas chambers and killed. Just about a few days later we\nbegan to hear distant artillery and we knew that things were\ngoing to happen. Sight...we were very fearful because we\nwere told that the camp was mined and that the camp\ncommander had issued orders that the whole thing be blown up\nbefore liberation. The day of liberation, I remember very\nvery vividly because eh all of a sudden there was no_ one\naround the camp. There was no one at the gate. And it all\nhappened within like almost you know minutes. Eh eh at one\ntime, you know, one minute they were there the second no one",

HENRY KANNER\nPage 8\nyelling and then we just, the humanity, all the prisoners\nrushed to the gate and we went through the gate. Something\nthat was unheard of before. And we ran outside and in a\ndistance ..sniff..we saw a tank, a single tank, American\ntank and they did not they did not ride into the camp or\nclose to the camp. They just stopped there. Of course we\nrushed to them. I was one of the first, eh by the tank and\neh I we started of course screaming out of joy or eh and one\nof the eh one of the eh em soldiers, a lieutenant, he\nstarted to speak, he eh you know tried to respond to what we\nwere saying. Eh, of course everybody was talking in his own\nlanguage but eh he tried to respond and I am sure to this\nday that he must have been Jewish because he tried to speak\nin German which sounded more Yiddish to me than it sounded\neh German. The thing that is almost impossible forg to\nforget to me is the outcry, because you had several thousand\npeople yelling at the top of their voices. And it wasn't eh\nas I recall eh a shout of joy or anything. It was just like\nan eh eh an animalistic outcry. People were just yelling at",
        "their top of their lungs. I was yelling. And and eh it it\nit's incredible to this day to me.

It's just people I think eh in\nwere shouting in disbelief. People who never thought that\nthey they would see the day. Eh certainly, eh af after some\ntime it all eh you know died down and people began to",
        "realize really what what was happening. Eh in any event, we\neh everyone ran to the gate and were went right through it\neh, we ran to the tank. And we surrounded the tank of\ncourse, eh eh I was, I think I was one of the first people\nto reach one one of the first, one one of the first groups\nthat that reached the tank and we tried to communicate with\nwith the soldiers. Because of the languages of course, eh\neh it was very difficult until one of the eh em, one of the\nsoldiers tried to speak to us. And I recognized it he tried\nto speak German but eh it sounded much more Yiddish and I'm\nguite sure that he was eh eh Jewish. Eh after a while, the\neh Prisoner Camp Eldest approached the Americans and _ spoke\nto them, he apparently spoke English. And then one of the\nAmerican soldiers and the Camp Elder mounted the stand above\nthe main gate and I will never forget because they stood\nover there with all of us, thousands of people down below,\nand he uttered in German these words, \" \" which\ntranslates, \"you are free.\" When he said that the same\noutcry started.

The word \"you are free\"\neh just evoked eh a tremendous emotion of everyone. And\nagain, the five ten minutes you couldn't hear anything, but\nthis shouting.

Eh I knew\nthat I did not want to go back East since by that time, I\nknew that none of my family had survived. There was nothing\nthere and I had a lot of relatives in the United States.\nSo, I and eh eh a young Polish man eh whom I befriended in\nthe last couple of days decided that we were going to strike\nout and that we were going to walk. And we proceed. And we\nwalked from eh Mauthausen the immediate next city, which was\nLyn 22? We tried to find something to eat over there,\nbut the city was totally bombed out and couldn't even see\nanyone. We went to some of the house, there was nothing.\nSo, we continued to walk and into the direction of Westerly\nand en ..cough.. in the directions of the next town which\nwas . Anyway, being prisoners for so many\nyears we were afraid, still, of something, eh we did not\nwalk too much during the day. We tried to walk mostly at\nnight.

And eh told\nus that eh you probably escaped from Mauthausen and eh _ we\nknow what to do with you. I speak eh eh German rather\nfluently. So I had no problem communicating with them. So\nI tried to explain to them that eh there was no more\nMauthausen as they knew. That there were Americans over\nthere and eh I told them they are making a terrible mistake.\nAnd they laughed at at eh and eh eh left us alone but they\nwere Sitting, standing in a group discussing it. Eh I heard\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 Int.

Eh it went down for a couple of\nhours, finally they left, and one guy came later on and I\nspoke to him. And he was not so sure that we weren't\ntelling the truth. And I told him, \"look, you know there\nwill be hell to pay,\" em something to that extent.\n\"American's come and they will find out that you had _ hog",
