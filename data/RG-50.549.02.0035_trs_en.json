This is a follow up interview to a\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum videotape interview conducted in 1990. The\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr,\nfor making this interview possible. This is tape one, side A, Judith Meisel. [pause] This\nhas been a minute of ambiance in the Meisel home and now we go to the interview. So,\nthe first thing that I wanted to ask, just a few background questions --",
        "Answer: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- because the museum evidently does not have the full names of your brother, your\nsister and your parents.",
        "A: Uh-huh. Well, my father\u2019s name is Osser, it\u2019s O-s-s-e-r, Beker, B-e-k-e-r, that\u2019s my\nmaiden name. And my mother\u2019s is -- her maiden name was Friedman, Mina, M-1-n-a.\nAnd -- And my brother is Abe, A-b-e, Beker, B-e-k-e-r. And my sister, at that time her --\nRachel and her married name now is Levitin, L-e-v-t-i-t -- t-1-n, Levitin.",
        "Q: Thank you. And there was also a question about do you know when or how your\nfather died?",
        "A: My father died in 1938. They found him on the street dead. We didn\u2019t know, when\nthey brought him back to the little town where we were in Yasfenna -- he died in Kalnus\n-- whether it was robbery or -- we -- I really don\u2019t know, or a heart attack, I have no\nknowledge. But I know that he was -- he died in \u201838, before the Russians came into\nLithuania. And that\u2019s how my mother moved to Kalnus, to the big city.",
        "Q: All right. Just a few more background questions. You had mentioned in the interview\nthat you were still kind of haunted and thinking about Stutthof?",
        "A: Stutthof.",
        "Q: Stutthof.",
        "A: Concentration camp.",
        "Q: Yes, and I wonder if -- well, there was a question about how did you spend your days\nthere? Did you work, or --",
        "A: In Stutthof concentration camp, we mostly stood and in the beginning, we stood in\nappelle and then -- when we first arrived --",
        "Q: Ina --",
        "A: In appelle, just waiting to be taken, either to the gas chamber or to be killed or to\ncrematorium or any -- that, and we worked. The following -- I think a month later, after\nwe were there, we were -- we worked in a small -- there was a small factory and they\nwere making big bolts for the German army. I don\u2019t know what they were doing for the\nGerman army or Polish, or -- I don\u2019t know. And we worked there, just loading and there\nwould come off the conveyor belt and we would put it in -- into boxes and take it. Then,\nafter awhile we worked in the fields, there were fields that -- picking vegetables like\ncabbage and that, bringing it in for the -- into the camp. And -- And that\u2019s what we did.",
        "Q: And when you say we, you were?",
        "A: My mother and my sister.",
        "Q: And at night, you were --",
        "A: And the -- the rest of the people, I mean some people just would take sweaters apart,\nthe wool from the sweaters apart. There were groups of people sitting there. It came\napparent that the -- the money that they made or what they -- they were knitting scarfs.\nSo, they would send them to the German army and -- and th -- but th-the labor was done\nby the people who, they were there and that\u2019s from this goods that they took away from\nus when we arrived.",
        "Q: And was there any sort of ways that at -- at night, after work was done and you were\nwith your mother and your sister, how would you spend your time then?",
        "A: We were so exhausted and so hungry that when we would be in the barracks, we -- we\ncould not walk around in the barracks just at our will, we had to get into the bunk bed and\nstay there, when we came in at night. During the day, we weren\u2019t allowed to be in the\nbarrack.",
        "Q: Okay, and I also wanted to ask you then to jump to Mrs. Unstrom?",
        "A: U-Unstrom, yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, and her family. When you were with that particular family, I know it was --\nwere you --",
        "A: That was not in Stutthof, that was --",
        "Q: \u2019'm -- \u2019m moving now --",
        "A: Yeah, oh.",
        "Q: -- these are just background --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: -- follow up questions.",
        "A: Oh, okay.",
        "Q: So we will be moving --",
        "A: Mm--hm.",
        "Q: Were you paid in any way for your work?",
        "A: No, no, no. We were -- she knew we were kriggskafangener, which was refugees that\nwere under the -- you know, they didn\u2019t know we were Jewish and we worked as slave\nlabor, you know. And -- And we worked there and it -- she was just horrible -- just\nhorrible. Had 11 children. And every night was a ritual, whatever was leftover from her\nchildren, she would tie our hands behind our back, so we would amuse her children,\neating on our knees. And if we did -- if they didn\u2019t laugh enough or amuse them enough -\n- was a ritual for her -- she would beat us. And on Sunday, would take us to church,\nwhich -- she had one dress, we would put on that dress, I -- and go with her to church.\nAnd I just went back there, the first time -- I was back there now twice, which in the last\nsix years, and the first time I was back, I couldn\u2019t believe I found the place. They\nchanged it a little bit, they made -- you know, but this was the place where we were.",
        "Q: In what city?",
        "A: It\u2019s called Misucheva. It\u2019s 80 kilometers from Danzig. It\u2019s near Stutthof. And I -- I\nfound the place and it was just -- just incredible to g -- relive to s -- wi-with the place.\nAnd with her, wh-when they -- in -- was in 1945, he ha -- it was around March, we --\nthey were evacuating all the people from the area and we sailed with her and we were\ntold -- she told us -- this is the story that she said, that if -- we didn\u2019t want to go with her,\nbut if we didn\u2019t that they would let out the sewers, they\u2019re letting the sewers out and\nflooding the whole area, which is near Gdansk, which is a large port. And so we left and\nwe went to Denmark with her. And as soon as we went into the harbor, we were\ntorpedoed, the boat torpedoed. And we were -- I don\u2019t know how long I was in the -- in\nthe -- in the sea. You know, it\u2019s the North Sea there, Atlantic.",
        "Q: How old were you at the time?",
        "A: At that time, I was fiftee -- no, I was 16 years old. And so she w -- from then, we lost\nher. We didn\u2019t know -- she enda -- she survived the dr -- she wasn\u2019t drowned and we\nwere in the water, I have no idea how long. I was so numb that when they picked me up,\nthey wrapped me in blankets, I was -- my sister and me, we held up on a plank. To this\nday, I don\u2019t swim -- and --",
        "Q: You were torpedoed and then you -- so you were in the water?",
        "A: In the water. The boat sank that we started out from Danzig.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: And the -- then, from there, they took us with a small boat, all the G-Germans -- this\nwas, you know, now it\u2019s Poland, but at that time it was Germany and they took us to the -\n- to Denmark. And when we arrived in Denmark, they put us in -- in a gymnasium.",
        "Q: Was it the Germans who took you?",
        "A: Yeah, the Germans. But they didn\u2019t know we were Jewish. They were -- took us with\nMrs. Unstrom, but they picked up all the people and they took us to Denmark. They put\nus in a big auditorium. and we could go out now, for the first time. We could go out and -\n- as long as we came back by dusk.",
        "Q: Was this like a -- a school?",
        "A: It was a school and it was -- the place was called -- the little town was called Svininga,\nin Denmark.",
        "Q: And did you then -- you were then separated from Mrs. Unstrom?",
        "A: We were separated from Mrs. Unstrom, but we found out that she survived and five of\nher kids drowned. And it was very interesting, there was a trial in Denmark, because we -\n- well, I don\u2019t know, do you want me to talk about that? Well, when we came to -- to\nDenmark, on May fifth, 1945, Ill never forget the day we were liberated, the war was\nover, yeah. Actually, the very end of March, it was like maybe the 30th of March, so -- so\nI was only maybe five weeks later. Five weeks later, du-during that five weeks, before\nliberation, we didn\u2019t do anything, we were just -- could go on the street. We could -- had\nto stay in the little town. We could walk around and as long as we came back by dusk.\nAnd we were all in this big auditortum and I remember one day we were walking, my\nsister and I and there was a woman working in the fields and we asked her, \u201cAre there\nany Jews here?\u201d And she said, \u201cWhen you Germans --\u201d she thought we were Germans --\n\u201cWhen you Germans are going to be in concentration camps, the Jews will come back\nfrom Sweden.\u201d And we were afraid to start asking her more -- for more information\nbecause we thought, at that time, that we were the only two Jews, that we were going to\nsurvive. And that was very important to us, because before we got to Mrs. Unstrom, we --\nwe -- when we first escaped -- you probably have that on the tape, no? When we first\nescaped, the -- what happened is they took us out of Stutthof. And that was the end of\nDecember or the very beginning of January and in that -- that I can say that is because the\nChristmas trees were still in the people\u2019s homes. So we knew it was around that time. We\ndidn\u2019t know exactly the dates and so forth. And as soon as we wa -- we walk a whole day\n-- my sister was so sick with typhus. By then, already, my mother was taken into the gas\nchamber. I was with her inside the gas chamber and that, you have that, I\u2019m sure, on the\ntape. And I had absolutely -- I could hardly walk, but I really had such a strong sense that\nI wanted to survive, because I felt someone has to tell what happened. Because the mo-\nmost difficult part of it was that we all thought none of us will come out alive and there\nwill be no one to talk about, no one to tell anything, nobody will know. And we all\nvowed ourselves that we will tell -- whoever survives will remember and we will tell and\nthat\u2019s why I was back a couple of times to Stutthof. It just -- I feel that everybody there\nwas my family, and that I have to go -- as painful as it is, I have to go out to tell. So we --\nmy sister -- I was dragging her and she keeps saying, \u201cI can\u2019t go on.\u201d She was -- she had\ntyphus. Just right then, she had gotten typhus. And I kept saying, \u201cWe will live, we will\nlive.\u201d And I kept egging on and all of a sudden, the sky opened up and the bombs started\nto fall and everybody started to run, everybody started to run. And I had no energy. I just\nfell into a ditch with an -- there was another woman, Luba, who was helping me. She was\nholding me up. I don\u2019t know who was holding who, we were all three. And we saw a\nhouse and we walked across the house and we knocked on the door. And the woman\nopened up the door and as if she knew we were coming and we were wearing the striped\ndress with the clogs and [indecipherable] the wind was howling, it was a big storm. And\nshe quickly tore off, and we were now standing naked in front of her -- tore off our\nclothes and gave us clothing and told to the Russiansaw who was working there, he was a\nprisoner of war, that we are -- to taken us to the Umschlagplatz to be killed. And that\u2019s\nwhere they took all the people, to the Umschlagplatz to be killed. And they gave us some\nfood and oh, I was so sick from just having the first -- you know, real food. And we\nstayed there a couple of hours, til night time. And h-he sat there and she gave us a shawl\nand clothes and gave us some food and she told him to take us to the Umschlagplatz.\nWhy she did it -- you know, my sister always says, \u201cYou gave -- give that woman credit\nthat she saved our lives.\u201d And I said, \u201cYeah, because if she hadn\u2019t taken off the clothes\nfrom us and if she hasn\u2019t told the soldier to take us, where he saved our lives.\u201d What he\ndid was, we went out and Luba, who could not longer go -- she was much older and we\nwere and she said she was going to remain there. And when I was just back there, I found\nout that she died and they buried her right there in the farm. And so, anyways, we went\nwith this so -- Russian guy and he said, \u201cI\u2019m not taking you to the Umschlagplatz. What\nI\u2019m going to do 1s -- is I\u2019m going to -- I\u2019m going to take you to the nearest point where\nit\u2019s frozen.\u201d It\u2019s called the vikes -- it was called the Vikesel, now it\u2019s the Vistula river.\nAnd -- the narrowest point and wi -- and he was on the horse, he was making tracks and\nwe were following him. And he said to call on all our force. If it\u2019s wet, we will drown,\nbecause that means that the ice is broken. And we should do it at night so nobody detect\nus. And all night long, we were crawling across. Th-They just filmed it and the film of\nthere, you know, it was beautiful, you know, in the summer and that. And we got across\non the other side and he told us to go to a convent. Th-The nuns w -- an -- but we should\nsay we are not Jewish, we should say --",
        "Q: What country is this? And what language were you speaking?",
        "A: This 1s -- we were speaking to him -- my sister knew Russian, because we lived under\nStalin for a few years. And -- but this was -- they were all speaking German. Now, it\u2019s\nPoland, but then it was Germany, was East Germany. So, what happened 1s we -- we --\nmy name became from Udit -- Uta. Beker is a German name. And hers, from Wachal\nbecame Anna and we were now were wandering and we got to the -- to the convent and\nthe nuns were wonderful to -- but they knew.",
        "Q: So, the river was frozen?",
        "A: The river was frozen. We crawled across the river all night long and we are able to go\non the other side. And he said to go to the -- on the other side. The river divided so it was\n-- where Stutthof was, was on one side and da -- and the road -- there is a bridge now that\nyou can go over, is -- but it\u2019s really frozen because they have horses going across, I\nmean, that particular year, it was frozen. That was also when they attacked Russia and\nthey couldn\u2019t do it, because the winter was so s-severe. And we are talking of the year of\n1944 -- \u201845. And so, we -- she -- and we got into the convent. The convent, the nuns were\nwonderful, they washed us, they bathed us, they took care of us. And my sister\u2019s typhus\ngot better, but I got sick. And they said to us that we cannot -- they cannot keep us. They\nknew we were Jewish -- that we would have to -- they would have to baptize us. We\u2019d\nhave to convert. And that we didn\u2019t want. It was the most important thing. The more they\nsaid they would do it, which in -- few days we decided we will not stay there. We were --\nwe talk about it now, how foolish we were. But we didn\u2019t know what that meaned,\nconversion and we, only to survive, to -- wanted to survive as Jews. We wanted to tell the\nworld what happened as Jews. We didn\u2019t want to be Catholics or anything else. So we\nleft and my sister -- and I was very, very sick, the -- again we met another Russian,\nbecause the Russian liberated that area and there were lot of fighting and took me to\nDanzig and left me on the steps of the hospital. And my sister said, \u201cYou can\u2019t say a\nword, you s -- you\u2019re stoom, you\u2019re no -- no -- don\u2019t make -- you know, don\u2019t talk.\u201d And\nshe, without realizing it, crossed the bridge and went back to the same place near there --\nnear Stutthof, without realizing it. Because when I was just there, I\u2019ve realize how close it\nis to Stutthof. She went to the bridge and they told her that there is a place there -- she\ndidn\u2019t know from Wehrmacht, from what, you know, she didn\u2019t know of that -- that they\nare looking for work -- that they need workers. So, we wen -- she worked -- went into a\nWehrmacht station, which is -- you know, the German army, where they get all their --\nand thats was Mrs. Unstrom, that\u2019s what she had. She had this huge, huge house and she\nwas running like a hotel, or -- you know, for -- a stopover for the Wehrmacht -- for the\nGerman army to come. And when we worked -- and then, when I get better, she came\nand -- and got me back to the -- to the house where she worked. And it happened so fast,\nit happened within weeks, with the period of week. I was in the hospital, I think, for two\nweeks. She came and picked me up and we were there maybe 10 days on that farm and\nthen we sailed for Denmark. But those 10 days was just horrifying, horrifying days, beca",
        "Q: Do you think she knew you were Jewish?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Why on earth would she have treated children so badly?",
        "A: Well, why -- why did they kill the million and a half children and a million -- 11\nmillion people, six million Jews, why? I mean, she was German, her husband was in the\nSS. She -- She was real Nazi and -- and th-the people that are living around Stutthof right\nnow, and I went into a couple of houses and interviewed them and asked them, did -- did\nyou know what happened in Stutthof and they said yes. But, I\u2019m talking the people who\nwere, at that time, 18 - 20. I mean, they\u2019re in their 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, you know, and it\u2019s -- the\nolder people. And they said, \u201cYeah, we knew.\u201d \u201cWhat did you do about?\u201d \u201cWhat --\nWhat can I do? They were our enemies, the Jews, the Slavs, they had to be\nexterminated.\u201d And, you know, it\u2019s -- was something, a matter of -- of fact. This was\nwhat was supposed to happen to them.",
        "Q: There was another question that someone in the Oral History Department wanted me\nto ask you about, that you mentioned about your hair being pulled --",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- out in Stutthof.",
        "A: Concentration camp.",
        "Q: How did that happen?",
        "A: Well, when we first came from the ghetto -- when we were taken t -- from the ghetto,\nit was around July in the ghetto and we had to line up. First we had to take off whatever\nwe had, our clothes and everything and -- and just throw it in the piles. And [ll never\nforget when I first came in, the piles of shoes and combs and toothbrushes and you name\nit, they had it there. And I kept saying to my mother, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d And she said,\n\u201cT have no answer.\u201d And then they told us to get undressed. The first one to get undressed\nwas my mother. When I think of how many times she had to stand naked in front of those\nbeasts. She was such a beautiful, religious woman, gorgeous woman and had to be just\nlike this, before they even killed you. What -- the humiliation that -- having to see what\nthey are doing to her children. So my mother and my sister and my mother, she had gold\ndenture, they just simply yanked it out. And her whole face was full of blood. And they\nthrew her a striped dress, the Kapo lady threw a dress and a pair of clogs and pushed her\non the side. And then my sister and then me. And I had long, curly hair -- blonde, curly\nhair. And they used to call me Shirley Temple, because Shirley Temple had -- did I know\nwho Shirley Temple? But they used to -- you know, [indecipherable] she looks like\nShirley Temple, they used say. And the Gestapo lady, on one side, tore out my -- the long\nlocks and the guy -- big, black boots who -- who it was the commandant, took out and he\nsaid, \u201cOh, this\u2019Il do for my poopy, for my dolls -- daughter\u2019s doll,\u201d in German. And then\nthey continued cutting it and that and my whole head was full of blood. Then, the next\none had to get undressed, her name is Hava. And my sister -- my daughter is an artist and\nshe has paintings going around, all over the country and she has a painting about this. S --\nIt\u2019s about stories my mother told me and she depict this Hava so incredible. And when I\nwent back to -- to Stutthof, Hava is always with me. I\u2019Il tell you why. Hava got\nundressed, she was wearing a loose dress. And when she -- by the way, when my mother\ngot undressed, my mother had sewn 1n, in her -- a pouch in my sister\u2019s and mine, like\nlittle pouches. She didn\u2019t even let us know she did that. She put it -- sewed it in, because\nshe thought -- there was some rings, there was diamond rings, some watch, some jewelry\nand some rings and whatever she had, so she put it in, she cushioned it. When we took it\nout, it fell all over and we never got it. Hava took off her dress and a little baby fell out.\nThe baby -- I -- a tiny, little baby, because gave such a little squeak and he picked up the\nbaby and he threw it. And -- the commandant. And, so those are the memory when I went\nto Stutthof, Hava. So, anyways, whens -- we got into the bunk -- to the barrack, and my\nmother was on top and I was in the middle with Hava, my mother was on top with my\nsister Rachel. And Hava would rub my -- like this with her fist, my hand. And I would\nsay to her, \u201cWhat do you have in your fist?\u201d And she never answered. And we would all\nsay, \u201cHava, what do you have? What do you have?\u201d She had a little baby\u2019s shoes, when\nthey took -- and because she wouldn\u2019t give up the shoe, they took her out. We all had to\nstand outside and watch and they put a bullet through her head. So that\u2019s Hava\u2019s story.\nAnd I have to tell it, because there\u2019s nobody else for her to talk. I\u2019m sorry.\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: We\u2019re moving now, to tape one, side B.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape one, side B, Judith Meisel, and we\u2019re continuing to talk about -- you were\nmentioning your brother.",
        "A: Well, my b -- when they took us from the ghetto -- from the Kovno ghetto, they took\nus trucks and we went to Kinigsburg, I remember, cause I could remember seeing the\nname written there. And from there they took us to Stutthof concentration camp. And at\nStutthof my brother was taken from us and we didn\u2019t know where they were taking him.\nAnd we didn\u2019t find out until 1947 that he was alive, and he was in Italy, that he was in\nDachau.",
        "Q: So, as far as Stutthof and how it affected your life and your relationships, do you still\nhave dreams? I know you have thoughts constantly, but how often does this come to you?",
        "A: How often do the thoughts come to me? I think about it all the time. I think about it, I\nmean -- I dream about it. When I can\u2019t fall asleep, it comes back to me, and it\u2019s like a\nmirage of -- of -- see people\u2019s faces. I don\u2019t remember a lot of their names, but I can see\ntheir faces, I was with. They\u2019re constantly with me and when my first grandchild was\nborn, I remember when I held him, I held him for all the children that didn\u2019t survived.",
        "Q: That must have been a beautiful experience.",
        "A: It was just -- I felt like I was holding him for all of them who were my age, who didn\u2019t\nsurvive. So, I\u2019m constantly thinking that here I am, thank God I\u2019m alive and so forth.\nPeople ask me constantly also, \u201cDo you feel guilty that you survived?\u201d I\u2019m constantly\nasked that. I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have no guilt.\u201d I feel I had mazel -- I had the luck that I\nsurvived and because I survived, I have a mission that I have to tell and wherever I\u2019m\ninvited, I go out and I speak as long as they pay my -- my fare or a hotel, I go out to\nspeak. And I\u2019ve gone to places like Lubec, Texas and -- and -- and Livington, New\nMexico and places like that, you know. Because I feel the scary thing is that the deniers\nare out there. And I feel that I need to be out there to tell what happened, to see what\nracism and bigotry do if it\u2019s allowed to flourish.",
        "Q: I -- [have a question which relates to your and your sister\u2019s decision to leave the\nnunnery.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And that was the strength of your faith, of your Judaism. Did you have this kind of\nattachment to being Jewish before the Holocaust?",
        "A: Oh yeah. I mean, we lived -- from the time I was born in a little shtetl, I guess, from\nwhat I remember, we had a real Jewish life. I mean, my mother was very, very religious\nand my father, too. N-Not as -- from what I hear from my brother and my sister -- I\u2019m the\nyoungest in the family -- that she was more than him. But we -- we knew we were Jewish\nfirst and til this day -- to this day, if you ask me, \u201cWho are you?\u201d I will say, \u201cI\u2019m Jewish\nAmerican.\u201d I will not say I\u2019m American and I\u2019m Jewish, because my Jewishness came\nbefore my American. And that, to me, is very important. And I think I\u2019ve instilled that\nalso in my children. And the most important thing to me 1s to have a Jewish life and to\nlive a Jewish life -- an ethical Jewish life and to respect other religions, their differen -- to\nrespect their differences and to -- to me this is most important thing. But I will certainly --\nmy Judaism meaned more than anything, was my life. But it wasn\u2019t just me, I was the\nyounger and my sister. My sister was like my sister and my mother and everything, and\nher -- from her strength. I did what she told me to do. Now, it\u2019s a little different, she\u2019s\nmore -- a very sick husband, very sick and it\u2019s more difficult, so \u2019m become the role --\nthe mother figure to her now.",
        "Q: When you say ethical Jew -- how do you distinguish ethical and religious and how\ndoes this affect your faith?",
        "A: Well, to me, I have to respect -- I think my involvement in the Civil Rights movement\n-- I got involved really, not just as another human being feeling for another human being.\nI got involved because I let everybody know I\u2019m Jewish. It\u2019s a moral racism. If the\nAfrican Americans are not having, or the Black community do not have the same rights\nas I, as a white person who is Jewish -- they don\u2019t have the rights, I don\u2019t have my right.\nMy right is tampered. And, to me, this became my -- my big thing as far as -- morality is\nfor each person -- how shall I say it? Each person derives themselves what is moral and\nwhat\u2019s immoral. My arriving on immoral is that we cannot allow to happen again, what\nhappened, to anyone, no matter who they are. Black, White, Yellow, anyone. And to me,\nthat\u2019s the morality for me. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d --",
        "Q: Now, respectfully, I\u2019m taking this back a -- a little bit -- a -- a long while, to liberation\nand the moment you realized you were free and those first few -- few days and how you\nand your sister responded.",
        "Q: Well, we heard the word, Achtung, Achtung, that \u201cGermany capitulia\u201d -- that the --\nthere -- the war was over. And we couldn\u2019t believe her, my sister said, \u201cWe have to tell\nthem we are Jewish.\u201d And I started crying, and I said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid. What if they find --\nwhat if it\u2019s a hoax?\u201d And -- Because we was in hiding still, you know, we -- nobody\nknew we were Jewish. And we went over to the Red Cross worker, the lady, and we told\nher we were Jewish and she stood up and she started to cry and then she pulled out a\npiece of paper and she said, \u201cCan you prove that you are Jewish?\u201d And we signed both\nour name in Hebrew. And she got up and gave us each -- it was a big, heavy -- big hug.\nAnd she said, \u201cDo you know where you are?\u201d And I say, \u201cWe know we are not in\nGermany.\u201d And from then on, they took us right to den -- to Co-Copenhagen and they\nput us into a big gymnasium and the place was called Endrupskoola. It\u2019s a big gym --\nactually, the Germans had build this for them to -- as an athletic club -- was huge\ncomplex. And there were several thousand people there in the -- in the auditorium.",
        "Q: So, they built it?",
        "A: The Germans, when they occupied Denmark, built it. And the most interesting thing\nwas that I was walking -- I was -- my sister and I -- it was like the second day we were\nthere and I heard a woman going around and saying, \u201cShalom.\u201d And I said, \u201cAleichem\nShalom.\u201d And she gave me a hug because her mother had told her -- they had just come\nback from Sweden -- that she heard that they m -- to see if there were any Jews in the --\namongst the refugees. And Bella Katsinelson and she\u2019d -- in fact, when I was just there\nrecently, she reminded me and she brought me back -- brought me to her house --",
        "Q: You saw her recently?",
        "A: Yeah. And -- But the interesting thing was that we couldn\u2019t leave unless we had a\nDane sign out for us to come out. And I -- when they told me that I -- we were free, I\ncollapsed like a puppet and they -- was pu-put in immediately into a real chair. And I wor\n-- and when -- and they gave me a kerchief.",
        "Q: They is the Red Cross?",
        "A: The Red Cross, they gave me a kerchief, cause they could see my hair was -- little bit\nof hair and wounds and so forth. And I never took that kerchief off. And then I remember\nthe reporter asking me -- immediately the reporter descended on us, and they\u2019re ask me,\n\u201cDo you hate the Germans?\u201d",
        "Q: What language do they speak to you in?",
        "A: German. \u201cDo you hate the Germans?\u201d And I said, I remember [indecipherable] \u201cI am -\n- | hate hate.\u201d And -- Because hate stifles you, you can\u2019t live with hate. I am outraged, I\nam full of rage that the world allowed this to happen, that this -- something like that\nhappen. And the second one was \u201cWhat would you like to eat?\u201d And I said, \u201cBread,\nherring and potatoes and all the water I can drink.\u201d And the next thing happened, they\ncame in there -- Red Cross lady came and she said there was a family -- a lady -- a man\nand a lady who would like to take us out for the day, they would like to show us\nCopenhagen and buy you some clothes. And their name was Paula and Swen Yensen.\nWell, for us it was heaven. And they took us out, and they took us out every day and then\nshe saw how sick I was, she immediately took me to a doctor and they put me to -- into\nSiloril sanitorium and I had TB. I had -- my lungs were collapsed, my stomach was shrun\n-- you name it, I had every possible -- and I was almost for two years, 1n a hospital. They\nnursed my back to health. I weighed 47 pounds, I was 16 years old. And they literally\nnursed me back to health. Strangers. I couldn\u2019t even talk to them, because they didn\u2019t\nspeak -- but Paula and Swen Yensen, they didn\u2019t speak German, they only spoke Danish.\nAnd I learned Danish very quick. And they kept on saying -- and we kept on asking, \u201cAre\nthere any Jews?\u201d And they said, \u201cOh, they\u2019re coming back from Sweden.\u201d I said -- we\nkept saying, my sister and I, \u201cHow do you know they\u2019re coming -- there are Jews coming\nback from Sweden?\u201d And they told us what happen, how they took the Jews over to\nSweden. And I\u2019ll never forget when the first gathering -- the first gathering of people that\ncame back from Sweden. And they took me and they put me in pa -- and they put me in -\n- in the wheelchair, my sister and I and they took us both to the harbor and I saw the\narrival of this Jews from Sweden, the first arrival. And the first one, Rabbi Fritakker\ncame off the boat and he made a special cheriyon, or a special blessing. He was the chief\nrabbi then. And I think that I f -- we kept saying, \u201cThe Jewish people survived. If they\nsurvived, maybe my brother survived.\u201d And we began to look for my brother and then we\nfound him in 19 -- he was -- wrote to us in 1947. We put a -- we made a big poster and\nwe sent it. We found someone who also survi -- who also came to Denmark and they --",
        "Q: You and your sister --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- in Denmark?",
        "A: Yeah. Her name was Rena Gortz and she had left a -- a child with a family -- a Polish\nfamily and she was looking for the child. But she knew she had a brother-in-law in -- in\nPalestine and he wrote to her, the brother-in-law, saying that her husband survived and he\nis in Italy. And we said, \u201cWell, Regina, maybe we\u2019ll -- we should write to your husband,\nmaybe he know --\u201d And sure enough, about a month later, my brother saw it on -- you\nknow, he was like in a Displaced Person\u2019s camp in Italy and he saw it -- the --",
        "Q: He saw what?",
        "A: The -- We made a poster.",
        "Q: You had a picture of him?",
        "A: No, no, we had no picture wi --",
        "Q: Just his name?",
        "A: Just his name and then he wrote immediately for us to come and by then, my sister\nhad met her future husband, who was Danish. And I wanted to -- when he came -- then\nhe eventually ended up in Canada.",
        "Q: Before we get to Canada, though, I -- you were going to tell me about one of the first\nthings the Red Cross gave you when --",
        "A: Oh, the first thing when we did, is they put us into showers. Before they took us to\nCopenhagen, they put us into showers, washed us and then they gave me the kerchief.\nAnd then they gave me -- the kerchief I don\u2019t have -- they gave me a blanket. And that\nwas my first piece of possession I had. And I wore that blanket all over, I wrapped myself\naround. And they gave me a dress and it was much too -- my stomach was big and I\nbegan to develop after awhile, so -- but everything else was just hanging, like flesh, you\nknow, just skin. And -- And so, the blanket I have. When all the years -- in fact, I asked\nmy sister, \u201cWhat do you -- what did you do with your blanket?\u201d She says, \u201cWell, when I\ngot -- could afford to buy a new one, I threw it out.\u201d I said, \u201cThat\u2019s the difference\nbetween you and me. I still have it and now the museum wants it.\u201d So, I still have that\nblanket and I'll probably give it to them, except that blanket -- every time my child was\nsick, I cuddled it. It was my security blanket.",
        "Q: Even after you had children?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: You cuddled them in that blanket?",
        "A: Yeah. That was my special blanket.",
        "Q: Why do you think -- what did that blanket represent to you? Or does it?",
        "A: Freedom. Freedom, freedom.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So, getting out of Denmark -- you were there for how long?",
        "A: Well, I got to Denmark -- well, I was there from March of -- you know, before the war\nwas over -- from March of \u201c45 and I went for -- it was August of 1949, to Canada.",
        "Q: And -- And so, how did you reunite with your brother, only after Canada, so -- if so,\nhow did you make plans for -- for immigrating?",
        "A: Well, he -- he -- when h -- when he survived Dachau, he wanted -- first thing he was\ngoing to go, is to look for us, to Lithuania. But when he came to the border, they told\nthem that if he gets in, he won\u2019t be able to get out, it was the Russians. So, he went back\nand he went -- go to Palestine then, to -- to Israel. Well, there was the British blockade,\nhe couldn\u2019t. So -- and they were taking people to Cyprus. So he remained in Italy and a\nwoman -- it was very hard to get in the United States or Canada. There were quotas and\nso forth. So him and 22 others, a woman who literally mortgaged her house -- her name\nwas Mrs. Sadoff, and brought the 22 young guys to Toronto, to Canada.",
        "Q: Was she Italian?",
        "A: No, no, she was Jewish and she -- a lot of people did --",
        "Q: Russian?",
        "A: No. Born -- I think she was -- maybe came very, very young, as a child, to -- I think\nfrom Lithuania to Canada. But she was very involved with the refugees and so forth. She\npassed away since then. And he came on a quota to Toronto. And as s-soon as he came,\nhe -- well, we were corresponding constantly and -- and that -- he -- I wanted to go to\nhim. I wanted to leave Europe. By then my sister was married and had already a child,\nand --",
        "Q: Where were you living?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: Where were you living? You?",
        "A: Me, I had -- I was living by myself. I was live -- first we lived with a family, with the\nFrankel family and then, after my sister got married, I got a little -- tiny little hole in the\nground, just for myself and I lived there and I -- I became a nanny and [indecipherable].\nAnd my school was so disrupted that I began to -- I used to take courses and I spoke\nDanish fluently. People couldn\u2019t understand -- I learned it so good because I wanted to\ncommunicate with the people. I just loved them, they -- to me, the Danish people are a\nholy people. They are so incredible. I\u2019m -- they\u2019re so incredible what they did, I mean, it\njust -- it\u2019s as like -- it\u2019s just unbelievable, like Paula Yensen, and this is -- this was\nhappening all over Denmark, that when the Jews were taken over to Sweden, they have --\ntheir friends had a factory and her husbands was taking care of the factory. When they\ncame back, all the money that was made over the -- the two and a half years that they\nwere in Sweden, were given to them. I mean, homes were painted -- their homes were\npainting -- flowers in their homes, everything -- I mean, it\u2019s just -- and the fact that they\nrisked their lives, you know, it\u2019s --",
        "Q: When you wrote back and forth from Denmark to Italy, what -- the -- can you\nremember the moment when you discovered that -- that your brother was alive? When\nyou got the first --",
        "A: Yeah, I have a postcard he sent. He sent a high holiday postcard, I'll never forget, with\na picture. They used to do the -- the picture would come in, you know, like heart and\ninside put a picture, that was the mode. And my -- my brother -- we could not -- I mean,\nwe could not believe. We were horrified of telling h-him what happened to my mother.\nWe just kept saying -- and we couldn\u2019t just get the words to say that was taken in the gas\nchamber and I saw it. Many things -- my brother and my sister don\u2019t want to talk about\nanything that happened. They can\u2019t understand that I can go around speaking about it. I\nmean, they are proud of me that I am doing it, but they can\u2019t. It was more things of how\nwe can get together and -- and -- and be together. My sister already by then was anchored\ndown in Denmark, so I left for Canada.",
        "Q: Just a moment now. Did you -- How did you tell him that your mother was dead?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t until not too long ago. When they did --",
        "Q: But he knew she had died?",
        "A: Yes. Not how. Not how.",
        "Q: So, I\u2019m sorry -- what -- so, you were writing -- yo-you received a postcard from him.\nYour sister --",
        "A: We were writing mostly is not what -- what happened and the horror and so forth. We\nwere more really writing of how we can be together and start as a family, be\n[indecipherable] him and me and my sister, whether -- wherever it would be that we\nwould be together. And if he had gotten to Palestine, I would have been in -- in Israel\ntoday. In fact, 1t was very interesting, when I first met Martin Luther King, one evening\nat dinner and he asked me, \u201cWhy did you come to the United States?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell,\nI didn\u2019t, I came to Canada and I came because of my brother.\u201d If my brother was able to\nhave come -- Canada was the furthest from him to come. The first one was to got to -- to\nIsrael, to Palestine, but he couldn\u2019t. It was the British blockade. I probably would have\nbeen in Israel today, cause I came just to be with him.",
        "Q: So, did he help arrange a visa for you --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- or did the Danish help?",
        "A: No, no. I had to do everything myself. I had to -- one of the things that I had to do 1s I\nhad to pay for the -- and I didn\u2019t have money. So I had -- a gi -- friend helped me with\nsome money -- Jewish friend. Paula was very upset, because sh -- that I told her I was\nleaving, she couldn\u2019t understand. She -- Paula Yensen, because they wanted really -- their\ndream was to adopt both of us, they had no children. They were Lutheran family, they\nwere wonderful. And -- And so they -- oh, so hard to think no [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Do you want to take a little break?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, how you got -- how you planned to get to Canada and the goodbyes you had to\nsay.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm. Mm-hm. Well, as soon as my -- I -- as soon as I found out my\nbrother came to Toronto, to Canada, he had no money to help me to come. The -- There\nwas no place that I could go. There was really, in Denmark, not even a HIAS that could\nhelp me. You know, HIAS was who -- was an organization that helped refugees, you\nknow, go places. And there was the visa, how do you -- you get? Before that, you have to\ngo to a doctor and thank God that in Denmark is socialized medicine so you have to see\nthat you don\u2019t have syphilis and th-that. And me having had TB was -- became a\nproblem, but I was already clear out of that and they gave me a clear bill of health to\ncome into this country. And so, I worked. The people who I took care of, the kids I\nbabysat, I did all kinds of things in Denmark to earn some money to come. And one\nsummer, I pick strawberries. That\u2019s why when I go by now and I go on the way to San\nFrancisco, I go on Salenas and so on, I see them picking that and I said, \u201cOh boy.\u201d No\nmatter how expensive we pay for strawberries, we get it so cheap, because it\u2019s very hard\nwork. You know, you empathize with what we get so cheap, the vegetables and how little\nthey get paid, the migrant workers. Really, I always bring these things back, constantly to\nme. And so, when I finally had enough money, then there were everybody saying\ngoodbye and Paula and Swen Yensen, they were -- they were just horrified that I would\nleave them. They were -- I was their little pia, their little child. And -- And I sailed -- I\nwent through -- on train and I took and I was -- went to -- through -- going to\nBremerhaven, where I sailed from.",
        "Q: With a visa?",
        "A: With a visa. But I had to go through the -- the zone and I was taken, you know, here I\nam on the train and after all that, I\u2019m going to Germany. I remembered -- I\u2019ll never forget\nthat -- with the visa and then there is the eastern zone and the western zone and you get\non and you have to constantly show your visa [indecipherable]. And lo and behold, as\nI\u2019m doing that, for some reason, they take me off the -- the train. And I was going\nthrough Paris first, because a woman by the name Mrs. Wagner, Madame Wagner, she\nwas -- She knew me from Denmark and she was going to pick me up in France. And here,\nI can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m taken over in Bremerhaven, and -- because it was stamped\nfor there, but I was supposed to leave from LeHavre -- from France, going to Quebec.\nAnd for some reason -- I mean, I didn\u2019t -- you know, it was stamped and they were --\nthey were not, but I gave them such a hard time. I was crying and I was like this. I mean,\nit was just so upsetting and I couldn\u2019t talk to them and I didn\u2019t want to talk German and\nbeing in Germany, I just hated, you know, the fact, you know, that I have to\n[indecipherable] what is happening, that kind. And so finally they stamped it and the next\nday they put me on the train and she picked me up and I was a wreck. I get on the train --\nI get on the boat, and --",
        "Q: At LeHavre.",
        "A: At LeHavre and I\u2019m sailing for Quebec. And the whole boat -- it was called the\nScertia, was owned by Conrad Whitestar or something -- and the whole boat, there are\nGerman uniforms and -- I mean, I\u2019m not going up where the -- all the regular passenger\nare, this was steerage, you know. And all of a sudden, I hear there are about -- they\u2019re all\nguys and they\u2019re speaking Danish. And I went over to them, and I said \u201cAdudansk,\u201d I\nmean, I started talking to them Danish, and I became -- they -- they protected me. All the\ntrip, they were taking care of me. They were just incredible. They were so wonderful to\nme. They were going on a special thing in -- up in Canada somewhere, doing agricultural\n-- you know, Denmark\u2019s very a-agricultural. They had some kind of a thing going there,\nyeah.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",

        "A: So anyway, so then we finally -- when we arrived at Quebec, I was -- and then wa --\noh, so when -- part of that I -- si -- they told me they -- they were not in steerage, they\nwere, you know, in the regular passengers. And they got me up and they said, \u201cOh, if\nyou\u2019re Jewish, there\u2019s a whole group, there\u2019s about three guys who are Jewish and they\nare on the boat.\u201d So, that was even better for me, you know, and I started talking. That\u2019s\nhow I met my ex-husband, aboard ship.",
        "Q: And which language were you speaking?",
        "A: The -- I was speaking to them, I was speaking Danish and to the three guys, a little bit\nof Yiddish they knew, very little Yiddish, but we communicated. The Danes spoked\nEnglish, so they could translate. They were my translators. And I met my ex and I came\nto Canada, and --",
        "Q: To -- Before you get to Canada, did you have a little courtship on the boat, or how\nlong did it take?",

        "A: Well, for the first time, was really, you know, we -- we really rarely talked about what\nhappened to us. We just wanted to know what\u2019s going to happen, what\u2019s going to be our\nfuture, what are we going to do, how are we going to live. And -- And it took awhile til\nwe began. I mean, we didn\u2019t dwell on the horrible things that happened to us. It was more\nabout the now. What are we going to do now and so forth. Then, I got married and my\nbrother moved in with me and lived with me for awhile.",
        "Q: You got married in Canada?",
        "A: In Canada. In Toronto. And then, after we got married, it was very difficult to get me\nback into United States, because there was a McCowen Act Law. There was a\nimmigration that you had the quota for so many people they would let in. And I -- I\narrived and we got married in Janu -- Jan or Fe -- New Year\u2019s Day, we got married. And\nI arrived, I think to --",
        "Q: 1950.",
        "A: 1950, and I arrived in nine -- let me see. I arrived in May of 1950, I arrived to New\nYork.",
        "Q: Married?",
        "A: Yeah. By train, cause plane were too expensive. Trains were cheaper then.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t need a passport to get there, or did you?",
        "A: To United States?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: So what kind of a citizen were you considered?",
        "A: I was an alien. An alien citizen. I wa -- had no country.",
        "Q: Stateless?",
        "A: Stateless. So I had to get a -- and -- and I married -- I married a Canadian, so that was\neven a double whammy. But his parents vouched for me. They had to put certain amount\nof money in the bank, they had to show that bank account -- I still have those documents\n-- and all that, to bring me into United States, to vouch for me. And then, after he -- he\nwa -- he had one more year to finish college and after that, he -- he got an offer -- he is\nJewish educator -- he had an offer to come to Toronto to work for Talmuttor, which is a\nJewish day school, and we went back to Toronto and then my -- then my sister came to\nvisit. But my brother got -- then my brother started courting his wife Simmy and he got\nmarried and my sister came.",
        "Q: In Toronto?",
        "A: In Toronto.",
        "Q: So, your brother moved with you and your husband?",
        "A: No, my brother stayed in Toronto when I moved back, but when I moved back, after I\ngot married, he moved in with us.",
        "Q: All right. Can I just go back a little bit, to your first weeks and months of marriage.\nDid you and your husband talk about the Holocaust at all, with each other?",
        "A: Me and my husband?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Oh yeah. I think there was a special thing that he knew, you know -- I had a lot of\nfears. P\u2019ll never forget our honeymoon, I locked myself in the bathroom and wouldn\u2019t\ncome out, cause I was so scared of every little thing. Every new thing was the -- just a\nscary thing for me. But the most important thing is that I had lots of fears. I always\nlooked for an exit and to this day I still do that, where all the exits are, when I go into a\nmovie or anything. And I -- I -- I still have the same fears. I could never put like -- my\nfield is early childhood education and I started two preschools. One here and one in\nPhiladelphia. And when you put the -- you don\u2019t -- they don\u2019t do it now as much, but we\nused to [indecipherable] put like a child\u2019s name and put it around the neck so if we\nshouldn\u2019t lose them. I could never do that, because that\u2019s when people went for the firing\nsquads. Things like that and a lot of nightmares and so forth. He had lot of -- share of\nproblems that -- but our marriage didn\u2019t broke because of that, because --",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t that?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: Where was he during the Holocaust?",
        "A: He was in United States and he went -- in 1947, he went on to fight for state of Israel.",
        "Q: So, he had very strong --",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- was it --",
        "A: Comes from a very religious family.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Very Jewish, Zionist family.",
        "Q: Were you involved with Zionism at all, yourself?",
        "A: No, I really didn\u2019t know. I di -- I didn\u2019t know if my parents were Zionists or\nsomething. I know one thing, that my parents -- in my parents home, we had very modest\nhome in a little town and I can remember that we used to have little bags of earth and -- it\nwas -- came from Palestine, came from Israel, from the Holy Land, so the f-for when a\nperson is buried, the first shovel of that you brang from the Holy Land to put in the grave\nand every year there would come around a emissary from -- from Israel -- from Palestine\nthen, and would sell this. And we would have that and ou -- oh, you know, so there was\nconnection with Israel, with -- with the state of Israel. We had the JNF box, the -- that --\nthat -- over there, there is a li -- where you give for tadocker, you put in money and it\ngoes for Israel, you know. We always have that, we cose -- call it the pushka.",
        "Q: This is back in America now?",
        "A: No, that\u2019s back in the shtetl, we always had pushkas for this, to -- for charity, to give.\nBut there was all ones -- always for the -- Palestine, for the state of Israel. So, those are\nthe kind of links, whether they were active Zionism and so forth, they didn\u2019t -- they lived,\nthey didn\u2019t leave to go to Palestines.",
        "Q: Since we\u2019re on the subject of -- of Israel, I -- I think it would be interesting to ask this\nquestion and that is -- do you think that the founding of Israel has a meaning for\nHolocaust survivors in general?",
        "A: Oh, definitely. I feel, if there was a state of Israel, maybe this would not have\nhappened. I think that the fact is that Israel to me, is the most important thing. That it is\nthe protection for people and the in-gathering of the exiles that we were -- we had -- we --\nwe did not have a homeland. And I feel there was no one talking up for us. The rest of the\nworld really didn\u2019t care. They knew it was there, but they didn\u2019t do anything about it.",
        "Q: Including Jews in the rest of the world?",
        "A: Oh, I -- including the Jews in United States. I think that they were so 1-isolated and so\ninsulated and not only that, but there was fear here. The Jews had fear here, because there\nwas a Father Coglin who was on the radio constantly, telling [indecipherable] and was\nvery anti-Semitic in -- in the 30\u2019s and -- and in the 40\u2019s. There was a Nazi party and the\nfact that United States went into the war ver -- th -- I owe my life to them, that they\nliberated me, if 1t wouldn\u2019t be for United States, but at the same time, they went in so\nlate. And so, to me, Israel is s-s-stands there and -- and we must make Israel a strong\nnation. I don\u2019t like some of the politics what\u2019s going on in Israel today. That bothers me,\nbecause that\u2019s not the kind of state I would like to have.",
        "Q: What about it bothers you?",
        "A: Well, it bothers me that the equality is not there, that the --",
        "Q: Between?",
        "A: Between the religious and the non-religious. The fact that they, because I am not a\nultra Orthodox Jew, I am not considered Jewish to a lot of them. And that the state -- the\nstate has to be separation of religion and th-the poli -- you know, I think the politics in\nitself. And I think that, to me, peace is a long way off there. I try to go there about every\ntwo years, lately, to live there for about a month or two months. Basically, the people\nwant peace on both sides. But on both sides, there are hatred. And the Arabs have such\nhatred for the Jews. I mean, there used to be before it was all about Israel, now they\u2019re\nsaying Jews, they\u2019re hating Jews. And -- And it\u2019s a very difficult thing when I -- I -- I\nhave examples where I went to visit a very dear friend who lives there. American family,\nwent there very early and they\u2019ve lived there for a long time. Their kids grew up with the\nchildren whe -- in that little town where the interfadder started. And when the interfadder\nstarted, stones started flying through their window. And this is the kind of thing. Now, do\nyou give up that peace and -- and let it happen to you, with -- stones kill. It\u2019s a very, very\ndifficult situation there, but nevertheless, I feel that, as a Jew, I\u2019m very proud of Israel,\nwhat they have done. And I hope that there will be peace in Jerusalem. There\u2019Il be peace\nin Jerusalem, I\u2019ve always felt, will be peace in the world. Cause it takes in so many\nreligions and so many, it just everybody.",
        "Q: I find it so interesting that your family, even before the Holocaust, even before any\nawareness that there may be a Holocaust, was contributing to Israel. Can you tell me\nabout that? Was that common?",
        "A: Oh, it\u2019s very common. It\u2019s -- I mean, th-that part of the --",
        "Q: How did the word get around in Jewish communities?",
        "A: Well, because Palestine was our life. I mean, this was our -- this was in -- it\u2019s 1n -- in\nour -- part of our Torah, it\u2019s part in the -- we -- we -- we pray. We pray to Jerusalem. It\u2019s\nin our prayer book. If I forget the -- Jerusalem, let my right hand be cunning, you know.\nIt -- It was always there and we were always taught. And Hebrew was the language and --\nbut it was part and parcel of all of us. And it was the yearning of every Jew in the shtetls,\nin -- especially w-where I lived, in eastern Europe, in Lithuania, that someday we will go\nto -- I mean, we -- we have it in the seder, you know, when -- Passover, everything, that -\n- to be in Jerusalem. Next year in Jerusalem. It 1s -- and if you say how old the Bible is\nand how old is the prayer books, that\u2019s how old it is for the state of Israel.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t until the political state of Israel, but the state of Israel was there.",
        "Q: Now, what I -- we\u2019re -- we\u2019re just about to -- to get you some children.",
        "A: Some children.",
        "Q: From the first marriage.",
        "A: Yeah. I only have from the first marriage.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, could you say now -- you were living now in Toronto and Abe is working and you\nare working, too, or --",
        "A: No, I was -- at that time, I was just my ha -- my ex was working, I was just a\nhousewife, keeping the [indecipherable] my daughter was born in \u201851, so we had to --",
        "Q: And his job was?",
        "A: What?",

        "A: He was educational director at the synagogue.",

        "Q: Her name is?",
        "A: Mina. M -- named after my mother, and when my brother got married, my sister came\nwith her son, Oscar and he was -- at that time, he was three years old. And, the -- then she\ndecided she would stay and get a working permit, which she had, temporary, and she\ncould work --",
        "Q: Away from Denmark?",
        "A: Away from Denmark. Her husband stayed on in Denmark and to see if she likes it and\nif she does, they would move here, to us, cause I kept only wanting her to move. I mean,\nI just didn\u2019t want her being so far away. And -- but it was very difficult because we didn\u2019t\nhave the money to bring her over and -- and everything else, so is -- she stayed for almost\na year. I watched her little boy and my little -- my baby -- and Mina and she went to work\nand she\u2019s a seamstress and -- and collect these -- she used to come home with those little\ntickets, you know, how many buttons and how many that and we would sit there and\nfigure it out by the pennies, you know? This was years ago. And I\u2019m -- this was in 1950 -\n- 50 -- wait a minute, that was in 19 fif -- beginning of \u201851. No, what am I talking, n --\nthey are married December second of \u201851, yeah.",
        "Q: Do you remember how it felt when you -- when you -- did you no --",
        "A: He married a Canadian girl. Jewish Canadian. My brother.",
        "Q: Oh, your brother?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I -- I was thinking of Mina, your -- your first child, named after your mother, did -- the\nmoment when you knew you were pregnant, did you have any thoughts that went back to\nyour experience there, or --",
        "A: Well, I\u2019ve always felt that that -- always worried about what kind of world I\u2019m\nbringing in. After all, I -- I used to pinch myself all the time that here I am in Canada. It\u2019s\nlike United States. I can go into any store, if I have the money to buy whatever I want.\nI\u2019m -- don\u2019t have to be hungry. I can, you know, do anything I want to. I -- I can be\nproud. And the most important thing is -- was -- always 1s that I didn\u2019t have to look over\nmy back if I\u2019m lighting the Sabbath candles or 1f I\u2019m doing anything Jewish, this was\nwide open. And that was the biggest satisfaction in living here tuvusta. And I had a very\ndifficult pregnancy -- very di-difficult. I -- This was years ago, I too -- I found a Danish\ndoctor who I could speak Danish to and he was wonderful. And I had almost like three\ndays of very hard labor. And finally, when she was born, Ill never forget when I went\nback -- Dr. Williamson, I went back to him and he said, \u201cWell.\u201d And I ask him, \u201cWhen\ncan I have another child?\u201d And he looked at me, he says, \u201c[indecipherable],\u201d he said,\n\u201cBoy, you women, you -- do you remember how difficult?\u201d But then I had -- I had a -- a\nmiscar -- I had a stillborn child after that. That was very difficult to take, because those\nyears, they couldn\u2019t do anything, said it has to take it\u2019s natural causes and I was sick. And\nthen after that, my son Michael arrived. And was not easy, but was fine. And then\nDebbie. And they were three years apart and I just wanted to have a family, I -- not a lot\nof children, but I wanted to have more and more and then the third, you know, it wasn\u2019t\nreally like we planned it. We didn\u2019t plan it, whatever happened. And --",
        "Q: Are they -- the other second two named after any other relatives?",
        "A: Yeah, they\u2019re all named after relatives and they\u2019re all named Hebrew names and\nthey\u2019re all called by Hebrew names. I never liked to give them a Hebrew name or a\nJewish name and then call them a Danish -- a Danish or a -- my sister is different -- or a,\nyou know, an American name. I figure that\u2019s the name I gave them at birth --",
        "Q: So the second -- the boy --",
        "A: Michael, but the Hebrew name is Meechiel, which is Michael and Raphael is this --\nhis second name, the two angels. And my -- I remember asking my in-laws if they\nwanted to -- after all, the first one I named after my mother, was only that I should ask\nmy in-laws if -- who were very religious, now it\u2019s your turn to name, you know? And\nthey said no, they don\u2019t want to name after anyone. Was very interesting, because my\nfather-in-law\u2019s name was Jacob and my mother-in-law\u2019s name was Jacob. See my -- her\nfather was named Jacob. And if the two are the same, they usually have -- the namesake\nis usually carried after, you know, from the person passes away, you give the namesake,\nbut you can\u2019t give the namesake if the father is the same name. So, they had a lot of\ndifficulty when she was getting married and she told me that. I never heard of it before,\nbut she was very adamant that I should name a name that I liked, that the child will like\nwhen he\u2019s -- you know, and will able to carry that name proudly. So that -- and when\nDeborah came along, was -- I had a sister-in-law who was shot down. Their plane was\nshot down over Bulgaria. She was going to -- back to Israel, she was from Israel and her\nname was Debore-ore and so I named Debbie after that.",
        "Q: And Michael is named after?",

        "Q: Did your children learn about your and your -- your experiences in the Holocaust? Did\nyou have a way to share it, or --",
        "A: My children knew that I was a survivor, but a survivor of what and how and when and\nwhat was happening, they didn\u2019t know. They -- I never sat them down and told them that,\nyou know, I\u2019m a survivor and that they would ask me such questions, \u201cWhere is your m -\n- what happened to your mother?\u201d And I would say she died. And, \u201cHow did -- oh, wh-\nwhere did she die?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, in foul way.\u201d And I didn\u2019t even mention Stutthof,\nI would say foul way. I tried to shield them as much as possible that I could. I worked at\nthe children\u2019s camp in -- and -- called Camp Rama. It\u2019s a Hebrew speaking camp.",
        "Q: Where was this?",
        "A: This was in -- this particular incident was in the Poconos, but I worked -- they have\nseveral camps all over the country. And they would have me speak -- it\u2019s called,\nTishubov, it\u2019s when the -- the temple -- the second temple, when it was destroyed and it\u2019s\na holiday. It\u2019s a mourning holiday and they\u2019ve made it in -- really made it into memoral -\n- memorialized the Holocaust, Tishubov. And they would have me speak to the older\ncampers and my daughter was there and I remember speaking to them and not trying\nthem to -- traumatize them with real horrors, but [inaudible]. And my daughter came\nover, she says, \u201cMom, I don\u2019t believe, it\u2019s a lie.\u201d She just didn\u2019t believe me, she says,\n\u201cYou never told me.\u201d And she was 14 years old. And from then on, many things. They\nknew that I had no relatives. They knew that I would say certain things to them. In my\nhouse, you\u2019re not allowed to fight, you know. I\u2019ve had enough fighting. And -- But I\nwould come out with words like that, or that would say, \u201cWe do not throw out food.\nFood is sacred. If you don\u2019t eat this today, you\u2019re going to eat it tomorrow.\u201d And I\nwould, I would make them eat it tomorrow. If they were hung -- they say, \u201cWell, we\u2019re\nhungry.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s food you left yesterday, eat it.\u201d That\u2019s the thing I would\ndo. They told me that. They still tell me that.",
        "Q: You were learning English as well, during this time.",
        "A: Yeah, well, with my oldest daughter I spoke Yiddish. And it\u2019s -- was very interesting,\nshe went to Israel for her junior year at the Hebrew university and she wrote, \u201cGuess\nwhat? I\u2019m in advanced class of college Yiddish,\u201d because she knew Yiddish. She knew\nYiddish before she knew English. And -- But I learned English, I went to night school\nand I learned, and --",
        "Q: In Canada?",
        "A: Yeah. And I had to communicate with my ex, because he doesn\u2019t speak Yiddish. He\nwas -- he -- his parents were born here. My -- His mother was born in New York and his\nfather in Ottawa. And his grandparents were very young when they came over, so there\nwas no Yiddish spoken in their house. So, there was an older woman, I would go and she\nwould translate the English letters for me.",
        "Q: From?",
        "A: And she would s -- at the end, she would say, \u201cHe loves you, he loves you, he\u2019s going\nto marry you,\u201d at the end. And -- So she -- yeah, and she --",
        "Q: He was writing you from where?",

And English -- I mean, I don\u2019t -- Hebrew I understand some and I, you know, I read\nHebrew. Danish, interesting enough, when I went to Denmark, I -- after I was there for a\nday and a half I spoke it, but before that, I can understand. So, when I come to somebody\nhere in den -- fra -- whose Danish, I tell them, \u201cSpeak to me in Danish and I'll answer\nyou in English.\u201d It\u2019s hard, a language if you don\u2019t speak.

        "A: In -- In 1998, in June, three students at University of Soderon, California Graduate\nSchool -- film school -- took me back to Lithuania, to my little town, to the Kovno\nghetto, where I was, to Stutthof concentration camp and to Denmark, where I escaped\nfrom the Death March. And we completely -- did a complete walk through of wherever I\nwas and the film played here, a -- or -- 1t opened up for -- in \u201898, of September, oh, Labor\nDay weekend. And within a week, it was sold out, 686 seats were completely sold out\nand they had a fundraiser for Beyond Tolerance Center. It\u2019s been my dream to start a\nBeyond Tolerance. We were going to call it Tolerance Center, but tolerance, it means so\nmuch, it\u2019s just an ambiguous, you know, thing. So we calling it Beyond Tolerance. And,\nbecause I\u2019ve always felt -- because I go out and speak into schools all the time and\nwherever I go, that children need to be taught tolerance, from the very young age,\nespecially in the schools. And the schools don\u2019t have the money, so we got a whole group\nof people together here and who are funding it and it\u2019s part of the county school system.\nSo we have a one -- one is diversity, which 1s -- Scorbell Museum has a very good thing,\nit\u2019s called a diversity -- teaching for younger children.

And it was here for a month and a\nhalf and I want to tell you, was the best thing Santa Barbara ever had. And we brought\n10,000 students. I worked a year and a half on it, really got to know the school system\nand we brought that to Santa Barbara. We brought 36 th-thousand students downtown in\n-- where the exhibit were. We had a whole month of all kinds of things going in -- of\nteaching what racism and bigotry does. We had an incredible, credible program.",
        "Q: Focused strictly on Jewish life?",
        "A: It\u2019s -- no, it was a tea -- well, it was -- it went with the Anne Frank in the World\nexhibit. We included all faith communities. We included the Chumus Indian, which we\nhave a popul -- a sizable population. We found out that when we did that, that there were\ntwo Chumus Indians and they didn\u2019t talk to each other. Doing this, they began to talk to\neach other. So we did that. And we -- the African American community had their own\nprograms. We had programs -- completely diverse programs, but all teaching to\ntolerance. How to do away with hatred and bigotry. And it was a wonderful -- and my\ndaughter has paintings that she painted for the 50th anniversary. It\u2019s been going around\nall over the country. My daughter --",
        "Q: 50th anniversary?",
        "A: Of liberation. My -- She\u2019s my oldest, Mina, she lives in -- she\u2019s an artist, she lives in\nMendocino, California. And it\u2019s opening this -- opening in -- on February seventh, on my\nseven oh birthday. It\u2019s opening up and I\u2019m so happy my children are coming in, because\nit\u2019s my birthday.",
        "Q: Where is it opening?",
        "A: And it\u2019s opening at Abington Friends, in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania. And from there,\nit\u2019s going to go to the Sidwell School. Is it Sidewell or Sidwell School in Washington,\nDC. And it\u2019s going to be there, opening. It\u2019s also Quaker school. Supposed to be a real\nwonderful Quaker school. That\u2019s where Chelsea Clinton wanted to go. And then -- so I\nbeen going and I go out speaking wherever I\u2019m invited, I speak about -- but my field 1s\nearly childhood education.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what I wanted to ask you now --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- when you got your children and your education and your career goals, how did that\nunfold?",
        "A: Well, when we moved to ch -- to Rochester, New York, I still didn\u2019t -- I was rather\nnot well, I had a stillborn child, was a -- was -- and I was very -- not too well. So, I didn\u2019t\nworked. When we moved to Wilmington, Delaware, I was very involved in the\ncommunity. I was always involved in the community, always. If I knew there was\nsomething had to be done in --",
        "Q: At school, or --",
        "A: -- in a poor area, or whatever.",
        "Q: -- synagogue?",
        "A: A synagogue and a school, wherever I could. And wherever I could make myself\nunderstand, because my -- my English was still not the greatest. But when I -- in -- in\nPhiladelphia, I got really involved in the Civil Rights movement in Philadelphia. And --",
        "Q: What made you first -- how did you first know about it and how did you feel?",
        "A: Well, what happened was I was asked by a woman if -- who organizes, called the\npanel of American women. It was a group of women, and we went -- who went out to\nspeak and they spoke mostly how it was -- this was in the early 60\u2019s, like \u201861, how it is to\nlive in United States, as a Protestant, a Catholic and a Jewish person and a Native\nAmerican. And th-they asked me to be the Jewish person, and I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m very busy,\nI have\u201d -- I was busy in my synagogue, I was busy with Haddassah, which is woman\u2019s\ngroup, a Zionist organization, who take care of the hospitals in Israel. And I felt I really\ndid not have time, with three children and I was busy enough. I just didn\u2019t do anything.\nThen, I\u2019m sitting and watching the news and it was David Brinkley and John Chancellor,\ntalking about a group -- I mean, I love news -- about a group of people that congregated\nthemselves in front of a home that an African American family had moved into that\nhome. And it was called -- I don\u2019t even want to repeat it, of course. And taunting them,\nand it looked like 500 people. And the police standing, they aren\u2019t doing nothing. And\nfor me, it was like Kristallnacht, when people saw what was happening in Nazi Germany\nand nobody did anything. Everybody was just, you know, looking and doing nothing.\nWell, I wasn\u2019t going to do that. I felt that if that family -- the name of the people were\nBaker, if the Baker\u2019s weren\u2019t -- in Folcoff, Pennsylvania, which 1s near the airport -- if\ntheir home is not safe, my home is not safe. So I -- I got dressed and I -- I was --\nremember -- I was -- was sitting and took some cookies I had baked and I called a friend\nwho was involved with that panel, if she would come and go with me to the Bakers. They\nwere still trying to get me on that panel and those people were all I met through the\npublic school, through Henry School in Philadelphia. And I said, \u201cYes, I want to go.\u201d\nAnd we went. And I -- for the first time in the United States, I was in Philadelphia, in the\ncity of brotherly love, feeling this thing of hatred, when I was called white trash and\nthrowing things at me when we walked by. We parked the car at a distance. And I went\nto Sarah and Horace Baker, I -- I have lost contact since, with them. In fact, they are\ngoing to try to have a reunion with all of us when I\u2019m there, in Philadelphia. And from\nthen on, I called up the lady who was doing the panel was Lois Stalvy, and I said to her,\n\u201cLois, I want to be on the panel.\u201d And I started speaking out what was happening to me,\nthat ultimately this was going to be the result. And we spoke all over, all over. I\u2019ll never\nforget when I went to Columbia, Maryland, which was a brand new town that was just\nbuilt. And we were refused -- I was there with two African American women -- was\nrefused to be served, the guy would not serve us. And I walked up to him in my broken\nEnglish and -- I mean, my English, I told him, you know, \u201cWe\u2019re waiting long, where is\nthe food?\u201d And he said, \u201cI don\u2019t have tea, coffee, or anything for the likes like you.\u201d And\nI walked up and I remember having the water -- glasses of water, spilled out the water\nand I just -- and walked out. I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. We don\u2019t need this white trash.\u201d And I --\nyou know, and I walked out. Said it loud enough that everybody turned around. Then I\nmade a statement. And I went on and I felt that the Civil Rights movement was a si -- a\ntime in my life that I felt -- this was before even Martin Luther King, that it was a very,\nvery scary, that this is going to happen all over again. There were riots. There were all\nkinds of things that this is happening in the United States. I knew very little about the\nUnited States, even though I\u2019ve lived here already a few years. I -- I had just become a\ncitizen -- I had just become a citizen. It was -- Nixon was running for office. I was -- and\nhe lost, the first time he [indecipherable].",
        "Q: Who was president when you became a citizen?",
        "A: Harry Truman. And th-there was just so many things going on, that [break] judge\nasking me, and the question. You know, they ask you who -- who would become\npresident and -- oh, no, he was -- he -- Nix-Nixon, oh, I\u2019m sorry. When I came here,\nTruman was the -- but Nixon was the vice-president, so he was with who? With\nEisenhower.",
        "Q: Eisenhower.",
        "A: Eisenhower. Now Eisenhower, for me, was my idol, because he was my liberator. And\nwhen I heard his name -- to this day, when I see the American flag, I cry. I get tears in my\neyes. The -- The Star Spangled Banner is just the -- the greatest thing that -- greatest\npiece of music to my life. I mean that -- here they were. There is no country in the world\nlike United States. But I remember distinctly when the judge asked me, \u201cIf the president\ndies, who becomes the president?\u201d And I say, \u201cGod forbid, Nixon.\u201d And the judge said --\nPll never forget, the judge said, \u201cYou don\u2019t like Mr. Nixon?\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, I want Mr.\nEisenhower to live.\u201d He said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m a democrat.\u201d Ill never forget that, that was\nin Wilmington, Delaware.",
        "Q: Oh my God, you got the right judge. So now, you\u2019re --",
        "A: There, for the first time, I could go and vote.",
        "Q: And how did that feel?",
        "A: Oh, greatest thing. I think that people don\u2019t realize what we have in this country. That\nwe can do anything we want with the ballot. That one vote makes a difference. And I\ndon\u2019t think many people exercise that right. And that\u2019s why, it became, during Civil\nRights movement, so important for me -- every African American, every black person I\nmet, I\u2019d say, \u201cDid you vote? Are you registered to vote? If not, let\u2019s -- I\u2019m going to help\nyou.\u201d And I had a hard time doing it, because I was not -- you know, and\n[indecipherable] I was not even an -- a citizen myself, I couldn\u2019t -- I did -- started doing\nthat. And I just -- I just felt I had an incredible kinship with the Black person, because,\nyou see, the Black person never hurt me. I was never hurt by a Black person. I was hurt\nby a White Christian person. So they were a different people and why would they,\nbecause of -- because they were -- looked different than me, I couldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t\nunderstand that. And people would say to me, \u201cWell, you have to live here to -- to\nunderstand.\u201d So I guess -- but I couldn\u2019t believe that United States would be that racist.\nAnd so I began to speak out quite a bit on that. And I took on -- there were a lot of, you\nknow, the deniers and that, and -- and was hissed on and -- you know, and all the -- the --\nthe things during that time. And went into certain neighborhoods, which was very\ndangerous. I didn\u2019t even tell my ex where I was going. To -- To --",
        "Q: At this time your children --",
        "A: -- registering -- my children were still little and my children always thought that\nsomething is going to happen to me during that time. I know that my phone was bugged,\nbecause we had a police commissioner by the name of Rizzo and I would come home and\nI'd say, \u201cHello Mr. Rizzo, I live in your neighborhood.\u201d And he did, he lived in my\nneighborhood. And I said, \u201cPlease stop bugging my line. I\u2019m --\u201d I always telled to him,\n\u201cI\u2019m a caring person, I\u2019m not a subversive person.\u201d I used to go on and tell him all the\nthing. Anything I want to get off my chest, I would tell it into the phone.",
        "Q: Did you sense, at the same time in -- that Americans were anti-Semitic?",
        "A: Anti-Semitism here in this country 1s different than anti-Semitism that I experienced\nin Lithuania. In Lithuania, it\u2019s right out, anti-Semitism in the real [indecipherable]. They\nhate you and they\u2019re going to kill you. Don\u2019t say all, but even being back there with the\nfilm, they still talk candidly about hating the Jews. Even after so many years.",
        "Q: Even to you?",
        "A: Last year.",
        "Q: Did they say why\u201d?",
        "A: What did they say why? We are known as the Christ killers. And anti-Semitism -- you\nhave to remember, in Lithuania, in my little town or even in the big town, the synagogue\nis not there any more. There\u2019s not a single Jew in the towns -- town after town. The\nchurch is standing majestic. The synagogue was almost across the street, is not there, it\u2019s\na parking lot. But in that church, when I was just there -- I was there a couple of time, the\nlast six years, if the priest -- and it was quite almost weekly, would preach that the Jews\nare Christ killers, that the Jews killed Christ.",
        "Q: To this day?",
        "A: I\u2019m not talking now, I\u2019m not there, but I\u2019m talking when I was there, when I lived\nthere. In, say in the 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s, when I -- then it gave the people the right to go out\nand -- and kill and maim. If they killed -- if you were -- killed Christ our Lord, you\nshouldn\u2019t live. This is what that. Now, I don\u2019t think a priest is going to go in United\nStates and say that.",
        "Q: Do you see any kind of connection with this strong religious Christian right\nmovement?",
        "A: Oh, that frightens me. It frightens me -- it frightens me with the anti-abortionists. That\nthey can go out and maim and kill for their ideal, what they want? What they think is the\nright thing? What they think is moral? Is 1t moral to go out and kill a doctor, what\u2019s left\nfour little children behind? I mean, to go out -- those are the kind of things that worries\nme, yes. And that --",
        "Q: Do you see it get -- get that serious in -- a-again?",
        "A: If we -- it can, 1f we let it happen. And again, it goes back to the ballot box. Who we --\nWho we elect. And what\u2019s happening now in the country with Clinton, what\u2019s happening\nnow? We\u2019re the laughing stock of the world. 40 million dollars you give a man who\u2019s not\n-- I mean, how can it be so independent that it was all for the Republican party over the --\nhow can you have a person, give him that kind of money, to do whatever he wants to\nbring the president down? To me, it\u2019s scary. It is very s -- very scary. I mean, what he did\nis wrong, but he\u2019s the president of the United States, he had another years and a half or\ntwo years for the term. He\u2019s been a good president for the economy, for the people. I\nmean, this is between him and his wife. This is not betw -- and I think he lied because he\nwanted to protect his family. It\u2019s as simple as that.",
        "Q: They really laugh at us in Europe for this.",
        "A: Yeah, I mean he\u2019s -- everybody -- everyone, th -- all the presidents, they\u2019ve all had\nthat. And it -- I think that is because they are so powerful that people go towards it.",
        "Q: I -- I want to -- there\u2019s a -- a whole list of events and I want to go back to the Civil\nRights movement that there are several things that the Oral History department has put\ndown that I think I want you to look at and see if there\u2019s any -- anything there that you in\nparticular had experience. I don\u2019t know if you were here then.",
        "A: Well, I was here and I was glued to the television with the McCarthy era. It was a very\nfrightening time for me. It was a frightening time because it was scary that people were --\nyou were afraid to talk to your neighbor. You were afraid to say something before you\nwould get a summons. I mean, there were so many people who were being brought to\ntrial. The McCarthy era was a very, very, very difficult. The Korean war -- war is scary to\nme and my brother-in-law was -- my husband -- my ex-husband brother was in the\nKorean war and it was very scary, cause war 1s very scary. The Civil Rights movement, I\nfeel was the greatest thing that happened in United States, by changing the course of\nevents. I think it -- not only for the Black community, m -- as much it did for the White\ncommunity. And --",
        "Q: In what way\u201d?",
        "A: In what way? I think that we began to look at it that racism is wrong and bigotry is\nwrong. And I think that when people went to the south with the -- the buses, when they\nwent with the buses to register people, to see their hatred of the group of people who\nwere just [indecipherable] -- the Klan and -- and that -- that it\u2019s wrong. That if it can\nhappen in Germany and we allow this to flourish, it\u2019s going to happen here. And we\u2019re\ngoing to have to put a stop to it. But it\u2019s changed now. You have now a Farrakan, who to\nme is a demagogue. He\u2019s a -- He\u2019s a leader in -- in the Black community, but he still --\nwhy do you need -- get a leader -- the difference between him and Martin Luther King\nand Farrakan. I mean, you get a demagogue, who hates the Whites, hates everything,\nhates everybody. And Martin Luther King, to me, preached -- preached self respect, the\nsanctity of life and to be peaceful and to be -- with the ballot box, that we can elect\nofficials and I think when I went on the March on Washington, I'll never forget. It was\nthe hottest day, I remember. Saturday, we -- I stayed with a Black family for the first\ntime. Here I am a Jewish, religious girl. Brought my tuna fish and my piece of choller.",
        "Q: This was six -- in the 60\u2019s?",
        "A: This was \u201863. And I stayed and I'll never, never forget it. And I went and I heard, \u201cI\nHad a Dream.\u201d But I had met him before.",
        "Q: Well, tell me about this, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: I met him before. I lived in west Mount Airy in Philadelphia, Germantown, west\nMount Airy area, and -- and I was begin -- when I got involved with the panel of\nAmerican women, I met a lot of interesting people and there was Judge Raymond Pace\nAlexander. He was the first -- I believe, the first African American judge to be elected to\nthe Pennsylvania Supreme Court. And he wa -- I was walking my dog and he was\nwalking in the morning and he said, \u201cOh, why don\u2019t you come and have dinner with us?\u201d\nSo I came -- I went and I had dinner with them and --",
        "Q: With his family?",
        "A: Yeah, with his family. He said, \u201cI have a -- two -- two friends of mine are coming, one\nis a reverend and the other one, too,\u201d I think and -- and it turned out it was that -- di --\ndidn\u2019t I think so, he said, \u201cOh, but I know that you --\u201d because we\u2019ve been in several of\nthe fellowship commission and so forth and he saw I was eating fish and that. He said,\n\u201cT\u2019Il tell Sadie that you can onl --\u201d I said -- I said, \u201cJust some vegetables\n[indecipherable]\u201d So he -- when the dinner was served, Sadie, his wife said, \u201cJudy, I have\nvegetables, this is your -- this 1s the vegetables on the side. The rest of it you can\u2019t eat,\nit\u2019s chitlings.\u201d So they turned out 1t was Martin Luther King and Ralph Abernathy was\nthere that --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: And it was very interesting and then, I remember --",
        "Q: How many of you there?",
        "A: We were -- he was there, Sadie and him and there was, I think, two other people. I\ncan\u2019t remember. I think the Mitchells.",
        "Q: A very small dinner?",
        "A: Y -- Very small, yeah.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And -- And, so tell me what happened.",
        "A: So, he asked me, you know, want to know and -- and Raymond Pace Alexander told\nhim I\u2019m a Holocaust survivor and I\u2019m [indecipherable] with this panel of American\nwomen and we -- you know, told him all that. And he said, \u201cNo, tell me, why did you\ncome to United States and not Palestine?\u201d And I told him, I said, \u201cYou know, I would\nhave gone to Palestine. I had no intention coming to Canada if my brother didn\u2019t come to\nCanada. If he went to Palestine, I would have gone. Would have been -- ended up in\nPalestine.\u201d So -- And we were, you know, it was very interesting conversation, it was\nmore about Philadelphia. Philadelphia was just beginning to organize with OIC, with --\nthey felt that if they trained people --",
        "Q: OIC.",
        "A: OIC, which is -- I can\u2019t think what is [indecipherable]. It\u2019s was organized by -- oh, I\ncan\u2019t think of -- he was a minister who organized it, that if you take people and you train\nthem in skills, like mechanics and that, because they weren\u2019t going to go through college,\nand certain people that you would get them off the street and -- oh, 1t was Reverend\nSullivan\u2019s group, OIC. And they were talking about -- and I think they were there, he was\nthere. It was very interesting group, but it -- it is interesting that on the second time I\nheard him speak was at the Fellowship Commission, which I was involved a little bit in\nPhiladelphia. But the third time I went is when he did that, \u201cI Have a Dream.\u201d And to see\nall the thousands of people and to see all shades. I mean, this was not just Black people.\nTo me -- and to get the buses, I remember was -- I had to pay into the Urban League, I be\n-- you had to become a member of the Urban League. I don\u2019t know where the Urban\nLeague is now. And we all went on the bus and I went to -- with another friend, I went to\n-- because I didn\u2019t ride on the Sabbath, so I had to stay close by, I stayed in -- in the\ndistrict. And I had m-money, you know, with hotels _\u2014_so I -- so there were a lot of\nAfrican American families who put people up in their homes.",

        "A: Okay, so to me, being involved was that I felt that there was a quality, because we\nalway say, you know, and -- and some of the words we -- we say democracy, I mean, I\u2019ve\nalways felt that there 1s no such thing as a democracy. We just say the word democracy,\nbut a democracy\u2019s an utopia for -- to aspire to that democracy. And I feel that United\nStates is constantly working towards that end of a democracy of that. And that end of\nwhen it came with the Civil Rights movement, meaned for me that I am -- want to be part\nof that, to bring it forward. And then, of course, after that, became, you know, the\nVietnam War and --",

        "A: Oh, I -- I was very much involved. We organized a group called Northwest Interfaith\nMovement, where I lived. And where we had -- we began to have a -- a whole group of\nus and I think it still may be going on, where we met once a week and we took the New\nTestament and the Old Testament and we saw what was creating their anti-Semitism, all\nthe isms, you know. And we developed that. I went out to speak, I must -- at least twice,\nthree time a week, speaking to -- in Black churches, in Catholic schools, in -- in\nuniversities all over.

We were going to have a\nreunion in Philadelphia.

They say they\nalways knew, but I remember not sitting down and talking to them. How they knew, I\ndon\u2019t know. They knew. They knew, they had the feeling and so forth. And my brother\ncertainly never tells his kids -- anything that his kids know, I told them. And the same\nthing with my sister. And I was very protective of them. I did not want them growing up\nhere, to carrying my burden what I had. I was very protective of them, until a certain\npoint when they got older and they began to ask questions. I never -- when they asked me\na question, I told them. I remember when Eichmann was taken to Israel and my son came\nhome and they talked about it in school. And he said, \u201cIs Eichmann one of -- is Eichmann\nthe guy that killed your mother?\u201d And I said, \u201cHe killed many, and my mother was\namong them.\u201d Ill never -- that was the first time I said -- he was 12 years old.

And I\nremember meeting somebody and I was going out with that person, and that person was -\n- oh, was pretty well off. He had his own airplane and -- and was really, you know and I\nwas scared to death to get on the plane and everything. But he always berated his wife\nand after going out with him for a month or so -- he liked me, and he was get -- I figure,\nno, anybody can berate like that -- see, I didn\u2019t and I felt that -- so I stopped dating and\nthen I was so tired. I had no -- I didn\u2019t even want to go out anyplace, because used to\ncome Friday night, that was my Sabbath. I would literally sleep. I -- I -- I just collapse\nfrom exhaustion, because I also work Sunday. So, it was like from -- you know, from\nSunday at -- to Friday and then Sunday again, it start the whole thing.

        "A: Well --",
        "Q: -- say what-whatever comes to your mind.",
        "A: The Vietnam War, and I remem -- that was very difficult for me. The most difficult\npart was my son didn\u2019t have a high number and I was worried -- terribly worried about --\nof him being drafted. E -- E -- I had sleepless nights about it. My brother and my sister\nlive in Canada and you know there were a lot of people who went to Canada. And I was\nliterally, if it didn\u2019t stopped, I was thinking of moving back to Canada, cause I just could\nnot deal with that. And the scary part of the -- became even worse is when the Kent State\n-- [remember when the Kent State, with the shootings at Kent State, it was devastated. It\nwas very scary time. The new left movement, I didn\u2019t have that much of -- didn\u2019t -- busy.\nThe sexual revolution is -- the drugs and so forth. I think it was scary for me, the drug\nsituation, because here I was with two teenagers and I remember the kids used to love to\ncome to my house, his friends. And my son is -- played basketball and he was on the\nvarsity team, so all the kids would come. And rather than him going down to north\nPhiladelphia in a very not good neighborhood, we had a basketball court put in and he\nwould play at home. And I remember baking pies so they would all come in. And [Il\nnever forget this instance. I was running for my second job, teaching at congregation\nB\u2019nai Brith. [indecipherable] congregation B\u2019nai Brith, [indecipherable] on congregation\nin Philadelphia. And my daughter and my son, they were home and then there were like\nfour of Black kids who were playing basketball with him, who were on -- from Central\nHigh School. And I remember this friend of mine happened to come and drop off her\ndaughter. And she said, \u201cAre you kidding, you\u2019re going out and you\u2019re leaving four\nBlack kids with Michael and Debbie?\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy not?\u201d She would not leave her\ndaughter and that\u2019s why I remember I was devastated. Here is -- I trust my kids, in my\nown home. They were -- they are all the time in my house, I trusted them and here is --\nshe\u2019s trying to tell me that I\u2019m doing something wrong. And nothing happened. My kids\ngrew up in a very well integrated neighborhood of west Mount Airy. And I think they are\nbetter off, because they are better human beings today. They are very involved in their\nown communities, wherever they live and I\u2019m grateful that I gave them that kind of home\nto live in. So, the drug scene was very scared for me and I would say to them, \u201cIf you are\ncaught and smoking marijuana,\u201d -- which was that time, marijuana, \u201cand you\u2019re arrested,\nthere\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to bail you out. I work hard enough just to make you regular,\ndecent human beings and if it\u2019s against the law, then you shouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d I knew nothing\nabout it and so forth. And so that\u2019s -- that was it, you know, but thank God, my kids, I\ndon\u2019t know if they ever smoked marijuana or not, but I -- they\u2019ve never been in trouble\nwith the law, thank God. The feminist movement I had a hard time understanding. I\ncouldn\u2019t deal with, but I felt that because I was a single mother, I felt I should get equal\npay for what I did, for that I worked hard for it. I remember the assassination of Medgar\nEvers and I was devastated. How it could happen them, because he was by then, a real\nname in every community. And John F. Kennedy, I -- I felt that we will never know what\nhe -- kind of president he would have been, died too young and too violent. And Martin\nLuther King, he was -- he became my children\u2019s hero.",
        "Q: Can you remember --",

Larger in life, that they\ncould take him and that he went to a place to get better pay for ga -- people who were\ntaking out garbage -- and that he was killed like that. I thought Truman -- I loved\nTruman. I liked Eisenhower.",
        "Q: Why did you love Truman?",
        "A: Well, Truman was the United States. When I came here, he was the figure. He was the\npresident in United States. I was lucky to be here. It was like we used to say in -- in\nYiddish, a golden immadina. Or, to accept the gold you didn\u2019t see, this means th-the --\nthe grounds are paved with gold. It wasn\u2019t, but it didn\u2019t mean that, 1t meaned that I was\nfree, there was freedom and -- and that he was a -- spoke to the common man. Reagan,\nwhen he went to visit the gravesites of the German soldiers in Bittburg, I was at the\npreschool and I got a call from Jerry Rankin, who was the editor of the Santa Barbara\nNews Press, if I could say something as a Holocaust survivor, if I would say to Reagan.\nAnd the caption was, \u201cWhat does --\u201d Reagan lived far away from here, but it still said,\n\u201cWhat does --\u201d\u2019 No, the caption was, \u201cWhat does Reagan\u2019s neighbor thinks of him going\nto Bittburg\u201d. And I had plenty to say, and to me, why visit the perpetrators who killed --\nthe killers -- and not visit American soldiers who were killed saving the people? I\ncouldn\u2019t understand him. It just beyond me. It was just way beyond me that he could do\nsuch a thing.",
        "Q: Did you ever get an answer why he visited?",
        "A: No, no. But I -- I remember writing it to -- to him and to congressman and -- but I\nremember I was so hurt. I felt it a personal hurt that here is a president of the United\nStates, going to commemoration and going to Bittburg to honor the -- the soldiers -- to\nlay a wreath on the soldiers, well in the Americans he didn\u2019t. And that was just too -- too\ndifficult for me. I thought when the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum was\nestablished, I thought that was the greatest thing that happened. I thought, that has\nnothing to do because Jewish. That here is a museum, a federal museum that speaks to\nthe world what racism and bigotry does when it\u2019s allowed to flourish, and man\u2019s\ninhumanity to man. And it\u2019s still happening and I hope as many -- my -- what\u2019d I say --\nmy wish one day, is that it take all the leaders of the world -- all the leaders of the world\nand bring them in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and just show them\nand talk to them what happened and what\u2019s still happening in their countries. It is still\nhappening, except it 1s far away. And, I was very proud this year of my -- my youngest\ndaughter, when the Honduras flood, she called the Honduran embassy and she wanted to\nknow what can she do. I always used to tell my children, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what can I do,\nI\u2019m only one person.\u201d One person can do a lot. So she said, \u201cOh, you\u2019ll be proud of me.\u201d\nSo I said, \u201cWell, what\u2019d you do?\u201d She says, \u201cI called up the Honduras library, and I --\nembassy, and I said, Well, how -- what can I do to help?\u201d And they said, \u201cWell, we need\ndiapers, we need aspirin and formula.\u201d And she says, \u201cOh, I can do that, how do I ship\nit?\u201d They said, \u201cWell, if you have it in three days, we\u2019ll ship it for you.\u201d She said, in no\ntime at all, she had an auditorium full of things. What she did is she Xeroxed -- put a note\nout in all the schools to bring. People really want to help. They don\u2019t know how to do it,\nwe have to empower them to help. Because I think, basically, like Anne Frank said,\nbasically people are good at heart. They are. It just -- we have to just get out the goodness\nin them.",
        "Q: Excuse me. | -- I want to use this as a -- since you were talking about your daughter, is\nthis the same daughter who\u2019s the artist?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: This is another daughter?",
        "A: No, she is my youngest.",
        "Q: Could you say again about the daughter who\u2019s an artist and tell a little bit about what\nshe\u2019s doing --",
        "A: Well, ma --",
        "Q: -- [indecipherable] it relates to you.",
        "A: Yeah. My daughter started doing --",
        "Q: Which daughter 1s this?",
        "A: In Mendocino, Mina. She\u2019s the oldest and she\u2019s an artist and we always knew she was\ngoing to be an artist from the time she was a -- she was a toddler. She always liked to\ndraw and do things and put things together, collages and all kinds. She is -- does a\nmultimedia. She started saying stories that my mother told me and -- I'll have to show\nyou, and stories that my mother told me about. And she writes it about each painting that\nshe did, or each collage. Like sh -- about Hava. She tells the story about Hava and she has\na little shoe in the hand. She has one painting with shoes. She -- with real shoes. She\nalways used to collect shoes, I said, \u201cWhat do you need the shoes?\u201d She said, \u201cYou'll\nsee.\u201d And it\u2019s been going around to various schools all over the country, as long as they\npay for the shipping and so forth and she does a wonderful -- she -- she does the\nnarration, she has a -- what do you call it? She narrates -- you know, she does the talk\nabout what she does with the exhibit is, she\u2019s compared my mother to me and then from\nme to her and from her to her two daughters. And it\u2019s a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful\nexhibit. It\u2019s really -- it -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t been -- wherever it\u2019s been, it\u2019s been very well\nreceived. It\u2019s been twice already to Santa Barbara. And -- So it\u2019s opening up on February\nseventh, in -- with a reception and her being there, at Abington Friends, in Philadelphia.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a school?",
        "A: School. It\u2019s a Quaker school. And then it\u2019s going to another Quaker school, at the\nSidwell school or Sidewell. I don\u2019t know, Sidwell, in Washington, DC. And that\u2019s\nopening up, I think, for April fifth. So, I\u2019m very, very proud of my kids, of all my kids.\nAnd the film 1s -- is incredible what they did with the film. They got the si -- not only\nthat, we have Congressman Copps, who lived here. I used to come to speak to his classes\nat UCSB before he became a congressman. You may have heard about him. Most\nincredible man and he had the largest class, the largest auditorium on the university, 875\nstudents. And I would come twice to speak. And he was so wonderful to me, he -- I had -\n- came down with breast cancer and the day after I was operated, he called me and he\ngave me the schedule when I\u2019m going to be doing it. I said, \u201cOh, Dr. Copps,\u201d I says, \u201cI\ncan\u2019t even walk across the --\u201d \u201cYoull be here,\u201d and sure enough. So unfortunately, he\nbecame [indecipherable] he -- one -- first one time and he lost, the second time he won.\nTwo years into his term, at Dallas Airport, he had a heart attack and he died. So his wife\nrunned for his ticket and she got in and this, now -- she got in on her own, Lois Copps.\nAnd he speaks about me in the film. So they -- they filmed him like a couple of weeks\nbefore he died, the filmmakers. It\u2019s just a -- so she wants this film. This is her wish, to\nshow it at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and invite the congress to see\nit, because he was really loved. He was an incredible man.",
        "Q: This is the same film you\u2019ve discussed before?",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Thank you --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: In Danish.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And the filmmakers are?",
        "A: Laura Bialis, Sara Levy and Broderick Fox. But Laura Bialis is really -- she raised the\nmoney, she did everything. And now she\u2019s entering it into film festivals and it -- there is\ngoing to be an opening, I think, in LA, I don\u2019t know, in February, Stamford alumnis are\ngoing to have it. But, it\u2019s entered now into various film festivals and because it\u2019s entered\nin film festivals, you can\u2019t give it out too much, because there\u2019s a film festival here and\nthey are not sure they are going to take it, because it\u2019s already played. It\u2019s just -- so, for\nher, she\u2019s -- she\u2019s holding onto it for dear life and every day we get calls, please can we\nsee it. Because people couldn\u2019t get tickets. It was sold out in one week.",
        "Q: How does that make you feel?",
        "A: Makes me feel -- I don\u2019t want to say it makes me feel good, it makes me help to fulfill\nmy mission of tell the story, that I promised. We all -- especially the last two weeks. We\npromised each other that if we survived, we wouldn\u2019t forget each other, that we will\nremember each other. That we will tell the world what happened. To see that this doesn\u2019t\nhappen again. And it\u2019s still happening and it -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s very -- I\u2019m very devastated\nwhen I read what\u2019s happening in Algeria, how many people daily get slaughtered. And\nit\u2019s -- a lot of it has to do with just religious hatred now.",
        "Q: When you say we tell each other, do you mean your sister or do you mean something\nmore general?",
        "A: That -- That -- When we -- that -- the people used to say that we have to tell --\nwhoever survives has to tell the world what happened.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And because they are not here, I have -- I feel my mission is -- and I\u2019m -- I\u2019m going to\nbe 70 when the paintings open -- it\u2019s so happen it\u2019s opening up -- 1s -- how long do I have",
        "Q: [indecipherable] opening on your birthday\u201d?",
        "A: That\u2019s when the fil -- the paintings are opening, Mina\u2019s art painting.",
        "Q: I-In Philadelphia?",
        "A: Philadelphia.",
        "Q: How wonderful. And that\u2019s [indecipherable]",
        "A: On February seventh.",
        "Q: Seventh.",
        "A: So you know, it\u2019s all -- to me, I want -- before I go out of this world, I want to leave\nthis world a better world. I can\u2019t say about the world, but my community and where I\nlive. And it\u2019s -- and through my children, and hopefully my grandchildren, that this\ndoesn\u2019t happen, doesn\u2019t occur. That we can live side by side and respect the differences\nand because we\u2019re all made in the same image of God.",
        "Q: Yeah, that\u2019s interesting that there\u2019s so much religious hatred right now --",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: -- 1-in -- in this country, too.",
        "A: It\u2019s all over.",
        "Q: In this country.",
        "A: It -- It really 1s, and it scares me. The fundamentalist groups are scaring me.",
        "Q: You know what scares me?",
        "A: Because their tunnel vision, they can only see thems -- what they are -- is -- they don\u2019t\ncare about anybody el -- and what is happening with the abortionist group -- with the\nanti-abortionists, is -- is the right to life or is -- they only see from conception to birth.\nAfterwards, they don\u2019t care what happens to them. They don\u2019t. I mean, there\u2019s so many --\nso much suffering and hunger and -- and squalor people leave.",
        "Q: And yet, you say you weren\u2019t connected with the Feminist movement, but that\u2019s very\nmuch about women\u2019s rights.",
        "A: Well, I -- yeah, in that sense, I am. I\u2019m not the one if I -- to, you know, to have -- to\nbe -- in the beginning -- I think the -- the Feminist movement got such a bum rap is that\nthey didn\u2019t want men to open up doors, you know, and this kind nitty gritty. I -- I don\u2019t\nmind if man opens up the doors or, you know, or -- or picks -- or takes my bundle and --\nwh -- I don\u2019t need it. To me, the most important thing is that we get equal pay and that\nwe have a right to our own body. It\u2019s very important. And I think that the biggest difficult\nbecause of that is that there are not -- because I am breast cancer and thank God I\u2019m in\nremission is that there is so little studies done about women, there are more about men,\nbecause it\u2019s a man\u2019s world. And I think we\u2019re now realizing it, how little it\u2019s been studied\nabout women illnesses. It\u2019s been more about men. And that -- for that I -- I am, if -- if\nyou call it Feminist, I don\u2019t know, I think it\u2019s just the di-direction I want to go, this\ncountry to equality.",
        "Q: Equal rights.",
        "A: Equal rights under the law and -- and -- okay. Oh, 48, that was -- I can tell you, I\nwasn\u2019t in Denmark. I\u2019ll never forget when the state of Israel was created. It was just\nincredible that we had a state. In 1947, Israel was partitioned by the UN, to live side by\nside, that\u2019s what right now is going on, but they want to live side by side. 21 nations,\nsurrounding Arab nation declared war on Israel and Israel was isolated and fought that\nwar and it so ironically, now we are -- right now, we are fighting -- they want the same\nthing what happened. But look what happened. The Arab nation -- the League of Arab\nNations, said to all the Arabs, \u201cFlee. Leave Israel and go fight against Israel.\u201d And Israel\nsaid, Ben-Gurion said, \u201cStay, you will live side by side with us.\u201d But they didn\u2019t. So now,\nit\u2019s happening, the Intifada -- I spoke to -- when I was in Israel, to a couple of young\npeople, soldiers. The worst part is to be sent into the area, to the occupied area, because\nchildren, they are fighting and children throw stones and stones kill. So it\u2019s not a real\nwar, but it\u2019s there and I think that the only way that it\u2019s going to be -- peace will come, 1s\nif Yasser Arafat outlaws Hamas and all the rhetoric of hatred and then Israel does the\nsame thing of hatred against, but -- but Israel don\u2019t go and blow buses up with children.\nThey may use harsh words, but they don\u2019t blow up buses with children -- with innocent\nchildren. Hamas and the Palestinians have -- I don\u2019t [indecipherable] say the Palestinians,\nthey\u2019ve been blowing up -- how do you negotiate peace with a suicide bomber? You\ncan\u2019t. You can -- you can do it with a leader, but a suicide bomber only knows one thing.\nHe\u2019s going to kill themselves, because he\u2019s going to go to heaven and blows up, yeah.\nIt\u2019s wrong for Israel to blow up houses, too, if they find that they have been members of\nHamas or something. It\u2019s wrong in both side. But still, I think that the most difficult thing\nthat I think 1s happening is, that if -- that nothing is going to happen until this hatred --\nyou don\u2019t have to love each other, but you have to be able to tolerate each other, to live\nside by side. But if you\u2019re going to have nothing but hatred, it\u2019s not going to happen. I\ndon\u2019t know, what do you think?",
        "Q: Now, we\u2019ve taken a break, but I -- I just happened to mention to you about the child --\nyou told me about a child survivor\u2019s group, are you --",
        "A: Yeah, there is an international children -- child survivor\u2019s group. For years, I -- when I\nwould say to my sister, you know, this and this, she says, \u201cNo, it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d I said,\n\u201cWhat do you mean it didn\u2019t happen?\u201d Then she would say, \u201cHow do you remember, you\nwere only a child.\u201d And it used to bother me all the time, she would come out with that.\nAnd, so when I heard that there was a child survivor\u2019s group, the one -- and it -- from all\nthe places, 1t was one near here, in Oxnard, we went and the energy of those people was\nincredible. Is somebody here? Fred?",
        "Q: Yeah, he\u2019s there.",
        "A: Oh. It was incredible. Most of them, physicians, attorneys, you know, higher\neducation. The most wonderful group of people. So I\u2019ve been going this wee -- past --\nand this -- in September I went to Washington, they had a conference. The next one 1s in\nPrague. Oh, I would -- never been to -- I\u2019ve always want to go to Prague. So, they have a\nregion -- Hm?",
        "Q: [indecipherable] center, their -- their headquarters?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s very interesting, they just broke off in two groups, so the -- the santa -- the --\nthere\u2019s none in Santa Barbara, there\u2019s one in LA and I don\u2019t really go there. I tell you, to\ngo into LA with the traffic, I hate that traffic.",
        "Q: What is the name? I want to tell --",
        "A: It\u2019s Child Survivors inter -- Fred?\nA2: Yeah?",
        "A: The -- The child survivor\u2019s group, what is it called, the real name? What\u2019s the -- I me -",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, you what?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t talk to -- tell you, I went back in \u201893 with a group called the s -- the Crusaders.\nThey\u2019re owned by Buena Vista Film, which is owned by DisneyWorld. They took me\nback to Stutthof concentration camp for the first time. They want it to come out when\nSchindler\u2019s List was showing. They wanted to show that they were at the concentration\ncamps and by a fluke -- how -- it\u2019s a long story how they got to me, and they took me and\nmy grandson and my son back. And they made three 10 minute tape. They took 18 two\nhour tapes and they only edited out three. And the rest of it they shelved, I never got it.\nBut this -- the documentary that I talk about, that was done. That\u2019s a whole documentary.\nSo I have the 10 minutes, if you want. But this is what I got from the B\u2019nai Brith -- from\nthe Anti-Defamation League. You know anything about the Anti-Defamation League?",
        "Q: Yes, I do a little bit.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Could you tell us what the -- what the --",
        "A: Well, the anti --",
        "Q: -- what the award is?",
        "A: The award is for -- they gave me as the Outstanding Woman of the Year,\nDistinguished Community Service award.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It all went with it and then they made me a local hero in \u201895, but I\u2019m always doing\nsomething.",
        "Q: And what is this?",
        "A: This 1s the -- that whole weekend, when they honored me for that, the county, I got --\noh, this I got an honor for the county for what I do for the county and -- and different\nthings.",
        "Q: And over here too, Santa Barbara --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: That\u2019s wonderful.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I keep getting every once in awhile. But my grandchildren I should have\nmentioned, yeah. I have six wonderful grandchildren. The seventh is my husband\u2019s\ngranddaughter. And I have, it\u2019s Aaron and Benjamin and Ilana and Yaelle and Seth and\nJennifer. And I wish they were -- lived here. I don\u2019t get to see them that often, but they\nare all wonderful. And they know my story.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Oh, do they know my story. Because I speak to their schools when I go there and\nyeah, they know.",
        "Q: So things are more open than they were --",
        "A: Oh yeah --",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a very [indecipherable]",
        "A: It\u2019s different with grandchildren and that. They are like your bank account, you know,\nyour dividends, you know. They say the reason grandchildren and grandparent get along\nso beautiful is because they have one -- a common enemy, the parent.",
        "Q: That\u2019s cute.",
        "A: But we\u2019re very close, they\u2019re wonderful. And I going to go and get to see them on my\nbirthday, they\u2019re all coming in.",
        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s wonderful.",
        "A: I hope the weather [indecipherable] does something nice and just --",
        "Q: Did you say that? I mean, I asked [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, I keep a kosher home. I\u2019ve always kept a kosher home. I eat out only fish when\nI go out. I -- But my house is strictly kosher. I live -- unfortunately in Santa Barbara\nwhere I live, 1t does not have any kosher butcher. I have to go to Los Angeles to get my --\nmy chicken and we don\u2019t eat meat much, but my chicken and whatever kosher things I\nhave. When I first came here to Santa Barbara they had absolutely nothing and I went to\nVons, who is our supermarket and this and I started getting in -- they started getting in\nsome frozen chickens and some other products and now they have quite a bit. Also\nbagels. There were only one bagel place, it was horrible bagel. Now, we have so many\nbagel places. But we -- Iam so lucky that I live here in Santa Barbara, it\u2019s paradise, it\u2019s\nwonderful. And I am -- I am on eight boards. I am on the hello board. I am -- was asked\nto be trustee on the most wonderful, wonderful things -- Santa Barbara Jewish\nCommunity Foundation, where we help people -- Jews. And we help people, we send\nkids to camps, various camps of their choice. And I\u2019m sort of their idea person, but\n[indecipherable] to. And I\u2019m program chairman for Haddassah and let me see, what else?\nOh, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just in -- in the community, I\u2019m very involved and my big things is\nthat I do go out and speak a lot and it takes a lot out of me. And I\u2019m -- built the preschool\nhere with -- started with six children. When I left and retired, there were 60 children on\nthe waiting list. So, they -- hopefully they\u2019re going to build and add a bigger place so\nthey have more room. And I\u2019m very, very involved.",

        "A: After you leave I\u2019Il remember I didn\u2019t say that.",
        "Q: Is it painful, do you think, to tell your story, or telling the story more of a -- you say\nhealing will never be complete, but 1s it --",
        "A: I think the story is -- helps me in a sense that I can get the message out and that I feel\nthat maybe there will be somebody listening. The biggest thing I had last year, was I\nspoke at a large Catholic high school, in one of the largest here, real, real big one. And it\nwas 11th graders. And I was going out to my car in the parking lot and this young man,\nhe looked like a man, you know, the 11th grade, tall guy. He said, \u201cMrs. Meisel, I want\nreally to thank you for coming to my school. I was going to join a group -- I don\u2019t know,\nthey hate Latinos, they hate Jews, they hate Blacks and they call themselves skinheads, I\ndon\u2019t know if they are skinheads, but after I heard you today, I\u2019m not going to join.\u201d And\nif I saved one life, I\u2019ve saved the world. And that\u2019s -- to me, 1s very important. So those\nare the treasures that I treasure when I go out. Be-Believe me, it\u2019s not easy. So -- and the\ndeniers are out there, saying that this never happened and you can\u2019t debate them, cause\nit\u2019s not debatable. It\u2019s the same people who would say that there was never slavery here\nin this country and it\u2019s the same people who hate everyone, it\u2019s just full of hatred.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nConclusion of Interview\n"

We were -- she knew we were kriggskafangener, which was refugees that\nwere under the -- you know, they didn\u2019t know we were Jewish and we worked as slave\nlabor, you know. And -- And we worked there and it -- she was just horrible -- just\nhorrible. Had 11 children. And every night was a ritual, whatever was leftover from her\nchildren, she would tie our hands behind our back, so we would amuse her children,\neating on our knees. And if we did -- if they didn\u2019t laugh enough or amuse them enough -\n- was a ritual for her -- she would beat us. And on Sunday, would take us to church,\nwhich -- she had one dress, we would put on that dress, I -- and go with her to church.\nAnd I just went back there, the first time -- I was back there now twice, which in the last\nsix years, and the first time I was back, I couldn\u2019t believe I found the place. They\nchanged it a little bit, they made -- you know, but this was the place where we were.",
        "A: It\u2019s called Misucheva. It\u2019s 80 kilometers from Danzig. It\u2019s near Stutthof. And I -- I\nfound the place and it was just -- just incredible to g -- relive to s -- wi-with the place.\nAnd with her, wh-when they -- in -- was in 1945, he ha -- it was around March, we --\nthey were evacuating all the people from the area and we sailed with her and we were\ntold -- she told us -- this is the story that she said, that if -- we didn\u2019t want to go with her,\nbut if we didn\u2019t that they would let out the sewers, they\u2019re letting the sewers out and\nflooding the whole area, which is near Gdansk, which is a large port. And so we left and\nwe went to Denmark with her. And as soon as we went into the harbor, we were\ntorpedoed, the boat torpedoed. And we were -- I don\u2019t know how long I was in the -- in\nthe -- in the sea. You know, it\u2019s the North Sea there, Atlantic.",
        "A: At that time, I was fiftee -- no, I was 16 years old. And so she w -- from then, we lost\nher. We didn\u2019t know -- she enda -- she survived the dr -- she wasn\u2019t drowned and we\nwere in the water, I have no idea how long. I was so numb that when they picked me up,\nthey wrapped me in blankets, I was -- my sister and me, we held up on a plank. To this\nday, I don\u2019t swim -- and --",
        "A: In the water. The boat sank that we started out from Danzig.",
        "A: And the -- then, from there, they took us with a small boat, all the G-Germans -- this\nwas, you know, now it\u2019s Poland, but at that time it was Germany and they took us to the -\n- to Denmark. And when we arrived in Denmark, they put us in -- in a gymnasium.",
        "A: Yeah, the Germans. But they didn\u2019t know we were Jewish. They were -- took us with\nMrs. Unstrom, but they picked up all the people and they took us to Denmark. They put\nus in a big auditorium. and we could go out now, for the first time. We could go out and -\n- as long as we came back by dusk.",
        "A: It was a school and it was -- the place was called -- the little town was called Svininga,\nin Denmark.",
        "A: We were separated from Mrs. Unstrom, but we found out that she survived and five of\nher kids drowned. And it was very interesting, there was a trial in Denmark, because we -\n- well, I don\u2019t know, do you want me to talk about that? Well, when we came to -- to\nDenmark, on May fifth, 1945, Ill never forget the day we were liberated, the war was\nover, yeah. Actually, the very end of March, it was like maybe the 30th of March, so -- so\nI was only maybe five weeks later. Five weeks later, du-during that five weeks, before\nliberation, we didn\u2019t do anything, we were just -- could go on the street. We could -- had\nto stay in the little town. We could walk around and as long as we came back by dusk.\nAnd we were all in this big auditortum and I remember one day we were walking, my\nsister and I and there was a woman working in the fields and we asked her, \u201cAre there\nany Jews here?\u201d And she said, \u201cWhen you Germans --\u201d she thought we were Germans --\n\u201cWhen you Germans are going to be in concentration camps, the Jews will come back\nfrom Sweden.\u201d And we were afraid to start asking her more -- for more information\nbecause we thought, at that time, that we were the only two Jews, that we were going to\nsurvive. And that was very important to us, because before we got to Mrs. Unstrom, we --\nwe -- when we first escaped -- you probably have that on the tape, no? When we first\nescaped, the -- what happened is they took us out of Stutthof. And that was the end of\nDecember or the very beginning of January and in that -- that I can say that is because the\nChristmas trees were still in the people\u2019s homes. So we knew it was around that time. We\ndidn\u2019t know exactly the dates and so forth. And as soon as we wa -- we walk a whole day\n-- my sister was so sick with typhus. By then, already, my mother was taken into the gas\nchamber. I was with her inside the gas chamber and that, you have that, I\u2019m sure, on the\ntape. And I had absolutely -- I could hardly walk, but I really had such a strong sense that\nI wanted to survive, because I felt someone has to tell what happened. Because the mo-\nmost difficult part of it was that we all thought none of us will come out alive and there\nwill be no one to talk about, no one to tell anything, nobody will know. And we all\nvowed ourselves that we will tell -- whoever survives will remember and we will tell and\nthat\u2019s why I was back a couple of times to Stutthof. It just -- I feel that everybody there\nwas my family, and that I have to go -- as painful as it is, I have to go out to tell. So we --\nmy sister -- I was dragging her and she keeps saying, \u201cI can\u2019t go on.\u201d She was -- she had\ntyphus. Just right then, she had gotten typhus. And I kept saying, \u201cWe will live, we will\nlive.\u201d And I kept egging on and all of a sudden, the sky opened up and the bombs started\nto fall and everybody started to run, everybody started to run. And I had no energy. I just\nfell into a ditch with an -- there was another woman, Luba, who was helping me. She was\nholding me up. I don\u2019t know who was holding who, we were all three. And we saw a\nhouse and we walked across the house and we knocked on the door. And the woman\nopened up the door and as if she knew we were coming and we were wearing the striped\ndress with the clogs and [indecipherable] the wind was howling, it was a big storm. And\nshe quickly tore off, and we were now standing naked in front of her -- tore off our\nclothes and gave us clothing and told to the Russiansaw who was working there, he was a\nprisoner of war, that we are -- to taken us to the Umschlagplatz to be killed. And that\u2019s\nwhere they took all the people, to the Umschlagplatz to be killed. And they gave us some\nfood and oh, I was so sick from just having the first -- you know, real food. And we\nstayed there a couple of hours, til night time. And h-he sat there and she gave us a shawl\nand clothes and gave us some food and she told him to take us to the Umschlagplatz.\nWhy she did it -- you know, my sister always says, \u201cYou gave -- give that woman credit\nthat she saved our lives.\u201d And I said, \u201cYeah, because if she hadn\u2019t taken off the clothes\nfrom us and if she hasn\u2019t told the soldier to take us, where he saved our lives.\u201d What he\ndid was, we went out and Luba, who could not longer go -- she was much older and we\nwere and she said she was going to remain there. And when I was just back there, I found\nout that she died and they buried her right there in the farm. And so, anyways, we went\nwith this so -- Russian guy and he said, \u201cI\u2019m not taking you to the Umschlagplatz. What\nI\u2019m going to do 1s -- is I\u2019m going to -- I\u2019m going to take you to the nearest point where\nit\u2019s frozen.\u201d It\u2019s called the vikes -- it was called the Vikesel, now it\u2019s the Vistula river.\nAnd -- the narrowest point and wi -- and he was on the horse, he was making tracks and\nwe were following him. And he said to call on all our force. If it\u2019s wet, we will drown,\nbecause that means that the ice is broken. And we should do it at night so nobody detect\nus. And all night long, we were crawling across. Th-They just filmed it and the film of\nthere, you know, it was beautiful, you know, in the summer and that. And we got across\non the other side and he told us to go to a convent. Th-The nuns w -- an -- but we should\nsay we are not Jewish, we should say --",
        "A: This 1s -- we were speaking to him -- my sister knew Russian, because we lived under\nStalin for a few years. And -- but this was -- they were all speaking German. Now, it\u2019s\nPoland, but then it was Germany, was East Germany. So, what happened 1s we -- we --\nmy name became from Udit -- Uta. Beker is a German name. And hers, from Wachal\nbecame Anna and we were now were wandering and we got to the -- to the convent and\nthe nuns were wonderful to -- but they knew.",
        "A: The river was frozen. We crawled across the river all night long and we are able to go\non the other side. And he said to go to the -- on the other side. The river divided so it was\n-- where Stutthof was, was on one side and da -- and the road -- there is a bridge now that\nyou can go over, is -- but it\u2019s really frozen because they have horses going across, I\nmean, that particular year, it was frozen. That was also when they attacked Russia and\nthey couldn\u2019t do it, because the winter was so s-severe. And we are talking of the year of\n1944 -- \u201845. And so, we -- she -- and we got into the convent. The convent, the nuns were\nwonderful, they washed us, they bathed us, they took care of us. And my sister\u2019s typhus\ngot better, but I got sick. And they said to us that we cannot -- they cannot keep us. They\nknew we were Jewish -- that we would have to -- they would have to baptize us. We\u2019d\nhave to convert. And that we didn\u2019t want. It was the most important thing. The more they\nsaid they would do it, which in -- few days we decided we will not stay there. We were --\nwe talk about it now, how foolish we were. But we didn\u2019t know what that meaned,\nconversion and we, only to survive, to -- wanted to survive as Jews. We wanted to tell the\nworld what happened as Jews. We didn\u2019t want to be Catholics or anything else. So we\nleft and my sister -- and I was very, very sick, the -- again we met another Russian,\nbecause the Russian liberated that area and there were lot of fighting and took me to\nDanzig and left me on the steps of the hospital. And my sister said, \u201cYou can\u2019t say a\nword, you s -- you\u2019re stoom, you\u2019re no -- no -- don\u2019t make -- you know, don\u2019t talk.\u201d And\nshe, without realizing it, crossed the bridge and went back to the same place near there --\nnear Stutthof, without realizing it. Because when I was just there, I\u2019ve realize how close it\nis to Stutthof. She went to the bridge and they told her that there is a place there -- she\ndidn\u2019t know from Wehrmacht, from what, you know, she didn\u2019t know of that -- that they\nare looking for work -- that they need workers. So, we wen -- she worked -- went into a\nWehrmacht station, which is -- you know, the German army, where they get all their --\nand thats was Mrs. Unstrom, that\u2019s what she had. She had this huge, huge house and she\nwas running like a hotel, or -- you know, for -- a stopover for the Wehrmacht -- for the\nGerman army to come. And when we worked -- and then, when I get better, she came\nand -- and got me back to the -- to the house where she worked. And it happened so fast,\nit happened within weeks, with the period of week. I was in the hospital, I think, for two\nweeks. She came and picked me up and we were there maybe 10 days on that farm and\nthen we sailed for Denmark. But those 10 days was just horrifying, horrifying days, beca",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Well, why -- why did they kill the million and a half children and a million -- 11\nmillion people, six million Jews, why? I mean, she was German, her husband was in the\nSS. She -- She was real Nazi and -- and th-the people that are living around Stutthof right\nnow, and I went into a couple of houses and interviewed them and asked them, did -- did\nyou know what happened in Stutthof and they said yes. But, I\u2019m talking the people who\nwere, at that time, 18 - 20. I mean, they\u2019re in their 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, you know, and it\u2019s -- the\nolder people. And they said, \u201cYeah, we knew.\u201d \u201cWhat did you do about?\u201d \u201cWhat --\nWhat can I do? They were our enemies, the Jews, the Slavs, they had to be\nexterminated.\u201d And, you know, it\u2019s -- was something, a matter of -- of fact. This was\nwhat was supposed to happen to them.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: Concentration camp.",
        "A: Well, when we first came from the ghetto -- when we were taken t -- from the ghetto,\nit was around July in the ghetto and we had to line up. First we had to take off whatever\nwe had, our clothes and everything and -- and just throw it in the piles. And [ll never\nforget when I first came in, the piles of shoes and combs and toothbrushes and you name\nit, they had it there. And I kept saying to my mother, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d And she said,\n\u201cT have no answer.\u201d And then they told us to get undressed. The first one to get undressed\nwas my mother. When I think of how many times she had to stand naked in front of those\nbeasts. She was such a beautiful, religious woman, gorgeous woman and had to be just\nlike this, before they even killed you. What -- the humiliation that -- having to see what\nthey are doing to her children. So my mother and my sister and my mother, she had gold\ndenture, they just simply yanked it out. And her whole face was full of blood. And they\nthrew her a striped dress, the Kapo lady threw a dress and a pair of clogs and pushed her\non the side. And then my sister and then me. And I had long, curly hair -- blonde, curly\nhair. And they used to call me Shirley Temple, because Shirley Temple had -- did I know\nwho Shirley Temple? But they used to -- you know, [indecipherable] she looks like\nShirley Temple, they used say. And the Gestapo lady, on one side, tore out my -- the long\nlocks and the guy -- big, black boots who -- who it was the commandant, took out and he\nsaid, \u201cOh, this\u2019Il do for my poopy, for my dolls -- daughter\u2019s doll,\u201d in German. And then\nthey continued cutting it and that and my whole head was full of blood. Then, the next\none had to get undressed, her name is Hava. And my sister -- my daughter is an artist and\nshe has paintings going around, all over the country and she has a painting about this. S --\nIt\u2019s about stories my mother told me and she depict this Hava so incredible. And when I\nwent back to -- to Stutthof, Hava is always with me. I\u2019Il tell you why. Hava got\nundressed, she was wearing a loose dress. And when she -- by the way, when my mother\ngot undressed, my mother had sewn 1n, in her -- a pouch in my sister\u2019s and mine, like\nlittle pouches. She didn\u2019t even let us know she did that. She put it -- sewed it in, because\nshe thought -- there was some rings, there was diamond rings, some watch, some jewelry\nand some rings and whatever she had, so she put it in, she cushioned it. When we took it\nout, it fell all over and we never got it. Hava took off her dress and a little baby fell out.\nThe baby -- I -- a tiny, little baby, because gave such a little squeak and he picked up the\nbaby and he threw it. And -- the commandant. And, so those are the memory when I went\nto Stutthof, Hava. So, anyways, whens -- we got into the bunk -- to the barrack, and my\nmother was on top and I was in the middle with Hava, my mother was on top with my\nsister Rachel. And Hava would rub my -- like this with her fist, my hand. And I would\nsay to her, \u201cWhat do you have in your fist?\u201d And she never answered. And we would all\nsay, \u201cHava, what do you have? What do you have?\u201d She had a little baby\u2019s shoes, when\nthey took -- and because she wouldn\u2019t give up the shoe, they took her out. We all had to\nstand outside and watch and they put a bullet through her head. So that\u2019s Hava\u2019s story.\nAnd I have to tell it, because there\u2019s nobody else for her to talk. I\u2019m sorry.\n[indecipherable |",

And from there they took us to Stutthof concentration camp. And at\nStutthof my brother was taken from us and we didn\u2019t know where they were taking him.\nAnd we didn\u2019t find out until 1947 that he was alive, and he was in Italy, that he was in\nDachau.",

I don\u2019t remember a lot of their names, but I can see\ntheir faces, I was with. They\u2019re constantly with me and when my first grandchild was\nborn, I remember when I held him, I held him for all the children that didn\u2019t survived.",

I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have no guilt.\u201d I feel I had mazel -- I had the luck that I\nsurvived and because I survived, I have a mission that I have to tell and wherever I\u2019m\ninvited, I go out and I speak as long as they pay my -- my fare or a hotel, I go out to\nspeak. And I\u2019ve gone to places like Lubec, Texas and -- and -- and Livington, New\nMexico and places like that, you know. Because I feel the scary thing is that the deniers\nare out there.

        "A: Oh yeah. I mean, we lived -- from the time I was born in a little shtetl, I guess, from\nwhat I remember, we had a real Jewish life. I mean, my mother was very, very religious\nand my father, too. N-Not as -- from what I hear from my brother and my sister -- I\u2019m the\nyoungest in the family -- that she was more than him.

        "A: Oh, the first thing when we did, is they put us into showers. Before they took us to\nCopenhagen, they put us into showers, washed us and then they gave me the kerchief.\nAnd then they gave me -- the kerchief I don\u2019t have -- they gave me a blanket. And that\nwas my first piece of possession I had. And I wore that blanket all over, I wrapped myself\naround. And they gave me a dress and it was much too -- my stomach was big and I\nbegan to develop after awhile, so -- but everything else was just hanging, like flesh, you\nknow, just skin. And -- And so, the blanket I have. When all the years -- in fact, I asked\nmy sister, \u201cWhat do you -- what did you do with your blanket?\u201d She says, \u201cWell, when I\ngot -- could afford to buy a new one, I threw it out.\u201d I said, \u201cThat\u2019s the difference\nbetween you and me. I still have it and now the museum wants it.\u201d So, I still have that\nblanket and I'll probably give it to them, except that blanket -- every time my child was\nsick, I cuddled it. It was my security blanket.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. That was my special blanket.",

        "A: Well, I got to Denmark -- well, I was there from March of -- you know, before the war\nwas over -- from March of \u201c45 and I went for -- it was August of 1949, to Canada.",
        "A: Well, he -- he -- when h -- when he survived Dachau, he wanted -- first thing he was\ngoing to go, is to look for us, to Lithuania. But when he came to the border, they told\nthem that if he gets in, he won\u2019t be able to get out, it was the Russians. So, he went back\nand he went -- go to Palestine then, to -- to Israel. Well, there was the British blockade,\nhe couldn\u2019t. So -- and they were taking people to Cyprus. So he remained in Italy and a\nwoman -- it was very hard to get in the United States or Canada. There were quotas and\nso forth. So him and 22 others, a woman who literally mortgaged her house -- her name\nwas Mrs. Sadoff, and brought the 22 young guys to Toronto, to Canada.",
        "A: No, no, she was Jewish and she -- a lot of people did --",

She\npassed away since then. And he came on a quota to Toronto. And as s-soon as he came,\nhe -- well, we were corresponding constantly and -- and that -- he -- I wanted to go to\nhim. I wanted to leave Europe. By then my sister was married and had already a child,\nand --",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: Me, I had -- I was living by myself. I was live -- first we lived with a family, with the\nFrankel family and then, after my sister got married, I got a little -- tiny little hole in the\nground, just for myself and I lived there and I -- I became a nanny and [indecipherable].\nAnd my school was so disrupted that I began to -- I used to take courses and I spoke\nDanish fluently. People couldn\u2019t understand -- I learned it so good because I wanted to\ncommunicate with the people. I just loved them, they -- to me, the Danish people are a\nholy people. They are so incredible. I\u2019m -- they\u2019re so incredible what they did, I mean, it\njust -- it\u2019s as like -- it\u2019s just unbelievable, like Paula Yensen, and this is -- this was\nhappening all over Denmark, that when the Jews were taken over to Sweden, they have --\ntheir friends had a factory and her husbands was taking care of the factory. When they\ncame back, all the money that was made over the -- the two and a half years that they\nwere in Sweden, were given to them. I mean, homes were painted -- their homes were\npainting -- flowers in their homes, everything -- I mean, it\u2019s just -- and the fact that they\nrisked their lives, you know, it\u2019s --",
        "A: Yeah, I have a postcard he sent. He sent a high holiday postcard, I'll never forget, with\na picture. They used to do the -- the picture would come in, you know, like heart and\ninside put a picture, that was the mode. And my -- my brother -- we could not -- I mean,\nwe could not believe. We were horrified of telling h-him what happened to my mother.\nWe just kept saying -- and we couldn\u2019t just get the words to say that was taken in the gas\nchamber and I saw it. Many things -- my brother and my sister don\u2019t want to talk about\nanything that happened. They can\u2019t understand that I can go around speaking about it. I\nmean, they are proud of me that I am doing it, but they can\u2019t. It was more things of how\nwe can get together and -- and -- and be together. My sister already by then was anchored\ndown in Denmark, so I left for Canada.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t until not too long ago. When they did --",
        "A: Yes. Not how. Not how.",
        "A: We were writing mostly is not what -- what happened and the horror and so forth. We\nwere more really writing of how we can be together and start as a family, be\n[indecipherable] him and me and my sister, whether -- wherever it would be that we\nwould be together. And if he had gotten to Palestine, I would have been in -- in Israel\ntoday. In fact, 1t was very interesting, when I first met Martin Luther King, one evening\nat dinner and he asked me, \u201cWhy did you come to the United States?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell,\nI didn\u2019t, I came to Canada and I came because of my brother.\u201d If my brother was able to\nhave come -- Canada was the furthest from him to come. The first one was to got to -- to\nIsrael, to Palestine, but he couldn\u2019t. It was the British blockade. I probably would have\nbeen in Israel today, cause I came just to be with him.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no. I had to do everything myself. I had to -- one of the things that I had to do 1s I\nhad to pay for the -- and I didn\u2019t have money. So I had -- a gi -- friend helped me with\nsome money -- Jewish friend. Paula was very upset, because sh -- that I told her I was\nleaving, she couldn\u2019t understand. She -- Paula Yensen, because they wanted really -- their\ndream was to adopt both of us, they had no children. They were Lutheran family, they\nwere wonderful. And -- And so they -- oh, so hard to think no [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm. Mm-hm. Well, as soon as my -- I -- as soon as I found out my\nbrother came to Toronto, to Canada, he had no money to help me to come. The -- There\nwas no place that I could go. There was really, in Denmark, not even a HIAS that could\nhelp me. You know, HIAS was who -- was an organization that helped refugees, you\nknow, go places. And there was the visa, how do you -- you get? Before that, you have to\ngo to a doctor and thank God that in Denmark is socialized medicine so you have to see\nthat you don\u2019t have syphilis and th-that. And me having had TB was -- became a\nproblem, but I was already clear out of that and they gave me a clear bill of health to\ncome into this country. And so, I worked. The people who I took care of, the kids I\nbabysat, I did all kinds of things in Denmark to earn some money to come. And one\nsummer, I pick strawberries. That\u2019s why when I go by now and I go on the way to San\nFrancisco, I go on Salenas and so on, I see them picking that and I said, \u201cOh boy.\u201d No\nmatter how expensive we pay for strawberries, we get it so cheap, because it\u2019s very hard\nwork. You know, you empathize with what we get so cheap, the vegetables and how little\nthey get paid, the migrant workers. Really, I always bring these things back, constantly to\nme. And so, when I finally had enough money, then there were everybody saying\ngoodbye and Paula and Swen Yensen, they were -- they were just horrified that I would\nleave them. They were -- I was their little pia, their little child. And -- And I sailed -- I\nwent through -- on train and I took and I was -- went to -- through -- going to\nBremerhaven, where I sailed from.",
        "A: With a visa. But I had to go through the -- the zone and I was taken, you know, here I\nam on the train and after all that, I\u2019m going to Germany. I remembered -- I\u2019ll never forget\nthat -- with the visa and then there is the eastern zone and the western zone and you get\non and you have to constantly show your visa [indecipherable]. And lo and behold, as\nI\u2019m doing that, for some reason, they take me off the -- the train. And I was going\nthrough Paris first, because a woman by the name Mrs. Wagner, Madame Wagner, she\nwas -- She knew me from Denmark and she was going to pick me up in France. And here,\nI can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m taken over in Bremerhaven, and -- because it was stamped\nfor there, but I was supposed to leave from LeHavre -- from France, going to Quebec.\nAnd for some reason -- I mean, I didn\u2019t -- you know, it was stamped and they were --\nthey were not, but I gave them such a hard time. I was crying and I was like this. I mean,\nit was just so upsetting and I couldn\u2019t talk to them and I didn\u2019t want to talk German and\nbeing in Germany, I just hated, you know, the fact, you know, that I have to\n[indecipherable] what is happening, that kind. And so finally they stamped it and the next\nday they put me on the train and she picked me up and I was a wreck. I get on the train --\nI get on the boat, and --",
        "A: At LeHavre and I\u2019m sailing for Quebec. And the whole boat -- it was called the\nScertia, was owned by Conrad Whitestar or something -- and the whole boat, there are\nGerman uniforms and -- I mean, I\u2019m not going up where the -- all the regular passenger\nare, this was steerage, you know. And all of a sudden, I hear there are about -- they\u2019re all\nguys and they\u2019re speaking Danish. And I went over to them, and I said \u201cAdudansk,\u201d I\nmean, I started talking to them Danish, and I became -- they -- they protected me. All the\ntrip, they were taking care of me. They were just incredible. They were so wonderful to\nme. They were going on a special thing in -- up in Canada somewhere, doing agricultural\n-- you know, Denmark\u2019s very a-agricultural. They had some kind of a thing going there,\nyeah.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: So anyway, so then we finally -- when we arrived at Quebec, I was -- and then wa --\noh, so when -- part of that I -- si -- they told me they -- they were not in steerage, they\nwere, you know, in the regular passengers. And they got me up and they said, \u201cOh, if\nyou\u2019re Jewish, there\u2019s a whole group, there\u2019s about three guys who are Jewish and they\nare on the boat.\u201d So, that was even better for me, you know, and I started talking. That\u2019s\nhow I met my ex-husband, aboard ship.",
        "A: The -- I was speaking to them, I was speaking Danish and to the three guys, a little bit\nof Yiddish they knew, very little Yiddish, but we communicated. The Danes spoked\nEnglish, so they could translate. They were my translators. And I met my ex and I came\nto Canada, and --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, well --",
        "A: The boat -- The boat was almost -- over 10 days, I think was, you know, not that fast\nthose years, the boats going. But they --",
        "A: Gabe Cohen. And yeah -- and he said, he -- he almost pr -- he proposed almost right\nthere and then to me. He was coming back. He was -- during the war, went to Israel to\nfight -- really illegally to go to fight.",
        "A: No, he was Canadian. And he could not get -- but he\u2019s lived all his life in United\nStates, but he didn\u2019t know that his father was born in Ottawa. And his mother was born in\nNew York, but they lived in New York all this time, in Brooklyn. And he -- he could not\ncome back in it -- to United States directly, he had to come back through Canada. So, I --\nhe had family Montreal and he took me off the boat and we went to visit his family in\nMontreal. And my brother comes to pick me up and here I\u2019m gone with some guy that he\ndoesn\u2019t -- and he hadn\u2019t seen me, so it was -- it was kind of difficult and finally I came to\nToronto and I stayed in Toronto. We got married in Toronto.",

        "A: No, my brother -- yeah, my brother was waiting, but I didn\u2019t know, was\nmiscommunication. So anyways, we got -- and he went back to Toronto and then I came\nthere like two days later, to Toronto. And I remember going out on the -- on the -- putting\nme on, on the train and I had to go by train from Quebec to Toronto and I couldn\u2019t speak\nto anybody. I was completely -- until I finally fell in the arms of my brother, you know?\nAnd from there on -- we had tiny, little room, and --",
        "A: No, no, he couldn\u2019t, becau -- no, he tried to get back to United States, he had a hard\ntime, because he was -- he went illegally to fight during this -- the war of liberation and\nwith Israel, you know and so --",

        "A: Yeah, he went to United States.",
        "A: Well, for the first time, was really, you know, we -- we really rarely talked about what\nhappened to us. We just wanted to know what\u2019s going to happen, what\u2019s going to be our\nfuture, what are we going to do, how are we going to live. And -- And it took awhile til\nwe began. I mean, we didn\u2019t dwell on the horrible things that happened to us. It was more\nabout the now. What are we going to do now and so forth. Then, I got married and my\nbrother moved in with me and lived with me for awhile.",
        "A: In Canada. In Toronto. And then, after we got married, it was very difficult to get me\nback into United States, because there was a McCowen Act Law. There was a\nimmigration that you had the quota for so many people they would let in. And I -- I\narrived and we got married in Janu -- Jan or Fe -- New Year\u2019s Day, we got married. And\nI arrived, I think to --",
        "A: 1950, and I arrived in nine -- let me see. I arrived in May of 1950, I arrived to New\nYork.",
        "A: Yeah. By train, cause plane were too expensive. Trains were cheaper then.",

And then, after he -- he\nwa -- he had one more year to finish college and after that, he -- he got an offer -- he is\nJewish educator -- he had an offer to come to Toronto to work for Talmuttor, which is a\nJewish day school, and we went back to Toronto and then my -- then my sister came to\nvisit.

        "A: In Toronto.",

        "A: Me and my husband?",
        "A: Oh yeah. I think there was a special thing that he knew, you know -- I had a lot of\nfears. P\u2019ll never forget our honeymoon, I locked myself in the bathroom and wouldn\u2019t\ncome out, cause I was so scared of every little thing. Every new thing was the -- just a\nscary thing for me. But the most important thing is that I had lots of fears. I always\nlooked for an exit and to this day I still do that, where all the exits are, when I go into a\nmovie or anything. And I -- I -- I still have the same fears. I could never put like -- my\nfield is early childhood education and I started two preschools. One here and one in\nPhiladelphia. And when you put the -- you don\u2019t -- they don\u2019t do it now as much, but we\nused to [indecipherable] put like a child\u2019s name and put it around the neck so if we\nshouldn\u2019t lose them. I could never do that, because that\u2019s when people went for the firing\nsquads. Things like that and a lot of nightmares and so forth.

I know one thing, that my parents -- in my parents home, we had very modest\nhome in a little town and I can remember that we used to have little bags of earth and -- it\nwas -- came from Palestine, came from Israel, from the Holy Land, so the f-for when a\nperson is buried, the first shovel of that you brang from the Holy Land to put in the grave\nand every year there would come around a emissary from -- from Israel -- from Palestine\nthen, and would sell this. And we would have that and ou -- oh, you know, so there was\nconnection with Israel, with -- with the state of Israel. We had the JNF box, the -- that --\nthat -- over there, there is a li -- where you give for tadocker, you put in money and it\ngoes for Israel, you know.

        "A: Oh, definitely. I feel, if there was a state of Israel, maybe this would not have\nhappened. I think that the fact is that Israel to me, is the most important thing. That it is\nthe protection for people and the in-gathering of the exiles that we were -- we had -- we --\nwe did not have a homeland. And I feel there was no one talking up for us. The rest of the\nworld really didn\u2019t care. They knew it was there, but they didn\u2019t do anything about it.",
        "A: Oh, I -- including the Jews in United States. I think that they were so 1-isolated and so\ninsulated and not only that, but there was fear here. The Jews had fear here, because there\nwas a Father Coglin who was on the radio constantly, telling [indecipherable] and was\nvery anti-Semitic in -- in the 30\u2019s and -- and in the 40\u2019s. There was a Nazi party and the\nfact that United States went into the war ver -- th -- I owe my life to them, that they\nliberated me, if 1t wouldn\u2019t be for United States, but at the same time, they went in so\nlate. And so, to me, Israel is s-s-stands there and -- and we must make Israel a strong\nnation. I don\u2019t like some of the politics what\u2019s going on in Israel today. That bothers me,\nbecause that\u2019s not the kind of state I would like to have.",
        "A: Well, it bothers me that the equality is not there, that the --",

And that the state -- the\nstate has to be separation of religion and th-the poli -- you know, I think the politics in\nitself. And I think that, to me, peace is a long way off there. I try to go there about every\ntwo years, lately, to live there for about a month or two months. Basically, the people\nwant peace on both sides. But on both sides, there are hatred. And the Arabs have such\nhatred for the Jews. I mean, there used to be before it was all about Israel, now they\u2019re\nsaying Jews, they\u2019re hating Jews. And -- And it\u2019s a very difficult thing when I -- I -- I\nhave examples where I went to visit a very dear friend who lives there. American family,\nwent there very early and they\u2019ve lived there for a long time. Their kids grew up with the\nchildren whe -- in that little town where the interfadder started. And when the interfadder\nstarted, stones started flying through their window. And this is the kind of thing. Now, do\nyou give up that peace and -- and let it happen to you, with -- stones kill. It\u2019s a very, very\ndifficult situation there, but nevertheless, I feel that, as a Jew, I\u2019m very proud of Israel,\nwhat they have done. And I hope that there will be peace in Jerusalem.

And finally, when she was born, Ill never forget when I went\nback -- Dr. Williamson, I went back to him and he said, \u201cWell.\u201d And I ask him, \u201cWhen\ncan I have another child?\u201d And he looked at me, he says, \u201c[indecipherable],\u201d he said,\n\u201cBoy, you women, you -- do you remember how difficult?\u201d But then I had -- I had a -- a\nmiscar -- I had a stillborn child after that. That was very difficult to take, because those\nyears, they couldn\u2019t do anything, said it has to take it\u2019s natural causes and I was sick. And\nthen after that, my son Michael arrived. And was not easy, but was fine. And then\nDebbie. And they were three years apart and I just wanted to have a family, I -- not a lot\nof children, but I wanted to have more and more and then the third, you know, it wasn\u2019t\nreally like we planned it. We didn\u2019t plan it, whatever happened. And --",

And\nthey said no, they don\u2019t want to name after anyone. Was very interesting, because my\nfather-in-law\u2019s name was Jacob and my mother-in-law\u2019s name was Jacob. See my -- her\nfather was named Jacob. And if the two are the same, they usually have -- the namesake\nis usually carried after, you know, from the person passes away, you give the namesake,\nbut you can\u2019t give the namesake if the father is the same name. So, they had a lot of\ndifficulty when she was getting married and she told me that. I never heard of it before,\nbut she was very adamant that I should name a name that I liked, that the child will like\nwhen he\u2019s -- you know, and will able to carry that name proudly. So that -- and when\nDeborah came along, was -- I had a sister-in-law who was shot down. Their plane was\nshot down over Bulgaria. She was going to -- back to Israel, she was from Israel and her\nname was Debore-ore and so I named Debbie after that.",

And we completely -- did a complete walk through of wherever I\nwas and the film played here, a -- or -- 1t opened up for -- in \u201898, of September, oh, Labor\nDay weekend. And within a week, it was sold out, 686 seats were completely sold out\nand they had a fundraiser for Beyond Tolerance Center. It\u2019s been my dream to start a\nBeyond Tolerance. We were going to call it Tolerance Center, but tolerance, it means so\nmuch, it\u2019s just an ambiguous, you know, thing. So we calling it Beyond Tolerance. And,\nbecause I\u2019ve always felt -- because I go out and speak into schools all the time and\nwherever I go, that children need to be taught tolerance, from the very young age,\nespecially in the schools. And the schools don\u2019t have the money, so we got a whole group\nof people together here and who are funding it and it\u2019s part of the county school system.\nSo we have a one -- one is diversity, which 1s -- Scorbell Museum has a very good thing,\nit\u2019s called a diversity -- teaching for younger children.

And it was here for a month and a\nhalf and I want to tell you, was the best thing Santa Barbara ever had. And we brought\n10,000 students. I worked a year and a half on it, really got to know the school system\nand we brought that to Santa Barbara. We brought 36 th-thousand students downtown in\n-- where the exhibit were. We had a whole month of all kinds of things going in -- of\nteaching what racism and bigotry does. We had an incredible, credible program.",
        "A: It\u2019s -- no, it was a tea -- well, it was -- it went with the Anne Frank in the World\nexhibit. We included all faith communities. We included the Chumus Indian, which we\nhave a popul -- a sizable population. We found out that when we did that, that there were\ntwo Chumus Indians and they didn\u2019t talk to each other. Doing this, they began to talk to\neach other. So we did that. And we -- the African American community had their own\nprograms. We had programs -- completely diverse programs, but all teaching to\ntolerance. How to do away with hatred and bigotry.

So, I didn\u2019t\nworked. When we moved to Wilmington, Delaware, I was very involved in the\ncommunity. I was always involved in the community, always.

        "A: A synagogue and a school, wherever I could. And wherever I could make myself\nunderstand, because my -- my English was still not the greatest. But when I -- in -- in\nPhiladelphia, I got really involved in the Civil Rights movement in Philadelphia. And --",
        "A: Well, what happened was I was asked by a woman if -- who organizes, called the\npanel of American women. It was a group of women, and we went -- who went out to\nspeak and they spoke mostly how it was -- this was in the early 60\u2019s, like \u201861, how it is to\nlive in United States, as a Protestant, a Catholic and a Jewish person and a Native\nAmerican. And th-they asked me to be the Jewish person, and I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m very busy,\nI have\u201d -- I was busy in my synagogue, I was busy with Haddassah, which is woman\u2019s\ngroup, a Zionist organization, who take care of the hospitals in Israel. And I felt I really\ndid not have time, with three children and I was busy enough. I just didn\u2019t do anything.\nThen, I\u2019m sitting and watching the news and it was David Brinkley and John Chancellor,\ntalking about a group -- I mean, I love news -- about a group of people that congregated\nthemselves in front of a home that an African American family had moved into that\nhome. And it was called -- I don\u2019t even want to repeat it, of course. And taunting them,\nand it looked like 500 people. And the police standing, they aren\u2019t doing nothing. And\nfor me, it was like Kristallnacht, when people saw what was happening in Nazi Germany\nand nobody did anything. Everybody was just, you know, looking and doing nothing.\nWell, I wasn\u2019t going to do that. I felt that if that family -- the name of the people were\nBaker, if the Baker\u2019s weren\u2019t -- in Folcoff, Pennsylvania, which 1s near the airport -- if\ntheir home is not safe, my home is not safe. So I -- I got dressed and I -- I was --\nremember -- I was -- was sitting and took some cookies I had baked and I called a friend\nwho was involved with that panel, if she would come and go with me to the Bakers. They\nwere still trying to get me on that panel and those people were all I met through the\npublic school, through Henry School in Philadelphia. And I said, \u201cYes, I want to go.\u201d\nAnd we went. And I -- for the first time in the United States, I was in Philadelphia, in the\ncity of brotherly love, feeling this thing of hatred, when I was called white trash and\nthrowing things at me when we walked by. We parked the car at a distance. And I went\nto Sarah and Horace Baker, I -- I have lost contact since, with them. In fact, they are\ngoing to try to have a reunion with all of us when I\u2019m there, in Philadelphia. And from\nthen on, I called up the lady who was doing the panel was Lois Stalvy, and I said to her,\n\u201cLois, I want to be on the panel.\u201d And I started speaking out what was happening to me,\nthat ultimately this was going to be the result. And we spoke all over, all over. I\u2019ll never\nforget when I went to Columbia, Maryland, which was a brand new town that was just\nbuilt. And we were refused -- I was there with two African American women -- was\nrefused to be served, the guy would not serve us. And I walked up to him in my broken\nEnglish and -- I mean, my English, I told him, you know, \u201cWe\u2019re waiting long, where is\nthe food?\u201d And he said, \u201cI don\u2019t have tea, coffee, or anything for the likes like you.\u201d And\nI walked up and I remember having the water -- glasses of water, spilled out the water\nand I just -- and walked out. I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. We don\u2019t need this white trash.\u201d And I --\nyou know, and I walked out. Said it loud enough that everybody turned around. Then I\nmade a statement. And I went on and I felt that the Civil Rights movement was a si -- a\ntime in my life that I felt -- this was before even Martin Luther King, that it was a very,\nvery scary, that this is going to happen all over again. There were riots. There were all\nkinds of things that this is happening in the United States. I knew very little about the\nUnited States, even though I\u2019ve lived here already a few years. I -- I had just become a\ncitizen -- I had just become a citizen. It was -- Nixon was running for office. I was -- and\nhe lost, the first time he [indecipherable].",

You know, they ask you who -- who would become\npresident and -- oh, no, he was -- he -- Nix-Nixon, oh, I\u2019m sorry. When I came here,\nTruman was the -- but Nixon was the vice-president, so he was with who? With\nEisenhower.",
        "A: Eisenhower. Now Eisenhower, for me, was my idol, because he was my liberator. And\nwhen I heard his name -- to this day, when I see the American flag, I cry. I get tears in my\neyes. The -- The Star Spangled Banner is just the -- the greatest thing that -- greatest\npiece of music to my life. I mean that -- here they were. There is no country in the world\nlike United States. But I remember distinctly when the judge asked me, \u201cIf the president\ndies, who becomes the president?\u201d And I say, \u201cGod forbid, Nixon.\u201d And the judge said --\nPll never forget, the judge said, \u201cYou don\u2019t like Mr. Nixon?\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, I want Mr.\nEisenhower to live.\u201d He said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m a democrat.\u201d Ill never forget that, that was\nin Wilmington, Delaware.",

And I\ndon\u2019t think many people exercise that right. And that\u2019s why, it became, during Civil\nRights movement, so important for me -- every African American, every black person I\nmet, I\u2019d say, \u201cDid you vote? Are you registered to vote? If not, let\u2019s -- I\u2019m going to help\nyou.\u201d And I had a hard time doing it, because I was not -- you know, and\n[indecipherable] I was not even an -- a citizen myself, I couldn\u2019t -- I did -- started doing\nthat. And I just -- I just felt I had an incredible kinship with the Black person, because,\nyou see, the Black person never hurt me. I was never hurt by a Black person. I was hurt\nby a White Christian person. So they were a different people and why would they,\nbecause of -- because they were -- looked different than me, I couldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t\nunderstand that. And people would say to me, \u201cWell, you have to live here to -- to\nunderstand.\u201d So I guess -- but I couldn\u2019t believe that United States would be that racist.\nAnd so I began to speak out quite a bit on that. And I took on -- there were a lot of, you\nknow, the deniers and that, and -- and was hissed on and -- you know, and all the -- the --\nthe things during that time.

The most difficult\npart was my son didn\u2019t have a high number and I was worried -- terribly worried about --\nof him being drafted. E -- E -- I had sleepless nights about it. My brother and my sister\nlive in Canada and you know there were a lot of people who went to Canada. And I was\nliterally, if it didn\u2019t stopped, I was thinking of moving back to Canada, cause I just could\nnot deal with that. And the scary part of the -- became even worse is when the Kent State\n-- [remember when the Kent State, with the shootings at Kent State, it was devastated. It\nwas very scary time. The new left movement, I didn\u2019t have that much of -- didn\u2019t -- busy.\nThe sexual revolution is -- the drugs and so forth. I think it was scary for me, the drug\nsituation, because here I was with two teenagers and I remember the kids used to love to\ncome to my house, his friends. And my son is -- played basketball and he was on the\nvarsity team, so all the kids would come. And rather than him going down to north\nPhiladelphia in a very not good neighborhood, we had a basketball court put in and he\nwould play at home. And I remember baking pies so they would all come in. And [Il\nnever forget this instance. I was running for my second job, teaching at congregation\nB\u2019nai Brith. [indecipherable] congregation B\u2019nai Brith, [indecipherable] on congregation\nin Philadelphia. And my daughter and my son, they were home and then there were like\nfour of Black kids who were playing basketball with him, who were on -- from Central\nHigh School. And I remember this friend of mine happened to come and drop off her\ndaughter. And she said, \u201cAre you kidding, you\u2019re going out and you\u2019re leaving four\nBlack kids with Michael and Debbie?\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy not?\u201d She would not leave her\ndaughter and that\u2019s why I remember I was devastated. Here is -- I trust my kids, in my\nown home. They were -- they are all the time in my house, I trusted them and here is --\nshe\u2019s trying to tell me that I\u2019m doing something wrong. And nothing happened. My kids\ngrew up in a very well integrated neighborhood of west Mount Airy. And I think they are\nbetter off, because they are better human beings today. They are very involved in their\nown communities, wherever they live and I\u2019m grateful that I gave them that kind of home\nto live in. So, the drug scene was very scared for me and I would say to them, \u201cIf you are\ncaught and smoking marijuana,\u201d -- which was that time, marijuana, \u201cand you\u2019re arrested,\nthere\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to bail you out. I work hard enough just to make you regular,\ndecent human beings and if it\u2019s against the law, then you shouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d I knew nothing\nabout it and so forth. And so that\u2019s -- that was it, you know, but thank God, my kids, I\ndon\u2019t know if they ever smoked marijuana or not, but I -- they\u2019ve never been in trouble\nwith the law, thank God. The feminist movement I had a hard time understanding. I\ncouldn\u2019t deal with, but I felt that because I was a single mother, I felt I should get equal\npay for what I did, for that I worked hard for it. I remember the assassination of Medgar\nEvers and I was devastated. How it could happen them, because he was by then, a real\nname in every community. And John F. Kennedy, I -- I felt that we will never know what\nhe -- kind of president he would have been, died too young and too violent. And Martin\nLuther King, he was -- he became my children\u2019s hero.",
        "A: Somebody to look for -- I remember Robert Kennedy when he was shot. The fact that\nyou could see that on television, it was just incredible.",
        "A: I remember it was on a Saturday when his funeral -- when ro -- when John Kennedy\u2019s\nfuneral and it was a big blizzard and we were all in watching the funeral, I can so vividly\nremember. And I remember when Robert Kenne -- I mean, those are all memories that I\nhave, but Martin Luther King was somebody larger in life to me. Larger in life, that they\ncould take him and that he went to a place to get better pay for ga -- people who were\ntaking out garbage -- and that he was killed like that. I thought Truman -- I loved\nTruman. I liked Eisenhower.",
        "A: Well, Truman was the United States. When I came here, he was the figure. He was the\npresident in United States. I was lucky to be here. It was like we used to say in -- in\nYiddish, a golden immadina. Or, to accept the gold you didn\u2019t see, this means th-the --\nthe grounds are paved with gold. It wasn\u2019t, but it didn\u2019t mean that, 1t meaned that I was\nfree, there was freedom and -- and that he was a -- spoke to the common man. Reagan,\nwhen he went to visit the gravesites of the German soldiers in Bittburg, I was at the\npreschool and I got a call from Jerry Rankin, who was the editor of the Santa Barbara\nNews Press, if I could say something as a Holocaust survivor, if I would say to Reagan.\nAnd the caption was, \u201cWhat does --\u201d Reagan lived far away from here, but it still said,\n\u201cWhat does --\u201d\u2019 No, the caption was, \u201cWhat does Reagan\u2019s neighbor thinks of him going\nto Bittburg\u201d. And I had plenty to say, and to me, why visit the perpetrators who killed --\nthe killers -- and not visit American soldiers who were killed saving the people? I\ncouldn\u2019t understand him. It just beyond me. It was just way beyond me that he could do\nsuch a thing.",
        "A: No, no. But I -- I remember writing it to -- to him and to congressman and -- but I\nremember I was so hurt. I felt it a personal hurt that here is a president of the United\nStates, going to commemoration and going to Bittburg to honor the -- the soldiers -- to\nlay a wreath on the soldiers, well in the Americans he didn\u2019t. And that was just too -- too\ndifficult for me. I thought when the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum was\nestablished, I thought that was the greatest thing that happened. I thought, that has\nnothing to do because Jewish. That here is a museum, a federal museum that speaks to\nthe world what racism and bigotry does when it\u2019s allowed to flourish, and man\u2019s\ninhumanity to man. And it\u2019s still happening and I hope as many -- my -- what\u2019d I say --\nmy wish one day, is that it take all the leaders of the world -- all the leaders of the world\nand bring them in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and just show them\nand talk to them what happened and what\u2019s still happening in their countries. It is still\nhappening, except it 1s far away. And, I was very proud this year of my -- my youngest\ndaughter, when the Honduras flood, she called the Honduran embassy and she wanted to\nknow what can she do. I always used to tell my children, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what can I do,\nI\u2019m only one person.\u201d One person can do a lot. So she said, \u201cOh, you\u2019ll be proud of me.\u201d\nSo I said, \u201cWell, what\u2019d you do?\u201d She says, \u201cI called up the Honduras library, and I --\nembassy, and I said, Well, how -- what can I do to help?\u201d And they said, \u201cWell, we need\ndiapers, we need aspirin and formula.\u201d And she says, \u201cOh, I can do that, how do I ship\nit?\u201d They said, \u201cWell, if you have it in three days, we\u2019ll ship it for you.\u201d She said, in no\ntime at all, she had an auditorium full of things. What she did is she Xeroxed -- put a note\nout in all the schools to bring. People really want to help. They don\u2019t know how to do it,\nwe have to empower them to help. Because I think, basically, like Anne Frank said,\nbasically people are good at heart. They are. It just -- we have to just get out the goodness\nin them.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, she is my youngest.",
        "A: Well, ma --",
        "A: Yeah. My daughter started doing --",
        "A: In Mendocino, Mina. She\u2019s the oldest and she\u2019s an artist and we always knew she was\ngoing to be an artist from the time she was a -- she was a toddler. She always liked to\ndraw and do things and put things together, collages and all kinds. She is -- does a\nmultimedia. She started saying stories that my mother told me and -- I'll have to show\nyou, and stories that my mother told me about. And she writes it about each painting that\nshe did, or each collage. Like sh -- about Hava. She tells the story about Hava and she has\na little shoe in the hand. She has one painting with shoes. She -- with real shoes. She\nalways used to collect shoes, I said, \u201cWhat do you need the shoes?\u201d She said, \u201cYou'll\nsee.\u201d And it\u2019s been going around to various schools all over the country, as long as they\npay for the shipping and so forth and she does a wonderful -- she -- she does the\nnarration, she has a -- what do you call it? She narrates -- you know, she does the talk\nabout what she does with the exhibit is, she\u2019s compared my mother to me and then from\nme to her and from her to her two daughters. And it\u2019s a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful\nexhibit. It\u2019s really -- it -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t been -- wherever it\u2019s been, it\u2019s been very well\nreceived. It\u2019s been twice already to Santa Barbara. And -- So it\u2019s opening up on February\nseventh, in -- with a reception and her being there, at Abington Friends, in Philadelphia.",
        "A: School. It\u2019s a Quaker school. And then it\u2019s going to another Quaker school, at the\nSidwell school or Sidewell. I don\u2019t know, Sidwell, in Washington, DC. And that\u2019s\nopening up, I think, for April fifth. So, I\u2019m very, very proud of my kids, of all my kids.\nAnd the film 1s -- is incredible what they did with the film. They got the si -- not only\nthat, we have Congressman Copps, who lived here. I used to come to speak to his classes\nat UCSB before he became a congressman. You may have heard about him. Most\nincredible man and he had the largest class, the largest auditorium on the university, 875\nstudents. And I would come twice to speak. And he was so wonderful to me, he -- I had -\n- came down with breast cancer and the day after I was operated, he called me and he\ngave me the schedule when I\u2019m going to be doing it. I said, \u201cOh, Dr. Copps,\u201d I says, \u201cI\ncan\u2019t even walk across the --\u201d \u201cYoull be here,\u201d and sure enough. So unfortunately, he\nbecame [indecipherable] he -- one -- first one time and he lost, the second time he won.\nTwo years into his term, at Dallas Airport, he had a heart attack and he died. So his wife\nrunned for his ticket and she got in and this, now -- she got in on her own, Lois Copps.\nAnd he speaks about me in the film. So they -- they filmed him like a couple of weeks\nbefore he died, the filmmakers. It\u2019s just a -- so she wants this film. This is her wish, to\nshow it at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and invite the congress to see\nit, because he was really loved. He was an incredible man.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Laura Bialis, Sara Levy and Broderick Fox. But Laura Bialis is really -- she raised the\nmoney, she did everything. And now she\u2019s entering it into film festivals and it -- there is\ngoing to be an opening, I think, in LA, I don\u2019t know, in February, Stamford alumnis are\ngoing to have it. But, it\u2019s entered now into various film festivals and because it\u2019s entered\nin film festivals, you can\u2019t give it out too much, because there\u2019s a film festival here and\nthey are not sure they are going to take it, because it\u2019s already played. It\u2019s just -- so, for\nher, she\u2019s -- she\u2019s holding onto it for dear life and every day we get calls, please can we\nsee it. Because people couldn\u2019t get tickets. It was sold out in one week.",
        "A: Makes me feel -- I don\u2019t want to say it makes me feel good, it makes me help to fulfill\nmy mission of tell the story, that I promised. We all -- especially the last two weeks. We\npromised each other that if we survived, we wouldn\u2019t forget each other, that we will\nremember each other. That we will tell the world what happened. To see that this doesn\u2019t\nhappen again. And it\u2019s still happening and it -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s very -- I\u2019m very devastated\nwhen I read what\u2019s happening in Algeria, how many people daily get slaughtered. And\nit\u2019s -- a lot of it has to do with just religious hatred now.",
        "A: That -- That -- When we -- that -- the people used to say that we have to tell --\nwhoever survives has to tell the world what happened.",
        "A: And because they are not here, I have -- I feel my mission is -- and I\u2019m -- I\u2019m going to\nbe 70 when the paintings open -- it\u2019s so happen it\u2019s opening up -- 1s -- how long do I have",
        "A: That\u2019s when the fil -- the paintings are opening, Mina\u2019s art painting.",
        "A: Philadelphia.",
        "A: On February seventh.",
        "A: So you know, it\u2019s all -- to me, I want -- before I go out of this world, I want to leave\nthis world a better world. I can\u2019t say about the world, but my community and where I\nlive. And it\u2019s -- and through my children, and hopefully my grandchildren, that this\ndoesn\u2019t happen, doesn\u2019t occur. That we can live side by side and respect the differences\nand because we\u2019re all made in the same image of God.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: It\u2019s all over.",
        "A: It -- It really 1s, and it scares me. The fundamentalist groups are scaring me.",
        "A: Because their tunnel vision, they can only see thems -- what they are -- is -- they don\u2019t\ncare about anybody el -- and what is happening with the abortionist group -- with the\nanti-abortionists, is -- is the right to life or is -- they only see from conception to birth.\nAfterwards, they don\u2019t care what happens to them. They don\u2019t. I mean, there\u2019s so many --\nso much suffering and hunger and -- and squalor people leave.",
        "A: Well, I -- yeah, in that sense, I am. I\u2019m not the one if I -- to, you know, to have -- to\nbe -- in the beginning -- I think the -- the Feminist movement got such a bum rap is that\nthey didn\u2019t want men to open up doors, you know, and this kind nitty gritty. I -- I don\u2019t\nmind if man opens up the doors or, you know, or -- or picks -- or takes my bundle and --\nwh -- I don\u2019t need it. To me, the most important thing is that we get equal pay and that\nwe have a right to our own body. It\u2019s very important. And I think that the biggest difficult\nbecause of that is that there are not -- because I am breast cancer and thank God I\u2019m in\nremission is that there is so little studies done about women, there are more about men,\nbecause it\u2019s a man\u2019s world. And I think we\u2019re now realizing it, how little it\u2019s been studied\nabout women illnesses. It\u2019s been more about men. And that -- for that I -- I am, if -- if\nyou call it Feminist, I don\u2019t know, I think it\u2019s just the di-direction I want to go, this\ncountry to equality.",
        "A: Equal rights under the law and -- and -- okay. Oh, 48, that was -- I can tell you, I\nwasn\u2019t in Denmark. I\u2019ll never forget when the state of Israel was created. It was just\nincredible that we had a state. In 1947, Israel was partitioned by the UN, to live side by\nside, that\u2019s what right now is going on, but they want to live side by side. 21 nations,\nsurrounding Arab nation declared war on Israel and Israel was isolated and fought that\nwar and it so ironically, now we are -- right now, we are fighting -- they want the same\nthing what happened. But look what happened. The Arab nation -- the League of Arab\nNations, said to all the Arabs, \u201cFlee. Leave Israel and go fight against Israel.\u201d And Israel\nsaid, Ben-Gurion said, \u201cStay, you will live side by side with us.\u201d But they didn\u2019t. So now,\nit\u2019s happening, the Intifada -- I spoke to -- when I was in Israel, to a couple of young\npeople, soldiers. The worst part is to be sent into the area, to the occupied area, because\nchildren, they are fighting and children throw stones and stones kill. So it\u2019s not a real\nwar, but it\u2019s there and I think that the only way that it\u2019s going to be -- peace will come, 1s\nif Yasser Arafat outlaws Hamas and all the rhetoric of hatred and then Israel does the\nsame thing of hatred against, but -- but Israel don\u2019t go and blow buses up with children.\nThey may use harsh words, but they don\u2019t blow up buses with children -- with innocent\nchildren. Hamas and the Palestinians have -- I don\u2019t [indecipherable] say the Palestinians,\nthey\u2019ve been blowing up -- how do you negotiate peace with a suicide bomber? You\ncan\u2019t. You can -- you can do it with a leader, but a suicide bomber only knows one thing.\nHe\u2019s going to kill themselves, because he\u2019s going to go to heaven and blows up, yeah.\nIt\u2019s wrong for Israel to blow up houses, too, if they find that they have been members of\nHamas or something. It\u2019s wrong in both side. But still, I think that the most difficult thing\nthat I think 1s happening is, that if -- that nothing is going to happen until this hatred --\nyou don\u2019t have to love each other, but you have to be able to tolerate each other, to live\nside by side. But if you\u2019re going to have nothing but hatred, it\u2019s not going to happen. I\ndon\u2019t know, what do you think?",
        "A: Yeah, there is an international children -- child survivor\u2019s group. For years, I -- when I\nwould say to my sister, you know, this and this, she says, \u201cNo, it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d I said,\n\u201cWhat do you mean it didn\u2019t happen?\u201d Then she would say, \u201cHow do you remember, you\nwere only a child.\u201d And it used to bother me all the time, she would come out with that.\nAnd, so when I heard that there was a child survivor\u2019s group, the one -- and it -- from all\nthe places, 1t was one near here, in Oxnard, we went and the energy of those people was\nincredible. Is somebody here? Fred?",
        "A: Oh. It was incredible. Most of them, physicians, attorneys, you know, higher\neducation. The most wonderful group of people. So I\u2019ve been going this wee -- past --\nand this -- in September I went to Washington, they had a conference. The next one 1s in\nPrague. Oh, I would -- never been to -- I\u2019ve always want to go to Prague. So, they have a\nregion -- Hm?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s very interesting, they just broke off in two groups, so the -- the santa -- the --\nthere\u2019s none in Santa Barbara, there\u2019s one in LA and I don\u2019t really go there. I tell you, to\ngo into LA with the traffic, I hate that traffic.",
        "A: It\u2019s Child Survivors inter -- Fred?\nA2: Yeah?",
        "A: The -- The child survivor\u2019s group, what is it called, the real name? What\u2019s the -- I me -",
        "A: I didn\u2019t talk to -- tell you, I went back in \u201893 with a group called the s -- the Crusaders.\nThey\u2019re owned by Buena Vista Film, which is owned by DisneyWorld. They took me\nback to Stutthof concentration camp for the first time. They want it to come out when\nSchindler\u2019s List was showing. They wanted to show that they were at the concentration\ncamps and by a fluke -- how -- it\u2019s a long story how they got to me, and they took me and\nmy grandson and my son back. And they made three 10 minute tape. They took 18 two\nhour tapes and they only edited out three. And the rest of it they shelved, I never got it.\nBut this -- the documentary that I talk about, that was done. That\u2019s a whole documentary.\nSo I have the 10 minutes, if you want. But this is what I got from the B\u2019nai Brith -- from\nthe Anti-Defamation League. You know anything about the Anti-Defamation League?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, the anti --",
        "A: The award is for -- they gave me as the Outstanding Woman of the Year,\nDistinguished Community Service award.",
        "A: It all went with it and then they made me a local hero in \u201895, but I\u2019m always doing\nsomething.",
        "A: This 1s the -- that whole weekend, when they honored me for that, the county, I got --\noh, this I got an honor for the county for what I do for the county and -- and different\nthings.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I keep getting every once in awhile. But my grandchildren I should have\nmentioned, yeah. I have six wonderful grandchildren. The seventh is my husband\u2019s\ngranddaughter. And I have, it\u2019s Aaron and Benjamin and Ilana and Yaelle and Seth and\nJennifer. And I wish they were -- lived here. I don\u2019t get to see them that often, but they\nare all wonderful. And they know my story.",
        "A: Oh, do they know my story. Because I speak to their schools when I go there and\nyeah, they know.",
        "A: Oh yeah --",
        "A: -- oh yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It\u2019s different with grandchildren and that. They are like your bank account, you know,\nyour dividends, you know. They say the reason grandchildren and grandparent get along\nso beautiful is because they have one -- a common enemy, the parent.",
        "A: But we\u2019re very close, they\u2019re wonderful. And I going to go and get to see them on my\nbirthday, they\u2019re all coming in.",
        "A: I hope the weather [indecipherable] does something nice and just --",
        "A: Well, I keep a kosher home. I\u2019ve always kept a kosher home. I eat out only fish when\nI go out. I -- But my house is strictly kosher. I live -- unfortunately in Santa Barbara\nwhere I live, 1t does not have any kosher butcher. I have to go to Los Angeles to get my --\nmy chicken and we don\u2019t eat meat much, but my chicken and whatever kosher things I\nhave. When I first came here to Santa Barbara they had absolutely nothing and I went to\nVons, who is our supermarket and this and I started getting in -- they started getting in\nsome frozen chickens and some other products and now they have quite a bit. Also\nbagels. There were only one bagel place, it was horrible bagel. Now, we have so many\nbagel places. But we -- Iam so lucky that I live here in Santa Barbara, it\u2019s paradise, it\u2019s\nwonderful. And I am -- I am on eight boards. I am on the hello board. I am -- was asked\nto be trustee on the most wonderful, wonderful things -- Santa Barbara Jewish\nCommunity Foundation, where we help people -- Jews. And we help people, we send\nkids to camps, various camps of their choice. And I\u2019m sort of their idea person, but\n[indecipherable] to. And I\u2019m program chairman for Haddassah and let me see, what else?\nOh, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just in -- in the community, I\u2019m very involved and my big things is\nthat I do go out and speak a lot and it takes a lot out of me. And I\u2019m -- built the preschool\nhere with -- started with six children. When I left and retired, there were 60 children on\nthe waiting list. So, they -- hopefully they\u2019re going to build and add a bigger place so\nthey have more room. And I\u2019m very, very involved.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: After you leave I\u2019Il remember I didn\u2019t say that.",
        "A: I think the story is -- helps me in a sense that I can get the message out and that I feel\nthat maybe there will be somebody listening. The biggest thing I had last year, was I\nspoke at a large Catholic high school, in one of the largest here, real, real big one. And it\nwas 11th graders. And I was going out to my car in the parking lot and this young man,\nhe looked like a man, you know, the 11th grade, tall guy. He said, \u201cMrs. Meisel, I want\nreally to thank you for coming to my school. I was going to join a group -- I don\u2019t know,\nthey hate Latinos, they hate Jews, they hate Blacks and they call themselves skinheads, I\ndon\u2019t know if they are skinheads, but after I heard you today, I\u2019m not going to join.\u201d And\nif I saved one life, I\u2019ve saved the world. And that\u2019s -- to me, 1s very important. So those\nare the treasures that I treasure when I go out. Be-Believe me, it\u2019s not easy. So -- and the\ndeniers are out there, saying that this never happened and you can\u2019t debate them, cause\nit\u2019s not debatable. It\u2019s the same people who would say that there was never slavery here\nin this country and it\u2019s the same people who hate everyone, it\u2019s just full of hatred.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nConclusion of Interview\n"
