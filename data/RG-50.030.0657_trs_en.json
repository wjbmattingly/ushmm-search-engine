        "A: They exiled to Klaipeda.",
        "Q: And why is it a punishment? Why would it be a punishment?",
        "A: Because Klaipeda was little bit odd. Klaipeda was not Lithuania. Was more\nGerman. The culture, everything. Lutheran. All of Klaipeda was Lutheran. So\nthat\u2019s my \u2014 that\u2019s my \u2014 that I\u2014I didn\u2019t mean anything \u2014 that\u2019s my impression, and I\nthink I am right.

        "Q: And why wouldn\u2019t they?",
        "A: Lutheran.",
        "Q: I see. And is that why they were more pro-Nazi than Memellander?",
        "A: And then many, many \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 Klaipeda ci \u2014 Klaipeda citizens were sympathizing with Hitler. Hitler\npromised many, many things, and it was easy for him to take over the Klaipeda\n1939, what was March, or whatever.",
        "Q: Do you remember that time?",
        "A: Oh, I remember.",
        "Q: Where were you when it happened?",
        "A: I was in Lithuania, but I think I was in Klaipeda not lo \u2014 not long before that.\nKlaipeda was \u2014 because we had the relatives, we always associate, yeah.",
        "Q: So, you \u2014 do you remember the day when you heard Hitler took over? Not\nreally.",

        "Q: So you had this onslaught of people?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: And did they tell you about what was going on? Did they tell stories of what was\nhappening?",
        "A: We knew that. We knew that, we didn\u2019t like that.",
        "Q: What did you hear, what did you know? Because we don\u2019t know.",
        "A: So that Hitler took over Lithuania, part of Lithuania. That\u2019s like \u2014 like Polish\nand Vilnius, exactly the same. We in school \u2014 you know, in school in \u201937 - \u00b038, we\nwere already enlightened about the politics with Vilnius. Every morning in \u2014 in\ngrammar school, we stand up, we look at east, and we say [Speaks Lithuanian].\nWe will not be satisfied without Vilnius. So with Klaipeda, when Klaipeda was\ntaken over, Klaipeda is ours.",
        "Q: And yet it was taken over.",
        "A: It was taken over.",
        "Q: And what \u2014\nApril 30, 2012",
        "A: And my mother\u2019s brother stayed there. And then repat \u2014 repatriated when then\nwas exchange between Lithuanians who were German descent went to Germany,\nthere was th-the \u2014 the treaty between Soviet Union and Hitler \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, tell us a little bit about that.",
        "A: \u2014 where they exchanged.",
        "Q: Well see, I don\u2019t understand any of that. Please explain it all.",
        "A: Oh. It was 1940 - \u00b041.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Already Hitler took \u2014 no, 1940. 1940, when the first Soviet occupation.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: At one time, Germany agreed with Soviet Union, they will exchange.",
        "Q: Exchange what?",
        "A: The Lithuanians from Klaipeda or from Germany, who are Lithuanians\npatriots, want to come \u2014 [break] \u2014 Lithuania back, who stayed there. They didn\u2019t\nlike the Hitler regime, they wanted to come to \u2014 to Lithuania, and the Lithuanians,\nwhoever knew what the Soviet Union brought us, they claimed that they are\nLutherans, they are Germans, they claim that they have relatives someplace, and\nthey could prove to the Soviet government, they were let out. And that was the\nexchange, repatriation, what you call in Lithuania. And my mother\u2019s brother,\nApril 30, 2012\nTarmynas(ph), came from Klaipeda to Kretinga. And then he was \u2014 because then\nhe was trusted Soviet citizen, let\u2019s say, he was given a position in kedainai(ph) or\nsomeplace. And we say, why do you do that? He couldn\u2019t understand, he didn\u2019t\nwant to live under Hitler. But we knew already that.",
        "Q: So you \u2014",
        "A: There are two devils; one is brown, one is red. And to choose between two\ndevils, you rather would choose the brown. That time, really I\u2019m not lying, that time\nwas already evident that the Soviet Union was cruel. Because immediately, you\nremember, when they took the \u2014 immediately they de-deported so many people and\neverything, so that \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019ve gotten ahead of ourselves a little bit.",
        "A: Oh yeah, little bit, okay.",
        "Q: But \u2014 so the first time that I sense that their \u2014 that this world that you describe to\nme in Klaipeda has a huge change, is when Hitler takes over Memel and klai \u2014 the\nfirst time \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 yeah, that Kretinga, the world that you lived in gets changed, 1s when Hitler\ntakes over the port city of Memel and klai\u2014 Memel and German Klaipeda, and\nLithuanian \u2014\nApril 30, 2012",

        "Q: \u2014 and there\u2019s an exodus of Lithuanians coming to Kretinga.",
        "A: The first exodus \u2014",
        "Q: The first exodus.",
        "A: \u2014 before Hitler\u2019s army marched in, they knew that they will march in that and\nthat day, so that all the Lithuanians, where they could, they got everything \u2014 they\ncould take everything what they wanted, they went to Lithuanian side because they\nknew that after Hitler will take over, or that Germany will take over, that you have\nno choice then.",
        "Q: Okay, so here\u2019s another question, when those Lithuanians came, and I said, well\nwhat did they say, and you \u2014 you said, well, that Germany\u2019s taken over, I\u2019m going\nafter more of, let\u2019s say their experiences, their details, where they were, did they\nhave discrimination in work, did they ha \u2014 were they \u2014",
        "A: On what time? What \u2014 what \u2014",
        "Q: Before Hitler takes over ger \u2014 Klaipeda, what was the experience of the\nLithuanians living in Klaipeda \u2014",
        "A: In Klaipeda?\u201d",
        "Q: Yeah, with Germans who were so pro-Nazi.\nApril 30, 2012",
        "A: That there was division already in the town. There was already, probably year\nbefore, was known for politicians that Klaipeda will be taken away because the war\naround, they were taking Czechoslovakia, they\u2019re taking there and there and there,\nthat Klaipeda will fall anyway.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It was known. What the people there \u2014 and there were already th-the Lithuanians\nwere discriminating \u2014 the Germans were discriminating, the Lithuanians already in\nSmetona\u2019s time.",
        "Q: In what way?",
        "A: A \u2014 not talking Lithuanian in stores, and the government was quite dominated by\n\u2014 by German \u2014 by [indecipherable] that \u2014 that means the \u2014 the administrators.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. What about \u2014 did you hear about how Jews were being treated in\nKlaipeda\u2019?",
        "A: I have no idea. Ma \u2014 I think that Jews had better time in Klaipeda than probably\nin Lithuania in \u2014 in the gross Lithuania.",
        "Q: In larger Lithuania, yeah.",
        "A: Because Jews integrated very, very nice with the Germans, because they speak\nthe language \u2014 they spoke the language. Now, you would not recognize, is he a Jew,\nor is he a\u2014 a German, because they spoke perfect German.\nApril 30, 2012",
        "Q: But when Hitler came, was there a change there? Did you know \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Oh definite \u2014 definitely there was.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: There was \u2014 I \u2014 I think every Jew ran out. Oh, I don\u2019t think that anyone \u2014 anyone\nstayed. They knew what \u2014 what is to become.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They knew that, th-there\u2019s no \u2014 no \u2014 there is no question.",
        "Q: And do you know how Jews in Kretinga were reacting to all of these events?",
        "A: With fear. With fear. It was \u2014 we knew that \u2014 and I think that the grown-ups\nknew already that \u2014 that wartime, that we will not exist from one, or from another.\nFrom one side or another si \u2014 east or west. But we kids, we didn\u2019t know. We kids,\nwe didn\u2019t know, we just sensed that there is a tension, there is a tension, there is a\ntension. The parents always talk, what will happen to the kids, what will happen to\nus, how they will live, how they \u2014 how their future 1s. Like always they \u2014 they are\nelderly, they are talking and worried about the \u2014 the future generation, how will we\nsurvive when the war starts, and so on.\nApril 30, 2012",
        "Q: Yeah. Well, \u201939 is pretty late, you know, when \u2014 and when \u2014 it\u2019s sort of like the\nbeginning of all these different events. So you recall \u2014",

        "Q: And so half a year later, war is declared on Poland.",

I \u2014 I\u2014 we used to skip \u2014 I used to sing, I used to sing good, and I liked\nto sing. And in the church, the \u2014 the \u2014 the songs are very, very, very beautiful, and\nvery sound \u2014 sound nice, and so. And that time the kids, they said y \u2014 do you know\nPranas, what is going in s \u2014 in Russia \u2014 in Russia that time, not Soviet Union, in\nRussia, in Ukraina(ph). What is going in \u2014 in Soviet Union, or in Russia, how the\nchurches are prosecuted that time. We \u2014 we \u2014 we didn\u2019t believe, as a kid, that \u2014 12\nand a half years old. And we heard already rumors. And then when the final\noccupation came, or invasion, the first invasion in \u2014 1n the summer of 1940, we\nknew. And when we saw the soldiers. There is so much written about that.\nApril 30, 2012",

This is n-natural. This is your preservation, my preservation. If the German\nwas better to me, I would go to German. If the Soviet would be better to me, I go to\nSoviet, so. In that time, we were disappointed. As a kid, we were disappointed that\nApril 30, 2012\n\u2014 with the armaments what they brought, with that \u2014 that everything \u2014 how they\nbehaved, how they were dressed.",

Or someplace, they stay in some place with the tents, and we kids, we go\nthere to them, and they say bring me boulitchkai(ph). Bring me something to eat,\nI\u2019m hungry.

        "A: Friendly.",

        "Q: Did he say anything about it when he came home?",
        "A: He didn\u2019t talk much, he said he was interviewed, everything was fine, because\nhe spoke with Russian. He could express himself in the \u2014 yeah. I\u2019m not against you,\nI\u2019m just a working man and \u2014 and have nothing to do with \u2014 with any \u2014 anything but\npoliticsis(ph).

And this was 10 litas that time, was big money. And the soldiers, they had\nmoney. I don\u2019t know where they got the money. They had no feeling what the\nmoney can buy, so we could cheat them. We could take the money, that\ncherwonse(ph), and not to come. He doesn\u2019t know, he\u2019s behind the gate, he is\nlocked in.

        "A: You just kind of [indecipherable] it. You just kind of \u2014 neither. It did not hurt\nme s-somehow. Although, I had the feeling that if you inflict pain to somebody else,\nthink about yourself. How would you like if somebody takes you with the hand, and\nturns around? I was always aware, cognizance of that \u2014 that I don\u2019t want inflict pain\nto anyone, because I know that it will hurt me. So that I was just indifferent looking.\n110April 30, 2012\nAnd I was not alone, there were some other people.

And \u2014 but otherwise, nobody prosecuted.\nChurch is free. Church is half burned, but we go to the church. The altar 1s still\nthere, organ is gone. We go to church, the Germans did not forbid us. We are\nsinging all the songs. German do not interfere. So we \u2014 we just live. It seems\neverything is fine.

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "A: They\u2019re not screaming. Probably they didn\u2019t know what \u2014 what happened. You\nknow, is better to be shot than to torture like this. Okay, they run around and \u2014 and\nit seems that the Germans, so viciously, more to inflict pain \u2014 okay, people are\nlooking, looking, and all the masses \u2014 not masses, let\u2019s say hundred people from\nboth sides, because that was round.",

Anyway, and the same procedure.\nReviving was dragged into the pond and back, revived and beaten, beaten, beaten\nuntil they couldn\u2019t walk or so. And I remember that time, I don\u2019t know if I was until\nthe end or not, they were again put in the prison, and supposed to be third Sunday.\nYou imagine, every Sunday was spoiled for all the Kretinga that \u2014 that walk, the\n122April 30, 2012\npeople\u2019s enjoyment, with that kind of things.

And \u2014 and you\u2019re 13 years old, 14 years\nold when \u2014 when you see the \u2014 the remnants of what the Soviet prison had, and you\nsee this hand, and you see the chains.

        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And then \u2014 and then you as \u2014 do you assume that then if they weren\u2019t killed\nduring this kind of torture, then they \u2014 tho-tho-those who survived were simply shot\nlater?",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: I want to ask something, going back to the main topic of our \u2014 of our discussion.\nAnd that is, did what you see with that torture and I\u2019d say defilement and cruelty to\nthose Jewish men, did that change you? Did you feel like you \u2014 somehow or other it\nchanged some part of you?",

They made cells,\nthey made a prison where they imprisoned Lithuanians, Lithuanian patriots, burger\n\u2014 mayor or some other, who was not suited for \u2014 for Soviet regime. Okay. There\nwas the prison, and the prison, in the nighttime or daytime, they had the one place\nwhere they used to torture. How they used to torture, I don\u2019t know. I only saw after\nthat, when Germans took over. I saw the place, I saw the skin, I saw the hand, I saw\nsome other paraphernalia there, along there.",
        "A: Human hand. Human hand, all the \u2014 was burned, and like a \u2014 like a glove was\ntaken off. So, and in that what I say prompted me first to give that introduction, that\nwhat was done before \u2014",

        "A: You just kind of [indecipherable] it. You just kind of \u2014 neither. It did not hurt\nme s-somehow. Although, I had the feeling that if you inflict pain to somebody else,\nthink about yourself. How would you like if somebody takes you with the hand, and\nturns around? I was always aware, cognizance of that \u2014 that I don\u2019t want inflict pain\nto anyone, because I know that it will hurt me. So that I was just indifferent looking.\n110April 30, 2012\nAnd I was not alone, there were some other people.

And \u2014 but otherwise, nobody prosecuted.\nChurch is free. Church is half burned, but we go to the church. The altar 1s still\nthere, organ is gone. We go to church, the Germans did not forbid us. We are\nsinging all the songs. German do not interfere. So we \u2014 we just live. It seems\neverything is fine. Now, every Sunday, you know, after the turmoil which we lived\nthrough that, and the front, and the Soviet time, after that, people used to go for a\nwalk in the city, in that city, even was burned, but used to walk around the\nmarketplace. And there was a beautiful park, Varninas(ph), because there were so\nmany crows. We call \u2014",

        "A: \u2014man. Able body. They\u2019re hiding. They were hiding, and they were rounded up\none by one and put downstairs in the prison, in Antano(ph) Namalas(ph), where\nthe Lithuanian patriots were 1-imprisoned. You see how that \u2014",
        "A: Same place. Now they said people come and look at those who \u2014 traitors who\nescaped. And then, people stopped because they \u2014 they parade. In German we call\nSpazieren.\n113\nApril 30, 2012",

And\nsuddenly, there come a car, German, like officers, SS and some soldiers, and finally\nthey chase out, out of the prison about 16 young Jewish man.",
        "A: They looked with suits, still nice dressed. Some probably already tortured. They\ncome there and they had to run around, you know. Was announced in German, we\ndid not understand. Nothing Lithuanian. And now we \u2014 all the Lithuanians are\nlooking. Suddenly, they take sticks, they take belts, they take longer guns, and these\npeople are running around, and they started to hit them. Jesus. They started to hit,\nand they go around, around, you know. That takes about five minutes, 10 minutes.\nThe blood is already going.",
        "A: They\u2019re not screaming. Probably they didn\u2019t know what \u2014 what happened. You\nknow, is better to be shot than to torture like this. Okay, they run around and \u2014 and\nit seems that the Germans, so viciously, more to inflict pain \u2014 okay, people are\nlooking, looking, and all the masses \u2014 not masses, let\u2019s say hundred people from\nboth sides, because that was round.\n114April 30, 2012",
        "A: I could even make a picture there or \u2014",

Where they\nwatching, they start to leave. They don\u2019t want to see. Like us, we want to see what\u2019s\n\u2014 what \u2014 what \u2014 what will happen.",
        "A: Yeah. Kids and some \u2014 some other \u2014 some people can, some people cannot.\nNow, I cannot imagine. People start to disappear, and \u2014 and they start to, about half\nan hour, the people hit, when they cannot walk any more, when they fall on that,\nand they pretend like they are dead, the other prisoners have to take them, and put in\nthe pond, 300 feet away in the pond, where I \u2014 to revive.",
        "A: Yeah. They had to revive. Now, when the \u2014 the people who cannot, you \u2014 they\nare all dead, they want to drown themselves. They go in the middle of the pond and\n[indecipherable] the others ones have to pull them out, and again the same, the\nsame.\n115April 30, 2012",

        "A: Very quietly. They \u2014 they didn\u2019t want to talk. Nobody wants to talk about\nanything that time. The kids, we talked that we saw that and that and so on. Now,\nthat time when they ended, they announced that next Sunday the same. Now, not to\nextend th-the story, next Sunday was the same. The same people down. There is an-\nanother probably 30. They caught another bunch of hidden people. And the ones\nwho were already dirty, with \u2014 with \u2014 w-with the \u2014 with the wounds, with\neverything, and I saw how the German, with \u2014 with \u2014 with sword, cut one, the ear\nwas hanging here, I saw that. You imagine, how could I live not \u2014 not putting this to\nhistory? Was hanging. I don\u2019t know if th \u2014 he survived or not, but that time when\nthey ran around. Now the people came and you could detect which one was torture\nalready, which came with the nice suit, nice shirt and everything. And after a half an\nhour, they all looked the same. The same scenery, the same torture, the same\nbeating. Now, if the same soldiers beat, I cannot tell. I don\u2019t recognize that \u2014 that \u2014\n120April 30, 2012\nthe Germans.

Anyway, and the same procedure.\nReviving was dragged into the pond and back, revived and beaten, beaten, beaten\nuntil they couldn\u2019t walk or so. And I remember that time, I don\u2019t know if I was until\nthe end or not, they were again put in the prison, and supposed to be third Sunday.\nYou imagine, every Sunday was spoiled for all the Kretinga that \u2014 that walk, the\n122April 30, 2012\npeople\u2019s enjoyment, with that kind of things.
