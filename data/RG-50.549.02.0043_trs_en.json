        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection,\nthis is an interview with Liane Reif-Lehrer, conducted by Sandy Tolen, on May 28\",\n1999, in Lexington, Mass-Massachusetts. This is a follow up interview to a United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum vido-videotaped interview, conducted with L-Liane Reif-\nLehrer, on -- in 1989.",
        "Answer: It was early 1990.",
        "Q: Or early 1990. We\u2019ll provide that date shortly, matter of fact -- the United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making\nthis interview possible. This is tape number one, side A. Okay, so, now we start and we\nknow who we\u2019re sitting with. So, I guess there\u2019s -- there\u2019s some things probably, that\nhave occurred to you since then, that you might want to -- to explore, and I want to invite\nyou to take the opportunity, during the context of what we\u2019re talking about, or the\nchronology, or if there\u2019s things that just come up along the way that you want to discuss,\nwe can do that.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Okay.",
        "Q: And I first of all want to thank you for taking the time to sit and talk. And I know that\n-- that some of these memories are painful, and -- and I respect your journey, and\nappreciate you sitting and talking with me.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "Q: I guess I wanted to first ask if you could maybe take us back and -- and to the extent\nthat you can return us to a child\u2019s memory, and through a child\u2019s eyes, and in a child\u2019s\nheart, remember the feelings that you had when you were leaving Limoge an-and\ntraveling through Spain. As I recall from the interview that you did, that you were on a\ntrain and, remember at all what you were thinking during that time, what was going\nthrough your mind? I know that you were very young, so a lot of it was probably a blur\nnow, but remember what was going on in your mind and your heart? What were you\nthinking about, what were you concerned about?",
        "A: I don\u2019t really remember an awful lot. I -- I think I often felt -- I guess you could call it\na sense of confusion, by things that were going on, for example, as I mentioned in the --\nin the video interview 10 years ago, it was strange things that happened. For example, I\nwas told never to lie, and then all of a sudden, I\u2019m told to lie to the German soldiers, and\n-- and make believe that I can\u2019t understand German, or speak German, when that was my\nobvious, fluent, first language. I -- I think I remember being, I don\u2019t know whether\ndisturbed is exactly the right word, but for example, the -- the crowded, awful conditions\non that train. I mean, I remember that quite clearly, so many people crowded into a such a\n-- a little space, and -- and crowded in, not the way we had been crowded in our living\nquarter, even when we were living, you know, 30 females in this -- in this little room, but\ncrowded in a chaotic way. All these people, with these -- all these packages and I seem to\nremember it was night time and I guess it -- I guess maybe it was a little scary at times.\nAnd so I -- I remember a feeling of apprehension often, but other than that, I don\u2019t -- you\nknow, I remember -- my memories of that time are very much -- I was trying to explain\nthis to people, they\u2019re like still photographs that somebody just snapped, along the path of\nmy life. As opposed to my brother, who\u2019s much older, and who really sort of remembers\nthem like a videotape. I mean, you know, this happened, and then this happened, and then\nthis happened. And for me, it\u2019s a bunch of stills that --",
        "Q: Go ahead.",
        "A: -- that capture either very significant times -- significant to me, as a little kid, because\nthere was some traumatic thing happening, or some trivial thing happening that captured\nmy imagination. So I don\u2019t remember -- as a matter of fact, throughout my life, I\u2019ve tried\nto retrace that journey and just -- there -- there were only two places left to go last year,\nand so, actually in October, my husband and I went on a bicycle trip to -- to Portugal,\nbecause that was the next to the last place, of the places that I had been, that I had not\nrevisited. And as -- as I said 10 years ago in the interview, I -- I always think when I do\none of these things, that maybe I\u2019Il come across something that will sort of stir something\nin my brain, enough to make me remember what happened here. And so, as we were\nwalking through the streets of Lisbon, I mean, we built about -- I think it was about four\ndays into staying in Lisbon, before the bicycle trip began, just because I wanted to\nexplore, and see if I could remember anything, but absolutely nothing struck a bell, that I\ncould tell, in Lisbon. And we -- I -- we were apparently there for about two weeks. So\nthere\u2019s one -- there\u2019s one more place. We -- We did stop very briefly in two cities in\nSpain, and I -- I\u2019d still like to go to those places, one of them is Madrid. But I -- I think\nI\u2019ve kind of run through the gamut of things that are going to jog my -- my brain, and --\nand now, especially because I\u2019m getting older and -- and at least short term memory is --\nis getting worse, I think -- well, you know, I mean, the -- the ta -- unless -- unless I get\nAlzheimer\u2019s and -- and, you know, and suddenly things pop out of what I call my little\nblack box, I think whatever I\u2019ve remembered, is what I\u2019m going to remember, and -- and\nnothing else.",
        "Q: When you talk about snapshots, I mean, are -- are there particular -- I guess it comes\nto mind this sort of images frozen in time, in a sense, in -- in your memory. Are there\nparticularly memorable images like that, from that journey that -- that -- that you recall? I\nmean, that -- that perhaps you -- you didn\u2019t talk about it er -- 1n the earlier interview?",
        "A: You mean from the journey through Spain into Portugal?",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: Only that scene of all that chaos on the train. Other than that, I don\u2019t remember\nanything. I mean, I have -- I have an image which is not mine, that my brother has told\nmany times, of -- of switching trains at the -- at the Spanish - Portuguese border, and\ngoing from this incredibly messy, chaotic situation, and in -- and having been really quite\nhungry for the last year and a half, coming into this very nice train, with this -- my bro --\nwhen my brother tells the story, his eyes just light up about the, you know, the sudden\nsmell of fresh rolls and -- but -- but that\u2019s not my own memory, I mean, I\u2019ve just heard\nhim tell that so often that I almost feel as though I -- I remember it, but I -- I don\u2019t, really.\nI do remember, actually, when we got on the ship in -- in Lisbon, to come to the United\nStates. I remember tables set for meals in -- in the dining room, and -- and I think -- I\nthink I remember having dinner the first night, or some meal the first night, and then the\nrest of the time, we were horrendously seasick and we\u2019d -- I don\u2019t think we essentially ate\nanything else for the rest of the journey, as far as I can remember. I just -- I remember -- I\nremember feeling awful, and barfing and -- but that\u2019s all I remember, until -- until we\nactually got to the U.S., and then I remember that -- that awful time of having this\nmedical check, which I -- which I mentioned in the -- in the video.",
        "Q: Just -- Yeah, everybody sitting there with thermometers in their mouth.",
        "A: Right, right, right. Thermometers that I had never seen the likes of before, and feeling\n-- [remember feeling a sort of halfway between being frightened and being puzzled\nabout, you know, why were they doing this and were they going to make us go back?",
        "Q: D-Do you -- Do you think that you had a sense at that time, or do you remember an\nemotion at that time, about why you were doing this, why you were going? Do you --\nWas it -- Was it conscious for a little girl that -- you were what, four and a half at the\ntime?",
        "A: Well, I was seven by the time we got here.",
        "Q: Oh, oh, course. Okay.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I really understood what was happening, but I knew there was a reason to\nbe afraid. I sort of knew that there were people who were chasing us and wanted to do\nbad things, and I knew that -- I sort of had a sense that if we could come here, that things\nwere going to be better or okay or -- or something. That this was sort of a goal, of getting\naway from this bad scene. And so, that day when we were having these medical\ncheckups, I don\u2019t know how I knew this, I mean, maybe my mother had said some things,\nor maybe | heard other passengers, but I n -- I think I was aware that if there was\nsomething wrong with you, that you could be sent back. But other than that, I don\u2019t\nremember anything else.",
        "Q: So when you -- well then, you\u2019ve -- you\u2019ve told this a little bit, so I won\u2019t ask you to\ndwell on it, but what -- what are some of your most vivid memories, early memories,\nonce you got off the boat and -- and you stayed with the Klinghoffers, right, your -- your\n-- your cousins? What are the things that -- that stick out most from those early days,\nwhether it\u2019s staying with them, or other kinds of adjustments that you had to make during\nthat -- during the time which -- which would have been what, in \u201941 now we\u2019re talking\nabout.",
        "A: We got here on November 10\", 1941. I guess in a lot of ways, I mean, I had learned\nby then to be very malleable. I mean, you know, I got thrown -- I mean, I remem -- for\nexample, I\u2019m a really fantastic sleeper. I ca -- I mean when I -- 99 percent of the time,\nwhen I go to sleep, I\u2019m asleep before my head hits the pillow, practically. And, until the\nchildren were born, there would be nothing, other than the telephone, that could wake me\nup, and I\u2019m still a really fantastically good sleeper, and sometimes people ask about that,\nand I say, well, I think that had to do, first of all because when I was little, and I had a -- a\ngoverness in Vienna, apparently she let me cry myself to sleep, so I re -- I must have\nlearned that there was no recourse when you had to go to sleep, than to sleep. But I think\nthe other reason is that, over those next few years, I mean, I slept in so many bizarre\nsituations, I mean like, sleeping one night on this scale in the railroad station. And I just\nkind of learned that, you know, when it\u2019s time to sleep, you just, regardless of what\nhappens, you sleep. And I remember, I had a one hour commute to go to Barnard\nCollege, cause we lived in -- in Brooklyn, and I -- I think I actually sometimes could fall\nasleep standing up in the subway, holding on to the strap. And now, I mean, just the last\nfew days, I\u2019ve actually been posing -- our son is an artist and I\u2019ve been posing for him,\nand I -- I find that that\u2019s really hard work. But I find that sometimes I\u2019m standing there,\nand I actually have dozed off standing up, while I\u2019m, you know, clamped into a particular\nposition.",
        "Q: Mom, it\u2019s time to cha -- Mom.",
        "A: Right. So, I think I just learned to be very malleable, and so when I got to graduate\nschool and I met the guy who\u2019s now my husband, and I went on some camping trips for\nthe first time, I -- I mean, I had never experienced that and so we -- a group of us went\nand we just had these zero pound sleeping bags and rolled them out on a rock and so -- all\nright, so the group said, \u201cAll right, we\u2019re going -- going to sleep now.\u201d So I just laid\ndown on this rock and fell asleep. And my husband, who was supposed to be the\nexperienced camper, you know, every three minutes -- he was lying next to me and\nwaking me up and, \u201cSh, what\u2019s that?\u201d You know, \u201cWhat\u2019s that noise?\u201d Or -- Or, \u201cBoy\nthis rock 1s hard,\u201d or something like -- and it -- I mean, those things just really -- when we\n-- during the Kennedy elections, we didn\u2019t have a television, and I was at a friend\u2019s house\nand I think this is an apocryphal story, but he claims that I fell asleep while we were\nwatching television and that he accidentally stepped on me and I didn\u2019t wake up. So -- So\nI think I just have this -- I mean, I\u2019m not -- there are a lot of ways in which I\u2019m not\nflexible, but in terms of physical surround, I think because of what happened, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m\nvery flexible. I mean, my husband needs a certain kind of a bed before he can fall asleep,\nyou know, and a certain surround. And other people I\u2019ve been with, have to kind of do\ncertain things, and get themselves ready for sleeping and so on. And I just -- that\u2019s just\nnot requirement for me, you know, whatever is there, I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t have -- \u2019ma\npicky eater in one way, but I don\u2019t mind not eating and so -- so I\u2019m -- I\u2019ve -- I think\nbecause of those years, I\u2019m just very malleable in terms of, you know, those physical\nthings and -- and -- and needs. I think I\u2019ve strayed now, from what you asked me.",
        "Q: No, but I -- Actually that\u2019s -- it\u2019s interesting, the whole notion of malleability in some\nparts of your life, but not others.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: I mean, and -- and -- and you -- you were saying, if I\u2019m understanding you right, that\nthat\u2019s a part of what yo -- how you learned to adapt to circumstances when you were very\nyoung, right?",
        "A: Yes, yes. So -- So anyway, okay, now I\u2019ve regained the thread of what you asked, so\nokay, so I got to my aunt\u2019s house and my Aunt Lena ha-had one of her kids move out of\nthis -- what I remember being a really tiny little room, and my mother and my brother and\nI got to live in there for about three months. And so, you know that was all right, I mean,\nI'd done that kind of thing before and as I\u2019m -- as I said on the video interview, I mean,\npeople thought that we would just kind of gobble up anything that was offered to us to\neat, and I -- I didn\u2019t. I mean, a lot of things that people presented to me were awful, and I\nmean, one of the things that -- that I came to realize in that time is that adults do really\nbizarre things to children, you know. I mean -- And I\u2019m -- I\u2019m aware of this still now, as\nan adult, and I think this very much colored the way we raised our children. But, for\nexample, I -- they would put me on a swing, they would take me to the park and put me\non a swing, and I would say, \u201cPlease don\u2019t do that.\u201d But they would insist and they would\nput me on the swing and start swinging me, and I would barf. And I knew I was going to\nbarf, cause I knew that I couldn\u2019t -- I -- I was just so subject to motion of any kind. But\nthey would just insist. And then my -- my Aunt Lena\u2019s brother owned what was called a\nluncheonette in New York, and so when I visited him, which was not terribly often, but --\nbut more so in the early days, he thought he was doing me this big favor, and he would\npresent me with, you know, a big sundae, with lots of whipped cream. Well, here\u2019s a little\nkid, age seven, who has had almost nothing to eat for a year and a half, and he would\ninsist that I eat this. Well, you know, putting whipped cream, which is like a lot of fat,\ninto a little kid\u2019s system, who hasn\u2019t eaten anything for a year and a half, just doesn\u2019t\nwork out very well. And adults don\u2019t listen. I mean, you try to say, \u201cExcuse me, but I -- I\nreally would not like to eat this.\u201d Total, you know, ignoring o-of that. I\u2019ve --",
        "Q: And what were the consequences of that?",
        "A: I used to feel really sick after a sundae, or even in -- even later, my -- after -- I mean,\nmany years later, my cousin Dorothy, who was the youngest daughter of my Aunt Lena,\nmarried a doctor and they had kids, and I would sometimes baby-sit for them, or I would\njust go and visit, and I would often eat dinner there. And I\u2019ve never been much of a meat\neater, and I\u2019m getting worse as the years go by, but first of all, ma -- when my mother\nmade meat, she salted it and then she always cooked it extremely well done, so it was\nalways very brown looking. And I would eat that, and I guess I sort of enjoyed some of\nthose dishes at the time. But at my cousin\u2019s house, she would make this rare steak, you\nknow, like a big, thick Filet Mignon kind of thing, and it looked as though it was still\nalive. And I would say, \u201cI\u2019d rather not eat that.\u201d And -- I mean, they just wouldn\u2019t take no\nfor an answer, and my cousin, th-the doctor -- the husband, would say, \u201cYou are going to\neat that,\u201d you know, and I would sit there, at her house, having dinner, with this tears\nstreaming down my eyes, trying to force this bloody mess down my throat. I mean, I\ndon\u2019t know -- you know, they were trying to be nice, but I think -- again, I just think\npeople don\u2019t listen to what kids have to say, and so -- so there were some traumas like\nthat, that -- that happened. But anyway, at -- at my Aunt Lena\u2019s, you know, life was okay.\nI -- She was not very insistent on that I eat things that I didn\u2019t like, and so we just kind of\nstayed there and I ate. I don\u2019t -- I have no recollection of how I kept myself busy during\nthe day, during those three months, cause I wasn\u2019t in school or anything. I remember\nbeing sort of -- very watchful of my cousin Dorothy. She was -- That was the youngest\ndaughter, you know, who later married this doctor. She was very pretty and very -- She\nwore nice clothes and I remember she had this really attractive -- as a matter of fact, I\nhave a -- a picture of her, I think, in this hat with beaver trim, you know, big, broad -- and\nI kind of watched her a lot, and I think I really liked her. She was sort of my favorite\ncousin, in the beginning. And then -- So we -- we kind of stayed there and my mother\nwent around, trying to figure out what to do, and then we finally found this apartment in\nBrooklyn and I think -- I think the rent was like 46 dollars a month at the beginning. So\nwe moved to Brooklyn, and that was kind of far away from where my aunt lived, in the\nlower east side of Manhattan, but it was only two blocks away from another relative, so\nthat cousin, who lived in Brooklyn, whose name is Hilda Towderer, and who just had her\n80\" birthday, she -- I just got a letter from her about a week ago, I th -- I\u2019m pretty sure\nnow that it was to her parent\u2019s home, and she, of course was living there, she was a kid,\nthat we went the day my father died. And that\u2019s where my mother and father were\nsupposed to meet again. So, I have occasional contact with her and in recent years, we\u2019ve\nactually corresponded, you know, several times a year. So anyway, so -- so we moved\nand she already had a little boy, who unfortunately died of, I think, lymphoma, about, I\ndon\u2019t know, 10 or 15 years ago, and then she had a set of twins. She had another child\nmany years later, but I -- I never have even seen that other child. But anyway, so we had\nthis other sort of relative, and -- and we set up in this apartment, on the fourth floor of\n1092 President Street in Brooklyn, wh-which I think stands out in my mind, because I\ndon\u2019t -- I don\u2019t remember anything green on that block. There was an empty lot, there\nmight have been a couple of trees, but if they were, they were small and very few -- I\nmean, it was really a kind of stark thing, and there was an armory across the street, and so\nthe armory was like a solid brick wall that went for most of the block. We used to use that\nto play ball against. And then at the end of the block, there was a little synagogue. But it\nwas a very stark block and it was -- it was probably largely Jewish, but it was -- it was\nquite mixed, also. I mean, you know, there was an Irish family and a this family and a\nthat family and -- and there was Forbes, the black super and -- and there were -- there\nwere two children with birth defects. It was very -- It was kind of a very mixed bag. And\nnow I really start to remember things much more cohesively, so -- so a lot of things\nhappened on this block, you know, right from the beginning. First of all, my mother\nstarted working in a factory, which was a terrible mistake, but sh -- and she worked there\nuntil she retired, and that was horrible for her. And my brother and I went to school. But\nafter a fairly short time, I don\u2019t remember exactly -- 1t must have been like maybe 1944,\nso it\u2019s about three years after we came, my brother got drafted into the army. That was a\nterrible, terrible event for me and for my mother. I mean, you know, we just got out of all\nthis mess and now my brother is going and we didn\u2019t know what was going to happen\nand I-I mean that was just horrible, but -- so in the meantime, I started school when we\nmoved in there, and at first that was kind of awful, because I couldn\u2019t speak English and\nthe kids were always whispering around me and --",
        "Q: What did you feel like, they were teasing you, or they -- were they taunting you, or --",
        "A: No, they were just talking about me, I think.",
        "Q: Who is this girl, sort of?",
        "A: Yeah, you know, and what does she -- how come she doesn\u2019t say anything, and you\nknow, whatever. But --",
        "Q: Did you feel uncomfortable?",
        "A: Very uncomfortable.",
        "Q: In what way? I mean, in -- obviously, one can imagine why, but --",
        "A: Well, I felt, first of all, I felt really different, I felt really left out. It\u2019s like sitting in a\nroom and ee -- there\u2019s a -- there\u2019s a famous painting called \u201cThe Scream\u201d --",
        "Q: Der Shrie, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, and I think it\u2019s sort of that feeling, you know, you sort of want to cover yourself\nover and -- and disappear, or -- there\u2019s just a really uncomfortable situation for a kid.\nNow, I have felt that often as an adult, but as an adult, it doesn\u2019t strike you that way. Give\nyou just a -- a trivial example; somehow, in our society, you know, you -- you learn\ncertain ridiculous things about what should be and what shouldn\u2019t be, and I\u2019ve never\nreally paid much attention to that, but still, I mean I had never like, gone out to dinner by\nmyself. You know, your -- you either don\u2019t go out to dinner, I guess, or you -- you know,\nwhich 1s ridiculous, cause lo -- lots of people go out to dinner by themselves, now\nespecially. But -- But I just had never done that, and so 15 years ago, or 13 years ago,\nrather, when I made my career change, and I started doing a lot of traveling, in what I call\none night stands in not so cheap hotels, so you know, you -- you get to this place, and you\nregister at the hotel, you go down and have dinner, you finish doing your homework, you\ngo to sleep, the next day you do your work, and you leave. And so I was always eating\ndinner by myself, or almost always. And at first, I found that extremely uncomfortable,\nlike everybody is looking at me, you know, what is this woman doing, you know, eating\nby herself? And I would take a book or the newspaper, or -- or something, and try to read\nwhile I was eating. And of course, after a certain number of years, that whole situation\nturned around. I mean, now, sometimes if I -- if the host -- the person who is hosting me\nsays, you know, \u201cWould you like to come to dinner?\u201d That\u2019s nice and -- and I often enjoy\nthat, but lots of times I feel as though, you know, it\u2019s really a lot more fun eating dinner\nby myself and being able to do what I want and leave when I want and -- and not have to\nmake polite conversation with somebody who may not be that interesting and so on. But,\nas a child, I think it\u2019s hard to come to that second station. You know, you just sort of feel\nyou\u2019re alone, everybody\u2019s looking at you. And I think that\u2019s what I felt a lot, in school.\nWell, I learned English very quickly. I think -- Within about three months, I think I was\nspeaking quite fluently.",
        "Q: That\u2019s amazing.",
        "A: So -- Well, it was, you know, a third language. And I think when you\u2019re a kid, it\u2019s\nreally easy, you know?",
        "Q: Yeah. And plus, you know, it was so necessary.",
        "A: It was so necessary. And then I did something that my brother tried to keep me from\ndoing, but I did 1t anyway, and of course, I\u2019ve regretted it ever since, and that is that I\nreally tried very hard not to speak either German or French. Now, I had to speak German\nto my mother, because she took a long time to -- to learn English, and actually for years\nand years and years, I always -- she always wrote to me in German and I -- I think after\nawhile I started -- I -- well, I never learned how to really write German, so I think I\nanswered in English, but -- so my brother would say, \u201cDon\u2019t -- You know, practice the\nFrench, practice the German, don\u2019t forget it.\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t -- you know, I\ndon\u2019t want to -- I want to just forget all that.\u201d And that was unfortunate. But anyway,\nthat\u2019s --",
        "Q: D-Do you not speak German now\u201d?",
        "A: Well, I do, but like a five year old. I mean, I can manage when I get there. We -- We\nwere just in Switzerland a few weeks ago on a business trip and I mean, all the sort of\ndaily necessities, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m fine, but I can\u2019t discuss a book or something, you know, I\nhave --",
        "Q: Mm. Mm-hm.",
        "A: So -- And French is -- I mean, that\u2019s an interesting thing in itself, the -- when our kids\nwere taking -- I think our daughter took German in school and she\u2019d call down and say,\n\u201cMa, how do you say --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: -- Memorial Museum interview with Liane Reif-Lehrer. This 1s tape number one, side\nB. Okay, and you were talking about French.",
        "A: So French, which I -- as I say I really learned to speak quite fluently and I went to\nschool there, and then I took it again for, I don\u2019t know, a f -- a few years in high school.\nBut when I have to speak French, first of all, it takes me longer to get into it, and\nsecondly, it\u2019s definitely coming out of my head, not -- not some gut reaction, and it\u2019s\nharder. So there\u2019s -- there\u2019s some difference there, between when I learned those\nlanguages. But anyway, so I learned how to speak English, and made some little friends,\nyou know, friends 1n quotes, because I don\u2019t -- I mean that\u2019s -- one of the things I\u2019ve\nalways been troubled by during my life is, what is the definition of real friend? I -- I\nmean, I find that a really -- that\u2019s a really -- I mean, my husband 1s a real friend, but I\nhave a hard time trying to think about other people. I mean, I -- I guess I don\u2019t have a lot\nof real friends, in my definition. I have a lot of acquaintances, and some of them are\nbetter acquaintances than others. But God, I\u2019ve probably discussed the topic of what --\nwhat is friendship, ad nauseum.",
        "Q: What -- What -- What is -- What is your definition of friendship and how has it been\nformed, do you think, by your experience?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I think -- I think -- My husband always says that I\u2019m a real romantic,\nand a real idealist at heart, and so | think a real friendship 1s maybe like the legend of\nDamon and Pythias -- our son is named Damon -- where somebody will do ver -- almost\nanything for the other person, and where, maybe even more important, and on a day to\nday basis, where the person thinks of you almost as much as they thing of themselves,\nand -- [phone ringing |",
        "Q: Where the person thinks of you as much as -- as -- as of themselves.",
        "A: And where the person is almost totally selfless, with respect to -- to the friend. Where\nanything can be discussed, nothing 1s off limits. Anything that\u2019s discussed, is discussed in\na reasonable, rational way, to be talked out and talked through and it doesn\u2019t engender\nany real anger or permanent scarring, or anything like that. And I don\u2019t -- I mean, I don\u2019t\n-- I sometimes wonder whether that sort of relationship really exists to any extent 1n the\nworld. I -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not -- I\u2019m not sure that it does, but I -- I think that -- I feel that\nrelationship with my husband, I feel that relationship with my children, and I feel that\nrelationship, but in a funny way, with my brother. I th -- My brother and I have an\nemotionally very close relationship, but I think in our -- in our heads, in the -- in the\nintellectual parts of our heads, we live in somewhat different worlds. That\u2019s a whole other\nstory, I think, about what happened to us, and about his being older and really being\nmuch more affected by everything that happened, but I mean, like I can -- well, we both\nlike to tell jokes, I mean we -- my brother and I can sit down and tell jokes for a whole\nevening, but I -- he\u2019s a much more serious person. He\u2019s a -- He has a much narrower area\nin which he operates. I think I\u2019m much -- He\u2019s -- He\u2019s very tolerant, in the sense that, you\nknow, he\u2019s not prejudiced against anything or anybody or anything like that, but he\u2019s\nvery intolerant about what he\u2019s willing to do. He doesn\u2019t like to waste his time, whereas I\nth -- I think -- I mean, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m pretty serious in many ways also, but I\u2019m much more\nhappy go lucky in -- in a way, and I -- I mean, like yesterday I got a letter from somebody\nwho wanted to know if I could help them find a job, and I -- I mean, this person 1s like\nway outside of my -- any area that I conceivably have any contact with, and you know, so\nI called him and he wanted to chat and so we chatted for a-an -- and also, the-there was\nan article Globe about me, la -- the week before last, and he wanted to discuss that, so I --\nyou know, I spent 20 minutes with him. I -- I\u2019m not sure, because I don\u2019t see my brother\non a day to day basis, but I don\u2019t think my brother would have the patience or the\ninclination to do that. But I -- I\u2019m not sure. He -- He\u2019s just -- He\u2019s much more tied up in\nhis work and what he feels he needs to do, and he does not tend to do frivolous things,\nwhereas I do a lot of frivolous things, even though most of the time, I\u2019m -- you know, I --\nI live a fairly serious life, but --",
        "Q: You -- Do you think it -- I mean, it just occurred to me that perhaps this could have\nsomething to do with -- or maybe not, but -- but perha -- I was just wondering if 1t might\nhave something to do with the fact that since he\u2019s older, his experience of the -- the -- the\nbrutal meaning of what happened to the family, helps create this -- this sort of difference\nin the personalities that you are describing?",
        "A: Oh a -- Oh, absolutely, but -- but I think, although I don\u2019t know this, I only know this\nfrom -- from hearsay, but my mother always told me that my brother was a very serious\nchild, even when he was two years old. You know, that other kids would want to sort of\nplay, and he would want to have my mother read him the street signs and explain to him\nhow that -- why certain words are spelled in a certain way, and -- now, I don\u2019t know what\ncame first, but I -- I do wonder about this, but they started him on violin lessons, I think\nwhen he was three years old, and that didn't work out, so they stopped him at the\nsuggestion of the teacher, and then they started again, I think when he was about five\nmaybe, or six. And that definitely took and he -- h-he would tell you that he\u2019s an amateur\nviolinist, which he is, but I think he -- and I\u2019m not a musician, so I shouldn\u2019t judge, but\nhe really plays, you know, quite well. I mean, I don\u2019t know that he could go out and give\na concert, but he -- he does play chamber music with other people and so on. So -- And --\nAnd [| -- And that\u2019s actually one of the things that I remember with great pleasure, but --\nbut also something else. When we lived in this apartment that we moved into in New\nYork, my brother would practice violin, often for many, many hours, and I was not\nallowed into the room. But sometimes, as a special treat, he would let me come in while\nhe was playing. And I remember I would sit on his bed and I would just watch him, in a -\n- in absolute silence, and I remember sometimes I would just -- you know, little tears\nwould come, because it -- when he plays the violin, he looks as though he\u2019s transported\ninto some other world, and I find that very moving.",
        "Q: Do you think -- Do you imagine what other world that is?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I think -- I think I think of it as some very special wonderful place, that\nhe can\u2019t really live in as a real person, except when he\u2019s playing. But anyway, so -- so\ngetting way back to -- to what was it like, so we -- so we moved into this place and -- and\nI learned English, and I was going to school, and I was a -- I was a very good student.\nNow, why was | a very good student? I think there were several reasons. One was, maybe\n-- maybe there was just something comforting about -- about the logic of school, and the\nthings that you learned in school, and -- I mean, I always did my homework, but I did\nmore than my homework. Like when we learned vocabulary, or later, when I was, you\nknow, when I started taking French, which was in high school. I mean, in addition to\ndoing my homework, I -- I would write words three times each, you know, or if -- and\npart of that was also my brother. I mean my brother -- my brother was very much of a\nmentor, and so when -- whenever I needed any help or anything, he was there until he --\nhe left, a-and then -- and he also -- I think he also used me as a kind of guinea pig,\nbecause I mean, he was much older, so you know, when he was already in high school\nand college, I was -- I was still a little kid.",
        "Q: Is he what, seven, eight years older?",
        "A: Seven and a half years older.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And I loved when he taught me things, so I mean, some of the things I remember from\nthose 1092 President Street years, very often on a Sunday morning, I would open my\neyes and my brother would be standing over my bed with an algebra book. And as soon\nas my -- I opened my eyes, he would hop into bed and -- with a pad and paper and this\nalgebra book and we would sit there for maybe an hour or more and he would get me to\ndo algebra word problems. And so I didn\u2019t know -- and this was very good for me -- I\ndidn\u2019t know that algebra was something that na -- that a lot of people didn\u2019t like to do.\nFor me, doing algebra word problems was like doing the Sunday crossword puzzle. I\nmean, I thought that was, you know, great. But he -- he -- when he learned something\nnew, he would come home and -- and often try to teach it to me, and I really enjoyed that\nmost of the time, and I -- I mean, I learned an en-enormous amount. I mean, for example,\nhe would -- like if my mother needed a new plug put on a lamp, he would do that and\nthen he would teach me how to do that, so --",
        "Q: It sounds like he was really, either consciously, or just naturally playing the -- the role\nof the man of the family.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s what people say, and I don\u2019t know, maybe that\u2019s true, but I don\u2019t think I\never consciously or -- thought or him as a father, I mean, or even as a father figure. He\nwas very Serious and he was very strict with me, but -- but he was not like any parent that\nI ever met. [phone ringing]",
        "Q: So you were talking about -- oh you\u2019re -- do you recall what you were saying?",
        "A: Yes. So, my brother -- I mean like, if he learned something exciting, he would come\nhome -- I -- I mean I remember, for example, a subway ride into town with him, and he\ntaught me all about what he had just learned about genetics, you know, and crossing\nwhite Japanese Four O\u2019Clock flowers with red ones, and you know, how many red, white\nand pink ones you get, and so on. And then I often used that for my own purposes. For\nexample, whatever grade I was in, everybody had to give a little five minute or 10\nminutes seminar or something. So I got up there and -- and decided, oh this sounds really\nexciting, I\u2019m going to talk about genetics. And I think I was like in third grade or\nsomething, and I don\u2019t know, kids are funny and -- and so I got up there and I said,\n\u201cWell, when you mate a Japanese, you know red Japanese Four O\u2019Clock,\u201d and so on, and\nthe whole class started tittering, and -- and I think I was -- I was sort of embarrassed,\nbecause you know, with my brother, and I spent a lot of time with his friends at times,\nyou know, you talk about, you know, the flowers mate with each other and so on and so\nforth, but here, in this third gla -- grade P.S. 241 -- my brother always said that P.S. stood\nfor poor suckers, you know everybody starts tittering when you say this, and so, I mean\nvery early, I -- there was this dichotomy that happened in my mind about this world that\nmy brother lived in, compared to this ridiculous world that I was living in. The other\nthing that happened to me in that school was that in the one year I went to school in\nLimoge -- in the European system, I learned, except for American history, I learned\neverything that I learned, in the American school, to the end of fourth grade. So, if I\nweren\u2019t such a dedicated pupil somehow, and always interested [phone ringing |",
        "Q: [inaudible]",
        "A: So -- So I was -- I was kind of a goody-goody and I wa -- I always got to be the\nteacher\u2019s pet, and I did all those right things and so I somehow got -- managed to keep\ninterested in school, even though I already knew most of this stuff. And then a funny\nthing happened at some point. My brother came home one day and he said, \u201cToday I\u2019m\ngoing to teach you about probability.\u201d\u2019 Now he -- I think he was maybe already in college\nat that point. And I said, \u201cOh Fred, I -- \u2019'm s -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m really ti -- I really don\u2019t want to\nhear about probability now.\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, all right, then I won\u2019t love you any\nmore.\u201d And -- And I said, \u201cAll right, never mind, just teach me about probability.\u201d And\nso we had this long lecture about probability, which actually was a lot of fun. It\u2019s just that\nI probably -- I don\u2019t know, I wanted to go out and play or -- or do something else. So,\nnow -- I mean, he didn\u2019t do that very often, but -- but 1t was --",
        "Q: But it\u2019s a powerful --",
        "A: It was a very powerful ploy.",
        "Q: Does he remember that?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. He doesn\u2019t remember a lot of -- I -- one of the things that I discovered\nis that when you\u2019re young and impressionable, you remember things that older people do\nto you, but they don\u2019t remember. You know, I mean like, if an adult says blah, blah, blah\nand it hurts you, or -- or pleases you, you remember it, but to them it was just something\nthey said.",
        "Q: Right. Is your memory that -- I mean, is 1t an upsetting memory in a way? I mean\nthat\u2019s -- that\u2019s quite a power --",

        "Q: -- wW-wa --",
        "A: -- what he said?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: No, not terribly, actually. It\u2019s just like haw, all right, you know? I-It -- It was not\nupsetting. Pll tell you an upsetting memory from an adult to a child. Not terribly -- Well,\nfirst of all, when we first moved into 1092 President Street, in this Brooklyn apartment,\nlife was still quite difficult, as it was for -- for a long time, but it -- it kept getting a little\nbetter. My mother earned very little and she -- I mean she -- she was a real Jewish\nmother, you know, everything went to us and the last dregs went to her. And so we le --\nso she went off to work and for the first couple of years, I was supposed to report in to --\nto some neighbor, but there was another neighbor who was sort of a busybody. She\nactually had a kid with Down\u2019s Syndrome, who was kept hidden in a dark room in her\napartment, and -- and one day the older sister actually took us in to see this kid, but I\nmean sh -- but the mother, I don -- I don\u2019t know, the mother just -- you know, she might\nhave been a perfectly pleasant woman, but she -- she did two things in -- in the -- those\nfirst five years we were there, that were really bothersome. Well, first of all, when I\nmoved on this block, the kids were singing this funny ditty that went something like,\n\"Da-da da-da dum, Hitler is a jerk, Mussolini is a meanie and the Japs are worse.\u201d And I\nthought that was like really kind of an awful thing to -- to be singing. But she asked me\none day, \u201cDo you hate the Germans?\u201d And I sa -- I mentioned this on the interview, I -- I\nsaid, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t hate the Germans.\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, then,\u201d -- and I said, you know,\n\u201cSome Germans are good and some Germans are bad.\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t\nyou go back to where you came from then?\u201d And then, in April of 1945, when President\nRoosevelt died, the whole block was, you know, I mean shocked in the way that I, as an\nadult many, many years later, when I was already, you know, a [indecipherable], the\nwhole block was in shock, and people were crying and, you know, but I was a little kid,\nand I knew something unpleasant had happened, but I wasn\u2019t walking around crying or\nanything. I mean, I didn\u2019t -- this -- this figure didn\u2019t really mean a lot to me. And this\nwoman came out and said, \u201cHow come you\u2019re not crying? President Roosevelt just died.\u201d\nAnd I -- I -- I don\u2019t think I even answered, because I didn\u2019t know what she was trying to\ntell me. And she told me again, she said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back to where you came\nfrom?\u201d So, you know, I mean, people were kind of very insensitive. Anyway, I -- you\nknow, I --",
        "Q: Well, let me ask you a little bit about that. I mean, what -- Do you recall your -- your\nfeelings and emotions? Were -- Were you shocked, were you horrified, were you scared?\nDid you think that maybe --",
        "A: You mean by her statement?",
        "Q: By her. I mean, did -- did you feel like maybe more people would be telling you this\nand that -- did you actually fear this, or --",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think I feared it, I just -- I think I just sort of felt that this was a really\nunpleasant lady, or maybe I didn\u2019t even feel that, maybe I just felt this was a really\nunpleasant thing for her to say.",
        "Q: Did you have any -- make any attempt to tell her how impossible that would be?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think I said anything, as a matter of fact, because from my perspective,\nthere was no answer. I mean, you know, what am I supposed to do, turn on the tears or --\nyou know, I -- I -- I think what she said to me just didn\u2019t make any sense.",

        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Pre -- Pre that, obviously.",
        "A: Yeah, and th -- I -- There were a lot of funny things that happened to me there. I don\u2019t\n-- | think -- I don\u2019t -- See, I don\u2019t remember exactly h-how old I was at each of these\nthings, but I sort of made little friendships with people, and there was a little girl called\nJoanie Cummings, who lived in the next house, and her mother was divorced, which was\npretty unusual at that ti -- there were a few divorced people on the block, actually, but it\nwas still kind of unusual and I remember f -- we would talk a lot, I mean she w -- she\ncame from -- I mean, I came from a family that really treasured, or -- or was intent on\neducation, and she came from the exact opposite. You know, her mother worked, I don\u2019t\nknow where. She had an older sister who went out with boys and -- and you know, kind\nof -- I don\u2019t know, did frivolous things, and this kid, Joanie Cummings, she was amazing.\nShe played hooky from school more days than anybody I had ever met and she always --\nshe would say, \u201cWell, I can\u2019t go to school today, because it\u2019s an Irish holiday and my\ngreat-aunt on my mother\u2019s fifth side is Irish, so 1n respect to her, I can\u2019t go to school\ntoday.\u201d And for every day she had some -- some ridiculous story. But she was kind of --\nshe was nice and -- and pleasant and it was very informal, they had some kitten in the\nhouse, the house always smelled absolutely awful. But she -- she told me one day, \u201cI\nthink I\u2019m going to go play with this other girl,\u201d and I can almost remember her name, but\nshe lived about a block away, she was blonde and they were both Protestant, and she said,\n\u2018\u201c\u2018We have more to -- in common, because we\u2019re both Protestant.\u201d And -- And I remember\nsort of feeling a little hurt, because we had spent so much time together. And then sort of\nshrugging my shoulders and thinking, \u201cWell, you know, I don\u2019t know.\u201d She was also --\nIn our house, I don\u2019t know, I think 1t was my brother -- maybe also my mother, but things\nwere sort of a little more formal. For example, when my brother was young, when he\ncame home, and if he didn\u2019t use his key and he rang the bell, and I answered the door, he\nwould -- he would do this kind of a European bow to me at the door, you know, of -- not\na bow, I don\u2019t know what you call it, you know, just sort of courtesy bending at the waist\nand -- and he did that to my mother and -- and his -- I mean, his European male friends,\nwhen they visited each other, they -- they -- you know, it -- that was kind of formal and\nyou came and you didn\u2019t sit down unle -- until somebody said, \u201cWould you please sit\ndown?\u201d You know, and so on. And I remember Joanie Cummings one day saying to me,\n\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t know, when you -- when I come to your house, everything is so\nformal,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen somebody comes to my house, I tell them to pull up a comfy\nand squat.\u201d And I\u2019ve never forgotten that phrase, because I thought, \u201cOh, y-yeah, you\nknow, what\u2019s -- what\u2019s different about -- about us?\u201d And then the other thing that I -- that\nI remember from those days is, my brother had taken English lessons in Vienna, and -- so\nhe kind of had a head start, but he learned English, you know, fluently, quite quickly after\nwe got here. And -- And he spoke quite correctly and I -- I never realized it til not too\nlong ago, that he even had an accent, it\u2019s a very slight accent, I think, but-- but when I\nknocked on the door, and he -- you know, in New York, everybody that we knew said,\n\u2018\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d I think maybe I still do that. Do I still do that? No, cause we have\npeepholes, but I still, s-sometimes maybe I do that, and I had learned from the other kids\nto say, \u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d cause that\u2019s what all the other kids said. My brother wouldn\u2019t let me in\nif I said, \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d I had to say, \u201cIt is I,\u201d which is correct English grammar. And then --\nSo I learned to say, \u201cIt 1s I,\u201d but then I discovered that when I went to a friend\u2019s house\nand I said, \u201cIt is I,\u201d they looked at me in a really funny way, and so I learned to become\nbilingual.",
        "Q: Bilingual in English.",
        "A: Yes, bilingual in English, and so when my brother was on the other side of the door,\nor some educated adult, I would say, \u201cIt is I,\u201d but when I was with my little friends, I\nlearned to say, \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d And the funny thing was, and -- and I should have remembered\nthat, and I -- I didn\u2019t recognize it, and I still find it a little difficult, but our daughter, who\nis now a graduate student in anthropology, somewhere along the way, learned to speak\nthis English that I found it difficult to listen to. Like, Meg and me are going to the\nmovies. But even as a very little kid, sh -- and also sh -- she learned it from her little\nfriends, to use a lot of bad language. But, at a -- it -- this 1s interesting in terms of kids, at\na very, very early age, just when she was getting into that stage, when my brother came to\nvisit, she never said things like, Meg and me, and she never used any swear words. And\nso somehow, even though nothing was said, that I can recall, she picked up on this and\nnow -- I mean, she writes very well, and she\u2019s very well spoken, and she is now 29 years\nold and she speaks very well, and if she were talking to you, she would never say, \u201cMeg\nand me are going to the movies.\u201d But when she\u2019s with her friends, who are all now pretty\nwell-educated people, she still says, \u201cMeg and me are going to the movies.\u201d But in\nconversation with anybody else, she would never use that. So that\u2019s --",
        "Q: Well -- Well, you know, I was wondering, those -- those couple of examples that --\nfrom -- from when you were a kid, I mean, about difference, whether it\u2019s language, or --\nor these -- this girl saying, you know, that we\u2019re Protestant. I mean, they\u2019re both\nexamples of difference, and one might be more, sort of steeped in -- in the difference of a\nEuropean background, and one steeped in a religious difference of being Jewish -- being\nJewish, so I\u2019m just wondering how much you -- I mean it -- living in New York, probably\nyou'd perceive it less than in other places. Did you -- Did you have a sense of -- of a\nclimate of anti-Semitism at all, or -- or were --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- these were just --",
        "A: | -- I -- I must say that per -- in my own personal life, since coming to the U.S., I have\nnever personally experienced any anti-Semitism that I can remember. When I got to\nBerkeley and went out hunting for an apartment, that was 1956 -- I used to get quite\nbrown in the summer, and I -- when I went looking for an apartment, I went with a\nwoman from New Zealand and a Chinese woman, we wanted to share an apartment, and I\nfound out afterwards, that we didn\u2019t get this apartment and we happened to know\nsomebody who lived in the building, and that person came and told us that the landlady\nsaid she didn\u2019t mind the English girl, but she didn\u2019t want the Indian or the Chinese. The\nIndian was me. So -- And -- And I -- When I lived in New York, I often -- you know, in\nlater years, when more and more Hispanics moved in, I often was mistaken for being\nHispanic, so I mean, I just, you know, I -- I -- I have not personally experienced any anti-\nSemitism, but -- but other prejudices, I mean, for example, on my block, my brother and I\n-- and there was one other -- there was one other kid that I played with who did later go to\ncollege and become a teacher, but my brother and I and one other boy were the only three\npeople who went to graduate school, and so there definitely was -- well, my mother also -\n- my mother, I think, in a funny way en -- I hate to say encouraged this, cause I don\u2019t\nthink she encouraged it, she just -- I think my mother was very proud or something about\n-- about being from a, you know, quotes, good family and -- and you know, being for that\ntime, educated. I mean, my mother -- my mother finished gimnasium, which was unusual\nin her generation for a female, and that\u2019s kind of the equivalent of finishing junior\ncollege, I guess, in the U.S. She was very proud of that and -- that she could always read\nand that she read good books and that she listened to music and -- and so on and so forth.\nSo there certainly -- I mean, I certainly grew up with an air of her having a sense that we\nwere -- I hate to use the word better, but that -- but that there was something special about\nus, compared to oth -- the -- everybody else on the --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nLiane Reif-Lehrer. This 1s tape number two, side A. Okay.",
        "A: My brother also -- I mean, my brother was -- was very, very interested in education\nand -- and things of the head. And so -- I mean, he taught me a lot of things and he also --\nhe would, you know, he would test me, but not in -- in an unpleasant way, it was -- it was\nkind of more of a game, you know. Music would -- We always listened to WQXR in\nNew York, which was the classical music station, and, you know, \u201cWho wrote that?\u201d\nYou know, and reading -- about reading good books, and he did not allow me -- this --\nmy -- my one really bad thing that I did in the growing up years, my brother did not\nallow me to read comic books. And the only re -- the only bad thing I ever did is, I had\nsix Classic comics hidden under my bed at one point.",
        "Q: That you insisted on being a real girl?",
        "A: I wa -- that was --",
        "Q: You know, a normal girl, you know?",
        "A: -- that was my one rebellious thing, right. And to this day, you know, I can\u2019t really\nread comics. I find them just really annoying. But --",
        "Q: Wa -- So -- So he was really demanding excellence of you, it sounds like. He -- He\nwanted to -- He wanted you to be better and better, an-and achieve, it sounds as though\nthat\u2019s his motivation.",
        "A: He -- He -- He did, and he also, I mean, I think I owe, in many ways, where I am\neducationally or professionally or whatever, to him. First of all, there was -- there was -- I\ndon\u2019t ever remember having to make decisions, like decisions that I\u2019ve seen my children\nand other kids make about, you know, am I going to college, which college? What am I\ngoing to do afterwards, etcetera. And I -- I certainly had to decide on which college, but\nthere -- I don\u2019t remember ever questioning that I would go to graduate school. I mean, it\nwas never discussed, it was just somehow there. And my brother, I mean actually, in this\nfamily, even -- even my husband, we -- we have a -- a -- an incredible surfeit of teaching\ngenes. I mean, we are -- there is just the desire to always be teaching. I mean my -- my\nhusband\u2019s always teaching, my brother\u2019s always teaching, I\u2019m always teaching. And I\nremember, you know, when I started taking chemistry, I remember my brother coming\nhome and teaching me, you know, how do you do -- how do you make a diagram of\nwater in a beaker? And I -- I -- I even remember that he had a blue -- a -- a sort of aqua\nblue pencil that he was drawing these lines in with. You know, how do you -- you know,\nwhat\u2019s a triangle, how do you bisect an angle? Learning the multiplication tables, I mean\nf -- oh, I know, then -- okay, then my brother went off -- my brother went to -- started at\nCity College. Then he got -- oh here\u2019s an interesting story, he got a Pulitzer scholarship.\nDidn\u2019t tell my mother about it, didn\u2019t tell me about it, either. My mother read about it in\nthe newspaper.",
        "Q: Why? Why wouldn\u2019t he say?",
        "A: Because he was a very private person, and he still is. He does not -- He doesn\u2019t -- I\nmean, like if I got a Pulitzer scholarship, I would probably be out telling all my friends.\nYou know, I wouldn\u2019t advertise it in the newspaper, but I would tell all my friends. My --\nFirst of all, my brother doesn\u2019t talk about things until they have happened, because, as he\nsays, they may not happen. And then, he does not advertise. So -- So anyway, so then he\ngot this Pulitzer scholarship, and so he transferred to Columbia University. And after one\nyear is when he got drafted. So he got drafted into the army, and he went to -- I don\u2019t\nknow, Fort something or other, in Florida. My brother is probably the most un-athletic\nperson I have ever met. So he had to got to basic training, and he was miserable and he\nfainted out in the sun, and you know, and then he tells this funny story about the day they\nwere supposed to have grenade training, he ended up in the infirmary with a -- a fever\nand didn\u2019t get out until after grenade training was over, or something. Okay, so he got\nfinished with basic training, they sent him to Yale to study Japanese. So, he was at Yale\nUniversity for nine months, learning Japanese, which was totally useless, but he liked that\nbetter than having to do some other thing, that didn\u2019t involve his brain. And then he got\nsent -- he was going to get sent overseas and he got shipped out to Seattle and then the\nwar ended. And -- But he had only been in the army now for, I don\u2019t know, a little over a\nyear and he was supposed to be in for 18 months at least, or -- I -- you know, I don\u2019t\nknow what the rules were, but -- so he was -- I think he was private first class or\nsomething. He got shipped to Texas, and they put him into MP school, military police\nschool. Well, that was definitely not my brother\u2019s cup of tea, but I remember when he\ncame home, I was on the floor constantly, cause he -- he had learned all these maneuvers\nabout how to throw people over his shoulder, and so on, and he practiced them on me.\nOkay, so that -- So that was the end of that. Then he went back to Columbia for one year,\nand managed to somehow make up classes and he -- he really was a self studier and so --\nI mean, he tells funny stories. ve interviewed him, you know, like you\u2019re interviewing\nme, and he -- he tells the story about, you know, he had to take this course, and he really\ndidn\u2019t want to take the course and a friend of his said, \u201cOh, you don\u2019t have to take this\ncourse, just go and read this book and pass the exam.\u201d So he did and he passed it, and --\nand he -- he was very bright and -- okay, so then he got out of Columbia and then he left\nto go to Harvard, as a graduate student in physics. So -- I was going to tell you a story\nand now it\u2019s eluded me.",
        "Q: Well we can -- We can get back to it if you want.",
        "A: Okay, all right.",
        "Q: I -- I -- Ba -- Wa -- Once you\u2019re not trying to remember it, maybe it\u2019Il pop -- it\u2019Il be --\npop in.",

        "Q: His --",
        "A: His --",
        "Q: I think we were talking about his seriousness.",
        "A: Yes, and something that he -- oh, oh, okay, all right, so he went up to Harvard and I\nwas here, and I -- I guess by that time I was starting high school, and -- and two funny\nthings happened. One is, I got this teacher at one point, this math teacher who had a\nterrible reputation for being really mean, and -- and I was always the teacher\u2019s pet and\neverybody -- all the teachers were always nice to me, cause I always did my homework\nand I studied and I always did the right thing, and -- you know, and there was a teacher\neven, Miss Massamine, I had, I think, in seventh grade or something, and she was really\nkind of a disgusting character. She always wore black dresses and if you were really\ngood, you got to dust the dandruff off her shoulders. And that -- that totally, you know --\nbut anyway -- but I -- but I --",
        "Q: What an incredible privilege that wa --",
        "A: -- was going --",
        "Q: -- must have been.",
        "A: I know. But anyway, so -- so Miss Carter was going to be the teacher for algebra or\nsomething, and everybody told me Miss Carter was really mean, and I -- so I was\npanicked, I wrote to my brother and I said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been put into this class with\nthis mean teacher.\u201d Got this letter back from my brother, said, \u201cI had Miss Carter,\u201d sh --\nhe said, \u201cdo your work and mind your own business, she\u2019s fine.\u201d And -- So that\u2019s what\nhappened, I did my homework and minded my own business and she was fine. I mean\nshe was -- she was really kind of an ogre, but she never did anything bad to me. But I\nused to sit there, I mean, when she yelled at other kids, I\u2019d be, you know, I mean I -- that\nwas really -- okay, then I started also taking French in high school, and the first French\nquiz, I got a 98. So I was pretty pleased with myself, cause the other kids, you know, I\nmean, by and large, the kids in that s-school -- I mean, there were some very bright kids,\nbut most of them were, you know, they didn\u2019t really care. So I wrote to my brother with\ngreat pride, I got a 98 on my first French quiz. I get a very stern letter back from my\nbrother. \u201cYou obviously didn\u2019t study. Language is an exact science, and if you had\nstudied, you obviously would have gotten a hundred.\u201d So I went back to the drawing\nboards and I studied, and the next quiz I got a hundred. So -- But, so he was very -- he\nwas very stern, in that sense, but he was also -- but he was also very nice and he was a lot\nof fun. You know, we used to play games together and -- I mean, when he was still home\nand we were younger, we used to have -- we used to duel with rolled up New York Times\nmagazines and there was something funny that happened in the house, an-and the stupid\nthing was, it never occurred to me to protest, but we had an apartment that had two\nbedrooms, a living room and a kitchen. My brother got his own bedroom, I slept in the\nmaster bedroom with my mother, in what used to be my father\u2019s bed, and I studied in the\nkitchen, or some -- later on -- in later years, in the living room. When my brother left for\nHarvard, his room remained and now, as I think back on it, it sort of was like a shrine or\nsomething. I mean, I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t go in there, I didn\u2019t do my homework in there, I\ndidn\u2019t -- you know, I --",
        "Q: Why do you think that was?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but in recent years I\u2019ve written to my brother and I\u2019ve said, \u201cYou know,\nwhy didn\u2019t I use your room? Why didn\u2019t I move into your room?\u201d And my brother says,\n\u201cT don\u2019t know. Why didn\u2019t you just do it?\u201d You know, he\u2019s -- it had nothing to do with\nhim, maybe it was something to do with my mother, but that room was kept empty for\nthe, you know, one week at holidays when he would come home.",
        "Q: I\u2019ve decide -- I don\u2019t want to overanalyze or over-pursue this point, but I -- I\u2019m just\nthinking, how much of the presence of your father was he -- do you think he was\nrepresenting, especially in that sort of shrine that you\u2019re describing?",
        "A: You know, people ask -- I don\u2019t think, I don\u2019t think -- I mean, my br -- my father had\nhis own shrine, there was a photograph of my father on my mother\u2019s night-table and that\nwas like the shrine, and -- and the shrine was in my mother\u2019s head, but it was not in my\nbrother\u2019s room. I mean, I don\u2019t know what it was, but I mean, in -- you know, it -- and it\nnever occurred to me for all these years, until about -- 1t must have been about five or\nseven years ago, that I suddenly thought, \u201c\u201cWhy didn\u2019t somebody suggest that I take over\nmy brother\u2019s room when he left for college?\u201d And I, you know, I don\u2019t know the answer,\nbut --",
        "Q: Well let me ask -- let me -- maybe we could just pick up on -- on what -- I just am\ncurious that -- you talked about there was a shrine, your mother had a shrine for your\nfather and wh-wh-what -- what presence of your father did you feel? I mean, did you feel\na -- a terrible -- something that was terribly missing, did you -- were you conscious of it?\nDid you feel like, oh, I don\u2019t have a father, when you were growing up? Or -- How did\nyou feel about that?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t remember -- I mean, I remember staring at my father\u2019s picture, but I\ndon\u2019t remember, through all those growing up years, really thinking very much about it.\nIt was only very much later that I became curious in a number of things. One was, did my\nfather really commit suicide? Everybody sort of assumed that, but maybe that\u2019s not what\nhappened. And my brother says, \u201cWell, it probably did happen,\u201d but -- but anyway, but I\nstill have that question in my mind.",
        "Q: Like somebody might have thrown him over the stairwell?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Given the climate of --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- of the time?",
        "A: Exactly, but --",
        "Q: I mean, that was how long after -- it was --",
        "A: It was actually before Kristallnacht --",
        "Q: -- 1t was just before Kristallnacht, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: -- right, but it was after the August when he was forced to s -- close his practice.",
        "Q: It was after the anschluss.",
        "A: It was after the anschluss.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The other thing is I -- I\u2019ve -- I just, not too many years ago, said to my brother, \u201cIf my\nfather loved me as much as they say he did, why didn\u2019t he leave me a note if he was\ngoing to commit suicide? Why didn\u2019t he sort of introduce himself and explain why he\nwas doing this?\u201d And my brother pointed out, quite correctly, that when people are very\ndepressed, and they\u2019re about to commit suicide, they don\u2019t necessarily act in a rational\nway.",
        "Q: Yeah. But that -- Does that -- Is it a -- Is it a -- Is 1t a -- What kind of mystery is that\nfor you, does it -- does it dig at you, or is it a -- sort of a curiosity? I mean, how much do\nyou -- how deeply, I guess I\u2019m asking, do you wish to be able to somehow find the\nanswer to that?",
        "A: Subconsciously, I can\u2019t answer. Consciously, not terribly, but it -- I think maybe it\u2019s\ngetting ever so slightly more as I get older. For example, my cousin, this woman Hilda\nTowderer, wrote a letter to me a week ago, and at the end of the letter, she wrote a couple\nof things about, \u201cI remember you as a little girl at our house,\u201d and so on, and I thought,\n\u201cOh, why haven\u2019t I ever tapped her for information before?\u201d So when I answered that\nletter a couple of days ago, you know, I wrote like 10 questions at the end, about, you\nknow, what was my father like, what was the relationship between my father and my\nmother, etcetera, etcetera. I mean, I just -- you know, I was at the compu -- I mean, you\nhave to understand that I live my life, really very much in the present, and I\u2019m always in\na hurry, because I\u2019m trying to do more things, always, than there is time to do. And now,\nfor the first time in my adult life, because our son has been ill since the end of October, I\nhaven\u2019t worked full time. I mean, I\u2019m trying to work, take care of him. You know, my\nhusband and I are taking turns doing this. You know, we travel -- he doesn\u2019t travel a lot,\nbut he travels, and -- and I travel a fair amount, and so we live a life which is generally\nvery hectic, I think. But not hectic the way -- I mean, I have a lot of -- I spent most of my\ncareer as a faculty member at Boston Biomedical and then The Eye Research Institute,\nand always with an appointment at Harvard Medical School, and so I don\u2019t -- I\u2019m not like\nyour average Harvard tenured professor, whose life is very limited to getting ahead,\ndoing [indecipherable], you know, [indecipherable] you know, and not -- not doing\nanything else. My husband and I try to do all those things, but we also both have a lot of a\n-- outside interests. For example, we like to ballroom dance. My husband used to like to\ndo photography, he does very little of that now, but -- but we have other things that we\u2019re\ninterested in doing. So, I\u2019m -- We\u2019re -- We are not ever hectic to the point of excluding\nthose things. In fact, I mean I wouldn\u2019t tell my colleagues this, but I usually call at the\nbeginning of the season, when the ballroom dance schedule comes out and I put that on\nmy calendar first. And then if somebody calls and says, you know, \u201cCan you come to\nChicago and do a workshop?\u201d I say, \u201cWell, no, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m -- I\u2019ve already got a date\nthat day,\u201d you know.",
        "Q: Well that\u2019s priorities. I mean, you --",
        "A: So --",
        "Q: -- you make decisions of -- like that as --",
        "A: Right, and I --",
        "Q: Most people don\u2019t do that these days.",
        "A: -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know why, but I have a -- I think since my son got sick, and -- we\nhave not gone to any of the really big dances this year, since he got sick, but --",
        "Q: Bless you.",
        "A: And now -- thanks -- now I find that -- I mean, since he got sick, my priorities have\nchanged again, because now, if I miss a dance, 1t doesn\u2019t even, you know, it doesn\u2019t -- but\na year ago, I mean, I would like, bend over backwards not to miss a dance. Why am I so\npassionate about ballroom dancing? I don\u2019t know. I mean I -- that\u2019s -- you know, I mean\npeople ask me and I jokingly say, \u201cWell, it\u2019s my Viennese blood.\u201d Well, that\u2019s a lot of\nbullshit. I -- You me -- I mean, I don\u2019t really have any Viennese blood. My parents were\nborn in Poland, they moved to Vienna. Why do I have that? I don\u2019t know. I think my\nparents did dance. Oh, and then, you know, the other thing 1s, when we came here, the\nonly thing I had, which I still have, is a wind-up phonograph, that my parents had. And\nwe brought, from Vienna, I don\u2019t know, maybe two dozen 78 rpm records, mostly\npopular songs of the day. So, my brother said I couldn\u2019t listen to any of this music, and\nthe only -- there were only two or three records he let me listen to, they were Strauss\nwaltzes, because -- not that my brother is enamored of Strauss waltzes, but that was the\nclosest thing to classical music that was in that collection. So, I remember when I was a\nkid, when I was alone, and after I\u2019d finished my homework -- I mean, I did go out to play\nwith the kids, but I really also spent a fair amount of time by myself. I\u2019d put this\nphonograph on and I would either -- we had a carpet in the living room, an oriental carpet\nthat had sort of a design, you know, with a -- with a sort of pattern around the edge and I\nwould march in time to the music around this thing. Sometimes my brother would -- my\nbrother doesn\u2019t dance, but he would -- he would do a gavotte with me. A gavotte, which\nis a -- sort of a 1600\u2019s dance. And --",
        "Q: A little more like a march, sort of, or --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: A very formal court dance --",
        "Q: Ah, uh-huh.",
        "A: -- sort of thing, and -- and then I started taking Arthur Murray footprint books out of\nthe library. Oh, you know, another thing that happened -- see, I spent a lot of time with\nmy brother when he was still home, and we lived about a 15 minute very fast walk from\nthe Grand Army Plaza Library in Brooklyn, which was a wonderful library. And my\nbrother spent a lot of time in the library, and he would take me along, but officially, I was\nstill too young to go into the adult section. I don\u2019t think libraries do this any more, but --\nbut in those days there was a children\u2019s library and you couldn\u2019t go into the adult section\nunless you were a certain age. So, first of all, my brother walked very, very fast, and so,\nwhen I started walking with him, I\u2019d kind of be dragging, you know, down the street. But\nso, what do you do? I learned how to walk. I am probably the fastest walker of anybody\nthat I know, even now. I mean, I can out-walk practically anybody. And so I learned to\nwalk very fast, and -- and then later in life it kind of turned around, I mean, my brother\nhas some foot problems an-and other, you know, things, so he -- he no longer walks fast\nand so -- so now, you know, everybody else in the family usually says, \u201cCould you please\nslow down?\u201d But -- But so we would walk to the library very often and because I was\nwith him, he could take me into the adult section. But he didn\u2019t really want to be bothered\nwith me once we got into the adult section, so he would drop me at the first set of\nbookshelves in the adult section, which happened to be psychology. And so I would sit\non the floor for hours, while he was doing his thing, and I would rummage through the\npsychology books. And usually, what was on the bottom shelf was about optical illusions,\nso I learned a lot about optical illusions. So -- So a lot of me was formed by -- not\nintentionally, ba -- by my brother, but just because I was around him and -- you know,\nand then, I mean, if his friends came and they were going to the Museum of Modern Art,\nI mean the first time I ever went to the Museum of Modern Art was because my brother\nwas going with a friend and he took me along.",
        "Q: Did -- I\u2019m just curious, th-the optical illusions that you learned about, did that -- do\nyou see any connection tha -- between that and your later professional development, or\njust --",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so, no.",
        "Q: No. So --",
        "A: Well, except -- except that I can never decide, did I get interested in science because\nscience was interesting, or because my brother made science interesting, or because my\nbrother got me interested in science, or another -- I mean, the reality is that I was able to\nget a fellowship to graduate school, which covered all my expenses, living and school\nand everything, because in those years, a lot of money was being poured into science. I\nmean, it is now, but it -- but it was much more so then. Did my brother go into science\nbecause he knew that that was a good way to get out of the ghet-ghetto in which we lived,\nin Brooklyn, and I just followed? Or was there some other, deeper, more meaningful\nthings that were going on, or was it just because my brother taught me a lot of science\nand science was fun and I seemed to be good at it and you know, there\u2019s nothing that\nsucceeds like success? I mean, who knows? I\u2019ve had a lot of discussions in recent year --\nwell, not a lot, but \u2019ve had discussions in recent years with my brother about something\nthat I find extremely disturbing and very horrifying. And that is that when I sit down and\nanalyze what happened to me in my life and what happened to my brother, although he\u2019s\nhad a much more difficult life, that our lives were probably better in the long run, and\nmore exciting, and more fulfilling because of those things that happened, than they would\nhave been if nothing -- if there had been no war and we stayed in Vienna. That\u2019s kind of a\nhorrible thought, that -- that our lives were enhanced at the cost of so much tragedy, to\nsuch an enormous number of people. That\u2019s a -- That\u2019s a very difficult thought to live\nwith.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a profound kind of realization, I suppose. It -- Did it sort of just dawn on you at\none point, or --",
        "A: You know, until 1974-ish, I really did not think about any of the past. When people\ntried to talk to me about it, I just said, \u201cOh, I was too young, that had no effect on me.\u201d I\nwas intr -- I had blinders on, I just wanted to get on with my career, I wanted to do my\nthing, I wanted to get out of that place in Brooklyn. I wanted to get away from those\npeople that I grew up with. I wanted to get to a better place. When I got to Barnard\nCollege, that\u2019s another interesting story, how did I manage to get to Barnard College, but\nwhen I got to Barnard College, I remember feeling sad. I -- I felt sad that, why couldn\u2019t I\nha -- you know, there were these all -- I mean, this was by no means the rule in those\ndays, because by and large, women didn\u2019t do much in those days, but I met a lot of\nwomen at -- the first year at Barnard whose parents were lawyers and whose mothers\nwere lawyers or doctors and you know. I mean, overall, I think most of the mothers were\nhousewives, but -- but my head focused in on why couldn\u2019t I have a mother who was a\ndoctor or a lawyer, and I -- that really bothered me, that my mother had not chosen to do\nsomething important. Now, my brother was very partial to my father, and he tells me it\u2019s\nbecause, you know, my father was doing important, good things, my mother was\nfrivolous. She was interested in fashion and you know. And somehow, in recent years,\nI\u2019ve tried to tell him, \u201cBut look at -- look at how she came through when the chips were\ndown.\u201d",
        "Q: That\u2019s -- It -- You could see her as a heroic figure in -- in keeping the family together.",
        "A: Yes, well I didn\u2019t when she was still around, but I do now. But I think -- I think my\nbrother appreciates everything she gave up and everything that she did, but he certainly\ndoes not see her as a heroic figure. He sees her as somebody who was pulled into being\nheroic by circumstances, but who, having -- if she had been left to her own devices,\nwould have been, you know, dressing up and putting on make-up and -- and having\ncoffee klatches and so on.",
        "Q: But -- But what -- what does -- I mean -- here -- I mean 1f -- if -- if -- if you\u2019re -- think\nabout heroism, I mean, what -- doesn\u2019t what count -- wha -- 1s -- is wh -- when -- when it\nreally comes down to how you respond, in a sense, right?",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: I mean, she sounds like she really responded.",
        "A: Yes, and I think he really appreciated that, but I don\u2019t think he really respected the\ninner person that she was or would have been if this event hadn\u2019t happened. He really\nrespected my father. My father, he says, did good things for people. He was thoughtful,\nhe was, you know, he -- he educated himself. So h-he -- you know, it\u2019s funny, my brother\ngot himself so educated and was never interested in small talk or anything like that. So\nanother thing that happened between him and my mother was that it got to a point fairly\nearly, when they really almost couldn\u2019t talk to each other, because my brother didn\u2019t\nknow small talk and my mother couldn\u2019t talk physics or philosophy, or you know,\nwhatever. And he was -- he was nice to her, I mean, he wasn\u2019t mean or anything like that,\nbut he just really didn\u2019t have anything in common with her. I-It was -- It\u2019s funny, it\u2019s\nkind of a scary thing, I mean, 1-if you\u2019re a parent, you know, who are your children, I\nmean, and what do they turn out to be and is there any rule that says they have to be like\nyou, or that -- you know. And it always hurts me when I hear these stories, but for\nexample, my -- my Ph.D. thesis advisor has one son and he -- the last time I saw him,\nwhich was, I don\u2019t know, maybe seven or eight years ago, he said, \u201cWell, I see my son\nonce a year. We go fishing together, alone, for a week.\u201d He said, \u201cI don\u2019t like the woman\nmy son married. We have nothing in common, we don\u2019t have a lot to, you know, to do\nwith each other. We enjoy our annual fishing trip, and that\u2019s it.\u201d Well, to me that\u2019s very\nsad, and I mean, my husband and I are very involved with both our kids, I mean, maybe\ntoo much involved, but I like to think that we are also not just parents -- I mean, that we\nare also, I don\u2019t know, friends or something, I don\u2019t know. But -- But I mean, I think\nwe've also really worked at that and I think maybe, you know, why did I work at that so\nhard? And I think that was conversations my brother and I had early, about parenting. I\nmean, I remember one day having a conversation with my brother bef -- I think 1t was\nbefore he went off to college, about -- and my brother said to me, \u201cA child is like a ship.\nWhen you finish building it --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning of Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nLiane Reif-Lehrer. This is tape number two, side B. And you were saying?",
        "A: My brother said that a child should be like a ship, and that when you finish building\nthe ship, and you crack the champagne bottle over the bow, or whatever, and you send it\nout to sea, that you have to be confident that you\u2019ve done a good job building the ship,\nand that it will not sink, that it will sail under it\u2019s own steam, and that you then can\u2019t\ncontinually watch out for it and you know, sort of be trying to tell it where to go and what\nto do.",
        "Q: He said this wa -- before he was a parent? When he was in --",
        "A: He\u2019s not a parent, he\u2019s never been a parent.",
        "Q: He\u2019s never been a parent?",
        "A: And he said that to me, I think it was when he was still in college, because he was still\nhome. And I always remembered that. So, very early on -- first of all, I wasn\u2019t going to\nhave any kids either. That -- What I -- I was definitely not going to have any kids.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Well, actually, when I grew up with my brother, I mean, I sort of grew up with the\nidea that we were never going to get married, we were just going to be these dedicated\nscientists and we were not going to have a marriage, or children, we would just be these\ncareer folks. At some point my brother met a young woman and they ended up getting\nmarried, and that was a very , very, very difficult time in my life, because I felt -- I felt as\nthough I had been deceived somehow. I just -- See, I think one of the things that\nhappened, is when my brother was home, we were pretty close and we -- we talked a lot,\nbut the one thing I didn\u2019t realize until way later, is that I talked a lot more than he talked.\nAnd I didn\u2019t realize how private a person he was, and so, as he went through his traumas\nin life, like the army, and you know, all the things that happen as you\u2019re a young person\ngrowing up, he didn\u2019t share those things with me. He taught me a lot of stuff and so on,\nbut he didn\u2019t -- he didn\u2019t take the opportunity to teach me about what I call the sort of,\nreal life skills. And so, I think -- I think when he was going to get married, I mean that\njust ki -- was like something totally out of the blue, and I -- I think I -- I remember\nwriting that this -- I remember writing very dramatic things at that point. I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe Ill find them someday if we ever clean out the house, but I remember feeling that\nthis was like the fall of -- I remember writing something about that I felt like, \u201cThe Fall\nof the House of Usher,\u201d that I guess I\u2019d been reading Poe at the time, but -- and I had\nreally morbid thought about, you know, that -- that my brother was sort of deserting the\nplan, or -- I mean, I -- you know, I -- I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: And deserting you probably, too.",
        "A: Maybe deserting me, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: I mean, I wonder if -- if -- 1f just -- I mean, this -- this experience that you shared, this\n-- this -- this leaving Vienna, and this -- this fleeing for your lives. I mean, maybe -- I\u2019m\njust wondering if maybe part of it was that he was the only person out there who really\nknew, like you did, what you had gone through. And who knew even more, because he\u2019s\nolder. And that there was something -- that maybe you felt abandoned for that.",
        "A: Yeah. I mean, I really shouldn\u2019t have, it\u2019s just that he didn\u2019t make me sufficiently\naware of his inner life and -- or I don\u2019t know, maybe it was more than just his inner life,\nbut for example, he had a -- he had a very interesting thing happen, which I only barely\nmentioned in the in -- in the video interview. When we got to France, and I can\u2019t\nremember which town, I think -- I don\u2019t remember which town it was, but anyway, he\nmet this -- this young man, who was probably 20-something, who was a pianist, a\nprofessional p-pianist, from Poland. Also Jewish and apparently did not make it through\nthe war. This guy had a room somewhere and so okay, it must have been in Limoge. He\ninvited my brother to come and stay with him for, I guess a month or so. And so this guy\nwas 21, which in those days was quite an adult age. You know, 21 now is not as adult as I\nthink 21 then. So this guy had fled Poland and was totally on his own, and so he kind of\nknew a little bit about the ropes, cause he had already been there, I don\u2019t know for, you\nknow, weeks or months, whatever it was. And so he took my brother under his wing, and\nhe said, \u201cOkay, so, you know, what would you like to do?\u201d And my brother said, \u201cWell,\nI'd like to go to school.\u201d And so he said, \u201cWell, you know, there\u2019s a school on such and\nsuch a street, why don\u2019t you go down there and register?\u201d And so my brother went down\nthere and -- and he -- he -- when I was interviewing him in recent years, he said, \u201cI was\nthe only kid in the school who was not being registered by parents. I was the only one\nwho was on my own,\u201d and -- and he said, \u201cso I got into this class, with this nice guy, who\nhappened to be the headmaster,\u201d Monsieur Nabout was his name, N-a-b-o-u-t. And in\nthat class, kids got seated according to their grades. So my brother started in the last seat.\nAnd apparently, within like two or three months, my brother was sitting in the first seat,\nand -- and Monsieur Nabout also took my brother under his wing and sort of, you know,\nkept him after school, and helped him with his French, and his this and that and so on. So\nthat was a really positive thing, and then this guy one day said, \u201cWell, so, you know,\nwhat else would you like to do?\u201d And my brother said, \u201cWell, I play the violin, and I\nhave my violin and -- and I -- I\u2019d like to take some lessons.\u201d And so, he said, \u201cWell, you\nknow, on such and such a street, there\u2019s this music conservatory,\u201d you know, \u201cget\nyourself over there.\u201d And -- And somehow my brother went there and I guess he got\nlessons and they must have given him lessons free, or I -- I don\u2019t know how, but anyway\nhe, you know. So, this guy, I think was very formative in helping my brother grow up. I\nmean, my brother had already grown up very quickly, cause he had to do -- he spoke a\nlittle French. My mother knew no French and I knew no French. So he was -- I mean,\nonce we got to France, he was in charge of all the official things that had to be done. So\nthat was a really fast growing up. But in addition, there was this other stuff growing up,\nand that stuff I didn\u2019t see, and I don\u2019t think my brother really -- I mean, why would he\ncome home and tell this little seven and a half year old younger sister about this stuff that\nwas going on? So I -- I wasn\u2019t aware of -- of all that other stuff that went on. And then, of\ncourse, in -- when we got here, and when my brother was at Columbia, he got some\nfriends, and I -- I remember like one night, my brother took me with him to the -- I mean,\nthis 1s -- my brother almost never did this, but he went to this friend\u2019s house, and there\nwere a lot of other young men there, and here\u2019s this little sister. And they were playing\ncards, which I don\u2019t think my brother did very often, and certainly I\u2019m sure he never did\nit as a -- you know, as a real adult. But I just sat in the back of this guy\u2019s apartment with a\n-- | think my brother bro-brought a book for me, or something, and I just sat there\nreading. But I wasn\u2019t just reading, I was looking up at all these big guys, you know, and\nthey were joking and playing cards and -- and the thing that my brother did, which I\nalways felt -- I mean, it was -- it was very difficult being alone in that, you know, this\nlittle girl sitting there, you know, no friends, just watching these big guys having a good\ntime. But in a funny way, I didn\u2019t really ever feel lonely, because you know, I\u2019d kind of\nsneak glances up at the boys and sort of every fifth glance or 10\" glance, whatever it was,\nmy brother would look up and wink at me with this wonderful smile. So that I always had\na feeling that I wasn\u2019t really alone, you know, and that he -- he hadn\u2019t just forgotten\nabout me. So, and -- and then -- I mean, he would close himself in his room in our\napartment at 1092 President and he would be doing his homework, or practicing his\nviolin and I would be at -- first of all, if I wanted to come in, I had to knock. But -- And\nhe didn\u2019t like me to knock too often, cause I would disturb his concentration. So I would\nbe sitting in the kitchen, doing my homework, but every -- I don\u2019t know what it was, once\nan hour, or whatever, he would come out and he would just come up behind me and\nstroke my hair, I had rather long hair. I mean, not very long, but you know, sort of up to\nthe middle of my back, and stroke my hair and ask me how I was doing, look down to see\n-- make sure I was doing something serious. So, I was always aware of his presence. And\nyou know, it\u2019s funny, people say that when you grow up with parents who argue, that it\u2019s\nvery troublesome, and I only had one parent, but I had this brother. And, as I mentioned\non the videotape, very often my brother would say one thing and my mother would say a\ndifferent thing. But it never troubled me, because I had somehow, at some very early\nstage, made up my mind that my mother was very emotional and that what she said came\nout of, sort of an emotional rationale, whereas what my brother said made a lot more\nsense and came out of the gray matter center. And so, I was rarely troubled by this,\nbecause it was totally obvious that -- that almost all the time, it was better to do what my\nbrother said.",
        "Q: So what was you relationship then like with -- with your -- with your mother? How --\nHow -- How -- I mean, apart from -- from that even, I mean what -- what -- how did you -\n- how do you look back on it now, and -- and what -- what do you recall about it that\nstands out now?",
        "A: Well, I talked about this on the -- on the video interview, but my sense of my mother\nhas changed in the last 10 years. First of all, I had a very good relationship -- a pretty\ngood relationship with my mother for most of my growing up years, because first of all,\nmy mother went to the factory every day and I was left alone. So I had a lot of\nresponsibility and my mother trusted me. And also, my mother did not indulge in certain\nthings. For example, not terribly long after I came on -- I must have been like in first\ngrade, there was all this buzz around the block with the kids, about where do babies come\nfrom, you know. And my mother -- I don\u2019t think my mother really knew a lot about\nwhere babies come from. My mother told me what she thought was the truth, babies\ncome out of your stomach. Well, babies do not come out of your stomach, they come out\nof your uterus, but anyway, I mean, you know, she didn\u2019t have the anatomy quite right,\nbut -- but it -- or maybe that was just, you know, the way people talked about things in\nthose days, but -- but she -- you know, I asked one day, \u201cWhere do babies come from?\u201d\nAnd she just sat down and told me, you know, about the birds and the bees and the\nflowers, and -- in a -- as straightforward a manner as she knew. So, I went out on the\nstreet to play with my -- the little kids and ultimately this conversation arose about where\ndo babies come from and this one kid told me that babies are brought by the stork. And I\nlooked at this kid and I said, \u201cBabies are not brought by the stork.\u201d\u2019 And I repeated this\nwhole lesson that my mother had sai -- you know. So, some of the parents were very\ndistressed with either me or my mother, or both.",
        "Q: How old were you then?",
        "A: Maybe about eight or nine. That -- That I was going around spilling the beans about\nwhere babies really came from, when they were telling their kids these unbelievably\nridiculous stories. So I really appreciated that my mother was honest with me, as far as\nshe, you know, she could be, and -- and I could talk to her about things, and she talked to\nme about things and we -- we kind of -- we did all right together. You know, she -- When\nI had to memorize poems, you know, sh -- even though she was exhausted after coming\nhome from work, and then doing all the housework, cause my brother and I did\nappallingly little, my brother less than I, but she would sit in bed and listen to me recite,\nyou know, Gunga Din or something, ti -- until I had 1t memorized, and -- and I would test\nher. She had a book about how to learn English and I would test her about, you know,\nthis is cherry pie, and all these funny things. So she -- she was nice with me about, you\nknow, helping me study and so far as she could, and -- and so on. The first friction\nbetween my mother and me, happened when I was about 11, and the other -- there was\nanother little girl that -- on my floor in the apartment house who was a year older. She\nturned 12, and she started dating, and my mother got very nervous. My mother -- Well, I\n-- | don\u2019t know. My mother had an argument throughout the rest of our lives, which in\nretrospect is the most stupid, ridiculous argument, especially by 1990 standards, but in\ncollege, the last year of college, I was friends, pals, with another woman in the chemistr -\n- who was a chemistry major, and we\u2019re still friends, I mean, wa -- we still talk to each\nother, and I got her a job, as a matter of fact, where I used to work. This woman went off\nto Tanglewood with the guy who she subsequently married. And my mother was\nabsolutely horrified that -- that this woman went off to Tanglewood and stayed overnight\nin some barn -- I -- they slept in some barn. And I was very naive. I was -- I was very\nnaive, em-emotionally. So -- So this argument came up. My mother said, \u201cHm,\u201d you\nknow, \u201cwhat kind of a girl is this, going off to, you know, stay in a barn overnight with\nthis guy?\u201d And I said, \u201cMa, I\u2019m sure nothing happened.\u201d Now, in retrospect, when I look\nback, I think why the hell was I so sure that nothing happened, and who the hell cares?\nBut, I think the reason I was so sure that nothing happened was, I remember this young\nwoman once coming to me in the chemistry lab and telling me -- we were discussing --\ntampons had just come out. We were discussing whether it was all right to use tampons\nor not. And this woman said to me, \u201cWell, I can\u2019t use tampons because what if my hymen\nbroke and you know, what would this guy say, if we get married and I\u2019m not a virgin?\u201d\nAnd, so I think that\u2019s what made me so sure that probably nothing happened. So anyway,\nso this conversation, about did something happen or did not something happen in the\nbarn, my mother discussed until my mother got Alzheimer\u2019s disease. I mean, it would\ncome up once every year or two and my mother would say, \u201cThat was disgusting that she\nspent the night in the barn.\u201d And -- And I would say, \u201cMother, nothing happened in the\nbarn.\u201d You know, I mean, it was just, you know, just so --",
        "Q: Continue to --",
        "A: My mother was extremely proud of the fact that no man, other than my father, had\never touched her. When my mother was 80 and we had moved her up here and she went\nto a -- a -- I don\u2019t know, senior citizen club meetings in Brookline, one day, it was raining\nvery hard, and we came to pick her up to take her out to dinner or something, and she had\nwalked back, and she just casually mentioned, she said there was this guy who had\noffered her a ride home, and I said, \u201cWell,\u201d you know, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you take the ride? It\nwas raining.\u201d She said -- I mean, she just lifted her shoulders in that, you know, in that\nspecial, proud, European woman sort of way. I mean, y-you just don\u2019t see American\nwomen doing things like -- and she said, \u201cWho do you think Iam? Would I get into a car\nwith a strange man?\u201d And here she was, 80, you know? And -- But I mean -- But I grew\nup that way. I mean, I -- Even when I -- I never dated in college. I think I -- I actually did,\nmaybe on three occasions, go someplace with a guy. And they were -- they were\ngenerally very -- I mean, do you want to hear about this?",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: They were very strange events. I mean, I think the first time was, my father went to\nmedical school with a woman, who was the mother of two sons, and I always say that I\nwas friends with Bob Silber since four years before I was born, because our parents were\nfriends. And so -- so those two parents were doctors. That g -- That guy just died. That\nguy died in November, Bob Silber, he was a hematologist. But anyway, I mean I -- you\nknow, I\u2019ve known him forever, and so we were always friends and he would -- he -- he\nwas older, I mean, he was four years older than I was, and he would take me places like\nLewison Stadium, to the concerts and -- and things. And so one day he said, \u201cI have -- I\nhave this friend, and he\u2019s -- he\u2019s going to this,\u201d -- I don\u2019t know, was some dance where\nyou had to dress up. \u201cI want you to go with him.\u201d You know, \u201cNothing will happen,\neverything\u2019s going to be all right, I want you to go.\u201d So against great protest, I went and I\nwent and I bought a -- sort of a dress that I actually remember. And it was a very -- I had\na really unpleasant evening. I mean this -- I -- This guy didn\u2019t know how to dance, I had\nnever danced with anybody else before. I danced a lot by myself, but I hadn\u2019t ever danced\nwith anybody, except my mother and my brother before. I was just really uncomfortable\nin this situation. This guy didn\u2019t know how to carry on a conversation. I was -- So okay,\nso the next time, I think I -- well, then I went to work at Brookhaven. There was a special\nprogram and you could apply for it and I -- I got in to go to Brookhaven for two summers\nand work at Brookhaven National Lab. And I met a guy there, who actually is also a\ndoctor now, down I think, maybe in Florida, whose name was Norman Bauman, and he\nand I would talk a lot and he -- I mean, I think I actually -- I might have actually even\nkissed him or something. I don\u2019t know, but he -- he talked to me a lot about why was I so,\nyou know afraid of getting close to s -- to some guy ra -- so we had a lot of interesting\nconversations, and -- and I felt sort of friendly with him for awhile. But I think -- I think -\n- And I always had a fond spot in my heart for him, but I think it was more -- not so much\nbecause of things that he talked to me about -- you know the -- that sort of dating game,\nbut more because everybody I knew, practically, hated their mothers, and you know, sort\nof -- maybe it\u2019s still a popular thing to hate your mother, but Norman Bauman said, \u201cI\nreally respect my parents and I really like my mother.\u201d And he -- And I mean this -- that\nseemed very trivial in retrospect, but he said, \u201cOne of the things I really like about my\nmother is that she never comes down to see me or my father without looking nice. She\nalways combs her hair, she always has a nice bathrobe on. She always is respectful 1-in\nthat way.\u201d And I thought, \u201cWow, this guy is really different from anybody I\u2019ve ever\nmet.\u201d So that was my -- that was sort of like a first awakening. And then, in my senior\nyear -- the first year in college, I met a woman with whom I\u2019m still friends, although\nwe ve had our ups and downs, but we\u2019re still friends. And we got to be like best friends\nand we were best friends for four years. I mean, we spent practically all our spare time\ntogether. And -- But there was a -- there was a really big upheaval. Her mother was\nconstantly saying things like, \u201cBarbara, you can\u2019t marry Liane, what are you spending so\nmuch time with Liane?\u201d And I thought that was really like a horrible thing to say. You\nknow, I mean, she was always wanting her daughter to go out on dates. And so her\ndaughter did go out to tea dances, and you know, all these things that happened at the\ncollege. In -- I never went to any of those. I mean I -- you know, and I used to -- I used\nto -- when I heard about the tea dances, I used to call them the slave market. Maybe other\npeople called it that, also, you know, was the guys stood on one side, the women stood on\nthe other side and I really hated that, I would never go to anything like that\n[indecipherable]. And -- But anyway, the last year in college, she met this guy and I don\u2019t\nknow how it happened, but she went and had coffee with him and I was supposed to meet\nher and so I met him. And she called me up and she said, \u201cHe would like to go out with\nyou,\u201d you know. \u201cWould you consider going out with him?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I -- No, I\ndon\u2019t think so.\u201d And she kind of talked me into it. So -- So I went to the movies with this\nguy, tall, thin guy. You must be laughing at all of this. This -- This guy -- So we went to\nthe movies and then he took me home, which was, I think the first time I\u2019d ever been\ntaken home. I mean I -- I used to come home alone in New York from the subway, you\nknow, at two o\u2019clock in the morning, never bothered me. My mother was always worried,\nbut -- so he took me home and we got to my apartment door, and I was ready to say\ngoodnight and he said, \u201cCould I come in for a little while?\u201d Well, I didn\u2019t really want him\nto come in, but I felt 1t was very impolite, so I -- I let htm come in and so he sat down on\nthe couch in the living room, and I sat down on a chair on the other side of the room. And\nn -- the bedroom adjoined the living room with a -- glass doors, which might have had\nsome curtains on them, and they were not closed, and my mother was sleeping in this --\nin this next room. And he said, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you come here and sit next to me and\nget a little cozy?\u201d And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to come and sit there and get a little cozy.\u201d\nAnd then he came and sat down next to me, where I was sitting.",
        "Q: On the other side of the couch.",
        "A: Right. And do you -- you won\u2019t believe -- do you know what I did? I went and woke\nmy mother up to come and get this guy out of the house.",
        "Q: He must have been horrified. The poor guy.",
        "A: And I -- I met him on campus afterwards, and he said hello and I st -- do you know\nwhat I said to -- I said, \u201cYou are an animal.\u201d I said, \u201cYou behaved appallingly the other\nnight and I don\u2019t ever want to see you again.\u201d So, I mean, looking now at you know, the\ncurrent generations and so on, it\u2019s -- I mean, this is really funny, but -- but in those days, I\nmean, you know, my mother was so puritanical. And -- But it wasn\u2019t just my mother, it\u2019s\njust that she was more so, but I remembered this -- th -- my good friend Barbara, th-the\none who got me into this date, I remember one time -- I don\u2019t know -- I bought a package\nof sanitary napkins or something, and you know, in those days it wasn\u2019t displayed, and so\nthey would wrap it up in a br -- unmarked brown paper bag for you. And so we were in\nthe subway, and Barbara said, \u201cWhat\u2019s in the bag?\u201d And I said in a whisper, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s\nsanitary napkins.\u201d And she got so angry with me because she thought I said that too\nloudly. So, I mean, you know, you have to -- you have to understand what I\u2019m telling you\nin the context of those times. So, anyway -- So then, I think there was a very major\nchange that came. I really revered people who were very educated and who did important\nthings in their field. So, there were a couple of things. I took physics from a guy named\nAl Predell, was the physics teacher\u2019s name, and everybody had a crush on this guy,\nprobably except me, and -- but I kind of liked him, also. And he had a car and I was\ndying to learn how to drive. I mean, I just, mm, that was like uppermost in my mind. And\nthis guy actually let me drive. I -- I got a learner\u2019s permit or whatever, and this guy -- you\nknow, I don\u2019t remember exactly, I -- I think my chemistry teacher, a woman, who just\ndied at age 100, Dr. Stecker, for my graduation bought me driving lesson -- three driving\nlessons, or something like that. And this guy Al Predell, let me take a couple of little\nshort rides in his car, within the parking area. But he was an avid tennis player, and he\nplayed tennis with a professor who was at -- probably at Columbia at the time, whose\nname was Jack Steinberger, who\u2019s now in Switzerland if he\u2019s still alive, which I have no\nreason to believe that he isn\u2019t. Jack Steinberger won a Nobel Prize many years later, but\nJack Steinberger had come, I think from Germany, and had a reputation for being a very\nbrilliant nuclear physicist. So, I would sit on the tennis courts at Barnard sometimes,\nwatching Al Predell play tennis with Jack Steinberger. And then the second year, I was at\nBrookhaven, Jack Steinberger would occasionally turn up to use, I don\u2019t know the\nCosmotron or something. And -- And I was a real Jack Steinberger watcher, because I -- I\n-- you know, I had been told this is a great man. And one night Jack Steinberger asked me\nif I wanted to go for a ride, and I went for a ride with him and he started to make some\nadvances. You know, I mean, he was old enough to be my father -- well, I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe not quite. And I got very angry with him and I said, \u201cI\u2019m s --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This -- Okay, this is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Liane Reif-Lehrer. This 1s tape number three, side A.",
        "A: So -- So I gave Jack Steinberger this talking to, about you know, \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to\nbe a brilliant physicist, how could you act this way?\u201d You know, and I\u2019m only telling you\nabout this because I think that moment was a major turning point in my life, because Jack\nSteinberger looked at me in the eye, and he said, \u201cYou know, just because I\u2019m a clever\nphysicist, doesn\u2019t have anything whatsoever to do with the rest of my personality, and\nwhy are you trying to cubby-hole me like this?\u201d And he gave me this long -- I mean, it\nwas almost like an oration, about that I was doing something that didn\u2019t make sense. I\nwas trying to f -- to -- just because he did this one thing that I admired, I was trying to\npan onto that, all sorts of attributes about who he was. So anyway, he gave me this\nspeech, turned around, drove me back to my dorm and -- and that was -- that was that.\nAnd I -- Jack Steinberger appeared once, many years later, when I was with my husband\nin Cambridge, at a little snack bar, and I -- politely we -- we chatted. And then we never\nhad any contact until he won the Nobel Prize, and when he won the Nobel Prize, I knew\nwa -- I somehow periodically knew where he was. I wrote him a letter of congratulations\nand also -- and there was a little bit of correspondence back and forth, in which I -- I sort\nof partly apologized for, you know, being a really naive kid, or -- or something. But --\nBut I have to tell you that inside my inner self -- Jack Steinberger, after -- at some point,\nmarried some woman he had known for four days and had either one or two kids, and\nthen got divorced. And -- And that doesn\u2019t -- you know, to this day, I mean, even though\nmy brother is in his third marriage, and -- and lots of peop -- I mean 90 percent of --\neverybody seems to be divorced, remarried, you know, married five times, and so on and\nso forth. When I think about Jack Steinberger, I have some very positive feelings about --\nabout this very brilliant man who played tennis, but underneath that, there\u2019s a guy who --\nyou know, who did something that was irresponsible. I mean, what [indecipherable] you\nget married after four days? I mean, what kind of stupid thing is that? But -- And -- But I\nthink -- But I think I have Jack Steinberger to thank, in a way, for -- for the fact that I got\nmarried, because he -- he did s -- he snapped something in my way of thinking, that\nallowed me to view things differently from the way I had ever viewed them before.",
        "Q: Okay. Let me just -- I want to -- I want to continue the -- the chronology, but before I\nforget I want to go back to a couple things. Just -- More -- More back in your childhood, I\n-- | wanted to ask you about whether your -- you or your mother, or your -- your brother,\nin the years that you first arrived, in \u201941 through 45, especially, wa-was there an attempt\nto k -- sort of keep up on what was happening, either through just reading the papers, or --\nor through some -- some other, you know, word of mouth or correspondence? Did y --\nWere you aware of what was going on there, and was your family?",
        "A: Yeah. Well, first of all, my mother was an avid newspaper reader, so when we first\ncame, she used to read th -- a German paper called The Alfbo, which may still exist. And\nthen she -- then she -- when she could read English, she would read that plus the daily -- I\nthink The Post, she used to read and sometimes The New York Times. I --",
        "Q: Was it A-A-Alfbo it was called?",
        "A: Alfbo.",
        "Q: And was that a German --",
        "A: A German --",
        "Q: -- controlled?",
        "A: No, no, no, it\u2019s a German --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] this was a German language --",
        "A: -- no, it\u2019s published here, but a German language newspaper.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Mm-hm.",
        "A: So she was very interested in keeping up with the news. She also was very a -- I mean,\nall sh -- you know, we left everybody behind in -- in Europe. I mean, her parents and --\nwere in Poland. Her sister and her sister\u2019s husband and children, her brother and -- you\nknow, and all my father\u2019s relatives were -- were there, except for these two -- My Aunt\nLena Klinghoffer and -- and my -- my father\u2019s brother, my Uncle Jack, and -- who\nspelled his name with an extra f, R-e-1-f-f, for some bizarre reason. So she was always\ntrying to make contact, and she -- she sent Care packages to certain people. You know\nthat place called Care, and they send packages? I don\u2019t remember who, but she often --\nwhen she could afford it, later on, she would send Care packages to certain people. I\u2019m\ntrying to find out what happened to different people, th -- I think there was -- you know\nthat -- telephoning was not easy, the way it is now, and we didn\u2019t -- when we first moved\ninto our apartment in Brooklyn, we didn\u2019t have a telephone for a long time, and then it\nwas, you know, it was very special, having this telephone and -- but you didn\u2019t telephone\nlightly. I mean, you know, where you had, I don\u2019t know, 20 telephone calls a month in --\nin whatever the minimum charge was, but -- so she did try very hard. I was -- I think I\nwas fairly unattached from that whole thing, but -- but what happened 1s, as the years\nwent by in New York, different people would appear. Like this -- this guy I told I you\nwas friends with since four years before I was born, I mean s -- at some time, and I don\u2019t\nremember exactly when, his family, who had gone to Santa Domingo, appeared in New\nYork. And so, all of a sudden, there was this new old friendship that picked up and so\nthey would come to visit us, we would go to visit them. Doctor Kleinfeld, the -- the\nlawyer, we went to visit his family quite often. I mentioned that in the other interview, he\nwas the one who helped us pack the van. And then he died, I don\u2019t remember of what,\nand -- but his -- his second wife, who is the one we -- we knew, lived in New York, we\nvisited her a long time. I pretty much lost track. They -- They had three children. One, the\noldest one was from a first marriage, he went to Israel and I -- I think I once\ncorresponded with him. The daughter I once corresponded with, but I\u2019ve lost track of her.\nThe son is a math professor, where? Maybe in Iowa, or something, and I -- I have\noccasionally corresponded with him, but the -- the s -- that son married a woman that my\nbrother kind of liked also, and -- and I don\u2019t mean romantically -- well, maybe even\nromantically, but anyway, that woman, who still goes by the name of Ruth Kleinfeld, a --\n1 -- now lives in Hawaii, she\u2019s a professor -- retired professor of biology, and we have\nsuddenly started e-mailing back and forth a -- a fair amount. Sh -- But she and Irwin\nKleinfeld got divorced after quite a lot of years. They didn\u2019t have any children. Irwin\nKleinfeld remarried, she remarried, her husband\u2019s now very sick. So -- So these people\nwould keep, you know, cropping up from -- from the old country.",
        "Q: Did -- Were you aware of a -- wh -- th -- I mean, a-as a child, I -- I -- I know that there\nwas this -- this envelope that arrived one day, and I want to ask you about that, but before\nthat happened --",
        "A: The blue letter, yeah.",
        "Q: The blue letter. Before that arrived, were you aware that -- did you have any sense, or\ndid your mother or brother have any sense of -- of this --",
        "A: Oh, I think my brother had a very real sense. Whenever I discuss, for example, the trip\non the San Louis with my brother, he always says he doesn\u2019t -- he could not understand,\neven though he was so young, he could not understand why, on the voyage going to the\nU.S., before the boat was turned around, why were all these people dancing and doing all\nthese jovial things, when they had just left their families behind, knowing they probably\nwould never see them again, they had lost family members.

        "A: Absolutely. I mean --",
        "Q: But -- And so he -- Did he -- I mean, to what degree did he or any of you know what\nwas going on?",
        "A: I think my brother was extremely aware. I don\u2019t think I was terribly aware, I just knew\nthat bad things were happening, but I don\u2019t think -- I don\u2019t think I -- you know, I don\u2019t\nthink I sort of was into formulating thoughts like, how come I don\u2019t have grandparents, or\n-- | mean, maybe I thought that, cause there were grandparents in the house, but I -- it\ndidn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think it really sank in. Th-The first -- The loss of my father, that sank in,\nbecause I heard about that all the time, you know, once a year my mother lit candles. My\nmother wore black for years and years and years. She often reminisced about my father.\nOne of the things that I\u2019m hoping to find one day 1s, unti -- I -- I really -- I -- in -- ina lot\nof ways, I ten -- I guess I grew up like a boy, and so there was sort of a no-no. You\nweren\u2019t supposed to cry. I -- And my mother would start talking about these things and\nshe would -- she would dissolve in tears and I -- I couldn\u2019t cope with seeing her that way\nand I couldn\u2019t -- I just couldn\u2019t deal with that whole scene and so I would -- I would\nalways turn her off, which was really terrible, I mean in retrospect. And now I\u2019m -- \u2019'm\nsorry, and actually, one day, long after I was married and had kids, my mother was up\nhere and she started talking about -- and I -- I was trying to stop her and ma -- and my\nhusband --",
        "Q: She started talking about what?",
        "A: The past. You know, what happened, my father, etcetera. I -- And I just could never\ncope with that, so -- so I just -- I think I just kind of walked out of the room or something,\nand -- and my husband took a tape recorder and said okay -- we -- we both called her --\nwell, my husband called her grandma, I think, after the kids were born. And he took a\ntape recorder and he had her record a whole tape about her feelings, an -- and I cannot fi -\n- that tape has got to be somewhere in this house, and I cannot find it. Because, of course,\nnow I\u2019m dying to know what were her thoughts and I am extremely angry with myself for\nnot asking her all sorts of questions that I want to know about, and -- but I just could not\nemotionally cope with listening to her, not -- not only because the information was\nhurtful, but because I think I could not cope with watching her dissolve in tears. And\nguess what? At some stage -- and I don\u2019t know when it started to happen, I started\ndissolving in tears, ev -- you know, for certain things and I -- I can\u2019t even define, but\nwhen people talk about certain things -- certain kinds of things that happen, or talk about\ncertain things related to my mother or my father, or -- I -- I just involuntarily start crying\n-- or sometimes if the kids say something. And that is so horrible, because I remember\nwhat it -- an awful feeling it was when my mother cried. So I\u2019m always apologizing to\nthe kids, you know, I\u2019m sorry, this 1s totally involuntary.",
        "Q: But --",
        "A: I don\u2019t mean to be doing this.",
        "Q: A-And so it -- wa -- it\u2019s partly just -- what you learned was that you don\u2019t do this. Do\nyo -- Do you -- Do you know why that you felt that that was inappropriate? That -- That,\nyou know, you don\u2019t -- y-y-y -- you got to be tough, you got to move on, you know,\ngiven what you had gone through, was it --",
        "A: Well, I's -- I certainly knew that you had to be tough and you had to move on. I mean,\nI think that was a -- I think that was a lesson I learned pretty early. But why I couldn\u2019t\nlisten to her, you know, spilling out what was hurting her and so on, I think it\u2019s because it\njust made me feel so awful to see her cry and to see her be in that kind of pain. And I --\nAnd I did a very non-adult thing, I mean I -- the adult thing would have been to just sit\nand listen and say something helpful, and -- and my -- my -- my thing was to disappear. I\nwanted to just get the hell out of there.",
        "Q: And -- And what sort of things now d -- like you saying sometimes you\u2019ll just dissolve\ninto tears yourself when it\u2019s triggered by something. What -- What -- Is it specific\nmemories of this time, or other things that are traumatic in the world? What -- What\nkinds of things?",
        "A: Probably all of the above. I mean, like I\u2019ve been very good this morning, but -- but\nyou could say something, or I could say something and all of a sudden, I just\ndecompensate, as I call it. Sometimes it -- just in recent weeks, listening when I -- you\nknow, I can listen and I can be very stern and all there to the news every night about\nYugoslavia, but sometimes, when I hear or see a picture of the refugees mar-marching\ndown the road, and an old lady in a wheelbarrow or something, I just -- you know, tears\ncome to my eyes and I just --",
        "Q: Taps real deep, huh?",
        "A: Yes. As a matter of fact, as I was saying to somebody the other day, I think this\nKosovo thing has probably come closer to getting to the real inside of me than anything\nthat\u2019s happened in the intervening times. I mean, every time there is anything about war,\nor violence or anything like that, that absolutely turns my stomach. I mean, I -- I know\nthis is a stupid, naive thing to say, but I ha -- I, to this day, I do not understand how\npeople can call themselves civilized and -- and -- and fight wars. I mean, it\u2019s -- th -- the\nconcept seems so ridiculous that, you know, you shoot me and Ill shoot at you and\nwhoever gets the most guys down, gets to do what they want. And in the meantime -- you\nknow, I wrote a po -- I -- I like to write poetry sometimes, I haven\u2019t done it for a long\ntime, but I used to do it more. I wrote a poem after the Yom Kippur War, in which I tried\nto express that when you have a child, you know, the nine months of gestation is not a big\ndeal, but it\u2019s the next 21 years, when you essentially devote the most incredibly -- I mean,\nif you\u2019re a reasonable parent at least, the most incredible amount of emotional energy, to\ntry to make this fledgling fly. It is -- It\u2019s -- I mean, it\u2019s just an -- it\u2019s the hardest thing that\nI\u2019ve ever, ever done in my life. And the thought that somebody can say, \u201cWell, hey so\ntoday we\u2019re going to have a war, and I\u2019Il shoot a few of your kids, and you\u2019ll shoot a few\nof my kids, and then they\u2019ll be gone.\u201d That is so obscene a thought to me, that I -- I mean,\nI literally, I don\u2019t even have words to express what I feel about that. Do you have\nchildren, by the way?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t know.",

About, I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe 13 years ago, I-I -- I generally, for the last 15 or so years, I\u2019ve -- go out -- go out\nrunning in the morning, and I used to have a route along the highway, and --",

        "A: I went out and I was running on Pleasant Street, which 1s a fairly well traveled street,\nand that morning, I saw a cat that looked virtually exactly like this black cat, which 1s our\ndaughter\u2019s cat, and it had even that same little kink at the end of the tail, and it had been\nrun over. I saw that cat, and I started to -- I mean, it was more than weeping, it was\nalmost screaming and I came running home here, and I was -- I think my daughter was\nactually here, and I -- I just came up and I sat on the bed next to my husband and I -- I\nwas just literally falling apart, I was just weeping and weeping and weeping,\nuncontrollably. And then the cat, our cat, came back into the house. So my husband and I\n-- so I calmed down, my husband and I went and buried this other cat, but something\nhappened to me that day, and I don\u2019t know what it was, but I\u2019ve always thought to myself\nthat no matter how horrible -- and I -- this may not be true, but -- but the thought in my\nhead is that -- that I would never, ever be that upset again, no matter what happened. That\n-- That I would -- That I would just never, ever crack up like that again.",

You know, if I had my life to live over again and if I\ncould afford it this time, which I couldn\u2019t have the last time around, I think it would be\nreally interesting t-to go -- have psychotherapy, a-and see if they could, you know, drag\nanything out of me. But again, I mean, that was -- you know, that was just some real\nchange, I mean, like the thing that happened with Jack Steinberger, which allowed me to\nget on with -- I don\u2019t -- you know, some other level of living. But -- But when the cat --\nWhen I found that dead cat that day, I -- I just -- I mean, I went berserk in a way that I\ndon\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever gone berserk before. And -- And something just snapped and I --\nand since then -- I mean, you know, people that I know have died and bad things have\nhappened and -- but I -- I don\u2019t think I have ever again been at that incredible whatever it\nwas.

        "Q: But it wasn\u2019t just about a cat, it seems.",
        "A: Well, I -- I ca -- It couldn\u2019t have been just about the cat, because you know, I re -- we\nhad a wonderful, wonderful Siberian Husky dog, for about 12 years, and I just absolutely\nadored that dog and that dog -- one night my husband -- well, he was -- she was very\narthritic and one day my husband took her out for a walk and he let her off the leash,\nwhich he almost never did, and she walked away and never came back. And my son and I\nsat and cried together, and -- you know, but 1t wasn\u2019t -- it wasn\u2019t that same thing. And\nwhen my mother died, that was s -- that was horrible, but -- but it wasn\u2019t that same --\nwhatever thing happened to me the day I found that dead cat.",
        "Q: Yeah. You know, as you\u2019re talking about this, wh -- you know, where you started\ntalking about looking at this picture, and you\u2019re talking about the war that\u2019s going on now\nin -- in Yugoslavia and Serbia and Kosovo and -- and we\u2019re looking at the picture of\nthese children, you\u2019re talking about war and children. And I was thinking, you know,\nwhen I was preparing for the interview and thinking about talking to you, you know, one\nquestion came to my mind, and -- and I wonder if it -- it forms your memory of this time,\nor even maybe your views, subsequently, of the world is, you know, being on the San\nLouis and -- and not having a place to get off, I mean, it\u2019s such a horrible and almost like\nmythological story, you know. And I was wondering, you know, in your mind, in your\nheart, li -- did you have a sense or do you have sense now of what -- what kind of world\nis it, that doesn\u2019t let people get off that ship?",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know that I thought about it at the time, but -- and my brother\ncertainly thought a lot about it, but I think about it a lot now, because -- and especially\nwith the Kosovo situation. I mean, I often wonder about -- you know, I -- what kind --\nthis is really a funny world, you know, we have borders. And I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve been\nasked to lecture about five times now in the former Soviet Union, and this last trip, which\nwas the first week of May, I -- I didn\u2019t feel this so much this time, but the other trips, I\ncertainly felt -- actually, I was very apprehensive before this trip, I was very apprehensive\nbefore this trip, but then once I left, 1-it was -- it was okay, but the other trips, I don\u2019t\nknow, more funny things happened, and you see police people with machine guns. You\nknow, I mean, you see that sometimes in -- 1n western Europe also, but I -- I really don\u2019t\ndo well with that, at all.",
        "Q: Checkpoints you mentioned.",
        "A: Yes, or guns. I really do not like guns.",
        "Q: What is it -- What does it do? Make you nervous, does it make you angry?",
        "A: It makes me ner -- It makes me nervous and it also makes me angry. Guns can hurt\npeople. An-And we were just having this discussion the other night, guns can hurt people\nin a very impersonal way. Oh, I -- It was my son who was saying that, that, you know, if\nyou -- I -- they were talking about gun control and I said, \u201cOh well, you know, big deal.\nSo they take away the guns, they\u2019Il do it some other way.\u201d And my son said, \u201cWell, you\nknow, it\u2019s a little hard when you have to kind of actually go up and physically grab\nsomebody,\u201d he said. \u201cWith a gun, it\u2019s very impersonal, you can stay far away, you can\nget a lot of people at once,\u201d and so on. I -- The idea of -- of people hurting other people,\neven emotionally, but -- but certainly physically, is extremely abhorsen to me. I mean, it -\n- We have come such a long way, you know. I look around me, we send somebody to the\nmoon, we have televisions, we have CD\u2019s, now we have mini CD\u2019s, you know, we keep\nmaking progress. We do all these wonderful things. And then we turn around and kill\neach other. Does that make sense? I mean, there\u2019s something bizarrely inappropriate\nabout -- about that. And I guess -- I mean, people sometimes challenge me on -- on -- on\nthat, but I guess -- I don\u2019t know, I guess I value brain power a lot, and I don\u2019t want to see\nanybody killed or -- or hurt or anything, but -- but I have some funny feelings inside\nwhen somebody really worthwhile gets killed, and then there are all these people around\nwho are costing society money, and causing troub --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning of Tape Three, Side B",

        "A: If somebody -- some ridiculous person goes out and kills off some wonderful person,\nwho\u2019s making fantastic contributions to society, etcetera, that -- I mean, I\u2019m very\ndemocratic, but that makes me even more angry, because you know, like -- all right, if\nyou don\u2019t want to do anything constructive and you want to go to some island and send\nall people who want to be on drugs, and not do anything constructive, and you want to go\nthere and you want to fight each other all the time, you know, go, be my guest, do it. Kull\nyourselves off, you know, do whatever you want. But just don\u2019t bother the people who\nare trying to be constructive and who are using their brain power to make the world a\nbetter place to live in. I mean it -- it -- you know, if you take -- an-and of course, in a war\n-- in a war situation, what do you do? You take the -- the cream of your population, you\ntake the people who are, you know, 20 to 30. In the sciences, those -- that\u2019s the -- that\u2019s\nthe place where, for example, in physics, that\u2019s the time when people make their\ncontributions. So you take this -- this group of people at the absolute apex of their time to\ncontribute and to -- to do wonderful things and you -- you pop them off? I mean, 1-1t\u2019s --\nit\u2019s not a good thing for me to talk about because I -- you know, I mean, there\u2019s another\npart of me that says yeah, you know, I mean, people are -- I mean, why do I expect\npeople to be different from all the other animals? You know, you -- you watch channel\ntwo, or you watch the Nature channel and you know, this animal eats that next animal\ndown, that\u2019s a little smaller and a little slower and so on and so forth. And after all, we\u2019re\njust evolved from those. So why am I surprised, you know? But then I said, but you\nknow, but tions and ligers, and -- ta -- lions and tigers don\u2019t invent, you know,\nCosmotrons and airplanes and spaceships and so on and so forth. So -- So we are a little\ndifferent. Well, if we are a little different, why don\u2019t we act as though we are a little bit\nmore civilized than those other species? But we don\u2019t. You know, people get into bar\nroom brawls, and -- and they get drunk and they waste their lives and they --",
        "Q: I think -- you know, picking up on this a little bit, to just ask you just -- I mean, I\nguess I-I\u2019m wondering whether the Saint Louis experience 1s something that you feel has\nshaped you, that -- that sort of not being able to come to port. I mean, is that something\nthat you\u2019ve carried with you as a -- as a world view, in a sense? In -- In a -- In a sense of\nhaving only a certain number of, you know, in a sense of trust, perhaps?",
        "A: Well, first of all, that\u2019s -- yeah, I\u2019m not a very trusting person. I\u2019m -- I guess, in some\nways, I\u2019m a very suspicious person. I mean, in some ways, I\u2019m very trusting, but on the\nwhole, I\u2019m not very trusting. I think the San Louis business had a very major effect on\nme, but not -- not in a direct, obvious way, but -- I mean, first of all, I sit here now, at my\npresent age of almost 65, and look back on it and think, you know, yeah, I mean, you\nknow, this is a ca -- this is supposed to be a country, give me your tired, your poor, and\nhere were 900 people who -- I mean, anybody who had any ounce of brain in their head\nwould have known what the probable fate of these people were if they got sent back to\nEurope. You know -- So I keep asking myself, I mean, what would it have hurt anybody\nto let these people in? And most people had visas to the U.S. anyway. They -- It was just\n-- I mean, ours was like six months from coming due. But then, on the other hand, I --\nyou know, my rational self takes over and I say, \u201cWell, maybe they can\u2019t do that,\nbecause, you know, what if everybody in the whole wide world wanted to move to the\nU.S.? That wouldn\u2019t work, so what do you do? And I don\u2019t know the answer and I\u2019m a\nvery non-political animal. But I think the more important thing that shaped me, for better\nor worse, 1s that we did have to go back and we did go through this experience in France,\nand coming here, and I think those events, very, very much shaped a lot of my views.\nAnd my brother always says, you know, we are stronger because we survived all those\nthings, than we would have been if none of this had happened.",
        "Q: I-In what way do you think that they sh -- those later events shaped your views? I\nmean, we\u2019ve been talking about a lot of that, but I mean, di -- does something really stand\nout in terms of -- of how that shaped your world view?",
        "A: I think -- Well, I think I owe my brother something for this, but also, I think it taught\nme that, you know, people are people and they, unfortunately, speak different languages,\nwhich makes life interesting, but -- but more bellicose. Because when you don\u2019t speak the\nsame language, you can\u2019t even explain to the other person, usually, you know, how\nyou\u2019re feeling about something. So -- But I got to meet people in -- you know, a lot of\ndifferent cities, a lot of different places. I got bounced around and I learned that, you\nknow, wherever I went, there were some people who were wonderful, and there were\nsome people who were kind of just there, and there were some people who were slightly\non the disgusting side. And I think the most important thing that I learned was to -- I\nmean sh -- of course I generalize often, you know, in conversation, but I don\u2019t really\ngeneralize in my -- in my own head. I don\u2019t -- And when I do, I -- every time, I will pull\nmyself back. If I say, \u201cOh my God, those CPA\u2019s are so, you know, something or other,\nbecause I -- I give a lecture to a group of CPA\u2019s once a year and they seem so boring.\nAnd so I[\u2019Il say -- I'll -- I mean a thought like that may cross my mind and then -- and\nthen I always pull myself back and say, you know, not all CPA\u2019s are that way and -- and -\n- and everybody\u2019s different and you really have to meet each person and get to know that\nperson, and not make a judgment, and -- and I\u2019m not really making a judgment, I mean\nit\u2019s just kind of a comment that -- so I think -- I think -- I think that whole scenario taught\nme to be resilient in a lot of ways, taught me to -- to be, I hope, fairly open-minded.\nTaught me to be reasonably liberal. I just learned a lot. I guess mostly taught me to be\nresilient. Taught me to be able to shift on a dime, often. You know, taught me to do what\nneeds to be done and -- and try to get on with things as best as possible.",

        "A: Mm-hm.",

        "A: Oh, that I carry a lot of. As a matter of fact, that\u2019s an -- that\u2019s an almost horrible,\nhaunting thing. First of all, I am extremely aware that not only I, but we\u2019re all alive by\nchance, and I\u2019m not talking about the chance of having been conceived and born, but I\u2019m\ntalking about that every day, all sorts of horrible things happen, that -- that very abruptly\nend people\u2019s lives, and all you have to do 1s to happen to be 1n the wrong place at the\nwrong time. You know, if you\u2019re standing outside and you get hit by lightning in the\nwrong way, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s the end. That 1s always just one millimeter away from the top\nof my head. I fought against my mother being worried all the time, but I think I\u2019m a very\ngood mother, except -- or have been a very good mother, except for one thing, and that is\nthat I\u2019ve always worked full time and I\u2019ve always been able to cope with this, but it\nactually sort of gets harder. I mean, I could be sitting at my desk at work and be writing a\npaper about you know, the induction of glutamine synthetase and all of a sudden, some\nhorrible scenario will flash through my head. All -- This has happened to me all through\nmy adult life. F-For just -- you know, for a nanosecond.",

And -- And this sort of chill or shiver comes\nacross my body, and then -- but I\u2019m a reasonably controlled person, and so all my life,\nsomething like that happens and I -- I have the ability to push it out immediately, and say,\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to think about that.\u201d But, it gets -- it gets harder. I mean, I -- and so -- I\nmean, I try na -- I have tried not to -- to -- to do this thing to my children.",
        "Q: To do what thing?",
        "A: This thing that my mother did about, you know -- I was very good about this, you\nknow, call me. Call me when you get there, call me, call me, let me know, you know,\netce -- two years after we finished graduate school, my husband and I took a -- took a\nyear off and took a trip around the world. I wrote my mother every day. Now, she didn\u2019t\nget those things every day, unfortunately, you know, she\u2019d get nothing for a week and,\nyou know -- and now when I think back on it, I think, \u201cOh my God, what did I do to her?\nHow could I have done that to her?\u201d To -- To leave her worrying all the time, cause she\nmust -- she was undoubtedly worried all the time, and -- but I -- I didn\u2019t understand in\nthose days, what is she worrying about, you know? As a matter of fact, she would always\nbe worried when I came home alone at night after dark and I thought, \u201cWhat the hell is\nshe worrying about?\u201d You know, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m just walking from the subway,\u201d you\nknow, and -- it wasn\u2019t real -- it wasn\u2019t until I was in college and I had an unpleasant\nincident with a guy following me, when I was in college, that really got me scared, that I\nrealized for the first time, why my mother was worried. But, I try not to worry about my\nchildren, and I have a lot -- I always have a lot of work to do and that\u2019s a very good thing\nfor me, because I get very involved in my work. But, there\u2019s that voice that comes in. I\nmean, for example, I try not to make the kids call me, okay, very often. But now our\nson\u2019s been -- been sick and now I\u2019m sort of more worried, so now I say, well just for this\nperiod, it\u2019s all right for me to ask him to call. That was him calling to tell me that he had\narrived where he was going. Our daughter right now 1s 1n Israel, and I ha -- I must say\nI\u2019ve been very good for her being 1n Israel, for these few weeks, partly because I\u2019m so\nworried about our son that it\u2019s kind of a diversion for me. But then, a few days go by and\nif I haven\u2019t heard from her, there are all these things that start. It\u2019s almost like a cash\nregister tape. What if s-such and such happened? You know, maybe this happened,\nmaybe that happened. And I just -- I mean, I just have to live with that, and I try as -- as\nhard as I can, to not -- to not make them aware of that any more than is necessary, to not\nmake that a burden to them, the way it was a burden to me, that my mother always\nworried about me. But you know, our daughter -- bo-both of our kids are -- are -- are very\nwith it. And -- And our -- our daughter is a very clever young lady. And so one day she\nsaid something about this, and I said, \u201cWell, you know, I have tried very hard to not, you\nknow, do to you what my mother did to me.\u201d And she looked at me and she said, \u201cMa,\nwho do you think you\u2019re kidding?\u201d She said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything and we\nknow exactly what you\u2019re thinking. We know exactly when you\u2019re worried, you don\u2019t\nhave to say one word.\u201d And -- And you know, and they\u2019ve been very good about it. I\nmean, I try very hard, when things are normal, I try to bite my tongue and I try very hard,\nwhen they were living at home, to not say call me, you know, or something. So\nsometimes I\u2019ve made an agreement, if you\u2019re not going to be home by one, would you\ngive me a call? So that\u2019s my exterior and that\u2019s the way I want it to be for the kids. But\nbehind the scenes, hoo. First of all, I\u2019m a very punctual person, in the Germanic way, you\nknow. And my brother, wuh, my brother and this other German kid, when they were both\nat Columbia college, would meet each other on Saturdays at noon. This guy would pace\nthe street downstairs and at exactly noon, Meridian time, our bell would ring. And if I\ntold my brother I was meeting him at 12:06, and I was one minute late, he would look at\nme very sternly and say, \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d So -- So I grew up with that, okay? So, you come\non time. If -- And this has happened many times, and my broth -- my husband is\nwonderful with this, because he generally does not -- it takes a lot to start him worrying.\nSo, one of our kids goes out, they say they\u2019Il be home at about one. So I\u2019m fine, more or\nless, until one. At 1:05, something starts happening in my body, that I can\u2019t describe to\nyou. By 1:10 it\u2019s getting worse and by 1:15, I\u2019m in bad shape.",
        "Q: In -- In what way? How are you in bad shape?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s as though there are seven million ants crawling inside of me, or I -- I\nmean, I can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t even describe it, and then I start saying to my husband, \u201cDo you\nthink we should call?\u201d And my husband says, \u201cNo, they\u2019ll -- they\u2019re fine.\u201d And then I --\nyou know, so I wait another 15 minutes and then this thing has --",
        "Q: Your stomach\u2019s churning, and --",
        "A: Su -- At the very end stages, my stomach starts churning, it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s like a total\nbody discomfort. And then -- And I get more and more anxious and -- and then my\nhusband starts listing all the reasons why they\u2019re late. And the funny thing is, I\u2019m a very\ngood learner, except for this, because 99 percent of the time, when they get home, my\nhusband has hit on one of the reasons why they\u2019re late. And it\u2019s always some very\nlegitimate thing. But I start to no longer -- after -- actually, our kids are very good and\nthey rarely are more than half an hour late without calling. They really are wonderful. So\nit\u2019s very rare that I get to this extreme stage, but I listen to his -- to my husband\u2019s\nrationale, and then it gets worse and worse and then it sort of star -- I start to de-focus\nfrom that. I can all of a sudden no longer focus on all those rational explanations. And\none of the really horrible, horrible things that -- that I did to myself once, which has never\ngone away is, there was a program on television and I -- I watched it -- I don\u2019t know why\nI watched it, I just -- I don\u2019t know, I was tired or something, and it was -- it was\napparently a true story. It was about a woman with a professional husband, I think maybe\nher husband was a doctor or something and the kid goes to buy something at a -- maybe\nin an electronics store and the mother gets worried. It was on PBS, I think. The mother\ngets worried and she says to the father, \u201cI\u2019m worried about this -- my son.\u201d And the\nfather says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019ll be home soon,\u201d you know. And the mother gets just -- it\nwas -- it was an almost exact depiction of what I feel, and finally the mother says, \u201cI\u2019m\ngoing to see where he is.\u201d And the mother goes and she follows his tracks and -- and\nfigures out where he 1s and she walks into this electronics store, which -- and there are\nsome really bad criminals who have come in, and tied everybody on the floor, and\nthey\u2019ve actually -- and the mother actually gets killed, but the son survives and the --\nthese -- these criminals have tied everybody up and they -- I don\u2019t know, they robbed the\nstore or something, but they -- they pour lye down everybody\u2019s throat that they\u2019ve tied\nup. And that mo -- that program has never left me, because every time now that I -- you\nknow, this must have been 10 years ago, that I have this conversation with my husband,\nand he says everything\u2019s all right, immediately this -- this movie pops into my head. And\nat the end of that movie, you see the son, who is sort of damaged, but he\u2019s kind of all\nright, with his father, talking about that this is a real story, and this is what happened.\nAnd I -- I just replay that scene. Oh yeah, there\u2019s the father saying everything\u2019s fine, and\nthe mother, in her gut, knew that something was wrong and -- and so that now gets\nreplayed in my head, on top of all the normal stuff that gets replayed. So I -- And then --\nAnd then the last stages, if they\u2019re not home and it\u2019s now 45 minutes, or an hour, which\nas I say, happens very rarely, sometimes I will just crack up and weep. You know, and\nmy husband will sit there and he\u2019!l comfort me and then the phone rings and -- and all of\na sudden, I come to absolute attention and you can hear nothing -- I make sure you can\nhear nothing of that in my voice, and kid says, \u201cSorry Mom, I got involved in this, you\nknow, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m just leaving for home.\u201d And I s -- \u201cFine, did you have a good time?\nGreat. Thanks for calling me, I really appreciate it.\u201d And I hang up, you know, and then I\ncan finish kind of curing myself from the episode that has just transpired.",
        "Q: Wow. That\u2019s a -- That\u2019s a -- That\u2019s powerful stuff.",
        "A: It is powerful stuff, but I don\u2019t want you -- I want you to know that I live a reasonably\nnormal life despite that, and I\u2019m a very productive person and things like this don\u2019t\nhappen all that often. And as I say, I have been -- I mean, now my daughter\u2019s in Israel,\nand guess what? She\u2019s in Israel, she\u2019s in Israel. All these horrible things happen in Israel.\nYou know, bombs go -- get thrown into buses and you know, and I [indecipherable]. And\nmy friends tell me, well, you know, actually, if you look at the statistics, Israel is safer\nthan New York City, and you know -- and I try to tell myself and you know, and so on.\nBut when she calls, it\u2019s like this miraculously happy event. And she\u2019s -- she\u2019s been very\ngood. You know, she -- she has called ev -- once a week. This week she sent me an e-\nmail after sh -- three days after she called, and -- you know, but now she\u2019s gone down to\nAilot and I hope sometime this weekend, I\u2019ll get a call. Damon\u2019s going out to drive to --\nto Amherst. If I go and drive, I mean, I think nothing of it. And both of our kids are good\ndrivers, but there\u2019s always that niggling -- you know, and I think this is because I had this\nfather, and one day he never came back again. And I think there\u2019s something deep down\ninside of me that is forever scared of that ever happening again. My husband goes off on\nhis bicycle to work. He\u2019s had -- you know, he\u2019s bicycled safely for, I don\u2019t know, 10\nyears now, but he has had two somewhat not pleasant accidents, but not, you know, not\nhorrible, horrible. Now, I tell him, \u201cLook, you\u2019re a grown-up and I can\u2019t do anything bad\nto you as a grown-up. So you got to call me the minute you get to work.\u201d And he\u2019s very\ngood about that, I mean, the minute he gets to work, he calls. And that was, at first, very\nshort phone call. \u201cHello, I\u2019m here.\u201d \u201cOkay, bye.\u201d And then, at night -- at night, it\u2019s dark,\nthere are lights, there are cars, can they see him? It\u2019s harder. Last night he came home 15\nminutes later than he said he would, which 1s pretty -- not very usual. So, he said he\u2019d be\nhome at 7:30. So at 7:32, I looked at the clock and by that time Damon had come back\nfrom Amherst, and -- so at least -- so I wasn\u2019t alone. When I\u2019m alone, my imagination is\na lot worse than when there\u2019s somebody else there. But, I\u2019m still watching the clock, so\n7:35, I shouldn\u2019t say anything. 7:40 -- \u201cI wonder where dad is,\u201d out loud. Damon -- I\ndon\u2019t know whether Damon even noticed that I said that or not. 7:41, I\u2019m up at the\nbedroom window, looking out to see if there\u2019s any sign of him. \u201cLiane, Damon\u2019s here,\nyou can\u2019t stay up here and watch at the window, because there\u2019s no point in worrying\nhim.\u201d So I come back down to the kitchen, and at 7:45, I hear the -- the door opening, so -\n- and it\u2019s okay.",
        "Q: And then -- And then it\u2019s all fine for you?",
        "A: Then it\u2019s all fine. Then it\u2019s all fine. But I -- But, you know, except for those few\nminutes, I go up there, I look -- I look out the window. Maybe sometimes I waste a\ncouple of more minutes, cause I\u2019Il run down to the door or something. But I need you to\nknow that 95, or 99 percent of the time, I\u2019m productive and I\u2019m working and I\u2019m -- you\nknow, I\u2019m either making dinner or cleaning up, or doing work work -- you know,\nprofessional work or -- but these images invade. It\u2019s like a kind of a Star Wars thing, you\nknow it -- it\u2019s like the spaceship comes through and goes out the other side, because I\nforce it to go out the other side.",
        "Q: And the images themselves, are -- are they -- can you discuss them at all, or is it just\ntoo difficult?",
        "A: It\u2019s hard to discuss them, because they\u2019re very unpleasant images. They\u2019re -- They\u2019re\nof something horrible happening. And I -- I -- I am -- So far, Iam very good at making\nthem go away again. So the images that come, if I\u2019m sitting and reading this and s -- and\nI get some horrible image coming through my head, it\u2019s in and out within, you know, one\nsecond. And -- And I -- And I just keep working, so -- so actually, I\u2019m quite a productive\nperson, and I have not let that bother me, except that it bothers me that it happened. You\nknow, it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s not a pleasant way to live. And I -- I hope that -- you know, our --\nI\u2019ve discussed this with our children, because -- you know, because I\u2019ve tried to explain\nto them that sometimes when I start crying, you know, I don\u2019t know what it is and it\u2019s out\nof my control and I never did this when I was younger and I hope this will not happen to\nyou and I apologize. And I think it gets diluted out. But anyway, I started telling you\nbefore that I wrote this poem after the -- the -- the Yom Kippur War, and I -- I wrote in\nthat poem that -- about how all -- all the energy and all the emotion that you put into\nbringing up a child, and then somebody can pop that child off in -- 1n one second, in a\nwar, on a highway, whatever, and I -- and -- and th -- I think most people don\u2019t -- don\u2019t\nthink about this. And I'll tell you something else that I think about very often. I learned\nthis in first grade, in PS 241. We had to memorize these little sayings. And one of the\nsayings that I had to memorize was, \u201cA coward dies a thousand times, a brave man only\nonce.\u201d I don\u2019t think a week goes by that I don\u2019t think about that, because I tell myself,\nyou know, normal people don\u2019t live this way. Normal people live their lives, they\u2019re\nhappy, they do their thing. One day something comes up, it\u2019s very bad news, they deal\nwith it and then they go on. And you\u2019re a coward, I say to myself, because you deal with\nall of these things in your imagination, a zillion times a year, you know. So -- So I die a\nthousand times, instead of just once. You know, but I mean da -- then I start asking\nquestions, well, you know, why is that? Is it all that, is it other things? And I -- And I\nthink it -- it kind of started with that whole Holocaust business and my father\u2019s\ndisappearance. But then, you know, other people do things like -- people are generally\nnot very thoughtful, and so when I came to New York, my mother was working in the\nfactory and then my f -- brother left for school and he would be away all day, even when\nhe was still going to Columbia and living at home. And so one day, I\u2019m sitting alone in\nthe house, I think I was doing homework, and a telegram arrives. Now, that was pretty\nunusual in those days. Telegram. So I open this telegram and it says, \u201cMother dead.\u201d And\nI -- I must have been eight years old, maybe nine and I did an emotional flip. Because I\ndon\u2019t know that I had ever seen a telegram before, first of all. Maybe -- Maybe I had, but\nI didn\u2019t even --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States -- United States Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum interview with Liane Reif-Lehrer. This is tape number four, side A.",
        "A: So I got this telegram, and it said, \u201cMother dead,\u201d and I didn\u2019t even notice that, you\nknow, I don\u2019t -- in these days, they probably don\u2019t do that, but in those days, th-they\nwould tape these little things on, and I didn\u2019t even notice that there was a name on the bo\n-- you know, two lines down, that somebody had glued on. I mean, I just read those\nwords, mother dead, and I just assumed that 1t was my mother. And I don\u2019t remember\nhow I resolved this. I might have gone to a neighbor\u2019s house or something, or -- or maybe\nI just finally noticed the thing, but I -- I mean, I was a basket case for awhile there. And\nthen I -- I guess the other thing which didn\u2019t help was that my mother -- after I was born,\nmy mother had gall bladder problems and in those days gall bladder surgery was not\ntrivial. And then the war came anyway, so she lived for 30 years with this gall bladder.\nAnd she would have these attacks and sometimes an ambulance would come. But she\nwould look -- I mean -- and especially after my brother left, and I was alone, you know, I\nwould be absolutely terrified, because here I was, this little girl all by myself and my only\n-- my -- my only means of survival was this woman. And she would get these horrendous\nattacks, which our son was just getting, recently. But anyway, that\u2019s a whole other story,\nbut anyway, so -- so I think I -- I lived -- I lived in a kind of -- I mean, again, I wasn\u2019t\naware of it all the time, but when it happened, it was so scary. You know, that, oh my\nGod, 1s this g -- the end of this, and I\u2019m going -- you know, I\u2019m going to end up all by\nmyself, and wa -- what do I do? You know, what do you -- and I mean, I think a nine year\nold in 1999, who\u2019s watched a lot of television, might be able to say, \u201cOh, well that\u2019s all\nright, you know, Ill go work as a cashier, or do something.\u201d But there was no television\nand I, from the reading that I did, I had no -- you know, I had no recourse in my head of\nwhat -- what do you do if you end up all by yourself as a little girl? So that was another\nthing that was pretty scary.",
        "Q: You know, y-you -- you mentioned before, and -- and I just -- 1t reminded me when\nyou talked about the telegram, was just the -- the legacy -- I\u2019m just wondering about the\nlegacy of this blue letter that came, the blue envelope. Is it something that also you think\nabout a lot?",
        "A: I -- I wouldn\u2019t say I think about it a lot, but I do think about it from time to time. My\nmother was sort of in a state of shock when she read this. It was one of those -- I think it\nwas one of those air-o-gram things, you know, and it detailed -- it was horrible, and then\nmy mother read it to me.",
        "Q: What -- What do you remember from that?",
        "A: What I remember is it was written by a cousin of -- of hers, I think. I think 1t was\nwritten by a guy names Moshe -- Moshe what? I don\u2019t remember. Moshe -- I don\u2019t\nremember, but anyway, he ultimately moved to Israel. And he detailed what happened to\nall my mother\u2019s relatives, and so my mother was reading this to me, about how her sister\nhad been forced to watch, while they threw her children into an oven, and then they shot\nher. And my mother\u2019s brother had, I think three children. I think my mother\u2019s sister\nmaybe had two children. I think the brother might have had three children, and that they -\n- there was somebody in the concentration camp where they were, who had typhoid or\ntyphus, one -- one of those two bad diseases, and that a lot of people in the camp were\nsnuggling up to these people, so that they would c-contract the disease and be able to die\nof a disease, rather than what was obviously going to happen. And -- And so that\u2019s how\nthose people met their end. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t remember -- I don\u2019t think he detailed, except\nthat my mother\u2019s parents were killed, but -- in a concentration camp, but I don\u2019t think he\nknew. I don\u2019t remember exactly what happened to them. But he -- you know, he went\nthrough this litany of what happened to everybody that she knew. And I -- I do think\nabout that. I mean, I think about that, as I say, not so often, but when I do think about it, I\nthink, you know, \u201cH-How could she have stood that?\u201d I mean, can you imagine? I mean,\nmy brother is now 72, I guess, or -- let\u2019s see, I\u2019m going to be 65, so he\u2019s 72 and a half, or\nalmost 72 and a half, and well, this is another thing, I mean this is another abnormal thing\nthat I have always lived with, and that 1s -- I wrote about this in -- in an article I wrote for\nthe -- for Boston Magazine in 1988. When I say good-bye to somebody, that is rarely an\neasy thing, because there is always this thing -- and I remember when my brother used to\nvisit, cause I -- I really -- I was very, very close to my brother. Whenever I saw him off at\nthe airport, and he\u2019d go through that door, onto the airplane, there\u2019s always that thought,\nis this the last time? You know, and now, I mean, he\u2019s getting older, and-- and every time\nI go away or I do something, I -- although I feel -- I feel more equipped to cope with it\nnow. I mean, I -- now, I-I think, \u201cOh, I\u2019m 65, you know. I could go any day, my husband\ncould go any day, and my brother could certainly go any day,\u201d and you know, and I -- it\u2019s\nstill very scary, but it\u2019s not as scary as it was when I was younger. But every time I --\nthere\u2019s always that thought, you know, is this the last time I\u2019m talking to this person? Is\nthis the last time I\u2019m seeing this person? And I\u2019m sure that has -- has got to go back to --\nto what happened with my father, you know? I mean, a --",
        "Q: And all -- And all these other relatives, as well, from this letter, I m -- I imagine.",
        "A: Yeah, but I think it was more my father, of -- you know, and so I think, \u201cWell, how\ncould my mother stand?\u201d I mean, I don\u2019t know whether she was close to her brothers and\nsisters, but you know, you -- it was kind of a reasonably close knit family, and -- and so,\nhow could she stand listening? You know, I mean, even when I repeat, and say they held\nmy mother\u2019s sister, while they threw her children into an oven. I mean, you know, foof.\nYou know, even just when I repeat that, or think it to myself -- I mean, that is a -- a kind\nof unfathomable thought. So -- So when I -- I mean I -- you know, it just totally gorks me\nout when I -- when I think about that letter. And again -- and then I\u2019m also bothered that,\nwhy don\u2019t I have that letter? Where did that letter go? That letter -- That letter might be\nsomewhere even in this house, although I don\u2019t know. You know, when my mother got\nAlzheimer\u2019s, she started throwing out things and writing over things and so on. So I -- I\ndon\u2019t know. But where did that letter go? I\u2019d like to see that letter again. And I don\u2019t\nknow if I ever will find it. But --",
        "Q: Well, you\u2019ve also written in -- in some of the stuff that I was reading, different articles\nin -- in the Boston Globe pieces, ab-about the idea of -- of making up for others.

That\nyou\u2019re living life for -- for -- for those who -- that -- that you have an extra responsibility,\nan extra burden? Do -- Do you have that with you?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I think about that every day, but -- but yeah, when I think about it and\nwhen I have to write, or when I\u2019m thinking about something about the past. I mean, I do\nfeel that I have to pack a lot into every day. I -- I\u2019m just -- I\u2019m just now starting to even\nthink about, I wonder what it would be like to retire, you know? And -- And I\u2019m just\nstarting to think -- for example, last week I felt a cold coming on, and of course, when I\nwas a kid, you know, if -- 1f you remember from the -- from the -- the video interview,\nmy mother would say, \u201cStay home.\u201d And my brother would say, \u201cTake two hankies and\ngo to school.\u201d",
        "Q: You can dry one out.",
        "A: Right. And so all my life, I have -- I -- it -- colds get less as you get older, thank\ngoodness, but I get really bad colds. I don\u2019t feel so bad, but I look awful. My eyes are --\nyou know, are like buckets and my nose and it gets red and horrible and these -- the\nwonderful invention of lanolin tissues has helped a lot, but -- but I -- I yust, you know,\nI\u2019m -- my head is just so rrrrr. And a few years ago, one day, I -- I -- I got a cold and I\njust discovered that if -- if I -- if I keep working, but I\u2019m staying in a prone posi -- ina\nreclining position, horizontal position, that it\u2019s not so bad. And so I spent two whole days\nworking in this chair that we just bought for my back, actually, but where I can be lying\ndown and still be reading and writing at the same time. And then the cold really doesn\u2019t\nbother me at all, you know. And -- And also -- I mean, usually, all my life, \u2019ve worked,\nyou know, most days, most evenings, a lot on weekends. Not that we don\u2019t take time off\nto have -- you know, to do nice things, mind you, but -- but when I\u2019m not doing\nsomething specifically, I\u2019m working. And now, in these last six months, with my son, I\nmean, we\u2019ve been watching a movie like practically every night. And it\u2019s not necessarily\na thoughtful movie, because he -- it turns out he has Crohn\u2019s disease and so we try to find\ncomedies. And sometimes they\u2019re re -- they\u2019re ki -- I mean, we try to find good\ncomedies, but sometimes we\u2019ve been watching things that are kind of stupid, just to kind\nof keep his mind occupied, and -- and -- and we sit next to him. So we\u2019ve been working\nless hard during that time, and I -- I\u2019m just suddenly thinking, you know, I don\u2019t -- except\non a summer vacation or something, I don\u2019t take enough time to smell the flowers. And\nthat\u2019s not really true, because I really do. I mean, I -- I\u2019m very aware when those lilies\ncome out, that I\u2019ve got to go smell those. And I -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m all -- I\u2019m extremely aware of\nthe passage of time. There\u2019s a -- There\u2019s a wonderful poem by A. E. Housman, called,\n\u201cWhen I was One and Twenty,\u201d in which he says, \u201cand since to look at things in bloom,\n50 springs are little room, about the woodland I will go, to see the cherry hung with\nsnow.\u201d So I\u2019m always aware that, you know, when the snow is freshly fallen, I have to go\nand look at it and touch it, and -- but I don\u2019t spend a lot of time just sitting down and\ncontemplating. Now, I think that\u2019s because I\u2019m busy leading a lot of different lives, and\ntrying to accomplish a lot of different things. But sometimes, I also ask myself, maybe\nI\u2019m rushing around and doing all th-these things that keep me busy, because if I just sat in\na grassy field and allowed myself to just free associate, maybe -- I would spend a little\ntime having some wonderful daydreams, but then maybe some of the nightmares would\nstart creeping in and that maybe wouldn\u2019t be -- I -- I don\u2019t know, I mean I -- that\u2019s just\nconjectural.",
        "Q: Di -- I was going to ask you whether -- either in daydreams, or -- or in -- or night -- at\nnight, d-do you have flashbacks? Do you have dreams that either have recurred or that --\nthat are disturbingly resonant of -- of that really traumatic past of yours?",
        "A: [hardly ever dream, and when I do dream, I feel totally unrested in the morning. I\nmean, I know everybody dreams, but what I\u2019m trying to tell you 1s, I\u2019m not aware that I\ndream. When I have dreamt, it\u2019s almost always in black and white. I\u2019ve only ha -- as far\nas I know, I\u2019ve only had one Technicolor dream in my life, and it was -- 1t was a very\nscary dream, of somebody running after me. My husband tells me that I sometimes seem\nto be dreaming at night and - -and you know, wince or cry or something, you know. But\nI\u2019m -- I\u2019m usually unaware of it in the morning. So I don\u2019t dream very much, and that\u2019s --\nI think that\u2019s been an incredible blessing, is my fantastically wonderful sleep habits.\nBecause I -- I -- I really get a lot out of my sleep. I don\u2019t sleep a lot of hours.",
        "Q: How many hours?",
        "A: I\u2019ve actually been sleeping more lately, but I think throughout my life, I probably\ndon\u2019t often sleep more than six hours. I mean, I tend to go to sleep quite late, and I\u2019m\nusually up by somewhere between 7:30 and eight. And sometimes if a client gives me\nsomething to do, or if I have something to do -- now that\u2019s something that\u2019s changed\nrecently. I used to stay up until, you know, like five in the morning, that wa -- not\nuncommonly, and still get up, but -- and in the last maybe five years or so, my husband\nhas started going to sleep, sort of between midnight and one. And unless I -- I have to do\nsomething, I start to get this uncomfortable feeling. I'll be sitting at my computer, and\nhe\u2019ll come down and kiss me goodnight, and go up to bed and -- and I used to just say\nokay, and -- you know, and then -- I -- and then I\u2019d get right back into it, and keep going.\nAnd now, there\u2019s something that happens, and I -- I actually feel a little irritated at people\naround me for this, but I start to feel, oh, I\u2019m too old to do this. I -- I -- I better get -- I\nbetter go up and go to sleep. And I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really anything that\u2019s\nchanged physiologically, but I think it\u2019s hearing people constantly say, \u201cWhat? You go to\nsleep at two o\u2019clock in the morning? I\u2019m in bed by nine o\u2019clock at night.\u201d You know, and\nI -- I think it\u2019s like that -- the -- the economics guy at Harvard, the tall -- Galbraith wrote\nan article in the newspaper about something he called the still syndrome. He says, you\nknow, part of the reason that you age is that as you get on in life, people keep asking,\n\u201cOh, do you still walk? Do you still run?\u201d And if you look at a pretty woman, \u201cOh, are\nyou still interested?\u201d And he calls that the still syndrome. And I feel a little as though I\u2019m\nmaybe getting victimized a little, by other people telling me that I should no longer be\ndoing what I\u2019m doing, and that maybe it\u2019s somehow getting to me, because by and large,\nI\u2019m usually in bed by one o\u2019clock and -- and I turn off the light by, you know, 1:30 or --\nor something. And -- And I don\u2019t stay up m-much later than that, unless there\u2019s a\npressure.",
        "Q: That seems like really late to me, I\u2019m usually in bed by 10 o\u2019clock.",
        "A: No, no, I know, but the thing is that I\u2019m not --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- you know, and I -- I -- I never needed a lot of sleep and I\u2019m generally quite perky.\nAnd I think there is something that the society and the people around me are doing to me\nthat\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- maybe that\u2019s a rationalization, I don\u2019t know, but --",
        "Q: You know, I wanted to ask you just -- you mentioned in a couple of the articles that\nyou\u2019re working on a book. Is that -- Is that still in process? Is that -- I don\u2019t mean to use\nthe still word. Is that something that you\u2019ve finished or is that something that you\u2019re still\nworking on, is what I mean.",
        "A: I\u2019m still working on it, but first of all, I don\u2019t have a lot of time, and I -- for example,\nyou know, I really thought somehow, that I was going to maybe slow down on my work\nwork life and pay more attention to this, and then this thing came up with our son. And so\nnow, I\u2019m doing even less work work. There are a couple of things that have happened\nwith that project. First of all, I\u2019m very success oriented, and I\u2019m -- I didn\u2019t try very hard,\nbut I made a couple of stabs some years ago, at finding a publisher, and I didn\u2019t find a\npublisher, and that got me to put the project on the back burner. I know myself well\nenough to know that if I got a publisher tomorrow, I\u2019d be in there working til five o\u2019clock\nin the morning. I mean, I -- I -- I know that. So that was one thing that happened. The\nsecond thing that happened was that I -- maybe my project was overly ambitious to begin\nwith, and about a year before, Simon Shallma, who was a history professor at Harvard,\nwho moved to Columbia, I had a meeting with him, because h-he -- when he was in high\nschool, he had written an article for the London Times, when he was living in England,\nabout the San Louis, and -- and he gave a talk at our library and I started to talk to him\nand I asked him if I could meet with him, and I told him about what I was trying to do\nwith my San Louis book. And he made some very interesting suggestions for paring\ndown the project. So then I kind of rethought the project and decided that he was right,\nthat I couldn\u2019t do -- I mean, my original project was to try to incorporate stories from --\nthat I'd collected from 40 people and that\u2019s not going to fly. He suggested that I pick five\nto seven stories and -- and that I put my chapter about the reunion, which I had coming at\nthe end, that I should put it up at the front, and he made a lot of interesting suggestions.",
        "Q: Yeah, they do sound interesting.",
        "A: But then I st -- I was working on my brother\u2019s chapter, because -- and I had\ninterviewed my brother, my brother did not want to do -- write his own chapter. So I\ninterviewed him several times, and I wrote a chapter for him, which I sent to him. This is\nonly now like maybe a year ago that I finished that chapter. My brother was very\ndisturbed to find that I had written his chapter in the first person, as though he was\nwriting it. And he said I couldn\u2019t -- h-he didn\u2019t feel good about that, that I couldn\u2019t really\ndo that. So, then I started trying to rethink. So, I\u2019m going to write his chapter third\nperson. And then, somehow, that didn\u2019t seem right. And so, my chapter is going to be the\nlongest chapter in the book, cause it\u2019s going to contain a lot of stuff that I\u2019m telling you.\nAnd then my brother\u2019s chapter was going to be the other long chapter, but now I am in\nthe process of maybe rethinking the whole thing again. I think maybe I\u2019m going to\nincorporate my brother\u2019s interview into a story that I tell.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And that has caused me now to think about maybe this book is not going to be about\nanybody but us, but then the question arises, what do I do with, for example, there\u2019s a\nchapter of a woman down in New Jersey, who -- which 1s already finished, signed, sealed\nand delivered. She wrote it, I edited it, I got permission letter from her to publish it.\nThat\u2019s the one bit of complete thing I have. Am I letting those people down? I guess\nthere\u2019s a -- I guess I have an overactive conscience and I\u2019m always sort of worried about\nletting down. And this guy, who organized the reunion, he s -- he stupidly sent me a lot of\nstuff and didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t even register it or anything, and all his original pictures got lost,\nand -- and he has called upteen times over the years, \u201cOkay, when is your book coming\nout,\u201d and so on and so forth. Okay, so that\u2019s one side of the story. So now, I don\u2019t know\nwhat to do with this and my current thought is maybe -- maybe I\u2019m going to either follow\nSimon Shellma\u2019s idea partly, or maybe this book is going to be just about us, and the rest\nis going to the Holocaust museum.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: All those two huge boxes I have of notes and pictures and so on. But something else\nhappened in the interim. About in what must have been, I don\u2019t know, maybe 1990 or\nsomething, we used to go to an island in Maine every summer, for a few weeks. And so\non this one summer, we were going to this island, and I thought to myself, maybe we\nshould do some constructive family project this year. Let\u2019s write a fictional story, all\ntogether. So, we got up to Maine and I said, \u201cOkay, so you know, we\u2019re all going to sit\ndown and we\u2019re going to write this story,\u201d sort of like that game that you play, you know,\nyou write and -- except that we\u2019re going to know, and we\u2019re going to -- now this was not\nan original idea. I got this idea because there was a medical doctor that I heard give a\ntalk, and he wrote a best seller called \u201cThe Sisterhood.\u201d And he gave a talk at a meeting,\nand he talked about how he wrote this book, but he wrote it with the help from a lot of his\nfriends. And he told this whole very funny story, which I\u2019m not going to go into, but\nthat\u2019s where I got this idea of doing this joint project. Well, my husband was not terribly\nexcited about this project. Our son, who has been drawing since age two and now paints,\nreally wanted to paint, and our daughter likes to go and fetch sea animals out of the sea\nand then throw them back, when she\u2019s in Maine, and she was not at all enthused about\nthis writing project. So, the first day, I was really feeling very sour grapesy on this\nvacation, about, you know, oh, I had this great idea and we could, you know, we could\nwrite this great story and maybe it could even get published, and so we went off to sit on\n-- a-at the ocean, on the rocks in Monheegan, and my husband was drawing, my son was\ndrawing, Erica was fishing stuff out of the sea and I\u2019m sitting there with a pad and pencil,\nlooking, you know, forlorn and angry or something. And suddenly this idea for a story\npopped into my head. And I started writing down this story, all by myself. And when we\ncame home from Maine, I was gung-ho involved in this story like I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been\ninvolved in too many things before. And I didn\u2019t have a lot of work to do that summer, so\nthe whole summer, the kids were off doing their own things, my husband left for work in\nthe morning, I was already working out of the house by then. The whole -- almost the\nwhole rest of the summer, I sat in front of my computer from the minute Sam left, until\nthe time he came home, essentially, and I wrote this story, which turned out to be, I don\u2019t\nknow, 333 double spaced pages. Totally fictional story, but has bits and pieces of things\nthat happened. It starts out in the Holocaust, and etcetera. And I thought it was kind of a -\n-a good story. And I -- The thing that -- that I found very bizarre was that while I was\nsitting at my computer, writing this story, I found myself laughing and crying. And I\nwould stop myself and say, \u201cWhat are you doing, Liane, you\u2019re making all this up, why\nare you laughing and why are you crying?\u201d And I was just incredibly involved in this\nstory. So, I finished writing this story, and then I thought, well, I should send it 0 -- I -- I\nshould see if I could get this published, because I thought it was certainly better than -- I -\n- I sort of thought of it like an hour and a half television script, and I thought, you know, I\nthink this is better than a lot of things I\u2019ve seen, I ought to be able to get this published.\nSo, first I called Ann Bernaise, who had been a Barnard graduate, and who lives in\nCambridge and who\u2019s published a lot of books.",
        "Q: I know her, yeah.",
        "A: And she gave me the name of her agent, and I called the agent and the agent said to\nme, \u201cIs this a literary s -- novel?\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, this 1s not a literary novel, this is just a\nfun story, a good story.\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t deal in things that are not literary\nnovels.\u201d So, all right, so that --",
        "Q: Dear me.",
        "A: So that was the end of that. So anyway, then I don\u2019t know, I tried a couple of other\npeople, they -- they -- people that I knew. [indecipherable] I -- I didn\u2019t feel I was getting a\nlot of enthusiasm. One day I got a telephone call from a guy who was working at PBS, he\nwants to come and interview me. Okay, so he came and interviewed me and I said, \u201cYou\nknow, I have a favor to ask, but please don\u2019t do it unless, you know, th-this is something\nthat -- that would really be of interest.\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cYou know, you work for television, I -- I\nwrote this story, I think it would make a good hour and a half TV thing, I wonder if you\u2019d\nbe willing to read it?\u201d He said, \u201cSure, but right now I\u2019m very busy.\u201d I tried to call him\nabout six or seven times in the next year and he was always very busy. So I thought, ah\nhe -- you know, he\u2019s not really interested. A few years later, one day, I was about to\nleave, I think for Europe the next day, I get a phone call from this guy. He says, \u201cOkay,\nI\u2019m getting married in 10 days, my wife is studying for her bar exams, I can read your --\nFedex me your manuscript, I can read it in the next 10 days.\u201d So, I was kind of amazed\nand I -- I Fedexed this thing off to him, and he then -- when -- when I -- when we both\ngot -- when I got back from my trip, and he got back from his honeymoon or something,\nhe spent an hour and a half on the phone with me, telling me what he thought was good\nand bad about this script. And so I tried to incorporate some of his suggestions into the --\ninto this manuscript, and I -- I -- I did a fair amount of additional work on it, and then\nsomebody gave me the name of an agent. My memory these days 1s -- is terrible. Well, it\ndoesn\u2019t matter, but anyway, it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a -- the mother had gone to Barnard College, the\ndaughter I once tutored in algebra when she was a kid and we went on vacation together.\nAnd this girl has n -- this woman has now written a couple of successful novels, so she\ngave me the name of her agent. And I sent this off to this agent, and this agent said --\nwrote me a letter and said something like, this 1s a good story idea, but there\u2019s too much\ntelling, and not enough showing. And that\u2019s a phrase I\u2019ve heard, you know, a zillion\ntimes from people who write. Well, I was busy and I was discouraged and so I just kind\nof put that thing aside. And then, about three years ago, I finally -- I had been trying to\ntake a course in writing and I took a course -- a 10 week course with some woman in\nCambridge, you know one night a week, for three hours or something, in writing -- in\nmemoir writing, and not working on that thing, which was not really a memoir, but a\nnovel, but because I thought it would help me write the San Louis book. And I did learn a\nlot, but that was only three years ago, and I\u2019ve just been unbelievably busy since then,\nand somehow, I -- I know --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nLiane Reif-Lehrer. This is tape number four, side B.",
        "A: I know that I need to be working on the San Louis book. And, you know -- And my\nhusband is now getting into the act. Every week he says, \u201cAll right, when are you\nfinishing your book?\u201d And I really -- I really want to finish it, not just because I want to\nfinish it, but there\u2019s something that tells me it is my obligation to write this thing. I --\nThat I have a moral, or ethical, or whatever you want to call it, thing, that I must do this.\nAnd sometimes I get nervous, cause I say, \u201cOh my God, the years are passing, you know,\nyou could die tomorrow, and you will not have finished this book, and you will have --\nhave not fulfilled your obligation.\u201d But, there is something inside of me that wants to see\nthis novel get published, or aired or something. Why? I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know why,\nbecause I put -- I think it\u2019s just because -- beca -- I put so much of my emotional self into\nwriting that bloody thing, and I think it is sort of a good story. I think it\u2019s a story that\nyoung people could learn from, but may not understand, because -- because I write in it a\nlot about the morays of the 1950\u2019s, you know, and -- and that kind of stuff. And the --\nAnd I -- You know, and I sort of can imagine that some kid who\u2019s 20 years old now,\nwould read this and say, \u201cHuh?\u201d You know, \u201cI-Is this some kind of thing from the middle\nages or something?\u201d But it\u2019s not from the middle ages, that\u2019s really the way things were\nin my world, in 1950. But it\u2019s also -- it\u2019s also kind of funny and -- and -- and -- and\nwhimsical and tragic and you know, an-and -- and I -- I really do think it\u2019s a good story\nand I think it\u2019s a lot better than a lot of things I hear. But -- So -- So -- So every time I\nthink, \u201cOh well, you know, tomorrow, if I have a couple of hours, Pll work on the San\nLouis book,\u201d then something says, \u201cOh, maybe you should just try to make this novel\nbetter first.\u201d And then I wonder, maybe there\u2019s something I don\u2019t understand about show\nme versus tell me. I mean, I\u2019ve learned that, I\u2019ve learned it in classes, but maybe there\u2019s\nsomething internally that I don\u2019t understand enough about that concept, you know. And\nthen I think, \u201cWell maybe I should get help with this,\u201d but then -- then I don\u2019t like that\nidea, because that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s like finking out, or you know. And I shouldn\u2019t say\nthat, because I help people write their grant proposals, that\u2019s how I make the major part\nof my income now, you know, and -- and that\u2019s fine, they just don\u2019t know how to write it,\nand I\u2019m teaching them how to do it. But yet, I can\u2019t accept that, at least not for this thing.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know where these are going to go. I mean, you\nknow, maybe I'll get hit by a truck tomorrow and then -- and this will get buried with me,\nor -- or you know, I mean, one of the things that I worry about with my son\u2019s art, 1s it\u2019s so\nhard getting ahead in the world of art, and -- and -- you know, and I think he\u2019s really\nquite good and he has -- in the last few years, three of his paintings have been sold by\ngalleries, for about 10 grand each. [phone ringing] So -- So I don\u2019t -- I -- I don\u2019t quite\nknow -- I don\u2019t quite know how to deal with this, because I really -- I really want to get\nthese -- I want to see these two things published, if it\u2019s the last thing that I do. But I can\u2019t\nsto -- you know, some days I\u2019ve even thought, \u201cWell, you know, I\u2019m si -- I\u2019m going to be\n65, maybe I should retire, and maybe I should just work on this other stuff.\u201d But how can\nI retire when I\u2019ve got a son who\u2019s an artist, who really -- you know, the gallery keeps 50\npercent, so it sounds great, he sol -- sold a painting for 10 grand. But how much of that\ndoes he get? Five. He\u2019s done three of -- of those projects in the last three years. So how\ndo you live on that? You can\u2019t. I mean, basically, we\u2019re supporting him, to a large extent.\nI mean, he has m -- you know, he does sell a bunch of other things in the meantime, so --\nso he\u2019s -- he\u2019s kind of starting to come into his own, but he\u2019s not quite there yet. How can\nI stop working, you know, in -- in -- in this situation. I mean, our daughter is essentially\nnow 99 percent financially independent. She -- Sh -- You know, I taught her how to write\ngrant proposals, she got every grant in the -- that was available. She --",
        "Q: What does she do?",
        "A: She\u2019s an anthropology graduate student.",
        "Q: Oh, you mentioned that, yeah.",
        "A: And she -- she\u2019s doing her field work in Poland now, but she went to Israel to see\nsome people and to do some interviews. So I don\u2019t worry as much about her financially,\nbut I still worry a lot about our son, financially and now that he\u2019s sick, and Crohn\u2019s is a --\na chronic kind of disease, you know, he -- it could never happen again, or he could get it\nevery three months or something. So how can I possibly stop working for income? You\nknow, so -- so ha -- and now, I mean I\u2019m -- I\u2019m ha -- tied up with him half the time, you\nknow, doing things for him. He rented an apartment three months ago, he\u2019s been paying\nthe rent, and he can\u2019t move in. Now, he\u2019s going to have another surgery on July 20\",\nbecause -- because they put him on this IV feed, and it caused his gall bladder to -- you\nknow, and why didn\u2019t they tell me about that, and rrrrr. But anyway.",
        "Q: Geez.",
        "A: So -- You know, so I don\u2019t know. I mean I -- You know, and then -- and then my\nhusband had -- turned out to have prostate cancer, and I think he\u2019s all right, but then it --\nit rees -- he had his prostate out, it resurfaced and -- and the -- the -- I brought Damon\nhome from England after two surgeries, on November 14\", which was my birthday. On\nNovember 16\", my husband started seven weeks of radiation therapy. And he seems to be\nall right, but, you know, what does all right mean? I mean, this could pop up again, you\nknow, who knows?",
        "Q: It\u2019s --",
        "A: Maybe never, maybe sometimes. You know, how can I take time off to do this other\nthing, which is sort of frivolous, you know? Am I really a writer? No, I\u2019m not really a\nwriter, I\u2019m really kind of a scientist. So, can I -- You know, and I -- and I don\u2019t like doing\nthings that are not successful. I don\u2019t do well doing projects that don\u2019t succeed. For\nexample, when I was a kid, I was -- I joined botanic garden club, I had my six foot six\npot, I went every morning and I hoed and weeded and everything, and I got all these\nvegetables to take home to my mother. And that was wonderful. Now, do I even want to\ngo out and plant a single bulb? No. Because that\u2019s not my thing, that\u2019s not going to bring\nme recognition or success. That\u2019s not going to make my children happy, that\u2019s not going\nto -- you know. I -- I\u2019m -- For better or worse, and you can criticize this, but I -- I\u2019m very\ngoal oriented. So, if somebody came and said, \u201cLiane, this is a terrific idea, all it needs is\n-- is a year of your working on it,\u201d I could conceivably drop half of what I\u2019m doing and\nsay, \u201cOh, wow, okay, this is going to get published. I\u2019m going to make this thing work.\u201d\nBut the -- You know, and I sh -- I shouldn\u2019t do this, cause I tell people, you know, \u201cIf --\nIf at first you don\u2019t succeed, try, try and again.\u201d You don\u2019t get your grant funded the first\ntime, you have to do it twice, three times, you know. Some people have to write eight\nbefore they get one funded. But for -- for -- And I will do that with a grant application,\nalthough I never had to do that. I mean, I always got funded, either the first time, or in\none case, maybe the second time. I\u2019m not sure I even had to ever rewrite, maybe once.\nBut -- But you know, I am accustomed to being successful at the things that I\u2019m good at,\nand | -- you know, s -- you know, this one woman who finally had a book of poetry\npublished, she\u2019s a professor at BU, she said she wrote a hundred letters to publishers,\nbefore her book of poetry got published by a really good poetry press, University of\nPittsburgh. And I -- Okay, yes, I know all about that, you know, but I don\u2019t have time to\ndo that, with everything else that\u2019s going on. And -- I mean I know that\u2019s s -- that sounds\nlike a spoiled brat, but I really -- I -- I want somebody to appear and say, \u201cOkay, this is a\n-- this is good, we just have to fix this and that,\u201d you know, let\u2019s -- if I -- you know, and\nth -- and then with the -- with the San Louis book, there\u2019s this other problem, and that is\nthat book, especially if I use Simon Shallma\u2019s idea, which I may or may not go back to,\npeople have sent me pictures, documents, wonderful things. Those need to be in that\nbook, and yet the publishing industry tells me, you know it\u2019s really in-incredibly\nexpensive to publish a well illustrated book. We\u2019re -- We\u2019re not going to do that. B-By\nthe way, I want to show you something else. That -- That book is highly illustrated, but\nthe book is a mess. The guy did a miserable job. It\u2019s so -- The pictures are poor quality,\nit\u2019s full of typos.",
        "Q: The -- Which book are you talking about?",
        "A: This is a book that was -- that origina -- this is a book that changed my life around. It\ncame out, I think, in 1974, called \u201cVoyage of the Damned,\u201d by Thomas Gordon and Max\nMorganwitz, about the San Louis. Somewhat fictionalized story. I disco -- I -- One night,\nmy husband and I were looking in the New York Times magazine, and there was a\nreview, I think, of -- of this book, or maybe it was the book review. I went out and bought\nthat book. I was extremely disturbed, and something funny happened. I read that book,\nand then I immediately forgot a lot of what it said. And I know -- And then I read it\nagain, and the same thing happened, and I -- I kept thinking, the voyage of the damned,\nthe damned, the damned. That\u2019s me they\u2019re talking about. That was sort of a really\nhorrifying thing, you know, to be referred to that way.",
        "Q: Did you ever think of yourself that way?",
        "A: Well, I never had, until this book came out, you know, and then I thought, \u201cOh my\nGod, that\u2019s me. That title is about me, and all these other people who were on the ship.\u201d\nSo, anyway, I ca -- I -- a-at -- at some point, I actually contacted the authors and -- and\nthen many years later, I got contacted by this guy, I don\u2019t even remember the name,\nDavid -- David something or other. It\u2019s on -- on my computer, who decided he was going\nto re-issue the \u201cVoyage of the Damned,\u201d in a highly illustrated form, and he asked me for\na lot of photographs, which I sent. So this new book came out, maybe about 1994, or\nsomething. Lot of pictures, a lot of pictures and there\u2019s a -- he had cameos, two page\ncameos of different families, and there\u2019s one of me and my family, and you know, my\nfather with me in a stroller, and all sorts of pictures. So I -- I want my book, if I -- if I put\nother people\u2019s stories into it, or even if it\u2019s just mine, I want it to have all those\ndocuments, you know, I have all these documents. I\u2019ve got a wonderful document\ndownstairs, that -- that -- that my father got. My father fought, as a young man, in the\nAustrian war, 1n World War One, and if he had lived, and come to the United States, he\nwould have fought on the opposite side in World War Two, and that in itself is crazy.\nYou go and you fight people and kill people, and it\u2019s purely -- it has nothing to do, often,\nmost of the time, with your philosophy. It has to do with where you happen to be born, or\nwhere you happen to be living. Does that make any sense? No. And so I have this\ndocument that -- that very picturesque document that my father got, cause he was actually\nwounded during the first war. And I\u2019ve got lots of wonderful -- you know, I\u2019ve got this\nthing that my father had to sign, saying that he wouldn\u2019t practice any more. I\u2019ve got\ndocuments from Poland, I\u2019ve got my parents marriage license, you know, all these things\nthat should go into this book, but everybody tells me, well the more you want to illustrate\nit, the less is the chance that you\u2019re ever going to get this published. So that\u2019s another\nkind of a downer.",
        "Q: Maybe if -- if you could publish it with an organization that has an interest in -- in\nseeing the story come out, maybe that\u2019s [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, I\u2019ve called the Holocaust museum, and there is a guy, whose name I don\u2019t\nremember, that I spoke to, who\u2019s 1n charge of -- because they do publish some books, and\nhe didn\u2019t make it sound very promising. But see, I -- I guess -- I mean this 1s probably not\na nice quality that I have, but -- but I\u2019m -- I\u2019m s -- I\u2019m sic -- well, I\u2019m success oriented, so\nI would be satisfied if the book could just get published, but I would be not happy if I had\nto do a vanity publishing. You know, a lot of people that I know -- I belong to this\nsurvivor\u2019s group, and a lot of those people -- well, not a lot, several of those people have\npublished books. And you know, they print -- I don\u2019t know, a hundred copies, it cost\nthem 8,000 dollars, looks like a nice book. People who are ignorant of the publishing\nindustry are not aware that they p-paid to have it published, you know, and just looks as\nthough they wrote this book. That doesn\u2019t sit right with me. I don\u2019t want to pay to have\nmy book published, because if I pay to have my book published, it could be crap. You\nknow, if I publish a book -- which I have published three books about proposal writing,\nit\u2019s because I did it well, it\u2019s a good job. Those books have been well received, well\nreviewed. You know, it\u2019s something of quality. So -- So if I -- if I get my novel\npublished, I don\u2019t want to self publish that, I want it to be published and I want it to get a\nreasonably good write up. You know, not everybody has to love it, but I want it to be\nsomething that somebody\u2019s willing to do, cause they think it\u2019s worth publishing. So -- So\nanyway, here I am and -- and right now, what am I going to do between now and -- I\nmean, when -- when does my hus -- when does my son get to move into his own\napartment and be on his own again? You know, I mean, in other words, when can I get\nback to being 100 percent me again, whatever that means. So, whenever that happens, if\nI\u2019m still around and kicking and haven\u2019t gotten Alzheimer\u2019s disease yet, that\u2019s when I\u2019m\ngoing to make the next big move on, I hope, both of these projects, or maybe one will\ntake precedence. I -- I -- I don\u2019t know. So I f -- I feel that I owe it to somebody, not just\nme, who do I owe it to? I don\u2019t know, I owe it to my mother, to my father, to all those\npeople who died, that I write the story, that I write what happened. So that\u2019s an -- sort of\nan obligation. The novel part? That\u2019s just an obligation to myself. I don\u2019t -- Why, I don\u2019t\nknow, maybe just to prove that I can do this other thing, I -- I -- I\u2019m not sure. But -- But\nanyway, so I have these two sort of big projects to do, and in the meantime, you know, I\nlook around me, like this morn -- I mean, I already warned you what our house looks like,\nbut this morning, I came down and I looked at our house and I thought, \u201cOh my God,\nthere is no way, even if I could spend full time for three months with my husband, there\nis no way that we can this place back into order.\u201d\u2019 You know, I mean, here\u2019s my son\u2019s\nlittle -- a tentative, you know, at home studio. There\u2019s the little hospital under the table.\nYou know, here\u2019s this project that I\u2019m doing for that. You know, it -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s like a\nshambles and -- you know, so here I\u2019m thinking about these big projects, that really\nrequire time, and you know, and then a part of me thinks of myself as being non-\nvulnerable, and the other part of me keeps saying, \u201cYou know, Sam\u2019s been sick, your\nson\u2019s been sick, you\u2019re s -- getting to be 65 years old, what makes you think you might\nnot get sick tomorrow, and you may not be able to finish this project.\u201d So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s kind\nof a real conundrum about, you know, how 1s this going to play out, and I -- and you\u2019re\nyoung enough so that you may know the answer some day, but you know, I -- I just -- I\njust know that each day I get up and there are a list of things that I have to do, that\u2019s a\nmile long and -- and the -- the two books are kind of sitting on my back like -- like these\ntwo kind of weights that keep sort of banging at the back of my skull, but they\u2019re not all\nthat high up on the list right now. You know, I have six business trips between now and\nNovember, which, if Damon were not ill at the moment, is probably, you know, not an\nawful lot, but I -- you know, I have to do some prep work for some of those and so when\ndo I fit this thing in? I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Well, I wish you luck in -- in having -- in sorting all this out, and figuring out how to\ndo it, you know. I really hope you can.",
        "A: Well, I -- I -- You know, and -- and I\u2019m going to have to bite the bullet one of these\ndays, I mean I -- when I -- when I get around to doing this is to -- or before I get around\nto doing this is, I\u2019ve got to find a publisher, because I know that if I find a publisher,\nthat\u2019s what going to spur me on. And so that -- that really 1s the first step and that\u2019s not\nan e -- I mean, that\u2019s a really big, time consuming project.",
        "Q: Oh, I mean, I\u2019ve written four book proposals and I finally have gotten one accepted\nafter a long time. I mean, you just -- just pitching constantly.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] I\u2019m just like well, grants can be the same way.",
        "A: Oh absolutely, absolutely.",
        "Q: Just a swing and a miss for so many times.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: Well, I wanted to ask you a couple more things.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Just -- Just a few factual things, and then -- then this sort of one concluding thing and\nthen, unless you have anything else. Going back again to -- to when you\u2019re a -- a girl, and\n-- and had arrived here, were there any -- any groups, any refugee groups or -- or aid\ngroups that you all tapped into? Was that -- Was that part of your early life here?",
        "A: My mother did go to a number of different places where she got some help. Didn\u2019t\nseem to get a lot of guidance, but got some help. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know very much about\nthat. The only thing that affected me personally was my mother went to some places that\n-- that got me sent to summer camp for I think, three weeks each -- for -- for each of three\nsummers. I really hated that. I hated that with a passion. I didn\u2019t want to go away, I didn\u2019t\nwant to leave my mother. And because my mother\u2019s English was not very good, the first\ntime, I actually got sent to an all Catholic camp.",
        "Q: How was that?",
        "A: It was just a mistake, I mean, my mother didn\u2019t either ask or pick up or I -- I don\u2019t -- I\nmean, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Obviously this wasn\u2019t a Jewish organization that arranged this.",
        "A: Ob-Obviously not. And so that was -- that was a really weird experience, to the point\nwhere -- and -- and you weren\u2019t allowed to wear your own clothes. You -- It wasn\u2019t\nexactly a uniform, but you got these colorful, very bad, in bad taste, you know sunsuits or\nsomething, to wear. A-And by the way, you know this 1s -- y-you know, I ha -- I have a\nlot to say about rearing kids, cause I -- I -- that\u2019s a pet peeve, is that people don\u2019t do\nthings right with children, and I am very protective of -- of what you do and don\u2019t do to\nchildren. Wa -- Every Thursday night, at this ridiculous place, they came around with\nshot -- with a tray of shot glasses full of Milk of Magnesia, and every kid had to drink a\nshot glass of Milk of Magnesia. And the other thing was that at night, you had to get\ntucked in to your bed, and these -- I don\u2019t know whether they were maybe nuns who\ndidn\u2019t have full habits on, I don\u2019t even remember, but the -- whoever was in charge of the\ncamp would come around, and you\u2019d get tucked into bed, and they would pull the\nblanket, you know, like rrrrr, then tuck it in, so -- and you -- you basically couldn\u2019t move\naround in your bed. And so I was really traumatized at that camp. First of all, one night I\n-- | happened to wake up and one of the kids was sleepwalking, and there was a whole\ncommotion, but also, at the end of that time -- first of all, when my mother came to pick\nme up, we walked right by -- by each other and she didn\u2019t recognize me and I didn\u2019t\nrecognize her. That\u2019s pretty bizarre. The other thing was, I cried a lot when I had to go to\ncamp, every time. I really hate -- I d -- I -- you know, I really didn\u2019t want to go. The other\nthing that happened is that for the rest of my life, even now, although now I don\u2019t -- I\u2019m\nnot as apt t-to do it as -- as quickly, but for the rest of my life, in my adult life, when I\ncome into a hotel, you know, the beds are always made and they\u2019re always tucked in. Or\nif I go to somebody\u2019s house who\u2019s a bedmaker, the beds -- first thing I do, I look at a bed,\nit\u2019s made, I\u2019m about to have to get into it, the first thing I do is I go around and pull the\nsheet out from all the sides, because I cannot stand to be in a bed where the sheets are\ntucked in. You know, it\u2019s like -- 1t makes me feel as though I\u2019m in prison.",
        "Q: Confined -- Confined, yeah.",
        "A: And that\u2019s -- And that\u2019s -- I\u2019m sure that comes from that stupid camp. So --",
        "Q: So, well --",
        "A: So anyway, so that\u2019s the main help that I think I got, 1f you want to call it help, was\nbeing sent for this summer vacation.",
        "Q: So, well -- A-And -- And how about when you were raised, and -- and for that matter\nnow, I mean, did -- did your experience at all contribute to a religious identity as a Jew? I\nmean ha-have you been a devout person, are you -- do you feel secular, wh-what\u2019s your\nidentification religiously, as opposed to culturally as a Jew?",
        "A: That\u2019s a very interesting question, I -- I don\u2019t think -- first of all, I don\u2019t think I have\never been religious. My brother got Bar Mitzvahed in France and for a very short time, he\nactually became very religious. I mean, it was a matter of months, and -- and asked my\nmother to keep a kosher home, and when we got to the United States, he said ah, forget\nabout all that nonsense, you know, just --",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t keep kosher?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And you --",
        "A: My mother --",
        "Q: -- did you have a Bas Mitzvah?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: My -- My mother was very traditionally Jewish. I don\u2019t think she was -- I don\u2019t know,\nI don\u2019t think she was really religious, but she -- you know, like she lit candles, I -- I think\nshe maybe lit candles on Friday night, but I\u2019m not sure she even did that very long. She\nwould go to the Temple on the high holidays, and she would take me, my brother would\nnever come. I went along f -- I went to -- when I was in early grades, I went to religious\ninstruction on Wednesday afternoons, at the local, little synagogue, across from my\nhouse. But I did that because I got out of school an hour early, but I think 1t wasn\u2019t really\nthat, it was the -- that every kid who went got a little bag of Planter\u2019s peanuts. And I think\n-- | hate to say this, but I think I really went because of the Planter\u2019s peanuts.",
        "Q: Bald-faced bribery, huh?",
        "A: Yes, bald-faced --",
        "Q: I grew up Catholic, they had -- they had similar schemes for us.",
        "A: S-So -- So, yeah, well, Catholic, that\u2019s an -- you know, that\u2019s a whole other story. My\ndaughter had a friend who would come over here on Sundays and ask us if her mother\ncalled, to not say that she wasn\u2019t in church, you know, to -- that she could --",
        "Q: Oh yeah, yeah, that\u2019s sounds very familiar.",
        "A: And I -- And I would always say, if you\u2019re here, and your mother calls and says where\nyou are, you\u2019re here. I -- You know --",
        "Q: Can\u2019t do that.",
        "A: And -- And that\u2019s one of the things that -- that -- see, my mother was very good about\nthat. I -- I did -- I did omit errors of omission. I knew she was very worried, and so\nsometimes I didn\u2019t tell her about places that I was going, or -- or if I did something that I\nthought she would think was dangerous, or if I expected to be home at midnight, I would\ntell her that I\u2019d be home at one am. So I -- So I did fib in that way, but other than that, I\nwas very honest with my mother, and I think she was very honest with me. And that was\na big thing in our fam -- I mean, we told our kids that there was only one major, you\nknow, crime, and that was to not be honest. And that worked out very well, cause even --\nI mean, we had a bad time with our daughter\u2019s teenage rebellion, but I remember her\ncoming one day and saying, \u201cMa, I\u2019m going to tell you something, and I know you\u2019re not\ngoing to like this, but I want you to know I\u2019m going to do this anyway, I\u2019m going to this,\u201d\nshe was going to some, I don\u2019t know, rock concert or something. I\u2019m -- You know, far\naway and driving with some kids or whatever. \u201cI\u2019m going, and a -- you can\u2019t -- you\nknow, you\u2019re not going to stop me, I just want you to know that I\u2019m going.\u201d So -- So that\nwas -- that worked out well and -- and I think my mother, in contrast to a lot of other\nparents, I think my mother listened to what we said, at least most of the time. And I think\n-- You know, I go to the supermarket and you see a kid in a shopping cart, and the kid\u2019s\ntalking to the parent, and what is the mother doing? The mother\u2019s, you know, \u201cYeah, yes\nJimmy, uh-huh, uh-huh,\u201d you know, and -- and her head\u2019s obviously in another place.\nAnd I think that\u2019s really bad for kids. And even when Damon was like two years old,\nSam and I said to him, well -- he asked -- he wanted to do something and Sam and I said,\n\u201cWell, you may not do this for the following three reasons.\u201d And he looked at us and he\nsaid, \u201cYeah, but what about,\u201d and he mentioned something and Sam and I looked at each\nother, and we looked at him and we said, \u201cWell, we hadn\u2019t thought of that, that\u2019s a good\nreason. Okay, you can do that.\u201d And I -- I think there\u2019s been a lot of that, you know, I\nmean, and I have a -- a little cartoon that I keep on the refrigerator a lot of the time, that\nsays, \u201cYou'll have to excuse me, I haven\u2019t had a chance to dirty up since my parents\ncleaned.\u201d And I -- I use that in my workshops, you know, that children are not necessarily\n-- their perspective is not necessarily wrong. It may be different from yours, but it\u2019s not\nnecessarily wrong, and you ought to listen to what they say. And I think I got that from\nthose crazy, early beginnings of having to be fairly responsible, you know, at a very early\nage, and that my mother did kind of listen to what we had to say, and --",
        "Q: And do you -- do you all -- does your family now -- is your husband Jewish?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Is -- D-Do you keep high holidays now? Do you -- Do you consi -- consider yourself\ndevout, I mean, just --",
        "A: When I went to college, I had to -- th-there was a thing that said, you know, religion,\nand I wrote none. But now I usually write Jewish, it\u2019s just easier, but I -- you know, I\ndon\u2019t think I really -- I didn\u2019t -- I think, because of what happened during the war, I\ndidn\u2019t like af -- being affiliated. It\u2019s not so much that I didn\u2019t like being affiliated with\nbeing Jewish. I didn\u2019t like affiliate -- be --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nLiane Reif-Lehrer. This 1s tape number five, side A. You were talking about affiliation.",
        "A: I -- I didn\u2019t and I still don\u2019t like being affiliated with anything, because that\u2019s how\npeople say, you know, I hate the ABC\u2019s or -- so, I didn\u2019t like being affiliated with\nanything. When I got my first job after graduate school -- no, no, no. Well, first I\u2019m -- I\nmet my husband and my husband had come from a -- a -- quite a religious background, I\nmean his father was very religious. And in fact, when we got married, his father came\nover to me and said, you know, \u201cWould -- Would you consider keeping a kosher home?\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cNo. Sorry, I -- I really can\u2019t do that.\u201d Not only that, but we got married at\ncity hall and -- and his father was after us all the time. We\u2019d get these letters, \u201cYou\u2019re\nliving in sin,\u201d you know. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you consider getting remarried by a rabbi?\u201d And --\nAnd my husband said, \u201cYou know, why don\u2019t we just do this to get the old man happy?\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to do that. That\u2019s -- That just totally goes against, you\nknow, everything that I stand for. And finally, his father was still writing and -- and some\nother friends of mine said, \u201cAh, you know,\u201d So, on our third anniversary we got\nremarried at Harvard Hillel in Cambridge. And I think we had two friends there and the\nrabbi said, you know, \u201cDo you Mr. Lehrer, take Mrs. Lehrer to be your lawful wedded\nwife?\u201d And I never used the name Lehrer, which was funny, cause I always used my\nmaiden name, until my husband had to have some surgery, and that\u2019s when I started\nhyphenating it. And -- And then these two guys threw rice as we walked out of Hillel,\nand so -- SO We were remarried on our third anniversary, by this rabbi, under a chuppah.\nYou know what that is?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And -- You know, and -- and now I think, well, you know, I don\u2019t know. I probably\nshouldn\u2019t have fussed about that so much, but I -- but I -- I f -- I didn\u2019t feel good standing\nunder that chuppah, I felt -- I felt like I was going against me, and -- and going through\nsome bizarre action just to please somebody else who was not considering my feelings.\nAnd -- And that there was something -- I mean, now I\u2019m older, I go to other people\u2019s\nweddings, you know, it\u2019s fun seeing the ritual and -- and so on and so forth, but when\nyou\u2019re standing there under it, it just -- it seemed -- 1t seemed hypocritical. It seemed as\nthough I was participating in some kind of witchcraft. You know, it -- it -- it just -- it just\ndidn\u2019t -- I mean, I remember standing under that, and just n-not f-feeling right, you know.\nBut, I mean, you know, now I\u2019m older and I think, well I\u2019m -- I\u2019m really glad that I made\nthis old guy happy, and you know, and so -- so big deal, so I was uncomfortable for 10\nminutes, or whatever it was. On the other hand, I think this is the way people\u2019s principles\nget -- get worn down as they age. You know, you -- you -- you stop -- you worry less\nabout your principles and more about, well, you know, so and so really wants me to do\nthat, so okay. I mean th-th-there was another thing, I mean, that -- you know, adults in\nour society kiss each other, and -- and that -- I -- I was kind of s-struck that that\u2019s sort of\nbizarre, because I -- I sort of grew up with the notion that you kiss somebody cause you\nreally kind of like them a lot. And I kissed my brother and I kissed my mother, maybe I\nkissed my dolls, I don\u2019t n -- I\u2019m not sure about that. But this -- this woman who went to\nmedical school with my father, used to get very -- it\u2019s a word I do -- I don\u2019t use the word\ninsult. I mean, I hardly ever use that word, occasionally, but hardly ever. She would get\nvery insulted, cause she would come to the house and she would think that I should kiss\nher. And -- And I wouldn\u2019t kiss her, and my mother would get angry, you know. \u201cWhat is\nthis, what is it? Why do you -- It\u2019s not hurting you. Give Marenka a kiss.\u201d You know, she\nfeels so bad that you\u2019re not -- well -- and I wouldn\u2019t do that, cause I still had principles,\nyou know. I was eight years old or nine, or 10 or whatever. And now -- I mean, now I\u2019ve\njust given in. I mean, you go to a meeting, you meet somebody for the first time, and you\nblow this kiss, you know, you sort of put your cheek next to theirs, and you blow this kiss\nthat goes off into the air someplace. But I mean, that\u2019s what everybody does, and I -- I -- I\ndon\u2019t really like -- I don\u2019t really, particularly enjoy pe -- kissing people that I don\u2019t know,\nand sometimes I don\u2019t even necessarily like that much, you know. So you kind of go\nthrough life and you make compromises with your principles, cause it just makes life\neasier than having an argument every time, about why won\u2019t you kiss me hello, or you\nwon\u2019t kiss me goodbye, or something like that. You know, I don\u2019t want to have an\nargument, so it\u2019s just easier t-to -- to do what the society tells you to do. And -- And I\nmean I think we dress, a lot of the times, not the way we feel like dressing, but the way\nsociety dictates. You know, it\u2019s just easier.",
        "Q: Well, you know, I wanted to ask you one other thing, and it picks up a little bit on\nwhat you were just talking about. In ter -- In -- In -- And I\u2019ve had -- What?",
        "A: Oh, excuse me, I\u2019m sorry. I -- I didn\u2019t really finish answering your question.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: I -- 1 -- I\u2019m sorry. I -- I think I got off the track. After our children were born, I didn\u2019t\nreally want them to get Bat Mitzvahed or Bas Mitzvahed, but somehow -- and my\nhusband is really, totally non-religious. You know, I mean he grew up in that very\nreligious household and then he kind of dropped the whole thing. And by the time I met\nhim in Berkeley -- but in Berkeley he would, you know, he would make a seder at\nPassover, and we would -- and one time it was in my apartment with my room mates and\neverybody had a great laugh, because first of all, we were the only Jews at the seder. I\nmean, we | -- we had lived at International House the year before, and you know, we\nknew one Indian and one this and one that, and so we were practically the only Jews. And\nthen I-I made -- I made something called cogo, I don\u2019t know if you know what that is, it\u2019s\n-- it\u2019s egg noodles with raisins and apples and you bake it in the oven and\n[indecipherable], you know and -- and then -- so I served that and somebody at the seder\nsaid, \u201cYou know, you\u2019re not allowed to eat that on Passover.\u201d Well, I mean, I hadn\u2019t ever\nthought about it, noodles, you\u2019re not supposed to eat noodles on -- well, I -- I don\u2019t know.\nWhen -- When I was at my mother\u2019s house, I think I did fast on Yom Kippur, because, I\ndon\u2019t know, I think maybe she wanted me to. I don\u2019t usually do that. My husband didn\u2019t\nfor years. Every once in awhile, he suddenly decides he\u2019s going to do that. And our\ndaughter went through a stage when she was maybe a little bit -- she started to have a\ntendency to be a little religious, or maybe not even religious, but just traditional. And I\nthink -- I think she is maybe a little bit resentful. She -- She says to me, she says, \u201cYou\nknow, when I was in first grade, the teacher asked everybody what religion they were,\nand when she got to me, I said, I don\u2019t know.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t\nknow?\u201d I said, you know, \u201cJust because we didn\u2019t do a lot of those things,\u201d I said,\n\u201csurely, you must have known that you\u201d -- she said, \u201cNo, I was really confused. I didn\u2019t\nknow,\u201d you know. So -- So anyway, so -- so then, the other part that came into this 1s --\nso in graduate school, I had met my husband the first week, although we didn\u2019t get\nmarried for four and a half years, after we finished. And then I -- I -- I came here and I\nhad my first job. And the guy I worked with, who was my immediate, I don\u2019t know,\nsenior person -- with whom I\u2019m still in contact, by the way -- was from quite a traditional\nJewish home. And he was actually married to a woman who had escaped Europe, she was\nfrom Berlin. And -- Excuse me, I\u2019m going to let this [indecipherable] she\u2019s --",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: So, he -- I don\u2019t know how this came up, but you know, at lunchtime we would talk\nabout things and he came -- one day we started talking about religion and I -- I said,\n\u201cWell, you know, I mean, yeah, I\u2019m of Jewish origin, but,\u201d I said, \u201cI -- you know, that\ndoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d And he looked at me, he said, \u201cWhat are you talking about, that doesn\u2019t\nmatter?\u201d He said, \u201cThat matters a lot.\u201d He said, \u201cDo you think, that as a woman, you\nwould have gone to graduate school, if you weren\u2019t Jewish?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell,\u201d you\nknow, \u201cthere are a lot of WASP-y women out there who -- who do big important things.\u201d\nAnd he said, \u201cWell, yes, but they\u2019re not a lot and that actually, one of the things that\ncomes down to you, about being Jewish, is that there is, in the Jewish tradition, as in the\nChinese tradition, there 1s a tradition of education. And you -- you got a lot of that, and\nthat\u2019s probably why you\u2019re sitting here today and we\u2019re talking about chemistry. And,\nyou know, probably, if you were reared in some other religion, unless you happened to\ncome from a particular kind of home, or something, you probably would never have\ngotten this educated.\u201d I\u2019m not sure to what extent that\u2019s true, but in just doing a little\nreading, and in the years that followed that, I guess I sort of became convinced that the\nlikelihood of my getting a Ph.D., as -- especially as a woman, was probably increased\nbecause there was this tradition of things passed down through the ages. You got to go to\nschool, you got to do well, you got to get A\u2019s, you know, and so on and so forth. And so\nnow, if somebody -- depending on who it is, I\u2019Il usually just say, \u201cWell, I\u2019m of Jewish\nbackground,\u201d or -- or something like that, or occasionally Pll still say, \u201cWell, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m\njust not a religious person.\u201d However, something that feeds back into what we\u2019ve been\ntalking about all day, is h -- this house has wi -- a lot of windows, and some of the\ndownstairs rooms, you could walk right up to the window and you can read what\u2019s on the\ndesk. And my husband laughs about this sometimes, but I -- I would never leave, on a\ndesk in a downstairs room, knowingly, anything that would identify us as being Jewish.\nNot because I\u2019m ashamed of it, but because it scares me. And I know that there are a lot\nof people out there, who for whatever bizarre reason, don\u2019t like Jews. And as I\u2019ve gone\nthrough life and looked around me, you know, and people keep pointing things out to me,\nI think, you know, it really is kind of bizarre, because Harvard University, who used to ex\n-- which used to exclude Jews on the faculty, 1s now 30 percent Jewish faculty,\napparently. And -- You know, and I -- I look around -- I mean, when I read the\nnewspaper and I read that somebody did something, you know, that\u2019s sort of in the\neducational or inventing or something realm, it\u2019s almost always either a Jew, or a high\nclass WASP. I mean, there are obviously exceptions, you know, but -- so I think you\nknow that -- it is funny -- it\u2019s funny that there is so much prejudice against the Jews,\nbecause actually, more or less, I think they\u2019ve done good things. And the other thing that\nsomebody pointed out to me many years ago is -- although there\u2019s c-certainly been\nexceptions in recent years, is that there\u2019s -- until very recently, there is relatively very\nlittle violence in -- in Jewish families. I mean there was a famous case, I don\u2019t know, 10\nyears ago, about some Jewish guy who murdered somebody or beat her up or -- or\nsomething, but I -- I think by and large -- and also, I don\u2019t -- I think, traditionally, Jews\ndrink a lot of Manischewitz wine, but they don\u2019t get drunk. So -- So, you know, why is\neverybody down on the Jews? I -- I mean, I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know. But -- But I -- I mean,\nI\u2019m no longer -- but I\u2019m not -- I\u2019m not -- I\u2019m just not a religious person, you know? But I\n-- | -- 1am no longer, sort of, as anxious to get away from that. I mean, I don\u2019t\nparticularly like to advertise it, although, 1n very recent years, I think there have been one\nor two occasions when somebody has said something that got under my skin, when I have\nactually, in a very mild sort of way, flaunted it. Not -- Not really, but just sort of, you\nknow, made a point of -- you know, somebody making a crack -- although, it has to be\nsomething that\u2019s very important to me. I mean, like one night, my husband and I were at\na dance, formal dance, you know, black tie and tails. So we\u2019re standing next to this very\ntall guy, and we sit down at the table, and I had actually danced with him, I kind of came\nup to his belly button. And he starts going on and on about, \u201cWell, you know, all the\ntroubles in the world are caused by these damn Jews,\u201d you know, and -- and Sam\u2019s\nkicking me under the table, and I\u2019m, you know, and Sam was about to say something\nlike, \u201cWell, you know, we\u2019re Jewish,\u201d or something. And I\u2019m kicking, \u201cShut up,\u201d you\nknow, \u201che doesn\u2019t have to know.\u201d And, so Sam didn\u2019t say anything. But, you know, I\ndon\u2019t know whether I did the right thing or the wrong thing. I mean, could I have\neducated that person on that day, by saying, \u201cWell, you know, we\u2019re Jewish and you just\ndanced with me.\u201d But, you know, I mean, this guy was like 70 years old. I didn\u2019t think it\nwas worth it.",
        "Q: But still disturbing. Very disturbing.",
        "A: Right. But I mean -- But so -- so basically, sometimes I f -- you know, the al -- I feel\nthe only hope for the world is total uniformity. There can\u2019t be different cultures,\nlanguages, religions. Everybody has got to be neutral, cause otherwise, somebody\u2019s\nalways going to hate somebody else. On the other hand, I realize that that would make the\nworld somehow, a pretty boring place.",
        "Q: What about something with mutual respect for difference, I mean --",
        "A: Yeah, but there isn\u2019t -- there --",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s -- yeah, that\u2019s --",
        "A: It doesn\u2019t happen.",
        "Q: It\u2019s not happening.",
        "A: You know? It\u2019s not happening. And, I mean, like what\u2019s going on in Yugoslavia?\nThey -- They all come from this same tiny, little place on the globe, they\u2019re more like\neach other than -- you know, than any of these nations that are fast friends, and they\u2019re\nfighting each other. It\u2019s totally ridiculous. So, I don\u2019t -- I mean, I -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t want\nto be religious, I don\u2019t want to be a ba -- you know, now we go to a seder every year, we\nget invited to one. I don\u2019t -- You know, it\u2019s all right, it\u2019s fun, good company, etcetera,\netcetera. I don\u2019t really want to be -- I don\u2019t want to be forced to do that. I -- I -- Left to\nmy own devices, I don\u2019t think I would do those things. On the other hand, when I think\nabout my way of getting peace in the world, of just wiping out any of these differences, I\nfeel a little sad, and I think, you know, as long as they don\u2019t do bad things, I don\u2019t mind\nthat some people like getting Bar Mitzvahed and some people do this and some people do\nthat. It\u2019s -- It\u2019s kind of fun. It -- It\u2019s colorful. The things that bother me slightly more are\nwhen I -- for example, my cousin Hilda, who -- who lives in upstate New York, she and\nher husband are -- have always been very religious. They will not eat in our house, except\non paper plates, and -- and so on. And -- You know, and when I was a kid, I remember\nbeing invited to her house for lunch one day, on a Saturday and I -- I asked her if she had\na pickle. First of all, she made me -- I was eating something different from everybody\nelse, so she made me eat it on a wooden board. And then I asked if -- if I could have a\nsour pickle -- no, she asked me, \u201cDo you want anything else?\u201d And I said, \u201cId like to\nhave a pickle.\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, go to the refrigerator and -- and get a pickle.\u201d And\nso I went to her refrigerator and the light didn\u2019t go on, which I knew it usually did. And I\nstupidly didn\u2019t think about it, and I said, \u201cYou know your -- the light in your refrigerator\nis burned out.\u201d And she said to me, very sarcastically, \u201cIt\u2019s Shabbat, the light in my\nrefrigerator is not burned out. I loosen the bulb on Fridays.\u201d And --",
        "Q: Did she turn off the refrigerator, too?",
        "A: No. That\u2019s an interesting -- That\u2019s --",
        "Q: So she --",
        "A: I know. Tha -- Well, that\u2019s --",
        "Q: She says [indecipherable] compromise [indecipherable] there.",
        "A: Right. But, you know, and I thought, well isn\u2019t this stupid. When you open the door,\nyou don\u2019t have to do anything, you know. I mean, I can see where in -- in 5000 B.C., they\nhad to make lights by, you know, collecting logs and scratching two sticks together and\nso on. Why -- Why 1s she doing that? Well then, when I got older, I realized it\u2019s\nsymbolic, it doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with the fact that turning the lights on is\nno work in, you know, whatever that year was. But I find that a little extreme and it -- I\nmean, I th -- I -- you know, I\u2019m very -- that\u2019s fine, you want to do that, that\u2019s -- you\nknow, go ahead and do that, and I -- I fully will, you know, go along with your right to do\nthat. But it seems a little funny and extreme that, you know to do things like that in 1999,\nyou know. You don\u2019t want to eat milk and meat together, that\u2019s fine, but you know, you -\n- | put my dishes through the dishwasher and they\u2019re not clean enough to go from one to\nthe other? It seems a little funny and extreme to me. You know, I-I -- I somehow feel\npeople should be scientific and logical to some extent. You know, not entirely necessarily\n-- | -- you know, you can have your little foibles, but I guess -- I ge -- I mean, that bothers\nme, it doesn\u2019t bother me only about Judaism, it bothers me about every religion. You\nknow, there are the charming parts of every religion, and then there are the dodo parts of\nre -- for example, you say you\u2019re Catholic. Well, you know, that\u2019s -- I -- I spent a lot of\nmy young years in -- in New York, going to churches to listen to the B minor mass, and\nall this good music and so on, and I also once made a terrible gaffe. I walked into this\nchurch and I saw all these things, and I thought, \u201cOh, that\u2019s really nice, they have all\nthese footstools,\u201d and put my feet on one of these things, and then somebody told me\nthose are not footstools.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] to kneel on.",
        "A: Right. So -- You know, so that\u2019s all very charming and so on, but then there are\nthings, for example, I don\u2019t know, I hope I\u2019m not stepping on your feet, but you don\u2019t\npractice birth control. You know, I mean that\u2019s -- we got too many people already, you\nknow, and -- and -- and also this comes into my thing about, I don\u2019t thing any child that is\nnot really, desperately wanted, should be born into this world. And I would -- Do you\nknow, I was really bothered, for a long time, that I was an accident, because there\u2019s this\nlarge age difference. And it wasn\u2019t until I was 40 years old that I one day sat down with\nmy brother, and I said, \u201cI need to know whether I was an accident.\u201d And he said, \u201cNo,\nyou were very much wanted.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, why didn\u2019t they have us closer\ntogether?\u201d And my brother said, \u201cWell, because of the depression.\u201d And my response\nwas, \u201cOh, great. So they waited for the depression to be over, and then they had me at the\n-- at the doorstep of World War Two. Well, that was pretty smart.\u201d So -- You know, but -\n- but the relief that I f -- I -- that I felt that night, knowing that I was planned, you know,\nand wanted -- you know, an-and sometimes friends say to me, \u201cOh, oh,\u201d you know like\none friend of ours got pregnant, and she said, \u201cWell, you know, we really hadn\u2019t planned\nto have a child for a couple of years, but I got pregnant, there was a hole in my\ndiaphragm, so we figured, well, now\u2019s as good a time as any.\u201d That\u2019s horrifying to me.\nThat is -- you know, I mean, I -- I kid people and, you know, I mean you can\u2019t plan that\nwell, but both of our kids were wanted and planned and I tell people, \u201cBoth of our kids\nwere born on summer weekend days, because I couldn\u2019t take the time off from work,\u201d\nyou know. So, I don\u2019t know, religions have their good things and their bad things and I\nrealize that some people don\u2019t do well without religion, and I think those people need to\nhave it. But I don\u2019t think it should be imposed on people who -- who are good people\nwithout it, and who don\u2019t need it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. I\u2019m going to -- I want to ask you one more question, but I\u2019m going to --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: -- flip sides here first.\nEnd of Tape Five, Side A\nBeginning Tape Five, Side B",
        "Q: And the -- the last thing I wanted to just ask you was, mi -- picking up a little bit on\nwhat we\u2019ve just been talking about, when you -- when you look back at -- an-and think\nand reflect on -- on the meaning of what you\u2019ve gone through, and -- and the -- and the\nmeaning of the Holocaust, I wonder -- well, I-I wanted to invite -- invite you to reflect on\nthat, but I want to ask you one specific thing about it. I\u2019ve done a number of these\ninterviews, and talked to people about whether they see this as a -- primarily as a -- asa\ntragic, horrible, unfathomable event in Jewish history, or -- or 1-in human history, or\nboth? I m -- To -- To be a little more specific, I have a close friend who\u2019s a photographer\nof Armenian background, and he has, in his own memory, his grandparents memory, the -\n- the Armenian genocide of 1915.",
        "A: What\u2019s that guy\u2019s name? Cause I know a photographer.",
        "Q: Newbar Aliezanian.",
        "A: Oh, no.",
        "Q: No, he\u2019s in Gloucester, where I live.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: And Newbar recently -- There\u2019s a film maker, Arel Morris, that -- that Newbar went to\nshoot some stills for a -- for a film, that he made, partly in Birkenau, and Auschwitz. And\n-- And Newbar of cour -- you know, spent like 10 days there, and of course was, you\nknow, tremendously affected by it. And, you know, his understanding is, this is t -- what\nthis says to him, is what human beings have been capable of doing to each other. And of\ncourse, many Jews would experience this as something much more specific to -- to what\nwas directed at Jews. And -- And I guess I wanted to ask you in ter -- I don\u2019t know if you\nthink about it in these terms, in terms of the lessons, 1s it -- is it a lesson primarily for\nJews, or for humanity, or -- or do you not think of it in that way?",
        "A: Oh, I very much think of it that way. I think -- lesson. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a lesson,\nbecause I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve learned anything. I think -- I c -- I find it very hard to believe\nthat it\u2019s not going to happen again. I mean, like right now, when I turn on the radio, and I\nhear, \u201cWell, you know, the Russians are kind of siding with the Yugoslavs, and China is\ngetting a little alienated,\u201d and so on. And immediately, in my head, I see the map\nswitching into the scenario for World War Three. Because -- I mean, I hope that nothing\nlike that will ever happen again, and -- but -- but I don\u2019t have faith that it will never\nhappen again. And I -- I think -- Well, I think of the Holocaust, as what the hell did they\npick on the Jews for? I mean, the Jews are -- you know, as I said a minute ago, I mean, of\nall the pe -- if -- you know, if I were a bad guy, and I wanted to pick a group of people to\npick on, it would not be the Jews, because, you know, by and large, they\u2019re more or less\nlaw abiding, they don\u2019t drink. They\u2019re -- They have a reasonable family life, and by and\nlarge, they\u2019re educationally oriented, and they kind of do good things, you know. If I\nwere going to wipe somebody out, I would -- I would find groups that do bad things, to\nwipe out. You know, people who -- who -- who are very warring, or you know, or self-\ndestructive, or destructive of other people, or -- I -- [Il tell y -- I\u2019m going to say\nsomething which is a horrible thing to say. And I don\u2019t -- I mean, I don\u2019t really mean it\nthe way it sounds, but it\u2019s a thought that has often crossed my mind. I thought, you know,\nif Hitler had to get even with somebody, and he had to sort of wipe out a group of people,\nwhy did he pick on the Jews? Why didn\u2019t he just decide that he was going to clean up the\nearth of all the people who do bad things? You know, go out and kill all the people who\ndo bad things.",
        "Q: Wh-What does that mean?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what that means, I\u2019m just telling you this is a thought that I\u2019ve often had.\nYou know, that if he had to have this crazy passion, to go and -- and do -- you know, now\nthey call it, or th-they ca -- they call it ethnic cleansing. Why didn\u2019t he, instead of ethnic,\nwhich makes no sense, why didn\u2019t he do some other kind of cleansing? You know, get rid\nof -- of people who -- who murder other people, who -- who go out and, I don\u2019t know,\nsteal, who -- I mean, you know, I -- I -- I don\u2019t know, but why -- why didn\u2019t he get some\nsense -- Some -- some more sensible agenda? I mean, why did he pick on this random\ngroup of people, who undoubtedly have a lot of bad folks in them, but, you know, by and\nlarge, they\u2019re a -- a reasonably okay group. You know, why didn\u2019t he decide he was\ngoing to do in everybody who was in the jails? You know, or -- or sometimes I hear it\ncosts, you know, I don\u2019t know, x thousands of dollars to keep somebody on death row.\nWell, I\u2019ve changed my mind about that, because as I\u2019ve gotten older, it suddenly has\noccurred to me, you know, there are people on death row who really aren\u2019t guilty. But --\nYou know, so why didn\u2019t Hitler make a project of finding out, you know, who -- like who\nwas really guilty, and if somebody really did something bad, you know, make a project of\ngetting rid of all those pe -- you know, or something more sensible, something -- I mean\nthat -- you know, tha -- tha -- it\u2019s a very childish statement that I\u2019ve just made. But -- But\nI -- You know, and I -- I don\u2019t think the Holocaust affected only the Jews. First of all, lots\nof other people, you know, Gypsies, [indecipherable] a lot of other people got killed.",
        "Q: Gays, and handicapped.",
        "A: Right, right. But -- But I think -- I think -- I think the whole world, or a lot of the\nwhole world was affected, and I think the Germans were not the least of them, because\nfirst of all, the good Germans, are often living some kind of horrible guilt trip. I mean, I\ndon\u2019t think I have ever yet met a German who didn\u2019t tell me that they hid Jews in their\nhouse, during the wars. And I\u2019ve calculated that if every German who told me that they\nhid a Jewish family in their house, really had done that, there wouldn\u2019t have been any\nHolocaust, you know? So that must be a terrible thing to have to live with. And the other\nthing was something that actually happened to me. I was invited to give a talk at some\nlibrary in Brookline, some years ago, which didn\u2019t work very well, because I cracked up\nin the middle of my own talk, and started crying, and then I ooof. But anyway, at the end\nof the talk, there was a long line of people waiting to talk to me. And so, you know, most\nof them just said something nice and left. But there were two people, standing one behind\nthe other. The first one was a very elderly Jewish man, who bawled me out for saying\nthat there are good Germans. And right after him, there was a very young, very blonde,\nGerman woman, who was probably in her 20\u2019s, who came to thank me for understanding\nthat not all Germans are bad. So that was -- that was a kind of a heavy moment.",
        "Q: Pll say.",
        "A: And I think -- Aw, you know, there is something else that I -- that I -- I don\u2019t think I\nmentioned this on the other interview, and I think this is maybe an important issue. I told\nyou earlier that I had sort of, in a very casual way, decided I wanted to go back to all the\nplaces that I had been in my childhood. In 1961 - \u201962 -- 61 - \u201962? No, \u201963, s -- 1962 -\n\u00b063, my husband and I took that year off, and my mother took a trip to Israel, and we met\nin Vienna, because I specifically routed that we would go to -- to see where I was born.\nAnd we had lived in these -- we had these two apartments, and they had knocked down\nthe wall between them, so my father\u2019s practice was on the right hand side, and our living\nquarters were on the other side. And, so I knocked -- I was with my husband, and my\nmother met us in Vienna, she came from Israel. I knocked on the door of the left hand\napartment, cause the wall had been re-put up there, to -- to make it back into two\napartments. There was no answer. And then the most unbelievable thing happened. I\nknocked on the door of the right hand apartment. My husband was standing sort of right\nbeside me, and then, my mother was here, next -- sort of next to -- to him. The door\nopened, there was a woman who opened the door. She looked at us, she looked at my\nmother, and she turned absolutely snow white, and started apologizing. I couldn\u2019t believe\nthis scene. We left in 1930, in -- in May of 1939. This was now 1963, spring of 1963.\nThis woman recognized my mother, and she started apologizing, \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault that I\nhave some of your furniture, the landlord told me to keep it. What happened isn\u2019t my\nfault.\u201d You know, and she -- she was just continuously verbalizing -- this was in German.\nAnd I said to her, \u201cAll I want to do is, I want to come in for 10 minutes, and look around\nto see where I grew up. You\u2019re welcome to the furniture, I\u2019m not coming to take anything\naway. There\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d This lady followed us all around her apartment,\nand [indecipherable], you know, \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault,\u201d you know, \u201cthe superintendent told\nme wa,\u201d -- you know, \u201cnot my fault, not my fault.\u201d Well, that lady probably did not -- has\nnot had a very good life either. I mean, I don\u2019t know how often this conscience thing\ncame up, maybe it never came up except this time, but I mean, can you imagine this --\nthis scene. So, I went in, walked into the apartment, recognized the green and sort of\nbeige-y streaked linoleum from my father\u2019s office, you know, where my father\u2019s dental\nchair had been. And there was a funny -- under the linoleum, you could see a round hole,\nwas about this big, that had been covered over, and I thought, that\u2019s where my father\u2019s\nexamining chair must have been. And I still think that\u2019s probably what it was, but when\nwe got finished looking around, and we left, and said thank you and goodbye, and this\nwoman was like a nervous wreck, and my mother was -- my mother was a nervous\nwreck, and I -- I really felt very bad, afterwards, that we had taken her there, because I\nthought, you know, she didn\u2019t need this. We came outside the building, and there was a\nplaque on the outside of the apartment house that said that a bomb had fallen through this\nhouse, but it had not exploded. And so then I started to wonder, afterwards, you know,\nwas that really -- did I remember correctly that that\u2019s where my father\u2019s chair was, or was\nthat where the bomb fell? And I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know what the answer is. In 19 -- I don\u2019t\nknow, maybe the early 1990\u2019s or something, my husband and I went back to Vienna\nagain, just the two of us, and I went back to that house again, and this time the building\nlooked like absolute slum, it was just awful. And I went upstairs and I-I -- I rang the\nbells, nobody answered, and my husband said, \u201cDo you really need to do this again?\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cNo.\u201d And we walked into a fabric shop just a couple of doors down, and\nstarted talking to the woman, and told her why we were here, and we went for a ride in\nthe riesenha -- you know what the Riesenhardt is, in Vienna?",
        "Q: Never been there.",

So we -- we went for a\nride on that, and -- but anyway, that was -- that was -- that was a -- quite a bizarre thing.\nAnd then, I don\u2019t know, I sometimes think I\u2019d like to go back again, but I don\u2019t think I\nwould go back to the house again.",

        "Q: How was that?",
        "A: It -- It\u2019s tilted, but 1t looks brand new. When my mother was alive, she sent money\nevery year to up -- to keep up the grave, and then when she died, I thought, \u201cAw,\u201d you\nknow, \u201cI\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d So it\u2019s -- you know, it\u2019s not nicely kept up, but it -- but\nthe stone 1s still there, and it looks -- I took some pictures of it, it -- it -- it\u2019s tilted, as I\nsaid, but it -- it really looks like new and it\u2019s funny, funny -- not funny-funny, but I don\u2019t\nknow, just weird, going to this place.",
        "Q: Yeah. Well, I really thank you so much for taking so much time to -- to talk about this.\nAre there any other last thoughts that you have, that you want to share? I think we\u2019ve\ngone through sa --",

        "Q: Or early 1990. We\u2019ll provide that date shortly, matter of fact -- the United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making\nthis interview possible. This is tape number one, side A. Okay, so, now we start and we\nknow who we\u2019re sitting with. So, I guess there\u2019s -- there\u2019s some things probably, that\nhave occurred to you since then, that you might want to -- to explore, and I want to invite\nyou to take the opportunity, during the context of what we\u2019re talking about, or the\nchronology, or if there\u2019s things that just come up along the way that you want to discuss,\nwe can do that.",
        "Q: And I first of all want to thank you for taking the time to sit and talk. And I know that\n-- that some of these memories are painful, and -- and I respect your journey, and\nappreciate you sitting and talking with me.",
        "Q: I guess I wanted to first ask if you could maybe take us back and -- and to the extent\nthat you can return us to a child\u2019s memory, and through a child\u2019s eyes, and in a child\u2019s\nheart, remember the feelings that you had when you were leaving Limoge an-and\ntraveling through Spain. As I recall from the interview that you did, that you were on a\ntrain and, remember at all what you were thinking during that time, what was going\nthrough your mind? I know that you were very young, so a lot of it was probably a blur\nnow, but remember what was going on in your mind and your heart? What were you\nthinking about, what were you concerned about?",
        "Q: Go ahead.",
        "Q: When you talk about snapshots, I mean, are -- are there particular -- I guess it comes\nto mind this sort of images frozen in time, in a sense, in -- in your memory. Are there\nparticularly memorable images like that, from that journey that -- that -- that you recall? I\nmean, that -- that perhaps you -- you didn\u2019t talk about it er -- 1n the earlier interview?",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "Q: Just -- Yeah, everybody sitting there with thermometers in their mouth.",
        "Q: D-Do you -- Do you think that you had a sense at that time, or do you remember an\nemotion at that time, about why you were doing this, why you were going? Do you --\nWas it -- Was it conscious for a little girl that -- you were what, four and a half at the\ntime?",
        "Q: Oh, oh, course. Okay.",
        "Q: So when you -- well then, you\u2019ve -- you\u2019ve told this a little bit, so I won\u2019t ask you to\ndwell on it, but what -- what are some of your most vivid memories, early memories,\nonce you got off the boat and -- and you stayed with the Klinghoffers, right, your -- your\n-- your cousins? What are the things that -- that stick out most from those early days,\nwhether it\u2019s staying with them, or other kinds of adjustments that you had to make during\nthat -- during the time which -- which would have been what, in \u201941 now we\u2019re talking\nabout.",
        "Q: Mom, it\u2019s time to cha -- Mom.",
        "Q: No, but I -- Actually that\u2019s -- it\u2019s interesting, the whole notion of malleability in some\nparts of your life, but not others.",
        "Q: I mean, and -- and -- and you -- you were saying, if I\u2019m understanding you right, that\nthat\u2019s a part of what yo -- how you learned to adapt to circumstances when you were very\nyoung, right?",
        "Q: And what were the consequences of that?",
        "Q: What did you feel like, they were teasing you, or they -- were they taunting you, or --",
        "Q: Who is this girl, sort of?",
        "Q: Did you feel uncomfortable?",
        "Q: In what way? I mean, in -- obviously, one can imagine why, but --",

        "Q: Where the person thinks of you as much as -- as -- as of themselves.",
        "Q: You -- Do you think it -- I mean, it just occurred to me that perhaps this could have\nsomething to do with -- or maybe not, but -- but perha -- I was just wondering if 1t might\nhave something to do with the fact that since he\u2019s older, his experience of the -- the -- the\nbrutal meaning of what happened to the family, helps create this -- this sort of difference\nin the personalities that you are describing?",
        "Q: Do you think -- Do you imagine what other world that is?",
        "Q: Is he what, seven, eight years older?",

        "Q: [inaudible]",

        "Q: I\u2019ve decide -- I don\u2019t want to overanalyze or over-pursue this point, but I -- I\u2019m just\nthinking, how much of the presence of your father was he -- do you think he was\nrepresenting, especially in that sort of shrine that you\u2019re describing?",
        "Q: Well let me ask -- let me -- maybe we could just pick up on -- on what -- I just am\ncurious that -- you talked about there was a shrine, your mother had a shrine for your\nfather and wh-wh-what -- what presence of your father did you feel? I mean, did you feel\na -- a terrible -- something that was terribly missing, did you -- were you conscious of it?\nDid you feel like, oh, I don\u2019t have a father, when you were growing up?

        "Q: Well that\u2019s priorities. I mean, you --",
        "Q: -- you make decisions of -- like that as --",
        "Q: Most people don\u2019t do that these days.",

        "Q: And deserting you probably, too.",
        "Q: I mean, I wonder if -- if -- 1f just -- I mean, this -- this experience that you shared, this\n-- this -- this leaving Vienna, and this -- this fleeing for your lives. I mean, maybe -- I\u2019m\njust wondering if maybe part of it was that he was the only person out there who really\nknew, like you did, what you had gone through. And who knew even more, because he\u2019s\nolder. And that there was something -- that maybe you felt abandoned for that.",

        "Q: So you\u2019re saying again, everybody looks like they\u2019re smiling, except for -- except for\nyour brother.",
        "Q: And yet, he\u2019s responding to the reality of the situation more than some of the other\npeople on the ship.",
        "Q: But -- And so he -- Did he -- I mean, to what degree did he or any of you know what\nwas going on?",
        "Q: She started talking about what?",

        "Q: I think -- you know, picking up on this a little bit, to just ask you just -- I mean, I\nguess I-I\u2019m wondering whether the Saint Louis experience 1s something that you feel has\nshaped you, that -- that sort of not being able to come to port. I mean, is that something\nthat you\u2019ve carried with you as a -- as a world view, in a sense?

        "A: Mm-hm. Okay.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "A: I don\u2019t really remember an awful lot. I -- I think I often felt -- I guess you could call it\na sense of confusion, by things that were going on, for example, as I mentioned in the --\nin the video interview 10 years ago, it was strange things that happened. For example, I\nwas told never to lie, and then all of a sudden, I\u2019m told to lie to the German soldiers, and\n-- and make believe that I can\u2019t understand German, or speak German, when that was my\nobvious, fluent, first language. I -- I think I remember being, I don\u2019t know whether\ndisturbed is exactly the right word, but for example, the -- the crowded, awful conditions\non that train. I mean, I remember that quite clearly, so many people crowded into a such a\n-- a little space, and -- and crowded in, not the way we had been crowded in our living\nquarter, even when we were living, you know, 30 females in this -- in this little room, but\ncrowded in a chaotic way. All these people, with these -- all these packages and I seem to\nremember it was night time and I guess it -- I guess maybe it was a little scary at times.\nAnd so I -- I remember a feeling of apprehension often, but other than that, I don\u2019t -- you\nknow, I remember -- my memories of that time are very much -- I was trying to explain\nthis to people, they\u2019re like still photographs that somebody just snapped, along the path of\nmy life. As opposed to my brother, who\u2019s much older, and who really sort of remembers\nthem like a videotape. I mean, you know, this happened, and then this happened, and then\nthis happened. And for me, it\u2019s a bunch of stills that --",
        "A: -- that capture either very significant times -- significant to me, as a little kid, because\nthere was some traumatic thing happening, or some trivial thing happening that captured\nmy imagination. So I don\u2019t remember -- as a matter of fact, throughout my life, I\u2019ve tried\nto retrace that journey and just -- there -- there were only two places left to go last year,\nand so, actually in October, my husband and I went on a bicycle trip to -- to Portugal,\nbecause that was the next to the last place, of the places that I had been, that I had not\nrevisited. And as -- as I said 10 years ago in the interview, I -- I always think when I do\none of these things, that maybe I\u2019Il come across something that will sort of stir something\nin my brain, enough to make me remember what happened here. And so, as we were\nwalking through the streets of Lisbon, I mean, we built about -- I think it was about four\ndays into staying in Lisbon, before the bicycle trip began, just because I wanted to\nexplore, and see if I could remember anything, but absolutely nothing struck a bell, that I\ncould tell, in Lisbon. And we -- I -- we were apparently there for about two weeks. So\nthere\u2019s one -- there\u2019s one more place. We -- We did stop very briefly in two cities in\nSpain, and I -- I\u2019d still like to go to those places, one of them is Madrid. But I -- I think\nI\u2019ve kind of run through the gamut of things that are going to jog my -- my brain, and --\nand now, especially because I\u2019m getting older and -- and at least short term memory is --\nis getting worse, I think -- well, you know, I mean, the -- the ta -- unless -- unless I get\nAlzheimer\u2019s and -- and, you know, and suddenly things pop out of what I call my little\nblack box, I think whatever I\u2019ve remembered, is what I\u2019m going to remember, and -- and\nnothing else.",
        "A: You mean from the journey through Spain into Portugal?",
        "A: Only that scene of all that chaos on the train. Other than that, I don\u2019t remember\nanything. I mean, I have -- I have an image which is not mine, that my brother has told\nmany times, of -- of switching trains at the -- at the Spanish - Portuguese border, and\ngoing from this incredibly messy, chaotic situation, and in -- and having been really quite\nhungry for the last year and a half, coming into this very nice train, with this -- my bro --\nwhen my brother tells the story, his eyes just light up about the, you know, the sudden\nsmell of fresh rolls and -- but -- but that\u2019s not my own memory, I mean, I\u2019ve just heard\nhim tell that so often that I almost feel as though I -- I remember it, but I -- I don\u2019t, really.\nI do remember, actually, when we got on the ship in -- in Lisbon, to come to the United\nStates. I remember tables set for meals in -- in the dining room, and -- and I think -- I\nthink I remember having dinner the first night, or some meal the first night, and then the\nrest of the time, we were horrendously seasick and we\u2019d -- I don\u2019t think we essentially ate\nanything else for the rest of the journey, as far as I can remember. I just -- I remember -- I\nremember feeling awful, and barfing and -- but that\u2019s all I remember, until -- until we\nactually got to the U.S., and then I remember that -- that awful time of having this\nmedical check, which I -- which I mentioned in the -- in the video.",
        "A: Right, right, right. Thermometers that I had never seen the likes of before, and feeling\n-- [remember feeling a sort of halfway between being frightened and being puzzled\nabout, you know, why were they doing this and were they going to make us go back?",
        "A: Well, I was seven by the time we got here.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I really understood what was happening, but I knew there was a reason to\nbe afraid. I sort of knew that there were people who were chasing us and wanted to do\nbad things, and I knew that -- I sort of had a sense that if we could come here, that things\nwere going to be better or okay or -- or something. That this was sort of a goal, of getting\naway from this bad scene. And so, that day when we were having these medical\ncheckups, I don\u2019t know how I knew this, I mean, maybe my mother had said some things,\nor maybe | heard other passengers, but I n -- I think I was aware that if there was\nsomething wrong with you, that you could be sent back. But other than that, I don\u2019t\nremember anything else.",
        "A: We got here on November 10\", 1941. I guess in a lot of ways, I mean, I had learned\nby then to be very malleable. I mean, you know, I got thrown -- I mean, I remem -- for\nexample, I\u2019m a really fantastic sleeper. I ca -- I mean when I -- 99 percent of the time,\nwhen I go to sleep, I\u2019m asleep before my head hits the pillow, practically. And, until the\nchildren were born, there would be nothing, other than the telephone, that could wake me\nup, and I\u2019m still a really fantastically good sleeper, and sometimes people ask about that,\nand I say, well, I think that had to do, first of all because when I was little, and I had a -- a\ngoverness in Vienna, apparently she let me cry myself to sleep, so I re -- I must have\nlearned that there was no recourse when you had to go to sleep, than to sleep. But I think\nthe other reason is that, over those next few years, I mean, I slept in so many bizarre\nsituations, I mean like, sleeping one night on this scale in the railroad station. And I just\nkind of learned that, you know, when it\u2019s time to sleep, you just, regardless of what\nhappens, you sleep. And I remember, I had a one hour commute to go to Barnard\nCollege, cause we lived in -- in Brooklyn, and I -- I think I actually sometimes could fall\nasleep standing up in the subway, holding on to the strap. And now, I mean, just the last\nfew days, I\u2019ve actually been posing -- our son is an artist and I\u2019ve been posing for him,\nand I -- I find that that\u2019s really hard work. But I find that sometimes I\u2019m standing there,\nand I actually have dozed off standing up, while I\u2019m, you know, clamped into a particular\nposition.",
        "A: Right. So, I think I just learned to be very malleable, and so when I got to graduate\nschool and I met the guy who\u2019s now my husband, and I went on some camping trips for\nthe first time, I -- I mean, I had never experienced that and so we -- a group of us went\nand we just had these zero pound sleeping bags and rolled them out on a rock and so -- all\nright, so the group said, \u201cAll right, we\u2019re going -- going to sleep now.\u201d So I just laid\ndown on this rock and fell asleep. And my husband, who was supposed to be the\nexperienced camper, you know, every three minutes -- he was lying next to me and\nwaking me up and, \u201cSh, what\u2019s that?\u201d You know, \u201cWhat\u2019s that noise?\u201d Or -- Or, \u201cBoy\nthis rock 1s hard,\u201d or something like -- and it -- I mean, those things just really -- when we\n-- during the Kennedy elections, we didn\u2019t have a television, and I was at a friend\u2019s house\nand I think this is an apocryphal story, but he claims that I fell asleep while we were\nwatching television and that he accidentally stepped on me and I didn\u2019t wake up. So -- So\nI think I just have this -- I mean, I\u2019m not -- there are a lot of ways in which I\u2019m not\nflexible, but in terms of physical surround, I think because of what happened, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m\nvery flexible. I mean, my husband needs a certain kind of a bed before he can fall asleep,\nyou know, and a certain surround. And other people I\u2019ve been with, have to kind of do\ncertain things, and get themselves ready for sleeping and so on. And I just -- that\u2019s just\nnot requirement for me, you know, whatever is there, I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t have -- \u2019ma\npicky eater in one way, but I don\u2019t mind not eating and so -- so I\u2019m -- I\u2019ve -- I think\nbecause of those years, I\u2019m just very malleable in terms of, you know, those physical\nthings and -- and -- and needs. I think I\u2019ve strayed now, from what you asked me.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes, yes. So -- So anyway, okay, now I\u2019ve regained the thread of what you asked, so\nokay, so I got to my aunt\u2019s house and my Aunt Lena ha-had one of her kids move out of\nthis -- what I remember being a really tiny little room, and my mother and my brother and\nI got to live in there for about three months. And so, you know that was all right, I mean,\nI'd done that kind of thing before and as I\u2019m -- as I said on the video interview, I mean,\npeople thought that we would just kind of gobble up anything that was offered to us to\neat, and I -- I didn\u2019t. I mean, a lot of things that people presented to me were awful, and I\nmean, one of the things that -- that I came to realize in that time is that adults do really\nbizarre things to children, you know. I mean -- And I\u2019m -- I\u2019m aware of this still now, as\nan adult, and I think this very much colored the way we raised our children. But, for\nexample, I -- they would put me on a swing, they would take me to the park and put me\non a swing, and I would say, \u201cPlease don\u2019t do that.\u201d But they would insist and they would\nput me on the swing and start swinging me, and I would barf. And I knew I was going to\nbarf, cause I knew that I couldn\u2019t -- I -- I was just so subject to motion of any kind. But\nthey would just insist. And then my -- my Aunt Lena\u2019s brother owned what was called a\nluncheonette in New York, and so when I visited him, which was not terribly often, but --\nbut more so in the early days, he thought he was doing me this big favor, and he would\npresent me with, you know, a big sundae, with lots of whipped cream. Well, here\u2019s a little\nkid, age seven, who has had almost nothing to eat for a year and a half, and he would\ninsist that I eat this. Well, you know, putting whipped cream, which is like a lot of fat,\ninto a little kid\u2019s system, who hasn\u2019t eaten anything for a year and a half, just doesn\u2019t\nwork out very well. And adults don\u2019t listen. I mean, you try to say, \u201cExcuse me, but I -- I\nreally would not like to eat this.\u201d Total, you know, ignoring o-of that. I\u2019ve --",
        "A: I used to feel really sick after a sundae, or even in -- even later, my -- after -- I mean,\nmany years later, my cousin Dorothy, who was the youngest daughter of my Aunt Lena,\nmarried a doctor and they had kids, and I would sometimes baby-sit for them, or I would\njust go and visit, and I would often eat dinner there. And I\u2019ve never been much of a meat\neater, and I\u2019m getting worse as the years go by, but first of all, ma -- when my mother\nmade meat, she salted it and then she always cooked it extremely well done, so it was\nalways very brown looking. And I would eat that, and I guess I sort of enjoyed some of\nthose dishes at the time. But at my cousin\u2019s house, she would make this rare steak, you\nknow, like a big, thick Filet Mignon kind of thing, and it looked as though it was still\nalive. And I would say, \u201cI\u2019d rather not eat that.\u201d And -- I mean, they just wouldn\u2019t take no\nfor an answer, and my cousin, th-the doctor -- the husband, would say, \u201cYou are going to\neat that,\u201d you know, and I would sit there, at her house, having dinner, with this tears\nstreaming down my eyes, trying to force this bloody mess down my throat. I mean, I\ndon\u2019t know -- you know, they were trying to be nice, but I think -- again, I just think\npeople don\u2019t listen to what kids have to say, and so -- so there were some traumas like\nthat, that -- that happened. But anyway, at -- at my Aunt Lena\u2019s, you know, life was okay.\nI -- She was not very insistent on that I eat things that I didn\u2019t like, and so we just kind of\nstayed there and I ate. I don\u2019t -- I have no recollection of how I kept myself busy during\nthe day, during those three months, cause I wasn\u2019t in school or anything. I remember\nbeing sort of -- very watchful of my cousin Dorothy. She was -- That was the youngest\ndaughter, you know, who later married this doctor. She was very pretty and very -- She\nwore nice clothes and I remember she had this really attractive -- as a matter of fact, I\nhave a -- a picture of her, I think, in this hat with beaver trim, you know, big, broad -- and\nI kind of watched her a lot, and I think I really liked her. She was sort of my favorite\ncousin, in the beginning. And then -- So we -- we kind of stayed there and my mother\nwent around, trying to figure out what to do, and then we finally found this apartment in\nBrooklyn and I think -- I think the rent was like 46 dollars a month at the beginning. So\nwe moved to Brooklyn, and that was kind of far away from where my aunt lived, in the\nlower east side of Manhattan, but it was only two blocks away from another relative, so\nthat cousin, who lived in Brooklyn, whose name is Hilda Towderer, and who just had her\n80\" birthday, she -- I just got a letter from her about a week ago, I th -- I\u2019m pretty sure\nnow that it was to her parent\u2019s home, and she, of course was living there, she was a kid,\nthat we went the day my father died. And that\u2019s where my mother and father were\nsupposed to meet again. So, I have occasional contact with her and in recent years, we\u2019ve\nactually corresponded, you know, several times a year. So anyway, so -- so we moved\nand she already had a little boy, who unfortunately died of, I think, lymphoma, about, I\ndon\u2019t know, 10 or 15 years ago, and then she had a set of twins. She had another child\nmany years later, but I -- I never have even seen that other child. But anyway, so we had\nthis other sort of relative, and -- and we set up in this apartment, on the fourth floor of\n1092 President Street in Brooklyn, wh-which I think stands out in my mind, because I\ndon\u2019t -- I don\u2019t remember anything green on that block. There was an empty lot, there\nmight have been a couple of trees, but if they were, they were small and very few -- I\nmean, it was really a kind of stark thing, and there was an armory across the street, and so\nthe armory was like a solid brick wall that went for most of the block. We used to use that\nto play ball against. And then at the end of the block, there was a little synagogue. But it\nwas a very stark block and it was -- it was probably largely Jewish, but it was -- it was\nquite mixed, also. I mean, you know, there was an Irish family and a this family and a\nthat family and -- and there was Forbes, the black super and -- and there were -- there\nwere two children with birth defects. It was very -- It was kind of a very mixed bag. And\nnow I really start to remember things much more cohesively, so -- so a lot of things\nhappened on this block, you know, right from the beginning. First of all, my mother\nstarted working in a factory, which was a terrible mistake, but sh -- and she worked there\nuntil she retired, and that was horrible for her. And my brother and I went to school. But\nafter a fairly short time, I don\u2019t remember exactly -- 1t must have been like maybe 1944,\nso it\u2019s about three years after we came, my brother got drafted into the army. That was a\nterrible, terrible event for me and for my mother. I mean, you know, we just got out of all\nthis mess and now my brother is going and we didn\u2019t know what was going to happen\nand I-I mean that was just horrible, but -- so in the meantime, I started school when we\nmoved in there, and at first that was kind of awful, because I couldn\u2019t speak English and\nthe kids were always whispering around me and --",
        "A: No, they were just talking about me, I think.",
        "A: Yeah, you know, and what does she -- how come she doesn\u2019t say anything, and you\nknow, whatever. But --",
        "A: Very uncomfortable.",
        "A: Well, I felt, first of all, I felt really different, I felt really left out. It\u2019s like sitting in a\nroom and ee -- there\u2019s a -- there\u2019s a famous painting called \u201cThe Scream\u201d --",
        "A: Yeah, and I think it\u2019s sort of that feeling, you know, you sort of want to cover yourself\nover and -- and disappear, or -- there\u2019s just a really uncomfortable situation for a kid.\nNow, I have felt that often as an adult, but as an adult, it doesn\u2019t strike you that way. Give\nyou just a -- a trivial example; somehow, in our society, you know, you -- you learn\ncertain ridiculous things about what should be and what shouldn\u2019t be, and I\u2019ve never\nreally paid much attention to that, but still, I mean I had never like, gone out to dinner by\nmyself. You know, your -- you either don\u2019t go out to dinner, I guess, or you -- you know,\nwhich 1s ridiculous, cause lo -- lots of people go out to dinner by themselves, now\nespecially. But -- But I just had never done that, and so 15 years ago, or 13 years ago,\nrather, when I made my career change, and I started doing a lot of traveling, in what I call\none night stands in not so cheap hotels, so you know, you -- you get to this place, and you\nregister at the hotel, you go down and have dinner, you finish doing your homework, you\ngo to sleep, the next day you do your work, and you leave. And so I was always eating\ndinner by myself, or almost always. And at first, I found that extremely uncomfortable,\nlike everybody is looking at me, you know, what is this woman doing, you know, eating\nby herself? And I would take a book or the newspaper, or -- or something, and try to read\nwhile I was eating. And of course, after a certain number of years, that whole situation\nturned around. I mean, now, sometimes if I -- if the host -- the person who is hosting me\nsays, you know, \u201cWould you like to come to dinner?\u201d That\u2019s nice and -- and I often enjoy\nthat, but lots of times I feel as though, you know, it\u2019s really a lot more fun eating dinner\nby myself and being able to do what I want and leave when I want and -- and not have to\nmake polite conversation with somebody who may not be that interesting and so on. But,\nas a child, I think it\u2019s hard to come to that second station. You know, you just sort of feel\nyou\u2019re alone, everybody\u2019s looking at you. And I think that\u2019s what I felt a lot, in school.\nWell, I learned English very quickly. I think -- Within about three months, I think I was\nspeaking quite fluently.",
        "A: So -- Well, it was, you know, a third language. And I think when you\u2019re a kid, it\u2019s\nreally easy, you know?",
        "A: It was so necessary. And then I did something that my brother tried to keep me from\ndoing, but I did 1t anyway, and of course, I\u2019ve regretted it ever since, and that is that I\nreally tried very hard not to speak either German or French. Now, I had to speak German\nto my mother, because she took a long time to -- to learn English, and actually for years\nand years and years, I always -- she always wrote to me in German and I -- I think after\nawhile I started -- I -- well, I never learned how to really write German, so I think I\nanswered in English, but -- so my brother would say, \u201cDon\u2019t -- You know, practice the\nFrench, practice the German, don\u2019t forget it.\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t -- you know, I\ndon\u2019t want to -- I want to just forget all that.\u201d And that was unfortunate. But anyway,\nthat\u2019s --",
        "A: Well, I do, but like a five year old. I mean, I can manage when I get there. We -- We\nwere just in Switzerland a few weeks ago on a business trip and I mean, all the sort of\ndaily necessities, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m fine, but I can\u2019t discuss a book or something, you know, I\nhave --",
        "A: So -- And French is -- I mean, that\u2019s an interesting thing in itself, the -- when our kids\nwere taking -- I think our daughter took German in school and she\u2019d call down and say,\n\u201cMa, how do you say --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: So French, which I -- as I say I really learned to speak quite fluently and I went to\nschool there, and then I took it again for, I don\u2019t know, a f -- a few years in high school.\nBut when I have to speak French, first of all, it takes me longer to get into it, and\nsecondly, it\u2019s definitely coming out of my head, not -- not some gut reaction, and it\u2019s\nharder. So there\u2019s -- there\u2019s some difference there, between when I learned those\nlanguages. But anyway, so I learned how to speak English, and made some little friends,\nyou know, friends 1n quotes, because I don\u2019t -- I mean that\u2019s -- one of the things I\u2019ve\nalways been troubled by during my life is, what is the definition of real friend? I -- I\nmean, I find that a really -- that\u2019s a really -- I mean, my husband 1s a real friend, but I\nhave a hard time trying to think about other people. I mean, I -- I guess I don\u2019t have a lot\nof real friends, in my definition. I have a lot of acquaintances, and some of them are\nbetter acquaintances than others. But God, I\u2019ve probably discussed the topic of what --\nwhat is friendship, ad nauseum.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I think -- I think -- My husband always says that I\u2019m a real romantic,\nand a real idealist at heart, and so | think a real friendship 1s maybe like the legend of\nDamon and Pythias -- our son is named Damon -- where somebody will do ver -- almost\nanything for the other person, and where, maybe even more important, and on a day to\nday basis, where the person thinks of you almost as much as they thing of themselves,\nand -- [phone ringing |",
        "A: And where the person is almost totally selfless, with respect to -- to the friend. Where\nanything can be discussed, nothing 1s off limits. Anything that\u2019s discussed, is discussed in\na reasonable, rational way, to be talked out and talked through and it doesn\u2019t engender\nany real anger or permanent scarring, or anything like that. And I don\u2019t -- I mean, I don\u2019t\n-- I sometimes wonder whether that sort of relationship really exists to any extent 1n the\nworld. I -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not -- I\u2019m not sure that it does, but I -- I think that -- I feel that\nrelationship with my husband, I feel that relationship with my children, and I feel that\nrelationship, but in a funny way, with my brother. I th -- My brother and I have an\nemotionally very close relationship, but I think in our -- in our heads, in the -- in the\nintellectual parts of our heads, we live in somewhat different worlds. That\u2019s a whole other\nstory, I think, about what happened to us, and about his being older and really being\nmuch more affected by everything that happened, but I mean, like I can -- well, we both\nlike to tell jokes, I mean we -- my brother and I can sit down and tell jokes for a whole\nevening, but I -- he\u2019s a much more serious person. He\u2019s a -- He has a much narrower area\nin which he operates. I think I\u2019m much -- He\u2019s -- He\u2019s very tolerant, in the sense that, you\nknow, he\u2019s not prejudiced against anything or anybody or anything like that, but he\u2019s\nvery intolerant about what he\u2019s willing to do. He doesn\u2019t like to waste his time, whereas I\nth -- I think -- I mean, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m pretty serious in many ways also, but I\u2019m much more\nhappy go lucky in -- in a way, and I -- I mean, like yesterday I got a letter from somebody\nwho wanted to know if I could help them find a job, and I -- I mean, this person 1s like\nway outside of my -- any area that I conceivably have any contact with, and you know, so\nI called him and he wanted to chat and so we chatted for a-an -- and also, the-there was\nan article Globe about me, la -- the week before last, and he wanted to discuss that, so I --\nyou know, I spent 20 minutes with him. I -- I\u2019m not sure, because I don\u2019t see my brother\non a day to day basis, but I don\u2019t think my brother would have the patience or the\ninclination to do that. But I -- I\u2019m not sure. He -- He\u2019s just -- He\u2019s much more tied up in\nhis work and what he feels he needs to do, and he does not tend to do frivolous things,\nwhereas I do a lot of frivolous things, even though most of the time, I\u2019m -- you know, I --\nI live a fairly serious life, but --",
        "A: Oh a -- Oh, absolutely, but -- but I think, although I don\u2019t know this, I only know this\nfrom -- from hearsay, but my mother always told me that my brother was a very serious\nchild, even when he was two years old. You know, that other kids would want to sort of\nplay, and he would want to have my mother read him the street signs and explain to him\nhow that -- why certain words are spelled in a certain way, and -- now, I don\u2019t know what\ncame first, but I -- I do wonder about this, but they started him on violin lessons, I think\nwhen he was three years old, and that didn't work out, so they stopped him at the\nsuggestion of the teacher, and then they started again, I think when he was about five\nmaybe, or six. And that definitely took and he -- h-he would tell you that he\u2019s an amateur\nviolinist, which he is, but I think he -- and I\u2019m not a musician, so I shouldn\u2019t judge, but\nhe really plays, you know, quite well. I mean, I don\u2019t know that he could go out and give\na concert, but he -- he does play chamber music with other people and so on. So -- And --\nAnd [| -- And that\u2019s actually one of the things that I remember with great pleasure, but --\nbut also something else. When we lived in this apartment that we moved into in New\nYork, my brother would practice violin, often for many, many hours, and I was not\nallowed into the room. But sometimes, as a special treat, he would let me come in while\nhe was playing. And I remember I would sit on his bed and I would just watch him, in a -\n- in absolute silence, and I remember sometimes I would just -- you know, little tears\nwould come, because it -- when he plays the violin, he looks as though he\u2019s transported\ninto some other world, and I find that very moving.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I think -- I think I think of it as some very special wonderful place, that\nhe can\u2019t really live in as a real person, except when he\u2019s playing. But anyway, so -- so\ngetting way back to -- to what was it like, so we -- so we moved into this place and -- and\nI learned English, and I was going to school, and I was a -- I was a very good student.\nNow, why was | a very good student? I think there were several reasons. One was, maybe\n-- maybe there was just something comforting about -- about the logic of school, and the\nthings that you learned in school, and -- I mean, I always did my homework, but I did\nmore than my homework. Like when we learned vocabulary, or later, when I was, you\nknow, when I started taking French, which was in high school. I mean, in addition to\ndoing my homework, I -- I would write words three times each, you know, or if -- and\npart of that was also my brother. I mean my brother -- my brother was very much of a\nmentor, and so when -- whenever I needed any help or anything, he was there until he --\nhe left, a-and then -- and he also -- I think he also used me as a kind of guinea pig,\nbecause I mean, he was much older, so you know, when he was already in high school\nand college, I was -- I was still a little kid.",
        "A: Seven and a half years older.",
        "A: And I loved when he taught me things, so I mean, some of the things I remember from\nthose 1092 President Street years, very often on a Sunday morning, I would open my\neyes and my brother would be standing over my bed with an algebra book. And as soon\nas my -- I opened my eyes, he would hop into bed and -- with a pad and paper and this\nalgebra book and we would sit there for maybe an hour or more and he would get me to\ndo algebra word problems. And so I didn\u2019t know -- and this was very good for me -- I\ndidn\u2019t know that algebra was something that na -- that a lot of people didn\u2019t like to do.\nFor me, doing algebra word problems was like doing the Sunday crossword puzzle. I\nmean, I thought that was, you know, great. But he -- he -- when he learned something\nnew, he would come home and -- and often try to teach it to me, and I really enjoyed that\nmost of the time, and I -- I mean, I learned an en-enormous amount. I mean, for example,\nhe would -- like if my mother needed a new plug put on a lamp, he would do that and\nthen he would teach me how to do that, so --",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s what people say, and I don\u2019t know, maybe that\u2019s true, but I don\u2019t think I\never consciously or -- thought or him as a father, I mean, or even as a father figure. He\nwas very Serious and he was very strict with me, but -- but he was not like any parent that\nI ever met. [phone ringing]",
        "A: Yes. So, my brother -- I mean like, if he learned something exciting, he would come\nhome -- I -- I mean I remember, for example, a subway ride into town with him, and he\ntaught me all about what he had just learned about genetics, you know, and crossing\nwhite Japanese Four O\u2019Clock flowers with red ones, and you know, how many red, white\nand pink ones you get, and so on. And then I often used that for my own purposes. For\nexample, whatever grade I was in, everybody had to give a little five minute or 10\nminutes seminar or something. So I got up there and -- and decided, oh this sounds really\nexciting, I\u2019m going to talk about genetics. And I think I was like in third grade or\nsomething, and I don\u2019t know, kids are funny and -- and so I got up there and I said,\n\u201cWell, when you mate a Japanese, you know red Japanese Four O\u2019Clock,\u201d and so on, and\nthe whole class started tittering, and -- and I think I was -- I was sort of embarrassed,\nbecause you know, with my brother, and I spent a lot of time with his friends at times,\nyou know, you talk about, you know, the flowers mate with each other and so on and so\nforth, but here, in this third gla -- grade P.S. 241 -- my brother always said that P.S. stood\nfor poor suckers, you know everybody starts tittering when you say this, and so, I mean\nvery early, I -- there was this dichotomy that happened in my mind about this world that\nmy brother lived in, compared to this ridiculous world that I was living in. The other\nthing that happened to me in that school was that in the one year I went to school in\nLimoge -- in the European system, I learned, except for American history, I learned\neverything that I learned, in the American school, to the end of fourth grade. So, if I\nweren\u2019t such a dedicated pupil somehow, and always interested [phone ringing |",
        "A: So -- So I was -- I was kind of a goody-goody and I wa -- I always got to be the\nteacher\u2019s pet, and I did all those right things and so I somehow got -- managed to keep\ninterested in school, even though I already knew most of this stuff. And then a funny\nthing happened at some point. My brother came home one day and he said, \u201cToday I\u2019m\ngoing to teach you about probability.\u201d\u2019 Now he -- I think he was maybe already in college\nat that point. And I said, \u201cOh Fred, I -- \u2019'm s -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m really ti -- I really don\u2019t want to\nhear about probability now.\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, all right, then I won\u2019t love you any\nmore.\u201d And -- And I said, \u201cAll right, never mind, just teach me about probability.\u201d And\nso we had this long lecture about probability, which actually was a lot of fun. It\u2019s just that\nI probably -- I don\u2019t know, I wanted to go out and play or -- or do something else. So,\nnow -- I mean, he didn\u2019t do that very often, but -- but 1t was --",
        "A: It was a very powerful ploy.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. He doesn\u2019t remember a lot of -- I -- one of the things that I discovered\nis that when you\u2019re young and impressionable, you remember things that older people do\nto you, but they don\u2019t remember. You know, I mean like, if an adult says blah, blah, blah\nand it hurts you, or -- or pleases you, you remember it, but to them it was just something\nthey said.",
        "A: You mean --",
        "A: -- what he said?",
        "A: No, not terribly, actually. It\u2019s just like haw, all right, you know? I-It -- It was not\nupsetting. Pll tell you an upsetting memory from an adult to a child. Not terribly -- Well,\nfirst of all, when we first moved into 1092 President Street, in this Brooklyn apartment,\nlife was still quite difficult, as it was for -- for a long time, but it -- it kept getting a little\nbetter. My mother earned very little and she -- I mean she -- she was a real Jewish\nmother, you know, everything went to us and the last dregs went to her. And so we le --\nso she went off to work and for the first couple of years, I was supposed to report in to --\nto some neighbor, but there was another neighbor who was sort of a busybody. She\nactually had a kid with Down\u2019s Syndrome, who was kept hidden in a dark room in her\napartment, and -- and one day the older sister actually took us in to see this kid, but I\nmean sh -- but the mother, I don -- I don\u2019t know, the mother just -- you know, she might\nhave been a perfectly pleasant woman, but she -- she did two things in -- in the -- those\nfirst five years we were there, that were really bothersome. Well, first of all, when I\nmoved on this block, the kids were singing this funny ditty that went something like,\n\"Da-da da-da dum, Hitler is a jerk, Mussolini is a meanie and the Japs are worse.\u201d And I\nthought that was like really kind of an awful thing to -- to be singing. But she asked me\none day, \u201cDo you hate the Germans?\u201d And I sa -- I mentioned this on the interview, I -- I\nsaid, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t hate the Germans.\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, then,\u201d -- and I said, you know,\n\u201cSome Germans are good and some Germans are bad.\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t\nyou go back to where you came from then?\u201d And then, in April of 1945, when President\nRoosevelt died, the whole block was, you know, I mean shocked in the way that I, as an\nadult many, many years later, when I was already, you know, a [indecipherable], the\nwhole block was in shock, and people were crying and, you know, but I was a little kid,\nand I knew something unpleasant had happened, but I wasn\u2019t walking around crying or\nanything. I mean, I didn\u2019t -- this -- this figure didn\u2019t really mean a lot to me. And this\nwoman came out and said, \u201cHow come you\u2019re not crying? President Roosevelt just died.\u201d\nAnd I -- I -- I don\u2019t think I even answered, because I didn\u2019t know what she was trying to\ntell me. And she told me again, she said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back to where you came\nfrom?\u201d So, you know, I mean, people were kind of very insensitive. Anyway, I -- you\nknow, I --",
        "A: You mean by her statement?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think I feared it, I just -- I think I just sort of felt that this was a really\nunpleasant lady, or maybe I didn\u2019t even feel that, maybe I just felt this was a really\nunpleasant thing for her to say.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think I said anything, as a matter of fact, because from my perspective,\nthere was no answer. I mean, you know, what am I supposed to do, turn on the tears or --\nyou know, I -- I -- I think what she said to me just didn\u2019t make any sense.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, and th -- I -- There were a lot of funny things that happened to me there. I don\u2019t\n-- | think -- I don\u2019t -- See, I don\u2019t remember exactly h-how old I was at each of these\nthings, but I sort of made little friendships with people, and there was a little girl called\nJoanie Cummings, who lived in the next house, and her mother was divorced, which was\npretty unusual at that ti -- there were a few divorced people on the block, actually, but it\nwas still kind of unusual and I remember f -- we would talk a lot, I mean she w -- she\ncame from -- I mean, I came from a family that really treasured, or -- or was intent on\neducation, and she came from the exact opposite. You know, her mother worked, I don\u2019t\nknow where. She had an older sister who went out with boys and -- and you know, kind\nof -- I don\u2019t know, did frivolous things, and this kid, Joanie Cummings, she was amazing.\nShe played hooky from school more days than anybody I had ever met and she always --\nshe would say, \u201cWell, I can\u2019t go to school today, because it\u2019s an Irish holiday and my\ngreat-aunt on my mother\u2019s fifth side is Irish, so 1n respect to her, I can\u2019t go to school\ntoday.\u201d And for every day she had some -- some ridiculous story. But she was kind of --\nshe was nice and -- and pleasant and it was very informal, they had some kitten in the\nhouse, the house always smelled absolutely awful. But she -- she told me one day, \u201cI\nthink I\u2019m going to go play with this other girl,\u201d and I can almost remember her name, but\nshe lived about a block away, she was blonde and they were both Protestant, and she said,\n\u2018\u201c\u2018We have more to -- in common, because we\u2019re both Protestant.\u201d And -- And I remember\nsort of feeling a little hurt, because we had spent so much time together. And then sort of\nshrugging my shoulders and thinking, \u201cWell, you know, I don\u2019t know.\u201d She was also --\nIn our house, I don\u2019t know, I think 1t was my brother -- maybe also my mother, but things\nwere sort of a little more formal. For example, when my brother was young, when he\ncame home, and if he didn\u2019t use his key and he rang the bell, and I answered the door, he\nwould -- he would do this kind of a European bow to me at the door, you know, of -- not\na bow, I don\u2019t know what you call it, you know, just sort of courtesy bending at the waist\nand -- and he did that to my mother and -- and his -- I mean, his European male friends,\nwhen they visited each other, they -- they -- you know, it -- that was kind of formal and\nyou came and you didn\u2019t sit down unle -- until somebody said, \u201cWould you please sit\ndown?\u201d You know, and so on. And I remember Joanie Cummings one day saying to me,\n\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t know, when you -- when I come to your house, everything is so\nformal,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen somebody comes to my house, I tell them to pull up a comfy\nand squat.\u201d And I\u2019ve never forgotten that phrase, because I thought, \u201cOh, y-yeah, you\nknow, what\u2019s -- what\u2019s different about -- about us?\u201d And then the other thing that I -- that\nI remember from those days is, my brother had taken English lessons in Vienna, and -- so\nhe kind of had a head start, but he learned English, you know, fluently, quite quickly after\nwe got here. And -- And he spoke quite correctly and I -- I never realized it til not too\nlong ago, that he even had an accent, it\u2019s a very slight accent, I think, but-- but when I\nknocked on the door, and he -- you know, in New York, everybody that we knew said,\n\u2018\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d I think maybe I still do that. Do I still do that? No, cause we have\npeepholes, but I still, s-sometimes maybe I do that, and I had learned from the other kids\nto say, \u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d cause that\u2019s what all the other kids said. My brother wouldn\u2019t let me in\nif I said, \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d I had to say, \u201cIt is I,\u201d which is correct English grammar. And then --\nSo I learned to say, \u201cIt 1s I,\u201d but then I discovered that when I went to a friend\u2019s house\nand I said, \u201cIt is I,\u201d they looked at me in a really funny way, and so I learned to become\nbilingual.",
        "A: Yes, bilingual in English, and so when my brother was on the other side of the door,\nor some educated adult, I would say, \u201cIt is I,\u201d but when I was with my little friends, I\nlearned to say, \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d And the funny thing was, and -- and I should have remembered\nthat, and I -- I didn\u2019t recognize it, and I still find it a little difficult, but our daughter, who\nis now a graduate student in anthropology, somewhere along the way, learned to speak\nthis English that I found it difficult to listen to. Like, Meg and me are going to the\nmovies. But even as a very little kid, sh -- and also sh -- she learned it from her little\nfriends, to use a lot of bad language. But, at a -- it -- this 1s interesting in terms of kids, at\na very, very early age, just when she was getting into that stage, when my brother came to\nvisit, she never said things like, Meg and me, and she never used any swear words. And\nso somehow, even though nothing was said, that I can recall, she picked up on this and\nnow -- I mean, she writes very well, and she\u2019s very well spoken, and she is now 29 years\nold and she speaks very well, and if she were talking to you, she would never say, \u201cMeg\nand me are going to the movies.\u201d But when she\u2019s with her friends, who are all now pretty\nwell-educated people, she still says, \u201cMeg and me are going to the movies.\u201d But in\nconversation with anybody else, she would never use that. So that\u2019s --\nor these -- this girl saying, you know, that we\u2019re Protestant. I mean, they\u2019re both\nexamples of difference, and one might be more, sort of steeped in -- in the difference of a\nEuropean background, and one steeped in a religious difference of being Jewish -- being\nJewish, so I\u2019m just wondering how much you -- I mean it -- living in New York, probably\nyou'd perceive it less than in other places. Did you -- Did you have a sense of -- of a\nclimate of anti-Semitism at all, or -- or were --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: | -- I -- I must say that per -- in my own personal life, since coming to the U.S., I have\nnever personally experienced any anti-Semitism that I can remember. When I got to\nBerkeley and went out hunting for an apartment, that was 1956 -- I used to get quite\nbrown in the summer, and I -- when I went looking for an apartment, I went with a\nwoman from New Zealand and a Chinese woman, we wanted to share an apartment, and I\nfound out afterwards, that we didn\u2019t get this apartment and we happened to know\nsomebody who lived in the building, and that person came and told us that the landlady\nsaid she didn\u2019t mind the English girl, but she didn\u2019t want the Indian or the Chinese. The\nIndian was me. So -- And -- And I -- When I lived in New York, I often -- you know, in\nlater years, when more and more Hispanics moved in, I often was mistaken for being\nHispanic, so I mean, I just, you know, I -- I -- I have not personally experienced any anti-\nSemitism, but -- but other prejudices, I mean, for example, on my block, my brother and I\n-- and there was one other -- there was one other kid that I played with who did later go to\ncollege and become a teacher, but my brother and I and one other boy were the only three\npeople who went to graduate school, and so there definitely was -- well, my mother also -\n- my mother, I think, in a funny way en -- I hate to say encouraged this, cause I don\u2019t\nthink she encouraged it, she just -- I think my mother was very proud or something about\n-- about being from a, you know, quotes, good family and -- and you know, being for that\ntime, educated. I mean, my mother -- my mother finished gimnasium, which was unusual\nin her generation for a female, and that\u2019s kind of the equivalent of finishing junior\ncollege, I guess, in the U.S. She was very proud of that and -- that she could always read\nand that she read good books and that she listened to music and -- and so on and so forth.\nSo there certainly -- I mean, I certainly grew up with an air of her having a sense that we\nwere -- I hate to use the word better, but that -- but that there was something special about\nus, compared to oth -- the -- everybody else on the --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: My brother also -- I mean, my brother was -- was very, very interested in education\nand -- and things of the head. And so -- I mean, he taught me a lot of things and he also --\nhe would, you know, he would test me, but not in -- in an unpleasant way, it was -- it was\nkind of more of a game, you know. Music would -- We always listened to WQXR in\nNew York, which was the classical music station, and, you know, \u201cWho wrote that?\u201d\nYou know, and reading -- about reading good books, and he did not allow me -- this --\nmy -- my one really bad thing that I did in the growing up years, my brother did not\nallow me to read comic books. And the only re -- the only bad thing I ever did is, I had\nsix Classic comics hidden under my bed at one point.",
        "A: I wa -- that was --",
        "A: -- that was my one rebellious thing, right. And to this day, you know, I can\u2019t really\nread comics. I find them just really annoying. But --",
        "A: He -- He -- He did, and he also, I mean, I think I owe, in many ways, where I am\neducationally or professionally or whatever, to him. First of all, there was -- there was -- I\ndon\u2019t ever remember having to make decisions, like decisions that I\u2019ve seen my children\nand other kids make about, you know, am I going to college, which college? What am I\ngoing to do afterwards, etcetera. And I -- I certainly had to decide on which college, but\nthere -- I don\u2019t remember ever questioning that I would go to graduate school. I mean, it\nwas never discussed, it was just somehow there. And my brother, I mean actually, in this\nfamily, even -- even my husband, we -- we have a -- a -- an incredible surfeit of teaching\ngenes. I mean, we are -- there is just the desire to always be teaching. I mean my -- my\nhusband\u2019s always teaching, my brother\u2019s always teaching, I\u2019m always teaching. And I\nremember, you know, when I started taking chemistry, I remember my brother coming\nhome and teaching me, you know, how do you do -- how do you make a diagram of\nwater in a beaker? And I -- I -- I even remember that he had a blue -- a -- a sort of aqua\nblue pencil that he was drawing these lines in with. You know, how do you -- you know,\nwhat\u2019s a triangle, how do you bisect an angle? Learning the multiplication tables, I mean\nf -- oh, I know, then -- okay, then my brother went off -- my brother went to -- started at\nCity College. Then he got -- oh here\u2019s an interesting story, he got a Pulitzer scholarship.\nDidn\u2019t tell my mother about it, didn\u2019t tell me about it, either. My mother read about it in\nthe newspaper.",
        "A: Because he was a very private person, and he still is. He does not -- He doesn\u2019t -- I\nmean, like if I got a Pulitzer scholarship, I would probably be out telling all my friends.\nYou know, I wouldn\u2019t advertise it in the newspaper, but I would tell all my friends. My --\nFirst of all, my brother doesn\u2019t talk about things until they have happened, because, as he\nsays, they may not happen. And then, he does not advertise. So -- So anyway, so then he\ngot this Pulitzer scholarship, and so he transferred to Columbia University. And after one\nyear is when he got drafted. So he got drafted into the army, and he went to -- I don\u2019t\nknow, Fort something or other, in Florida. My brother is probably the most un-athletic\nperson I have ever met. So he had to got to basic training, and he was miserable and he\nfainted out in the sun, and you know, and then he tells this funny story about the day they\nwere supposed to have grenade training, he ended up in the infirmary with a -- a fever\nand didn\u2019t get out until after grenade training was over, or something. Okay, so he got\nfinished with basic training, they sent him to Yale to study Japanese. So, he was at Yale\nUniversity for nine months, learning Japanese, which was totally useless, but he liked that\nbetter than having to do some other thing, that didn\u2019t involve his brain. And then he got\nsent -- he was going to get sent overseas and he got shipped out to Seattle and then the\nwar ended. And -- But he had only been in the army now for, I don\u2019t know, a little over a\nyear and he was supposed to be in for 18 months at least, or -- I -- you know, I don\u2019t\nknow what the rules were, but -- so he was -- I think he was private first class or\nsomething. He got shipped to Texas, and they put him into MP school, military police\nschool. Well, that was definitely not my brother\u2019s cup of tea, but I remember when he\ncame home, I was on the floor constantly, cause he -- he had learned all these maneuvers\nabout how to throw people over his shoulder, and so on, and he practiced them on me.\nOkay, so that -- So that was the end of that. Then he went back to Columbia for one year,\nand managed to somehow make up classes and he -- he really was a self studier and so --\nI mean, he tells funny stories. ve interviewed him, you know, like you\u2019re interviewing\nme, and he -- he tells the story about, you know, he had to take this course, and he really\ndidn\u2019t want to take the course and a friend of his said, \u201cOh, you don\u2019t have to take this\ncourse, just go and read this book and pass the exam.\u201d So he did and he passed it, and --\nand he -- he was very bright and -- okay, so then he got out of Columbia and then he left\nto go to Harvard, as a graduate student in physics. So -- I was going to tell you a story\nand now it\u2019s eluded me.",
        "A: Okay, all right.",
        "A: Yeah. No, I was trying to -- It was straight -- something about --",
        "A: His --",
        "A: Yes, and something that he -- oh, oh, okay, all right, so he went up to Harvard and I\nwas here, and I -- I guess by that time I was starting high school, and -- and two funny\nthings happened. One is, I got this teacher at one point, this math teacher who had a\nterrible reputation for being really mean, and -- and I was always the teacher\u2019s pet and\neverybody -- all the teachers were always nice to me, cause I always did my homework\nand I studied and I always did the right thing, and -- you know, and there was a teacher\neven, Miss Massamine, I had, I think, in seventh grade or something, and she was really\nkind of a disgusting character. She always wore black dresses and if you were really\ngood, you got to dust the dandruff off her shoulders. And that -- that totally, you know --\nbut anyway -- but I -- but I --",
        "A: -- was going --",
        "A: I know. But anyway, so -- so Miss Carter was going to be the teacher for algebra or\nsomething, and everybody told me Miss Carter was really mean, and I -- so I was\npanicked, I wrote to my brother and I said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been put into this class with\nthis mean teacher.\u201d Got this letter back from my brother, said, \u201cI had Miss Carter,\u201d sh --\nhe said, \u201cdo your work and mind your own business, she\u2019s fine.\u201d And -- So that\u2019s what\nhappened, I did my homework and minded my own business and she was fine. I mean\nshe was -- she was really kind of an ogre, but she never did anything bad to me. But I\nused to sit there, I mean, when she yelled at other kids, I\u2019d be, you know, I mean I -- that\nwas really -- okay, then I started also taking French in high school, and the first French\nquiz, I got a 98. So I was pretty pleased with myself, cause the other kids, you know, I\nmean, by and large, the kids in that s-school -- I mean, there were some very bright kids,\nbut most of them were, you know, they didn\u2019t really care. So I wrote to my brother with\ngreat pride, I got a 98 on my first French quiz. I get a very stern letter back from my\nbrother. \u201cYou obviously didn\u2019t study. Language is an exact science, and if you had\nstudied, you obviously would have gotten a hundred.\u201d So I went back to the drawing\nboards and I studied, and the next quiz I got a hundred. So -- But, so he was very -- he\nwas very stern, in that sense, but he was also -- but he was also very nice and he was a lot\nof fun. You know, we used to play games together and -- I mean, when he was still home\nand we were younger, we used to have -- we used to duel with rolled up New York Times\nmagazines and there was something funny that happened in the house, an-and the stupid\nthing was, it never occurred to me to protest, but we had an apartment that had two\nbedrooms, a living room and a kitchen. My brother got his own bedroom, I slept in the\nmaster bedroom with my mother, in what used to be my father\u2019s bed, and I studied in the\nkitchen, or some -- later on -- in later years, in the living room. When my brother left for\nHarvard, his room remained and now, as I think back on it, it sort of was like a shrine or\nsomething. I mean, I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t go in there, I didn\u2019t do my homework in there, I\ndidn\u2019t -- you know, I --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but in recent years I\u2019ve written to my brother and I\u2019ve said, \u201cYou know,\nwhy didn\u2019t I use your room? Why didn\u2019t I move into your room?\u201d And my brother says,\n\u201cT don\u2019t know. Why didn\u2019t you just do it?\u201d You know, he\u2019s -- it had nothing to do with\nhim, maybe it was something to do with my mother, but that room was kept empty for\nthe, you know, one week at holidays when he would come home.",
        "A: You know, people ask -- I don\u2019t think, I don\u2019t think -- I mean, my br -- my father had\nhis own shrine, there was a photograph of my father on my mother\u2019s night-table and that\nwas like the shrine, and -- and the shrine was in my mother\u2019s head, but it was not in my\nbrother\u2019s room. I mean, I don\u2019t know what it was, but I mean, in -- you know, it -- and it\nnever occurred to me for all these years, until about -- 1t must have been about five or\nseven years ago, that I suddenly thought, \u201c\u201cWhy didn\u2019t somebody suggest that I take over\nmy brother\u2019s room when he left for college?\u201d And I, you know, I don\u2019t know the answer,\nbut --\nIt was only very much later that I became curious in a number of things. One was, did my\nfather really commit suicide? Everybody sort of assumed that, but maybe that\u2019s not what\nhappened. And my brother says, \u201cWell, it probably did happen,\u201d but -- but anyway, but I\nstill have that question in my mind.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Exactly, but --",
        "A: It was actually before Kristallnacht --",
        "A: -- right, but it was after the August when he was forced to s -- close his practice.",
        "A: It was after the anschluss.",
        "A: The other thing is I -- I\u2019ve -- I just, not too many years ago, said to my brother, \u201cIf my\nfather loved me as much as they say he did, why didn\u2019t he leave me a note if he was\ngoing to commit suicide? Why didn\u2019t he sort of introduce himself and explain why he\nwas doing this?\u201d And my brother pointed out, quite correctly, that when people are very\ndepressed, and they\u2019re about to commit suicide, they don\u2019t necessarily act in a rational\nway.",
        "A: Subconsciously, I can\u2019t answer. Consciously, not terribly, but it -- I think maybe it\u2019s\ngetting ever so slightly more as I get older. For example, my cousin, this woman Hilda\nTowderer, wrote a letter to me a week ago, and at the end of the letter, she wrote a couple\nof things about, \u201cI remember you as a little girl at our house,\u201d and so on, and I thought,\n\u201cOh, why haven\u2019t I ever tapped her for information before?\u201d So when I answered that\nletter a couple of days ago, you know, I wrote like 10 questions at the end, about, you\nknow, what was my father like, what was the relationship between my father and my\nmother, etcetera, etcetera. I mean, I just -- you know, I was at the compu -- I mean, you\nhave to understand that I live my life, really very much in the present, and I\u2019m always in\na hurry, because I\u2019m trying to do more things, always, than there is time to do. And now,\nfor the first time in my adult life, because our son has been ill since the end of October, I\nhaven\u2019t worked full time. I mean, I\u2019m trying to work, take care of him. You know, my\nhusband and I are taking turns doing this. You know, we travel -- he doesn\u2019t travel a lot,\nbut he travels, and -- and I travel a fair amount, and so we live a life which is generally\nvery hectic, I think. But not hectic the way -- I mean, I have a lot of -- I spent most of my\ncareer as a faculty member at Boston Biomedical and then The Eye Research Institute,\nand always with an appointment at Harvard Medical School, and so I don\u2019t -- I\u2019m not like\nyour average Harvard tenured professor, whose life is very limited to getting ahead,\ndoing [indecipherable], you know, [indecipherable] you know, and not -- not doing\nanything else. My husband and I try to do all those things, but we also both have a lot of a\n-- outside interests. For example, we like to ballroom dance. My husband used to like to\ndo photography, he does very little of that now, but -- but we have other things that we\u2019re\ninterested in doing. So, I\u2019m -- We\u2019re -- We are not ever hectic to the point of excluding\nthose things. In fact, I mean I wouldn\u2019t tell my colleagues this, but I usually call at the\nbeginning of the season, when the ballroom dance schedule comes out and I put that on\nmy calendar first. And then if somebody calls and says, you know, \u201cCan you come to\nChicago and do a workshop?\u201d I say, \u201cWell, no, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m -- I\u2019ve already got a date\nthat day,\u201d you know.",
        "A: So --",
        "A: Right, and I --",
        "A: -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know why, but I have a -- I think since my son got sick, and -- we\nhave not gone to any of the really big dances this year, since he got sick, but --",
        "A: And now -- thanks -- now I find that -- I mean, since he got sick, my priorities have\nchanged again, because now, if I miss a dance, 1t doesn\u2019t even, you know, it doesn\u2019t -- but\na year ago, I mean, I would like, bend over backwards not to miss a dance. Why am I so\npassionate about ballroom dancing? I don\u2019t know. I mean I -- that\u2019s -- you know, I mean\npeople ask me and I jokingly say, \u201cWell, it\u2019s my Viennese blood.\u201d Well, that\u2019s a lot of\nbullshit. I -- You me -- I mean, I don\u2019t really have any Viennese blood. My parents were\nborn in Poland, they moved to Vienna. Why do I have that? I don\u2019t know. I think my\nparents did dance. Oh, and then, you know, the other thing 1s, when we came here, the\nonly thing I had, which I still have, is a wind-up phonograph, that my parents had. And\nwe brought, from Vienna, I don\u2019t know, maybe two dozen 78 rpm records, mostly\npopular songs of the day. So, my brother said I couldn\u2019t listen to any of this music, and\nthe only -- there were only two or three records he let me listen to, they were Strauss\nwaltzes, because -- not that my brother is enamored of Strauss waltzes, but that was the\nclosest thing to classical music that was in that collection. So, I remember when I was a\nkid, when I was alone, and after I\u2019d finished my homework -- I mean, I did go out to play\nwith the kids, but I really also spent a fair amount of time by myself. I\u2019d put this\nphonograph on and I would either -- we had a carpet in the living room, an oriental carpet\nthat had sort of a design, you know, with a -- with a sort of pattern around the edge and I\nwould march in time to the music around this thing. Sometimes my brother would -- my\nbrother doesn\u2019t dance, but he would -- he would do a gavotte with me. A gavotte, which\nis a -- sort of a 1600\u2019s dance. And --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: A very formal court dance --",
        "A: -- sort of thing, and -- and then I started taking Arthur Murray footprint books out of\nthe library. Oh, you know, another thing that happened -- see, I spent a lot of time with\nmy brother when he was still home, and we lived about a 15 minute very fast walk from\nthe Grand Army Plaza Library in Brooklyn, which was a wonderful library. And my\nbrother spent a lot of time in the library, and he would take me along, but officially, I was\nstill too young to go into the adult section. I don\u2019t think libraries do this any more, but --\nbut in those days there was a children\u2019s library and you couldn\u2019t go into the adult section\nunless you were a certain age. So, first of all, my brother walked very, very fast, and so,\nwhen I started walking with him, I\u2019d kind of be dragging, you know, down the street. But\nso, what do you do? I learned how to walk. I am probably the fastest walker of anybody\nthat I know, even now. I mean, I can out-walk practically anybody. And so I learned to\nwalk very fast, and -- and then later in life it kind of turned around, I mean, my brother\nhas some foot problems an-and other, you know, things, so he -- he no longer walks fast\nand so -- so now, you know, everybody else in the family usually says, \u201cCould you please\nslow down?\u201d But -- But so we would walk to the library very often and because I was\nwith him, he could take me into the adult section. But he didn\u2019t really want to be bothered\nwith me once we got into the adult section, so he would drop me at the first set of\nbookshelves in the adult section, which happened to be psychology. And so I would sit\non the floor for hours, while he was doing his thing, and I would rummage through the\npsychology books. And usually, what was on the bottom shelf was about optical illusions,\nso I learned a lot about optical illusions. So -- So a lot of me was formed by -- not\nintentionally, ba -- by my brother, but just because I was around him and -- you know,\nand then, I mean, if his friends came and they were going to the Museum of Modern Art,\nI mean the first time I ever went to the Museum of Modern Art was because my brother\nwas going with a friend and he took me along.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so, no.",
        "A: Well, except -- except that I can never decide, did I get interested in science because\nscience was interesting, or because my brother made science interesting, or because my\nbrother got me interested in science, or another -- I mean, the reality is that I was able to\nget a fellowship to graduate school, which covered all my expenses, living and school\nand everything, because in those years, a lot of money was being poured into science. I\nmean, it is now, but it -- but it was much more so then. Did my brother go into science\nbecause he knew that that was a good way to get out of the ghet-ghetto in which we lived,\nin Brooklyn, and I just followed? Or was there some other, deeper, more meaningful\nthings that were going on, or was it just because my brother taught me a lot of science\nand science was fun and I seemed to be good at it and you know, there\u2019s nothing that\nsucceeds like success? I mean, who knows? I\u2019ve had a lot of discussions in recent year --\nwell, not a lot, but \u2019ve had discussions in recent years with my brother about something\nthat I find extremely disturbing and very horrifying. And that is that when I sit down and\nanalyze what happened to me in my life and what happened to my brother, although he\u2019s\nhad a much more difficult life, that our lives were probably better in the long run, and\nmore exciting, and more fulfilling because of those things that happened, than they would\nhave been if nothing -- if there had been no war and we stayed in Vienna. That\u2019s kind of a\nhorrible thought, that -- that our lives were enhanced at the cost of so much tragedy, to\nsuch an enormous number of people. That\u2019s a -- That\u2019s a very difficult thought to live\nwith.",
        "A: You know, until 1974-ish, I really did not think about any of the past. When people\ntried to talk to me about it, I just said, \u201cOh, I was too young, that had no effect on me.\u201d I\nwas intr -- I had blinders on, I just wanted to get on with my career, I wanted to do my\nthing, I wanted to get out of that place in Brooklyn. I wanted to get away from those\npeople that I grew up with. I wanted to get to a better place. When I got to Barnard\nCollege, that\u2019s another interesting story, how did I manage to get to Barnard College, but\nwhen I got to Barnard College, I remember feeling sad. I -- I felt sad that, why couldn\u2019t I\nha -- you know, there were these all -- I mean, this was by no means the rule in those\ndays, because by and large, women didn\u2019t do much in those days, but I met a lot of\nwomen at -- the first year at Barnard whose parents were lawyers and whose mothers\nwere lawyers or doctors and you know. I mean, overall, I think most of the mothers were\nhousewives, but -- but my head focused in on why couldn\u2019t I have a mother who was a\ndoctor or a lawyer, and I -- that really bothered me, that my mother had not chosen to do\nsomething important. Now, my brother was very partial to my father, and he tells me it\u2019s\nbecause, you know, my father was doing important, good things, my mother was\nfrivolous. She was interested in fashion and you know. And somehow, in recent years,\nI\u2019ve tried to tell him, \u201cBut look at -- look at how she came through when the chips were\ndown.\u201d",
        "A: Yes, well I didn\u2019t when she was still around, but I do now. But I think -- I think my\nbrother appreciates everything she gave up and everything that she did, but he certainly\ndoes not see her as a heroic figure. He sees her as somebody who was pulled into being\nheroic by circumstances, but who, having -- if she had been left to her own devices,\nwould have been, you know, dressing up and putting on make-up and -- and having\ncoffee klatches and so on.",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: Yes, and I think he really appreciated that, but I don\u2019t think he really respected the\ninner person that she was or would have been if this event hadn\u2019t happened. He really\nrespected my father. My father, he says, did good things for people. He was thoughtful,\nhe was, you know, he -- he educated himself. So h-he -- you know, it\u2019s funny, my brother\ngot himself so educated and was never interested in small talk or anything like that. So\nanother thing that happened between him and my mother was that it got to a point fairly\nearly, when they really almost couldn\u2019t talk to each other, because my brother didn\u2019t\nknow small talk and my mother couldn\u2019t talk physics or philosophy, or you know,\nwhatever. And he was -- he was nice to her, I mean, he wasn\u2019t mean or anything like that,\nbut he just really didn\u2019t have anything in common with her. I-It was -- It\u2019s funny, it\u2019s\nkind of a scary thing, I mean, 1-if you\u2019re a parent, you know, who are your children, I\nmean, and what do they turn out to be and is there any rule that says they have to be like\nyou, or that -- you know. And it always hurts me when I hear these stories, but for\nexample, my -- my Ph.D. thesis advisor has one son and he -- the last time I saw him,\nwhich was, I don\u2019t know, maybe seven or eight years ago, he said, \u201cWell, I see my son\nonce a year. We go fishing together, alone, for a week.\u201d He said, \u201cI don\u2019t like the woman\nmy son married. We have nothing in common, we don\u2019t have a lot to, you know, to do\nwith each other. We enjoy our annual fishing trip, and that\u2019s it.\u201d Well, to me that\u2019s very\nsad, and I mean, my husband and I are very involved with both our kids, I mean, maybe\ntoo much involved, but I like to think that we are also not just parents -- I mean, that we\nare also, I don\u2019t know, friends or something, I don\u2019t know. But -- But I mean, I think\nwe've also really worked at that and I think maybe, you know, why did I work at that so\nhard? And I think that was conversations my brother and I had early, about parenting. I\nmean, I remember one day having a conversation with my brother bef -- I think 1t was\nbefore he went off to college, about -- and my brother said to me, \u201cA child is like a ship.\nWhen you finish building it --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning of Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: My brother said that a child should be like a ship, and that when you finish building\nthe ship, and you crack the champagne bottle over the bow, or whatever, and you send it\nout to sea, that you have to be confident that you\u2019ve done a good job building the ship,\nand that it will not sink, that it will sail under it\u2019s own steam, and that you then can\u2019t\ncontinually watch out for it and you know, sort of be trying to tell it where to go and what\nto do.",
        "A: He\u2019s not a parent, he\u2019s never been a parent.",
        "A: And he said that to me, I think it was when he was still in college, because he was still\nhome. And I always remembered that. So, very early on -- first of all, I wasn\u2019t going to\nhave any kids either. That -- What I -- I was definitely not going to have any kids.",
        "A: Well, actually, when I grew up with my brother, I mean, I sort of grew up with the\nidea that we were never going to get married, we were just going to be these dedicated\nscientists and we were not going to have a marriage, or children, we would just be these\ncareer folks. At some point my brother met a young woman and they ended up getting\nmarried, and that was a very , very, very difficult time in my life, because I felt -- I felt as\nthough I had been deceived somehow. I just -- See, I think one of the things that\nhappened, is when my brother was home, we were pretty close and we -- we talked a lot,\nbut the one thing I didn\u2019t realize until way later, is that I talked a lot more than he talked.\nAnd I didn\u2019t realize how private a person he was, and so, as he went through his traumas\nin life, like the army, and you know, all the things that happen as you\u2019re a young person\ngrowing up, he didn\u2019t share those things with me. He taught me a lot of stuff and so on,\nbut he didn\u2019t -- he didn\u2019t take the opportunity to teach me about what I call the sort of,\nreal life skills. And so, I think -- I think when he was going to get married, I mean that\njust ki -- was like something totally out of the blue, and I -- I think I -- I remember\nwriting that this -- I remember writing very dramatic things at that point. I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe Ill find them someday if we ever clean out the house, but I remember feeling that\nthis was like the fall of -- I remember writing something about that I felt like, \u201cThe Fall\nof the House of Usher,\u201d that I guess I\u2019d been reading Poe at the time, but -- and I had\nreally morbid thought about, you know, that -- that my brother was sort of deserting the\nplan, or -- I mean, I -- you know, I -- I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Maybe deserting me, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yeah. I mean, I really shouldn\u2019t have, it\u2019s just that he didn\u2019t make me sufficiently\naware of his inner life and -- or I don\u2019t know, maybe it was more than just his inner life,\nbut for example, he had a -- he had a very interesting thing happen, which I only barely\nmentioned in the in -- in the video interview. When we got to France, and I can\u2019t\nremember which town, I think -- I don\u2019t remember which town it was, but anyway, he\nmet this -- this young man, who was probably 20-something, who was a pianist, a\nprofessional p-pianist, from Poland. Also Jewish and apparently did not make it through\nthe war. This guy had a room somewhere and so okay, it must have been in Limoge. He\ninvited my brother to come and stay with him for, I guess a month or so. And so this guy\nwas 21, which in those days was quite an adult age. You know, 21 now is not as adult as I\nthink 21 then. So this guy had fled Poland and was totally on his own, and so he kind of\nknew a little bit about the ropes, cause he had already been there, I don\u2019t know for, you\nknow, weeks or months, whatever it was. And so he took my brother under his wing, and\nhe said, \u201cOkay, so, you know, what would you like to do?\u201d And my brother said, \u201cWell,\nI'd like to go to school.\u201d And so he said, \u201cWell, you know, there\u2019s a school on such and\nsuch a street, why don\u2019t you go down there and register?\u201d And so my brother went down\nthere and -- and he -- he -- when I was interviewing him in recent years, he said, \u201cI was\nthe only kid in the school who was not being registered by parents. I was the only one\nwho was on my own,\u201d and -- and he said, \u201cso I got into this class, with this nice guy, who\nhappened to be the headmaster,\u201d Monsieur Nabout was his name, N-a-b-o-u-t. And in\nthat class, kids got seated according to their grades. So my brother started in the last seat.\nAnd apparently, within like two or three months, my brother was sitting in the first seat,\nand -- and Monsieur Nabout also took my brother under his wing and sort of, you know,\nkept him after school, and helped him with his French, and his this and that and so on. So\nthat was a really positive thing, and then this guy one day said, \u201cWell, so, you know,\nwhat else would you like to do?\u201d And my brother said, \u201cWell, I play the violin, and I\nhave my violin and -- and I -- I\u2019d like to take some lessons.\u201d And so, he said, \u201cWell, you\nknow, on such and such a street, there\u2019s this music conservatory,\u201d you know, \u201cget\nyourself over there.\u201d And -- And somehow my brother went there and I guess he got\nlessons and they must have given him lessons free, or I -- I don\u2019t know how, but anyway\nhe, you know. So, this guy, I think was very formative in helping my brother grow up. I\nmean, my brother had already grown up very quickly, cause he had to do -- he spoke a\nlittle French. My mother knew no French and I knew no French. So he was -- I mean,\nonce we got to France, he was in charge of all the official things that had to be done. So\nthat was a really fast growing up. But in addition, there was this other stuff growing up,\nand that stuff I didn\u2019t see, and I don\u2019t think my brother really -- I mean, why would he\ncome home and tell this little seven and a half year old younger sister about this stuff that\nwas going on? So I -- I wasn\u2019t aware of -- of all that other stuff that went on. And then, of\ncourse, in -- when we got here, and when my brother was at Columbia, he got some\nfriends, and I -- I remember like one night, my brother took me with him to the -- I mean,\nthis 1s -- my brother almost never did this, but he went to this friend\u2019s house, and there\nwere a lot of other young men there, and here\u2019s this little sister. And they were playing\ncards, which I don\u2019t think my brother did very often, and certainly I\u2019m sure he never did\nit as a -- you know, as a real adult. But I just sat in the back of this guy\u2019s apartment with a\n-- | think my brother bro-brought a book for me, or something, and I just sat there\nreading. But I wasn\u2019t just reading, I was looking up at all these big guys, you know, and\nthey were joking and playing cards and -- and the thing that my brother did, which I\nalways felt -- I mean, it was -- it was very difficult being alone in that, you know, this\nlittle girl sitting there, you know, no friends, just watching these big guys having a good\ntime. But in a funny way, I didn\u2019t really ever feel lonely, because you know, I\u2019d kind of\nsneak glances up at the boys and sort of every fifth glance or 10\" glance, whatever it was,\nmy brother would look up and wink at me with this wonderful smile. So that I always had\na feeling that I wasn\u2019t really alone, you know, and that he -- he hadn\u2019t just forgotten\nabout me. So, and -- and then -- I mean, he would close himself in his room in our\napartment at 1092 President and he would be doing his homework, or practicing his\nviolin and I would be at -- first of all, if I wanted to come in, I had to knock. But -- And\nhe didn\u2019t like me to knock too often, cause I would disturb his concentration. So I would\nbe sitting in the kitchen, doing my homework, but every -- I don\u2019t know what it was, once\nan hour, or whatever, he would come out and he would just come up behind me and\nstroke my hair, I had rather long hair. I mean, not very long, but you know, sort of up to\nthe middle of my back, and stroke my hair and ask me how I was doing, look down to see\n-- make sure I was doing something serious. So, I was always aware of his presence. And\nyou know, it\u2019s funny, people say that when you grow up with parents who argue, that it\u2019s\nvery troublesome, and I only had one parent, but I had this brother. And, as I mentioned\non the videotape, very often my brother would say one thing and my mother would say a\ndifferent thing. But it never troubled me, because I had somehow, at some very early\nstage, made up my mind that my mother was very emotional and that what she said came\nout of, sort of an emotional rationale, whereas what my brother said made a lot more\nsense and came out of the gray matter center. And so, I was rarely troubled by this,\nbecause it was totally obvious that -- that almost all the time, it was better to do what my\nbrother said.",
        "A: Well, I talked about this on the -- on the video interview, but my sense of my mother\nhas changed in the last 10 years. First of all, I had a very good relationship -- a pretty\ngood relationship with my mother for most of my growing up years, because first of all,\nmy mother went to the factory every day and I was left alone. So I had a lot of\nresponsibility and my mother trusted me. And also, my mother did not indulge in certain\nthings. For example, not terribly long after I came on -- I must have been like in first\ngrade, there was all this buzz around the block with the kids, about where do babies come\nfrom, you know. And my mother -- I don\u2019t think my mother really knew a lot about\nwhere babies come from. My mother told me what she thought was the truth, babies\ncome out of your stomach. Well, babies do not come out of your stomach, they come out\nof your uterus, but anyway, I mean, you know, she didn\u2019t have the anatomy quite right,\nbut -- but it -- or maybe that was just, you know, the way people talked about things in\nthose days, but -- but she -- you know, I asked one day, \u201cWhere do babies come from?\u201d\nAnd she just sat down and told me, you know, about the birds and the bees and the\nflowers, and -- in a -- as straightforward a manner as she knew. So, I went out on the\nstreet to play with my -- the little kids and ultimately this conversation arose about where\ndo babies come from and this one kid told me that babies are brought by the stork. And I\nlooked at this kid and I said, \u201cBabies are not brought by the stork.\u201d\u2019 And I repeated this\nwhole lesson that my mother had sai -- you know. So, some of the parents were very\ndistressed with either me or my mother, or both.",
        "A: Maybe about eight or nine. That -- That I was going around spilling the beans about\nwhere babies really came from, when they were telling their kids these unbelievably\nridiculous stories. So I really appreciated that my mother was honest with me, as far as\nshe, you know, she could be, and -- and I could talk to her about things, and she talked to\nme about things and we -- we kind of -- we did all right together. You know, she -- When\nI had to memorize poems, you know, sh -- even though she was exhausted after coming\nhome from work, and then doing all the housework, cause my brother and I did\nappallingly little, my brother less than I, but she would sit in bed and listen to me recite,\nyou know, Gunga Din or something, ti -- until I had 1t memorized, and -- and I would test\nher. She had a book about how to learn English and I would test her about, you know,\nthis is cherry pie, and all these funny things. So she -- she was nice with me about, you\nknow, helping me study and so far as she could, and -- and so on. The first friction\nbetween my mother and me, happened when I was about 11, and the other -- there was\nanother little girl that -- on my floor in the apartment house who was a year older. She\nturned 12, and she started dating, and my mother got very nervous. My mother -- Well, I\n-- | don\u2019t know. My mother had an argument throughout the rest of our lives, which in\nretrospect is the most stupid, ridiculous argument, especially by 1990 standards, but in\ncollege, the last year of college, I was friends, pals, with another woman in the chemistr -\n- who was a chemistry major, and we\u2019re still friends, I mean, wa -- we still talk to each\nother, and I got her a job, as a matter of fact, where I used to work. This woman went off\nto Tanglewood with the guy who she subsequently married. And my mother was\nabsolutely horrified that -- that this woman went off to Tanglewood and stayed overnight\nin some barn -- I -- they slept in some barn. And I was very naive. I was -- I was very\nnaive, em-emotionally. So -- So this argument came up. My mother said, \u201cHm,\u201d you\nknow, \u201cwhat kind of a girl is this, going off to, you know, stay in a barn overnight with\nthis guy?\u201d And I said, \u201cMa, I\u2019m sure nothing happened.\u201d Now, in retrospect, when I look\nback, I think why the hell was I so sure that nothing happened, and who the hell cares?\nBut, I think the reason I was so sure that nothing happened was, I remember this young\nwoman once coming to me in the chemistry lab and telling me -- we were discussing --\ntampons had just come out. We were discussing whether it was all right to use tampons\nor not. And this woman said to me, \u201cWell, I can\u2019t use tampons because what if my hymen\nbroke and you know, what would this guy say, if we get married and I\u2019m not a virgin?\u201d\nAnd, so I think that\u2019s what made me so sure that probably nothing happened. So anyway,\nso this conversation, about did something happen or did not something happen in the\nbarn, my mother discussed until my mother got Alzheimer\u2019s disease. I mean, it would\ncome up once every year or two and my mother would say, \u201cThat was disgusting that she\nspent the night in the barn.\u201d And -- And I would say, \u201cMother, nothing happened in the\nbarn.\u201d You know, I mean, it was just, you know, just so --",
        "A: My mother was extremely proud of the fact that no man, other than my father, had\never touched her. When my mother was 80 and we had moved her up here and she went\nto a -- a -- I don\u2019t know, senior citizen club meetings in Brookline, one day, it was raining\nvery hard, and we came to pick her up to take her out to dinner or something, and she had\nwalked back, and she just casually mentioned, she said there was this guy who had\noffered her a ride home, and I said, \u201cWell,\u201d you know, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you take the ride? It\nwas raining.\u201d She said -- I mean, she just lifted her shoulders in that, you know, in that\nspecial, proud, European woman sort of way. I mean, y-you just don\u2019t see American\nwomen doing things like -- and she said, \u201cWho do you think Iam? Would I get into a car\nwith a strange man?\u201d And here she was, 80, you know? And -- But I mean -- But I grew\nup that way. I mean, I -- Even when I -- I never dated in college. I think I -- I actually did,\nmaybe on three occasions, go someplace with a guy. And they were -- they were\ngenerally very -- I mean, do you want to hear about this?",
        "A: They were very strange events. I mean, I think the first time was, my father went to\nmedical school with a woman, who was the mother of two sons, and I always say that I\nwas friends with Bob Silber since four years before I was born, because our parents were\nfriends. And so -- so those two parents were doctors. That g -- That guy just died. That\nguy died in November, Bob Silber, he was a hematologist. But anyway, I mean I -- you\nknow, I\u2019ve known him forever, and so we were always friends and he would -- he -- he\nwas older, I mean, he was four years older than I was, and he would take me places like\nLewison Stadium, to the concerts and -- and things. And so one day he said, \u201cI have -- I\nhave this friend, and he\u2019s -- he\u2019s going to this,\u201d -- I don\u2019t know, was some dance where\nyou had to dress up. \u201cI want you to go with him.\u201d You know, \u201cNothing will happen,\neverything\u2019s going to be all right, I want you to go.\u201d So against great protest, I went and I\nwent and I bought a -- sort of a dress that I actually remember. And it was a very -- I had\na really unpleasant evening. I mean this -- I -- This guy didn\u2019t know how to dance, I had\nnever danced with anybody else before. I danced a lot by myself, but I hadn\u2019t ever danced\nwith anybody, except my mother and my brother before. I was just really uncomfortable\nin this situation. This guy didn\u2019t know how to carry on a conversation. I was -- So okay,\nso the next time, I think I -- well, then I went to work at Brookhaven. There was a special\nprogram and you could apply for it and I -- I got in to go to Brookhaven for two summers\nand work at Brookhaven National Lab. And I met a guy there, who actually is also a\ndoctor now, down I think, maybe in Florida, whose name was Norman Bauman, and he\nand I would talk a lot and he -- I mean, I think I actually -- I might have actually even\nkissed him or something. I don\u2019t know, but he -- he talked to me a lot about why was I so,\nyou know afraid of getting close to s -- to some guy ra -- so we had a lot of interesting\nconversations, and -- and I felt sort of friendly with him for awhile. But I think -- I think -\n- And I always had a fond spot in my heart for him, but I think it was more -- not so much\nbecause of things that he talked to me about -- you know the -- that sort of dating game,\nbut more because everybody I knew, practically, hated their mothers, and you know, sort\nof -- maybe it\u2019s still a popular thing to hate your mother, but Norman Bauman said, \u201cI\nreally respect my parents and I really like my mother.\u201d And he -- And I mean this -- that\nseemed very trivial in retrospect, but he said, \u201cOne of the things I really like about my\nmother is that she never comes down to see me or my father without looking nice. She\nalways combs her hair, she always has a nice bathrobe on. She always is respectful 1-in\nthat way.\u201d And I thought, \u201cWow, this guy is really different from anybody I\u2019ve ever\nmet.\u201d So that was my -- that was sort of like a first awakening. And then, in my senior\nyear -- the first year in college, I met a woman with whom I\u2019m still friends, although\nwe ve had our ups and downs, but we\u2019re still friends. And we got to be like best friends\nand we were best friends for four years. I mean, we spent practically all our spare time\ntogether. And -- But there was a -- there was a really big upheaval. Her mother was\nconstantly saying things like, \u201cBarbara, you can\u2019t marry Liane, what are you spending so\nmuch time with Liane?\u201d And I thought that was really like a horrible thing to say. You\nknow, I mean, she was always wanting her daughter to go out on dates. And so her\ndaughter did go out to tea dances, and you know, all these things that happened at the\ncollege. In -- I never went to any of those. I mean I -- you know, and I used to -- I used\nto -- when I heard about the tea dances, I used to call them the slave market. Maybe other\npeople called it that, also, you know, was the guys stood on one side, the women stood on\nthe other side and I really hated that, I would never go to anything like that\n[indecipherable]. And -- But anyway, the last year in college, she met this guy and I don\u2019t\nknow how it happened, but she went and had coffee with him and I was supposed to meet\nher and so I met him. And she called me up and she said, \u201cHe would like to go out with\nyou,\u201d you know. \u201cWould you consider going out with him?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I -- No, I\ndon\u2019t think so.\u201d And she kind of talked me into it. So -- So I went to the movies with this\nguy, tall, thin guy. You must be laughing at all of this. This -- This guy -- So we went to\nthe movies and then he took me home, which was, I think the first time I\u2019d ever been\ntaken home. I mean I -- I used to come home alone in New York from the subway, you\nknow, at two o\u2019clock in the morning, never bothered me. My mother was always worried,\nbut -- so he took me home and we got to my apartment door, and I was ready to say\ngoodnight and he said, \u201cCould I come in for a little while?\u201d Well, I didn\u2019t really want him\nto come in, but I felt 1t was very impolite, so I -- I let htm come in and so he sat down on\nthe couch in the living room, and I sat down on a chair on the other side of the room. And\nn -- the bedroom adjoined the living room with a -- glass doors, which might have had\nsome curtains on them, and they were not closed, and my mother was sleeping in this --\nin this next room. And he said, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you come here and sit next to me and\nget a little cozy?\u201d And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to come and sit there and get a little cozy.\u201d\nAnd then he came and sat down next to me, where I was sitting.",
        "A: Right. And do you -- you won\u2019t believe -- do you know what I did? I went and woke\nmy mother up to come and get this guy out of the house.",
        "A: And I -- I met him on campus afterwards, and he said hello and I st -- do you know\nwhat I said to -- I said, \u201cYou are an animal.\u201d I said, \u201cYou behaved appallingly the other\nnight and I don\u2019t ever want to see you again.\u201d So, I mean, looking now at you know, the\ncurrent generations and so on, it\u2019s -- I mean, this is really funny, but -- but in those days, I\nmean, you know, my mother was so puritanical. And -- But it wasn\u2019t just my mother, it\u2019s\njust that she was more so, but I remembered this -- th -- my good friend Barbara, th-the\none who got me into this date, I remember one time -- I don\u2019t know -- I bought a package\nof sanitary napkins or something, and you know, in those days it wasn\u2019t displayed, and so\nthey would wrap it up in a br -- unmarked brown paper bag for you. And so we were in\nthe subway, and Barbara said, \u201cWhat\u2019s in the bag?\u201d And I said in a whisper, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s\nsanitary napkins.\u201d And she got so angry with me because she thought I said that too\nloudly. So, I mean, you know, you have to -- you have to understand what I\u2019m telling you\nin the context of those times. So, anyway -- So then, I think there was a very major\nchange that came. I really revered people who were very educated and who did important\nthings in their field. So, there were a couple of things. I took physics from a guy named\nAl Predell, was the physics teacher\u2019s name, and everybody had a crush on this guy,\nprobably except me, and -- but I kind of liked him, also. And he had a car and I was\ndying to learn how to drive. I mean, I just, mm, that was like uppermost in my mind. And\nthis guy actually let me drive. I -- I got a learner\u2019s permit or whatever, and this guy -- you\nknow, I don\u2019t remember exactly, I -- I think my chemistry teacher, a woman, who just\ndied at age 100, Dr. Stecker, for my graduation bought me driving lesson -- three driving\nlessons, or something like that. And this guy Al Predell, let me take a couple of little\nshort rides in his car, within the parking area. But he was an avid tennis player, and he\nplayed tennis with a professor who was at -- probably at Columbia at the time, whose\nname was Jack Steinberger, who\u2019s now in Switzerland if he\u2019s still alive, which I have no\nreason to believe that he isn\u2019t. Jack Steinberger won a Nobel Prize many years later, but\nJack Steinberger had come, I think from Germany, and had a reputation for being a very\nbrilliant nuclear physicist. So, I would sit on the tennis courts at Barnard sometimes,\nwatching Al Predell play tennis with Jack Steinberger. And then the second year, I was at\nBrookhaven, Jack Steinberger would occasionally turn up to use, I don\u2019t know the\nCosmotron or something. And -- And I was a real Jack Steinberger watcher, because I -- I\n-- you know, I had been told this is a great man. And one night Jack Steinberger asked me\nif I wanted to go for a ride, and I went for a ride with him and he started to make some\nadvances. You know, I mean, he was old enough to be my father -- well, I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe not quite. And I got very angry with him and I said, \u201cI\u2019m s --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: So -- So I gave Jack Steinberger this talking to, about you know, \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to\nbe a brilliant physicist, how could you act this way?\u201d You know, and I\u2019m only telling you\nabout this because I think that moment was a major turning point in my life, because Jack\nSteinberger looked at me in the eye, and he said, \u201cYou know, just because I\u2019m a clever\nphysicist, doesn\u2019t have anything whatsoever to do with the rest of my personality, and\nwhy are you trying to cubby-hole me like this?\u201d And he gave me this long -- I mean, it\nwas almost like an oration, about that I was doing something that didn\u2019t make sense. I\nwas trying to f -- to -- just because he did this one thing that I admired, I was trying to\npan onto that, all sorts of attributes about who he was. So anyway, he gave me this\nspeech, turned around, drove me back to my dorm and -- and that was -- that was that.\nAnd I -- Jack Steinberger appeared once, many years later, when I was with my husband\nin Cambridge, at a little snack bar, and I -- politely we -- we chatted. And then we never\nhad any contact until he won the Nobel Prize, and when he won the Nobel Prize, I knew\nwa -- I somehow periodically knew where he was. I wrote him a letter of congratulations\nand also -- and there was a little bit of correspondence back and forth, in which I -- I sort\nof partly apologized for, you know, being a really naive kid, or -- or something. But --\nBut I have to tell you that inside my inner self -- Jack Steinberger, after -- at some point,\nmarried some woman he had known for four days and had either one or two kids, and\nthen got divorced. And -- And that doesn\u2019t -- you know, to this day, I mean, even though\nmy brother is in his third marriage, and -- and lots of peop -- I mean 90 percent of --\neverybody seems to be divorced, remarried, you know, married five times, and so on and\nso forth. When I think about Jack Steinberger, I have some very positive feelings about --\nabout this very brilliant man who played tennis, but underneath that, there\u2019s a guy who --\nyou know, who did something that was irresponsible. I mean, what [indecipherable] you\nget married after four days? I mean, what kind of stupid thing is that? But -- And -- But I\nthink -- But I think I have Jack Steinberger to thank, in a way, for -- for the fact that I got\nmarried, because he -- he did s -- he snapped something in my way of thinking, that\nallowed me to view things differently from the way I had ever viewed them before.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, first of all, my mother was an avid newspaper reader, so when we first\ncame, she used to read th -- a German paper called The Alfbo, which may still exist. And\nthen she -- then she -- when she could read English, she would read that plus the daily -- I\nthink The Post, she used to read and sometimes The New York Times. I --",
        "A: Alfbo.",
        "A: A German --",
        "A: No, no, no, it\u2019s a German --",
        "A: -- no, it\u2019s published here, but a German language newspaper.",
        "A: So she was very interested in keeping up with the news. She also was very a -- I mean,\nall sh -- you know, we left everybody behind in -- in Europe. I mean, her parents and --\nwere in Poland. Her sister and her sister\u2019s husband and children, her brother and -- you\nknow, and all my father\u2019s relatives were -- were there, except for these two -- My Aunt\nLena Klinghoffer and -- and my -- my father\u2019s brother, my Uncle Jack, and -- who\nspelled his name with an extra f, R-e-1-f-f, for some bizarre reason. So she was always\ntrying to make contact, and she -- she sent Care packages to certain people. You know\nthat place called Care, and they send packages? I don\u2019t remember who, but she often --\nwhen she could afford it, later on, she would send Care packages to certain people. I\u2019m\ntrying to find out what happened to different people, th -- I think there was -- you know\nthat -- telephoning was not easy, the way it is now, and we didn\u2019t -- when we first moved\ninto our apartment in Brooklyn, we didn\u2019t have a telephone for a long time, and then it\nwas, you know, it was very special, having this telephone and -- but you didn\u2019t telephone\nlightly. I mean, you know, where you had, I don\u2019t know, 20 telephone calls a month in --\nin whatever the minimum charge was, but -- so she did try very hard. I was -- I think I\nwas fairly unattached from that whole thing, but -- but what happened 1s, as the years\nwent by in New York, different people would appear. Like this -- this guy I told I you\nwas friends with since four years before I was born, I mean s -- at some time, and I don\u2019t\nremember exactly when, his family, who had gone to Santa Domingo, appeared in New\nYork. And so, all of a sudden, there was this new old friendship that picked up and so\nthey would come to visit us, we would go to visit them. Doctor Kleinfeld, the -- the\nlawyer, we went to visit his family quite often. I mentioned that in the other interview, he\nwas the one who helped us pack the van. And then he died, I don\u2019t remember of what,\nand -- but his -- his second wife, who is the one we -- we knew, lived in New York, we\nvisited her a long time. I pretty much lost track.

Sh -- But she and Irwin\nKleinfeld got divorced after quite a lot of years. They didn\u2019t have any children. Irwin\nKleinfeld remarried, she remarried, her husband\u2019s now very sick.

Th-The first -- The loss of my father, that sank in,\nbecause I heard about that all the time, you know, once a year my mother lit candles. My\nmother wore black for years and years and years. She often reminisced about my father.\nOne of the things that I\u2019m hoping to find one day 1s, unti -- I -- I really -- I -- in -- ina lot\nof ways, I ten -- I guess I grew up like a boy, and so there was sort of a no-no. You\nweren\u2019t supposed to cry.

And now I\u2019m -- \u2019'm\nsorry, and actually, one day, long after I was married and had kids, my mother was up\nhere and she started talking about -- and I -- I was trying to stop her and ma -- and my\nhusband --",
        "A: The past. You know, what happened, my father, etcetera. I -- And I just could never\ncope with that, so -- so I just -- I think I just kind of walked out of the room or something,\nand -- and my husband took a tape recorder and said okay -- we -- we both called her --\nwell, my husband called her grandma, I think, after the kids were born. And he took a\ntape recorder and he had her record a whole tape about her feelings, an -- and I cannot fi -\n- that tape has got to be somewhere in this house, and I cannot find it. Because, of course,\nnow I\u2019m dying to know what were her thoughts and I am extremely angry with myself for\nnot asking her all sorts of questions that I want to know about, and -- but I just could not\nemotionally cope with listening to her, not -- not only because the information was\nhurtful, but because I think I could not cope with watching her dissolve in tears. And\nguess what? At some stage -- and I don\u2019t know when it started to happen, I started\ndissolving in tears, ev -- you know, for certain things and I -- I can\u2019t even define, but\nwhen people talk about certain things -- certain kinds of things that happen, or talk about\ncertain things related to my mother or my father, or -- I -- I just involuntarily start crying\n-- or sometimes if the kids say something.

But why I couldn\u2019t\nlisten to her, you know, spilling out what was hurting her and so on, I think it\u2019s because it\njust made me feel so awful to see her cry and to see her be in that kind of pain. And I --\nAnd I did a very non-adult thing, I mean I -- the adult thing would have been to just sit\nand listen and say something helpful, and -- and my -- my -- my thing was to disappear. I\nwanted to just get the hell out of there.",
        "A: Probably all of the above. I mean, like I\u2019ve been very good this morning, but -- but\nyou could say something, or I could say something and all of a sudden, I just\ndecompensate, as I call it. Sometimes it -- just in recent weeks, listening when I -- you\nknow, I can listen and I can be very stern and all there to the news every night about\nYugoslavia, but sometimes, when I hear or see a picture of the refugees mar-marching\ndown the road, and an old lady in a wheelbarrow or something, I just -- you know, tears\ncome to my eyes and I just --",
        "A: Yes. As a matter of fact, as I was saying to somebody the other day, I think this\nKosovo thing has probably come closer to getting to the real inside of me than anything\nthat\u2019s happened in the intervening times. I mean, every time there is anything about war,\nor violence or anything like that, that absolutely turns my stomach. I mean, I -- I know\nthis is a stupid, naive thing to say, but I ha -- I, to this day, I do not understand how\npeople can call themselves civilized and -- and -- and fight wars. I mean, it\u2019s -- th -- the\nconcept seems so ridiculous that, you know, you shoot me and Ill shoot at you and\nwhoever gets the most guys down, gets to do what they want. And in the meantime -- you\nknow, I wrote a po -- I -- I like to write poetry sometimes, I haven\u2019t done it for a long\ntime, but I used to do it more. I wrote a poem after the Yom Kippur War, in which I tried\nto express that when you have a child, you know, the nine months of gestation is not a big\ndeal, but it\u2019s the next 21 years, when you essentially devote the most incredibly -- I mean,\nif you\u2019re a reasonable parent at least, the most incredible amount of emotional energy, to\ntry to make this fledgling fly. It is -- It\u2019s -- I mean, it\u2019s just an -- it\u2019s the hardest thing that\nI\u2019ve ever, ever done in my life. And the thought that somebody can say, \u201cWell, hey so\ntoday we\u2019re going to have a war, and I\u2019Il shoot a few of your kids, and you\u2019ll shoot a few\nof my kids, and then they\u2019ll be gone.\u201d That is so obscene a thought to me, that I -- I mean,\nI literally, I don\u2019t even have words to express what I feel about that.

About, I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe 13 years ago, I-I -- I generally, for the last 15 or so years, I\u2019ve -- go out -- go out\nrunning in the morning, and I used to have a route along the highway, and --",
        "A: Yeah, it is, yeah.",
        "A: I went out and I was running on Pleasant Street, which 1s a fairly well traveled street,\nand that morning, I saw a cat that looked virtually exactly like this black cat, which 1s our\ndaughter\u2019s cat, and it had even that same little kink at the end of the tail, and it had been\nrun over. I saw that cat, and I started to -- I mean, it was more than weeping, it was\nalmost screaming and I came running home here, and I was -- I think my daughter was\nactually here, and I -- I just came up and I sat on the bed next to my husband and I -- I\nwas just literally falling apart, I was just weeping and weeping and weeping,\nuncontrollably. And then the cat, our cat, came back into the house. So my husband and I\n-- so I calmed down, my husband and I went and buried this other cat, but something\nhappened to me that day, and I don\u2019t know what it was, but I\u2019ve always thought to myself\nthat no matter how horrible -- and I -- this may not be true, but -- but the thought in my\nhead is that -- that I would never, ever be that upset again, no matter what happened. That\n-- That I would -- That I would just never, ever crack up like that again.",

But again, I mean, that was -- you know, that was just some real\nchange, I mean, like the thing that happened with Jack Steinberger, which allowed me to\nget on with -- I don\u2019t -- you know, some other level of living. But -- But when the cat --\nWhen I found that dead cat that day, I -- I just -- I mean, I went berserk in a way that I\ndon\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever gone berserk before. And -- And something just snapped and I --\nand since then -- I mean, you know, people that I know have died and bad things have\nhappened and -- but I -- I don\u2019t think I have ever again been at that incredible whatever it\nwas.

        "A: Well, I -- I ca -- It couldn\u2019t have been just about the cat, because you know, I re -- we\nhad a wonderful, wonderful Siberian Husky dog, for about 12 years, and I just absolutely\nadored that dog and that dog -- one night my husband -- well, he was -- she was very\narthritic and one day my husband took her out for a walk and he let her off the leash,\nwhich he almost never did, and she walked away and never came back. And my son and I\nsat and cried together, and -- you know, but 1t wasn\u2019t -- it wasn\u2019t that same thing.

And I was thinking, you know,\nwhen I was preparing for the interview and thinking about talking to you, you know, one\nquestion came to my mind, and -- and I wonder if it -- it forms your memory of this time,\nor even maybe your views, subsequently, of the world is, you know, being on the San\nLouis and -- and not having a place to get off, I mean, it\u2019s such a horrible and almost like\nmythological story, you know. And I was wondering, you know, in your mind, in your\nheart, li -- did you have a sense or do you have sense now of what -- what kind of world\nis it, that doesn\u2019t let people get off that ship?",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know that I thought about it at the time, but -- and my brother\ncertainly thought a lot about it, but I think about it a lot now, because -- and especially\nwith the Kosovo situation. I mean, I often wonder about -- you know, I -- what kind --\nthis is really a funny world, you know, we have borders. And I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve been\nasked to lecture about five times now in the former Soviet Union, and this last trip, which\nwas the first week of May, I -- I didn\u2019t feel this so much this time, but the other trips, I\ncertainly felt -- actually, I was very apprehensive before this trip, I was very apprehensive\nbefore this trip, but then once I left, 1-it was -- it was okay, but the other trips, I don\u2019t\nknow, more funny things happened, and you see police people with machine guns.

        "A: Yes, or guns. I really do not like guns.",
        "A: It makes me ner -- It makes me nervous and it also makes me angry. Guns can hurt\npeople. An-And we were just having this discussion the other night, guns can hurt people\nin a very impersonal way. Oh, I -- It was my son who was saying that, that, you know, if\nyou -- I -- they were talking about gun control and I said, \u201cOh well, you know, big deal.\nSo they take away the guns, they\u2019Il do it some other way.\u201d And my son said, \u201cWell, you\nknow, it\u2019s a little hard when you have to kind of actually go up and physically grab\nsomebody,\u201d he said. \u201cWith a gun, it\u2019s very impersonal, you can stay far away, you can\nget a lot of people at once,\u201d and so on. I -- The idea of -- of people hurting other people,\neven emotionally, but -- but certainly physically, is extremely abhorsen to me. I mean, it -\n- We have come such a long way, you know. I look around me, we send somebody to the\nmoon, we have televisions, we have CD\u2019s, now we have mini CD\u2019s, you know, we keep\nmaking progress. We do all these wonderful things. And then we turn around and kill\neach other. Does that make sense? I mean, there\u2019s something bizarrely inappropriate\nabout -- about that. And I guess -- I mean, people sometimes challenge me on -- on -- on\nthat, but I guess -- I don\u2019t know, I guess I value brain power a lot, and I don\u2019t want to see\nanybody killed or -- or hurt or anything, but -- but I have some funny feelings inside\nwhen somebody really worthwhile gets killed, and then there are all these people around\nwho are costing society money, and causing troub --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning of Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: If somebody -- some ridiculous person goes out and kills off some wonderful person,\nwho\u2019s making fantastic contributions to society, etcetera, that -- I mean, I\u2019m very\ndemocratic, but that makes me even more angry, because you know, like -- all right, if\nyou don\u2019t want to do anything constructive and you want to go to some island and send\nall people who want to be on drugs, and not do anything constructive, and you want to go\nthere and you want to fight each other all the time, you know, go, be my guest, do it. Kull\nyourselves off, you know, do whatever you want. But just don\u2019t bother the people who\nare trying to be constructive and who are using their brain power to make the world a\nbetter place to live in. I mean it -- it -- you know, if you take -- an-and of course, in a war\n-- in a war situation, what do you do? You take the -- the cream of your population, you\ntake the people who are, you know, 20 to 30. In the sciences, those -- that\u2019s the -- that\u2019s\nthe place where, for example, in physics, that\u2019s the time when people make their\ncontributions. So you take this -- this group of people at the absolute apex of their time to\ncontribute and to -- to do wonderful things and you -- you pop them off? I mean, 1-1t\u2019s --\nit\u2019s not a good thing for me to talk about because I -- you know, I mean, there\u2019s another\npart of me that says yeah, you know, I mean, people are -- I mean, why do I expect\npeople to be different from all the other animals? You know, you -- you watch channel\ntwo, or you watch the Nature channel and you know, this animal eats that next animal\ndown, that\u2019s a little smaller and a little slower and so on and so forth. And after all, we\u2019re\njust evolved from those. So why am I surprised, you know? But then I said, but you\nknow, but tions and ligers, and -- ta -- lions and tigers don\u2019t invent, you know,\nCosmotrons and airplanes and spaceships and so on and so forth. So -- So we are a little\ndifferent. Well, if we are a little different, why don\u2019t we act as though we are a little bit\nmore civilized than those other species? But we don\u2019t. You know, people get into bar\nroom brawls, and -- and they get drunk and they waste their lives and they --",
        "A: Well, first of all, that\u2019s -- yeah, I\u2019m not a very trusting person. I\u2019m -- I guess, in some\nways, I\u2019m a very suspicious person. I mean, in some ways, I\u2019m very trusting, but on the\nwhole, I\u2019m not very trusting. I think the San Louis business had a very major effect on\nme, but not -- not in a direct, obvious way, but -- I mean, first of all, I sit here now, at my\npresent age of almost 65, and look back on it and think, you know, yeah, I mean, you\nknow, this is a ca -- this is supposed to be a country, give me your tired, your poor, and\nhere were 900 people who -- I mean, anybody who had any ounce of brain in their head\nwould have known what the probable fate of these people were if they got sent back to\nEurope. You know -- So I keep asking myself, I mean, what would it have hurt anybody\nto let these people in? And most people had visas to the U.S. anyway. They -- It was just\n-- I mean, ours was like six months from coming due. But then, on the other hand, I --\nyou know, my rational self takes over and I say, \u201cWell, maybe they can\u2019t do that,\nbecause, you know, what if everybody in the whole wide world wanted to move to the\nU.S.? That wouldn\u2019t work, so what do you do? And I don\u2019t know the answer and I\u2019m a\nvery non-political animal. But I think the more important thing that shaped me, for better\nor worse, 1s that we did have to go back and we did go through this experience in France,\nand coming here, and I think those events, very, very much shaped a lot of my views.\nAnd my brother always says, you know, we are stronger because we survived all those\nthings, than we would have been if none of this had happened.",
        "A: I think -- Well, I think I owe my brother something for this, but also, I think it taught\nme that, you know, people are people and they, unfortunately, speak different languages,\nwhich makes life interesting, but -- but more bellicose. Because when you don\u2019t speak the\nsame language, you can\u2019t even explain to the other person, usually, you know, how\nyou\u2019re feeling about something. So -- But I got to meet people in -- you know, a lot of\ndifferent cities, a lot of different places. I got bounced around and I learned that, you\nknow, wherever I went, there were some people who were wonderful, and there were\nsome people who were kind of just there, and there were some people who were slightly\non the disgusting side. And I think the most important thing that I learned was to -- I\nmean sh -- of course I generalize often, you know, in conversation, but I don\u2019t really\ngeneralize in my -- in my own head. I don\u2019t -- And when I do, I -- every time, I will pull\nmyself back. If I say, \u201cOh my God, those CPA\u2019s are so, you know, something or other,\nbecause I -- I give a lecture to a group of CPA\u2019s once a year and they seem so boring.\nAnd so I[\u2019Il say -- I'll -- I mean a thought like that may cross my mind and then -- and\nthen I always pull myself back and say, you know, not all CPA\u2019s are that way and -- and -\n- and everybody\u2019s different and you really have to meet each person and get to know that\nperson, and not make a judgment, and -- and I\u2019m not really making a judgment, I mean\nit\u2019s just kind of a comment that -- so I think -- I think -- I think that whole scenario taught\nme to be resilient in a lot of ways, taught me to -- to be, I hope, fairly open-minded.\nTaught me to be reasonably liberal. I just learned a lot. I guess mostly taught me to be\nresilient. Taught me to be able to shift on a dime, often. You know, taught me to do what\nneeds to be done and -- and try to get on with things as best as possible.",

I wrote my mother every day. Now, she didn\u2019t\nget those things every day, unfortunately, you know, she\u2019d get nothing for a week and,\nyou know -- and now when I think back on it, I think, \u201cOh my God, what did I do to her?\nHow could I have done that to her?\u201d To -- To leave her worrying all the time, cause she\nmust -- she was undoubtedly worried all the time, and -- but I -- I didn\u2019t understand in\nthose days, what is she worrying about, you know? As a matter of fact, she would always\nbe worried when I came home alone at night after dark and I thought, \u201cWhat the hell is\nshe worrying about?\u201d You know, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m just walking from the subway,\u201d you\nknow, and -- it wasn\u2019t real -- it wasn\u2019t until I was in college and I had an unpleasant\nincident with a guy following me, when I was in college, that really got me scared, that I\nrealized for the first time, why my mother was worried. But, I try not to worry about my\nchildren, and I have a lot -- I always have a lot of work to do and that\u2019s a very good thing\nfor me, because I get very involved in my work. But, there\u2019s that voice that comes in. I\nmean, for example, I try not to make the kids call me, okay, very often. But now our\nson\u2019s been -- been sick and now I\u2019m sort of more worried, so now I say, well just for this\nperiod, it\u2019s all right for me to ask him to call. That was him calling to tell me that he had\narrived where he was going. Our daughter right now 1s 1n Israel, and I ha -- I must say\nI\u2019ve been very good for her being 1n Israel, for these few weeks, partly because I\u2019m so\nworried about our son that it\u2019s kind of a diversion for me. But then, a few days go by and\nif I haven\u2019t heard from her, there are all these things that start. It\u2019s almost like a cash\nregister tape. What if s-such and such happened? You know, maybe this happened,\nmaybe that happened. And I just -- I mean, I just have to live with that, and I try as -- as\nhard as I can, to not -- to not make them aware of that any more than is necessary, to not\nmake that a burden to them, the way it was a burden to me, that my mother always\nworried about me. But you know, our daughter -- bo-both of our kids are -- are -- are very\nwith it. And -- And our -- our daughter is a very clever young lady. And so one day she\nsaid something about this, and I said, \u201cWell, you know, I have tried very hard to not, you\nknow, do to you what my mother did to me.\u201d And she looked at me and she said, \u201cMa,\nwho do you think you\u2019re kidding?\u201d She said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything and we\nknow exactly what you\u2019re thinking. We know exactly when you\u2019re worried, you don\u2019t\nhave to say one word.\u201d And -- And you know, and they\u2019ve been very good about it. I\nmean, I try very hard, when things are normal, I try to bite my tongue and I try very hard,\nwhen they were living at home, to not say call me, you know, or something. So\nsometimes I\u2019ve made an agreement, if you\u2019re not going to be home by one, would you\ngive me a call? So that\u2019s my exterior and that\u2019s the way I want it to be for the kids. But\nbehind the scenes, hoo. First of all, I\u2019m a very punctual person, in the Germanic way, you\nknow. And my brother, wuh, my brother and this other German kid, when they were both\nat Columbia college, would meet each other on Saturdays at noon. This guy would pace\nthe street downstairs and at exactly noon, Meridian time, our bell would ring. And if I\ntold my brother I was meeting him at 12:06, and I was one minute late, he would look at\nme very sternly and say, \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d So -- So I grew up with that, okay? So, you come\non time. If -- And this has happened many times, and my broth -- my husband is\nwonderful with this, because he generally does not -- it takes a lot to start him worrying.\nSo, one of our kids goes out, they say they\u2019Il be home at about one. So I\u2019m fine, more or\nless, until one. At 1:05, something starts happening in my body, that I can\u2019t describe to\nyou. By 1:10 it\u2019s getting worse and by 1:15, I\u2019m in bad shape.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s as though there are seven million ants crawling inside of me, or I -- I\nmean, I can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t even describe it, and then I start saying to my husband, \u201cDo you\nthink we should call?\u201d And my husband says, \u201cNo, they\u2019ll -- they\u2019re fine.\u201d And then I --\nyou know, so I wait another 15 minutes and then this thing has --",
        "A: Su -- At the very end stages, my stomach starts churning, it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s like a total\nbody discomfort. And then -- And I get more and more anxious and -- and then my\nhusband starts listing all the reasons why they\u2019re late. And the funny thing is, I\u2019m a very\ngood learner, except for this, because 99 percent of the time, when they get home, my\nhusband has hit on one of the reasons why they\u2019re late. And it\u2019s always some very\nlegitimate thing. But I start to no longer -- after -- actually, our kids are very good and\nthey rarely are more than half an hour late without calling. They really are wonderful. So\nit\u2019s very rare that I get to this extreme stage, but I listen to his -- to my husband\u2019s\nrationale, and then it gets worse and worse and then it sort of star -- I start to de-focus\nfrom that. I can all of a sudden no longer focus on all those rational explanations. And\none of the really horrible, horrible things that -- that I did to myself once, which has never\ngone away is, there was a program on television and I -- I watched it -- I don\u2019t know why\nI watched it, I just -- I don\u2019t know, I was tired or something, and it was -- it was\napparently a true story. It was about a woman with a professional husband, I think maybe\nher husband was a doctor or something and the kid goes to buy something at a -- maybe\nin an electronics store and the mother gets worried. It was on PBS, I think. The mother\ngets worried and she says to the father, \u201cI\u2019m worried about this -- my son.\u201d And the\nfather says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019ll be home soon,\u201d you know. And the mother gets just -- it\nwas -- it was an almost exact depiction of what I feel, and finally the mother says, \u201cI\u2019m\ngoing to see where he is.\u201d And the mother goes and she follows his tracks and -- and\nfigures out where he 1s and she walks into this electronics store, which -- and there are\nsome really bad criminals who have come in, and tied everybody on the floor, and\nthey\u2019ve actually -- and the mother actually gets killed, but the son survives and the --\nthese -- these criminals have tied everybody up and they -- I don\u2019t know, they robbed the\nstore or something, but they -- they pour lye down everybody\u2019s throat that they\u2019ve tied\nup. And that mo -- that program has never left me, because every time now that I -- you\nknow, this must have been 10 years ago, that I have this conversation with my husband,\nand he says everything\u2019s all right, immediately this -- this movie pops into my head. And\nat the end of that movie, you see the son, who is sort of damaged, but he\u2019s kind of all\nright, with his father, talking about that this is a real story, and this is what happened.\nAnd I -- I just replay that scene. Oh yeah, there\u2019s the father saying everything\u2019s fine, and\nthe mother, in her gut, knew that something was wrong and -- and so that now gets\nreplayed in my head, on top of all the normal stuff that gets replayed. So I -- And then --\nAnd then the last stages, if they\u2019re not home and it\u2019s now 45 minutes, or an hour, which\nas I say, happens very rarely, sometimes I will just crack up and weep. You know, and\nmy husband will sit there and he\u2019!l comfort me and then the phone rings and -- and all of\na sudden, I come to absolute attention and you can hear nothing -- I make sure you can\nhear nothing of that in my voice, and kid says, \u201cSorry Mom, I got involved in this, you\nknow, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m just leaving for home.\u201d And I s -- \u201cFine, did you have a good time?\nGreat. Thanks for calling me, I really appreciate it.\u201d And I hang up, you know, and then I\ncan finish kind of curing myself from the episode that has just transpired.",
        "A: It is powerful stuff, but I don\u2019t want you -- I want you to know that I live a reasonably\nnormal life despite that, and I\u2019m a very productive person and things like this don\u2019t\nhappen all that often. And as I say, I have been -- I mean, now my daughter\u2019s in Israel,\nand guess what? She\u2019s in Israel, she\u2019s in Israel. All these horrible things happen in Israel.\nYou know, bombs go -- get thrown into buses and you know, and I [indecipherable]. And\nmy friends tell me, well, you know, actually, if you look at the statistics, Israel is safer\nthan New York City, and you know -- and I try to tell myself and you know, and so on.\nBut when she calls, it\u2019s like this miraculously happy event. And she\u2019s -- she\u2019s been very\ngood. You know, she -- she has called ev -- once a week. This week she sent me an e-\nmail after sh -- three days after she called, and -- you know, but now she\u2019s gone down to\nAilot and I hope sometime this weekend, I\u2019ll get a call. Damon\u2019s going out to drive to --\nto Amherst. If I go and drive, I mean, I think nothing of it. And both of our kids are good\ndrivers, but there\u2019s always that niggling -- you know, and I think this is because I had this\nfather, and one day he never came back again. And I think there\u2019s something deep down\ninside of me that is forever scared of that ever happening again. My husband goes off on\nhis bicycle to work. He\u2019s had -- you know, he\u2019s bicycled safely for, I don\u2019t know, 10\nyears now, but he has had two somewhat not pleasant accidents, but not, you know, not\nhorrible, horrible. Now, I tell him, \u201cLook, you\u2019re a grown-up and I can\u2019t do anything bad\nto you as a grown-up. So you got to call me the minute you get to work.\u201d And he\u2019s very\ngood about that, I mean, the minute he gets to work, he calls. And that was, at first, very\nshort phone call. \u201cHello, I\u2019m here.\u201d \u201cOkay, bye.\u201d And then, at night -- at night, it\u2019s dark,\nthere are lights, there are cars, can they see him? It\u2019s harder. Last night he came home 15\nminutes later than he said he would, which 1s pretty -- not very usual. So, he said he\u2019d be\nhome at 7:30. So at 7:32, I looked at the clock and by that time Damon had come back\nfrom Amherst, and -- so at least -- so I wasn\u2019t alone. When I\u2019m alone, my imagination is\na lot worse than when there\u2019s somebody else there. But, I\u2019m still watching the clock, so\n7:35, I shouldn\u2019t say anything. 7:40 -- \u201cI wonder where dad is,\u201d out loud. Damon -- I\ndon\u2019t know whether Damon even noticed that I said that or not. 7:41, I\u2019m up at the\nbedroom window, looking out to see if there\u2019s any sign of him. \u201cLiane, Damon\u2019s here,\nyou can\u2019t stay up here and watch at the window, because there\u2019s no point in worrying\nhim.\u201d So I come back down to the kitchen, and at 7:45, I hear the -- the door opening, so -\n- and it\u2019s okay.",
        "A: Then it\u2019s all fine. Then it\u2019s all fine. But I -- But, you know, except for those few\nminutes, I go up there, I look -- I look out the window. Maybe sometimes I waste a\ncouple of more minutes, cause I\u2019Il run down to the door or something. But I need you to\nknow that 95, or 99 percent of the time, I\u2019m productive and I\u2019m working and I\u2019m -- you\nknow, I\u2019m either making dinner or cleaning up, or doing work work -- you know,\nprofessional work or -- but these images invade. It\u2019s like a kind of a Star Wars thing, you\nknow it -- it\u2019s like the spaceship comes through and goes out the other side, because I\nforce it to go out the other side.",
        "A: It\u2019s hard to discuss them, because they\u2019re very unpleasant images. They\u2019re -- They\u2019re\nof something horrible happening. And I -- I -- I am -- So far, Iam very good at making\nthem go away again. So the images that come, if I\u2019m sitting and reading this and s -- and\nI get some horrible image coming through my head, it\u2019s in and out within, you know, one\nsecond. And -- And I -- And I just keep working, so -- so actually, I\u2019m quite a productive\nperson, and I have not let that bother me, except that it bothers me that it happened. You\nknow, it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s not a pleasant way to live. And I -- I hope that -- you know, our --\nI\u2019ve discussed this with our children, because -- you know, because I\u2019ve tried to explain\nto them that sometimes when I start crying, you know, I don\u2019t know what it is and it\u2019s out\nof my control and I never did this when I was younger and I hope this will not happen to\nyou and I apologize. And I think it gets diluted out. But anyway, I started telling you\nbefore that I wrote this poem after the -- the -- the Yom Kippur War, and I -- I wrote in\nthat poem that -- about how all -- all the energy and all the emotion that you put into\nbringing up a child, and then somebody can pop that child off in -- 1n one second, in a\nwar, on a highway, whatever, and I -- and -- and th -- I think most people don\u2019t -- don\u2019t\nthink about this. And I'll tell you something else that I think about very often. I learned\nthis in first grade, in PS 241. We had to memorize these little sayings. And one of the\nsayings that I had to memorize was, \u201cA coward dies a thousand times, a brave man only\nonce.\u201d I don\u2019t think a week goes by that I don\u2019t think about that, because I tell myself,\nyou know, normal people don\u2019t live this way. Normal people live their lives, they\u2019re\nhappy, they do their thing. One day something comes up, it\u2019s very bad news, they deal\nwith it and then they go on. And you\u2019re a coward, I say to myself, because you deal with\nall of these things in your imagination, a zillion times a year, you know. So -- So I die a\nthousand times, instead of just once. You know, but I mean da -- then I start asking\nquestions, well, you know, why is that? Is it all that, is it other things? And I -- And I\nthink it -- it kind of started with that whole Holocaust business and my father\u2019s\ndisappearance. But then, you know, other people do things like -- people are generally\nnot very thoughtful, and so when I came to New York, my mother was working in the\nfactory and then my f -- brother left for school and he would be away all day, even when\nhe was still going to Columbia and living at home. And so one day, I\u2019m sitting alone in\nthe house, I think I was doing homework, and a telegram arrives. Now, that was pretty\nunusual in those days. Telegram. So I open this telegram and it says, \u201cMother dead.\u201d And\nI -- I must have been eight years old, maybe nine and I did an emotional flip. Because I\ndon\u2019t know that I had ever seen a telegram before, first of all. Maybe -- Maybe I had, but\nI didn\u2019t even --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: So I got this telegram, and it said, \u201cMother dead,\u201d and I didn\u2019t even notice that, you\nknow, I don\u2019t -- in these days, they probably don\u2019t do that, but in those days, th-they\nwould tape these little things on, and I didn\u2019t even notice that there was a name on the bo\n-- you know, two lines down, that somebody had glued on. I mean, I just read those\nwords, mother dead, and I just assumed that 1t was my mother. And I don\u2019t remember\nhow I resolved this. I might have gone to a neighbor\u2019s house or something, or -- or maybe\nI just finally noticed the thing, but I -- I mean, I was a basket case for awhile there. And\nthen I -- I guess the other thing which didn\u2019t help was that my mother -- after I was born,\nmy mother had gall bladder problems and in those days gall bladder surgery was not\ntrivial. And then the war came anyway, so she lived for 30 years with this gall bladder.\nAnd she would have these attacks and sometimes an ambulance would come. But she\nwould look -- I mean -- and especially after my brother left, and I was alone, you know, I\nwould be absolutely terrified, because here I was, this little girl all by myself and my only\n-- my -- my only means of survival was this woman. And she would get these horrendous\nattacks, which our son was just getting, recently. But anyway, that\u2019s a whole other story,\nbut anyway, so -- so I think I -- I lived -- I lived in a kind of -- I mean, again, I wasn\u2019t\naware of it all the time, but when it happened, it was so scary. You know, that, oh my\nGod, 1s this g -- the end of this, and I\u2019m going -- you know, I\u2019m going to end up all by\nmyself, and wa -- what do I do? You know, what do you -- and I mean, I think a nine year\nold in 1999, who\u2019s watched a lot of television, might be able to say, \u201cOh, well that\u2019s all\nright, you know, Ill go work as a cashier, or do something.\u201d But there was no television\nand I, from the reading that I did, I had no -- you know, I had no recourse in my head of\nwhat -- what do you do if you end up all by yourself as a little girl? So that was another\nthing that was pretty scary.",
        "A: I -- I wouldn\u2019t say I think about it a lot, but I do think about it from time to time. My\nmother was sort of in a state of shock when she read this. It was one of those -- I think it\nwas one of those air-o-gram things, you know, and it detailed -- it was horrible, and then\nmy mother read it to me.",
        "A: What I remember is it was written by a cousin of -- of hers, I think. I think 1t was\nwritten by a guy names Moshe -- Moshe what? I don\u2019t remember. Moshe -- I don\u2019t\nremember, but anyway, he ultimately moved to Israel. And he detailed what happened to\nall my mother\u2019s relatives, and so my mother was reading this to me, about how her sister\nhad been forced to watch, while they threw her children into an oven, and then they shot\nher. And my mother\u2019s brother had, I think three children. I think my mother\u2019s sister\nmaybe had two children. I think the brother might have had three children, and that they -\n- there was somebody in the concentration camp where they were, who had typhoid or\ntyphus, one -- one of those two bad diseases, and that a lot of people in the camp were\nsnuggling up to these people, so that they would c-contract the disease and be able to die\nof a disease, rather than what was obviously going to happen. And -- And so that\u2019s how\nthose people met their end. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t remember -- I don\u2019t think he detailed, except\nthat my mother\u2019s parents were killed, but -- in a concentration camp, but I don\u2019t think he\nknew. I don\u2019t remember exactly what happened to them. But he -- you know, he went\nthrough this litany of what happened to everybody that she knew. And I -- I do think\nabout that. I mean, I think about that, as I say, not so often, but when I do think about it, I\nthink, you know, \u201cH-How could she have stood that?\u201d I mean, can you imagine? I mean,\nmy brother is now 72, I guess, or -- let\u2019s see, I\u2019m going to be 65, so he\u2019s 72 and a half, or\nalmost 72 and a half, and well, this is another thing, I mean this is another abnormal thing\nthat I have always lived with, and that 1s -- I wrote about this in -- in an article I wrote for\nthe -- for Boston Magazine in 1988. When I say good-bye to somebody, that is rarely an\neasy thing, because there is always this thing -- and I remember when my brother used to\nvisit, cause I -- I really -- I was very, very close to my brother. Whenever I saw him off at\nthe airport, and he\u2019d go through that door, onto the airplane, there\u2019s always that thought,\nis this the last time? You know, and now, I mean, he\u2019s getting older, and-- and every time\nI go away or I do something, I -- although I feel -- I feel more equipped to cope with it\nnow. I mean, I -- now, I-I think, \u201cOh, I\u2019m 65, you know. I could go any day, my husband\ncould go any day, and my brother could certainly go any day,\u201d and you know, and I -- it\u2019s\nstill very scary, but it\u2019s not as scary as it was when I was younger. But every time I --\nthere\u2019s always that thought, you know, is this the last time I\u2019m talking to this person? Is\nthis the last time I\u2019m seeing this person? And I\u2019m sure that has -- has got to go back to --\nto what happened with my father, you know? I mean, a --",
        "A: Yeah, but I think it was more my father, of -- you know, and so I think, \u201cWell, how\ncould my mother stand?\u201d I mean, I don\u2019t know whether she was close to her brothers and\nsisters, but you know, you -- it was kind of a reasonably close knit family, and -- and so,\nhow could she stand listening? You know, I mean, even when I repeat, and say they held\nmy mother\u2019s sister, while they threw her children into an oven. I mean, you know, foof.\nYou know, even just when I repeat that, or think it to myself -- I mean, that is a -- a kind\nof unfathomable thought. So -- So when I -- I mean I -- you know, it just totally gorks me\nout when I -- when I think about that letter. And again -- and then I\u2019m also bothered that,\nwhy don\u2019t I have that letter? Where did that letter go? That letter -- That letter might be\nsomewhere even in this house, although I don\u2019t know. You know, when my mother got\nAlzheimer\u2019s, she started throwing out things and writing over things and so on. So I -- I\ndon\u2019t know. But where did that letter go? I\u2019d like to see that letter again. And I don\u2019t\nknow if I ever will find it. But --\nyou -- Do you feel that -- that you\u2019re -- you\u2019re living more than one life in a sense? That\nyou\u2019re living life for -- for -- for those who -- that -- that you have an extra responsibility,\nan extra burden? Do -- Do you have that with you?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I think about that every day, but -- but yeah, when I think about it and\nwhen I have to write, or when I\u2019m thinking about something about the past. I mean, I do\nfeel that I have to pack a lot into every day. I -- I\u2019m just -- I\u2019m just now starting to even\nthink about, I wonder what it would be like to retire, you know? And -- And I\u2019m just\nstarting to think -- for example, last week I felt a cold coming on, and of course, when I\nwas a kid, you know, if -- 1f you remember from the -- from the -- the video interview,\nmy mother would say, \u201cStay home.\u201d And my brother would say, \u201cTake two hankies and\ngo to school.\u201d",
        "A: Right. And so all my life, I have -- I -- it -- colds get less as you get older, thank\ngoodness, but I get really bad colds. I don\u2019t feel so bad, but I look awful. My eyes are --\nyou know, are like buckets and my nose and it gets red and horrible and these -- the\nwonderful invention of lanolin tissues has helped a lot, but -- but I -- I yust, you know,\nI\u2019m -- my head is just so rrrrr. And a few years ago, one day, I -- I -- I got a cold and I\njust discovered that if -- if I -- if I keep working, but I\u2019m staying in a prone posi -- ina\nreclining position, horizontal position, that it\u2019s not so bad. And so I spent two whole days\nworking in this chair that we just bought for my back, actually, but where I can be lying\ndown and still be reading and writing at the same time. And then the cold really doesn\u2019t\nbother me at all, you know. And -- And also -- I mean, usually, all my life, \u2019ve worked,\nyou know, most days, most evenings, a lot on weekends. Not that we don\u2019t take time off\nto have -- you know, to do nice things, mind you, but -- but when I\u2019m not doing\nsomething specifically, I\u2019m working. And now, in these last six months, with my son, I\nmean, we\u2019ve been watching a movie like practically every night. And it\u2019s not necessarily\na thoughtful movie, because he -- it turns out he has Crohn\u2019s disease and so we try to find\ncomedies. And sometimes they\u2019re re -- they\u2019re ki -- I mean, we try to find good\ncomedies, but sometimes we\u2019ve been watching things that are kind of stupid, just to kind\nof keep his mind occupied, and -- and -- and we sit next to him. So we\u2019ve been working\nless hard during that time, and I -- I\u2019m just suddenly thinking, you know, I don\u2019t -- except\non a summer vacation or something, I don\u2019t take enough time to smell the flowers. And\nthat\u2019s not really true, because I really do. I mean, I -- I\u2019m very aware when those lilies\ncome out, that I\u2019ve got to go smell those. And I -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m all -- I\u2019m extremely aware of\nthe passage of time. There\u2019s a -- There\u2019s a wonderful poem by A. E. Housman, called,\n\u201cWhen I was One and Twenty,\u201d in which he says, \u201cand since to look at things in bloom,\n50 springs are little room, about the woodland I will go, to see the cherry hung with\nsnow.\u201d So I\u2019m always aware that, you know, when the snow is freshly fallen, I have to go\nand look at it and touch it, and -- but I don\u2019t spend a lot of time just sitting down and\ncontemplating. Now, I think that\u2019s because I\u2019m busy leading a lot of different lives, and\ntrying to accomplish a lot of different things. But sometimes, I also ask myself, maybe\nI\u2019m rushing around and doing all th-these things that keep me busy, because if I just sat in\na grassy field and allowed myself to just free associate, maybe -- I would spend a little\ntime having some wonderful daydreams, but then maybe some of the nightmares would\nstart creeping in and that maybe wouldn\u2019t be -- I -- I don\u2019t know, I mean I -- that\u2019s just\nconjectural.",
        "A: [hardly ever dream, and when I do dream, I feel totally unrested in the morning. I\nmean, I know everybody dreams, but what I\u2019m trying to tell you 1s, I\u2019m not aware that I\ndream. When I have dreamt, it\u2019s almost always in black and white. I\u2019ve only ha -- as far\nas I know, I\u2019ve only had one Technicolor dream in my life, and it was -- 1t was a very\nscary dream, of somebody running after me. My husband tells me that I sometimes seem\nto be dreaming at night and - -and you know, wince or cry or something, you know. But\nI\u2019m -- I\u2019m usually unaware of it in the morning. So I don\u2019t dream very much, and that\u2019s --\nI think that\u2019s been an incredible blessing, is my fantastically wonderful sleep habits.\nBecause I -- I -- I really get a lot out of my sleep. I don\u2019t sleep a lot of hours.",
        "A: I\u2019ve actually been sleeping more lately, but I think throughout my life, I probably\ndon\u2019t often sleep more than six hours. I mean, I tend to go to sleep quite late, and I\u2019m\nusually up by somewhere between 7:30 and eight. And sometimes if a client gives me\nsomething to do, or if I have something to do -- now that\u2019s something that\u2019s changed\nrecently. I used to stay up until, you know, like five in the morning, that wa -- not\nuncommonly, and still get up, but -- and in the last maybe five years or so, my husband\nhas started going to sleep, sort of between midnight and one. And unless I -- I have to do\nsomething, I start to get this uncomfortable feeling. I'll be sitting at my computer, and\nhe\u2019ll come down and kiss me goodnight, and go up to bed and -- and I used to just say\nokay, and -- you know, and then -- I -- and then I\u2019d get right back into it, and keep going.\nAnd now, there\u2019s something that happens, and I -- I actually feel a little irritated at people\naround me for this, but I start to feel, oh, I\u2019m too old to do this. I -- I -- I better get -- I\nbetter go up and go to sleep. And I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really anything that\u2019s\nchanged physiologically, but I think it\u2019s hearing people constantly say, \u201cWhat? You go to\nsleep at two o\u2019clock in the morning? I\u2019m in bed by nine o\u2019clock at night.\u201d You know, and\nI -- I think it\u2019s like that -- the -- the economics guy at Harvard, the tall -- Galbraith wrote\nan article in the newspaper about something he called the still syndrome. He says, you\nknow, part of the reason that you age is that as you get on in life, people keep asking,\n\u201cOh, do you still walk? Do you still run?\u201d And if you look at a pretty woman, \u201cOh, are\nyou still interested?\u201d And he calls that the still syndrome. And I feel a little as though I\u2019m\nmaybe getting victimized a little, by other people telling me that I should no longer be\ndoing what I\u2019m doing, and that maybe it\u2019s somehow getting to me, because by and large,\nI\u2019m usually in bed by one o\u2019clock and -- and I turn off the light by, you know, 1:30 or --\nor something. And -- And I don\u2019t stay up m-much later than that, unless there\u2019s a\npressure.",
        "A: No, no, I know, but the thing is that I\u2019m not --",
        "A: -- you know, and I -- I -- I never needed a lot of sleep and I\u2019m generally quite perky.\nAnd I think there is something that the society and the people around me are doing to me\nthat\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- maybe that\u2019s a rationalization, I don\u2019t know, but --",
        "A: I\u2019m still working on it, but first of all, I don\u2019t have a lot of time, and I -- for example,\nyou know, I really thought somehow, that I was going to maybe slow down on my work\nwork life and pay more attention to this, and then this thing came up with our son. And so\nnow, I\u2019m doing even less work work. There are a couple of things that have happened\nwith that project. First of all, I\u2019m very success oriented, and I\u2019m -- I didn\u2019t try very hard,\nbut I made a couple of stabs some years ago, at finding a publisher, and I didn\u2019t find a\npublisher, and that got me to put the project on the back burner. I know myself well\nenough to know that if I got a publisher tomorrow, I\u2019d be in there working til five o\u2019clock\nin the morning. I mean, I -- I -- I know that. So that was one thing that happened. The\nsecond thing that happened was that I -- maybe my project was overly ambitious to begin\nwith, and about a year before, Simon Shallma, who was a history professor at Harvard,\nwho moved to Columbia, I had a meeting with him, because h-he -- when he was in high\nschool, he had written an article for the London Times, when he was living in England,\nabout the San Louis, and -- and he gave a talk at our library and I started to talk to him\nand I asked him if I could meet with him, and I told him about what I was trying to do\nwith my San Louis book. And he made some very interesting suggestions for paring\ndown the project. So then I kind of rethought the project and decided that he was right,\nthat I couldn\u2019t do -- I mean, my original project was to try to incorporate stories from --\nthat I'd collected from 40 people and that\u2019s not going to fly. He suggested that I pick five\nto seven stories and -- and that I put my chapter about the reunion, which I had coming at\nthe end, that I should put it up at the front, and he made a lot of interesting suggestions.",
        "A: But then I st -- I was working on my brother\u2019s chapter, because -- and I had\ninterviewed my brother, my brother did not want to do -- write his own chapter. So I\ninterviewed him several times, and I wrote a chapter for him, which I sent to him. This is\nonly now like maybe a year ago that I finished that chapter. My brother was very\ndisturbed to find that I had written his chapter in the first person, as though he was\nwriting it. And he said I couldn\u2019t -- h-he didn\u2019t feel good about that, that I couldn\u2019t really\ndo that. So, then I started trying to rethink. So, I\u2019m going to write his chapter third\nperson. And then, somehow, that didn\u2019t seem right. And so, my chapter is going to be the\nlongest chapter in the book, cause it\u2019s going to contain a lot of stuff that I\u2019m telling you.\nAnd then my brother\u2019s chapter was going to be the other long chapter, but now I am in\nthe process of maybe rethinking the whole thing again. I think maybe I\u2019m going to\nincorporate my brother\u2019s interview into a story that I tell.",
        "A: And that has caused me now to think about maybe this book is not going to be about\nanybody but us, but then the question arises, what do I do with, for example, there\u2019s a\nchapter of a woman down in New Jersey, who -- which 1s already finished, signed, sealed\nand delivered. She wrote it, I edited it, I got permission letter from her to publish it.\nThat\u2019s the one bit of complete thing I have. Am I letting those people down? I guess\nthere\u2019s a -- I guess I have an overactive conscience and I\u2019m always sort of worried about\nletting down. And this guy, who organized the reunion, he s -- he stupidly sent me a lot of\nstuff and didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t even register it or anything, and all his original pictures got lost,\nand -- and he has called upteen times over the years, \u201cOkay, when is your book coming\nout,\u201d and so on and so forth. Okay, so that\u2019s one side of the story. So now, I don\u2019t know\nwhat to do with this and my current thought is maybe -- maybe I\u2019m going to either follow\nSimon Shellma\u2019s idea partly, or maybe this book is going to be just about us, and the rest\nis going to the Holocaust museum.",
        "A: All those two huge boxes I have of notes and pictures and so on. But something else\nhappened in the interim. About in what must have been, I don\u2019t know, maybe 1990 or\nsomething, we used to go to an island in Maine every summer, for a few weeks. And so\non this one summer, we were going to this island, and I thought to myself, maybe we\nshould do some constructive family project this year. Let\u2019s write a fictional story, all\ntogether. So, we got up to Maine and I said, \u201cOkay, so you know, we\u2019re all going to sit\ndown and we\u2019re going to write this story,\u201d sort of like that game that you play, you know,\nyou write and -- except that we\u2019re going to know, and we\u2019re going to -- now this was not\nan original idea. I got this idea because there was a medical doctor that I heard give a\ntalk, and he wrote a best seller called \u201cThe Sisterhood.\u201d And he gave a talk at a meeting,\nand he talked about how he wrote this book, but he wrote it with the help from a lot of his\nfriends. And he told this whole very funny story, which I\u2019m not going to go into, but\nthat\u2019s where I got this idea of doing this joint project. Well, my husband was not terribly\nexcited about this project. Our son, who has been drawing since age two and now paints,\nreally wanted to paint, and our daughter likes to go and fetch sea animals out of the sea\nand then throw them back, when she\u2019s in Maine, and she was not at all enthused about\nthis writing project. So, the first day, I was really feeling very sour grapesy on this\nvacation, about, you know, oh, I had this great idea and we could, you know, we could\nwrite this great story and maybe it could even get published, and so we went off to sit on\n-- a-at the ocean, on the rocks in Monheegan, and my husband was drawing, my son was\ndrawing, Erica was fishing stuff out of the sea and I\u2019m sitting there with a pad and pencil,\nlooking, you know, forlorn and angry or something. And suddenly this idea for a story\npopped into my head. And I started writing down this story, all by myself. And when we\ncame home from Maine, I was gung-ho involved in this story like I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been\ninvolved in too many things before. And I didn\u2019t have a lot of work to do that summer, so\nthe whole summer, the kids were off doing their own things, my husband left for work in\nthe morning, I was already working out of the house by then. The whole -- almost the\nwhole rest of the summer, I sat in front of my computer from the minute Sam left, until\nthe time he came home, essentially, and I wrote this story, which turned out to be, I don\u2019t\nknow, 333 double spaced pages. Totally fictional story, but has bits and pieces of things\nthat happened. It starts out in the Holocaust, and etcetera. And I thought it was kind of a -\n-a good story. And I -- The thing that -- that I found very bizarre was that while I was\nsitting at my computer, writing this story, I found myself laughing and crying. And I\nwould stop myself and say, \u201cWhat are you doing, Liane, you\u2019re making all this up, why\nare you laughing and why are you crying?\u201d And I was just incredibly involved in this\nstory. So, I finished writing this story, and then I thought, well, I should send it 0 -- I -- I\nshould see if I could get this published, because I thought it was certainly better than -- I -\n- I sort of thought of it like an hour and a half television script, and I thought, you know, I\nthink this is better than a lot of things I\u2019ve seen, I ought to be able to get this published.\nSo, first I called Ann Bernaise, who had been a Barnard graduate, and who lives in\nCambridge and who\u2019s published a lot of books.",
        "A: And she gave me the name of her agent, and I called the agent and the agent said to\nme, \u201cIs this a literary s -- novel?\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, this 1s not a literary novel, this is just a\nfun story, a good story.\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t deal in things that are not literary\nnovels.\u201d So, all right, so that --",
        "A: So that was the end of that. So anyway, then I don\u2019t know, I tried a couple of other\npeople, they -- they -- people that I knew. [indecipherable] I -- I didn\u2019t feel I was getting a\nlot of enthusiasm. One day I got a telephone call from a guy who was working at PBS, he\nwants to come and interview me. Okay, so he came and interviewed me and I said, \u201cYou\nknow, I have a favor to ask, but please don\u2019t do it unless, you know, th-this is something\nthat -- that would really be of interest.\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cYou know, you work for television, I -- I\nwrote this story, I think it would make a good hour and a half TV thing, I wonder if you\u2019d\nbe willing to read it?\u201d He said, \u201cSure, but right now I\u2019m very busy.\u201d I tried to call him\nabout six or seven times in the next year and he was always very busy. So I thought, ah\nhe -- you know, he\u2019s not really interested. A few years later, one day, I was about to\nleave, I think for Europe the next day, I get a phone call from this guy. He says, \u201cOkay,\nI\u2019m getting married in 10 days, my wife is studying for her bar exams, I can read your --\nFedex me your manuscript, I can read it in the next 10 days.\u201d So, I was kind of amazed\nand I -- I Fedexed this thing off to him, and he then -- when -- when I -- when we both\ngot -- when I got back from my trip, and he got back from his honeymoon or something,\nhe spent an hour and a half on the phone with me, telling me what he thought was good\nand bad about this script. And so I tried to incorporate some of his suggestions into the --\ninto this manuscript, and I -- I -- I did a fair amount of additional work on it, and then\nsomebody gave me the name of an agent. My memory these days 1s -- is terrible. Well, it\ndoesn\u2019t matter, but anyway, it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a -- the mother had gone to Barnard College, the\ndaughter I once tutored in algebra when she was a kid and we went on vacation together.\nAnd this girl has n -- this woman has now written a couple of successful novels, so she\ngave me the name of her agent. And I sent this off to this agent, and this agent said --\nwrote me a letter and said something like, this 1s a good story idea, but there\u2019s too much\ntelling, and not enough showing. And that\u2019s a phrase I\u2019ve heard, you know, a zillion\ntimes from people who write. Well, I was busy and I was discouraged and so I just kind\nof put that thing aside. And then, about three years ago, I finally -- I had been trying to\ntake a course in writing and I took a course -- a 10 week course with some woman in\nCambridge, you know one night a week, for three hours or something, in writing -- in\nmemoir writing, and not working on that thing, which was not really a memoir, but a\nnovel, but because I thought it would help me write the San Louis book. And I did learn a\nlot, but that was only three years ago, and I\u2019ve just been unbelievably busy since then,\nand somehow, I -- I know --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "A: I know that I need to be working on the San Louis book. And, you know -- And my\nhusband is now getting into the act. Every week he says, \u201cAll right, when are you\nfinishing your book?\u201d And I really -- I really want to finish it, not just because I want to\nfinish it, but there\u2019s something that tells me it is my obligation to write this thing. I --\nThat I have a moral, or ethical, or whatever you want to call it, thing, that I must do this.\nAnd sometimes I get nervous, cause I say, \u201cOh my God, the years are passing, you know,\nyou could die tomorrow, and you will not have finished this book, and you will have --\nhave not fulfilled your obligation.\u201d But, there is something inside of me that wants to see\nthis novel get published, or aired or something. Why? I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know why,\nbecause I put -- I think it\u2019s just because -- beca -- I put so much of my emotional self into\nwriting that bloody thing, and I think it is sort of a good story. I think it\u2019s a story that\nyoung people could learn from, but may not understand, because -- because I write in it a\nlot about the morays of the 1950\u2019s, you know, and -- and that kind of stuff. And the --\nAnd I -- You know, and I sort of can imagine that some kid who\u2019s 20 years old now,\nwould read this and say, \u201cHuh?\u201d You know, \u201cI-Is this some kind of thing from the middle\nages or something?\u201d But it\u2019s not from the middle ages, that\u2019s really the way things were\nin my world, in 1950. But it\u2019s also -- it\u2019s also kind of funny and -- and -- and -- and\nwhimsical and tragic and you know, an-and -- and I -- I really do think it\u2019s a good story\nand I think it\u2019s a lot better than a lot of things I hear. But -- So -- So -- So every time I\nthink, \u201cOh well, you know, tomorrow, if I have a couple of hours, Pll work on the San\nLouis book,\u201d then something says, \u201cOh, maybe you should just try to make this novel\nbetter first.\u201d And then I wonder, maybe there\u2019s something I don\u2019t understand about show\nme versus tell me. I mean, I\u2019ve learned that, I\u2019ve learned it in classes, but maybe there\u2019s\nsomething internally that I don\u2019t understand enough about that concept, you know. And\nthen I think, \u201cWell maybe I should get help with this,\u201d but then -- then I don\u2019t like that\nidea, because that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s like finking out, or you know. And I shouldn\u2019t say\nthat, because I help people write their grant proposals, that\u2019s how I make the major part\nof my income now, you know, and -- and that\u2019s fine, they just don\u2019t know how to write it,\nand I\u2019m teaching them how to do it. But yet, I can\u2019t accept that, at least not for this thing.",
        "A: So, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know where these are going to go. I mean, you\nknow, maybe I'll get hit by a truck tomorrow and then -- and this will get buried with me,\nor -- or you know, I mean, one of the things that I worry about with my son\u2019s art, 1s it\u2019s so\nhard getting ahead in the world of art, and -- and -- you know, and I think he\u2019s really\nquite good and he has -- in the last few years, three of his paintings have been sold by\ngalleries, for about 10 grand each. [phone ringing] So -- So I don\u2019t -- I -- I don\u2019t quite\nknow -- I don\u2019t quite know how to deal with this, because I really -- I really want to get\nthese -- I want to see these two things published, if it\u2019s the last thing that I do. But I can\u2019t\nsto -- you know, some days I\u2019ve even thought, \u201cWell, you know, I\u2019m si -- I\u2019m going to be\n65, maybe I should retire, and maybe I should just work on this other stuff.\u201d But how can\nI retire when I\u2019ve got a son who\u2019s an artist, who really -- you know, the gallery keeps 50\npercent, so it sounds great, he sol -- sold a painting for 10 grand. But how much of that\ndoes he get? Five. He\u2019s done three of -- of those projects in the last three years. So how\ndo you live on that? You can\u2019t. I mean, basically, we\u2019re supporting him, to a large extent.\nI mean, he has m -- you know, he does sell a bunch of other things in the meantime, so --\nso he\u2019s -- he\u2019s kind of starting to come into his own, but he\u2019s not quite there yet. How can\nI stop working, you know, in -- in -- in this situation. I mean, our daughter is essentially\nnow 99 percent financially independent. She -- Sh -- You know, I taught her how to write\ngrant proposals, she got every grant in the -- that was available. She --",

No, I\u2019m not really a\nwriter, I\u2019m really kind of a scientist. So, can I -- You know, and I -- and I don\u2019t like doing\nthings that are not successful. I don\u2019t do well doing projects that don\u2019t succeed. For\nexample, when I was a kid, I was -- I joined botanic garden club, I had my six foot six\npot, I went every morning and I hoed and weeded and everything, and I got all these\nvegetables to take home to my mother. And that was wonderful. Now, do I even want to\ngo out and plant a single bulb? No. Because that\u2019s not my thing, that\u2019s not going to bring\nme recognition or success.

I\u2019m going to make this thing work.\u201d\nBut the -- You know, and I sh -- I shouldn\u2019t do this, cause I tell people, you know, \u201cIf --\nIf at first you don\u2019t succeed, try, try and again.\u201d You don\u2019t get your grant funded the first\ntime, you have to do it twice, three times, you know. Some people have to write eight\nbefore they get one funded. But for -- for -- And I will do that with a grant application,\nalthough I never had to do that. I mean, I always got funded, either the first time, or in\none case, maybe the second time. I\u2019m not sure I even had to ever rewrite, maybe once.\nBut -- But you know, I am accustomed to being successful at the things that I\u2019m good at,\nand | -- you know, s -- you know, this one woman who finally had a book of poetry\npublished, she\u2019s a professor at BU, she said she wrote a hundred letters to publishers,\nbefore her book of poetry got published by a really good poetry press, University of\nPittsburgh.

        "A: This is a book that was -- that origina -- this is a book that changed my life around. It\ncame out, I think, in 1974, called \u201cVoyage of the Damned,\u201d by Thomas Gordon and Max\nMorganwitz, about the San Louis. Somewhat fictionalized story. I disco -- I -- One night,\nmy husband and I were looking in the New York Times magazine, and there was a\nreview, I think, of -- of this book, or maybe it was the book review. I went out and bought\nthat book. I was extremely disturbed, and something funny happened. I read that book,\nand then I immediately forgot a lot of what it said. And I know -- And then I read it\nagain, and the same thing happened, and I -- I kept thinking, the voyage of the damned,\nthe damned, the damned. That\u2019s me they\u2019re talking about. That was sort of a really\nhorrifying thing, you know, to be referred to that way.",
        "A: Well, I never had, until this book came out, you know, and then I thought, \u201cOh my\nGod, that\u2019s me. That title is about me, and all these other people who were on the ship.\u201d\nSo, anyway, I ca -- I -- a-at -- at some point, I actually contacted the authors and -- and\nthen many years later, I got contacted by this guy, I don\u2019t even remember the name,\nDavid -- David something or other. It\u2019s on -- on my computer, who decided he was going\nto re-issue the \u201cVoyage of the Damned,\u201d in a highly illustrated form, and he asked me for\na lot of photographs, which I sent. So this new book came out, maybe about 1994, or\nsomething. Lot of pictures, a lot of pictures and there\u2019s a -- he had cameos, two page\ncameos of different families, and there\u2019s one of me and my family, and you know, my\nfather with me in a stroller, and all sorts of pictures. So I -- I want my book, if I -- if I put\nother people\u2019s stories into it, or even if it\u2019s just mine, I want it to have all those\ndocuments, you know, I have all these documents. I\u2019ve got a wonderful document\ndownstairs, that -- that -- that my father got. My father fought, as a young man, in the\nAustrian war, 1n World War One, and if he had lived, and come to the United States, he\nwould have fought on the opposite side in World War Two, and that in itself is crazy.\nYou go and you fight people and kill people, and it\u2019s purely -- it has nothing to do, often,\nmost of the time, with your philosophy. It has to do with where you happen to be born, or\nwhere you happen to be living. Does that make any sense? No. And so I have this\ndocument that -- that very picturesque document that my father got, cause he was actually\nwounded during the first war. And I\u2019ve got lots of wonderful -- you know, I\u2019ve got this\nthing that my father had to sign, saying that he wouldn\u2019t practice any more. I\u2019ve got\ndocuments from Poland, I\u2019ve got my parents marriage license, you know, all these things\nthat should go into this book, but everybody tells me, well the more you want to illustrate\nit, the less is the chance that you\u2019re ever going to get this published. So that\u2019s another\nkind of a downer.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019ve called the Holocaust museum, and there is a guy, whose name I don\u2019t\nremember, that I spoke to, who\u2019s 1n charge of -- because they do publish some books, and\nhe didn\u2019t make it sound very promising. But see, I -- I guess -- I mean this 1s probably not\na nice quality that I have, but -- but I\u2019m -- I\u2019m s -- I\u2019m sic -- well, I\u2019m success oriented, so\nI would be satisfied if the book could just get published, but I would be not happy if I had\nto do a vanity publishing. You know, a lot of people that I know -- I belong to this\nsurvivor\u2019s group, and a lot of those people -- well, not a lot, several of those people have\npublished books. And you know, they print -- I don\u2019t know, a hundred copies, it cost\nthem 8,000 dollars, looks like a nice book. People who are ignorant of the publishing\nindustry are not aware that they p-paid to have it published, you know, and just looks as\nthough they wrote this book. That doesn\u2019t sit right with me. I don\u2019t want to pay to have\nmy book published, because if I pay to have my book published, it could be crap. You\nknow, if I publish a book -- which I have published three books about proposal writing,\nit\u2019s because I did it well, it\u2019s a good job. Those books have been well received, well\nreviewed. You know, it\u2019s something of quality. So -- So if I -- if I get my novel\npublished, I don\u2019t want to self publish that, I want it to be published and I want it to get a\nreasonably good write up. You know, not everybody has to love it, but I want it to be\nsomething that somebody\u2019s willing to do, cause they think it\u2019s worth publishing. So -- So\nanyway, here I am and -- and right now, what am I going to do between now and -- I\nmean, when -- when does my hus -- when does my son get to move into his own\napartment and be on his own again? You know, I mean, in other words, when can I get\nback to being 100 percent me again, whatever that means. So, whenever that happens, if\nI\u2019m still around and kicking and haven\u2019t gotten Alzheimer\u2019s disease yet, that\u2019s when I\u2019m\ngoing to make the next big move on, I hope, both of these projects, or maybe one will\ntake precedence. I -- I -- I don\u2019t know. So I f -- I feel that I owe it to somebody, not just\nme, who do I owe it to? I don\u2019t know, I owe it to my mother, to my father, to all those\npeople who died, that I write the story, that I write what happened. So that\u2019s an -- sort of\nan obligation. The novel part? That\u2019s just an obligation to myself. I don\u2019t -- Why, I don\u2019t\nknow, maybe just to prove that I can do this other thing, I -- I -- I\u2019m not sure. But -- But\nanyway, so I have these two sort of big projects to do, and in the meantime, you know, I\nlook around me, like this morn -- I mean, I already warned you what our house looks like,\nbut this morning, I came down and I looked at our house and I thought, \u201cOh my God,\nthere is no way, even if I could spend full time for three months with my husband, there\nis no way that we can this place back into order.\u201d\u2019 You know, I mean, here\u2019s my son\u2019s\nlittle -- a tentative, you know, at home studio. There\u2019s the little hospital under the table.\nYou know, here\u2019s this project that I\u2019m doing for that. You know, it -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s like a\nshambles and -- you know, so here I\u2019m thinking about these big projects, that really\nrequire time, and you know, and then a part of me thinks of myself as being non-\nvulnerable, and the other part of me keeps saying, \u201cYou know, Sam\u2019s been sick, your\nson\u2019s been sick, you\u2019re s -- getting to be 65 years old, what makes you think you might\nnot get sick tomorrow, and you may not be able to finish this project.\u201d So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s kind\nof a real conundrum about, you know, how 1s this going to play out, and I -- and you\u2019re\nyoung enough so that you may know the answer some day, but you know, I -- I just -- I\njust know that each day I get up and there are a list of things that I have to do, that\u2019s a\nmile long and -- and the -- the two books are kind of sitting on my back like -- like these\ntwo kind of weights that keep sort of banging at the back of my skull, but they\u2019re not all\nthat high up on the list right now. You know, I have six business trips between now and\nNovember, which, if Damon were not ill at the moment, is probably, you know, not an\nawful lot, but I -- you know, I have to do some prep work for some of those and so when\ndo I fit this thing in? I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Well, I -- I -- You know, and -- and I\u2019m going to have to bite the bullet one of these\ndays, I mean I -- when I -- when I get around to doing this is to -- or before I get around\nto doing this is, I\u2019ve got to find a publisher, because I know that if I find a publisher,\nthat\u2019s what going to spur me on. And so that -- that really 1s the first step and that\u2019s not\nan e -- I mean, that\u2019s a really big, time consuming project.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: Oh absolutely, absolutely.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: Okay.\n-- and had arrived here, were there any -- any groups, any refugee groups or -- or aid\ngroups that you all tapped into? Was that -- Was that part of your early life here?",
        "A: My mother did go to a number of different places where she got some help. Didn\u2019t\nseem to get a lot of guidance, but got some help. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know very much about\nthat. The only thing that affected me personally was my mother went to some places that\n-- that got me sent to summer camp for I think, three weeks each -- for -- for each of three\nsummers. I really hated that. I hated that with a passion. I didn\u2019t want to go away, I didn\u2019t\nwant to leave my mother. And because my mother\u2019s English was not very good, the first\ntime, I actually got sent to an all Catholic camp.",
        "A: It was just a mistake, I mean, my mother didn\u2019t either ask or pick up or I -- I don\u2019t -- I\nmean, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Ob-Obviously not. And so that was -- that was a really weird experience, to the point\nwhere -- and -- and you weren\u2019t allowed to wear your own clothes. You -- It wasn\u2019t\nexactly a uniform, but you got these colorful, very bad, in bad taste, you know sunsuits or\nsomething, to wear. A-And by the way, you know this 1s -- y-you know, I ha -- I have a\nlot to say about rearing kids, cause I -- I -- that\u2019s a pet peeve, is that people don\u2019t do\nthings right with children, and I am very protective of -- of what you do and don\u2019t do to\nchildren. Wa -- Every Thursday night, at this ridiculous place, they came around with\nshot -- with a tray of shot glasses full of Milk of Magnesia, and every kid had to drink a\nshot glass of Milk of Magnesia. And the other thing was that at night, you had to get\ntucked in to your bed, and these -- I don\u2019t know whether they were maybe nuns who\ndidn\u2019t have full habits on, I don\u2019t even remember, but the -- whoever was in charge of the\ncamp would come around, and you\u2019d get tucked into bed, and they would pull the\nblanket, you know, like rrrrr, then tuck it in, so -- and you -- you basically couldn\u2019t move\naround in your bed. And so I was really traumatized at that camp. First of all, one night I\n-- | happened to wake up and one of the kids was sleepwalking, and there was a whole\ncommotion, but also, at the end of that time -- first of all, when my mother came to pick\nme up, we walked right by -- by each other and she didn\u2019t recognize me and I didn\u2019t\nrecognize her. That\u2019s pretty bizarre. The other thing was, I cried a lot when I had to go to\ncamp, every time. I really hate -- I d -- I -- you know, I really didn\u2019t want to go. The other\nthing that happened is that for the rest of my life, even now, although now I don\u2019t -- I\u2019m\nnot as apt t-to do it as -- as quickly, but for the rest of my life, in my adult life, when I\ncome into a hotel, you know, the beds are always made and they\u2019re always tucked in. Or\nif I go to somebody\u2019s house who\u2019s a bedmaker, the beds -- first thing I do, I look at a bed,\nit\u2019s made, I\u2019m about to have to get into it, the first thing I do is I go around and pull the\nsheet out from all the sides, because I cannot stand to be in a bed where the sheets are\ntucked in. You know, it\u2019s like -- 1t makes me feel as though I\u2019m in prison.",
        "A: And that\u2019s -- And that\u2019s -- I\u2019m sure that comes from that stupid camp. So --",
        "A: So anyway, so that\u2019s the main help that I think I got, 1f you want to call it help, was\nbeing sent for this summer vacation.",
        "A: That\u2019s a very interesting question, I -- I don\u2019t think -- first of all, I don\u2019t think I have\never been religious. My brother got Bar Mitzvahed in France and for a very short time, he\nactually became very religious. I mean, it was a matter of months, and -- and asked my\nmother to keep a kosher home, and when we got to the United States, he said ah, forget\nabout all that nonsense, you know, just --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: My mother --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: My -- My mother was very traditionally Jewish. I don\u2019t think she was -- I don\u2019t know,\nI don\u2019t think she was really religious, but she -- you know, like she lit candles, I -- I think\nshe maybe lit candles on Friday night, but I\u2019m not sure she even did that very long. She\nwould go to the Temple on the high holidays, and she would take me, my brother would\nnever come. I went along f -- I went to -- when I was in early grades, I went to religious\ninstruction on Wednesday afternoons, at the local, little synagogue, across from my\nhouse. But I did that because I got out of school an hour early, but I think 1t wasn\u2019t really\nthat, it was the -- that every kid who went got a little bag of Planter\u2019s peanuts. And I think\n-- | hate to say this, but I think I really went because of the Planter\u2019s peanuts.",
        "A: Yes, bald-faced --",
        "A: S-So -- So, yeah, well, Catholic, that\u2019s an -- you know, that\u2019s a whole other story. My\ndaughter had a friend who would come over here on Sundays and ask us if her mother\ncalled, to not say that she wasn\u2019t in church, you know, to -- that she could --",
        "A: And I -- And I would always say, if you\u2019re here, and your mother calls and says where\nyou are, you\u2019re here. I -- You know --",
        "A: And -- And that\u2019s one of the things that -- that -- see, my mother was very good about\nthat. I -- I did -- I did omit errors of omission. I knew she was very worried, and so\nsometimes I didn\u2019t tell her about places that I was going, or -- or if I did something that I\nthought she would think was dangerous, or if I expected to be home at midnight, I would\ntell her that I\u2019d be home at one am. So I -- So I did fib in that way, but other than that, I\nwas very honest with my mother, and I think she was very honest with me. And that was\na big thing in our fam -- I mean, we told our kids that there was only one major, you\nknow, crime, and that was to not be honest. And that worked out very well, cause even --\nI mean, we had a bad time with our daughter\u2019s teenage rebellion, but I remember her\ncoming one day and saying, \u201cMa, I\u2019m going to tell you something, and I know you\u2019re not\ngoing to like this, but I want you to know I\u2019m going to do this anyway, I\u2019m going to this,\u201d\nshe was going to some, I don\u2019t know, rock concert or something. I\u2019m -- You know, far\naway and driving with some kids or whatever. \u201cI\u2019m going, and a -- you can\u2019t -- you\nknow, you\u2019re not going to stop me, I just want you to know that I\u2019m going.\u201d So -- So that\nwas -- that worked out well and -- and I think my mother, in contrast to a lot of other\nparents, I think my mother listened to what we said, at least most of the time. And I think\n-- You know, I go to the supermarket and you see a kid in a shopping cart, and the kid\u2019s\ntalking to the parent, and what is the mother doing? The mother\u2019s, you know, \u201cYeah, yes\nJimmy, uh-huh, uh-huh,\u201d you know, and -- and her head\u2019s obviously in another place.\nAnd I think that\u2019s really bad for kids. And even when Damon was like two years old,\nSam and I said to him, well -- he asked -- he wanted to do something and Sam and I said,\n\u201cWell, you may not do this for the following three reasons.\u201d And he looked at us and he\nsaid, \u201cYeah, but what about,\u201d and he mentioned something and Sam and I looked at each\nother, and we looked at him and we said, \u201cWell, we hadn\u2019t thought of that, that\u2019s a good\nreason. Okay, you can do that.\u201d And I -- I think there\u2019s been a lot of that, you know, I\nmean, and I have a -- a little cartoon that I keep on the refrigerator a lot of the time, that\nsays, \u201cYou'll have to excuse me, I haven\u2019t had a chance to dirty up since my parents\ncleaned.\u201d And I -- I use that in my workshops, you know, that children are not necessarily\n-- their perspective is not necessarily wrong. It may be different from yours, but it\u2019s not\nnecessarily wrong, and you ought to listen to what they say. And I think I got that from\nthose crazy, early beginnings of having to be fairly responsible, you know, at a very early\nage, and that my mother did kind of listen to what we had to say, and --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: When I went to college, I had to -- th-there was a thing that said, you know, religion,\nand I wrote none. But now I usually write Jewish, it\u2019s just easier, but I -- you know, I\ndon\u2019t think I really -- I didn\u2019t -- I think, because of what happened during the war, I\ndidn\u2019t like af -- being affiliated. It\u2019s not so much that I didn\u2019t like being affiliated with\nbeing Jewish. I didn\u2019t like affiliate -- be --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "A: I -- I didn\u2019t and I still don\u2019t like being affiliated with anything, because that\u2019s how\npeople say, you know, I hate the ABC\u2019s or -- so, I didn\u2019t like being affiliated with\nanything. When I got my first job after graduate school -- no, no, no. Well, first I\u2019m -- I\nmet my husband and my husband had come from a -- a -- quite a religious background, I\nmean his father was very religious. And in fact, when we got married, his father came\nover to me and said, you know, \u201cWould -- Would you consider keeping a kosher home?\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cNo. Sorry, I -- I really can\u2019t do that.\u201d Not only that, but we got married at\ncity hall and -- and his father was after us all the time. We\u2019d get these letters, \u201cYou\u2019re\nliving in sin,\u201d you know. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you consider getting remarried by a rabbi?\u201d And --\nAnd my husband said, \u201cYou know, why don\u2019t we just do this to get the old man happy?\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to do that. That\u2019s -- That just totally goes against, you\nknow, everything that I stand for. And finally, his father was still writing and -- and some\nother friends of mine said, \u201cAh, you know,\u201d So, on our third anniversary we got\nremarried at Harvard Hillel in Cambridge. And I think we had two friends there and the\nrabbi said, you know, \u201cDo you Mr. Lehrer, take Mrs. Lehrer to be your lawful wedded\nwife?\u201d And I never used the name Lehrer, which was funny, cause I always used my\nmaiden name, until my husband had to have some surgery, and that\u2019s when I started\nhyphenating it. And -- And then these two guys threw rice as we walked out of Hillel,\nand so -- SO We were remarried on our third anniversary, by this rabbi, under a chuppah.\nYou know what that is?",
        "A: And -- You know, and -- and now I think, well, you know, I don\u2019t know. I probably\nshouldn\u2019t have fussed about that so much, but I -- but I -- I f -- I didn\u2019t feel good standing\nunder that chuppah, I felt -- I felt like I was going against me, and -- and going through\nsome bizarre action just to please somebody else who was not considering my feelings.\nAnd -- And that there was something -- I mean, now I\u2019m older, I go to other people\u2019s\nweddings, you know, it\u2019s fun seeing the ritual and -- and so on and so forth, but when\nyou\u2019re standing there under it, it just -- it seemed -- 1t seemed hypocritical. It seemed as\nthough I was participating in some kind of witchcraft. You know, it -- it -- it just -- it just\ndidn\u2019t -- I mean, I remember standing under that, and just n-not f-feeling right, you know.\nBut, I mean, you know, now I\u2019m older and I think, well I\u2019m -- I\u2019m really glad that I made\nthis old guy happy, and you know, and so -- so big deal, so I was uncomfortable for 10\nminutes, or whatever it was. On the other hand, I think this is the way people\u2019s principles\nget -- get worn down as they age. You know, you -- you -- you stop -- you worry less\nabout your principles and more about, well, you know, so and so really wants me to do\nthat, so okay. I mean th-th-there was another thing, I mean, that -- you know, adults in\nour society kiss each other, and -- and that -- I -- I was kind of s-struck that that\u2019s sort of\nbizarre, because I -- I sort of grew up with the notion that you kiss somebody cause you\nreally kind of like them a lot. And I kissed my brother and I kissed my mother, maybe I\nkissed my dolls, I don\u2019t n -- I\u2019m not sure about that. But this -- this woman who went to\nmedical school with my father, used to get very -- it\u2019s a word I do -- I don\u2019t use the word\ninsult. I mean, I hardly ever use that word, occasionally, but hardly ever. She would get\nvery insulted, cause she would come to the house and she would think that I should kiss\nher. And -- And I wouldn\u2019t kiss her, and my mother would get angry, you know. \u201cWhat is\nthis, what is it? Why do you -- It\u2019s not hurting you. Give Marenka a kiss.\u201d You know, she\nfeels so bad that you\u2019re not -- well -- and I wouldn\u2019t do that, cause I still had principles,\nyou know. I was eight years old or nine, or 10 or whatever. And now -- I mean, now I\u2019ve\njust given in. I mean, you go to a meeting, you meet somebody for the first time, and you\nblow this kiss, you know, you sort of put your cheek next to theirs, and you blow this kiss\nthat goes off into the air someplace. But I mean, that\u2019s what everybody does, and I -- I -- I\ndon\u2019t really like -- I don\u2019t really, particularly enjoy pe -- kissing people that I don\u2019t know,\nand sometimes I don\u2019t even necessarily like that much, you know. So you kind of go\nthrough life and you make compromises with your principles, cause it just makes life\neasier than having an argument every time, about why won\u2019t you kiss me hello, or you\nwon\u2019t kiss me goodbye, or something like that. You know, I don\u2019t want to have an\nargument, so it\u2019s just easier t-to -- to do what the society tells you to do. And -- And I\nmean I think we dress, a lot of the times, not the way we feel like dressing, but the way\nsociety dictates. You know, it\u2019s just easier.",
        "A: Oh, excuse me, I\u2019m sorry. I -- I didn\u2019t really finish answering your question.",
        "A: I -- 1 -- I\u2019m sorry. I -- I think I got off the track. After our children were born, I didn\u2019t\nreally want them to get Bat Mitzvahed or Bas Mitzvahed, but somehow -- and my\nhusband is really, totally non-religious. You know, I mean he grew up in that very\nreligious household and then he kind of dropped the whole thing. And by the time I met\nhim in Berkeley -- but in Berkeley he would, you know, he would make a seder at\nPassover, and we would -- and one time it was in my apartment with my room mates and\neverybody had a great laugh, because first of all, we were the only Jews at the seder. I\nmean, we | -- we had lived at International House the year before, and you know, we\nknew one Indian and one this and one that, and so we were practically the only Jews. And\nthen I-I made -- I made something called cogo, I don\u2019t know if you know what that is, it\u2019s\n-- it\u2019s egg noodles with raisins and apples and you bake it in the oven and\n[indecipherable], you know and -- and then -- so I served that and somebody at the seder\nsaid, \u201cYou know, you\u2019re not allowed to eat that on Passover.\u201d Well, I mean, I hadn\u2019t ever\nthought about it, noodles, you\u2019re not supposed to eat noodles on -- well, I -- I don\u2019t know.\nWhen -- When I was at my mother\u2019s house, I think I did fast on Yom Kippur, because, I\ndon\u2019t know, I think maybe she wanted me to. I don\u2019t usually do that. My husband didn\u2019t\nfor years. Every once in awhile, he suddenly decides he\u2019s going to do that. And our\ndaughter went through a stage when she was maybe a little bit -- she started to have a\ntendency to be a little religious, or maybe not even religious, but just traditional. And I\nthink -- I think she is maybe a little bit resentful. She -- She says to me, she says, \u201cYou\nknow, when I was in first grade, the teacher asked everybody what religion they were,\nand when she got to me, I said, I don\u2019t know.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t\nknow?\u201d I said, you know, \u201cJust because we didn\u2019t do a lot of those things,\u201d I said,\n\u201csurely, you must have known that you\u201d -- she said, \u201cNo, I was really confused. I didn\u2019t\nknow,\u201d you know. So -- So anyway, so -- so then, the other part that came into this 1s --\nso in graduate school, I had met my husband the first week, although we didn\u2019t get\nmarried for four and a half years, after we finished. And then I -- I -- I came here and I\nhad my first job. And the guy I worked with, who was my immediate, I don\u2019t know,\nsenior person -- with whom I\u2019m still in contact, by the way -- was from quite a traditional\nJewish home. And he was actually married to a woman who had escaped Europe, she was\nfrom Berlin. And -- Excuse me, I\u2019m going to let this [indecipherable] she\u2019s --",
        "A: So, he -- I don\u2019t know how this came up, but you know, at lunchtime we would talk\nabout things and he came -- one day we started talking about religion and I -- I said,\n\u201cWell, you know, I mean, yeah, I\u2019m of Jewish origin, but,\u201d I said, \u201cI -- you know, that\ndoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d And he looked at me, he said, \u201cWhat are you talking about, that doesn\u2019t\nmatter?\u201d He said, \u201cThat matters a lot.\u201d He said, \u201cDo you think, that as a woman, you\nwould have gone to graduate school, if you weren\u2019t Jewish?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell,\u201d you\nknow, \u201cthere are a lot of WASP-y women out there who -- who do big important things.\u201d\nAnd he said, \u201cWell, yes, but they\u2019re not a lot and that actually, one of the things that\ncomes down to you, about being Jewish, is that there is, in the Jewish tradition, as in the\nChinese tradition, there 1s a tradition of education. And you -- you got a lot of that, and\nthat\u2019s probably why you\u2019re sitting here today and we\u2019re talking about chemistry. And,\nyou know, probably, if you were reared in some other religion, unless you happened to\ncome from a particular kind of home, or something, you probably would never have\ngotten this educated.\u201d I\u2019m not sure to what extent that\u2019s true, but in just doing a little\nreading, and in the years that followed that, I guess I sort of became convinced that the\nlikelihood of my getting a Ph.D., as -- especially as a woman, was probably increased\nbecause there was this tradition of things passed down through the ages. You got to go to\nschool, you got to do well, you got to get A\u2019s, you know, and so on and so forth. And so\nnow, if somebody -- depending on who it is, I\u2019Il usually just say, \u201cWell, I\u2019m of Jewish\nbackground,\u201d or -- or something like that, or occasionally Pll still say, \u201cWell, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m\njust not a religious person.\u201d However, something that feeds back into what we\u2019ve been\ntalking about all day, is h -- this house has wi -- a lot of windows, and some of the\ndownstairs rooms, you could walk right up to the window and you can read what\u2019s on the\ndesk. And my husband laughs about this sometimes, but I -- I would never leave, on a\ndesk in a downstairs room, knowingly, anything that would identify us as being Jewish.\nNot because I\u2019m ashamed of it, but because it scares me. And I know that there are a lot\nof people out there, who for whatever bizarre reason, don\u2019t like Jews. And as I\u2019ve gone\nthrough life and looked around me, you know, and people keep pointing things out to me,\nI think, you know, it really is kind of bizarre, because Harvard University, who used to ex\n-- which used to exclude Jews on the faculty, 1s now 30 percent Jewish faculty,\napparently. And -- You know, and I -- I look around -- I mean, when I read the\nnewspaper and I read that somebody did something, you know, that\u2019s sort of in the\neducational or inventing or something realm, it\u2019s almost always either a Jew, or a high\nclass WASP. I mean, there are obviously exceptions, you know, but -- so I think you\nknow that -- it is funny -- it\u2019s funny that there is so much prejudice against the Jews,\nbecause actually, more or less, I think they\u2019ve done good things. And the other thing that\nsomebody pointed out to me many years ago is -- although there\u2019s c-certainly been\nexceptions in recent years, is that there\u2019s -- until very recently, there is relatively very\nlittle violence in -- in Jewish families. I mean there was a famous case, I don\u2019t know, 10\nyears ago, about some Jewish guy who murdered somebody or beat her up or -- or\nsomething, but I -- I think by and large -- and also, I don\u2019t -- I think, traditionally, Jews\ndrink a lot of Manischewitz wine, but they don\u2019t get drunk. So -- So, you know, why is\neverybody down on the Jews? I -- I mean, I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know. But -- But I -- I mean,\nI\u2019m no longer -- but I\u2019m not -- I\u2019m not -- I\u2019m just not a religious person, you know? But I\n-- | -- 1am no longer, sort of, as anxious to get away from that. I mean, I don\u2019t\nparticularly like to advertise it, although, 1n very recent years, I think there have been one\nor two occasions when somebody has said something that got under my skin, when I have\nactually, in a very mild sort of way, flaunted it. Not -- Not really, but just sort of, you\nknow, made a point of -- you know, somebody making a crack -- although, it has to be\nsomething that\u2019s very important to me. I mean, like one night, my husband and I were at\na dance, formal dance, you know, black tie and tails. So we\u2019re standing next to this very\ntall guy, and we sit down at the table, and I had actually danced with him, I kind of came\nup to his belly button. And he starts going on and on about, \u201cWell, you know, all the\ntroubles in the world are caused by these damn Jews,\u201d you know, and -- and Sam\u2019s\nkicking me under the table, and I\u2019m, you know, and Sam was about to say something\nlike, \u201cWell, you know, we\u2019re Jewish,\u201d or something. And I\u2019m kicking, \u201cShut up,\u201d you\nknow, \u201che doesn\u2019t have to know.\u201d And, so Sam didn\u2019t say anything. But, you know, I\ndon\u2019t know whether I did the right thing or the wrong thing. I mean, could I have\neducated that person on that day, by saying, \u201cWell, you know, we\u2019re Jewish and you just\ndanced with me.\u201d But, you know, I mean, this guy was like 70 years old. I didn\u2019t think it\nwas worth it.",
        "A: Right. But I mean -- But so -- so basically, sometimes I f -- you know, the al -- I feel\nthe only hope for the world is total uniformity. There can\u2019t be different cultures,\nlanguages, religions. Everybody has got to be neutral, cause otherwise, somebody\u2019s\nalways going to hate somebody else. On the other hand, I realize that that would make the\nworld somehow, a pretty boring place.",
        "A: Yeah, but there isn\u2019t -- there --",
        "A: It doesn\u2019t happen.",
        "A: You know? It\u2019s not happening. And, I mean, like what\u2019s going on in Yugoslavia?\nThey -- They all come from this same tiny, little place on the globe, they\u2019re more like\neach other than -- you know, than any of these nations that are fast friends, and they\u2019re\nfighting each other. It\u2019s totally ridiculous. So, I don\u2019t -- I mean, I -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t want\nto be religious, I don\u2019t want to be a ba -- you know, now we go to a seder every year, we\nget invited to one. I don\u2019t -- You know, it\u2019s all right, it\u2019s fun, good company, etcetera,\netcetera. I don\u2019t really want to be -- I don\u2019t want to be forced to do that. I -- I -- Left to\nmy own devices, I don\u2019t think I would do those things. On the other hand, when I think\nabout my way of getting peace in the world, of just wiping out any of these differences, I\nfeel a little sad, and I think, you know, as long as they don\u2019t do bad things, I don\u2019t mind\nthat some people like getting Bar Mitzvahed and some people do this and some people do\nthat. It\u2019s -- It\u2019s kind of fun. It -- It\u2019s colorful. The things that bother me slightly more are\nwhen I -- for example, my cousin Hilda, who -- who lives in upstate New York, she and\nher husband are -- have always been very religious. They will not eat in our house, except\non paper plates, and -- and so on. And -- You know, and when I was a kid, I remember\nbeing invited to her house for lunch one day, on a Saturday and I -- I asked her if she had\na pickle. First of all, she made me -- I was eating something different from everybody\nelse, so she made me eat it on a wooden board. And then I asked if -- if I could have a\nsour pickle -- no, she asked me, \u201cDo you want anything else?\u201d And I said, \u201cId like to\nhave a pickle.\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, go to the refrigerator and -- and get a pickle.\u201d And\nso I went to her refrigerator and the light didn\u2019t go on, which I knew it usually did. And I\nstupidly didn\u2019t think about it, and I said, \u201cYou know your -- the light in your refrigerator\nis burned out.\u201d And she said to me, very sarcastically, \u201cIt\u2019s Shabbat, the light in my\nrefrigerator is not burned out. I loosen the bulb on Fridays.\u201d And --",
        "A: No. That\u2019s an interesting -- That\u2019s --",
        "A: I know. Tha -- Well, that\u2019s --",
        "A: Right. But, you know, and I thought, well isn\u2019t this stupid. When you open the door,\nyou don\u2019t have to do anything, you know. I mean, I can see where in -- in 5000 B.C., they\nhad to make lights by, you know, collecting logs and scratching two sticks together and\nso on. Why -- Why 1s she doing that? Well then, when I got older, I realized it\u2019s\nsymbolic, it doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with the fact that turning the lights on is\nno work in, you know, whatever that year was. But I find that a little extreme and it -- I\nmean, I th -- I -- you know, I\u2019m very -- that\u2019s fine, you want to do that, that\u2019s -- you\nknow, go ahead and do that, and I -- I fully will, you know, go along with your right to do\nthat. But it seems a little funny and extreme that, you know to do things like that in 1999,\nyou know. You don\u2019t want to eat milk and meat together, that\u2019s fine, but you know, you -\n- | put my dishes through the dishwasher and they\u2019re not clean enough to go from one to\nthe other? It seems a little funny and extreme to me. You know, I-I -- I somehow feel\npeople should be scientific and logical to some extent. You know, not entirely necessarily\n-- | -- you know, you can have your little foibles, but I guess -- I ge -- I mean, that bothers\nme, it doesn\u2019t bother me only about Judaism, it bothers me about every religion. You\nknow, there are the charming parts of every religion, and then there are the dodo parts of\nre -- for example, you say you\u2019re Catholic. Well, you know, that\u2019s -- I -- I spent a lot of\nmy young years in -- in New York, going to churches to listen to the B minor mass, and\nall this good music and so on, and I also once made a terrible gaffe. I walked into this\nchurch and I saw all these things, and I thought, \u201cOh, that\u2019s really nice, they have all\nthese footstools,\u201d and put my feet on one of these things, and then somebody told me\nthose are not footstools.",
        "A: Right. So -- You know, so that\u2019s all very charming and so on, but then there are\nthings, for example, I don\u2019t know, I hope I\u2019m not stepping on your feet, but you don\u2019t\npractice birth control. You know, I mean that\u2019s -- we got too many people already, you\nknow, and -- and -- and also this comes into my thing about, I don\u2019t thing any child that is\nnot really, desperately wanted, should be born into this world. And I would -- Do you\nknow, I was really bothered, for a long time, that I was an accident, because there\u2019s this\nlarge age difference. And it wasn\u2019t until I was 40 years old that I one day sat down with\nmy brother, and I said, \u201cI need to know whether I was an accident.\u201d And he said, \u201cNo,\nyou were very much wanted.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, why didn\u2019t they have us closer\ntogether?\u201d And my brother said, \u201cWell, because of the depression.\u201d And my response\nwas, \u201cOh, great. So they waited for the depression to be over, and then they had me at the\n-- at the doorstep of World War Two. Well, that was pretty smart.\u201d So -- You know, but -\n- but the relief that I f -- I -- that I felt that night, knowing that I was planned, you know,\nand wanted -- you know, an-and sometimes friends say to me, \u201cOh, oh,\u201d you know like\none friend of ours got pregnant, and she said, \u201cWell, you know, we really hadn\u2019t planned\nto have a child for a couple of years, but I got pregnant, there was a hole in my\ndiaphragm, so we figured, well, now\u2019s as good a time as any.\u201d That\u2019s horrifying to me.\nThat is -- you know, I mean, I -- I kid people and, you know, I mean you can\u2019t plan that\nwell, but both of our kids were wanted and planned and I tell people, \u201cBoth of our kids\nwere born on summer weekend days, because I couldn\u2019t take the time off from work,\u201d\nyou know. So, I don\u2019t know, religions have their good things and their bad things and I\nrealize that some people don\u2019t do well without religion, and I think those people need to\nhave it. But I don\u2019t think it should be imposed on people who -- who are good people\nwithout it, and who don\u2019t need it.",
        "A: Okay.\nand reflect on -- on the meaning of what you\u2019ve gone through, and -- and the -- and the\nmeaning of the Holocaust, I wonder -- well, I-I wanted to invite -- invite you to reflect on\nthat, but I want to ask you one specific thing about it. I\u2019ve done a number of these\ninterviews, and talked to people about whether they see this as a -- primarily as a -- asa\ntragic, horrible, unfathomable event in Jewish history, or -- or 1-in human history, or\nboth? I m -- To -- To be a little more specific, I have a close friend who\u2019s a photographer\nof Armenian background, and he has, in his own memory, his grandparents memory, the -\n- the Armenian genocide of 1915.",
        "A: What\u2019s that guy\u2019s name? Cause I know a photographer.",
        "A: Oh, no.",
        "A: Okay.\nthink about it in these terms, in terms of the lessons, 1s it -- is it a lesson primarily for\nJews, or for humanity, or -- or do you not think of it in that way?",
        "A: Oh, I very much think of it that way. I think -- lesson. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a lesson,\nbecause I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve learned anything. I think -- I c -- I find it very hard to believe\nthat it\u2019s not going to happen again. I mean, like right now, when I turn on the radio, and I\nhear, \u201cWell, you know, the Russians are kind of siding with the Yugoslavs, and China is\ngetting a little alienated,\u201d and so on. And immediately, in my head, I see the map\nswitching into the scenario for World War Three. Because -- I mean, I hope that nothing\nlike that will ever happen again, and -- but -- but I don\u2019t have faith that it will never\nhappen again. And I -- I think -- Well, I think of the Holocaust, as what the hell did they\npick on the Jews for? I mean, the Jews are -- you know, as I said a minute ago, I mean, of\nall the pe -- if -- you know, if I were a bad guy, and I wanted to pick a group of people to\npick on, it would not be the Jews, because, you know, by and large, they\u2019re more or less\nlaw abiding, they don\u2019t drink. They\u2019re -- They have a reasonable family life, and by and\nlarge, they\u2019re educationally oriented, and they kind of do good things, you know. If I\nwere going to wipe somebody out, I would -- I would find groups that do bad things, to\nwipe out. You know, people who -- who -- who are very warring, or you know, or self-\ndestructive, or destructive of other people, or -- I -- [Il tell y -- I\u2019m going to say\nsomething which is a horrible thing to say. And I don\u2019t -- I mean, I don\u2019t really mean it\nthe way it sounds, but it\u2019s a thought that has often crossed my mind. I thought, you know,\nif Hitler had to get even with somebody, and he had to sort of wipe out a group of people,\nwhy did he pick on the Jews? Why didn\u2019t he just decide that he was going to clean up the\nearth of all the people who do bad things? You know, go out and kill all the people who\ndo bad things.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what that means, I\u2019m just telling you this is a thought that I\u2019ve often had.\nYou know, that if he had to have this crazy passion, to go and -- and do -- you know, now\nthey call it, or th-they ca -- they call it ethnic cleansing. Why didn\u2019t he, instead of ethnic,\nwhich makes no sense, why didn\u2019t he do some other kind of cleansing? You know, get rid\nof -- of people who -- who murder other people, who -- who go out and, I don\u2019t know,\nsteal, who -- I mean, you know, I -- I -- I don\u2019t know, but why -- why didn\u2019t he get some\nsense -- Some -- some more sensible agenda? I mean, why did he pick on this random\ngroup of people, who undoubtedly have a lot of bad folks in them, but, you know, by and\nlarge, they\u2019re a -- a reasonably okay group. You know, why didn\u2019t he decide he was\ngoing to do in everybody who was in the jails? You know, or -- or sometimes I hear it\ncosts, you know, I don\u2019t know, x thousands of dollars to keep somebody on death row.\nWell, I\u2019ve changed my mind about that, because as I\u2019ve gotten older, it suddenly has\noccurred to me, you know, there are people on death row who really aren\u2019t guilty. But --\nYou know, so why didn\u2019t Hitler make a project of finding out, you know, who -- like who\nwas really guilty, and if somebody really did something bad, you know, make a project of\ngetting rid of all those pe -- you know, or something more sensible, something -- I mean\nthat -- you know, tha -- tha -- it\u2019s a very childish statement that I\u2019ve just made. But -- But\nI -- You know, and I -- I don\u2019t think the Holocaust affected only the Jews. First of all, lots\nof other people, you know, Gypsies, [indecipherable] a lot of other people got killed.",
        "A: Right, right. But -- But I think -- I think -- I think the whole world, or a lot of the\nwhole world was affected, and I think the Germans were not the least of them, because\nfirst of all, the good Germans, are often living some kind of horrible guilt trip. I mean, I\ndon\u2019t think I have ever yet met a German who didn\u2019t tell me that they hid Jews in their\nhouse, during the wars. And I\u2019ve calculated that if every German who told me that they\nhid a Jewish family in their house, really had done that, there wouldn\u2019t have been any\nHolocaust, you know? So that must be a terrible thing to have to live with. And the other\nthing was something that actually happened to me. I was invited to give a talk at some\nlibrary in Brookline, some years ago, which didn\u2019t work very well, because I cracked up\nin the middle of my own talk, and started crying, and then I ooof. But anyway, at the end\nof the talk, there was a long line of people waiting to talk to me. And so, you know, most\nof them just said something nice and left. But there were two people, standing one behind\nthe other. The first one was a very elderly Jewish man, who bawled me out for saying\nthat there are good Germans. And right after him, there was a very young, very blonde,\nGerman woman, who was probably in her 20\u2019s, who came to thank me for understanding\nthat not all Germans are bad. So that was -- that was a kind of a heavy moment.",
        "A: And I think -- Aw, you know, there is something else that I -- that I -- I don\u2019t think I\nmentioned this on the other interview, and I think this is maybe an important issue. I told\nyou earlier that I had sort of, in a very casual way, decided I wanted to go back to all the\nplaces that I had been in my childhood. In 1961 - \u201962 -- 61 - \u201962? No, \u201963, s -- 1962 -\n\u00b063, my husband and I took that year off, and my mother took a trip to Israel, and we met\nin Vienna, because I specifically routed that we would go to -- to see where I was born.\nAnd we had lived in these -- we had these two apartments, and they had knocked down\nthe wall between them, so my father\u2019s practice was on the right hand side, and our living\nquarters were on the other side. And, so I knocked -- I was with my husband, and my\nmother met us in Vienna, she came from Israel. I knocked on the door of the left hand\napartment, cause the wall had been re-put up there, to -- to make it back into two\napartments. There was no answer. And then the most unbelievable thing happened. I\nknocked on the door of the right hand apartment. My husband was standing sort of right\nbeside me, and then, my mother was here, next -- sort of next to -- to him. The door\nopened, there was a woman who opened the door. She looked at us, she looked at my\nmother, and she turned absolutely snow white, and started apologizing. I couldn\u2019t believe\nthis scene. We left in 1930, in -- in May of 1939. This was now 1963, spring of 1963.\nThis woman recognized my mother, and she started apologizing, \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault that I\nhave some of your furniture, the landlord told me to keep it. What happened isn\u2019t my\nfault.\u201d You know, and she -- she was just continuously verbalizing -- this was in German.\nAnd I said to her, \u201cAll I want to do is, I want to come in for 10 minutes, and look around\nto see where I grew up. You\u2019re welcome to the furniture, I\u2019m not coming to take anything\naway. There\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d This lady followed us all around her apartment,\nand [indecipherable], you know, \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault,\u201d you know, \u201cthe superintendent told\nme wa,\u201d -- you know, \u201cnot my fault, not my fault.\u201d Well, that lady probably did not -- has\nnot had a very good life either. I mean, I don\u2019t know how often this conscience thing\ncame up, maybe it never came up except this time, but I mean, can you imagine this --\nthis scene. So, I went in, walked into the apartment, recognized the green and sort of\nbeige-y streaked linoleum from my father\u2019s office, you know, where my father\u2019s dental\nchair had been. And there was a funny -- under the linoleum, you could see a round hole,\nwas about this big, that had been covered over, and I thought, that\u2019s where my father\u2019s\nexamining chair must have been. And I still think that\u2019s probably what it was, but when\nwe got finished looking around, and we left, and said thank you and goodbye, and this\nwoman was like a nervous wreck, and my mother was -- my mother was a nervous\nwreck, and I -- I really felt very bad, afterwards, that we had taken her there, because I\nthought, you know, she didn\u2019t need this. We came outside the building, and there was a\nplaque on the outside of the apartment house that said that a bomb had fallen through this\nhouse, but it had not exploded. And so then I started to wonder, afterwards, you know,\nwas that really -- did I remember correctly that that\u2019s where my father\u2019s chair was, or was\nthat where the bomb fell? And I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know what the answer is. In 19 -- I don\u2019t\nknow, maybe the early 1990\u2019s or something, my husband and I went back to Vienna\nagain, just the two of us, and I went back to that house again, and this time the building\nlooked like absolute slum, it was just awful. And I went upstairs and I-I -- I rang the\nbells, nobody answered, and my husband said, \u201cDo you really need to do this again?\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cNo.\u201d And we walked into a fabric shop just a couple of doors down, and\nstarted talking to the woman, and told her why we were here, and we went for a ride in\nthe riesenha -- you know what the Riesenhardt is, in Vienna?",

        "A: It -- It\u2019s tilted, but 1t looks brand new. When my mother was alive, she sent money\nevery year to up -- to keep up the grave, and then when she died, I thought, \u201cAw,\u201d you\nknow, \u201cI\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d So it\u2019s -- you know, it\u2019s not nicely kept up, but it -- but\nthe stone 1s still there, and it looks -- I took some pictures of it, it -- it -- it\u2019s tilted, as I\nsaid, but it -- it really looks like new and it\u2019s funny, funny -- not funny-funny, but I don\u2019t\nknow, just weird, going to this place.",
