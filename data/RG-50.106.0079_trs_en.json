And my father\u2019s family came from\nsouthern Germany in Bavaria, and he moved to \u2014 they had lived in Wurzburg,\nwhere my grandparents had a small hotel.

        "Q: Do you have brothers or sisters?",
        "A: No, I was an only child, probably because of the situation, the political situation\nin Germany at the time.",

        "Q: They told \u2014 they said that?",
        "A: Oh yes, they said that.",
        "Q: And could you describe what your home was like in Germany?",
        "A: Briefly, yes. In fact, we visited it, my home again just last August when we were\nin Germany. It was a \u2014a stone house, two stories, with a large yard in the back, a\nlarge garden in the back. And in the front was the \u2014 was a butcher\u2019s store, which my\ngrandparents had run for many years, and their parents had run before that. And that\nbutcher store still exists; someone\u2019s still in there. My grandfather had sold that\nNovember 18, 1997\nbusiness to his apprentice shortly after we left \u2014 about the time when we left\nGermany in 1936.",
        "Q: So at the time that you were living there, your grandfather owned the butcher\nshop in the front of your house?",
        "A: Yes. Yes, yes.",
        "Q: And who lived in the house?",
        "A: Just my \u2014 my parents with my grand \u2014 with my grandfather.",
        "Q: So, your grandfather, your parents and you?",

        "Q: And you \u2014",
        "A: My grandfather was widowed.",
        "Q: And bef \u2014 before we started the interview, you mentioned a nanny?",
        "A: Yes, yes, because my mother was work \u2014 worked. In fact, she helped in the\nstore, and did the bookkeeping and the various other tasks. Sh \u2014 she hired a local\ngirl, she was about \u2014 well, let\u2019s see, she\u2019s 81 \u2014 well, she\u2019s 82 now actually, she \u2014\nher birthday was la \u2014 la \u2014 in September. So she would have been 82. So she would\nhave been what, seven \u2014 four \u2014 15 years old at the time. And she stayed with us\nuntil we left \u2014 until we left Germany.",
        "Q: Did she live in Europe?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Oh, so she was living in \u2014",
        "A: No, she does not \u2014 no, she wasn\u2019t living in the home, she was a local girl, she\nlived nearby. Her parents lived at a nearby sh \u2014 her mother was \u2014 was left with a\nlarge family, and a \u2014 a sick husband, and so the children had to be \u2014 had to work\nrather early to help her make a living. She used to \u2014 cleaning and things like that,\nand so and \u2014 so Hani(ph) came every morning, and left every evening.",
        "Q: And that was from \u2014",
        "A: From shortly \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 the time you were how old?",
        "A: \u2014 shortly after I was born, til we left Germany in 1936. In fact, when we spoke\nwith her this time on our visit, she recalled many of the incidents just before that.\nThe fact that the Brownshirts were, during the boycott of Jewish stores, were\nstanding outside the store and that she tried \u2014 they tried to discourage people from\ngoing in, but she came in anyway to help, every day. And she still had photographs\nof me when I was \u2014 one was when I was about five years old, and another one,\nwhich was a sort of a group picture when I was shu \u2014 probably about one year old.",
        "Q: Now, what do you remember from your \u2014 from those first six years?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Well, I can remember living in the house, and I had a room there. I can\nremember looking out the window of my room and looking out into the garden in\nthe back. And living there, I remember one incident particularly because it\u2019s one of\nthose things that stays in your mind. I must have been probably four years old,\nsomething like that, and the kitchen was two steps down from the level of the store,\nand I would sometimes rush into the kitchen from the store, and I fell. I fell flat on\nmy face. I can remember that so vividly because I \u2014 you know, blood all over the\nplace, I fell right \u2014 my nose was bleeding. And that\u2019s one of my earliest memories\nof an event that occurred there.",
        "Q: How old do you think you were?",
        "A: I think I was about four, four and a half, probably.",
        "Q: And what happened after you fell? Do you remember that?",
        "A: Oh, my mother, you know, came up to comfort me and my grandfather ran out to\ncomfort me. And what was interesting was, in 1983, when we visited the home for\nthe first time, the people are \u2014 who are living in there are descendants from my\ngrandfather\u2019s apprentice. And, it was the son of the apprentice who was running the\nstore then and shortly now \u2014 shortly, he \u2014 he had, before we came, he had turned the\nbusiness over to his son, who unfortunately though, had a heart attack and died very\nrec \u2014 just recently, shortly before we came. But back in 1983, when we came in, the\nNovember 18, 1997\nappre \u2014 th-the \u2014 my father \u2014 grandfather\u2019s apprentice was still alive. He was an 0 \u2014\nvery old man, but unfortunately his memory was gone. But the \u2014 his \u2014 his son still\nremembered my grandfather. And he remembered that my grandfather, after we had\nleft, my \u2014 the people, the older people \u2014 I don\u2019t remember exactly when, but some\ntime shortly after we left, they were \u2014 the Jewish people were sent to what was then\nthe Jewish old age home in Aachen. They were all collected, and they were c \u2014\nthere. And he says he can remember my grandfather coming to the house because\nthey didn\u2019t get ve \u2014 enough food to eat. He would come to the house there and ask\nthem if he could eat with them, because they were not getting enough food. And\nthat was pros \u2014 as I recall was about 1940 - \u201941. And then after awhile, this man\nsaid, your grandfather just didn\u2019t come any more, so we didn\u2019t know what\nhappened, except they had heard that the Jews had been taken away. And as it\nturned out, the records now show that they\u2019d been taken to Theresienstadt. I also\ncan remember going to school shortly before we left. The school year in \u2014 in\nGermany starts right after Easter. And we left Germany in early summer. So I had\nto go to school briefly, and I can remember that my father was concerned about me\nand my going to school. I had to take a tram to get to school. And he rode behind\nthe tram on a bicycle every day to just observe that nothing would occur. And then\nwould meet the tram sometime on the way back, when I came back from school.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: Was it required by the school that you go on the tram?",
        "A: Yes, the school was too far for me to walk. That\u2019s the reason I had to take a\ntram.",
        "Q: And there would be no other way for you to be transported?",
        "A: Get there, no, no.",
        "Q: And did you know that your father was following on a bicycle?",
        "A: Yes, I did know that.",
        "Q: Why didn\u2019t he just get on the tram with you?",
        "A: Well, I\u2014 I\u2019m not sure. I think he just didn\u2019t want to \u2014 to \u2014 at first, I Just\n[indecipherable] about somewhat later. Initially I think he just didn\u2019t want to get\nme concerned that he felt that uneasy, that I would have to \u2014 that he would have to\nfollow.",
        "Q: So he was trying to help you be independent?",
        "A: Yes, yes, I think so. And it\u2019s also that I wouldn\u2019t have those concerns. I can\nremember this \u2014 so I only went to school very \u2014 a few months. Maybe, at most two,\nbefore we left Germany to go to Palestine.",
        "Q: What do you remember about the school?",
        "A: I can remember they had a large, open courtyard. At least it seemed large to me\nat the time, probably wasn\u2019t that large, you know. At this time \u2014 the school is no\nNovember 18, 1997\nlonger there. It was a Jewish school, and \u2014 a Jewish elementary school, which was\nnot uncommon in Germany, they were that \u2014 that \u2014 there \u2014 even before the Nazi\ntimes this [indecipherable] there were schools that were, you know, t \u2014 even today\nthey have parochial school supported by the state, and so that the Jew \u2014 the Jewish\nschools were also partly supported by the state. And I do remember going to school\nvery briefly. I don\u2019t remember too much, except that I was very unhappy going to\nschool. That\u2019s the only time that I was unhappy going to school, I always liked\ngoing to school later.",
        "Q: And what was there that \u2014",
        "A: So I must have been some concern.",
        "Q: What \u2014 do you have any memory of what there was about the school that you\nwere feeling unhappy?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know. I\u2019m really not sure why that was. Perhaps I had a feeling of\nthe uneasiness of my parents, because by that time my father had been forced to\nclose the store in Aachen already, that we had. Another store, he had two stores.\nAnd he only had the store now in \u2014 in the part \u2014 in Eilendorf. And I suspect that I\nfelt some of the uneasiness of \u2014 that my parents must have had.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything about the school, other than the playground?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Well, I remember being in the classroom. I don\u2019t remember too much about what\noccurred. I remember when we \u2014 first day that I was there, I do have one memory.\nWalked into the classroom and on the blackboard there was a drawing done in chalk\nof a \u2014 of a little boy and a little girl. I guess the teacher had done that, I can recall\nthat \u2014 seeing that. I don\u2019t remember anything really about \u2014 else about the school.",
        "Q: Do you remember any of the other children?",
        "A: Not really, not really.",
        "Q: And outside of school, did you have playmates?",
        "A: Yes, I\u2014 well, my cousins lived in Eilendorf. My mother had a si \u2014 a sister\nwhose family also lived in Eilendorf, and th \u2014 she had three children. And so I can\nremember playing with them, and I\u2019m \u2014 don\u2019t particularly remember other people\nexcept now, recently we received a letter from someone who had seen the article\nabout our trip to Aachen, and she wrote us a letter. She also knew my \u2014 my nanny,\nbecause her mother, my nanny\u2019s mother, had been a domestic in their house, and\nshe wrote him the letter that she had sometimes played with me because Hani(ph),\nwho was the \u2014 who was the nanny. And she sent me a picture, a class picture that\nshe had, which had \u2014 which included my elder cousin, my oldest cousin Ilsa, who\nwas a classmate of hers. So she was about three years older than I was. And then\nNovember 18, 1997\nshe had a brother and sister who were younger than the brother Eric, was about my\nage, and I can remember playing with him.",
        "Q: Now, was she Jewish?",
        "A: This woman? No, she was not Jewish. No, no. No, no. And she wrote to us that\nshe can remember meeting the Kunn(ph) family, that was their name, in Aachen\nlater when she sometimes would go in with her mother after they had been forced to\nleave Eilendorf, and I guess they were \u2014 ma \u2014 they \u2014 they must have been gathered\nin some places. All the Jews must have been gathered there, and she can remember\nthough, meeting Ilsa on the street sometimes for a short period of time during \u2014 I\nguess in the early 40s. So she had that memory. So she sent me a very nice letter,\nand she had spoken with me, and she thought I might be interested in having that\npicture of my \u2014 of my cousin, which of course we were very interested in seeing it.",
        "Q: Was your family religious?",
        "A: No, no, my family was not \u2014 the Jews of Aachen were what we would call in\nthis country, Reform. And the \u2014 my \u2014 my father\u2019s family had been more religious,\nalthough my father was not particularly religious, although we would \u2014 we went to\nsynagogue. And \u2014 but we would have \u2014 we \u2014 the synagogue was too far to walk, so\nwe would have to drive there. So no, the \u2014 this \u2014 the \u2014 the Jew \u2014 the Jews of\nAachen \u2014 there were very few religious Jews in Aachen, most of them were\nNovember 18, 1997\nReform. And then \u2014 that community had been there for quite some time, certainly\nsince the middle of the 18\" century.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything specific about the closing in of the Nazis when you\nwere in Aachen?",
        "A: Not \u2014 no, I don\u2019t remember it particularly from firsthand experiences except my\n\u2014 of course, my parents talked about it from time to time later on.",
        "Q: But you don\u2019t remember hearing them talk about it when you were a child?",
        "A: I\u2014no, no, I don\u2019t remember hearing it firsthand. I do remember our trip when\nwe left Germany, I can remember that. I can remember going to say goodbye to my\ngrandmother, my father\u2019s mother, who was still living in Wurzburg at that time,\nand taking the train down there to say goodbye to them.",
        "Q: What was your understanding at the time of why you and your parents were\nleaving, and not your grandparents?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know that I \u2014 I had that particular understanding of \u2014 at \u2014 at that age, of\nwhy that happened. Of course later my parents told me that these people, they didn\u2019t\nwant to go along, they thought, you know, things would be all right, and they were\nold people, and they felt nothing would happen to them. And so I don\u2019t particularly\nknow, except I do know my parents spoke about it. My father tried very hard to get\nthem to leave. And by the time, of course, they wanted to leave, it was too late. We\nNovember 18, 1997\nwere in Palestine by then, of course, but \u2014 and even when we came to the United\nStates in 1938, it was too late for them to leave, they couldn\u2019t get out.",
        "Q: And do you remember what you were told about the leaving?",
        "A: No, not really firsthand, I really don\u2019t know. Later, of course, I learned, you\nknow, about it from my parents. And I heard from Hani(ph), Hani(ph) Dover, the \u2014\nmy nanny, she told us when \u2014 on this last visit sh-she can remember that when my\nfather decided to leave, telling them that he was leaving because there was no future\nin Germany for his son and his family. So my father decided to leave in 19 \u2014\nactually, he told us that he wanted to leave already in 1933, but it took him three\nyear \u2014 almost three years to get it together and to find a place to go. At that time we\ncouldn\u2019t come to the United States because we had no family here. Later, we were\n\u2014Ith\u2014my uncle, my father\u2019s brother came to this country through his wife\u2019s\nfamily and that\u2019s how we came to this country then, through my aunt\u2019s family, who\nwere not Jewish, by the way. They provided an affidavit for my aunt\u2019s family and \u2014\nand two of her sisters, and their family, and for us. Which was quite something to\ndo, because giving an affidavit meant you were taking a responsibility.",
        "Q: So you left for Palestine in 1936?",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: And do you remember any feelings about saying goodbye, or \u2014\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Yes. I was a little unhappy leaving my grandparents, I can remember, especially\nmy grandmother, because that was a big trip to go to Wurzburg and to say\ngoodbye, and then we \u2014 and I can remember going to my grandmother before that.\nIn fact, I even have a memory of playing with a \u2014 she had a little red wind-up car,\nand I can remember playing with that in her apartment, which overlooked a square\ncalled the Figurenbrunnen. [ can \u2014 and I can still remember looking down there\nand seeing the fountain in the center of the square and all the traffic and activity that\nwas going on there. And going with my father down to the river, which was not far\nfrom the \u2014 from the house. So I have memories of that.",
        "Q: So, describe the trip to \u2014",
        "A: Palestine?",
        "Q: \u2014 Palestine, from leaving Aachen.",
        "A: We went by train to Italy, and left from \u2014 trying to think which \u2014 which port we\nleft from. I \u2014 I believe we left from Genoa.",
        "Q: Did you have any favorite things that you took with you?",
        "A: I must have, but I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But I remember there \u2014 on the \u2014 being on the boat from \u2014 from Italy to \u2014 to\nPalestine. It was very warm, and in fact we have pictures of the family on the boat,\nNovember 18, 1997\nsitting there in our bathing suits, by the side of the pool on the boat. And I can\nremember that, and I can remember being, of course in Palestine, and going to\nschool in Palestine, and living there. My father had a nephew who was already in\nPalestine, and my mother had cousins who had gone to Palestine very early. They\nwere ardent Zionists, and they had gone there in the 20s, and in fact one of the\ncousins whom we met on some of our trips back to Palestine, my mother\u2019s cousin,\nfounded \u2014 was a founder of a kibbutz, Kibbutz Yavne, and he had a very large\nfamily, which we met when we were there. And my mother\u2019s brother went to\nPalestine just after we left Palestine to come to the United States. He went there\nwith his family. And his son is my only living cousin \u2014 first cousin. And we\u2019re still\nin touch with him, and we see him frequently. He\u2019s with the Israeli foreign service\nand we met him in Germany twice on trips over to Europe, and he\u2019s been to the\nStates frequently, because one of his daughters is married and her husband 1s\nstudying here in the United States.",
        "Q: Now, when you arrived in Palestine, what port did you \u2014",
        "A: Haifa.",
        "Q: In Haifa.",
        "A: Yes, and we lived in Haifa.",
        "Q: And had arrangements been made before you got there?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: I believe so. My parents rented an apartment, I think through my \u2014 my father\u2019s\nnephew, my cousin. His name was Walter and he was married to an Israeli woman.\nSo they had been there some time and I believe they had helped my parents make\narrangements. And my father tried to s \u2014 started a business with this nephew.",
        "Q: And where did he get the money to start a business?",
        "A: Well, at that time you could take your money from Germany. In 1936, you\ncould still take your \u2014 your \u2014 your money out. So he had taken that along, and he\nhad \u2014 well, he \u2014 they chur \u2014 they went into the trucking business. They bought a\ntruck, they \u2014 they imported a truck from Germany. It was one of the assets my\nfather took with him. And I can remember going along with them on the truck. But\nthey \u2014 the \u2014 the work that that they did was they got a contract with a soft drink\ndistributor, and they would truck the soft drinks. Unfortunately this was the time of\nthe depression, and economic conditions were not very good in Palestine, in the \u2014\nin the \u2014 in that time period. And so the business was not very good. And my father\nwas \u2014 always said we could compute almost to the day when he\u2019d spend his last\npiasta in Palestine, because they just simply couldn\u2019t make a living. And I think\nthat was the principle reason then, that he left Palestine, was economic.",
        "Q: How long were you in Palestine?",
        "A: Two and half years.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: From \u00b036 \u2014",
        "A: To \u2014 to late \u00b038.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And \u2014",
        "A: Just a little over \u2014 just over two years.",
        "Q: So you were six when you arrived. And did you start school right away?",
        "A: Yes, yes, Yes, I did.",
        "Q: Do you remember that?",
        "A: Yes, I can remember that, and I can remember that first I was a lot happy going\nto school because I couldn\u2019t understand the teacher, they were speaking Ivrit, I\ncouldn\u2019t speak any Ivrit. But apparently I must have learned it very quickly,\nchildren learn very quickly. And I was very happy going to school after that.",
        "Q: What about your parents with the language?",
        "A: They never really got to be very proficient in Ivrit. But then in Haifa there was a\nlarge German colony, and so you could get along pretty well with German.",
        "Q: But your father knew enough of the language to get along in business?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: And of course my nephew \u2014 his nephew helped him along with that, he spoke\nIvrit quite fluently.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: And did you make friends in school?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, we had a lot of friends, and my par \u2014 but as \u2014 as \u2014 and my\nparents, of cour \u2014 had friends. Most of them, of course, were immigrants like\nthemselves. And because conditions were so difficult that my parents also, to help\nmake a little money, rented out one of the bedrooms in the apartment to a young\nman who was from Austria. And he lived there with partial board. So that helped\nthem earn some money to help pay for the expenses, and that\u2019s how they managed\nto eke out some of the living, as well.",
        "Q: And how did your mother spend her time?",

And also again, to\nhelp make a living, they would \u2014 my father had been a prof \u2014 was a professional\nchef, they would have dinners that people could come to, about once a week, for\npay, or for money. And so that they took in paying guests, so to speak for \u2014 once a\nweek for a meal. And that helped them as well.",
        "Q: Do you remem \u2014 remember the dinners?",
        "A: Oh yes, I can remember some of them.",
        "Q: Is that fun for you?",
        "A: Sometimes, and sometimes of course it was too late for me to stay up. And I\nremember that they put me to sleep out on the veranda, out on the porch, because\nNovember 18, 1997\nthe people were in the apartment. And I remember going to sleep outside. But I\nguess it was fun for a little boy.",
        "Q: Wh-What else was fun for you in Palestine?",
        "A: Well, just playing around \u2014",
        "Q: Like what kind of play?",
        "A: \u2014 and going to school.",
        "Q: What did you like to play?",
        "A: Well, what do children do, children get together and they play games.",
        "Q: Like what kind of games?",
        "A: I\u2014 really \u2014 well, you know, hide and seek, and those kind of games that \u2014 some\nball. And then so I\u2019ve \u2014 when \u2014 when my parents told me that they were leaving\nPalestine, of course I was \u2014 at that time, then I was rather sad to leave, because of\nmy friends.",
        "Q: So you \u2014 so you remember that?",
        "A: Yes, I do remember that. I remember le \u2014 that departure. And I can remember\nthe trip to the United States because then I was quite old enough to \u2014 to \u2014 to\nremember that. [phone ringing]",
        "Q: Do you have to [indecipherable]\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: The answering machine will take it. Yes, that trip was \u2014 I have more memories\nof that trip.",
        "Q: And more memories of the leaving and feeling sad about the leaving.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Although my \u2014 being with my parents, of course, made it, you\nknow, easier. And I can remember then, we went by boat to mars \u2014 from Haifa to\nMarseilles. And from Marseilles overland to Paris, where we stayed a couple of\ndays, waiting for the ship which was leaving from Le Havre.",
        "Q: Now this was in 1939?",
        "A: 1938.",
        "Q: \u00b038.",
        "A: Late \u00b038.",
        "Q: And so you were staying overnight in \u2014",
        "A: Winter \u00b038.",
        "Q: \u2014 Marseilles.",
        "A: We spent a couple of days in \u2014 in Paris. No, we didn\u2019t stay in marse \u2014 I can\u2019t\nremember staying in Marseilles. I think we just got on the train and went\nimmediately to Paris, where we stayed for a couple of days because the ship, which\nwas the Queen Mary, didn\u2019t leave Le Havre for several days after our arrival, and\nNovember 18, 1997\nthen we got on the ship. And that was quite an adventure for a little boy, such a big\nship.",
        "Q: What was that like for you?",
        "A: Oh, I had a wonderful time on the ship, although the \u2014 the passage was a little bit\ns \u2014it was a little bit stormy on that passage, but the \u2014 I didn\u2019t particularly get\nseasick, but my parents did have a little bit of seasickness. I can remember there\nwere a lot of activities for children. They had organized play. I can remember\nplaying on the ship with some of the other children. And it was by f\u2014 I can still\nremember that it was the first time I ever ate Brussels sprouts was on the Queen\nMary. I didn\u2019t know what Brussels sprouts were until I got on the Queen Mary.\nAnd then we arrived in New York. But I guess it was \u2014 trip was \u2014 th-the Queen\nMary was rather fast, it was like five and a half days to get to New York from Le\nHavre. And there we stayed, in New York for a couple of days, and then went by\ntrain to Cincinnati, which was where my uncle was living, and we moved to\nCincinnati, Ohio. And I can remember that very well, and I grew up in Cincinnati\nthrough high school. I was 18 years old when we left Cincinnati to go to New\nJersey.",
        "Q: So you arrived in Cincinnati when you were about nine?",
        "A: Actually about eight and a half.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: Eight and a half. So you were there eight and a half to 18.",
        "A: Yes. Almost 10 years.",
        "Q: Did you know any English when you were \u2014",
        "A: No, I knew no English when I arrived, and of course I had to go to school. And\nbecause I spoke no English, they decided that I should \u2014 although I was eight and a\nhalf, to put me in the first grade. Now there was a little boy in the school who was a\n\u2014 who spoke German, and helped me understand what the teacher was saying.",
        "Q: Was he in first grade?",
        "A: Yes, he was in first grade.",
        "Q: This is public school.",
        "A: Public school. Which is not that unusual in Cincinnati. Cincinnati had a long\nhistory of German immigration. There were a lot of people in Cincinnati who\nspoke German, even though they were not \u2014 you know, they may be second or even\nthird generation American. So this little boy spoke German and helped me, and of\ncourse once I learned English, then they moved me to the second and third grade\nvery quickly.",
        "Q: Were you friends with him outside of school also, or just in school?",
        "A: Actually not, because he lived \u2014 he didn\u2019t live nearby, but I made other friends.\nAnd this little boy was much younger than I was, and once I moved out of the first\nNovember 18, 1997\ngrade, I sort of lost touch with him. But \u2014 and my parents, of course, had to start\nagain, and that was economically very difficult to make a living at that time in the\nUnited States because of the depression. And my parents had \u2014 took my parents\nawhile. My father, as I say, was a professional chef, but he couldn\u2019t get a job in that\nfield at the time, immediately. It was very interesting. So he tr \u2014 got various jobs\ndoing things, and one ti \u2014 one job that he managed to get was in a large cafeteria.\nAnd he says all he ever did was peel potatoes and on \u2014 cut up onions. He said, but\nwas one good thing about cutting up onions, because he always got a seat on the\ntrolley going back because he smelled so of onions, nobody wanted to sit next to\nhim. But one day, he tells the story, he met someone on the street, and \u2014 that he\nknew from Europe. A man that had been with him in Switzerland where they had\nlearned their trade together. This man was a chef in one of the large hotels in\nCincinnati, and when he met my father he asked him what he was doing, and how\nthings were. My father, of course, told him how difficult 1t was for him to get a job.\nHe said well, he said, meet me in the union hall next Wednesday. And he got him a\njob as a cook in one of the restaurants in downtown Cincinnati, where my father\nthen eventually became the chef. So that\u2019s how he did it, how it happened that he\ngot a job even during the depression, through a friend, or an acquaintance, that man\nNovember 18, 1997\nhe had studied with in Switzerland. So after that things got a little better,\neconomically.",
        "Q: So that would have been when?",
        "A: Well, actually, that probably happened in 1939.",
        "Q: So that was soon after you arrived.",
        "A: It was about a year, little less than a year after we arrived.",
        "Q: So what was it like for you, in as far as making friends?",
        "A: Well, made friends very quickly.",
        "Q: Even though you had a language problem at first?",
        "A: Well, the \u2014 the language problem went away very qui \u2014 very quickly. I \u2014 I don\u2019t\nremember that was a problem. And there were \u2014 in the area we lived in, there were\na lot of other immigrants as well as people who spoke German.",
        "Q: So would \u2014",
        "A: But I spoke English very quickly.",
        "Q: So did your friends tend to be also immigrants?",
        "A: Yes, most of \u2014 most of them were, most of them were, because they were also \u2014",
        "Q: Jews, or not Jews?",
        "A: Yes, most of them were Jewish. It was a predominantly Jewish area that we lived\nin in Cincinnati called Avondale. At that time it was very Jewish. I \u2014 going to walk\nNovember 18, 1997\n\u2014 I remember walking to high school I would pass three synagogues on the way to \u2014\nwalking to high school.",
        "Q: Now, was your family involved with the synagogue?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. They were then. It was interesting. The immigrants \u2014 the German\nJewish immigrants started a congregation of their own, so my parents felt that they\nwanted to support this, although they weren\u2019t Orthodox \u2014 it was an Orthodox\ncongregation \u2014 but they felt they wanted to support the congre \u2014 that congregation,\nand I \u2014 and so then they did get involved.",
        "Q: And what about you?",
        "A: And I can remember going \u2014 yes, we went to a synagogue. I used to go to\nsynagogue on Saturdays and because also my friends went. Even though my parents\ndidn\u2019t always go because it \u2014 because of \u2014 of \u2014 of work. Later my father left the\nrestaurant and started a bakery of his own, with a partner, someone he knew, an\nacquaintance. And so of course then they were working six days a week. So he\nwould not be \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t go to synagogue that frequently.",
        "Q: So you went with your parents when they went. Do \u2014 were you involved with \u2014",
        "A: No, sometimes I would go without my parents.",
        "Q: With your friends or by yourself?",
        "A: Yes \u2014 no, with my friends, we\u2019d meet my fren \u2014 I'd meet my friends there.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: And were you involved in any children\u2019s activities at the synagogue?",
        "A: The synagogue didn\u2019t have any particular \u2014 that much in the way of children\u2019s\nactivities. We had other activities through, you know, thr-through the school, and I\nmade other friends in school, and so they \u2014 they weren\u2019t necessarily really\nconnected with the synagogue.",
        "Q: Did you have a Bar Mitzvah?",
        "A: Yes, yes, we did.",
        "Q: Do you remember that?",
        "A: Yes, I can remember that very well. Of course, it wasn\u2019t as elaborate an affair as\nBar Mitzvahs are today. First of all, it wasn\u2019t customary then, and beside my\nparents weren\u2019t going to spend that kind of money on a Bar Mitzvah. But I can\nremember friends and family ad \u2014 coming to the apartment, and my parents had a\nkiddush, and \u2014 and then a meal for the family afterwards in the apartment.",
        "Q: And do you remember how you felt about all that?",
        "A: Oh, I was very excited, because of course, I got a lot \u2014 a number of gifts. And it\nwas very exciting having all those people there and being the center of attention. I\nguess I can remember that very well.",
        "Q: We have to turn over the tape.",
        "A: Okay. Maybe we\u2019ll have a little co \u2014\nNovember 18, 1997\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: \u2014 tinuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Kurt Pauly, tape number one, side B. Okay.",
        "A: Okay, because of the difficult economic conditions when we first came, and\nparticularly before my father got a good job as a cook, my mother also went out to\nwork as a domestic on a day \u2014 day \u2014 daily basis. And I can remember going to some\nof the homes where she was working when I got out of school, so that I wouldn\u2019t be\nat home alone. And she did that for some years to help supplement my father\u2019s\nincome. As well as, again, renting out \u2014 we took a very large apartment in the same\nhouse where my uncle lived, and my parents rented out two of the bedrooms to help\npay for their expenses as well at that time. And those were rented out for quite a few\nyears until things got a little better and we no longer needed to do that. I can\nremember making friends with a \u2014 with the people who \u2014 who rented the rooms,\nand they stayed for quite awhile, so they must have been fairly happy living with\nmy parents. So that we had an elderly lady there I remember, a Mrs. Scholl(ph),\nwho was an American woman who I guess was re \u2014 living as \u2014 she was widowed.\nAnd she always told me her husband had been a drummer boy in the Civil War.\nAnd we had another woman, a Mrs. Stern, who was an immigrant. And she was a\nNovember 18, 1997\nrather \u2014 she was not \u2014 later on she got rather sickly, and unfortunately \u2014 and left\nbecause of illness. And we made friends with her family as well; she had a son. And\nactually my parents got to be very friendly with them \u2014 with those people as well.\nThey became more than just boarders, they be \u2014 sort of became friends. And of\ncourse later things got better, my parents didn\u2019t have to rent out rooms any more.\nBut of course as a child I never felt particularly deprived or poor because I was \u2014\nwe were, you know, at least comfortable, and I \u2014 I guess people around me didn\u2019t\nhave any more than we had, so \u2014",
        "Q: You mean your friends at school?",
        "A: Friends, right, friends at school and people that my parents knew that I came to\ncontact with. So I guess even at the beginning, although my parents had a very hard\ntime economically, didn\u2019t seem to make that much of a problem for me initially.",
        "Q: Do you remember having any awareness at that time of what was going on in the\nrest of world?",
        "A: Yes, of course, and as \u2014 as I \u2014 as I grew older, I can remember, well, when the\nwar started, 1939, and my parents [indecipherable] of course, at that time, and their\nconcerns with the people that they had left in Europe, their family. And I can \u2014 my\nmother was, of course \u2014 my mother was a somewhat of a di \u2014 rather depressed\npersonality, and that didn\u2019t get any better as she aged. But I can remember that they\nNovember 18, 1997\nhad a great deal of concerns about people they left behind, their parents and their\nfamilies.",
        "Q: And how did that affect you?",
        "A: Well, not so much directly when you\u2019re a child, that sort of \u2014 you know, it\u2019s sort\nof there, but it \u2014 1t doesn\u2019t have that much impact on you. Although I ca \u2014 I could\nremember my grandparents and I \u2014 I remember their concern. So some of those\nconcerns did rub off on me, but as a child I \u2014 1t \u2014 you don\u2019t feel any responsibility\nfor it, so \u2014 but I can remember the war going on, and then of course, I can\nremember distinctly when \u2014 when Pearl Harbor occurred. That was on that\nSunday, because I had gone with my father on that Sunday to \u2014 to see a new\nrestaurant that they were \u2014 that the \u2014 that thas \u2014 those people were opening, people\nthat my father worked for, and he wanted to check out, see how it\u2019s com \u2014 was\ncoming along. And so that Sunday we took a trip to the new restaurant, which was\nout in the suburbs. And when we came back there was all this hubbub and people\ntalking and telling us that Pearl Harbor had been attacked. So I can remember that\nvery distinctly. Of course, during the war then, of course, I can remember \u2014 well,\nwe had rationing, so that was a problem of sorts, for everyone. And of course my \u2014\nyou know, not knowing how long the war would last, I guess my parents already\nbegan to have some concerns about this happening \u2014 their son perhaps drafted at\nNovember 18, 1997\nsome time into the war, although that didn\u2019t occur at that time, although later I was\ndrafted during the Korean War. But then it\u2019s \u2014 but I was going to high school, and I\nenjoyed going to high school very much [indecipherable]. In fact, I enjoyed going\nto school period in Cincinnati. It was a very good experience.",
        "Q: What did you like about it?",
        "A: I just enjoyed learning. I was a good student and I enjoyed it and I \u2014 the schools\nwere challenging and \u2014 and I just enjoyed it. The high school I went to \u2014 well,\nactually it was a combination junior high \u2014 high. It was a school \u2014 although a public\nschool, it was a school you had to enter by competitive exam. And, you know, three\nyears of Latin were still required. And so I can remember the te \u2014 the Latin teacher\ntelling us how fortunate we lu \u2014 we were that two years of Greek were no longer\nrequired. But it was a good school, and I enjoyed going there. Even though it was a\ngood walk to school, but \u2014",
        "Q: So you enjoyed the academic life.",
        "A: Yes, I did, I did.",
        "Q: And what about the \u2014",
        "A: And the friends.",
        "Q: \u2014 extracurricular part?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: We enjoyed that. I went with my friends and although not all of my friends then\nwent to that particular high school, some of them went to one of the other high\nschools. I enjoyed \u2014 I enjoyed going to the school, and you know, being a teenager.\nI also helped my parents later in the bakery which they opened up, and I would\nwork there after school and on weekends, helping out.",
        "Q: So did that cut into your social time?",
        "A: A little bit, but not too badly, not too badly. My parents were understanding and\nth-they didn\u2019t want me to work all the time. So I don\u2019t remember that that was a\nparticular problem.",
        "Q: Now how was it for you as far as being a German Jewish immigrant?",
        "A: Well, bec \u2014 we were surrounded by a lot of people in the same boat. And so it\nwasn\u2019t a particular problem.",
        "Q: Did you feel discrimination?",
        "A: No, no, I can\u2019t remember feeling any discrimination at all. It was \u2014 it was a very\n\u2014 basically a\u2014a pretty good time, except the problems that my parents had then\nlater with \u2014 when they learned when the war was over and they got indications of\nwhat had happened to their families. Of course I remember that, that was \u2014 those\nwere terrible times for my parents, and my mother \u2014",
        "Q: Talk about that.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Well, she cried a great deal about it. Of course, she cried very easily because she\n\u2014 she was a somewhat depressed person. But I\u2019m sure that there were \u2014 you know,\nthe \u2014 there were certainly very good reasons there to cry about that. And when she \u2014\nshe had always hoped that perhaps somebody would have survived the war, besides\nof \u2014 her brother, of course, had survived in Palestine. But that perhaps some of her\nnieces and nephews, these people \u2014 these children that I played with in Eilendorf\nhad survived. But sh \u2014 my \u2014 my \u2014 my oldest cousin Ilsa was a \u2014 a great favorite of\nmy mother, and she always had some hope that perhaps one of the children had\nsurvived. But that was not to be, and later we found out when we checked the\nrecords, particularly here at the Holocaust Museum, there were indications that all\nof them had been \u2014 you know, all of them had perished in the war. And of course,\nmy mother, not \u2014 and of course my father\u2019s family as well; he had the sister, and his\nmother and well, he had several sisters and their f \u2014 and all those people also\nperished. So that was a terrible, you know, feeling for my parents.",
        "Q: And how was it for you?",
        "A: Well, you know, children don\u2019t in-internalize that as much. And it \u2014 although I\nknew, you know, it was \u2014 it was bad, it \u2014 the impact on me was not as great because\nI had been so young when we left, and so my memories of these people were rather\nlimited. I mean, it was very, very st \u2014 you know, it \u2014 I mean, some of that\nNovember 18, 1997\nunhappiness obviously rubbed off on me and \u2014 but \u2014 and then by that time I was old\nenough to realize what that meant. But \u2014 but that \u2014 it was, of course, much more\ntraumatic for my parents. Very traumatic for them. And \u2014 and of course, my uncle\u2019s\nfamily, as well, my aunt\u2019s family. They also, of course, lost a lot of people in the\nHolocaust.",
        "Q: So at the end of the war you would have been 15 \u2014 16 when your parents found\nout \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, that\u2019s right. So then, in the meantime, m-my father had started\nthis bakery with an aqua \u2014 with a f \u2014 with a \u2014 an acquaintance, but they didn\u2019t get\nalong too well, as partners frequently do. And my father decided then to get out of\nthe bakery. And he sold his interest to his partner, and he had had friends from\nCincinnati that had moved to Vineland, New Jersey, and started a poultry farm\nduring the war. And th-they were always in touch with the \u2014 with these people, they\nwere close friends. And they convinced them to come to Vineland, New Jersey and\nalso start a poultry farm, which turned out to be a big mistake because although\nduring the war those farms made a lot of business, after the war that business really\nfaded. They couldn\u2019t compete with the large farms in the Midwest and on the\neastern shore of Maryland. So unfortunately that was \u2014 turned out to be a big\nNovember 18, 1997\nmistake for \u2014 for my parents, although they made the best of it. Unfortunately my\nfather died very young, at 62, of cancer.",
        "Q: That would have been how long ago?",
        "A: And that was in 1957, shortly before I graduated from school. What happened\nwas, in 1951, I was \u2014 see, I \u2014 we left Cincinnati, that sort of \u2014 I guess that \u2014 there\nwas a certain upheaval there f\u2014 and \u2014 and th \u2014 I could \u2014",
        "Q: Now the year you left Cincinnati was?",
        "A: Was 48.",
        "Q: \u00b048. So you had graduated from high school?",
        "A: I just graduated from high school in 1948.",
        "Q: Was that part of the timing that they wanted to \u2014",
        "A: Yes, probably.",
        "Q: \u2014 stay in Cincinnati so you could graduate?",
        "A: Yes, I think that was probably part of it. I graduated in \u201948, and then my parents\nmoved there. But tha-that was a bit of an upheaval for me. And as a result, if I'd\nstayed in Cincinnati, I\u2019m sure I would have just gone to the University of\nCincinnati right then and there. But because of that upheaval, I \u2014 moving to New\nJersey, I didn\u2019t go to college at that time, and I was a little confused about what I\nwanted to do, as teenagers frequently are. And what happened was, I got a job in\nNovember 18, 1997\nVineland, with the Vineland newspaper, the Vineland Times Journal as a sort of\na \u2014arunner, a boy, you know, in the office, and I would run errands and take out\nproofs of ads to advertisers to get their approval, and things like that. And did that\nfor a while, and then of course in 1951, I was drafted. It was the Korean War, and\nthat was a quite traumatic for my parents, that \u2014",
        "Q: Now, bef \u2014 before that, in the first few years in Vineland, had you sort of\nexpected that you would continue in that direction, or did you think about going to\ncollege at some point \u2014",
        "A: I did think about it, but I\u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 it \u2014 because of the move perhaps, and \u2014 and\nthen the other thing was, my parents found, as I said, the business, the \u2014 the \u2014 the\npoultry business got \u2014 eggs business got to be rather poor, and they had a great deal\nof difficulty making ends meet, so I went \u2014 decide well, I can just go out to work.\nThat was probably part of that.",
        "Q: So you felt you had to help support the family?",
        "A: Well, at least support myself. So I did that, and then, as I say, I was drafted in\n1951, and \u2014",
        "Q: How did you feel about being drafted?",
        "A: Well, it sort of gave me a focus, cause now I had \u2014 had no choi \u2014 I knew what I\nwas doing. And although my parents of course, were very concerned. I mean, we\nNovember 18, 1997\nlost all these people in the war, and now their only son was going into the service.\nAnd what happened was, I was sent to Arkansas, Camp Chaffee for my \u2014 for my\nbasic training. And decided to sign up for OCS, Officers\u2019 Candidate School. Took\nthe test for OCS and was admitted to a class which was to start about six weeks\nafter my basic training was to be completed. So in the meantime, I was sent to what\nwas called leadership school, which was really for \u2014 a school for non-commissioned\nofficers. But since I had the six weeks, they had to do something with me, so they\nsent me there. And I was in \u2014I had an accident, training accident and \u2014 and very\nserious foot \u2014 fracture of my foot. What happened was the the trails of the 105\nHowitzers \u2014 this was an artillery base, and we were ar \u2014 taking artillery training.\nAnd [| had an accident with a 105 Howitzer, which almost cut off my foot. But\nfortunately it didn\u2019t, but 1t was a serious fracture, and I was sent to the hospital. And\nthat was in May of 1952, and was in the hospital through the following January. So\nby that time, I no longer had enough time to be sent to Korea. You had to have a ba\n\u2014at least a year of remaining service to be sent overseas. So I didn\u2019t have that time\nany more. And so I was kept at the hospital as a clerk. They had to assign me\nsomewhere. And spent the rest of my time as a clerk 1n the hospital and was\ndischarged in November of 1953.",
        "Q: What happened to your relationship with your parents during this \u2014\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Well my parents, you know, once they realized that the accident was not that \u2014\nwell, it was serious, but it certainly wasn\u2019t fatal, and fortunately the surgery was\nvery successful on my foot. And although I was in the hospital a good deal of the\ntime, my parents, in effect, had the s \u2014 had \u2014 felt a sense of relief that I wasn\u2019t going\nto be sent to Korea. And in fact, I went home a good deal of time because of my\ninjury. After the surgery and a brief rehabilitation in the hospital, they sent me on a\n30 day leave to home, just waiting for this thing to heal. I came back, they changed\nthe cast and took out the pins from my foot, sent me on another 30 day leave. I was\nhome on three 30 day leaves and one 14 day leave before I got out of the hospital.\nSo I had to \u2014 and then, of course, I spent the rest of my time in Arkansas as a clerk\nin the hospital. Then when I got out of \u2014 out of the hospital, of course I had the ben\n\u2014 or \u2014 or out of the service, I got the benefits of the G.I. Bill. And as a disabled\nveteran, in quotes disabled, because of the injury \u2014 and I was somewhat\nhandicapped, at least initially, because of that I had pains in my foot and \u2014 but not\nthat serious. But they \u2014 but I did get the \u2014 a minimum disability as a result, from the\n\u2014 from the sw \u2014 when I was discharged from the service. As a disabled veteran, the\nbenefits of the G.I. Bill were quite considerable. They \u2014 what \u2014 what \u2014 it was called\nwas rehabilitation. In other words, they were going to rehabilitate you so that you\ncould do something. So I \u2014 they paid for four years at the University of\nNovember 18, 1997\nPennsylvania, all my tuition; I went to the Wharton School, and Uncle Sam paid\nfor everything. Cause my parents certainly couldn\u2019t have afforded to pay, not unless\nI had gotten a scholarship or something. I certainly couldn\u2019t have paid for that kind\nof tuition. So fortunate \u2014 I was very \u2014 in a way, this injury was very fortunate. So\nthen I \u2014 I had four years at the University of Pennsylvania, which I also enjoyed\nvery much. That was a great time. Cause I was getting paid to go to school. Not\nonly did they pay for all the tuition and books and fees, but I got a subsistence\nallowance for living, which I could do very well [indecipherable]. And in 1950 \u2014\nlate \u00b056, I met Jill.",
        "Q: Now, were you at the Wharton School?",
        "A: Yes. I was still in school when I met Jill. We were introduced by a mutual\nfriend. At first we \u2014 the first time he tried to get us together, of course, neither one\nof us could manage to get together. But he wouldn\u2019t give up, and a year and a half\nlater, he tried again, and this time we met. And well, eventually I decided to \u2014 we\ndecided to get married and we did get married just shortly before I graduated from\nschool. Unfortunately, my father at that time got sick, in the summer of 1957. And\nwe married in the \u2014 December of 1957, so my father was dead by the time we\nmarried, unfortunately. But he did know Jill, and he did know we were intending to\nget married. And I graduated in 1958. Now that was difficult for my mother,\nNovember 18, 1997\nbecause now she was widowed and she felt very un \u2014 well, she just felt kind of lost,\nand she \u2014 she felt she couldn\u2019t live alone, so we had some difficulty along those\nlines, and at first \u2014 which was, I think, a big mistake, anlis \u2014 at least initially on our\npart, of course, she lived with us briefly, after we moved to New York. I moved to\nNew York for \u2014 because I got a job there with one of the large \u2014 big eight\naccounting firms. Was called Touche, Niven, Bailey and Smart, now it\u2019s part of\nDeloitte Touche. So \u2014 but eventually my mother \u2014 we [indecipherable] to put her\ninto an apartment of her own, and we were nearby. In fact, it was in the same house\nwhere we lived, initially.",
        "Q: And were you supporting her?",
        "A: No, she was able to support herself. She had, between Social Security and her \u2014\nwhat \u2014 what money she \u2014 she had, she was able to support herself so we didn\u2019t have\nto support her. And \u2014",
        "Q: But did you have to continue to give her a lot of emotional support?",
        "A: Yes, yes. A great deal of emotional support. And I must say, my wife was \u2014 was\nvery good with that, although it was very difficult for us, Jill really handled it very\nwell.",
        "Q: Now, your wife \u2014",
        "A: She did a great deal for my mother.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: \u2014 your wife is a survivor.",
        "A: My wife is also a survivor. Her family left Germany in 1939, very late, but was\nable to leave, and move to \u2014 go to Kenya, East Africa. That\u2019s a long story on \u2014 of\nits own, but they were very fortunate because the \u2014 her \u2014 her immediate family and\nuncles, aunts and cousins, quite a few of them \u2014 and in fact, even two grandparents,\nher father\u2019s parents, and her mother\u2019s mother, also left with them.",
        "Q: Do you think your attraction for each other had something to do with both of you\nbeing survivors?",
        "A: I think so, I think so, although we didn\u2019t think of ourselves as survivors at that\ntime. That term wasn\u2019t really something that we applied to ourselves. I think so,\nbecause we had very common similar backgrounds. It\u2019s \u2014 as it turned out, Jill came\nfrom a place that was very close to where I was born, although my \u2014 our parents\ndidn\u2019t know each other in Germany.",
        "Q: But you had that in common.",
        "A: We did, we did. But now, her family was Orthodox, and over time I guess I sort\nof swung in that direction, as a result.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. You mean, over time after you were married?",
        "A: After we were married, yes, after we were married.",
        "Q: And so you consider yourself Orthodox now?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Yes, yes, I do. But we were able to \u2014 to handle my mother\u2019s problems, although\nthat wasn\u2019t easy at first, but gradually she adjusted more to that. But my \u2014 Jill gave\nher a lot of support and I gave her support, although I \u2014 I was working rather hard\nand Jill, after we had children, didn\u2019t work, so she had some time. And then living,\nat least initially in the same apartment house as we, my \u2014 so we were very \u2014 you\nknow, had \u2014 were able to \u2014 to give my mother a great deal of support.",
        "Q: And when were your children born?",
        "A: Our children \u2014 my son is 32, and my daughter is 30. They were adopted. My\nwife had several miscarriages, and we were never \u2014 we never had children of our\nown. So we decided after the third miscarriage, to adopt children, which we did.",
        "Q: And what was that experience like for you?",
        "A: Well, that was a really very \u2014 it\u2019s emotionally a difficult experience, but we \u2014 we\ndecided that we wanted to do that. And we adopted them through the Louise Wise\nAgency in New York. And that was quite an experience in itself, going through that\nprocedure. But I must say they \u2014 they were supportive because they saw we were\nsincere and they felt that we would make good parents. And we adopted our son\nthen when he was \u2014 well, he was about three months old. And so then short \u2014 then\nthree years later we decided maybe we should try for another adoption, which was\nvery unusual. The agency did not give out a lot of second children. They had just\nNovember 18, 1997\nstarted a program \u2014 in fact, initially, when we adopted our son, they gave out no\nsecond children.",
        "Q: Was that because they didn\u2019t have enough children?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And then they, somewhere during that time period, apparently, they started a\nprogram for giving out second children. They felt that perhaps it might be good for\nthe children, that they would have siblings, or go to a family, not be an only child.\nSo they started a program to place second children, and we were able to get into that\nprogram. And then we adopted my daughter about three years after my son. And\nshe again was about three months old when we adopted her.",
        "Q: And were they Jewish babies?",
        "A: Yes. In New York at that time, the law was that you \u2014 they \u2014 the children could\nonly be placed in homes of the religion of their mother. So the agency could only\nplace Jewish children, and it could only place them in Jewish homes. Except that\nthere was one exce \u2014 an interesting exception. There was a program for Native\nAmericans adoption. You c \u2014 the law did not apply to Native Americans. And they\nalso had a program for placing Native American children. It was a rather small\nNovember 18, 1997\nprogram. We never got \u2014 did adopt a Native American child. But that was the only\nexception at that time.",
        "Q: Would that have been your choice, to adopt Jewish babies?",
        "A: Not necessarily, because we \u2014 they could have become Jewish. So that \u2014 it just\nworked out that way because when we went \u2014 the agents \u2014 had we not been able to\nadopt through the agency, we probably would have tried some other means, but it\nall worked out very well. So \u2014 and \u2014 so then after we adopted my daughter \u2014 well,\nfirst of all, the agency required that you have a separate room for each of the\nchildren, that was one of the conditions. We only had a thr \u2014 two bedroom\napartment, and my son was already in the second bedroom. So we \u2014 we told the\nagency we would get a sec \u2014 a third \u2014 another bedroom for the \u2014 for \u2014 for my\ndaughter eventually, so we looked for a house. So on \u2014 on the condition that we\nwould, you know, provide a second bedroom for the \u2014 my daughter, they placed my\ndaughter with us on \u2014 she was still in the \u2014 we were still in the apartment. But what\nwe did was we made a room out of a dinette area, temporarily, for my daughter.\nAnd somewhere after that we \u2014 we did move into a house, and then we had a\nbedroom for each child. And meanwhile I was working, and I worked for five years\nfor a public accounting firm, Touche, and \u2014 whose name changed several times\nwhile I was working for them. But by th \u2014 when I left they were called Touche\nNovember 18, 1997\nRoss. And after about five years I went with a company called Mark Marietta(ph)\nin New York, at the headquarters. It was shortly after the company was formed, it\nwas a merger of two other companies, that\u2019s \u2014 is frequently the case. And I was\nwith them until I retired really, in 19 \u2014 at the age of 62, in 1992.",
        "Q: Now, how did you get to Washington?",
        "A: Ah yes, how did we get to Washington, all right. In the meantime, was oh, in\nthe early 70s, my mother began to develop signs of dementia. So we \u2014 1n the \u2014 in\nthe meantime, she had moved out of her \u2014 the apartment in the house that we lived\nin, and taken an apartment in a \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in a building that was built for senior\ncitizen resident, as a senior citizen residence. She was very happy there. It was not\ntoo far from us. But while she was there she began to develop signs of dementia.\nAnd at the suggestion of her doctors and based on our own observations we decided\nthat she probably should go into a \u2014 some kind of a home. And after looking around\nvery long and hard, we found a place in upstate New York, in New Rochelle. There\nwas a very good Jewish philanthropic home there, which is still there. And we\ndecided of all the places we saw, this was the most approp \u2014 the best and most\nappropriate, and they accepted my mother. And this was in 1974, and two \u2014 oh,\nmaybe two weeks after they had accepted my mother, the company said oh, by the\nway, we\u2019re moving the headquarters to Bethesda, Maryland. Now we knew that\nNovember 18, 1997\nthey were considering moving, but it \u2014 but the actual knowledge that the move was\ngoing to take place occurred just as my mother had been accepted in this home. So\nwe said, well, can\u2019t put my mother there, we\u2019ll have to try to place her down here.\nWe decided to move down here, that was [indecipherable] company\n[indecipherable]. As it turned out, we couldn\u2019t place my mother in a home here.\nWe tried some alternatives for her, but it did not work out and we went back to the\nhome in New Rochelle and said, would they accept my mother? We couldn\u2019t place\nher in the Hebrew home here. They had \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t accept her, they didn\u2019t\nhave the facilities, she was an out-of-stater, so forth and so on. And they said well,\nif she\u2019s in no worse condition that she was when we accepted her, we\u2019ll take her.\nAnd of course, she was in worse condition. Except we were fortunate, the one day\nwe took her up there she had a very good day. I fl\u2014 we flew \u2014 I flew up with her,\nand she had a great day, and they said fine, she\u2019s no worse than she was then, and\nthey took her in. And although we felt very unhappy about placing my mother in\nNew Rochelle, when we were here with our family, there was \u2014 there seemed to be\nno alternative. We decided to do that and she lived there for about four years before\nshe died. And we went up there roughly almost once a month. One of us would go,\neither I would go or Jill would go, on a \u2014 usually on a Sunday to see my mother.\nAnd of course, her condition deteriorated, so after awhile she really didn\u2019t even\nNovember 18, 1997\nknow us any more, which 1s typical for that condition. But \u2014 so we took someone to\nhelp, we hired someone to help, you know, take \u2014 supplement the care that she was\ngetting in the home. And that worked out reasonably well in terms of her condition.\nAnd then, of course, eventually she died, after about four years in the home.",
        "Q: That was when?",
        "A: Well, let\u2019s see, that was \u2014 we moved here in \u201974, it was about \u201970\n[indecipherable] \u201977. Meanwhile, of course, we were here with our children, and I\nwas continuing my work with the company. And Jill, when the children grew up\ndecided she wanted to do something again, and she went, started selling real estate.\nWe had \u2014 the children grew up, that was a mixed bag. They had very bad teenage\nyears, and my daughter was the most difficult child. She had a terrible teenage time.\nI won\u2019t go into all the details, but she ran away from home several times. We finally\nhad to \u2014 finally her condition got to be so bad, we hospitalized her briefly. And that\nhelped her a great deal. That really helped her. She was hospitalized almost a year.",
        "Q: That was a tough time for you.",
        "A: It was a very tough time for us. And meanwhile my son, although he was not as\nrebellious as my daughter, or as difficult as my daughter, was also having a rather\ndifficult teenage time. But my daughter somehow managed, as a result of the\nhospitalization, to pull herself together and her condition improved. And although it\nNovember 18, 1997\nwas far from perfect, nevertheless now she is married, and she has a s \u2014 husband,\nand she has two lovely children, and \u2014 and although she never made it to college,\nshe did graduate high school, and they\u2019re living in Florida. And my son did get\nthrough \u2014 finally did go through the University of penns \u2014 of Maryland. And he\u2019s\nturned out to be a very nice, responsible individual, and we\u2019re very close to both\nchildren. And my son lives in New York with his family, he also has two children.\nAnd we \u2014 in fact, his little boy was just born two weeks ago.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re a grandfather again.",
        "A: A grandfather four times now. And so he has a little girl, as not \u2014 just under two,\nand a little boy. And my daughter also has a little girl and a little boy we\u2019re very\nclose to. And they\u2019re lovely children. So we enjoy being grandparents.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. We have to turn the tape.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nNovember 18, 1997\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Kurt Pauly, conducted by Margaret Garrett\non November 18, 1997, in Silver Spring, Maryland. Tape number two, side A. Mr.\nPauly, could you talk about your beginning to volunteer at the museum?",
        "A: Yes. I retired in 1992, and at that time Jill was still selling real estate, but we\ndecided to look for something to do. And we had heard about the training program\nfor the Holocaust Museum. So we applied, thinking that with our background, it\nwas something we would be very interested in. And as that turned out to be the\ncase. We went and \u2014",
        "Q: You say, with your background, did you have some feelings about \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 being there?",
        "A: Yes, we did, because of all the people that both of us had lost in the Holocaust.\nAnd over the years, you know, you \u2014 you \u2014 as you get older, then you \u2014 you\u2019re\ninterested in what happened in the past. And so we had \u2014 we had to s \u2014 oh, we\u2019d\nbecome more informed about what had happened to our families that \u2014 during the\nwar. And so we felt that this was something we really wanted to do because of our\nNovember 18, 1997\nexperiences in the \u2014 and what had happened to our families. We felt that the\nmuseum was a good memorial, and \u2014 and a \u2014 and \u2014 and a \u2014 very important as a\nplace of learning, and we still feel that way. And people can \u2014 should learn about\nthe Holocaust. So when we \u2014 after our interviews, and when we started the training\nprogram, we felt we, you know, we really had done the right thing and we would \u2014\nwe would \u2014 we would want to do the kind of work that the museum could provide\nUS.",
        "Q: What contributed to your being more sure that that was what you wanted to do?",
        "A: Well, as we saw what the museum was, and how it was going about its mission\nas a\u2014a place of learning, and a place where people could come to see what had\noccurred, particularly people who might not otherwise have been able to have that\nexperience. We felt that that was a very fitting kind of activity for us, sort of a \u2014 sort\nof a memorial of our own for the people that we had lost in the Holocaust. And I\nthink we still feel that way about it. So we went \u2014 visitor services is \u2014 1s the work\nthat we ended up doing. And now Jill though, has left the \u2014 at least temporarily the\nvisitor services to work for the \u2014 work for Marty Goldman in his office. And I still\ncontinue with the visitor services.",
        "Q: And what is Marty Goldman\u2019s office?",
        "A: Office is \u2014 his \u2014 his is the Office of Volunteer Survivors\u2019 Affairs.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: And what do you do in your volunteer [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, in \u2014 as visitor services, we do the usual thing. We are at the information\ndesk at the elevators, we orient groups, and just generally trying to be helpful \u2014",
        "Q: And so \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 to the \u2014 to the visitors that come in.",
        "Q: Do you do all of those at various times?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, at various times we do that.",
        "Q: And how often do you go?",
        "A: We go 1n, well, once a week, on Thursday afternoons is our time. And I must\nsay, our group had been very stable. Almost all of those \u2014 almost all of those\nvolunteers are people who started with us when the museum opened, and have been\ncoming on Thursday afternoons since the museum opened.",
        "Q: And so you started when the museum opened?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: So you were in the very first group.",
        "A: Yes, we were in the first group, with the first group. We were there for the\ndedication and we\u2019ve been there ever since.",
        "Q: Do you participate in other museum activities?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Not too much, because we have other things. But well, when they have, you\nknow, meetings and other things, sometimes we go. We go sometimes to \u2014\noccasionally some of the classes, although we haven\u2019t gone to too many of them,\nbecause they\u2019re in the evening and \u2014 and we\u2019re tired on Thursday afternoons and \u2014\nalthough occasionally we go in for something special, that we\u2019re particularly\ninterested in.",
        "Q: So the group of volunteers on thirdy \u2014 Thursday afternoon has remained fairly\nstable.",
        "A: Very stable there, yes.",
        "Q: And you\u2019ve gotten to know the others?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, we\u2019re friendly with them, sort of on a \u2014 on a volunteer basis. We\ndon\u2019t really get together with them otherwise, socially, but \u2014 but we all feel very\nclose to each other as volunteers.",
        "Q: And do you feel that the volunteers work pretty well together, or that sometimes\nthere are frictions and tensions and \u2014",
        "A: No, we \u2014 we \u2014 we seem to be a very homogeneous or at least a very \u2014 not\nnecessarily homogeneous group, but we seem to get along very well together, and\nwe haven\u2019t had any great co \u2014 any conflicts with each other. We \u2014 we \u2014 we are all\nvery happy together.\nNovember 18, 1997",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: So you had to stop and think about that \u2014",
        "A: Yes, \u2019'm-\u2014 I\u2019m close \u2014 there\u2019s one woman who comes whose husband was a\nsurvivor, but she\u2019s the only one that\u2019s close.",
        "Q: And do you feel different from the others in that you are a survivor and they are\nnot, or do they see you differently?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if we see each other that wa \u2014 well, obviously we\u2019ve had some\ndifferent experiences, but because we were child survivors and also because we\nwere not really directly in the camps, we weren\u2019t in the \u2014 in the Holocaust in that\nsense, we don\u2019t quite have the same experiences that the people who went through\nthe camps had. Those survivors, I think we feel very different than they do. So we \u2014\nwe probably don\u2019t feel as different as these other volunteers, although we do feel\nsomewhat different because of \u2014 of our experiences and the things that we \u2014 we saw\nhappening to our families.",
        "Q: Do you feel that you have a greater emotional understanding of what it\u2019s about?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but \u2014 I don\u2019t know if we have or not, but I th-\u2014 we f - we \u2014 we\ncertainly have a lot of feelings about the museum. Initially, when we were f \u2014 the\nvolunteer program had the \u2014 had the volunteers spend time in the exhibition, in the\npermanent exhibition. And that was part of your daily tour, you would spend your\ntime on \u2014 on the floor. And we began to complain about that because we \u2014 it was\nemotionally too draining to see that exhibit all the time.",
        "Q: We, you mean, we \u2014",
        "A: The volunteers \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 the volunteer survivors?",
        "A: \u2014 and the \u2014 yes \u2014 no, all the volunteers \u2014",
        "Q: All the volunteers.",
        "A: \u2014 began to feel that and we, maybe we felt it even more, because of our\nexperience, bu-but all of them began to feel that that was just too much pressure and\nit was emotionally too upsetting to be in the exhibit that frequently, and for such\nlong periods of time. As I put it, going through the exhibit, after awhile the pictures\nthat you saw, the images you saw began to be almost like \u2014 like family, they were \u2014\nthey became so familiar, 1t was almost like looking into a family album, and it was\njust emotionally too wrenching to s \u2014 to do that all the time. Now, once in awhile\nwe do go through the exhibit again, and we saw \u2014 us-usually when we do, we find\nNovember 18, 1997\nwe see something we didn\u2019t see before. But we can\u2019t handle it on a da\u2014 ona\nweekly basis.",
        "Q: You say we go through \u2014",
        "A: Jill and I.",
        "Q: You and Jill go through it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and \u2014",
        "A: Oh, some of the other volunteers also do.",
        "Q: And you do that just on your own initiative \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 to kind of refresh the experience?",
        "A: Yes sometimes. Or sometimes we have friends who come in, and we\u2019ll go with\nthem, and sometimes we\u2019ll accompany them through the exhibit. But on-only\ninfrequently will we go through. But we do want to go through periodically.",
        "Q: And could you say something about the direct experience that you have with the\nvisitors, what that feels like for you?",
        "A: Well, of course, in most cases it\u2019s \u2014 th \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not ver \u2014 you do \u2014 you don\u2019t\nhave too much reaction, but it c \u2014 but periodically you find that there are people\nwho really have some kind of em-emotional experience they want to convey to\nNovember 18, 1997\nsomeone, and they \u2014 they do that, and they come up and they speak to the\nvolunteers.",
        "Q: This is an emotional experience that they have in the museum \u2014",
        "A: In the museum.",
        "Q: \u2014 after \u2014",
        "A: Afterwards, they come and \u2014 and \u2014 and they want to speak to somebody about it.\nI guess they just feel they have to get it off their che \u2014 out \u2014 off their chest, or they\nwant to pass it along to someone in the museum, that \u2014 that \u2014 this experience that\nthey\u2019ve had. Just a few months ago I had a very interesting experience. A woman\ncame in who spoke \u2014 didn\u2019t speak too much English, she was German, a German\nteacher. And so she had come up to one of the other volunteers who knew that I\nspoke German, so she brought this woman over. So we spoke, and she said she was\na teacher and she was here on some conference and she wanted to see the Holocaust\nMuseum. And afterwards, she came up to me and she s \u2014 was very emotional about\nwhat she had seen. And she said now, she said, I\u2019m really happy that I\u2019ve seen this,\nbecause now no one in Germany can tell me that they didn\u2019t know what was going\non during the war. She said, and I have to pass this along to my grandchildren and\nmy children. She said, I want them to know, make sure that they know what\nhappened. So occasionally you get those kind of reactions. Or people who are just\nNovember 18, 1997\nvery emotional about what they\u2019ve seen for some reason. Either just because the\nwhole exhibit is that way, or they\u2019ve had some experience in their lives that attaches\nthem to the Holocaust in some way. Some family member, or they themselves; we\nfrequently get other survivors who come in the museum and come up to us and tell\nus a little bit about what they felt when they went through the exhibit.",
        "Q: So how has that affected your life the other six days of the week? Does that\nmake your experiences more intense, or \u2014",
        "A: I think we feel an attachment now to \u2014 to the museum, and to the \u2014 and to \u2014 to\nthe people who come, because it seems to be an experience that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s important\nto them in many cases. And we\u2019re very kin \u2014 we\u2019re particularly also very interested\nin seeing all these children that come in, these children\u2019s groups, school groups.\nNow, some of them, of course, probably don\u2019t get much reaction. You know how\nchildren are sometimes, it\u2019s just another thing on their list. But many of them seem\nto be very interested and do get something positive out of that experience. And\nthat\u2019s always something very worthwhile, when you see that.",
        "Q: So when you leave at the end of your duty every Thursday afternoon, how are\nyou usually feeling?",
        "A: Very tired. Not only fi \u2014 not \u2014 not so much physically all the time, but\nemotionally sometimes draining. But \u2014 but we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re \u2014 but I feel good about it,\nNovember 18, 1997\nand Jill does too, although she decided to stop the visitors\u2019 service work for a\ncouple of reasons; one, it was getting to be physically to \u2014 diff \u2014 hard on her. She\nfelt that it was too tiring, and she wanted to try something else for awhile. Not that\nshe was unhappy doing it, it was almost physical, more than anything else. You\nknow \u2014 even though, you know, a lot of people say well, you\u2019re always doing the\nsame thing, and there\u2019s no \u2014 but it isn\u2019t always the same thing. It isn\u2019t always the\nsame thing.",
        "Q: So when people come up and want to talk to someone and you\u2019re it, that \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s very satisfying. Or you can answer questions for people. Lot of people\ncome who have no experience or understanding of what happened in the Holocaust\nand after they\u2019ve seen it, or even be \u2014 sometimes before they see it, they have\nquestions, and they want to ask someone, or \u2014 or they want to tell you something.\nAnd if you can help them deal with that, or answer their questions, that\u2019s very\nsatisfying, cause that place 1s a place where people should learn.",
        "Q: Is there any more you want to say about that experience before we move on to a\nnew subject?",
        "A: Oh, I think that about covers it. I think that\u2019s the \u2014 the satisfaction we get out of\nit is \u2014 is \u2014 1s \u2014 1s dual. One 1s satisfying to us because of what we\u2019re doing, and it\u2019s\nNovember 18, 1997\nalso satisfying because we feel that that\u2019s something we\u2019ve done for the people that\nwere lost in the Holocaust.",
        "Q: Have you made trips back to Germany or Israel\u2019?",
        "A: Well, we made trips to Israel, yes. And of course, we went to Yad Vashem and\nthat \u2014 lo-long before we had a museum here in Washington. Now that\u2019s a very\ndifferent kind of institution. We found that to be emotionally very difficult to\nhandle, Yad Vashem, as well. But I f\u2014I find that I n \u2014 in a way I find the museum\nhere easier to handle than I did Yad Vashem for some reason. I\u2019m not sure what it\nwas, but \u2014 or maybe it was just because the time has passed and I\u2019ve just adjusted\nbetter to handling my emotions in relation to that.",
        "Q: Oh, this was the first Holocaust museum you had [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, yes, and that was many years \u2014 the first time we went was many \u2014 that was\nmany years ago. And \u2014 and on our other trips to Israel we never \u2014 we never went\nback to the \u2014 to the \u2014 to Yad Vashem, because we found it emotionally so\nupsetting.",
        "Q: Do you think if it had not been so upsetting, you might have considered going?",
        "A: Maybe, maybe. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: How was it for you otherwise, visiting Israel?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Oh, well we \u2014 we liked visiting 1s \u2014 we went several times with the \u2014 when the\nchildren were young and we\u2019ve gone since. And of course my ve \u2014 my cousin is\nthere, my \u2014 my mother\u2019s nephew. And we\u2019re close to \u2014 because \u2014 in a way, because\nwe \u2014 we have so little family. He also has very little family. All those cousins that\nwe would have had, and other family members are all gone. And that\u2019s kind of a tie\nthat we have with him.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s a very important part of \u2014",
        "A: Yes, it 1s.",
        "Q: \u2014 going to Israel \u2014",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: \u2014 to see him.",
        "A: Yes. Although, as I said to you before, we visited him si \u2014 he\u2019s with the foreign\nservice, the \u2014 the Israeli foreign service, so we\u2019ve seen him in Europe several\ntimes. And he\u2019s been in je \u2014 both times he\u2019s been stationed in Germany, because he\nspeaks German so well. And of course for him it\u2019s a different experience, as \u2014 well,\nyou know, to be there as a \u2014 as a \u2014 and in that capacity \u2014",
        "Q: What was it like for you to visit Germany?",
        "A: Well, the first time we went to Germany was in 1983. Was the first time we,\neither one of us, had been back to Germany. And we didn\u2019t know what our reaction\nNovember 18, 1997\nwould be when we went. And we both \u2014 we went to both where Jill had come from,\nand also to Aachen and Eilendorf where my mother\u2019s family had come from. And\nit was a little difficult to handle, but \u2014 but Jill wanted to go back as \u2014 and I wanted\nto go back, just to see where our \u2014 where we\u2019d come from and where our parents\nand family had been, and what that was like. And Jill had a lot of memories. Jill \u2014\nJill has a\u2014 many more memories, in a way, from her childhood than I do. And of\ncourse she had heard a lot from her parents and grandparents and aunts and uncles\nabout life in Germany, so she wanted to see where they had lived. And I went with\nmy cousin then to Eilendorf, and \u2014 and also Jill went along. And we went to the\nhome, on our own, the home where my \u2014 where his father and my mother had\ngrown up, where they \u2014 and where later my mother had lived, and my father. And\nwhen we got to the \u2014 it was a very interesting experience, we got to the door, we\nknocked and we introduced ourselves and told them who we were. And the woman\nwho answered the door as \u2014 was the \u2014 was the wife of the man who now was\nrunning that butcher shop. And her father-in-law was still alive, and he had been the\napprentice to my grandfather. And when we came in she gave us \u2014 it was almost as\nif she was running a tape, she almost had to get it off her chest as \u2014 this whole story\nthat she remembered of my grandfather.",
        "Q: Had you heard the story before?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: No, we hadn\u2019t heard that story before, and it was \u2014 that was a very emotionally\nlil \u2014 emotional experience because this was such a sad story and \u2014 and Jill and I and\nmy cousin, after we left we sort of said, you know and \u2014 although we understood\nwha \u2014 but why couldn\u2019t, you know, someone like that have perhaps taken him and\nhidden him? But you know, of course, that was very dangerous to do, and \u2014 and of\ncourse they had no obligation to do it. It was good enough of them, I guess, that\nthey helped him with food, and so forth. But \u2014 but for us it was so terribly sad to\nhear that. First, you know, from someone who had seen him, and \u2014 and so we went\naway. We were rather depressed when we left that \u2014 at that time. Although the\npeople were very nice people. And we had no \u2014 we really didn\u2019t have any bad\nfeelings about them. And my parents \u2014",
        "Q: But you did have the feelings of why couldn\u2019t someone \u2014",
        "A: Yes \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 have hidden him?",
        "A: \u2014 that\u2019s right, exactly, we sort of had those feelings. Because my mother, my \u2014\nhad always spoken well of those people. I mean, you know, she had had very\npositive feelings toward them. And \u2014 sort of the people that she knew in her\nchildhood, and of course thought of \u2014 all of them obviously weren\u2019t Nazis,\nnecessarily. So we f\u2014 we \u2014 you know, we didn\u2019t have any bad feelings about it. But\nNovember 18, 1997\nthat was a terrible feeling to go away, and having heard that story from someone\nwho had actually experienced it, and knowing what fate had befallen my\ngrandfather. Then we went back again, this time in 1997 at the invitation of the city\nof Aachen. And they had arranged \u2014 they had a pr \u2014 they have a pr \u2014 they have the\nprog \u2014 a program to bring back sa \u2014 people who has \u2014 had been in Aachen and had\nbeen forced to flee, because of the Nazis.",
        "Q: Jews and were there others?",
        "A: No, were Jew \u2014 no, Jews. I don\u2019t think there was anyone who wasn\u2019t Jewish that\nhad been brought back. And since they had missed us on the first program that they\nhad \u2014 they had a large group about three, four years earlier, this was a very \u2014 ina\nway it was very good that maybe they\u2019d missed us because now there were only\ntwo of us there, and so it was a very personalized kind of thing, very personal. And\nthey had arranged for us to meet this group. I call them the \u2014 call them the historical\nsociety, but their actual name would \u2014 closer is the Heimatverein, which sort of a \u2014\na home \u2014 a hometown club. But basically they\u2019re a historical society, that\u2019s what\nthey\u2019re interested in, they\u2019re interested in the history of \u2014 of this part of Aachen,\nEilendorf, that they \u2014 their family \u2014 where they live, and where their families have\nlived for generations as well. And when we came they wanted us to \u2014 to meet with\nthem, and to tell us what they knew about the Jews that had lived in Eilendorf, and\nNovember 18, 1997\nalso to see what \u2014 what our experiences had been after we left. So they \u2014 so we not\nonly got the usual tours, but we actually met with people, including my former ne \u2014\nnanny, and some other people who had lived there for \u2014 during the time when my\nparents were still there, although most of the people were much too young to have\nbeen anything but children, or even some of them were, of course, obviously not\neven born til after the war. But they were very interested in what had happened to\nthese \u2014 their former \u2014 the former residents, the Jewish residents of this little town of\nEilendorf, which was now incorporated into Aachen, cause the \u2014 so they had done\nall this genealogical research on my mother\u2019s family. And one other interesting\naspect, by the way of that, I just mention in passing; my mother had always said that\nshe was related to Annie Frank\u2019s family, and we never quite knew how. So we had\nmentioned this to them. And the facts \u2014 my mother told the story that when Annie\nFrank\u2019s grandmother, maternal grandmother and \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, yes \u2014 of \u2014 paternal\ngrandmother, was very ill. She was one of the people [indecipherable] sort of a\ndistant member of the family, that came when \u2014 during her illness, and she spent\nsome time with her. But we never quite knew what the relationship was, so we\nmentioned it to them and subsequently they deg \u2014 dug into the genealogy and they\nfound out what the connection was, that Annie Frank and I had the same great-\ngreat-grandparents on her father\u2019s side, which was, you know, her mother\u2019s \u2014 well,\nNovember 18, 1997\nher mother\u2019s side. I\u2019m sorry, not her father\u2019s side, her mother\u2019s side. So we had the\nsame great-great-grandparents, that\u2019s where the relationship came in. Which was\nvery interesting to hear. And my mother always said that I had played with her and\nher sister at some time, but I don\u2019t have any memories of that.",
        "Q: What was it like seeing your nanny again?",
        "A: That was a very \u2014 first of all, it was a big surprise, because I didn\u2019t even know\nshe was still alive. Of course I \u2014 I didn\u2019t know at that time what her age was,\nbecause, you know, when you\u2019re six years old everybody \u2014 I thought she was much\nolder than she obviously was. But it was \u2014 it \u2014 it was a sort of bittersweet thing.\nObviously, it was wonderful seeing her again, and hearing her stories. On the other\nhand, some of the things sh-she told us, were very unhappy things, about, you\nknow, what my \u2014 what had began \u2014 sort of experiences my parents had [phone\nringing] after the Nazis came in and \u2014 and the time we were leaving, and what she\nknew about the family, what had happened to my cousins and so forth. So that was\nan unhappy part, but on the other hand, we were very happy to hear from someone\nwho had known the family and had remembered \u2014 of course, we also went to the\ncemetery where my great-great grandparents, great grandparents, my grandmother\nall are buried. And my \u2014 and my mother\u2019s twin sister, who died of a \u2014 of the\ninfluenza epidemics after the first World War. All these people are buried there, at\nNovember 18, 1997\nthis little cemetery in Eilendorf, and it\u2019s still there, those stones are still standing.\nSo that was a bit of a \u2014 a \u2014 that sort of gives you an \u2014 at a time now, you know,\nyou ve heard these stories, but to actually see it, actually see where these people are\nburied, and to see that, give you a sort of a more immediate \u2014 more immediacy to \u2014\nto all the things that you heard. It gives it a mo \u2014 a newer reality, so to speak. It was\ninteresting, we also \u2014 we also spoke there to one of the school groups there, they\nhad asked us to do \u2014 whether we would do that, speak to a group of children. That\noccurred both in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in Cologne when my wife went back there last year,\nand this year when we were in Aachen. Both times the \u2014 the people there asked us\nto speak to some school groups. So we did, we spoke to a group in the school called\nthe Pius gymnasium, named after Pope pa \u2014 one of the popes, Pope Pius, one of the\nPius\u2019s, I guess. And \u2014",
        "Q: So this was a Catholic school?",
        "A: It \u2014 yes, but it\u2019s a public school in Germany.",
        "Q: What does that mean?",
        "A: Well, it means that it is \u2014 in Germany they \u2014 these schools are also supported by\nthe state. In other words, they\u2019re not private schools in the sense that we have here.\nAnd \u2014",
        "Q: So it\u2019s supported financially by the state \u2014\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Partly, yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 but the Catholic \u2014",
        "A: Yes, but it\u2019s a\u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 church runs the school?",
        "A: Yes, yes, it\u2019s a Catholic \u2014 well, yes, the people there are \u2014 they \u2014 they te \u2014 yes,\nthey \u2014 they have religious classes as well, as well as the usual school classes. So it\u2019s\n\u2014 but we spoke to a group of children, two classes wa \u2014 and \u2014 the ages of 12 to 13.\nAnd they had done a project on Jewish life in that area before the war. So they were\nsomewhat familiar about the history of the Jews in that area, and they had studied\nabout the \u2014 they had sort of a course on comparative religion, so they\u2019d study\nsomething about the Jewish religion as well. So they were interested to hear from us\nabout our experiences. And we did it on a sort of a question and answer basis, rather\nthan just sort of lecture to the students. We s \u2014 we did it on the basis of answering\ntheir questions, which wy \u2014 th-the \u2014 the children got very much involved, we were\nreally surprised at how involved the children got in this question and answer period.\nThey really seemed to show considerable interest in what happened, and \u2014 but wa \u2014\nwhat it meant to be Jewish and what \u2014 a little bit about the Jewish religion, and what\nhad happened to the Jews in Germany during the period of \u2014 of the Nazi regime.",
        "Q: So they were interested and curious. Did you notice any reactions to all this?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Yeah, there was one reaction from the second class. They got very much\ninvolved in \u2014 particularly the \u2014 well \u2014 well \u2014 well, the girls particularly, for some\nreason, I think they\u2019re more outgoing and are willing to \u2014 at that age I think they are\na little more mature than the boys. And after the class was over, they stayed, and\nthey wanted to know about, you know, where we lived and \u2014 and what it was like to\nbe Jewish in the United States, and th \u2014 so they \u2014 I mean, they carried on even after\n\u2014 after the period was over. So they were \u2014 they \u2014 they had \u2014 they showed quite a\nbit of interest.",
        "Q: So they showed interest, did they express any feelings or reactions to the\ninformation they were getting?",
        "A: Not directly. I mean, they didn\u2019t evaluate it. It\u2019s just that their response was so\npositive, that we really felt very good about it.",
        "Q: Positive as far as strong interest?",
        "A: Yeah, strong interest, and the kind of reaction they had, and what they said. And\nwe promised to send them \u2014 the teacher asked us 1n \u2014 also to send us \u2014 her some\ninformation, books and so forth, about the Holocaust, since we were working at the\nmuseum. And we said we would, and we did.",
        "Q: In English?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: In \u2014 well, unfortunately they\u2019re all in English. And we sent them, and we just got\nback \u2014 course, that t-took us a little bit of time after we got home to get it all\ntogether. And then when you send a package like that, it takes awhile to get over\nthere. And we just got this weekend, we just got a letter from a man who was the\nhead of this Heimatverein, this organization, that we\u2019ve gotten somewhat close\nwith him, he\u2019s a younger man. He\u2019s an engineer, he speaks English very well,\ncomes to this country frequently on business. And we\u2019ve been running this through\nhim. In fact, the school that we went to was the school his children go to. So we\nsent the books to him to pass along to the teacher, and he just \u2014 they just got that the\nother week, and he sent us back a long letter saying how much they appreciated it,\nand that the teacher was beginning to get into these books, but could we send them\nsomething in German, because they found it more difficult to handle it in English.\nNow the children have \u2014 do study English, and these children had one year of\nEnglish already when we spoke to them. But obviously that \u2014 they \u2014 it\u2019s easier for\nthem to handle the German. But I don\u2019t know whether we can get some of these\nthings in German, or \u2014 but they \u2014 they were very appreciative of getting this\ninformation.",
        "Q: And so what was that like for you to speak to the children and to get involved\nwith the school?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Well, we were very happy to pass along to them some firsthand experience. In\nother words, we were \u2014 as they say, and there\u2019s a German phrase for it, which really\nsays you\u2019re a witness of the event. We were witnesses of the events that occurred. I\nmean, they\u2019re young children, to them this history is almost like reading history\nabout Ancient Rome in a way. But \u2014 but here were people who actually had the exp\n\u2014 lived in that time f\u2014 period, and had experienced some of these things, and they\nfound it very interesting, and they seemed to take to it very readily, and they were\nvery interested in our experiences. They wanted to hear what had hap \u2014 what we\nhad \u2014 you know, what had happened to us, and why it happened to us. Of course,\nwe couldn\u2019t really tell them why in \u2014 in one sense, but on the other hand, it made\nwhat they had learned in class that much more immediate and real for them, as well.\nAnd we felt very good about being able to pass this along to this chi \u2014 generation,\nbecause those are the people we have to \u2014 hope to \u2014 to get to understand what\noccurred.",
        "Q: We have to turn the tape.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Kurt Pauly, tape number two, side B.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Yes, you were asking about our \u2014 what our feelings were about going to\nGermany, and they are very much a mixed \u2014 a mixed emotional bag. On one side,\nof course, it\u2019s very sad and not happy to go to a place where those thing that we\nknow happened, and some of them which we experienced ourselves happened, that\n\u2014 so that\u2019s the sad side of it. On the other hand, it was good to see where our\nfamilies lived, and also to meet people who showed some sincere interest and\nunderstanding of what occurred, and really wanted to know what happened, and\nwhat our feelings were. Now obviously the people we met in these circumstances,\nare people who have \u2014 well we \u2014 shall we say a positive attitude toward what\noccurred in the Holocaust. I mean \u2014 so in the \u2014 in the sense that they know what\nhappened, and feel that they want to try to make good in some sense, to the limited\nextent that they can, the terrible \u2014 make goods \u2014 you know, the \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 from the\nterrible things that occurred. So it\u2019s very good to meet those kind of people now.\nObviously we know that there\u2019s still anti-Semitism in Germany, and that there are\nstill people running around in Germany who were perhaps directly involved in\nsome of the atrocities that occurred in the Holocaust. So, you know, and so that\ngives you kind of a terrible feeling when you\u2019re just walking down the street and\nyou see someone of an age that you know went through the period as an adult;\nperiod of the Holocaust, period from \u201933 through \u00b045; and you wonder, you know,\nNovember 18, 1997\nyou have this \u2014 this \u2014 this nagging feeling about, you know, who are these people?\nYou know, were they perpetrator, were they di \u2014 were they directly involved? And\nthat\u2019s a very, very difficult emotion to deal with. But on the other hand, I guess it\u2019s\n\u2014 ina way it\u2019s a good thing to face up to that, and to know that both of these sides\nof Germany still exist, and the hope we have 1s for this younger gener \u2014 these\nyounger generation to really understand and that \u2014 what happened, and therefor try\nto make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.",
        "Q: How do you think your experience has affected your current or past political\nviews, or your opinions about national and international issues?",
        "A: Well, I think it pr \u2014 the fact that it happened, and happened to our families,\nhappened to us, that pe \u2014 you know, that here are people who have lived in a\ncountry for hundreds of years, as my family and Jill\u2019s family had done, and really\nfelt German, no question about it. I mean, my father was a soldier in the first World\nWar. And the Jews of Germany were as patriotic Germans as the Jews of America\nare patriotic Americans. I mean, they felt German. And to think that what happened\ncould happen, and did happen, is in a way very disturbing to us individually,\nbecause [phone ringing] somehow you have that nagging feeling that maybe it\ncould happen again, and maybe even could happen here. I mean, I think survivors\nhad more of that feeling than people who did not go through that.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: And you had that feeling more than people who did not \u2014",
        "A: I think so. I think, based on my \u2014 our experiences with people who were not\nsurvivors of the Holocaust, who were not in Europe, who were Americans, and\nhave lived here, didn\u2019t have that experience directly, I think we feel differently than\nthey do. And I get th \u2014 I get the same reaction from other friends of ours who are\nalso survivors, that they have those feelings and those emotions. I just \u2014 you ju \u2014\nthey \u2014 I mean, I guess you can never quite feel as certain about what\u2019s going to\nhappen, and that it\u2019ll be that \u2014 or that something like that occurred in the Holocaust\ncan\u2019t happen again, or can\u2019t happen to Jews again, or can\u2019t happen in this country\nagain, as people who didn\u2019t have that experience. I think that also makes the state of\nIsrael for us, much more important in that sense. That that is something that was\nnot there when the Holocaust occurred, and had it been there, probably things\nwould have been somewhat different, because at least Jews would have had a place\nto go.",
        "Q: How does this feeling affect your politics or your participation in the\ncommunity?",
        "A: Oh, I think \u2014 I don\u2019t know. But I thi \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether it has some of that\ndirect effect \u2014 maybe I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m [indecipherable] our politics might be otherwise,\nbut it definitely, I think, has an effect on how we interpret the events, and what\nNovember 18, 1997\npeople say and do. And when something occurs, maybe we feel \u2014 you know, if we\nsee something \u2014 maybe we are more apt to interpret something as being anti-Jewish\nor anti-Semitic than others, because we said, hey, wait a minute, 1s that really \u2014 you\nknow? And it may not be, but I think you have that reaction more quickly than\npeople who have not gone through something like that.",
        "Q: Does an example come to mind?",
        "A: Well, let me try to think. All right, when we had this \u2014 oh, what was this fellow\ndown in Louisiana? Can\u2019t think. He ran for the U.S. Senate from Louisiana \u2014",
        "Q: Huey Long\u201d",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, much later, recently. A few years ago. No, not Huey Long,\nmuch earlier \u2014 much later than that. I can\u2019t think of his name. He was a really \u2014I\nmean, he really was someone who not so much \u2014 not necessarily anti-Semitic direct,\nbut he was just sort of anti a lot of things, and he had \u2014 obviously was a person with\na great deal of \u2014 of \u2014 of prejudices, in terms of minorities and other people who\nwere not, you know, quite Anglo-Saxon Americans. And when you \u2014 you know, so\nI think our reaction to that was much more fearful in a way, than other Americans\nwho said, oh well, you know, he\u2019s out on a far limb, he\u2019s far \u2014 you know, he\u2019s way\nout of the political s \u2014 on the side of some extreme side of the political spectrum,\nbecause we said, well, people like that who were on the far side of the political\nNovember 18, 1997\nspectrum in Germany, finally got into power, and we said, you know \u2014 so we\u2019re\nmuch more \u2014 I think perhaps we\u2019re much more concerned about those things than\npeople who don\u2019t have those experiences. And when we see it in other parts of the\nworld also, we\u2019re \u2014 we S \u2014 we \u2014 we perhaps in si \u2014 always more fearful that people\nwho have such negative views, in terms of other minority groups, whether it\u2019s here\nor in Europe, or in Asia, can get into a position where they can create the kind of\nregime that did the sort of thing that happened in Germany. I do think that that\u2019s\nsomething that impacts survivors more than others.",
        "Q: And it impacts you more than others.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, as \u2014 me as well, yes. But overall, I think we\u2019re, you know, basically,\nbecause of our age when we left Germany, I think we\u2019re prow \u2014 we are, on the\nother hand, not as much affected as people who even went \u2014 or, you know, who \u2014\nwho went through the camps, who went through the actual events of the \u2014 that\noccurred in Europe in the Holocaust, I don\u2019t think we are \u2014 we don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t think\nwe have quite their emotions, cause they must have a whole other set of emotions,\nand concerns and reactions. But I do think we are also \u2014 but we \u2014 I think we\u2019re\nsomehow different emotionally than people who haven\u2019t had any \u2014 the experience\neven we\u2019ve had.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s had a major, lasting impact on \u2014\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Yes, and I think it had it \u2014 and the other thing 1s, I think it had a \u2014 a terrible\nimpact on our families, our parents. I th \u2014 don\u2019t kn \u2014 you know, there\u2019ve been \u2014\nthere\u2019s been a lot written about people who were in Europe and \u2014 and survived the\nHolocaust in Europe, or \u2014 and what happened to them, people who were in the\ncamps, or hidden, or so forth. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been much written about people\nwho got out of Europe, but had the experiences that our parents had, and what \u2014\nwhat that meant for them, because here were people who were just, you know,\nripped out of their environment, and ripped out of everything that they were used to,\nand were thrown into another world, other countries, and had to adjust, you know,\nto \u2014 try to establish a whole new life for themselves. Now, obviously their\nexperiences were not as horrible as the people who were involved in the camps, but\nthey certainly, I know, are \u2014 both of our families suffered a great deal as a result of\nthat as well. It\u2019s a different kind of suffering and it\u2019s a different kind of experience.",
        "Q: But it\u2019s suffering.",
        "A: But it\u2019s there, nevertheless, yeah. So, I\u2014 I know our children and our nieces and\nnephews and all the people of the next generation, they have again different\nexperience and different feeling because they\u2019re again another step removed from\nthe events in Europe. But I think even those people are somewhat impacted by our\nexperiences, because they\u2019ve heard it.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So it\u2019s a part of their world.",
        "A: Yeah. Now, their children, again, now they\u2019re gonna be another \u2014 further\nremoved from it, and now it really becomes ancient history, in a way. And that\u2019s\nwhy I think the museum is very important, because it brings that history to these\npeople, to these young people, and to the people who had no experience with the\nHolocaust, and says oh hey, wait a minute, here it is, and it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s more immediate\nthan just reading about it, or hearing about it, sort of on the background noise, and\nhopefully it brings it up as a more \u2014 as a \u2014 as a more real experience, that it really\ndid happen, and it happened fairly recently, and it happened to people that are still\nalive today. That was an interesting experience once I had in the museum when I\nwas at the elevators. A young group came \u2014 some young people came through, oh,\nyoung teenagers, maybe again, 12, 13. And one of the boys came up to me while we\nwere waiting \u2014 while they were waiting for the elevator, and he says, is th \u2014 is there\nanybody still alive who \u2014 who experienced this? So to him this was already, you\nknow, really, you know, ancient history. So what I told him I had \u2014 had an exper \u2014\nyou know, that I had lived through that, I guess it was sort of like, you know,\nmeeting Julius Caesar or something, I don\u2019t know. But \u2014 so that \u2014 our whole\nexperience wa \u2014 you know. Now, we don\u2019t want to make the Holocaust, you know,\nsort of a religion of life now because I think that\u2019s a ne \u2014 that\u2019s very negative. But I\nNovember 18, 1997\nthink we have to remember what happened, and \u2014 and live our life knowing those\nevents occurred, and what those mean.",

        "A: Yes. My mother\u2019s family had lived in the vicinity of Aachen, in what was then\nan independent town called Eilendorf, and which is now been incorporated into the\ncity of Aachen. My mother\u2019s family has lived there at least since the middle of the\n18\" century, as far as our records show. And my father\u2019s family came from\nsouthern Germany in Bavaria, and he moved to \u2014 they had lived in Wurzburg,\nwhere my grandparents had a small hotel. And when he married, he moved to\nEilendorf and took over my grandfather\u2019s business, which was a butcher \u2014 a\nbutchery, and lived there with my parents and my grandfather, and who, I am sorry,\nNovember 18, 1997\nlived there with my mother and my grandfather.

        "A: No, I was an only child, probably because of the situation, the political situation\nin Germany at the time.",
        "A: Yes. At least that\u2019s what they always indicated.",
        "A: Oh yes, they said that.",
        "A: Briefly, yes. In fact, we visited it, my home again just last August when we were\nin Germany. It was a \u2014a stone house, two stories, with a large yard in the back, a\nlarge garden in the back. And in the front was the \u2014 was a butcher\u2019s store, which my\ngrandparents had run for many years, and their parents had run before that. And that\nbutcher store still exists; someone\u2019s still in there. My grandfather had sold that\nNovember 18, 1997\nbusiness to his apprentice shortly after we left \u2014 about the time when we left\nGermany in 1936.",

        "A: Yes.",

Sh \u2014 she hired a local\ngirl, she was about \u2014 well, let\u2019s see, she\u2019s 81 \u2014 well, she\u2019s 82 now actually, she \u2014\nher birthday was la \u2014 la \u2014 in September. So she would have been 82. So she would\nhave been what, seven \u2014 four \u2014 15 years old at the time. And she stayed with us\nuntil we left \u2014 until we left Germany.\nNovember 18, 1997",

Her parents lived at a nearby sh \u2014 her mother was \u2014 was left with a\nlarge family, and a \u2014 a sick husband, and so the children had to be \u2014 had to work\nrather early to help her make a living. She used to \u2014 cleaning and things like that,\nand so and \u2014 so Hani(ph) came every morning, and left every evening.",
        "A: From shortly \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 shortly after I was born, til we left Germany in 1936. In fact, when we spoke\nwith her this time on our visit, she recalled many of the incidents just before that.\nThe fact that the Brownshirts were, during the boycott of Jewish stores, were\nstanding outside the store and that she tried \u2014 they tried to discourage people from\ngoing in, but she came in anyway to help, every day. And she still had photographs\nof me when I was \u2014 one was when I was about five years old, and another one,\nwhich was a sort of a group picture when I was shu \u2014 probably about one year old.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Well, I can remember living in the house, and I had a room there. I can\nremember looking out the window of my room and looking out into the garden in\nthe back. And living there, I remember one incident particularly because it\u2019s one of\nthose things that stays in your mind. I must have been probably four years old,\nsomething like that, and the kitchen was two steps down from the level of the store,\nand I would sometimes rush into the kitchen from the store, and I fell. I fell flat on\nmy face. I can remember that so vividly because I \u2014 you know, blood all over the\nplace, I fell right \u2014 my nose was bleeding. And that\u2019s one of my earliest memories\nof an event that occurred there.",
        "A: I think I was about four, four and a half, probably.",
        "A: Oh, my mother, you know, came up to comfort me and my grandfather ran out to\ncomfort me. And what was interesting was, in 1983, when we visited the home for\nthe first time, the people are \u2014 who are living in there are descendants from my\ngrandfather\u2019s apprentice. And, it was the son of the apprentice who was running the\nstore then and shortly now \u2014 shortly, he \u2014 he had, before we came, he had turned the\nbusiness over to his son, who unfortunately though, had a heart attack and died very\nrec \u2014 just recently, shortly before we came. But back in 1983, when we came in, the\nNovember 18, 1997\nappre \u2014 th-the \u2014 my father \u2014 grandfather\u2019s apprentice was still alive. He was an 0 \u2014\nvery old man, but unfortunately his memory was gone. But the \u2014 his \u2014 his son still\nremembered my grandfather. And he remembered that my grandfather, after we had\nleft, my \u2014 the people, the older people \u2014 I don\u2019t remember exactly when, but some\ntime shortly after we left, they were \u2014 the Jewish people were sent to what was then\nthe Jewish old age home in Aachen. They were all collected, and they were c \u2014\nthere. And he says he can remember my grandfather coming to the house because\nthey didn\u2019t get ve \u2014 enough food to eat. He would come to the house there and ask\nthem if he could eat with them, because they were not getting enough food. And\nthat was pros \u2014 as I recall was about 1940 - \u201941. And then after awhile, this man\nsaid, your grandfather just didn\u2019t come any more, so we didn\u2019t know what\nhappened, except they had heard that the Jews had been taken away. And as it\nturned out, the records now show that they\u2019d been taken to Theresienstadt. I also\ncan remember going to school shortly before we left. The school year in \u2014 in\nGermany starts right after Easter. And we left Germany in early summer. So I had\nto go to school briefly, and I can remember that my father was concerned about me\nand my going to school. I had to take a tram to get to school. And he rode behind\nthe tram on a bicycle every day to just observe that nothing would occur. And then\nwould meet the tram sometime on the way back, when I came back from school.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Yes, the school was too far for me to walk. That\u2019s the reason I had to take a\ntram.",
        "A: Get there, no, no.",
        "A: Yes, I did know that.",
        "A: Well, I\u2014 I\u2019m not sure. I think he just didn\u2019t want to \u2014 to \u2014 at first, I Just\n[indecipherable] about somewhat later. Initially I think he just didn\u2019t want to get\nme concerned that he felt that uneasy, that I would have to \u2014 that he would have to\nfollow.",
        "A: Yes, yes, I think so. And it\u2019s also that I wouldn\u2019t have those concerns. I can\nremember this \u2014 so I only went to school very \u2014 a few months. Maybe, at most two,\nbefore we left Germany to go to Palestine.",
        "A: I can remember they had a large, open courtyard. At least it seemed large to me\nat the time, probably wasn\u2019t that large, you know. At this time \u2014 the school is no\nNovember 18, 1997\nlonger there. It was a Jewish school, and \u2014 a Jewish elementary school, which was\nnot uncommon in Germany, they were that \u2014 that \u2014 there \u2014 even before the Nazi\ntimes this [indecipherable] there were schools that were, you know, t \u2014 even today\nthey have parochial school supported by the state, and so that the Jew \u2014 the Jewish\nschools were also partly supported by the state. And I do remember going to school\nvery briefly. I don\u2019t remember too much, except that I was very unhappy going to\nschool. That\u2019s the only time that I was unhappy going to school, I always liked\ngoing to school later.",
        "A: So I must have been some concern.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know. I\u2019m really not sure why that was. Perhaps I had a feeling of\nthe uneasiness of my parents, because by that time my father had been forced to\nclose the store in Aachen already, that we had. Another store, he had two stores.\nAnd he only had the store now in \u2014 in the part \u2014 in Eilendorf. And I suspect that I\nfelt some of the uneasiness of \u2014 that my parents must have had.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Well, I remember being in the classroom. I don\u2019t remember too much about what\noccurred. I remember when we \u2014 first day that I was there, I do have one memory.\nWalked into the classroom and on the blackboard there was a drawing done in chalk\nof a \u2014 of a little boy and a little girl. I guess the teacher had done that, I can recall\nthat \u2014 seeing that. I don\u2019t remember anything really about \u2014 else about the school.",
        "A: Not really, not really.",
        "A: Yes, I\u2014 well, my cousins lived in Eilendorf. My mother had a si \u2014 a sister\nwhose family also lived in Eilendorf, and th \u2014 she had three children. And so I can\nremember playing with them, and I\u2019m \u2014 don\u2019t particularly remember other people\nexcept now, recently we received a letter from someone who had seen the article\nabout our trip to Aachen, and she wrote us a letter. She also knew my \u2014 my nanny,\nbecause her mother, my nanny\u2019s mother, had been a domestic in their house, and\nshe wrote him the letter that she had sometimes played with me because Hani(ph),\nwho was the \u2014 who was the nanny. And she sent me a picture, a class picture that\nshe had, which had \u2014 which included my elder cousin, my oldest cousin Ilsa, who\nwas a classmate of hers. So she was about three years older than I was. And then\nNovember 18, 1997\nshe had a brother and sister who were younger than the brother Eric, was about my\nage, and I can remember playing with him.",
        "A: This woman? No, she was not Jewish. No, no. No, no. And she wrote to us that\nshe can remember meeting the Kunn(ph) family, that was their name, in Aachen\nlater when she sometimes would go in with her mother after they had been forced to\nleave Eilendorf, and I guess they were \u2014 ma \u2014 they \u2014 they must have been gathered\nin some places. All the Jews must have been gathered there, and she can remember\nthough, meeting Ilsa on the street sometimes for a short period of time during \u2014 I\nguess in the early 40s. So she had that memory. So she sent me a very nice letter,\nand she had spoken with me, and she thought I might be interested in having that\npicture of my \u2014 of my cousin, which of course we were very interested in seeing it.",
        "A: No, no, my family was not \u2014 the Jews of Aachen were what we would call in\nthis country, Reform. And the \u2014 my \u2014 my father\u2019s family had been more religious,\nalthough my father was not particularly religious, although we would \u2014 we went to\nsynagogue. And \u2014 but we would have \u2014 we \u2014 the synagogue was too far to walk, so\nwe would have to drive there. So no, the \u2014 this \u2014 the \u2014 the Jew \u2014 the Jews of\nAachen \u2014 there were very few religious Jews in Aachen, most of them were\nNovember 18, 1997\nReform. And then \u2014 that community had been there for quite some time, certainly\nsince the middle of the 18\" century.",
        "A: Not \u2014 no, I don\u2019t remember it particularly from firsthand experiences except my\n\u2014 of course, my parents talked about it from time to time later on.",
        "A: I\u2014no, no, I don\u2019t remember hearing it firsthand. I do remember our trip when\nwe left Germany, I can remember that. I can remember going to say goodbye to my\ngrandmother, my father\u2019s mother, who was still living in Wurzburg at that time,\nand taking the train down there to say goodbye to them.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know that I \u2014 I had that particular understanding of \u2014 at \u2014 at that age, of\nwhy that happened. Of course later my parents told me that these people, they didn\u2019t\nwant to go along, they thought, you know, things would be all right, and they were\nold people, and they felt nothing would happen to them. And so I don\u2019t particularly\nknow, except I do know my parents spoke about it. My father tried very hard to get\nthem to leave. And by the time, of course, they wanted to leave, it was too late. We\nNovember 18, 1997\nwere in Palestine by then, of course, but \u2014 and even when we came to the United\nStates in 1938, it was too late for them to leave, they couldn\u2019t get out.",
        "A: No, not really firsthand, I really don\u2019t know. Later, of course, I learned, you\nknow, about it from my parents. And I heard from Hani(ph), Hani(ph) Dover, the \u2014\nmy nanny, she told us when \u2014 on this last visit sh-she can remember that when my\nfather decided to leave, telling them that he was leaving because there was no future\nin Germany for his son and his family. So my father decided to leave in 19 \u2014\nactually, he told us that he wanted to leave already in 1933, but it took him three\nyear \u2014 almost three years to get it together and to find a place to go. At that time we\ncouldn\u2019t come to the United States because we had no family here. Later, we were\n\u2014Ith\u2014my uncle, my father\u2019s brother came to this country through his wife\u2019s\nfamily and that\u2019s how we came to this country then, through my aunt\u2019s family, who\nwere not Jewish, by the way. They provided an affidavit for my aunt\u2019s family and \u2014\nand two of her sisters, and their family, and for us. Which was quite something to\ndo, because giving an affidavit meant you were taking a responsibility.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Yes. I was a little unhappy leaving my grandparents, I can remember, especially\nmy grandmother, because that was a big trip to go to Wurzburg and to say\ngoodbye, and then we \u2014 and I can remember going to my grandmother before that.\nIn fact, I even have a memory of playing with a \u2014 she had a little red wind-up car,\nand I can remember playing with that in her apartment, which overlooked a square\ncalled the Figurenbrunnen. [ can \u2014 and I can still remember looking down there\nand seeing the fountain in the center of the square and all the traffic and activity that\nwas going on there. And going with my father down to the river, which was not far\nfrom the \u2014 from the house. So I have memories of that.",
        "A: Palestine?",
        "A: We went by train to Italy, and left from \u2014 trying to think which \u2014 which port we\nleft from. I \u2014 I believe we left from Genoa.",
        "A: I must have, but I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: But I remember there \u2014 on the \u2014 being on the boat from \u2014 from Italy to \u2014 to\nPalestine. It was very warm, and in fact we have pictures of the family on the boat,\nNovember 18, 1997\nsitting there in our bathing suits, by the side of the pool on the boat. And I can\nremember that, and I can remember being, of course in Palestine, and going to\nschool in Palestine, and living there. My father had a nephew who was already in\nPalestine, and my mother had cousins who had gone to Palestine very early. They\nwere ardent Zionists, and they had gone there in the 20s, and in fact one of the\ncousins whom we met on some of our trips back to Palestine, my mother\u2019s cousin,\nfounded \u2014 was a founder of a kibbutz, Kibbutz Yavne, and he had a very large\nfamily, which we met when we were there. And my mother\u2019s brother went to\nPalestine just after we left Palestine to come to the United States. He went there\nwith his family. And his son is my only living cousin \u2014 first cousin. And we\u2019re still\nin touch with him, and we see him frequently. He\u2019s with the Israeli foreign service\nand we met him in Germany twice on trips over to Europe, and he\u2019s been to the\nStates frequently, because one of his daughters is married and her husband 1s\nstudying here in the United States.",
        "A: Haifa.",
        "A: Yes, and we lived in Haifa.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: I believe so. My parents rented an apartment, I think through my \u2014 my father\u2019s\nnephew, my cousin.

And my father tried to s \u2014 started a business with this nephew.",
        "A: Well, at that time you could take your money from Germany. In 1936, you\ncould still take your \u2014 your \u2014 your money out. So he had taken that along, and he\nhad \u2014 well, he \u2014 they chur \u2014 they went into the trucking business. They bought a\ntruck, they \u2014 they imported a truck from Germany. It was one of the assets my\nfather took with him. And I can remember going along with them on the truck. But\nthey \u2014 the \u2014 the work that that they did was they got a contract with a soft drink\ndistributor, and they would truck the soft drinks. Unfortunately this was the time of\nthe depression, and economic conditions were not very good in Palestine, in the \u2014\nin the \u2014 in that time period. And so the business was not very good. And my father\nwas \u2014 always said we could compute almost to the day when he\u2019d spend his last\npiasta in Palestine, because they just simply couldn\u2019t make a living. And I think\nthat was the principle reason then, that he left Palestine, was economic.",
        "A: Two and half years.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: To \u2014 to late \u00b038.",
        "A: Just a little over \u2014 just over two years.",
        "A: Yes, yes, Yes, I did.",
        "A: Yes, I can remember that, and I can remember that first I was a lot happy going\nto school because I couldn\u2019t understand the teacher, they were speaking Ivrit, I\ncouldn\u2019t speak any Ivrit. But apparently I must have learned it very quickly,\nchildren learn very quickly. And I was very happy going to school after that.",
        "A: They never really got to be very proficient in Ivrit. But then in Haifa there was a\nlarge German colony, and so you could get along pretty well with German.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: And of course my nephew \u2014 his nephew helped him along with that, he spoke\nIvrit quite fluently.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, we had a lot of friends, and my par \u2014 but as \u2014 as \u2014 and my\nparents, of cour \u2014 had friends. Most of them, of course, were immigrants like\nthemselves. And because conditions were so difficult that my parents also, to help\nmake a little money, rented out one of the bedrooms in the apartment to a young\nman who was from Austria. And he lived there with partial board. So that helped\nthem earn some money to help pay for the expenses, and that\u2019s how they managed\nto eke out some of the living, as well.",
        "A: Well, partly, you know, provide \u2014 providing for this boarder. And also again, to\nhelp make a living, they would \u2014 my father had been a prof \u2014 was a professional\nchef, they would have dinners that people could come to, about once a week, for\npay, or for money. And so that they took in paying guests, so to speak for \u2014 once a\nweek for a meal. And that helped them as well.",
        "A: Oh yes, I can remember some of them.",
        "A: Sometimes, and sometimes of course it was too late for me to stay up. And I\nremember that they put me to sleep out on the veranda, out on the porch, because\nNovember 18, 1997\nthe people were in the apartment. And I remember going to sleep outside. But I\nguess it was fun for a little boy.",
        "A: Well, just playing around \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and going to school.",
        "A: Well, what do children do, children get together and they play games.",
        "A: I\u2014 really \u2014 well, you know, hide and seek, and those kind of games that \u2014 some\nball. And then so I\u2019ve \u2014 when \u2014 when my parents told me that they were leaving\nPalestine, of course I was \u2014 at that time, then I was rather sad to leave, because of\nmy friends.",
        "A: Yes, I do remember that. I remember le \u2014 that departure. And I can remember\nthe trip to the United States because then I was quite old enough to \u2014 to \u2014 to\nremember that. [phone ringing]\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: The answering machine will take it. Yes, that trip was \u2014 I have more memories\nof that trip.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Although my \u2014 being with my parents, of course, made it, you\nknow, easier. And I can remember then, we went by boat to mars \u2014 from Haifa to\nMarseilles. And from Marseilles overland to Paris, where we stayed a couple of\ndays, waiting for the ship which was leaving from Le Havre.",
        "A: 1938.",
        "A: Late \u00b038.",
        "A: Winter \u00b038.",
        "A: We spent a couple of days in \u2014 in Paris. No, we didn\u2019t stay in marse \u2014 I can\u2019t\nremember staying in Marseilles. I think we just got on the train and went\nimmediately to Paris, where we stayed for a couple of days because the ship, which\nwas the Queen Mary, didn\u2019t leave Le Havre for several days after our arrival, and\nNovember 18, 1997\nthen we got on the ship. And that was quite an adventure for a little boy, such a big\nship.",
        "A: Oh, I had a wonderful time on the ship, although the \u2014 the passage was a little bit\ns \u2014it was a little bit stormy on that passage, but the \u2014 I didn\u2019t particularly get\nseasick, but my parents did have a little bit of seasickness. I can remember there\nwere a lot of activities for children. They had organized play. I can remember\nplaying on the ship with some of the other children. And it was by f\u2014 I can still\nremember that it was the first time I ever ate Brussels sprouts was on the Queen\nMary. I didn\u2019t know what Brussels sprouts were until I got on the Queen Mary.\nAnd then we arrived in New York. But I guess it was \u2014 trip was \u2014 th-the Queen\nMary was rather fast, it was like five and a half days to get to New York from Le\nHavre. And there we stayed, in New York for a couple of days, and then went by\ntrain to Cincinnati, which was where my uncle was living, and we moved to\nCincinnati, Ohio. And I can remember that very well, and I grew up in Cincinnati\nthrough high school. I was 18 years old when we left Cincinnati to go to New\nJersey.",
        "A: Actually about eight and a half.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Yes. Almost 10 years.",
        "A: No, I knew no English when I arrived, and of course I had to go to school. And\nbecause I spoke no English, they decided that I should \u2014 although I was eight and a\nhalf, to put me in the first grade. Now there was a little boy in the school who was a\n\u2014 who spoke German, and helped me understand what the teacher was saying.",
        "A: Yes, he was in first grade.",
        "A: Public school. Which is not that unusual in Cincinnati. Cincinnati had a long\nhistory of German immigration. There were a lot of people in Cincinnati who\nspoke German, even though they were not \u2014 you know, they may be second or even\nthird generation American. So this little boy spoke German and helped me, and of\ncourse once I learned English, then they moved me to the second and third grade\nvery quickly.",
        "A: Actually not, because he lived \u2014 he didn\u2019t live nearby, but I made other friends.\nAnd this little boy was much younger than I was, and once I moved out of the first\nNovember 18, 1997\ngrade, I sort of lost touch with him. But \u2014 and my parents, of course, had to start\nagain, and that was economically very difficult to make a living at that time in the\nUnited States because of the depression. And my parents had \u2014 took my parents\nawhile. My father, as I say, was a professional chef, but he couldn\u2019t get a job in that\nfield at the time, immediately. It was very interesting. So he tr \u2014 got various jobs\ndoing things, and one ti \u2014 one job that he managed to get was in a large cafeteria.\nAnd he says all he ever did was peel potatoes and on \u2014 cut up onions. He said, but\nwas one good thing about cutting up onions, because he always got a seat on the\ntrolley going back because he smelled so of onions, nobody wanted to sit next to\nhim. But one day, he tells the story, he met someone on the street, and \u2014 that he\nknew from Europe. A man that had been with him in Switzerland where they had\nlearned their trade together. This man was a chef in one of the large hotels in\nCincinnati, and when he met my father he asked him what he was doing, and how\nthings were. My father, of course, told him how difficult 1t was for him to get a job.\nHe said well, he said, meet me in the union hall next Wednesday. And he got him a\njob as a cook in one of the restaurants in downtown Cincinnati, where my father\nthen eventually became the chef. So that\u2019s how he did it, how it happened that he\ngot a job even during the depression, through a friend, or an acquaintance, that man\nNovember 18, 1997\nhe had studied with in Switzerland. So after that things got a little better,\neconomically.",
        "A: Well, actually, that probably happened in 1939.",
        "A: It was about a year, little less than a year after we arrived.",
        "A: Well, made friends very quickly.",
        "A: Well, the \u2014 the language problem went away very qui \u2014 very quickly. I \u2014 I don\u2019t\nremember that was a problem. And there were \u2014 in the area we lived in, there were\na lot of other immigrants as well as people who spoke German.",
        "A: But I spoke English very quickly.",
        "A: Yes, most of \u2014 most of them were, most of them were, because they were also \u2014",
        "A: Yes, most of them were Jewish. It was a predominantly Jewish area that we lived\nin in Cincinnati called Avondale. At that time it was very Jewish. I \u2014 going to walk\nNovember 18, 1997\n\u2014 I remember walking to high school I would pass three synagogues on the way to \u2014\nwalking to high school.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. They were then. It was interesting. The immigrants \u2014 the German\nJewish immigrants started a congregation of their own, so my parents felt that they\nwanted to support this, although they weren\u2019t Orthodox \u2014 it was an Orthodox\ncongregation \u2014 but they felt they wanted to support the congre \u2014 that congregation,\nand I \u2014 and so then they did get involved.",
        "A: And I can remember going \u2014 yes, we went to a synagogue. I used to go to\nsynagogue on Saturdays and because also my friends went. Even though my parents\ndidn\u2019t always go because it \u2014 because of \u2014 of \u2014 of work. Later my father left the\nrestaurant and started a bakery of his own, with a partner, someone he knew, an\nacquaintance. And so of course then they were working six days a week. So he\nwould not be \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t go to synagogue that frequently.",
        "A: No, sometimes I would go without my parents.",
        "A: Yes \u2014 no, with my friends, we\u2019d meet my fren \u2014 I'd meet my friends there.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: The synagogue didn\u2019t have any particular \u2014 that much in the way of children\u2019s\nactivities. We had other activities through, you know, thr-through the school, and I\nmade other friends in school, and so they \u2014 they weren\u2019t necessarily really\nconnected with the synagogue.",
        "A: Yes, yes, we did.",
        "A: Yes, I can remember that very well. Of course, it wasn\u2019t as elaborate an affair as\nBar Mitzvahs are today. First of all, it wasn\u2019t customary then, and beside my\nparents weren\u2019t going to spend that kind of money on a Bar Mitzvah. But I can\nremember friends and family ad \u2014 coming to the apartment, and my parents had a\nkiddush, and \u2014 and then a meal for the family afterwards in the apartment.",
        "A: Oh, I was very excited, because of course, I got a lot \u2014 a number of gifts. And it\nwas very exciting having all those people there and being the center of attention. I\nguess I can remember that very well.",
        "A: Okay. Maybe we\u2019ll have a little co \u2014\nNovember 18, 1997\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Okay, because of the difficult economic conditions when we first came, and\nparticularly before my father got a good job as a cook, my mother also went out to\nwork as a domestic on a day \u2014 day \u2014 daily basis. And I can remember going to some\nof the homes where she was working when I got out of school, so that I wouldn\u2019t be\nat home alone. And she did that for some years to help supplement my father\u2019s\nincome. As well as, again, renting out \u2014 we took a very large apartment in the same\nhouse where my uncle lived, and my parents rented out two of the bedrooms to help\npay for their expenses as well at that time. And those were rented out for quite a few\nyears until things got a little better and we no longer needed to do that. I can\nremember making friends with a \u2014 with the people who \u2014 who rented the rooms,\nand they stayed for quite awhile, so they must have been fairly happy living with\nmy parents. So that we had an elderly lady there I remember, a Mrs. Scholl(ph),\nwho was an American woman who I guess was re \u2014 living as \u2014 she was widowed.\nAnd she always told me her husband had been a drummer boy in the Civil War.\nAnd we had another woman, a Mrs. Stern, who was an immigrant. And she was a\nNovember 18, 1997\nrather \u2014 she was not \u2014 later on she got rather sickly, and unfortunately \u2014 and left\nbecause of illness. And we made friends with her family as well; she had a son. And\nactually my parents got to be very friendly with them \u2014 with those people as well.\nThey became more than just boarders, they be \u2014 sort of became friends. And of\ncourse later things got better, my parents didn\u2019t have to rent out rooms any more.\nBut of course as a child I never felt particularly deprived or poor because I was \u2014\nwe were, you know, at least comfortable, and I \u2014 I guess people around me didn\u2019t\nhave any more than we had, so \u2014",
        "A: Friends, right, friends at school and people that my parents knew that I came to\ncontact with. So I guess even at the beginning, although my parents had a very hard\ntime economically, didn\u2019t seem to make that much of a problem for me initially.",
        "A: Yes, of course, and as \u2014 as I \u2014 as I grew older, I can remember, well, when the\nwar started, 1939, and my parents [indecipherable] of course, at that time, and their\nconcerns with the people that they had left in Europe, their family. And I can \u2014 my\nmother was, of course \u2014 my mother was a somewhat of a di \u2014 rather depressed\npersonality, and that didn\u2019t get any better as she aged. But I can remember that they\nNovember 18, 1997\nhad a great deal of concerns about people they left behind, their parents and their\nfamilies.",
        "A: Well, not so much directly when you\u2019re a child, that sort of \u2014 you know, it\u2019s sort\nof there, but it \u2014 1t doesn\u2019t have that much impact on you. Although I ca \u2014 I could\nremember my grandparents and I \u2014 I remember their concern. So some of those\nconcerns did rub off on me, but as a child I \u2014 1t \u2014 you don\u2019t feel any responsibility\nfor it, so \u2014 but I can remember the war going on, and then of course, I can\nremember distinctly when \u2014 when Pearl Harbor occurred. That was on that\nSunday, because I had gone with my father on that Sunday to \u2014 to see a new\nrestaurant that they were \u2014 that the \u2014 that thas \u2014 those people were opening, people\nthat my father worked for, and he wanted to check out, see how it\u2019s com \u2014 was\ncoming along. And so that Sunday we took a trip to the new restaurant, which was\nout in the suburbs. And when we came back there was all this hubbub and people\ntalking and telling us that Pearl Harbor had been attacked. So I can remember that\nvery distinctly. Of course, during the war then, of course, I can remember \u2014 well,\nwe had rationing, so that was a problem of sorts, for everyone. And of course my \u2014\nyou know, not knowing how long the war would last, I guess my parents already\nbegan to have some concerns about this happening \u2014 their son perhaps drafted at\nNovember 18, 1997\nsome time into the war, although that didn\u2019t occur at that time, although later I was\ndrafted during the Korean War. But then it\u2019s \u2014 but I was going to high school, and I\nenjoyed going to high school very much [indecipherable]. In fact, I enjoyed going\nto school period in Cincinnati. It was a very good experience.",
        "A: I just enjoyed learning. I was a good student and I enjoyed it and I \u2014 the schools\nwere challenging and \u2014 and I just enjoyed it. The high school I went to \u2014 well,\nactually it was a combination junior high \u2014 high. It was a school \u2014 although a public\nschool, it was a school you had to enter by competitive exam. And, you know, three\nyears of Latin were still required. And so I can remember the te \u2014 the Latin teacher\ntelling us how fortunate we lu \u2014 we were that two years of Greek were no longer\nrequired. But it was a good school, and I enjoyed going there. Even though it was a\ngood walk to school, but \u2014",
        "A: Yes, I did, I did.",
        "A: And the friends.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: We enjoyed that. I went with my friends and although not all of my friends then\nwent to that particular high school, some of them went to one of the other high\nschools. I enjoyed \u2014 I enjoyed going to the school, and you know, being a teenager.\nI also helped my parents later in the bakery which they opened up, and I would\nwork there after school and on weekends, helping out.",
        "A: A little bit, but not too badly, not too badly. My parents were understanding and\nth-they didn\u2019t want me to work all the time. So I don\u2019t remember that that was a\nparticular problem.",
        "A: Well, bec \u2014 we were surrounded by a lot of people in the same boat. And so it\nwasn\u2019t a particular problem.",
        "A: No, no, I can\u2019t remember feeling any discrimination at all. It was \u2014 it was a very\n\u2014 basically a\u2014a pretty good time, except the problems that my parents had then\nlater with \u2014 when they learned when the war was over and they got indications of\nwhat had happened to their families. Of course I remember that, that was \u2014 those\nwere terrible times for my parents, and my mother \u2014\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Well, she cried a great deal about it. Of course, she cried very easily because she\n\u2014 she was a somewhat depressed person. But I\u2019m sure that there were \u2014 you know,\nthe \u2014 there were certainly very good reasons there to cry about that. And when she \u2014\nshe had always hoped that perhaps somebody would have survived the war, besides\nof \u2014 her brother, of course, had survived in Palestine. But that perhaps some of her\nnieces and nephews, these people \u2014 these children that I played with in Eilendorf\nhad survived. But sh \u2014 my \u2014 my \u2014 my oldest cousin Ilsa was a \u2014 a great favorite of\nmy mother, and she always had some hope that perhaps one of the children had\nsurvived. But that was not to be, and later we found out when we checked the\nrecords, particularly here at the Holocaust Museum, there were indications that all\nof them had been \u2014 you know, all of them had perished in the war. And of course,\nmy mother, not \u2014 and of course my father\u2019s family as well; he had the sister, and his\nmother and well, he had several sisters and their f \u2014 and all those people also\nperished. So that was a terrible, you know, feeling for my parents.",
        "A: Well, you know, children don\u2019t in-internalize that as much. And it \u2014 although I\nknew, you know, it was \u2014 it was bad, it \u2014 the impact on me was not as great because\nI had been so young when we left, and so my memories of these people were rather\nlimited. I mean, it was very, very st \u2014 you know, it \u2014 I mean, some of that\nNovember 18, 1997\nunhappiness obviously rubbed off on me and \u2014 but \u2014 and then by that time I was old\nenough to realize what that meant. But \u2014 but that \u2014 it was, of course, much more\ntraumatic for my parents. Very traumatic for them. And \u2014 and of course, my uncle\u2019s\nfamily, as well, my aunt\u2019s family. They also, of course, lost a lot of people in the\nHolocaust.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, that\u2019s right. So then, in the meantime, m-my father had started\nthis bakery with an aqua \u2014 with a f \u2014 with a \u2014 an acquaintance, but they didn\u2019t get\nalong too well, as partners frequently do. And my father decided then to get out of\nthe bakery. And he sold his interest to his partner, and he had had friends from\nCincinnati that had moved to Vineland, New Jersey, and started a poultry farm\nduring the war. And th-they were always in touch with the \u2014 with these people, they\nwere close friends. And they convinced them to come to Vineland, New Jersey and\nalso start a poultry farm, which turned out to be a big mistake because although\nduring the war those farms made a lot of business, after the war that business really\nfaded. They couldn\u2019t compete with the large farms in the Midwest and on the\neastern shore of Maryland. So unfortunately that was \u2014 turned out to be a big\nNovember 18, 1997\nmistake for \u2014 for my parents, although they made the best of it. Unfortunately my\nfather died very young, at 62, of cancer.",
        "A: And that was in 1957, shortly before I graduated from school. What happened\nwas, in 1951, I was \u2014 see, I \u2014 we left Cincinnati, that sort of \u2014 I guess that \u2014 there\nwas a certain upheaval there f\u2014 and \u2014 and th \u2014 I could \u2014",
        "A: Was 48.",
        "A: I just graduated from high school in 1948.",
        "A: Yes, probably.",
        "A: Yes, I think that was probably part of it. I graduated in \u201948, and then my parents\nmoved there. But tha-that was a bit of an upheaval for me. And as a result, if I'd\nstayed in Cincinnati, I\u2019m sure I would have just gone to the University of\nCincinnati right then and there. But because of that upheaval, I \u2014 moving to New\nJersey, I didn\u2019t go to college at that time, and I was a little confused about what I\nwanted to do, as teenagers frequently are. And what happened was, I got a job in\nNovember 18, 1997\nVineland, with the Vineland newspaper, the Vineland Times Journal as a sort of\na \u2014arunner, a boy, you know, in the office, and I would run errands and take out\nproofs of ads to advertisers to get their approval, and things like that. And did that\nfor a while, and then of course in 1951, I was drafted. It was the Korean War, and\nthat was a quite traumatic for my parents, that \u2014",
        "A: I did think about it, but I\u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 it \u2014 because of the move perhaps, and \u2014 and\nthen the other thing was, my parents found, as I said, the business, the \u2014 the \u2014 the\npoultry business got \u2014 eggs business got to be rather poor, and they had a great deal\nof difficulty making ends meet, so I went \u2014 decide well, I can just go out to work.\nThat was probably part of that.",
        "A: Well, at least support myself. So I did that, and then, as I say, I was drafted in\n1951, and \u2014",
        "A: Well, it sort of gave me a focus, cause now I had \u2014 had no choi \u2014 I knew what I\nwas doing. And although my parents of course, were very concerned. I mean, we\nNovember 18, 1997\nlost all these people in the war, and now their only son was going into the service.\nAnd what happened was, I was sent to Arkansas, Camp Chaffee for my \u2014 for my\nbasic training. And decided to sign up for OCS, Officers\u2019 Candidate School. Took\nthe test for OCS and was admitted to a class which was to start about six weeks\nafter my basic training was to be completed. So in the meantime, I was sent to what\nwas called leadership school, which was really for \u2014 a school for non-commissioned\nofficers. But since I had the six weeks, they had to do something with me, so they\nsent me there. And I was in \u2014I had an accident, training accident and \u2014 and very\nserious foot \u2014 fracture of my foot. What happened was the the trails of the 105\nHowitzers \u2014 this was an artillery base, and we were ar \u2014 taking artillery training.\nAnd [| had an accident with a 105 Howitzer, which almost cut off my foot. But\nfortunately it didn\u2019t, but 1t was a serious fracture, and I was sent to the hospital. And\nthat was in May of 1952, and was in the hospital through the following January. So\nby that time, I no longer had enough time to be sent to Korea. You had to have a ba\n\u2014at least a year of remaining service to be sent overseas. So I didn\u2019t have that time\nany more. And so I was kept at the hospital as a clerk. They had to assign me\nsomewhere. And spent the rest of my time as a clerk 1n the hospital and was\ndischarged in November of 1953.",
        "A: Well my parents, you know, once they realized that the accident was not that \u2014\nwell, it was serious, but it certainly wasn\u2019t fatal, and fortunately the surgery was\nvery successful on my foot. And although I was in the hospital a good deal of the\ntime, my parents, in effect, had the s \u2014 had \u2014 felt a sense of relief that I wasn\u2019t going\nto be sent to Korea. And in fact, I went home a good deal of time because of my\ninjury. After the surgery and a brief rehabilitation in the hospital, they sent me on a\n30 day leave to home, just waiting for this thing to heal. I came back, they changed\nthe cast and took out the pins from my foot, sent me on another 30 day leave. I was\nhome on three 30 day leaves and one 14 day leave before I got out of the hospital.\nSo I had to \u2014 and then, of course, I spent the rest of my time in Arkansas as a clerk\nin the hospital. Then when I got out of \u2014 out of the hospital, of course I had the ben\n\u2014 or \u2014 or out of the service, I got the benefits of the G.I. Bill. And as a disabled\nveteran, in quotes disabled, because of the injury \u2014 and I was somewhat\nhandicapped, at least initially, because of that I had pains in my foot and \u2014 but not\nthat serious. But they \u2014 but I did get the \u2014 a minimum disability as a result, from the\n\u2014 from the sw \u2014 when I was discharged from the service. As a disabled veteran, the\nbenefits of the G.I. Bill were quite considerable. They \u2014 what \u2014 what \u2014 it was called\nwas rehabilitation. In other words, they were going to rehabilitate you so that you\ncould do something. So I \u2014 they paid for four years at the University of\nNovember 18, 1997\nPennsylvania, all my tuition; I went to the Wharton School, and Uncle Sam paid\nfor everything. Cause my parents certainly couldn\u2019t have afforded to pay, not unless\nI had gotten a scholarship or something. I certainly couldn\u2019t have paid for that kind\nof tuition. So fortunate \u2014 I was very \u2014 in a way, this injury was very fortunate. So\nthen I \u2014 I had four years at the University of Pennsylvania, which I also enjoyed\nvery much. That was a great time. Cause I was getting paid to go to school. Not\nonly did they pay for all the tuition and books and fees, but I got a subsistence\nallowance for living, which I could do very well [indecipherable]. And in 1950 \u2014\nlate \u00b056, I met Jill.",
        "A: Yes. I was still in school when I met Jill. We were introduced by a mutual\nfriend. At first we \u2014 the first time he tried to get us together, of course, neither one\nof us could manage to get together. But he wouldn\u2019t give up, and a year and a half\nlater, he tried again, and this time we met. And well, eventually I decided to \u2014 we\ndecided to get married and we did get married just shortly before I graduated from\nschool. Unfortunately, my father at that time got sick, in the summer of 1957. And\nwe married in the \u2014 December of 1957, so my father was dead by the time we\nmarried, unfortunately. But he did know Jill, and he did know we were intending to\nget married. And I graduated in 1958. Now that was difficult for my mother,\nNovember 18, 1997\nbecause now she was widowed and she felt very un \u2014 well, she just felt kind of lost,\nand she \u2014 she felt she couldn\u2019t live alone, so we had some difficulty along those\nlines, and at first \u2014 which was, I think, a big mistake, anlis \u2014 at least initially on our\npart, of course, she lived with us briefly, after we moved to New York. I moved to\nNew York for \u2014 because I got a job there with one of the large \u2014 big eight\naccounting firms. Was called Touche, Niven, Bailey and Smart, now it\u2019s part of\nDeloitte Touche. So \u2014 but eventually my mother \u2014 we [indecipherable] to put her\ninto an apartment of her own, and we were nearby. In fact, it was in the same house\nwhere we lived, initially.",
        "A: No, she was able to support herself. She had, between Social Security and her \u2014\nwhat \u2014 what money she \u2014 she had, she was able to support herself so we didn\u2019t have\nto support her. And \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes. A great deal of emotional support. And I must say, my wife was \u2014 was\nvery good with that, although it was very difficult for us, Jill really handled it very\nwell.",
        "A: She did a great deal for my mother.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: My wife is also a survivor. Her family left Germany in 1939, very late, but was\nable to leave, and move to \u2014 go to Kenya, East Africa. That\u2019s a long story on \u2014 of\nits own, but they were very fortunate because the \u2014 her \u2014 her immediate family and\nuncles, aunts and cousins, quite a few of them \u2014 and in fact, even two grandparents,\nher father\u2019s parents, and her mother\u2019s mother, also left with them.",
        "A: I think so, I think so, although we didn\u2019t think of ourselves as survivors at that\ntime. That term wasn\u2019t really something that we applied to ourselves. I think so,\nbecause we had very common similar backgrounds. It\u2019s \u2014 as it turned out, Jill came\nfrom a place that was very close to where I was born, although my \u2014 our parents\ndidn\u2019t know each other in Germany.",
        "A: We did, we did. But now, her family was Orthodox, and over time I guess I sort\nof swung in that direction, as a result.",
        "A: After we were married, yes, after we were married.",
        "A: Yes, yes, I do. But we were able to \u2014 to handle my mother\u2019s problems, although\nthat wasn\u2019t easy at first, but gradually she adjusted more to that. But my \u2014 Jill gave\nher a lot of support and I gave her support, although I \u2014 I was working rather hard\nand Jill, after we had children, didn\u2019t work, so she had some time. And then living,\nat least initially in the same apartment house as we, my \u2014 so we were very \u2014 you\nknow, had \u2014 were able to \u2014 to give my mother a great deal of support.",
        "A: Our children \u2014 my son is 32, and my daughter is 30. They were adopted. My\nwife had several miscarriages, and we were never \u2014 we never had children of our\nown. So we decided after the third miscarriage, to adopt children, which we did.",
        "A: Well, that was a really very \u2014 it\u2019s emotionally a difficult experience, but we \u2014 we\ndecided that we wanted to do that. And we adopted them through the Louise Wise\nAgency in New York. And that was quite an experience in itself, going through that\nprocedure. But I must say they \u2014 they were supportive because they saw we were\nsincere and they felt that we would make good parents. And we adopted our son\nthen when he was \u2014 well, he was about three months old. And so then short \u2014 then\nthree years later we decided maybe we should try for another adoption, which was\nvery unusual. The agency did not give out a lot of second children. They had just\nNovember 18, 1997\nstarted a program \u2014 in fact, initially, when we adopted our son, they gave out no\nsecond children.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: And then they, somewhere during that time period, apparently, they started a\nprogram for giving out second children. They felt that perhaps it might be good for\nthe children, that they would have siblings, or go to a family, not be an only child.\nSo they started a program to place second children, and we were able to get into that\nprogram. And then we adopted my daughter about three years after my son. And\nshe again was about three months old when we adopted her.",
        "A: Yes. In New York at that time, the law was that you \u2014 they \u2014 the children could\nonly be placed in homes of the religion of their mother. So the agency could only\nplace Jewish children, and it could only place them in Jewish homes. Except that\nthere was one exce \u2014 an interesting exception. There was a program for Native\nAmericans adoption. You c \u2014 the law did not apply to Native Americans. And they\nalso had a program for placing Native American children. It was a rather small\nNovember 18, 1997\nprogram. We never got \u2014 did adopt a Native American child. But that was the only\nexception at that time.",
        "A: Not necessarily, because we \u2014 they could have become Jewish. So that \u2014 it just\nworked out that way because when we went \u2014 the agents \u2014 had we not been able to\nadopt through the agency, we probably would have tried some other means, but it\nall worked out very well. So \u2014 and \u2014 so then after we adopted my daughter \u2014 well,\nfirst of all, the agency required that you have a separate room for each of the\nchildren, that was one of the conditions. We only had a thr \u2014 two bedroom\napartment, and my son was already in the second bedroom. So we \u2014 we told the\nagency we would get a sec \u2014 a third \u2014 another bedroom for the \u2014 for \u2014 for my\ndaughter eventually, so we looked for a house. So on \u2014 on the condition that we\nwould, you know, provide a second bedroom for the \u2014 my daughter, they placed my\ndaughter with us on \u2014 she was still in the \u2014 we were still in the apartment. But what\nwe did was we made a room out of a dinette area, temporarily, for my daughter.\nAnd somewhere after that we \u2014 we did move into a house, and then we had a\nbedroom for each child. And meanwhile I was working, and I worked for five years\nfor a public accounting firm, Touche, and \u2014 whose name changed several times\nwhile I was working for them. But by th \u2014 when I left they were called Touche\nNovember 18, 1997\nRoss. And after about five years I went with a company called Mark Marietta(ph)\nin New York, at the headquarters. It was shortly after the company was formed, it\nwas a merger of two other companies, that\u2019s \u2014 is frequently the case. And I was\nwith them until I retired really, in 19 \u2014 at the age of 62, in 1992.",
        "A: Ah yes, how did we get to Washington, all right. In the meantime, was oh, in\nthe early 70s, my mother began to develop signs of dementia. So we \u2014 1n the \u2014 in\nthe meantime, she had moved out of her \u2014 the apartment in the house that we lived\nin, and taken an apartment in a \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in a building that was built for senior\ncitizen resident, as a senior citizen residence. She was very happy there. It was not\ntoo far from us. But while she was there she began to develop signs of dementia.\nAnd at the suggestion of her doctors and based on our own observations we decided\nthat she probably should go into a \u2014 some kind of a home. And after looking around\nvery long and hard, we found a place in upstate New York, in New Rochelle. There\nwas a very good Jewish philanthropic home there, which is still there. And we\ndecided of all the places we saw, this was the most approp \u2014 the best and most\nappropriate, and they accepted my mother. And this was in 1974, and two \u2014 oh,\nmaybe two weeks after they had accepted my mother, the company said oh, by the\nway, we\u2019re moving the headquarters to Bethesda, Maryland. Now we knew that\nNovember 18, 1997\nthey were considering moving, but it \u2014 but the actual knowledge that the move was\ngoing to take place occurred just as my mother had been accepted in this home. So\nwe said, well, can\u2019t put my mother there, we\u2019ll have to try to place her down here.\nWe decided to move down here, that was [indecipherable] company\n[indecipherable]. As it turned out, we couldn\u2019t place my mother in a home here.\nWe tried some alternatives for her, but it did not work out and we went back to the\nhome in New Rochelle and said, would they accept my mother? We couldn\u2019t place\nher in the Hebrew home here. They had \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t accept her, they didn\u2019t\nhave the facilities, she was an out-of-stater, so forth and so on. And they said well,\nif she\u2019s in no worse condition that she was when we accepted her, we\u2019ll take her.\nAnd of course, she was in worse condition. Except we were fortunate, the one day\nwe took her up there she had a very good day. I fl\u2014 we flew \u2014 I flew up with her,\nand she had a great day, and they said fine, she\u2019s no worse than she was then, and\nthey took her in. And although we felt very unhappy about placing my mother in\nNew Rochelle, when we were here with our family, there was \u2014 there seemed to be\nno alternative. We decided to do that and she lived there for about four years before\nshe died. And we went up there roughly almost once a month. One of us would go,\neither I would go or Jill would go, on a \u2014 usually on a Sunday to see my mother.\nAnd of course, her condition deteriorated, so after awhile she really didn\u2019t even\nNovember 18, 1997\nknow us any more, which 1s typical for that condition. But \u2014 so we took someone to\nhelp, we hired someone to help, you know, take \u2014 supplement the care that she was\ngetting in the home. And that worked out reasonably well in terms of her condition.\nAnd then, of course, eventually she died, after about four years in the home.",
        "A: Well, let\u2019s see, that was \u2014 we moved here in \u201974, it was about \u201970\n[indecipherable] \u201977. Meanwhile, of course, we were here with our children, and I\nwas continuing my work with the company. And Jill, when the children grew up\ndecided she wanted to do something again, and she went, started selling real estate.\nWe had \u2014 the children grew up, that was a mixed bag. They had very bad teenage\nyears, and my daughter was the most difficult child. She had a terrible teenage time.\nI won\u2019t go into all the details, but she ran away from home several times. We finally\nhad to \u2014 finally her condition got to be so bad, we hospitalized her briefly. And that\nhelped her a great deal. That really helped her. She was hospitalized almost a year.",
        "A: It was a very tough time for us. And meanwhile my son, although he was not as\nrebellious as my daughter, or as difficult as my daughter, was also having a rather\ndifficult teenage time. But my daughter somehow managed, as a result of the\nhospitalization, to pull herself together and her condition improved. And although it\nNovember 18, 1997\nwas far from perfect, nevertheless now she is married, and she has a s \u2014 husband,\nand she has two lovely children, and \u2014 and although she never made it to college,\nshe did graduate high school, and they\u2019re living in Florida. And my son did get\nthrough \u2014 finally did go through the University of penns \u2014 of Maryland. And he\u2019s\nturned out to be a very nice, responsible individual, and we\u2019re very close to both\nchildren. And my son lives in New York with his family, he also has two children.\nAnd we \u2014 in fact, his little boy was just born two weeks ago.",
        "A: A grandfather four times now. And so he has a little girl, as not \u2014 just under two,\nand a little boy. And my daughter also has a little girl and a little boy we\u2019re very\nclose to. And they\u2019re lovely children. So we enjoy being grandparents.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nNovember 18, 1997\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Yes. I retired in 1992, and at that time Jill was still selling real estate, but we\ndecided to look for something to do. And we had heard about the training program\nfor the Holocaust Museum. So we applied, thinking that with our background, it\nwas something we would be very interested in. And as that turned out to be the\ncase. We went and \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes, we did, because of all the people that both of us had lost in the Holocaust.\nAnd over the years, you know, you \u2014 you \u2014 as you get older, then you \u2014 you\u2019re\ninterested in what happened in the past. And so we had \u2014 we had to s \u2014 oh, we\u2019d\nbecome more informed about what had happened to our families that \u2014 during the\nwar. And so we felt that this was something we really wanted to do because of our\nNovember 18, 1997\nexperiences in the \u2014 and what had happened to our families. We felt that the\nmuseum was a good memorial, and \u2014 and a \u2014 and \u2014 and a \u2014 very important as a\nplace of learning, and we still feel that way. And people can \u2014 should learn about\nthe Holocaust. So when we \u2014 after our interviews, and when we started the training\nprogram, we felt we, you know, we really had done the right thing and we would \u2014\nwe would \u2014 we would want to do the kind of work that the museum could provide\nUS.",
        "A: Well, as we saw what the museum was, and how it was going about its mission\nas a\u2014a place of learning, and a place where people could come to see what had\noccurred, particularly people who might not otherwise have been able to have that\nexperience. We felt that that was a very fitting kind of activity for us, sort of a \u2014 sort\nof a memorial of our own for the people that we had lost in the Holocaust. And I\nthink we still feel that way about it. So we went \u2014 visitor services is \u2014 1s the work\nthat we ended up doing. And now Jill though, has left the \u2014 at least temporarily the\nvisitor services to work for the \u2014 work for Marty Goldman in his office. And I still\ncontinue with the visitor services.",

Almost all of those \u2014 almost all of those\nvolunteers are people who started with us when the museum opened, and have been\ncoming on Thursday afternoons since the museum opened.",

We go sometimes to \u2014\noccasionally some of the classes, although we haven\u2019t gone to too many of them,\nbecause they\u2019re in the evening and \u2014 and we\u2019re tired on Thursday afternoons and \u2014\nalthough occasionally we go in for something special, that we\u2019re particularly\ninterested in.",

        "A: Yes, yes, yes, we\u2019re friendly with them, sort of on a \u2014 on a volunteer basis. We\ndon\u2019t really get together with them otherwise, socially, but \u2014 but we all feel very\nclose to each other as volunteers.",
        "A: No, we \u2014 we \u2014 we seem to be a very homogeneous or at least a very \u2014 not\nnecessarily homogeneous group, but we seem to get along very well together, and\nwe haven\u2019t had any great co \u2014 any conflicts with each other.

        "A: I don\u2019t know if we see each other that wa \u2014 well, obviously we\u2019ve had some\ndifferent experiences, but because we were child survivors and also because we\nwere not really directly in the camps, we weren\u2019t in the \u2014 in the Holocaust in that\nsense, we don\u2019t quite have the same experiences that the people who went through\nthe camps had. Those survivors, I think we feel very different than they do. So we \u2014\nwe probably don\u2019t feel as different as these other volunteers, although we do feel\nsomewhat different because of \u2014 of our experiences and the things that we \u2014 we saw\nhappening to our families.\nNovember 18, 1997",

Initially, when we were f \u2014 the\nvolunteer program had the \u2014 had the volunteers spend time in the exhibition, in the\npermanent exhibition. And that was part of your daily tour, you would spend your\ntime on \u2014 on the floor. And we began to complain about that because we \u2014 it was\nemotionally too draining to see that exhibit all the time.",
        "A: The volunteers \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and the \u2014 yes \u2014 no, all the volunteers \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 began to feel that and we, maybe we felt it even more, because of our\nexperience, bu-but all of them began to feel that that was just too much pressure and\nit was emotionally too upsetting to be in the exhibit that frequently, and for such\nlong periods of time. As I put it, going through the exhibit, after awhile the pictures\nthat you saw, the images you saw began to be almost like \u2014 like family, they were \u2014\nthey became so familiar, 1t was almost like looking into a family album, and it was\njust emotionally too wrenching to s \u2014 to do that all the time. Now, once in awhile\nwe do go through the exhibit again, and we saw \u2014 us-usually when we do, we find\nNovember 18, 1997\nwe see something we didn\u2019t see before. But we can\u2019t handle it on a da\u2014 ona\nweekly basis.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh, some of the other volunteers also do.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes sometimes. Or sometimes we have friends who come in, and we\u2019ll go with\nthem, and sometimes we\u2019ll accompany them through the exhibit. But on-only\ninfrequently will we go through. But we do want to go through periodically.",
        "A: Well, of course, in most cases it\u2019s \u2014 th \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not ver \u2014 you do \u2014 you don\u2019t\nhave too much reaction, but it c \u2014 but periodically you find that there are people\nwho really have some kind of em-emotional experience they want to convey to\nNovember 18, 1997\nsomeone, and they \u2014 they do that, and they come up and they speak to the\nvolunteers.",
        "A: In the museum.",
        "A: Afterwards, they come and \u2014 and \u2014 and they want to speak to somebody about it.\nI guess they just feel they have to get it off their che \u2014 out \u2014 off their chest, or they\nwant to pass it along to someone in the museum, that \u2014 that \u2014 this experience that\nthey\u2019ve had. Just a few months ago I had a very interesting experience. A woman\ncame in who spoke \u2014 didn\u2019t speak too much English, she was German, a German\nteacher. And so she had come up to one of the other volunteers who knew that I\nspoke German, so she brought this woman over. So we spoke, and she said she was\na teacher and she was here on some conference and she wanted to see the Holocaust\nMuseum. And afterwards, she came up to me and she s \u2014 was very emotional about\nwhat she had seen. And she said now, she said, I\u2019m really happy that I\u2019ve seen this,\nbecause now no one in Germany can tell me that they didn\u2019t know what was going\non during the war. She said, and I have to pass this along to my grandchildren and\nmy children. She said, I want them to know, make sure that they know what\nhappened. So occasionally you get those kind of reactions. Or people who are just\nNovember 18, 1997\nvery emotional about what they\u2019ve seen for some reason. Either just because the\nwhole exhibit is that way, or they\u2019ve had some experience in their lives that attaches\nthem to the Holocaust in some way. Some family member, or they themselves; we\nfrequently get other survivors who come in the museum and come up to us and tell\nus a little bit about what they felt when they went through the exhibit.",
        "A: I think we feel an attachment now to \u2014 to the museum, and to the \u2014 and to \u2014 to\nthe people who come, because it seems to be an experience that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s important\nto them in many cases. And we\u2019re very kin \u2014 we\u2019re particularly also very interested\nin seeing all these children that come in, these children\u2019s groups, school groups.\nNow, some of them, of course, probably don\u2019t get much reaction. You know how\nchildren are sometimes, it\u2019s just another thing on their list. But many of them seem\nto be very interested and do get something positive out of that experience. And\nthat\u2019s always something very worthwhile, when you see that.",
        "A: Very tired. Not only fi \u2014 not \u2014 not so much physically all the time, but\nemotionally sometimes draining. But \u2014 but we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re \u2014 but I feel good about it,\nNovember 18, 1997\nand Jill does too, although she decided to stop the visitors\u2019 service work for a\ncouple of reasons; one, it was getting to be physically to \u2014 diff \u2014 hard on her. She\nfelt that it was too tiring, and she wanted to try something else for awhile. Not that\nshe was unhappy doing it, it was almost physical, more than anything else. You\nknow \u2014 even though, you know, a lot of people say well, you\u2019re always doing the\nsame thing, and there\u2019s no \u2014 but it isn\u2019t always the same thing. It isn\u2019t always the\nsame thing.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s very satisfying. Or you can answer questions for people. Lot of people\ncome who have no experience or understanding of what happened in the Holocaust\nand after they\u2019ve seen it, or even be \u2014 sometimes before they see it, they have\nquestions, and they want to ask someone, or \u2014 or they want to tell you something.\nAnd if you can help them deal with that, or answer their questions, that\u2019s very\nsatisfying, cause that place 1s a place where people should learn.",
        "A: Oh, I think that about covers it. I think that\u2019s the \u2014 the satisfaction we get out of\nit is \u2014 is \u2014 1s \u2014 1s dual. One 1s satisfying to us because of what we\u2019re doing, and it\u2019s\nNovember 18, 1997\nalso satisfying because we feel that that\u2019s something we\u2019ve done for the people that\nwere lost in the Holocaust.",
        "A: Well, we made trips to Israel, yes. And of course, we went to Yad Vashem and\nthat \u2014 lo-long before we had a museum here in Washington. Now that\u2019s a very\ndifferent kind of institution. We found that to be emotionally very difficult to\nhandle, Yad Vashem, as well. But I f\u2014I find that I n \u2014 in a way I find the museum\nhere easier to handle than I did Yad Vashem for some reason. I\u2019m not sure what it\nwas, but \u2014 or maybe it was just because the time has passed and I\u2019ve just adjusted\nbetter to handling my emotions in relation to that.",
        "A: Yes, yes, and that was many years \u2014 the first time we went was many \u2014 that was\nmany years ago. And \u2014 and on our other trips to Israel we never \u2014 we never went\nback to the \u2014 to the \u2014 to Yad Vashem, because we found it emotionally so\nupsetting.",
        "A: Maybe, maybe. I don\u2019t know.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Oh, well we \u2014 we liked visiting 1s \u2014 we went several times with the \u2014 when the\nchildren were young and we\u2019ve gone since. And of course my ve \u2014 my cousin is\nthere, my \u2014 my mother\u2019s nephew. And we\u2019re close to \u2014 because \u2014 in a way, because\nwe \u2014 we have so little family. He also has very little family. All those cousins that\nwe would have had, and other family members are all gone. And that\u2019s kind of a tie\nthat we have with him.",
        "A: Yes, it 1s.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes. Although, as I said to you before, we visited him si \u2014 he\u2019s with the foreign\nservice, the \u2014 the Israeli foreign service, so we\u2019ve seen him in Europe several\ntimes. And he\u2019s been in je \u2014 both times he\u2019s been stationed in Germany, because he\nspeaks German so well. And of course for him it\u2019s a different experience, as \u2014 well,\nyou know, to be there as a \u2014 as a \u2014 and in that capacity \u2014",
        "A: Well, the first time we went to Germany was in 1983. Was the first time we,\neither one of us, had been back to Germany. And we didn\u2019t know what our reaction\nNovember 18, 1997\nwould be when we went. And we both \u2014 we went to both where Jill had come from,\nand also to Aachen and Eilendorf where my mother\u2019s family had come from. And\nit was a little difficult to handle, but \u2014 but Jill wanted to go back as \u2014 and I wanted\nto go back, just to see where our \u2014 where we\u2019d come from and where our parents\nand family had been, and what that was like. And Jill had a lot of memories. Jill \u2014\nJill has a\u2014 many more memories, in a way, from her childhood than I do. And of\ncourse she had heard a lot from her parents and grandparents and aunts and uncles\nabout life in Germany, so she wanted to see where they had lived. And I went with\nmy cousin then to Eilendorf, and \u2014 and also Jill went along. And we went to the\nhome, on our own, the home where my \u2014 where his father and my mother had\ngrown up, where they \u2014 and where later my mother had lived, and my father. And\nwhen we got to the \u2014 it was a very interesting experience, we got to the door, we\nknocked and we introduced ourselves and told them who we were. And the woman\nwho answered the door as \u2014 was the \u2014 was the wife of the man who now was\nrunning that butcher shop. And her father-in-law was still alive, and he had been the\napprentice to my grandfather. And when we came in she gave us \u2014 it was almost as\nif she was running a tape, she almost had to get it off her chest as \u2014 this whole story\nthat she remembered of my grandfather.",
        "A: No, we hadn\u2019t heard that story before, and it was \u2014 that was a very emotionally\nlil \u2014 emotional experience because this was such a sad story and \u2014 and Jill and I and\nmy cousin, after we left we sort of said, you know and \u2014 although we understood\nwha \u2014 but why couldn\u2019t, you know, someone like that have perhaps taken him and\nhidden him? But you know, of course, that was very dangerous to do, and \u2014 and of\ncourse they had no obligation to do it. It was good enough of them, I guess, that\nthey helped him with food, and so forth. But \u2014 but for us it was so terribly sad to\nhear that. First, you know, from someone who had seen him, and \u2014 and so we went\naway. We were rather depressed when we left that \u2014 at that time. Although the\npeople were very nice people. And we had no \u2014 we really didn\u2019t have any bad\nfeelings about them. And my parents \u2014",
        "A: Yes \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that\u2019s right, exactly, we sort of had those feelings. Because my mother, my \u2014\nhad always spoken well of those people. I mean, you know, she had had very\npositive feelings toward them. And \u2014 sort of the people that she knew in her\nchildhood, and of course thought of \u2014 all of them obviously weren\u2019t Nazis,\nnecessarily. So we f\u2014 we \u2014 you know, we didn\u2019t have any bad feelings about it. But\nNovember 18, 1997\nthat was a terrible feeling to go away, and having heard that story from someone\nwho had actually experienced it, and knowing what fate had befallen my\ngrandfather. Then we went back again, this time in 1997 at the invitation of the city\nof Aachen. And they had arranged \u2014 they had a pr \u2014 they have a pr \u2014 they have the\nprog \u2014 a program to bring back sa \u2014 people who has \u2014 had been in Aachen and had\nbeen forced to flee, because of the Nazis.",
        "A: No, were Jew \u2014 no, Jews. I don\u2019t think there was anyone who wasn\u2019t Jewish that\nhad been brought back. And since they had missed us on the first program that they\nhad \u2014 they had a large group about three, four years earlier, this was a very \u2014 ina\nway it was very good that maybe they\u2019d missed us because now there were only\ntwo of us there, and so it was a very personalized kind of thing, very personal. And\nthey had arranged for us to meet this group. I call them the \u2014 call them the historical\nsociety, but their actual name would \u2014 closer is the Heimatverein, which sort of a \u2014\na home \u2014 a hometown club. But basically they\u2019re a historical society, that\u2019s what\nthey\u2019re interested in, they\u2019re interested in the history of \u2014 of this part of Aachen,\nEilendorf, that they \u2014 their family \u2014 where they live, and where their families have\nlived for generations as well. And when we came they wanted us to \u2014 to meet with\nthem, and to tell us what they knew about the Jews that had lived in Eilendorf, and\nNovember 18, 1997\nalso to see what \u2014 what our experiences had been after we left. So they \u2014 so we not\nonly got the usual tours, but we actually met with people, including my former ne \u2014\nnanny, and some other people who had lived there for \u2014 during the time when my\nparents were still there, although most of the people were much too young to have\nbeen anything but children, or even some of them were, of course, obviously not\neven born til after the war. But they were very interested in what had happened to\nthese \u2014 their former \u2014 the former residents, the Jewish residents of this little town of\nEilendorf, which was now incorporated into Aachen, cause the \u2014 so they had done\nall this genealogical research on my mother\u2019s family. And one other interesting\naspect, by the way of that, I just mention in passing; my mother had always said that\nshe was related to Annie Frank\u2019s family, and we never quite knew how. So we had\nmentioned this to them. And the facts \u2014 my mother told the story that when Annie\nFrank\u2019s grandmother, maternal grandmother and \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, yes \u2014 of \u2014 paternal\ngrandmother, was very ill. She was one of the people [indecipherable] sort of a\ndistant member of the family, that came when \u2014 during her illness, and she spent\nsome time with her. But we never quite knew what the relationship was, so we\nmentioned it to them and subsequently they deg \u2014 dug into the genealogy and they\nfound out what the connection was, that Annie Frank and I had the same great-\ngreat-grandparents on her father\u2019s side, which was, you know, her mother\u2019s \u2014 well,\nNovember 18, 1997\nher mother\u2019s side. I\u2019m sorry, not her father\u2019s side, her mother\u2019s side. So we had the\nsame great-great-grandparents, that\u2019s where the relationship came in. Which was\nvery interesting to hear. And my mother always said that I had played with her and\nher sister at some time, but I don\u2019t have any memories of that.",
        "A: That was a very \u2014 first of all, it was a big surprise, because I didn\u2019t even know\nshe was still alive. Of course I \u2014 I didn\u2019t know at that time what her age was,\nbecause, you know, when you\u2019re six years old everybody \u2014 I thought she was much\nolder than she obviously was. But it was \u2014 it \u2014 it was a sort of bittersweet thing.\nObviously, it was wonderful seeing her again, and hearing her stories. On the other\nhand, some of the things sh-she told us, were very unhappy things, about, you\nknow, what my \u2014 what had began \u2014 sort of experiences my parents had [phone\nringing] after the Nazis came in and \u2014 and the time we were leaving, and what she\nknew about the family, what had happened to my cousins and so forth. So that was\nan unhappy part, but on the other hand, we were very happy to hear from someone\nwho had known the family and had remembered \u2014 of course, we also went to the\ncemetery where my great-great grandparents, great grandparents, my grandmother\nall are buried. And my \u2014 and my mother\u2019s twin sister, who died of a \u2014 of the\ninfluenza epidemics after the first World War. All these people are buried there, at\nNovember 18, 1997\nthis little cemetery in Eilendorf, and it\u2019s still there, those stones are still standing.\nSo that was a bit of a \u2014 a \u2014 that sort of gives you an \u2014 at a time now, you know,\nyou ve heard these stories, but to actually see it, actually see where these people are\nburied, and to see that, give you a sort of a more immediate \u2014 more immediacy to \u2014\nto all the things that you heard. It gives it a mo \u2014 a newer reality, so to speak. It was\ninteresting, we also \u2014 we also spoke there to one of the school groups there, they\nhad asked us to do \u2014 whether we would do that, speak to a group of children. That\noccurred both in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in Cologne when my wife went back there last year,\nand this year when we were in Aachen. Both times the \u2014 the people there asked us\nto speak to some school groups. So we did, we spoke to a group in the school called\nthe Pius gymnasium, named after Pope pa \u2014 one of the popes, Pope Pius, one of the\nPius\u2019s, I guess. And \u2014",
        "A: It \u2014 yes, but it\u2019s a public school in Germany.",
        "A: Well, it means that it is \u2014 in Germany they \u2014 these schools are also supported by\nthe state. In other words, they\u2019re not private schools in the sense that we have here.\nAnd \u2014\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Partly, yes.",
        "A: Yes, but it\u2019s a\u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes, it\u2019s a Catholic \u2014 well, yes, the people there are \u2014 they \u2014 they te \u2014 yes,\nthey \u2014 they have religious classes as well, as well as the usual school classes. So it\u2019s\n\u2014 but we spoke to a group of children, two classes wa \u2014 and \u2014 the ages of 12 to 13.\nAnd they had done a project on Jewish life in that area before the war. So they were\nsomewhat familiar about the history of the Jews in that area, and they had studied\nabout the \u2014 they had sort of a course on comparative religion, so they\u2019d study\nsomething about the Jewish religion as well. So they were interested to hear from us\nabout our experiences. And we did it on a sort of a question and answer basis, rather\nthan just sort of lecture to the students. We s \u2014 we did it on the basis of answering\ntheir questions, which wy \u2014 th-the \u2014 the children got very much involved, we were\nreally surprised at how involved the children got in this question and answer period.\nThey really seemed to show considerable interest in what happened, and \u2014 but wa \u2014\nwhat it meant to be Jewish and what \u2014 a little bit about the Jewish religion, and what\nhad happened to the Jews in Germany during the period of \u2014 of the Nazi regime.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Yeah, there was one reaction from the second class. They got very much\ninvolved in \u2014 particularly the \u2014 well \u2014 well \u2014 well, the girls particularly, for some\nreason, I think they\u2019re more outgoing and are willing to \u2014 at that age I think they are\na little more mature than the boys. And after the class was over, they stayed, and\nthey wanted to know about, you know, where we lived and \u2014 and what it was like to\nbe Jewish in the United States, and th \u2014 so they \u2014 I mean, they carried on even after\n\u2014 after the period was over. So they were \u2014 they \u2014 they had \u2014 they showed quite a\nbit of interest.",
        "A: Not directly. I mean, they didn\u2019t evaluate it. It\u2019s just that their response was so\npositive, that we really felt very good about it.",
        "A: Yeah, strong interest, and the kind of reaction they had, and what they said. And\nwe promised to send them \u2014 the teacher asked us 1n \u2014 also to send us \u2014 her some\ninformation, books and so forth, about the Holocaust, since we were working at the\nmuseum. And we said we would, and we did.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: In \u2014 well, unfortunately they\u2019re all in English. And we sent them, and we just got\nback \u2014 course, that t-took us a little bit of time after we got home to get it all\ntogether. And then when you send a package like that, it takes awhile to get over\nthere. And we just got this weekend, we just got a letter from a man who was the\nhead of this Heimatverein, this organization, that we\u2019ve gotten somewhat close\nwith him, he\u2019s a younger man. He\u2019s an engineer, he speaks English very well,\ncomes to this country frequently on business. And we\u2019ve been running this through\nhim. In fact, the school that we went to was the school his children go to. So we\nsent the books to him to pass along to the teacher, and he just \u2014 they just got that the\nother week, and he sent us back a long letter saying how much they appreciated it,\nand that the teacher was beginning to get into these books, but could we send them\nsomething in German, because they found it more difficult to handle it in English.\nNow the children have \u2014 do study English, and these children had one year of\nEnglish already when we spoke to them. But obviously that \u2014 they \u2014 it\u2019s easier for\nthem to handle the German. But I don\u2019t know whether we can get some of these\nthings in German, or \u2014 but they \u2014 they were very appreciative of getting this\ninformation.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Well, we were very happy to pass along to them some firsthand experience. In\nother words, we were \u2014 as they say, and there\u2019s a German phrase for it, which really\nsays you\u2019re a witness of the event. We were witnesses of the events that occurred. I\nmean, they\u2019re young children, to them this history is almost like reading history\nabout Ancient Rome in a way. But \u2014 but here were people who actually had the exp\n\u2014 lived in that time f\u2014 period, and had experienced some of these things, and they\nfound it very interesting, and they seemed to take to it very readily, and they were\nvery interested in our experiences. They wanted to hear what had hap \u2014 what we\nhad \u2014 you know, what had happened to us, and why it happened to us. Of course,\nwe couldn\u2019t really tell them why in \u2014 in one sense, but on the other hand, it made\nwhat they had learned in class that much more immediate and real for them, as well.\nAnd we felt very good about being able to pass this along to this chi \u2014 generation,\nbecause those are the people we have to \u2014 hope to \u2014 to get to understand what\noccurred.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Yes, you were asking about our \u2014 what our feelings were about going to\nGermany, and they are very much a mixed \u2014 a mixed emotional bag. On one side,\nof course, it\u2019s very sad and not happy to go to a place where those thing that we\nknow happened, and some of them which we experienced ourselves happened, that\n\u2014 so that\u2019s the sad side of it. On the other hand, it was good to see where our\nfamilies lived, and also to meet people who showed some sincere interest and\nunderstanding of what occurred, and really wanted to know what happened, and\nwhat our feelings were. Now obviously the people we met in these circumstances,\nare people who have \u2014 well we \u2014 shall we say a positive attitude toward what\noccurred in the Holocaust. I mean \u2014 so in the \u2014 in the sense that they know what\nhappened, and feel that they want to try to make good in some sense, to the limited\nextent that they can, the terrible \u2014 make goods \u2014 you know, the \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 from the\nterrible things that occurred. So it\u2019s very good to meet those kind of people now.\nObviously we know that there\u2019s still anti-Semitism in Germany, and that there are\nstill people running around in Germany who were perhaps directly involved in\nsome of the atrocities that occurred in the Holocaust. So, you know, and so that\ngives you kind of a terrible feeling when you\u2019re just walking down the street and\nyou see someone of an age that you know went through the period as an adult;\nperiod of the Holocaust, period from \u201933 through \u00b045; and you wonder, you know,\nNovember 18, 1997\nyou have this \u2014 this \u2014 this nagging feeling about, you know, who are these people?\nYou know, were they perpetrator, were they di \u2014 were they directly involved? And\nthat\u2019s a very, very difficult emotion to deal with. But on the other hand, I guess it\u2019s\n\u2014 ina way it\u2019s a good thing to face up to that, and to know that both of these sides\nof Germany still exist, and the hope we have 1s for this younger gener \u2014 these\nyounger generation to really understand and that \u2014 what happened, and therefor try\nto make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.",
        "A: Well, I think it pr \u2014 the fact that it happened, and happened to our families,\nhappened to us, that pe \u2014 you know, that here are people who have lived in a\ncountry for hundreds of years, as my family and Jill\u2019s family had done, and really\nfelt German, no question about it. I mean, my father was a soldier in the first World\nWar. And the Jews of Germany were as patriotic Germans as the Jews of America\nare patriotic Americans. I mean, they felt German. And to think that what happened\ncould happen, and did happen, is in a way very disturbing to us individually,\nbecause [phone ringing] somehow you have that nagging feeling that maybe it\ncould happen again, and maybe even could happen here. I mean, I think survivors\nhad more of that feeling than people who did not go through that.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: I think so. I think, based on my \u2014 our experiences with people who were not\nsurvivors of the Holocaust, who were not in Europe, who were Americans, and\nhave lived here, didn\u2019t have that experience directly, I think we feel differently than\nthey do. And I get th \u2014 I get the same reaction from other friends of ours who are\nalso survivors, that they have those feelings and those emotions. I just \u2014 you ju \u2014\nthey \u2014 I mean, I guess you can never quite feel as certain about what\u2019s going to\nhappen, and that it\u2019ll be that \u2014 or that something like that occurred in the Holocaust\ncan\u2019t happen again, or can\u2019t happen to Jews again, or can\u2019t happen in this country\nagain, as people who didn\u2019t have that experience. I think that also makes the state of\nIsrael for us, much more important in that sense. That that is something that was\nnot there when the Holocaust occurred, and had it been there, probably things\nwould have been somewhat different, because at least Jews would have had a place\nto go.",
        "A: Oh, I think \u2014 I don\u2019t know. But I thi \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether it has some of that\ndirect effect \u2014 maybe I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m [indecipherable] our politics might be otherwise,\nbut it definitely, I think, has an effect on how we interpret the events, and what\nNovember 18, 1997\npeople say and do. And when something occurs, maybe we feel \u2014 you know, if we\nsee something \u2014 maybe we are more apt to interpret something as being anti-Jewish\nor anti-Semitic than others, because we said, hey, wait a minute, 1s that really \u2014 you\nknow? And it may not be, but I think you have that reaction more quickly than\npeople who have not gone through something like that.",
        "A: Well, let me try to think. All right, when we had this \u2014 oh, what was this fellow\ndown in Louisiana? Can\u2019t think. He ran for the U.S. Senate from Louisiana \u2014",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, much later, recently. A few years ago. No, not Huey Long,\nmuch earlier \u2014 much later than that. I can\u2019t think of his name. He was a really \u2014I\nmean, he really was someone who not so much \u2014 not necessarily anti-Semitic direct,\nbut he was just sort of anti a lot of things, and he had \u2014 obviously was a person with\na great deal of \u2014 of \u2014 of prejudices, in terms of minorities and other people who\nwere not, you know, quite Anglo-Saxon Americans. And when you \u2014 you know, so\nI think our reaction to that was much more fearful in a way, than other Americans\nwho said, oh well, you know, he\u2019s out on a far limb, he\u2019s far \u2014 you know, he\u2019s way\nout of the political s \u2014 on the side of some extreme side of the political spectrum,\nbecause we said, well, people like that who were on the far side of the political\nNovember 18, 1997\nspectrum in Germany, finally got into power, and we said, you know \u2014 so we\u2019re\nmuch more \u2014 I think perhaps we\u2019re much more concerned about those things than\npeople who don\u2019t have those experiences. And when we see it in other parts of the\nworld also, we\u2019re \u2014 we S \u2014 we \u2014 we perhaps in si \u2014 always more fearful that people\nwho have such negative views, in terms of other minority groups, whether it\u2019s here\nor in Europe, or in Asia, can get into a position where they can create the kind of\nregime that did the sort of thing that happened in Germany. I do think that that\u2019s\nsomething that impacts survivors more than others.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, as \u2014 me as well, yes. But overall, I think we\u2019re, you know, basically,\nbecause of our age when we left Germany, I think we\u2019re prow \u2014 we are, on the\nother hand, not as much affected as people who even went \u2014 or, you know, who \u2014\nwho went through the camps, who went through the actual events of the \u2014 that\noccurred in Europe in the Holocaust, I don\u2019t think we are \u2014 we don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t think\nwe have quite their emotions, cause they must have a whole other set of emotions,\nand concerns and reactions. But I do think we are also \u2014 but we \u2014 I think we\u2019re\nsomehow different emotionally than people who haven\u2019t had any \u2014 the experience\neven we\u2019ve had.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Yes, and I think it had it \u2014 and the other thing 1s, I think it had a \u2014 a terrible\nimpact on our families, our parents. I th \u2014 don\u2019t kn \u2014 you know, there\u2019ve been \u2014\nthere\u2019s been a lot written about people who were in Europe and \u2014 and survived the\nHolocaust in Europe, or \u2014 and what happened to them, people who were in the\ncamps, or hidden, or so forth. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been much written about people\nwho got out of Europe, but had the experiences that our parents had, and what \u2014\nwhat that meant for them, because here were people who were just, you know,\nripped out of their environment, and ripped out of everything that they were used to,\nand were thrown into another world, other countries, and had to adjust, you know,\nto \u2014 try to establish a whole new life for themselves. Now, obviously their\nexperiences were not as horrible as the people who were involved in the camps, but\nthey certainly, I know, are \u2014 both of our families suffered a great deal as a result of\nthat as well. It\u2019s a different kind of suffering and it\u2019s a different kind of experience.",
        "A: But it\u2019s there, nevertheless, yeah. So, I\u2014 I know our children and our nieces and\nnephews and all the people of the next generation, they have again different\nexperience and different feeling because they\u2019re again another step removed from\nthe events in Europe. But I think even those people are somewhat impacted by our\nexperiences, because they\u2019ve heard it.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Yeah. Now, their children, again, now they\u2019re gonna be another \u2014 further\nremoved from it, and now it really becomes ancient history, in a way. And that\u2019s\nwhy I think the museum is very important, because it brings that history to these\npeople, to these young people, and to the people who had no experience with the\nHolocaust, and says oh hey, wait a minute, here it is, and it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s more immediate\nthan just reading about it, or hearing about it, sort of on the background noise, and\nhopefully it brings it up as a more \u2014 as a \u2014 as a more real experience, that it really\ndid happen, and it happened fairly recently, and it happened to people that are still\nalive today. That was an interesting experience once I had in the museum when I\nwas at the elevators. A young group came \u2014 some young people came through, oh,\nyoung teenagers, maybe again, 12, 13. And one of the boys came up to me while we\nwere waiting \u2014 while they were waiting for the elevator, and he says, is th \u2014 is there\nanybody still alive who \u2014 who experienced this? So to him this was already, you\nknow, really, you know, ancient history. So what I told him I had \u2014 had an exper \u2014\nyou know, that I had lived through that, I guess it was sort of like, you know,\nmeeting Julius Caesar or something, I don\u2019t know. But \u2014 so that \u2014 our whole\nexperience wa \u2014 you know. Now, we don\u2019t want to make the Holocaust, you know,\nsort of a religion of life now because I think that\u2019s a ne \u2014 that\u2019s very negative. But I\nNovember 18, 1997\nthink we have to remember what happened, and \u2014 and live our life knowing those\nevents occurred, and what those mean.",
        "A: No, I think that\u2019s \u2014 I think that\u2019s about it.",
        "A: I se \u2014 I appreciate being able to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 you know, pass this along.",
