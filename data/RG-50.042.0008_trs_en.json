        "LEO BRETHOLZ\nJanuary 29, 1992\nOnce we start they're going to look at you for a while and adjust the light.\nCamera beep\nShould I just lean back?\nYeah, you do whatever you want, but you can look at me. Can you briefly and simply tell me what\nthe underground was like in France?\nThe French Underground movement was made up of two major organizations. One was what was\ncalled the FFI-- that was the abbreviation for Forces Francaises de |'Interieur--the French Forces of\nthe Interior, and the other one was FTPF--Front Tireur Partisans Francaises (ph)--Snipers and\nPartisans--uh, what you might call uh, uh what do you call these organizations that fight uh\ngovernments and the establishment (pause) um Front Tireur, uh what do you call them in the\nMiddle East they're called the...\nThe Guerillas.\nThe Guerillas, right. That was the second group. The difference between these groups was very\nfundamental. FFI was under the direction of the exiled French government in London. Charles de\nGaulle was the man who gave the instructions and gave the direct. The others were Front Tireur\nPartisan Guerillas, and they worked on their own, they had their own command and did not\nlisten...to what the directives that came from London because they have a special interest. They\nhave an interest to maintain for instance the French infrastructure. Because once they were coming\nback as victors, they wouldn't want to have to rebuild so much. Or they had an interest to protect\nmainly in properties. Let's say there was an English-owned British-owned property somewhere in\nthe center of France, and in that uh factory--in that factory was now producing war materials for the\nGermans. Now, the FTPF would go after those places and bomb them or destroy them. The\nFrench Forces would be interested in not having these factories produce those tanks or those\nweapons, but they would like to maintain the property as an entity, so how to do one and not do the\nother without destroying, so there were these dichotomies. But, FTPF didn't listen to it and did\ntheir own. The French Forces of the Interior had a command, and that, as I said, came out of\nLondon, and they had their military or para-military commanders here and there. The FTPF chose",
        "their leaders from within their ranks, who were rag-tag people. Now what did the FTPF include?\nPause. This was 1941, 42. That was just 6 years after the end of the Spanish Civil War. So they\nhad people who had come from Spain and refugees, and were glad to take up arms against the\nGerman Fascists again. They were deserters, to be sure, from the German army. Now the\nGermans had incorporated into their army some people from Russia, from the, from the Eastern\nOccupied Territories--the Georgians especially, the Ukrainians. There were rabidly pro-German,\nin fact. So some of them after had been incorporated into the German army, and were then taken\nprisoners--escaped from the prison camps, maybe, and joined the FTPF. Or they were\ndisenchanted with the German army, and decided well, this is not for us, and deserted. And then\nthere were real German deserters. Then there were a lot of people from Alsaise Lorraine. Those\npeople who had been...quite a few pro-German, but many anti-Germans, who were the Lorraine\npeople, who were taken into German, into the German army refused to go along with them because\nat heart they were French, and that reason had changed hands so many times. They were deserters.\nAnd then, last but not least, there were the Jews. And the Jews had formed a group that was called\nArmee Juive (ph): the Jewish Army. That group was not so much into fighting as into more\nharassing. Road blocks, blowing up tracks, going into the little villages, and attack a Gendarmerie\nstation, and get some arms if they were available. But mainly to produce false identification cards,\nand administrative things that would help people hide out safely, escape safely, children to be\ntransported to Spain, to Portugal from Spain, perhaps to North Africa or to Switzerland. Now, the\ngroup that I finally wound up with in Limoges was one of those Armee Juive (ph). The group was\ncalled, the whole Armee Juive, was really called the Sixth. That was a nomenclature that we, that\nwas given, that we adopted, well, whoever was in charge decided that's what it will be called, the\nSixth. The Sixth didn't mean much, didn't mean anything, in fact. It was just drawn out of the air.\nBut to the French melise (ph), especially, that was the French collaboranai, colab...borationist\nubbh....paramilitary work that was under the Vichy, and they did the dirty work for the Gestapo, in\nfact. But, to them, the Sixth was something ominous, something to be watched--looked out for--\nwatched for, or be...afraid of perhaps. Why? Because in their mind, if we were called the Sixth,\nthere must have been a first, and a second, and a third, and a fourth, and a fifth. So, to them the\nSixth was something that was sixth in succession of a series, and to us, I mean, this was mainly\nwhat I, personally, was engaged in after my various escapes, and when I finally acquired that nom\nde guerre (ph), that French name, Henri LeFevre (ph), and our group did this, produced this for us,\nidentification cards. To be sure, the French Resistance, the Marquis, was formed in the Southeast\nof France in the French Alps, and in the area where I first was in the Rhone Valley, but that\nresistance part in Northern part, in the Northern part of France, above, North of the demarcation\nline did not really mean much until shortly after the landing in Normandy in 19--in June of 1944.\nThat's when they got more into action, and that's when the police in France joined up, up to that",
        "moment in the Northern part of France, the Marquis and the Resistance was not so much organized\nas mainly, mainly people individually started resisting in grouping uh because in in Northern part\nof France, the Germans had pretty much the run of things, if not, the collaboration of many people\nin Paris, including perhaps the police. There's an interesting book out by um David Jones. The\nbook is called Paris in the Third Reich. Not and the Third Reich, in which he propounds the idea\nthat had Germany won that war, Paris would have become the capital of his new Europe because\nthat was the main gem in the crown of his uh conquests. He always wanted, Hitler always wanted\nParis to be the showpiece, so he propounds the idea uh that uh, that the French may have even gone\nalong with the New Order. So in the Northern part of France there wasn't much resistance, to make\na long story short. Our, the, the, the Southern part was where the beginning was, and this was\nbasically what uh, the resistance did. There were many arrests, many people killed, many people\nexecuted summarily executed. Very good friend of mine, Eugene Bass was uh killed in Saint\nJenian (ph) in Southern France when he delivered a pack of ID cards and was arrested at the train\nstation by the Germans and two shots into the head. He is listed in that book uh Deportation des\nJuives as one summarily executed. Um...it was...hit and miss, it was run...what it amounted to be\none step ahead of your pursuers then you had it made. It was not something that we could say was\nso well-organized that if it had endured for much longer that we would have come out the winners,\nI don't think so. Uh Armies, the German armies were defeated, and that spelled the end of it, but as\nan outfit, in hindsight, 1t was an adventure, but I don't think, as the outfit was constituted, or the\nwhole movement was constituted, they could have fought the Germans on an even, on an even uh,\nplaying field. They had all the tanks, they had all the ammunition, but things turned out differently.\nHow did your group get away with it?\nBeep.\nAnd I want to go back to your specific resistance activities and your group, and I want you to tell a\nlittle bit about how you were able to get away with it.\n(Clears throat) After my various escapes, and one from the training in motion, the deportation\ntrain, and later a jail sentence, and I served 9 months. And again a forced labor camp, and again\nbeing taken to a train to a work detail, escaping again this time from a standing train. I was\ncontacted by the, my friend, a young fellow, who had escaped with me. We had communicated,\nand he knew where I was hiding after my last escape, and he sent me false identification papers.\nWhat he sent me, basically, was a birth certificate, which served later to establish an identity and\nidentification cards and ration cards and everything that was connected with legalizing your,",
        "legalizing as it were, my false identity. And I could live with that under the regime, and uh after\nthe war, if I would have wanted to, I could have continued that particular identity, in that identity.\nSo after my last escape and hiding out, I was sent these papers with a letter of recommendation to\njoin up with a group in the Rhone Valley, in a little town called Saint Valier (ph), South of Lion\n(ph), which at the time was hotbed of Gestapo activity under the aegis of Claus Barbie. I joined\nwith that group in November of 1943, not really knowing what that group was. To me it was a\nplace where I'm going to go to hide out with other young people who had run away with other not\njust young people, men who had run away, you know, with children or women, but when I got\nthere, I knew after a few hours what it was. Speaking to people who they were, where they came\nfrom, and I realized, I just been sent to a place where we will do uh illegal underground activities.\nWhat happened in that particular area, or in this particular camp was mainly instructions--how to\ncirculate with our papers without being detected. What to say if we were in a place like a\nrestaurant , and an inspection team came in uh, a patrol came in; how to act, act natural, and do\nnever speak your, let on that you speak uh the language other than what you are, Frenchman. Don't\nfall into traps. And they were teaching some of us young people certain uh trades there too, so that\nthe time should not go entirely. With the knowledge that within some time, we will be sent to\ncertain areas where they can use our services: underground activity. Little did we know at the time\nwhen I got there that in a few months later, we would be notified by the mayor of that village that\nthere will be a raid. Evidently that mayor knew what this camp was all about. But we were\nnotified that there will be a raid on the Centre de Preapprentisage, the Center for Preapprenticeship-\n-that's what it was called. A name that was innocuous--didn't mean much--they gave us the\nuniforms of the Compaignon de France, so that we were incorporated into that whole image of\nNew Europe. And a majority of the people in this camp were Jewish. My friend who had sent me\nto that camp with a letter had that from his brother, and his brother had, uh, what friend of his as he\nexplained to me, had already had a contact. That's what they did there. Little did we know that\nwhen that mayor notified us, that we will, this is the time when we would have to disband, and the\nwhole thing was disbanded, and um, 60 or 80 of us who were there, that was less than 100, were\nsent into various areas of Vichy, France. And I was sent into an area near Limoge, a little town\ncalled Chalou (ph), and in Chalou, I connected with uh Jewish underground, and we were there to\nproduce false identification cards--that was our main endeavor. A very good friend of mine who\nwas part of this group, a young lady by the name of Marianne Kohn, just a couple of weeks, 3 or 4\nweeks before the liberation, had been put in charge of a child's, children's convoy to Switzerland,\nand arriving near the border of Switzerland, near the town of Animus(ph), she and her truck driver\nin the truck, were stopped by a Nazi patrol that materialized at the last moment, and the kids were\nactually in plain view of the Swiss border. Soon freedom would be theirs, but that never came\nbecause they were arrested. They were beaten about, not the kids. The kids were then handled by",
        "the mayor of Animus (ph), who said he was going to put himself in charge of these kids. Marianne\nKohn was arrested. The truck driver was arrested. She was interrogated. She didn't divulge\nanything, and then the henchman from Lion came to interrogate her in her cell. The story wound\nup with her being killed with a spade to her skull, and uh, a week or a few weeks after the liberation\nher body was found in a shallow grave together with another prisoner, a lady who was with her in\nthe cell, and then a poem was found in her, in her pocket, of her jacket, of her bloodstained jacket,\nwhere she had written about the hobnail??? booth, and the, and the, uh, you have uh key chains in\nyour fists, and you are, but I'm not giving in and all that sort of thing, and I'm not going to speak,\nI'll talk tomorrow, but not today, but she never had a chance to talk or not to talk because she was,\nshe was um, no she said, she said tomorrow I will betray, not today, you can't get me to betray\ntoday. Tomorrow. I know what you're doing, but I know what I am going to do, and then she was\ngoing to slit her wrists with a file. But she never got to that, she was killed. Anyway, that was the\ntragic story of one of our people, and uh when you go on the war front and you uh you shoot it out\nwith the melise(ph) or the Germans, that's a quick thing. It's either them or us, and that's a sort of\naction out in the field. But there is more to the underground than the field and the confrontations.\nThere is that resistance of uh, sacrifice, and doing what you think is right, and this Marianne Kohn\nreally personified everything that was good in a person, that knew what she was doing. She was\nvery studious, she was very pert little person, loved children, and loved life, a poet, a musician.\nAnd that was also part of that that underground, that resistance, that had to be there because\ndocumentation was very important. In fact, that was on the 10th of June, 1944, that was the\ndestruction of the village of Oradour (ph). That I was on my way to Oradour (ph) with a pack of\ncards, identification cards, and my friend, Eugene Bass, took a batch of cards to go to Saint\nJenian(ph), a village beyond. Why did he do that? Because his mother was 1n that village hiding",
        "out. So he took that area because at the same time he could visit with his mother. So when he\narrived at the train station, they caught him with these cards and killed him. And when we were on\nthe train, on that commuter train between Limoge and Oradour, Circlan (ph), that's that village that\non the 10th of May was burned to the ground--and we had heard of it that put, women and children\nput into a church to be photographed. And then the church was burned to the ground with straw\nand hay on the outside and gasoline put over it. That was the tragedy of Oradour. And, when we\nwere on that train going to Oradour and we saw the German column proceed alongside on the\ncountry road next to the train, next to the railroad track, we knew that they're going somewhere for\nsome sort of action. So some of us decided we are not going to go to Oradour, we are not going to\ngo further. In fact, the next stop, we will get off. Because when the Germans go into that direction,\nwe don't want to go in that same direction. That was also part of the learning process. When you\nsee trouble that you cannot...don't want to be involved in, just find another way. Be one step ahead,\nthink ahead. So we got a station before, and we found out that whoever descended from the train in",
        "Oradour, from the train, was also arrested, was part of the, the killing, was killed right in Oradour.\nSo there was another time when I escaped just by sheer luck because I decided not to go to\nOradour. First things were escapes. This was not an escape, but just, uh, uh a preemptive sort of\nuh, uh decision that had to be made. The cards were never delivered, and the people to whom they\nwould have been delivered were no longer alive anyway. Pause To deliver some cards\nBeep\nwhen I, when I collapsed because I had a hernia, a strangulation hernia, and I had an incident in a\npark where a nurse walked by, and she said, \"You will have to be taken to a hospital.\" And I\nresisted that because they would recognize circumcision, and in in France, French people didn't get\ncircumcised. Mumble...non, non-Jews. And I wound up in a hospital, and it was an emergency\noperation. And when I woke up there was this nun, a Catholic hospital nun, her name was St. Joan\nof Arc, a beautiful black-eyed young nun, about maybe 19, 20, maybe 21 years old, and she when I\nwoke up, and I had a hot uh breaker (?) hot water bottle at my feet because I had that infection you\nknow, and I had a drain in my stomach then, groin. She said to me, \"You don't have to, have to\nworry. As long as I am in this ward,\" she says, \"You don't have to worry about anything.\" That's\nwhat she said to me. Later on I wrote to the hospital to get some documentation on that--I needed\nthat for Germany for, you know, compensation, that sort of thing. Uh, I asked in that letter that I\nwrote to the administration, \"Is Sister Joan of Arc by any chance still at your hospital?\" They said,\n\"No, she was transferred somewhere.\" They said, \"either Normandy or Brittany.\" I think it was\nNormandy. \"She's in another hospital, but if we have some communication with her, if we have a\nchance to speak to her, we'll tell her that you asked about her, and it's nice that you did ask about\nher.\" So that was a, there was a rabbi in, in uh, I think 1t was the Grand Rabbi of Strasbourg,\nAbraham Deutsch, and he was the fellow through whose offices we always had our\ncommunication, but he was a rabbi in Limoges, but he had all this uh information and uh letters and\nuh instructions came through his office really, you know, and when I was in that hospital, I still\nmade sure that I was in touch with Rabbi Deutsch, that he knew what was happening to me,\nbecause I had gone to deliver some cards, and dropped right in the, well to get some information\nfrom kids in uh, in an orphanage to see what they needed to be done, and I all of the sudden had\ndisappeared off the street, so I had to send message to Rabbi Deutsch later after a couple days, after\nI had uh, you know, sort of gotten out of uh anesthesia. So these were all little, little uh incidents\nthat uh that um, were part of that whole uh mosaic of uh, of, of uh events you know.\nAll right, now let's not do the train now. Let's go back, and why don't you tell me how your distant\ncousin saved you when you were hiding. Just tell me that little story, and how she saved you when",
        "you were hiding in the attic.",
        "Oh, Annie, yeah, she's now a lady of 69 living in Belgium. What happened was that before we\nwere, before I had my escape, I lived in this town, Coterrey(ph), you know all these, all the\ninformation there. Uh lived in this town Coterrey near the, not I lived there, we were sent there as\nJews to go into what was called forced residence, residence assignee, assigned residence. Again,\nthere was a mayor responsible for letting us know there will be a raid, so some of us took to the\nmountains. Pause. About a handful of us took to the mountains to hide out. Annie, who was with\nher parents there, was a Belgian citizen, and Belgians, and Luxembourgers and Dutch people, at\nfirst, were never as much affected by that as people who had come from Austria, Germany, Poland,\nEast, or apatri (ph) meaning stateless people. And then she was a girl, and women were not\nimmediately, some of them were, under some sort of dispensation there. But, men and young men,\nof course, were taken. When we came back from the mountain, and knew that there was no longer\nable to live in this town of Coterrey, which was near the Spanish border, about 2-3 miles away\nfrom the Spanish border, an enclave from which it was very hard to get away, and to get to, but\nthat's what they wanted, they wanted us sort of captive. I decided within a day or two we will have\nto get away from here. I will have to get away because I could no longer be there out of the 1500\nor so people, who had been there to find the Jews. There was just about a, maybe a couple hundred\nleft. And I went up to the attic in the place where we lived. My family and distant cousin, they\nsaid, \"You will stay up in the attic until a few days from now when you will be able to leave here,\nwhen the, when all the tumult had died down, and there is no longer, uh maybe, uh inspection or\npatrols. And I went up to that attic and stayed there with a little bit of provision that I took along,\nand there was a cot on the side that I was lying on, and a wooden door, as it is in attics, like a\nstorage place with a lock, a padlock on the outside, and that wooden door had panels, and through\nthese panels, there were cracks. You could actually peep and see what's going on. So I had to be\nsure that I was out of the range of vision if somebody would look in, and was right on the side,\nstanding against the wall or lying down or sitting on that bed. At one point, I heard, from time to\ntime, my cousin would come up anyway, would say, would find out if I am all right, if I need\nanything, water, or anything like that, and they would supply me in these couple of days. But at\none point one afternoon, I hear steps, and they were not the usual steps of, of that young woman or\nher mother. But there were several steps, and there were noises. And I was in there and moved my\nhead to the crack, and peeped out, and there was Annie and two gendarmes with her. And they\nwanted to know who had the key to that lock to the, that's what I heard him ask her, and she says \"I\ndon't know. We just moved in here a few months ago, and never had access to this, but, the person,\nthe landlord who owns this, what was called a villa, something like that, that was called la pergola,\nSpanish name, \"They may have the key, but we will have to get in touch with them to get the key,",
        "but what is it?\" \"Well, we are looking for this fellow that was living here with you, and we'd like to\nlook for others also.\" She says, \"Well, he went away. He went away and never heard from him.\"\nor some such excuse. And when they were debating the issue of the key, whether to get in or go\nget the key, they tried to get near her, and touched her, and sort of (pause) told her that if she would\ngive in to their wishes, uh they would just forget about the whole thing. And when I heard it, that\njust sent a shiver down my spine. And they bent down over her, and tried to uh, caress her and\nfondle her and kiss, and she resisted to some extent, but also didn't want to make it too, to annoy\nthem too much, or anger them too much so they shouldn't get back, and after a while they just got\ndone with her, walked down the steps again with her, and uh, I don't know really what happened\nafter that, but, there was Annie, and due the fact that she sort of played along with them, I think\nthey did not insist on getting the key, or maybe breaking the door down. But, in their perception,\nsomeone who just disappears overnight, because they had all our names, and we had to register\nevery two weeks with the mayor. Another thing, as a follow-up to that. A couple of years ago, I\nsent a note to the city hall in Coterrey just to inquire about the name of the mayor, because I never\nknew the name, telling him also that he had done some good for us by notifying us, and that I live\nnow in America, and I might write some memoirs, or just, uh write some uh mementos on the uh,\nand that would be good for me to know his name, and they said, of course, the mayor died since\nthen, but we have his son's name, and he lives in Limoges, 1n fact, and he's about 80 years old now\nh,a ha. So, uh that was the, that was the story in the attic in Coterrey. So when you first said\nAnnie, it so happens I have a cousin Annie who lives here in, in America, that, for a moment I\ndidn't Yeah, 1n fact I'm going to see them in Belgium when I go there this, in May.\n-----any---comical stories you mentioned once about the ----\nbeep\nWhen uh, you were, you had, you were stopped to have your---\nOkay. That was after my escape. (Whispers) That's interesting. Think about the ---- when you saw\nthe film naturally. The clip. Pause. After my escape from the train in Northern France, I made my\nway back to the Southern zone below the demarcation line, into a town called Barnier de Bigor\n(ph). That was also a town where we were sent on assigned residence, forced residence. There\nwere many friends there, and there were many of us Jewish families there, and we lived there for\nmaybe close to a year, over half a year anyway, and from that town we were later sent to Coterrey.\nBut when I came back after my escape I went down to Barnier de Bigor, because there I had\nfriends, and I knew the family, Spearer (ph), who lived there, would probably take me in because",
        "that's the family I stayed with after I ran away from Coterrey, and then I was deported, and then I\ncame back to them.\nOkay, we've got to stop, we've got to change--\nBeep.\nNow we're going to start with the transports out of ----\nIn October of 1942, in the beginning of October, after I had run away from this forced residence in\nCoterrey, I made my way into Switzerland with a false identification card, travelling on train to the\nSwiss border. The Swiss arrested us and sent back to France. the Gendarme took custody of us,\nsent us to a camp in southern France called RiveSalle(ph) on the 20th of October, maybe a couple\ndays later, yeah on the 20th we were sent to RiveSalle to Transeille (ph) that was in the north of\nFrance, near Paris, near La Boucher ----, and we stayed in turn in Transeille till the 5th of\nNovember. On the 5th of November, in the evening we were entrained in the uh cattle cars in the\ntrain station of Le Boucher. The process of putting us into trains was very simple. They counted\nout 50, got into the train at the end of rifle butts--they pushed us in, and after the 50 were in the\ntrain, in that cattle car, in the car, they closed the doors and locked them. There was a family of\nfour, they would count out 48 49 50 and the 4th person, that would be the 51st person , a little boy\nof four, went into the next cattle car. He was not allowed to be with his family. The family was\nprotested, and that didn't help. If they would have protested more they could have been killed. The\nfather first. The family was worried. What would that little boy think of us? And the boy would\nthink, thought the parents didn't love him. so this was the separation of families that began right\nthere at the embarking into the transport. There was one bucket in the center of the car for the uses\nof relieving, to relieve yourself. And that bucket within a couple of hours overflowed, that stands\nto reason because there was 50 of us in that car. What we had seen in Transeille some of the\natrocities. A friend and I Manford Silberbaser decided that if we can we have to get away. And\nthere was no use trying anything while we were standing from about 5 or 6 in the evening till the\nnext morning which I later found out through the book that it was about 8 o clock. We had no\nnotion of time. We had no watches we had no all that was all taken away from us. So uh during\nthat night, during that long night waiting as to what\u2019s going to happen. When are we going to\nfinally start? Because we didn't know what their schedule was. They went by schedule that was\nparticularly prepared and organized and beaureaucratically enforced. Uh we were thinking, what\ncan be done. Luckily for us, the two windows that were at the opposite ends, diagonally opposite\nin the uh one had barbed wire bars and barbed wire, the other one had just bars. Barbed wire is",
        "never a real obstacle because, if they are rusty they break very easily, you can break them very\neasily, but the bars are still an obstacle so we set all night and wondered how can we make sure that\nthese bars that are there at a distance like this become separated enough for us to be able to\nsqueeze through. While we were sitting there thinking, it materialized in our minds that this is the\nway we going to do it. We'll have to twist them in some way, separate them in some way. we\ncouldn't do it while we were standing because the patrols were outside of the cars seeing that\neverything is okay, shining up and down and looking and shining in to see that everything's ok, but\nas soon as the train started in the morning, we were out of Paris, about a half an hour or so out of\nParis, we decided our task to pry these bars apart. And we know that when you make a cloth wet, it\nhas tensile strength in wringing it, you can wring it, and when you twist it it becomes like a\ntourniquet. So we took off our sweaters, pullovers, v-necks, and dipped them into that human\nwaste in the bucket, and didn't even have to use the bucket because the floor of the squatting 1n it\nand walking in it, and inhaling it, and it's still up there in my nostrils right now when I talk about it.\nAnd uh we used these sweaters to twist around the bars, these are the bars twisted around and\ntwist, twist, twist until all the liquid had poured out and had been twisted out, by that time, it had\ndeveloped that strength, and we did that off and off alternating between him and myself until the\nbars started to somewhat move in the frame. We saw them move. Why? Because the rust in the\nframe started falling down in dust. Rusty dust. And when we saw these bars moving, that was the\nlight at the end of the tunnel, to use a clich\u00e9, or uh what do you call it a metaphor. That was it. We\nknew that if we continued that often enough, that eventually, these bars would be giving enough for\nus to be able to bend them. Up and down up and down until finally they had moved enough where\nwe could bend them into the into a position where the opening was wide enough for us to be able to\nsqueeze through----At a given moment we did, and after we escaped, and uh we uh lay there in the\nin the ravine for a while that almost seemed like an eternity made our way into a village, went to a\nbake shop, the apprentice came to the door and told us there was no bread now, not until the\nmorning, and we said we're not interested in bread, we would like to know where the village priest\nlives and he said he was going to take us to his house or home which was right adjoining the\nsacristy uh joming the church, and we got to him, we had torn off our Jewish stars. I feel now that\nif we had them on it would have been more reassuring for him because he would have known who\nwe were although it could have been a trap, but uh, he recog--we told him that we had escaped\nfrom a train were very frank with him, and we didn't know, he could have been a collaborator too\nyou know, but we felt we were in good hands as we saw the face of the man. And he said yeah\nthey come through here several times a week, and uh we know we know that but you know, he says\nI can let you stay",
        "here for the night. But in the morning, very early, I have to get you out of your warm bed, because\nbetween 5 and 6, a patrol can come by here almost---. So he gave us milk and bread and cheese",
        "warm milk, put us into a feather bed, into a crisp white sheet, and that after being in Transeilles\nwith a straw on a cement floor and vermin and uh putrid stench and it was like you were on a\ncloud. And when he woke us with that soft voice in the morning Hey Fellows Leg----Vous que\nvous levez. You have to get up. Vous que vous partais. Vous partir. You have to get away\nbecause you know, gave us a m---to another colleague of his, also another priest in the village, not\ntoo far, and we spent the next day in his place, an adjoining stable, not a barn, a stable, and we\nspending that night lying between cows two cows, and gave a cozy feeling to fall asleep hearing\nthem chew the cud and that odor still yeah when I go through a countryside today I say ---and it's\nreally an interesting uh aspect, and I go through a countryside and I smell manure dung, I inhale it\nwith a relish ha, ha like its ah (laugh). I said well, that brings back memories you know. But it is\ninteresting that these little things are all a process of surviving, and a process of resisting. You look\nback at some of the things with horror, you look back at some of the things with a different kind of\nfeeling, a feeling of freedom, and you have made it. In fact, the feeling after we had escaped,\nwhatever will happen from now on will never be, will no longer be an obstacle, because if we made\nthat, we will be, we will come out of it all right. That was our gut feeling. so we did make that\nescape in that respect. And we walked a country road the following days, a couple of days later,\nand I told my friend Fred, I said Freddy, 30 years from now we'll talk about that-we won't believe\nit. He says You're crazy. What you talking about 30 years from now. YOu don't know what's\ngoing to be 3 days from now. And he was right. Because I wound up in jail after that. But again.\nAll that was an aftermath. And even when I was in jail serving a9 month sentence. From a year it\nbecame 9 1/4 months off for good behavior. Even when I was sent to jail, I knew wherever they're\ngoing to take me from now on in, I will not let it happen to me. And that's just the way it worked\nout. Pause I had the desire, the deep desire, the...premonition with it that I will come out of it, if\nfor nothing else, but to be able to tell a story, because those who have gone and have perished are\nnot able to do it. So we are here, and that's in hindsight, everything just fell in line for me, thank\nGod.\nWere you heroes when you got out? Time is running out.\nBeep beep beep beep beep beep\nBeep\nThe question was, do I consider myself a hero, what I did, something heroic? It's uh strange, an\nescape, 1s not being rewarded by a medal. That's a thing that heroes get as a as a as a token. but,\nthere 1s a reward for that. The reward is that we survived. I survived to be able to tell a story. That",
        "is enough of a pass it on so that maybe future generations can learn from it. But heroism is not\nsomething that you plan or that comes after big consideration of what you're supposed to do or\nwhatever. Heroism is a spur of the moment phenomenon. Somebody saves, like it happened some\nyears ago, a young lady from the icy waters of the Potomac, in Washington, that man when he got\nup in the morning, didn't say today I'm going to become a hero. I'll be a hero. He happened to be at\nthe time, at a place where he took something into his own hands, and said I'm supposed to do that,\nand that night and that evening and following ensuing weeks and months he was interviewed, and it\nwas a heroic thing in a way. And heroism springs from a fear basically. Now when you see a\nmonument of a general there in a park, and he has won this or that battle, and he was a hero and he\nwas decorated for it, what that monument doesn't tell you that stone or bronze statue does not tell\nyou is one thing: how scared he may have been at the time when it all happened. So, my escape is\nnot so much heroic as it is as they say in the uh ethics of the fathers, there isn't a thing that hasn't its\nplace, and there isn't a man who hasn't his time or something of that, I'm paraphrasing it vaguely.\nBut it was the right person at the right time at the right place, and there's two factors in that\nparticular escape, in that whole situation of my survival. One is fear. And not just fear spelled out\nnormally but with a major capital letter. FEAR. And the second is luck. There has to be an\namount of luck or fortune or fate. what do you want to call it--something metaphysical. Because\nthe train that left 2 days earlier--according to what I hear there was one escape attempt by a man,\nand he fell under the wheels of the train, and his legs were amputated, and he was thrown back into\nthe car to bleed to death. So we had to be lucky after we had taken the decision, for it to succeed.\nAnd all the ensuing months to be arrested and to run again and to escape and to have a situation\nwith a German SS officer in that train station in Limoges when I was observing something as was\nthe truth. and I told the man then that I was just watching something, not observing, there's a\ndifference between the two because I was there to find out something. But that is my point of my\nescape. The question was, Are you a hero? I don't like to relate to myself as a hero, because it was\nfear and luck, and I don't even ... enjoy or...exalt in the term survivor. There are many people in the\nworld that have to survive in circumstances that are not life or death like. Mine in this particular\ntime because 72 hours later I would have been gassed, according to the statistics. But people have\nsometimes have to survive on a daily basis. we see that in our cities, we see that in present life.\nBut what survivor is, has a connotation, almost on a, it's almost a word of curiosity, you know. I\noften feel that when I speak to schools, and people ask questions, they...I'm an object of curiosity,\nand I don't want to be that. Because what survivor is, connotes a special situation that you're in , a\nspecial character that you are, a special place in life that you have. Yes, we are survivors. the\nword tells you that. But the real heroes are really those that are no longer here to tell the story.\nThey are the people who went there and .... martyrs in a way, yes, but, quite heroic because...They\nwere good people, and uh especially when we speak about children, I see my own granddaughter,",
        "when I look at a million and a half children lost they were the real...what do you call it? In football,\nyou call it unsung heroes, in a way. Unsung. Remembered. But very much unsung. there could\nhave been a nation today, a million and a half children growing into a fully grown nation. As uh\nGerda Weismann Klein says, \"they were ordinary children, but quite a few of them could have\nbeen extraordinary.\" Extraordinary. These were the heroes.",
        "Can you tell about on the train when you made the decision and how, how different people felt on\nthe train about your decision to escape.",
        "It is interesting when you're together with a group of people of 50 coming from all walks of life, a\nmicrocosm if you will, of, of Jewry, of humanity, abandoned by the rest of the world, or at the time\nwe didn't quite sense that we were abandoned because we were given all kinds of psychological\nmeans to think that we were going to be working and resettled and that sort of thing. People were\ntrying to talk us out of escaping, especially the males in that train. There was one woman on\ncrutches there, I've often mentioned her. Deep-set, dark deep-set eyes, grey streaky grey hair,\ntaking care of a young child...who was there without parents, on a crutch, on crutches. She had a\nleg amputated, and she pointed that crutch at us, punctuating the air with that crutch like a weapon.\n\"You must do it! Run, run! You will tell a story!\" And others tried to talk us out of it. We had to\nwork feverishly on this thing because we never knew when the train would come to a halt, and the\nguards would step down and try to look, lucky , again luck. Luckily for us, the train did not stop\nduring that period during the day, where they would come by and see perhaps a notice that\nsomething has been worked on those bars. They were trained also to watch out for things. Like we\nwere trained, or like we, sixth sense tells us what to do and what not to do. Yes. And the\npsychology of it was, \"Why did they try to talk us out? Because before we left the camp, our\nbelongings were taken from us. Jewelry, watches. And we were given a receipt with a number,\nand our name was on it. And that receipt said that this is what we deposited. And we were told\n\"don't lose that because you won't get your things back when you get there.\" That was the\npsychology. Now, when we worked feverishly, and they tried to talk us out of it, foolish, we'll all\nbe killed, they will discover you that you're missing, and they'll take it out on us. Well, if that's the\nfeeling that you have, then, we are not going anywhere where you deal with human beings,\ncertainly, which only fortifies our premonition that where we're going we're not going to make it.\nRumors had been flying, but they were never entirely confirmed, verified. And then they said,\nLook what we have in our hand! They wouldn't bother giving us this if they didn't mean to return\nthese things to us! That little receipt for the meaningless little pieces of jewelry in this respect at\nthat time, all that had no more meaning. It was just something you wanted to hold on to because\nthat presents you with a feeling that you're still alive. But, to them, that certificate was, in fact, that",
        "little receipt was in fact a document telling them that they will be all right, that they will be alive,\nand to me it doesn't didn't mean anything. That was the psychology of it. And we had to overcome,\nnot only our own, perhaps sometimes hesitation. There was still this thing we have to get out and\njump, and there's still danger ahead. That one thing vs. them admonishing Don't leave us in a way.\nStay with us. Don't do it to us. Now, Manfred Silver was, and Leo Bretholz, we were single\nyoung man. And it's part of a young person's makeup to be somewhat...adventurous. Maybe not\nthought out too much. Just to do it. Impulse.",

        "Start with you and your friend?",
        "Coming back one more time to this hero thing, there were some people that had a lot to do with me\nduring those months and a couple years. First of all, the priest. Now, there's an unsung hero. He\ncould have gotten into trouble. The lady in Limoges with whom I boarded and my friend Eugene\nBass. Hiding us out up in the attic, knowing who we were, Madame Bergot, lovely lady, non-\nJewish, had a tragedy of her own when she was 21, lost her husband in the third (?) world war,\nnever got married. A life like this, always helping people. This nurse in the hospital, that I\nmentioned before. By her telling me that she knows who I was, but as long as she's going to be\nthere, nothing's going to happen to me. That's a little unsung heroic story because she put herself\nout. She could have just gone about her way without saying anything. And uh, I don't know.\nMadame Bergot's name I know, and that Sister Joan of Arc, I know Saint Joan of Arc. she was a\nsaint. But that priest's name I never knew because names in that moment didn't mean much as long\nas he didn't know ours, we didn't know his, but his actions meant so much. So that's more but, what\nyou might consider heroic, or in a , in a uh vague description uh description of it, something that\nborders on, on, on maybe being heroic or being there when you're needed. Maybe that's also a\npoint, but uh, whoops.",
        "beep",
        "We want to go to the choices, and the difference in choices, like you and your friend on the train\nwere young men, but, choices that other people wouldn't have, like families.",
        "The um, it is very simple for young people who are unattached, want to be impetuous, adventurous,\ntake it into their own hands, make a decision at the spur of the moment, uh well thought out, or not\nthought out at all, but a decision that had to do with basically survival in mind. And I have to come",
        "back to the big word 'fear'. No matter how a family that was in the, in the , for instance, in the\ncattle car. No matter how such a family would have wanted to get out of the situation, no matter\nhow much a father perhaps seeing me squeeze through, would have been tempted to also squeeze\nthrough, and get to freedom. There was that family situation that would prevent him from doing\nso. But this relative of mine was in that same train. And she was the one that handed me my bag,\nmy rucksack, through the through the window, between the bars, handed it to me, and I put it over\nmy shoulder. Tony Goodfry (?) She went to Auschwitz and perished. And these faces, I see. The\nchoice was ours because we were free, unfettered in a way, to do it. Free to jump and go and do\nwhat we wanted to do. Families couldn't. Ill people couldn't, infants couldn't. Somebody came\nand was dragged into a cattle car on a stretcher. Actually brought from a camp on a stretcher.\nCouldn't walk. These people couldn't. And it so happens that according to what I hear, there were\nless than a dozen attempts at escape during that period from Transeilles to Auschwitz, during the\nperiod from Spring 1942 to almost into the fall of 1944. There were about a dozen attempts at\nescape and only several, three or four succeeded actually. So, when I did mention my escape to\nProfessor Gilbert when he wrote the book Holocaust, he became very interested in it. The first\nquestion was, \"If you were on that train, so how are you here talking to me?\" That's when I told\nhim about the escape, and he was especially interested in the aspect of the Swiss having sent me\nback, because he had a very prominent chapter there on Switzerland, and their dastardly acts during\nthat period. Not everybody could make the decision. In fact, not everybody, is quite, quite, quite\nan understatement. The majority could not make decision like this from a train, because trains\nwere quite often entirely without windows at all, especially in the East. The trains were also\npacked much more in the East, about 100 I understand, per cattle car. And the escape routes were\nnot as available, although some people tried to hack a board out of the out of the floor. There were\nsometime older cars and they were loose anyway, and with an instrument that you may have\nfashioned, manufactured in camp, a knife or a some such sharp instrument, you could do it. Some\nof it went through the roof, perhaps trying... but there was, not everybody couldn't, could do that.\nIn fact, the psychology, and that's again, prevented you from doing foolish things to endanger\nyourself. You could get killed for that, they will take it out on you, and the proof of it is up to the\nvery last minute, and these are the reports, then they were taken to the gas chambers, being told that\nit was showers, and they were told to hang up their clothes on those hooks, and put their shoes right\nunder their clothes, so when they came out, don't forget where you hung \u2018em, don't misplace them,\nbecause you will not be issued new clothes or different clothes or other clothes. That psychology\nworked unto the very last minute when the men and women and the infants in their arms walked\ninto the gas chambers. Nobody in France could believe in these cattle cars, that they were going to\ntransport us 72 hours---we didn't know how long we were going to be in this transport--turns out\nabout 72 1/2 hours. Nobody, having been put in that cattle car at the moment. You would talk to",
        "people would actually believe that they're taking us there to be killed or gassed. Because if they\nwanted to do something to us, they could do it right here. Why drag us 3 thousand miles? That\nwas so Machiavellian. It was so organized. So psychologically prepared. Up to the most minute\ndetail. All that created at once the conference???? that we just remembered that happened 50 years\nago last week...on the 20th of January. Everything was meticulously prepared, and the word went\nout from the SS, from Himmler, and from the generals, colonels, that when you will, nobody in the\nfuture will believe that anyway. So you don't have to really worry about it. And that, that is, that\nwas the psychology of it. Why we were so unusual in having done it when others didn't do it\nbecause we were free, and they were not free to do it and they were also as I said, never quite\npsychologically prepared to believe that it was within the power of a human being to do that to\nanother human being. And I come back to the ---- to a child. To a child (whispers). That's a big\ntragedy. That people still believed in people--the goodness of people. And you see Winds of War\nin the last segment when the woman opened the door, opened the door for her and she stands there\nand she talks to the SS man standing there with his dog and his white gloves, and she said, \"Sir, we\nhave 7 people, 7 dead people in this car.\" and he turns to her, and says in a very wry smile, \"These\nare the lucky ones.\" That's when she realized that she was confronted with somebody who was not\nreally human. But in the car, as the car was rolling on to the French countryside, that beautiful\nbucolic countryside, nobody could believe that this was possible to be happening, because human\nnature doesn't want to believe that uh another human being can do that. Anne Frank says that, in\nthe last sentence, at the bottom of it all I still believe that people are good. Final sentence in her, in\nher diary. And that's what the belief was, that, no matter what they say, what the rumors say, that it\nisn't quite possible. There were these gamuts of moods running through that train, from prayers to\ntears to despair, resignation--quite a bit of hopelessness. And some people were telling jokes. To\novercome--to stay alive or show life.",

        "I want you to talk a little bit about how Germans saw Jews, and how things changed in Vienna.\nHow do you remember the changes?",
        "Your question is about my, how I remember what happened in Austria. Let me say at the time of\nthe Anschluss, the annexation. I was 17. I just turned 17. It was an overnight traumatic change.\nPeople who were your friends on the 10th of March and the 11th of March, were no longer your\nfriends on the 13th, or at least showed that they were no longer, or at least maybe you thought they\nwere your friends before, and they were really never friends. To a young person like myself,\nmaybe I did not feel the impact as much as perhaps parents felt when it happened because they had",
        "to worry about their children. but it was an overnight turmoil. More so emotionally than anything\nelse. There was a disruptive, uh, an interruption of a normal life. this was March. We had\nneighbors with whom we were very friendly and they were Christians and at Christmas time, that\nparticular year, in previous years when we were smaller we would go to their apartment and help\nthem decorate the trees, share the cookies, go to school together. Overnight, within hours, Vienna\nwas transformed into a sea of swastikas. Where did they come from overnight? They were not\nmanufactured overnight? It was a total metamorphosis of, of attitudes of feelings, of emotions of\nuh relations. Everything more emotionally and...psychologically, than the physical aspects of it.\nAlthough, physically, within hours, or a couple days, the Jews were taken out to the streets to scrub\nthe streets, and they were given little brushes, toothbrushes, to go and try to rub away oil paint that\nthe Austrians had painted on the sidewalks and on the walls (German quote): Red white and red\nuntil we're dead, which was Shushnik, the Austrian government\u2019s slogan not to vote for a, a\nreferendum to vote for Austria to remain Austria. That was the Austrian colors, red, white, red, and\nstill are. So how could these Jews, these women, children and elderly get these oil painted slogans\noff the sidewalks. It was impossible. But this was part of the harassment. And sometimes this was\ndone to the strains of Wagner's music, you know. Tanheuser and ---------. People dancing around.\nAnd poking fun. And elderly Jews having their beards set afire with matches. And then the fire,\nthe flame finally seared towards the chin. They would take buckets of water and pour it into their\nfaces. These were....utter denigration, harassment, for the pure joy of doing it. This is what we saw\nin Austria. Hundreds of thousands of people standing on the Heldenplatz to ---- off the heroes in\nthe Innerstadt (?), the first district----. And applauding, cheering, recerving the Germans, the Nazis.\nThe Austrians later claimed that they were the first victims. I did not see at that time, and I can say\nthat without any hesitation, I did not see any victimization of the Austrian non-German, non-Jewish\npopulation, although, those who were part of the socialist movement, and those who were in the\nlabor unions, they were also hiding out, and some of them ran away, and I know that the Center\nforward of the Austrian football team called Austria--------Matthias Sindilar?? committed suicide\nbecause he was emotionally so inflamed by that, what had happened, yes that happened. But if an\nAustrian wanted to put on a brown uniform, and walk with that brown uniform, nobody would\nhave known what he was thinking. He could have done it. But the Jew couldn't do it. But\nbasically the heil, heil, heil, heil, and zeke heil was a shout that was heard, I only wish it would\nhave been heard far enough so that some of the western powers would have done something about\nit at the time, maybe in hindsight, they might...have a feeling that could have prevented a lot of\nthings, if they would have right then and there started with to resist Hitler. But Austria instead they\nwent to Munich and gave him another peace. And that land for peace thing that we hear a lot of\nnow, pertaining to the Middle East as far as I'm concerned, the land for peace has really, in history,\nnowhere in history you can go from beginning to end of history books, land for peace has never",
        "worked. Because those who want land are never satisfied with that land. It's like a spider. Hitler\ncaught Austria, and that was his first victim in that spider web. And He wasn't satisfied, there\nwould have had to be more. In fact, the resistance should have come before Austria, when they\nwalked into the Tsar land (?) the Germans and the French should have resisted. But that's history,\nthat has not much to do with my particular story, but being the question is how did Austrians and\nhow did Germans because I had more contact with the Austrians than with the Germans per se, but\nthe Austrians, uh, were not really the first victims. They recetved the Germans with open hands, as\nfar as I can see, and History has borne that out--I'm sure there's always exceptions.\nNow, um assume that I don't know what a deportation--explain to me what a deportation 1s.\nTo deport someone is to send someone against his will into a place, where he will be exposed to\nhardships, to harassments, to forced settlements, to um....um...be 1n a surrounding that isn't his, in a\ncountry where, where he doesn't even, nobody speaks his language, and it is uh, it is this the, the,\nthe, the forcible shipping of people into areas away from their home in order to fulfill a certain\nagenda, a political agenda, where he uh he uh, a plan that was conceived to uh to .......to do harm to\na certain group of people. People get exiled Because they have politically done something to uh...\nNapoleon was exiled. The Kaiser went into voluntary exile. Uh, we hear about uh, South\nAmerican dictators, they go into voluntary exile. If they had not voluntarily taken that exile upon\nthem, they may have been arrested, tried, and maybe executed. Or if they live in a country that\ndoesn't execute, they would have been deported. They would have been asked, other countries\nwould have been asked to accept them. Like Archbishop Trifor (?) was in Detroit after he was\ndenaturalized here. He was deported. Nobody wanted him. Finally Portugal took him in. He was\nthe fellow with this...the head of the armed guard in Romania, killed uh thousands of Jews. Lived\nin Detroit.\nWhat is deportation to you?\nDe de... what, in France?\nIn, throughout Europe.\nThroughout Europe, deportation means taking whole populations, and moving them against their\nwill into an area of confinement, where they were exposed to the wind, and all the vicissitudes that\ncame with being in, 1n that particular confinement, and these confinements were camps.",
        "beep\nWe have to quickly sum up what did it mean to be deported?\nUnder the nor, under normal circumstances a deportation of a person takes place when that person\nor that group have made an attempt to topple a government, or to do something that is not lawful,\ndo something that is against the law, and they could be deported, they could be as undesirable\naliens or as uh whatever the designation is. These Jews, men, women and children, were deported\nfor nothing else but to send them from their country of residence in to an area to be confined in\ncamps, they can be called concentration camps, and the real word for some of them is\nextermination camps. To be deported, not as they said, to be resettled, but to work but for one\nthing namely to be exterminated. But, that was in the case of the Jews. Deportation normally\nmeans the sending away of a person or a group of persons who are at the moment under some\ncloud of suspicion, or endangering uh a situation, a government or uh a rebellious, or instigating\naway from their home. Deportation 1s a word, is also a, a form of punishment. It's banishment and\npunishment. Ina way you're being exiled...away from your home of origin into an area where you\nare not at home. As long as you\u2019re away from the place where you are not desired. And Jews were\nundesirable under the German occupation in these various countries that they were deported from.",
        "I want to get back to Oradour, and I want you to tell me what that massacre was and tell me about\nthe confusion of the -----.\nThere was, there were two Oradours in the area of Limoges. One was Oradour Surglane, and one\nwas Oradour Survaires. Glan G-L-A-N-E, and Vaires, V-A-I-R-E-S. The German division das\nreich who had advanced from Toulouse towards the frontlines in Normandy, that was on the, after\nthe 6th of June landing in 1944, had encountered some resistance maquis activity on the way up\nfrom the south to the west, to the coast, and , they had been informed that the village of Oradour,\nbeing that they had already been harassed and attacked, and were already in the village of Toulle,\nand had uh, was it------, but anyway in the Corais, had already hung a lot of males on butcher hooks\nin front of butcher stores, and their families had to parade in front of them to see that. Being that\nthere was restistance to the advance they had taken that out on these mens, were taken hostage.\nThey advanced and had heard that the village of Oradour in Otvien, the department, well Limoges\nwas the capital of that department, had a, a maquis, a resistance movement. Except they confused\nOradour Survaires with Oradour Surglane. It was the vaires on the river vaires, survaires means on\nthe river vaires, that really had a resistance, small resistance uh detachment, and there were arms\nthere in that area. They confused them. They went into Oradour, arrested the mayor, and asked\nhim to show them the cage of arms, and he says we have no, we have peaceful citizens. We don't,\nyou can search the village. They arrested them, and in the main square, there's a report, I have that\nreport also, but, there's a report on the main square, they were getting ready to saw his legs off in\nfront of the populace, and his two sons begged them not to do it, and ...they would stand in for him.\nThey still did it, and then killed the sons too, and in the village between 8 and 900 people were\nkilled that day. That was the confusion. They went in there, told the female and the children's\npopulations, Come to the church and we'll photograph you, and that was the end of them, they were\nmassed into the church, and as I said before the church was surrounded by hay and straw and was\nset aflame, and of course, today that village of Oradour, a quarter mile away, or an eighth of a mile\naway, has been built up again, and this ruin, the town where the ruins of the church are, and with\nother mementos, is still there in the original site of Oradour with all kinds of mementos like baby\ncarriages and dolls and shoes and buckles and belts and toys and that sort of thing. That was the\ntragedy of Oradour for which there was trial held in Bourdeaux, and uh some of \u2018em were\nsentenced to, well the----------- amount of sentences.\nUh, tell me how you witnessed the November pogrom of--------.\nI did not witness it. Talking about the Kristallnacht, I did not witness, because I was lucky",
        "enough, again, a stroke of luck, that I left Vienna on the 25th of October. 1938. The Kristallnacht\nhappened during the night from the 9th to the 10th of November. It so happens, during that night I\nhad already escaped Vienna, swum, I had been swimming, uh to the to the Sour?? river into\nLuxembourg during the night from the 31st of October to the lst of November, it was All Saints\nNight, after it had been raining for about 5 or 6 days. I had to swim a river that the smuggler had\ntold me I will be able to wade through, and he said to me, Keep a pair of dry socks in your coat,\nand I put \u2018em in my coat, and the next step was up to here in water, so here go my dry socks. And,\num, I did not, I did not witness it in Austria because I had a strong feeling had I been there I would\nhave been arrested with so many young men that were. My mother had beseeched me to leave, and\nshe was the one that prevailed upon me to leave, and I see this woman's eyes in Vienna--grey hair,\nshe was prematurely gray, and uh it was due to her that I am frankly alive today. Had she not sent\nme away then, I would have been there on Kristallnacht. Who knows, this is all conjecture. But,\nduring that night from the 31st of October to the Ist of November, I crossed the river, and from the\n9th of the 10th of November, I was smuggled into Belgium, and there was about 6 7 8 people in\nthis car, and the smuggler that smuggled me to Luxembourg, was also the one that smuggled us to\nBelgium. As we approaching the Belgian border, going North from Luxembourg, in the Adens\nregion, we looked to the right and there was a strange appearance in the skies, a strange coloration\ninto reddish and purplish, and uh weird colors, almost like some sort of natural phenomenon, and it\nwas interesting to view at the time, but little did we know that this was Kristallnacht, and all of\nGermany was aflame. It wasn't till the next day, the 10th of November, arriving in Brussels that we\nsaw the headlines describing, headlines speaking about what had gone, and then reading further of\nwhat uh, the tragedy of it was. And that is the way I witnessed Kristallnacht from a distance, just\nwith its reflections.",
        "Tell me about your who in your immediate family survived, and what happened to some of your\nsiblings.",
        "When you speak about immediate family, nobody in my immediate family survived, my mother\nand two sisters were gassed. My father died a natural death in Vienna in 1930, he was only 39\nyears old. He would not have survived. He was an activist. He would not have survived in\nAuschwitz. I know. Then there were figuring that on my mother's side were 10 brothers and\nsisters, and on my father's side 9. Quite a few of them were married, had children. I have still a\nfew surviving relatives in Israel now. And an aunt in Paris. Couple cousins. I have 3 cousins. But\nbetween 40 and 50 members of my family perished, immediate family, speaking about. Family,\nfamily. My mother and 2 sister. I said goodbye to them in Vienna in 1938 on the 25th of October.\nThat was hard. Very stark scene that brings this back to my memory, and I will never forget it, 1s",
        "when I went to the hospital to visit my younger sister, she was then confined with scarlet fever.\nShe was not only in confinement, but in quarantine. This was incurable (?) at the time, had to go to\nthe hospital, there was no injections for that. Scarlet fever was a quite uh current thing. And I went\nto visit her to tell her goodbye, she was on the 2nd floor like a little elevated at the window, and I,\nin sign language, wrote, told her that I will be leaving tonight, and she wrote on the blackboard,\nGood luck, I hope I see you soon.\nPut one more roll up.\nbeep\nI want to go back to the story of Annie again, and, can just encapsulate the story, and then talk\nabout how you talked with her about it later when you were hiding in the attic.\nThat story with the hiding in the attic in Coterrey was a very scary situation because I had just\ncome back from the mountains, and I didn't want to be caught again. But , uh, as I said, before,\nthese gendarmes went up the stairway with her, and in order to entice her to, to, to uh to open up,\nthey don't know what they, she didn't want to open up, and she had no key to open up, and they\ncould have broken down the door, but um, when they approached her and made advances to her,\nand she sort of implied yes, if you would just get off the stairs, and just go down, she'll talk to them.\nNow later, when we talked about it, she told 1t to me with tears. Never went into any kind of\ndetails, but I don't think that they actually violated her, because it was in the house where her\nparents lived also. But uh, later when we spoke about it, 1t was just another aspect of a moment of\ntension that worked out to the good rather than what it could have worked out, namely, I could\nhave been arrested right then and there, and sent into deportation rather than two months later, two\nmonths later when I was sent back from Switzerland and it could have been a whole together\ndifferent situation, but later on in life, we talked about it when I visited Belgium again, and it was a\ntense moment. It was mainly, we talked about it 1n a very light way. No details uh to any effect.\nHow was it different for people in your mother's generation to experience the war? From how it\nwas with you?\nYou mean in 1938?\nThrough the whole thing. In general. In general terms.",
        "I, I wish I wish I could really other than speculate. Conjecture. Have some sort of a, I wish there would\nhave been a but in that transport where my mother and sisters were, how she took to that situation, and\nhow she coped with it, and what her trepidations were and what her thoughts were, and what uh the\nfeelings, and when I heard that they were in trucks, and were gassed in trucks, I almost was relieved\nactually, because I know when you travel in a truck, you can doze off, you can fall asleep, you're tired,\nand then you just doze off and that's 1t. Because this is odorless and colorless, and uh it can kill you\nthese gasses, uh carbon dioxide that kills you. But, how was her generation taking it? By sending me\naway, I know it was a trauma to her. It must have been. Because we do that when we send kids to\ncamp only for 2 wks or for 2 days or for over a day or, or day camp. We admonish them. We say take\ncare of yourselves, and when you go away for a longer time, it is Do um, write to us, let's keep in touch,\ndon't catch cold. My mother coped with it , I hope in a in a courageous way. She had 2 daughters with\nher. She had become a widow 8 yrs earlier, and she was used to life of hardship perhaps.\nUnfortunately, between the end of a hardship after the 1st world war, and then the depression in the\nearly late 20s and early 30s. To 1938, there was very little breathing room for them to recover. So 1\nthink the life of my mother and my relatives and my uh grandparents during that period was one of\nhardship all the time, overcoming. My grandparents living in Poland had to overcome pogroms at the\nturn of the century and even the early 20th C and harassment. My mother didn't have much time to\nprobably cope with anything. Just to know that there's enough= food on the table the next day for the\nkids after my father died and she was a seamstress, and she did the best and we went to school and we\nhad our we had our food and we had clothing and we had schooling and we went to movies and we had\ngood times and bad times, but I could never really go into a detail then and ask my mother, How do you\nfeel about this now? Because it was all spur of the moment decisions, and we couldn't sit down and\ndiscuss it really. We could discuss the fact, yes, you have to leave rather than us. Why? I knew was\ngoing to have to go through a river, and perhaps swim. I was the scout, I went there hoping that if that\nsucceeds, that eventually my mother and sisters would be able to follow. But from 38 to 1940 when the\nlowlands were invaded, and I was a refugee, and I had no financial means, and to have a smuggler\nsmuggle you, you need to pay somebody. So, I hope that eventually I will accumulate a little bit, and,\nmaybe get somebody to help, but there was not time between 38 and 40 in those --- between- 1940 the\nlowlands were attacked, but in 39 the war started on the Eastern front, so after that there was no leaving\nanywhere anymore, so it was just a year had gone by, well maybe a year and a half, and, and uh, that\nwas, that was uh the end of our being together in a way because uh it , if it had lasted longer, if the\nGermans had not attacked in 1940, but maybe in 1941, maybe there would have been a chance for my\nsisters and my mother to follow me to Belgium. But, we did correspond, yes, they wrote to us in veiled\nterms, in cold terms, that things were bad and that was happening, and they were going to a ghetto and\nall that sort of thing, but um, I think In the life of a Jewish mother,....any Jewish person, I think one little\nmore, one other little period of suffering was just a, was just another , another segment of a of a totality",
        "of uh sad events. This was part of the psyche. Did not have time to go into any kind of details as to\nwhat she thought of the future. Yeah I know what she thought of the future, \"I hope we'll see you soon.\n\" That was the hope. Naturally, that was always the hope. If you don't have any hope anymore, then\nyou don't have anything. And it was hoping against hope of course, which at the time we didn't know.\nAnd anything I would say, as to her feelings or attitudes I would only be guessing and using another\nconjecture.",
        "Who was Marguerite Bergot? Just give me a little portrait.",
        "Marguerite Bergot was the lady whom I referred to before, who was the owner of that little house that I\nstayed in, in uh in Limoges. Uh, I lived in an attic, monsad (?) it's called in French. Apartment. And uh\nactually shared it with my friend, Eugene Bass, and when we had people come into Limoges from our\ngroups from surrounding areas, with cards, or with material, with uh painting materials, with inks, or\njust communication, they would come into Limoges, they would also stay with us. Something in that\nlittle Monsad up there that one bed and 2 armchairs we may have had 6 or 8 people sometime up there,\nand then we just stretched out on the bed or made do for one night on the floor in the bed on the chairs,\nand uh, there was no running water in that monsad, we had to go out to the corridor one flight below,\nand bring water up from that faucet to a wash basin. And Madame Bergot was the owner of that place,\nand she knew exactly who we were, she knew me by name, she knew me by name, uh, Maxon\nReLefevre. Later she learned my real name, she knew all about war names, and when somebody would\ncome to the door and inquire, or ask any kind of questions that she would feel were sort of digging into\nor trying to find things out she would just play so dumb as can be, I don't know what you\u2019re talking\nabout. She was a very witty lady, she was a very good lady. A constant smile. And uh very human,\nand understanding. And Madame Bergot sent me a silver napkin ring engraved with MB, and she says,\nThat's for your son, because my son had the same initials, Myron Bretholz, so she just gave me that as a\ntoken. We went to visit her in 1970, yes in 1970, and uh, no actually not, that was 1970, we didn't go to\nLimoges. in 1954 we went to Limoges, my wife and I. And we went to visit Madame Bergot, and we\nwalked through the Limoges main square, and they have a market there 3 days a week, china ware all\nover the place, people are just stepping over it. You wouldn't , some people would think that's a crime,\nto step on china, you know, but there she was, Madame Bergot 1n the main square, and we fell into each\nother's arms, \"What you doing here?\" I say, \"Well, we came to France, we just on our way to visit you.\"\nand my wife met Madame Bergot, very, very nice and pleasant get-together. that's when she gave us,\nshe sent us letter, and that ring for my son. And uh, she did a lot. Yeah, she's also one of those little\nheroes, that uh, unsung heroes, she's no longer alive, Madame Bergot. Marguerite Bergot, yes.\nBeautiful lady.",
