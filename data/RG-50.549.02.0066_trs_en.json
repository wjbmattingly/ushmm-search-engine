The United\nStates Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for\nmaking this interview possible. This is tape number one, side A. I would like to ask you\ntwo questions, first of them 1s actually give us your full name, and when and where you\nwere born.",
        "Answer: My name is Julian Noga. I was born July 31\u201c, 1921 in Poland.",
        "Q: And because there were several questions that I have after watching the videotaped\ninterview, I thought several things were not discussed in detail enough, I would like to go\nback, actually, to the beginning, even before you born and just ask a few follow up\nquestions. The first would be, until -- before you were born, actually, until 1921, your\nfamily was in -- in this country, in the U.S.. Where did they live and what did your father\ndo?",
        "A: Yes, my parents come to this country 1 -- before first World War. And they were\nmarried o -- here in this country, North Adams, Massachusetts. And they had three sons,\nand in 1921, after the first World War, my mother decided to go Poland. I don\u2019t know\nwhether she go for a visit, or she go for steady -- to stay in Poland. And at that time,\n1921, she was pregnant with me. Soon she arrived to Poland, two months after that, I was\nborn in Poland. So otherwise, my three brothers was born here, and my father stay in this\ncountry, just my mother and my three brothers, and she was pregnant with me, she come t\n-- t -- to Poland.",
        "Q: But you never quite knew why that happened, why was your father still here? Was the\nidea to go back eventually, or --",
        "A: I think that was little bit differences in their marriage.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s le -- we can le -- we can leave it at that. Now, when you were back, or\nwhen your mother was back in Poland, did you have a little bit of land there? Where did\nyou go to and how did she make a living, how did she care for the family?",
        "A: Yes, my mother had a few acres land, and I was grow up there on the country, by\nTarnow, wa -- quite a ways from Tarnow, their name is Byshutshin, and the village was\n[indecipherable] what 1s hard to pronounce, right, for you? Okay, and I go school there,\nand soon I finished the school, I myself go to the big city, Tarnow, and --",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back -- let\u2019s go back just a little bit to -- to the first village. How lo -- how\nmany years of schooling did you -- did you get? For how many years did you go to\nschool?",
        "A: Well, that was seven years.",
        "Q: And what does the -- can you describe a little bit more about the situation in the\nvillage? Was there, for instance, some kind of Jewish community? Did you have contact\nwith Jewish neighbors?",
        "A: Oh yes, we go out with the Jewish people, we had some people, Jewish people in our\nvillage, and also there was a -- a little city by the name Struchin, and that was, I should\nsay, 50 percent Jewish population, in that city, and we was very close with the Jewish\npeople.",
        "Q: Now, when you went to Tarnow, that was a larger city, right?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "Q: And you became a dishwasher in a --",
        "A: I started as a di-dishwasher. See, you gotta start somehow, somewhere. And I started,\nbut I didn\u2019t stay too long ba -- in a elegant, Jewish restaurant, there was a club, 300\nmembers they had, and had all rich Jewish people belong as members there. But I didn\u2019t\nstay too long there, and my idea was to learn something, and I go to the bakery and I\nbecome a bakery apprentice.",
        "Q: And you stayed there for about two years and then the German invaded Poland?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And the bakery was closed, and you had to go back to the village and to your mother,\nright?",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: You said in the -- in the videotaped interview that the Germans started pretty much\nright away arresting and executing Jews.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You mention an incident there where Jewish people that you know were also rounded\nup and -- and -- and shot. Did you witness that yourself?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t witness, but I was there close, I was -- matter of fact, I was in that\nStruchin, that was Struchin. On a videotape they put a drawing, you know,\n[indecipherable] no, this is -- that was in Struchin, was just a two, three kilometer away,\nyou know, little city. And that was a -- quite a -- quite a Jewish population, and those\nJewish, we used to do business, we used to buy from those Jewish people, they have\nbusinesses, and we know those Jewish -- those Jewish people, see? Like for instance, one\ncabinet maker, and o-other -- the other one was -- sa -- had a tobacco business. And\nanother one was photog -- photographer. I remember his name, he was-- name was\nPlushnik. And that was a day when the Germans come to that town. There was a special\noutfit, German outfit, SS, and they rounded up those Jewish people, just pull them out,\nyou know, they would -- whoever they can catch them. And I believe that was 20 sener --\nseven, 27 Jewish people. They -- they bring them to the park there, not far away from that\nchurch, they give them the shovels, picks -- picks and shovels, they dig out the graves for\nthemself, and they shot them. And that was awful scare and the Germans told u -- told us\n-- told the Polish people, you gonna be the next. And that was very scary.",
        "Q: But this particular incident you did not see it, just of -- you heard about it, right?",
        "A: I di -- I didn\u2019t see it on own -- in my own eyes.",
        "Q: Did you see anything that was directed against the Polish population?",
        "A: Oh -- oh yes, oh yes, there was quite a few Polish people arrested, same time. First\nthey go a-after intelligentsia, like teachers, you know. And they was arrested, many fact\nfrom Tarnow. That was their first transport to Auschwitz, to the concentration camp, first\ntransport. That was strictly Polish people, professors, teachers, you know, all kind of\nintelligentsia, you know. That was -- I believe that was 170 some the intelligentsia.",
        "Q: I just have to get the microphone a little bit further away, so --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- yeah, that should do. Do you know when that was, roughly, with the first transport\nwith Polish people?",
        "A: I believe this is right after they build out that concentration camp, yeah, yeah. So the\nJewish people who come to the concentration camp Auschwitz come later, but the first\nprisoner was the Polish teachers and professionals, you know, and priests.",
        "Q: Did you -- did you and your mother talk about the situation, what to do, or did you just\nkind of wait?",
        "A: We just wait, and gosh, you know, we were scared and you didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going\nto happen to you, see? Because we didn't know -- we didn\u2019t know what the Germans\ngoing to do to us, see? That was pretty rough, though.",
        "Q: And when the Polish army receded, drew ba -- withdrew while the Germans came 1n,\nthere was -- weaponry was left?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And you happened to -- to find a gun and you decided to keep it, although at that time\nthe German orders were pretty clear about what would happen. I mean, Polish citizens\nwere supposed to deliver all the weapons to the Germans, or there was a death sentence if\nthey didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: My -- my question would be, why did you decide to keep it?",
        "A: Oh my gosh, I was going through the woods, and I see something on the side, you\nknow, a -- a fresh leafs, you know, and this some -- you know something is there. So I go\nthere and I -- I -- I move the leafs you know, and I see beautiful, brand new rifle. So, I\ntake it. I took it and I bring it home, and I put him in a -- in a barn. I hide him in a -- ina\nhay. But, same time, somebody saw me. And you know, people are people. People talk.\nAnd somebody make a denunciation on me to the chief of police, and he was a -- he was\na German. Eventually, you know, they called me, and they told me to bring the rifle.",
        "Q: So you kept it, di -- why -- but actually why did you keep it? Because, I mean, you\nwere young, you were a young --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- boy, a young man at that point.",
        "A: Foolish.",
        "Q: Did you -- but did you think it would be useful for you to [indecipherable]",
        "A: I didn't think really about that, but just to ha-have an beautiful rifle, you know. Maybe\ngo hunting.",
        "Q: Was -- was that sort of -- how did you feel about a Polish -- a fellow Polish person\ngoing to the Germans, though, and denouncing you? I mean, was that something --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how this happened, that I can answer these questions, see, because you\nknow, you never know, you never know. But I know that was how they find out, see?\nSomebody must say something.",
        "Q: So and then you were brought to the Gestapo in Linz, and you were interrogated?",
        "A: No, first --",
        "Q: Oh, no, no, no, I\u2019m sorry, you were what -- but you were brought to the -- the --",
        "A: -- fir --",
        "Q: -- the Gestapo",
        "A: -- first their chief, his name was Vanline. Many people know that name from my area\nwhere I come from, you know. He was -- he was a tough guy. He speak fluently Polish.\nMatter of fact, before the war, he was a engineer there, from the bridge there -- they was\nbuild up the bridge. He was a engineer, but at the same time he was a spy, he was\nworking for Germans. And then, after the Germans come, he become the commandant of\nthat police station there. So he questioned me. Did you bring your rifle? Which -- and I\nsays, no, I haven\u2019t got no rifle. Yes, you have. You know, and this, and this, and this and\nthen they beat me pretty bad, you know. Yeah. Himself, you know, gave me 25 on my\nrear end, and there was two other guys, you know, they beat me too. Then I was lucky\nbecause the people from the village come to him and they say I am innocent. I was\nworking in a bakery and I had a good record, you know, I was clean. And he changed the\nmind, and he says, yeah, on one condition. We let you go, but Wednesday we gonna\nrecruit in some young people for Germany to work. Now, why don\u2019t you be there, and\nyou go Germany, and you be -- going to be more safe in Germany than here. He told me\nso. So me and friend of mine and few others, we go Wednesday there, we registered\nthere, and they put us on a train and we go, who knows where we go, what\u2019s going to\nhappen. That was very hard for me, that early in the morning, to say good-bye to my\nmother.",
        "Q: But then you did not go to Germany after all, you were brought to Austria --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- at this time to Linz. Did you ever find out why that happened?",
        "A: Well, at that time they needed young people on the farms, in the -- in the factories, and\nhappen our transport, that was -- they pick up some more in Tarnow, in Krakow, they\npick up more, more people, young people. And happened that -- that this transport go to\nAustria [indecipherable] Czechoslovakia, and -- at that time, and Vienna, and from\nVienna, Linz [indecipherable] yeah, and from Linz we go to the farms, say -- me, and\nfriend of mine.",
        "Q: And so, at the unemployment office then, there were farmers waiting for the help to\ncome, and one of them waiting was your wife-to-be, your future wife, Frieda, and you\nwent to her parent\u2019s farm.",
        "A: This is a -- a really coincident, and a good coincident, I should say. Good and bad and\ngood. Yes. So we was pick up by the young, blonde lady. She was that time what, 18 - 19\nyears old. Because, actually, her father\u2019s supposed to come. Her father was a big farmer\nthere. But he catch cold, for some reason he couldn\u2019t go, so he sent Frieda. Frieda was his\nfavorite daughter, you know, he love her. And Frieda pick us up, me and friend of mine\nby the name Frank.",
        "Q: And then at that farm you had to work very hard, but apparently you had meals at the\ntable with the family, the food was plentiful, the food was good. How did you feel\nthough, towards the situation? I mean, it was forced labor after all. Did you feel\nresentment towards -- towards the -- the parents in any way?",
        "A: Oh, oh, I -- I can\u2019t complain, because number one, they treat us very, very good. They\n-- Greinegger, that\u2019s the name of the -- of that -- her father, Greinegger family, they treat\nus good. They feed us -- we eat by the same table with the whole family. Would you\nbelieve we had five meals every day? And we had meat every day. And when you figure\nth-that was a war time, people in the city was living on a -- on a -- what you call? Ona\ncards, you know? Just so much. We had plenty food. But also we work, on a farm you\nknow, that was a hard work, but we don\u2019t mind.",
        "Q: And then you grew -- because you also worked with Frieda on the -- on the -- on the\nfields, and whatever had to be done there, you grew a little closer. You got to know each\nother just a little bit, I mean, under very difficult conditions. And then one day you said\nthat you asked her whether you could listen to the radio --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- on -- actually, it\u2019s not in your story, but I think it is 1n -- it -- it\u2019s definitely in your\nwitfe\u2019s story, that you asked her whether you could listen to the radio because you didn\u2019t\nknow much was happening in the world, and that was also very forbidden, wasn\u2019t it?",
        "A: Her father had a special room that he had a little office over there, and on the wall you\ncan see all those rifles, you know, and that 1s because he was a -- he had this hunting area\nthere. For a hundred years there was the hunting license in that house. And there was a\nradio in that time, yeah. And when everybody goes sleep, you know, Frieda opened the\ndoor, you know, and let me listen to the radio. So 10 o\u2019clock in the evening there was a\nvery interesting news in Poland -- in Polish from England. And that was very interesting.\nAnd somebody hear this, somebody find out that -- I don\u2019t know how the Gestapo find\nout about that [indecipherable]. That was one reason.",
        "Q: Somebody must have seen you, right?",
        "A: Could be, yeah.",
        "Q: But that did not -- but -- but -- but you still could stay on the farm, or -- you -- you\nwere not immediately brought to -- to the Gestapo?",
        "A: No, no, no, no.",
        "Q: But then after awhile you got a little too close with Frieda for father\u2019s taste, because it\nwas a dangerous situation, so he gave you an ultimatum basically. He brought you into\nthe room and he said that one of you would have to go.",
        "A: Oh that -- that happened after -- now tha -- we gotta go back little bit, see, like\n[indecipherable]. So, we was working altogether. There was four daughters, you know,\nhe -- Mr. Greinegger had four daughters and one son. And one of the daughter, by the\nname Frieda, that\u2019s the same Frieda pick us up in the -- you know, when we come from\nthe transport. And happen that winter we was working in the woods, because they had --\nthey had, I don\u2019t know, about 20 acres woods, so we got the woods for the -- for the use -\n- for the house use, and they had for sale, okay. And it happened we work in the -- we\nwork in the woods, then we work on the farm. And it happened we -- we come -- me and\nFrieda, we come closer and closer. We was very friendly to each other, see? She was a\nbeautiful, beautiful blonde. And they say I was good looking too, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not\nsure about that.",
        "Q: You still are, I think.",
        "A: Thank you. So, it gets closer and closer til agains -- that was too much. So the father\nthat time called Frieda and he had a speech with her. And he says, \u201cYou come too close\nwith Julian, and you know this is against the law. You know what\u2019s going to happen to\nyou. You know what\u2019s going to happen to him. And who knows what a g -- what\u2019s going\nto happen to us. This is against the law to have anything to do with a foreigner.\u201d And he\nwas right. Yeah. So he was pretty tough, first time as she can remember, and she slap her\nover the -- on her face, you know, slapped her, yeah. And she was crying. Then after that\nhe called me. And he had a speech to me, yeah. And he told me absolutely this is against\nthe law. You -- you can -- you can\u2019t have anything to do with my daughter anyway. So\none of you gotta go. Which one? And for some reason Frieda want to go. And she want to\n-- she want me to stay on the -- on the farm. He says, that\u2019s up to you. You want to go,\nokay, and Julian stay on this farm. And that\u2019s what happened.",
        "Q: Wh-When -- when we talk about being close, what -- what did that really mean? I\nmean, you did not speak Austrian -- German -- Austrian in -- very much, she didn\u2019t speak\nPolish. What did you talk about? I mean, closeness, what did -- what did that really\nmean?",
        "A: Oh, you\u2019d be surprised when you -- when you like somebody how fast you learn --\nhow fast you learn that language. And I -- I knew some words from -- from the school,\nyou know, and didn\u2019t take me long. Matter of fact, in a -- in a -- in a year I pick up about\noh, I should say 70 percent German language. What is -- Austrian language is German\nlanguage, just a different -- different dialect, you see. So we a -- we like each other, let\u2019s\nput it this way.",
        "Q: Was it surprising to you though, that Frieda decided to leave?",
        "A: Frieda, yeah. She decided, yeah. And she went. And that was -- that was unusual see,\nbecause there was a such a big farm, so many acres land and everything, you know, was\nplenty work, you know, but one of us gotta go. They want to split us. Doesn\u2019t matter who\ngoes, who stays. So happened she goes to another farm, quite a ways from that place. But\nwe make a promise, you know, the first Sunday we\u2019re going to meet by the church there\nin that town where she was working.",
        "Q: Let -- let me -- let me just ask you a little -- little tiny thing here.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: I think in your story I realized that you seemed to indicate a little bit that Frieda asked\nyou, and in Frieda\u2019s story, in your wife\u2019s story, I always had a little feeling that -- that\nyou asked her. So, who -- who asked -- wh-who made that -- who made the decision to --\nyou kind of agreed that you would see each other, or who --",
        "A: Well, this happened -- we -- really, that\u2019s a tough question, you know. We don\u2019t know\nhow this happened, see? You can\u2019t tell with the friendshi -- where -- where the friendship\nbegin, where that ends and where the love starts, you know? It\u2019s hard to -- to say it, see?\nBut we like -- we like each other so much, so we don\u2019t want to be split. We want to meet\neach other and we want to continue. And that\u2019s probably what we\u2019re falling in love, that\ntime.",
        "Q: So you stayed on -- on her f -- on the large -- on the big farm with Frieda\u2019s parents and\nshe went to another, smaller farm -- I don\u2019t quite remember, about 15 kilometers, or sort\nof not too far away.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you decided to see each other. But then somebody found out about it and\ndenounced you, right?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Do you know who -- what kind of person that was?",
        "A: We had pretty close 1-1dea, but we -- we can\u2019t be assure for 100 percent, but anyway,\nanyway, again, you got some people, they say everything, you know, and they make a\ndenunciation. So one s -- that was Saturday evening, I drive -- I go see Frieda and I -- I\nthi -- finding in that place where we should meet. Then after that I find out she was\narrested, after. So they come in and ar-arrest me -- Gestapo -- police, you know, and the\npolice delivered me to the Gestapo in Linz.",
        "Q: Before you go one from there, let me just ask you one more question. How long,\nroughly, did you stay at her parent\u2019s farm? How -- how long -- wh-what kind of time are\nwe talking about?",
        "A: Til November. November 1940, I think. We was arrested first time, right?",
        "Q: So that was about what, like a half a year or a year?",
        "A: No, that was almost a year.",
        "Q: Almost a year, now?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And then you were interrogated again, but --",
        "A: 11 days.",
        "Q: 11 days.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: But they decided to -- to let you go, and to send you to a different -- to different --",
        "A: They interrogate me and Frieda, and Frieda says no, there was nothing between us,\njust friendship, and same thing I -- I -- I was saying. See, because we agree, you know, in\ncase we got caught, you know, we should say there was nothing. Actually was nothing,\nsee, besides you know, we lo -- we love each other, you know, and -- and -- a-and this.\nAnd so they, after 11 days they let me go. That was on Friday, November 1940.",
        "Q: But [indecipherable] I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That was a --",
        "A: And they didn't lay a hand on me, they -- they -- they were tough, you know, they ask\ntough question you know, and they look at me straight in eyes, you know, and then the\nchief says, well, I think he tell us the truth. Okay, we let him go. But, before you go, here\nis the paper and you read this. That was in German on one side, and that was in Polish,\nfor anything to do, the bottom line, anything to do with German or Austrian women for\nthe Auslander -- for the foreigner, death sentence, to hanging. And he says, okay, sign\nyour name. So I did sign my name. And they gave -- and then they let me go back to\nFrieda\u2019s father to pick up my belongings, and they already sent -- they had a address, and\nthey send me to another farmer. Little smaller, but also nice people. Different direction.\nSo on Monday, okay, on Monday in the morning they call Frieda and they tell her, okay,\nyou free, but you sign some paper. And the same paper, she signed what I signed Friday,\nokay? Tha -- but they say -- I don\u2019t know what this says on -- on -- on that. Well, she read\nthe same thing, you know, death sentence, you know, for anything to have -- to do with a\nGerman woman. So you wouldn\u2019t believe, you know, by coincident I go Friday there to\nFrieda\u2019s father, the farm, pick up my belonging and stay over Saturday and Sunday, and\nMonday morning I take the train and come back to Linz. And that Monday morning\nFrieda was going free. And you wouldn\u2019t believe, I was waiting for my train going in a\ndirection and I walk, I don\u2019t know what I was thinking, and come head on to Frieda. I\nthought this is impossible, but I was very happy to see. So we go on the side quick, we\nexchanged the addresses. She go for another farm. They didn\u2019t send her home, no,\nanother farm. A small -- really small farm, they needed her, and she go there. And again\nwe make a agreement that we -- that first Sunday [indecipherable] first Sunday, we gonna\nmeet there somewhere halfway between li -- Velz and Gunskiha -- oh, Velz and Linz on\nthe Auterstrassen.",
        "Q: I think this 1s a good time to change the cassette here. This 1s the end of tape one, side\nA interview with Julian Noga. This is a --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nJulian Noga. This is tape number one, side B. So, you both worked on different farms\nnow, but you still decided to see each other.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: But once again you got, eventually, denounced by the farmer. Frieda\u2019s farmer at first\nknew about it but decided not to say anything, but when she decided to give up the job on\nthat farm to take another job, he decided to -- to announce you to the -- to the SS, to the\nGestapo.",
        "A: Exactly, that\u2019s what happened.",
        "Q: Yeah. And so this time what -- then what happened? You were -- both of -- both of\nyou were arrested, and you had to stay in -- in jail for quite a long time this time, wasn't\nit?",
        "A: Yes. First Frieda was arrested, and when I went there and she didn\u2019t show up wher --\nwhere she\u2019s supposed to show up, you know, where we meet. Then I had a bad\nconscience or how shou -- bad feeling something might happen, because we were\nsupposed to meet. Then on September 19, on that farm where I was working, their name\nwas Prosmueller, that was on either side of Linz between Linz and Vienna, just a -- oh,\nabout four or five kilometer from the very well known concentration camp Mauthausen.\nAnd that day, on that day, that was again Friday. Friday is a bad day for me. Was, at\nleast. And we was -- before noon we was digging potatoes there on that farm, and I was\nworking with that -- with the horses, yeah, and we come for lunch, and as we was eating\nlunch, from the -- the other side of the kitchen, somebody walk in, see? Then we hear the\nconversation. And what I hear, oh he\u2019s very good, he\u2019s very hard working, yeah, he 1s\nnice man, oh, yes, yes. That\u2019s what they say. And that was a policeman. So after he\nquestioned -- because the -- the -- the farmer, and the -- and the parents, they was eating\nin the kitchen, we was eating in the dining room, see? Then, after awhile, we just almost\nfinished lunch, and that policeman come to the dining room and says, Julius Noga, I have\nto bring you to the Gestapo, to the Linz. He says, I have to bring you to the Linz. I says,\nGestapo? He says yes. When I hear that word Gestapo, I know -- I already knew it 1s\nGestapo. I says, oh God. Good-bye. He says, okay, you change your clothes, take\nwhatever you need like toothbrush and soap, when you had, whatever, you know, take it\nwith you, and you come with me. So we go on a station, regular station and we take the\ntrain. That was only 16 kilometer to Linz. So what was very hard for me to say good-bye\nto this wonderful family, you know? They took me as their own. They had two children,\na little girl, Minnie, she was about eight years old, and Francel, he was about 10 - 11\nyears old. And the children was there, and he ask me, \u201cJulian, where you going?\u201d I says,\n\u201cWell I have to go on Linz.\u201d \u201cWhat for?\u201d I says, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cAre you be back?\u201d I\nsays, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cOh, come on, Julian,\u201d you know? Break my heart, cause those\nchildren were so nice. And the farmer come and says, \u201cJulian, you have to go. Gosh,\nwhat did you do?\u201d I says, \u201c\u201cN-Not much.\u201d \u201cWell, I gonna help you all I can, okay?\u201d So\nthe policeman was good to me, I says well, okay, ha -- I gotta finish with my horses, see,\nI take care of the horses, I gotta give them water, I gotta give them some hay, you know?\nHe says, go ahead, do it, yeah, okay, we got time. So I say good-bye to my horses. Such a\nbig, beautiful, shiny horses, oh my gosh. That was a break -- a heartbreak. And there was\na French war prisoner Louie, and I want to talk to Louie because I know he gonna take\ncare of the horses, so I told Louie, Louie -- he understand pretty good German, I says,\ntake care of those horses, they are very nice horses, you know? Don\u2019t beat them, never\nbeat them, you know. Treat them good, work with them slow, don\u2019t rush them, you\nknow. Take care of them. He says, I will, I will. So I say good-bye to horses and to\neverybody, so we go. Policeman had a -- a bicycle, so we walked to the station just a\nkilometer and a half, two kilom -- not even two kilometers. Then we were ou -- then he\ncome to the ma -- where they sell the tickets, and there was a man, and -- yeah. And for\nthat man, each morning he had a -- yeah, each morning I bring some milk, see? He was\nthe -- he was the regular old man, you know, high ranking, and -- and he said -- the police\nask him question because that was forbidden for Polish people to ride the tran -- train. So\nhe asked, did you sell any tickets to this man here? And I was behind that policeman, and\nhe look at me, and I -- I just make a motion no. And he says, no, I never sell him no\ntickets. Oh, good. So he put a [indecipherable] the tickets, or how many times he sell me\nthe tickets, but he was a very nice man. His name was Schattsinger. Okay, so the train\ncome, and I was standing there, and I was thinking, my gosh, you know, should I fall on\nthe track, you know, and let the train go over me, you know, because I know this time it\u2019s\ngoing to be tough, and I know what I gonna get it.",
        "Q: You -- you -- you talked a -- you told that story in a -- on the videotape, so maybe we\ncan just summarize a little bit by saying that you -- you spent what, 11 months, or quite a\nlong time in jail. You tried to get out of jail, that was prevented. They found out about\nyour attempt to break out, and eventually you were sent to -- to the concentration camp\nFlossenburg.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: I would like to ask you a few questions about Flossenbirg, if that\u2019s all right?",
        "A: Okay, fine.",
        "Q: One of the interrogating SS men there, asked you during the early time, when you had\njust arrived, whether you knew why you were sent to the concentration camp.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you said, because of your relations to an Austrian girl.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And he indicated that that was not so, but that you were there for revenge purposes\ntoo, to pay back, I believe you said, you p-payback for the German soldiers killed in\nPoland in Begost?",
        "A: Bidgast.",
        "Q: In Bidgast.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you ever find out whether that was the real reason, wh-whether that was really\ntrue? That seems to be a different --",
        "A: I think that was his personal opinion, you know, probably he lost his friend or\nsomebody there in Bidgast, that was -- that was big outbreak, before the war start over\nthere. And probably he take advantage and tell me this in [indecipherable] you know, you\nhere for those German soldier got killed in Bidgast. That -- I was surprised, you know, I -\n- I don\u2019t even knew that time where is Bidgast, as far away from our place where we was\nliving.",
        "Q: Tell us a little bit more about who was there in this concentration camp, where it was a\nstone quarry, where you had to work very hard cutting stones. What -- what was the\npopulation of that camp?",
        "A: That time when I arrived, it was on a August, I believe August third in 1942. That was\na small population I should say, not quite 2,000. And my number I -- I received my\nnumber, I don\u2019t know if that number 1s right or not, 1623, that is my number.",
        "Q: And what were the nationalities? I mean, you were Polish, were there also Jewish\nprisoners, were there Austrian German prisoners, what was [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh yes, that was about 17 - 18 different nationalities in that concentration camp. And\nactually the oldest prisoners was Austrian and German. Actually, 1938, that Austrians\nprisoners, and German, they build up that concentration camp. There was no other --\nother nationalities than the first. After they build up that concentration camp, I believe the\nfirst prisoners come from Czechoslovakia. Then, naturally come from Poland and o-other\ncountries.",
        "Q: Were people treated differently depending on where they came from?",
        "A: Maybe that was just a little differences between like French prisoners, English -- we\nhad some English prisoners, too. Matter of fact, two Americans pilot, they was killed\nthere, in Flossenburg. They run away from a stalag, from a regular war prisoners camp,\nand they was caught by Flossenbiirg and they was brought to Flossenburg, and after their\nquestioning, they was executed, those two American pilots, and they\u2019re in a death valley\nin Flossenbirg, they got the ledge, and American flag, and you can read on that ledge -- it\nis a big ledge, you know, six feet long and about 36 inches wide, about eight inches high,\nyou know? And that was founded by Polish people, that ledge, Polish prisoners. And\nsays, two Americans, unknown. But I remember when they was brought to the\nconcentration camp, and I remember when they was questioned, yeah. And when you\nread those -- you got those ledges, about 17 or 18 in the death valley, you go from one to\nthe other one, then you see how many people die, losted their life in that concentration\ncamp in Flossenburg. You start with the Russian, over 25, 000. The next one gonna be\nPolish ledge, same size as the American ledge, you know, over 17,000. Then you got the\nFrench, then you got the Czechoslovak ledges, you know, 3,000 - 4,000 French,\nCzechoslovak, Italians. And -- and before you go any further before that you got a\nGerman ledge, and says exactly I want to say 5,969. Something like that. Almost 6,000\nGerman people losted their life -- German prisoners losted their life there. That was a\ntough, tough concentration camp. When you are in, there was not much differences, you\nknow. We was treated almost -- almost the same.",
        "Q: Were there Jewish prisoners, too?",
        "A: Yes, that was about -- 1t says on the -- on the -- on a board somewhere, and on a\nchimney, cremation chimney, it says 3,335 Jewish people lost their life in Flossenbirg.\nYes, they was there from Poland, from Hungary, from different -- German, Jewish too,\nfrom Germany.",
        "Q: Were they treated differently at all?",
        "A: They was treated bad. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And they was working, you know, they\ngive them the -- the hardest work, you know. There was Russian, Jewish people, and\nPolish people was treating the worst.",
        "Q: You did, in your videotaped interviews, speak about a German prisoner, Hans Bauer,\nwho -- who had saved your life, twice I believe --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- you speak very highly of him.",
        "A: More than twice.",
        "Q: More than twice. We don\u2019t have to say that over again, but was there -- w-were there\nother incidents where it wasn\u2019t quite so black and white as one sometimes seems to think,\nwhere other people helped you, who were maybe also German, or other nationalities?",
        "A: Well, Hans Bauer was German, you know, but he -- if he -- if he died, God give him\nheaven. He saved me so many times, not only twice, so many times, because we come in\nfriends in Munich when we stay over the night there, and I even [indecipherable] his\ncigarettes, and he was a heavy smoker. And he says, \u201cOkay, thank you, I can keep this --\nthat bag?\u201d I says, \u201cKeep it, because I got another one.\u201d And he says, \u201cOkay, you are a\ngood fellow, I remember this.\u201d Okay, and later on he become kapo -- foreman, you know,\nand many times he -- he had me, you know, I -- and -- and I was so glad, you know? I\ncounted the -- once I fall in a -- well, the -- the -- th-the main kapo -- kapo in -- ina\ngranite quarry caught me during the work, you know, and I was smoking. You not\nsupposed to smoke for 12 hours when you work there in the quarry, so -- so he gave me\nshtaffkommando, what is shtaffkommando?",
        "Q: It\u2019s a punishment --",
        "A: Outfit.",
        "Q: -- outfit, yeah.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Now, in that punishment outfit you can\u2019t last more than 30 days, you know,\nthen you com -- either you commit suicide or they kill you, you know? And I, thanks\nGod, you know, I was there seven or eight days, then one evening I saw Hans Bauer and I\ntold him, I\u2019m in a shtaffkommando. He says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you told me sooner? Okay,\ntomorrow morning you -- you go with my outfit to the quarry.\u201d So next day I go, and a\nkapo from the other kommando, shtaffkommando, he come and says, \u201cHey, you not\nbelong over here, come on. You belong to me.\u201d Hans Bauer come to him, \u201cNevermind,\nhe stay with me.\u201d Oh. He was surprised you know, but you know, those kapos between\nthemselves they don\u2019t want to fight, you know\u201d? So I was lucky that time, he saved my\nlife ri -- right there.",
        "Q: What -- what -- what about the guards and SS authorities there, was there different\nkinds of -- of treatment, too?",
        "A: Of course. There was some, not all of them was bad. There was some people like we\nare too, you know. There was some -- was some bad ones, and also good ones. And we\ndidn\u2019t fright too much SS. What we was frightened, the kapos because they want to show\nthe SS how good they are, they no have to work, you know, they just you know, had a\nbetter food, you know, plenty food, you know, and of course you know, hey kapos, you\ngotta be careful with the kapos.",
        "Q: Did you ever lose faith while you were there? I -- I believe you were brought up\nCatholic, right?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Was it -- was a strong -- was it a religious family, could one say that, or was it not so\nstrong?",
        "A: Ah, y-yes. Hans Bauer helped me because I told Hans Bauer several times, tomorrow I\ngo commit suicide, I go on the barbed wire, you know, and they gonna shoot me, you\nknow, I -- just a couple minutes you know, and I gonna go. [indecipherable] he call me\ncrazy, you crazy he says. No, that\u2019s the easiest way, you know. No, no, no, no, no, don\u2019t\ndo that. So he -- he helped me. Now, that was a time, especial that was so hard, you\nknow, before big holidays gonna come, you know, like Christmas, Easter, you know, one\nChristmas, second Christmas, third Christmas and you still there. And you ask yourself,\nmy gosh, what I did? I didn\u2019t steal, I didn\u2019t kill, you know? Because I loved someone?\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here and I\u2019m mixed up with those people over here? And sometime you -\n- when you see those execution almost every day, every other day they hang somebody,\nand they had big speeches, then you hear those shots every morning before six o\u2019clock in\ndeath valley, then in the evening. Then you hear some shots at night, there by the\ncrematorium, you know, the black wagon come with some kind of people, go straight to\nthe crematorium, and you hear just a shotgun, you know? You hear -- you hear those\nshots, you know? So today people says, gosh, you know, some people disappeared, and\nmany families, they don\u2019t know how they disappeared. That was to Flossenbiirg what\nthey disappeared. And sometime -- sometime you -- you start to believe -- you start --\nstop to believe if the God is right. I says no. God can\u2019t see this, you know. And God --\nhow God let this happen? Then next time, you -- you cry, you pray, God forgive me.\nGod, I love you. Please help me. Is so hard, you know, h-how you -- once you ready to\ndie, you know, you no believe in nothing, you know the next time my gosh, maybe --\nmaybe po -- by some kind of coincident like Hans Bauer, many times he told me, maybe\nthis gonna be some occasion, you know. Maybe we gonna be free someday. See? We ga -\n- but, on the other hand, have all kind of professors, you know, all smart people,\npolitician and this and this, and on Sunday afternoon I like to hear what they say, you\nknow? I learned lots from them. And they say the one thing what they did to us, they not\ngonna let us free. Before the Americans or Russian, whoever come first, before they\ncome in, they gonna kill us all. So they gonna, how should I say [indecipherable] --",
        "Q: Erase.",
        "A: -- the evidence.",
        "Q: Erase the evidence.",
        "A: Erase the evidence, you know, no witnesses. And that was possible, and that -- that --\nthat happened in -- in some other concentration camp, that what I hear.",
        "Q: Julian, how long did you stay? How much -- how long did you stay in Flossenbtrg?",
        "A: Well, that was when I -- A-August third, 1942, til the end, til April 23\", I never forget\nthat -- that date. Is a lucky number.",
        "Q: And then the camp was evacuated and you were all taken on a death march to -- to\nDachau.",
        "A: Dachau.",
        "Q: But before you reached Dachau actually, you were liberated by the American army, by\nPatton\u2019s third army, actually.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: What was your health and your mental state at that point?",
        "A: Oh, you see, th-those -- since Friday, when -- when we marched til Monday at noon,\nwe was freed. They not give us nothing to eat except I think on Sunday they gave us a --\njust a little slice of bread. No coffee, no water, nothing. So we had no food, and we gotta\nmarch so many hours. Sometime they let us r-rest for three or four hours, in no time we\nmarch again. So, when you\u2019re hungry and thirsty, how -- how you can march? So among\nthe -- the -- from my column, what was almost 2,000 prisoners, there was just half of that\nleft. And I tell you the truth, I was prepared to die, because I was -- I was so weak, you\nknow, and each step hurts, you know, and -- I -- I-I-I was -- I was dizzy, you know, and\ngosh, you know, but, since in the morning I hear the machine guns in behind, I hear the --\nwe hear that noise, you know, and we understand that the -- that the Americans come,\nyou know? So you fight and you -- you -- you get your strength, the last strength you got,\nyou know, to last as long as possible, you know. And we did it. Gosh, you know, 12\no\u2019clock, at noon, the first tanks -- American tank I saw. First I was mixed up, you know,\nbecause I see the big white star on their tank, I thought they are Russians. But soon we\nfind out they are Americans. And that was, I believe, 90\" or 97\" division of that army,\nGeneral George Patton, God give him heaven, George Patton, General George Patton. He\nis my, how should I say, he saved my life.",
        "Q: What -- what -- what happened then? Could you recuperate in some way? Could -- di -\n- did you get food? Did you get sent into where? What happened afterwards?",
        "A: About 10 o\u2019clock, before noon, we passed a little town by the name Shtamserit. It was\nin Bavaria [indecipherable]. And then when we was free, we go back to that little city.\nAnd right away, the American takes -- take care of us, you know? They open a kitchen,\nthey feed us, they give us cigarettes. And the American, thanks to them, many of them\nsacrificed their life, but also many there save our lives. So I appreciate it very much.\nThanks to all of them.",
        "Q: Wh-When you were a little stronger, did you go back to Poland? Did you know\nanything about your mother at that point?",
        "A: Ah --",
        "Q: I should -- I should also say -- we should also say that before the outbreak of the war,\nyour three brothers, who were also in Poland, went back, had been gone ba -- had gone\nback to --",
        "A: United States.",
        "Q: -- to United States --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- again, so it was -- your mother was back in Poland. Did you know anything about\nher?",
        "A: Yes, wa -- I-I wrote her a letter once awhile, then I received some letters from my\nmother, and so -- also my mother send me some packages once in awhile. You know,\nbread and onions and little bit pork, you know, whatever, yeah. Yeah, so I know my --\nmy mother was still alive, but after I recuperated, after three weeks, the American officer\ngave me a bicycle and then I pedal to Austria to see my lovely girl. I was -- now, I -- I\nwas anxious to see her, you know, and how she lives, you know, and whether she gonna\ntake me back. So -- so I eat that time, from the first day I eat. So I starts slowly, you\nknow, you can\u2019t overeat it. But after awhile, you know, I eat day and night, wherever I\ncan find the food, you know, I eat. So I was strong enough after three weeks, and I pedal\nto Austria. First I come to a friend of mine, another friend, Eddie. I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t have\nenough guts, you know, go by myself to Frieda\u2019s father farm, you know? So I took with\nme Eddie, friend of mine. And then that was on Saturday, May 18, 1945, how can I\nforget? And was eight o\u2019clock at night. We come to the front door, ring the bell, and\nFrieda\u2019s sister Teresa come out. And when she saw me she s-start screaming, Julius,\nJulius is here. Frieda was sitting on the back porch, you know, when she hear that name\nshe couldn\u2019t believe it, you know, that\u2019s me. She was thinking, you know I -- I was dead,\nyou know, because they -- they -- they -- they hear, you know, what they was doing in the\nconcentration camp, by their evacuation, and she had pretty good idea from Ravensbrick,\nyou know, how that treatment was, see? So she hoped, but she wasn\u2019t sure whether I\u2019m\nstill alive or not.",
        "Q: So, the parents decided to let you stay on the farm, or what -- what -- what happens?",
        "A: No, I -- I didn't want to stay on that farm, but I stayed just a little on the other side of\nthe woods, you know, with my friend Eddie. And that was nice people you know, they let\nme stay, they give me a room, you know? I| stayed there and then we have Red Cross, and\nthe American UNRRA we call that, you know, they -- they give us packages, you know,\nand food, you know, cigarettes and the Americans take of us good, you know?",
        "Q: Maybe this is another good way to end this side here. This 1s the end of tape one, side\nB, interview with Julian Noga.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nJulian Noga. This is tape number two, side A. So you had come back to -- to the farm or\nto the village where Frieda lived?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And you found housing somewhere, some Austrian people that you stayed there, with\nyour friend?",
        "A: Yeah, I stay with my friend a-and just not far away from Frieda\u2019s parents.",
        "Q: And you began to see Frieda again?",
        "A: Every day.",
        "Q: What was the reas -- reaction by -- from her parents? How did they feel about it, di --",
        "A: Well, the -- they knew what we was going through and they -- they was -- they were\nnot against us, you know, they understand, you know. They a -- actually, they understand\nwe belong together.",

        "A: With -- the village there by Frieda\u2019s parents? Well, I didn\u2019t have so much contact with\n-- with those Austrians there. They were friendly, and I don\u2019t know what they was\nthinking about me, but Frieda was, you know, in a different position, see, wi -- number\none, she was from a rich family. And the small village knows, you know, she was in a\nconcentration camp, why she was there, they know. So that time, you know, you come to\nthe small village like that where the people know each other, you know, and this -- it\u2019s\nlittle bit sensitive, let\u2019s put it this way. So Frieda go through something, you know,\ndifferent. To me it didn\u2019t make much difference.",
        "Q: How did you -- how did you live at that time? You got assistance from Americans\nstill, or did your par -- did her parents help you, or how did that work?",
        "Q: Red Cross, and the organization -- American organization UNRRA, we call them that.\nAnd you had some places, charity places you know, and they take care of those people.\nOh, right away they used to have those houses, and barracks you know, the Germans\nworker was living before. And they put those people in a -- again, in a camp, but different\ntype camp, you know. They had a good kitchen, good food. So sometime we go there. I --\nI didn\u2019t live -- I live only about two months in a camp like that, you know, for the\nrefugees, camp for the refu -- refugees, but I didn\u2019t like that. So many people together,\nyou know, that\u2019s reminds me, you know? That\u2019s the same thing what I was going through\nthree years, or so -- so I go and live private and I look for the job.

        "Q: And then you deci --",
        "A: -- get married. There was no other way, see? The -- the only thing is, gonna be a little\nbit hard, you know, because I have to face her father and ask him, and I did.

So I didn\u2019t take a chance, but an --\nafter 1960, I decided, for good or for bad, I decided to go and see my mother. That was\nexactly 21 years when I saw her last time. And that was at Christmastime, shortly before\nChristmas, and that was the nicest Christmas for me and for my mother to see each other,\nand she was so happy to see me.

Before we come, we stay in a -- in a -- ina --\nwe was waiting for -- for visa and -- and the American, they teach us -- they tell us, you\nknow, what is that -- what kind of a life we\u2019re gonna have in a -- America. You got all\nkind of opportunity, 1f you want to work, if you want to save, you can be millionaire, if\nyou want it. See? That was very excited. And then -- then the boat come, you know, and\nwe go on a boat. Oh, what a good food we had, you know. So many people were sick, I\nnever was sick. I eat for two, for three, you know, my gosh, you know, and I was big that\ntime, you know, I weighed, I don\u2019t know, I weighed 220 - 240 pounds. Yeah.

        "Q: Was somebody waiting for you there? Did you -- di -- did they pick you up?",
        "A: No, no, we had a ticket straight to Utica because my father was living in New York\n[indecipherable] with his outs -- outskirt Utica and we had a train ticket there, and the --\nthe next day we come to Utica, the first time I saw my father.",

        "A: You know, it\u2019s hard to explain. Tha-That was a -- it is a good question, though. You\nsee, I didn\u2019t grow up with my father, I never saw him, you know? I think my father more\nas a Close friend than father. I can\u2019t help it, you know? And he was strong, gosh you\nknow, and we look like a brother, you know. So I think I\u2019m more like a brother. And he\nwas good to -- to me. There wasn\u2019t many discussion, family discussion you know, and\nthis, you know, about I was in between, you know.",
        "Q: Did he know more or less what had happened to you? Did he ask you about it, did you\ntalk about that at all?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, we -- yeah, I told him, I explain him, you know, what it was. I was --\nspent some time in a concentration camp. Yeah, well, too bad, too bad. Well, he says, this\nis fault -- your mother fault, you know, she shouldn\u2019t go to Europe, you know, she should\nstay there. Well, on one hand I agree with him, on the other hand I disagree, see, because\nthere was some other reason that she couldn\u2019t stay here, see? Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: So where -- where did you stay when you came? Did you stay with your father, or --",
        "A: Yeah, first three months were stay with -- with my father, and right away they give us\nthe job, wi -- was -- Frieda was learning how to weaving, and I was working 1n a -- ina\nfactory, clothing factory, you know [indecipherable]. And I make a good money at that\ntime, and we stay three months with my father, you know it\u2019s a little bit crowded. So after\nthree months we get a small apartment in Utica on blandin -- Blandina Street, yeah, I\nnever forget that upstairs vi -- over the grocery stores. That was the Italian grocery stores,\nJerry, yeah. And we was so happy, my gosh, on our own in United States. Even in a small\napartment, we were so happy, so free. And then we was working and start saving some\nmoney. Then in 1952 -- no, \u00b051 I think, we bought a small farm there, about 15 kilometer\n-- 15 miles from here, Vernon Center. And we had some chicken, about three or 400\nchickens and some cattle. And we were -- Frieda worked on the farm, I worked on the\nconstruction and in the evening I worked on the farm and -- and we was very happy, you\nknow, that -- I -- I [indecipherable] it is the same thing like in Austria, somewhat. Little\nbit different, but we got the own farm, see. But we had that farm for five years, then I\nalways had it in my mind, you know, to go to my monument business, because that\u2019s\nwhat I learned in Flossenbirg, you know, cut the stones, you know. I was -- that helped\nme too, because I -- really I know when I talk about myself how good I was, but I was\ngood s -- good stoneconner -- cutter. And when you\u2019re a good stonecutter you get a little\nbit more food, you know, and that\u2019s what was very important, that\u2019s what my friend gave\nme advice, you know, if you -- if you w-work -- do good, and many times, you know,\nthey give me special jobs, you know, very co-complicated job, and I did it, you know,\nand I belong -- I used to belong to the best stonecutters there in Flossenburg. Yes, so I go\nto the monument business here. I stotes -- I start [indecipherable] I start with a small\nmonument business, and after 15 years I go for the big business, and like you see right\nhere when you look at it through the window, that\u2019s our business here, Monument Place,\nand from then up to now we do very good, and now my son Ricky take over, and I just go\nonce awhile, you know, help him out a little bit.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a little bit 1ronic in a way that you found yourself loving a job that you were\nforced to learn in a concentration camp, but you liked it later on, yes?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. I\u2019d -- I tell you the truth, I used to like better stonecutting than work in a\nbakery. I didn\u2019t like the dough and flour, you know, and dust, you know\u201d? But you got\ndust with the stones too, but -- yes, I -- I like and I like monument business and 1s very\ninteresting because every day you got something else to cut, different flowers, different\nsculpture, you know, and lettering and this, you know, and this 1s very, very interesting\ncause there\u2019s no end to it.",
        "Q: So you were happy to be here, and you gradually started to build a life. You had your\nown apartment, you rented a farm. But was it alf -- also difficult, maybe a little bit, to\nadjust to a different country? Was it easy to be with the neighbors in some ways, or not?",
        "A: O-O-Oh yes, oh yes, that -- that, to be honest with you, takes not -- I should say about\n10 years, say, because naturally there 1s a entirely different country than Germany or\nPoland, you know? Different system, different -- even food. And different living you\nknow? And takes a time, long time to adjust you know, to the custom, you know, how do\nit -- how the people live, but you like it. You like it, but you gotta adjusted to it, see?\nSometime you grab something to do -- oh no, in Europe you go -- do -- do different see?\nBut here you do different. Sometimes says no, that\u2019s wrong. No, it isn\u2019t wrong when you\n-- then after you find out, you know, it is right, see? So it takes awhile to adjust, no matter\n-- | think this is same thing, no matter what country you go. It takes time to adjust to the\nsystem, and now, by gosh, after so many years we live in this country, what 50 years?\nGod bless this country, you know? It is the best country on the earth. God bless America.",
        "Q: Did you feel the need to talk about the experience that you went through to anybody\nelse but your wife? Did you find yourself talking to neighbors, or did people want to\nknow, did they ask you?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, and very interesting. Even now, we had several interview, you know,\non that radio station where I got my program every Sunday, was three times there, and\nthen we write article to the local paper, [indecipherable] Dispatch. And many people ask\nus, you know, my gosh [indecipherable] went through, and tell us some more about that.\nSo I\u2019m glad to tell, and a -- very interesting, you know, the younger generation is so\ninterested in this story, you know. They had no idea, you know. First they thought, you\nknow, that only Jews was in a concentration camp, which is true, nobody can say\ndifferent, see. Jew -- Jewish people suffered the most, you know, during the war. That\nwas a really Holocaust for them, and they had no help from nowheres, you know. That\u2019s\ntrue, you know. But also same time, you must say, you know, that many other\nnationalities suffered -- even worse, some of them, you know. You take those people in\nSiberia in Russia. My gosh, what they must went through. Even worse, you see? So we\nare glad to talk about this, you know, and God forbid, you know, that this never happen\nagain, something like that. And young generation, yeah, matter of fact, as you know, I\nwrote the wa -- article of my recollection to the book for the high schools teachings about\nthe Holocaust. I got my six pages there, my story.",
        "Q: When was -- when was that, and who initiated that?",
        "A: That book?",
        "Q: Mm-hm, how did that come about, and when was that?",
        "A: Oh that was -- oh, well, because, actually the Jewish people start, you know, teaching\nabout the Holocaust for the high schools, see, in New York state. And when we find out\nthat Jewish people gonna -- gonna m-make that book, you know, we also want to be\nthere, y-you know, and tell our story, and we was accepted. And there\u2019s some Catholic\nChristian stories too, in that book. So many people ask if this is true, you know,\nespecially younger people. Is that true, or it 1s just a propaganda? You know, that gets\nyou a little bit. What kind of a propaganda? Th-This not propaganda, I got so many\nevidence, films, books, by gosh, people was there like me, you know. I no lie. I tell -- see,\nwho gon -- whoever gonna listen to this tape, you know, I can\u2019t lie, you know, because\nsomebody can straighten me out, hey wait a minutes. You -- you -- you lie about this, or\nsomething like that. So we give you that -- that -- that true story where we was going,\ntrue, and what we saw, what we experience that time.",
        "Q: So did you feel that your experience as a Polish inmate 1n a concentration camp was a\nlittle bit forgotten by history, in a sense?",
        "A: I think -- I think it 1s enough books and mention about the Polish people suffered\nduring the second World War. Don\u2019t forget. But that was a -- we say six millions Jewish\npeople losted their life during the second war. Oh my gosh, about six million Polish\npeople, Christian people sacrificed their life during that war. So maybe -- maybe this is\nnot the -- how should I say it? This is a little -- a little bit difficult question. But maybe it\nis -- maybe doesn\u2019t -- maybe -- maybe the history doesn\u2019t say enough, you know, about\nPolish people, and not only Polish people, what about other nationalities? What about\nRussian? What about the other nationalities suffered so many? How many Russians, how\nmany millions, they die, you know? And this -- those people gotta be taken to\nconsideration too, you know. Not only one nationality, see? All of them. And I am glad\nwe had an invitation to Holocaust, to Washington, and we told our story. They treat us\nnice, you know? And I told them the same story what I tell you right now, that -- and\nwe\u2019 re speaking about the Jewish people, yes they suffered the most, and they had no help\nfrom nobody, yeah. So we was a little bit more lucky, you know, let\u2019s put it this way.",
        "Q: I would like to come back to this a little later, but let\u2019s go back in time again to th-the -\n- more the beginnings of your family here. You had a second child?",
        "A: Yeah, Richard was born 1951, in January. Yeah, and he grow up here as a hundred\npercent American, okay? And he\u2019s still single, he is with us. He got his house next to us,\nhe bought a house, he living in his own house. And he take over our monument business\nand he work there. And he had a college, yeah, educated.

        "A: Ah, this is another tough question, yeah, and I have to tell you that true. Yes, many\ntimes come to me, and to be honest with you, sometime I not believe that happen to me, I\ngo through this, you know, that wasn\u2019t me. Then I think, you know, yes, that was me. I\ngo through this. I give you example. How can you feel, let\u2019s say January, February, you\nknow, you\u2019re co -- you work 10 hours, wintertime I was working 10 hours in a quarry.\nYou come, they counted you, somebody\u2019s missing, okay?

        "Q: Attec -- yeah, attention.",
        "A: Yeah. And they count and count, one prisoner 1s missing and you stay there for two,\nthree hours, hungry and cold, don\u2019t move. How can you this explain to anybody what that\nis? So, those days, you know, happened many times. Coming back to me. I says, how can\nyou -- or how can you go through this? This is impossible, yeah. That was possible.\nYeah, so sa -- those -- yeah, every time you see those faces, you know, familiar faces, SS,\ncommandant, inspection, you know.",
        "Q: So this --",

No. I always got answer for myself and Frieda\nsame thing, you know. Thanks God. Could be a worse, you know. But time to time you\nknow, it comes, you know. Some happenings, you know, what is hard to believe, even for\nme, even for me, I saw it with my own eye what happened, you know? Yeah.",
        "Q: Did your children ask you sometimes about that time?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Or did that not come up much -- I mean, how -- how did it -- di-did you talk about it?",
        "A: Sometime yes, sometime, just a -- so much, you know, they ask, yeah, how was it,\nyeah, this and this, yeah. And then -- but actually, we not talk much about that, see? But\nme and Frieda, many time you know, we got the breakfast, okay, we got ham and eggs --\nham and eggs, and good bread, you know, good coffee, [indecipherable] you know.

Like I said, the -\n- the Laundromat was located in a -- in a washroom where we used to take a shower. All\nthe electric factory was located in a kitchen, our kitchen used to be. And some French\ncompany built up the little factory there, right in a concentration camp. And Jake didn\u2019t\nlike that, and I didn\u2019t like that, and we discussed it, and Jake, with the rest of it --\nmembers of that organization, they put the pressure on the Bavarian government to\neliminate those private -- or in a commandanture, there was a regular, people was living\nthere, you know, like a apartment, they change for the apartment.

        "Q: Did you go back -- ever go back to Flossenbtrg?",
        "A: Oh yes, several times, yes, yes. The first time was the worst. When I came to the little\nmuseum what they got in there by the cremation there, not far away. Then I looked at it,\nall pictures, the commandant and the -- how the prisoners was working in a quarry and\nthis and this, then in the middle I saw the pretty good size picture there, and there was a\nbunch of prisoners, and there was a kapo, and -- and -- and they was receiving the soup.\nAnd guess what? I recognize myself. Then I almos -- I almost fainting, you know, I -- I\ncouldn\u2019t believe it, I called Frieda na -- says, \u201cFrieda, look at this picture, and you see\nanything unusual?\u201d She looked at it closer, she says, \u201cJulian, that\u2019s you.\u201d Second in a --\nin a first row, you know, yeah. And then -- then I remember, you know, and we go -- that\nwas the first day in a -- in a -- a quarry. After two weeks where we was on a\n[indecipherable] block, the newcomers blocks, you know, we was there 14 days, that\u2019s\nthe time, you know, the SS officer ask me, you know, if I know why I am here, you\nknow, and -- yeah. And then -- then I remember there was a small -- we make a joke\n[indecipherable] I remember this exactly, you know, because usually the SS was tall\nguys, you know, and this, but that photographer SS man, he was a -- a little guy, red hair.\nAnd he had a big camera, you know, like a accordion, black one. And he make the\npicture and says, no wonder -- we make a joke out of it, no wonder, you know, they no\nwant him on the front, you know, this -- he\u2019s got the right job just to make a picture. And\nthat picture -- who knows how, you know, survive and I\u2019m -- and this is the best evidence\nyou know, if somebody says no, you wasn\u2019t there. And why I -- this is very interesting --\nwhy I know that was the first day in the quarry, because we had a -- a wooden -- wooden\nshoes, you know, wooden soles. And then a -- and that same day I was -- they gave me to\nthe kettakommando, we -- we climbed a -- in a quarry, you know, on a stone, and we\u2019 ll\nput the ke -- chains around the big blocks and the crane pull them out from the -- from the\nquarry. And they give us leather shoes. So that first day, I\u2019m standing there with wooden\nshoes that I know that was from August, let\u2019s say 17 - 18, August 18, ni -- 1942, see, the\npicture was made. And I\u2019m on that picture.",

But then we decided, me and my family, Frieda,\ndaughter Frieda and son Richard to go. And that was -- I believe, you know, I can\u2019t tell\nyou exactly the -- whether -- that was ninese -- 1980 -- \u201983 - \u201984, I come first time to the\nFlossenburg. Was everything change, you know. The trees growing you know, bushes\ngrowing, then I see their factories there, then the -- all barracks gone, they got the one\nfamily houses, you know, where the barracks was there. I didn\u2019t like it.",
        "Q: How -- how did your children respond to that? Did you have a feeling that they\nunderstood something in a different way than before, or what was their response?",
        "A: The daughter -- daughter Frieda want to run away, you know, from that concentration\ncamp. She couldn\u2019t -- you know, she was shaking, you know, and she couldn\u2019t believe it\nwhen she saw the cremation oven, you know, it\u2019s still there, you know, untouched, yeah.\nAnd when she saw that, she knew, and she see those pictures, see my picture over there,\nshe want to run away. But we make videotapes there and they stay, then -- then after that\nwe go -- we go Germany, Austria, most every two, three years we go there, you know, we\nstill go on there, you know, because Frieda got some relatives there, sisters. And when\nwe go there, naturally, we stop in Flossenburg, you know, just look at, you know, and --",
        "Q: W-Why --",
        "A: Is -- is interesting though.",
        "Q: Yeah, that was -- that was my -- my other question. Why did you decide to go back\nafter the first time? Was that important to you to go back to that place for some reason?",
        "A: Yes, because I -- I was talking to some people, they were there. And I says, you\nshould go, you should see, there\u2019s -- everything is change, but a few houses, you know,\nand a few things are still there. It is a beautiful chapel build up from the towers, you\nknow, watch towers. Beautiful chapel. And I thought, my gosh, maybe I should go and\nsee that place and go to that chapel and thank God, you know, we survive, you know. So\nwe go and I\u2019m glad we go, we -- we saw and after that we go almost every two years\nthere, and we stop there, and that most important to be there, that was 50 anniversary, you\nknow, when the concentration camp was free, liberated. And you wouldn\u2019t believe --\nbefore we go there -- first I thought I don\u2019t know, should we go or not? But, one of the\nguy from Arizona, his name 1 -- was Bob Hager, he find out about me in a United States\nHolocaust -- he saw the movie, and he called me, and he -- over the telephone he\nintroduce himself and he says, \u201cI\u2019m the one from the Third Army, I open the gate there,\nin concentration camp Flossenbirg.\u201d I says, \u201cOh my gosh. Thanks. Where you live?\u201d Oh,\nhere in Arizona, I retired, so and so, and wa -- I was in a 97 division of Third Army,\nGeneral George Patton. So this gonna be 50 anniversary and I\u2019m in contact with the\nMunich government there, with the minister, and I got invitation and probably you gonna\nget invitation too. And we should go, and we should meet there. I says, okay, we go.\nYeah, then I go with the whole family. But before, I says, I want to do something. Then I\ncall Bob, and I told him over the telephone what I want to do. Some kind of mark, like a\nbronze plaque, to thank Third Army for liberation. He says, yes, that\u2019s a good idea. I\ngonna call up Munich and I gonna tell them, you know, and they gonna find a place\nwhere they want to put that -- that plaque. Good, good idea. So he called me back, he\nsays, yes I already -- I already talked to minister so and so in Munich. I says, good idea,\nand that plaque what Julian Noga gonna design, we can put it in death valley on a wall.\nThere is a wall there between the chapel and -- and death valley, and he can put it there.\nAnd when he -- when he make this plaque, I give him the help, and they help him, you\nknow, to -- to place that plaque there. Okay. So I design that plaque. I put pretty good\nsize, oh I don\u2019t know, 28 inches by 18 inches high bronze plaque. And then I put in the\nleft corner on top, I put American Sherman tank. Then in right corner on top I put that\nemblem, the -- from that 97 division emblem they had, there is like a fork, like a devil\nfork or something like that, you know? That was the emblem for the division. So I put\nthat emblem in the right corner on top and then I say, well, thanks to the American, you\nknow, for liberation this and this, then I put Julian Noga, number 1623, and other\nprisoners, to thank Americans, see? So when we -- when I -- when I bring that plaque\nover there, I had two workers there, what they take care of that place, and they had the\ndrill, and they, you know, we already told them, you know, how this gonna be put in the\nwall, in the granite wall. And they drill up the -- for me, four holes, you know, and I set\nthat plaque myself with my own hand there. And that was something so -- so -- Saturday\nand Sunday there was a big doing, speeches, you know, and people coming from all over,\nex-prisoners, you know, there was -- they say was about 7,000, I don\u2019t know it was 7,000\nthere. There was Dr. Jack Terry there, there was -- with his daughter, and there was Paul\nWash there -- Wash, he was with his wife, and there was some other prisoners there from\nNew York City, from Poland come in whole -- two buses come in from Poland, ex-\nprisoners, and for German ex-prisoners, and from all Czechoslovaks, Russians, you\nknow, from all over, lots of flowers, some speeches, you know, and that was very, very\ninteresting. And we had a special praying that chapel, there was a German bishop, you\nknow, special prayer for all of us, you know. That was very -- and the Jewish people had\na nice ceremony there, by the Jewish monument and also they had prayer and we was\nwith them and that was very emotional, you know, we -- we feel like brothers, you know?\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you are Jewish or German or Polish or whatever, or Czechs, or\nFrench, you know? We was like -- like brothers, you know? We respect each other\nbecause only we know what we was going through.",
        "Q: Is remembering --",
        "A: So -- excuse me, I didn\u2019t finish yet, yeah. And the Bob was there, the Bob Hager, he\nwas there and when it come time, you know, the plaque was covered with the white cloth.\nWhen it come time, the -- Bob Hager and me, we unveiled that plaque in death valley\nthere, where the execution they had almost every day there, you know, with so many\npeople die over there, and that was a great moment you know. And Bob Hager lay\nbeautiful -- with his wife Peggy, he lay a beautiful flowers there by that plaque and that\nwas very -- he put, and then after that there was a program, you know, and there was\nmany speeches there from different nationalities, you know? And even the mayor from\nFlossenburg, he says, I am 56 years old, I was born after the war. I\u2019m sorry, you know,\nthat you people have to got through this. I\u2019m sorry that our quiet, willa -- village come on\na map as a certain -- as such a bad place. He had a nice speech, and says, of course, we\nare not responsible for this what happen in our quiet village, but also we got that black\nspot in our history. I\u2019m sorry for that. Such a beautiful speech he had.",
        "Q: Were there other responses from -- from Germans? Did people approach you in any\nway, did you hear any kind of reaction from people who were there?",
        "A: Oh, my gosh, there was a -- there was another -- another mayor from Ravensbrick,\nthere was some high officials, you know, and they come -- they follow us, they ask us\nquestion. And television cameras and -- and a radio -- those people from the radio station,\nyou know. Gosh, we was so busy, you know, and they ask question, you know, and that\nwas very interesting, you know, very interesting. And again I say that usually younger\ngeneration, you know, that was so -- for them that was so interested, you know, what it\nwas, that -- Flossenbuirg concentration camp.",
        "Q: Is remembering important to you? Apparently it 1s, but is it -- 1 -- is also painful, but --\nbut is it -- 1s it important to you to remember, and what do you do to keep the memory\nalive when you are getting older and older --",
        "A: Yes, well this 1s -- I got my own explanation for myself, see? That was a wartime, and\ngosh in a wartime, many, man -- this no -- no war, you know, is honest on either side, you\nknow. And during the wartime so many people had it worse, maybe worse than -- than --\nthan -- than me, you know, like take any Jewish family, you know, like I meet -- even the\nDr. Terry, you know, he losted a whole family there, he is by himself. And many other\nJewish people, you know, they losted their whole family, you know? And also some\nPolish people losted their family in a concentration camp, and -- and was -- you know,\nthere could be a worse, you know, but maybe of this experience I explain myself, what\nwe was going through, maybe make a -- maybe this experience make me a better man,\nyou know, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so busy, you know, with this social organization, you\nknow, and I try help other people. And I try tell the people that life can be a different, you\nknow. And, you know, it bothers me when I see that the American, you know, make a\ndemonstration, and sometime they burn the American flag, you know, that hurts. I -- I\nsay, people, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. You don\u2019t know that the life can be a\ndifferent. And matter of fact, you know, if I was young boy when the older people says,\nyou know, what they was going through the first World War, I laugh and I says, ah what -\n- they say they eat rotten potatoes, you know and this and this. My gosh, it\u2019s happen, I no\nhave to wait long enough and I eat rotten potatoes. I -- and this is hard to believe, why\nrotten potatoes? I tell you why. When a potatoes is rotten, you cut the bad -- bad part out\nof it, and rest of it 1s little bit yellish -- brownish, you know? Rotten potatoes is sweeter,\nand healthy potatoes is bitter, that\u2019s why. So I remember what the older people says, we\nused -- then we was so hungry we eat the rotten potatoes. Yes, I understand, now, see? So\n-- but when a -- when it comes -- you know, at that time, I didn\u2019t pay my -- m-much\nattention, you know, oh gosh, there was a first World War. So what? So what? They was\nborn in wrong time, you know, I was born after the war, you know, I\u2019m lucky. But by\ngosh I not have to wait too long -- too long, you know, to go maybe even worse what\nthey was going through. See, then I find out -- that\u2019s why, you know, that experience, that\nlife what we had, maybe make a be -- better man out of me, you know? Maybe I\nappreciate it more, what we had, you know, the life, the freedom, you know. What is\nreally important.",
        "Q: You mentioned social work or some charity work. Tell us a little bit more about that.\nWhen did you start doing it, and what is it, actually, that you are doing?",
        "A: Well, first when we come -- when we come to this country, there was that time, you\nknow, when President Truman was president, and a -- of United States, and he made that\nPresident Truman Act, you know, for the DP persons, for the -- for those people who\ncouldn\u2019t go back to the Communist country, you know, so they -th-the border was open\nfor -- to this country you know, and here in Utica, besides me, come in -- many, many\npeople come in. Some of them was in the concentration camp, but most of them, you\nknow, they was working in the -- on the farms, like I was working on a farm first, and in\nthe factories, you know? Then we -- well, we come to this country like I told you from\nthe beginning you know, e-everything was strange over here, was beautiful but strange.\nSo we organize ourselves, and I was one of the co-organizer 1-in this organization. We\nnamed that organization the newcomer\u2019s organization, see? So we started making shows,\nyou know, and whatever money we had, we have some orphans in Germany, some\nwidows, you know, the money was going, you know? There was like a charity\norganization. And thanks God, you know, I was 35 years president of this organization.\nThen I organized another organization what is Kopernik Memory Association. So my\nidea was to have another organization with the Polish background, you know, to tell us\nabout the Polish history, you know, Polish culture. And same time we collect enough\nmoney, you know, on 45,000 dollars, and we build up the beautiful statue here in Utica.\nThat was my idea, I must say, Kopernik statue, 21 feet high and stays right in the center\nof the city of Utica, across the street from the Munson Proctor Ins -- Institute -- museum,\nsee. And I\u2019m very proud about that, and we had other people, you know, I like. Then I\nstart radio program, Polish and international music I play every Sunday for two hours on\nthe local station here, on the other side woods there, you know, I can walk over there, you\nknow, I live close to it. And this is my hobby and I\u2019m very happy, you know, very busy\nyou know, between radio station organization, I belong to quite a few of them, and our\nbusiness, you know. Keep me busy, I get no ol -- no time to get old.",
        "Q: Did you keep up a little bit with the discussion about Jewish-Polish relationships in\nPoland in the 70\u2019s, and then in the later 80\u2019s this become a -- a difficult discussion to -- in\nPoland, to di -- to discuss that more openly than it was before. Did you keep up with that\na little bit? Do you think it\u2019s -- the -- the process of working through this very difficult\nsubject matter is -- is happening?",
        "A: This is a -- a very delicate question, you know. I grow up with the Jewish people, as I\ntold you from the beginning, you know. Matter of fact, I had the Jewish girl, we was very\nclose with the -- nothing was there, not -- we was not in love, no, absolutely. But we\ngrow up together and thanks God, you know, she survive, you know. She had the\nChristian paper, she emigrate to Germany. She was working on a farm in Germany, as a\nPolish girl and she married a Polish guy, you know, and her father was killed, and --\nduring the war, and her mother was killed, too, you know, and she was the only one there,\nyou know. So we grow up with the Jewish people and I had nothing against the Jewish\npeople there in -- in -- in Poland, absolutely, you know. That was a -- more like a\ntradition, you know, if you want to buy something you go in a Jewish store, you know,\nyou buy, you know, you get good deal, you know? But -- and Jewish people in Poland, I\nthink there was about three and a half -- three and a half million Jewish people in Poland,\nyou know. There was more Jewish people in Poland that time than today in Israel, see?\nAnd -- and they had businesses, they had heavy industry that was in Jewish hand, too,\nand I think they was treating, you know, very well, they -- we had doctor and -- doctors\nand professors and scientists and all kind of -- you know, and that was -- that was -- I\nthink they was treating good. But here, after years, time to time, I see some articles in the\npaper that -- that we aren\u2019t -- that we are, Polish people, anti-Semitic. Now, this is, to me,\na little bit hurts me this, this accusation. Because I wasn\u2019t anti-Semitic. I live -- I had a\nfriend, Jewish friend, and I still got Jewish friend here. Jake Terry is a example. I have\nhere in Utica many Jewish people are good friends, close friends. And that hurts\nsometime when they accuse us, you know, to -- that the Polish people are anti-Semitic,\nyeah. Well, gosh, you know, I don\u2019t know what they mean. Well, this happened -- see,\nour -- somebody, you know, another Christian make a denunciation on me, you know,\nabout the [indecipherable] what I tell you about, you know? How about Frieda, you\nknow, some people make a denunciation. So you got bad people here, here, and I believe,\nyou know, maybe that was some anti-Semitic, you know, in -- in Poland between some\nkind of people, you know, not -- not me, you know. And when you say the Polish people,\nthen you talk about all Polish people, that I\u2019m included, ex -- as a -- as a -- a -- froma\nPolish background, you know? And we -- I think we shouldn\u2019t say that, that -- you know.\nI believe that some people was anti-Semitic and maybe today you -- you -- you\u2019Il find\nthem, see? Like you find here in this country, anti-American people, right? Yeah? When I\nlisten to -- to Rush Limbaugh, you know, I wonder -- I wonder, you know, what kind of\nan American he is, you know, when he called our president stupid, and a liar and this and\nthis, call him name, you know? That\u2019s for me -- that hurts me, too, you know? I mean,\nthis 1s a very delicate -- delicate question, you know, between the Christian and Jewish\npeople in Poland. But I think that Poland opened the border for seven century, when the\nother countries, you know, chase out the Jewish, you know, like Spain or other countries\nchase out the Jewish people, Poland take them, you know, and for seven century, the\nJewish people was in Poland. And my gosh, you know, maybe there was some incidents,\nyou know, I don\u2019t know about that, see? But as I remember, you know, like y-you take a -\n- even little city like Struchin or Tarnow. My gosh, the -- most of the population was\nJewish population and the businesses, most of them was in Jewish hands. So that was, I\nthink, I don\u2019t know if you -- if you say criticize, this is -- I-I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t got no\nanswer, you know.",

So we both go. Yeah, and that was very interesting, and that was\nmore changes in Poland. They had electricity, they had all over country, they had the new\nroads through the country, the buses was going. They had so many orchards. Before, I\ndidn\u2019t see those orchards too many, you know. And people -- people lived different,\nentirely different. And you know, because that time, since 1939 to 1979, that time you\nmiss, you know, and now this is a question, would you like to live here? My answer,\nsorry to say, you know, no.

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Di-Did you ever feel that Americans in general, or that the younger generation doesn\u2019t\nreally know enough about Poland, so that you\u2019re assoc -- that your society has really\ntaught younger people much more about Poland?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Could you give maybe an example, also, if you have one?",
        "A: That was -- that was for some time the younger generation, American younger\ngeneration, they didn\u2019t know much about the Poland, that was not much to them --- to ye\n-- ye -- I mean, it was not interesting. Besides, you know, Chopin was Polish, you know,\nMaria Curie-Sklodowska, Paderewski was a good artist, and -- and General Kasimir\nPulaski, and [indecipherable] for this country, and General Kasimir Pulaski was wounded\nand died there in Georgia that time in the war, you know, die for this country. They know\na little bit, little bit a-about that, see, but really th-that -- the more interesting was to the\nyounger generation, here in this country, when Holy Father John Paul the second become\nHoly Father as a pole -- Polish cardinal, then the people was more interested where he\ncome from? Ah, he is Polish. What he was doing during the war? Well, this and this, you\nknow, and they -- then they -- they -- and that was interesting, I think, and they was more\ninteresting, you know, to find out, you know, what -- what kind of a country is the\nPoland, you know? I speak generally, you know [indecipherable]. Then a second, when a\n-- when a Communist was -- we think was so strong and we thought, you know, nobody\ngonna fight Communist you know, and the Communist gonna be forever, here a simple\nco -- guy come from the Gdansk, Lech Walesa, and he started that strike what was\nimpossible that time, you know, in any Communist country. He started it and he get 10\nmillion workers behind him. And this is very interesting, without the one shot to be fired,\nyou know, he defeated the Communists, you know. Thanks to him, you know, and the\nHoly Father was helping too, and I must say, that time, President Reagan help also, you\nknow [indecipherable] like he call on Gorbachev, come on, get down with the Berlin\nwall, come on, open the border, you know, and this and this. That was President Reagan\nand he was the first president he called it by name, you know, he called the Communist,\nyou know, devil, or whatever he said, yeah. So this together, you know, of course they\nstudy in Poland, you know. Then that Poland was more interested to the younger ge --\ngeneration, you know, which 1s good to -- to know, these facts, yeah.",
        "Q: What -- what about your own children and grandchildren? Are they -- to what dis -- to\nwhat degree are they interested in their own si -- Polish and Austrian, for that matter,\nbackground?",
        "A: Yeah. To be honest with you, we not talk that much, you know, about this, you know.\nI -- I don\u2019t know, we never discussed this, really, you know. We talk more about, you\nknow, what happened, what you doing, you know, and this and this, but we not go there.\nOnce awhile we talk, you know, how nice was in Austria, and around holidays, you\nknow, they got different style there for the holidays, you know, and also in Poland, you\nknow, so we -- we talk the tradition a little bit, you know, but not too much. Maybe we\nshould talk more about that.",
        "Q: I guess I was just wondering whether they themselves had sort of the urge to read\nbooks about it, or to find out, or to -- to go themselves, or -- or not.",
        "A: Yeah, well, not -- really, I don\u2019t know what to say, yeah, it\u2019s -- it doesn\u2019t come to that,\nyeah.",
        "Q: Wh-When you look back, what kind of impact -- I mean this is a very difficult,\ncomplex [indecipherable] question, but maybe you can speak a little bit to 1t, when you\nlook back, what kind of impact did your experience during the war have on you, for your\nlife afterwards?",
        "A: That -- I -- say again, I -- I didn't get you, I --",
        "Q: What -- what -- what impact -- what -- what --",
        "A: Impact was, yeah.",
        "Q: -- effect, what -- what -- what effect did those experiences during the war have on you\nfor your life afterwards?",
        "A: Oh, like I said before, you know, that tells me, you know, that life can be\n[indecipherable] different, see? And that the life itself can be so miserable for many\npeople, not only for me, for many people. And sometime, you know, I think why is it like\nthat? Why -- why was it like that? What I did wrong, you know? Why those people\nsuffered so much, you know? Is that my guilt because I am Polish, is that a guilt because\nI\u2019m Jewish? We didn\u2019t do nothing wrong, just our nationality and that was a crime to\nthem? You see, so you -- you think sometime, instead of world where we live today, you\nknow, is a -- 1S a -- 1S a -- 1S a honest, or sometime, how should I say, dishonest.\nEspecially you know, it bothers me because those people was high ranking, you know, no\nmatter what -- whether that was Communist system, or fa -- fascism, or -- or -- or -- or\nnow, democratic system, they was then high and they still high. Nothing happened --\nactually, nothing happened to them, you know? What happened to regular, average\npeople, they suffered the most, yeah.",
        "Q: Your own political sympathies, are they -- to which direction -- wh-what -- what are\nyou, politically speaking, more sympathetic to which party? Are you more of a Democrat",
        "A: Independent, Independent, I just vote, and Frieda is more a open Democrat, you know,\nand I in position, you know, because I got the radio program and I got so many friends in\nboth parties, you know? Even in Green party, see? So, I decided to stay Independent, but\nwhen it come to the votes, I look who runs for that office, you know, would I like that\nguy. I listen careful, you know, then I wait, you know, which one -- which -- which one is\nbetter, you know? Then I vote regardless whether he\u2019s Republican, Democrat, or Green.\nYeah, I go by the person, see? Frieda goes strictly Democrat, you know, my wife, yeah.\nBut also sometime, yeah, o-oh, gosh, he\u2019s a Republican, but he\u2019s a good man, yeah,\nmaybe I should vote for him. I says, that\u2019s up to you, that\u2019s up to you. Yeah, so, again,\nthanks God we live here in this beautiful country, and lately now, you know, yesterday\nwe find out that Governor Bush was elected the new president. We wish him very well.\nToo bad you got some winners, you got some losers. That was unusual, we\u2019re waiting 35\ndays after the election and finally we find out who is the president for us, and I -- I hope,\nyou know, he gonna do good and keep this country strong and democratic, you know --\nI\u2019m very, very proud, you know, to be citizens of this beautiful country, United States of\nAmerica. God bless this country.",
        "Q: Maybe -- I have maybe one more question for you. And maybe you\u2019|l have nothing to\nsay, but is there any particular event that happened, a political event, or a social\nmovement or anything, over the last 50 years here, that had a special impact, a special\neffect on you that was sort of important to you for some reason?",
        "A: Well, when at that time, you know, what a -- what was it, 1962, when John Kennedy\nwas shot, you know, the president, you know, that makes a big impact on me, you know.\nI-I think on all of us, see, because that shouldn\u2019t happen, you know. That was a big\nimpact, you know, and I feel so sorry, you know, that happened. Otherwise, some other --\nI no see anything special besides. I can\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Well, I have one more question after all. Do you have a busy social life? Do you see\npeople, do you go out, are you busy in the community, apart from your work with the\nsociety, are you --",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, we had so many meetings, by gosh, you know, almost every week\nmeeting, you know. So in the evening I like to go for a meeting, you know, and discuss\nthis, whatever they got in the program you know, and I\u2019m pretty active. Which is good\nbecause you meet the people and you work for them, and they do good job, and -- and\nthis 1s a free country, you know, and you can -- you can do -- so long, you know, you no\ndo anything wrong, you know, against the government, you know. And this is good, I like\nthat part and this very interesting to me, and I want to keep myself busy, you know, I -- I\nlike to do. Matter of fact, you know, after we finish this interview, we got a meeting at\nthe Polish community club toda -- tonight, and we gonna elect a new officer, yeah. So we\ngonna vote, you know, that give me another privilege you know, to -- to select, you\nknow, more officers, see? And 1s a pretty good organization. Actually this is a -- to Polish\ncommunity club belongs about 28 organization, different organization are shareholder,\nand we are shareholder, too. And I on a board of directors, see? So, this 1s a very strong\norganization, we got the beautiful club. I was president once for three years, I remodeled\nthat place inside, installed the air conditioner, and you know, new ceiling, new floor and\nnew walls, and there\u2019s many, and by many occasion you got weddings and banquets, and\nwe can handle about 300 people, and there\u2019s a beautiful -- this a old building, but inside\nis beautiful atmosphere, you know, remodel everything. Thanks to me, I should say. No, I\noverdo it. But I was the president, and that was my suggestion to remodel that place,\nbecause that was a old style, you know, and now the younger people, when they get\nmarried, you know, they want to go in a decent place, you know, have a wedding, you\nknow, because they make a picture, you know, and this and this. So I thought that\u2019s a\n[indecipherable] time, you know, to remodel this place. No air conditioner, there was no\nair conditioner, oh, got to be. So I installed two air condition there. And it is a place\nwhere, you know, what -- that people can go. Not only Polish people, but also, you know,\nAmericans, you know. And 1s -- I\u2019m very proud I belong there, yeah.",

        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- have been working for, for the course of your life in America. Just to clarify a little\nbit, and maybe speak in a little bit more detail about them.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: So the very first organization that you founded or joined was what and when?",
        "A: That was a short after we ca -- we came to this country. There was many others -- s --\npeople come from Germany, Austria, Italy, England, so called displace -- displaced\npersons. And we thought that time that we need an organization, we should be organize.\nYou know, work together, help each other, and so -- and so we or -- organize, I am the\nco-founder of White Eagle Association here in Utica, New York. And this is an\norganization, a charity organization like I said yesterday and exists already 50 years. We\njust celebrated 50 anniversary of founding that organization. And that organization is also\na member of Polish American Congress.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s -- let\u2019s talk about the White Eagle a little bit more. What kind of causes did you\nsupport, and how did you get money together to support them?",
        "A: Well, you see, after the war -- oh -- oh, after the war was ended, there\u2019s -- there was so\nmany widowers, so many invalids, you know, people unable to work. And we organize\nsome doings, some banquets and shows, and collect some money, and we helped those\npeople. And also we help some children, you know, the orphans. And -- and stick\ntogether, and -- and also w-work together to -- not to be lost in this big country, as it 1s,\nUnited States, see? And I think we did a good job, and I was president for 35 years in that\norganization, I\u2019m very proud, and this is a very well known, fine organization -- charity\norganization.",
        "Q: And that was a local -- that was a local effort here from -- from Utica?",
        "A: Yes, local, but also we got delegates to the Polish American congress. Polish\nAmerican congress 1s national-wide organization connected with the Polish American\nalliance organization, what is a -- a very big, more like a insurance organization. Matter\nof fact, we had insurance, many of us. We had insurance, life insurance, yeah, from th --\nfrom this organization. And we got one president from both Polish American alliance,\nand Polish American congress. This is one president, a very fine man. I had a chance to\ntalk to him. He was our honorable guest in White Eagle Association when we celebrate a\nyear ago our 50 anniversary. Matter of fact, I was sitting next to him, and I show him my\nindentity card from American Holocaust, you know, United States Holocaust, and he was\nvery interested. And then I had a interview with him after, and also I put on my radio\nprogram. That interview was very interesting. Now, Polish American congress have\nlobby in Washington, D.C., and Polish American congress was working hard so that --\nthat Poland become a mem -- member of NATO organization. And now still the Polish\nAmerican congress work hard to help somehow, that the Poland be a member of United\nEurope, what is very important. And also, the Polish American congress had a -- a --\nmany people in different way financially as -- for the needy people, you know? And I\nunderstand that I am delegate there, I represent the Polish home [indecipherable] from\nUtica. I -- Iam the delegate to the congress and our meetings usually we have in\nSchenectady, New York, Albany, New York, or even here in Utica, you know? We\ndiscussed many problems as Polish Americans, what is good for us, what is bad for us.\nOur meetings are very interesting, what we really work hard. So, because between us,\nPolish people from the past, from the second World War, there is some differences\nbetween our Polish -- Polish American people in between, and Jewish people. Now, s-so\nwhat we do, many times we invite Jewish rabbis, professors, and we try dialog, and\nsmooth out some of those matters a-a-are not clear, you know, or some of those\naccusations sometime, they are not right, they are wrong. So we try and work together\nbecause Jewish people and Polish people go through the hell, through the second World\nWar, and we should understand each other better, and -- and help each other, you know,\nin a many -- when you -- so-called political matters.",
        "Q: So when you -- and so you do seminars where you invite Polish amer -- Polish people\n-- Polish Americans and Jewish Americans to -- to enter into a dialog about certain\nsubject matters?",
        "A: Yes, like we have meeting and we invite, like I said, the -- some rabbis, some je --\nfrom the Jewish organization leaders, professors. In one of the meeting we had, oh, a few\nyears back, I never forget that little bit -- was little bit touchy, I disagree little bit with that\n-- one of the speech, had one professor from Schenectady University, he was a young,\nJewish professor, 35 years old, something like that. He make a questions, how come\nduring the war the Polish people, they had to save more Jewish people? And that was a\nvery touchy question. Then, also, that was that one survivor, I believe his name was Steve\nStone, I believe, yeah. He was hiding by Christian family during the war, he was five\nyears old. And he listened to this conversation and when everybody finished talk, then he\nget up and he says, Professor, you tell us that the Polish people should had more and\nsaved more Jewish people. Did you ever was in Poland, did you ever know more about\nthat situation what it was during the -- during the war? He says no. He says, you just --\nhow did you find out about that, and how -- how you are -- well, I think that\u2019s what I\nhear, that\u2019s what we talk, you know, and this and this. He says -- then he said, Professor,\nyou know that the Poland was only country under the German occupation for helping the\nJews, for saving the Jews, was death sentence for that. Oh, he didn\u2019t know what to say.\nHe says, yeah but anyway, how come Holland save percentage-wise more Jewish people\nthan Poland? Then this Steve, the Jewish fellow, he says, well, percentage, that was a\ndifferent situation and there is a difference between Holland and Poland. See, in Poland\nthat was -- before the war started, that was three and a half million Jewish people living.\nOkay, Poland is Christian country. The German know that. And the German expect that\nthe Polish people gonna help Jewish people. And that\u2019s why they set that law, for\nanything to do with the Jewish people, Polish Christian help Jewish people or hiding\nJewish people, death sentence. And that was the -- the poster was all over the city, you\nknow, in Polish and in German, you know, and that was clear, you know, what you\u2019re\ngoing to get. But even so, this Steve -- this is not my words, this Steve told that professor\nfrom Schenectady, New York, even so, the Polish people save about 100,000 Jewish\npeople. Yeah. And different -- different ways, see, some churches, you know, help lots,\nyou know. The nuns, and also there was like Professor Karski. Professor Karski, who\nknows how many indentity card he give to the Jewish people as a Christian. And those\npeople survived. So I think that was a good answer to this. I\u2019m sorry to say, you know,\nthat the Jewish people maybe feel bitter against the Polish people, that the Polish people\nmake -- didn\u2019t make enough, you know? But when you go to Israel, when you look at it,\nwhat\u2019s the name that place, you know, where that -- all names are, and they have -- had --",
        "Q: Yad -- Yad Vashem?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yad Vashem, the memorial.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s right. You see so many Polish names, and so many trees was planted, you\nknow, to honor those people, saved Jewish people, and I\u2019m so glad -- I\u2019m so glad that --\nthat so many, at least so many was saved. Even so, you risk your life, but you save. If you\nsave only one life, this is good, you know, but they save quite -- quite a few thous -- a\nfew thousand, hundred thousand like that Steve se -- did say. So this 1s -- this 1s -- I wish -\n- | wish -- my wish is -- and I work hard, you know, and -- and I wish -- so this come\ntrue, that more understanding come in between Polish and Jewish people. We understand\nwhat they go through. They go through the hell, and we was the next, you -- we go\nthrough the hell. Maybe in -- not in so -- s -- same degree, you know, but we was not\nmuch better than Jewish people, you know that, when we give you interview about my\nwife, Frieda and myself. I come t -- we come to the concentration camp, for what?\nBecause we love each other? Why Jewish people come in a concentration camp? Because\nthey was Jewish, yeah. Was that crime? There was no crime. They didn\u2019t do nothing\nwrong. They was people like anybody else, see? And that bothers me. Now, how about\nGypsy, Roman, let\u2019s say. They come, so many of them to the concentration camp,\nbecause they was Gypsy, because they was Roman, right? All met --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: All same with other religions, like how you say, people [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Jehovah Witness? [indecipherable]",
        "A: Jehovah Witnesses, right. Because they was Jehovah Witness, was that crime? Or how\nabout homosexual? How many homosexual was there\u2019? They didn\u2019t do nothing wrong,\nyou know, that wel -- that was for then -- even in this country now, this is a private\nmatter, you know, between person and person, you know? And that -- that -- I no see any\ncrime. So you see, when you -- when you go through this as a -- as a ex-concentration\ncamp prisoner, I had so many Jewish friends. I eat with the same spoon, we help each\nother all we can. And when I hear such accusation now from the Jewish side, it hurts.\nBecause if you say that Polish people are anti-Semitic, that means I am anti-Semitic too.\nAnd I am not. I swear I am not, see, because I grow up with the Jewish people, I like\nJewish people. They didn\u2019t do nothing wrong to me, and I have no reason to be against\nthe Jewish people.",
        "Q: D-Do you feel that sometimes it 1s also a question of Americans -- non-Jewish\nAmericans maybe not having enough information to understand certain things? When --\nwhen you told people that you were out o -- that you were in camp, for instance, did they\nimmediately assume you were Jewish, or did they understand that --",
        "A: Yeah, many people -- many -- many people told me -- many people told me -- we talk,\nwell, for instance in that coffee shop we meet, you know, and so we have conversation.\nThey say, ooh, what wa -- Julie, what was you doing during the war, where were you?\nWell, I was in Germany, yeah, I spent almost four years in a concentration camp. Oh\ngosh, four years in a concentration camp. Oh, Julie, I didn\u2019t know you are Jewish. Now,\nthis 1s -- you know, make me -- sometime make me laugh, then sometime you know, it\nbothers me a little bit, see, because again, besides the Jewish people, there were so many\nother nationalities in a concentration camp and they suffered just the same, you know,\nlike Jewish people.",
        "Q: You -- you did -- you did tell your story once or twice in the -- in the newspaper. It\nwas --",
        "A: About three times, I think.",
        "Q: About three times. And it was [indecipherable |",
        "A: Here\u2019s the one of them hangs, you know, about three years ago for Valentine day,\nthere was a -- on the front page -- page, there was that article, you see that -- my picture, I\nsmile, Frieda, you know. They were --",
        "Q: It shows -- it shows both of you arm in arm and --",
        "A: Yeah --",
        "Q: -- looking very sweet and --",
        "A: -- but when you look at it above, you know, when we se -- gl -- right after we get\nmarried, you know, see our picture, you see how good looking we were at that time? Oh,\nFrieda was a beautiful girl, yeah.",
        "Q: I want -- I want to --",
        "A: And then -- and then we publicize, and we have so many response from people, you\nknow, American -- even from younger generation, we was -- I was surprised that the\nyounger generation was so interested. And you know, it is for the younger generation\nhere in -- in this country, when you write story you was in a concentration camp, about,\nbecause you\u2019ve fallen in love -- fallen in love with a Austrian or German lady. So the\nyoung generation says, and for that they sent you to the concentration camp? I says, not\nonly that, they send me to the concentration camp, I -- in a way I was lucky they send me\nto the concentration camp, but I can be hanged for that. No, they -- they can\u2019t believe it,\nyou know. For what, for love? Because you love someone you come to the concentration\ncamp\u201d? I says yes. You say that time change, you know, and here in this country you can\nmarry whoever you want, you know, regardless on the color skin, you know, on\nbackground, you know, that doesn\u2019t matter. See, but that time, during the Hitler time,\nHitler want to keep up the clean race, you know, German race, you know, no mix. But I\nno have to tell you what happened after the war, you know, there was a big mix.",
        "Q: So that was sort of an example for comments from the younger generation. Did you\nreceive -- give us a few more examples from -- maybe from the Polish community or\nfrom other people.",
        "A: M-Many of them, many of them, some people sent us the article in case we need it and\neven the [indecipherable] lady, you know, she drop about 10 n-newspapers, you know.\nAnd there was a -- a -- a big reaction on this, and even the state senator, you know, once\nhe -- he wrote me a -- a beautiful letter, and he says, Julie, I know you for a long time, I\ndidn\u2019t know what you was going through. Oh, what a interesting story, so and so. And wa\n-- that response was very, very -- in general was very good, but als -- and we had some\ntelephone call, yeah, oh congratulation, yes, yes, specially the last one, and what we had\nthree years ago on Saint Valentine day, they even call me on the station that time and\ncongratulate me. But also when I get home after the program, you know, I had a nasty\ntelephone, I told you that. A guy call me, he says, hey, you was in a concentration camp,\nMr. Noga. I says yes. Oh, and then you survive. I saw your picture 1n that paper, this\nmorning\u2019s paper. You look good. You was probably the -- one of the collaborator with\nthe Germans, right? You know how this [indecipherable]. I says, buddy, whoever you\nare, you are so wrong, and I got no words for you, good-bye. Then I hang up. You know?\nYou got people -- all depends, you know that. People are very funny, some people. Right\naway they accuse you for something. If I was collaborator with the Germans, you think I\ngo United States Holocaust there in Washington and tell my story, and my name, I didn\u2019t\nchange my name, my father and my brothers, you know, still were living -- was living\nhere, you know? I put my name if I was doing something wrong? Absolutely not. And\nbefore they accept me in -- in United States Holocaust --",
        "Q: Museum.",
        "A: -- before they invite me, they check up my background. They know who I am, yeah.\nSo, you see, here is -- so again, when I come to the Polish people and Jewish people, I\nwish we get some more dialogs, we get together, we smooth out some differences, you\nknow. And be friends, you know, as we was before the war started, you know, I had so\nmany friends, I still got so many friends there, Jewish friends, yeah. And again, nobody\ncan take away anything from Jewish people, what they was going through, through the\nsecond World War. They had not much help. I wonder sometime how come American\nJewish didn\u2019t help that time. When Professor Karski come and speak to the Roosevelt\nand tell him, Mr. President, in Warsaw, in Poland, the Jewish people are -- they are killed\nby Germans, they sent to the concentration camp. You know what the President\nRoosevelt did say at that time? Well, after the war is finish, we take care of those war\ncriminals. And that was -- yeah. And that time he come -- Professor Karski come with a\nJewish leader from the -- from Poland, from the Jewish underground. His name was, I\nbelieve Ziegenbalg -- Ziegenbalg, something like that. And they go to the English\ngovernment, they go to the American government and nothing help that time, nothing\nhelp. So the -- Ziegenbalg, he commit suicide. He open a -- I understand he open a gas in\nthe kitchen, then he died, because he couldn\u2019t -- he couldn\u2019t do anything to help Jewish\npeople, you know? And this is a tragedy, see, that -- that the whole world that time, no\nwant to listen about this tragedy, what\u2019s happen to Jewish people, what they was doing in\nPoland, you know? And that bothers me, you see. And that -- this -- this what I can say, I\nwish, you know, we -- we smooth out those differences, if this exist any differences\nbetween Polish and Jewish people, so there\u2019s more understanding, you know, why, why\nand why, yeah.",
        "Q: I would like to stop for just one second, and -- okay, so we -- I have one last question\nleft, and -- and that has to do -- there is another organization that you have worked for, or\nthat you actually founded, and that was the Kopernik Society, right?",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: Yeah, when -- when -- when did that happen and -- and -- and why Kopernik? You --\nwhat is the -- your interest there? Or what is your mission of that organization?",
        "A: I was -- that time I was the president of Polish community club here in Utica, and\nunder the -- my jurisdiction, there was 28 Polish organizations, see? So otherwise, each\nmeeting I speak to delegates of 28 organization, see that Polonia in Utica. That time was\nvery strong and still is strong. So, most of the -- those organization was like a insurance,\nlike a ro -- mothers of rosaries, or Saint Anne Societies, and Saint Peter Societies, you\nknow. But I was looking around and I was thinking, gosh, you know, we need a\norganization, you know, on a little bit higher -- higher level. Tell us about the culture,\nPolish culture, American culture, you know? So that was a -- at that time, 1970 some --\nyeah, that -- \u201973, I think. That was a -- a fi -- fifth anniversary -- 500 anniversary of\nNicholas Kopernicus -- Nikolai Kopernik birthday. And then I called special meeting, the\nwhole Polonia meeting, and it -- oh, about hundred people attend, presidents, you know,\nfrom different organization, you know, guests. And I introduce my plan, you know, we --\nwe need another organization. And because this 1s a 500 anniversary of Nicholas\nKopernicus, Nikolai Kopernik birthday, maybe we should build up a statue, put the statue\nhere in the city [indecipherable] to this -- make a mark, you know, to this, because who\nwas Nikolai Kopernik? Nikolai Kopernik was the astronomer, and he was the first man\nfind out that the -- not the sun but the earth turns around the sun, right? Yeah, and that --\nthat came long time til his book and theory was accepted, but finally was accepted, and\nby gosh, truth is, we can send a man on the moon, do you know, and this and this, you\nknow, that [indecipherable]. And so the people agree to -- to do this, and wa -- coming\nback to Nicholas Kopernik -- Ko-Kopernicus, he is a universal man. And I think that --\nthat time I thought -- I thought that was worth [indecipherable] to build up the statue for\nhim. And we did. I designed the pedestal, because I am stonecutter, of course, and the\nstatue was made -- three and a half meter high, was made in Warsaw, in Poland. Bronze\nstatue, made out of bronze. So we put it together, and -- that statue, with the pedestal\nbase, 1s 21 feet tall and four inches, exactly. And then -- then we had unveiling. When the\nstatue was ready we had unveiling and many, many people come. And the congressman\nmake a -- a -- recorded it in Washington, D.C. in Congress, that such a thing happen in\nUtica, New York. And that was a big -- big, big thing. So -- and the organization,\nKopernik organization, right after that decided to give a -- help students in college, you\nknow, give a grant, you know, give a scholarship. And that\u2019s what they do since that, up\nto today, you know, they do -- not big sc-scholarship, you -- like thousand dollars for\nthree s -- for three students, each become thousand dollars -- get a thousand dollars, yeah.\nAnd that organization -- yes, the organization got the -- got the museum and they\u2019Il find\nwork for this community.",
        "Q: Well, thank you very much for clearing that up. I think it was a very interesting\namendment to the other interview, so thank you very much Julian Noga, and this is the\nend of tape one, side A, of the addition to the actual interview. Thank you very much.",

The United\nStates Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for\nmaking this interview possible. This is tape number one, side A. I would like to ask you\ntwo questions, first of them 1s actually give us your full name, and when and where you\nwere born.",
        "Q: And because there were several questions that I have after watching the videotaped\ninterview, I thought several things were not discussed in detail enough, I would like to go\nback, actually, to the beginning, even before you born and just ask a few follow up\nquestions. The first would be, until -- before you were born, actually, until 1921, your\nfamily was in -- in this country, in the U.S.. Where did they live and what did your father\ndo?",
        "Q: But you never quite knew why that happened, why was your father still here? Was the\nidea to go back eventually, or --",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s le -- we can le -- we can leave it at that. Now, when you were back, or\nwhen your mother was back in Poland, did you have a little bit of land there? Where did\nyou go to and how did she make a living, how did she care for the family?",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back -- let\u2019s go back just a little bit to -- to the first village. How lo -- how\nmany years of schooling did you -- did you get? For how many years did you go to\nschool?",
        "Q: And what does the -- can you describe a little bit more about the situation in the\nvillage? Was there, for instance, some kind of Jewish community? Did you have contact\nwith Jewish neighbors?",
        "Q: Now, when you went to Tarnow, that was a larger city, right?",
        "Q: And you became a dishwasher in a --",
        "Q: And you stayed there for about two years and then the German invaded Poland?",
        "Q: And the bakery was closed, and you had to go back to the village and to your mother,\nright?",
        "Q: You said in the -- in the videotaped interview that the Germans started pretty much\nright away arresting and executing Jews.",
        "Q: You mention an incident there where Jewish people that you know were also rounded\nup and -- and -- and shot. Did you witness that yourself?",
        "Q: But this particular incident you did not see it, just of -- you heard about it, right?",
        "Q: Did you see anything that was directed against the Polish population?",
        "Q: I just have to get the microphone a little bit further away, so --",
        "Q: -- yeah, that should do. Do you know when that was, roughly, with the first transport\nwith Polish people?",
        "Q: Did you -- did you and your mother talk about the situation, what to do, or did you just\nkind of wait?",
        "Q: And when the Polish army receded, drew ba -- withdrew while the Germans came 1n,\nthere was -- weaponry was left?",
        "Q: And you happened to -- to find a gun and you decided to keep it, although at that time\nthe German orders were pretty clear about what would happen. I mean, Polish citizens\nwere supposed to deliver all the weapons to the Germans, or there was a death sentence if\nthey didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: My -- my question would be, why did you decide to keep it?",
        "Q: So you kept it, di -- why -- but actually why did you keep it? Because, I mean, you\nwere young, you were a young --",
        "Q: -- boy, a young man at that point.",
        "Q: Did you -- but did you think it would be useful for you to [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Was -- was that sort of -- how did you feel about a Polish -- a fellow Polish person\ngoing to the Germans, though, and denouncing you? I mean, was that something --",
        "Q: So and then you were brought to the Gestapo in Linz, and you were interrogated?",
        "Q: Oh, no, no, no, I\u2019m sorry, you were what -- but you were brought to the -- the --",
        "Q: -- the Gestapo",
        "Q: But then you did not go to Germany after all, you were brought to Austria --",
        "Q: -- at this time to Linz. Did you ever find out why that happened?",
        "Q: And so, at the unemployment office then, there were farmers waiting for the help to\ncome, and one of them waiting was your wife-to-be, your future wife, Frieda, and you\nwent to her parent\u2019s farm.",
        "Q: And then at that farm you had to work very hard, but apparently you had meals at the\ntable with the family, the food was plentiful, the food was good. How did you feel\nthough, towards the situation? I mean, it was forced labor after all. Did you feel\nresentment towards -- towards the -- the parents in any way?",
        "Q: And then you grew -- because you also worked with Frieda on the -- on the -- on the\nfields, and whatever had to be done there, you grew a little closer. You got to know each\nother just a little bit, I mean, under very difficult conditions. And then one day you said\nthat you asked her whether you could listen to the radio --",
        "Q: -- on -- actually, it\u2019s not in your story, but I think it is 1n -- it -- it\u2019s definitely in your\nwitfe\u2019s story, that you asked her whether you could listen to the radio because you didn\u2019t\nknow much was happening in the world, and that was also very forbidden, wasn\u2019t it?",
        "Q: Somebody must have seen you, right?",
        "Q: But that did not -- but -- but -- but you still could stay on the farm, or -- you -- you\nwere not immediately brought to -- to the Gestapo?",
        "Q: But then after awhile you got a little too close with Frieda for father\u2019s taste, because it\nwas a dangerous situation, so he gave you an ultimatum basically. He brought you into\nthe room and he said that one of you would have to go.",
        "Q: You still are, I think.",
        "Q: Wh-When -- when we talk about being close, what -- what did that really mean? I\nmean, you did not speak Austrian -- German -- Austrian in -- very much, she didn\u2019t speak\nPolish. What did you talk about? I mean, closeness, what did -- what did that really\nmean?",
        "Q: Was it surprising to you though, that Frieda decided to leave?",
        "Q: Let -- let me -- let me just ask you a little -- little tiny thing here.",
        "Q: I think in your story I realized that you seemed to indicate a little bit that Frieda asked\nyou, and in Frieda\u2019s story, in your wife\u2019s story, I always had a little feeling that -- that\nyou asked her. So, who -- who asked -- wh-who made that -- who made the decision to --\nyou kind of agreed that you would see each other, or who --",
        "Q: So you stayed on -- on her f -- on the large -- on the big farm with Frieda\u2019s parents and\nshe went to another, smaller farm -- I don\u2019t quite remember, about 15 kilometers, or sort\nof not too far away.",
        "Q: And you decided to see each other. But then somebody found out about it and\ndenounced you, right?",
        "Q: Do you know who -- what kind of person that was?",
        "Q: Before you go one from there, let me just ask you one more question. How long,\nroughly, did you stay at her parent\u2019s farm? How -- how long -- wh-what kind of time are\nwe talking about?",
        "Q: So that was about what, like a half a year or a year?",
        "Q: Almost a year, now?",
        "Q: And then you were interrogated again, but --",
        "Q: 11 days.",
        "Q: But they decided to -- to let you go, and to send you to a different -- to different --",
        "Q: But [indecipherable] I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Q: That was a --",
        "Q: I think this 1s a good time to change the cassette here. This 1s the end of tape one, side\nA interview with Julian Noga. This is a --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nJulian Noga. This is tape number one, side B. So, you both worked on different farms\nnow, but you still decided to see each other.",
        "Q: But once again you got, eventually, denounced by the farmer. Frieda\u2019s farmer at first\nknew about it but decided not to say anything, but when she decided to give up the job on\nthat farm to take another job, he decided to -- to announce you to the -- to the SS, to the\nGestapo.",
        "Q: Yeah. And so this time what -- then what happened? You were -- both of -- both of\nyou were arrested, and you had to stay in -- in jail for quite a long time this time, wasn't\nit?",
        "Q: You -- you -- you talked a -- you told that story in a -- on the videotape, so maybe we\ncan just summarize a little bit by saying that you -- you spent what, 11 months, or quite a\nlong time in jail. You tried to get out of jail, that was prevented. They found out about\nyour attempt to break out, and eventually you were sent to -- to the concentration camp\nFlossenburg.",
        "Q: I would like to ask you a few questions about Flossenbirg, if that\u2019s all right?",
        "Q: One of the interrogating SS men there, asked you during the early time, when you had\njust arrived, whether you knew why you were sent to the concentration camp.",
        "Q: And you said, because of your relations to an Austrian girl.",
        "Q: And he indicated that that was not so, but that you were there for revenge purposes\ntoo, to pay back, I believe you said, you p-payback for the German soldiers killed in\nPoland in Begost?",
        "Q: In Bidgast.",
        "Q: Did you ever find out whether that was the real reason, wh-whether that was really\ntrue? That seems to be a different --",
        "Q: Tell us a little bit more about who was there in this concentration camp, where it was a\nstone quarry, where you had to work very hard cutting stones. What -- what was the\npopulation of that camp?",
        "Q: And what were the nationalities? I mean, you were Polish, were there also Jewish\nprisoners, were there Austrian German prisoners, what was [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Were people treated differently depending on where they came from?",
        "Q: Were there Jewish prisoners, too?",
        "Q: Were they treated differently at all?",
        "Q: You did, in your videotaped interviews, speak about a German prisoner, Hans Bauer,\nwho -- who had saved your life, twice I believe --",
        "Q: -- you speak very highly of him.",
        "Q: More than twice. We don\u2019t have to say that over again, but was there -- w-were there\nother incidents where it wasn\u2019t quite so black and white as one sometimes seems to think,\nwhere other people helped you, who were maybe also German, or other nationalities?",
        "Q: It\u2019s a punishment --",
        "Q: -- outfit, yeah.",
        "Q: What -- what -- what about the guards and SS authorities there, was there different\nkinds of -- of treatment, too?",
        "Q: Did you ever lose faith while you were there? I -- I believe you were brought up\nCatholic, right?",
        "Q: Was it -- was a strong -- was it a religious family, could one say that, or was it not so\nstrong?",
        "Q: Erase.",

And when everybody goes sleep, you know, Frieda opened the\ndoor, you know, and let me listen to the radio. So 10 o\u2019clock in the evening there was a\nvery interesting news in Poland -- in Polish from England. And that was very interesting.\nAnd somebody hear this, somebody find out that -- I don\u2019t know how the Gestapo find\nout about that [indecipherable]. That was one reason.",
        "A: Could be, yeah.",
        "A: No, no, no, no.",
        "A: Oh that -- that happened after -- now tha -- we gotta go back little bit, see, like\n[indecipherable]. So, we was working altogether. There was four daughters, you know,\nhe -- Mr. Greinegger had four daughters and one son. And one of the daughter, by the\nname Frieda, that\u2019s the same Frieda pick us up in the -- you know, when we come from\nthe transport. And happen that winter we was working in the woods, because they had --\nthey had, I don\u2019t know, about 20 acres woods, so we got the woods for the -- for the use -\n- for the house use, and they had for sale, okay. And it happened we work in the -- we\nwork in the woods, then we work on the farm. And it happened we -- we come -- me and\nFrieda, we come closer and closer. We was very friendly to each other, see? She was a\nbeautiful, beautiful blonde. And they say I was good looking too, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not\nsure about that.",
        "A: Thank you. So, it gets closer and closer til agains -- that was too much. So the father\nthat time called Frieda and he had a speech with her. And he says, \u201cYou come too close\nwith Julian, and you know this is against the law. You know what\u2019s going to happen to\nyou. You know what\u2019s going to happen to him. And who knows what a g -- what\u2019s going\nto happen to us. This is against the law to have anything to do with a foreigner.\u201d And he\nwas right. Yeah. So he was pretty tough, first time as she can remember, and she slap her\nover the -- on her face, you know, slapped her, yeah. And she was crying. Then after that\nhe called me. And he had a speech to me, yeah. And he told me absolutely this is against\nthe law. You -- you can -- you can\u2019t have anything to do with my daughter anyway. So\none of you gotta go. Which one? And for some reason Frieda want to go. And she want to\n-- she want me to stay on the -- on the farm. He says, that\u2019s up to you. You want to go,\nokay, and Julian stay on this farm. And that\u2019s what happened.",
        "A: Oh, you\u2019d be surprised when you -- when you like somebody how fast you learn --\nhow fast you learn that language. And I -- I knew some words from -- from the school,\nyou know, and didn\u2019t take me long. Matter of fact, in a -- in a -- in a year I pick up about\noh, I should say 70 percent German language. What is -- Austrian language is German\nlanguage, just a different -- different dialect, you see. So we a -- we like each other, let\u2019s\nput it this way.",
        "A: Frieda, yeah. She decided, yeah. And she went. And that was -- that was unusual see,\nbecause there was a such a big farm, so many acres land and everything, you know, was\nplenty work, you know, but one of us gotta go. They want to split us. Doesn\u2019t matter who\ngoes, who stays. So happened she goes to another farm, quite a ways from that place. But\nwe make a promise, you know, the first Sunday we\u2019re going to meet by the church there\nin that town where she was working.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Well, this happened -- we -- really, that\u2019s a tough question, you know. We don\u2019t know\nhow this happened, see? You can\u2019t tell with the friendshi -- where -- where the friendship\nbegin, where that ends and where the love starts, you know? It\u2019s hard to -- to say it, see?\nBut we like -- we like each other so much, so we don\u2019t want to be split. We want to meet\neach other and we want to continue. And that\u2019s probably what we\u2019re falling in love, that\ntime.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: We had pretty close 1-1dea, but we -- we can\u2019t be assure for 100 percent, but anyway,\nanyway, again, you got some people, they say everything, you know, and they make a\ndenunciation. So one s -- that was Saturday evening, I drive -- I go see Frieda and I -- I\nthi -- finding in that place where we should meet. Then after that I find out she was\narrested, after. So they come in and ar-arrest me -- Gestapo -- police, you know, and the\npolice delivered me to the Gestapo in Linz.",
        "A: Til November. November 1940, I think. We was arrested first time, right?",
        "A: No, that was almost a year.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: 11 days.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: They interrogate me and Frieda, and Frieda says no, there was nothing between us,\njust friendship, and same thing I -- I -- I was saying. See, because we agree, you know, in\ncase we got caught, you know, we should say there was nothing. Actually was nothing,\nsee, besides you know, we lo -- we love each other, you know, and -- and -- a-and this.\nAnd so they, after 11 days they let me go. That was on Friday, November 1940.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And they didn't lay a hand on me, they -- they -- they were tough, you know, they ask\ntough question you know, and they look at me straight in eyes, you know, and then the\nchief says, well, I think he tell us the truth. Okay, we let him go. But, before you go, here\nis the paper and you read this. That was in German on one side, and that was in Polish,\nfor anything to do, the bottom line, anything to do with German or Austrian women for\nthe Auslander -- for the foreigner, death sentence, to hanging. And he says, okay, sign\nyour name. So I did sign my name. And they gave -- and then they let me go back to\nFrieda\u2019s father to pick up my belongings, and they already sent -- they had a address, and\nthey send me to another farmer. Little smaller, but also nice people. Different direction.\nSo on Monday, okay, on Monday in the morning they call Frieda and they tell her, okay,\nyou free, but you sign some paper. And the same paper, she signed what I signed Friday,\nokay? Tha -- but they say -- I don\u2019t know what this says on -- on -- on that. Well, she read\nthe same thing, you know, death sentence, you know, for anything to have -- to do with a\nGerman woman. So you wouldn\u2019t believe, you know, by coincident I go Friday there to\nFrieda\u2019s father, the farm, pick up my belonging and stay over Saturday and Sunday, and\nMonday morning I take the train and come back to Linz. And that Monday morning\nFrieda was going free. And you wouldn\u2019t believe, I was waiting for my train going in a\ndirection and I walk, I don\u2019t know what I was thinking, and come head on to Frieda. I\nthought this is impossible, but I was very happy to see. So we go on the side quick, we\nexchanged the addresses. She go for another farm. They didn\u2019t send her home, no,\nanother farm. A small -- really small farm, they needed her, and she go there. And again\nwe make a agreement that we -- that first Sunday [indecipherable] first Sunday, we gonna\nmeet there somewhere halfway between li -- Velz and Gunskiha -- oh, Velz and Linz on\nthe Auterstrassen.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Exactly, that\u2019s what happened.",
        "A: Yes. First Frieda was arrested, and when I went there and she didn\u2019t show up wher --\nwhere she\u2019s supposed to show up, you know, where we meet. Then I had a bad\nconscience or how shou -- bad feeling something might happen, because we were\nsupposed to meet. Then on September 19, on that farm where I was working, their name\nwas Prosmueller, that was on either side of Linz between Linz and Vienna, just a -- oh,\nabout four or five kilometer from the very well known concentration camp Mauthausen.\nAnd that day, on that day, that was again Friday. Friday is a bad day for me. Was, at\nleast. And we was -- before noon we was digging potatoes there on that farm, and I was\nworking with that -- with the horses, yeah, and we come for lunch, and as we was eating\nlunch, from the -- the other side of the kitchen, somebody walk in, see? Then we hear the\nconversation. And what I hear, oh he\u2019s very good, he\u2019s very hard working, yeah, he 1s\nnice man, oh, yes, yes. That\u2019s what they say. And that was a policeman. So after he\nquestioned -- because the -- the -- the farmer, and the -- and the parents, they was eating\nin the kitchen, we was eating in the dining room, see? Then, after awhile, we just almost\nfinished lunch, and that policeman come to the dining room and says, Julius Noga, I have\nto bring you to the Gestapo, to the Linz. He says, I have to bring you to the Linz. I says,\nGestapo? He says yes. When I hear that word Gestapo, I know -- I already knew it 1s\nGestapo. I says, oh God. Good-bye. He says, okay, you change your clothes, take\nwhatever you need like toothbrush and soap, when you had, whatever, you know, take it\nwith you, and you come with me. So we go on a station, regular station and we take the\ntrain. That was only 16 kilometer to Linz. So what was very hard for me to say good-bye\nto this wonderful family, you know? They took me as their own. They had two children,\na little girl, Minnie, she was about eight years old, and Francel, he was about 10 - 11\nyears old. And the children was there, and he ask me, \u201cJulian, where you going?\u201d I says,\n\u201cWell I have to go on Linz.\u201d \u201cWhat for?\u201d I says, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cAre you be back?\u201d I\nsays, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cOh, come on, Julian,\u201d you know? Break my heart, cause those\nchildren were so nice. And the farmer come and says, \u201cJulian, you have to go. Gosh,\nwhat did you do?\u201d I says, \u201c\u201cN-Not much.\u201d \u201cWell, I gonna help you all I can, okay?\u201d So\nthe policeman was good to me, I says well, okay, ha -- I gotta finish with my horses, see,\nI take care of the horses, I gotta give them water, I gotta give them some hay, you know?\nHe says, go ahead, do it, yeah, okay, we got time. So I say good-bye to my horses. Such a\nbig, beautiful, shiny horses, oh my gosh. That was a break -- a heartbreak. And there was\na French war prisoner Louie, and I want to talk to Louie because I know he gonna take\ncare of the horses, so I told Louie, Louie -- he understand pretty good German, I says,\ntake care of those horses, they are very nice horses, you know? Don\u2019t beat them, never\nbeat them, you know. Treat them good, work with them slow, don\u2019t rush them, you\nknow. Take care of them. He says, I will, I will. So I say good-bye to horses and to\neverybody, so we go. Policeman had a -- a bicycle, so we walked to the station just a\nkilometer and a half, two kilom -- not even two kilometers. Then we were ou -- then he\ncome to the ma -- where they sell the tickets, and there was a man, and -- yeah. And for\nthat man, each morning he had a -- yeah, each morning I bring some milk, see? He was\nthe -- he was the regular old man, you know, high ranking, and -- and he said -- the police\nask him question because that was forbidden for Polish people to ride the tran -- train. So\nhe asked, did you sell any tickets to this man here? And I was behind that policeman, and\nhe look at me, and I -- I just make a motion no. And he says, no, I never sell him no\ntickets. Oh, good. So he put a [indecipherable] the tickets, or how many times he sell me\nthe tickets, but he was a very nice man. His name was Schattsinger. Okay, so the train\ncome, and I was standing there, and I was thinking, my gosh, you know, should I fall on\nthe track, you know, and let the train go over me, you know, because I know this time it\u2019s\ngoing to be tough, and I know what I gonna get it.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Okay, fine.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Bidgast.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I think that was his personal opinion, you know, probably he lost his friend or\nsomebody there in Bidgast, that was -- that was big outbreak, before the war start over\nthere. And probably he take advantage and tell me this in [indecipherable] you know, you\nhere for those German soldier got killed in Bidgast. That -- I was surprised, you know, I -\n- I don\u2019t even knew that time where is Bidgast, as far away from our place where we was\nliving.",
        "A: That time when I arrived, it was on a August, I believe August third in 1942. That was\na small population I should say, not quite 2,000. And my number I -- I received my\nnumber, I don\u2019t know if that number 1s right or not, 1623, that is my number.",
        "A: Oh yes, that was about 17 - 18 different nationalities in that concentration camp. And\nactually the oldest prisoners was Austrian and German. Actually, 1938, that Austrians\nprisoners, and German, they build up that concentration camp. There was no other --\nother nationalities than the first. After they build up that concentration camp, I believe the\nfirst prisoners come from Czechoslovakia. Then, naturally come from Poland and o-other\ncountries.",
        "A: Maybe that was just a little differences between like French prisoners, English -- we\nhad some English prisoners, too. Matter of fact, two Americans pilot, they was killed\nthere, in Flossenburg. They run away from a stalag, from a regular war prisoners camp,\nand they was caught by Flossenbiirg and they was brought to Flossenburg, and after their\nquestioning, they was executed, those two American pilots, and they\u2019re in a death valley\nin Flossenbirg, they got the ledge, and American flag, and you can read on that ledge -- it\nis a big ledge, you know, six feet long and about 36 inches wide, about eight inches high,\nyou know? And that was founded by Polish people, that ledge, Polish prisoners. And\nsays, two Americans, unknown. But I remember when they was brought to the\nconcentration camp, and I remember when they was questioned, yeah. And when you\nread those -- you got those ledges, about 17 or 18 in the death valley, you go from one to\nthe other one, then you see how many people die, losted their life in that concentration\ncamp in Flossenburg. You start with the Russian, over 25, 000. The next one gonna be\nPolish ledge, same size as the American ledge, you know, over 17,000. Then you got the\nFrench, then you got the Czechoslovak ledges, you know, 3,000 - 4,000 French,\nCzechoslovak, Italians. And -- and before you go any further before that you got a\nGerman ledge, and says exactly I want to say 5,969. Something like that. Almost 6,000\nGerman people losted their life -- German prisoners losted their life there. That was a\ntough, tough concentration camp. When you are in, there was not much differences, you\nknow. We was treated almost -- almost the same.",
        "A: Yes, that was about -- 1t says on the -- on the -- on a board somewhere, and on a\nchimney, cremation chimney, it says 3,335 Jewish people lost their life in Flossenbirg.\nYes, they was there from Poland, from Hungary, from different -- German, Jewish too,\nfrom Germany.",
        "A: They was treated bad. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And they was working, you know, they\ngive them the -- the hardest work, you know. There was Russian, Jewish people, and\nPolish people was treating the worst.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: More than twice.",
        "A: Well, Hans Bauer was German, you know, but he -- if he -- if he died, God give him\nheaven. He saved me so many times, not only twice, so many times, because we come in\nfriends in Munich when we stay over the night there, and I even [indecipherable] his\ncigarettes, and he was a heavy smoker. And he says, \u201cOkay, thank you, I can keep this --\nthat bag?\u201d I says, \u201cKeep it, because I got another one.\u201d And he says, \u201cOkay, you are a\ngood fellow, I remember this.\u201d Okay, and later on he become kapo -- foreman, you know,\nand many times he -- he had me, you know, I -- and -- and I was so glad, you know? I\ncounted the -- once I fall in a -- well, the -- the -- th-the main kapo -- kapo in -- ina\ngranite quarry caught me during the work, you know, and I was smoking. You not\nsupposed to smoke for 12 hours when you work there in the quarry, so -- so he gave me\nshtaffkommando, what is shtaffkommando?",
        "A: Outfit.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Now, in that punishment outfit you can\u2019t last more than 30 days, you know,\nthen you com -- either you commit suicide or they kill you, you know? And I, thanks\nGod, you know, I was there seven or eight days, then one evening I saw Hans Bauer and I\ntold him, I\u2019m in a shtaffkommando. He says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you told me sooner? Okay,\ntomorrow morning you -- you go with my outfit to the quarry.\u201d So next day I go, and a\nkapo from the other kommando, shtaffkommando, he come and says, \u201cHey, you not\nbelong over here, come on. You belong to me.\u201d Hans Bauer come to him, \u201cNevermind,\nhe stay with me.\u201d Oh. He was surprised you know, but you know, those kapos between\nthemselves they don\u2019t want to fight, you know\u201d? So I was lucky that time, he saved my\nlife ri -- right there.",
        "A: Of course. There was some, not all of them was bad. There was some people like we\nare too, you know. There was some -- was some bad ones, and also good ones. And we\ndidn\u2019t fright too much SS. What we was frightened, the kapos because they want to show\nthe SS how good they are, they no have to work, you know, they just you know, had a\nbetter food, you know, plenty food, you know, and of course you know, hey kapos, you\ngotta be careful with the kapos.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Ah, y-yes. Hans Bauer helped me because I told Hans Bauer several times, tomorrow I\ngo commit suicide, I go on the barbed wire, you know, and they gonna shoot me, you\nknow, I -- just a couple minutes you know, and I gonna go. [indecipherable] he call me\ncrazy, you crazy he says. No, that\u2019s the easiest way, you know. No, no, no, no, no, don\u2019t\ndo that. So he -- he helped me. Now, that was a time, especial that was so hard, you\nknow, before big holidays gonna come, you know, like Christmas, Easter, you know, one\nChristmas, second Christmas, third Christmas and you still there. And you ask yourself,\nmy gosh, what I did? I didn\u2019t steal, I didn\u2019t kill, you know? Because I loved someone?\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here and I\u2019m mixed up with those people over here? And sometime you -\n- when you see those execution almost every day, every other day they hang somebody,\nand they had big speeches, then you hear those shots every morning before six o\u2019clock in\ndeath valley, then in the evening. Then you hear some shots at night, there by the\ncrematorium, you know, the black wagon come with some kind of people, go straight to\nthe crematorium, and you hear just a shotgun, you know? You hear -- you hear those\nshots, you know? So today people says, gosh, you know, some people disappeared, and\nmany families, they don\u2019t know how they disappeared. That was to Flossenbiirg what\nthey disappeared. And sometime -- sometime you -- you start to believe -- you start --\nstop to believe if the God is right. I says no. God can\u2019t see this, you know. And God --\nhow God let this happen? Then next time, you -- you cry, you pray, God forgive me.\nGod, I love you. Please help me. Is so hard, you know, h-how you -- once you ready to\ndie, you know, you no believe in nothing, you know the next time my gosh, maybe --\nmaybe po -- by some kind of coincident like Hans Bauer, many times he told me, maybe\nthis gonna be some occasion, you know. Maybe we gonna be free someday. See? We ga -\n- but, on the other hand, have all kind of professors, you know, all smart people,\npolitician and this and this, and on Sunday afternoon I like to hear what they say, you\nknow? I learned lots from them. And they say the one thing what they did to us, they not\ngonna let us free. Before the Americans or Russian, whoever come first, before they\ncome in, they gonna kill us all. So they gonna, how should I say [indecipherable] --",
        "A: -- the evidence.",

        "A: Oh, you see, th-those -- since Friday, when -- when we marched til Monday at noon,\nwe was freed. They not give us nothing to eat except I think on Sunday they gave us a --\njust a little slice of bread. No coffee, no water, nothing. So we had no food, and we gotta\nmarch so many hours. Sometime they let us r-rest for three or four hours, in no time we\nmarch again. So, when you\u2019re hungry and thirsty, how -- how you can march? So among\nthe -- the -- from my column, what was almost 2,000 prisoners, there was just half of that\nleft. And I tell you the truth, I was prepared to die, because I was -- I was so weak, you\nknow, and each step hurts, you know, and -- I -- I-I-I was -- I was dizzy, you know, and\ngosh, you know, but, since in the morning I hear the machine guns in behind, I hear the --\nwe hear that noise, you know, and we understand that the -- that the Americans come,\nyou know? So you fight and you -- you -- you get your strength, the last strength you got,\nyou know, to last as long as possible, you know. And we did it. Gosh, you know, 12\no\u2019clock, at noon, the first tanks -- American tank I saw. First I was mixed up, you know,\nbecause I see the big white star on their tank, I thought they are Russians. But soon we\nfind out they are Americans. And that was, I believe, 90\" or 97\" division of that army,\nGeneral George Patton, God give him heaven, George Patton, General George Patton. He\nis my, how should I say, he saved my life.",

And then when we was free, we go back to that little city.\nAnd right away, the American takes -- take care of us, you know? They open a kitchen,\nthey feed us, they give us cigarettes.

I was -- now, I -- I\nwas anxious to see her, you know, and how she lives, you know, and whether she gonna\ntake me back. So -- so I eat that time, from the first day I eat. So I starts slowly, you\nknow, you can\u2019t overeat it. But after awhile, you know, I eat day and night, wherever I\ncan find the food, you know, I eat. So I was strong enough after three weeks, and I pedal\nto Austria. First I come to a friend of mine, another friend, Eddie. I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t have\nenough guts, you know, go by myself to Frieda\u2019s father farm, you know? So I took with\nme Eddie, friend of mine.

And when she saw me she s-start screaming, Julius,\nJulius is here. Frieda was sitting on the back porch, you know, when she hear that name\nshe couldn\u2019t believe it, you know, that\u2019s me. She was thinking, you know I -- I was dead,\nyou know, because they -- they -- they -- they hear, you know, what they was doing in the\nconcentration camp, by their evacuation, and she had pretty good idea from Ravensbrick,\nyou know, how that treatment was, see?

They were friendly, and I don\u2019t know what they was\nthinking about me, but Frieda was, you know, in a different position, see, wi -- number\none, she was from a rich family. And the small village knows, you know, she was in a\nconcentration camp, why she was there, they know. So that time, you know, you come to\nthe small village like that where the people know each other, you know, and this -- it\u2019s\nlittle bit sensitive, let\u2019s put it this way. So Frieda go through something, you know,\ndifferent. To me it didn\u2019t make much difference.",
        "A: Bigger, yeah, backhoe, backhoe, bigger, something like that yeah. I was working very\ngood job, and I lived privately, and any time I had chance I visit Frieda, Frieda visit me,\nyou know, and we prepared to --",
        "A: -- get married. There was no other way, see? The -- the only thing is, gonna be a little\nbit hard, you know, because I have to face her father and ask him, and I did. Not by\nmyself, there was a -- another husband from Frieda\u2019s sister, mar -- Margaret husband.\nAnd he says, \u201cJulian, I go with you to father, you know, and ask, you don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d So\nwe go, both of us, you know and I ask. And the first thing you know, he ask me, what\nyou gonna do? How you plan your life? [indecipherable]. We got plenty land, we can\ngive you piece of land, and we got lum-lumber, you know, build up the house if you want\nto stay here. And I says no, no, I got my family in United States.

See, but in a small village like that, you are a\nforeigner, you know? They might say, okay, he\u2019s a good man, you know, and this and\nthis, you know, but you gonna be foreigner forever. Y-You see what I mean? That\u2019s why\nthere was only one way for us to -- after we get married. Then he give his okay, yeah,\nokay, so long you go United States. Yeah, you got your family, I hope you take care of\nmy daughter. I says don\u2019t worry about that, yes I will, I promise, you know.

        "A: No, at that time, I liked to go to Poland, but that time there was a Communist regime\nand I thought, you know, they might keep me there. So I didn\u2019t take a chance, but an --\nafter 1960, I decided, for good or for bad, I decided to go and see my mother. That was\nexactly 21 years when I saw her last time. And that was at Christmastime, shortly before\nChristmas, and that was the nicest Christmas for me and for my mother to see each other,\nand she was so happy to see me. And then I stay nine days in Poland. Then I go back to\nAustria, I stay there on a -- on a -- nine, 10 days there, then I come back and everything\nwas all right, and I was glad I -- I saw my mother. And she was happy to see me, and she\nknow that we got good living here in United States because she was here before. Matter\nof fact, she was three times here when she was single, you know. She traveled back and\nforth, you know, then third time when she come [indecipherable] she married my father.",

He had to sign the affidavit\nof support, and he did sign the paper and that\u2019s what we come to my father and that was\n1948 in March. First time I saw my father.",

Before we come, we stay in a -- in a -- ina --\nwe was waiting for -- for visa and -- and the American, they teach us -- they tell us, you\nknow, what is that -- what kind of a life we\u2019re gonna have in a -- America. You got all\nkind of opportunity, 1f you want to work, if you want to save, you can be millionaire, if\nyou want it. See? That was very excited. And then -- then the boat come, you know, and\nwe go on a boat. Oh, what a good food we had, you know. So many people were sick, I\nnever was sick. I eat for two, for three, you know, my gosh, you know, and I was big that\ntime, you know, I weighed, I don\u2019t know, I weighed 220 - 240 pounds. Yeah. So when I\nSaw -- was very excited when it come to New York. That was, I think, March 22\u21224, J\nthink, in 1948 when -- when we saw the statue, liberty statue. I had a tears in my eye.\nAnd you understand why.",
        "A: When we saw the Statue of Liberty, we say, God bless America, this is the free\ncountry and this is Statue of Liberty. What I hear so much about the Statue of Liberty\nfrom my mother, for years. You know how emotional it was? I can\u2019t explain.",
        "A: No, no, we had a ticket straight to Utica because my father was living in New York\n[indecipherable] with his outs -- outskirt Utica and we had a train ticket there, and the --\nthe next day we come to Utica, the first time I saw my father.",
        "A: You know, it\u2019s hard to explain. Tha-That was a -- it is a good question, though. You\nsee, I didn\u2019t grow up with my father, I never saw him, you know? I think my father more\nas a Close friend than father. I can\u2019t help it, you know? And he was strong, gosh you\nknow, and we look like a brother, you know. So I think I\u2019m more like a brother. And he\nwas good to -- to me. There wasn\u2019t many discussion, family discussion you know, and\nthis, you know, about I was in between, you know.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, we -- yeah, I told him, I explain him, you know, what it was. I was --\nspent some time in a concentration camp. Yeah, well, too bad, too bad. Well, he says, this\nis fault -- your mother fault, you know, she shouldn\u2019t go to Europe, you know, she should\nstay there. Well, on one hand I agree with him, on the other hand I disagree, see, because\nthere was some other reason that she couldn\u2019t stay here, see? Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, first three months were stay with -- with my father, and right away they give us\nthe job, wi -- was -- Frieda was learning how to weaving, and I was working 1n a -- ina\nfactory, clothing factory, you know [indecipherable]. And I make a good money at that\ntime, and we stay three months with my father, you know it\u2019s a little bit crowded. So after\nthree months we get a small apartment in Utica on blandin -- Blandina Street, yeah, I\nnever forget that upstairs vi -- over the grocery stores. That was the Italian grocery stores,\nJerry, yeah. And we was so happy, my gosh, on our own in United States. Even in a small\napartment, we were so happy, so free. And then we was working and start saving some\nmoney. Then in 1952 -- no, \u00b051 I think, we bought a small farm there, about 15 kilometer\n-- 15 miles from here, Vernon Center. And we had some chicken, about three or 400\nchickens and some cattle. And we were -- Frieda worked on the farm, I worked on the\nconstruction and in the evening I worked on the farm and -- and we was very happy, you\nknow, that -- I -- I [indecipherable] it is the same thing like in Austria, somewhat. Little\nbit different, but we got the own farm, see. But we had that farm for five years, then I\nalways had it in my mind, you know, to go to my monument business, because that\u2019s\nwhat I learned in Flossenbirg, you know, cut the stones, you know. I was -- that helped\nme too, because I -- really I know when I talk about myself how good I was, but I was\ngood s -- good stoneconner -- cutter. And when you\u2019re a good stonecutter you get a little\nbit more food, you know, and that\u2019s what was very important, that\u2019s what my friend gave\nme advice, you know, if you -- if you w-work -- do good, and many times, you know,\nthey give me special jobs, you know, very co-complicated job, and I did it, you know,\nand I belong -- I used to belong to the best stonecutters there in Flossenburg. Yes, so I go\nto the monument business here. I stotes -- I start [indecipherable] I start with a small\nmonument business, and after 15 years I go for the big business, and like you see right\nhere when you look at it through the window, that\u2019s our business here, Monument Place,\nand from then up to now we do very good, and now my son Ricky take over, and I just go\nonce awhile, you know, help him out a little bit.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. I\u2019d -- I tell you the truth, I used to like better stonecutting than work in a\nbakery. I didn\u2019t like the dough and flour, you know, and dust, you know\u201d? But you got\ndust with the stones too, but -- yes, I -- I like and I like monument business and 1s very\ninteresting because every day you got something else to cut, different flowers, different\nsculpture, you know, and lettering and this, you know, and this 1s very, very interesting\ncause there\u2019s no end to it.",
        "A: O-O-Oh yes, oh yes, that -- that, to be honest with you, takes not -- I should say about\n10 years, say, because naturally there 1s a entirely different country than Germany or\nPoland, you know? Different system, different -- even food. And different living you\nknow? And takes a time, long time to adjust you know, to the custom, you know, how do\nit -- how the people live, but you like it. You like it, but you gotta adjusted to it, see?\nSometime you grab something to do -- oh no, in Europe you go -- do -- do different see?\nBut here you do different. Sometimes says no, that\u2019s wrong. No, it isn\u2019t wrong when you\n-- then after you find out, you know, it is right, see? So it takes awhile to adjust, no matter\n-- | think this is same thing, no matter what country you go. It takes time to adjust to the\nsystem, and now, by gosh, after so many years we live in this country, what 50 years?\nGod bless this country, you know? It is the best country on the earth. God bless America.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, and very interesting. Even now, we had several interview, you know,\non that radio station where I got my program every Sunday, was three times there, and\nthen we write article to the local paper, [indecipherable] Dispatch. And many people ask\nus, you know, my gosh [indecipherable] went through, and tell us some more about that.\nSo I\u2019m glad to tell, and a -- very interesting, you know, the younger generation is so\ninterested in this story, you know. They had no idea, you know. First they thought, you\nknow, that only Jews was in a concentration camp, which is true, nobody can say\ndifferent, see. Jew -- Jewish people suffered the most, you know, during the war. That\nwas a really Holocaust for them, and they had no help from nowheres, you know. That\u2019s\ntrue, you know. But also same time, you must say, you know, that many other\nnationalities suffered -- even worse, some of them, you know. You take those people in\nSiberia in Russia. My gosh, what they must went through. Even worse, you see? So we\nare glad to talk about this, you know, and God forbid, you know, that this never happen\nagain, something like that. And young generation, yeah, matter of fact, as you know, I\nwrote the wa -- article of my recollection to the book for the high schools teachings about\nthe Holocaust. I got my six pages there, my story.",
        "A: That book?",
        "A: Oh that was -- oh, well, because, actually the Jewish people start, you know, teaching\nabout the Holocaust for the high schools, see, in New York state. And when we find out\nthat Jewish people gonna -- gonna m-make that book, you know, we also want to be\nthere, y-you know, and tell our story, and we was accepted. And there\u2019s some Catholic\nChristian stories too, in that book. So many people ask if this is true, you know,\nespecially younger people. Is that true, or it 1s just a propaganda? You know, that gets\nyou a little bit. What kind of a propaganda? Th-This not propaganda, I got so many\nevidence, films, books, by gosh, people was there like me, you know. I no lie. I tell -- see,\nwho gon -- whoever gonna listen to this tape, you know, I can\u2019t lie, you know, because\nsomebody can straighten me out, hey wait a minutes. You -- you -- you lie about this, or\nsomething like that. So we give you that -- that -- that true story where we was going,\ntrue, and what we saw, what we experience that time.",
        "A: I think -- I think it 1s enough books and mention about the Polish people suffered\nduring the second World War. Don\u2019t forget. But that was a -- we say six millions Jewish\npeople losted their life during the second war. Oh my gosh, about six million Polish\npeople, Christian people sacrificed their life during that war. So maybe -- maybe this is\nnot the -- how should I say it? This is a little -- a little bit difficult question. But maybe it\nis -- maybe doesn\u2019t -- maybe -- maybe the history doesn\u2019t say enough, you know, about\nPolish people, and not only Polish people, what about other nationalities? What about\nRussian? What about the other nationalities suffered so many? How many Russians, how\nmany millions, they die, you know? And this -- those people gotta be taken to\nconsideration too, you know. Not only one nationality, see? All of them. And I am glad\nwe had an invitation to Holocaust, to Washington, and we told our story. They treat us\nnice, you know? And I told them the same story what I tell you right now, that -- and\nwe\u2019 re speaking about the Jewish people, yes they suffered the most, and they had no help\nfrom nobody, yeah. So we was a little bit more lucky, you know, let\u2019s put it this way.",
        "A: Yeah, Richard was born 1951, in January. Yeah, and he grow up here as a hundred\npercent American, okay? And he\u2019s still single, he is with us. He got his house next to us,\nhe bought a house, he living in his own house. And he take over our monument business\nand he work there. And he had a college, yeah, educated. And daughter Frieda, she\u2019s also\n-- oh my gosh, how many languages she speak? She even speak the sign sa -- language\nand she\u2019s a foreman for the organization for the deaf people. Right now she 1s in New\nYork City, there for a whole week. She got a meeting there. And she 1s close to us, she\nlive in Syracuse. And we got nice two children and two grandchildren, yeah. And we are\nvery, very happy. It wasn\u2019t so easy. There was a hard working, you know. Frieda was\nworking hard, I was working hard. So we come to this, what we today got, you know, we\nare not millionaire, we -- we are not rich. But we make a good living and we are very\nhappy.",
        "A: Ah, this is another tough question, yeah, and I have to tell you that true. Yes, many\ntimes come to me, and to be honest with you, sometime I not believe that happen to me, I\ngo through this, you know, that wasn\u2019t me. Then I think, you know, yes, that was me. I\ngo through this. I give you example. How can you feel, let\u2019s say January, February, you\nknow, you\u2019re co -- you work 10 hours, wintertime I was working 10 hours in a quarry.\nYou come, they counted you, somebody\u2019s missing, okay? The wind blows, snow, cold,\nbelow zero, you know? You stay without a hat, you stay [indecipherable] what that\nmeans, attention?",
        "A: Yeah. And they count and count, one prisoner 1s missing and you stay there for two,\nthree hours, hungry and cold, don\u2019t move. How can you this explain to anybody what that\nis? So, those days, you know, happened many times. Coming back to me. I says, how can\nyou -- or how can you go through this? This is impossible, yeah. That was possible.\nYeah, so sa -- those -- yeah, every time you see those faces, you know, familiar faces, SS,\ncommandant, inspection, you know.",

No. I always got answer for myself and Frieda\nsame thing, you know. Thanks God. Could be a worse, you know. But time to time you\nknow, it comes, you know. Some happenings, you know, what is hard to believe, even for\nme, even for me, I saw it with my own eye what happened, you know? Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Sometime yes, sometime, just a -- so much, you know, they ask, yeah, how was it,\nyeah, this and this, yeah. And then -- but actually, we not talk much about that, see? But\nme and Frieda, many time you know, we got the breakfast, okay, we got ham and eggs --\nham and eggs, and good bread, you know, good coffee, [indecipherable] you know. Did\nyou ever think, you know, we gonna live again, you know, like people live? Did you ever\nthink we gonna have breakfast like that? Or sometime for dinner, you know, a good\nsteak, you know, a pork roast, you know, my gosh, you know how much you give in a\nconcentration camp if you can have just a little bone out of it, you know? So we -- we\ntalk so -- with Frieda when the children are not here, we says, gosh, you know, we talk\nhow it was.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: We\u2019re still in contact with a few others. One of them is a very close friend to me, Dr.\nJake Terry, T-e-r-r-y. He 1s a doctor in New York City, and he is very active in ex-\nprisoners organization, he go [indecipherable] every year. He had -- they had meetings,\nyou know, and they make lots of changes there in a concentration camp. Like I said, the -\n- the Laundromat was located in a -- in a washroom where we used to take a shower. All\nthe electric factory was located in a kitchen, our kitchen used to be. And some French\ncompany built up the little factory there, right in a concentration camp. And Jake didn\u2019t\nlike that, and I didn\u2019t like that, and we discussed it, and Jake, with the rest of it --\nmembers of that organization, they put the pressure on the Bavarian government to\neliminate those private -- or in a commandanture, there was a regular, people was living\nthere, you know, like a apartment, they change for the apartment. So those people was\nmove and they gonna remodel that building inside, and they gonna keep it as a museum,\nsee? And the washroom gonna be remodel inside, they moved the Laundromat, and the\nkitchen and the appelleplatz, the square where we used to ha -- you know, when we\nwould get together, you know, the -- the appelleplatz, you know, it\u2019s gonna be cleaned,\nsome trees gonna -- bushes gonna be cut, and you know -- and they gonna bring it to the -\n- more to the same look as it was that time, you know.

        "A: Oh yes, several times, yes, yes. The first time was the worst. When I came to the little\nmuseum what they got in there by the cremation there, not far away. Then I looked at it,\nall pictures, the commandant and the -- how the prisoners was working in a quarry and\nthis and this, then in the middle I saw the pretty good size picture there, and there was a\nbunch of prisoners, and there was a kapo, and -- and -- and they was receiving the soup.\nAnd guess what? I recognize myself. Then I almos -- I almost fainting, you know, I -- I\ncouldn\u2019t believe it, I called Frieda na -- says, \u201cFrieda, look at this picture, and you see\nanything unusual?\u201d She looked at it closer, she says, \u201cJulian, that\u2019s you.\u201d Second in a --\nin a first row, you know, yeah. And then -- then I remember, you know, and we go -- that\nwas the first day in a -- in a -- a quarry. After two weeks where we was on a\n[indecipherable] block, the newcomers blocks, you know, we was there 14 days, that\u2019s\nthe time, you know, the SS officer ask me, you know, if I know why I am here, you\nknow, and -- yeah. And then -- then I remember there was a small -- we make a joke\n[indecipherable] I remember this exactly, you know, because usually the SS was tall\nguys, you know, and this, but that photographer SS man, he was a -- a little guy, red hair.\nAnd he had a big camera, you know, like a accordion, black one. And he make the\npicture and says, no wonder -- we make a joke out of it, no wonder, you know, they no\nwant him on the front, you know, this -- he\u2019s got the right job just to make a picture. And\nthat picture -- who knows how, you know, survive and I\u2019m -- and this is the best evidence\nyou know, if somebody says no, you wasn\u2019t there. And why I -- this is very interesting --\nwhy I know that was the first day in the quarry, because we had a -- a wooden -- wooden\nshoes, you know, wooden soles. And then a -- and that same day I was -- they gave me to\nthe kettakommando, we -- we climbed a -- in a quarry, you know, on a stone, and we\u2019 ll\nput the ke -- chains around the big blocks and the crane pull them out from the -- from the\nquarry. And they give us leather shoes. So that first day, I\u2019m standing there with wooden\nshoes that I know that was from August, let\u2019s say 17 - 18, August 18, ni -- 1942, see, the\npicture was made. And I\u2019m on that picture.",
        "A: Oh gosh, the -- for a long time I no want to go there. I told you the truth. I didn\u2019t want\nto see it. I was scared, you know? But then we decided, me and my family, Frieda,\ndaughter Frieda and son Richard to go. And that was -- I believe, you know, I can\u2019t tell\nyou exactly the -- whether -- that was ninese -- 1980 -- \u201983 - \u201984, I come first time to the\nFlossenburg. Was everything change, you know. The trees growing you know, bushes\ngrowing, then I see their factories there, then the -- all barracks gone, they got the one\nfamily houses, you know, where the barracks was there. I didn\u2019t like it.",
        "A: The daughter -- daughter Frieda want to run away, you know, from that concentration\ncamp. She couldn\u2019t -- you know, she was shaking, you know, and she couldn\u2019t believe it\nwhen she saw the cremation oven, you know, it\u2019s still there, you know, untouched, yeah.\nAnd when she saw that, she knew, and she see those pictures, see my picture over there,\nshe want to run away. But we make videotapes there and they stay, then -- then after that\nwe go -- we go Germany, Austria, most every two, three years we go there, you know, we\nstill go on there, you know, because Frieda got some relatives there, sisters. And when\nwe go there, naturally, we stop in Flossenburg, you know, just look at, you know, and --",
        "A: Is -- is interesting though.",
        "A: Yes, because I -- I was talking to some people, they were there. And I says, you\nshould go, you should see, there\u2019s -- everything is change, but a few houses, you know,\nand a few things are still there. It is a beautiful chapel build up from the towers, you\nknow, watch towers. Beautiful chapel. And I thought, my gosh, maybe I should go and\nsee that place and go to that chapel and thank God, you know, we survive, you know. So\nwe go and I\u2019m glad we go, we -- we saw and after that we go almost every two years\nthere, and we stop there, and that most important to be there, that was 50 anniversary, you\nknow, when the concentration camp was free, liberated. And you wouldn\u2019t believe --\nbefore we go there -- first I thought I don\u2019t know, should we go or not? But, one of the\nguy from Arizona, his name 1 -- was Bob Hager, he find out about me in a United States\nHolocaust -- he saw the movie, and he called me, and he -- over the telephone he\nintroduce himself and he says, \u201cI\u2019m the one from the Third Army, I open the gate there,\nin concentration camp Flossenbirg.\u201d I says, \u201cOh my gosh. Thanks. Where you live?\u201d Oh,\nhere in Arizona, I retired, so and so, and wa -- I was in a 97 division of Third Army,\nGeneral George Patton. So this gonna be 50 anniversary and I\u2019m in contact with the\nMunich government there, with the minister, and I got invitation and probably you gonna\nget invitation too. And we should go, and we should meet there. I says, okay, we go.\nYeah, then I go with the whole family. But before, I says, I want to do something. Then I\ncall Bob, and I told him over the telephone what I want to do. Some kind of mark, like a\nbronze plaque, to thank Third Army for liberation. He says, yes, that\u2019s a good idea. I\ngonna call up Munich and I gonna tell them, you know, and they gonna find a place\nwhere they want to put that -- that plaque. Good, good idea. So he called me back, he\nsays, yes I already -- I already talked to minister so and so in Munich. I says, good idea,\nand that plaque what Julian Noga gonna design, we can put it in death valley on a wall.\nThere is a wall there between the chapel and -- and death valley, and he can put it there.\nAnd when he -- when he make this plaque, I give him the help, and they help him, you\nknow, to -- to place that plaque there. Okay. So I design that plaque. I put pretty good\nsize, oh I don\u2019t know, 28 inches by 18 inches high bronze plaque. And then I put in the\nleft corner on top, I put American Sherman tank. Then in right corner on top I put that\nemblem, the -- from that 97 division emblem they had, there is like a fork, like a devil\nfork or something like that, you know? That was the emblem for the division. So I put\nthat emblem in the right corner on top and then I say, well, thanks to the American, you\nknow, for liberation this and this, then I put Julian Noga, number 1623, and other\nprisoners, to thank Americans, see? So when we -- when I -- when I bring that plaque\nover there, I had two workers there, what they take care of that place, and they had the\ndrill, and they, you know, we already told them, you know, how this gonna be put in the\nwall, in the granite wall. And they drill up the -- for me, four holes, you know, and I set\nthat plaque myself with my own hand there. And that was something so -- so -- Saturday\nand Sunday there was a big doing, speeches, you know, and people coming from all over,\nex-prisoners, you know, there was -- they say was about 7,000, I don\u2019t know it was 7,000\nthere. There was Dr. Jack Terry there, there was -- with his daughter, and there was Paul\nWash there -- Wash, he was with his wife, and there was some other prisoners there from\nNew York City, from Poland come in whole -- two buses come in from Poland, ex-\nprisoners, and for German ex-prisoners, and from all Czechoslovaks, Russians, you\nknow, from all over, lots of flowers, some speeches, you know, and that was very, very\ninteresting. And we had a special praying that chapel, there was a German bishop, you\nknow, special prayer for all of us, you know. That was very -- and the Jewish people had\na nice ceremony there, by the Jewish monument and also they had prayer and we was\nwith them and that was very emotional, you know, we -- we feel like brothers, you know?\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you are Jewish or German or Polish or whatever, or Czechs, or\nFrench, you know? We was like -- like brothers, you know? We respect each other\nbecause only we know what we was going through.",
        "A: So -- excuse me, I didn\u2019t finish yet, yeah. And the Bob was there, the Bob Hager, he\nwas there and when it come time, you know, the plaque was covered with the white cloth.\nWhen it come time, the -- Bob Hager and me, we unveiled that plaque in death valley\nthere, where the execution they had almost every day there, you know, with so many\npeople die over there, and that was a great moment you know. And Bob Hager lay\nbeautiful -- with his wife Peggy, he lay a beautiful flowers there by that plaque and that\nwas very -- he put, and then after that there was a program, you know, and there was\nmany speeches there from different nationalities, you know? And even the mayor from\nFlossenburg, he says, I am 56 years old, I was born after the war. I\u2019m sorry, you know,\nthat you people have to got through this. I\u2019m sorry that our quiet, willa -- village come on\na map as a certain -- as such a bad place. He had a nice speech, and says, of course, we\nare not responsible for this what happen in our quiet village, but also we got that black\nspot in our history. I\u2019m sorry for that. Such a beautiful speech he had.",
        "A: Oh, my gosh, there was a -- there was another -- another mayor from Ravensbrick,\nthere was some high officials, you know, and they come -- they follow us, they ask us\nquestion. And television cameras and -- and a radio -- those people from the radio station,\nyou know. Gosh, we was so busy, you know, and they ask question, you know, and that\nwas very interesting, you know, very interesting. And again I say that usually younger\ngeneration, you know, that was so -- for them that was so interested, you know, what it\nwas, that -- Flossenbuirg concentration camp.",
        "A: Yes, well this 1s -- I got my own explanation for myself, see? That was a wartime, and\ngosh in a wartime, many, man -- this no -- no war, you know, is honest on either side, you\nknow. And during the wartime so many people had it worse, maybe worse than -- than --\nthan -- than me, you know, like take any Jewish family, you know, like I meet -- even the\nDr. Terry, you know, he losted a whole family there, he is by himself. And many other\nJewish people, you know, they losted their whole family, you know? And also some\nPolish people losted their family in a concentration camp, and -- and was -- you know,\nthere could be a worse, you know, but maybe of this experience I explain myself, what\nwe was going through, maybe make a -- maybe this experience make me a better man,\nyou know, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so busy, you know, with this social organization, you\nknow, and I try help other people. And I try tell the people that life can be a different, you\nknow. And, you know, it bothers me when I see that the American, you know, make a\ndemonstration, and sometime they burn the American flag, you know, that hurts. I -- I\nsay, people, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. You don\u2019t know that the life can be a\ndifferent. And matter of fact, you know, if I was young boy when the older people says,\nyou know, what they was going through the first World War, I laugh and I says, ah what -\n- they say they eat rotten potatoes, you know and this and this. My gosh, it\u2019s happen, I no\nhave to wait long enough and I eat rotten potatoes. I -- and this is hard to believe, why\nrotten potatoes? I tell you why. When a potatoes is rotten, you cut the bad -- bad part out\nof it, and rest of it 1s little bit yellish -- brownish, you know? Rotten potatoes is sweeter,\nand healthy potatoes is bitter, that\u2019s why. So I remember what the older people says, we\nused -- then we was so hungry we eat the rotten potatoes. Yes, I understand, now, see? So\n-- but when a -- when it comes -- you know, at that time, I didn\u2019t pay my -- m-much\nattention, you know, oh gosh, there was a first World War. So what? So what? They was\nborn in wrong time, you know, I was born after the war, you know, I\u2019m lucky. But by\ngosh I not have to wait too long -- too long, you know, to go maybe even worse what\nthey was going through. See, then I find out -- that\u2019s why, you know, that experience, that\nlife what we had, maybe make a be -- better man out of me, you know? Maybe I\nappreciate it more, what we had, you know, the life, the freedom, you know. What is\nreally important.",
        "A: Well, first when we come -- when we come to this country, there was that time, you\nknow, when President Truman was president, and a -- of United States, and he made that\nPresident Truman Act, you know, for the DP persons, for the -- for those people who\ncouldn\u2019t go back to the Communist country, you know, so they -th-the border was open\nfor -- to this country you know, and here in Utica, besides me, come in -- many, many\npeople come in. Some of them was in the concentration camp, but most of them, you\nknow, they was working in the -- on the farms, like I was working on a farm first, and in\nthe factories, you know? Then we -- well, we come to this country like I told you from\nthe beginning you know, e-everything was strange over here, was beautiful but strange.\nSo we organize ourselves, and I was one of the co-organizer 1-in this organization. We\nnamed that organization the newcomer\u2019s organization, see? So we started making shows,\nyou know, and whatever money we had, we have some orphans in Germany, some\nwidows, you know, the money was going, you know? There was like a charity\norganization. And thanks God, you know, I was 35 years president of this organization.\nThen I organized another organization what is Kopernik Memory Association. So my\nidea was to have another organization with the Polish background, you know, to tell us\nabout the Polish history, you know, Polish culture. And same time we collect enough\nmoney, you know, on 45,000 dollars, and we build up the beautiful statue here in Utica.\nThat was my idea, I must say, Kopernik statue, 21 feet high and stays right in the center\nof the city of Utica, across the street from the Munson Proctor Ins -- Institute -- museum,\nsee. And I\u2019m very proud about that, and we had other people, you know, I like. Then I\nstart radio program, Polish and international music I play every Sunday for two hours on\nthe local station here, on the other side woods there, you know, I can walk over there, you\nknow, I live close to it. And this is my hobby and I\u2019m very happy, you know, very busy\nyou know, between radio station organization, I belong to quite a few of them, and our\nbusiness, you know. Keep me busy, I get no ol -- no time to get old.",
        "A: This is a -- a very delicate question, you know. I grow up with the Jewish people, as I\ntold you from the beginning, you know. Matter of fact, I had the Jewish girl, we was very\nclose with the -- nothing was there, not -- we was not in love, no, absolutely. But we\ngrow up together and thanks God, you know, she survive, you know. She had the\nChristian paper, she emigrate to Germany. She was working on a farm in Germany, as a\nPolish girl and she married a Polish guy, you know, and her father was killed, and --\nduring the war, and her mother was killed, too, you know, and she was the only one there,\nyou know. So we grow up with the Jewish people and I had nothing against the Jewish\npeople there in -- in -- in Poland, absolutely, you know. That was a -- more like a\ntradition, you know, if you want to buy something you go in a Jewish store, you know,\nyou buy, you know, you get good deal, you know? But -- and Jewish people in Poland, I\nthink there was about three and a half -- three and a half million Jewish people in Poland,\nyou know. There was more Jewish people in Poland that time than today in Israel, see?\nAnd -- and they had businesses, they had heavy industry that was in Jewish hand, too,\nand I think they was treating, you know, very well, they -- we had doctor and -- doctors\nand professors and scientists and all kind of -- you know, and that was -- that was -- I\nthink they was treating good. But here, after years, time to time, I see some articles in the\npaper that -- that we aren\u2019t -- that we are, Polish people, anti-Semitic. Now, this is, to me,\na little bit hurts me this, this accusation. Because I wasn\u2019t anti-Semitic. I live -- I had a\nfriend, Jewish friend, and I still got Jewish friend here. Jake Terry is a example. I have\nhere in Utica many Jewish people are good friends, close friends. And that hurts\nsometime when they accuse us, you know, to -- that the Polish people are anti-Semitic,\nyeah. Well, gosh, you know, I don\u2019t know what they mean. Well, this happened -- see,\nour -- somebody, you know, another Christian make a denunciation on me, you know,\nabout the [indecipherable] what I tell you about, you know? How about Frieda, you\nknow, some people make a denunciation. So you got bad people here, here, and I believe,\nyou know, maybe that was some anti-Semitic, you know, in -- in Poland between some\nkind of people, you know, not -- not me, you know. And when you say the Polish people,\nthen you talk about all Polish people, that I\u2019m included, ex -- as a -- as a -- a -- froma\nPolish background, you know? And we -- I think we shouldn\u2019t say that, that -- you know.\nI believe that some people was anti-Semitic and maybe today you -- you -- you\u2019Il find\nthem, see? Like you find here in this country, anti-American people, right? Yeah? When I\nlisten to -- to Rush Limbaugh, you know, I wonder -- I wonder, you know, what kind of\nan American he is, you know, when he called our president stupid, and a liar and this and\nthis, call him name, you know? That\u2019s for me -- that hurts me, too, you know? I mean,\nthis 1s a very delicate -- delicate question, you know, between the Christian and Jewish\npeople in Poland. But I think that Poland opened the border for seven century, when the\nother countries, you know, chase out the Jewish, you know, like Spain or other countries\nchase out the Jewish people, Poland take them, you know, and for seven century, the\nJewish people was in Poland. And my gosh, you know, maybe there was some incidents,\nyou know, I don\u2019t know about that, see? But as I remember, you know, like y-you take a -\n- even little city like Struchin or Tarnow. My gosh, the -- most of the population was\nJewish population and the businesses, most of them was in Jewish hands. So that was, I\nthink, I don\u2019t know if you -- if you say criticize, this is -- I-I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t got no\nanswer, you know.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. I worked first shift, she worked second shift, or the other way. She\nworked first shift and I worked second shift, th -- so we was with -- one of us, you know,\nwas with the children, see?",
        "A: Was kind of tough, but we didn\u2019t know the difference and we do our best, and by gosh\nyou know, we was thinking, you know, to let the children grow in a -- in a good house,\nyou know, and later on they get good education and we was very successful with this,\nthanks God.",
        "A: No, Frieda, which is our ol -- older -- older daughter, let\u2019s put it this way. Yeah, she\nwas born in Austria. She go high school, then she take some courses, you know, like\ntypewriting and shorthand. And she was very good with the languages, so she speak\nfluently, she take German in the high school. She speak fluently German, fluently Polish,\nEnglish. And after she get married she take another course to speak sign language. And\nnow she has good job in Syracuse, New York. And she is the boss there, you know, she\u2019s\ngot a group of people she work for, then -- and she do very good with the sign language.\nAnd she is good for the catch up -- with the languages, to learn, and -- other languages,\nlet\u2019s put it this way. Okay, and Ricky, Ricky was different, you know? She learned a little\nbit German, he can keep the con -- conversation in -- in German and 1n Polish. And he\nfinished the high school, and then she go -- then he go college, yeah. And after he\nfinished the college, he get a good job, he work for the big insurance company as a safety\ninspector. But the insurance 1s -- lately, you know, they change a little bit, and same time\nI need him here for our business, you know, because we want to continue with the\nbusiness after oh, you know, after 40 years I build up that business and I -- I don\u2019t want\nto let it go, so I invite him here, and he is already what, four or fifth year with me, and I\nteach him how to carve, how to do the monuments and he is very, very good 1n that, he\u2019s\ngot a good hand, cause -- because he\u2019s a little painter on the side, you know, that picture\nyou see over here on the wall, that\u2019s his painting right there. Which 1s pretty good, I -- I\nshould say. So in the monument business, he is pretty artistic and he\u2019s got new idea and\nput the new designs, new flowers, new carvings, you know, he is good for that, and I\u2019m\nglad, you know, so the name stays in business after I go, see?",
        "A: Well, like I said, you know, he had a -- after he fini -- finished the college, he had a\npretty good job there in Michigan there. And that was going good for awhile, then getting\na little bit slowdown and [indecipherable] and when he come home we had a good\ndiscussion over here, and I told him simply, you know, I getting older, you know, and\nhere is the business, you know, everything, all the equipment, trucks, all equipment, you\nknow, just -- what you need just to start working, you know, and I teach you, you know?\nHe had pretty good idea though, because he grow up actually, into the business. But no\nmatter what, you know, you\u2019ve got to practice, and you know, you got to learn. So -- and\nhe was -- he learned quick, you know, how to do that monument job, see? Yeah, so he is\npretty good with it and I am glad.",
        "A: The -- the big -- big day for us, me and Frieda was when we become citizens of this\ncountry. I get my paper in 1956 and she\u2019s got her citizenship paper, \u201958 -- eight? \u201957.\nThat was the great moment, you know, when we become American citizens, you know.\nAnd this is a -- a very touchy -- I should say privilege, you know, for anybody love this\ncountry. And number two, for the first time in my life, you know, when it comes election,\nyou know, so we can go to the election place, and we can vote, you know, that means so\nmuch to us. So that day, afternoon is off by us, like a holiday. We dressed up. I never go\nwithout a tie, you know, to vote, you know, this special privilege to me. And we feel very\ncomfortable we can vote, because we never vote before. So that was -- yeah, that was the\nwa -- couple highlights which occur, you know, in our life, you know, speaking about the\ncitizenships and -- and all the [indecipherable]. Then, of course, you know, our 25\"\nanniversary of marriage, then 50 anniversary of the marriage, quite some time ago, that\nwas a highlights, too. And many times happen in organization who I belong, they gave\nme some certificate for the good job, you know. They make a special banquet for us.\nThere was one banquet for that 50 anniversary of liberation of concentration camp. The\nPolish community make a special banquet for us, we had about 250 people, and many\ncongratulation and there was a high official from the county, from the city, and\ncongratulate us. And that was very interesting to us, we turn a little bit back, you know,\nto accept a invitation from United States Holocaust in Washington, D.C.. I must say that\nwas very interesting, and very important to us to tell our story for the future generation,\nyou see? And I must say there, in Holocaust, they treat us like a royal, you know? Really,\nyou know, we enjoy every minute there, when we was there and something like\nHolocaust -- United States Holocaust in Washington, this is very important and I give\ncredit to the organizer that\u2019s -- that -- that -- that m-miserable time we lived through,\nsecond World War, that is not forgotten, you know, that is somehow documented, you\nknow, right there, and this is United States Holocaust in Washington, and I give a credit\nto those people, organizers, donors -- and we are donors of -- a-also. Yeah. Sometime I\nmix, you know, word German, you excuse me, when I speak English.",
        "A: Well, first of all, we -- we gave some money, donation, yeah, yeah. Couple times --",
        "A: Yes, we gave many pictures, that\u2019s what they ask us for, from our families, from the\nconcentration camp. And also I have to make a -- how should I say, I diverse my jacket,\nyou know, that striped jacket from concentration camp. I had that original striped jacket,\nand by many occasion, whether 1n a church or by many occasion, I wore that jacket, you\nknow, when I had a speech, when -- when that was something about the Holocaust. And\nwhen I come in Washington, you know, they tell me, make sure bring that jacket. So I did\nbring that jacket there. And you know, that was some kind -- I -- was hard to -- to give\nthat jacket because you know, this was like a diverse you know? That jacket keep me\nwarm, you know, there in concentration camp, and I have to -- but I thought, on the other\nhand, okay, this is the right place for the jacket, you know, so the future generation can\nsee what kind of a clothing you had. How I was dressed up, see? Yeah, and that was --\nthat was a little bit emotional.",
        "A: Like for ins --",
        "A: -- like for instance, the -- the -- that -- that organization like [indecipherable] I -- I am\nco-founder. Have about a hundred, over a hundred members, you know, and strictly work\nfor charity, you know? We help some poor people, blind people, you know, just -- just\nstrictly charity or-organization to get the money for th -- for that purpose, we organize\ntwice a year, sometime three times a year, some kind of dancing, or -- or banquet so we\nget the money for that purpose. This is wa -- wa -- one of the organization. The second\none, I\u2019m also co-founder, that was my idea Kopernik Memorial Association. Now this\norganization is on a different level, it\u2019s not so much charity organization, but it\u2019s a\norganization where they got their own museum and they had so many Polish items. What\nthey demonstrate and show, like for the teacher, for the students, you know, what is this\nabout the Poland, you know, what kind of a country this is, you know, the culture, you\nknow, and this -- and this is -- and then they got films, pictures, a-and scholarship, yeah,\nfor -- for the students, that every year they gave three scholarship to the students.

But these are very high class organization, let\u2019s put it this way. And they\nalso gave me medal and I am there now honorable chairman of this organization. Then,\nalso we belong to the Polish community club. We got quite a good size of Polish ethnic\ngroup here in Utica. We should say probably 28 - 30 percent pe -- Polish people are with\n-- Polish American people with the background, and also the newcomers steady come in,\nsee, to this country, like any others, you know, like Mexican or Italians or any other\n[indecipherable] you know, they come in. That\u2019s why I got the radio program for them,\nyou know, for all of them you know, and play polka, you know, and -- and nice music,\ninternational -- yes. So this is --",

That station itself this year, what is 19 -- what is 2000,\ncelebrate this year their -- their -- their seven -- 75\" anniversary when they start, the very\nfirst station in Utica. They had just the two, three hours daily program, you know, at that\ntime. Then, five years after, which 1s no -- that was 1925 when the radio station, first\nprogram had. Then 1930, friend of mine, the late Mr. Louis Bienkowski, he started that\nPolish American program on that station in 1930, and he had that program for 56 years.\nThen after that, like I said before, his niece took over, and she had it for the while, Maria\nKowalski. And then after, I took over what is oh, good 10 years, and since then piece --\ntil today, I\u2019m still every Sunday there for two hours, from eight to 10 on that station and\nplaying music, advertise some businesses, and we give news -- newses, local and even\nfrom -- from Poland, you know. And people tell me this is very interesting program, I\ndon\u2019t know. I think so. So this is my hobby, and --",

So we both go. Yeah, and that was very interesting, and that was\nmore changes in Poland. They had electricity, they had all over country, they had the new\nroads through the country, the buses was going. They had so many orchards. Before, I\ndidn\u2019t see those orchards too many, you know. And people -- people lived different,\nentirely different.

And when we go there in Austria, as I said before, you know, a stopover in\nGermany, and then we go to Austria and we -- we had a good time, you know, and -- and\nwhen her parents was still alive, their father, I di -- after we come here, I -- father didn\u2019t\nsee any more. He die before I go that time 1960 when I go -- after I visit Poland, I go\nAustria, the mutter -- mother still was there, still living, you know, she was in good\nshape, but retired from -- from the farmhouse, you know. The older si -- daughter\nMargaret had the f-farm. But they got nice villa in the city, see, belongs to the parents.\nAnd she was there, and -- and Frieda\u2019s younger sister across the street had a nice\nrestaurant. I stay overnight there, yeah. And eat good, and good wine, you know?\nAustrian wine, and wiener schnitzel and sauerbraten, you know, whatever. And good\npastry.",
        "A: Yes, they feed me good, you know. That was very interesting and mutter, I\u2019m glad\nbecause m -- I told mutter how we live, you know, and this, and she was very happy, you\nknow, we are together, we make a good living in this country, and she was very happy.\nThen Frieda after that go more often, I don\u2019t know, two, three times she saw her mother\nbefore she died. So they -- they agree with us, you know, for us was no other ways than\ncome United States, you know, make a -- start new life, you know, in this country, which\nwas good, I think. And we appreciate it, and they appreciate it, too. That was appreciated.",
        "A: Yeah, I-I come to New York News, which is by outskirt of Utica, my father was there,\nliving with stepmother, and my brothers was living in Chicopee, Massachusetts, three of\nthem. Matthew, Bruno and John. And time to time, for holidays or during the summer,\neither they come in here, or we go there. And we -- we understand each other, you know,\nin certain extent, because you know, they were here [indecipherable] you know, and they\nwas thinking they are a little bit better than I am, you know, I -- I told you the truth, you\nknow, as a -- so, but they were good. They were good, I can\u2019t complain. Yeah, so they try\nand teach me something, you know, that\u2019s what they want to teach me, I already knew,\nyou know, and -- but we was in a good understanding, you know, between us, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. Two of them. Frieda\u2019s -- their oldest son, our daughter Frieda\u2019s oldest son, our\ngrandson, Todd. He finished college, and he was a -- a -- a -- a very interesting in sport.\nMatter of fact, he was the number two in Syracuse as a soccer player. And he finished the\ncollege, he get the degree, and he become a -- he get a good job there, in Watertown,\nwhat is about hundred miles from here, up north, towards Canadian border. He get the job\nthere, then he meet the beautiful lady, also teacher, Tina, and they get married. They\nalready married over a year, yeah, and no children yet. And they bought the house, and\nthey both teaching, you know, and they -- they make a good living. And Eric, the younger\none, he\u2019s still with mother, live with mother, and go college, yeah. And he is interesting\nsomething in a job like artistic, very -- you know, television, something like that, I don\u2019t\nknow which direction he\u2019s gonna go, but he is a very smart guy, you know. Ah, we\u2019re\nvery proud about those two. And our son Richard, as you see, you talked to him not long\nago, yeah. He\u2019s still single, you know. He not rush to -- to be married, see. And we no\npush him.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That was -- that was for some time the younger generation, American younger\ngeneration, they didn\u2019t know much about the Poland, that was not much to them --- to ye\n-- ye -- I mean, it was not interesting. Besides, you know, Chopin was Polish, you know,\nMaria Curie-Sklodowska, Paderewski was a good artist, and -- and General Kasimir\nPulaski, and [indecipherable] for this country, and General Kasimir Pulaski was wounded\nand died there in Georgia that time in the war, you know, die for this country. They know\na little bit, little bit a-about that, see, but really th-that -- the more interesting was to the\nyounger generation, here in this country, when Holy Father John Paul the second become\nHoly Father as a pole -- Polish cardinal, then the people was more interested where he\ncome from? Ah, he is Polish. What he was doing during the war? Well, this and this, you\nknow, and they -- then they -- they -- and that was interesting, I think, and they was more\ninteresting, you know, to find out, you know, what -- what kind of a country is the\nPoland, you know? I speak generally, you know [indecipherable]. Then a second, when a\n-- when a Communist was -- we think was so strong and we thought, you know, nobody\ngonna fight Communist you know, and the Communist gonna be forever, here a simple\nco -- guy come from the Gdansk, Lech Walesa, and he started that strike what was\nimpossible that time, you know, in any Communist country. He started it and he get 10\nmillion workers behind him. And this is very interesting, without the one shot to be fired,\nyou know, he defeated the Communists, you know. Thanks to him, you know, and the\nHoly Father was helping too, and I must say, that time, President Reagan help also, you\nknow [indecipherable] like he call on Gorbachev, come on, get down with the Berlin\nwall, come on, open the border, you know, and this and this. That was President Reagan\nand he was the first president he called it by name, you know, he called the Communist,\nyou know, devil, or whatever he said, yeah. So this together, you know, of course they\nstudy in Poland, you know. Then that Poland was more interested to the younger ge --\ngeneration, you know, which 1s good to -- to know, these facts, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. To be honest with you, we not talk that much, you know, about this, you know.\nI -- I don\u2019t know, we never discussed this, really, you know. We talk more about, you\nknow, what happened, what you doing, you know, and this and this, but we not go there.\nOnce awhile we talk, you know, how nice was in Austria, and around holidays, you\nknow, they got different style there for the holidays, you know, and also in Poland, you\nknow, so we -- we talk the tradition a little bit, you know, but not too much. Maybe we\nshould talk more about that.",
        "A: Yeah, well, not -- really, I don\u2019t know what to say, yeah, it\u2019s -- it doesn\u2019t come to that,\nyeah.",
        "A: That -- I -- say again, I -- I didn't get you, I --",
        "A: Impact was, yeah.",
        "A: Oh, like I said before, you know, that tells me, you know, that life can be\n[indecipherable] different, see? And that the life itself can be so miserable for many\npeople, not only for me, for many people. And sometime, you know, I think why is it like\nthat? Why -- why was it like that? What I did wrong, you know? Why those people\nsuffered so much, you know? Is that my guilt because I am Polish, is that a guilt because\nI\u2019m Jewish? We didn\u2019t do nothing wrong, just our nationality and that was a crime to\nthem? You see, so you -- you think sometime, instead of world where we live today, you\nknow, is a -- 1S a -- 1S a -- 1S a honest, or sometime, how should I say, dishonest.\nEspecially you know, it bothers me because those people was high ranking, you know, no\nmatter what -- whether that was Communist system, or fa -- fascism, or -- or -- or -- or\nnow, democratic system, they was then high and they still high. Nothing happened --\nactually, nothing happened to them, you know? What happened to regular, average\npeople, they suffered the most, yeah.",
        "A: Independent, Independent, I just vote, and Frieda is more a open Democrat, you know,\nand I in position, you know, because I got the radio program and I got so many friends in\nboth parties, you know? Even in Green party, see? So, I decided to stay Independent, but\nwhen it come to the votes, I look who runs for that office, you know, would I like that\nguy. I listen careful, you know, then I wait, you know, which one -- which -- which one is\nbetter, you know? Then I vote regardless whether he\u2019s Republican, Democrat, or Green.\nYeah, I go by the person, see? Frieda goes strictly Democrat, you know, my wife, yeah.\nBut also sometime, yeah, o-oh, gosh, he\u2019s a Republican, but he\u2019s a good man, yeah,\nmaybe I should vote for him. I says, that\u2019s up to you, that\u2019s up to you. Yeah, so, again,\nthanks God we live here in this beautiful country, and lately now, you know, yesterday\nwe find out that Governor Bush was elected the new president. We wish him very well.\nToo bad you got some winners, you got some losers. That was unusual, we\u2019re waiting 35\ndays after the election and finally we find out who is the president for us, and I -- I hope,\nyou know, he gonna do good and keep this country strong and democratic, you know --\nI\u2019m very, very proud, you know, to be citizens of this beautiful country, United States of\nAmerica. God bless this country.",
        "A: Well, when at that time, you know, what a -- what was it, 1962, when John Kennedy\nwas shot, you know, the president, you know, that makes a big impact on me, you know.\nI-I think on all of us, see, because that shouldn\u2019t happen, you know. That was a big\nimpact, you know, and I feel so sorry, you know, that happened. Otherwise, some other --\nI no see anything special besides. I can\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, we had so many meetings, by gosh, you know, almost every week\nmeeting, you know. So in the evening I like to go for a meeting, you know, and discuss\nthis, whatever they got in the program you know, and I\u2019m pretty active. Which is good\nbecause you meet the people and you work for them, and they do good job, and -- and\nthis 1s a free country, you know, and you can -- you can do -- so long, you know, you no\ndo anything wrong, you know, against the government, you know. And this is good, I like\nthat part and this very interesting to me, and I want to keep myself busy, you know, I -- I\nlike to do. Matter of fact, you know, after we finish this interview, we got a meeting at\nthe Polish community club toda -- tonight, and we gonna elect a new officer, yeah. So we\ngonna vote, you know, that give me another privilege you know, to -- to select, you\nknow, more officers, see? And 1s a pretty good organization. Actually this is a -- to Polish\ncommunity club belongs about 28 organization, different organization are shareholder,\nand we are shareholder, too. And I on a board of directors, see? So, this 1s a very strong\norganization, we got the beautiful club. I was president once for three years, I remodeled\nthat place inside, installed the air conditioner, and you know, new ceiling, new floor and\nnew walls, and there\u2019s many, and by many occasion you got weddings and banquets, and\nwe can handle about 300 people, and there\u2019s a beautiful -- this a old building, but inside\nis beautiful atmosphere, you know, remodel everything. Thanks to me, I should say. No, I\noverdo it. But I was the president, and that was my suggestion to remodel that place,\nbecause that was a old style, you know, and now the younger people, when they get\nmarried, you know, they want to go in a decent place, you know, have a wedding, you\nknow, because they make a picture, you know, and this and this. So I thought that\u2019s a\n[indecipherable] time, you know, to remodel this place. No air conditioner, there was no\nair conditioner, oh, got to be. So I installed two air condition there. And it is a place\nwhere, you know, what -- that people can go. Not only Polish people, but also, you know,\nAmericans, you know. And 1s -- I\u2019m very proud I belong there, yeah.",
        "A: You\u2019re welcome, you\u2019re welcome.\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: That was a short after we ca -- we came to this country. There was many others -- s --\npeople come from Germany, Austria, Italy, England, so called displace -- displaced\npersons. And we thought that time that we need an organization, we should be organize.\nYou know, work together, help each other, and so -- and so we or -- organize, I am the\nco-founder of White Eagle Association here in Utica, New York. And this is an\norganization, a charity organization like I said yesterday and exists already 50 years. We\njust celebrated 50 anniversary of founding that organization. And that organization is also\na member of Polish American Congress.",
        "A: Well, you see, after the war -- oh -- oh, after the war was ended, there\u2019s -- there was so\nmany widowers, so many invalids, you know, people unable to work. And we organize\nsome doings, some banquets and shows, and collect some money, and we helped those\npeople. And also we help some children, you know, the orphans. And -- and stick\ntogether, and -- and also w-work together to -- not to be lost in this big country, as it 1s,\nUnited States, see? And I think we did a good job, and I was president for 35 years in that\norganization, I\u2019m very proud, and this is a very well known, fine organization -- charity\norganization.",
        "A: Yes, local, but also we got delegates to the Polish American congress. Polish\nAmerican congress 1s national-wide organization connected with the Polish American\nalliance organization, what is a -- a very big, more like a insurance organization. Matter\nof fact, we had insurance, many of us. We had insurance, life insurance, yeah, from th --\nfrom this organization. And we got one president from both Polish American alliance,\nand Polish American congress. This is one president, a very fine man. I had a chance to\ntalk to him. He was our honorable guest in White Eagle Association when we celebrate a\nyear ago our 50 anniversary. Matter of fact, I was sitting next to him, and I show him my\nindentity card from American Holocaust, you know, United States Holocaust, and he was\nvery interested. And then I had a interview with him after, and also I put on my radio\nprogram. That interview was very interesting. Now, Polish American congress have\nlobby in Washington, D.C., and Polish American congress was working hard so that --\nthat Poland become a mem -- member of NATO organization. And now still the Polish\nAmerican congress work hard to help somehow, that the Poland be a member of United\nEurope, what is very important. And also, the Polish American congress had a -- a --\nmany people in different way financially as -- for the needy people, you know? And I\nunderstand that I am delegate there, I represent the Polish home [indecipherable] from\nUtica. I -- Iam the delegate to the congress and our meetings usually we have in\nSchenectady, New York, Albany, New York, or even here in Utica, you know? We\ndiscussed many problems as Polish Americans, what is good for us, what is bad for us.\nOur meetings are very interesting, what we really work hard. So, because between us,\nPolish people from the past, from the second World War, there is some differences\nbetween our Polish -- Polish American people in between, and Jewish people. Now, s-so\nwhat we do, many times we invite Jewish rabbis, professors, and we try dialog, and\nsmooth out some of those matters a-a-are not clear, you know, or some of those\naccusations sometime, they are not right, they are wrong. So we try and work together\nbecause Jewish people and Polish people go through the hell, through the second World\nWar, and we should understand each other better, and -- and help each other, you know,\nin a many -- when you -- so-called political matters.",
        "A: Yes, like we have meeting and we invite, like I said, the -- some rabbis, some je --\nfrom the Jewish organization leaders, professors. In one of the meeting we had, oh, a few\nyears back, I never forget that little bit -- was little bit touchy, I disagree little bit with that\n-- one of the speech, had one professor from Schenectady University, he was a young,\nJewish professor, 35 years old, something like that. He make a questions, how come\nduring the war the Polish people, they had to save more Jewish people? And that was a\nvery touchy question. Then, also, that was that one survivor, I believe his name was Steve\nStone, I believe, yeah. He was hiding by Christian family during the war, he was five\nyears old. And he listened to this conversation and when everybody finished talk, then he\nget up and he says, Professor, you tell us that the Polish people should had more and\nsaved more Jewish people. Did you ever was in Poland, did you ever know more about\nthat situation what it was during the -- during the war? He says no. He says, you just --\nhow did you find out about that, and how -- how you are -- well, I think that\u2019s what I\nhear, that\u2019s what we talk, you know, and this and this. He says -- then he said, Professor,\nyou know that the Poland was only country under the German occupation for helping the\nJews, for saving the Jews, was death sentence for that. Oh, he didn\u2019t know what to say.\nHe says, yeah but anyway, how come Holland save percentage-wise more Jewish people\nthan Poland? Then this Steve, the Jewish fellow, he says, well, percentage, that was a\ndifferent situation and there is a difference between Holland and Poland. See, in Poland\nthat was -- before the war started, that was three and a half million Jewish people living.\nOkay, Poland is Christian country. The German know that. And the German expect that\nthe Polish people gonna help Jewish people. And that\u2019s why they set that law, for\nanything to do with the Jewish people, Polish Christian help Jewish people or hiding\nJewish people, death sentence. And that was the -- the poster was all over the city, you\nknow, in Polish and in German, you know, and that was clear, you know, what you\u2019re\ngoing to get. But even so, this Steve -- this is not my words, this Steve told that professor\nfrom Schenectady, New York, even so, the Polish people save about 100,000 Jewish\npeople. Yeah. And different -- different ways, see, some churches, you know, help lots,\nyou know. The nuns, and also there was like Professor Karski. Professor Karski, who\nknows how many indentity card he give to the Jewish people as a Christian. And those\npeople survived. So I think that was a good answer to this. I\u2019m sorry to say, you know,\nthat the Jewish people maybe feel bitter against the Polish people, that the Polish people\nmake -- didn\u2019t make enough, you know? But when you go to Israel, when you look at it,\nwhat\u2019s the name that place, you know, where that -- all names are, and they have -- had --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s right. You see so many Polish names, and so many trees was planted, you\nknow, to honor those people, saved Jewish people, and I\u2019m so glad -- I\u2019m so glad that --\nthat so many, at least so many was saved. Even so, you risk your life, but you save. If you\nsave only one life, this is good, you know, but they save quite -- quite a few thous -- a\nfew thousand, hundred thousand like that Steve se -- did say. So this 1s -- this 1s -- I wish -\n- | wish -- my wish is -- and I work hard, you know, and -- and I wish -- so this come\ntrue, that more understanding come in between Polish and Jewish people. We understand\nwhat they go through. They go through the hell, and we was the next, you -- we go\nthrough the hell. Maybe in -- not in so -- s -- same degree, you know, but we was not\nmuch better than Jewish people, you know that, when we give you interview about my\nwife, Frieda and myself. I come t -- we come to the concentration camp, for what?\nBecause we love each other? Why Jewish people come in a concentration camp? Because\nthey was Jewish, yeah. Was that crime? There was no crime. They didn\u2019t do nothing\nwrong. They was people like anybody else, see? And that bothers me. Now, how about\nGypsy, Roman, let\u2019s say. They come, so many of them to the concentration camp,\nbecause they was Gypsy, because they was Roman, right? All met --",
        "A: All same with other religions, like how you say, people [indecipherable]",
        "A: Jehovah Witnesses, right. Because they was Jehovah Witness, was that crime? Or how\nabout homosexual? How many homosexual was there\u2019? They didn\u2019t do nothing wrong,\nyou know, that wel -- that was for then -- even in this country now, this is a private\nmatter, you know, between person and person, you know? And that -- that -- I no see any\ncrime. So you see, when you -- when you go through this as a -- as a ex-concentration\ncamp prisoner, I had so many Jewish friends. I eat with the same spoon, we help each\nother all we can. And when I hear such accusation now from the Jewish side, it hurts.\nBecause if you say that Polish people are anti-Semitic, that means I am anti-Semitic too.\nAnd I am not. I swear I am not, see, because I grow up with the Jewish people, I like\nJewish people. They didn\u2019t do nothing wrong to me, and I have no reason to be against\nthe Jewish people.",
        "A: Yeah, many people -- many -- many people told me -- many people told me -- we talk,\nwell, for instance in that coffee shop we meet, you know, and so we have conversation.\nThey say, ooh, what wa -- Julie, what was you doing during the war, where were you?\nWell, I was in Germany, yeah, I spent almost four years in a concentration camp. Oh\ngosh, four years in a concentration camp. Oh, Julie, I didn\u2019t know you are Jewish. Now,\nthis 1s -- you know, make me -- sometime make me laugh, then sometime you know, it\nbothers me a little bit, see, because again, besides the Jewish people, there were so many\nother nationalities in a concentration camp and they suffered just the same, you know,\nlike Jewish people.",
        "A: About three times, I think.",
        "A: Here\u2019s the one of them hangs, you know, about three years ago for Valentine day,\nthere was a -- on the front page -- page, there was that article, you see that -- my picture, I\nsmile, Frieda, you know. They were --",
        "A: Yeah --",
        "A: -- but when you look at it above, you know, when we se -- gl -- right after we get\nmarried, you know, see our picture, you see how good looking we were at that time? Oh,\nFrieda was a beautiful girl, yeah.",
        "A: And then -- and then we publicize, and we have so many response from people, you\nknow, American -- even from younger generation, we was -- I was surprised that the\nyounger generation was so interested. And you know, it is for the younger generation\nhere in -- in this country, when you write story you was in a concentration camp, about,\nbecause you\u2019ve fallen in love -- fallen in love with a Austrian or German lady. So the\nyoung generation says, and for that they sent you to the concentration camp? I says, not\nonly that, they send me to the concentration camp, I -- in a way I was lucky they send me\nto the concentration camp, but I can be hanged for that. No, they -- they can\u2019t believe it,\nyou know. For what, for love? Because you love someone you come to the concentration\ncamp\u201d? I says yes. You say that time change, you know, and here in this country you can\nmarry whoever you want, you know, regardless on the color skin, you know, on\nbackground, you know, that doesn\u2019t matter. See, but that time, during the Hitler time,\nHitler want to keep up the clean race, you know, German race, you know, no mix. But I\nno have to tell you what happened after the war, you know, there was a big mix.",
        "A: M-Many of them, many of them, some people sent us the article in case we need it and\neven the [indecipherable] lady, you know, she drop about 10 n-newspapers, you know.\nAnd there was a -- a -- a big reaction on this, and even the state senator, you know, once\nhe -- he wrote me a -- a beautiful letter, and he says, Julie, I know you for a long time, I\ndidn\u2019t know what you was going through. Oh, what a interesting story, so and so. And wa\n-- that response was very, very -- in general was very good, but als -- and we had some\ntelephone call, yeah, oh congratulation, yes, yes, specially the last one, and what we had\nthree years ago on Saint Valentine day, they even call me on the station that time and\ncongratulate me. But also when I get home after the program, you know, I had a nasty\ntelephone, I told you that. A guy call me, he says, hey, you was in a concentration camp,\nMr. Noga. I says yes. Oh, and then you survive. I saw your picture 1n that paper, this\nmorning\u2019s paper. You look good. You was probably the -- one of the collaborator with\nthe Germans, right? You know how this [indecipherable]. I says, buddy, whoever you\nare, you are so wrong, and I got no words for you, good-bye. Then I hang up. You know?\nYou got people -- all depends, you know that. People are very funny, some people. Right\naway they accuse you for something. If I was collaborator with the Germans, you think I\ngo United States Holocaust there in Washington and tell my story, and my name, I didn\u2019t\nchange my name, my father and my brothers, you know, still were living -- was living\nhere, you know? I put my name if I was doing something wrong? Absolutely not. And\nbefore they accept me in -- in United States Holocaust --",
        "A: -- before they invite me, they check up my background. They know who I am, yeah.\nSo, you see, here is -- so again, when I come to the Polish people and Jewish people, I\nwish we get some more dialogs, we get together, we smooth out some differences, you\nknow. And be friends, you know, as we was before the war started, you know, I had so\nmany friends, I still got so many friends there, Jewish friends, yeah. And again, nobody\ncan take away anything from Jewish people, what they was going through, through the\nsecond World War. They had not much help. I wonder sometime how come American\nJewish didn\u2019t help that time. When Professor Karski come and speak to the Roosevelt\nand tell him, Mr. President, in Warsaw, in Poland, the Jewish people are -- they are killed\nby Germans, they sent to the concentration camp. You know what the President\nRoosevelt did say at that time? Well, after the war is finish, we take care of those war\ncriminals. And that was -- yeah. And that time he come -- Professor Karski come with a\nJewish leader from the -- from Poland, from the Jewish underground. His name was, I\nbelieve Ziegenbalg -- Ziegenbalg, something like that. And they go to the English\ngovernment, they go to the American government and nothing help that time, nothing\nhelp. So the -- Ziegenbalg, he commit suicide. He open a -- I understand he open a gas in\nthe kitchen, then he died, because he couldn\u2019t -- he couldn\u2019t do anything to help Jewish\npeople, you know? And this is a tragedy, see, that -- that the whole world that time, no\nwant to listen about this tragedy, what\u2019s happen to Jewish people, what they was doing in\nPoland, you know? And that bothers me, you see. And that -- this -- this what I can say, I\nwish, you know, we -- we smooth out those differences, if this exist any differences\nbetween Polish and Jewish people, so there\u2019s more understanding, you know, why, why\nand why, yeah.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: I was -- that time I was the president of Polish community club here in Utica, and\nunder the -- my jurisdiction, there was 28 Polish organizations, see? So otherwise, each\nmeeting I speak to delegates of 28 organization, see that Polonia in Utica. That time was\nvery strong and still is strong. So, most of the -- those organization was like a insurance,\nlike a ro -- mothers of rosaries, or Saint Anne Societies, and Saint Peter Societies, you\nknow. But I was looking around and I was thinking, gosh, you know, we need a\norganization, you know, on a little bit higher -- higher level. Tell us about the culture,\nPolish culture, American culture, you know? So that was a -- at that time, 1970 some --\nyeah, that -- \u201973, I think. That was a -- a fi -- fifth anniversary -- 500 anniversary of\nNicholas Kopernicus -- Nikolai Kopernik birthday. And then I called special meeting, the\nwhole Polonia meeting, and it -- oh, about hundred people attend, presidents, you know,\nfrom different organization, you know, guests. And I introduce my plan, you know, we --\nwe need another organization. And because this 1s a 500 anniversary of Nicholas\nKopernicus, Nikolai Kopernik birthday, maybe we should build up a statue, put the statue\nhere in the city [indecipherable] to this -- make a mark, you know, to this, because who\nwas Nikolai Kopernik? Nikolai Kopernik was the astronomer, and he was the first man\nfind out that the -- not the sun but the earth turns around the sun, right? Yeah, and that --\nthat came long time til his book and theory was accepted, but finally was accepted, and\nby gosh, truth is, we can send a man on the moon, do you know, and this and this, you\nknow, that [indecipherable]. And so the people agree to -- to do this, and wa -- coming\nback to Nicholas Kopernik -- Ko-Kopernicus, he is a universal man. And I think that --\nthat time I thought -- I thought that was worth [indecipherable] to build up the statue for\nhim. And we did. I designed the pedestal, because I am stonecutter, of course, and the\nstatue was made -- three and a half meter high, was made in Warsaw, in Poland. Bronze\nstatue, made out of bronze. So we put it together, and -- that statue, with the pedestal\nbase, 1s 21 feet tall and four inches, exactly. And then -- then we had unveiling. When the\nstatue was ready we had unveiling and many, many people come. And the congressman\nmake a -- a -- recorded it in Washington, D.C. in Congress, that such a thing happen in\nUtica, New York. And that was a big -- big, big thing. So -- and the organization,\nKopernik organization, right after that decided to give a -- help students in college, you\nknow, give a grant, you know, give a scholarship. And that\u2019s what they do since that, up\nto today, you know, they do -- not big sc-scholarship, you -- like thousand dollars for\nthree s -- for three students, each become thousand dollars -- get a thousand dollars, yeah.\nAnd that organization -- yes, the organization got the -- got the museum and they\u2019Il find\nwork for this community.",
