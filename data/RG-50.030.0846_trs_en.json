        "Q: Tell me.",
        "A: \u2014 but I can tell you. The reason is that Yiddish left very heavy accent, and very\nheavy kind of m-music type of thing, you know. And people that spoke Yiddish,\nthey can\u2019t get rid of it. So, you know, as soon as they opened mouth, you know,\nthey \u2014 1-1-in Polish, they knew that they are Jewish people, and it means that they\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 they couldn\u2019t save themselves pretending to be Poles. So many\nthousands of people died because they spoke Yiddish. It\u2019s very unusual, but that\u2019s is\ntrue, I bi \u2014 nobody tell you because they say that it is offensive. It\u2019s not offensive,\nit\u2019s just actually, this is how it is.",

        "A: Yeah, go ahead.",
        "Q: Does that mean that most people who spoke Yiddish didn\u2019t speak Polish, or they\nspoke it with an accent?",
        "A: No, 90 percent, I would say, spoke Polish. Some, maybe in the small sh \u2014 s-s \u2014\nshtetls, you \u2014 like you know, the children, maybe they just spoke Yiddish only, butOctober 21, 2015\nmost people spoke both Polish and Yiddish. The ones that just spoke Yiddish, you\nknow.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. So, were your parents more assimilated, in \u2014 in that they spoke\nPolish and Russian, or \u2014",

        "Q: No.",
        "A: It\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 yeah.",
        "Q: It\u2019s an accent, or it\u2019s a \u2014",
        "A: It\u2019s accent is kind of like a melody type of thing, Yiddish is. So that\u2019s \u2014 many\npeople died because of this, but see, I am the first one that\u2019s not afraid to tell about.",

        "Q: Oh gosh.",
        "A: No, you know, because listen, everything is miracles, you know. Everything is\nso unbelievable, because \u2014 because I am very not everyday person, honestly. Let me\ntell you something, look, when the \u2014 when the Russian \u2014 Russian offense started\nfrom in \u2014 from direction of course of Minsk, and all of this, direction toward\nHorodyszcze, and farther, you know. But then we knew this according how\u2019s it\n204October 21, 2015\ngoing, according movement of this German military, because we have seen pushing\nby through the main highway. We have been next to the highways that going to\nBaranovichi, you know, so we knew the transport was going somewhere. We look\nit up and then we see lot of German cars going from di \u2014 in direction to\nBaranovichi to \u2014 to this way, and down.",

So I figure out uh-oh, this\nmean already is closer, you know. And they \u2014 they declare \u2014 same time they declare\nevacuation of Horodyszcze. This was fantastic because evacuation is mess, nobody\nknows anything, nobody cared to arrest somebody, you know, the evacuation, it \u2014 it\nabsolutely fantastic in our case, you know. But how to move, and where? So they\ndecide we \u2014 we \u2014 they dec \u2014 dec \u2014 they decide ts \u2014 look, our \u2014 our ho \u2014 this place\nthat we\u2019re living had not far from police department, you know.

But this is not \u2014 this is just \u2014 it was \u2014 was not\ntrue. Later, I figure out that\u2019s not true because I knew geography, and I know the\n205\nOctober 21, 2015\nway how we going that it\u2019s not Warsaw, but K\u00e9nigsberg. So you know, but they \u2014\nthey lie that they going to Warsaw, you know.",
        "Q: Okay.",

That\u2019s fine, so we got another cart. So we have\nanything left, because this means that they used to us, you know, that we \u2014 we are\nokay, you know what I mean? We \u2014 they figure out they can question what we\u2019re\ndoing here, you know.",
        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014I didn\u2019t know. But then, you know, so after sometimes, you know, the guy on\nthe left side start to be tired or something, and he disappeared from this, I don\u2019t\nknow what happened. And the other guy, just before we \u2014 we cut \u2014 we come to the\nci \u2014 to the town that we should go, he still was there, but he has close eyes, and he\nwas sleeping with the horse, you know. But \u2014 but \u2014 but you know \u2014 but we went a\n208\nOctober 21, 2015\nlittle farther, and I figure out he sleep very well, and le \u2014 we can come back, you\nknow, we can turn back and turn this place that he [indecipherable]. And then was\n\u2014 then th \u2014 the problem was, it was German camp next to this, and I figure out they\nwill see that somebody\u2019s running from this thing, they can run after us, you know.\nBut this horse, just like we understand something, he start to run like crazy, you\nknow, and I didn\u2019t say anything. And we just went up so fast, you know, that they f\n\u2014I figure out even if they will see that we\u2019re something, will \u2014 it will be too late for\nthem to catch up with us, you know.",

They were big woods, you know. So we figure out\n209\nOctober 21, 2015\nthis is safer to be in the woods with other people. And he told us that Ukrainian\npartisans had been there, and they found guns, ammunition. But they left uniforms.\nSo we took the uniform. Later, we sold them.

        "A: But we had been in the house, and I have hear and seen the big bombs and the\ndust, you know, and everything. But with \u2014 thanks God it was not 1n our house, but\nnext to our house.",
        "A: And then, you know, the people from the other house, injured, they come to our\nbasement, to our house. But that\u2019s all what it was for L\u00e9dz. But exactly, you know,\nby the \u2014 did you ever read about it? No.",

        "A: No, nothing. Oh, the radio, they talk to us before about \u2014 about things they never\nhappen, you know, they said something, some kind of \u2014 oh no, the \u2014 the Lodz after\nthis, yes, they said about since it never \u2014 1s that it was not true. They said that\nthere\u2019s \u2014 animal drop some \u2014 some gas, you know, gas \u2014 poison with gas, you\nknow, some kind of nonsense, you know. And they said you should \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you sh \u2014 yeah, Polish radio, yeah. But \u2014 so you know, when I went from upper\nfloor to the basement to hide, I had something in my mouth wi \u2014 before I figure out\nthat I can breathe the gas, you know, or something.",
        "A: Yeah, broadcasting some \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. This was the fir \u2014",

        "A: No, contrary, I went from the basement up. I was carrying my \u2014 this nap-napkin,\nyou know, some kind of tha \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, to save myself from gas, I never forget this one. But that\u2019s was the \u2014 so\nnext day was reasonable quiet, and I think we left L\u00e9dz after third or fourth day,\nbecause the Germans come already close.",
        "A: No, the \u2014 th-the \u2014 yeah, that\u2019s what I says. As soon as the bomb falls, we know\nthat we are in b \u2014 in a \u2014 the \u2014 they never said \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 they never said about this, they \u2014 they \u2014 I told you, the Poles, just like the \u2014\nthey have been \u2014 fall asleep, you know, they never knew that the Germans attack \u2014\nattack them, you know.",

But I tell you\nsomething, we couldn\u2019t take our car. So\u2014 you know why?",
        "A: Because my father said the car is extremely good quality, and we just check\neverything, and we need th \u2014 the Polish army will need this kind of cars. So we\nwent with car of my Uncle Siomek, the one that was in Vilnius, you know.",
        "A: But the car was smaller than the other one, so I was laying down on the floor,\nbecause there was no seat for me to sit. And somebody put the \u2014 the\n[indecipherable] the legs, you know, was [indecipherable] so that\u2019s how we left\nLodz.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, definitely, yeah.",
        "A: Didn\u2019t \u2014 no, no, nothing like that. But you know when \u2014 already the war started,\nso re-reality\u2019s come to him, you know, the bomb, and everything. Oh look, if\nsomebody bombed you, so you know that it\u2019s not a fa \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 a bouquet of flowers \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you know. So well, he was completely, you know, in a way I was really\nsurprised that he is going to leave her mother \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and everything, but was no room. They supposed to send the car back, you\nknow, after we\u2019ll be already in Warsaw, because it \u2014",
        "A: In the car was \u2014 okay, was me, my mother, my father, Uncle Siomek and\nVova(ph). This was a guy that put my legs on me.",
        "A: I think, so that basically what it was, five people, but it was of \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, and Aviva, of course, Aviva.",
        "A: Aviva.",
        "A: Vova(ph) was \u2014 Vova(ph) was the guy that was friend of my father, and he\nsupposedly find that \u2014 in order to get out from L6dz you need some kind of\ndocument [indecipherable] and he \u2014 he \u2014 he se \u2014 he said that for thousand zloty, he\ncan got it, you know. So my father gave him thousand zloty, and he brought these\ndocuments that they were checking when he \u2014 when he leave the city, they check \u2014\ncheck the documents. This document was, I don\u2019t know how \u2014 what the name of It.\nMaybe it was fake, maybe it was with thousand dollar may \u2014 thousand zloty, maybe\nit was one zloty, but anyway, my father gave him, in order to get out from the\nLodz, you know.",
        "A: So that\u2019s how it was.",
        "A: Okay. I wrote very detailed about in my book, you know, and there was \u2014 there\nwas \u2014 in one place, there was kind of shocking for me was that the sol \u2014 Polish\nsoldiers told us that we should write to this left, or to the right, cause there areOctober 21, 2015\nbombs laying on the \u2014 on the \u2014 on the bridge, you know? So we should be careful\nhow we ride. So this kind of shocked me. But the worst place was name \u2014 1n the city\nnamed Siedlce. There was \u2014 they \u2014 they went \u2014 there was all this problem with\ngasoline, you know, so my father and Siomek lo-look up for gasoline, and my\nmother and \u2014 and my sister were s-stay in the restaurant, you know, and waiting on\nthem to come. But meantime, the Germans, the planes come, and they have been\nbombing. You know, the small houses like this, this is nothing beca \u2014 1t was \u2014 if one\nbomb will hit us, we will not survive, you know. It was such a noise, and bombs,\netcetera, was terrible, absolutely terrible. This I never forget. It was the worst part of\nthis trip to Warsaw.",
        "A: But we survive, yes, also.",
        "A: On the way to Warsaw.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, but \u2014 and nothing beyond, you\u2019re ri \u2014 no, after Warsaw.\nOctober 21, 2015",
        "A: Because already they \u2014 they come closer to Warsaw, so we \u2014 we did it to \u2014 so\nwe figure out where to run away, only to run away toward Soviet Union, toward\nborder \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 on this lay \u2014 of the right side, you know. T-To the east, you know.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Toward the Soviet \u2014 and we find a place, it was just on the border. I don\u2019t\nremember the name of this place. And that\u2019s how we come here and stay number of\ndays, you know, until \u2014 until the Soviets [indecipherable] take, you know, the\nother part of Poland.",
        "A: Til then we left this \u2014",
        "A: What I see? I se \u2014 I see the Soviets arrive the first time my life, and I was\nthinking, what a primitive army it is, they have the \u2014 I\u2014 I haven\u2019t seen many cars,\nbut I see horses pulling the cars, or some artillery, etcetera, you know. And it was\nkind of interesting for me to see it, how\u2019s it \u2014 because I \u2014 I never know about how\u2019sOctober 21, 2015\nit look like. And the \u2014 and then, you know, of course they \u2014 they already started to\nhave their own police, it started to be kind of more like a \u2014 like a Gestapo driving\nother way, you know.",
        "A: Yes, I do, I\u2014I wrote it, but same here again. I don\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s in \u2014 in my book, you\nknow. I don\u2019t remember at this moment here.",
        "A: But it was a si \u2014 very small town.",
        "A: Maybe a few days, because the Soviets dec-decided in few days that they take\nthe rest of the \u2014 of the \u2014 half of the Poland, you know.",
        "A: Half \u2014 just half.",
        "A: Oh, we started toward Vilnius \u2014 Wilno, because the uncle of Father was living\nin Wilno. Zlatyn(ph) was the name.",
        "A: Zlatyn(ph), yes.",
        "A: Okay now, this \u2014 this was in times that the Soviet decide that \u2014 Soviet decide\nthat the \u2014 they gave temporary to Lithuania. You remember this time? Because you\nshould [indecipherable] because you are from Vilnius. They \u2014 they give it, so that\neverybody was happy, now we\u2019re going to free Lithuania, you know, democratic\ncountry, you know, we know Lithuania from very plus side, you know, was\ndemocratic country, free, free. So there was just fantastic things to go there.",
        "A: And I never real \u2014 I never forget when we come to this Lithuanian, I\u2019ve seen the\n\u2014 the guys, you know, big, with these hats, they have kind of long hats, you know \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. I remember this. And there was freedom, you know, it was lot of\nfood. At one time peanut \u2014 peanut fla \u2014 peanut satrous(ph). I don\u2019t the names.",
        "A: Yeah, nat \u2014 yeah. So was food and everything, just free, you know.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Don\u2019t come, sure.",
        "A: Because they divided \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Poland in half.",
        "A: At that time.",
        "A: Well, you know, because you know, the \u2014 we \u2014 we know the difference between\nSoviet Union and free Lithuania, you know, democratic country, you know. What\n\u2014 what the difference, like day and night, you know.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: Of course, yeah.October 21, 2015",
        "A: Probably couple days or something, you know. There was a \u2014 was also very\ncomplicated because on the way the Soviet police kind of catch a \u2014 catch\n[indecipherable] requires a hou \u2014 the \u2014 the car, you know, the car was something.\nSo what they did, they diz \u2014 my father and \u2014 and my uncle disabled the car. So we\nhire horses to pull the car, pretending that \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it doesn\u2019t work. I tell you, everything is so unbelievable, huh? You \u2014 I tell you\neverything \u2014 and this is before is \u2014 the most interesting part that they told about the\nmovie, that this is just a movie. But I\u2014 I was thinking something else, you know. I\nwas thinking there is so much material that you sh \u2014 you cannot make one movie\nfrom this, so you know, like in \u2014 in the TV was one time like four different parts, or\nsomething? That\u2019s what it should be, because it\u2019s too much in one \u2014 one thing.",
        "A: This unbelievable.",
        "A: It wa \u2014 it \u2014 very kind of things that people are not familiar with, you know, and\nyou can make like far \u2014 four or five, you know, parts, you know, and \u2014",

        "A: So the road was single.",
        "A: Single lane, and it sometime \u2014October 21, 2015",
        "A: Yeah, not only this, but somehow we come to the bridge, and bridge doesn\u2019t\nexist any more. And \u2014 you know, so should \u2014",

They told me that everybody it \u2014 1s\nafraid to run away because there will be not \u2014 nothing to eat, you know. But you\nknow, this was something that they didn\u2019t trust me, who I am, because they did\nthink about run away, you know. Because 18 of them run away, and I know exactly\nhow many because the police, when \u2014 the Belorussian police have been the ones\nthat killed them, and they been complaining that 18 didn\u2019t show off, you know, that\nsomebody must tell them \u2014 tell them, you know.

        "A: But when \u2014 there was times that they arrested \u2014 starting to arrest Poles, you\nknow, and I didn\u2019t expect they would arrest him because, in my opinion, and I \u2014 I \u2014\nI know for sure, because when I told him that \u2014 that maybe I should run away withOctober 21, 2015\nthem to woods, so he said it, by all means, don\u2019t do it, you know, he told me don\u2019t.\nAnd \u2014 and if I would do it something \u2014 so even if I was safe too, they would kill my\nmother, you know. So I figured out that he\u2019s right, and I d\u2014 you n\u2014 I \u2014I hated the\nGermans so much, figure I should run in the woods, you know, etcetera. But then,\nafter he told me this, and I figure too, was that, so I\u2019ve \u2014 I am not going to run\naway. But I will stay and do what they ask me. They ask me to be a \u2014 to be the\ncontact between them and \u2014 and the city, you know, if there is something that I\nshould [indecipherable]. But one time, when they started to arrest Poles, and I was\nin the house, and I \u2014 this window was so important for me. I look it up, and you ca \u2014\nyou can see on the map that his plebania, you know, where this priest was living,\nhe was on the top of this small street going up, and visible from my window. And I\nlook it up, I see that the one \u2014 one German officer, and \u2014 and one Belarusian that I\nknew him, because he was \u2014 his family was living next to our apartment, you know.\nThey come to his house, to this a \u2014 when this was a \u2014",

And then ar \u2014 I look it up, 1t wa \u2014 why they come to his house, you\nknow? My God \u2014 very scared to death. Well, few minutes later I see they c \u2014 theyOctober 21, 2015\ncome, and he comes. And he keep in his hand prayer book. So I figure up, terrible.\nSomething very bad. And he \u2014 they arrested him and brought him in \u2014 in the \u2014 from\nupper, down toward \u2014 toward \u2014 in direction to this 0 \u2014 to this \u2014 you know, I told\nyou, gendarmerie and for police, etcetera, the direction, but they need to go next to\nmy window, you know. And then they come, and they stop next to my house. And I\nfigure, well, they going to ki\u2014 ki \u2014 kill me. But the guy that was with the German\nofficer, he was an \u2014 our neighbor, he come to the German just like this; leave him\nalone.

Because, you know, maybe he was afraid that we can say\nsomething against him, or something, being a neighbor, or some reason, some\nreason, whatever it was, 1-1-it \u2014 it saved my life, you know. So \u2014 but \u2014 but this\npriest, you know, eventually they kill all of the Poles that they arrested. Was only\nhundred \u2014 150 Poles, they kill them.\nOctober 21, 2015",

Let me\ntell you something, look, when the \u2014 when the Russian \u2014 Russian offense started\nfrom in \u2014 from direction of course of Minsk, and all of this, direction toward\nHorodyszcze, and farther, you know. But then we knew this according how\u2019s it\n204October 21, 2015\ngoing, according movement of this German military, because we have seen pushing\nby through the main highway. We have been next to the highways that going to\nBaranovichi, you know, so we knew the transport was going somewhere. We look\nit up and then we see lot of German cars going from di \u2014 in direction to\nBaranovichi to \u2014 to this way, and down.",
        "A: Fr-From \u2014 yeah, to \u2014 yeah, to way \u2014",
        "A: Retreating. So \u2014 but we didn\u2019t know how long it will take, but one time they \u2014\nthey \u2014 they stopped it to \u2014 to walk by foot, you know? So I figure out uh-oh, this\nmean already is closer, you know. And they \u2014 they declare \u2014 same time they declare\nevacuation of Horodyszcze. This was fantastic because evacuation is mess, nobody\nknows anything, nobody cared to arrest somebody, you know, the evacuation, it \u2014 it\nabsolutely fantastic in our case, you know. But how to move, and where? So they\ndecide we \u2014 we \u2014 they dec \u2014 dec \u2014 they decide ts \u2014 look, our \u2014 our ho \u2014 this place\nthat we\u2019re living had not far from police department, you know. I will show you on\nthe map how it is. And they \u2014 they said \u2014 I ask one of policemen, where are you\ngoing? We going to Warsaw, he said. But this is not \u2014 this is just \u2014 it was \u2014 was not\ntrue. Later, I figure out that\u2019s not true because I knew geography, and I know the\n205\nOctober 21, 2015\nway how we going that it\u2019s not Warsaw, but K\u00e9nigsberg. So you know, but they \u2014\nthey lie that they going to Warsaw, you know.",
        "A: Just to fool around. So \u2014 so \u2014 so we figure out Warsaw, fantastic, here, let\u2019s go \u2014\nlet\u2019s jump \u2014 jump on one of the cars what everyone\u2019s \u2014 was empty car, nobody\nstaying next to the car. We come to this cart, and with horse and everything. And\nthey decided to \u2014 to leave, and they left and we had been living together with them,\nyou know, nobody check \u2014",
        "A: No, this was not German army, this was police, it was.",

        "A: The Belarusian. Belarusian police.\n206October 21, 2015",
        "A: So, you know, we went with them. And then, on the way, you know \u2014 on the\nway they decided that this cart, they liked to have [indecipherable] cart, so they \u2014\nthey gave us another cart, you know. That\u2019s fine, so we got another cart. So we have\nanything left, because this means that they used to us, you know, that we \u2014 we are\nokay, you know what I mean? We \u2014 they figure out they can question what we\u2019re\ndoing here, you know.",
        "A: \u2014 but several \u2014 such a mess of disorganization that they didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t have a\ntime to \u2014 to check \u2014",
        "A: To see \u2014 yeah, okay. Well, we didn\u2019t realize that in this cart, under straw, there\nare guns, ammunition, uniforms and everything, you know? But we didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t\ncheck what\u2019s underneath, I figure I just \u2014 you know. And so we went in one place,\nyou know. Here again, we have to do with priest, how about this? We went to one\nplace that we decided we should run away from them because they are going to\nKonigsberg, and not Warsaw, we better get out from here \u2014 this place.",
        "A: So I went to this church, and the guy, this priest was ver \u2014 was very ir \u2014\nunderstanding, and he said yes, by all means, don\u2019t stay with them. So, I mean, but\n207\nOctober 21, 2015\nwhere we going? So he got \u2014 he \u2014 he told me exactly where to go and where I\nshould s \u2014 make a left turn, you know, th \u2014 I have it here, this what he told me.",
        "A: Go to [indecipherable] I gave you letter to the soltys. Soltys is the head of the\nvillage.",
        "A: I\u2014I will give him letter that you say should accommodate you, you know.",
        "A: So this is something we should do. That was easy to say, but difficult to do it,\nbecause they watching us. They started to watch us somehow, and they put\nhorsemen on both sides of our car.",
        "A: Ye-Yeah, but \u2014 but we \u2014 I didn\u2019t know I have the guns, you see \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I didn\u2019t know. But then, you know, so after sometimes, you know, the guy on\nthe left side start to be tired or something, and he disappeared from this, I don\u2019t\nknow what happened. And the other guy, just before we \u2014 we cut \u2014 we come to the\nci \u2014 to the town that we should go, he still was there, but he has close eyes, and he\nwas sleeping with the horse, you know. But \u2014 but \u2014 but you know \u2014 but we went a\n208\nOctober 21, 2015\nlittle farther, and I figure out he sleep very well, and le \u2014 we can come back, you\nknow, we can turn back and turn this place that he [indecipherable]. And then was\n\u2014 then th \u2014 the problem was, it was German camp next to this, and I figure out they\nwill see that somebody\u2019s running from this thing, they can run after us, you know.\nBut this horse, just like we understand something, he start to run like crazy, you\nknow, and I didn\u2019t say anything. And we just went up so fast, you know, that they f\n\u2014I figure out even if they will see that we\u2019re something, will \u2014 it will be too late for\nthem to catch up with us, you know.",
        "A: So they \u2014 eventually we found the soltys, the guy who was in charge, and he\naccommodate us. So this was one part.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, but the hor \u2014 the horse we gave better to these guys that\naccommodate us, because we didn\u2019t \u2014 what are we going to do with this horse, you\nknow.",
        "A: But how do I know about the guns? Because \u2014 because we left this cart, you\nknow, after the \u2014 they \u2014 they took this horse, they too \u2014 they left the cart, and we\nwent to these woods, you know. They were big woods, you know. So we figure out\n209\nOctober 21, 2015\nthis is safer to be in the woods with other people. And he told us that Ukrainian\npartisans had been there, and they found guns, ammunition. But they left uniforms.\nSo we took the uniform. Later, we sold them. What kind of guns, they took guns\nand ammunition, but uniforms they sold it, you know? So the \u2014 okay, there was a \u2014\nyou like to farther? Everything is there.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",

        "A: Yeah.\n210October 21, 2015",
        "A: Okay, first, you know, when we come to this place, we have seen \u2014 there were\nno Soviets, but there have been Germans \u2014 German officer, and three guns,\nsomething like this \u2014 couple guns, you know. And they been shooting in direction to\nRussian. And each time they shoot, it was so noisy, you know, was just terrible. But\nthe problem was not what they shoot, but they shoot against them, because we have\nbeen there. So this \u2014 after some times, we didn\u2019t wait too long, they started to shoot\nin the \u2014 in our direction to hit this \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Germans, you know. So can you figure what it was, it was big, heavy artillery,\nwas not just small artil \u2014 and we \u2014 so there was one place I don\u2019t remember, we dig\nourselves, so it was already dark, and we have been in some kind of hou \u2014 place in\nthe \u2014 in the ground, you know, to be safer, you know.
