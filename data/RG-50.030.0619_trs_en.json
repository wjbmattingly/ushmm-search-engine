There\nmust have been about 1,500 people. That was the last transport from Nowy Dwor. Men\nget over to the right. Yeah, the women over to the left going on trucks. Women,\nchildren, young kids. I almost went over to them. You know, I figured well, what the\nhell.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But I learned my lesson in don't expect any good things from the Germans. So if you\ncan walk, fine, and particularly, I moved myself over to the side of the men, lined up in\nfives, and this guy, about three rows of fives, an SS man leads us in. They go away\nimmediately, the men -- not the full, whatever went in. I found out of course from my\nbook, out of the 1,500 who came in, 570, which was a high number, because there were\nmostly men, you follow me, younger --",
        "Q: Younger feet.",
        "A: That was the last transport, on their feet, right.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- went into the camp --",
        "Q: And that was --",
        "A: -- selected there and the rest of them went on trucks.",
        "Q: Trucks.",
        "A: Now, we don't know from nothing. As a matter of fact, what's his name, Zlotnick\n(ph), my buddy, his sister was about two years older than him, a gorgeous tall girl,\nalthough, they didn't take any women from that transport.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay. They ride off into a little forest over there. That was a little white house.\nSome of the guys who came in with their wives, with their families, you know, wanted to\nfind out after we got in, where are the women? Where are the children? So the prisoners\nstarted to laugh at them. So you see that big fire out there, outside of the perimeter of the\ncamp\u2019? They're dead. There's the machine gun them to the best of my knowledge, first.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And then burn them in pyres of wood with whatever they did, and I think after about\ntwo or three months, the crematoriums were finished. We were building -- we were\nhelping to build the crematoriums.",
        "Q: Yep. So were you processed in \u2014 in --",
        "A: I was processed in Birkenau.",
        "Q: Yep",
        "A: Immediately.",
        "Q: Yep.",
        "A: We went into a -- we were tattooed.",
        "Q: Tattooed, head shaved?",
        "A: That's right.",
        "Q: Yep.",
        "A: Tattooed, everything --",
        "Q: And all the hair shaved?",
        "A: All the hair shaved --",
        "Q: Yep.",
        "A: And we went into the sauna.",
        "Q: Deloused --",
        "A: For regular \u2014 regular -- we didn't know.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. No. There was no gas at that stage?",
        "A: No, we received \u2014 no, there was no gas yet.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: We received the -- what do you call it, clothing, whatever.",
        "Q: Whatever you could get.",
        "A: You were a big guy, you get short clothes. You're a short guy, you get big -- like in\nthe Army.",
        "Q: Big shoes, small shoes.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Yep.",
        "A: So with wooden clogs. That was the worst, those heavy wooden -- I don't know if\nyou've ever seen them --",
        "Q: Yeah, I have.",
        "A: They call them the Holland --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: No socks.",
        "Q: In winter.",
        "A: Oh, used to rub on here, terrible, terrible. You could hear \u2014 you could hear you\ncoming from ten miles away.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, clank. So anyway, we're assigned to cell block 15, must have been about\n450. The rest of them I think went to a different -- I don't know where -- or maybe the\nwhole 570, I don't know, went into that particular -- in cell block the altestewayouzef (ph)\nThis was the Polish --",
        "Q: The Polish --",
        "A: He gave us a talk when we got in there and each one got -- we got four men sleeping\nin one of those, either four or five. I don't know, some of them were five. I always\nmanaged to get one on top --",
        "Q: Good idea.",
        "A: -- immediately. Sure. I wanted to be on top. So and I was only, I would say about\ntwo or three days, I was like every other prisoner, because I was assigned to the job of\ncleaning, you know, picking up the bodies from the ditch.",
        "Q: Yes. These are people who had committed suicide?",
        "A: Committed suicide, right.",
        "Q: By electrocuting themselves?",
        "A: Yes --well, what they did know -- let's say this is the perimeter of the camp, right?",
        "Q: Yep, yep.",
        "A: A trip wire, okay, with just a little trip wire, a ditch, electrified by a wired fence,\nsentry box. So not that they needed an excuse. Anybody wanted to commit suicide, very\neasy. You put your foot over that trip wire, which means you're trying to escape. The\nguy would shoot you from the sentry box. Many of them, that's what the German\ntransport did, about two months later, when they found out what was going on there.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: So that was my job for the first couple of years [sic], to put the bodies together on\ntwo, three guys, you know, heap on a wagon, a wooden wagon, bring it over to a\nparticular cell block, line up and then it went to the crematorium where, crematorium \u2014\nnot the crematorium, the pyre of woods where they did them.",
        "Q: The pyre, yep.",
        "A: I only did this for about I think eight or nine days.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Maybe two weeks.",
        "Q: Yep.",
        "A: Not even that. One night after coming from work in the afternoon, the blockalteste:\nIs there anyone here who sings?\n(?Indeciperhable\u2019?)\nSing. You sing. Everybody, hey, Wisnia, get down. Sing. I get down from my booksa\n(ph). There was a place about the size of this, the middle of the regular tiers of beds, of\nthose wooden booksas (ph), and that was right there. There was a door to a special room\nfor the blockalteste, who was -- he was the boss of life and death really.",
        "Q: Yep.",
        "A: And Isang. From that moment on, my life changed.",
        "Q: What did you sing?",
        "A: Buy me a (?undeciperhable?). Joseph, Joseph, won't you make your mind up.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Hebrew, what did I do? He couldn't care less, as long --",
        "Q: Didn't matter what it was?",
        "A: Didn't matter what it was.",
        "Q: As long as --",
        "A: I sang.",
        "Q: -- you entertained him?",
        "A: I sang.",
        "Q: Anything in Polish?",
        "A: Yeah, sure. (?undeipherable?) Oh , he loved that. That was very popular. I knew\nevery song. This was my life.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: So from that moment on, he says, okay, tomorrow you're not going to that job.\nYou're going to stay right here in the -- it was like a revelation.",
        "Q: And you were the stubendienst?",
        "A: I became a stubendienst. Actually, I couldn't become a stubendienst because the\nstubendienst had some pull from somebody. So I became the assistant to the\nstubendienst.\nYou talk about -- what do you call it, protect ya. Oh, God.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Then they came to select people for the various commandos, you follow?",
        "Q: Yep.",
        "A: I don't remember how often I went out to work. I didn't go out to work very often,\nbut the greatest privilege was when it came to the roll calls, because remember, it was\ncold as hell all the time.",
        "Q: And that went for hours?",
        "A: Hours. People used to die standing there.",
        "Q: Yep.",
        "A: So. And they count -- they didn't now how to count. They didn't have a system. If\nyou read -- what's a her name, Tippy's book, you'll see. She's got it tagged right. They\nhad no system.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: They needed the prisoners to help them with the system.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: That's why they have a stubendienst, a kapo, a blockalteste, you follow, and if were\nyou in with these --",
        "Q: You were in?",
        "A: You were in.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And my job, and I really -- believe me, if I ever prayed always one more day, let me,\nI've got to -- but I'll tell you something. You know, somebody just asked is me, to what\ndo I attribute my survival at one of my speeches. It took me a long time to figure it out,\nbut I knew the first day when I got undressed in front of the sauna before we went in for\nthe shower, I was standing in front of an SS man who was about 6'6. My eyes fixed in to\nhis belt buckle. You can imagine how tall he was. To me it looked that tall, right? This\nis in front of the sauna. I'll never forget this as long as I live, and I look in, and what does\nit say on the belt buckle -- you won't believe this -- I don't know if you ever heard that,\nGott mit uns. Okay. God is with us.",
        "Q: Is with us, yes.",
        "A: Swastika here --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- in the middle and then SS insignia on the side. I swear I looked in there, and for a\nsecond I had to hold myself back from laughing. I says you son of a bitch -- I didn't say\nthat. I said not the God I learned about. I'm going to do everything in my life to outlive\nyou.",
        "Q: Yep, yep.",
        "A: I already saw what was going on there, and from that moment on, you will not\nbelieve, I said to myself, 750 Grand Concourse, Bronx, New York; 723 Gates Avenue,\nBrooklyn, New York. Right. I didn't have any pencil. I didn't have anything. I used to\nbe the fancy writer in the house -- in my house. So every time we had -- my mother had\ntwo sisters here in the States. One of them who came in the first world war, elder sister,\nwho lived on the concourse in New York, and the other one who left about six months\nbefore the war broke out. Her younger sister came to her. She took her down before the\nwar. Her name was Helen Borenstein (ph). That played quite a trick on me because I\nscrewed up the addresses. Wait till you hear this one.",
        "Q: Wait for the purse war thing, but yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So that was -- so that was the preservation --",
        "A: The preservation \u2014",
        "Q: In your \u20141n your --",
        "A: What gave me --",
        "Q: In your mind.",
        "A: And I'll tell you something, what gave me, at that moment, I says, it's not what I\nlearned. No, God isn't with them, not the God that I know. I'm going to try to outlive\nyou. I did.",
        "Q: Absolutely.",
        "A: I did. And you know, I used -- somebody asked me why do I come in with it now. I\nhad -- I told that story before but I delivered a speech about three months ago, four\nmonths ago over here at -- where my granddaughter lives. The teachers wanted me to\ncome and tell them about World War II. Okay. I came in and one of the kids -- you want\nto hear? This 1s incredible. All assembly of the high school, one of the kids gets up \u2014\nand I'm pretty good at geography. So I walked over. I wanted -- I like to show them,\nhow did so many Jews get there, to Poland, and I'm a history buff. So I know the history\nof the Jewish people.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay. And I like a -- what do you call -- a blackboard, and I draw Poland, show them\nhow the Jews got from the -- after the Spanish Inquisition. It's incredible, and I'll tell\nyou, that's better than any history book, and I show them exactly where Auschwitz was,\nwhere Warsaw was, where I lived, right, and I tell them after I finish -- I wasn't even\nfinished. One of the kids gets up, I ask -- I love to ask, \"Any questions?\"\nOne kid, sitting there, gets up and says, \"Sir, if there was something what made you\nreally survive all this?\" I says, well, it's not easy to give you an answer, I says, but I\nprefaced it by telling, \"Look, this is a public school. I'm not going to tell you, but I had a\nvery good religious background.\" I said, \"By religious I don't mean Orthodox, but I\nknow \u2014 I know my history,\" I says. And all I learned is something that made me -- the\nfirst moment I got in there I told them this story of being \u2014 of looking into this SS man's\nmiddle, right, and seeing Gott mit uns. Listen to this, the kid gets up and says, \"You\nknow my grandfather\" -- this could have been -- I tell you, I couldn't have planned it any\nbetter. \"My grandfather came here from the Ukraine and he had one of those, and it says\nGott mit uns\" -- listen to this -- \"one of those belt buckles. We erased the swastika and\nthe SS, but Gott mit uns is still on there.\" I almost flipped out.",
        "Q: What did you say?",
        "A: I didn't know. I didn't know -- I didn't say a word because I was afraid. I was really\nhesitant. I says --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- what happens if his grandfather was an SS man?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: How did he get \u2014 how did he get this belt buckle? Did he get it from -- I'll tell you,\nthe people there, I couldn't have said anything better in my whole speech, because it lent\ncredence to what I told.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It was unbelievable. That's why I'm telling you this.",
        "Q: That's amazing. Actually, that's an amazing --",
        "A: This just happened about two months ago.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: Over at the -- what do you call it? Pennington High School. Unbelievable. So\nanyway, it did the trick.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So now back to after you were doing this job for -- after -- I mean after you became\nthe assistant to the stubendeinst.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And --",
        "A: I got the job in the sauna.",
        "Q: Yeah.",

        "A: They selected me.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I was -- we used to use the Zyklon B gas to gas the clothing.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: You follow me?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: In the sauna.",
        "Q: To disinfect.",
        "A: In the old sauna, disinfections, right.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: So we used to put on a gas mask. We had an an SS man by the way who was a very\ndecent guy. He brought us into -- I looked for him at the end of the war. I couldn't find\nhim.",
        "Q: What was his name, did you know?",
        "A: George, his first name, that's all.",
        "Q: That's all, yeah.",
        "A: He became friends with the kapo of the --",
        "Q: Of your -- of your --",
        "A: Of the sauna.",
        "Q: Yeah",
        "A: And I have pictures of the kapo of the sauna with other people, but I don't have a\npicture of him. I looked for him, because we knew when Debruekfeld (ph), he used to\ncome and give us all the political --",
        "Q: All the news?",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And he knew. He knew.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: He came back one day and told us that his job was to pour\nin the gas --",
        "Q: Into the top.",
        "A: -- in crematorium number two from the outside.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And he said, \"I'm not going to do it anymore.\" He started to throw up, and he said,\n\"I'm going to probably not be here. They're going to send me to the Russian front.\" He\nwas scared to death. They never did. He never did it after that. Okay. So there were\ndecent, of course --",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: -- there were decent.",
        "Q: Otherwise, you wouldn't have survived.",

        "Q: No one could have survived --",
        "A: No, no --",
        "Q: -- by themselves?",
        "A: -- not with that a system, correct, correct.",
        "Q: It's not possible, no.",
        "A: Absolutely, absolutely.",
        "Q: So -- so now, there was -- I want to move on to the time -- I don't know how much\nfurther this was when you fell asleep and didn\u2019t \u2014 and weren't up for apel.",
        "A: This was -- I was already working in the sauna.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I don't know how long, months. I can't tell you the exact dates, but anyway, you're\nonly dealing with about two and a half years, anyway, period.",
        "Q: Sure, sure.",
        "A: So I know when this happened. There was one chamber that was a dry chamber in\nthat sauna, okay, in the old sauna building. Okay. There was a place where we used to\ngas the clothes, a place for showers, because the prisoners used to come in about once a\nmonth or whatever, you know, for lousing.",
        "Q: Yes, delousing.",
        "A: You know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Delousing or whatever.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Right. Delousing, right. I should get it right, because lousing is different. Okay.\nSundays -- it was a Sunday. It was very warm in that chamber, and the guys who worked\nthere, there were about three or four other fellas, okay, went in after the morning roll call.\nWe had a morning roll call, the apel, which was less than a few minutes, and the 1:00\no'clock was the big apel. Wisnia goes to sleep there, and I wake up. It got so quiet. It\nmust have been about 10 after 1:00 and there's nobody in there. I look out the window of\nthe sauna and I can see (?indecipherable?) the general, with his desk, in the middle of the\nroad of Birkenau. The whole camp is standing at attention so to speak. They're looking\nfor Wisnia. You can imagine. They didn't know yet who it was, but they knew there was\none --",
        "Q: Missing.",
        "A: -- person missing. When I woke up --",
        "Q: Well, the number actually.",
        "A: Hmm?",
        "Q: It would have been the number.",
        "A: One number, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: The number.",
        "A: They had to get the number. They knew what cell block, because we stayed all on the\noutside lined up. There was somebody missing from that cell block. I woke myself up,\nand I see everybody, and I started to run from the sauna, from here all the way through\nthe barracks, the side of the barracks down to cell block 15, which is on the left, and I\ntried to hide in between the people, but they wouldn't let me, because they already found\nout there was somebody missing there. You can imagine.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: You talk about luck.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The SS man who is doing the count comes over to cell block, blockalteste tells him\nthat, you know, this is the fella's here.",
        "Q: He's arrived?",
        "A: Brings me up to the center road. There's the desk with the general taking the count,\nright, from all the cell blocks. You realize, there must have been 50,000, 40,000\nprisoners. I'm talking about men, just men. The women's camp is on the other side.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay. He takes me, and guess who is the SS man reporting to the -- what do you call\nit?",
        "Q: The one who drops the canisters in?",
        "A: No. George.",
        "Q: George, that's what I mean, yeah.",
        "A: George.",
        "Q: The one who was -- who was your --",
        "A: George is the SS man who is taking me over there.",
        "Q: The sauna.",
        "A: And he winks to me. I'm standing next to the ditch, it was sort of like water, with his\ngun in one hand and with his hook, like a meat hook, and he goes over to me, and says,\n\"You make one move and you're dead,\" and there's the general standing right there. He's\nsaying it for his benefit. He's winking to me. Okay. I didn't move. All right. I knew I\nwas in trouble. I immediate -- I knew that was the end. I got sick after that, right, a\ncouple of -- I had a regular trial in the schreibsteube, you know, where they do the\nrecords and I was sent in for three -- to three months 1n the strafkommando.",
        "Q: Which is hard labor?",
        "A: Which ts -- it's like -- I'll tell you, it's a -- they would have killed -- if it was anybody\nelse, they would have killed them immediately. They just would have shot them. Okay.\nI could see it. He's like punching me or -- I'm standing up, figured oh-oh, Wisnia you\nreally did it now. About -- I got -- I don't know if you call it typhoid. They put me in cell\nblock number seven. I guess a combination of everything, that did it, and the boys from\nthe sauna used to send in all kinds, to make sure that I was okay. Remember, I wasn't a\nregular prisoner anymore.",
        "Q: No, no, no. Yeah.",
        "A: I was working in the sauna, that was a quite a --",
        "Q: A privilege.",
        "A: Quite a privilege.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Sure. And I didn't live by the rations. We could --",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: We could organize. We could steal anything we could --",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "A: -- from the clothing that came. You have no idea what people brought.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Okay. So after I got a little better, I come out and go back to the -- to my sauna job. I\ndon't think I stayed there for three months. I think I stayed for only about six weeks or\nseven weeks. I had to go out to work and that wasn't fun, you know, being in the\nstrafkommando. They gave me a mock hanging when I walked in, put me on kleea (ph),\nyou know what I mean --",
        "Q: Ona noose?",
        "A: -- ona hole regular, and then did the trap door. I fell straight through. That was the\ninitiation into the -- but the kapo from the sauna must have said something to the\nblockalteste from the strafkommando, take care of this kid, I mean I don't want him to die\nhere because I was his boy.",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: So the wind up, I come back to the sauna and I only -- it only got better as I went\nalong. One of these days, one of those days, Tippy comes on an excursion to the sauna,\nyou know, to check on the system there, whatever, with her SS people, and she sees me\non the side, and I was in very good shape, and we start exchanging glances and we start\nsaying a few words, and a romance develops. Okay. I didn't know how old she was.\nLook, to me, it's a woman. She was a girl.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So she came quite -- I think we must have -- that was '43, throughout '44.",
        "Q: Yeah. You met regularly?",
        "A: Yeah. Whenever she could get away or come to the new sauna. We moved, by the\nway. That old sauna was moved to a new location between crematorium four and five.\nThey built a new sauna.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Must have made a whole big deal. It's there, still there.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But we met, yes.",
        "Q: Something about singing saving your life in that strafkommando? No?",
        "A: Where? I did in strafkommando too.",
        "Q: You sang there?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: That -- that helped?",
        "A: Of course. Of course.",
        "Q: And who did you sing for?",
        "A: The blockalteste, the same. Remember the man in charge of the cell block.",
        "Q: The kapo or the blockalteste?",
        "A: No, no. The blockalteste. He was the --",
        "Q: Life or death?",
        "A: Life or death.",
        "Q: Yep, yep. And so this strafkommando liked music well?",
        "A: Strafkommando, of course.",
        "Q: And he -- and he -- and he would request music as well?",
        "A: Sure, would request --",
        "Q: Was he -- was he a Pole?",
        "A: He was a Pole -- no, no, he was a German.",
        "Q: He was an German. A politico?",
        "A: He was -- no.",
        "Q: He was a green\u2019?",
        "A: He was a green.",
        "Q: He was a green badge?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: He had a black uniform.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah. So he was a criminal?",
        "A: Sure. He was a criminal.",
        "Q: What was he like?",
        "A: To me, there weren't --",
        "Q: He wasn't so bad?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Yeah, well, I mean he -- like he -- he --",
        "A: I'm sure he must have beat everybody.",
        "Q: Yeah, sure.",
        "A: It was -- this wasn't a --",
        "Q: It's not a holiday. It's not a holiday camp.",
        "A: Absolutely. Absolutely.",
        "Q: Okay. What did you -- so back to the sauna, and then --",
        "A: Fast forward to 1944.",
        "Q: Yeah. So fast forward to 1944.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: You're having -- you're meeting Tippy regularly. You're working back in the sauna?",
        "A: That's right.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Working in -- we moved over from --",
        "Q: You moved to the new one.",
        "A: -- the regular camp to the new sauna. I have my own office in the sauna.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: I have quite -- I was an old prisoner --",
        "Q: Yeah, sure.",
        "A: -- who knew everybody.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Even the Germans. You follow me?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Even the SS men, when they looked at my number, I'm here. They said he must\nknow somebody. Okay.",
        "Q: Yeah, that's how the system worked?",
        "A: There was a kapo, the kapo of the Bekleidungskammer, Klauser, who was an\nAustrian, never knew he was Jewish. As a matter of fact, my friend Shia Kaulfus (ph)\nwent to his funeral in Austria. He was Catholic but he had a Jewish ancestry so he was a\ntaken in there.",
        "Q: Yep.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: [used to sing for him.",
        "Q: German songs?",
        "A: I was -- German songs.",
        "Q: For him. He liked German songs? (?1ndecipherable?)",
        "A: He liked German --",
        "Q: Sort of the like the popular stuff or --",
        "A: I'm trying to remember.",
        "Q: That's okay.",
        "A: It's little difficult.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: But you know, it was mostly popular stuff.",
        "Q: Sure, sure.",
        "A: So.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: But it is singing that saved, there's no question about it. It was -- it singled me out as\ndifferent from anybody else, and I was. Consequently, of course, I got more food. I got\ndifferent food. I got access to everything I wanted.",
        "Q: Yep.",
        "A: As a matter of fact, when I used to meet Tippy in one of the blocks that was lined up\nwith clothing and there was a special place, a hiding place about a story high where there\nwas clothing. We used to get in there through the side so.",
        "Q: Tell me, when the crematorium, was it four or five --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I can't remember which one was blown up.",
        "A: Four.",
        "Q: Four. That's when, I'm guessing was --",
        "A: That was '44.",
        "Q: That was the end of '44?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And transports had already stopped by --",
        "A: Hold it, no. Transports stopped in November of '44.",
        "Q: November, so yeah.",
        "A: Well, let me tell you, when I -- fast forward to '44. We're beginning to hear artillery,\nyou know, at night. We learned to distinguish, ba-boom, ba-boom. We knew it wasn't\nGerman.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It would have had to be -- we were closer to the Russian side of course.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: You know where Auschwitz is?",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Krakow.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Czechoslovakia.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Near the Ukraine.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Going in that direction. We're beginning to hear, and we figured survive another\nweek, another month. You know, that was the whole point, try to survive. Eventually,\nwe knew, and George told us they're going to lose the war. He knew tt.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: He knew it. As a matter of fact, he used to tell us, the Russian front is -- it's about 50\nor 60 miles away, and they were scared to death of the Russians. Well, because of what\nthey did to the Russians, you can imagine.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.",
        "A: It's no surprise. So that was the greatest fear among the SS is that they were going to\nbe sent to the Russian front.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Because they knew that had they done that, anything out of the __, that was the end.\nSo are you all right?",
        "Q: Yeah. I'm just checking.",
        "A: So at one of the liaisons with Tippy, she -- we agreed and we made up our mind if\nwe're going to survive, at the end of the war, let us meet in front of the Jewish\nCommunity Center in Warsaw, (?undecipherable?) and I figured -- I don't know why I\nfigured it was going to be there. I figured let's meet over there. Okay. I go on the\ntransport, on the death march.",
        "Q: To Gleiwitz?",
        "A: To Gletiwitz, on --",
        "Q: This is what --",
        "A: On one of -- this is in December of 1944.",
        "Q: 1944. Yep.",
        "A: They stopped gassing -- I remember the uprising, because the sauna was right next\ndoor to the crematorium. I remember the boys running around and the machine guns\nwere set up, and they locked up our areas so that they shouldn't come into our -- we knew\nwhat was going on.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So the windup was that after they finished that, they actually stopped the gassings.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: What do you call it, this was after the large transports, after the Hungarian --",
        "Q: After the (?indeciperhable?) transports.",
        "A: The whole -- I remember (?indeciperhable?) bit when they took them -- they were\nsupposed to go to the train station but they went to crematorium five. Oh, it was -- I\nknew the whole story of what was going because I was privy. I wasn't a\n(?indeciperhable?) you know.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, yes, yes.",
        "A: So I knew what was going on.",
        "Q: Yep.",
        "A: The windup was that we -- on the march, the march was not good. I escaped from the\nmarch. That was my first attempt to escape, but they rounded us up and again they didn't\nshoot us, because we are strafed, you know, and then when we tried to walk --",
        "Q: By Russian bombers?",
        "A: By the Russian planes, and wait, you're talking about something playing a trick on\nme, the Russian planes we saw stars, red stars, right? Who cared, red stars, green stars,\nas long as it wasn't the swastika, right? They attached themselves, and believe me, there\nwas something for us to see, some of the Germans, wounded, no arms, no legs. They\nused to attach themselves with trucks, tanks, follow the column. Remember, you're\ntalking about thousands of people marching. Not too far, that wasn't near Gleiwitz. That\nwas in a different place. Yeah, we stay over in Gleiwitz in the train depot. Then they put\nus on a train -- open train to Dachau.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Yep.",
        "A: Okay. From the open train, I escaped with about 12 other guys. We made our way, I\ndon't even know where, but we saw there was chaos. There was a, what do you call it, a\nstrafing or bombing. We didn't know who, by whom. Anyway, an SS men starts\nsearching and he winds -- winds us -- rounds us all up, brings us back to the train and we\nget back on the train. Why he didn't kill us, I don't know. Okay. We go to Dachau. We\narrive in Dachau. No point in going into details. Open cars, freezing. God almighty.\nJanuary. February, probably. You can imagine in Germany. Okay. We wind up -- I\ncome into Dachau. If you ever saw when I came into Auschwitz, no comparison. This\nwas ten times worse.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Why? No place to sit. No place to stand. No place to sleep. No place to eat.\nTyphoid rampant. From all over, you know --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- they got the people.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I knew already then, if you could only again survive a little bit, you know, you\nmight make it.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I talked to myself.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: So the windup, I hang around the schreibestube of, what do you call it, Dachau,\naround there, the closest barracks on the side. I don't know how long we were in Dachau.\nBut in Dachau itself, I saw -- this was worse than Auschwitz, for me it was worse. I\ncouldn't. One day I see a sign up there, must have been about a couple of days or\nsomething like. Anybody who can carry a -- is it 50 or 75-pound -- not pound, kilo of\nsomething, of cement, report. We need to work -- they were \u2014 they wanted to work on\nthe underground hangars for the airplanes. It is now -- must be February. Okay.\nEverybody's strong enough. I'm strong enough. I want to get out of here, because I'm not\ngoing to be able to survive here. I don't know anybody. No longer privileged prisoner.\nYou can imagine.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: I mean you're in better condition than most.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Having already been --",
        "A: Well, many. There were \u2014 there were some. This was a group from all over the\nplace, remember.",
        "Q: Exactly. So there might have been --",
        "A: So they get together, I think -- I don't remember exactly how many, and we're put on\na train and they're going to take us to Muhldorf. Do you know where Muhldorf is?",
        "Q: Muhldorf was --",
        "A: Going a little further south, but --",
        "Q: Yeah, into Austria.",
        "A: Into Austria.",
        "Q: On the way to Mauthausen.",
        "A: I don't know. I was --",
        "Q: I think so.",
        "A: -- never in Mauthausen.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So anyway \u2014 anyway, that's what they told us.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Wisnia had enough of that crap. So I figured I am strong enough, and if I can hear \u2014\nand there are -- as we get on the train, about two or three times, I don't remember exactly,\nwe have air raids.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: You know, strafing of the train.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Now, who looks at planes, what strafing, right. We knew they get us out of the train\ninto the ditches, also supported with clothes, but every day as I looked, the guards\nbecame older.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, I had a pretty good eye for that point.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, to see what's going on. How do you survive another day? So one of\nthese, we made an attempt, a whole group, to run away, but they rounded us up. On the\nnext time, I figured I ain't going with a group, I'm going by myself. Okay. No point in\ngoing into the details. I had a shovel over there on the side. It was one of the guys that\nwas guarding us. I smacked him right in the head. As he was trying to gather us, there\nwas nobody else and I took off.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Where do I go? It's just beginning, so it's now the beginning, I say, of March -- I\nwould say the end of February, beginning of March, one day it's nice, one day it's --",
        "Q: Horrible.",
        "A: Horrible.",
        "Q: Yep.",
        "A: So I'm going towards the fire. I figured the only way -- no compass. Don't know my\nway. I know I'm in Germany. I'm outside of Munich, Dachau, but away from there\nbecause we -- we're closer to Muhldorf. Now, from what I understand, we didn't go to\nMuhldrof. We went up north to Merching. I found that out from the historian of the\n10 1st.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I wanted to find out where did I the meet you guys? Where was this? Anyway, I\nwalk only at night, hide in the day. It must have been about two or three days in the\nbarns, food, plentiful. Whatever the chickens ate, I had more food than I wanted. Okay.\nI get up one morning to find a place to hide and the whole war stopped. I didn't realize\nhow important I was. There was no fire. I walked towards the artillery fire. There was\nno fire. I figured well, the war is over. Well, let me pull up. I get up on a little hill. I\nlook down. There's the most gorgeous highway, but I'm trying to find a place for the, you\nknow, for the day to hide --",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: -- because I wouldn't walk anywhere. I look down and I begin to hear a roar of tanks.\nIf I ever prayed in my life, I sure prayed that time and said oh, God, don't let there be a\nswastika or don't let there be a black cross that they used to have on the tank.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: The column comes closer and closer and closer, and I see the first tank. There's a\ncolumn of about 15, 16 tanks with trucks with a lineup, really, and I see the white star.\nOkay.",
        "Q: Yep.",
        "A: Now, to me, I thought it was Russian, because --",
        "Q: It's a star",
        "A: -- I was used to seeing the star.",
        "Q: Yeah, the red star, yeah, white star.",
        "A: Never dreaming that it could be American, really, couldn't have -- somehow it went\ncompletely out of my mind.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So I start to run down from that incline. I have a note here from Sergeant -- Staff\nSergeant Ballou. He says, \"I still remember you coming down the hill.\" I start running\ndown. The only thing that gave a me away, I didn't have much hair, but I had civilian\nclothes.",
        "Q: So you didn't have stripes?",
        "A: Oh, no. I had gotten rid of that --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- along time ago --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- before we went to Gleiwitz, I had already gotten rid of that.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Sure. I had civilian clothes. I come down and didn't have enough strength to get in\nfront of the tank. Right at the ditch alongside -- I didn't know how important I was. The\nwhole column stopped. The war, it stopped for Wisnia. You think Wisnia is important,\nright? Out of the hatch crawls out a -- first tank stops, crawls out a Captain James L.\nWalker from South Carolina. I mean I knew words in English because I had learned\nwords. You know, you don't learn sentences.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You learn words, right? He crawls out. He immediately knew I escaped from\nsomewhere. I go over to him. I says, \"You, Russian?\" He says, \"No, no, no. merican.\" |\nsaid, oh-oh, they're trying to trick me. I says, \"You, Russian?\" He says, \"No, American.\nWhere ya come from\" -- you know, with that southern -- I never heard such\nEnglish in my life. I never heard English in my life, but not like this. He says, \"Where\nyou escape? Train? SS?\" Something -- I got words. I says, \"Yes, SS, train.\" He knew I\nescaped from a train. I should take him. You follow? I should lead the column where.\nCan't speak to her. I have a brain, I'm in the ditch and there's the tank, right, and the\nwhole column is stopped. They all stopped. So he says -- I said to him, \"Any Polish?\"\nHe got the message. I'm looking for somebody I can talk to, Polish. He said, \"Yeah, we\ngot one. Fred Wiltsack (ph), Fred Wiltsack.\" Yells down, and the road. You had to see\nthe tanks. There was enough room for a jeep to drive by, takes a few minutes. A jeep\ndrives up with Fred Wiltsack from Pawtucket, Rhode Island. By the way, he came to his\nbar mitzvah. I got him coming. Fred Wiltsack comes up and he goes over to me and he\nsays -- starts talking Polish. His Polish was worse than my English. I couldn't talk to\nhim. Couldn't talk to him. They want me take them where the SS is. I can't tell them.\nOkay. Wait. I'm not finished. I had a brainstorm. I figured, you see, I heard the story\nthat there were Germans disguised as Americans, you follow me?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I figured, you know, after all, you know, that I saw, I figured that can't be true.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. You were very suspicious.",
        "A: Can't be true. Can't be true. So I said, \"Any Yiddish?\" You see, you don't say\nJewish, because in Europe, it's not Jewish, it's Yiddish.",
        "Q: It's Yiddish, yeah, sure.",
        "A: Okay. So I said to this captain, I says, \"Anybody Yiddish?\" He says, \"Yeah, we got\none.\" He yells down again, \"Harry Weiner. Harry Weiner.\" Harry Weiner from\nTarzana, California drives up on a jeep. The next jeep comes up, you know, like I have\nto explain to me -- you know what? He brought him up. It alleviated a little bit of my\nsuspicion. And he started talking Yiddish. The other guy's Polish was bad, his Yiddish\nwas worse.",
        "Q: Was worse.",
        "A: He came from Tarzana, California. It was a like a comedy of errors. Then they did\nsomething worse. He took me back in the jeep. They wanted to continue. The war was\non.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: So he took me back. He wanted to put me in to check me out, in one of those\nweapons carriers that had the Red Cross on it. I don't know if you saw, the American\nArmy, they had normally following them. I refused to go in there. I was scared. I\nfigured, you know, I heard that that's where they asphyxiate the people.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: And I still didn't believe it. I never left them until I came to the States. That was a\nslow process --",
        "Q: Of building up trust?",
        "A: -- with them, building -- not only building up trust. What they did is I became the\neater of all their Spam. I loved their Spam rations, their chocolate. They all threw it\naway; they gave it to me. Then I got sick eating. They put me in uniform. They taught\nme how to use the Thomson, and let me tell you, that became my family, and really, did\nthey become my family. I'll show you, _ + you know and by the way this is my\ngrandson's --",
        "Q: All right.",
        "A: -- piece of music that he wrote. All right. Here's a picture of the \u2014\u2014 Synagogue.",
        "Q: This is you?",
        "A: That's me. That's my little baby machine gun.",
        "Q: And who is standing next to you?",
        "A: That's another -- I've been searching for him. He doesn't come. He doesn't show up.\nThat's me and that's me too. That's in Zell Am See before we went to -- what do you call\nit? Burcheskan (ph).",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know who that is, don't you?",
        "Q: Who is that?",
        "A: Who is the good looking fella?",
        "Q: That's you?",
        "A: Right. That's my wife.",
        "Q: Yeah, who is the --",
        "A: Menachem Begin.",
        "Q: Oh. I thought so. I should have recognized the glasses.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. You want to see a good looking kid, that's me.",
        "Q: Is that the original photo?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: March '45.",
        "Q: Yeah, amazing.",
        "A: And here this is my friend, Fred Ballou. By the way, this is the group that came to\nlast year's convention in Orlando of my -- that's me over here. And here is the group \u2014\nthis is what's left of my outfit.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: You recognize me. I'm the youngest of the whole group.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, most of the them would be in their 90s, right?",
        "A: They are.",
        "Q: Yeah.",

Because I heard there was _ was\nall blocked off by, what do you call it, Polish police, Yiddi Jewish police, SS on the\noutskirt, because they tried what they call resettlement.

So I made it to the\nplace, to Praga where she was. I knew that Vonda, the older one she was about two\nyears older I guess thanI was working as a waitress in a restaurant in Praga. I knew\nthat from before; how, I don't remember. I went there, she was working. She saw me\nthrough the window. She motioned to me to wait in the little garden there. She finally\ncame out. What are you doing? What are you doing here? I told her my family is no\nlonger. I says, I have to get out of here. She says, Where do you want to go? I says, I\nwant to go to Sochaczew. I didn't even think fast. There were no Jews in Sochaczew.\nWhy the hell was I going to go to Sochaczew? I figured I had to get away from here. So\nshe at the end of it took me to the train station.",

I walked from the station to\nStaszica, which was the street where our building was. And as I approached, somewhere\nI guess how could I think straight, anyway, at that point. I see the facade of the\nbuilding is still there at 17 Staszica Street. But the whole inside is burned out. The\nGermans burned out all the Jewish buildings. Only the skeleton remained.

        "A: All right. We finally -- we tried to get up there and see, look where we were. We\nknew we were going on the side lines of Warsaw. We knew we were going somewhere\nto the east from Nowy Dwor, but we certainly didn't know that we were going south.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: When we were -- I think somebody yelled out he saw some kind of an eradam\n(?indecipherable?) I think they saw.",
        "A: Which meant going south, but who the heck knew. We didn't know.",
        "A: We arrive in Auschwitz-Birkenau. On the siding of the train there when we arrive,\nyou know, the old rush job, you know, where the SS, you know --",

I learned\nGerman, (?a lieb en achsen sin lager.?) I didn't understand what the hell that meant. And\nthey start separating the men. There were still lots of women and lots of children. There\nmust have been about 1,500 people. That was the last transport from Nowy Dwor. Men\nget over to the right. Yeah, the women over to the left going on trucks. Women,\nchildren, young kids. I almost went over to them. You know, I figured well, what the\nhell.",
        "A: All right.",
        "A: But I learned my lesson in don't expect any good things from the Germans. So if you\ncan walk, fine, and particularly, I moved myself over to the side of the men, lined up in\nfives, and this guy, about three rows of fives, an SS man leads us in. They go away\nimmediately, the men -- not the full, whatever went in. I found out of course from my\nbook, out of the 1,500 who came in, 570, which was a high number, because there were\nmostly men, you follow me, younger --",
        "A: That was the last transport, on their feet, right.",
        "A: -- went into the camp --",
        "A: -- selected there and the rest of them went on trucks.",
        "A: Now, we don't know from nothing. As a matter of fact, what's his name, Zlotnick\n(ph), my buddy, his sister was about two years older than him, a gorgeous tall girl,\nalthough, they didn't take any women from that transport.",
        "A: Okay. They ride off into a little forest over there. That was a little white house.\nSome of the guys who came in with their wives, with their families, you know, wanted to\nfind out after we got in, where are the women? Where are the children? So the prisoners\nstarted to laugh at them. So you see that big fire out there, outside of the perimeter of the\ncamp\u2019? They're dead. There's the machine gun them to the best of my knowledge, first.",
        "A: And then burn them in pyres of wood with whatever they did, and I think after about\ntwo or three months, the crematoriums were finished. We were building -- we were\nhelping to build the crematoriums.",
        "A: I was processed in Birkenau.",
        "A: Immediately.",
        "A: We went into a -- we were tattooed.",
        "A: That's right.",
        "A: Tattooed, everything --",
        "A: All the hair shaved --",
        "A: And we went into the sauna.",
        "A: For regular \u2014 regular -- we didn't know.",
        "A: No, we received \u2014 no, there was no gas yet.",
        "A: We received the -- what do you call it, clothing, whatever.",
        "A: You were a big guy, you get short clothes. You're a short guy, you get big -- like in\nthe Army.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: So with wooden clogs. That was the worst, those heavy wooden -- I don't know if\nyou've ever seen them --",
        "A: They call them the Holland --",
        "A: No socks.",
        "A: Oh, used to rub on here, terrible, terrible. You could hear \u2014 you could hear you\ncoming from ten miles away.",
        "A: You know, clank. So anyway, we're assigned to cell block 15, must have been about\n450. The rest of them I think went to a different -- I don't know where -- or maybe the\nwhole 570, I don't know, went into that particular -- in cell block the altestewayouzef (ph)\nThis was the Polish --",
        "A: He gave us a talk when we got in there and each one got -- we got four men sleeping\nin one of those, either four or five. I don't know, some of them were five. I always\nmanaged to get one on top --",
        "A: -- immediately. Sure. I wanted to be on top. So and I was only, I would say about\ntwo or three days, I was like every other prisoner, because I was assigned to the job of\ncleaning, you know, picking up the bodies from the ditch.",
        "A: Committed suicide, right.",
        "A: Yes --well, what they did know -- let's say this is the perimeter of the camp, right?",
        "A: A trip wire, okay, with just a little trip wire, a ditch, electrified by a wired fence,\nsentry box. So not that they needed an excuse. Anybody wanted to commit suicide, very\neasy. You put your foot over that trip wire, which means you're trying to escape. The\nguy would shoot you from the sentry box. Many of them, that's what the German\ntransport did, about two months later, when they found out what was going on there.",
        "A: So that was my job for the first couple of years [sic], to put the bodies together on\ntwo, three guys, you know, heap on a wagon, a wooden wagon, bring it over to a\nparticular cell block, line up and then it went to the crematorium where, crematorium \u2014\nnot the crematorium, the pyre of woods where they did them.",
        "A: I only did this for about I think eight or nine days.",
        "A: Maybe two weeks.",
        "A: Not even that. One night after coming from work in the afternoon, the blockalteste:\nIs there anyone here who sings?\n(?Indeciperhable\u2019?)\nSing. You sing. Everybody, hey, Wisnia, get down. Sing. I get down from my booksa\n(ph). There was a place about the size of this, the middle of the regular tiers of beds, of\nthose wooden booksas (ph), and that was right there. There was a door to a special room\nfor the blockalteste, who was -- he was the boss of life and death really.",
        "A: And Isang. From that moment on, my life changed.",
        "A: Buy me a (?undeciperhable?). Joseph, Joseph, won't you make your mind up.",
        "A: Hebrew, what did I do? He couldn't care less, as long --",
        "A: Didn't matter what it was.",
        "A: I sang.",
        "A: I sang.",
        "A: Yeah, sure. (?undeipherable?) Oh , he loved that. That was very popular. I knew\nevery song. This was my life.",
        "A: So from that moment on, he says, okay, tomorrow you're not going to that job.\nYou're going to stay right here in the -- it was like a revelation.",
        "A: I became a stubendienst. Actually, I couldn't become a stubendienst because the\nstubendienst had some pull from somebody. So I became the assistant to the\nstubendienst.\nYou talk about -- what do you call it, protect ya. Oh, God.",
        "A: Then they came to select people for the various commandos, you follow?",
        "A: I don't remember how often I went out to work. I didn't go out to work very often,\nbut the greatest privilege was when it came to the roll calls, because remember, it was\ncold as hell all the time.",
        "A: Hours. People used to die standing there.",
        "A: So. And they count -- they didn't now how to count. They didn't have a system. If\nyou read -- what's a her name, Tippy's book, you'll see. She's got it tagged right. They\nhad no system.",
        "A: They needed the prisoners to help them with the system.",
        "A: That's why they have a stubendienst, a kapo, a blockalteste, you follow, and if were\nyou in with these --",
        "A: You were in.",
        "A: And my job, and I really -- believe me, if I ever prayed always one more day, let me,\nI've got to -- but I'll tell you something. You know, somebody just asked is me, to what\ndo I attribute my survival at one of my speeches. It took me a long time to figure it out,\nbut I knew the first day when I got undressed in front of the sauna before we went in for\nthe shower, I was standing in front of an SS man who was about 6'6. My eyes fixed in to\nhis belt buckle. You can imagine how tall he was. To me it looked that tall, right? This\nis in front of the sauna. I'll never forget this as long as I live, and I look in, and what does\nit say on the belt buckle -- you won't believe this -- I don't know if you ever heard that,\nGott mit uns. Okay. God is with us.",
        "A: Swastika here --",
        "A: -- in the middle and then SS insignia on the side. I swear I looked in there, and for a\nsecond I had to hold myself back from laughing. I says you son of a bitch -- I didn't say\nthat. I said not the God I learned about. I'm going to do everything in my life to outlive\nyou.",
        "A: I already saw what was going on there, and from that moment on, you will not\nbelieve, I said to myself, 750 Grand Concourse, Bronx, New York; 723 Gates Avenue,\nBrooklyn, New York. Right. I didn't have any pencil. I didn't have anything. I used to\nbe the fancy writer in the house -- in my house. So every time we had -- my mother had\ntwo sisters here in the States. One of them who came in the first world war, elder sister,\nwho lived on the concourse in New York, and the other one who left about six months\nbefore the war broke out. Her younger sister came to her. She took her down before the\nwar. Her name was Helen Borenstein (ph). That played quite a trick on me because I\nscrewed up the addresses. Wait till you hear this one.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: The preservation \u2014",
        "A: What gave me --",
        "A: And I'll tell you something, what gave me, at that moment, I says, it's not what I\nlearned. No, God isn't with them, not the God that I know. I'm going to try to outlive\nyou. I did.",
        "A: I did. And you know, I used -- somebody asked me why do I come in with it now. I\nhad -- I told that story before but I delivered a speech about three months ago, four\nmonths ago over here at -- where my granddaughter lives. The teachers wanted me to\ncome and tell them about World War II. Okay. I came in and one of the kids -- you want\nto hear? This 1s incredible. All assembly of the high school, one of the kids gets up \u2014\nand I'm pretty good at geography. So I walked over. I wanted -- I like to show them,\nhow did so many Jews get there, to Poland, and I'm a history buff. So I know the history\nof the Jewish people.",
        "A: Okay. And I like a -- what do you call -- a blackboard, and I draw Poland, show them\nhow the Jews got from the -- after the Spanish Inquisition. It's incredible, and I'll tell\nyou, that's better than any history book, and I show them exactly where Auschwitz was,\nwhere Warsaw was, where I lived, right, and I tell them after I finish -- I wasn't even\nfinished. One of the kids gets up, I ask -- I love to ask, \"Any questions?\"\nOne kid, sitting there, gets up and says, \"Sir, if there was something what made you\nreally survive all this?\" I says, well, it's not easy to give you an answer, I says, but I\nprefaced it by telling, \"Look, this is a public school. I'm not going to tell you, but I had a\nvery good religious background.\" I said, \"By religious I don't mean Orthodox, but I\nknow \u2014 I know my history,\" I says. And all I learned is something that made me -- the\nfirst moment I got in there I told them this story of being \u2014 of looking into this SS man's\nmiddle, right, and seeing Gott mit uns. Listen to this, the kid gets up and says, \"You\nknow my grandfather\" -- this could have been -- I tell you, I couldn't have planned it any\nbetter. \"My grandfather came here from the Ukraine and he had one of those, and it says\nGott mit uns\" -- listen to this -- \"one of those belt buckles. We erased the swastika and\nthe SS, but Gott mit uns is still on there.\" I almost flipped out.",
        "A: I didn't know. I didn't know -- I didn't say a word because I was afraid. I was really\nhesitant. I says --",
        "A: -- what happens if his grandfather was an SS man?",
        "A: How did he get \u2014 how did he get this belt buckle? Did he get it from -- I'll tell you,\nthe people there, I couldn't have said anything better in my whole speech, because it lent\ncredence to what I told.",
        "A: It was unbelievable. That's why I'm telling you this.",
        "A: This just happened about two months ago.",

        "A: He became friends with the kapo of the --",
        "A: Of the sauna.",
        "A: And I have pictures of the kapo of the sauna with other people, but I don't have a\npicture of him. I looked for him, because we knew when Debruekfeld (ph), he used to\ncome and give us all the political --",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",

        "A: So I know when this happened. There was one chamber that was a dry chamber in\nthat sauna, okay, in the old sauna building. Okay. There was a place where we used to\ngas the clothes, a place for showers, because the prisoners used to come in about once a\nmonth or whatever, you know, for lousing.",
        "A: You know.",
        "A: Delousing or whatever.",
        "A: Right. Delousing, right. I should get it right, because lousing is different. Okay.\nSundays -- it was a Sunday. It was very warm in that chamber, and the guys who worked\nthere, there were about three or four other fellas, okay, went in after the morning roll call.\nWe had a morning roll call, the apel, which was less than a few minutes, and the 1:00\no'clock was the big apel. Wisnia goes to sleep there, and I wake up. It got so quiet. It\nmust have been about 10 after 1:00 and there's nobody in there. I look out the window of\nthe sauna and I can see (?indecipherable?) the general, with his desk, in the middle of the\nroad of Birkenau. The whole camp is standing at attention so to speak. They're looking\nfor Wisnia. You can imagine. They didn't know yet who it was, but they knew there was\none --",

        "A: They had to get the number. They knew what cell block, because we stayed all on the\noutside lined up. There was somebody missing from that cell block. I woke myself up,\nand I see everybody, and I started to run from the sauna, from here all the way through\nthe barracks, the side of the barracks down to cell block 15, which is on the left, and I\ntried to hide in between the people, but they wouldn't let me, because they already found\nout there was somebody missing there. You can imagine.",
        "A: You talk about luck.",
        "A: The SS man who is doing the count comes over to cell block, blockalteste tells him\nthat, you know, this is the fella's here.",
        "A: Brings me up to the center road. There's the desk with the general taking the count,\nright, from all the cell blocks. You realize, there must have been 50,000, 40,000\nprisoners. I'm talking about men, just men. The women's camp is on the other side.",
        "A: Okay. He takes me, and guess who is the SS man reporting to the -- what do you call\nit?",
        "A: No. George.",
        "A: George.",
        "A: George is the SS man who is taking me over there.",
        "A: And he winks to me. I'm standing next to the ditch, it was sort of like water, with his\ngun in one hand and with his hook, like a meat hook, and he goes over to me, and says,\n\"You make one move and you're dead,\" and there's the general standing right there. He's\nsaying it for his benefit. He's winking to me. Okay. I didn't move. All right. I knew I\nwas in trouble. I immediate -- I knew that was the end. I got sick after that, right, a\ncouple of -- I had a regular trial in the schreibsteube, you know, where they do the\nrecords and I was sent in for three -- to three months 1n the strafkommando.",
        "A: Which ts -- it's like -- I'll tell you, it's a -- they would have killed -- if it was anybody\nelse, they would have killed them immediately. They just would have shot them. Okay.\nI could see it. He's like punching me or -- I'm standing up, figured oh-oh, Wisnia you\nreally did it now. About -- I got -- I don't know if you call it typhoid. They put me in cell\nblock number seven. I guess a combination of everything, that did it, and the boys from\nthe sauna used to send in all kinds, to make sure that I was okay. Remember, I wasn't a\nregular prisoner anymore.",
        "A: I was working in the sauna, that was a quite a --",
        "A: Quite a privilege.",
        "A: Sure. And I didn't live by the rations. We could --",
        "A: We could organize. We could steal anything we could --",
        "A: -- from the clothing that came. You have no idea what people brought.",
        "A: Okay. So after I got a little better, I come out and go back to the -- to my sauna job. I\ndon't think I stayed there for three months. I think I stayed for only about six weeks or\nseven weeks. I had to go out to work and that wasn't fun, you know, being in the\nstrafkommando. They gave me a mock hanging when I walked in, put me on kleea (ph),\nyou know what I mean --",
        "A: -- ona hole regular, and then did the trap door. I fell straight through. That was the\ninitiation into the -- but the kapo from the sauna must have said something to the\nblockalteste from the strafkommando, take care of this kid, I mean I don't want him to die\nhere because I was his boy.",
        "A: So the wind up, I come back to the sauna and I only -- it only got better as I went\nalong. One of these days, one of those days, Tippy comes on an excursion to the sauna,\nyou know, to check on the system there, whatever, with her SS people, and she sees me\non the side, and I was in very good shape, and we start exchanging glances and we start\nsaying a few words, and a romance develops. Okay. I didn't know how old she was.\nLook, to me, it's a woman. She was a girl.",
        "A: So she came quite -- I think we must have -- that was '43, throughout '44.",
        "A: Yeah. Whenever she could get away or come to the new sauna. We moved, by the\nway. That old sauna was moved to a new location between crematorium four and five.\nThey built a new sauna.",
        "A: Must have made a whole big deal. It's there, still there.",
        "A: So.",
        "A: But we met, yes.",
        "A: Where? I did in strafkommando too.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Of course. Of course.",
        "A: The blockalteste, the same. Remember the man in charge of the cell block.",
        "A: No, no. The blockalteste. He was the --",
        "A: Life or death.",
        "A: Strafkommando, of course.",
        "A: Sure, would request --",
        "A: He was a Pole -- no, no, he was a German.",
        "A: He was -- no.",
        "A: He was a green.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: He had a black uniform.",
        "A: Sure. He was a criminal.",
        "A: To me, there weren't --",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: I'm sure he must have beat everybody.",
        "A: It was -- this wasn't a --",
        "A: Absolutely. Absolutely.",
        "A: Fast forward to 1944.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: That's right.",
        "A: Working in -- we moved over from --",
        "A: -- the regular camp to the new sauna. I have my own office in the sauna.",
        "A: I have quite -- I was an old prisoner --",
        "A: -- who knew everybody.",
        "A: Even the Germans. You follow me?",
        "A: Even the SS men, when they looked at my number, I'm here. They said he must\nknow somebody. Okay.",
        "A: There was a kapo, the kapo of the Bekleidungskammer, Klauser, who was an\nAustrian, never knew he was Jewish. As a matter of fact, my friend Shia Kaulfus (ph)\nwent to his funeral in Austria. He was Catholic but he had a Jewish ancestry so he was a\ntaken in there.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: [used to sing for him.",
        "A: I was -- German songs.",
        "A: He liked German --",
        "A: I'm trying to remember.",
        "A: It's little difficult.",
        "A: But you know, it was mostly popular stuff.",
        "A: So.",
        "A: But it is singing that saved, there's no question about it. It was -- it singled me out as\ndifferent from anybody else, and I was. Consequently, of course, I got more food. I got\ndifferent food. I got access to everything I wanted.",
        "A: As a matter of fact, when I used to meet Tippy in one of the blocks that was lined up\nwith clothing and there was a special place, a hiding place about a story high where there\nwas clothing. We used to get in there through the side so.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Four.",
        "A: That was '44.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Hold it, no. Transports stopped in November of '44.",
        "A: Well, let me tell you, when I -- fast forward to '44. We're beginning to hear artillery,\nyou know, at night. We learned to distinguish, ba-boom, ba-boom. We knew it wasn't\nGerman.",
        "A: It would have had to be -- we were closer to the Russian side of course.",
        "A: You know where Auschwitz is?",
        "A: Krakow.",
        "A: Czechoslovakia.",
        "A: Near the Ukraine.",
        "A: Going in that direction. We're beginning to hear, and we figured survive another\nweek, another month. You know, that was the whole point, try to survive. Eventually,\nwe knew, and George told us they're going to lose the war. He knew tt.",
        "A: He knew it. As a matter of fact, he used to tell us, the Russian front is -- it's about 50\nor 60 miles away, and they were scared to death of the Russians. Well, because of what\nthey did to the Russians, you can imagine.",
        "A: It's no surprise. So that was the greatest fear among the SS is that they were going to\nbe sent to the Russian front.",
        "A: Because they knew that had they done that, anything out of the __, that was the end.\nSo are you all right?",
        "A: So at one of the liaisons with Tippy, she -- we agreed and we made up our mind if\nwe're going to survive, at the end of the war, let us meet in front of the Jewish\nCommunity Center in Warsaw, (?undecipherable?) and I figured -- I don't know why I\nfigured it was going to be there. I figured let's meet over there. Okay. I go on the\ntransport, on the death march.",
        "A: To Gletiwitz, on --",
        "A: On one of -- this is in December of 1944.",
        "A: They stopped gassing -- I remember the uprising, because the sauna was right next\ndoor to the crematorium. I remember the boys running around and the machine guns\nwere set up, and they locked up our areas so that they shouldn't come into our -- we knew\nwhat was going on.",
        "A: So the windup was that after they finished that, they actually stopped the gassings.",
        "A: What do you call it, this was after the large transports, after the Hungarian --",
        "A: The whole -- I remember (?indeciperhable?) bit when they took them -- they were\nsupposed to go to the train station but they went to crematorium five. Oh, it was -- I\nknew the whole story of what was going because I was privy. I wasn't a\n(?indeciperhable?) you know.",
        "A: So I knew what was going on.",
        "A: The windup was that we -- on the march, the march was not good. I escaped from the\nmarch. That was my first attempt to escape, but they rounded us up and again they didn't\nshoot us, because we are strafed, you know, and then when we tried to walk --",
        "A: By the Russian planes, and wait, you're talking about something playing a trick on\nme, the Russian planes we saw stars, red stars, right? Who cared, red stars, green stars,\nas long as it wasn't the swastika, right? They attached themselves, and believe me, there\nwas something for us to see, some of the Germans, wounded, no arms, no legs. They\nused to attach themselves with trucks, tanks, follow the column. Remember, you're\ntalking about thousands of people marching. Not too far, that wasn't near Gleiwitz. That\nwas in a different place. Yeah, we stay over in Gleiwitz in the train depot. Then they put\nus on a train -- open train to Dachau.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Okay. From the open train, I escaped with about 12 other guys. We made our way, I\ndon't even know where, but we saw there was chaos. There was a, what do you call it, a\nstrafing or bombing. We didn't know who, by whom. Anyway, an SS men starts\nsearching and he winds -- winds us -- rounds us all up, brings us back to the train and we\nget back on the train. Why he didn't kill us, I don't know. Okay. We go to Dachau. We\narrive in Dachau. No point in going into details. Open cars, freezing. God almighty.\nJanuary. February, probably. You can imagine in Germany. Okay. We wind up -- I\ncome into Dachau. If you ever saw when I came into Auschwitz, no comparison. This\nwas ten times worse.",
        "A: Why? No place to sit. No place to stand. No place to sleep. No place to eat.\nTyphoid rampant. From all over, you know --",
        "A: -- they got the people.",
        "A: And I knew already then, if you could only again survive a little bit, you know, you\nmight make it.",
        "A: I talked to myself.",
        "A: So the windup, I hang around the schreibestube of, what do you call it, Dachau,\naround there, the closest barracks on the side. I don't know how long we were in Dachau.\nBut in Dachau itself, I saw -- this was worse than Auschwitz, for me it was worse. I\ncouldn't. One day I see a sign up there, must have been about a couple of days or\nsomething like. Anybody who can carry a -- is it 50 or 75-pound -- not pound, kilo of\nsomething, of cement, report. We need to work -- they were \u2014 they wanted to work on\nthe underground hangars for the airplanes. It is now -- must be February. Okay.\nEverybody's strong enough. I'm strong enough. I want to get out of here, because I'm not\ngoing to be able to survive here. I don't know anybody. No longer privileged prisoner.\nYou can imagine.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, many. There were \u2014 there were some. This was a group from all over the\nplace, remember.",
        "A: So they get together, I think -- I don't remember exactly how many, and we're put on\na train and they're going to take us to Muhldorf. Do you know where Muhldorf is?",
        "A: Going a little further south, but --",
        "A: Into Austria.",
        "A: I don't know. I was --",
        "A: -- never in Mauthausen.",
        "A: So anyway \u2014 anyway, that's what they told us.",
        "A: Wisnia had enough of that crap. So I figured I am strong enough, and if I can hear \u2014\nand there are -- as we get on the train, about two or three times, I don't remember exactly,\nwe have air raids.",
        "A: You know, strafing of the train.",
        "A: Now, who looks at planes, what strafing, right. We knew they get us out of the train\ninto the ditches, also supported with clothes, but every day as I looked, the guards\nbecame older.",
        "A: You know, I had a pretty good eye for that point.",
        "A: You know, to see what's going on. How do you survive another day? So one of\nthese, we made an attempt, a whole group, to run away, but they rounded us up. On the\nnext time, I figured I ain't going with a group, I'm going by myself. Okay. No point in\ngoing into the details. I had a shovel over there on the side. It was one of the guys that\nwas guarding us. I smacked him right in the head. As he was trying to gather us, there\nwas nobody else and I took off.",
        "A: Where do I go? It's just beginning, so it's now the beginning, I say, of March -- I\nwould say the end of February, beginning of March, one day it's nice, one day it's --",
        "A: Horrible.",
        "A: So I'm going towards the fire. I figured the only way -- no compass. Don't know my\nway. I know I'm in Germany. I'm outside of Munich, Dachau, but away from there\nbecause we -- we're closer to Muhldorf. Now, from what I understand, we didn't go to\nMuhldrof. We went up north to Merching. I found that out from the historian of the\n10 1st.",
        "A: I wanted to find out where did I the meet you guys? Where was this? Anyway, I\nwalk only at night, hide in the day. It must have been about two or three days in the\nbarns, food, plentiful. Whatever the chickens ate, I had more food than I wanted. Okay.\nI get up one morning to find a place to hide and the whole war stopped. I didn't realize\nhow important I was. There was no fire. I walked towards the artillery fire. There was\nno fire. I figured well, the war is over. Well, let me pull up. I get up on a little hill. I\nlook down. There's the most gorgeous highway, but I'm trying to find a place for the, you\nknow, for the day to hide --",
        "A: -- because I wouldn't walk anywhere. I look down and I begin to hear a roar of tanks.\nIf I ever prayed in my life, I sure prayed that time and said oh, God, don't let there be a\nswastika or don't let there be a black cross that they used to have on the tank.",
        "A: The column comes closer and closer and closer, and I see the first tank. There's a\ncolumn of about 15, 16 tanks with trucks with a lineup, really, and I see the white star.\nOkay.",
        "A: Now, to me, I thought it was Russian, because --",
        "A: -- I was used to seeing the star.",
        "A: Never dreaming that it could be American, really, couldn't have -- somehow it went\ncompletely out of my mind.",
        "A: So I start to run down from that incline. I have a note here from Sergeant -- Staff\nSergeant Ballou. He says, \"I still remember you coming down the hill.\" I start running\ndown. The only thing that gave a me away, I didn't have much hair, but I had civilian\nclothes.",
        "A: Oh, no. I had gotten rid of that --",
        "A: -- along time ago --",
        "A: -- before we went to Gleiwitz, I had already gotten rid of that.",
        "A: Sure. I had civilian clothes. I come down and didn't have enough strength to get in\nfront of the tank. Right at the ditch alongside -- I didn't know how important I was. The\nwhole column stopped. The war, it stopped for Wisnia. You think Wisnia is important,\nright? Out of the hatch crawls out a -- first tank stops, crawls out a Captain James L.\nWalker from South Carolina. I mean I knew words in English because I had learned\nwords. You know, you don't learn sentences.",
        "A: You learn words, right? He crawls out. He immediately knew I escaped from\nsomewhere. I go over to him. I says, \"You, Russian?\" He says, \"No, no, no. merican.\" |\nsaid, oh-oh, they're trying to trick me. I says, \"You, Russian?\" He says, \"No, American.\nWhere ya come from\" -- you know, with that southern -- I never heard such\nEnglish in my life. I never heard English in my life, but not like this. He says, \"Where\nyou escape? Train? SS?\" Something -- I got words. I says, \"Yes, SS, train.\" He knew I\nescaped from a train. I should take him. You follow? I should lead the column where.\nCan't speak to her. I have a brain, I'm in the ditch and there's the tank, right, and the\nwhole column is stopped. They all stopped. So he says -- I said to him, \"Any Polish?\"\nHe got the message. I'm looking for somebody I can talk to, Polish. He said, \"Yeah, we\ngot one. Fred Wiltsack (ph), Fred Wiltsack.\" Yells down, and the road. You had to see\nthe tanks. There was enough room for a jeep to drive by, takes a few minutes. A jeep\ndrives up with Fred Wiltsack from Pawtucket, Rhode Island. By the way, he came to his\nbar mitzvah. I got him coming. Fred Wiltsack comes up and he goes over to me and he\nsays -- starts talking Polish. His Polish was worse than my English. I couldn't talk to\nhim. Couldn't talk to him. They want me take them where the SS is. I can't tell them.\nOkay. Wait. I'm not finished. I had a brainstorm. I figured, you see, I heard the story\nthat there were Germans disguised as Americans, you follow me?",
        "A: And I figured, you know, after all, you know, that I saw, I figured that can't be true.",
        "A: Can't be true. Can't be true. So I said, \"Any Yiddish?\" You see, you don't say\nJewish, because in Europe, it's not Jewish, it's Yiddish.",
        "A: Okay. So I said to this captain, I says, \"Anybody Yiddish?\" He says, \"Yeah, we got\none.\" He yells down again, \"Harry Weiner. Harry Weiner.\" Harry Weiner from\nTarzana, California drives up on a jeep. The next jeep comes up, you know, like I have\nto explain to me -- you know what? He brought him up. It alleviated a little bit of my\nsuspicion. And he started talking Yiddish. The other guy's Polish was bad, his Yiddish\nwas worse.",
        "A: He came from Tarzana, California. It was a like a comedy of errors. Then they did\nsomething worse. He took me back in the jeep. They wanted to continue. The war was\non.",
        "A: So he took me back. He wanted to put me in to check me out, in one of those\nweapons carriers that had the Red Cross on it. I don't know if you saw, the American\nArmy, they had normally following them. I refused to go in there. I was scared. I\nfigured, you know, I heard that that's where they asphyxiate the people.",
        "A: And I still didn't believe it. I never left them until I came to the States. That was a\nslow process --",
        "A: -- with them, building -- not only building up trust. What they did is I became the\neater of all their Spam. I loved their Spam rations, their chocolate. They all threw it\naway; they gave it to me. Then I got sick eating. They put me in uniform. They taught\nme how to use the Thomson, and let me tell you, that became my family, and really, did\nthey become my family. I'll show you, _ + you know and by the way this is my\ngrandson's --",
        "A: -- piece of music that he wrote. All right. Here's a picture of the \u2014\u2014 Synagogue.",
        "A: That's me. That's my little baby machine gun.",
        "A: That's another -- I've been searching for him. He doesn't come. He doesn't show up.\nThat's me and that's me too. That's in Zell Am See before we went to -- what do you call\nit? Burcheskan (ph).",
        "A: You know who that is, don't you?",
        "A: Who is the good looking fella?",
        "A: Right. That's my wife.",
        "A: Menachem Begin.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. You want to see a good looking kid, that's me.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: March '45.",
        "A: And here this is my friend, Fred Ballou. By the way, this is the group that came to\nlast year's convention in Orlando of my -- that's me over here. And here is the group \u2014\nthis is what's left of my outfit.",
        "A: You recognize me. I'm the youngest of the whole group.",
        "A: They are.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: 91, 92.",
        "A: This is Fred Ballou. I remember him. He saw me, I'll tell you, a couple of years ago,\nthree years ago, I think more. He went crazy. Oh, baby, how come you look so good? I\nsays, \"I'm much younger than you guys.\"",
        "A: I stayed with the company until the war -- most of them went home, and of course, I\nwas in Bar-la-Duc, France, which is outside of Reims, in one of the camps -- army\ncamps, and my family found out finally that I was alive, meaning my aunt.",
        "A: And they sent me a $25 money order they wired me, and I needed $25 like a hole in\nthe head. I had more money than, I told you, Carter liver pills. I used to sell cigarettes.",
        "A: Fifty francs --",
        "A: Fifty francs a carton of cigarettes I paid. I sold it for 1,000, and then we moved on to\nParis.",
        "A: I stayed in Versailles. I was stationed in Versailles.",
        "A: And as luck would have it, I have a -- there was a captain -- a lieutenant, Lieutenant\nGeorge C. Pitser (ph) from Chicago, somewhere. I've been trying to find him. I can't\nfind him. They got all kinds of Pitsers, and when saw me, he wrote me a\nrecommendation. You should see the recommendation I got, and he was beside himself.\nI was like I became in charge of the grand decore in Paris of the PX. You know what the\nPX 1s?",
        "A: The post exchange.",
        "A: Post exchange -- no, no. Post exchange, we used to get -- we had ration cards, you\nknow, the --",
        "A: Meaning the Army, the British, the occupying forces, _ cards for ten packs of\ncigarettes a week, boxes of silk. You know, they used to send home, all kinds of goodies.",
        "A: So I was in charge of that.",
        "A: And [had quite a story there. One of the guys comes in, one of the Jewish guys. He's\nnow in Canada.",
        "A: Bernie Wiesholz (ph) . I'll never forget. He's still around, and Bernie says, \"Here, I\ncan see you're not crawling down the mountain.\"\nThis is Fred Wiltsack. Fred is living. I send him a package every year, and Fred came.\nThat's Fred.",
        "A: That's Wiltsack. And this is Fred Ballou.",
        "A: One of the units --",
        "A: Of the 506 parachute infantry came from the under belly, meaning on the south side\nof Austria. I don't know who the other outfit -- there was a French outfit, and I was\nalready -- the people didn't know, you know, that I wasn't an American. I picked up\nEnglish like that. It's no big deal for me, and I spoke German. I spoke Polish. So I had\nan easy access here. We come in May, I think, Ist or May 2nd, something like that. We\ncome into Berchtesgaden. The boys from my outfit, you know, was an only a group that\nwe still had lost two guys who were killed.",
        "A: You know, because the SS -- the Wehrmacht gave up.",
        "A: The SS didn't give up so fast.",

        "A: They did.",
