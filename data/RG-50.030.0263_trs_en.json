        "Q: Would you tell us your name, please?",
        "A: My name is Norbert Yasharoff.",
        "Q: Where were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria in 1930, to the family of a prominent,\nsuccessful Jewish lawyer by the of Yossif, or Joseph, Yasharoff and my mother, Nelly\nthe daughter of Bulgarian Jewish parents who lived in Egypt, Cairo, prior to World War\nOne. And then after the death of my grandfather, my grandmother and her three\ndaughters, including my mother, came back to Bulgaria.",
        "Q: Tell me about growing up in this household. What was your early childhood like?",
        "A: To the best of my recollection, the early childhood was a very pleasant one: a life of\ncomparative plenty, of wonderful vacations either in the mountains or the Black Sea in\nBulgaria, with fine clothes mostly bought by my father on his business trips to Paris and\nother Western European capitals, a peaceful life, a very family life. Our extended family\nwas quite large, and our house, especially while my grandparents was alive \u2014 on my\nfather\u2019s side \u2014 was the center of that life. So major Jewish holidays and any other festive\noccasions were festive, quite festive. We had a large house in downtown Sofia, not far\nfrom the Fire Brigade Headquarters -- which was a landmark at that time \u2014 with a huge\ncourtyard with a gazebo and wonderful trees and flowers. And memories from family\ngatherings either in the gazebo or just sitting in the courtyard in the early evening are\nreally etched in my memory. In sum, until almost the fall \u2014 autumn of 1939, all my\nrecollections are one of a pleasurable, warm and happy childhood.",
        "Q: Do you have any sisters or brothers.",
        "A: Yes, I have a sister. She was born in 1936. She lives in Israel today with her family.",
        "Q: What was your awareness of being a Jewish child in Sofia?",
        "A: Yeah, that a \u2014 my first clash, so to speak, with the reality of being slightly different\nfrom the other children in the public school which I attended when, in the second grade,\nwe started having so called religion lessons, verouchenie' in Bulgarian \u201cstudy of the\nfaith,\u201d which I had to attend, or at least I thought that I had to attend. I was being teased\nby other children about the role or the Jews in killing Christ and so on \u2014 which first took\nme aback and then, of course, became very unpleasant until my parents arranged for me\nto be excused. And there was no problem \u2014 I was excused. But that was the only\nawareness of being different and being sort of set apart or being teased about it. Very\nrarely, the other children would use the Turkish word chifut*, which I understand it to\nmean \u201cinfidel,\u201d or somebody of another, inferior, faith. But that occurred very rarely\nuntil, as I say, the Autumn 1939, and the outbreak of World War Two. Incidentally, we\nwere vacationing in a wonderful hotel, in a spa resort in Bulgaria, Soludervent. And we\nwere \u2014 this was the eve of our return to Sofia at the end of the vacation, August 31st,\nwhen in the evening over the radio came the news of the outbreak of World War Two. I\nwas nine and a half years, my little sister was three. The only indication that...of course,\nI knew war is not a good thing, but what shook me at that time was...were the worried\nglances exchanged between the adults. We were all gathering in the social hall of that\nlovely hotel and then one of them -- men, the Jewish friends -- in a group exclaimed,\n\"Oh my God. What is going to happen with us now.\"\nAnd that shook me because I always regarded that man as a rock of strength and a power\nalways cheerful and, and witty and he indeed looked distress and sort of, as though he\nsuddenly got diminished in size in front of my eyes. My father was also very worried,\nbut he didn't say much. And then we went back, of course, to our home. Life continued\nnormally, but for the first time, not only newspapers, but the radios started carrying very\nopenly antisemitic statements. Some of them even attributed to officials. For example, I\nremember on the way to school at newsstands reading the bold, in bold face, headlines\nspeaking of the international conspiracy of Jews and many other things which I didn't\neven understand at the time but I had to go back home and ask my father for the meaning\nof those words. But the impressions are -- they are engraved in my memory of the name\nJews and all the other epitaphs and adjectives that came with it. That was the Autumn of\n\u201839. Apart from this, the beginnings of an anti-Jewish campaign in the press I don't recall\nanything worse happening. Of course with the press and officials openly castigating the\nJews, a lot of other people, who until that time we thought were friends, especially in my\ncase, other children Christian children that lived up and down our street \u2014 started using\nthe word chifut more and more often. And by -- in early 1940, I remember, and that\nparticular Christian boy was -- I considered him a close friend because he would come\nand play in our front yard almost every day. So he started really teasing me and\nharassing me but -- and even getting very, very offensive -- telling me all that he had\nobviously heard at home about the Jews this or that. And I remember myself, a normally\nwell behaved boy actually retorting with a curse, \"I wish you were dead.\" Now I mention\n' Religious instruction (Bulgarian)\n* Kike (Bulgarian)\nthis because a few months later, this boy got a sunstroke and died, and I felt such\ntremendous guilt that I sneaked at his funeral and watched a little bit the church services\npreceding the actual burial in secret, in a sort of childish attempt at atonement that what I\nfelt was probably a death that I had brought about my intemperate reaction to his teasing.\nBut these are all very, very strong things for a 10 or 11 year old to experience. I guess I\nwas 10 at the time. So that was 1940, things like that were happening. The anti-Jewish\ncampaign, as I say, was growing.",
        "Q: How were your parents reacting to all this? What was it like in Poland?",
        "A: Yeh. At home, of course the main topic of conversation was the War, how it was going,\ntremendous concern about the failure of the anti-Axis forces, especially the fall of\nFrance, and the fall of most of the Western Europe. Daily bulletins and consultations\nbetween my father and his friends. They didn't conduct normal conversations about war.\nThey always would pull out a actual map of Europe and would move little pins on the\nmap to see what had been lost to the Germans and so on. Growing concern. A lot of talk\nabout what had happened already to Jews in Germany and what was probably\nhappening. In 1940, of course. there was no information about that at all reaching us. At\nthat time, we still were...were still allowed to own radios so we can listen to the BBC\nand to other radio stations including the Voice of America, clandestinely of course.\nBulgaria had not joined officially the Axis yet. This occurred toward the end of 1940,\nbut this were the kind of conversations at home. The thing that stands out in my mind is\nthat younger members -- younger relatives would -- who belonged to Zionist\norganizations -- would speak about Palestine and immigration to Palestine being the only\nsalvation for Bulgarian Jews. And my father, the well accepted, well adjusted not\nassimilated in the religious sense, but culturally assimilated Jew would always oppose\nthat. Even at that time. As late as 1940, he could not imagine any circumstances under\nwhich it would be better to leave native and familiar Bulgaria for life in a murky, little\nknown, uncharted territory in a British colony in the Middle East. So, I vividly\nremember those altercations with my younger -- well, younger relatives, male relatives,\nwith my father always coming out against Zionist. He, of course, lived to eat his words\nand ended up in Israel as probably I'll talk about this later, at the end of War Two and\nwith the establishment of the State of Israel.",
        "Q: Go back to that room and pins on the maps.",
        "A: Yeh. The pins on the maps. Nineteen forty-one, of course, Hitler finally, in spite of his\npact with the Soviet Union, non-aggression pact orders the invasion of the Soviet Union,\nthe Operation Barbarasa, if I recall. That was frightening for us for a number of reasons.\nThat brought about the Bulgaria\u2019s official joining of the Axis, and by March of 1941, if I\nam not wrong. Yes, yeh, I remember it exactly, and I'll explain in a moment. Bulgaria by\nsigning the pact also agreed to allowing passage of German troops to Bulgarian territory.\nAs a matter of fact, March 25, '41, the day my Grandmother died and that was the day of\nher funeral, coincided with the arrival of German troops in Bulgaria. Why do I\nremember? Because just opposite our front courtyard, there was the one and only\nMercedes Benz dealership in town, and the first German troops that arrived started using\nthat garage, that dealership, as a short of small local headquarters. And a lot of these\nyoung, blond eyed and basically rather likeable young men were coming and using the\nfountain in our front yard to wash in the morning and so on. And so the Germans were\nthere! Next door to us. Now this did not happen exactly on the 25th. This came later. But\nwhat happened on March 25th we had a very impressive funeral procession for my\ngrandmother. My father, being quite prominent in the Jewish community and very active\nin the Jewish orphanage of Sofia, the children of the orphanage would march first, then\nall the active Rabbis, four of them if I am not mistaken, would march after them, and\nthen, of course, the coffin and the long procession of relatives and friends after that.\nThrough the streets of Sofia, on foot, all the way from our house in downtown Sofia, to\nthe Jewish cemetery which was a good 3 miles away. Now at one point, just as our\nprocession proceeds down one of the main streets of Sofia, a detachment of German\nsoldiers comes from the opposite direction. And this is my recollection of myself\nsuddenly freezing in my tracks and...and looking at both processions, and registering that\nwhile the ours veered a little bit to the side in order for the Germans to pass, none on\nboth...no one on either side looked at each other's eyes. They just passed along side each\nother totally ignoring the existence of each other. And that is my recollection. That was\nMarch of '45.",
        "Q: \u201841.",
        "A: Forty-one -- Sorry! Forty-one. And a major thing happened in January of '41. Yes. By\nthe end of 1940, under German pressure the Bulgarian Government decided that anti-\nJewish laws modeled on the Nuremberg laws would have to be promulgated. This was a\nvery firm demand on the Germans that neither the, by now, Fascist government of\nBogdan Filov nor the King\u201d were prepared to oppose. They felt that this is the least they\ncan do to accommodate the Germans. So they, they had appointed by that time a so\ncalled Commissar of Jewish Affairs of one of the most virulent antisemites in Bulgaria, a\nmember of the right-wing antisemitic group, Ratnitsi*, Aleksandur Belev, who was sent\nto Nuremberg to study the German legislation and bring back a Bulgarian version. Well,\nhe did, and by the end of 1940, that legislation, after debates and some quite vocal\nopposition in parliament, was adopted, signed by the King in early January, and its\nenforcement began in January of 1941. And now, why do I remember all this? Because\nsuddenly -- and that preceded the death of my grandmother. She was very ill. But apart\nfrom our concern over her health, the other two major concerns that were discussed\nevery opportunity at home were, especially for Father, how to come up with a large sum\nof ready cash in order to pay our assessment under the so-called \u201cunique tax\u201d that was\n* King Boris III of Bulgaria\n* Ratnitsi Napreduka na Bulgarshtinata [Champions of the Bulgarian Advancement] (Bulgarian)\nimposed as a first step toward ultimate confiscation of Jewish property and \u201cb\u201d how to\nfind documentary proof of his service some 25 years earlier as a military prosecutor with\nthe Bulgarian Armed Forces -- a service that under the law could exempt him from some\nof the restrictions, especially the restriction on professionals to practice their profession.\nIf I may jump into a little bit further into the future, he ultimately was able to prove that\nand for a while he enjoyed that privilege of continuing to work and not wearing the\nnormal star -- the yellow Star of David, but a yellow little pin which indicated that he\nwas a Jew, but a privileged Jew. So, back to \u201841.",
        "Q: What else was happening in your household. It's January '41. You hear these arguments.\nWhat else is going on?",
        "A: Well then the death of my grandmother, of course. The Germans already being in\nBulgarian the unease -- especially of our family -- of having to confront German soldiers\ndaily from early morning. That side by side with an ever growing anti-Jewish campaign\nin the Press, already with anti-Jewish legislation in force. We were already marked as\nenemies of the people, as exploiters. We weren\u2019t wearing yet the yellow Star of David,\nbut we were easy prey for anyone. Now the other stipulations of the law, which applied\nto Jews not being able to possess radios, telephones, began to be implemented. After the\nfirst payments of the unique tax, then Jews had to dispose of property. They were\nallowed for the time being to keep an apartment or some other dwelling for their own\nuse, but even that became questionable by the Autumn of 1941, when a new regulation\nwas published that Jews were not allowed to live in the general areas of the Capital but\nhad to live either in or very close to the Jewish quarter of Yuch Bunar. Well, we ended\nup by October in the house sharing the apartment of relatives in a place very near to the\nJewish quarter, but not inside of it. But prior to that, we had to undergo another\ndislocation. In our own house, which was a three story building, we occupied the second\nfloor, which was the best designed, and we had lived in it for many, many years. But as I\nsaid with the Jews being easy prey for anything, a Bulgarian lawyer married to a German\nwoman had cast his eye on our apartment and he wanted it. Through his contacts with\nthe Fascist authorities, we were given the order to vacate it in less than a week. We\nmoved downstairs into the apartment that was used before as an office. And what stands\nout in my mind 1s that they -- the Bulgarian lawyer and his German wife moved in, they\nconducted a sort of cleansing, religious ceremony with holy water and everything, but\nexpressly done in order to cleanse the Jewish spirit out of the apartment. And we were\neven asked to be present at that time. Now I don't remember this myself, but I remember\nthe mortification of my parents when that ceremony was over, to that extent. And we\nwere supposed to continue living in the same house! From this point of view, it was\nlucky that we were forced to move into the Jewish ghetto where the Bulgarian\nauthorities felt that we should be concentrated. Little did we realize at the time that this\nwas the first stage in a plan to eventually expel us from the city of Sofia, and as the\noriginal plans were, to ship us away to Poland.",
        "Q: You are now in this bottom apartment? What was going on? Your father, you told me,\nwas involved in the Jewish community? Did that have any impact on this situation?",
        "A: Not very directly. Well, of course, he continued his work with the orphanage primarily.\nAnd, as a lawyer, who was also accredited to the religious -- Jewish religious courts\nbecause he could appear in personal status cases, divorces and so on, so he continued.\nWell, he was being consulted very often by the, by the very active members of the\nConsistory, to -- what to do to alleviate the plight of some Jews from this stipulation of\nthe law or another. And this is what the Bulgarian Jews did very well. They pulled their\nresources of friends among the Bulgarian community, especially lawyers, doctors,\nintellectuals, writers, and so on, in order to -- here and there -- help each other obtain an\nexemption or alleviate some other case. So to that extent he was very he was very active\nbecause he had contacts especially among the Judirical circles of Bulgaria. Some people\ndid not turn their back on the Jews immediately. But here I have to -- if I may want to\ntell you of a little incident that occurred that showed me that not all former friends were\nready to maintain the friendship and not turn their back. And this may have been\nnaturally earlier in 1940. I know because I was 10 years old with another 10 year old\nJewish friend. We went to wait for a girlfriend of ours who lived opposite the Soviet\nEmbassy -- and of course, Bulgaria never cut off its diplomatic relations with the Soviet\nUnion in spite of German pressure -- and she was a little delayed, so we went -- waited\ndownstairs. There was, what we thought, a cab station of taxi cabs. My friend was the\nmischievous type. He started playing with the tires of some of the cars. Of course, I was\nnot. I was too well behaved to even think of that. But he did 1t. And suddenly, what\nagain we thought were the cab drivers, two of them rushed after him, trying to catch him.\nA third one came to me and he immediately pulled out a police badge and said, \"Well,\nwe are from the Secret Police and you are going to lead us to where your friend 1s.\" I\nwas stupefied, I didn\u2019t know what was happening. Playing a little joke like that, yeh, it's\nbad enough. But why would the police suddenly -- and people who were cab drivers?\nWell, we ended up, both of us, in the \u2014 in what they called, well the headquarters of the\nSecret, Secret police, the Bulgarian equivalent of perhaps the KGB. And you can\nimagine trying to investigate two 10 years old which involved writing depositions slowly\nin our calligraphic style.\nFinally, my father was brought in, and I'll never forget. Apparently the chief investigator\nknew my father very well from appearances in courts, he himself having -- being a\nlawyer, the investigator. He never turned to face my father. He was looking all the time\nat the window. And he gave him a lecture in my presence, which is the first time that I\nhad ever seen anybody talk down to my father. For me, my father was the one who\nwould talk down to anyone else, including myself. Suddenly, I see my father, as\nelegantly dressed as ever, but almost like shrinking inside, and I think I mentioned this\nbefore, but this is what happened in the vision of a 10 year old where all these strong\nmen suddenly under the pressure of humiliation and degradation, shrink in size in your\neyes. Because they, they cannot do much to defend themselves and, and then you -- for a\nmoment, you start to lose a little bit even your previous respect for them. But there was\nmy father silently listening to this sermon about the way the Jewish families raise their\nchildren in an anti-Bulgarian, anti-nationalist, anti-governmental spirit. My father who\nhad been the epitome of good citizenship throughout his life -- a Jew who insisted we\nspeak -- that without any trace of Ladino or other Jewish accent -- the Bulgarian\nlanguage because he spoke it that way. He had to listen to this petty functionary who\ndidn't have even the guts of turning and walk -- and looking him in the eye, for half an\nhour. Finally, the verdict was 500 leva which quite a bit of money at that time, almost\n500 dollar fine, and the warning that should I be caught doing such subversive things in\nthe future, the consequences will be much, much harsher. Now what was the whole thing\nabout? What did it turn out to be? Those so called taxi cabs were actually Secret Service\npeople in disguise stationed at a reasonable, but still very convenient distance from the\nSoviet Embassy, and with orders to be ready every time a car pulls out from the Soviet\nEmbassy to follow it. So the assumption was that we had been sent by someone to\nsabotage the Secret Police's attempts to monitor the movements of the Soviets in the\nCapital.\nBut by the time of our release, I'm sure that even that antisemitic investigator was\nconvinced that there was no plot here and no conspiracy, just the act of a foolish boy,\nand watched and not prevented by another small foolish boy. So, I took you back to\n1940, but to go back to the end of 1941. As I mentioned by October of that year, we had\nrelocated for a second time and began living in the ghettoized area of Sofia. Another\nalmost traumatic experience of the time was the fact that the Bulgarians, being under\nconstant German pressure to make the life of Jews more and more miserable in order to\nprepare Bulgarian public opinion for an eventual deportation of Jews, the Bulgarian\ngovernment brought to trial a Jewish industrialist, the only one who was allowed to\ncontinue working under the anti-Jewish legislation, as a manager of his expropriated\nplant, a textile plant, was suddenly brought to court on the charges of economic crimes.\nThey were trumped up charges. My father, who had been his lawyer for many, many\nyears, began defending him in this case. Well, for all those who -- for all Jews who were\nwatching the trial and knew about what an economic crime charge meant and what it\nwould bring, it was obvious that the man will not -- his life will not be spared. But my\nfather invested all of his Judirical talent in the hope that maybe through effective -- an\neffective defense, he could save him. Well, he did not. And not only that he was\nsentenced to death, but my father was -- I mean the client was sentenced to death, but my\nfather was forced to observe the actual execution to hang him. And I will never forget\nthis man and his face when he came back from that execution that afternoon. I had never\nseen him more devastated. Totally devastated and blaming himself for not having done\nenough when everybody knew that it was -- this was just a show trial. The Bulgarians\nhad to have something to show both the Germans and also the general populace that the\nJews were economic exploiters and criminals who, in spite of all the legislation against\nthem, were still prone to commit crimes. So that was end of 1940 -- 1941.",
        "Q: What was life like for you at that point in the Jewish camp?",
        "A: Did I say \u201841?",
        "Q: The end of 1941.",
        "A: Yeh. No, Iam sorry. All this happened toward the end of 1940 -- 1942. Yeh, 1942.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: All the events of the trial and also the relocation occurred in 1942. Life while we still\nwere not -- we were not restricted in our movements.... We could go out. Yeh, we could\ngo out, there were no prohibited streets. I think toward the very end, in the beginning of\n1943, some night curfews were imposed on Jews. Imposed in the sense that we were not\nsupposed to be outside on the streets after nine o'clock. But some Jews did not fully\ncomply with that and because the wearing of yellow Stars of David was not fully\nenforced yet, some of them could get away with breaking the curfew. But by early 1943,\nevery Jew from the age of 10 up, including myself, had to wear the yellow Star of David.\nMy father wore for awhile just the yellow pin. By that time he was still practicing, but in\na very, very limited manner. Our lives were mainly revolved around the synagogue, the\ncentral synagogue of Sofia, to which we went more often than ever before. And, of\ncourse, there was another synagogue in the proper Israel -- Jewish quarter proper, the\nYuch Bunar, but we mainly went to the central synagogue. Friends and family would\ngather and that was our life. Of course, living in much -- in cramped quarters, sharing --\ntwo or three families sharing one apartment. Luckily we had a room and a half so that I\nhad at least a separate place to sleep than my parents. It was bearable. Strangely enough\nfrom a childish viewpoint all of these things had also a funny and, and exciting aspect\nabout them. It was never boring. One had to adjust to new situations. Some of them were\nvery, very joyful because people were thrown together more with family and with\nfriends. And when people tried to alleviate their plight, you know, they become very\nresourceful and there was always entertainment of some kind. This continued even\nduring the darker years of the expulsion and the resettlement outside of Sofia. Some of\nthese aspects.",
        "Q: What about food? Did you have any trouble getting food at this point?",
        "A: No, again. No, not at this point. Most Jews of Sofia were middle class Jews. Of course,\nthe Jews of Yuch Bunar were less educated and more impoverished. But nobody at this\npoint starved yet. The people, in spite of all the, the taxation and the expropriation, and\nbeing prohibited from working and holding jobs, people still could survive on savings\nand on loans from family and so on. Incidentally, as early as the summer of 1941 and\nthrough 1942 and through most of '43, Jewish men from the age of 18 through, I think 38\nor 40, were all called up for service in what at the beginning were labor brigades within\nthe framework of the Army and Corps of Engineers in Bulgaria and later under the\nMinistry for Public Works. This was, in effect, forced labor. These were forced labor\ncamps so which they were not paid anything. They were away from their families. And\nwhen the time for the expulsion of Soviet Jewry arrived, many families did not have\ntheir males with them in order to help organize the quick departure and everything. I\ntouch on that in a letter that I wrote in June of 1943 from the northern city of Pleven to a\ncousin of mine who, because he was so much older, I called \u201cUncle\u201d \u2014 addressed as\n\u201cUncle.\u201d And he was one of those Jewish males who had been away for almost two\nyears serving in labor camps and away from his own family when they had to leave\nSofia, so in a way my letter describes to him the day when we saw his own family off at\na time when he was not around. But that was when we were expelled ultimately to\nPleven. Since we are touching on that, why don't I go into the quickly developing events\nof the Spring of 1943.\nBy May 19th, suddenly through the grapevine -- because we no longer had access to\nradios, but some people did listen clandestinely at the homes of Bulgarian friends, but\nmainly from newspapers, which of course we could still obtain -- the news came that\nRadio Berlin had announced that the Bulgarian government was planning the deportation\nof all Bulgarian Jews from the old boundaries of Bulgaria to Poland. Immediate panic\nand chaos! Although we didn't really -- we had no firm news about the fate of the Jews\nin Poland or those Jews who were being deported to Poland, but the feeling was that\nnothing good was happening there. So tremendous fear and panic! Some Jewish families\nwithin two days started getting the first orders for so-called resettlement in the\nprovinces. The orders gave them between three to five days to get ready to leave Sofia.\nBy the evening or night of May 22nd, 23rd, and this is another thing that I describe in\nthe letter I mentioned, the news become bad. Jewish leaders in their attempts to get firm\nnews from the authorities from the court, from -- were unable to reach anyone.\nObviously, even the King had left the city at that time, in spite of the fact that this was\nthe eve of a major Bulgarian holiday May 24th, Saint Cyril and Methodius, which is the\nday of education, the day of Bulgarian culture, with the King usually present at the\nparades that take place in the city. But he was no where to be reached. Finally, some\nJewish leaders managed to get hold of the head of the Bulgarian Orthodox church --\nArchbishop Stefan\u201d, known for his pro-Allied sympathies in spite of the fact that he was\nat the head of the Bulgarian church at the time when Bulgaria was already allied with the\nAxis. And he immediately started calling people -- top people in the government -- and\npersonally went even to the King\u2019s palace. He was unable to talk to the King but he left a\nstrongly worded note there warning the King, that God will not be merciful if he signs\nthe death warrant of the Jews by expelling them, the assumption being expulsion first\nfrom Sofia to other outlying areas close to the Danube for eventual shipment to Poland.\nWhether this worked or not, the fact is that none of the expulsion orders were rescinded\nbut the original plans developed by that Commissar for Jewish Affairs under German\npressure and with an explicit agreement with the German Ambassador to Sofia, of which\nwe learned later, the plans were to -- the expulsion to be only the first phase of a two\nphase process -- the second being shipment to Poland for extermination. Well, the\nsecond phase was never carried out, which explains the facts that all of us Bulgarian\nJews who numbered about 48,000 at the time of these events, survived with a few\nexceptions of Jewish partisans and others who took part in the resistance against the\nFascist regime.",
        "Q: Let's go back. You are about to be deported to Pleven. Tell me what happens to you\nthen?",
        "A: Well, those were horrible days, especially the night of May 22nd, 23rd which remains\nengraved in my memory as the most horrible night that we went through when we, we\nknew that we're going to be sent to Poland. That was the conviction at the time, that this\nis what it meant. We didn't sleep at all. The four of us, my little sister, mother and father,\nhugging each other and crying, at one point my father saying that, well the need may\narise for my mother and him to leave the two of us, my sister and I, in the care of others\nin order to save us. We, in turn, started crying and saying that, no way, we were not\ngoing to part with them no matter what happens. The morning finally mercifully put an\nend to that night, but with even worse news that more Jews had received eviction --\nexpulsion notices. And stories from our own members of our family who lived in the\nJewish quarters that people are running to the Jewish Community Council asking for\nhelp. The Jewish functionaries being even more confused than the poor people\nthemselves, being totally of no help. Finally, a lot of Jews congregating in the central\nsynagogue where the Chief Rabbi tries to sooth them and assure them that everything\npossible by way of protest and intercession will be done. The Jews dispersing that\nevening feeling a little more encouraged, but still very, very worried. The following day,\nthe holiday that I mentioned, May the 24th, Jews again congregate in, or try to\ncongregate in -- at the central synagogue, but they find it locked because some of the\nJewish leadership decided that it will be too dangerous to allow a large crowd to\nassemble because the Fascist authorities immediately will try to disperse it by force.\n> Metropolitan Stefan of Sofia\nBesides the feeling was that with the pent up emotions and fear and panic, a\ndemonstration may occur, which again will end in bloodshed. Some of the leadership or\nmost of the leadership was in favor of trying to enlist the help of sympathetic Bulgarians\nand the Church and the courts rather than engage in demonstrations and clashes with the\npolice. In spite of all that, in the Jewish quarter proper, a group of 200 and more Jews\ndid organize themselves and started a demonstration which was put down with\ntremendous cruelty by the Bulgarian police and agents of that Commissariat for Jewish\nAffairs. As my cousin, who is exactly my age told me at the time -- and he went --\nrecently when we met after so many years. He was watching the whole thing from the\nbalcony of their house and the Bulgarian authorities had brought the machine guns. Of\ncourse, guns and every conceivable weapons against totally unarmed, but young and\nstrong Bulgarian young -- Jewish young men. There was a scuffle. Some of the\npolicemen were hurt simply by the physical strength of some of these guys, but\neventually everybody was rounded up, beaten, and some of them even ended up being\nsent to the only concentration camp that was established in Bulgaria -- a real Nazi-style\nconcentration camp. It's not far from the city to which we were eventually banished,\nPleven. The name of the place of Somovit. Later, Jewish leaders, especially those who\nwere very active in the protest action and enlisting help of sympathetic Bulgarians, were\nrounded up, arrested, and banished to that same place. When I say \u201cNazi-style,\u201d of\ncourse, I mean the day-to-day treatment, but they all survived. No one was killed. Other\nJews, who had been apprehended as partisans fighting with the Communists or other\nanti-Fascists resistance ended up in special concentration camps for partisans which\nwere harsher. They were not sent to the same one, Jewish concentration camp.\nSo this is --we are speaking about May 24, 1943 -- the demonstration in the Jewish\nquarter crushed the attempts of Jewish leaders to cancel the orders of expulsion failed,\nbut at least intervention of the Church and other members of the intelligentsia seemed to\nhave convinced the King to rescind the order for the further -- for phase number two,\nnamely the shipment to Poland. That is very important to note because if that was not --\nif that ultimate shipment was not postponed, we would have ended up like all the other\n6,000,000 Jews in the gas chambers. By postponing it, even for a few months it made a\nwhole difference because in the meantime events like the Battle of Stalingrad and the\nAllied landings 1n Italy -- in one word, the beginning of Germany's defeat had already\nbecome a process which was watched carefully by the Bulgarian authorities, by the\nKing. Historical experience had taught them that in 19-- in World War One, as Allies\nagain of the German lead entente, they were losers, dismembered in terms of territory\nand so on. So the beginning of caution and a little of putting a little bit of distance\nbetween Bulgaria and the Germans had begun, at least in the minds of the King and\nsome other leaders. From -- which in turn mean that it would be most foolish at that\npoint, with Germany obviously losing the War, to hand them over the Jews and thus be\nbranded as a collaborator of Germany and a very humanitarian issue, while by saving the\nJews, Bulgaria could score some points in a future peace conference and get more\nlenient treatment. That was the thinking as, of course, we learned after the War from\nmany, many writings on the subject both from ex-officials and others on the outside.\nEventual shipment to Poland was cancelled as a plan, but our expulsion from Sofia took\nplace. Our own family had to leave three or four days after May 24th, we landed in\nPleven, which we had asked for as a matter of fact.",
        "Q: Back up a moment. Before we get there, I would like to know about that journey.",
        "A: Yeh. Well, the journey itself was rather pleasant, you know, packing and, of course,\ndisposing of most of our stuff either by selling it or passing it on to Bulgarian friends for\nsafekeeping was a very painful process, especially when my mother was ill at the time\nand in hospital, so my father and I virtually had to, had to do the whole packing. But\nagain, I, as a child, for me these were tremendous responsibilities and the very fact that I\nwas able to, to be of some constructive help gave me tremendous satisfaction. We were\nready by the day mentioned in our expulsion orders. My mother, luckily, had fully\nrecovered, and we all went to the train station. And again, here, friendships and, and the\nfact that most Bulgarians, especially urban Bulgarians, had no history of virulent or deep\nseated antisemitism. Little acts of help and assistance and moral support were not\nuncommon. In our particular case we were met at, at the train station by a Bulgarian\nfriend in a high position with the Bulgarian railroads who quietly led us to a\ncompartment, almost a first class compartment. The rest of our brethren had to travel\nthird class, but again, there were no, no cattle cars which our other brothers were carried\nin to their deaths. No, it was a regular Bulgarian train, and we were given a very nice\ncompartment. The men helped us quieted the whole time, but before bidding goodbye\nand a very curt goodbye, we saw that his eyes were filled with tears. He was afraid to\nspeak openly in order not to be seen being so kind to the enemies of the people as we\nwere being to be at the time. But he wanted to say silently and through his tears that\nthere are Bulgarians who feel that this is a tremendous and crazy injustice being done to\nus. It was a very moving moment at that time. The trip itself was very pleasant. Of\ncourse, for two children like my sister and I, we looked at the June sunny sky and it was\nfun.",
        "Q: At that point, let us stop please. I want to change -- we have to change tapes and then\nwe'll pick it up.",
        "A: Yeh.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: Would you tell us what happened when the train arrived at Pleven?",
        "A: We were met at the train station by the sister of -- well by the sister of the husband -- my\naunt's husband. They were originally from Pleven and that's why we actually pushed to\nget sent to Pleven because we had some family there on, on my aunt's side -- her\nhusband's side. So these nice people were there waiting for us, as they had probably done\nit for many other friends and acquaintances from Sofia. They took us directly to their\nown house. A small house, but on three floors, already filled with other expellees from\nSofia. And they gave us their own bedroom and they moved to the attic in order to\naccommodate us. It was unbelievable. After all the shocking and enervating events of the\ndays prior to our departure from Sofia, spending two days in the warm and cheerful\nhospitality of Mrs. Visa and her husband -- that was her name -- was very, very\nrecuperative. By that time the old house where I would call him Uncle Isaac, the\nhusband of my aunt was born and raised, his native city of Pleven and which was\noccupied by another sister of his again became partly available for us. I must mention\nthat my Uncle Isaac and my Aunt Lisa and her two children also came with us on the\nsame, on the same train to Pleven. So whatever -- what living arrangements were made,\nthey were all made for the two families. Of course, with us always being given a little bit\nof priority because we were the guests so to speak and they were returning home in a\nway. Well, eight of us were accommodated in one truly large room with nice access to\nthe back yard. These are one story houses in Pleven, very rustic, but we had a roof over\nour heads and at the beginning, you know, we were treated as guests, always having\nfood prepared by those who already were living there, in the Pleven branch of the\nfamily.\nSo the first few weeks were, weeks of adjustment to a totally new -- to a totally new\nreality. But strangely enough, we arrived -- solace and even enjoyment -- when\ndiscovering that what we had thought originally that was going to be even worse did not\nmaterialize. So for example, we would compare notes with other cities about which we\nwere getting information about restriction on Jews. If we had, let's say only four hours of\ncurfew a day, as opposed to -- as compared to other cities where the Jews were not\nallowed in the streets at all, for a while at least, which did not happen, or if we had more\nparks available and open to us while other cities did not allow their Jews to go to parks.\nWe derived pleasure from such little comparisons as to what can we get away with. And\nindeed after awhile the local authorities in Pleven saw in that influx of Jews from Sofia\nbasically a tourist bonanza of sorts. Well some of us, regardless of the fact that we were\nnot allowed to hold jobs and not own officially property, but some of us had money that\nwas either given to Bulgarian friends and then smuggled monthly back to us, but some\nmoney was brought to each of these outlying areas by the more prosperous Jews. Now,\nthe majority were not in that situation. The majority had to be quartered with other\nJewish families and this was supervised by the Commissariat of Jewish, of Jewish\nAffairs very strictly -- sometimes cramming three or four families in a very, very small\nthree room house. But no one was left without a roof over their heads. There was no\nneed, and I am speaking of Pleven but I think the same happened in the other cities to\nwhich Sofia Jews were banished. There were no large concentration style camps or\nbarracks established for Jews.\nThey were all quartered with other Jews, other local Jews. Now, while housing was\ntaken care of unsatisfactorily -- but still was taken care of this way of course -- the\nquestion of food was not. Many, many Jews didn't have the financial resources to buy\nfood. So again, Jewish organization began to, to occur. The already existing Pleven\nConstitory of Jews was expanded with members among the new arrivals from Sofia, my\nfather included. These people quickly organized soup kitchens to ensure that those Jews\nwho could not afford to buy their own food will have two hot meals daily. The money\ncame primarily from those Jews who, who had some money, and some money was\nprovided by the Commissariat for Jewish Affairs, the very, very bare minimum of\ncourse. Other resources must have been coming from somewhere, but I really have no\nrecollection. I clearly remember the, the long lines twice a day of the Jews waiting to get\ntheir soup. All this happened -- would occur in the Jewish school of Pleven where --\nwhich was the center of all Jewish activities from soup kitchen to lectures to concerts\nthat we organized. Even a Jewish school was organized there. Although we were not\nprohibited from attending Bulgarian high schools -- and I, in fact, began my first class of\nhigh school in Pleven wearing my Star of David -- but yes, Children up to the age of 13\ncould not attend public schools for some reason. I don't know why. I remember it\nbecause I used to take my little sister to the Jewish school in the morning and pick her up\nat noon. So she could go only to the Jewish school in the same place that I described a\nmoment ago where everything else took place, including a school. But surprisingly\neverything functioned superbly.\nBoth the school, the soup kitchen, all the cultural activities that were organized with a lot\nof talent, of course, being present among the Jews there to keep up the spirits of that\ncommunity. And to that extent I am very proud of my father for being one of those who,\nwho helped organize all this, and in that comes a story. Now, of course, they were all\nunder the watchful eye of the antisemitic Commissariat for Jewish Affairs, but apart\nfrom being personally liable for any infractions of the law, they were in no way to be\ncompared to some of the Judenrats\u00ae in, in Eastern Europe during the War. Of course,\n\u00b0 Jewish council (German); term used for Jewish administrative boards appointed by the Nazis to\ntheir circumstances were much more horrible with the Germans being actually there.\nAnd a matter of life and death -- I'm not sarcastic here -- making any judgments, but the\nJewish Consistories in these Bulgarian cities were totally different from the Judenrats.\nSo these are my impressions of Jewish life there and, and they are not unpleasant\nimpressions obviously. I was not one of those who had to wait for soup on the -- I might\nhave felt totally differently. But there was a lot of togetherness. Many Jews became\nmore Jewish during that time. Many Jews became exposed to Zionism for the first time.\nThere were lectures on Zionism. Many Jews started studying Hebrew for the first time.\nSo there was a Jewish reorientation, per force perhaps, but nevertheless a positive\nphenomenon. There were, of course, the outside world. How did the outside world treat\nus. After all, we were there. We had curfew hours, mainly the evening at night. our\nmovements were not that restricted even in the beginning, because it was felt that it\nwould be good for the local economy to allow Jews to go to the movies whenever they\nwanted or to the few places that had some, some sweets or -- remember this is the war\nwith rationing and everything, so many, many foods were absent. As I said, I was\nattending school. In my case I was the only Jew in class.\nAnd again, a little episode here which I think is worth mentioning. The non-Jewish\nmembers of the class, of course, treated me very badly -- mainly verbal abuse.\nOccasionally on the outside, in the street young members of the...of the youth Fascist\norganization Branik who really resembled very much in their uniform, the Brown, the\nBrown shirts in the Hitlerjugend\u2019 in Germany. I knew in advance that if -- when I saw a\ncouple of them that I will be beaten up. So I used to brace myself for that. I would pass\nby. They will slap me in the face, or do something else. I knew that I shouldn't do a\nthing. You know the Nazi, to provoke them further because there was no telling what\nwill happen and just proceed, go on my way. This happened at least once a week to me\non the way to school or back. But in school proper, the amazing thing was that the\nteachers would very often stand up in my defense or would give lectures to, especially a\nteacher of German -- of the German language -- which I was forced to learn at the time.\nAnd when she heard some remarks in class and or saw them pushing me in the corridor,\nfinally one day, she started speaking about Heine*. And she pointed out, \u201cBut do you\nknow that Heine was Jewish.\u201d She turned to the class, \u201c\u201cAnd what does that mean? That a\nperson can be a Jew and can be a good German, a great German poet and writer, just as\nwe have Jews in our country who are poets and writers and mathematicians\u201d -- because\nof a major, prominent mathematician was among the Jews expelled from Sofia and\nliving in Pleven at the time, and he was well known. So I will never forget this kind of\nsupport from this woman who was basically educated in the German language and had\ntraveled extensively to Germany, but remained totally uncontaminated by Nazis on the\noversee Jewish communities and ghettos.\n\u2019 Hitler youth (German); Nazi youth organization.\n* Christian Johann Heinrich Heine\ncrazy hatred of Jews. On the contrary, she stood up. She even exempted me from giving\nthe Fascist salute. Here I should back up and say that every, every class in different\nsubjects -- be it Latin, or Bulgarian language and literature, or German language and\nliterature -- would start with the people's jumping to salute when the Heil Hitler sign or\nthe Bulgarian equivalent of it. Be it in Latin \u201cPro Regia in Patria Parati Summus,\u201d \u201cFor\nthe King and country, we're ready to die.\u201d The same thing in German, and the same thing\nin Bulgarian. Well, she allowed me to remain seated when she would enter the class and\nthe rest would have to give the Fascist greeting to her in German. Yeh, so this was still\n1943. Yeh, 1943. By that time, not only the attitude of individuals like this teacher, but it\nbegan to be obvious that even the authorities had embarked slowly and tacitly without\nany announcement on a sort of benign neglect policy vis a vis the Jews. In other words,\nall the anti-Jewish legislation had to be carried out, but without the same fierce --\nwithout the fierceness that characterized that implementation at the beginning.\nAnd this again was due to the fact that Germany was losing the War. The Soviet Army\nwas advancing rapidly across its own territory. I do not remember whether it was early\n1944 or end of 1943 that. the Russians had virtually expelled all Germans from their\nterritory and were now advancing across Europe. No, it must have been early 1944. But\nanyway -- oh, the major event which I have to come back to in 1943 the sudden death of\nKing Boris, the King of Bulgaria mysteriously -- mysterious death following by two\ndays his return from a meeting with Hitler at Berchtesgaden at Hitler's request. The King\nat that time must have been in his early 40s. We all knew him as a very athletic man, a\nhunter, a man who exercised and hiked a lot. The official story was that he had died of a\n-- from thrombosis, from heart ailment. Nobody believed that at the time, but we didn't\nknow any better. Only after the War did we learn that at that fateful meeting in\nBerchtesgaden, Hitler had asked him very firmly for two things: to finally hand over the\nJews, and to finally send an expedition in force to fight the Soviets on the Eastern Front.\nThe King rejected both demands off hand at that time. It would have been suicidal for\nhim to agree to such acts at the time when Hitler was already losing the War and he\nmaintained diplomatic relations with, with the Soviet Union until the very last moment.\nIn fact, it was the Soviets who after even the establishment of the very pro-Allied\ngovernment in Bulgaria by September fifth of 1944, they declared war on Bulgaria for\npolitical reasons. But to go back to the death of the king, that was a tremendous event.\nObviously, we, the Jews did not know how to feel because we weren't sure how helpful\nhe had been to us. He obviously had acquiesced with a lot of the persecutions against us,\nbut still a King is a King and we were watching with the rest of Bulgaria the news reels\nof his, of his funeral which was really very dramatic with hundreds of thousands of\n\u201d For King of our country we are always ready (Latin)\npeople lining the routes of the funeral procession in Sofia and so on. After his death, his\nson, who was still a minor, was proclaimed King, but he had to rule with the help of a\ncouncil of regents made of three people. One of them was the Mr. Filov who, until that\ntime, was Prime Minister of Bulgaria and was responsible for most of the antisemitic\nactions of Bulgaria during that time. The fact that he became a regent and someone else,\nagain from the Fascist party, came to power at least explains the benign neglect towards\nthe Jews, the -- that occurred towards the end of 1943. They were preoccupied with other\nthings and besides, the new Prime Minister, although a Fascist, was not such an\nideological fanatic as Mr. Filov who and the other Minister Gabrovski'\u00b0, Minister of\nInternal Affairs.",
        "Q: Bring this back. How did this affect you and your family?",
        "A: You mean that period of the--",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Of the benign neglect?",
        "Q: Yeh.",
        "A: Well, life was getting more hopeful. It was obvious that even the Commissariat for\nJewish Affairs did not, did not bother so much about, about supervising every little detail\nof the -- of life in the Jewish Community of Pleven and my father being one -- a member\nof the Consistory, that was a relief because they didn't have to be called up and lectured\nor abused verbally about the little local commissars. Conversations at home or when\nvisiting friends and relatives, of course, would continue to be conducted on -- with little\nmaps about the War. How we got our information? Apart from newspapers, it was very\ndifficult, but some Jews managed to smuggle \u2014 no, to smuggle themselves into the\nhouses of Bulgarian friends and listen secretly to the BBC and the Voice of America and\nthen, of course, pass it on to the rest of us. So we were informed about the, the progress\nof Allied advances all over Europe.\nAnd becoming more and more hopeful that if nothing had happened until then, it was\nobvious that we, we may not be sent to Poland. That fear was lurking all the time. So the\nprayers were, \u201cLet the Allies arrive as quickly as possible and liberate us.\" Now we did\nnot know that last minute death marches occurred in Hungary and anything -- a lot of\nsimilar things could have happened to us. But you know, when you want to believe, you\nbelieve that you may be saved somehow. And things continued improving in winter and\nspring of \u201944. It was felt slowly that Bulgaria was trying to disengage its -- to put more\n\u2019\u00b0 Petur Gabrovski\nand more distance between itself and the Axis. Not by any terribly dramatic overt\nactions, but simply by, by doing less of, let's say, antisemitic propaganda in the papers.\nNot rescinding any of the existing laws or regulations, but not introducing new ones.\nAnd by end of May of \u201844, a new government under I think the name is Bagrianov''\ncame to power. Mr. Bagrianov made a speech at the beginning which sounded very, very\nencouraging more by what he omitted to say against the Allies or in favor of Germany\nthan by what he said. He organized his government. We began feeling that some of the\nrestrictions were quietly lifted against us, but minor restrictions, like restrictions on\nmovement. For example, the night curfew by that time was quietly dropped -- at least in\nPleven, that's what I can speak about.\nBy August -- and I remember the date because it was the date of the speech, the speech\nof Mr. Bagrianov for the radio about which we knew somehow in advance. We must\nhave gotten the word through a Western Radio station that he will make a major speech.\nAnd in that speech he openly started speaking against Germany, about the desire of his\ngovernment to leave the Axis, about his desire to meet Allied terms, reasonable terms for\npeace, and about the abolition, the abolition in the new future of all anti-Jewish\nlegislation. And, indeed, by August 30th of the, of the same year, all anti-Jewish laws\nwere rescinded. That was nine or 10 days before the Soviet Army entered Bulgaria.\nFeelers to the Allies for a separate peace were sent out. They didn't work. In the\nmeantime, the Soviet Army was advancing. Several governments were toppled and came\nto power. The most recent -- on September second -- of Muraviev\u2019\u2019, a very pro-Western,\nliberal person, who openly declared war on Germany, but did not get any peace offer\nfrom anyone else. So, for a few days Bulgaria was at war with all the countries in the\nworld, both with the Allies and with the, with the Axis. Then the Red Army marched\ninto Bulgaria unopposed on September ninth. This coincided with partisans of\nBulgarians and among them Jews coming down from the mountains and taking over\npower in the major cities. I was there when this occurred. I was outside. I don't know\nwhy I was on the street -- on the main street, actually, when the partisans came down\nfrom the mountains in Pleven, took positions with guns. By that time the Fascist police\nhad totally disappeared. And then some of them, I think, some of the Jewish partisans\nwho could spot the Jewish young boys like me -- I was 14 at the time -- will recruit us on\nthe spot to come with them while searching the homes of prominent Fascists, especially\nformer police chiefs and things like that.\nI was taken by one young partisans to help him go through the pockets of the just-\ndeposed Chief of Police of Pleven. It was quite an experience for me. I was shaking,\n'' Tyan Bagrianov\n'* Kosta Muraviev\nshaking more, more violently than the man himself who knew that he will be shot almost\nthe same day, and I think he was, by the partisans, summarily without any.... But you\ncouldn't blame them knowing what the local police had done against partisans, bombing\nentire houses with the people in them when they would get word that the partisans were\nhiding and this again, we eyewitnesses to that. So a personal experience was helping a\nyoung partisan while he was holding the gun pointed at the local Chief of Police and I\nwent through his pockets and searched him bodily, him and his wife and his young\ndaughter. Another impression deeply engraved from the same day when the partisans\ncame down -- I remember one Jewish partisan marching into the Consistory, and then at\ngun point marching out all the members of the entire leadership, including my father.\nNow, this partisan was a Communist who felt that the previous -- the Jewish leadership\nwho had helped the Jewry -- the local Jewry really survived the impact quite well, but\nthat they were not progressive enough for his taste. This very soon was taken care of\nbecause obviously this Jewish partisan was acting on his own, and not with the\nknowledge of the Fatherland Front which was the umbrella organization of all anti-\nFascist forces, with the Communist Party, of course, playing a very leading role in it. But\nit was a wide coalition at that time. And they had -- they were very well informed. They\ndid not consider any Bulgarian Jew as a collaborator of the Fascists. So this was taken --\nbut it was a very ugly thing for these people, finally on the day of liberation, rejoicing,\nhaving kept the spirit, to be marched out as criminals by an over zealous Jewish\nCommunist.",
        "Q: Were you there when that happened?",
        "A: Yes. I remember my father coming out. I was next to them because the home of the\nformer Chief of Police, whom I had helped search, and the Jewish school were very\nclose to each other so after having helped the one partisan in his job, I was already free\nto go, and went naturally to the Jewish school. And suddenly I see my father being,\nbeing marched out at gunpoint together with the five or six other members of the\nConsistory. But it lasted very briefly. Apparently, they were just taken to -- I don't know\n-- to a local headquarters of the partisans and within the hour, they were released with\napologies. This was -- but I was very shocked, and very, very deeply hurt, because I\nknew how we had all prayed for the partisans, for the liberators, for the Allies to come\nand here we are suddenly again the enemies of the liberators. That was really ridiculous.\nBut it was handled properly. That was September 9, 1944.",
        "Q: How did your family now react? What was happening to them?",
        "A: Well, with tremendous joy because obviously we were free again, free to return to Sofia.\nA little worried as to what a Soviet occupation of Bulgaria would mean. After all, we\nhad read that and seen movies about life in the Soviet Union prior to that. The news\nabout the agreements at Yalta became finally filtering to us and we began realizing that\nEurope had been sort of divided into spheres and that we unfortunately belonged to the\nsphere that would be under Soviet control. But again the joy of just being free again, of\nbeing alive, of having survived it all and of going home soon was tremendous. And\nindeed, within the week, we were already back in Sofia, back in our apartment. I have no\nrecollections as to how. Oh yes, the previous occupants as very involved with the with\nthe Fascist authorities had escaped, had escaped, and I think they had escaped by the\nwife pulling out a pistol on a domestic flight and forcing it into Turkey. Yes, that, that\nwas it. Yeh. So we found our apartment. We did not conduct any religious cleansing\nservices as they did. Maybe we should have, but we were happy to be back and, and with\nus came the family of my Aunt Lisa, and her two children, and we were only too glad to\ngive them one of the three apartments in the house. The third floor became theirs\nbecause their house had been demolished by an American incendiary bomb during --\nthere were two or three bombing attacks on Sofia by Allied planes. It was mainly\nAmerican and one of them was in February, I think, of \u201844.",
        "Q: Let's just stay where you are.",
        "A: So, yeh. So, we are back in Sofia, resuming our lives as best we could. I remember that I\nimmediately had to worry about my next school year. It was obviously past September\nfirst, when the school year would really start. But because of the chaos and the changing\ngovernments and everything we were getting extensions, but by October I enrolled in, in\none of the better Sofia public high schools.",
        "Q: Before you go in to the high school, take, take a few minutes. Tell me please the affect\nof the Soviet occupation. You were in Pleven first and then Sofia.",
        "A: Well, in Pleven, of course we, on the date when the Russian Army finally reached\nPleven, they had, of course, come to -- from Rumania and to the Danube, through the\nBlack Sea, but troops obviously entered every major Bulgarian city. We all went out to\ngreet them out of curiosity, but also in a fact they were our liberators. But at the back of\nmy mind, I remember -- for example, people, Jews -- Jewish people on the eve of the\narrival of Soviet troops in Pleven would urge each other, \"Well, take good care of your\njewelry and whatever little gold you have because, you know, you never know with the\nSoviets.\u201d And in deed, some of the -- now I have not personally seen that or experienced\nit, but many, many people were telling of the way Russian soldiers, once they arrived\nand would start marching down the streets or become traffic policemen or whatever,\nwould stop people and simply rip their watches off their hands. They were very, very\nhungry, if I can use that word, for the basic amenities of the West. Because, by their\nstandards, Bulgaria was the West at that time. Other excesses really I have not seen or\nobserved. They were behaving as a sort of benign occupation army. Because, after all,\nBulgaria did not offer any opposition. The old Bulgarian gratefulness to the Russian\npeople for their liberation from the Turks back in 1878 is a thread that really passes\nthrough Bulgarian history. No matter what happens, the Bulgarians will never be anti-\nRussian or even anti-Soviet in the sense that some other Eastern European countries can\nbe, because of that historical indebtedness that Bulgarians feel toward the Russians.\nThere were, were no excesses. But of course, one could feel the firm grip of the Soviet\noccupation forces in the sense of organizing the government. The Fatherland Front was\nset in place with Parliament what -- in which all of these anti-Fascist forces were\nrepresented. But what gradually started happening from \u201944 -- from the end of \u201844, \u201845\nwas a gradual reassertion of the Communist element of that coalition. The gradual and\nquiet disappearance of opposition leaders without any explanation. It transpired that they\nwere liquidated physically, one by one, gradually to the point that by 1947, when\nelections were held, the Communist Party had already solidified its control over the\nwhole government and the rest of the so-called coalition partners were really figure\nheads that didn't, didn't count for much. But that's -- this is already jumping ahead.",
        "Q: You are now. This is now \u201845 in the Fall, in October and you are going back to high\nschool?",
        "A: No, \u201944, October.",
        "Q: Forty-four, October. You are going back to high school. What happened to you? What\nwas your life like at this point?",
        "A: Yeh. Well, it was a very exciting time to be back at school because after so many years\nof suppression and oppression as a Jew, this time, we, the Jews -- the few Jewish pupils -\n- students in every class would feel that we are now in power. And at the beginning, we\nindeed felt that way. We could see how former Fascist or former members of those youth\norganizations that were there, and we knew how they behaved, cowered in our presence,\nwere afraid that we might denounce them or take some other revenge which we did not.\nBut it was very pleasant for awhile to feel on top of the world in this case. Some of us\nwith childish and or youthful enthusiasm and naivete began believing very sincerely in\nthe goals of the Fatherland from this wide coalition of forces opposed to such bad things\nlike Fascism and Imperialism, and so on. We were very quickly disabused from that\noriginal idealistic sympathy, because it was obvious who was running the show. After a\nwhile it was obvious that every, even the Fatherland Front meeting would ultimately\nbecome a session of typically Communist criticism of self criticism. And we had read\nenough by that time of Marx literature which was fed to us at school to know that these\nwere purely Communist ideological tools and were not typical of, let's say, the\nprogressive agrarians or some of the other smaller parties that were in the coalition. A\nstrange phenomenon also began. A new form of antisemitism based on the revulsion of\nsome even progressive Bulgarians, from some of the ideological and other excesses of\nJewish Communists. And with time, we began -- we Jews ourselves began to be quiet\nannoyed and in some cases, quite resentful of that attitude. Well, I will come to that in a\nfew years. My own experiences in one of those so-called volunteer labor brigades.",
        "Q: Well, let's move a little. Let's talk about -- you are in school. By \u201847, you had been in\nschool now for two years. What happened? Things begin to change?",
        "A: Well. Yeh. Actually by \u201847, I had been for three academic years in school and I\ngraduated because the new government had abolished the so-called eighth grade of high\nschool, which would be equivalent to the American -- well, the last grade of high school.\nSo I graduated very young at the age of 17, and, of course, had to think about my higher\neducation. Now this was already in 1947. The elections took place, supervised by the\nCommunists, and the Communist Party was returned by 99.9 percent. I leave it to\nhistorians to judge the voracity of those results, but those were the results. The\nCommunists were firmly in control which meant -- especially to us Jews who were so\nhungry for Western culture -- especially after the War having -- meaning from the free\nWest, American movies, American books, American magazines, British films and so on.\nFor a while, for two years, \u201844, \u201845, part of \u201846, we were allowed to watch such movies\nand to have access to foreign books. I remember being a member of the British Consul\nLibrary and the small reading room established by the Youth Information Agency in\nSofia. By \u201848, they had been abolished. But suddenly in *47, one could not see a single\nAmerican western movie 1n town or an important Western magazine. Nothing. That was\nvery bothersome to us because it was such an infringement of the newly acquired\nfreedom and a foretaste of things to come -- especially after the Communists had firmly\nestablished themselves in power. And then news from other Eastern European countries,\nfrom Czechoslovakia for example, the events, the death of Masaryk\u2019? and the overthrow\nof the last truly democratic government there. A close friend of mine was the son of the\nBulgarian Ambassador to Czechoslovakia during that time so I heard it firsthand as to\nwhat had happened. That was in 1947. I mention this because this fact plus the elections\nplus the events in the Middle East with the passage of the Partition Resolution of the\nUnited Nations in -- was it November of \u201947? All of these factors combined within the\nhearts and minds of Bulgarians Jews, and I felt, like anybody, else that the time to go has\narrived. Now, with the return of the Communist Party to power, the return of Jewish\nproperty, which had started in 1944, was stopped and new laws expropriating all\nproperty from all Bulgarian citizens, Jews and non-Jews alike, was taking place. So, we\nsaw that in several respects we were even worse off than under the Fascists, under a new\nCommunist legislation. So the feeling was, \u201cIf a State of Israel 1s proclaimed, we should\ngo as quickly as we can.\u201d\n'S Jan Masaryk\nAnd indeed, that's what happened. When the State of Israel was proclaimed in May of\n1948, Bulgarian Jews by that time had organized themselves in every conceivable type\nof Zionist organizations. The lists of potential immigrants were -- had already been\ndrawn up. So we were ready and the Bulgarian government received permission from the\nSoviet Union, just as the governments of other Eastern European countries, to allow\nevery Jew who wants to leave for Palestine to leave. I will not go into the rationale for\nthis, for this Soviet policy, but obviously it had some very pragmatic reasons behind it.\nNow -- but to go a little bit back again to \u201947, I became active again in Zionist\norganizations. I had decided that if I am given the chance to leave for Israel or for\nPalestine, I would leave. But in the meantime I had to think of the immediate future, and\nthat was higher education. To qualify for admission to Sofia University, or any other\nuniversity, unless you had very good Communist Party credentials, the only other thing\nthat might give you a chance to be considered for admission was to volunteer for service\nin one of the many labor brigades organized by the government when the young people\ngo to build roads or a little villages for children and so on. I participated in one such\nvillage which we toiled hard to build, but never came to pass, because it was just work\nfor work's sake. It was just to say that you are doing something. So I joined a brigade\nlike that and was unfortunate to have as my brigade commandant a Bulgarian Jewish\nCommunist. He made my life a misery, knowing that I am a Jew, and knowing that I am\nthe son of a prominent lawyer, a non-Communist, somebody who was active during the\nWar and so on. It was obvious that that class struggle mentality was there as though we,\nthe Jews were enemies of each other. No Bulgarian Jew had ever exploited any other\nBulgarian Jew in order to carry the class struggle to that point. But that was the\nideological predilection of these people. So he gave me hell during that time. I remember\nthat and I mention that for one reason: Later on by the time some of the Bulgarian\nJewish Communists fell in disfavor with the Bulgarian authorities, especially after the\nSix Day War in Palestine, this particular man immigrated to Palestine. And I saw him in\nthe street. I ignored him, but others who had suffered under different circumstances gave\nhim a sound beating there. If he is alive I wish him well in Israel.",
        "Q: Let us take it to the point now. We have 10 minutes left on this tape. I would like to take\nit to the immigration to Israel. You have brought us to that point.",
        "A: Yeh. So, the -- from the vote on the Petition of Palestine in the fall of 1947, Bulgarian\nJewry was freely aflame with Zionist fervor if I can say so. I will never forget the\nmanifestations. Yeh, the march through the streets of Sofia with, with lit candles. I am\ntrying to remember whether this was the night of the Partition Resolution or the date of\nthe Proclamation of the State. No, I think it was the Proclamation of the State. That was\nsomething unbelievable. In a country already openly ruled by the Communist Party, a\nspontaneous demonstration, which really the authorities -- although they were officially\nvery anti-Zionist, anti-Zionist with all the permission on the part of the Soviet Union for\nJews to immigrate into Israel, but the official policy was against Zionism because Stalin\ndid not believe in Zionism -- but the Bulgarian authorities allowed us to march in\nsupport of the new State of Israel and it was very touching. And you could see that all\nthese people who are not allowed, or whose little demonstration on May 24, 1943 was\ncrushed, were here marching freely in a Communist country in support of the newly born\nState of Israel. A memorable evening!",
        "A: Now already in, in late \u201847, a lot of Jews began immigrating to Palestine, taking the risk\nof being stopped by British ships and diverted to Cyprus. Even relatives of mine did that,\nand lived in -- on Cyprus for almost, what -- seven months until the establishment of the\nState of Israel, when the borders opened. So Bulgarian Jewish immigration began\nalready in \u201847. Primarily younger people but some young families as well. The mass\naliyah\u2019* -- the mass immigration, began really one day after the establishment of the\nState. Already on May 16, Bulgarian Jews were leaving. Of course, aliyah depended on\nthe transportation capabilities of the young State. Strangely enough within a few months,\ntwo major ships were already put at the disposal of Bulgarian Jews for immigration: The\nPan York, the Pan Crescent. I came on the -- to Israel on the Pan Crescent in December\nof 1948. Within a period of -- a period from let's say June of \u201848 through February,\nMarch of \u201849, all 48,000 or more of the surviving Bulgarian Jews -- obviously, they all\nsurvived World War Two -- immigrated to Palestine. A very small number of Jews,\neither Communists or very old people, people who did not feel that transplanting\nthemselves at that point in their lives would be advisable, stayed behind. And this in\nitself was amazing to see: an entire community which had lived for most of the time very\npeacefully and in prosperity almost 500 years among, in the Balkans, among Bulgarian\nSlavs, suddenly transplanting itself to the Middle East and starting a new life in the\nnewly re-born State of Israel.",
        "Q: What happened to you? What was your trip like? What was it like for you to arrive in\nIsrael?",
        "A: Yeh. Well, I together with a group of other boys, young Bulgarians, we registered\nknowing that we will be conscripted on arrival in Israel. We knew that we would join the\nyoung army and that was our desire. That was December of \u201848, the time of the so-called\nsecond truce in the fighting in the War of Liberation of 1948. Well, excitement! Not\nknowing to what we are going. I had never been very, very sportsman-like or anything\nlike that. I had no idea of how to hold a rifle, but I was prepared to go and so were some\nof my friends. On our way there, by this marvelous, newly-acquired ship, Pan Crescent,\nwhich left the Yugoslavia port of Bar and also took a great number of Hungarian Jews\n'* Immigration of Jews to Israel (Hebrew)\nwho had also come to Yugoslavia. Of course we reached Yugoslavia from both countries\nby train, a lengthy three day journey in tremendous cold. But once on the ship, it was\nlike a festival really of people who are free and are going to fight in a war. They don't\nknow what expects them, but it was fantastic. The spirits was very high. I, who had\nnever been really separated from my parents, I forgot all about my family and got carried\naway in this wave of enthusiasm. Of course, reality has a way of denting enthusiasm of\nevery kind. On arrival the prosaic reality of being picked up from the ship and sent to\ntransition military camp, which was horrendous, of course. Jews -- young Jews from all\nover the world without the common language arriving there. It was no fun, especially\nknowing that or not knowing exactly where they will send you and so on.",
        "Q: Could we hold it a minute. We need to change tapes.\nEnd Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: You have just arrived in this camp with Jews from all over the world. Tell me what that\nperiod was like.",
        "A: It was exhilarating in some aspects, but very worrying in others. The reason being\nprimarily that until we arrived there in this camp, I had not heard about the Gate. Of two\nother groups of young Bulgarian Jews who had arrived in Israel on previous ships, and\nwho apparently with a minimum of training, almost none, and with a minimum of arms\nhad been sent on a particular day, on the afternoon as I understand it, to Latrun in so-\ncalled triangle between -- halfway between the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, a very strategic\nplace of tremendous importance in the attempts of the young State to stop the onslaught\nof the five Arab armies that had invaded Israel. In this case, of course, the main threat\nwas the Egyptian Army, and I think the purpose was not to allow them to make -- to\nbreak through it \u2014 Latrun -- in order to converge with other invading Arab armies.\nReinforcements apparently were not available. Ben-Gurion\u2019\u2019, Prime Minister and\nCommander-in-Chief at the time had to make a very, very fateful decision of using these\nyoung Bulgarian new arrivals almost as gun fodder by sending them there and trying to\nuse them to just hold the fort until proper reinforcement would arrive. Well, they did\nheld the fort; Latrun was not lost. It was saved, but all of them lost their lives. Again, I\nmay be mistaken, but I think the number reached 600. Well, you can imagine to a 17\nyear old, when you are told all of this and obviously a fact that had happened several\nweeks prior to your own arrival in Israel, you really don't know what to do. You don't\nhave the benefit of your parents' counsel. You listen to what the other guys tell you. This\nguy was telling me, \"Well, if you don't want to end up this way, try to somehow join the\nAir Force.\" He had, somehow. And I will not go into the details of how I managed to get\ninto a force that was exclusively volunteer. There is a Hebrew word for that Mahal, a\nabbreviation for \u201cMitnadevei Hutz La\u2019 Aretz,'\u00b0\u201d \u201cVolunteers from Overseas.\u201d But Mahal\nmeant the people from English speaking or other affluent countries. All of us who came\nfrom Eastern Europe were known as the category of Gahal, \u201cGe\u2019us Hutz La\u2019 Aretz,'\u201d\n\u201cConscripted from Overseas.\u201d We were conscripted, they were volunteers. Well, some\nhow with the help of the little English that I knew at that time, I did join the Air Force. I\nwas privileged to be a member of the first course in the history of the Jewish people for\nradar technicians and I became one of Israel, Israel's Air Force's first radio technicians\nusing naval radar equipment for detecting planes. But that part of it was very exciting\nbeing amongst so many young Jews from all over the world. And especially getting to\nknow American and British and Australian English speaking young Jews, and see that:\nthe depth of their commitment, of their volunteerism, of their Zionist. I am bearing in\n'\u00b0 David Ben-Gurion\n'\u00ae Foreign volunteers (Hebrew)\n'\u2019 Foreign draftees (Hebrew)\nmind all the time that they came there out of choice. Most of us came from Bulgaria also\nout of deliberate Zionist choice, but we also at the back of my mind --of our minds, we\nhad the lack of future under the Communism. But these young, young people did have a\nchoice, and they still decided to come. So, it was very exciting. The beginnings of a\nculture if you wish, cross-fertilization with other, with other parts of the Jewish people.\nFor us -- especially Bulgarian Jews who had been raised in the European Sephardic\ntradition with a very small Ashkenazi minority -- that was the first really contact with\nJews that were different from us and we had to make a lot of cultural and emotional\nadjustments.",
        "Q: Would you encapsulate now at this point and tell us what happened to you and to the\nBulgarian community. Where did they settle?",
        "A: Yeh. The Bulgarian community arrived at the ttme when the formerly Arab town of\nJaffa, which is almost adjacent to Tel Aviv, because of the flight of its inhabitants at the\nheight of the fighting during the War of Liberation, was virtually empty. The abandoned\nArab property was put under the custodian of absentee property and was available for\nnew immigrants. So around the time that the Bulgarian aliyah immigration wave was at\nits height, Jaffa was almost empty and open for resettlement. And that is where I would\nsay the majority of the Bulgarian Jews, at least 20 to 25,000 settled at first. And pretty\nsoon, Jaffa became a Bulgarian city, with Bulgarian signs on shops with Bulgarian\ntranslation on movies and began to thrive. Very few Bulgarian Jews remained in the\nimmigration transition camps, Mahanot Olim'*, in Hebrew, where people from other\ncountries sometimes stayed for two, three years before they could find their own way out\nand had to rely on the Jewish agency or government assistance. Bulgarian Jews very\nquickly took care of themselves, primarily by settling in places like, like Jaffa or Lydda,\nanother Arab town, which population had fled the country or Ramla, another Arab town\nso these were newly created Bulgarian Jewish communities. Very enterprising and self-\nreliant with, with many craftsmen and artisans and people of free professions like\nlawyers, engineers and doctors among them. The Bulgarians did very well for\nthemselves, and after awhile began leaving those original areas, like Jaffa, Ramla and\nLydda, and settling in the more affluent areas of Tel Aviv or Jerusalem or Haifa.",
        "Q: When did you leave. What happened to you after the War?",
        "A: Well, my family arrived in February of \u201849. By that time I was already serving in the\nArmy. I had found them a place to live. My father, as I mentioned, had to make the very\npainful adjustment from being a prominent lawyer in his native language into -- and at\nthat time, he didn't even know whether he would be able to practice again -- so what he\ndid at first was just work anywhere, usually clerical jobs because he already knew some\n'S immigrant camps (Hebrew)\nHebrew. But he also applied himself very, very devotedly and strenuously to studying\nnot only the Hebrew language but taking the special courses that were devised for\nlawyers coming from overseas. He studied hard for three or four years and passed the\nBar Examination, the special Bar Examination again, and at the age of 65 began\npracticing again. So we settled in Tel Aviv. My mother had some money in Palestine\nfrom an inheritance from her father, who as I mentioned lived in Egypt and at that time\nhad the forethought of buying some property in Palestine which came in handy later. At\nfirst, I -- after completing my military service, I enrolled in the Haifa Technion, thinking\nas a majority of my friends did, that only a real trade will, will do in Israel and especially\nin my case, observing the tragedy of the readjustment of my father when you have a\nprofession that relies on the language. Well, I made the wrong choice. It was very\npragmatic, but I was not cut out for engineering. After two years, I dropped out, began\nwriting for the local Bulgarian -- for the Tel Aviv Bulgarian language daily, which was\nquite a necessary cultural and even absorption instrument for the Bulgarian, Bulgarian\nJewry during the time since their arrival for the necessary five or six years until they\ncultural integrated into the life of Israel.",
        "Q: You worked for them awhile. How long did you live in Israel before you came to the\nUnited States and why did you come?",
        "A: For 20 years, for 20 years. I lived there for 20 years. I graduated with a BA in political\nscience from the Tel Aviv branch of the Hebrew University, which now 1s the Tel Aviv\nUniversity in -- my degree was in journalism and diplomacy. I soon after graduating, I\njoined the staff of the U.S. Information Service at the American Embassy in Tel Aviv as\nan Israeli citizen, a local employee. Worked successfully for the U.S. Embassy for\nalmost nine years in the capacity of Assistant Press Officer and editor of both English\nand Hebrew publications. That, combined with my studies of political science and\ndiplomacy, developed in me the great desire to become a diplomat. And I started\nknocking on the doors of the Israel Foreign Ministry. Unfortunately -- at the time I hope\nthis practice has been abandoned -- the distribution of jobs of this foreign ministry was\nbased on the so-called \u201cparty key.\u201d Well, I did belong to the right party, Mapai'\u201d. But\nthat was the party of the majority and we Bulgarian Jews were not sufficiently a pressure\ngroup so as to justify giving me a job without attaining any particular or further any\nparticular political interest because it was like preaching to the converted. They had our\nsupport. Well, I stayed on with the American Embassy, but after a trip to this country as\nguest of the U.S. Government as some -- I think my well deserved training and\norientation after almost seven years of service with USIA\u201d\u2019 -- when I was given a chance\nto visit coast to coast for three months and, and fall in love with a country that I had been\nselling to my fellow Israelis for the years prior to that. I decided that, if given a chance, I\n Mifleget Po\u2019alei Eretz Israel [Labor Party of Israel] (Hebrew)\nUnited States Information Agency\nwould like to come here. Especially after having taken part in three wars and having a\nfive and a half year old son, whom I wanted, unlike me, to taste life especially in his\nformative years, in a country, where at least the country itself is not at war or is not the\npassage ground of occupying forces and things like that. Of course, the Vietnam War\nwas raging, but the United States itself -- the territorial United States was at peace, and I\nknew that by the time he grew up, that war at least would be taken care of.\nSo it was my own fatigue with living for survival\u2019s sake. War after war, adjustment after\nadjustment, politics determining my life. I was sick and tired of that, and this coupled\nwith my desire to allow my son to taste something different from what I had gone\nthrough, and the fact that I fell in love with this country when I visited it extensively in\nthe spring of \u201967. And when the chance presented itself that I was offered the position at\nthe Hoover Institution at Stanford*\u2019, I came to this country. But I was very honest with\nmyself. I did not come here just to study. I obtained release from the Army. As an\nimmigrant, I took immigrant visas for myself and for my former wife by using\nrespectively the Bulgarian and the Polish quotas, I left the country to which I had gone\nto participate in its War of Liberation somewhat discouraged, I must admit.\nDisillusionment, of course, but disillusioned was more my problem. It's when you raise\ntoo many unrealistic expectations about people or countries, you're bound to be\ndisillusioned if they don't live up in real life to that. But it was more my lack of faith or\nlack of ability to see down the road what would happen in that part of the world in terms\nof peace. And I thought that I owed it to myself before beginning the down slope ride in\nterms of age, at least a chance to see the world from a perspective of non-involvement, at\nleast immediate non-involvement, in such events as continuing warfare and living in a --\njust a struggle for mere survival. I wanted to give myself this chance. Of course, I could\nremain deeply interested in the State of Israel. My entire family lives there, sister, aunts,\ncousins and so on. I have a tremendous stake in the survival of that country. I would do\ngladly anything to further the cause of peace because I think that only through some\npolitical accommodation in peace will the future of that small and beloved country be\nassured.",

        "A: My name is Norbert Yasharoff.",
        "A: I was born in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria in 1930, to the family of a prominent,\nsuccessful Jewish lawyer by the of Yossif, or Joseph, Yasharoff and my mother, Nelly\nthe daughter of Bulgarian Jewish parents who lived in Egypt, Cairo, prior to World War\nOne. And then after the death of my grandfather, my grandmother and her three\ndaughters, including my mother, came back to Bulgaria.",
        "A: To the best of my recollection, the early childhood was a very pleasant one: a life of\ncomparative plenty, of wonderful vacations either in the mountains or the Black Sea in\nBulgaria, with fine clothes mostly bought by my father on his business trips to Paris and\nother Western European capitals, a peaceful life, a very family life. Our extended family\nwas quite large, and our house, especially while my grandparents was alive \u2014 on my\nfather\u2019s side \u2014 was the center of that life. So major Jewish holidays and any other festive\noccasions were festive, quite festive. We had a large house in downtown Sofia, not far\nfrom the Fire Brigade Headquarters -- which was a landmark at that time \u2014 with a huge\ncourtyard with a gazebo and wonderful trees and flowers. And memories from family\ngatherings either in the gazebo or just sitting in the courtyard in the early evening are\nreally etched in my memory. In sum, until almost the fall \u2014 autumn of 1939, all my\nrecollections are one of a pleasurable, warm and happy childhood.",
        "A: Yes, I have a sister. She was born in 1936. She lives in Israel today with her family.",
        "A: Yeah, that a \u2014 my first clash, so to speak, with the reality of being slightly different\nfrom the other children in the public school which I attended when, in the second grade,\nwe started having so called religion lessons, verouchenie' in Bulgarian \u201cstudy of the\nfaith,\u201d which I had to attend, or at least I thought that I had to attend. I was being teased\nby other children about the role or the Jews in killing Christ and so on \u2014 which first took\nme aback and then, of course, became very unpleasant until my parents arranged for me\nto be excused. And there was no problem \u2014 I was excused. But that was the only\nawareness of being different and being sort of set apart or being teased about it. Very\nrarely, the other children would use the Turkish word chifut*, which I understand it to\nmean \u201cinfidel,\u201d or somebody of another, inferior, faith. But that occurred very rarely\nuntil, as I say, the Autumn 1939, and the outbreak of World War Two. Incidentally, we\nwere vacationing in a wonderful hotel, in a spa resort in Bulgaria, Soludervent. And we\nwere \u2014 this was the eve of our return to Sofia at the end of the vacation, August 31st,\nwhen in the evening over the radio came the news of the outbreak of World War Two. I\nwas nine and a half years, my little sister was three. The only indication that...of course,\nI knew war is not a good thing, but what shook me at that time was...were the worried\nglances exchanged between the adults. We were all gathering in the social hall of that\nlovely hotel and then one of them -- men, the Jewish friends -- in a group exclaimed,\n\"Oh my God. What is going to happen with us now.\"\nAnd that shook me because I always regarded that man as a rock of strength and a power\nalways cheerful and, and witty and he indeed looked distress and sort of, as though he\nsuddenly got diminished in size in front of my eyes. My father was also very worried,\nbut he didn't say much. And then we went back, of course, to our home. Life continued\nnormally, but for the first time, not only newspapers, but the radios started carrying very\nopenly antisemitic statements. Some of them even attributed to officials. For example, I\nremember on the way to school at newsstands reading the bold, in bold face, headlines\nspeaking of the international conspiracy of Jews and many other things which I didn't\neven understand at the time but I had to go back home and ask my father for the meaning\nof those words. But the impressions are -- they are engraved in my memory of the name\nJews and all the other epitaphs and adjectives that came with it. That was the Autumn of\n\u201839. Apart from this, the beginnings of an anti-Jewish campaign in the press I don't recall\nanything worse happening. Of course with the press and officials openly castigating the\nJews, a lot of other people, who until that time we thought were friends, especially in my\ncase, other children Christian children that lived up and down our street \u2014 started using\nthe word chifut more and more often. And by -- in early 1940, I remember, and that\nparticular Christian boy was -- I considered him a close friend because he would come\nand play in our front yard almost every day. So he started really teasing me and\nharassing me but -- and even getting very, very offensive -- telling me all that he had\nobviously heard at home about the Jews this or that. And I remember myself, a normally\nwell behaved boy actually retorting with a curse, \"I wish you were dead.\" Now I mention\n' Religious instruction (Bulgarian)\n* Kike (Bulgarian)\nthis because a few months later, this boy got a sunstroke and died, and I felt such\ntremendous guilt that I sneaked at his funeral and watched a little bit the church services\npreceding the actual burial in secret, in a sort of childish attempt at atonement that what I\nfelt was probably a death that I had brought about my intemperate reaction to his teasing.\nBut these are all very, very strong things for a 10 or 11 year old to experience. I guess I\nwas 10 at the time. So that was 1940, things like that were happening. The anti-Jewish\ncampaign, as I say, was growing.",
        "A: Yeh. At home, of course the main topic of conversation was the War, how it was going,\ntremendous concern about the failure of the anti-Axis forces, especially the fall of\nFrance, and the fall of most of the Western Europe. Daily bulletins and consultations\nbetween my father and his friends. They didn't conduct normal conversations about war.\nThey always would pull out a actual map of Europe and would move little pins on the\nmap to see what had been lost to the Germans and so on. Growing concern. A lot of talk\nabout what had happened already to Jews in Germany and what was probably\nhappening. In 1940, of course. there was no information about that at all reaching us. At\nthat time, we still were...were still allowed to own radios so we can listen to the BBC\nand to other radio stations including the Voice of America, clandestinely of course.\nBulgaria had not joined officially the Axis yet. This occurred toward the end of 1940,\nbut this were the kind of conversations at home. The thing that stands out in my mind is\nthat younger members -- younger relatives would -- who belonged to Zionist\norganizations -- would speak about Palestine and immigration to Palestine being the only\nsalvation for Bulgarian Jews. And my father, the well accepted, well adjusted not\nassimilated in the religious sense, but culturally assimilated Jew would always oppose\nthat. Even at that time. As late as 1940, he could not imagine any circumstances under\nwhich it would be better to leave native and familiar Bulgaria for life in a murky, little\nknown, uncharted territory in a British colony in the Middle East. So, I vividly\nremember those altercations with my younger -- well, younger relatives, male relatives,\nwith my father always coming out against Zionist. He, of course, lived to eat his words\nand ended up in Israel as probably I'll talk about this later, at the end of War Two and\nwith the establishment of the State of Israel.",
        "A: Yeh. The pins on the maps. Nineteen forty-one, of course, Hitler finally, in spite of his\npact with the Soviet Union, non-aggression pact orders the invasion of the Soviet Union,\nthe Operation Barbarasa, if I recall. That was frightening for us for a number of reasons.\nThat brought about the Bulgaria\u2019s official joining of the Axis, and by March of 1941, if I\nam not wrong. Yes, yeh, I remember it exactly, and I'll explain in a moment. Bulgaria by\nsigning the pact also agreed to allowing passage of German troops to Bulgarian territory.\nAs a matter of fact, March 25, '41, the day my Grandmother died and that was the day of\nher funeral, coincided with the arrival of German troops in Bulgaria. Why do I\nremember? Because just opposite our front courtyard, there was the one and only\nMercedes Benz dealership in town, and the first German troops that arrived started using\nthat garage, that dealership, as a short of small local headquarters. And a lot of these\nyoung, blond eyed and basically rather likeable young men were coming and using the\nfountain in our front yard to wash in the morning and so on. And so the Germans were\nthere! Next door to us. Now this did not happen exactly on the 25th. This came later. But\nwhat happened on March 25th we had a very impressive funeral procession for my\ngrandmother. My father, being quite prominent in the Jewish community and very active\nin the Jewish orphanage of Sofia, the children of the orphanage would march first, then\nall the active Rabbis, four of them if I am not mistaken, would march after them, and\nthen, of course, the coffin and the long procession of relatives and friends after that.\nThrough the streets of Sofia, on foot, all the way from our house in downtown Sofia, to\nthe Jewish cemetery which was a good 3 miles away. Now at one point, just as our\nprocession proceeds down one of the main streets of Sofia, a detachment of German\nsoldiers comes from the opposite direction. And this is my recollection of myself\nsuddenly freezing in my tracks and...and looking at both processions, and registering that\nwhile the ours veered a little bit to the side in order for the Germans to pass, none on\nboth...no one on either side looked at each other's eyes. They just passed along side each\nother totally ignoring the existence of each other. And that is my recollection. That was\nMarch of '45.",
        "A: Forty-one -- Sorry! Forty-one. And a major thing happened in January of '41. Yes. By\nthe end of 1940, under German pressure the Bulgarian Government decided that anti-\nJewish laws modeled on the Nuremberg laws would have to be promulgated. This was a\nvery firm demand on the Germans that neither the, by now, Fascist government of\nBogdan Filov nor the King\u201d were prepared to oppose. They felt that this is the least they\ncan do to accommodate the Germans. So they, they had appointed by that time a so\ncalled Commissar of Jewish Affairs of one of the most virulent antisemites in Bulgaria, a\nmember of the right-wing antisemitic group, Ratnitsi*, Aleksandur Belev, who was sent\nto Nuremberg to study the German legislation and bring back a Bulgarian version. Well,\nhe did, and by the end of 1940, that legislation, after debates and some quite vocal\nopposition in parliament, was adopted, signed by the King in early January, and its\nenforcement began in January of 1941. And now, why do I remember all this? Because\nsuddenly -- and that preceded the death of my grandmother. She was very ill. But apart\nfrom our concern over her health, the other two major concerns that were discussed\nevery opportunity at home were, especially for Father, how to come up with a large sum\nof ready cash in order to pay our assessment under the so-called \u201cunique tax\u201d that was\n* King Boris III of Bulgaria\n* Ratnitsi Napreduka na Bulgarshtinata [Champions of the Bulgarian Advancement] (Bulgarian)\nimposed as a first step toward ultimate confiscation of Jewish property and \u201cb\u201d how to\nfind documentary proof of his service some 25 years earlier as a military prosecutor with\nthe Bulgarian Armed Forces -- a service that under the law could exempt him from some\nof the restrictions, especially the restriction on professionals to practice their profession.\nIf I may jump into a little bit further into the future, he ultimately was able to prove that\nand for a while he enjoyed that privilege of continuing to work and not wearing the\nnormal star -- the yellow Star of David, but a yellow little pin which indicated that he\nwas a Jew, but a privileged Jew. So, back to \u201841.",
        "A: Well then the death of my grandmother, of course. The Germans already being in\nBulgarian the unease -- especially of our family -- of having to confront German soldiers\ndaily from early morning. That side by side with an ever growing anti-Jewish campaign\nin the Press, already with anti-Jewish legislation in force. We were already marked as\nenemies of the people, as exploiters. We weren\u2019t wearing yet the yellow Star of David,\nbut we were easy prey for anyone. Now the other stipulations of the law, which applied\nto Jews not being able to possess radios, telephones, began to be implemented. After the\nfirst payments of the unique tax, then Jews had to dispose of property. They were\nallowed for the time being to keep an apartment or some other dwelling for their own\nuse, but even that became questionable by the Autumn of 1941, when a new regulation\nwas published that Jews were not allowed to live in the general areas of the Capital but\nhad to live either in or very close to the Jewish quarter of Yuch Bunar. Well, we ended\nup by October in the house sharing the apartment of relatives in a place very near to the\nJewish quarter, but not inside of it. But prior to that, we had to undergo another\ndislocation. In our own house, which was a three story building, we occupied the second\nfloor, which was the best designed, and we had lived in it for many, many years. But as I\nsaid with the Jews being easy prey for anything, a Bulgarian lawyer married to a German\nwoman had cast his eye on our apartment and he wanted it. Through his contacts with\nthe Fascist authorities, we were given the order to vacate it in less than a week. We\nmoved downstairs into the apartment that was used before as an office. And what stands\nout in my mind 1s that they -- the Bulgarian lawyer and his German wife moved in, they\nconducted a sort of cleansing, religious ceremony with holy water and everything, but\nexpressly done in order to cleanse the Jewish spirit out of the apartment. And we were\neven asked to be present at that time. Now I don't remember this myself, but I remember\nthe mortification of my parents when that ceremony was over, to that extent. And we\nwere supposed to continue living in the same house! From this point of view, it was\nlucky that we were forced to move into the Jewish ghetto where the Bulgarian\nauthorities felt that we should be concentrated. Little did we realize at the time that this\nwas the first stage in a plan to eventually expel us from the city of Sofia, and as the\noriginal plans were, to ship us away to Poland.",
        "A: Not very directly. Well, of course, he continued his work with the orphanage primarily.\nAnd, as a lawyer, who was also accredited to the religious -- Jewish religious courts\nbecause he could appear in personal status cases, divorces and so on, so he continued.\nWell, he was being consulted very often by the, by the very active members of the\nConsistory, to -- what to do to alleviate the plight of some Jews from this stipulation of\nthe law or another. And this is what the Bulgarian Jews did very well. They pulled their\nresources of friends among the Bulgarian community, especially lawyers, doctors,\nintellectuals, writers, and so on, in order to -- here and there -- help each other obtain an\nexemption or alleviate some other case. So to that extent he was very he was very active\nbecause he had contacts especially among the Judirical circles of Bulgaria. Some people\ndid not turn their back on the Jews immediately. But here I have to -- if I may want to\ntell you of a little incident that occurred that showed me that not all former friends were\nready to maintain the friendship and not turn their back. And this may have been\nnaturally earlier in 1940. I know because I was 10 years old with another 10 year old\nJewish friend. We went to wait for a girlfriend of ours who lived opposite the Soviet\nEmbassy -- and of course, Bulgaria never cut off its diplomatic relations with the Soviet\nUnion in spite of German pressure -- and she was a little delayed, so we went -- waited\ndownstairs. There was, what we thought, a cab station of taxi cabs. My friend was the\nmischievous type. He started playing with the tires of some of the cars. Of course, I was\nnot. I was too well behaved to even think of that. But he did 1t. And suddenly, what\nagain we thought were the cab drivers, two of them rushed after him, trying to catch him.\nA third one came to me and he immediately pulled out a police badge and said, \"Well,\nwe are from the Secret Police and you are going to lead us to where your friend 1s.\" I\nwas stupefied, I didn\u2019t know what was happening. Playing a little joke like that, yeh, it's\nbad enough. But why would the police suddenly -- and people who were cab drivers?\nWell, we ended up, both of us, in the \u2014 in what they called, well the headquarters of the\nSecret, Secret police, the Bulgarian equivalent of perhaps the KGB. And you can\nimagine trying to investigate two 10 years old which involved writing depositions slowly\nin our calligraphic style.\nFinally, my father was brought in, and I'll never forget. Apparently the chief investigator\nknew my father very well from appearances in courts, he himself having -- being a\nlawyer, the investigator. He never turned to face my father. He was looking all the time\nat the window. And he gave him a lecture in my presence, which is the first time that I\nhad ever seen anybody talk down to my father. For me, my father was the one who\nwould talk down to anyone else, including myself. Suddenly, I see my father, as\nelegantly dressed as ever, but almost like shrinking inside, and I think I mentioned this\nbefore, but this is what happened in the vision of a 10 year old where all these strong\nmen suddenly under the pressure of humiliation and degradation, shrink in size in your\neyes. Because they, they cannot do much to defend themselves and, and then you -- for a\nmoment, you start to lose a little bit even your previous respect for them. But there was\nmy father silently listening to this sermon about the way the Jewish families raise their\nchildren in an anti-Bulgarian, anti-nationalist, anti-governmental spirit. My father who\nhad been the epitome of good citizenship throughout his life -- a Jew who insisted we\nspeak -- that without any trace of Ladino or other Jewish accent -- the Bulgarian\nlanguage because he spoke it that way. He had to listen to this petty functionary who\ndidn't have even the guts of turning and walk -- and looking him in the eye, for half an\nhour. Finally, the verdict was 500 leva which quite a bit of money at that time, almost\n500 dollar fine, and the warning that should I be caught doing such subversive things in\nthe future, the consequences will be much, much harsher. Now what was the whole thing\nabout? What did it turn out to be? Those so called taxi cabs were actually Secret Service\npeople in disguise stationed at a reasonable, but still very convenient distance from the\nSoviet Embassy, and with orders to be ready every time a car pulls out from the Soviet\nEmbassy to follow it. So the assumption was that we had been sent by someone to\nsabotage the Secret Police's attempts to monitor the movements of the Soviets in the\nCapital.\nBut by the time of our release, I'm sure that even that antisemitic investigator was\nconvinced that there was no plot here and no conspiracy, just the act of a foolish boy,\nand watched and not prevented by another small foolish boy. So, I took you back to\n1940, but to go back to the end of 1941. As I mentioned by October of that year, we had\nrelocated for a second time and began living in the ghettoized area of Sofia. Another\nalmost traumatic experience of the time was the fact that the Bulgarians, being under\nconstant German pressure to make the life of Jews more and more miserable in order to\nprepare Bulgarian public opinion for an eventual deportation of Jews, the Bulgarian\ngovernment brought to trial a Jewish industrialist, the only one who was allowed to\ncontinue working under the anti-Jewish legislation, as a manager of his expropriated\nplant, a textile plant, was suddenly brought to court on the charges of economic crimes.\nThey were trumped up charges. My father, who had been his lawyer for many, many\nyears, began defending him in this case. Well, for all those who -- for all Jews who were\nwatching the trial and knew about what an economic crime charge meant and what it\nwould bring, it was obvious that the man will not -- his life will not be spared. But my\nfather invested all of his Judirical talent in the hope that maybe through effective -- an\neffective defense, he could save him. Well, he did not. And not only that he was\nsentenced to death, but my father was -- I mean the client was sentenced to death, but my\nfather was forced to observe the actual execution to hang him. And I will never forget\nthis man and his face when he came back from that execution that afternoon. I had never\nseen him more devastated. Totally devastated and blaming himself for not having done\nenough when everybody knew that it was -- this was just a show trial. The Bulgarians\nhad to have something to show both the Germans and also the general populace that the\nJews were economic exploiters and criminals who, in spite of all the legislation against\nthem, were still prone to commit crimes. So that was end of 1940 -- 1941.",
        "A: Did I say \u201841?",
        "A: Yeh. No, Iam sorry. All this happened toward the end of 1940 -- 1942. Yeh, 1942.",
        "A: All the events of the trial and also the relocation occurred in 1942. Life while we still\nwere not -- we were not restricted in our movements.... We could go out. Yeh, we could\ngo out, there were no prohibited streets. I think toward the very end, in the beginning of\n1943, some night curfews were imposed on Jews. Imposed in the sense that we were not\nsupposed to be outside on the streets after nine o'clock. But some Jews did not fully\ncomply with that and because the wearing of yellow Stars of David was not fully\nenforced yet, some of them could get away with breaking the curfew. But by early 1943,\nevery Jew from the age of 10 up, including myself, had to wear the yellow Star of David.\nMy father wore for awhile just the yellow pin. By that time he was still practicing, but in\na very, very limited manner. Our lives were mainly revolved around the synagogue, the\ncentral synagogue of Sofia, to which we went more often than ever before. And, of\ncourse, there was another synagogue in the proper Israel -- Jewish quarter proper, the\nYuch Bunar, but we mainly went to the central synagogue. Friends and family would\ngather and that was our life. Of course, living in much -- in cramped quarters, sharing --\ntwo or three families sharing one apartment. Luckily we had a room and a half so that I\nhad at least a separate place to sleep than my parents. It was bearable. Strangely enough\nfrom a childish viewpoint all of these things had also a funny and, and exciting aspect\nabout them. It was never boring. One had to adjust to new situations. Some of them were\nvery, very joyful because people were thrown together more with family and with\nfriends. And when people tried to alleviate their plight, you know, they become very\nresourceful and there was always entertainment of some kind. This continued even\nduring the darker years of the expulsion and the resettlement outside of Sofia. Some of\nthese aspects.",
        "A: No, again. No, not at this point. Most Jews of Sofia were middle class Jews. Of course,\nthe Jews of Yuch Bunar were less educated and more impoverished. But nobody at this\npoint starved yet. The people, in spite of all the, the taxation and the expropriation, and\nbeing prohibited from working and holding jobs, people still could survive on savings\nand on loans from family and so on. Incidentally, as early as the summer of 1941 and\nthrough 1942 and through most of '43, Jewish men from the age of 18 through, I think 38\nor 40, were all called up for service in what at the beginning were labor brigades within\nthe framework of the Army and Corps of Engineers in Bulgaria and later under the\nMinistry for Public Works. This was, in effect, forced labor. These were forced labor\ncamps so which they were not paid anything. They were away from their families. And\nwhen the time for the expulsion of Soviet Jewry arrived, many families did not have\ntheir males with them in order to help organize the quick departure and everything. I\ntouch on that in a letter that I wrote in June of 1943 from the northern city of Pleven to a\ncousin of mine who, because he was so much older, I called \u201cUncle\u201d \u2014 addressed as\n\u201cUncle.\u201d And he was one of those Jewish males who had been away for almost two\nyears serving in labor camps and away from his own family when they had to leave\nSofia, so in a way my letter describes to him the day when we saw his own family off at\na time when he was not around. But that was when we were expelled ultimately to\nPleven. Since we are touching on that, why don't I go into the quickly developing events\nof the Spring of 1943.\nBy May 19th, suddenly through the grapevine -- because we no longer had access to\nradios, but some people did listen clandestinely at the homes of Bulgarian friends, but\nmainly from newspapers, which of course we could still obtain -- the news came that\nRadio Berlin had announced that the Bulgarian government was planning the deportation\nof all Bulgarian Jews from the old boundaries of Bulgaria to Poland. Immediate panic\nand chaos! Although we didn't really -- we had no firm news about the fate of the Jews\nin Poland or those Jews who were being deported to Poland, but the feeling was that\nnothing good was happening there. So tremendous fear and panic! Some Jewish families\nwithin two days started getting the first orders for so-called resettlement in the\nprovinces. The orders gave them between three to five days to get ready to leave Sofia.\nBy the evening or night of May 22nd, 23rd, and this is another thing that I describe in\nthe letter I mentioned, the news become bad. Jewish leaders in their attempts to get firm\nnews from the authorities from the court, from -- were unable to reach anyone.\nObviously, even the King had left the city at that time, in spite of the fact that this was\nthe eve of a major Bulgarian holiday May 24th, Saint Cyril and Methodius, which is the\nday of education, the day of Bulgarian culture, with the King usually present at the\nparades that take place in the city. But he was no where to be reached. Finally, some\nJewish leaders managed to get hold of the head of the Bulgarian Orthodox church --\nArchbishop Stefan\u201d, known for his pro-Allied sympathies in spite of the fact that he was\nat the head of the Bulgarian church at the time when Bulgaria was already allied with the\nAxis. And he immediately started calling people -- top people in the government -- and\npersonally went even to the King\u2019s palace. He was unable to talk to the King but he left a\nstrongly worded note there warning the King, that God will not be merciful if he signs\nthe death warrant of the Jews by expelling them, the assumption being expulsion first\nfrom Sofia to other outlying areas close to the Danube for eventual shipment to Poland.\nWhether this worked or not, the fact is that none of the expulsion orders were rescinded\nbut the original plans developed by that Commissar for Jewish Affairs under German\npressure and with an explicit agreement with the German Ambassador to Sofia, of which\nwe learned later, the plans were to -- the expulsion to be only the first phase of a two\nphase process -- the second being shipment to Poland for extermination. Well, the\nsecond phase was never carried out, which explains the facts that all of us Bulgarian\nJews who numbered about 48,000 at the time of these events, survived with a few\nexceptions of Jewish partisans and others who took part in the resistance against the\nFascist regime.",
        "A: Well, those were horrible days, especially the night of May 22nd, 23rd which remains\nengraved in my memory as the most horrible night that we went through when we, we\nknew that we're going to be sent to Poland. That was the conviction at the time, that this\nis what it meant. We didn't sleep at all. The four of us, my little sister, mother and father,\nhugging each other and crying, at one point my father saying that, well the need may\narise for my mother and him to leave the two of us, my sister and I, in the care of others\nin order to save us. We, in turn, started crying and saying that, no way, we were not\ngoing to part with them no matter what happens. The morning finally mercifully put an\nend to that night, but with even worse news that more Jews had received eviction --\nexpulsion notices. And stories from our own members of our family who lived in the\nJewish quarters that people are running to the Jewish Community Council asking for\nhelp. The Jewish functionaries being even more confused than the poor people\nthemselves, being totally of no help. Finally, a lot of Jews congregating in the central\nsynagogue where the Chief Rabbi tries to sooth them and assure them that everything\npossible by way of protest and intercession will be done. The Jews dispersing that\nevening feeling a little more encouraged, but still very, very worried. The following day,\nthe holiday that I mentioned, May the 24th, Jews again congregate in, or try to\ncongregate in -- at the central synagogue, but they find it locked because some of the\nJewish leadership decided that it will be too dangerous to allow a large crowd to\nassemble because the Fascist authorities immediately will try to disperse it by force.\n> Metropolitan Stefan of Sofia\nBesides the feeling was that with the pent up emotions and fear and panic, a\ndemonstration may occur, which again will end in bloodshed. Some of the leadership or\nmost of the leadership was in favor of trying to enlist the help of sympathetic Bulgarians\nand the Church and the courts rather than engage in demonstrations and clashes with the\npolice. In spite of all that, in the Jewish quarter proper, a group of 200 and more Jews\ndid organize themselves and started a demonstration which was put down with\ntremendous cruelty by the Bulgarian police and agents of that Commissariat for Jewish\nAffairs. As my cousin, who is exactly my age told me at the time -- and he went --\nrecently when we met after so many years. He was watching the whole thing from the\nbalcony of their house and the Bulgarian authorities had brought the machine guns. Of\ncourse, guns and every conceivable weapons against totally unarmed, but young and\nstrong Bulgarian young -- Jewish young men. There was a scuffle. Some of the\npolicemen were hurt simply by the physical strength of some of these guys, but\neventually everybody was rounded up, beaten, and some of them even ended up being\nsent to the only concentration camp that was established in Bulgaria -- a real Nazi-style\nconcentration camp. It's not far from the city to which we were eventually banished,\nPleven. The name of the place of Somovit. Later, Jewish leaders, especially those who\nwere very active in the protest action and enlisting help of sympathetic Bulgarians, were\nrounded up, arrested, and banished to that same place. When I say \u201cNazi-style,\u201d of\ncourse, I mean the day-to-day treatment, but they all survived. No one was killed. Other\nJews, who had been apprehended as partisans fighting with the Communists or other\nanti-Fascists resistance ended up in special concentration camps for partisans which\nwere harsher. They were not sent to the same one, Jewish concentration camp.\nSo this is --we are speaking about May 24, 1943 -- the demonstration in the Jewish\nquarter crushed the attempts of Jewish leaders to cancel the orders of expulsion failed,\nbut at least intervention of the Church and other members of the intelligentsia seemed to\nhave convinced the King to rescind the order for the further -- for phase number two,\nnamely the shipment to Poland. That is very important to note because if that was not --\nif that ultimate shipment was not postponed, we would have ended up like all the other\n6,000,000 Jews in the gas chambers. By postponing it, even for a few months it made a\nwhole difference because in the meantime events like the Battle of Stalingrad and the\nAllied landings 1n Italy -- in one word, the beginning of Germany's defeat had already\nbecome a process which was watched carefully by the Bulgarian authorities, by the\nKing. Historical experience had taught them that in 19-- in World War One, as Allies\nagain of the German lead entente, they were losers, dismembered in terms of territory\nand so on. So the beginning of caution and a little of putting a little bit of distance\nbetween Bulgaria and the Germans had begun, at least in the minds of the King and\nsome other leaders. From -- which in turn mean that it would be most foolish at that\npoint, with Germany obviously losing the War, to hand them over the Jews and thus be\nbranded as a collaborator of Germany and a very humanitarian issue, while by saving the\nJews, Bulgaria could score some points in a future peace conference and get more\nlenient treatment. That was the thinking as, of course, we learned after the War from\nmany, many writings on the subject both from ex-officials and others on the outside.\nEventual shipment to Poland was cancelled as a plan, but our expulsion from Sofia took\nplace. Our own family had to leave three or four days after May 24th, we landed in\nPleven, which we had asked for as a matter of fact.",
        "A: Yeh. Well, the journey itself was rather pleasant, you know, packing and, of course,\ndisposing of most of our stuff either by selling it or passing it on to Bulgarian friends for\nsafekeeping was a very painful process, especially when my mother was ill at the time\nand in hospital, so my father and I virtually had to, had to do the whole packing. But\nagain, I, as a child, for me these were tremendous responsibilities and the very fact that I\nwas able to, to be of some constructive help gave me tremendous satisfaction. We were\nready by the day mentioned in our expulsion orders. My mother, luckily, had fully\nrecovered, and we all went to the train station. And again, here, friendships and, and the\nfact that most Bulgarians, especially urban Bulgarians, had no history of virulent or deep\nseated antisemitism. Little acts of help and assistance and moral support were not\nuncommon. In our particular case we were met at, at the train station by a Bulgarian\nfriend in a high position with the Bulgarian railroads who quietly led us to a\ncompartment, almost a first class compartment. The rest of our brethren had to travel\nthird class, but again, there were no, no cattle cars which our other brothers were carried\nin to their deaths. No, it was a regular Bulgarian train, and we were given a very nice\ncompartment. The men helped us quieted the whole time, but before bidding goodbye\nand a very curt goodbye, we saw that his eyes were filled with tears. He was afraid to\nspeak openly in order not to be seen being so kind to the enemies of the people as we\nwere being to be at the time. But he wanted to say silently and through his tears that\nthere are Bulgarians who feel that this is a tremendous and crazy injustice being done to\nus. It was a very moving moment at that time. The trip itself was very pleasant. Of\ncourse, for two children like my sister and I, we looked at the June sunny sky and it was\nfun.",
        "A: Yeh.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: We were met at the train station by the sister of -- well by the sister of the husband -- my\naunt's husband. They were originally from Pleven and that's why we actually pushed to\nget sent to Pleven because we had some family there on, on my aunt's side -- her\nhusband's side. So these nice people were there waiting for us, as they had probably done\nit for many other friends and acquaintances from Sofia. They took us directly to their\nown house. A small house, but on three floors, already filled with other expellees from\nSofia. And they gave us their own bedroom and they moved to the attic in order to\naccommodate us. It was unbelievable. After all the shocking and enervating events of the\ndays prior to our departure from Sofia, spending two days in the warm and cheerful\nhospitality of Mrs. Visa and her husband -- that was her name -- was very, very\nrecuperative. By that time the old house where I would call him Uncle Isaac, the\nhusband of my aunt was born and raised, his native city of Pleven and which was\noccupied by another sister of his again became partly available for us. I must mention\nthat my Uncle Isaac and my Aunt Lisa and her two children also came with us on the\nsame, on the same train to Pleven. So whatever -- what living arrangements were made,\nthey were all made for the two families. Of course, with us always being given a little bit\nof priority because we were the guests so to speak and they were returning home in a\nway. Well, eight of us were accommodated in one truly large room with nice access to\nthe back yard. These are one story houses in Pleven, very rustic, but we had a roof over\nour heads and at the beginning, you know, we were treated as guests, always having\nfood prepared by those who already were living there, in the Pleven branch of the\nfamily.\nSo the first few weeks were, weeks of adjustment to a totally new -- to a totally new\nreality. But strangely enough, we arrived -- solace and even enjoyment -- when\ndiscovering that what we had thought originally that was going to be even worse did not\nmaterialize. So for example, we would compare notes with other cities about which we\nwere getting information about restriction on Jews. If we had, let's say only four hours of\ncurfew a day, as opposed to -- as compared to other cities where the Jews were not\nallowed in the streets at all, for a while at least, which did not happen, or if we had more\nparks available and open to us while other cities did not allow their Jews to go to parks.\nWe derived pleasure from such little comparisons as to what can we get away with. And\nindeed after awhile the local authorities in Pleven saw in that influx of Jews from Sofia\nbasically a tourist bonanza of sorts. Well some of us, regardless of the fact that we were\nnot allowed to hold jobs and not own officially property, but some of us had money that\nwas either given to Bulgarian friends and then smuggled monthly back to us, but some\nmoney was brought to each of these outlying areas by the more prosperous Jews. Now,\nthe majority were not in that situation. The majority had to be quartered with other\nJewish families and this was supervised by the Commissariat of Jewish, of Jewish\nAffairs very strictly -- sometimes cramming three or four families in a very, very small\nthree room house. But no one was left without a roof over their heads. There was no\nneed, and I am speaking of Pleven but I think the same happened in the other cities to\nwhich Sofia Jews were banished. There were no large concentration style camps or\nbarracks established for Jews.\nThey were all quartered with other Jews, other local Jews. Now, while housing was\ntaken care of unsatisfactorily -- but still was taken care of this way of course -- the\nquestion of food was not. Many, many Jews didn't have the financial resources to buy\nfood. So again, Jewish organization began to, to occur. The already existing Pleven\nConstitory of Jews was expanded with members among the new arrivals from Sofia, my\nfather included. These people quickly organized soup kitchens to ensure that those Jews\nwho could not afford to buy their own food will have two hot meals daily. The money\ncame primarily from those Jews who, who had some money, and some money was\nprovided by the Commissariat for Jewish Affairs, the very, very bare minimum of\ncourse. Other resources must have been coming from somewhere, but I really have no\nrecollection. I clearly remember the, the long lines twice a day of the Jews waiting to get\ntheir soup. All this happened -- would occur in the Jewish school of Pleven where --\nwhich was the center of all Jewish activities from soup kitchen to lectures to concerts\nthat we organized. Even a Jewish school was organized there. Although we were not\nprohibited from attending Bulgarian high schools -- and I, in fact, began my first class of\nhigh school in Pleven wearing my Star of David -- but yes, Children up to the age of 13\ncould not attend public schools for some reason. I don't know why. I remember it\nbecause I used to take my little sister to the Jewish school in the morning and pick her up\nat noon. So she could go only to the Jewish school in the same place that I described a\nmoment ago where everything else took place, including a school. But surprisingly\neverything functioned superbly.\nBoth the school, the soup kitchen, all the cultural activities that were organized with a lot\nof talent, of course, being present among the Jews there to keep up the spirits of that\ncommunity. And to that extent I am very proud of my father for being one of those who,\nwho helped organize all this, and in that comes a story. Now, of course, they were all\nunder the watchful eye of the antisemitic Commissariat for Jewish Affairs, but apart\nfrom being personally liable for any infractions of the law, they were in no way to be\ncompared to some of the Judenrats\u00ae in, in Eastern Europe during the War. Of course,\n\u00b0 Jewish council (German); term used for Jewish administrative boards appointed by the Nazis to\ntheir circumstances were much more horrible with the Germans being actually there.\nAnd a matter of life and death -- I'm not sarcastic here -- making any judgments, but the\nJewish Consistories in these Bulgarian cities were totally different from the Judenrats.\nSo these are my impressions of Jewish life there and, and they are not unpleasant\nimpressions obviously. I was not one of those who had to wait for soup on the -- I might\nhave felt totally differently. But there was a lot of togetherness. Many Jews became\nmore Jewish during that time. Many Jews became exposed to Zionism for the first time.\nThere were lectures on Zionism. Many Jews started studying Hebrew for the first time.\nSo there was a Jewish reorientation, per force perhaps, but nevertheless a positive\nphenomenon. There were, of course, the outside world. How did the outside world treat\nus. After all, we were there. We had curfew hours, mainly the evening at night. our\nmovements were not that restricted even in the beginning, because it was felt that it\nwould be good for the local economy to allow Jews to go to the movies whenever they\nwanted or to the few places that had some, some sweets or -- remember this is the war\nwith rationing and everything, so many, many foods were absent. As I said, I was\nattending school. In my case I was the only Jew in class.\nAnd again, a little episode here which I think is worth mentioning. The non-Jewish\nmembers of the class, of course, treated me very badly -- mainly verbal abuse.\nOccasionally on the outside, in the street young members of the...of the youth Fascist\norganization Branik who really resembled very much in their uniform, the Brown, the\nBrown shirts in the Hitlerjugend\u2019 in Germany. I knew in advance that if -- when I saw a\ncouple of them that I will be beaten up. So I used to brace myself for that. I would pass\nby. They will slap me in the face, or do something else. I knew that I shouldn't do a\nthing. You know the Nazi, to provoke them further because there was no telling what\nwill happen and just proceed, go on my way. This happened at least once a week to me\non the way to school or back. But in school proper, the amazing thing was that the\nteachers would very often stand up in my defense or would give lectures to, especially a\nteacher of German -- of the German language -- which I was forced to learn at the time.\nAnd when she heard some remarks in class and or saw them pushing me in the corridor,\nfinally one day, she started speaking about Heine*. And she pointed out, \u201cBut do you\nknow that Heine was Jewish.\u201d She turned to the class, \u201c\u201cAnd what does that mean? That a\nperson can be a Jew and can be a good German, a great German poet and writer, just as\nwe have Jews in our country who are poets and writers and mathematicians\u201d -- because\nof a major, prominent mathematician was among the Jews expelled from Sofia and\nliving in Pleven at the time, and he was well known. So I will never forget this kind of\nsupport from this woman who was basically educated in the German language and had\ntraveled extensively to Germany, but remained totally uncontaminated by Nazis on the\noversee Jewish communities and ghettos.\n\u2019 Hitler youth (German); Nazi youth organization.\n* Christian Johann Heinrich Heine\ncrazy hatred of Jews. On the contrary, she stood up. She even exempted me from giving\nthe Fascist salute. Here I should back up and say that every, every class in different\nsubjects -- be it Latin, or Bulgarian language and literature, or German language and\nliterature -- would start with the people's jumping to salute when the Heil Hitler sign or\nthe Bulgarian equivalent of it. Be it in Latin \u201cPro Regia in Patria Parati Summus,\u201d \u201cFor\nthe King and country, we're ready to die.\u201d The same thing in German, and the same thing\nin Bulgarian. Well, she allowed me to remain seated when she would enter the class and\nthe rest would have to give the Fascist greeting to her in German. Yeh, so this was still\n1943. Yeh, 1943. By that time, not only the attitude of individuals like this teacher, but it\nbegan to be obvious that even the authorities had embarked slowly and tacitly without\nany announcement on a sort of benign neglect policy vis a vis the Jews. In other words,\nall the anti-Jewish legislation had to be carried out, but without the same fierce --\nwithout the fierceness that characterized that implementation at the beginning.\nAnd this again was due to the fact that Germany was losing the War. The Soviet Army\nwas advancing rapidly across its own territory. I do not remember whether it was early\n1944 or end of 1943 that. the Russians had virtually expelled all Germans from their\nterritory and were now advancing across Europe. No, it must have been early 1944. But\nanyway -- oh, the major event which I have to come back to in 1943 the sudden death of\nKing Boris, the King of Bulgaria mysteriously -- mysterious death following by two\ndays his return from a meeting with Hitler at Berchtesgaden at Hitler's request. The King\nat that time must have been in his early 40s. We all knew him as a very athletic man, a\nhunter, a man who exercised and hiked a lot. The official story was that he had died of a\n-- from thrombosis, from heart ailment. Nobody believed that at the time, but we didn't\nknow any better. Only after the War did we learn that at that fateful meeting in\nBerchtesgaden, Hitler had asked him very firmly for two things: to finally hand over the\nJews, and to finally send an expedition in force to fight the Soviets on the Eastern Front.\nThe King rejected both demands off hand at that time. It would have been suicidal for\nhim to agree to such acts at the time when Hitler was already losing the War and he\nmaintained diplomatic relations with, with the Soviet Union until the very last moment.\nIn fact, it was the Soviets who after even the establishment of the very pro-Allied\ngovernment in Bulgaria by September fifth of 1944, they declared war on Bulgaria for\npolitical reasons. But to go back to the death of the king, that was a tremendous event.\nObviously, we, the Jews did not know how to feel because we weren't sure how helpful\nhe had been to us. He obviously had acquiesced with a lot of the persecutions against us,\nbut still a King is a King and we were watching with the rest of Bulgaria the news reels\nof his, of his funeral which was really very dramatic with hundreds of thousands of\n\u201d For King of our country we are always ready (Latin)\npeople lining the routes of the funeral procession in Sofia and so on. After his death, his\nson, who was still a minor, was proclaimed King, but he had to rule with the help of a\ncouncil of regents made of three people. One of them was the Mr. Filov who, until that\ntime, was Prime Minister of Bulgaria and was responsible for most of the antisemitic\nactions of Bulgaria during that time. The fact that he became a regent and someone else,\nagain from the Fascist party, came to power at least explains the benign neglect towards\nthe Jews, the -- that occurred towards the end of 1943. They were preoccupied with other\nthings and besides, the new Prime Minister, although a Fascist, was not such an\nideological fanatic as Mr. Filov who and the other Minister Gabrovski'\u00b0, Minister of\nInternal Affairs.",
        "A: You mean that period of the--",
        "A: Of the benign neglect?",
        "A: Well, life was getting more hopeful. It was obvious that even the Commissariat for\nJewish Affairs did not, did not bother so much about, about supervising every little detail\nof the -- of life in the Jewish Community of Pleven and my father being one -- a member\nof the Consistory, that was a relief because they didn't have to be called up and lectured\nor abused verbally about the little local commissars. Conversations at home or when\nvisiting friends and relatives, of course, would continue to be conducted on -- with little\nmaps about the War. How we got our information? Apart from newspapers, it was very\ndifficult, but some Jews managed to smuggle \u2014 no, to smuggle themselves into the\nhouses of Bulgarian friends and listen secretly to the BBC and the Voice of America and\nthen, of course, pass it on to the rest of us. So we were informed about the, the progress\nof Allied advances all over Europe.\nAnd becoming more and more hopeful that if nothing had happened until then, it was\nobvious that we, we may not be sent to Poland. That fear was lurking all the time. So the\nprayers were, \u201cLet the Allies arrive as quickly as possible and liberate us.\" Now we did\nnot know that last minute death marches occurred in Hungary and anything -- a lot of\nsimilar things could have happened to us. But you know, when you want to believe, you\nbelieve that you may be saved somehow. And things continued improving in winter and\nspring of \u201944. It was felt slowly that Bulgaria was trying to disengage its -- to put more\n\u2019\u00b0 Petur Gabrovski\nand more distance between itself and the Axis. Not by any terribly dramatic overt\nactions, but simply by, by doing less of, let's say, antisemitic propaganda in the papers.\nNot rescinding any of the existing laws or regulations, but not introducing new ones.\nAnd by end of May of \u201844, a new government under I think the name is Bagrianov''\ncame to power. Mr. Bagrianov made a speech at the beginning which sounded very, very\nencouraging more by what he omitted to say against the Allies or in favor of Germany\nthan by what he said. He organized his government. We began feeling that some of the\nrestrictions were quietly lifted against us, but minor restrictions, like restrictions on\nmovement. For example, the night curfew by that time was quietly dropped -- at least in\nPleven, that's what I can speak about.\nBy August -- and I remember the date because it was the date of the speech, the speech\nof Mr. Bagrianov for the radio about which we knew somehow in advance. We must\nhave gotten the word through a Western Radio station that he will make a major speech.\nAnd in that speech he openly started speaking against Germany, about the desire of his\ngovernment to leave the Axis, about his desire to meet Allied terms, reasonable terms for\npeace, and about the abolition, the abolition in the new future of all anti-Jewish\nlegislation. And, indeed, by August 30th of the, of the same year, all anti-Jewish laws\nwere rescinded. That was nine or 10 days before the Soviet Army entered Bulgaria.\nFeelers to the Allies for a separate peace were sent out. They didn't work. In the\nmeantime, the Soviet Army was advancing. Several governments were toppled and came\nto power. The most recent -- on September second -- of Muraviev\u2019\u2019, a very pro-Western,\nliberal person, who openly declared war on Germany, but did not get any peace offer\nfrom anyone else. So, for a few days Bulgaria was at war with all the countries in the\nworld, both with the Allies and with the, with the Axis. Then the Red Army marched\ninto Bulgaria unopposed on September ninth. This coincided with partisans of\nBulgarians and among them Jews coming down from the mountains and taking over\npower in the major cities. I was there when this occurred. I was outside. I don't know\nwhy I was on the street -- on the main street, actually, when the partisans came down\nfrom the mountains in Pleven, took positions with guns. By that time the Fascist police\nhad totally disappeared. And then some of them, I think, some of the Jewish partisans\nwho could spot the Jewish young boys like me -- I was 14 at the time -- will recruit us on\nthe spot to come with them while searching the homes of prominent Fascists, especially\nformer police chiefs and things like that.\nI was taken by one young partisans to help him go through the pockets of the just-\ndeposed Chief of Police of Pleven. It was quite an experience for me. I was shaking,\n'' Tyan Bagrianov\n'* Kosta Muraviev\nshaking more, more violently than the man himself who knew that he will be shot almost\nthe same day, and I think he was, by the partisans, summarily without any.... But you\ncouldn't blame them knowing what the local police had done against partisans, bombing\nentire houses with the people in them when they would get word that the partisans were\nhiding and this again, we eyewitnesses to that. So a personal experience was helping a\nyoung partisan while he was holding the gun pointed at the local Chief of Police and I\nwent through his pockets and searched him bodily, him and his wife and his young\ndaughter. Another impression deeply engraved from the same day when the partisans\ncame down -- I remember one Jewish partisan marching into the Consistory, and then at\ngun point marching out all the members of the entire leadership, including my father.\nNow, this partisan was a Communist who felt that the previous -- the Jewish leadership\nwho had helped the Jewry -- the local Jewry really survived the impact quite well, but\nthat they were not progressive enough for his taste. This very soon was taken care of\nbecause obviously this Jewish partisan was acting on his own, and not with the\nknowledge of the Fatherland Front which was the umbrella organization of all anti-\nFascist forces, with the Communist Party, of course, playing a very leading role in it. But\nit was a wide coalition at that time. And they had -- they were very well informed. They\ndid not consider any Bulgarian Jew as a collaborator of the Fascists. So this was taken --\nbut it was a very ugly thing for these people, finally on the day of liberation, rejoicing,\nhaving kept the spirit, to be marched out as criminals by an over zealous Jewish\nCommunist.",
        "A: Yes. I remember my father coming out. I was next to them because the home of the\nformer Chief of Police, whom I had helped search, and the Jewish school were very\nclose to each other so after having helped the one partisan in his job, I was already free\nto go, and went naturally to the Jewish school. And suddenly I see my father being,\nbeing marched out at gunpoint together with the five or six other members of the\nConsistory. But it lasted very briefly. Apparently, they were just taken to -- I don't know\n-- to a local headquarters of the partisans and within the hour, they were released with\napologies. This was -- but I was very shocked, and very, very deeply hurt, because I\nknew how we had all prayed for the partisans, for the liberators, for the Allies to come\nand here we are suddenly again the enemies of the liberators. That was really ridiculous.\nBut it was handled properly. That was September 9, 1944.",
        "A: Well, with tremendous joy because obviously we were free again, free to return to Sofia.\nA little worried as to what a Soviet occupation of Bulgaria would mean. After all, we\nhad read that and seen movies about life in the Soviet Union prior to that. The news\nabout the agreements at Yalta became finally filtering to us and we began realizing that\nEurope had been sort of divided into spheres and that we unfortunately belonged to the\nsphere that would be under Soviet control. But again the joy of just being free again, of\nbeing alive, of having survived it all and of going home soon was tremendous. And\nindeed, within the week, we were already back in Sofia, back in our apartment. I have no\nrecollections as to how. Oh yes, the previous occupants as very involved with the with\nthe Fascist authorities had escaped, had escaped, and I think they had escaped by the\nwife pulling out a pistol on a domestic flight and forcing it into Turkey. Yes, that, that\nwas it. Yeh. So we found our apartment. We did not conduct any religious cleansing\nservices as they did. Maybe we should have, but we were happy to be back and, and with\nus came the family of my Aunt Lisa, and her two children, and we were only too glad to\ngive them one of the three apartments in the house. The third floor became theirs\nbecause their house had been demolished by an American incendiary bomb during --\nthere were two or three bombing attacks on Sofia by Allied planes. It was mainly\nAmerican and one of them was in February, I think, of \u201844.",
        "A: So, yeh. So, we are back in Sofia, resuming our lives as best we could. I remember that I\nimmediately had to worry about my next school year. It was obviously past September\nfirst, when the school year would really start. But because of the chaos and the changing\ngovernments and everything we were getting extensions, but by October I enrolled in, in\none of the better Sofia public high schools.",
        "A: Well, in Pleven, of course we, on the date when the Russian Army finally reached\nPleven, they had, of course, come to -- from Rumania and to the Danube, through the\nBlack Sea, but troops obviously entered every major Bulgarian city. We all went out to\ngreet them out of curiosity, but also in a fact they were our liberators. But at the back of\nmy mind, I remember -- for example, people, Jews -- Jewish people on the eve of the\narrival of Soviet troops in Pleven would urge each other, \"Well, take good care of your\njewelry and whatever little gold you have because, you know, you never know with the\nSoviets.\u201d And in deed, some of the -- now I have not personally seen that or experienced\nit, but many, many people were telling of the way Russian soldiers, once they arrived\nand would start marching down the streets or become traffic policemen or whatever,\nwould stop people and simply rip their watches off their hands. They were very, very\nhungry, if I can use that word, for the basic amenities of the West. Because, by their\nstandards, Bulgaria was the West at that time. Other excesses really I have not seen or\nobserved. They were behaving as a sort of benign occupation army. Because, after all,\nBulgaria did not offer any opposition. The old Bulgarian gratefulness to the Russian\npeople for their liberation from the Turks back in 1878 is a thread that really passes\nthrough Bulgarian history. No matter what happens, the Bulgarians will never be anti-\nRussian or even anti-Soviet in the sense that some other Eastern European countries can\nbe, because of that historical indebtedness that Bulgarians feel toward the Russians.\nThere were, were no excesses. But of course, one could feel the firm grip of the Soviet\noccupation forces in the sense of organizing the government. The Fatherland Front was\nset in place with Parliament what -- in which all of these anti-Fascist forces were\nrepresented. But what gradually started happening from \u201944 -- from the end of \u201844, \u201845\nwas a gradual reassertion of the Communist element of that coalition. The gradual and\nquiet disappearance of opposition leaders without any explanation. It transpired that they\nwere liquidated physically, one by one, gradually to the point that by 1947, when\nelections were held, the Communist Party had already solidified its control over the\nwhole government and the rest of the so-called coalition partners were really figure\nheads that didn't, didn't count for much. But that's -- this is already jumping ahead.",
        "A: No, \u201944, October.",
        "A: Yeh. Well, it was a very exciting time to be back at school because after so many years\nof suppression and oppression as a Jew, this time, we, the Jews -- the few Jewish pupils -\n- students in every class would feel that we are now in power. And at the beginning, we\nindeed felt that way. We could see how former Fascist or former members of those youth\norganizations that were there, and we knew how they behaved, cowered in our presence,\nwere afraid that we might denounce them or take some other revenge which we did not.\nBut it was very pleasant for awhile to feel on top of the world in this case. Some of us\nwith childish and or youthful enthusiasm and naivete began believing very sincerely in\nthe goals of the Fatherland from this wide coalition of forces opposed to such bad things\nlike Fascism and Imperialism, and so on. We were very quickly disabused from that\noriginal idealistic sympathy, because it was obvious who was running the show. After a\nwhile it was obvious that every, even the Fatherland Front meeting would ultimately\nbecome a session of typically Communist criticism of self criticism. And we had read\nenough by that time of Marx literature which was fed to us at school to know that these\nwere purely Communist ideological tools and were not typical of, let's say, the\nprogressive agrarians or some of the other smaller parties that were in the coalition. A\nstrange phenomenon also began. A new form of antisemitism based on the revulsion of\nsome even progressive Bulgarians, from some of the ideological and other excesses of\nJewish Communists. And with time, we began -- we Jews ourselves began to be quiet\nannoyed and in some cases, quite resentful of that attitude. Well, I will come to that in a\nfew years. My own experiences in one of those so-called volunteer labor brigades.",
        "A: Well. Yeh. Actually by \u201847, I had been for three academic years in school and I\ngraduated because the new government had abolished the so-called eighth grade of high\nschool, which would be equivalent to the American -- well, the last grade of high school.\nSo I graduated very young at the age of 17, and, of course, had to think about my higher\neducation. Now this was already in 1947. The elections took place, supervised by the\nCommunists, and the Communist Party was returned by 99.9 percent. I leave it to\nhistorians to judge the voracity of those results, but those were the results. The\nCommunists were firmly in control which meant -- especially to us Jews who were so\nhungry for Western culture -- especially after the War having -- meaning from the free\nWest, American movies, American books, American magazines, British films and so on.\nFor a while, for two years, \u201844, \u201845, part of \u201846, we were allowed to watch such movies\nand to have access to foreign books. I remember being a member of the British Consul\nLibrary and the small reading room established by the Youth Information Agency in\nSofia. By \u201848, they had been abolished. But suddenly in *47, one could not see a single\nAmerican western movie 1n town or an important Western magazine. Nothing. That was\nvery bothersome to us because it was such an infringement of the newly acquired\nfreedom and a foretaste of things to come -- especially after the Communists had firmly\nestablished themselves in power. And then news from other Eastern European countries,\nfrom Czechoslovakia for example, the events, the death of Masaryk\u2019? and the overthrow\nof the last truly democratic government there. A close friend of mine was the son of the\nBulgarian Ambassador to Czechoslovakia during that time so I heard it firsthand as to\nwhat had happened. That was in 1947. I mention this because this fact plus the elections\nplus the events in the Middle East with the passage of the Partition Resolution of the\nUnited Nations in -- was it November of \u201947? All of these factors combined within the\nhearts and minds of Bulgarians Jews, and I felt, like anybody, else that the time to go has\narrived. Now, with the return of the Communist Party to power, the return of Jewish\nproperty, which had started in 1944, was stopped and new laws expropriating all\nproperty from all Bulgarian citizens, Jews and non-Jews alike, was taking place. So, we\nsaw that in several respects we were even worse off than under the Fascists, under a new\nCommunist legislation. So the feeling was, \u201cIf a State of Israel 1s proclaimed, we should\ngo as quickly as we can.\u201d\n'S Jan Masaryk\nAnd indeed, that's what happened. When the State of Israel was proclaimed in May of\n1948, Bulgarian Jews by that time had organized themselves in every conceivable type\nof Zionist organizations. The lists of potential immigrants were -- had already been\ndrawn up. So we were ready and the Bulgarian government received permission from the\nSoviet Union, just as the governments of other Eastern European countries, to allow\nevery Jew who wants to leave for Palestine to leave. I will not go into the rationale for\nthis, for this Soviet policy, but obviously it had some very pragmatic reasons behind it.\nNow -- but to go a little bit back again to \u201947, I became active again in Zionist\norganizations. I had decided that if I am given the chance to leave for Israel or for\nPalestine, I would leave. But in the meantime I had to think of the immediate future, and\nthat was higher education. To qualify for admission to Sofia University, or any other\nuniversity, unless you had very good Communist Party credentials, the only other thing\nthat might give you a chance to be considered for admission was to volunteer for service\nin one of the many labor brigades organized by the government when the young people\ngo to build roads or a little villages for children and so on. I participated in one such\nvillage which we toiled hard to build, but never came to pass, because it was just work\nfor work's sake. It was just to say that you are doing something. So I joined a brigade\nlike that and was unfortunate to have as my brigade commandant a Bulgarian Jewish\nCommunist. He made my life a misery, knowing that I am a Jew, and knowing that I am\nthe son of a prominent lawyer, a non-Communist, somebody who was active during the\nWar and so on. It was obvious that that class struggle mentality was there as though we,\nthe Jews were enemies of each other. No Bulgarian Jew had ever exploited any other\nBulgarian Jew in order to carry the class struggle to that point. But that was the\nideological predilection of these people. So he gave me hell during that time. I remember\nthat and I mention that for one reason: Later on by the time some of the Bulgarian\nJewish Communists fell in disfavor with the Bulgarian authorities, especially after the\nSix Day War in Palestine, this particular man immigrated to Palestine. And I saw him in\nthe street. I ignored him, but others who had suffered under different circumstances gave\nhim a sound beating there. If he is alive I wish him well in Israel.",
        "A: Yeh. So, the -- from the vote on the Petition of Palestine in the fall of 1947, Bulgarian\nJewry was freely aflame with Zionist fervor if I can say so. I will never forget the\nmanifestations. Yeh, the march through the streets of Sofia with, with lit candles. I am\ntrying to remember whether this was the night of the Partition Resolution or the date of\nthe Proclamation of the State. No, I think it was the Proclamation of the State. That was\nsomething unbelievable. In a country already openly ruled by the Communist Party, a\nspontaneous demonstration, which really the authorities -- although they were officially\nvery anti-Zionist, anti-Zionist with all the permission on the part of the Soviet Union for\nJews to immigrate into Israel, but the official policy was against Zionism because Stalin\ndid not believe in Zionism -- but the Bulgarian authorities allowed us to march in\nsupport of the new State of Israel and it was very touching. And you could see that all\nthese people who are not allowed, or whose little demonstration on May 24, 1943 was\ncrushed, were here marching freely in a Communist country in support of the newly born\nState of Israel. A memorable evening!",
        "A: Now already in, in late \u201847, a lot of Jews began immigrating to Palestine, taking the risk\nof being stopped by British ships and diverted to Cyprus. Even relatives of mine did that,\nand lived in -- on Cyprus for almost, what -- seven months until the establishment of the\nState of Israel, when the borders opened. So Bulgarian Jewish immigration began\nalready in \u201847. Primarily younger people but some young families as well. The mass\naliyah\u2019* -- the mass immigration, began really one day after the establishment of the\nState. Already on May 16, Bulgarian Jews were leaving. Of course, aliyah depended on\nthe transportation capabilities of the young State. Strangely enough within a few months,\ntwo major ships were already put at the disposal of Bulgarian Jews for immigration: The\nPan York, the Pan Crescent. I came on the -- to Israel on the Pan Crescent in December\nof 1948. Within a period of -- a period from let's say June of \u201848 through February,\nMarch of \u201849, all 48,000 or more of the surviving Bulgarian Jews -- obviously, they all\nsurvived World War Two -- immigrated to Palestine. A very small number of Jews,\neither Communists or very old people, people who did not feel that transplanting\nthemselves at that point in their lives would be advisable, stayed behind. And this in\nitself was amazing to see: an entire community which had lived for most of the time very\npeacefully and in prosperity almost 500 years among, in the Balkans, among Bulgarian\nSlavs, suddenly transplanting itself to the Middle East and starting a new life in the\nnewly re-born State of Israel.",
        "A: Yeh. Well, I together with a group of other boys, young Bulgarians, we registered\nknowing that we will be conscripted on arrival in Israel. We knew that we would join the\nyoung army and that was our desire. That was December of \u201848, the time of the so-called\nsecond truce in the fighting in the War of Liberation of 1948. Well, excitement! Not\nknowing to what we are going. I had never been very, very sportsman-like or anything\nlike that. I had no idea of how to hold a rifle, but I was prepared to go and so were some\nof my friends. On our way there, by this marvelous, newly-acquired ship, Pan Crescent,\nwhich left the Yugoslavia port of Bar and also took a great number of Hungarian Jews\n'* Immigration of Jews to Israel (Hebrew)\nwho had also come to Yugoslavia. Of course we reached Yugoslavia from both countries\nby train, a lengthy three day journey in tremendous cold. But once on the ship, it was\nlike a festival really of people who are free and are going to fight in a war. They don't\nknow what expects them, but it was fantastic. The spirits was very high. I, who had\nnever been really separated from my parents, I forgot all about my family and got carried\naway in this wave of enthusiasm. Of course, reality has a way of denting enthusiasm of\nevery kind. On arrival the prosaic reality of being picked up from the ship and sent to\ntransition military camp, which was horrendous, of course. Jews -- young Jews from all\nover the world without the common language arriving there. It was no fun, especially\nknowing that or not knowing exactly where they will send you and so on.\nEnd Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: It was exhilarating in some aspects, but very worrying in others. The reason being\nprimarily that until we arrived there in this camp, I had not heard about the Gate. Of two\nother groups of young Bulgarian Jews who had arrived in Israel on previous ships, and\nwho apparently with a minimum of training, almost none, and with a minimum of arms\nhad been sent on a particular day, on the afternoon as I understand it, to Latrun in so-\ncalled triangle between -- halfway between the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, a very strategic\nplace of tremendous importance in the attempts of the young State to stop the onslaught\nof the five Arab armies that had invaded Israel. In this case, of course, the main threat\nwas the Egyptian Army, and I think the purpose was not to allow them to make -- to\nbreak through it \u2014 Latrun -- in order to converge with other invading Arab armies.\nReinforcements apparently were not available. Ben-Gurion\u2019\u2019, Prime Minister and\nCommander-in-Chief at the time had to make a very, very fateful decision of using these\nyoung Bulgarian new arrivals almost as gun fodder by sending them there and trying to\nuse them to just hold the fort until proper reinforcement would arrive. Well, they did\nheld the fort; Latrun was not lost. It was saved, but all of them lost their lives. Again, I\nmay be mistaken, but I think the number reached 600. Well, you can imagine to a 17\nyear old, when you are told all of this and obviously a fact that had happened several\nweeks prior to your own arrival in Israel, you really don't know what to do. You don't\nhave the benefit of your parents' counsel. You listen to what the other guys tell you. This\nguy was telling me, \"Well, if you don't want to end up this way, try to somehow join the\nAir Force.\" He had, somehow. And I will not go into the details of how I managed to get\ninto a force that was exclusively volunteer. There is a Hebrew word for that Mahal, a\nabbreviation for \u201cMitnadevei Hutz La\u2019 Aretz,'\u00b0\u201d \u201cVolunteers from Overseas.\u201d But Mahal\nmeant the people from English speaking or other affluent countries. All of us who came\nfrom Eastern Europe were known as the category of Gahal, \u201cGe\u2019us Hutz La\u2019 Aretz,'\u201d\n\u201cConscripted from Overseas.\u201d We were conscripted, they were volunteers. Well, some\nhow with the help of the little English that I knew at that time, I did join the Air Force. I\nwas privileged to be a member of the first course in the history of the Jewish people for\nradar technicians and I became one of Israel, Israel's Air Force's first radio technicians\nusing naval radar equipment for detecting planes. But that part of it was very exciting\nbeing amongst so many young Jews from all over the world. And especially getting to\nknow American and British and Australian English speaking young Jews, and see that:\nthe depth of their commitment, of their volunteerism, of their Zionist. I am bearing in\n'\u00b0 David Ben-Gurion\n'\u00ae Foreign volunteers (Hebrew)\n'\u2019 Foreign draftees (Hebrew)\nmind all the time that they came there out of choice. Most of us came from Bulgaria also\nout of deliberate Zionist choice, but we also at the back of my mind --of our minds, we\nhad the lack of future under the Communism. But these young, young people did have a\nchoice, and they still decided to come. So, it was very exciting. The beginnings of a\nculture if you wish, cross-fertilization with other, with other parts of the Jewish people.\nFor us -- especially Bulgarian Jews who had been raised in the European Sephardic\ntradition with a very small Ashkenazi minority -- that was the first really contact with\nJews that were different from us and we had to make a lot of cultural and emotional\nadjustments.",
        "A: Yeh. The Bulgarian community arrived at the ttme when the formerly Arab town of\nJaffa, which is almost adjacent to Tel Aviv, because of the flight of its inhabitants at the\nheight of the fighting during the War of Liberation, was virtually empty. The abandoned\nArab property was put under the custodian of absentee property and was available for\nnew immigrants. So around the time that the Bulgarian aliyah immigration wave was at\nits height, Jaffa was almost empty and open for resettlement. And that is where I would\nsay the majority of the Bulgarian Jews, at least 20 to 25,000 settled at first. And pretty\nsoon, Jaffa became a Bulgarian city, with Bulgarian signs on shops with Bulgarian\ntranslation on movies and began to thrive. Very few Bulgarian Jews remained in the\nimmigration transition camps, Mahanot Olim'*, in Hebrew, where people from other\ncountries sometimes stayed for two, three years before they could find their own way out\nand had to rely on the Jewish agency or government assistance. Bulgarian Jews very\nquickly took care of themselves, primarily by settling in places like, like Jaffa or Lydda,\nanother Arab town, which population had fled the country or Ramla, another Arab town\nso these were newly created Bulgarian Jewish communities. Very enterprising and self-\nreliant with, with many craftsmen and artisans and people of free professions like\nlawyers, engineers and doctors among them. The Bulgarians did very well for\nthemselves, and after awhile began leaving those original areas, like Jaffa, Ramla and\nLydda, and settling in the more affluent areas of Tel Aviv or Jerusalem or Haifa.",
        "A: Well, my family arrived in February of \u201849. By that time I was already serving in the\nArmy. I had found them a place to live. My father, as I mentioned, had to make the very\npainful adjustment from being a prominent lawyer in his native language into -- and at\nthat time, he didn't even know whether he would be able to practice again -- so what he\ndid at first was just work anywhere, usually clerical jobs because he already knew some\n'S immigrant camps (Hebrew)\nHebrew. But he also applied himself very, very devotedly and strenuously to studying\nnot only the Hebrew language but taking the special courses that were devised for\nlawyers coming from overseas. He studied hard for three or four years and passed the\nBar Examination, the special Bar Examination again, and at the age of 65 began\npracticing again. So we settled in Tel Aviv. My mother had some money in Palestine\nfrom an inheritance from her father, who as I mentioned lived in Egypt and at that time\nhad the forethought of buying some property in Palestine which came in handy later. At\nfirst, I -- after completing my military service, I enrolled in the Haifa Technion, thinking\nas a majority of my friends did, that only a real trade will, will do in Israel and especially\nin my case, observing the tragedy of the readjustment of my father when you have a\nprofession that relies on the language. Well, I made the wrong choice. It was very\npragmatic, but I was not cut out for engineering. After two years, I dropped out, began\nwriting for the local Bulgarian -- for the Tel Aviv Bulgarian language daily, which was\nquite a necessary cultural and even absorption instrument for the Bulgarian, Bulgarian\nJewry during the time since their arrival for the necessary five or six years until they\ncultural integrated into the life of Israel.",
        "A: For 20 years, for 20 years. I lived there for 20 years. I graduated with a BA in political\nscience from the Tel Aviv branch of the Hebrew University, which now 1s the Tel Aviv\nUniversity in -- my degree was in journalism and diplomacy. I soon after graduating, I\njoined the staff of the U.S. Information Service at the American Embassy in Tel Aviv as\nan Israeli citizen, a local employee. Worked successfully for the U.S. Embassy for\nalmost nine years in the capacity of Assistant Press Officer and editor of both English\nand Hebrew publications. That, combined with my studies of political science and\ndiplomacy, developed in me the great desire to become a diplomat. And I started\nknocking on the doors of the Israel Foreign Ministry. Unfortunately -- at the time I hope\nthis practice has been abandoned -- the distribution of jobs of this foreign ministry was\nbased on the so-called \u201cparty key.\u201d Well, I did belong to the right party, Mapai'\u201d. But\nthat was the party of the majority and we Bulgarian Jews were not sufficiently a pressure\ngroup so as to justify giving me a job without attaining any particular or further any\nparticular political interest because it was like preaching to the converted. They had our\nsupport. Well, I stayed on with the American Embassy, but after a trip to this country as\nguest of the U.S. Government as some -- I think my well deserved training and\norientation after almost seven years of service with USIA\u201d\u2019 -- when I was given a chance\nto visit coast to coast for three months and, and fall in love with a country that I had been\nselling to my fellow Israelis for the years prior to that. I decided that, if given a chance, I\n Mifleget Po\u2019alei Eretz Israel [Labor Party of Israel] (Hebrew)\nUnited States Information Agency\nwould like to come here. Especially after having taken part in three wars and having a\nfive and a half year old son, whom I wanted, unlike me, to taste life especially in his\nformative years, in a country, where at least the country itself is not at war or is not the\npassage ground of occupying forces and things like that. Of course, the Vietnam War\nwas raging, but the United States itself -- the territorial United States was at peace, and I\nknew that by the time he grew up, that war at least would be taken care of.\nSo it was my own fatigue with living for survival\u2019s sake. War after war, adjustment after\nadjustment, politics determining my life. I was sick and tired of that, and this coupled\nwith my desire to allow my son to taste something different from what I had gone\nthrough, and the fact that I fell in love with this country when I visited it extensively in\nthe spring of \u201967. And when the chance presented itself that I was offered the position at\nthe Hoover Institution at Stanford*\u2019, I came to this country. But I was very honest with\nmyself. I did not come here just to study. I obtained release from the Army. As an\nimmigrant, I took immigrant visas for myself and for my former wife by using\nrespectively the Bulgarian and the Polish quotas, I left the country to which I had gone\nto participate in its War of Liberation somewhat discouraged, I must admit.\nDisillusionment, of course, but disillusioned was more my problem. It's when you raise\ntoo many unrealistic expectations about people or countries, you're bound to be\ndisillusioned if they don't live up in real life to that. But it was more my lack of faith or\nlack of ability to see down the road what would happen in that part of the world in terms\nof peace. And I thought that I owed it to myself before beginning the down slope ride in\nterms of age, at least a chance to see the world from a perspective of non-involvement, at\nleast immediate non-involvement, in such events as continuing warfare and living in a --\njust a struggle for mere survival. I wanted to give myself this chance. Of course, I could\nremain deeply interested in the State of Israel. My entire family lives there, sister, aunts,\ncousins and so on. I have a tremendous stake in the survival of that country. I would do\ngladly anything to further the cause of peace because I think that only through some\npolitical accommodation in peace will the future of that small and beloved country be\nassured.",
