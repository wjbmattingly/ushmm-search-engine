The boys were learning Russian, but the \u2014 the girls, three girls were not\nlearning Russian. They were not allowed own \u2014 to speak Russian at home, because\nPoland was occupied. So, it was like resentment. But later on, of course, she\nlearned Russian. And she understood Italian and she understood Spanish. From\nknowing those languages, when we came to America they often ask her when she\nwas in a hospital, to be translator for the people that they couldn\u2019t communicate\nwith, you know, so th-they could [indecipherable]",

        "A: So you know, from that I got what they had because I only saw pictures of that\nplace when I was small. But y-you know, they never bragged, they never bragged\nabout anything and anything. They were t \u2014 we were told from childhood to be very\nhelpful to people, to be nice to people, to be polite to everybody. If anybody needs\nhelp, you have to help them and everything.

Well, talk to the person, you\nknow.",
        "Q: Yeah. So, did your mother, when the revolution happened, this is, you know,\nseveral years before your birth, was she already married, was she already living\nthere \u2014",
        "A: They got married \u2014 I don\u2019t know on what day they got married exactly, but they\ngot married, and they lived still in Rudakow(ph). And in Rudakow(ph) there was\nGerman army stationed over there. This was through first World War. And what\nhappened was that eventually the German army went communistic, and the other\nside was communistic, and they all dropped their rifles and they said, why are we\nfighting? And the Germans dress my mother and my father as German soldiers and\nput them on the train to evacuate that, because they started killing all the\n[indecipherable] over there already, and especially the bourgeois, you know. So\nthe Germans evacuated them, and my father said that the Russians were shooting at\nthat German 1n train, and the machinists run away. And my grandfather was\nbuilding Trans-Siberian railroad in Russia, and my father traveled the loco \u2014\nlocomotive, so my father went and he was running the train to Poland because they\nhad nobody to run the train, they didn\u2019t know how to operate it. And my father said\nhe was lucky that when he came to the Polish border \u2014 already Poland had a\nJune 20, 2014\nborder, they stopped them. And they didn\u2019t like people coming from the east, but\nmy father ask, who 1s the commanding officer there? And he \u2014 my father knew him\nwhen he said, tell him that it\u2019s me. So they let them go into Poland, because they\ncould have turned them in, and there was big trouble, you know, people moving\nthere and back.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But you didn\u2019t tell my mother, you see, we could have come to America,\nclearly, because she was born in Russia. But Americans would have given her a\nRussian visa right away to come to America, because there was no quota number\nfrom Russia, but my mother wouldn\u2019t let be put that she was born in Russia,\nbecause may be a Russian. So she refused to do it, and she said that she was born in\nRudakow/(ph), Poland. I can show her passport to you \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 even, I have her passport. Because we resented \u2014 you see, we considered\nRussia inhuman land, because it\u2019s \u2014 the minute you cross \u2014 I am not talking about\nthe Russian people, but the land is inhuman. When you go in there and you see,\nJune 20, 2014\nwhen you cross Ural mountains, you go for days and days, every now and then you\nsee some sediment, they \u2014 where did they put coal, or something. And there\u2019s\nnothing but rivers, forests, everything\u2019s empty. People were all walking with\nmosquito nets on their face, million of mosquitos. Where they deported us there\nwas a forest, we were asking Russians, how far does the forest go? Nobody knew.\nThey just didn\u2019t know what it was, and they didn\u2019t know much about the world. In\nthat village a lot of people never saw a plane. Some of them used to go to \u2014 to\ndeliver, you know, by truck something, so they knew \u2014 they saw trains, but the\nchildren didn\u2019t see trains.",

        "A: \u2014 because \u2014",
        "Q: Landowners.",
        "A: Landowner. Because you have to realize that in Poland, people look down on\nbeing a trader, on being something at your business like this. They like to have\nownership and they were [indecipherable] you know, this was the part of people,\nthey took part in the wars. The peasants didn\u2019t have to fight, but the Polish peasants\nwere not slaves, but they didn\u2019t have to fight. And that\u2019s why so many Jews, cause\n[indecipherable] he had the girlfriend Jewish, and they brought a lot of Jewish\npeople, and they open up Poland to the Jews, because they needed people in\nbusiness and in everything, and a lot of Jewish people came to Poland. Actually, a\nJune 20, 2014\nmason showed me in America papers the Jews used to, 1600, how to come to\nPoland. It was shown that there was nothing, no towns or nothing.

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And you see, I studied very little Polish history, I know, but the Jewish people\nwere welcome in Poland because you know, some people say, well, you\npersecuted us. I said, why did you come? Nobody ask you. You were invited to\ncome, but surely, to open the trade. And \u2014 and that was it. Very often we were told\nby Jewish people even in Wilno, you own the street, we own the houses, you\nknow, so that was the \u2014 all the businesses, if you went to stores or something, like\nwe used to go and buy clothes, and everything was in \u2014 most in Jewish stores, you\nknow. Later on they started making cooperatives in Poland, so \u2014 like we had to sell\nJune 20, 2014\na cow or a horse or a grain; everything will being always sold to Jewish people. But\ngenerally before the war, they started making trading organization, and you know,\nthe \u2014 and that was different. But the \u2014 but the thing was, you know, who knows?\nBy now everybody\u2019s so mixed up over there, nobody knows who\u2019s who. Like you\nknew history.",

        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: And the Japanese saw it right away, they have \u2014 you slanted eyes, and they\ntreated me very differently from Americans. And when I told them that I\u2019m Polish,\nwell, they loved Polish people because Polish people hated the Russians. And this\nwas after the Korean war, and you know, when Russians marched and took kore \u2014\nup north, Japan, well they never released it, and they said that was the reason the\nJapanese surrendered so fast in second World War. It wasn\u2019t only atomic weapons,\nbut the Russians invaded already, Japan. And they were petrified that Russia will\ntake all of Japan. And Japanese from first World War, they hate them.",

        "A: But it was \u2014 1t was \u2014 it was a beautiful life. You see, I was born with a heart.\nWhen I went to school in Poland, they put us in front of the machine when we\nwere small, and they looked at our lungs. A-And they saw my heart that I was in\nthe wrong position, so I was not allowed to ride on the bicycle, I was not allowed to\ntake exercises. They said they \u2014 by 21 my heart will come to normal position, that\nit happens in children. We had a very good doctor, Salzman(ph).

But over there they told me that you never get\ntuberculosis, because you have very, extremely large lungs, you know, in that\nschool. And \u2014 but I\u2014 I\u2014I couldn\u2019t do a lot of things that other children were doing.\nThey didn\u2019t let me, you know, I stunk exercises.\nJune 20, 2014",

And my mother\nwas coming to school, and there was a bunch of guys pulling me on the stairs by\nthe legs. That did it, my mother took me out the school. And you see, I was from a\nfarm, as my uncle, and I wasn\u2019t living in Wilno. So the people from Wilno, the\nkids, they didn\u2019t like me, tha \u2014 because I was from the country, you see? People are\nvery clannish, immediately clannish. So they didn\u2019t like me. And I remember one\ntime, one guy was giving me so much trouble. And you know those furnaces to\nheat the house with \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 and he started to \u2014 accusing me, and I grabbed him by the neck and I started\nhitting his head into that iron. Thank God there was some guy and they stopped me,\nI could have killed the guy. I was pretty strong you know about things \u2014",

        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: Okay, and \u2014",
        "A: But Jewish kids were mostly in Jewish schools. Wilno had Jewish schools,\nJewish universities, Jewish everything. It was a big cultural center of Judaism. You\nknow, in Poland there were what, three and a half million Jews, supposedly. That\nwas 10 percent of Polish population. So it was a great \u2014 what \u2014 what remain of\nJudaism. A lot of it was saved be \u2014 by being in Poland. The only thing, the Jews\ndidn\u2019t understand what pogrom was. Pogrom was when the Cossacks from\nUkraine were beating, but they were beating everybody. They were beating Jews,\nJune 20, 2014\nthey were beating us. There were \u2014 supposedly the tsar of Russia used Jews as tax\ncollectors, so Russians wouldn\u2019t like the Jews for being tax collectors. You know,\nthere\u2019s such a messy, this world always, the more you look at it, the worse it gets.\nThat\u2019s my opinion from my experience.",
        "Q: Well, when you were a kid going to school, did all those \u2014 did those things play\nout in the classroom, or play out outside of the classroom?",
        "A: Oh, we played outside. We were \u2014 no, but we had gymnastics in Poland. Oh,\nthere were lines to climb, you know, there were a thing, you jump over the horses \u2014",
        "Q: Oh no, but what I me \u2014 what I meant by play out, I meant, did these issues of\nclannishes \u2014 clannishness and you know, kids being either from wealthy parents or\nfrom poor parents, or Jewish kids, or \u2014",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t that, it was \u2014 no, it wasn\u2019t that. It was what region you\ncome from.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: You see, when they played, you know, in Wilno you saw there are courtyards.",
        "Q: Yes, right.",
        "A: So if a child from this courtyard were to come to play on this courtyard, they\ntold him, go and play in your own courtyard, leave our courtyard alone. People are\nso clannish that \u2014\nJune 20, 2014",
        "Q: So it\u2019s territorial.",
        "A: Territorial almost, you know, and that exists everywhere that you go, and 1s\nbetween the nations. Now that I\u2019m old, I realize it. I remember that when all \u2014 later\non from India, I was sent to Africa, to Uganda, to a camp \u2014 Polish refugee camp.\nAnd the boys who are there, from India that came, and they said to me, you know,\nwe can\u2019t even go to a dance. This \u2014 Ugandan [indecipherable] won\u2019t accept us,\nthey call us. They call us Indians, and they don\u2019t want us. They were there maybe\nfour or five years in that camp, and we just came over. And I remember I came\nover and I met a very [indecipherable] girl, you know, and I went over there, and\nsome of the guys from India went over there, and I learned to fight pretty well in\nIndia. And I asked them, who is the leader of those boys? And they told me, well I\ndance, and I hit him so hard dancing polka, that he fell down. I stood over him, I\nsaid, do you want more, or no? And he said no. And our boys got up and they could\nalready dance and play. But this is the clannishness of people. They were\nconsidering themselves African and we were Indians already to them.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re already Pole \u2014 and your always \u2014 you were all Poles.",
        "A: And we were all Poles or from Russia. But you see, this 1s clannishness, this 1s\nunbelievable in people. I notice it everywhere. Everywhere I notice it, clannish.\nLook at when I was drafted into American army. There were five Jewish guys, and\nJune 20, 2014\nthere were three Ukrainians, and we all stuck together, we were \u2014 we were the best\nof friends, all the time, because we were from Poland and from Ukraine, so we\u2019re\nfrom that region, and in American army. We felt that we have to protect ourselves\nfrom those dumb Americans, who choose to step on our feet, you know. It\u2019s right\naway, and it was, you know \u2014 I told you about this Jewish fellow, Jakubovic(ph)\n[indecipherable]. He was in the American army, and he was in the barrack. He\nspent the whole war in a concentration camp in Germany. And he used to wake up\nat night and scream. I went to Americans, explaining, please do something for this\nguy. He spent \u2014 well, Americans didn\u2019t understand what it\u2019s all about. Finally, I got\nto the rabbi. In the army there are various religions, you know \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 people, and I got to a rabbi, went to a rabbi, and I told him, I said, this is\ncriminal what they\u2019re doing to these guys. He wakes up and he thinks, in the\nmiddle of the night that he\u2019s in German concentration camp. And they moved him\nright away, the rabbi put him in a separate room, and no more training, military\ntraining, he was taken care of the hot water for us. And bu-but \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 but\npeople just don\u2019t understand, people don\u2019t understand other people in this world.\nVery often a lot of misunderstandings are befall that.",
        "Q: Well \u2014\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: And there are \u2014 and then there are a lot of very bad people. I wish they would\nget rid of them early, when they start only. But how do you know that they are\ngoing to be bad [indecipherable]",
        "Q: That\u2019s true, you don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t know.",
        "A: This is [indecipherable] Jesus Christ parables, you read about it, that there 1s a\ngood tree and a bad tree. And a good tree will give good fruits, and a bad tree will\ngive you nothing. And the same thing with people. You get some people that will\nbe mean, and hurt a lot of people and everything, and there are people who will\nhelp you.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to Wilno. I want you to paint a picture for me, of what did this\ncity in northeast Poland look like? What kind of a city, how would you describe it?",
        "A: What?",

        "Q: Mm-hm. So when you would walk down the main street in Wilno as a child,\nwhat do you remember seeing? What kind of people were on the streets?",
        "A: Oh, they were \u2014 part of the town was Polish, and part of the town was Jewish,\nthere were so many Jews over there, Hassidim and everything. And there \u2014 and\nJune 20, 2014\nthere were no more people, there were very few Lith-Lithuanians. There were\nalmost no Lithuanians in Wilno. And mo-mo-mostly Polish.",

I don\u2019t know [indecipherable] and he was doing something. So we used to\nsteal those, with his children, and we used to tie it to the cat\u2019s tail, and cat\u2019s tail was\nrunning like crazy because it was rattle and making so much noise. And you know,\nwe were going together, we were all playing together. W-We had no friction that I\nremember of. I told you that I was dark and I was very often taken as Jewish. When\nmy mother used to go to stores, they used to say on za nasza, he\u2019s from ours, you\nknow.",

And I had the teacher at home teaching me, I think\nfour grades, first grades I was at home and we had a teacher, private teacher. And\nmy father said, it\u2019s beautiful day, we go over there. And we went over there. And\nthere were so many snails in the grass, and I started picking them. And I put my\nJune 20, 2014\nhands to here and here and here in the water. Well, what happened, I got a little\nblister here, I got a little blister here, I got a little blister here. My mother took me\nto the hospital in Wilno. In Wilno they punctured them. The next thing, I got a\nhundred blisters, spread up. And we were going to go \u2014 go into Charnabore(ph),\nand you know, that was three kilometers to go to Wilno. And there was\nLeznakow(ph), he had the store with the groceries, with everything. And he said,\nthere is a famous doctor, Jewish doctor from Warsaw here on \u2014 for vacation. So he\nsays, go over to him. And I went to him. He said, who the hell punctured those\nthings? They didn\u2019t know what they were doing. You cannot \u2014 he\u2019s getting\ngangrene here, and under the arms already, gangrene is starting. So he gave some\nmedications and there\u2019s heat over here, bottles, we got water and everything lined,\nand I have to keep my hands and legs up. And this lasted for several weeks, you\nknow. So I constantly had something. Either I had appendicitis, or I had that. I had\nthis boil in my ear, I had boil in my throat too, you know. And I \u2014 tha-that was a lot\nof trouble, so I wouldn\u2019t go almost anywhere. My sister used to go, but they kept\nme more or less at home.

Polish were 1n coal mines, and he bought\nhimself a farm and he married a young girl. And he bought his son very nice skis.\nAnd this fellow [indecipherable] he went and he stole his skis. And this man came\nto get the skis back. And his father was beating th \u2014 him with the belt like hell. And\nwe go out from the house, and I said, why did your father beat you so much,\nbecause you stole? No, no, no, that I don\u2019t know how to steal, that\u2019s why he was\nbeating me. So you see, my mother didn\u2019t want me to play \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 but we used to go to the river. There was a river maybe a kilometer away from\nthere, there were a lot of snakes in there, you had to wear boots. And we used to go\nfishing there, and I used to catch little fish, and eat them. Oh, I loved fried little\nfish, you know. I \u2014 [| all re \u2014 all remember that, 1t was so nice.

And when I came back to school, this fellow say, did I have a ride in a \u2014\nla carrozza(ph), you know, and everything. Then, I tell you, they came, poor\nchildren, Polish boys. There was a scout camp for small Polish boys, and ah \u2014 there\nmust have been about a hundred of them, and they came to us to get straw, so they\ncould make shiniki(ph), you know, to sleep, and what they would \u2014 can give them\nsome food.

        "Q: Oh yeah, mm-hm.",
        "A: And they were from there, the Polish. But they were big scouts, and they made\nthe big campfire. They were staying with one parish, where the priest had the thing.\nAnd we went over there. Then they tried to kidnap us, but we defended. But then\nall those boys said, we want to make campfire big too. And I said, well let\u2019s go. We\nwere across from my grandfather\u2019s f-forest. So I said, come on kids, let\u2019s go and \u2014\nwith me, and they all went, which was private property.

        "A: I don\u2019t know. I just realized the Russians came to our property. They asked for a\ngun, my father had a ra \u2014 gun, and when he walked out the Russians got scared\nbecause he was carrying the [indecipherable] to give it to them. Because they\nwould have taken us to Siberia if they found weapons, you know. And it \u2014 and I\nrealized that now 1s the end of that life. I \u2014 I realized it completely. And then later,\nwhen we were being taken, which I told you before \u2014",
        "Q: But we were gonna talk about it again.",
        "A: Yeah, you will talk about, but you see, this was the realization. Remember, I\nwas 13 years old, I was small and everything, and all of a sudden I realized that\neverything\u2019s gone. It\u2019s not mine \u2014 where \u2014 where they take the land away from\nyou. They left us, I think, with 30 acres or something like that, a small field. I\u2014 my\nfather lost his hand, I had to do the plowing, I had to do the sowing, I had to ca \u2014\nJune 20, 2014\nthey say, cut, you know. I had to feed the cows, my sister was milking the cows.\nWe couldn\u2019t have workers, our workers actually were bandits it turned out. There\nwere seven sons and we had the family, and when their \u2014 it broke out, they went \u2014\nthere were a lot of bandits there, because there was no Polish police, there was no\nRussian police, and people started robbing. And they \u2014 I played with the boy, there\nwas one, he was the youngest son over there in that family. And his brother was\ncleaning his gun and he shot through a wall and ripped out the stomach of that boy,\nand that boy died. And they took him to Felcher(ph), you know, the closest help,\nbut there was nothing that can be done. I remember that boy died. So you know, all\nof a sudden, things started going all wrong, you know, all wrong.",
        "Q: Did you da \u2014 when the Russians came, had there been, even before that, was\nthere any talk of \u2014 of what was going on in Europe and what was Poland going to\ndo, and \u2014",
        "A: Oh, my family, of course, they were talking all the time, a-all the time.",
        "Q: What kind of talks was it? What kind of things were being discussed?",
        "A: Well, we heard Hitler screaming on the radio all the time, you know, when he\nwas shouting and everything. And wi \u2014 Russia we knew, we were afraid of Russia\nbecause we had a lot of local communists. There were Polish communists, there\nwere Jewish communists, you know, over there, a lot of \u2014 I mean, Jews were\nJune 20, 2014\ncommunists, a lot of Poles were communists. Some people had all of sudden\nmoney, and you knew that it must be coming from Russia, because Russia was\nexporting car loads, I understand of gold for propaganda and everything. So you\nheard about it. There was police trouble, my mother went to governor\n[indecipherable] he later became president of \u2014 of Poland in London, and he told\nme well, it\u2019s probably a [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know how \u2014 what you say\n[indecipherable] that at police station we consider very suspicious that they are\npro-Bolshevik, you know, but we cannot do anything to them, we have to prove it,\nyou know.",
        "Q: Well, what was \u2014 what was the incident that brought your mother to go to him?\nWhat happened that she wanted to go \u2014",
        "A: Well, you had trouble, I don\u2019t know, like was some friction you know, in \u2014 in\neverything. You n\u2014 you know th-this is what, if you could like, Jewish people used\nto come from Warsaw for vacation, like that doctor. They were stupid, they,\ninstead of talking to a peasant, with a little store or something, a prusha(ph)\npanna(ph), you know, and something like this, they s \u2014 they used to say gtupi, like\nstupid, to them. Eventually they started pulling knives out, you know, because they\ngot insulted. It\u2019s the same thing the way the British treated people in Africa, you\nknow, they were calling them, hey boy do this, hey boy, do that. It\u2019s the same\nJune 20, 2014\nthing, you know. And you don\u2019t do it to people. You have to treat everybody with\nrespect. That\u2019s what I was told by my parents, that you treat everybody with\nrespect, never give them a reason, you know, to be mean to you.",
        "Q: So, when this changed, did you understand? I mean, there was \u2014 1t was \u2014 you\nwere hearing Hitler screaming, but it was the Russians who were coming in. Why\u201d?",
        "A: Well [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did you know about it at the time?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think we knew. We \u2014 we knew later what happened, but I don\u2019t\nknow why Hitler was afraid to allow \u2014 to a-attack Poland alone. While Pilsudski\nwas alive, we knew he wouldn\u2019t do it. When Pilsudski died, they said, well, Hitler\nis not scared of Pilsudski any more. He \u2014 he had a mental block because he beat\nthe hell out of them, too, out of the Germans. So we knew that there was bad, but\nwe didn\u2019t know about \u2014 there was talk, and there was strange \u2014",
        "Q: Who was pa \u2014 let\u2019s say \u2014 tell us, who was Pilsudski?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: Who was Pilsudski?",
        "A: Pilsudski was the Marshall of Poland.",
        "Q: And he died when?\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: H-He died in, what was it, \u00b036 - \u00b037 he died. And I remember we didn\u2019t like him\ntoo much, we didn\u2019t like his politics, but they said now is big trouble because he \u2014\nwe \u2014 they knew that Hitler had his \u2014 you know superstitious or something, and\nthen he \u2014 I si\u2014 I know now, you know, Litvinov was thrown out because he was\nJewish, and they put Molotov and \u2014 Molotov and Ribbentrop decided to attack\ntogether. So first the Germans attacked, then the Russians. But you see, you hear\nabout Poland so much, but you don\u2019t realize that after the campaign, Hitler in\nPoland, for almost for a year he had to regroup his armies and everything, and then\nhe went after England, Belgium and everything. He almost didn\u2019t make war. He\ncouldn\u2019t attack anybody. They say his losses in Poland were tremendous.",
        "Q: Truly?",
        "A: Because Poland had anti-tank weapon, and we wanted to make call \u2014 call in,\nyou know, reserves all. And England and France said don\u2019t do it, because it will\nprovoke Hitler, so then don\u2019t do it. So its mobilization started two days before\nHitler attacked. And Hitler attacked accusing Poland that Polish troops went and\nattacked the radio station in Germany, and that\u2019s what he told the Germans, that he\nsends the army over there, and they came. But they couldn\u2019t even distribute the\nweapon, because Poland had something like a bazooka to destroy tank, and it was\nthere, where they found it, Germany suffered tremendous losses, because those\nJune 20, 2014\ntanks weren\u2019t good, they had to start redesigning the tanks, because they were\ndestroying them. But \u2014",
        "Q: So Germany was attacking from the west.",
        "A: The west.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and \u2014",
        "A: And about two weeks later, Russia came from the east. And Russia came, I\u2019m\ntelling you, they had strings on their horses. They came with the tanks that \u2014 with\nthe lamp post and the tank would burn, but they kept coming and coming and\ncoming. There were so many Russians that came over. I\u2019Il tell you something\nbetter. To Patesha(ph), to my grandfather\u2019s house, some Russian soldiers came\nover and they said [speaks foreign language here] Pani(ph), you know, when are\nyou going to come back? They were from that region over there, and they \u2014",
        "Q: From where your mother was born?",
        "A: From where my mother, and they came over there and they were asking\nPani(ph), when are wa \u2014 when are you going to come back, Pani(ph)?",
        "Q: And that\u2019s a\u2014a ti\u2014a term of respect.",
        "A: And those were Russians soldiers.",
        "Q: Yes, a term of respect saying, when are you going to come back and \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. Never over there \u2014\nJune 20, 2014",
        "Q: Back to Belarus.",
        "A: \u2014 because they were better off. They were living better off there. Russia was\nsomething \u2014 because they didn\u2019t know about the west, you know. K-Karl Marx\nand Lenin and Trotsky, they all promise people everything. They said we will be\nparadise. And when you live in Siberia, in the remote areas, I told you, those\npeople didn\u2019t know anything.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t know, they thought \u2014 Francesca has a brother-in-law, a Russian\nfrom Crimea, he married. And he says, wa \u2014 we lived there, but we didn\u2019t see\nanything better. We thought everybody lives like that.",
        "Q: Okay. So, you see the soldiers come in, you see that your father has to give a\ngun up, the one weapon, and you realize that your family, your parents cannot\nprotect you any more. Did they ever have conversations with you about what all\nthis meant, about what all these si \u2014 all these political things?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, we probably had, but I cannot tell you. Then Stalin gave Wilno to\nLithuanians, and we were in Lithuanian region. So I was living in grandmother\u2019s\nhouse in Wilno, and I was going to gymnasium. So \u2014",
        "Q: So that\u2019s in the center of town?",
        "A: So that was a very good period for us again, you see? Very good period.\nJune 20, 2014",
        "Q: How did it change? How did life change when it \u2014",
        "A: Well, it was normal.",
        "Q: Okay, normal.",
        "A: It was normal life, except you didn\u2019t want to get in the mess somewhere with\n[indecipherable] who hated Poles, if you came in somewhere, and there was\nsomebody living, and somebody else was living, they said [speaks foreign\nlanguage here] Polish pigs don\u2019t live here. Siaulisi(ph). They were Lithuanian, but\nthey had hated li-like [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Siaulisi(ph) were they like \u2014",
        "A: Siauliai.",
        "Q: Okay, were th \u2014 who \u2014 can you explain who they were, these Siaulisi(ph)?",
        "A: I\u2014I cannot tell you, it was a party of people, Lithuanian, you know, it was a\nparty. They were against Poles, against everything. They used to come in even to\nthe cathedral to beat up the people when they were singing \u2014",
        "Q: Hymns.",
        "A: [indecipherable] return Poland to us, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It was trouble, but otherwise it was all right. Police was fantastic. We had a\u2014 wa\n\u2014 carriage stolen before the war, and Lithuanians, when they came, policeman\nJune 20, 2014\ncame and he told us that \u2014 and my father told them, you know, they were asking,\nanything stolen? Yeah, my father said, before the war. In about two weeks, they\nhad it. They took my father there and they said, here is your carriage. One day we\nwoke up and we had about 60 or 70 chickens, you know\u201d?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And we come in and there are no chickens, everything was stolen. By evening,\nLithuanian police had it. They were very effective, and they were very effective\nwith thieves, because they got scared, because the Lithuanian police used to put\nwet sheets and beat the hell out of the people. And they said, you know, across the\nkidneys and everything. So they found out that stealing doesn\u2019t pay. And the Polish\nrule is like in America you do. When \u2014 when the \u2014 and you know how it 1s with\nstealing; if you steal a loaf of bread, you\u2019re a thief. If you steal a million dollars,\nwell, you defrauded somebody. But if you steal 10 million dollars, or 20 million, ah\nkleptomania, he\u2019s sick. Tha-That\u2019s the law in America, you don\u2019t go to jail. Let\nstockholders pay, like in America.",
        "Q: Yeah. So \u2014",
        "A: I \u2014 that is unbelievable. And then, you know, this came and then there \u2014 the\nperiod went very fast. We had that thing in Wilno then, the [indecipherable]\nKiersnowski, that was mine [indecipherable] he came first and he opened a\nJune 20, 2014\nnightclub, who \u2014 called [indecipherable]. So there was freedom, you know. And\nthen his wife [indecipherable] cross, in the winter she got very hard time crossing\nthe river. They came over and they said \u2014",
        "Q: They came from where?",
        "A: From Warsaw.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And oh, what\u2019s her name? Oh God, I was thinking, oh well, the famous Polish,\nthis girl singer. She was Jewish. She married Count Iscaris(ph) and he, my cousin\nwas writing songs for her, you know, for the show and everything, so it was very\nsuccessful. And then I don\u2019t know how they got permission to go to Vladivostok,\nto Japan. She had connections with gemeinde. And then I met her father finally, in\nAmerica when they came here in the show. They were \u2014 all the Jews in New York\nwere there, writing in that show. It was itwee \u2014 and it was \u2014 it was good life 0 \u2014 at\nthat period, and then all of a sudden, I remember they came, and they arrested us,\nand we were taking, and people were kneeling down along the road, and praying\nfor us \u2014",
        "Q: Who 1s they?",
        "A: \u2014 when they saw us being taken in a carriage, you know?",
        "Q: Who came, who took you?\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: Polish people, the rus \u2014 well, there was one Jewish NKVD officer, a Polish\ncommunist and two Russian soldiers. And they came early in the morning, they\nknocked on the doors, you know, and th \u2014 and they told us to pack. But I told you\nabout my sister before, my sister was packed, because she had dreams that the man\ncomes here to prepare your things, you\u2019re going to go for a long trip. She already\nhad that thing that happened in Russia with her, but she was packed. And then th-\nthey \u2014 th-they took us to \u2014 to the station, and in Charnibor(ph), my mother\u2019s sister\ncame with her husband and two daughters, and they brought our grandmother, and\nshe was an old, old woman. She had a broken hip, and he \u2014 we begged the Russians\nnot to take them, and they finally let her stay in Poland. And \u2014 and Korfs(ph) were\nthere, and then \u2014",
        "Q: What was there?",
        "A: Korf(ph) too, Baron Korf(ph) was there too, brought in there. And then they\nput us in trucks and they took us to Nowa Vileka(ph) and in Nowa Vileka(ph) they\nseparated the men. My father got what, 10 years or 12 years they told him in gulag,\nand \u2014 and \u2014 and they got it, and we never saw them again. Well, I know that my\nfather died, I have everything. The other ones were thrown out from the railroad,\nbecause they were on the railroads when they die in cars, so they just opened the\ndoor and they threw the bodies into the tundra somewhere, I don\u2019t know.\nJune 20, 2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s after it\u2019s all left \u2014 after \u2014",
        "A: [indecipherable] yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. So at that point when you\u2019re at Nowa Vileka(ph), and from what I\nunderstand, that is a train station in a small suburb of Wilno, isn\u2019t it? Nowa\nVileka(ph) is a \u2014",
        "A: Nowa Vileka(ph), I cannot tell you.",
        "Q: Is a small village.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that \u2014 well it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a railroad station.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It\u2019s small. It\u2019s a small thing, but there were trains over there, and that\u2019s where\nthey took us, not to Wilno, but to Nowa Vileka(ph), in the trucks, and that\u2019s where\nthey separated, and that was the place where my father told me, when they were\ntaking him away, Stasch(ph), I am not going to survive Russia, I\u2019m going to die.\nFrom now on, you\u2019re responsible for your mother and sister, promise me that. You\ntake care, you survive Russia. I will not survive. And his last words were, when I\nwas \u2014 I told you [speaks Polish], remember, Russia doesn\u2019t like tears. Don\u2019t ever,\never show a Russian that you\u2019re afraid. And he was so right, later on in life I found\nout, because when they arrested me I told them, what the hell can you do to me? I\nsaid, you took my father away, you took me to Siberia, we\u2019re hungry, we have no\nJune 20, 2014\nheat, we have nothing. What do you do? I told the NK VD officer, just take and\nshoot me if you want. He says, go home. And they had me for stealing, you know,\nand the other two went to jail.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll come to that incident, we\u2019Il come to that incident. So the last time you see\nyour father is at this Nowa Vileka(ph) train station.",
        "A: That\u2019s was \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether it was 14 or 15, I think it was 14 or 15 \u2014",
        "Q: Of what?",
        "A: \u2014 of June.",
        "Q: Of June, in 1941.",
        "A: Seven-Seventy-three years ago.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: We were locked up a day \u2014 the train was a small car. There were \u2014 this was a\nsmall cattle train. There were four little windows about this size, you know, and\nthey put boards two layers of boards like this, on one side and on the other side. So\nwe were lying, but you had to lie on the side, because you couldn\u2019t lie on your\nback, there was no room. And sitting was a disaster. And they cut a little hole in the\nJune 20, 2014\nfloor for you to go and relieve yourself, as a toilet. But somehow, the people had\nsome blankets, so they put some strings around and they put blanket around, so you\nhad privacy. Only twice they allowed us to \u2014 off the train, for in three weeks that\nwe were going. Let me tell you, you \u2014 you never \u2014 you never know the stor \u2014 the\nsight of people, who when after weeks of sitting, lock, and not being able to walk,\nget out. Everybody had to go to the bathroom immediately. And everybody\nsquatted, nobody cared where; women, men, everybody squatted and \u2014 a-a-and that\nwas the life.",
        "Q: It sounds awful. What was it li \u2014 yeah, I interrupted you as you were saying\npeople, as you were being taken, were kneeling on the street, you know, kneeling\non the road as you were being arrested.",
        "A: Who \u2014 wha \u2014",
        "Q: You said people were kneeling on the road.",
        "A: Yeah, and praying for us, in \u2014 1-in [indecipherable]. They were praying for us,\nthere was, you know, they were \u2014 all knew what\u2019s happening to us. You know,\ndeportation to Siberia was known for a long time with the tsars and everything. So\nthey knew that they want us exterminated over there, and then they\u2019Il probably\nnever see us again.",
        "Q: And that would be because you were rich, or because you were Polish?\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: Yeah, Polish, rich, there were some Jews taken too. There were some Jews not\ntaken. In this car where we were, there was one Jewish nurse. I don\u2019t know, she\nwas very nice girl, and maybe she saved my life, I\u2019ll tell you, because I got mumps,\nand Russian doctor, they open the door, and they gave me in a glass \u2014 I don\u2019t know,\nit was enclosed glass here, there was medication. And they \u2014 he told us to give\nookoe(ph) give me an injection, and they closed the door and he walked out. And\nshe was a hospital nurse and she says, I have syringe. So she brought it, she took it\nand she gave me injection for that, you know. Whether it help or not, I don\u2019t know.\nMaybe I would have been all right. But she was \u2014 she was the only Jewish person\nin our car, you know. And goo \u2014 who knows ho-ho \u2014 who they took? They took\nprostitutes too. They took prostitutes too, they later had problem with them in\nIndia and everywhere. Women, you know, you can\u2019t tell what the hell they were\ndoing, they were all crazy. They wanted to take all the people who had property,\ndestroy them, but they also want to destroy everybody else. It\u2019s madness. This\nworld is mad. Every day, the older I get, the more I see it. I told after the second\nWorld War that somehow it will stabilize. Look what\u2019s going on now.",
        "Q: When you were in that tra \u2014 did you stay in the train station for a long time, or\ndid the trains move out immediately?",
        "A: I cannot tell you, I don\u2019t remember, you know.\nJune 20, 2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We went, and we started going, and I \u2014 I didn\u2019t know geography that well, but\nthe Polish people, they\u2019re older, they knew the railroad station that we were going.\nAnd once a day or \u2014 or something, they used to open the door and they took four\nmen with buckets to bring in some food, and they used to give us bread. But that\nbread was so bad that if you threw it against the wall 1t would stick to the wall. It\nwas like thing \u2014 w-we \u2014 we took some food with us from Poland, thank God, you\nknow, we had some \u2014 well, little food, and \u2014 but then, along the railroads, the\nRussians were standing, begging for food. What did they expect? People that are\nbeing deported to Russia, they were still standing with their hands outstretched,\nmany station. And they had Russian soldiers, and we didn\u2019t have enough water, it\nwas hot. And I was asking Russians \u2014 soldiers, you know [indecipherable] kettle. I\nused to open the win \u2014 this \u2014 the window was open and I used to \u2014 and you \u2014 there\nwere two Russians, I told you that before, a-a \u2014 on the side, they wouldn\u2019t give me\nthe water. But the minute there was only one Russian soldier on that side of the\ntrain, he would grab the kettle, run and bring me water. They were so petrified of\neach other, that they were afraid to \u2014 to \u2014 to give us anything.",
        "Q: But \u2014 but it also shows that \u2014 that once they \u2014 once that fear is \u2014",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: People be-become human. We had a friend there, and he was German, he was a\ntank officer, and he lived, and he was with the Korfs and with [indecipherable]\nyou know, families connected. And he was so nice, and then just before the war he\ngot an order to return to Germany, to his unit. So we knew that something was\ncooking, you know, we were expecting that something will happen. And he was\ncrying, he didn\u2019t want to go to Germany. And then, after the war, they learned that\nhe was killed in the last day of the wars, when Berlin fell, he was killed\n[indecipherable] I remember; tall, blonde, handsome fellow, and he was there.\nYou remember people you know, you remember so many people, and \u2014 because\nyou were meeting so many people. But you have to remember, I was 13 - 14, and\nwhat did I know, you know, I didn\u2019t know much, except that I helped quite a lot as\na child, at the parties, at meetings. My uncle was a senator, you know, so I heard a\nlot about politics always, and my grandfather was involved in parties, you know,\npolitical parties and everything. So we heard a lot of what was going on.",
        "Q: Tell me, why did your family not particularly like Pilsudski\u2019s politics? It\u2019s just\nan interesting \u2014\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t tell you.",
        "Q: You wouldn\u2019t know why.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t tell you. I think one of the thing was that he once blew a train and\nsold the money. Or da \u2014 it was Russian money, or Austrian money, I don\u2019t know,\nbut the family was talking that that\u2019s stealing. That that\u2019s im-improper, you cannot\nsteal. You know, I \u2014 they were talking about it. Pilsudski had a very hard life\nbecause his sister used to come and sit in my grandfather\u2019s house. On the deck\nthere were flowers. Oh, it was so beautiful over there, You cannot imagine how\nmany flowers, agave, you know, was growing, and everything. Palms, little. And\nsh-she was talking and she was saying that you know, when you are in the\ngovernment like my brother is, they print special papers for him. He cannot even\nget the news. I can tell you what\u2019s going on in the country, but they \u2014 other groups,\nyou know, they surround you. They are like plague, you don\u2019t know. You have\nadvisors, I guess in every government it\u2019s the same thing, you know, they \u2014 th-they\n\u2014 they \u2014 they do everything. But she was saying that it\u2019s a famous building in\nWarsaw, dom bez kantow. Kant means a corner, but 1t also means without\ncheating. So they said when they were building this building, they came to\nPilsudski and said, well, build one building bez kantow. Build one building\nwithout cheating, you know. And they cut off the corner, it\u2019s said to this day you\nJune 20, 2014\ncan go on computer and you write dom bez kantow and they show it in Warsaw,\nthe home. And this became famous dom bez kantow. So you know, it\u2019s not easy to\nbe a ruler.",
        "Q: No, no.",
        "A: Because you don\u2019t know what influences you, or what goes on. I tell you, the\nRussian people that we met, a lot of them were very, very nice, you know\u201d? But\nwhen we went south in Siberia, there were Mongols, but over there it became\nmuch worse, because the people were hungry already.",
        "Q: We\u2019re gonna get to that part. I still want to be on the train right now. So when\nyou were on the train, did you ever get any announcement, or any paper, or\nanything from those people who arrested you, as to why you were being deported\nand where you were being taken?",
        "A: No, no, they didn\u2019t talk to us.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t know. In other words, people knew the \u2014",
        "A: Oh, we knew why, because the tsars used to do it. They \u2014 once you go to\nSiberia you saw all kinds of people, Germans, Ukrainians, they used to call\n[indecipherable], T'artars from Crimea they were deporting over there. They were\ndeporting people for years. This is one procedure in Russia, take people and send\nthem to Siberia, it\u2019s empty. You know, you were going for days on, and you hardly\nJune 20, 2014\nsaw a little station, where they only had water and maybe some coal for the\nrailroad, and the train. It was a \u2014 it\u2019s like ano man\u2019s land, you go and go and\nthere\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s a disaster. And then, in some places they build like\n[indecipherable] the soil was very good, you know. But this was funny. I\u2019Il tell\nyou something; we were there, I never saw a rabbit, I never saw a fox, I never saw\nany animal alive or dead. Whether they ate them when they were starving, when\nthere was starvation in the [indecipherable] you know, or \u2014 or what, I don\u2019t know.\nBecause I was fr \u2014 with a friend Fruzhinski(ph) later in India and he was working\nin sulfur mine and there was a lot of gold. And the mine, being broken, pressed his\nchest in. He couldn\u2019t be 1n the army, you know, he had a hole \u2014 hole in there. And\nhe said that that mine, all the Russians were laughing because Americans came in\nthe 30s, engineers, and they developed that mine. And he said, how stupid\nAmericans are. Don\u2019t \u2014 Russians were saying, don\u2019t they know how secretive\nRussians are? Of course they had an accident and they buried them over there.\nOnce the mine was open [indecipherable] America the worst place in Russia,\ngold mine, and the worst concentration camp, where if you lasted two years you\nwere lucky, they \u2014 you froze, it\u2019s na \u2014 close to Alaska. That was be \u2014 opened up\nwith American help. How about [indecipherable], the city Volga(ph)? Volga(ph)\nwas built by all this \u2014 a fort. So you know, America did all the business they could,\nJune 20, 2014\nand they say Russia was starving its people, selling its food and trying to get\nmachinery and everything from America. And America did business with them,\ncapitalists, what do they care? They don\u2019t care whether hundred million people\ndied. To hell, as long as I make my million, that\u2019s my opinion. I don\u2019t know\nwhether I should say that, but as long as you can make money, it\u2019s all right. You\nsee, brokerage houses, when I started, were private companies, they were\npartnership. And if they were doing business, they were very, very afraid. If they\nmade something wrong, it was their pocket. And then they allowed them to become\ncorporation. So now people who run corporation can steal, make themselves rich,\nand if they get punish, who pays the stockholder? The stockholders are punished,\nand they lose the money.",
        "Q: Different system.",
        "A: Ju-Ju-Just look at American history now. They make a mistake\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yeah. Where did you finally land? When you, you know, went for three weeks\non the train \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 where did it stop?\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s first \u2014 the big station was, when we stopped, Nowosibirsk. It\u2019s right\nin the middle of Siberia, I think, it [indecipherable]. Then they turned south, to\nBarnaul, and then we went to Rubtsovsk. Gorbachev\u2019s wife was born over there\nin Rubtsovsk.",
        "Q: Raisa, uh-huh.",
        "A: And then from there we went by carriage to the village where we were. And as I\ntold you, we were very lucky that we were not sent to collective farm, or some\nmine, or bri \u2014 bricklayers place where they make. But we were in a village. The\npeople were very nice to us. The NK VD didn\u2019t bother us. The only thing the\nbastards did to us, they came to our house, and my sister hid everything in the\nstove, in ashes; pictures that we had, and papers. And my aunt was afraid, and \u2014 my\nmother\u2019s sister, she was stupid, she told them about it and they took all our pictures\nof my father, of the youth, you know, we had a lot of pictures from Poland, album.\nAnd they took everywhere, and they took all the coffee books. We had those coffee\nbook with watermarks. When they saw watermark, ration NK VD, they never saw\nit, they say [speaks foreign language here] we\u2019re German spies, right away they\nsaid, because you have watermarks on paper. So they think this is for sending\nmessages. They never saw anything like this. They were very poor. You know,\nwhen Russians march into Poland we used to ask them, oranges [indecipherable]\nJune 20, 2014\noranges? And they said, oh yeah, we have factories, they make them. That was the\nstandard answer. They didn\u2019t know what it was. Because I never saw sugar in\nRussia once. No, I saw one Russian woman \u2014 officer, having a piece of sugar, she\nwas eating it with water. But that was the only time I saw sugar. I never saw sugar\nin Russia. So it was \u2014 1t was in \u2014 inhuman land, it was inhuman country, and I\nthink it is to this day. They said [indecipherable] there was Radio Moscow here, I\nwas listening and they were talking, men all drinking, smoking. Trains you cannot\ntravel. There are no roads to drive on, you know. And that was \u2014 that report is from\nMoscow saying. You know, that \u2014 it was \u2014 it was bad.",
        "Q: When you were \u2014 when you were first taken to Nowosibirsk, then you were\ndiverted by train to Barnaul is that it?",
        "A: Yeah, it was same train there, and \u2014",
        "Q: The same train?",
        "A: \u2014 I tell you, I was petrified when I saw Nowosibirsk. I never saw such a\ntremendous station, and there were loudspeakers talking all the time and\neverything. And I never saw anything so big, it was tremendous. And then they\nturned around, and we went south, you know, to Barnaul. Then I saw much more\nof southern Russia when we were released already.\nJune 20, 2014",
        "Q: Oh, we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll get there, we\u2019ll get there. So in Barnaul then you\u2019re \u2014 the\nsame train goes to \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, all the way. It was the same train all the way.",
        "Q: To ruda \u2014 what was it called?",
        "A: Wait \u2014 wait. Nowosibirsk, Barnaul. Rubtsovsk.",
        "Q: Rubtsovsk.",
        "A: Rubtsovsk.",
        "Q: And then you said you were taken by car from Rubtsovsk?",
        "A: Not by car, by carriage, horse carriage. There was a little carriage, you know \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 like you saw them in Lithuania with \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 the horse, and we had to walk most of the way because our suitcases were\nthere. It was \u2014 I don\u2019t know, it was 30 - 40 [indecipherable] what is it, miles? I\ndon\u2019t know, it was pretty far a whole day. And we came to that village, and si \u2014\nthere was an empty house with two rooms. There was \u2014 in one room there was a\nstove, and there was a little like place where they did something, so there was wood\non building. So we used to take that wood and burn in the stove. You cou \u2014 were\nnot allowed to go to forest and bring any forest, because this is government. I told\nJune 20, 2014\nyou how, one time I went to pick up szyszki \u2014 how do you call it? From pine trees,\nyou know, corns.",
        "Q: Yeah, the cones.",
        "A: And we were \u2014 we were using them \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, you were using \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 from \u2014 [phone ringing]",
        "Q: Okay, cut. [tape break] Yes, all right, so you were saying, you went in the\nforest and you got these pine cones.",
        "A: Yeah. And the Russians, they all ran away, and I didn\u2019t run away. And the f-\nforest man comes, and he said kudova(ph), from where you are? And I said, I\u2019m\nfrom Poland, you know ya polak(ph). And he says, why didn\u2019t you run away, to\nme, you know, [speaks foreign language] Because you were stealing government\npines, and you cannot steal government pines. And if you \u2014 next time, you run,\nbecause otherwise I\u2019Il go to jail for not arresting you. The Russians were all\nrunning away, and he told me, you have to run. And then he says [speaks foreign\nlanguage] I \u2014 also, you\u2019re from Poland, let\u2019s sit down and talk. Wha \u2014 what\u2019s \u2014\nhow life is in Poland, tell me. They were so curious that you [indecipherable]\nthere was nobody around us, you know \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: \u2014 but he pleaded with me, next time if you come to take the pines \u2014",
        "Q: Pine cones.",
        "A: \u2014 take the pines, but run like a crazy when I come, because they\u2019 ll arrest me, and\nPll go to jail. Then I told you about kerosene.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I went \u2014 well, no, I have to start that a little different story. This is another story.\nWhen the Russian woman with the daughter came to us already in that little house,\nand she ask whether my sister has any dresses to sell because the daughter is\ngetting married, and she would like to have a nice dress.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And my sister says, well, I can sell you one dress. And \u2014 and the girl was there,\nyou know, they measured my sister. Okay, I'll re-sew it a little, I'll correct it for\nyou. And she \u2014 the minute she left, neighbors of ours in those buildings came and\nsaid, watch out. He is the chief communist for the whole area. Top communist,\nthat\u2019s his wife. Be very careful what you do with them. They are big communists.\nAnd then she came few days later, she picked up the dress and she took my mother\nand sister to their house. And listen the story about their house. They walk in, they\nhad bars on the doors and on the windows, they were so afraid. And he told my\nmother, my family, before the revolution was fairly well-off. And I decided that I\nJune 20, 2014\nwon\u2019t raise my family in poverty. So I joined the party and I became a communist\nand I am the head of this district. And he was very nice, and he said look, probably\nthe Germans will come here. We \u2014 we won\u2019t be able to withstand their \u2014 Russian \u2014\na-a-a \u2014 the German army. And, can you protect us from Germans? And my mother\nsaid well, if Germans come here, they might shoot me first and then you.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, as a communist. And \u2014 my mother said no. And then he ask what\nI\u2019m doing, you know, and his son was working in a place where there were\nrepairing metal [indecipherable] tractors, combines and everything. And he was\nbringing water. So when his son went to school, they gave me that job. And once a\nday you got food over there, so you know, what a privilege it was in that place.\nAnd we didn\u2019t have kerosene for lamp. And I came to him once, he was sitting \u2014 he\nwas the manager of the whole place, and I said to him [speaks foreign language\nhere] because in Russian it\u2019s kerosene, too, and I made mistake, 1n Polish we say\nnafta(ph), in Russian \u2014 so he said [speaks foreign language] Well, and he told me\nthat I cannot give it to you. This is government. I'll go and get arrested. Then he\nsays, quiet, but over there there is a woman which [indecipherable] some\nequipment. You go to her with the bottle where nobody sees, and she will give you\nkerosene in a bottle. But don\u2019t let anybody see it, and run away quickly, and you\nJune 20, 2014\nwill have kerosene for the lamp at home. And then he locked the door, and he says,\nwhere were you li\u2014 where were you living? And well, we\u2019re deported here, and he\nstarted talking with me, and he was the guy who told me he couldn\u2019t believe that\nwe had farms, that we had property. Nobody has property. And then we tell him to\nAmerica and he says, can you amer \u2014 can you imagine those strikes in America?\nPeople rather die than work in America. They go on strike, because see in Russia,\nif you went on a strike, they would have killed you. So here was \u2014 they were\nreading in America \u2014 in their Russian papers about the strikes in America. That\u2019s\nhow they were interpreting, that those people were so poor that they\u2019d rather die.",
        "Q: Yeah, they\u2019d rather die.",
        "A: Because in Russia there were too main newspapers. I think I told you there was\nPravda [indecipherable]. Pravda is the truth, [indecipherable] is news. And the\nRussians were saying the problem with our papers is that in truth there is no news,\nand in the news there is no truth. That\u2019s what the Russians were saying. They were\nlaughing, but they didn\u2019t know. They just didn\u2019t know anything.",
        "Q: When you got there, did they put your mother and your sister to work?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: What did they have to do?\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: Well, first we were digging cellars, and we were very nice. Every time we took\na shower \u2014 and me too \u2014 and every time we threw a shower we said, hundred\nRussians on the German front, you know, and \u2014 and the \u2014 and \u2014 a-and then they\nswitched us to forests, and to work in the forest. And there were \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nwhere the other Poles came, you know, they were engineers and everything. They\nhad no idea how to cut the tree down. I had to teach them, because I grew up on a\nfarm and I saw how \u2014 how workers were cutting the tree, and which way the tree\nfalls and every \u2014 they had no idea. I had to teach them, you know, I used to walk\naround, big \u2014 big guy, I had big shoes. I had big shoes because Germans shot up a\ntrain not far from our home, and the next thing we had [indecipherable] soldiers\nwore big shoes, and their shoes were long. And oh God, in Russia, when I had the\nax, I hit it, the shoe, I thought I cut off my fingers \u2014 my toes, but the shoe was\nmuch too large, so I didn\u2019t cut off my legs. But I thought \u2014 was afraid that I cut off.\nThey had very good steel. Oh, the steel was fantastic, the axes and everything. You\nsee, we had to make so many two yards long, like \u2014 like two meters long, maybe\nmeter wide, like this, and maybe a meter high. Wood, we had to cut it in pieces,\nand put it. And every day we had to \u2014 we had a norm, how many we had to do. So,\nwe figured very fast way, cut wood in small pieces, and on the ends we put small\nJune 20, 2014\npieces, then everything is empty inside, and we cover with the logs on top, and the\nRussian \u2014",
        "Q: And there\u2019s the norm.",
        "A: \u2014 and the Russian was wondering that we could make a couple of norms in a\nday in this way. But we were cheating. And they came, they counted and they went\nand they were happy. And there was plenty of [indecipherable] cucumber woman,\nshe was always bringing us cucumbers to eat, you know, she had cucumbers. And\npeople were very nice, they were trying to help us. And \u2014",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t \u2014 there wasn\u2019t anybody that you experienced who \u2014 who was\ncruel, or \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: \u2014 or was tough, or was \u2014",
        "A: Absolutely no, no.",
        "Q: Okay. Were you hungry\u201d?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: Were you hungry?",
        "A: Not there. Not there.",
        "Q: Okay.\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: Well, I told you about my sister, she came over there and she started telling\nfortune. And the next thing, the Russians were coming from all sides. One thing \u2014\nyou know, I was laughing always at it. You know, I was small, to me it was funny.\nBut she used to lay cards and look at them, and she said, I don\u2019t see cards, I see\nsomething else. And one time there was a woman that came over and she said that\nher husband is in jail, and do you know when he will come out and everything?\nAnd my sister told him \u2014 and there were other Russian women \u2014 my sister said,\nvrosh(ph), you lie. Why? You husband is a pilot. And she says no, no, he\u2019s in jail,\nI\u2019m telling you. She says no, he\u2019s a pilot. One day he\u2019s here in Russia and one day\nhe\u2019s over there. He must be a pilot, he\u2019s all over Russia. She says yeah, he\u2019s a\npilot. You know? There was this other case that a Russian woman run into our\nhouse, this little house that we had. She opened the window and she went ptoo,\nptoo, ptoo, you know, and she ran out, closed the door and ran out. And few weeks\nlater my sister got an abscess in her throat. And she \u2014 they took her to hospital, they\ngave her tubes, they fed her through the tubes. And she came back after a couple of\nweeks. And then again, same thing happened. And then this old Russian woman\ncame, and she says Ganichka(ph) she says, doctors won\u2019t cure you, this is Siberian\ncurse fell on you. These doctors don\u2019t know how to remove it. I will remove it and\nit will go away, don\u2019t worry. And my sister was to go again to the hospital, because\nJune 20, 2014\nthe abscess is started. And she says, well you are Catholic, maybe you don\u2019t want\nit. So she took linen piece of cloth, she put some ashes into it, and dipped it in\nsunflower oil, and she prayed over that. And she made three balls, and she told my\nsister, rub your neck once, then after an hour rub it again and throw it behind you\nand tell time. Next morning there was no sign of abscesses. And this woman was a\ntragic story, because she had the son in the army, and she was always asking how\nher son is, and she used to come with friends. And my sister, one day, almost\nbroke. Her son is dead, sh-she see in the cards that her son is dead. She couldn\u2019t tell\nher that. But she told her friends; don\u2019t say anything, but her son is dead. About\nweek later, or in 10 days, she comes over to my sister and she says, Ganichka(ph),\nI saved your life, I did everything I could for you. How could you do it to me? If\nyou told me that my son is dead, it would have been all right, but I got a m-message\nfrom the government that my son died, and all my friends told me that you told him\nthat he died, how could you do this to me? You see how difficult it is in life\u2019? My\nsister didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her that her son was dead.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: There were a lot of Jewish women who were coming, because not far from there\nwas a resort, with salt water lake, and from there, from Moscow they flew, the\nJewish women with children. And they used to come \u2014 we couldn\u2019t go over there,\nJune 20, 2014\nbecause we would have to get permission from police. We couldn\u2019t go anywhere\nfrom that village, we\u2019re not allowed to go anywhere, where you had to get\npermission from the village. But they used to come to us and they used to come to\ntell fortune. And another thing was that there was a policeman, and he came to my\nsister, and she says, oh, you\u2019re getting married tomorrow. And he says, how do you\nknow? Well, I see it in the cards. But today [indecipherable] to have a party. And\nshe says, no drinking, and no fighting. If you drink, you fight, and you be arrested.\nAnd next day, he was in jail. He got into a fight. But my sister told him that. So,\nyou know, Russians trusted her, and that\u2019s why they were always fr-from our\nhome, you know, they always gave us two eggs, or they gave us some milk, or they\ngave us some bread they brought us. And you know, so we were getting food from\nthem, from Hanya\u2019s(ph) telling fortunes, and telling. And then the Russians told\nher to stop working, because she was getting sick very often. Sh \u2014 my sister\n[indecipherable]. So they told her \u2014 they relieved her of all the work. They said,\nyou don\u2019t work, only your mother and your brother work.",
        "Q: Tell me about your father. Did you have any news of where he was at the time,\nor what had happened to him, or where his train had gone?",
        "A: No, nothing. We didn\u2019t know anything.",
        "Q: Okay.\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: I finally learn what happen to my father when I was in Palestine already.",
        "Q: That\u2019s [indecipherable] yeah.",
        "A: My mother met a priest somewhere, and somebody said Kiersnowski. She was\nin some aktion, you know, in \u2014 when we were already free. And when she said to\nmy mother, did you have a husband without the hand, you know. And my mother\nsaid yes. Well, I buried your husband. So that\u2019s how my mother first found out. But\nin that place where he was \u2014 died, there was his half-brother, and he was an officer\nin Polish army. And that\u2019s why I have a picture of his grave.",
        "Q: I see. I see.",
        "A: And \u2014 and we have death certificate that way. But we didn\u2019t know \u2014 I didn\u2019t\nknow probably for close to two years. And in \u2014 the Russians told us not to move\nsouth with the Polish troops that were going, and \u2014 but we went. And all way there\non Ferraba(ph). where we were on this \u2014 on \u2014 on the river, and s \u2014 we were\nstarving, and Polish army was sending women and men, trying to pick up the\nchildren. So my sister was very sick and the woman came over and my mother\ngave me to her. And we went to another place, over there, who was starving, we\nslept on the rain and everything. That\u2019s where I found turtles to eat, finally.\n[indecipherable] And \u2014 and \u2014 but in the beginning we slept by the river on stones,\nand then we went \u2014 they told us one day from there that we are going to Iran. We\nJune 20, 2014\ndidn\u2019t know what Iran was, I didn\u2019t know where Teheran was, but I was sick. I\nwas, and Pushkoski(ph);\nwas friend of mine, and they send us to the train to pick up some bread. I never\nforget, we tied quickly the bed \u2014 bread and wu \u2014 instead of carrying bread, we\u2019re\npushing it into our pants, you see, because we\u2019re afraid that we\u2019ll be hungry\ntomorrow. So we were stashing it, and we had bread. And then we went, and we\nwere coming back, and we went t-too far up over there, and I met a woman, and I\nsaid, is my mother and sister alive? They said yes. And I wanted to jump on that\ntrain and go out to them. But [indecipherable] there 1s no way that they can feed\nme. So I went to \u2014 on that train, and they took us to [indecipherable] on Caspian\nSea, and they put us on an oil tanker to go to Potlevy(ph) in Iran.",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019re going to stop at that point because we\u2019ve jumped ahead in our story\na little bit. I want to find out more. After your \u2014 you know, when you\u2019re in this\nvillage, and you and your mother work, and your sister is telling fortunes and\ngetting \u2014 you know, she\u2019s getting sick and \u2014 and then is relieved from having to\nwork like you and your mother, I want to find out what happens then. How do\nthings develop, and how long it 1s that you stay there. So let\u2019s talk about that \u2014",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: \u2014 and then we\u2019ll come \u2014 we\u2019ll come to this \u2014\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: I cannot give you days, you know.",
        "Q: I understand.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. But it wasn\u2019t too long after, you know, we were there several\nmonths over there, and then we were on collective farm working. And on collective\nfarm it was a riot, because they had wopsha(ph). So you got water mixed with\nflour to eat, and they had bread they gave you, and they had chemerchki(ph),\nsunflower \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 seeds, so you could eat. And I remember we were picking \u2014 what the hell we\nwere picking? Peas, I think. And the Russian girls were absolutely crazy. They\nwere sitting there and I was sitting separately from them, and those Russian girls\nwere picking that. And they said [speaks foreign language] boy, come over here.\nAnd I said, I don\u2019t want to come. They used to say, don\u2019t be afraid, we won\u2019t bite it\noff, you know. There were no men, they were all in the army. Women were going\ndesperate.",
        "Q: Don\u2019t tell me that that\u2019s what \u2014 really?",
        "A: Yeah. Women were desperate. There were \u2014 there was a girl which \u2014\nMarusha(ph), which used to give us our bread, couple of slices of bread a day. She\ntold me always, if you come for a night, I will give you more and more. They were\nJune 20, 2014\n\u2014 they were desperate, you know, to get, and the hell, I was a small boy, you know.\nI told you, I didn\u2019t grow. And I was afraid of the women.",
        "Q: Poor guy.",
        "A: But it was something. So anyway, where was I now?",
        "Q: You were collective farm. You were \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, in co \u2014 the carriage came in and they told us to go \u2014 get in and we\u2019re\ngoing to NK VD. And we came to NK VD and NKVD said, well, you are free now.",
        "Q: That\u2019s the [indecipherable]",
        "A: That was the contract which Sikorski, Stalin and everything were going to form\nPolish army, and there will be trains going south in Siberia and they will organize\nPolish army over there. So if you want to go, go. We would advise you not to go\nbecause there will be starvation over there. We have food over there. But we didn\u2019t\nlisten, and you know \u2014",
        "Q: Well, here\u2019s an interesting thing. You are deported in mid-June 1941.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s one week later that Nazi Germany attacks the Soviet Union, and\nbreaks the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact by attacking. So you\u2019re not even at the\ncamps yet, when \u2014",
        "A: Oh, no.\nJune 20, 2014",
        "Q: \u2014 when this attack comes. Did you find out about this?",
        "A: Oh yeah. It was in every \u2014 on every station, they had the picture of the\n[indecipherable] German, with the big tail and big nails like this, all over Russia.\nIt appeared on every railroad station. That\u2019s why we \u2014 that\u2019s how we found out that\nthe war broke out, because they came with those pictures. And believe me, some of\nthe people over there were asking us deep in Siberia whether the Germans really\nlooked like that. And later on, a lot of Germans from Volga River were taken by\nStalin and sent to Siberia, too.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Because during Catherine the Great, a lot of Germans were settled over there.\nSo the \u2014 they took them over to Siberia.",
        "Q: And so, you were already imprisoned when Nazi Germany \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 attacks the Soviet Union. And \u2014",
        "A: And you know what our biggest problem was then?",
        "Q: What?",
        "A: America.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: Between the Russian. Whose side are they going to be on? You know, are they\ngoing to be on the side of the allies like Russia and England and France, and \u2014 or\nare they going to be on the side of Germany? Nobody was sure. And then, thank\nGod when we heard, okay, Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and the news came.\nNow Japanese solved the problem. They said now America will have to go to war.",
        "Q: So, in other words, the question \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s what the \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 the question was, what side will America be on?",
        "A: Yeah. Because you know, like Kennedy\u2019s father, he wanted to be on German\nside, you know, a lot of Americans, they didn\u2019t want to be in a war. The war \u2014 the\ndraft in America started one day before Pearl Harbor. Americans didn\u2019t want to\ngo to war, they were only selling weapons and recession ended, depression in\nAmerica ended, because they started selling weapon, and America came out\nbecause of that war from depression. America was in awful depression. People in\nthe office told me they used to bring food to people, and often they used to enter\napartments in New York and people were dead already from starvation. They told\nme this was awful starvation in America too, during the depression.\nJune 20, 2014",
        "Q: So wi-\u2014 so in Russia, while you were deep in Siberia, you knew that the war\nhad broken out, but when the \u2014 you go to the secret police offices, the NK VD, and\nthey tell you you are free.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Was that a shock?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you believe them?",
        "A: We knew there was a war, so we thought that there is [indecipherable] because\nthe news was coming that there was Polish contacts already with Russian\ngovernment and everything. So you \u2014 you knew \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 that something was going on, just like about Katyn forest. There was a news\nin Poland that nobody knew what happened, but you see, at a period, no more\nletters were coming from there, and nobody knew what happened. So the Poles\nsuspected that they were killed, but nobody could say. And then Germans came in\nthere, and when the Germans came, America and England said that 1t was made\nby the German, Katyn forest, and that the Germans killed, because they couldn\u2019t\ninsult Uncle Joe. Because they were afraid that Uncle Joe will go back and join\nJune 20, 2014\nwith Germany again, maybe. You know, this was very complicated, I think. We\nwere afraid of many things. People didn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: So when \u2014 when you hear from the secret police that you are free, and they\nadvise you not to leave that area, this 1s now near that village of \u2014 how did you call\nit? The rebo \u2014",
        "A: Nowia \u2014 Nowia(ph) Angorivka(ph) the village was. Nowia(ph) Angorivka(ph)\nthe village was.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And they \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 they were, you know, the only thing they did to us\n[indecipherable] over there, they took our \u2014 our pictures and all our papers, you\nknow, they took every \u2014 all the memories of Poland, you know, where we were \u2014\nwere without pictures, without anything. But they didn\u2019t punish us, nobody did\nanything to us over there. It is \u2014 it\u2019s the south, this problem started, because there\nwas Starvation over there, there was \u2014",
        "Q: Okay. So let\u2019s le \u2014 excuse me, let\u2019s start here. So you \u2014 you decide to leave\nanyway \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 you \u2014 three of you. And you b \u2014 all three of you start to go south?\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: Well, we went to Rubtsovsk back, and the train came, and we got on a train\nwith Polish soldiers and we started moving south \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 you see, to where the Polish army was going to be [indecipherable]. But the\nRussians took us to Amudalia(ph) river, and they put the civilians there, and the\narmy soldiers they moved to Guzari(ph) where already Polish army was being\ntrained.",
        "Q: And you were with the civilians?",
        "A: They were alre \u2014 they were already \u2014 they were already there, Poles and a lot of\nJewish soldiers, Polish were there, and you know, they were all \u2014 everybody with\nPolish citizenship was released. So the Jews were released too. So th-they were in\nPolish army, and then they all got down to the Middle East, you know, we came to",
        "Q: So what happened \u2014 so you were apart \u2014 with the civilian group?",
        "A: Civilian group, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. What happened to you guys? What happened with you and your mother\nand your sister when you \u2014",
        "A: Well, well, when we came to there, they gave us \u2014 they call 1t white houses, you\nknow, to live in. They left us there. You see, they wanted to send us down\nJune 20, 2014\nAmudalia(ph) river, we would have died. But this [indecipherable] 80 men and he\ncould resist the Russian police and everything, and \u2014",
        "Q: You \u2014 we have to \u2014 no, excuse me, I\u2019m confused.",
        "A: They were \u2014 they were putting us on the boat already.",
        "Q: Who 1s they?",
        "A: The Russians.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They were putting us on the Russians and he came over with [indecipherable]\nguy, and he unloaded the b-boats, and they said the rush \u2014 he told the Russians, you\nwant to have a fight, we\u2019ll have a fight. And the Russians backed out, you see?\nRussians are funny people, but they backed out. But of course, there were 80 men,\nand in Russia most of the men were drafted, you know, everywhere.",
        "Q: All right, but \u2019'm confused. And I\u2019m confused because the \u2014 the \u2014 the juncture\nthat I understand 1s that the military men are separated from the women, and they\ngo off to the \u2014 where the Polish units are \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 and eventually they get to Palestine and \u2014 and are trained to fight. The\ncivilians are \u2014 are left behind, and the Russians want to put them on a boat down\nthe river, why? Why? Which river, and in a different direction?\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: To kill them.",
        "Q: Par \u2014 to kill them?",
        "A: Because I saw a lot of people being brought back from there, and on barges\nthere were nothing but dead bodies coming back from south, from the desert, and\nwe \u2014 we were the first transport that could stop the Russians and send us\n[indecipherable] they stopped the Russians from doing it.",
        "Q: So now, let me te \u2014 let me ask \u2014",
        "A: And then we are in a little \u2014",
        "Q: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. When you say they\u2019re sent down\nthe river, is that actually to be shot, or to starve to death?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But they was \u2014 Russians didn\u2019t shoot.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They mostly made you in such a miserable place, because I knew one guy that\nwas there, where I talked, and he said I used to walk around over there looking\nwhere I could kill a man to eat him.",
        "Q: I see, and this 1s in the desert; down that river, into the desert.",
        "A: They were hungry.\nJune 20, 2014",
        "Q: All right. So this fellow comes by with the 80 soldiers. What is his name?",
        "A: Pischek(ph), I think his name was.",
        "Q: Pischek(ph).",
        "A: Pischek(ph), something like that.",

        "A: \u2014 you see.",
        "Q: And he had a \u2014 he just had a group of 80 men?",
        "A: Eighty men, and he \u2014 he was rough, and for \u2014 he used to walk to NK VD offices\nwith those men, you know, and scare the bejesus out of them, because there would\nbe 10 or something officers, and he comes with 80 men, and he tells them, you\nbetter give us food or else, you know, and \u2014",
        "Q: Unbelievable.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: And they were scared of him. And then we were on that \u2014 and then we were left\non that churchyard, that\u2019s where we\u2019re really starving, that\u2019s where I had double\npneumonia, that\u2019s where people were dying like flies over there.",
        "Q: Is this on the si\u2014 y-you were moved to someplace else?",
        "A: N-No, that was \u2014 we were on that train, and the train took \u2014 the soldiers they\ntook further, but they left us over there, the Russians, in \u2014 in that place, in that\ntown.",

Can you imagine, there was\na huge river there, and I think now, there must have been fish in there, but nobody\nhad the string to catch them. There must have been food there in the river, but\nnobody was fishing. I remember some soldiers were there, sometimes sitting \u2014 and\nI remember soldiers sitting by the water, and they were killing lice. And one soldier\nsays, oh, you are from this region of Russia. He says, oh, how do you know that\nI\u2019m from there? The kind of lice that you have on you. People were covered with\nJune 20, 2014\nlice, because when you are starve, you\u2019re weak.

And they had food.\nThey were commissar\u2019s wife somewhere in Moscow, or something, and they had\nfood and everything, and they fed me. If they didn\u2019t feed me in the hospital, I\nwould have died, because there was no food. I was \u2014 I \u2014 I was there in the hospital\nand I was covered with bedbugs and everything. It was filthy. And the Russians\nwere nice doctors, they tried to do something, there was a woman doctor. But they\ndidn\u2019t have anything, and they didn\u2019t have food. You know, I remember there was\nJune 20, 2014\none dog running around that place, and everybody was trying to catch him, but\nnobody could catch the dog. So, you know, and it was various; sometimes we got\nonions, so for a couple of weeks we ate onions. Then we went, something else we\ngot, you know. Whatever we came, we cooked. But somebody caught that dog\nsomewhere and brought us some meat after I had pneumonia. And we were\ncooking and cooking that meat, I didn\u2019t want to eat it. I didn\u2019t want to eat the dog,\nbut they made me eat it, and I think that\u2019s what I regain strength. Because I\ncouldn\u2019t walk, I was so weak. There was a step, I couldn\u2019t stand on the step, arise\nmyself. It was \u2014 1t was \u2014 it was koszmar in Polish, we say, you know, this is \u2014",

        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: You started to relate a story to me later where that came into great value for you,\nthat is, you followed his advice. Tell me about that incident, when you were in\ntrouble, and could have gotten into more trouble, and what happened then.",
        "A: Well, my father exactly told me [speaks foreign language] Russia doesn\u2019t\nshow \u2014 like tears, never show them you\u2019re afraid, and you'll be all right. And when\nwe were in Ferraba(ph), we di-didn\u2019t have any coal or anything, to heat the house.\nAnd next to the railroad, there was a lot of coal lying, old coal, you know, but it\nwas par \u2014 powder, so it was useless. But if you dug in it, you could get pieces of\ncoal. So it was very cold, my \u2014 my s \u2014 my sister was sick. We had the little place,\nyou know, where to make fire in the room. And I was there, and there was, I think,\na Russian woman or a Russian boy and a Mongol woman, I don\u2019t remember how\nJune 20, 2014\nmany, you know. There were three of us, we were digging, digging, and suddenly,\npolice came, you know, and \u2014",
        "Q: The police came, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 they \u2014 they grabbed us. So I took the bag from the bottom, and I threw all the\ncoal out on the ground, they didn\u2019t. And they took us to police station, and in police\nstation they put us against the wall, and stand here. And we didn\u2019t know why we\nhad to stand. And I was standing, standing, and after the while \u2014 they had a sofa\nthere, and magazine \u2014 I said, I want to see magazines. They said [speaks foreign\nlanguage], you have dirty hands. And I had a little fur coat, you know, from\n[indecipherable]. I clean my hands, and I said, my hands are clean. So they gave\nme a magazine to look. I couldn\u2019t read Russian, but I was looking at the pictures,\nyou know. And then I told them, well, you know, it\u2019s very uncomfortable standing\nagainst the wall and looking at the magazine, I want to sit down. And they said, sit\ndown. And then came the chief of police, whatever he was, I don\u2019t know what, he\nwas NKVD probably. And he started screaming, and he screams at me, where do\nyou live? I say biale domy. So what do you \u2014 just because you live in white\nhouses, you think you can steal? I said well, I need heat and I don\u2019t have heat. And\nhe started screaming at me like hell. And I looked at him and I said [speaks\nforeign language] I don\u2019t know where my father is, you took my father away. We\nJune 20, 2014\nhave no food, we have no heat, my sister is sick. You took us to Siberia, I don\u2019t\nknow where I am and everything. You shoot me! And he looked at me like stupid\nman, and he say, go home. And those two went to jail. And he told me \u2014 and this\nwas what my father told me, don\u2019t show them that you are afraid. I told him, that\u2019s\n\u2014 you want to shoot me, shoot me. You cannot do anything to me any more. Says,\ngo home.",
        "Q: And you were how old at that point?",
        "A: About 14. I told them that and then \u2014 nothing. And my father always told me \u2014 I\nremember Cuban fiasco, when Khrushchev came with the rockets here,\nremember?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And at my desk in research department, I had writers and I\u2014 I had Dow Jones\ntape. And that was how we were getting all the news during the day.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Be-Because I needed to read all the time everything, check it, because I was in\nresearch. And a bunch of Americans, partners came, and they were all millionaires,\nyou know. And they were reading there, and what will happen with all that stuff.\nAnd I was sitting on my desk, you know, I put the \u2014 on the leg, and I said, now I\nsaw everything, but I never thought I would see a bunch of American millionaires\nJune 20, 2014\nafraid of a Russian peasant. They walked away like you cannot imagine. I told \u2014 I\ntold them, I never thought I would see a bunch of American millionaires scared of a\nRussian peasant. Because Khrushchev was a very nice man. You know how he got\nfound out?",
        "Q: How\u201d",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. He and Eisenhower hit it off very well, Khrushchev and\nEisenhower, they were both grandfathers, and si \u2014 gri \u2014 they were going to go to\nParis, and meet in Paris later on, and start talking about breaking up e-everything.\nAnd the trouble was that Eisenhower gave order to the army not to fly U-2 planes\nover Russia, because we were flying U-2 planes, you know, over Russia, and\nEisenhower ordered to stop before that flight. Now, what happened in Russia, I\ndon\u2019t know, but the American army has some excuse to do something in case\nsomething happens, and they flew over Russia, and of course the Russians \u2014\nEisenhower was told by America that Russians can shoot U-2 any time they want.\nThat\u2019s not [indecipherable] they have the rocket, and they shot U-2 with this pilot\nPower, American Power. Now, he was supposed to blow himself up, but he didn\u2019t.\nAnd Eisenhower said, we are not flying over Russia. And all of a sudden Russia\nshows them Power, and they show them U-2 plane. And in Russia, they broke off\ntalking, and Khrushchev couldn\u2019t meet with Eisenhower any more. And the\nJune 20, 2014\nwhole [indecipherable] breakthrough with Russia, with Khrushchev was\nfinished. Both by Russian military, because they didn\u2019t want peace, and American\nmilitary, because they send U-2. So, you know, you cannot trust anybody.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You cannot trust anybody, because the \u2014 Kennedy fix the \u2014 this, see, but it was\nvery simple. He withdrew Russian \u2014 American rockets and bombs from Turkey,\nand Khrushchev withdrew them from this \u2014 from Cuba, and everything was\nsettled.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Let\u2019s go back to \u2014 let\u2019s go back to Fera \u2014 Ferraba(ph), is that\nwhere you were arrested by this NK VD \u2014 oh no, by the police, for stealing.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether this was NKVD or police \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 but stealing, you know, stealing government coal. And that was not coal\nactually, powder \u2014",
        "Q: No, it was just powder.",
        "A: \u2014 but \u2014 but they let me go because they noticed that I\u2019m not afraid.",
        "Q: Yeah. Were you already released by then, or were you still in \u2014",
        "A: No, we were released already.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And they \u2014 and I was released, but you see, you could \u2014 thi-this was so\nimportant, I think later on, when we were traveling with those 80 Polish soldiers \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 and this Polish guy that said that he\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: An officer.",
        "A: \u2014 this officer, and he showed them he was not afraid, and they backed down\nevery time, every time, they backed down. They never made a friend, you know,\nsomething to restrict him, or something. They were afraid. They load people on the\nboats to send them on Amu Darya river, he goes and unloads the boats\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And they \u2014 they backed out. So it\u2019s a \u2014 1t\u2019s a very funny psychology of that\ncountry.",
        "Q: It is, it is. Let\u2019s go further, about you are now \u2014 you are now taken. Your mother\ngives you up to \u2014\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: Army.",
        "Q: \u2014 army, so that you are then taken separately from them.",
        "A: Yeah, because they \u2014 they said that they will feed us, you know. They were\ndriving raise the children. Everywhere, all over the world they were trying to save\nchildren, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And we were over there, and they gave us some food, and everything.",
        "Q: And this is this man with the 80 soldiers, I forget his name.",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know what happened to him.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He \u2014 he went after that from Ferraba(ph), where we were. They didn\u2019t send any\nmore people on the boats, and I don\u2019t know what happened. I understand that he\nwas tried later \u2014",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: \u2014 for something, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But the \u2014",
        "Q: By the Soviets?",
        "A: No, by the Polish authorities \u2014\nJune 20, 2014",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: \u2014 for pretending that he\u2019s an officer. That\u2019s stupidity. You see how stupid\npeople are? He was pretending to be an officer, and he wasn\u2019t an officer.\nSupposedly he took some money somewhere. Who knows, you know, you don\u2019t\nknow.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But it was something. But it was lucky that eventually we were taken to\nTeheran.",
        "Q: Okay, so tell me about that ver \u2014 that journey. After you say goodbye to your\nmother and your sister and you\u2019re taken by the Polish military \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, and then \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 how do you get to Teheran?",
        "A: And eventually they came to us, I was in that village, and I was there\n[indecipherable] I was with mine boy Puskotski(ph), I remember his name, we\nwere \u2014 and they came and they said, if you are not sick, you can go to Teheran.\nWell, I would go anywhere if they told me, you know, just to get \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 the hell out from that place.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: So we went and they send us to bring food supplies, I put \u2014",
        "Q: The bread.",
        "A: \u2014 bread in my pants, hiding as much as I could. And then they put us on the\ntrain. And we came to ma \u2014 Paklevy(ph). It took two days to cross Novotsk(ph).\nThere was very little water, lines and lines of people to get water, you know. And\nsome Polish soldiers are troopers, and they told us, bring some vodka for us. But I\nnever went, but they were giving \u2014 and the Russians told us, if we catch anybody\nentering on the ship with Russian money, you go back to Siberia. So you know,\nthere were bags filled in, and there were two kinds of rubles. There were ordinary\nrubles and Chervonsa. Chervonsa were the money that could use in Iran, actually\nbuy something.",
        "Q: So in other words, it was convertible. It was convertible currency.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, it must have been convertible. You see, I don\u2019t understand at that\ntime, but I must have had some, because when we came to over there, to\nPaklevy(ph), they were talking in Russian a lot. You know, the Persians knew how\nto speak Russians, and they were selling varenyye yaytsa, boiled eggs. But\nvarenyye to us in Polish it says like crow\u2019s eggs, because those eggs were so small,\nbut they were cooked. So we were \u2014 I and Puskotski(ph), we were throwing out\nthe whites and we were only eating the yellow one, to plug up for diarrhea, because\nJune 20, 2014\nwe were running to the toilet all the time, you know. But on that ship when we\nwere, I told you, we were on the front and the whole front of the ship, there were\nPolish Jews. And there was no water, and they only gave us herrings to eat\n[indecipherable]. So we were all day lining with little cups, because there was one\nfaucet by the captain\u2019s, you know, deck, and we were carrying water to those\npeople, it was awful. And once we came there, they threw at us, dates. Po-Polish\nsoldiers were on [indecipherable] and they came \u2014 the ship was too big to go out,\nand there was a storm. So they came \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to eat dates ever, you know,\nafter that, because we ate so many dates, we were hungry. And then they took us\noff that ship, and the next day [indecipherable] I don\u2019t remember what happened,\nthey drove us to tur \u2014 to Paklevy(ph), and I saw stores with meat, with bread, with\neverything. I was sure it\u2019s propaganda. I said, it\u2019s impossible. I wouldn\u2019t \u2014 I\ncouldn\u2019t believe that somebody has bread and food and meat in this store. We\ndidn\u2019t believe it, you know? It\u2019s \u2014 you get so brainwashed, you know, it\u2019s so easy.\nAnd then they shaved us, they cut our hair and I don\u2019t know what the hell they did\nwith us. The next day they put us in the trucks and we went south \u2014",
        "Q: Who 1s they?",
        "A: \u2014 toward Teheran.\nJune 20, 2014",
        "Q: Yeah. Who is they at this point? Was it Polish authorities, was it British\nauthorities?",
        "A: I\u2014they were mixed up. They were Poles, they were British, they tried to get the\nlice \u2014",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: \u2014 away from us, you know, because from Russia we came with lice, so they\nwere shaving us and everything. So everybody looked like no hair or anything. I \u2014 I\nfell up. We went to [indecipherable] place for one night. Next time and next thing\nwas Teheran. And over there I was going at night, and I fell down and it was\ntoilets that were overflowing. And I was in those Russian quilted suits, you know, I\nhad. So stink was unbelievable, and two ladies came to me in Polish, and they say\n[speaks foreign language] You\u2019re so poor, you know. They didn\u2019t know that I was\na boy.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And next day they put us in, and we came to Teheran and I| went to that camp.\nAnd in that camp they took all our clothes away, and the British were\n[indecipherable] they were burning shoes, wa \u2014 everything that he had, blankets.\nAnd we found with this boy, that in a toilet, there was a fence and there was a hole.\nSo we started selling blankets and everything to the peasants, and they were giving\nJune 20, 2014\nus money. You know, I don\u2019t know how much, but one Polish officer came and we\nask him whether he could go outside of that camp and bring us some fruits. And he\nsaid, boys, it costs money. They say, how much do you want? His eyes almost\nrolled over how much. But then I had that stupid dream again, with the bread.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The next day I went to the hospital. Of course, I don\u2019t know what happened to\nmy money. Nobody knew what my name was, and how long I was in the hospital, I\ndon\u2019t know [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did you have any documents at all? Any papers with you?",
        "A: Nothing. We \u2014 from Russia we came with absolutely nothing. Some people had\nsome papers, we had nothing. I didn\u2019t have anything. Because, you see, in Wilno,\nNowa Vileka(ph), they took all our documents, so whatever we had Polish, and\nthey confiscated. When we came to Siber-Siberia over there, they started\nscreaming at us [speaks foreign language], where are you documents, and you \u2014\nyou know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You lying and everything, and the NK VD wanted our documents, and we said,\nyou took it all in Poland already. We don\u2019t have any documents. And I remember\nhow they were cursing [indecipherable] how much, you know. You understand it,\nJune 20, 2014\nyou know. Th-They curse something awful, fuck you God\u2019s mother and things like\nthis, you know. And this \u2014 there was a Polish guy with us, and he started cursing at\nthose Russians the same way. And they say [speaks foreign language] Friend,\nwhy are you cursing? And they made him an accountant in the village. You see the\nresult? [foreign language] Th-Th-Th-They\u2019re peculiar people. A-A-And that was\nit.",

You are way, way up on the mountain. You look\nstraight down and you see buses and trucks and everything, destroyed, lying, cars\nthat fell down. Nobody bothered to fix it even. You know, nobody looked for it. It\nwas a scary like hell. And you know, Persians used to smoke hashish or something,\ntoo, and they were driving with their legs often, and when they were coming to a\nturn, they didn\u2019t slow down, but they used to blow the horn.

        "A: It\u2019s right next to Gedera. Gedera is a \u2014 a town that is on the map \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 1-1n Israel. It was right to Gedera. And there, there were several hills we had.\nAnd one hill \u2014 on each hill the British built already this how do you call it?\nShowers and things like this. And over there felt that there was a Arab village. And\nwe were ordered with a stick to guard that property, so nobody can come there.\nAnd they were standing there, and we\u2019re standing at \u2014 one boy was standing guard\nover there, and couple of Arabs were coming on a donkey, and he tried to stop\nthem with a bamboo stick. Well, they stabbed him, and the next boy that was, he\nsaw it, so he screamed. So it went \u2014 my God, there were about 1200, I think, of us,\nbecause they used to say that it is the battalion [indecipherable] 1,200. And we all\ngrabbed stones and we started running towards the Arabs. And from the Arab\nvillage, Arabs started running. And \u2014 but the camp commander called Gedera, and\nfrom Gedera came tanketki, you know, the open tanks \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 with machine guns, and across the desert we saw the Polish soldiers going like\nhell at those Arabs, a day\u2019s run back to their village right away. Otherwise,\nprobably a lot of us would have gotten killed. But it was dangerous, it was a\ndangerous place. You had to be very careful. There were some \u2014 so finally Arab\nJune 20, 2014\nboys used to come and feel your pockets. And if you were going somewhere on the\nfinger, the truck would slow down and you grab, and you had to jump in the truck.\nSo while you were jumping, once you hold the truck, you couldn\u2019t let go, because\nyou would fall down, and they emptied your pockets, steal everything. But o-over\nthere it was nice because everybody s-spoke Polish, you know, everywhere. But\none time in \u2014",
        "Q: What was the purpose of this camp, and what were the kinds of activities you\ndid there?",
        "A: Oh, we \u2014 well, school.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And we had wonderful professors, because the schools mostly were Polish\nuniversity professors from Poland that were deported to Russia and instead of\nputting them in the army regular, they brought them to that school. Because there\nwas first grade, second, third, fourth, you know. It was gymnasium.",
        "Q: But here\u2019s a question I\u2019ve got; tell me if I\u2019m wrong in this, my assumption, from\nwhat I had read, is that when Sikorski made this agreement with Stalin in 1941,\nthat the deportees from Poland, who had been deported both from Poland in 1940,\nand from the Wilno region, which was then Lithuania in 1941, were released. And\nso Polish deportees across the Soviet Union, and throughout all of the gulags, were\nJune 20, 2014\nnow free. However, only those who could have military activity, that is, those who\nwere young men who were fit to fight, would be allowed to leave the Soviet\nUnion.",
        "A: Oh no, everybody.",
        "Q: So that is women and children could leave as well?",
        "A: Women and children, everybody could leave Russia.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Everybody was allowed to leave. This was thing, but then when Katyn murder\ncame in, nobody could leave already.",
        "Q: Oh, I see. So, until the \u2014 until the Germans unearthed \u2014",
        "A: Unearthed that Katyn \u2014",
        "Q: Katyn \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and they announce it, America, and England said it was done by the\nGermans, and Stalin [indecipherable] the exploitation, and he had Polish Jewish\nfellow who was a general, what was his \u2014 and he formed communist army in\nPoland, and that was another army over there. And they went all the way to Berlin,\ntoo, with Russian army.",
        "Q: Okay.\n108June 20, 2014",
        "A: They organized Polish soldiers, and they put them into that army. Wha-What\nwas called? Ziemirski(ph) I think was [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So then he\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 but he \u2014 he was a communist, that fellow. They knew that he was, but he was\na general in Polish army, and he commanded that army, and he got Poles into\nBattle of Lenino, and Poles were slaughtered by the Germans over there. But they\nwere \u2014",
        "Q: The Battle of Lenino?",
        "A: Lenino, somewhere in Russia, and a lot of Poles were slaughtered, but they\nwent all the way to Berlin, because I have seen pictures from Poland, of Polish,\nwith Polish flag on bra \u2014 on Brandenburg back gate, Polish flags were hanging\nover there, too.",
        "Q: Well, so this \u2014 what did you say his name was? Zhir \u2014 general \u2014",
        "A: Wait, wait, let me tell you. You see, this is something. Ziemirski(ph), I think,\nZiemirski(ph).",
        "Q: Ziemirski(ph). So that means that if you had been a deportee to the Soviet\nUnion, and then you are released, and you didn\u2019t make it out of the Soviet Union\nbefore the news about Katyn broke.",
        "A: Mm-hm.\n109June 20, 2014",
        "Q: So you are still released from the gulags, but on this case \u2014",
        "A: Oh, it was very tricky. Let me tell you what happened, because I met some \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 people, I cannot talk about. But I know of the people who I knew. The\nRussians told them, either you take Russian citizenship, or we send you back to\ngulag.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: You see, after it, they were already released, they said [indecipherable]. So the\npeople who took Russian passports were later not allowed to go back to Poland.\nThey didn\u2019t want them to go back to Poland. It was very difficult, and the rest \u2014\nand they put a lot into the army. The people were willing to go into Polish army,\nsoldiers, of course, you know, because they prefer that then something else.",
        "Q: So, in other words, they could have been \u2014 this is what I was getting to.",
        "A: Yeah, but \u2014",
        "Q: Some of these could have gone into that General Ziemirski\u2019s army who had\ncome from the gulags themselves.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Is that so?",
        "A: Well \u2014\n110June 20, 2014",
        "Q: Okay. There was \u2014 let\u2019s say you\u2019re a Polish deportee, like you were from Wilno\nor \u2014 or some other region of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact area, and you\u2019re\nreleased in 1941, or the news comes in 1941 that you can be released. You are\nreleased, and then with the German advances, the Katyn massacre is discovered,\nand the border closes to Iran and you no longer can go \u2014",
        "A: No, Stalin said no more. He \u2014 he \u2014",
        "Q: Stalin says no more.",
        "A: \u2014 broke off relation with Polish government in London right away, Stalin.",
        "Q: Okay, so \u2014",
        "A: Because the Poles said, you did it. There were Americans brought, the Germans\nshot them, they knew it, but the Americans were petrified of losing Russia, because\nthey were \u2014 they did the \u2014 90 percent of fighting with the Germans \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 you know, so \u2014",
        "Q: So here\u2019s \u2014 so here\u2019s my question; if you were then free, but no longer in the\ngulags, as a former deportee, and you\u2019re a Polish citizen, you then have the option\nof joining this new Polish army.",
        "A: Polish army.\nJune 20, 2014",
        "Q: And so it could be that \u2014 that many former gulag prisoners were in that army. Is\nthat so?",
        "A: Let me tell you something. From what I understand, Poland had the fifth largest\narmy during the second World War. What was under rations, and what was in\nEngland. In England were about 200,000 Poles. Pilots with parachute troops,\ntanks and everything, under British command. And then there was another part of\nthe army over on the Russian side. So the Poles fought everywhere. They were\nbleeding like crazy for \u2014 for [indecipherable] for yours and for ours, what turned\nout it was for yours only, not for ours.",
        "Q: Yeah. So \u2014 okay. How is it that your mother made it out, and your sister?",
        "A: They must have left \u2014 I left very early, you know \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 and \u2014 and they were a little later, because they eventually came to that place\nwhere I was in Guzari(ph), and from there, they went to Teheran.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: In Teheran, my mother spoke English, so she was interpreter, and then there\nwas governor of southeastern Iran, came over to Polish embassy, and he said, I\nwant to westernize my house. Can you give me somebody who speaks French and\nEnglish and try to [indecipherable] westernize my home, because his wife spoke\n112June 20, 2014\nonly English. And my mother was sent there. She said, she gets in a car, he bought\nthem beautiful suits and everything, you know, employed them. And they get in the\ncar, and there are machine guns lying, and everything, there are two cars. You\nknow, my mother said, what is this? Why, we\u2019re going through the mountains,\nthere are bandits over there. So my mother says, well what \u2014 what do you mean?\nWhat happens? Well, whoever shoots better, wins. If they shoot at us, we will shoot\nback at them. And this was traveling to Teheran through the mountains. And\neventually they went to Zahedan, and they were there in Zahedan, and there was\nthere a Persian general Kava(ph) Kavushek(ph), who spoke very well Russian.\nAnd they helped them, you know, eventually to go back. My mother said it was\nimpossible to do. He was giving one direction, she was giving another direction.\nThey have a dinner ready, she goes and she prays Muslim prayers for two hours,\nthey cannot serve it. My mother said they \u2014 she gave up, and she went back to\nTeheran. And in Teheran she was working all the time, taking transports to\nsouthern pers \u2014 t-to southern Persia, you know, to go to Africa, or to Australia or\nsomewhere. And they were busy all the time.",
        "Q: And you, in the meanwhile were in Palestine.",
        "A: I was in Palestine and I was writing letters to all the camps that I hear that\nPolish people are. And my mother was writing letters, and we hit. I got a letter, and\n113June 20, 2014\nmy \u2014 and my mother\u2019s let \u2014 and my letter came to my mother. And in school they\nknew who I was already, because the name, and she was writing for Stanislav\nKiersnowski, and [| got a letter and I found out that my mother and my sister is\nalive, that they are in Teheran. That took a long time, I cannot tell you how long it\nwas, and then my mother wrote to the camp commander a letter, telling him that\nmy father died in Russia. She didn\u2019t write it to me. And that letter \u2014 censor was \u2014\nmixed up the letters, sent a letter to me, one to the camp commander. And the letter\nwith the \u2014 my father\u2019s death came to me in the letter, because all the letter was\ncensored during the war. So somehow the letters got transferred, and then I found\nout my father is dead. I knew very little, you know. I came to a company\ncommander. I even have his picture here, in the \u2014 in the company where I was,\nbecause it was \u2014 you know, but this was for boys. And I told him that my father\ndied, and he said, I was with your father, my God [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know\nwhether you know any Polish [indecipherable] you know?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: [indecipherable] was like very happy fellow. He says, you know, your father\nkept us all alive because he kept singing all the time. He was joking all the time,\nand he said, one trouble was \u2014 and this is sad for me to tell. There was \u2014 first a\nRussian commander was in that camp. They told me \u2014 everybody told me that my\n114June 20, 2014\nfather had no hand, so he couldn\u2019t work, so they made him a night watchman. And\na Jewish man came to be the camp commander, and he was the son of a bitch, he\nremoved my father from rations, from food. He said [speaks foreign language],\nyou don\u2019t work, you don\u2019t eat. So my father was living on what other soldiers were\nbringing him, pieces of potatoes, pieces of bread, and things like this. And my\nfather was always saying that in life you can\u2019t deny two things; that you\u2019ll be in\njail, and you di \u2014 you will be a beggar. And he was like a beggar at the end. But\nthey said that he used to sing so beautifully. He kept our spirits up, your father.\nAnd here was, you know, the com-company commander.",
        "Q: So tell me, how was it that he died?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: What age \u2014 how did he die? What \u2014 what happened to your father?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether he died of typhus, or \u2014 or whether he got poisoned,\nbecause he vrai \u2014 if he ate mutton meat, he would have been dead if they didn\u2019t\nknow what to do.",
        "Q: Okay, cause he was allergic to it.",
        "A: Because he used to stiffen up.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He used to completely \u2014\n115June 20, 2014",
        "Q: He couldn\u2019t eat lamb.",
        "A: He couldn\u2019t eat lamb, he was so allergic to it, that \u2014 and he died, so th \u2014 in\npapers it\u2019s written that he had typhus, you know, but they said that he died very\nfast. When you think of all of these \u2014 all the things it could have been, and turned\nout opposite.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And then when we found about Teheran and everything, oh my God, the\nconferences. When no Polish people wanted to believe my mother about, because\nPolish people didn\u2019t know about Teheran conference, what was in there.",
        "Q: So how did your mother know?",
        "A: Well, she \u2014 she went in there, and spoke English, and American intelligence\nofficer in that hotel came to my mother, where are you going after the war? And\nmy mother said well, I hope we are going return to Poland. He says, you can\u2019t.\nStalin a-and [indecipherable] just made a deal, Poland goes to Russia. So better\ngo somewhere else. And so we told all the Polish people what\u2019s going on, none of\nthem wanted to believe it. But it from \u2014 my mother got it from an officer. I told you\nthat the difference was that she knew languages, she could contact people. I\nremember when she came in Karachi she said she came to the camp, and she went\nto see the camp commander, and he was sitting with his legs on the table, and my\nJune 20, 2014\nmother walked in. When I walk in a room, please take your feet down and put them\non the floor, she told the British camp commander. And she had guts.",
        "Q: She had guts.",
        "A: From then on, he was so polite, and he right away knew that he has to do\nsomething else with her other thing. But you couldn\u2019t do much with the Polish\npeople, because they were all talking about democracy. There was an old woman,\nfriend of ours, and we had only a bench, a table and a bed, you know. And she \u2014\nmy mother went to ask him for a chair for her, easy chair, you know, to sit down.\nWell, he got my \u2014 for that woman Parneechee(ph) Lesker(ph), a easy chair. My\nGod, there was almost a riot in the camp by Polish people. What is this? What is\nthis? We\u2019re a democracy and you give somebody an easy chair to sit. They were\njealous.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And they were so jealous when we were traveling first class wherever we were\ngoing, when \u2014 on the ship, you know, because of being an interpreter. And then\nwhen we were coming in to India, when we were, there was a horseman, British\nIndian colonel. And my mother ask him why do you serve in British army? And he\nsays, well, we have to learn how to fight. Otherwise, the British never get out from\nIndia. He says, we are going to war to learn how to fight. Ah, that was something.\n117June 20, 2014",
        "Q: So, okay. Let\u2019s go back then and try a little bit chronologically. You\u2019re in the\ncamp, and you learn of your father\u2019s death through this misdirected letter that\ndidn\u2019t get to the camp commandant. And your mother finds out where you were.\nHow do you meet?",
        "A: Well, my mother knew General Anders(ph), the commander of Polish troops in\nthe Middle East, because he used to come to Rudakow(ph) when she was young.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: And for practice over there on \u2014 on the \u2014 on the farming, you know, they had\nthis huge farm and he came there twice. So my mother wrote a letter to him,\nwhether it\u2019s better to leave me in this military school, high school in Palestine, or\nto go to civilian life. And he never answer my mother, but the order came from\nhim, to put me on medical commission, discharge me and send me to Teheran. So\nthey discharged me and they send me to Teheran. And I came, and finally I met\nmy mother, and I was shocked. I was so shocked, because when I was in Russia, I\nwas like this, and I looked at my mother and my sister like this. And I came back\nfrom Palestine, I look, here\u2019s my mother and here\u2019s my sister. I grew up so much. I\nwas so shaken up, because my mother wasn\u2019t big, and my sister wasn\u2019t big, and I\nremember them so much bigger than I. And with all this to think, you know, what\n118June 20, 2014\nwas it, about two year, a year and a half period, I grew up so much. I was so\nshocked when I saw that my mother is so small.",
        "Q: So it had been about a year and a half since you had seen her?",
        "A: Yeah, year and a half or two years. I cannot really tell you exactly.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I\u2019m mixed up with the dates.",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay. That\u2019s okay.",
        "A: Mm. And then \u2014 and then once we came to India, when I went to \u2014",
        "Q: So when you \u2014 hang on. You\u2019re in Teheran then.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And what was your next move and where did you go with \u2014 with everybody,\nthat is, your mother \u2014",
        "A: Well, the next move was to Karachi.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: To India, to \u2014 you see, America wouldn\u2019t take any Poles.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Mexico took some Polish children, and the British send the people who were\ncoming, they send them to Australia, they send them to New Zealand. They send\nthem some to Canada when \u2014 even Mexico took some, but America didn\u2019t take\n119June 20, 2014\none person. It\u2019s the same thing they did to the Jews. Jews came out, right, one ship\nwent to Cuba.",
        "Q: The Saint Louis, yes.",
        "A: One ship went to this Dominican Republic and the other one came back to\nthere, and they were all killed over there.",

        "A: You know that story.",
        "Q: Yes, yes. So \u2014",
        "A: So the \u2014 so the same was to us.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: America won\u2019t let him. Quota number you had to get. So we applied in quota\nnumber \u2014 it was in \u00b043, I think \u2014 and we applied in Karachi for quota number for\nAmerica, and I went to school in Karachi and started learning English. I had a\nwonderful time in Karachi. I met British fellows, and there was American Red\nCross and American police, and they used to give me magazines, and I used to sell\nmagazines to Indian storekeepers, you know, and they \u2014 I always get money, I\ncould rent a bicycle for myself, and I used to go and eat over there. And the\nAmerican soldiers were nice, you know. I tell you, over there, there was a very\nunpleasant experience that stays with me to this day.\n120June 20, 2014",
        "Q: And what\u2019s that?",
        "A: Outside of that Red Cross over there, a group of American officers were\nstanding, and there was an Indian fellow telling them fortune, and he says, well,\nyour wife is called \u2014 I will write it for you, I cannot pronounce it. And he would\nwrite the name of the wife. You know, he never knew the soldiers, 1t was amazing.\nAnd then you know, he was telling them how their children are and everything, this\nIndian fellow. And then one soldier, officer said, please tell me my fortune. And he\nsaid, I won\u2019t talk to you. And he says, talk to me, tell me. He says, no, I won\u2019t talk\nto you. Don\u2019t ask me anything. Please don\u2019t ask me. Just leave me alone. And this\nAmerican said please. Another soldier said, what\u2019s the matter? Tell him. Well, he\nsaid, are you going to Burma tomorrow? Yes. And you will be killed the next day.\nHe was a pilot. He says, you are a pilot and you will be killed the next day. You\nwant to know, I'll tell you now. Can you imagine how that man felt? And this I\nremember to this day, this Indian fellow said, I don\u2019t want to tell you \u2014 and he says,\nall of a sudden, are you going to Burma today? He says yeah. He says, tomorrow\nyou will be killed, as a pilot. And to \u2014 1t \u2014 it was so shocking to me, you know.",
        "Q: It must have been. It must have \u2014",
        "A: We were be \u2014 we were being warned in India never to be bad to a beggar, never\nto mistreat somebody on the street, because they can curse you, and nobody can\n121June 20, 2014\nhelp you. And they were warning us, be very careful in India. Don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t ever a-\nannoy people in any way. He may be a beggar for you, but they have powers. I\ndon\u2019t know, th-they said it, you know, yogi, and everything that they do. I saw a\nyogi buried in \u2014 in a grave, the next day they have to wake him up, he didn\u2019t\nbreathe. There were two doctors, American and British checking him, and they\npronounced him dead. His heartbeat was so slow that they couldn\u2019t detect it. So \u2014",
        "Q: Wow. And did he wake up the next day?",
        "A: Oh yeah. They dug out him from there. He was in a coffin, put in a grave, and\nnext day they open up, and there was a man who has to wake him up. I\u2019ll tell you,\nhe was amazing. He took an umbrella and on every stick of umbrella that comes\nout, there was a different color ball. And they were spinning it like this, so you\nknow all the balls went flying. And they say, which ball do you want to shoot? And\nhe took [indecipherable] and a ball. And you said the red one, and the red ball\nwould be shot off, in that [indecipherable]. It\u2019s amazing \u2014 amazing concentration\nthat those people had. They had the stick, metal stick put on a table, and his eyes\nwere tight in this case, and they spun it around and they hit the metal piece, you\nknow, tha \u2014 tha \u2014 and it was vibrating. And he turned around and he aimed the\narrow and he hit it. Just [indecipherable]",

They constantly were bombing, because his outfit was hit. He had\nthe side blown up, he was six months in Italy in the hospital. He said only two\nfellows from his outfit survive American bombing. Instead of bombing Germans,\nthey were bombing Polish position. And, you know, everybody was afraid of\nfriendly fire, he said, next to Americans. They\u2019re irresponsible. I remember on the\nday I was drafted into the army, they gave us rifles. And you know, you don\u2019t pull\nthe trigger in the rifle, you don\u2019t fool around. American soldiers were running,\npoof, poof, poof, playing cowboys, pointing at each other and pulling the triggers.\nAnd you know, every now and then a bullet came out, and \u2014 and guys were being\nkilled.

They\nwere all crying and I remember in Korea when we went, they put us into a barrack\nmade from cans, you know, and barbed wire around, and it stunk like hell because\nKoreans were hanging octopus and everything to dry on the barbed wire. So thank\nGod I had some other cologne, so I used to put on that cologne when I had to walk\nover there. But at night it was the funniest thing, we are talking, and there was a\nblack guy who just came back from Japan. And you see gunpowder in his face,\nyou know. And he said, man, I\u2019m telling you \u2014 this black guy says \u2014 man, we were\nsure dying, white fellows and black fellows.

So it must be around \u00b043 - \u201944 and then I went to school\nstill in three months in English school. That was beautiful, but grades were very\nbad and people didn\u2019t teach properly. I took advantage of them.",
        "Q: How did you do that?",
        "A: Well, that was Anglican church school. And in India if you were Catholic, and\nyou were sent to Anglican school, the people who send you were excommunicated.\nAnd they send me to that school, and I came over and it was eighth grade. But I\nonly was three months, and I passed exams for three grades, for ei-eighth grade,\nyou see, because I \u2014 I went from seven to eight, but only for three months. And I\nfigured out I don\u2019t want to start eighth grade from the beginning, | had to start it\nfrom the beginning.

And there \u2014 there was\nFather Beech(ph), he was fantastic. Father Beech(ph) spent every night with me in\nhis cell, locked up and teaching me English, helping me. He made me buy\n[indecipherable] Orczy\u2019s book, \u201cA Scarlet Pimpernel,\u201d and she \u2014 he made me\nwrite all the words, and memorize all the words. I remember part of it to this day.\nWe seek him here, we seek him there, those Frenchies seeks him everywhere. Is he\nin heaven, is he in hell, this damn elusive pimpernel? You see how I remember?\nThere is an opera like that.",

I got PF in English, partly fail, but the rest [indecipherable] I\ndid very good in geography. They said that I took second place in India in\ngeography and in that exam, Cambridge exam. In religion I was very good, in\nmath. In drawing, I failed, almost. I me \u2014 I mistook what they wanted us to paint,\nyou know? I was to paint a design in a circle and I \u2014 I subdivided the circle, so I got\nzero for it.

        "A: \u2014 that Father Beech(ph) was sunburned, he went on vacation and he\u2019s very\nbadly sunburned. So I go to his cell, and I knock on the door. Who\u2019s there?\nStanislaus. Oh, come on in, come on in. I walk into the car \u2014 to the thing and the\nfan standing and blowing on him, and he has just a little piece of cloth over here,\nand I see nude women on his arm, on his leg, on his chest and everything, and he\u2019s\na priest. And I said, Father, what is this? He says, I was a merchant marine in\nIndia, and they send me \u2014 I was engaged to get married, and they send me to\nmerchant marine school in England. And when I came back, she married\nsomebody else, I said to hell with it, I became a priest. I got so mad I became a\npriest. But, he said, when I was merchant marine, that\u2019s what we did.",

And sometimes, in the evening \u2014 and there were bathrooms on the first\nfloor, so sometimes at night we woke up, and I would go down. They always had a\nmonk watching us in the school \u2014 in the corridor, so there would be no monkey\nsexual business or anything like this.",

Because I remember that\nmy father became a mayor of a small town where my sister was born. Actually \u2014\nwait, what\u2019s its name, you see \u2014 and over there, my father received money to give\nto people who have trouble. So my father knew some Polish people.

And my father said to a\nrabbi, give me the name of the Jewish people that need financially help, because we\ngot some money from the government, and we can help. And \u2014 and the rabbi gave\nhim the names, and my father said, well, I know this fellow, he needs help, this\nguy. And the rabbi said no, they are healthy, they can work. Only give to them that\nare sick. Don\u2019t give to the people that are we \u2014 healthy, because they will stop\nworking. My father was always telling me.

        "A: \u2014 arranged by the government and it could have been some help from America.\nYou see, America wanted to give Poland this Marshall Plan, but Stalin refused to\nhave Marshall Plan.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, that\u2019s afterwards. Now, when you\u2019re talking about the help that your\nfather got from the government and from Ronniker(ph), you\u2019re talking first World\nWar.",
        "A: The first World War.",
        "Q: After the first World War.",
        "A: After the first World War, there was help, and then was Marshall Plan, and\nMarshall Plan was run by a Polish member of Federal Reserve of amer \u2014 in\nAmerica. And he used to come and help us [indecipherable] he used to teach us,\nyou know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And nobody \u2014 Americans couldn\u2019t believe that I, going to NYU, I\u2019m talking to\nFederal Reserve fellow. And he told me that Marshall Plan was made to rebuild\nquickly England, Japan, France, Germany, so we can trade wi \u2014 again. Give the\nmoney to rebuild those countries to trade, and that\u2019s what he \u2014 h-he told us.",
        "Q: Okay, so aft \u2014 during the second World War, Mr. Ronniker(ph) is still in a\nposition \u2014 some kind of position of authority.\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: Some kind of position of authority, in Poland.",
        "Q: In Poland.",
        "A: He\u2019s not in the Polish government \u2014",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: \u2014 you see, but he is RGO, or this was something called like help to the people \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 because he got money from Hoover.",
        "Q: And now was this RGO a Polish underground organization?",
        "A: No, wa\u2014",
        "Q: Was this a German municipal organization?",
        "A: There was no German, there was nothing, it was Polish thing that he operated.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And he traveled. He said the worst thing was like he said, underground in\nPoland. That was crazy. They would shoot the German somewhere, and then the\nwhole village gets killed. He was telling me, you know, a lot of stupid things are\nbeing done. Why the hell shoot a German somewhere, where for pleasure or\nsomething, and then the Germans come and they \u2014 and kill a lot of people. Now \u2014\nnow they say that Warsaw uprising, nobody wants to take responsibility who\nstarted it. Because London says, we didn\u2019t give the orders, nobody wants to, you\n159June 20, 2014\nknow, what [indecipherable] whole population of Warsaw was evacuated and\nkilled and everything. And the \u2014 now they say that a lot of it was done from\nRussia, that Russia was broadcasting to Poles all the time to rise up against\nGermany. Well, America did that with Hungary. They were telling to Free\nEurope, to Hungarians to make a revolution. And when they made a revolution\nover there, you remember the Hungarian revolution? What was this thing \u2014 Foster\nDallas said, that\u2019s an internal Russian affair. So the Russians went in there and\nfinished that revolution.",
        "Q: Going back to Mr. Ronniker(ph). You mentioned during one time when we\nwere not filming, that after the war somebody said at a party when they found out\nthat you should \u2014 that whoever was there should get on their knees.",
        "A: Got the \u2014 got on their knees and started kissing his hands, because \u2014",
        "Q: Who? Who said that? Who se \u2014",
        "A: She \u2014 her mother.",
        "Q: Who\u2019s her \u2014 who is the person? Wha \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, there was a Polish woman \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 who was from Poland, and she found out that this is Ronniker(ph), and she\nsays to her daughter, on your knees and start killing.\n160June 20, 2014",
        "Q: Kissing, kissing.",
        "A: Because the Germans had us all lined up to be killed, and he came and he talked\nto the Germans, and they let us go. You see, so he had influence with the Germans\nin some way. How, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Maybe because they knew of his connection, and they must have known who he\nwas. Hitler wouldn\u2019t send his interpreter, Schmidt to his trial in Krak\u00e9w, you\nknow.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and that\u2019s what he told us, and I\u2014 maybe he was lying, but I\ndoubt it.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I was \u2014 he was an old man, and he se \u2014",
        "Q: Well, 1t sounds like there\u2019s quite a story.",
        "A: [indecipherable] finally run away, because you know Russian right away\nsentenced him to death, too. And he ran away from Poland and he eventually came\nto America.\nJune 20, 2014",
        "Q: Well, it sounds like quite a story, and that there probably isn\u2019t a lot \u2014 a lot to his\nstory, but you ha \u2014 you only learned the fragments of it, and so can only tell us\nfragments of it.",
        "A: Yeah, I can only tell what he told me.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: This is what he told me, this is his story. You see, there were so many things\ngoing on over there that nobody knew, that what was going on, who was what, you\nknow? I \u2014 it\u2019s awful, but ee \u2014 the people don\u2019t learn to stop killing each other.\nThose African tribes and in British. Did you ever see Kuwait on the map?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: When Churchill was drunk, as usual, they was \u2014 they were dividing after the\nfirst World War. So Churchill drew a line like this, you know, one line like this,\none \u2014 they cross, and they are like this. So you know what this 1s? Here is Kuwait,\nyou know what this is? No man\u2019s land. Between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, this big\npiece of the lines that cross like this, it\u2019s \u2014 on the atlas if you look, it\u2019s no man\u2019s\nland, you know\u201d? And this used to be a part of, once upon a time, of Iraq. And \u2014\nand amer \u2014 English designed the state, and they made a lot of everything. And all\nthose countries that are now fighting in Africa, they conquered the \u2014 different\ntribes were living, and they put different tribes together, and they all hate each\n162June 20, 2014\nother, and they are all fighting. Th-Th-Th-The world is crazy. They did a lot of bad.\nAnd when you are \u2014 when I think of the Spanish war, they did it in South\nAmerica, killing, slavering, everything. A-Americans came, British\n[indecipherable] Indians, who are savages, let\u2019s kill all the Indians, you know.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a kind of sad note, and \u2014 to end our interview on, but I\u2019d like to ask you \u2014 I\nmean, I think we could sit and we could talk about many things, two or three times\nover, but I \u2014 I want to kind of sum up our conversation today, and our interview\ntoday and d \u2014 how \u2014 how would you think some \u2014 when someone will listen to\nyour story that has so many facets to it, that has both beautiful memories of where\nyou grew up and how you grew up, and then great, I\u2019d say terror and fear, and 1\u2014\nand poverty, after the deportation. And yet, you see, you have so much variety in it;\nwhat would you want people to understand, from what you went through? What\nwould you want them to understand from your life?",
        "A: Well, [Il tell you something, always expect that something better will come.\nWhen you get old, you lose it already, you know, but when you young, you look\nand you strive, you know. Like I went to NYU six years at night. But I was \u2014 I\nknew I was getting somewhere. There were people telling me, you stupid going to\nschool. I said, oh yes, I\u2019m stupid. I had a girlfriend, very nice, and she told me, you\nstupid going to NYU. I said, well, but I\u2019m going to study, and I\u2019m going to finish\n163June 20, 2014\nthis school. And you know, there were a lot of things in life, and you always look\nfor something. And I had one big objective, that I had my father who told me, take\ncare of your mother and your sister. And I took care of them. My sister died in\n2001, you know, and to the last day I always took care of her, and I did everything\nthat I could to help my sister, my mother. And you know, my cousin, responsibility\nfor that. And also, in my life, 1t was funny, but I took care of other people. I was \u2014\nwe were drafted into American army, and there was a Ukrainian fellow sleeping\nabout me, and he started complaining that he has stomachache. So I said, give me\nyour knee. I pulled his knee, oh, appendicitis. So I ran to the company headquarters\nand I said, get me an ambulance quickly, we have to take this fellow for operation.\nThey told me, who do you know, what do you know, you think you stupid or\nsomething, he\u2019s goldbricking. So I went back, I waited 15 - 20 minutes, I came\nback. You know, we\u2019re going to sue you if he dies. He may die soon. They called\nambulance, straight from the barrack on the operating table, it was appendicitis.\nThere was a fellow in Korea, and he used to stand and burn his legs, and I realized\nthat he was so depressed, that he didn\u2019t pain, because we had those Coleman\nstoves. So, how to help him? He had very thick glasses. So I said, put your thick\nglasses right next to your bag, and in the morning step on them and crush them.\nAnd he crushed them. Doctors didn\u2019t pay attention, nobody. They send him to\n164June 20, 2014\nJapan, and of course he was sent back home. He was a mental case, you know.\nLook at my wife. She conks out on me on the lawn, and I give CPR and I don\u2019t\nknow what the hell I do, but she\u2019s alive.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re talking about Francesca your wife?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yes, okay. And \u2014",
        "A: But \u2014 but you know, you have things in life, and I like to give people help. Not\neverybody likes help. She objects to me when I talk to my cousin, but I try to help\nthem. They argue with me, you know. But I have more knowledge about certain\nthings than they have, and I try to give it to them. What they re \u2014 they refuse it,\nthey fight it, but eventually they\u2019ll take it. Eventually they\u2019ll take it. You try to tell\npeople, this is what\u2019s important in life, this is what you do. And you know, a lot of\npeople gave up, a lot of people give up. We saw this \u2014 I tell you, I saw one thing;\nJewish people give up very fast. They break down. We saw them breaking down\nmore than we were breaking down, you know. I really saw that in my Jewish\npeople. I don\u2019t know why.",
        "Q: Where \u2014",
        "A: I\u2019m talking about Russia.",
        "Q: Okay.\n165June 20, 2014",
        "A: They were weaker, I think. They were \u2014 somehow they didn\u2019t have the\nconsistency or something, and we \u2014 because we saw them covered with lice,\nstanding in line. Often we were trying to get the lice off; they didn\u2019t. And I\nunderstand that once a doctor walked through a hospital and \u2014 with a group of\nstudent doctors, and he asked them, which of these patients is the most sick, you\nknow, the sickest person. So one fellow said, well he \u2014 this one has this disease,\nthis one has this disease, this one has this disease. And the doctor said, you are all\nwrong. Look at him. There\u2019s a fly walking on his face, and he reacts already. He\ngave up. He\u2019s the sickest. And you know, people, if they \u2014 if they react, you know\n\u2014 and I was lucky that I had a mother that could help me so much, you know, she\nhelped me so, so much.",
        "Q: In what way\u201d?",
        "A: In every way. With the English language, and with the getting me to the schools,\nyou know. I wouldn\u2019t be able, by myself to get. But for her, knowing the English,\nknowing the French, they recognize right away that she was of a different class.\nThe English respect the class very much, so you know, they were conscious, and\nthey saw it right away. And then I took advant \u2014 and I made a lot of friends. In life,\nI made a lot of friends. I tell you like in Karachi, we were \u2014 there was a club for\nBritish soldiers and diving and everything. I got to know the Canadian fellow who\n166June 20, 2014\nwas running. We used to steal Indian boats and go sailing, the two of us together.\nAnd then we\u2019d steal cookies and everything. And one time, maybe I told you that, I\ntold in Polish school that I take some boys, and they went with me over there. So in\nPolish school they didn\u2019t like me because I was go-going to this, to \u2014 in the school.",
        "Q: Cause you were miss \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: So they loaded a bus or truck of children and they went over there, and they told\nthat we let them into that club. Of course, they threw them out. But the guys with\nme came, and they could swim and eat and everything, because I knew this fellow.\nYou know, so I made contact. I told you in American Red Cross I made contacts\nwith those soldiers, and I have everything. So I always had some money, you\nknow, for these things. Then I ran photography, and I started making money on\nphotography. You constantly had to figure out something. When I came to\nAmerica I had no money, so I took a course in radio and television, I started\nlearning how to do. And you know, and then I didn\u2019t finish it because I went to\nKorea. But I le \u2014 I learned so much about electricity that \u2014 you have to ask people,\nand you have to talk to people so much, because you learn something from\neverybody. Everybody teaches you something. Sicknesses. If you sick, learn from\nthem what are the symptoms, what you have and everything, so you know, and you\ncan tell somebody too, and you can help, you know. You cannot rely always on a\n167June 20, 2014\ndoctor only, because s-sometimes you know you have to know a lot of things, and\nthe more you can learn in life, the better for you in life. And I think that\u2019s what\ninterests me. The \u2014 only now, I have the seat [indecipherable] and I cannot do\nanything, and I say, and I \u2014",

        "Q: All right, but \u2019'm confused. And I\u2019m confused because the \u2014 the \u2014 the juncture\nthat I understand 1s that the military men are separated from the women, and they\ngo off to the \u2014 where the Polish units are \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 and eventually they get to Palestine and \u2014 and are trained to fight. The\ncivilians are \u2014 are left behind, and the Russians want to put them on a boat down\nthe river, why? Why? Which river, and in a different direction?",
        "Q: Par \u2014 to kill them?",

        "Q: \u2014 being released? Nothing?",
        "Q: Yeah.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: The type, mm-hm.",
        "Q: But we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re getting ahead of our story.",
        "Q: We\u2019re getting a little ahead of our story. Let\u2019s go back to Parlevy(ph), I believe\nyou said it was?",
        "Q: Paklevy(ph), and then you got si \u2014 you had the dream, and then you got sick?",
        "Q: So you were going on a bus?",
        "Q: No, on a truck, it was a truck.",
        "Q: Well, so was this after you got better? I mean, you \u2014 when you \u2014 yeah.",
        "Q: Is when you tried \u2014",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And then \u2014",
        "Q: What was the name of the place?",
        "Q: Bashkeet(ph)?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: What was the purpose of this camp, and what were the kinds of activities you\ndid there?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: But here\u2019s a question I\u2019ve got; tell me if I\u2019m wrong in this, my assumption, from\nwhat I had read, is that when Sikorski made this agreement with Stalin in 1941,\nthat the deportees from Poland, who had been deported both from Poland in 1940,\nand from the Wilno region, which was then Lithuania in 1941, were released. And\nso Polish deportees across the Soviet Union, and throughout all of the gulags, were",
        "Q: So that is women and children could leave as well?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Oh, I see. So, until the \u2014 until the Germans unearthed \u2014",
        "Q: Katyn \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So then he\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: The Battle of Lenino?",
        "Q: Well, so this \u2014 what did you say his name was? Zhir \u2014 general \u2014",
        "Q: Ziemirski(ph). So that means that if you had been a deportee to the Soviet\nUnion, and then you are released, and you didn\u2019t make it out of the Soviet Union\nbefore the news about Katyn broke.",
        "Q: So you are still released from the gulags, but on this case \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So, in other words, they could have been \u2014 this is what I was getting to.",
        "Q: Some of these could have gone into that General Ziemirski\u2019s army who had\ncome from the gulags themselves.",
        "Q: Is that so?",
        "Q: Okay. There was \u2014 let\u2019s say you\u2019re a Polish deportee, like you were from Wilno\nor \u2014 or some other region of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact area, and you\u2019re\nreleased in 1941, or the news comes in 1941 that you can be released. You are\nreleased, and then with the German advances, the Katyn massacre is discovered,\nand the border closes to Iran and you no longer can go \u2014",
        "Q: Stalin says no more.",
        "Q: Okay, so \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: So here\u2019s \u2014 so here\u2019s my question; if you were then free, but no longer in the\ngulags, as a former deportee, and you\u2019re a Polish citizen, you then have the option\nof joining this new Polish army.",
        "Q: And so it could be that \u2014 that many former gulag prisoners were in that army. Is\nthat so?",
        "Q: Yeah. So \u2014 okay. How is it that your mother made it out, and your sister?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And you, in the meanwhile were in Palestine.",
        "Q: No.",
        "Q: So tell me, how was it that he died?",
        "Q: What age \u2014 how did he die? What \u2014 what happened to your father?",
        "Q: Okay, cause he was allergic to it.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: He couldn\u2019t eat lamb.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So how did your mother know?",
        "Q: She had guts.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, okay. Let\u2019s go back then and try a little bit chronologically. You\u2019re in the\ncamp, and you learn of your father\u2019s death through this misdirected letter that\ndidn\u2019t get to the camp commandant. And your mother finds out where you were.\nHow do you meet?",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "Q: So it had been about a year and a half since you had seen her?",
        "Q: Okay.",

Actually, a\nJune 20, 2014\nmason showed me in America papers the Jews used to, 1600, how to come to\nPoland. It was shown that there was nothing, no towns or nothing.

I said, why did you come? Nobody ask you. You were invited to\ncome, but surely, to open the trade. And \u2014 and that was it. Very often we were told\nby Jewish people even in Wilno, you own the street, we own the houses, you\nknow, so that was the \u2014 all the businesses, if you went to stores or something, like\nwe used to go and buy clothes, and everything was in \u2014 most in Jewish stores, you\nknow. Later on they started making cooperatives in Poland, so \u2014 like we had to sell\nJune 20, 2014\na cow or a horse or a grain; everything will being always sold to Jewish people. But\ngenerally before the war, they started making trading organization, and you know,\nthe \u2014 and that was different.

And when I told them that I\u2019m Polish,\nwell, they loved Polish people because Polish people hated the Russians. And this\nwas after the Korean war, and you know, when Russians marched and took kore \u2014\nup north, Japan, well they never released it, and they said that was the reason the\nJapanese surrendered so fast in second World War.

And I\nalways remember that barn, there was a big storm before the war, and the wind tore\nthe whole roof off, and we had to pay a lot of money to rebuild the roof on it, and\nthe Polish government put a new tax on us for the new roof, instead of giving us a\ntax reduction.",

And I was happy, and I had the Linden\ntree, and I had a house in the tree, and there was \u2014 Francesca knows, it wasn\u2019t far I\n\u2014 well, maybe half a kilometer was a railroad station from us, on the top, and there\nJune 20, 2014\nwas a boy there, he was my friend, and we were making a dir \u2014 from wood, we\nwere making trains and everything. I wasn\u2019t allowed to play with him, because he\nspoke very bad Polish. It was so funny, one time I came to him, and there was a\nfellow that was a miner in America. Polish were 1n coal mines, and he bought\nhimself a farm and he married a young girl. And he bought his son very nice skis.\nAnd this fellow [indecipherable] he went and he stole his skis. And this man came\nto get the skis back. And his father was beating th \u2014 him with the belt like hell. And\nwe go out from the house, and I said, why did your father beat you so much,\nbecause you stole? No, no, no, that I don\u2019t know how to steal, that\u2019s why he was\nbeating me. So you see, my mother didn\u2019t want me to play \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 but we used to go to the river. There was a river maybe a kilometer away from\nthere, there were a lot of snakes in there, you had to wear boots. And we used to go\nfishing there, and I used to catch little fish, and eat them. Oh, I loved fried little\nfish, you know. I \u2014 [| all re \u2014 all remember that, 1t was so nice. Then one time there\nwas, in another place there was a fellow, they had the drugstore in Wilno, and he\nwent to school with me. And suddenly, a big carriage was going by. And he says,\nlook at that carriage, and I stopped the carriage, it was my grandfather carriage.",
        "A: And we got into it, and the car \u2014 they drove us around, you know, he drove us\nall around. And when I came back to school, this fellow say, did I have a ride in a \u2014\nla carrozza(ph), you know, and everything. Then, I tell you, they came, poor\nchildren, Polish boys. There was a scout camp for small Polish boys, and ah \u2014 there\nmust have been about a hundred of them, and they came to us to get straw, so they\ncould make shiniki(ph), you know, to sleep, and what they would \u2014 can give them\nsome food. So we gave them some potatoes, some meat and everything to help.\nAnd they invited me there for a week, and I was there. And not far from there was a\ncamp from [indecipherable] I ge \u2014I get the name. Oh God almighty, that was in\nPrussia, on the border of Prussia.",
        "A: And they were from there, the Polish. But they were big scouts, and they made\nthe big campfire. They were staying with one parish, where the priest had the thing.\nAnd we went over there. Then they tried to kidnap us, but we defended. But then\nall those boys said, we want to make campfire big too. And I said, well let\u2019s go. We\nwere across from my grandfather\u2019s f-forest. So I said, come on kids, let\u2019s go and \u2014\nwith me, and they all went, which was private property. So we all went, and they\nwere picking everything, mushrooms and fruits and wood, you know, and they was\nbringing and going back, bringing more and finally the forester caught us. And the\nJune 20, 2014\nforester said, what are you doing here, you know. And I said, I\u2019m grandfather \u2014 this\nis my grandfather\u2019s land, so I give them permission. So I came to my grandfather\ncouple of days later and he says, boy, you pull your authority. He says, you don\u2019t\nget away, he told them \u2014 they says, like my thing, and I give them the permission.",
        "A: So, you know, it was great thing with the other kids, you know, that they could\ndo things that others could do and I \u2014 I opened up for them the forest, so \u2014 you\nknow, in the forest there are a lot of things \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 growing, so they were so happy.",
        "A: Those were \u2014 those were mostly poor children \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 from the town.",
        "A: Oh, a beautiful \u2014\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: I had beautiful childhood. You see, the day my childhood ended, when the\nRussians walked in, and I realized that my parents cannot protect me. To this day, it\nstays in my mind.",
        "A: To this day, that realization that now I have no protection. There\u2019s somebody\nover us that can do us harm.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I just realized the Russians came to our property. They asked for a\ngun, my father had a ra \u2014 gun, and when he walked out the Russians got scared\nbecause he was carrying the [indecipherable] to give it to them. Because they\nwould have taken us to Siberia if they found weapons, you know. And it \u2014 and I\nrealized that now 1s the end of that life. I \u2014 I realized it completely. And then later,\nwhen we were being taken, which I told you before \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, you will talk about, but you see, this was the realization. Remember, I\nwas 13 years old, I was small and everything, and all of a sudden I realized that\neverything\u2019s gone. It\u2019s not mine \u2014 where \u2014 where they take the land away from\nyou. They left us, I think, with 30 acres or something like that, a small field. I\u2014 my\nfather lost his hand, I had to do the plowing, I had to do the sowing, I had to ca \u2014\nJune 20, 2014\nthey say, cut, you know. I had to feed the cows, my sister was milking the cows.\nWe couldn\u2019t have workers, our workers actually were bandits it turned out. There\nwere seven sons and we had the family, and when their \u2014 it broke out, they went \u2014\nthere were a lot of bandits there, because there was no Polish police, there was no\nRussian police, and people started robbing. And they \u2014 I played with the boy, there\nwas one, he was the youngest son over there in that family. And his brother was\ncleaning his gun and he shot through a wall and ripped out the stomach of that boy,\nand that boy died. And they took him to Felcher(ph), you know, the closest help,\nbut there was nothing that can be done. I remember that boy died. So you know, all\nof a sudden, things started going all wrong, you know, all wrong.",
        "A: Oh, my family, of course, they were talking all the time, a-all the time.",
        "A: Well, we heard Hitler screaming on the radio all the time, you know, when he\nwas shouting and everything. And wi \u2014 Russia we knew, we were afraid of Russia\nbecause we had a lot of local communists. There were Polish communists, there\nwere Jewish communists, you know, over there, a lot of \u2014 I mean, Jews were\nJune 20, 2014\ncommunists, a lot of Poles were communists. Some people had all of sudden\nmoney, and you knew that it must be coming from Russia, because Russia was\nexporting car loads, I understand of gold for propaganda and everything. So you\nheard about it. There was police trouble, my mother went to governor\n[indecipherable] he later became president of \u2014 of Poland in London, and he told\nme well, it\u2019s probably a [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know how \u2014 what you say\n[indecipherable] that at police station we consider very suspicious that they are\npro-Bolshevik, you know, but we cannot do anything to them, we have to prove it,\nyou know.",
        "A: Well, you had trouble, I don\u2019t know, like was some friction you know, in \u2014 in\neverything. You n\u2014 you know th-this is what, if you could like, Jewish people used\nto come from Warsaw for vacation, like that doctor. They were stupid, they,\ninstead of talking to a peasant, with a little store or something, a prusha(ph)\npanna(ph), you know, and something like this, they s \u2014 they used to say gtupi, like\nstupid, to them. Eventually they started pulling knives out, you know, because they\ngot insulted. It\u2019s the same thing the way the British treated people in Africa, you\nknow, they were calling them, hey boy do this, hey boy, do that. It\u2019s the same\nJune 20, 2014\nthing, you know. And you don\u2019t do it to people. You have to treat everybody with\nrespect. That\u2019s what I was told by my parents, that you treat everybody with\nrespect, never give them a reason, you know, to be mean to you.",
        "A: Well [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think we knew. We \u2014 we knew later what happened, but I don\u2019t\nknow why Hitler was afraid to allow \u2014 to a-attack Poland alone. While Pilsudski\nwas alive, we knew he wouldn\u2019t do it. When Pilsudski died, they said, well, Hitler\nis not scared of Pilsudski any more. He \u2014 he had a mental block because he beat\nthe hell out of them, too, out of the Germans. So we knew that there was bad, but\nwe didn\u2019t know about \u2014 there was talk, and there was strange \u2014",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Pilsudski was the Marshall of Poland.\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: H-He died in, what was it, \u00b036 - \u00b037 he died. And I remember we didn\u2019t like him\ntoo much, we didn\u2019t like his politics, but they said now is big trouble because he \u2014\nwe \u2014 they knew that Hitler had his \u2014 you know superstitious or something, and\nthen he \u2014 I si\u2014 I know now, you know, Litvinov was thrown out because he was\nJewish, and they put Molotov and \u2014 Molotov and Ribbentrop decided to attack\ntogether. So first the Germans attacked, then the Russians. But you see, you hear\nabout Poland so much, but you don\u2019t realize that after the campaign, Hitler in\nPoland, for almost for a year he had to regroup his armies and everything, and then\nhe went after England, Belgium and everything. He almost didn\u2019t make war. He\ncouldn\u2019t attack anybody. They say his losses in Poland were tremendous.",
        "A: Because Poland had anti-tank weapon, and we wanted to make call \u2014 call in,\nyou know, reserves all. And England and France said don\u2019t do it, because it will\nprovoke Hitler, so then don\u2019t do it. So its mobilization started two days before\nHitler attacked. And Hitler attacked accusing Poland that Polish troops went and\nattacked the radio station in Germany, and that\u2019s what he told the Germans, that he\nsends the army over there, and they came. But they couldn\u2019t even distribute the\nweapon, because Poland had something like a bazooka to destroy tank, and it was\nthere, where they found it, Germany suffered tremendous losses, because those\nJune 20, 2014\ntanks weren\u2019t good, they had to start redesigning the tanks, because they were\ndestroying them. But \u2014",
        "A: The west.",
        "A: And about two weeks later, Russia came from the east. And Russia came, I\u2019m\ntelling you, they had strings on their horses. They came with the tanks that \u2014 with\nthe lamp post and the tank would burn, but they kept coming and coming and\ncoming. There were so many Russians that came over. I\u2019Il tell you something\nbetter. To Patesha(ph), to my grandfather\u2019s house, some Russian soldiers came\nover and they said [speaks foreign language here] Pani(ph), you know, when are\nyou going to come back? They were from that region over there, and they \u2014",
        "A: From where my mother, and they came over there and they were asking\nPani(ph), when are wa \u2014 when are you going to come back, Pani(ph)?",
        "A: And those were Russians soldiers.",
        "A: Yeah. Never over there \u2014\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: \u2014 because they were better off. They were living better off there. Russia was\nsomething \u2014 because they didn\u2019t know about the west, you know. K-Karl Marx\nand Lenin and Trotsky, they all promise people everything. They said we will be\nparadise. And when you live in Siberia, in the remote areas, I told you, those\npeople didn\u2019t know anything.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t know, they thought \u2014 Francesca has a brother-in-law, a Russian\nfrom Crimea, he married. And he says, wa \u2014 we lived there, but we didn\u2019t see\nanything better. We thought everybody lives like that.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, we probably had, but I cannot tell you. Then Stalin gave Wilno to\nLithuanians, and we were in Lithuanian region. So I was living in grandmother\u2019s\nhouse in Wilno, and I was going to gymnasium. So \u2014",
        "A: So that was a very good period for us again, you see? Very good period.\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: Well, it was normal.",
        "A: It was normal life, except you didn\u2019t want to get in the mess somewhere with\n[indecipherable] who hated Poles, if you came in somewhere, and there was\nsomebody living, and somebody else was living, they said [speaks foreign\nlanguage here] Polish pigs don\u2019t live here.

        "A: Siauliai.",
        "A: I\u2014I cannot tell you, it was a party of people, Lithuanian, you know, it was a\nparty. They were against Poles, against everything. They used to come in even to\nthe cathedral to beat up the people when they were singing \u2014",
        "A: [indecipherable] return Poland to us, you know.",
        "A: It was trouble, but otherwise it was all right. Police was fantastic. We had a\u2014 wa\n\u2014 carriage stolen before the war, and Lithuanians, when they came, policeman\nJune 20, 2014\ncame and he told us that \u2014 and my father told them, you know, they were asking,\nanything stolen? Yeah, my father said, before the war. In about two weeks, they\nhad it. They took my father there and they said, here is your carriage. One day we\nwoke up and we had about 60 or 70 chickens, you know\u201d?",
        "A: And we come in and there are no chickens, everything was stolen. By evening,\nLithuanian police had it. They were very effective, and they were very effective\nwith thieves, because they got scared, because the Lithuanian police used to put\nwet sheets and beat the hell out of the people. And they said, you know, across the\nkidneys and everything. So they found out that stealing doesn\u2019t pay. And the Polish\nrule is like in America you do. When \u2014 when the \u2014 and you know how it 1s with\nstealing; if you steal a loaf of bread, you\u2019re a thief. If you steal a million dollars,\nwell, you defrauded somebody. But if you steal 10 million dollars, or 20 million, ah\nkleptomania, he\u2019s sick. Tha-That\u2019s the law in America, you don\u2019t go to jail. Let\nstockholders pay, like in America.",
        "A: I \u2014 that is unbelievable. And then, you know, this came and then there \u2014 the\nperiod went very fast. We had that thing in Wilno then, the [indecipherable]\nKiersnowski, that was mine [indecipherable] he came first and he opened a\nJune 20, 2014\nnightclub, who \u2014 called [indecipherable]. So there was freedom, you know. And\nthen his wife [indecipherable] cross, in the winter she got very hard time crossing\nthe river. They came over and they said \u2014",

She married Count Iscaris(ph) and he, my cousin\nwas writing songs for her, you know, for the show and everything, so it was very\nsuccessful. And then I don\u2019t know how they got permission to go to Vladivostok,\nto Japan. She had connections with gemeinde. And then I met her father finally, in\nAmerica when they came here in the show. They were \u2014 all the Jews in New York\nwere there, writing in that show. It was itwee \u2014 and it was \u2014 it was good life 0 \u2014 at\nthat period, and then all of a sudden, I remember they came, and they arrested us,\nand we were taking, and people were kneeling down along the road, and praying\nfor us \u2014",

        "A: Polish people, the rus \u2014 well, there was one Jewish NKVD officer, a Polish\ncommunist and two Russian soldiers. And they came early in the morning, they\nknocked on the doors, you know, and th \u2014 and they told us to pack. But I told you\nabout my sister before, my sister was packed, because she had dreams that the man\ncomes here to prepare your things, you\u2019re going to go for a long trip. She already\nhad that thing that happened in Russia with her, but she was packed. And then th-\nthey \u2014 th-they took us to \u2014 to the station, and in Charnibor(ph), my mother\u2019s sister\ncame with her husband and two daughters, and they brought our grandmother, and\nshe was an old, old woman. She had a broken hip, and he \u2014 we begged the Russians\nnot to take them, and they finally let her stay in Poland. And \u2014 and Korfs(ph) were\nthere, and then \u2014",
        "A: Korf(ph) too, Baron Korf(ph) was there too, brought in there. And then they\nput us in trucks and they took us to Nowa Vileka(ph) and in Nowa Vileka(ph) they\nseparated the men.

The other ones were thrown out from the railroad,\nbecause they were on the railroads when they die in cars, so they just opened the\ndoor and they threw the bodies into the tundra somewhere, I don\u2019t know.\nJune 20, 2014",

You\ntake care, you survive Russia. I will not survive. And his last words were, when I\nwas \u2014 I told you [speaks Polish], remember, Russia doesn\u2019t like tears. Don\u2019t ever,\never show a Russian that you\u2019re afraid. And he was so right, later on in life I found\nout, because when they arrested me I told them, what the hell can you do to me? I\nsaid, you took my father away, you took me to Siberia, we\u2019re hungry, we have no\nJune 20, 2014\nheat, we have nothing. What do you do?

So\nwe were lying, but you had to lie on the side, because you couldn\u2019t lie on your\nback, there was no room. And sitting was a disaster. And they cut a little hole in the\nJune 20, 2014\nfloor for you to go and relieve yourself, as a toilet. But somehow, the people had\nsome blankets, so they put some strings around and they put blanket around, so you\nhad privacy. Only twice they allowed us to \u2014 off the train, for in three weeks that\nwe were going. Let me tell you, you \u2014 you never \u2014 you never know the stor \u2014 the\nsight of people, who when after weeks of sitting, lock, and not being able to walk,\nget out.

But you have to remember, I was 13 - 14, and\nwhat did I know, you know, I didn\u2019t know much, except that I helped quite a lot as\na child, at the parties, at meetings. My uncle was a senator, you know, so I heard a\nlot about politics always, and my grandfather was involved in parties, you know,\npolitical parties and everything. So we heard a lot of what was going on.\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t tell you.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t tell you. I think one of the thing was that he once blew a train and\nsold the money. Or da \u2014 it was Russian money, or Austrian money, I don\u2019t know,\nbut the family was talking that that\u2019s stealing. That that\u2019s im-improper, you cannot\nsteal. You know, I \u2014 they were talking about it. Pilsudski had a very hard life\nbecause his sister used to come and sit in my grandfather\u2019s house. On the deck\nthere were flowers. Oh, it was so beautiful over there, You cannot imagine how\nmany flowers, agave, you know, was growing, and everything. Palms, little. And\nsh-she was talking and she was saying that you know, when you are in the\ngovernment like my brother is, they print special papers for him. He cannot even\nget the news. I can tell you what\u2019s going on in the country, but they \u2014 other groups,\nyou know, they surround you. They are like plague, you don\u2019t know. You have\nadvisors, I guess in every government it\u2019s the same thing, you know, they \u2014 th-they\n\u2014 they \u2014 they do everything. But she was saying that it\u2019s a famous building in\nWarsaw, dom bez kantow. Kant means a corner, but 1t also means without\ncheating. So they said when they were building this building, they came to\nPilsudski and said, well, build one building bez kantow. Build one building\nwithout cheating, you know. And they cut off the corner, it\u2019s said to this day you\nJune 20, 2014\ncan go on computer and you write dom bez kantow and they show it in Warsaw,\nthe home. And this became famous dom bez kantow. So you know, it\u2019s not easy to\nbe a ruler.",
        "A: Because you don\u2019t know what influences you, or what goes on. I tell you, the\nRussian people that we met, a lot of them were very, very nice, you know\u201d? But\nwhen we went south in Siberia, there were Mongols, but over there it became\nmuch worse, because the people were hungry already.\nyou were on the train, did you ever get any announcement, or any paper, or\nanything from those people who arrested you, as to why you were being deported\nand where you were being taken?",
        "A: No, no, they didn\u2019t talk to us.",
        "A: Oh, we knew why, because the tsars used to do it. They \u2014 once you go to\nSiberia you saw all kinds of people, Germans, Ukrainians, they used to call\n[indecipherable], T'artars from Crimea they were deporting over there. They were\ndeporting people for years. This is one procedure in Russia, take people and send\nthem to Siberia, it\u2019s empty. You know, you were going for days on, and you hardly\nJune 20, 2014\nsaw a little station, where they only had water and maybe some coal for the\nrailroad, and the train. It was a \u2014 it\u2019s like ano man\u2019s land, you go and go and\nthere\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s a disaster. And then, in some places they build like\n[indecipherable] the soil was very good, you know. But this was funny. I\u2019Il tell\nyou something; we were there, I never saw a rabbit, I never saw a fox, I never saw\nany animal alive or dead. Whether they ate them when they were starving, when\nthere was starvation in the [indecipherable] you know, or \u2014 or what, I don\u2019t know.\nBecause I was fr \u2014 with a friend Fruzhinski(ph) later in India and he was working\nin sulfur mine and there was a lot of gold. And the mine, being broken, pressed his\nchest in. He couldn\u2019t be 1n the army, you know, he had a hole \u2014 hole in there. And\nhe said that that mine, all the Russians were laughing because Americans came in\nthe 30s, engineers, and they developed that mine. And he said, how stupid\nAmericans are. Don\u2019t \u2014 Russians were saying, don\u2019t they know how secretive\nRussians are? Of course they had an accident and they buried them over there.\nOnce the mine was open [indecipherable] America the worst place in Russia,\ngold mine, and the worst concentration camp, where if you lasted two years you\nwere lucky, they \u2014 you froze, it\u2019s na \u2014 close to Alaska. That was be \u2014 opened up\nwith American help. How about [indecipherable], the city Volga(ph)? Volga(ph)\nwas built by all this \u2014 a fort. So you know, America did all the business they could,\nJune 20, 2014\nand they say Russia was starving its people, selling its food and trying to get\nmachinery and everything from America. And America did business with them,\ncapitalists, what do they care? They don\u2019t care whether hundred million people\ndied. To hell, as long as I make my million, that\u2019s my opinion. I don\u2019t know\nwhether I should say that, but as long as you can make money, it\u2019s all right. You\nsee, brokerage houses, when I started, were private companies, they were\npartnership. And if they were doing business, they were very, very afraid. If they\nmade something wrong, it was their pocket. And then they allowed them to become\ncorporation. So now people who run corporation can steal, make themselves rich,\nand if they get punish, who pays the stockholder? The stockholders are punished,\nand they lose the money.",

        "A: And then from there we went by carriage to the village where we were. And as I\ntold you, we were very lucky that we were not sent to collective farm, or some\nmine, or bri \u2014 bricklayers place where they make. But we were in a village. The\npeople were very nice to us. The NK VD didn\u2019t bother us. The only thing the\nbastards did to us, they came to our house, and my sister hid everything in the\nstove, in ashes; pictures that we had, and papers. And my aunt was afraid, and \u2014 my\nmother\u2019s sister, she was stupid, she told them about it and they took all our pictures\nof my father, of the youth, you know, we had a lot of pictures from Poland, album.\nAnd they took everywhere, and they took all the coffee books. We had those coffee\nbook with watermarks. When they saw watermark, ration NK VD, they never saw\nit, they say [speaks foreign language here] we\u2019re German spies, right away they\nsaid, because you have watermarks on paper. So they think this is for sending\nmessages. They never saw anything like this. They were very poor. You know,\nwhen Russians march into Poland we used to ask them, oranges [indecipherable]\nJune 20, 2014\noranges? And they said, oh yeah, we have factories, they make them. That was the\nstandard answer. They didn\u2019t know what it was. Because I never saw sugar in\nRussia once. No, I saw one Russian woman \u2014 officer, having a piece of sugar, she\nwas eating it with water. But that was the only time I saw sugar. I never saw sugar\nin Russia. So it was \u2014 1t was in \u2014 inhuman land, it was inhuman country, and I\nthink it is to this day. They said [indecipherable] there was Radio Moscow here, I\nwas listening and they were talking, men all drinking, smoking. Trains you cannot\ntravel. There are no roads to drive on, you know. And that was \u2014 that report is from\nMoscow saying. You know, that \u2014 it was \u2014 it was bad.",

And I never saw anything so big, it was tremendous. And then they\nturned around, and we went south, you know, to Barnaul. Then I saw much more\nof southern Russia when we were released already.\nJune 20, 2014",

I\ndon\u2019t know, it was pretty far a whole day. And we came to that village, and si \u2014\nthere was an empty house with two rooms. There was \u2014 in one room there was a\nstove, and there was a little like place where they did something, so there was wood\non building. So we used to take that wood and burn in the stove.

And if you \u2014 next time, you run,\nbecause otherwise I\u2019Il go to jail for not arresting you. The Russians were all\nrunning away, and he told me, you have to run.

They were so curious that you [indecipherable]\nthere was nobody around us, you know \u2014\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: \u2014 but he pleaded with me, next time if you come to take the pines \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 take the pines, but run like a crazy when I come, because they\u2019 ll arrest me, and\nPll go to jail. Then I told you about kerosene.",
        "A: I went \u2014 well, no, I have to start that a little different story. This is another story.\nWhen the Russian woman with the daughter came to us already in that little house,\nand she ask whether my sister has any dresses to sell because the daughter is\ngetting married, and she would like to have a nice dress.",
        "A: And my sister says, well, I can sell you one dress. And \u2014 and the girl was there,\nyou know, they measured my sister. Okay, I'll re-sew it a little, I'll correct it for\nyou. And she \u2014 the minute she left, neighbors of ours in those buildings came and\nsaid, watch out. He is the chief communist for the whole area. Top communist,\nthat\u2019s his wife. Be very careful what you do with them. They are big communists.\nAnd then she came few days later, she picked up the dress and she took my mother\nand sister to their house. And listen the story about their house. They walk in, they\nhad bars on the doors and on the windows, they were so afraid. And he told my\nmother, my family, before the revolution was fairly well-off. And I decided that I\nJune 20, 2014\nwon\u2019t raise my family in poverty. So I joined the party and I became a communist\nand I am the head of this district. And he was very nice, and he said look, probably\nthe Germans will come here.

So when his son went to school, they gave me that job. And once a\nday you got food over there, so you know, what a privilege it was in that place.\nAnd we didn\u2019t have kerosene for lamp. And I came to him once, he was sitting \u2014 he\nwas the manager of the whole place, and I said to him [speaks foreign language\nhere] because in Russian it\u2019s kerosene, too, and I made mistake, 1n Polish we say\nnafta(ph), in Russian \u2014 so he said [speaks foreign language] Well, and he told me\nthat I cannot give it to you.

And well, we\u2019re deported here, and he\nstarted talking with me, and he was the guy who told me he couldn\u2019t believe that\nwe had farms, that we had property. Nobody has property. And then we tell him to\nAmerica and he says, can you amer \u2014 can you imagine those strikes in America?\nPeople rather die than work in America. They go on strike, because see in Russia,\nif you went on a strike, they would have killed you. So here was \u2014 they were\nreading in America \u2014 in their Russian papers about the strikes in America. That\u2019s\nhow they were interpreting, that those people were so poor that they\u2019d rather die.",

And there were \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nwhere the other Poles came, you know, they were engineers and everything. They\nhad no idea how to cut the tree down. I had to teach them, because I grew up on a\nfarm and I saw how \u2014 how workers were cutting the tree, and which way the tree\nfalls and every \u2014 they had no idea. I had to teach them, you know, I used to walk\naround, big \u2014 big guy, I had big shoes. I had big shoes because Germans shot up a\ntrain not far from our home, and the next thing we had [indecipherable] soldiers\nwore big shoes, and their shoes were long. And oh God, in Russia, when I had the\nax, I hit it, the shoe, I thought I cut off my fingers \u2014 my toes, but the shoe was\nmuch too large, so I didn\u2019t cut off my legs. But I thought \u2014 was afraid that I cut off.\nThey had very good steel. Oh, the steel was fantastic, the axes and everything. You\nsee, we had to make so many two yards long, like \u2014 like two meters long, maybe\nmeter wide, like this, and maybe a meter high. Wood, we had to cut it in pieces,\nand put it. And every day we had to \u2014 we had a norm, how many we had to do. So,\nwe figured very fast way, cut wood in small pieces, and on the ends we put small\nJune 20, 2014\npieces, then everything is empty inside, and we cover with the logs on top, and the\nRussian \u2014",

About\nweek later, or in 10 days, she comes over to my sister and she says, Ganichka(ph),\nI saved your life, I did everything I could for you. How could you do it to me? If\nyou told me that my son is dead, it would have been all right, but I got a m-message\nfrom the government that my son died, and all my friends told me that you told him\nthat he died, how could you do this to me?

        "A: Yeah. Women were desperate. There were \u2014 there was a girl which \u2014\nMarusha(ph), which used to give us our bread, couple of slices of bread a day.

They were\nJune 20, 2014\n\u2014 they were desperate, you know, to get, and the hell, I was a small boy, you know.\nI told you, I didn\u2019t grow. And I was afraid of the women.",
        "A: But it was something. So anyway, where was I now?",
        "A: Yeah, in co \u2014 the carriage came in and they told us to go \u2014 get in and we\u2019re\ngoing to NK VD. And we came to NK VD and NKVD said, well, you are free now.",
        "A: That was the contract which Sikorski, Stalin and everything were going to form\nPolish army, and there will be trains going south in Siberia and they will organize\nPolish army over there. So if you want to go, go. We would advise you not to go\nbecause there will be starvation over there. We have food over there. But we didn\u2019t\nlisten, and you know \u2014",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Oh, no.\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: Oh yeah. It was in every \u2014 on every station, they had the picture of the\n[indecipherable] German, with the big tail and big nails like this, all over Russia.\nIt appeared on every railroad station. That\u2019s why we \u2014 that\u2019s how we found out that\nthe war broke out, because they came with those pictures. And believe me, some of\nthe people over there were asking us deep in Siberia whether the Germans really\nlooked like that. And later on, a lot of Germans from Volga River were taken by\nStalin and sent to Siberia, too.",
        "A: Because during Catherine the Great, a lot of Germans were settled over there.\nSo the \u2014 they took them over to Siberia.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And you know what our biggest problem was then?",
        "A: America.\nJune 20, 2014",

You know, are they\ngoing to be on the side of the allies like Russia and England and France, and \u2014 or\nare they going to be on the side of Germany? Nobody was sure. And then, thank\nGod when we heard, okay, Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and the news came.\nNow Japanese solved the problem. They said now America will have to go to war.",
        "A: That\u2019s what the \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. Because you know, like Kennedy\u2019s father, he wanted to be on German\nside, you know, a lot of Americans, they didn\u2019t want to be in a war. The war \u2014 the\ndraft in America started one day before Pearl Harbor. Americans didn\u2019t want to\ngo to war, they were only selling weapons and recession ended, depression in\nAmerica ended, because they started selling weapon, and America came out\nbecause of that war from depression. America was in awful depression. People in\nthe office told me they used to bring food to people, and often they used to enter\napartments in New York and people were dead already from starvation. They told\nme this was awful starvation in America too, during the depression.\nJune 20, 2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: We knew there was a war, so we thought that there is [indecipherable] because\nthe news was coming that there was Polish contacts already with Russian\ngovernment and everything. So you \u2014 you knew \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that something was going on, just like about Katyn forest. There was a news\nin Poland that nobody knew what happened, but you see, at a period, no more\nletters were coming from there, and nobody knew what happened. So the Poles\nsuspected that they were killed, but nobody could say. And then Germans came in\nthere, and when the Germans came, America and England said that 1t was made\nby the German, Katyn forest, and that the Germans killed, because they couldn\u2019t\ninsult Uncle Joe. Because they were afraid that Uncle Joe will go back and join\nJune 20, 2014\nwith Germany again, maybe. You know, this was very complicated, I think. We\nwere afraid of many things.

So what do you \u2014 just because you live in white\nhouses, you think you can steal? I said well, I need heat and I don\u2019t have heat. And\nhe started screaming at me like hell.

Now, what happened in Russia, I\ndon\u2019t know, but the American army has some excuse to do something in case\nsomething happens, and they flew over Russia, and of course the Russians \u2014\nEisenhower was told by America that Russians can shoot U-2 any time they want.\nThat\u2019s not [indecipherable] they have the rocket, and they shot U-2 with this pilot\nPower, American Power.

        "A: \u2014 bread in my pants, hiding as much as I could. And then they put us on the\ntrain. And we came to ma \u2014 Paklevy(ph). It took two days to cross Novotsk(ph).\nThere was very little water, lines and lines of people to get water, you know. And\nsome Polish soldiers are troopers, and they told us, bring some vodka for us. But I\nnever went, but they were giving \u2014 and the Russians told us, if we catch anybody\nentering on the ship with Russian money, you go back to Siberia. So you know,\nthere were bags filled in, and there were two kinds of rubles. There were ordinary\nrubles and Chervonsa. Chervonsa were the money that could use in Iran, actually\nbuy something.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, it must have been convertible. You see, I don\u2019t understand at that\ntime, but I must have had some, because when we came to over there, to\nPaklevy(ph), they were talking in Russian a lot. You know, the Persians knew how\nto speak Russians, and they were selling varenyye yaytsa, boiled eggs. But\nvarenyye to us in Polish it says like crow\u2019s eggs, because those eggs were so small,\nbut they were cooked. So we were \u2014 I and Puskotski(ph), we were throwing out\nthe whites and we were only eating the yellow one, to plug up for diarrhea, because\nJune 20, 2014\nwe were running to the toilet all the time, you know. But on that ship when we\nwere, I told you, we were on the front and the whole front of the ship, there were\nPolish Jews. And there was no water, and they only gave us herrings to eat\n[indecipherable]. So we were all day lining with little cups, because there was one\nfaucet by the captain\u2019s, you know, deck, and we were carrying water to those\npeople, it was awful. And once we came there, they threw at us, dates. Po-Polish\nsoldiers were on [indecipherable] and they came \u2014 the ship was too big to go out,\nand there was a storm. So they came \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to eat dates ever, you know,\nafter that, because we ate so many dates, we were hungry. And then they took us\noff that ship, and the next day [indecipherable] I don\u2019t remember what happened,\nthey drove us to tur \u2014 to Paklevy(ph), and I saw stores with meat, with bread, with\neverything. I was sure it\u2019s propaganda. I said, it\u2019s impossible. I wouldn\u2019t \u2014 I\ncouldn\u2019t believe that somebody has bread and food and meat in this store. We\ndidn\u2019t believe it, you know? It\u2019s \u2014 you get so brainwashed, you know, it\u2019s so easy.\nAnd then they shaved us, they cut our hair and I don\u2019t know what the hell they did\nwith us.

You know, I don\u2019t know how much, but one Polish officer came and we\nask him whether he could go outside of that camp and bring us some fruits. And he\nsaid, boys, it costs money. They say, how much do you want? His eyes almost\nrolled over how much. But then I had that stupid dream again, with the bread.",

Th-They curse something awful, fuck you God\u2019s mother and things like\nthis, you know. And this \u2014 there was a Polish guy with us, and he started cursing at\nthose Russians the same way. And they say [speaks foreign language] Friend,\nwhy are you cursing? And they made him an accountant in the village. You see the\nresult? [foreign language] Th-Th-Th-They\u2019re peculiar people.

You are way, way up on the mountain. You look\nstraight down and you see buses and trucks and everything, destroyed, lying, cars\nthat fell down. Nobody bothered to fix it even. You know, nobody looked for it. It\nwas a scary like hell. And you know, Persians used to smoke hashish or something,\ntoo, and they were driving with their legs often, and when they were coming to a\nturn, they didn\u2019t slow down, but they used to blow the horn.

And it\nwas very nice, we were driving \u2014 this road wasn\u2019t so bad, going that way.

And that letter \u2014 censor was \u2014\nmixed up the letters, sent a letter to me, one to the camp commander. And the letter\nwith the \u2014 my father\u2019s death came to me in the letter, because all the letter was\ncensored during the war. So somehow the letters got transferred, and then I found\nout my father is dead. I knew very little, you know. I came to a company\ncommander. I even have his picture here, in the \u2014 in the company where I was,\nbecause it was \u2014 you know, but this was for boys.

They told me \u2014 everybody told me that my\n114June 20, 2014\nfather had no hand, so he couldn\u2019t work, so they made him a night watchman. And\na Jewish man came to be the camp commander, and he was the son of a bitch, he\nremoved my father from rations, from food. He said [speaks foreign language],\nyou don\u2019t work, you don\u2019t eat. So my father was living on what other soldiers were\nbringing him, pieces of potatoes, pieces of bread, and things like this. And my\nfather was always saying that in life you can\u2019t deny two things; that you\u2019ll be in\njail, and you di \u2014 you will be a beggar. And he was like a beggar at the end.

When you think of all of these \u2014 all the things it could have been, and turned\nout opposite.",
        "A: And then when we found about Teheran and everything, oh my God, the\nconferences. When no Polish people wanted to believe my mother about, because\nPolish people didn\u2019t know about Teheran conference, what was in there.",

And\nmy mother said well, I hope we are going return to Poland. He says, you can\u2019t.\nStalin a-and [indecipherable] just made a deal, Poland goes to Russia. So better\ngo somewhere else. And so we told all the Polish people what\u2019s going on, none of\nthem wanted to believe it. But it from \u2014 my mother got it from an officer. I told you\nthat the difference was that she knew languages, she could contact people. I\nremember when she came in Karachi she said she came to the camp, and she went\nto see the camp commander, and he was sitting with his legs on the table, and my\nJune 20, 2014\nmother walked in. When I walk in a room, please take your feet down and put them\non the floor, she told the British camp commander. And she had guts.",
        "A: From then on, he was so polite, and he right away knew that he has to do\nsomething else with her other thing. But you couldn\u2019t do much with the Polish\npeople, because they were all talking about democracy. There was an old woman,\nfriend of ours, and we had only a bench, a table and a bed, you know. And she \u2014\nmy mother went to ask him for a chair for her, easy chair, you know, to sit down.\nWell, he got my \u2014 for that woman Parneechee(ph) Lesker(ph), a easy chair. My\nGod, there was almost a riot in the camp by Polish people. What is this? What is\nthis? We\u2019re a democracy and you give somebody an easy chair to sit. They were\njealous.",
        "A: And they were so jealous when we were traveling first class wherever we were\ngoing, when \u2014 on the ship, you know, because of being an interpreter. And then\nwhen we were coming in to India, when we were, there was a horseman, British\nIndian colonel. And my mother ask him why do you serve in British army? And he\nsays, well, we have to learn how to fight. Otherwise, the British never get out from\nIndia. He says, we are going to war to learn how to fight. Ah, that was something.\n117June 20, 2014",

And he never answer my mother, but the order came from\nhim, to put me on medical commission, discharge me and send me to Teheran. So\nthey discharged me and they send me to Teheran. And I came, and finally I met\nmy mother, and I was shocked. I was so shocked, because when I was in Russia, I\nwas like this, and I looked at my mother and my sister like this. And I came back\nfrom Palestine, I look, here\u2019s my mother and here\u2019s my sister. I grew up so much. I\nwas so shaken up, because my mother wasn\u2019t big, and my sister wasn\u2019t big, and I\nremember them so much bigger than I. And with all this to think, you know, what\n118June 20, 2014\nwas it, about two year, a year and a half period, I grew up so much. I was so\nshocked when I saw that my mother is so small.",

Don\u2019t ask me anything. Please don\u2019t ask me. Just leave me alone. And this\nAmerican said please. Another soldier said, what\u2019s the matter? Tell him. Well, he\nsaid, are you going to Burma tomorrow? Yes. And you will be killed the next day.\nHe was a pilot. He says, you are a pilot and you will be killed the next day. You\nwant to know, I'll tell you now. Can you imagine how that man felt? And this I\nremember to this day, this Indian fellow said, I don\u2019t want to tell you \u2014 and he says,\nall of a sudden, are you going to Burma today? He says yeah. He says, tomorrow\nyou will be killed, as a pilot. And to \u2014 1t \u2014 it was so shocking to me, you know.",

Instead of bombing Germans,\nthey were bombing Polish position. And, you know, everybody was afraid of\nfriendly fire, he said, next to Americans. They\u2019re irresponsible. I remember on the\nday I was drafted into the army, they gave us rifles. And you know, you don\u2019t pull\nthe trigger in the rifle, you don\u2019t fool around.

They\nwere all crying and I remember in Korea when we went, they put us into a barrack\nmade from cans, you know, and barbed wire around, and it stunk like hell because\nKoreans were hanging octopus and everything to dry on the barbed wire. So thank\nGod I had some other cologne, so I used to put on that cologne when I had to walk\nover there.

And sometimes, in the evening \u2014 and there were bathrooms on the first\nfloor, so sometimes at night we woke up, and I would go down.

Th-Th-Th-The world is crazy. They did a lot of bad.\nAnd when you are \u2014 when I think of the Spanish war, they did it in South\nAmerica, killing, slavering, everything. A-Americans came, British\n[indecipherable] Indians, who are savages, let\u2019s kill all the Indians, you know.",
        "A: Well, [Il tell you something, always expect that something better will come.\nWhen you get old, you lose it already, you know, but when you young, you look\nand you strive, you know. Like I went to NYU six years at night. But I was \u2014 I\nknew I was getting somewhere. There were people telling me, you stupid going to\nschool. I said, oh yes, I\u2019m stupid. I had a girlfriend, very nice, and she told me, you\nstupid going to NYU. I said, well, but I\u2019m going to study, and I\u2019m going to finish\n163June 20, 2014\nthis school. And you know, there were a lot of things in life, and you always look\nfor something. And I had one big objective, that I had my father who told me, take\ncare of your mother and your sister. And I took care of them. My sister died in\n2001, you know, and to the last day I always took care of her, and I did everything\nthat I could to help my sister, my mother. And you know, my cousin, responsibility\nfor that. And also, in my life, 1t was funny, but I took care of other people. I was \u2014\nwe were drafted into American army, and there was a Ukrainian fellow sleeping\nabout me, and he started complaining that he has stomachache. So I said, give me\nyour knee. I pulled his knee, oh, appendicitis. So I ran to the company headquarters\nand I said, get me an ambulance quickly, we have to take this fellow for operation.\nThey told me, who do you know, what do you know, you think you stupid or\nsomething, he\u2019s goldbricking. So I went back, I waited 15 - 20 minutes, I came\nback. You know, we\u2019re going to sue you if he dies. He may die soon. They called\nambulance, straight from the barrack on the operating table, it was appendicitis.\nThere was a fellow in Korea, and he used to stand and burn his legs, and I realized\nthat he was so depressed, that he didn\u2019t pain, because we had those Coleman\nstoves. So, how to help him? He had very thick glasses. So I said, put your thick\nglasses right next to your bag, and in the morning step on them and crush them.\nAnd he crushed them. Doctors didn\u2019t pay attention, nobody. They send him to\n164June 20, 2014\nJapan, and of course he was sent back home. He was a mental case, you know.\nLook at my wife. She conks out on me on the lawn, and I give CPR and I don\u2019t\nknow what the hell I do, but she\u2019s alive.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: But \u2014 but you know, you have things in life, and I like to give people help. Not\neverybody likes help. She objects to me when I talk to my cousin, but I try to help\nthem. They argue with me, you know. But I have more knowledge about certain\nthings than they have, and I try to give it to them. What they re \u2014 they refuse it,\nthey fight it, but eventually they\u2019ll take it. Eventually they\u2019ll take it. You try to tell\npeople, this is what\u2019s important in life, this is what you do. And you know, a lot of\npeople gave up, a lot of people give up. We saw this \u2014 I tell you, I saw one thing;\nJewish people give up very fast. They break down. We saw them breaking down\nmore than we were breaking down, you know. I really saw that in my Jewish\npeople. I don\u2019t know why.",
        "A: I\u2019m talking about Russia.\n165June 20, 2014",
        "A: They were weaker, I think. They were \u2014 somehow they didn\u2019t have the\nconsistency or something, and we \u2014 because we saw them covered with lice,\nstanding in line. Often we were trying to get the lice off; they didn\u2019t. And I\nunderstand that once a doctor walked through a hospital and \u2014 with a group of\nstudent doctors, and he asked them, which of these patients is the most sick, you\nknow, the sickest person. So one fellow said, well he \u2014 this one has this disease,\nthis one has this disease, this one has this disease. And the doctor said, you are all\nwrong. Look at him. There\u2019s a fly walking on his face, and he reacts already. He\ngave up. He\u2019s the sickest. And you know, people, if they \u2014 if they react, you know\n\u2014 and I was lucky that I had a mother that could help me so much, you know, she\nhelped me so, so much.",
        "A: In every way. With the English language, and with the getting me to the schools,\nyou know. I wouldn\u2019t be able, by myself to get. But for her, knowing the English,\nknowing the French, they recognize right away that she was of a different class.\nThe English respect the class very much, so you know, they were conscious, and\nthey saw it right away. And then I took advant \u2014 and I made a lot of friends. In life,\nI made a lot of friends. I tell you like in Karachi, we were \u2014 there was a club for\nBritish soldiers and diving and everything. I got to know the Canadian fellow who\n166June 20, 2014\nwas running. We used to steal Indian boats and go sailing, the two of us together.\nAnd then we\u2019d steal cookies and everything. And one time, maybe I told you that, I\ntold in Polish school that I take some boys, and they went with me over there. So in\nPolish school they didn\u2019t like me because I was go-going to this, to \u2014 in the school.",
        "A: So they loaded a bus or truck of children and they went over there, and they told\nthat we let them into that club. Of course, they threw them out. But the guys with\nme came, and they could swim and eat and everything, because I knew this fellow.\nYou know, so I made contact. I told you in American Red Cross I made contacts\nwith those soldiers, and I have everything. So I always had some money, you\nknow, for these things. Then I ran photography, and I started making money on\nphotography. You constantly had to figure out something. When I came to\nAmerica I had no money, so I took a course in radio and television, I started\nlearning how to do. And you know, and then I didn\u2019t finish it because I went to\nKorea. But I le \u2014 I learned so much about electricity that \u2014 you have to ask people,\nand you have to talk to people so much, because you learn something from\neverybody. Everybody teaches you something. Sicknesses. If you sick, learn from\nthem what are the symptoms, what you have and everything, so you know, and you\ncan tell somebody too, and you can help, you know. You cannot rely always on a\n167June 20, 2014\ndoctor only, because s-sometimes you know you have to know a lot of things, and\nthe more you can learn in life, the better for you in life. And I think that\u2019s what\ninterests me. The \u2014 only now, I have the seat [indecipherable] and I cannot do\nanything, and I say, and I \u2014",
        "A: Okay. W-Wait, P\u2019Il go and bring you some pizza.",
        "A: Thank you, thank you.\n168June 20, 2014\n"
