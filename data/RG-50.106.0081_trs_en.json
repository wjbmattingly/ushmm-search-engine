        "Question: \u2014 Holocaust Memorial Museum, volunteer collection interview with\nBella Pasternak, condus \u2014 conducted by Esther Finder, on October 22\", 1997, in\nRockville, Maryland. This is a follow-up interview to a United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum videotape interview conducted with Bella Pasternak on April\n21%, 1994. This is tape number one, side A. I\u2019d like to start by asking you about\nyour liberation experience. What was the moment of liberation like for you?",
        "Answer: Well, we got liberated by the Russians. We didn\u2019t know anything til the\nlagerfuehrer came in and told us we are freed. We didn\u2019t hear no noises, nothing.\nThe \u2014 the older SSs left, and we were surrounded only by the lagerfuehrer, who\nwas from Czechoslovakia, a girl, a Jewish girl. So we really don\u2019t know anything\nmuch about it. But the ru-ru-Russian government declared it liberated, and that\u2019s all\nwa \u2014 we knew [indecipherable].",
        "Q: When you heard that you were free, that you were liberated, what did that mean\nto you?",
        "A: We were in a small town. Because we were on the front line, we were given the\nammunition for the soldiers. So we were in a farm, in a \u2014 in a stable full of hay, that\nwe slept in. And when they came in and said we got liberated, everybody start\nrunning. This is the way it started. That was January 21\u201c, winter, cold, and we were\nOctober 22, 1997\nshivering in a barn. The first thing people went, and they were looking for food.\nEverybody grabbed what they find in the farm. They tried to get the milk from the\ncow, because the farmers just had left when we got there. The first thing that we did\nwas we \u2014 by the time we realized that there is no more food left, I grabbed a little\npig running in the stable. I took a fork, one that 1\u2014 cleaning the stables, and we\npunched into the pig, and with everything in it, we made a fi \u2014 bonfire and we sat\ndown, about 10 - 12 girls with potatoes and that\u2019s what was our first meal.\nEverybody was first laughing. I took my belt and I tie it around the pig after I\ncaught him, and I start to make a bonfire. So, got the heat, to warm up a little, and\nmaybe about an hour later, we all start eating on the pig. That was our first meal.\nAnd then we started up walking. We had no facilities, no cars, no bicycles, nothing.\nWhatever we had \u2014 we took our clothes that we had on us, nothing else, and we\nstart going towards the city. And when we got to the city, we asked the people how\nwe go down south. Got liberated in Estonia. And from there we walked, we start\nwalking. We walked from January to March. This is the way we got home, were no\ntransportation. Because we were offered a couple of rides from the Russians. We\nwere 10 girls, we are still in touch. One of them \u2014 two of them passed away since\nthen. Eight is still \u2014 we still talking occasionally together. One is in Canada, couple\nof them are in Brooklyn, couple of them in Israel I just visited. And we are in\nOctober 22, 1997\ntouch. The 10 of us made a group, and like a chain, we jumped from one\n[indecipherable] to another one, because there were no bridges. And this was the\nway we crossed the rivers. We went into houses, and whatever we found, we ate. In\ncertain houses, there was hot food on the stove, and I told them, don\u2019t eat, cause if\nit\u2019s hot, there must be poison in it. So we ate raw potatoes. We were sleeping during\nthe day, and we were running at night, because we were afraid of the Russians.\nThey picked us up once with a car, one girl went up the car and he start the motor\nrunning. So as soon as we see that they start rolling, we pulled her down from the\ntruck. And I said, no more lifts, we have to walk. And there was no trains,\neverything was banned. Nothing was going. So the only way we were able to go\nwas by foot. And wherever got dark, we start running. During the day, we were\nsleeping wherever we found a place, in a barn, in a house. Everything was opened.\nYou could go in any house, there was no people around there, until we got to\nPoland. And then already there we ask in Polish, that\u2019s all that we knew was,\n[speaks Polish here|",
        "Q: Translate for me, please.",
        "A: I don\u2019t speak Polish either. That\u2019s all Polish we know that we ask her, how many\nkilomete \u2014 kilometers is to the station. That\u2019s what we know Polish from the Polish\ngirls that we were in lager together. And they said there is no station. So we kept on\nOctober 22, 1997\nwalking, and we walked til March. Purim, just before Purim, we arrived to\nBudapest. And there already, we were home, because we spoke the language. We\nwere able to speak Hungarian, and we asked the first thing if there\u2019s a Jewish\nagency. And we were dir \u2014 were directed because Russian ha \u2014 occupied the\nterritory, and they told us that there is a communist government there, and we\nshould go to the office.",
        "Q: Did you get any assistance from the Russians along the way, after liberation?",
        "A: No. We were afraid to take anything. When we saw them on one side of the\nstreet, we run on the other side of the street, because we were afraid from them.\nThey didn\u2019t have a very good name to people. Even after the liberation they raped a\nlot of people; we heard about it. And when we tried to take a ride and a girl went in\nthe truck, after then, whenever we see them \u2014 see \u2014 seen them on one side of the\nstreet, we run on the other side of the street. So there was no help, or we didn\u2019t have\nany help until we got to Hungary, which was two months that we left from one\nhouse to another one running. Then, in Hungary there already, when we got to\nHungary they already called our [indecipherable] and explained them, because\nthere was a couple of people who were in the army, and a lot of people who were in\njail because they were communists. So \u2014 Jewish people. There were a lot of them\nthat they jailed them because they were communists. So when the communist\nOctober 22, 1997\ngovernment came over in Europe, they had big positions. So one called the other\none to let him know that the Jewish people are coming back. We were, by the way,\nthe first group to arrive in Hungary from the concentration camp. And the greeting\nwas, the dead people are coming back from the other world.",
        "Q: What was the state of your health at liberation?",
        "A: Well, most of us were frozen. To that extent that the \u2014 from Budapest, they took\nus by train home, and the first thing that they \u2014 I got home at Decs(ph) they put us\nin the hospital, and the first thing they\u2019d give us was a bathtub full of ice, cause we\nwere frostbitten. And that\u2019s the \u2014 we were skinny, very \u2014 skeletons. Really, whe \u2014 if\nyou look on us, they would say really that the dead people are coming from the\nother world. And we were in the hospital maybe about two weeks. There they\nchecked us and they gave us medication, and they gave us little by little food, til\ntowards the end, after two weeks, they discharge us from the hospital. That was in\nDecs(ph), which was a couple of miles from the town where we lived before the\ndeportation.",
        "Q: Among the 10 people, the tan \u2014 the 10 women that you were with, were any of\nthem from your hometown, or related to you in any way\u201d?",
        "A: We were four sisters, survived together. And there was one cousin, and one girl\nthat my brother used to go out before th-the concentration camp, and before the\nOctober 22, 1997\nghetto. But when they met, my brother was married already, because he didn\u2019t come\nstraight home. She was a third cousin, and also a friend that we were together in the\nsame camp. And two of them were from our town, and the rest of them are from the\nvicinity \u2014 we all 10 were from the same ghetto. And we were all the way to \u2014\nalmost all the way together. Nine were together all the way from \u2014 starting from the\nghetto, and once my sister we met in Stutthof, where she was in a different \u2014 from\na different area one. And a girl that was with us found her sister in the other camp.\nSo they changed their dresses at night, and they came to the fences. She came to us,\nand the other sister went to her, being that we were three, so my sister should be\ntogether, we changed places with the other girl. And this is the way we were\ntogether from September til January, til they liberated us. Because we were first \u2014\nfrom Auschwitz they took us to ri \u2014 Kaiserwald, and then there were Riga, and\nfrom Riga to Stutthof. Then at Stutthof we met our other sister. Cause always\nwhenever you ge \u2014 went to a new camp, we ask, 1s there anybody from the area.\nAnd when they told us who it was, we got to speak through the fence. And through\nthe wire fence, we picked \u2014 raised the fence so they changed clothes, and the\nnumbers, and this way we got together.",
        "Q: When you came back to Budapest, and were then taken by tr \u2014 by train?",
        "A: By train.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "Q: And then put in the hospital, who took care of you in the hospital?",
        "A: In \u2014 in the hospital they \u2014 they \u2014 already they were a communist organization\nand they was running mostly by the Jews who were jailed because they were\ncommunists. They were leaders in the government that time, and they arranged it.",
        "Q: Who were the doctors that cared for you?",
        "A: The doctors that cared for us were Romanian Hungarian, the ones that they \u2014 we\ndidn\u2019t know them because before we left in the lager, most of the doctors were\nJewish, but by that time there was the government doctors because th \u2014 they put in\ndoctors from all over. It was a big hospital, still in existence now, it\u2019s a big hospital.\nAnd that\u2019s where they put us, right there.",
        "Q: You mentioned that your group of 10 were the first to come back from the\ncamps. Were there any other former prisoners 1n the hospital with you?",
        "A: No. There was nobody. We were the first group that ever came back. So there\nwas no other group. The only one \u2014 there were a couple of Jewish people like I said,\nthey were in jail. And they were government agencies now, because after the\nliberation that Russia took over from that part, they became officials. So they put us\ninto the hospital and they took care of us. And after them, they opened the kitchen\nfor people that they start coming from other countries. They came, not from the\nlagers, they came from the other part of Romania, people who wanted to go to\nOctober 22, 1997\nIsrael. So they had to go through that area, so they came to find that from the\nfamily. But originally, when they started, there was nobody else. We were the first\nones.",
        "Q: During your time when you were freed by the Russians, and your travel, your\nwalk home, did you witness any acts of retaliation against collaborators or former\nguards from the camps?",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t \u2014 we \u2014 we were \u2014 were running at night where we didn\u2019t see\nnothing.",
        "Q: Right after the war, when you were freed and making your way back, was your\nview of Judaism the same as it had been when you were a child?",
        "A: At that point it was still pretty strong, because we \u2014 we didn\u2019t know that \u2014 we\nfigure we go home and everybody will come home too. We didn\u2019t realize that they\n\u2014 they wouldn\u2019t come back any more. That time we didn\u2019t know nothing. We were\ntogether, so we figure maybe they are together someplace, and they will come\nhome.",
        "Q: What efforts did you make to try and find members of your family, and friends?",
        "A: Well, the first effort we made is we went home to our town and waited to see. So\nwe got home in March, and April was \u2014 went back to our town, and we start looking\naround. The house was broke \u2014 was vacant, nothing in it, no windows, no doors,\nOctober 22, 1997\neverything was empty, nothing in the \u2014 in the stables, everything was gone. And we\nstart looking around to see if anybody else came home. Then we settled in the city,\nwhere the hospital was not far, and we\u2019re waiting to see who else is coming. So the\n\u2014all the effort that we had at that point was waiting to see, after the liberation from\nother camps to see who\u2019s coming. And we waited about two or three months, then\nthey start to come, one by one. A lot of people came from \u2014 to our town, from our\ntown and from the city. From the ghetto there must have been about 8,000 - 8,500\nmaybe, maybe 400 people came back all total. But we waited and we asked\nquestions; where would \u2014 where they were, whom they seen, and if anybody else is\ncoming, and if they met anybody. So we were home that [indecipherable] my sister\ncame home with us, and she found her husband, who was an invalid who was in the\narmy. But he got liberated before, and he was home. So they met after the war, right\naway, as soon as she came to the hospital, he came right away, and they were\ntogether. But we were waiting to see who else will come. And from March, almost\nanother year we stayed home, and we were waiting to see. Then got a letter towards\nthe end, from my brother, who w-was in Austria, who said he\u2019s waiting to see who\nelse 1s coming because there was a big DP camp right there, and they had a list of\nmost of the people who got liberated. But if nobody else is coming home, he\nsuggests we should travel to him, or he\u2019s not coming back. He will go either to\nOctober 22, 1997\nIsrael or to South America, because \u2014 or to America, because we had family all\nover. Before the war, my father was here. But for my mother\u2019s family, we had a\nlarge group here. My grandfather\u2019s sisters and brothers were here, and their family.\nSo we knew the names, but we did not have no idea the addresses, we didn\u2019t\nremember any more. So we had written, and the papers, they had papers that they\nwere sending overseas to see who was left from the family. So we waited til around\nMarch. There was a group of Polish people who were entertainers, and they came to\nour town for Purim in 1946. And after their \u2014 the show, that they were putting up a\nshow in the theater, they were saying, the reason we are entertaining, and we\u2019re\ngoing around the country is to let you know that the Russian people are taking\nprisoners for work. And when they\u2019re taking them, fortunately, the Jewish people,\nthey\u2019 ll be the first one to go again. So I advise anybody who could just leave, the\nsooner the better. So that was Purim. So the next day we packed, and we start\nrunning. So we went towards my brother. We figure my brother was in Austria,\nand it\u2019s crossing the border, so see what\u2019s gonna happen, we\u2019ll meet him, we\u2019ll see\nwhat decision gonna make after. So we packed, and we took a couple of bottles of\nwhiskey, knowing that the Russians, if they are on guard, if we give them a bottle of\nwhiskey, we\u2019ll be able to cross borders. Money, we didn\u2019t have. Whatever we were\nable to put on our back, we put, and we left. We left, a group about 40. We met\nOctober 22, 1997\nfrom Decs(ph), we went to the border, which was a couple hours by train. And then\nthere was a Jewish organization that was working to the borders. From there they\npicked up the people to cross them to the border, because there were a lot of people\nwho were trying to bring them to Israel. And we were ready to go anyplace, to\nIsrael, to the State, just out of the communist group. So the first thing they took us,\nwe crossed the border, and we walked about 40 - 50 miles, at night too. We paid off\nthe Russians with whiskey and went through 40 in a group, with three or four\npeople who knew the way, they were the leaders. And from there the first thing we\nwent to, went to \u2014 arrived to the English zone. I think 1t was Innsbruck, or\nwhatever name it was, I don\u2019t remember exactly. And the first thing when we went\ninto the DP camp, they give us injections and they give us a meal and they put us\nup, and we were waiting to see who else is coming. And there was a lot of groups\nalready. Every days new and new people used to arrive.",
        "Q: I want to pause for just a minute and ask you, when you went back to your\nhometown, did you feel welcome by your former neighbors \u2014 non-Jewish\nneighbors?",
        "A: I felt welcome, but there was nothing to stay with. The house was empty, and\nthey themselves didn\u2019t have too much. It wasn\u2019t a big city, they were mostly very\nolder people, and poor people in the \u2014 in the town. Because wherever it was before\nOctober 22, 1997\nthe war, everything was taken away. So they offered us a meal, and we were there a\nday or so, then we went into the city.",
        "Q: Can you give me a time frame, when you left your hometown and \u2014 and made\nyour way into Austria?",
        "A: We left after Purim, two days after that group \u2014 I don\u2019t know, was it March 22\"4\nor 234, I don\u2019t remember exactly the date. That\u2019s when we left our town. And I just\nget wi\u2014 me and my sister and her husband. My sister got married one a \u2014 on the\n[indecipherable] date, the time that we was there, and my other sister had already a\nnew baby, so she di \u2014couldn\u2019t leave. So she was staying home with the baby, and I\ntook the key, we locked up the house, and I said, look, we are leaving. If they catch\nus, we'll come back, we have the apartment. And if not, whatever you want to do,\ngive it to somebody else.",
        "Q: What year are we talking about?",
        "A: 1946. March 1946.",
        "Q: You mentioned that you were in a DP camp?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: In-",
        "A: I think it was Innsbruck.",
        "Q: In Innsbruck. Can you tell me \u2014 can you describe what the DP camp was like?\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: There was a small DP camp, maybe 200 people. They had a kitchen, and they\nhad bunk beds. And everybody got a blanket and a pillow and a bunk bed. And we\nwere sleeping with the \u2014 in the \u2014 1n there it must have been about 20 - 30 people in a\nroom.",
        "Q: Do you know which agencies provided assistance for that DP camp?",
        "A: It was an underground agency that ca \u2014 that came and took us to the camp. At\nthat time it was the \u2014 the English zone, so I don\u2019t know which \u2014 1-1t was UNRRA, I\ndon\u2019t know what \u2014 what agency was involved, UNRRA was involved with it.",
        "Q: Who else was in the DP camp with you?",
        "A: When I left from \u2014 my sister, only my sister with her husband was there, and\nthere was a lot of people from our town that we still 1n touch. They live in the New\nYork area.",
        "Q: Were there people from other nationalities?",
        "A: Oh, there were Polish people, German people, French people, Belgian people,\nfrom all the camps. And they were trying to get to an area to be able to go further,\nbecause other people did not want to go back home to their own town.",
        "Q: How did the different people get along?",
        "A: Pretty good. Everybody went to town to find out more information, and there\nthey had bulletin boards. And th \u2014 by the kitchen there was a big board that\nOctober 22, 1997\neverybody was \u2014 was able to write down for who they are looking and for what par\n\u2014 from where they coming, and anybody what group they are looking. At that point\nI put a sign that I am looking for the Weinstein(ph) family from America, if\nanybody knows where they are located. And I was there only maybe two or three\nweeks. My brother was in the American zone. He was in Bad Gastein, which was a\none night ride by train from where I was. So he send over \u2014 a couple came from\nBad Gastein, my brother paid them, and another person. It was a husband and wife\ngroup, and they came with Austrian clothes. And my brother wrote me a letter that\nsomebody will visit me, cause he couldn\u2019t talk on the telephone. And she came over\nwith a letter from my brother to the camp, and she says, my brother sent for me.\nAnd I got dressed in Austrian clothing, and I was the wife for her husband, and a\nfriend of mine that I knew, he was supposed to be the husband for her. We changed.\nFrom one couple, they made two couples. Like he\u2019s Austrian and I\u2019m his wife, and\nshe was Austrian and my friend was the husband. And he says, just sit in the train\nand you don\u2019t say nothing. And if anybody comes asking questions, make believe\nyou\u2019re sleeping and I will be dudi \u2014 doing the talking. So we took a train in the\nafternoon, and we went a couple hours. Then we had to stop because there was no\ntrain further that day. And we shared a hotel room that we all slept, the four of us on\n\u2014 on the floor in a hotel room, because there was no room. And then the next day\nOctober 22, 1997\nwe got dressed and we went with another train, and we arrived to Bad Gastein.\nThat place already my brother was there, he was married with his wife. And that\nwas in a hotel. The \u2014 is \u2014 was a \u2014 that was already American zone, and it was\n[indecipherable] from the American organization. They had a store that people\nused to go and pick out the clothes. There was old clothes, but cleaned, and you\nregistered there and you get food. But being I was a outsider, I came in illegal, I\ncouldn\u2019t register. So I had a job in the kitchen that I peeled potatoes and carrots, just\nto have my food. And at night I didn\u2019t have where to sleep, so my brother had the\nroom with his wife, and with two other fellows. So we slept five in one room. My\nbrother had one bed with his wife, and the two boys have \u2014 had one bed. And then\nwhoever came from our group, we were in the alley, sleeping in the room. And we\nwere working in the kitchen. This is the way we lived there until a month and a half,\nthen they got a job for us, legally, they legalized that [indecipherable] are there.\nAnd then they start registration for people underage to go to the United States.",
        "Q: When you met with other survivors, whether they were with \u2014 meeting your\nbrother, or meeting people from your hometown, or meeting people from different\nplaces, in the DP camps and along the way, did \u2014 what kinds of things did you all\ntalk about?\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: Everybody ask, where were you? Who do you see? Who died, and who do you\nknow where they was left? That was the only questions that were able to ask.",
        "Q: Did you have to register or sign up or do anything in order to come to the United\nStates? If that was your plan, what did you have to do?",
        "A: Well, first we didn\u2019t have no plans at all. By then they had a notice that anybody\nunder 18 to register, because there are gonna be a children group, the first group to\ngo to the United States. But you have to register in order to be able to be in it. So I\nwent and I registered.",
        "Q: How old were you?",
        "A: Seventeen. And we went downstairs to register and after we register we have to\ngo for medical checkups to \u2014 to get the visa. So when I walked into the doctor\u2019s\noffice, I saw somebody that I recognized from \u2014 it was our \u2014 we lived in a town, but\nhe lived in the city. And he played as \u2014 he was the doctor that it was supposed to\nexamine. I know his brother was a dentist, but he was never a doctor, he was in a\nmental institu \u2014 they were saying that he was a little crazy from overworking in a\nyeshiva. When I saw him I said to him, Crazy Blatt(ph), what are you doing here?\nHe says, please don\u2019t tell anybody anything. I will sign you all the papers, you will\nbe ready to go in the first group, but don\u2019t mention to anybody that you know me. I\nsaid, okay, you got a deal, provided I don\u2019t take no medication and no injections. If\nOctober 22, 1997\nyou want to take an x-ray, fine. You can check me up if you have to, but you don\u2019t\nneed to. So he sign me all the papers, he took a chest x-ray, and I was the first one\n[indecipherable], I left for Feldafing. That was in 1946.",
        "Q: So Blaut(ph) was his last name \u2014",
        "A: Blatt(ph).",
        "Q: Blatt(ph) \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 was his last name. In the DP camp, in this one and in any other camps also, but\nafter the war, did you notice a different moral standard among the survivors after \u2014",
        "A: Yes. There was a lot of people who they were sick, there was a lot of people who\nwere disbelievers. There were all different kind of a groups. They didn\u2019t believe\nthat this thing could happen, and no matter what who you were talking, they said,\npinch me to see if I\u2019m alive. I just don\u2019t believe that this could happen in this\ngeneration, in this type of a world. So many people were bewildered over it. A lot\nof people got married there, but non-Jews. There was a lot of intermarriages in the \u2014\nin the towns there. A lot of people didn\u2019t believe in anything. It was like a wild\ndreams for a lot of people, they couldn\u2019t believe it. And then when the groups start\nworking, and organizations came in, they came in from this \u2014 in the Bad Gastein,\nthey had a big group of Jews. They had a couple hotels, big hotels. They were\nOctober 22, 1997\nstaying in there, Hitler\u2019s supposed to be staying in that [indecipherable] up in the\nhills. Was loaded with DP campers. The place was just beautiful. Downstairs 1n the\nbasement there were bathtubs, with hot water coming from the springs. It was\nbeautiful hotels. We were in the Hotel Austria. I \u2014 I would like to go back one day\nto see it again, because it is \u2014 Austria, it\u2019s a beautiful country. Got beautiful\nwaterfalls, and the movies, everything they give special tickets, they used to have\nshows, and anybody from the DP camp used to go in with half price. The people\nwere \u2014 the Austrian people that \u2014 in that area, in that particular town, were very nice\nto the DP campers. But I was there only a short time, and after I got the papers to go\nto Feldafing, which the doctor signed them to me over right away, we went to\nFeldafing, there was a strike, a boat strike. That time the boats weren\u2019t coming\nthrough to the United States. And we were supposed to leave in November, but\ninstead of that, in the beginning of November, we left in the end of November,\nbecause there was a strike. And in Bremerhaven, the children used to come in that\nwe ended up sleeping three in a bunk bed, because it got overcrowded. And even\nthen we went already to the boat, we were supposed to take the boat in the 19\" of\nnove \u2014 of November, the boat left the 22\" or the 23\" of November. And we went a\ncouple of hours or a day and a half, I don\u2019t remember exactly, and boat got a hole in\nthe water and we had to stay in the English channels for the winter. We had to jump\nOctober 22, 1997\nthe boat in the little crafts, were waiting for another boat. So we started that with\nMarine Fletcher, the boat, and then we went to the Marine Marlin. And took us\nalmost a month to get here by boat, because we waited [indecipherable] for another\nboat, and only got into New York December the 20\", 1946.",
        "Q: While you were still in Europe, before you came to the United States, at that\ntime was there any movement among the DP campers to support the establishment\nof a \u2014 of a Jewish state?",

After I came to the State I find \u2014 I\u2014 I used to send them packages. They\nwere a lo \u2014 a long time on Cyprus. But in the DP camps, every place they had big\nsigns. When I was putting up a sign too, and I got a reply that from the\nWeinstein(ph) family, from my grandfather\u2019s sister. The brother died, but the sister\nis alive, and my \u2014 and his brother\u2019s children are here and they waiting for us \u2014 for\nme.

And\nmy father used to speak about America, how nice it is and how well organized it 1s\nand how comfortable people live around here, more comfortable than on the towns\nin Europe.

I got there, 1t was December\nthe 20\"\" I arrived, and the 21\u00b0 already, my mother\u2019s cousin came to see us. And the\nfirst day they asked permission to take me out for a day. So I felt a little\ncomfortable, because they were speaking Jewish and Hungarian, because I didn\u2019t\nspeak no English. And I was there for the first couple of days, about two days til\nChristmastime. And then I went back, and then they were asking me if I want to go\nlive with them. So I said okay for the beginning, until my rest of the family will\ncome. And I was living with them til I got married.",

        "A: When J arrived, I had no plans. First I was waiting to see how my sisters and the\nrest of the family will come out. But they didn\u2019t get no visas, all of them, to come\nhere. So one sister came to Canada with her husband. And my brother and my\nother sister with their husbands wen \u2014 and my brother with his wife, they went to\nSouth America, because we had family there, and the quota th-there was more\nliberal.

        "A: Well, they couldn\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s like when somebody will walk into your house\nand say, you have five minutes; pack, and you have to come with us. And they said,\nreally? That\u2019s the way it happened? They just said, how in the world could that\nhappen? I said well, this is the way exactly it happened. Even if you knew, they\nwouldn\u2019t have believe you. It just happened that I knew it before, that was gonna\nhappen. But then I went home, and I was telling my mother and father what I was\ntold. They all said, it\u2019s very, very hard to believe. Everything they else \u2014 they\nunderstand that I\u2019m telling them the truth, but to come to the house and tell us that\nyou have to leave and they taking you away, the reaction was, it\u2019s kind of\nimpossible.",
        "Q: Now, are you referring to your \u2014 your experiences before the war, e-early in the\nwar. Let me just see if I can get you to clarify that. How did you know, before your\nparents did, what was going to happen?\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: The reason I knew was because everything in Europe was rationed, and\neverything was blackmail. If you [indecipherable] anything, they used to put you\nin jail. You couldn\u2019t do business. But being that I was young, and my mother and\nmy father, they were very much afraid to do any kind of a business. I was very not\nafraid. I didn\u2019t think anything could happen, so I used to sell merchandise. My\nfather was a blacksmith, and if you wanted anything, clothing or shoes, you had to\ngive them food, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t get them, because all you had rationed, a\npair of shoes a year, or a pair of soles in the shoes. So the \u2014 the \u2014 in order to buy\nshoes, or to buy any kind of a food that you wanted, you had to exchange for\nsomething else. So, I used to go into the city, which was three miles. We had\neverything in the house. We had cows, we had chickens, and from the town you\nwere able to buy everything. Now, in order to go to the city and sell it on the black\nmarket, in case they catch me or something, I had to have connection. So I know the\nhead of the police, the captain, and I used to give him things for nothing, because I\ncouldn\u2019t charge him the black market price. And the price that 1t would have been to\ncharge, I may as well give him a present, because it was pennies. So I became very\nfriendly with him. And he was the one that told me, a couple of days before it\nhappened. And when I went home, and I mentioned it, nobody wanted to believe it.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "Q: What other things did you tell people here about the war, besides the \u2014 the\nrounding up of the people?",
        "A: You see, my father was a blacksmith, and the ji\u2014 the Germans were in our town.\nThe soldiers. And we had the pa \u2014 a big house, compared to the rest of the people in\ntown. So, being that our house was the biggest, they came and they took my mother\nand father out of their bedroom, and there were officers of the German Reich, who\nwere sleeping by us in the house. And their horses were \u2014 my father was taking care\nof the horses in the \u2014 as blacksmith to put them \u2014 shoe the horses. And they liked\nthe food and the milk, so they ate by us. They used to pay us, and they used to tell\nmy mother, if she\u2019Il be kind enough to make them food for breakfast, some for\nlunch and supper. My mother had no choice, she cooked them, and she served them.\nAnd even when they came for us, my father was still with their horses. And they\nhad to wait til he finishes the horses in order to leave. At that point already they\nbelieve me, what I told them the days before, but it was kind of late.",
        "Q: Did you tell Americans about your experiences in camps?",
        "A: Yeah. We talked about it. We talked and we a \u2014 when I arrived in Auschwitz the\nfirst day, on the ghetto, we were outdoor on the ghettos. And there was raining, it\nwas right after Passover, between Passover and [indecipherable] we were in the\nghetto. Just before [indecipherable]. And it was rainy weather. And there was no\nOctober 22, 1997\nbunks, was nothing, it was out in the woods. And we took the blankets that we took\nwith ourself, and everybody made their own little sukkah. And that\u2019s where we\nslept, the kids all crying. There was no bathroom facilities, there was no wat \u2014\nrunning water. There was a little lake nearby, people went for water to wash, or\nfood, whatever they \u2014 they were giving out ration food. And we were in the ghetto\nabout three weeks. And at that time that we were in the ghetto, this particular person\nthat I knew used to take me out as \u2014 take \u2014 he used to come for the Jewish girls for\nmaids, to take them out in the city. So every day a truck used to come for the Jewish\ngirls to go to be a maid for the Hungarians. So this particular guy requested me to\ngo as his maid. But I used to go in there and I used to do nothing, just talk to\n[indecipherable] and at night he used to come and he used to drop a bread to \u2014 in\nour place and used to say, just close the lights already, it\u2019s getting late. And he had\nsuggested even then, that if we want to leave, he would give us a truck for 40\npeople to leave. Then my mother said, 40 people, who I\u2019m gonna take for that\u2019s\ngonna be with the rest, will be with us too. So we didn\u2019t go nowhere.",

And I gave up my job, and I went, in order to make it\nconvenience for him. But then, as I walked around on the area, there was a job\nopening there, and I walked in and I got a job. And I was working first as a\noperator, as a dressmaker. And then he \u2014 they approached me, the new owner, and\nOctober 22, 1997\nhe said look, our forelady is getting married and I would like you to take her job.\nAnd I said \u2014 I looked on him, I said, you must be kidding. You know I\u2019m expecting\na baby, I\u2019m only working temporarily. I said, you better look for another forelady.\nHe says, well, you know something? Take the job until we find somebody else. I\nsaid, but look, sometimes I don\u2019t feel good and I don\u2019t come in and I can\u2019t really\nwork so much. I\u2019d rather work piecework. This way I don\u2019t cheat you, and I know\nthat I\u2019m only getting what\u2019s coming to me. He says, don\u2019t worry about that. So he\ntook me, and I became the forelady in that place, and he was so nice to me. When I\nhad to go to the doctor, he used to come to the doctor with me, I shouldn\u2019t waste\ntime with the bus, going back and forth. He used to wait for me. The doctor even\nthought that he was my husband. He used to take me to the doctor for monthly\ncheck-ups, practically, til \u2014 I was working for him as a forelady til two hours \u2014 I\ncame home at night and I took home a sample to make for the next day to take to\nwork, to be able to show the girls how to do it. And I call them up the next day, I\nsaid \u2014 from the hospital, I said, pick up the sample, I\u2019m in the hospital, I have a boy.\nHe was first one to send me the flowers, before my husband send them to me. He\nwas very nice to me, and he wanted me to go back to work. By then my first son,\nwas Jerry, was a colic baby, and I couldn\u2019t put him down. He offered me a nurse\nplus my salary to go back to work, but I just couldn\u2019t do it. I used to go with the kid\nOctober 22, 1997\na little to look around and help him a little, til he found somebody. He was very\nnice. They were Italian people, very nice people. But he got the store, the factory,\nhe got, and he went in with a partner. And he put in the money, and the partner\ndidn\u2019t like it, and he walked out of him. And he really had no experience in\ndressmaking, so he was stuck. So I tried to help them out. So we helped each other.\nAnd that\u2019s when I stopped working in the dress line, when Jerry was born, two\nhours af \u2014 before he was born, practically. I wa \u2014 he took me to the doctor and\ndoctor says, see you in a week. Then I went home and I had to go into the hospital.",
        "Q: How many children do you have?",
        "A: Three. Three boys.",
        "Q: How did you pick their names?",
        "A: Well, my first one, I was living ba \u2014 by my uncle, and his daughter was married\nbefore me, she got married \u2014 she was married three years and she had no children,\nso my uncle \u2014 my \u2014 actually my cousin\u2019s husband said gee, I\u2019Il never have my\nfather\u2019s name. So being he \u2014 they were so nice for \u2014 to me, and my father and my\nmother already had a name by my other sisters and brothers, so I figured it was just\nright to give his name. After that his daughter had three children, but it took her \u2014\nmy first name, [indecipherable] that she should have the children. So that\u2019s the\nway I picked the first time. And then my second name \u2014 my second child was\nOctober 22, 1997\nnamed after my husband\u2019s grandfather, and my other one that was born, the third\nson has the name of my father and my brother.",
        "Q: What have you told your sons about your childhood, your life before the war?",
        "A: We spoke to them when they were already about seven years old, they kept on\nasking. When they went to school, they said, everybody has birthday parties, and\neverybody has grandparents, how come they don\u2019t have any? That\u2019s when we\nstarted to tell them what happened to their grandparents. And they kept on asking. I\nnever refused an answer. I didn\u2019t want to bring it up when they were too young, but\nafter then they start asking, and whenever they asked, I told them.",
        "Q: What did you tell them about your parents?",
        "A: I was telling them that we were very, very religious. I had a brother who was a\nrabbi, who was so religious, he came home from the yeshiva at 19 and a half, not\neven 20, and he told my father, th-they should both rest in peace, he says, I\u2019m\ngetting married. So my father jumped in this chair, he said, you\u2019re getting married?\nYou\u2019re in yeshiva, there is no girls there, how are you getting married? He says, my\nRebbe find me a wife. I said, and who\u2019s the wife? He says, my Rebbe\u2019s sister\u2019s\ndaughter. I said \u2014 my father said, did you see her? Nope, but if my Rabbi said that\nshe\u2019s the right girl for me, I am sure she\u2019s the right girl. So my father said, what if\nshe\u2019s blind? Or she has hand on her feet, you didn\u2019t see her, you don\u2019t know. He\nOctober 22, 1997\nsays, it'll be a bigger mitzvah. They went to an engagement party, I remember I was\nyoung that time, but I remember hearing them talk. My mother and father went and\nthey got engaged, and they came back and they were telling us, and they were\nsitting by the table, because the reason that the rabbi wanted them to get married is\nbecause her husband died. Th-The girl\u2019s mother\u2019s husband died, the girl\u2019s father\nhad died, and she \u2014 there\u2019s a family of four children and the oldest is 18, and there\nis no shochet, and there was no rabbi in town. And he figured that he would be\ngood for that. At that age he became the youngest rabbi in the area there. And they\ngot married.",
        "Q: As your sons got older, did you tell them about your wartime experiences?",
        "A: Yeah, we always talk about the wartimes experiences, what we went through.\nAnd I always wanted to be a lawyer when I was small. I told them that I \u2014 I want \u2014\nmy father, being that he was in America, he did not speak Romanian, and he was\nborn when it was Hungary. And when he came back, he didn\u2019t go to school back to\nlearn Romanian, and whenever he had to go someplace, I used to go with him to\nread what [indecipherable] and tell him if he could sign that or no. Cause he could\nspeak, but he didn\u2019t read and he didn\u2019t write in Romanian. He only was able to do it\nin English, which I didn\u2019t know that he knew it, and Jewish, Yiddish, or in\nHungarian. But Romanian he didn\u2019t know. So when I was seven \u2014 after I was seven\nOctober 22, 1997\nyears old, and I was his translator, he used to say, I\u2019m only gonna sign what my\nlawyer will say I can sign. And therefore, I always said I \u2014 when I grow up, I'll be a\nlawyer. But I never finished it.",
        "Q: Did you ever tell your sons about what you had to go through in the ghetto and\nthe camps?",
        "A: Yes, we spoke about it.",
        "Q: What kinds of things do they ask you about those experiences?",
        "A: They ask that \u2014 how many we were in the family, and how many came back, and\nhow was it in the lagers, and how did I got here, how did I met his father. We went\nover that many, many times.",
        "Q: Did you ever get a sense that perhaps your children had questions that they either\nwouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t bring themselves to ask you?",
        "A: Well, if they have a lot of \u2014 cause maybe they had asked \u2014 because most of our\nfamily are Holocaust survivors. And whenever they didn\u2019t speak to us, they must\nhave spoken to them, because they didn\u2019t want to bring it up to us, we shouldn\u2019t\ncry. Or they shouldn\u2019t hurt us, or they didn\u2019t know how to put it. But whenever they\ngot together with their cousins, they always used to talk or ask somebody else. It\u2019s\neasier sometimes to ask a stranger, than your own.",
        "Q: Was there ever something that you wanted them to ask that they didn\u2019t?\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: Not really.",
        "Q: Was there ever something that you wanted for them to know, but you weren\u2019t\nable to tell them, and they never asked?",
        "A: They all, when they went away to school, or when they went to high school,\nthere was a lot of groups that they were involved with the Holocaust, and they were\ninvolved with the groups, so whatever answers they needed, most of the time, they\ngot it from them. And whatever I felt that they didn\u2019t ask me, they didn\u2019t want to\nknow, or they already knew it. Because all of them are involved on the new\ngeneration Holocaust group.",
        "Q: What kind of education did you provide for your children?",
        "A: Well, when we got married, we weren\u2019t religious at all. My husband was way the\nother side, he didn\u2019t even keep kosher. I went out \u2014 if I ate fish or anything but treyf\nto go out to eat [indecipherable] the first meal mine was pig. I didn\u2019t eat it when I\nwas in this country. But he didn\u2019t keep kosher at all. Shabbas we didn\u2019t observe,\nnone of us. We lived by my cousin, who was a kosher butcher. But Shabbas they\ndidn\u2019t work, but they went shopping, we went to the movies. No work around the\nhouse or anything. They used to play cards in Shabbas, but it wasn\u2019t Orthodox.\nThey were more Conservative than Orthodox. And it was sort of a \u2014 for me too, I\nmean, Saturday used to go to the city, meet my friends. Sunday \u2014 during the week\nOctober 22, 1997\nwe worked and went to school. Saturday and Sunday we used to go to the city\nshopping or meet our friends. And when I met my husband, we weren\u2019t thinking\nabout [indecipherable]. But then in 1948, when the Arnold Constable estate got\nsold in Westchester for a yeshiva, that time there was a big article in that \u201cNew\nYork Times.\u201d Arnold Constable estate sold for yeshiva. It was an estate of 27 or\n28 acres, beautiful, by the water. It\u2019s a castle, a beautiful place. Everybody from the\ncity came to see it. So I \u2014 we took a ride with friends and neighbors, we took a ride\nto see the s \u2014 the new school. At that point I wasn\u2019t even married, didn\u2019t even think\nabout it, so I said to myself, it is just gorgeous. If I\u2019ll ever have children, I would\nlike to send them there. And this is the way it started out that I send them to the\nyeshiva. I didn\u2019t have no other dreams of making them religious, or anything else.\nDespite that, I came from a very, very Orthodox family. And then when they were\nborn, I send them to school. And Jerry went to school when the \u2014 got ready to go to\nschool \u2014 when Jerry went to school, the first week he came home, he says,\nMommy, you know what I learned? I said, if you\u2019 ll tell me, P\u2019Il know. He said,\nyou\u2019re not supposed to work on Shabbat, not you and not Daddy. Saturday is a day\nof rest. I said to him, Jerry, they are right and you are right. But you have a choice;\nif you go to a public school, I could stay home and you don\u2019t have \u2014 I don\u2019t have to\nwork. But if you want to go to that school, I have to work in order to pay for you\nOctober 22, 1997\nthey should take you into school. So I said to him, got time to decide, it\u2019s Friday.\nMonday you let me know, do you want to go to school, or do you want to go to\npublic school? So Sunday night I bathe him and I prepared the clothes and I said, so\nwhat is the situation for tomorrow? He said, well, I decided that while I go to\nschool, you work. But once I stop, then you should become shomer Shabbos. So I\nsaid, you got a deal. So I kept my promise. But we were working, Saturday was the\nbusiest day for both of us. My husband came from work and I took the car and I\nwent to work. And even when they went to s \u2014 to Yeshiva University High School,\nwhere I took Steven and I put him on [indecipherable], I went to the rabbi there for\nan interview, and the rabbi said, and I\u2019m sure you are shomer Shabbos. My\nhusband wouldn\u2019t say a word. I said, sorry. I said, the prices you charge, I have to\nwork in order to pay it. I don\u2019t have nobody to pay it for me. They didn\u2019t reduce the\nprice, so I had to work in order to pay it. And they continued yeshiva, but they \u2014\nJerry was even \u2014 when he finished high school and Yeshiva University, he applied\nto NYU and they called him for an interview. And being that they called him for an\ninterview in Shabbat, he refused to go to that school because they called him for a\ninterview in Shabbat. I said, Jerry, they don\u2019t have to know that you are Orthodox.\nHe said, but can they see I\u2019m in Yeshiva University? Would I be in Yeshiva\nUniversity if I wouldn\u2019t be Orthodox? So I told him, Jerry, there are many people\nOctober 22, 1997\nin Yeshiva University and they\u2019re not Orthodox, they travel in Shabbat. All you\nhave to do is write them a note or call them up and say you want another interview.\nBut he didn\u2019t want to go any more. And for that reason he went to Yeshiva College.\nAnd the other ones never asked me, and they continued it.",
        "Q: What do you mean they continued it?",
        "A: Yeshiva College.",
        "Q: Did they get education beyond college?",
        "A: Yes, they all went to law schools. And that time it was very difficult to get into\nlaw school because they ask where did your parents graduated from. And despite\nthat they were very good students, not because they were my children, they couldn\u2019t\nget into Columbia or to a school in the vicinity. So Jerry went to California,\nAlvin went to Saint Louis, and Steven went to Boston. Because we didn\u2019t go to\nschool here, so Yeshiva University, when they graduate over a hundred students in\na class, and they only took two or three students from ea \u2014 to each school in law\nschool, so I was in the bottom of the list, because we didn\u2019t go to no schools in here,\nin the state or colleges. So that\u2019s where they ended up, in very good schools. They\ngot a fairly good education, I hope.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "Q: You mentioned that you had to make compromises, working on Shabbat and you\nknow, th-the deal that you made with Jerry. Were there other compromises that\nyou had to make raising a family and working in this country?",
        "A: Well, we didn\u2019t ba \u2014 travel. We didn\u2019t have a big house or anything, we had a\nsmall apartment. It was expensive and the colleges were very high and the\nschooling was very expensive, although they didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t \u2014 when I start working\nalready, later on, I was able to \u2014 to get an \u2014 a\u2014a house before they went to high\nschool, but when they were small, we were sacrificing to that extent that I put them\nall three in one bedroom. We had a one bedroom apartment and that\u2019s where I\nraised them. We slept in a open couch in the living room. But we sacrificed in order\nto give them a good education.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you if you had followed the Eichmann trial?",
        "A: Yes, I followed the Eichmann trial a lot. [indecipherable] watched already on\ntelevision, that was televised.",
        "Q: What were your thoughts and your reactions to that trial and the judgment?",
        "A: My thought was why it took them so long to find them? With all the knowledge\nand with all the new things that they have and they [indecipherable] spaces and\neverything, they had to take them so many years til they find somebody? They\nknew all along where it was. America had the records from all the Nazis that they\nOctober 22, 1997\nwere here in America, and the Nazis are there on \u2014 in \u2014 in Canada and all over the\nworld. It really didn\u2019t had to take them that long to find them. That was my\nreaction.",
        "Q: Did you have a reaction to the fact that Eichmann was being tried in Jerusalem,\nin Israel?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t think that he should be tried any other place, because the majority of\nthe people in Israel are survivors, and they were the one that knew him the best, so\nthey know mostly what he did. He would \u2014 even there, it took a long time to have a\ntrial for them. And here would have probably [indecipherable]",

        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Bella Pasternak. This is tape two, side A. In the 1950s and 60s and\n70s, this country went through some major, major changes. You were busy working\nand raising your children, but I wanted to know what your thoughts were about, you\nknow, things like the war in Vietnam, an-and the Cold War.",
        "A: Well, the war in Vietnam and the Cold War th \u2014 every war that you look, even\nnow you can look on the Yugoslavia war and all those things, it\u2019s heartbreaking to\nsee all the refugees. You know, when you see the refugees, you remember of\nyourself, how you were. It\u2019s a very difficult situation, it\u2019s heartbreaking. The war is\nnever right to have. No matter na \u2014 no matter who the enemy is. It\u2019s \u2014 innocent\npeople will still suffer. It\u2019s not the army that suffers, it\u2019s not the soldiers. It\u2019s the\ninnocent people, you see children starving and all this thing in the streets. It\u2019s a\nterrible situation no matter where you go and you look on it, regardless what race\nthey are, or what kind of a people are.",
        "Q: There was a lot of activity also in the country in the area of civil rights. Did you\nfollow some of those changes that were going on in this country?",
        "A: Always following the changes, I \u2014 I think they did the right thing, because the\nrights, no matter what \u2014 who you are and what you are then \u2014 and Martin Luther\nOctober 22, 1997\nKing was killed, and all those things, I followed them. I liked to look on all this, in\nthe history, from all this, people that they suffered and they tried to better\nthemselves. It\u2019s a terrible thing. I think that it should be equal right for everybody,\ndoesn\u2019t make a difference. They\u2019re not any better than we are, the color or \u2014 or the\nwhite. It should be equal opportunity to all. It doesn\u2019t make a difference, but it was\nhere terrible when they hold them back, too. It wasn\u2019t right to hold the colored\npeople back and everything. I don\u2019t think it was right.",
        "Q: What about the assassination of Kennedy?",
        "A: I cried. I couldn\u2019t believe it when it happened. I \u2014 I remember like today that I \u2014\nthat \u2014 when it happened in 1963, when they said that he got shot. First I thought it\nwas a joke. And then, when I saw it on television, it was heartbreaking. His father\nwas a anti-Semite, but the \u2014 the children \u2014 he suffered a lot. All his children, I think,\nhe got punished right and left.",
        "Q: What about the sexual revolution in this country?",
        "A: Well, I think that is a little too much for me. I don\u2019t \u2014 that I don\u2019t believe in. You\nsee, I was 17, and there was a lot of revolution, even between the people in the\nconcentration camps after \u2014 out of the concentration, in the DP camps, a lot of\npeople were free, and that \u2014 I don\u2019t believe in that. That is one thing I \u2014 I \u2014 I would\nstay away from it. I don\u2019t \u2014 I hope my grandchildren will stay away from it, I don\u2019t\nOctober 22, 1997\nbelieve in it. I believe the old-fashioned way. You love a person, you get married,\nyou settle them and you live. But that \u2014 this kind of a life, with all this disease\nespecially going around, I think is wrong.",

        "A: That is the right way. I mean, a woman shouldn\u2019t be lower than a man. They\nhave the same brain, they have the same ability to work. Matter of fact, in a lot of\nplaces you find women better than men. It should be equal opportunity if you\nqualify for a job, it shouldn\u2019t be a difference you\u2019re a woman or a man.

        "Q: How do you respond to Holocaust deniers?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think anybody with good knowledge would admit that. It only the people\nthat they are denying that, either they were Nazis, or they are anti-Semites.\nOtherwise they would not say it because it\u2019s open to the public and the museums\nand \u2014 and the newspapers and every place else.

And the situation in here too, they have\nswastikas in synagogues, they have a lot of swastikas in Jewish homes that they put\non. And there 1s anti-Semite in here. I personally didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t see it in my\nimmediate area or my house, but there are people who could start something like\nthat, if it\u2019s not controlled in that.",

        "A: It\u2019s good in one say and not too good in the other thing, because I think they are\nputting too much effort into it now, and a lot of people resent it.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "Q: Can you explain what you mean by too much effort, and a lot of people resent it?",
        "A: There\u2019s a lot of people who feel that they shouldn\u2019t go too much in the past, they\nsh \u2014 instead of that, they should look for the future of the Jewish people, not so\nmuch on the past.",

        "A: I go to Israel often, I have family there, I have friends, very, very good friends\nthat we suffered together, and we correspond together and we meet as many times\nas we go there, if we can. Fortunately we go for three or \u2014 three weeks or four\nweeks and it\u2019s not enough time to see everybody, but \u2014 [break]",
        "Q: Have you ever regretted not moving to Israel?",
        "A: Well, I really wanted to go to Israel, I wanted to move many times. When the\nchildren were small, I was hesitant, for the simple reason because they\u2019re constantly\non war there, and I didn\u2019t want the boys to throw it up to me and say gee, why did\nyou come? I was hoping they would go on their own and I would follow. So I send\nJerry over for the \u2014 a year to Israel to study, he loved it. And the only mistake that\nthey made 1s, when he applied to law school, he applied to Israel and they told him,\nfinish first, and then come.

        "Q: What changes have you noticed in relations between American Jews and Israel,\nover the years?",
        "A: Well, in the beginning the Jews that went to Israel, they were more Zionist type.\nThey were hardworking people, they really were depending on American fund that\nthey were getting, and they were living different life, very hard life. Like the people\nwho come from Europe, when they started here life wa-was difficult, for them it\nwas 10 times harder. They had to live like in DP camps after they were in Israel,\nand after Israel was declared a state, because they had no facilities there. And they\nworked really very hard. Today it\u2019s a very beautiful country. They work less than\nhere. They have a more normal life as far as social life, and they traveling a lot.\nThey are not settled as much as the American people are settled. They take life in\nday by day because all the time something happens in there. And they want to grab\nthem whatever they can while they\u2019re alive. So that\u2019s why they are more loose in\ntraveling and more loose in life in Israel than here. Life in Israel is beautiful.\nOctober 22, 1997",

        "A: Well, I\u2019m ver \u2014 I\u2019m very close with the family. ve always protected the\nchildren, I was always afraid something that\u2019s gonna happen. When they were small\nI used to get up from bed at night while they were sleeping to listen if they\u2019re\nbreathing. I was so surrounded with dead people, that if they didn\u2019t cry, or they to \u2014\nthey were sleeping, I went to see if they\u2019re alive. So it was fearful no matter how\nlong and no matter how much time after 1t happens. Would the children or even the\ngrandchildren, I watched them today. If I go over there, whatever they do, I said,\nyou do this, now your Mommy and Daddy\u2019s home, not when I\u2019m around you.

        "Q: In retrospect, do you think you would have done something, or anything\ndifferently if you were raising them today\u201d?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I still think that they should know more res-respect for others. I\n\u2014 I believe that today the children are raised a little too loose \u2014 in most of the places,\nnot all. Some of the children, the parents, you know, have a lot of things, they run\naround, they don \u2014 they have strangers watching the children. I don\u2019t approve of\nOctober 22, 1997\nthat.

So we have all\nthree names in there. And the children now, the older one is seven. She starts asking\nquestions.

We didn\u2019t hear no noises, nothing.\nThe \u2014 the older SSs left, and we were surrounded only by the lagerfuehrer, who\nwas from Czechoslovakia, a girl, a Jewish girl. So we really don\u2019t know anything\nmuch about it. But the ru-ru-Russian government declared it liberated, and that\u2019s all\nwa \u2014 we knew [indecipherable].",
        "A: We were in a small town. Because we were on the front line, we were given the\nammunition for the soldiers. So we were in a farm, in a \u2014 in a stable full of hay, that\nwe slept in. And when they came in and said we got liberated, everybody start\nrunning. This is the way it started. That was January 21\u201c, winter, cold, and we were\nOctober 22, 1997\nshivering in a barn. The first thing people went, and they were looking for food.\nEverybody grabbed what they find in the farm. They tried to get the milk from the\ncow, because the farmers just had left when we got there. The first thing that we did\nwas we \u2014 by the time we realized that there is no more food left, I grabbed a little\npig running in the stable. I took a fork, one that 1\u2014 cleaning the stables, and we\npunched into the pig, and with everything in it, we made a fi \u2014 bonfire and we sat\ndown, about 10 - 12 girls with potatoes and that\u2019s what was our first meal.\nEverybody was first laughing. I took my belt and I tie it around the pig after I\ncaught him, and I start to make a bonfire. So, got the heat, to warm up a little, and\nmaybe about an hour later, we all start eating on the pig. That was our first meal.\nAnd then we started up walking. We had no facilities, no cars, no bicycles, nothing.\nWhatever we had \u2014 we took our clothes that we had on us, nothing else, and we\nstart going towards the city. And when we got to the city, we asked the people how\nwe go down south. Got liberated in Estonia. And from there we walked, we start\nwalking. We walked from January to March. This is the way we got home, were no\ntransportation. Because we were offered a couple of rides from the Russians. We\nwere 10 girls, we are still in touch. One of them \u2014 two of them passed away since\nthen. Eight is still \u2014 we still talking occasionally together. One is in Canada, couple\nof them are in Brooklyn, couple of them in Israel I just visited. And we are in\nOctober 22, 1997\ntouch. The 10 of us made a group, and like a chain, we jumped from one\n[indecipherable] to another one, because there were no bridges. And this was the\nway we crossed the rivers. We went into houses, and whatever we found, we ate. In\ncertain houses, there was hot food on the stove, and I told them, don\u2019t eat, cause if\nit\u2019s hot, there must be poison in it. So we ate raw potatoes. We were sleeping during\nthe day, and we were running at night, because we were afraid of the Russians.\nThey picked us up once with a car, one girl went up the car and he start the motor\nrunning. So as soon as we see that they start rolling, we pulled her down from the\ntruck. And I said, no more lifts, we have to walk. And there was no trains,\neverything was banned. Nothing was going. So the only way we were able to go\nwas by foot. And wherever got dark, we start running. During the day, we were\nsleeping wherever we found a place, in a barn, in a house. Everything was opened.\nYou could go in any house, there was no people around there, until we got to\nPoland. And then already there we ask in Polish, that\u2019s all that we knew was,\n[speaks Polish here|",
        "A: I don\u2019t speak Polish either. That\u2019s all Polish we know that we ask her, how many\nkilomete \u2014 kilometers is to the station. That\u2019s what we know Polish from the Polish\ngirls that we were in lager together. And they said there is no station. So we kept on\nOctober 22, 1997\nwalking, and we walked til March. Purim, just before Purim, we arrived to\nBudapest. And there already, we were home, because we spoke the language. We\nwere able to speak Hungarian, and we asked the first thing if there\u2019s a Jewish\nagency. And we were dir \u2014 were directed because Russian ha \u2014 occupied the\nterritory, and they told us that there is a communist government there, and we\nshould go to the office.",
        "A: No. We were afraid to take anything. When we saw them on one side of the\nstreet, we run on the other side of the street, because we were afraid from them.\nThey didn\u2019t have a very good name to people. Even after the liberation they raped a\nlot of people; we heard about it. And when we tried to take a ride and a girl went in\nthe truck, after then, whenever we see them \u2014 see \u2014 seen them on one side of the\nstreet, we run on the other side of the street. So there was no help, or we didn\u2019t have\nany help until we got to Hungary, which was two months that we left from one\nhouse to another one running. Then, in Hungary there already, when we got to\nHungary they already called our [indecipherable] and explained them, because\nthere was a couple of people who were in the army, and a lot of people who were in\njail because they were communists. So \u2014 Jewish people. There were a lot of them\nthat they jailed them because they were communists. So when the communist\nOctober 22, 1997\ngovernment came over in Europe, they had big positions. So one called the other\none to let him know that the Jewish people are coming back. We were, by the way,\nthe first group to arrive in Hungary from the concentration camp. And the greeting\nwas, the dead people are coming back from the other world.",
        "A: Well, most of us were frozen. To that extent that the \u2014 from Budapest, they took\nus by train home, and the first thing that they \u2014 I got home at Decs(ph) they put us\nin the hospital, and the first thing they\u2019d give us was a bathtub full of ice, cause we\nwere frostbitten. And that\u2019s the \u2014 we were skinny, very \u2014 skeletons. Really, whe \u2014 if\nyou look on us, they would say really that the dead people are coming from the\nother world. And we were in the hospital maybe about two weeks. There they\nchecked us and they gave us medication, and they gave us little by little food, til\ntowards the end, after two weeks, they discharge us from the hospital. That was in\nDecs(ph), which was a couple of miles from the town where we lived before the\ndeportation.",
        "A: We were four sisters, survived together. And there was one cousin, and one girl\nthat my brother used to go out before th-the concentration camp, and before the\nOctober 22, 1997\nghetto. But when they met, my brother was married already, because he didn\u2019t come\nstraight home. She was a third cousin, and also a friend that we were together in the\nsame camp. And two of them were from our town, and the rest of them are from the\nvicinity \u2014 we all 10 were from the same ghetto. And we were all the way to \u2014\nalmost all the way together. Nine were together all the way from \u2014 starting from the\nghetto, and once my sister we met in Stutthof, where she was in a different \u2014 from\na different area one. And a girl that was with us found her sister in the other camp.\nSo they changed their dresses at night, and they came to the fences. She came to us,\nand the other sister went to her, being that we were three, so my sister should be\ntogether, we changed places with the other girl. And this is the way we were\ntogether from September til January, til they liberated us. Because we were first \u2014\nfrom Auschwitz they took us to ri \u2014 Kaiserwald, and then there were Riga, and\nfrom Riga to Stutthof. Then at Stutthof we met our other sister. Cause always\nwhenever you ge \u2014 went to a new camp, we ask, 1s there anybody from the area.\nAnd when they told us who it was, we got to speak through the fence. And through\nthe wire fence, we picked \u2014 raised the fence so they changed clothes, and the\nnumbers, and this way we got together.",
        "A: By train.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: In \u2014 in the hospital they \u2014 they \u2014 already they were a communist organization\nand they was running mostly by the Jews who were jailed because they were\ncommunists. They were leaders in the government that time, and they arranged it.",
        "A: The doctors that cared for us were Romanian Hungarian, the ones that they \u2014 we\ndidn\u2019t know them because before we left in the lager, most of the doctors were\nJewish, but by that time there was the government doctors because th \u2014 they put in\ndoctors from all over. It was a big hospital, still in existence now, it\u2019s a big hospital.\nAnd that\u2019s where they put us, right there.",
        "A: No. There was nobody. We were the first group that ever came back. So there\nwas no other group. The only one \u2014 there were a couple of Jewish people like I said,\nthey were in jail. And they were government agencies now, because after the\nliberation that Russia took over from that part, they became officials. So they put us\ninto the hospital and they took care of us. And after them, they opened the kitchen\nfor people that they start coming from other countries. They came, not from the\nlagers, they came from the other part of Romania, people who wanted to go to\nOctober 22, 1997\nIsrael. So they had to go through that area, so they came to find that from the\nfamily. But originally, when they started, there was nobody else. We were the first\nones.",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t \u2014 we \u2014 we were \u2014 were running at night where we didn\u2019t see\nnothing.",
        "A: At that point it was still pretty strong, because we \u2014 we didn\u2019t know that \u2014 we\nfigure we go home and everybody will come home too. We didn\u2019t realize that they\n\u2014 they wouldn\u2019t come back any more. That time we didn\u2019t know nothing. We were\ntogether, so we figure maybe they are together someplace, and they will come\nhome.",
        "A: Well, the first effort we made is we went home to our town and waited to see. So\nwe got home in March, and April was \u2014 went back to our town, and we start looking\naround. The house was broke \u2014 was vacant, nothing in it, no windows, no doors,\nOctober 22, 1997\neverything was empty, nothing in the \u2014 in the stables, everything was gone. And we\nstart looking around to see if anybody else came home. Then we settled in the city,\nwhere the hospital was not far, and we\u2019re waiting to see who else is coming. So the\n\u2014all the effort that we had at that point was waiting to see, after the liberation from\nother camps to see who\u2019s coming. And we waited about two or three months, then\nthey start to come, one by one. A lot of people came from \u2014 to our town, from our\ntown and from the city. From the ghetto there must have been about 8,000 - 8,500\nmaybe, maybe 400 people came back all total. But we waited and we asked\nquestions; where would \u2014 where they were, whom they seen, and if anybody else is\ncoming, and if they met anybody. So we were home that [indecipherable] my sister\ncame home with us, and she found her husband, who was an invalid who was in the\narmy. But he got liberated before, and he was home. So they met after the war, right\naway, as soon as she came to the hospital, he came right away, and they were\ntogether. But we were waiting to see who else will come. And from March, almost\nanother year we stayed home, and we were waiting to see. Then got a letter towards\nthe end, from my brother, who w-was in Austria, who said he\u2019s waiting to see who\nelse 1s coming because there was a big DP camp right there, and they had a list of\nmost of the people who got liberated. But if nobody else is coming home, he\nsuggests we should travel to him, or he\u2019s not coming back. He will go either to\nOctober 22, 1997\nIsrael or to South America, because \u2014 or to America, because we had family all\nover. Before the war, my father was here. But for my mother\u2019s family, we had a\nlarge group here. My grandfather\u2019s sisters and brothers were here, and their family.\nSo we knew the names, but we did not have no idea the addresses, we didn\u2019t\nremember any more. So we had written, and the papers, they had papers that they\nwere sending overseas to see who was left from the family. So we waited til around\nMarch. There was a group of Polish people who were entertainers, and they came to\nour town for Purim in 1946. And after their \u2014 the show, that they were putting up a\nshow in the theater, they were saying, the reason we are entertaining, and we\u2019re\ngoing around the country is to let you know that the Russian people are taking\nprisoners for work. And when they\u2019re taking them, fortunately, the Jewish people,\nthey\u2019 ll be the first one to go again. So I advise anybody who could just leave, the\nsooner the better. So that was Purim. So the next day we packed, and we start\nrunning. So we went towards my brother. We figure my brother was in Austria,\nand it\u2019s crossing the border, so see what\u2019s gonna happen, we\u2019ll meet him, we\u2019ll see\nwhat decision gonna make after. So we packed, and we took a couple of bottles of\nwhiskey, knowing that the Russians, if they are on guard, if we give them a bottle of\nwhiskey, we\u2019ll be able to cross borders. Money, we didn\u2019t have. Whatever we were\nable to put on our back, we put, and we left. We left, a group about 40. We met\nOctober 22, 1997\nfrom Decs(ph), we went to the border, which was a couple hours by train. And then\nthere was a Jewish organization that was working to the borders. From there they\npicked up the people to cross them to the border, because there were a lot of people\nwho were trying to bring them to Israel. And we were ready to go anyplace, to\nIsrael, to the State, just out of the communist group. So the first thing they took us,\nwe crossed the border, and we walked about 40 - 50 miles, at night too. We paid off\nthe Russians with whiskey and went through 40 in a group, with three or four\npeople who knew the way, they were the leaders. And from there the first thing we\nwent to, went to \u2014 arrived to the English zone. I think 1t was Innsbruck, or\nwhatever name it was, I don\u2019t remember exactly. And the first thing when we went\ninto the DP camp, they give us injections and they give us a meal and they put us\nup, and we were waiting to see who else is coming. And there was a lot of groups\nalready. Every days new and new people used to arrive.",
        "A: I felt welcome, but there was nothing to stay with. The house was empty, and\nthey themselves didn\u2019t have too much. It wasn\u2019t a big city, they were mostly very\nolder people, and poor people in the \u2014 in the town. Because wherever it was before\nOctober 22, 1997\nthe war, everything was taken away. So they offered us a meal, and we were there a\nday or so, then we went into the city.",
        "A: We left after Purim, two days after that group \u2014 I don\u2019t know, was it March 22\"4\nor 234, I don\u2019t remember exactly the date. That\u2019s when we left our town. And I just\nget wi\u2014 me and my sister and her husband. My sister got married one a \u2014 on the\n[indecipherable] date, the time that we was there, and my other sister had already a\nnew baby, so she di \u2014couldn\u2019t leave. So she was staying home with the baby, and I\ntook the key, we locked up the house, and I said, look, we are leaving. If they catch\nus, we'll come back, we have the apartment. And if not, whatever you want to do,\ngive it to somebody else.",
        "A: 1946. March 1946.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I think it was Innsbruck.",
        "A: There was a small DP camp, maybe 200 people. They had a kitchen, and they\nhad bunk beds. And everybody got a blanket and a pillow and a bunk bed. And we\nwere sleeping with the \u2014 in the \u2014 1n there it must have been about 20 - 30 people in a\nroom.",
        "A: It was an underground agency that ca \u2014 that came and took us to the camp. At\nthat time it was the \u2014 the English zone, so I don\u2019t know which \u2014 1-1t was UNRRA, I\ndon\u2019t know what \u2014 what agency was involved, UNRRA was involved with it.",
        "A: When I left from \u2014 my sister, only my sister with her husband was there, and\nthere was a lot of people from our town that we still 1n touch. They live in the New\nYork area.",
        "A: Oh, there were Polish people, German people, French people, Belgian people,\nfrom all the camps. And they were trying to get to an area to be able to go further,\nbecause other people did not want to go back home to their own town.",
        "A: Pretty good. Everybody went to town to find out more information, and there\nthey had bulletin boards. And th \u2014 by the kitchen there was a big board that\nOctober 22, 1997\neverybody was \u2014 was able to write down for who they are looking and for what par\n\u2014 from where they coming, and anybody what group they are looking. At that point\nI put a sign that I am looking for the Weinstein(ph) family from America, if\nanybody knows where they are located. And I was there only maybe two or three\nweeks. My brother was in the American zone. He was in Bad Gastein, which was a\none night ride by train from where I was. So he send over \u2014 a couple came from\nBad Gastein, my brother paid them, and another person. It was a husband and wife\ngroup, and they came with Austrian clothes. And my brother wrote me a letter that\nsomebody will visit me, cause he couldn\u2019t talk on the telephone. And she came over\nwith a letter from my brother to the camp, and she says, my brother sent for me.\nAnd I got dressed in Austrian clothing, and I was the wife for her husband, and a\nfriend of mine that I knew, he was supposed to be the husband for her. We changed.\nFrom one couple, they made two couples. Like he\u2019s Austrian and I\u2019m his wife, and\nshe was Austrian and my friend was the husband. And he says, just sit in the train\nand you don\u2019t say nothing. And if anybody comes asking questions, make believe\nyou\u2019re sleeping and I will be dudi \u2014 doing the talking. So we took a train in the\nafternoon, and we went a couple hours. Then we had to stop because there was no\ntrain further that day. And we shared a hotel room that we all slept, the four of us on\n\u2014 on the floor in a hotel room, because there was no room. And then the next day\nOctober 22, 1997\nwe got dressed and we went with another train, and we arrived to Bad Gastein.\nThat place already my brother was there, he was married with his wife. And that\nwas in a hotel. The \u2014 is \u2014 was a \u2014 that was already American zone, and it was\n[indecipherable] from the American organization. They had a store that people\nused to go and pick out the clothes. There was old clothes, but cleaned, and you\nregistered there and you get food. But being I was a outsider, I came in illegal, I\ncouldn\u2019t register. So I had a job in the kitchen that I peeled potatoes and carrots, just\nto have my food. And at night I didn\u2019t have where to sleep, so my brother had the\nroom with his wife, and with two other fellows. So we slept five in one room. My\nbrother had one bed with his wife, and the two boys have \u2014 had one bed. And then\nwhoever came from our group, we were in the alley, sleeping in the room. And we\nwere working in the kitchen. This is the way we lived there until a month and a half,\nthen they got a job for us, legally, they legalized that [indecipherable] are there.\nAnd then they start registration for people underage to go to the United States.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: Everybody ask, where were you? Who do you see? Who died, and who do you\nknow where they was left? That was the only questions that were able to ask.",
        "A: Well, first we didn\u2019t have no plans at all. By then they had a notice that anybody\nunder 18 to register, because there are gonna be a children group, the first group to\ngo to the United States. But you have to register in order to be able to be in it. So I\nwent and I registered.",
        "A: Seventeen. And we went downstairs to register and after we register we have to\ngo for medical checkups to \u2014 to get the visa. So when I walked into the doctor\u2019s\noffice, I saw somebody that I recognized from \u2014 it was our \u2014 we lived in a town, but\nhe lived in the city. And he played as \u2014 he was the doctor that it was supposed to\nexamine. I know his brother was a dentist, but he was never a doctor, he was in a\nmental institu \u2014 they were saying that he was a little crazy from overworking in a\nyeshiva. When I saw him I said to him, Crazy Blatt(ph), what are you doing here?\nHe says, please don\u2019t tell anybody anything. I will sign you all the papers, you will\nbe ready to go in the first group, but don\u2019t mention to anybody that you know me. I\nsaid, okay, you got a deal, provided I don\u2019t take no medication and no injections. If\nOctober 22, 1997\nyou want to take an x-ray, fine. You can check me up if you have to, but you don\u2019t\nneed to. So he sign me all the papers, he took a chest x-ray, and I was the first one\n[indecipherable], I left for Feldafing. That was in 1946.",
        "A: Blatt(ph).",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. There was a lot of people who they were sick, there was a lot of people who\nwere disbelievers. There were all different kind of a groups. They didn\u2019t believe\nthat this thing could happen, and no matter what who you were talking, they said,\npinch me to see if I\u2019m alive. I just don\u2019t believe that this could happen in this\ngeneration, in this type of a world. So many people were bewildered over it. A lot\nof people got married there, but non-Jews. There was a lot of intermarriages in the \u2014\nin the towns there. A lot of people didn\u2019t believe in anything. It was like a wild\ndreams for a lot of people, they couldn\u2019t believe it. And then when the groups start\nworking, and organizations came in, they came in from this \u2014 in the Bad Gastein,\nthey had a big group of Jews. They had a couple hotels, big hotels. They were\nOctober 22, 1997\nstaying in there, Hitler\u2019s supposed to be staying in that [indecipherable] up in the\nhills. Was loaded with DP campers. The place was just beautiful. Downstairs 1n the\nbasement there were bathtubs, with hot water coming from the springs. It was\nbeautiful hotels. We were in the Hotel Austria. I \u2014 I would like to go back one day\nto see it again, because it is \u2014 Austria, it\u2019s a beautiful country. Got beautiful\nwaterfalls, and the movies, everything they give special tickets, they used to have\nshows, and anybody from the DP camp used to go in with half price. The people\nwere \u2014 the Austrian people that \u2014 in that area, in that particular town, were very nice\nto the DP campers. But I was there only a short time, and after I got the papers to go\nto Feldafing, which the doctor signed them to me over right away, we went to\nFeldafing, there was a strike, a boat strike. That time the boats weren\u2019t coming\nthrough to the United States. And we were supposed to leave in November, but\ninstead of that, in the beginning of November, we left in the end of November,\nbecause there was a strike. And in Bremerhaven, the children used to come in that\nwe ended up sleeping three in a bunk bed, because it got overcrowded. And even\nthen we went already to the boat, we were supposed to take the boat in the 19\" of\nnove \u2014 of November, the boat left the 22\" or the 23\" of November. And we went a\ncouple of hours or a day and a half, I don\u2019t remember exactly, and boat got a hole in\nthe water and we had to stay in the English channels for the winter. We had to jump\nOctober 22, 1997\nthe boat in the little crafts, were waiting for another boat. So we started that with\nMarine Fletcher, the boat, and then we went to the Marine Marlin. And took us\nalmost a month to get here by boat, because we waited [indecipherable] for another\nboat, and only got into New York December the 20\", 1946.",
        "A: There was a big support about it, and there was a lot of people who registered to\ngo. They were taking them by boat, a lot of people went from there to e \u2014 to that\ntime to Palestine, and a lot of people got caught \u2014 I have a lot of family caught on\nCyprus. After I came to the State I find \u2014 I\u2014 I used to send them packages. They\nwere a lo \u2014 a long time on Cyprus. But in the DP camps, every place they had big\nsigns. When I was putting up a sign too, and I got a reply that from the\nWeinstein(ph) family, from my grandfather\u2019s sister. The brother died, but the sister\nis alive, and my \u2014 and his brother\u2019s children are here and they waiting for us \u2014 for\nme. I got a reply \u2014 got a letter from them before I got here. And they were even\nsending out an affidavit for me, but I already had the ticket to come here.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: My father was here in the early 1900, before he was married. And after he\nbecame a citizen, he went back home to get married, and the war broke out, and\nbeing that he was born there, they didn\u2019t recognize his citizenship, and he went into\nthe army. And after he get back, his visa had expired, and they didn\u2019t let him out\nany more.",
        "A: The first war.",

        "A: Yeah, my father used to \u2014 there was another person in our town. We weren\u2019t in\nthe city, we were in a small town three miles from the city. And there was another\nperson who was non-Jewish, who was in America with the same time with my\nfather. And they used to talk. They used to come over \u2014 my father learned a trade in\nAmerican, he become a blacksmith, and he used to made the carriages, like here in\nthe Fifth Avenue, the carriages. He had a lot of people working with him, and he\nused to talk with the other person who was from our town \u2014 in English occasionally,\nbut we didn\u2019t understand them. And they used to take meat and make steaks. So\nthey were saying them crazy American people are eating raw meat. Because they\nOctober 22, 1997\ncouldn\u2019t believe that you just put the steak on top of the coal and you keep it a\ncouple of minutes on one side, and a couple minutes on the other side, that they are\neating. But he used to eat it with the other fellow, and we all looked around, but we\nnever ate it.",
        "A: Well, the only expectation I had is I knew my \u2014 my mother\u2019s family was here.\nMy mother used to correspond with cousins who were here in New York. And my\nmother wanted to come back and my father, they all had couple of times papers to\ncome. But the government kept on changing, and that time there wasn\u2019t flying, the\nmail came by boat and it took months. And by the time one letter came and one visa\ncame, the government kept on changing and they never were able to come out. And\nmy father used to speak about America, how nice it is and how well organized it 1s\nand how comfortable people live around here, more comfortable than on the towns\nin Europe. So the expectation was that I will find somebody from the family,\nbecause in Europe we lost a lot, maybe we\u2019ll find somebody.",
        "A: For the first night we stopped in front of the Statue of Liberty, and all night we\ndidn\u2019t sleep. We were just looking at the Statue of Liberty. We saw the city lit up,\nand they were waiting to embark. We were there a couple hours. And then in the\nmorning, we went off the boat, and they took us to a children place, a home. You\nwouldn\u2019t believe it, there were cribs waiting for us, because they said a children\ngroup was coming. It was in the Bronx, I think 1t was Ca-Caldell(ph) Avenue, but I\ndon\u2019t remember the number. And it was a big house, and in there we went \u2014 most of\nthe group went there.

So I felt a little\ncomfortable, because they were speaking Jewish and Hungarian, because I didn\u2019t\nspeak no English. And I was there for the first couple of days, about two days til\nChristmastime. And then I went back, and then they were asking me if I want to go\nlive with them. So I said okay for the beginning, until my rest of the family will\ncome. And I was living with them til I got married.",
        "A: There were all ba \u2014 all children from all over, from all the DP camps. There was\na group organizer, the children group organization. All I know is there was three Cs\nOctober 22, 1997\nthey had in the hat. What that meaned, I don\u2019t know. Three Cs he had on the hat,\nand we all had rooms in the \u2014 in the ship, it was like a military boat, but 1t was\nconsidered first class. And we ate, but ich \u2014 food was plenty, but nobody was able\nto eat. It was shaking so much the boat that food didn\u2019t stay in anybody\u2019s stomach.\nWho \u2014 everybody was dizzy from the boat.",
        "A: They were from 17 and 18; 16, 17, 18. One boy was 13, who met a soldier in\nAustria and adopted him, a 13 year old boy in the group. He was the youngest.",
        "A: When J arrived, I had no plans. First I was waiting to see how my sisters and the\nrest of the family will come out. But they didn\u2019t get no visas, all of them, to come\nhere. So one sister came to Canada with her husband. And my brother and my\nother sister with their husbands wen \u2014 and my brother with his wife, they went to\nSouth America, because we had family there, and the quota th-there was more\nliberal. So they went to South America, to Uruguay. They settled in Uruguay.\nAnd I was here alone for the first couple of years, but I was living with a cousin of\nmy mother\u2019s.",
        "A: Well, they couldn\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s like when somebody will walk into your house\nand say, you have five minutes; pack, and you have to come with us. And they said,\nreally? That\u2019s the way it happened? They just said, how in the world could that\nhappen? I said well, this is the way exactly it happened. Even if you knew, they\nwouldn\u2019t have believe you. It just happened that I knew it before, that was gonna\nhappen. But then I went home, and I was telling my mother and father what I was\ntold. They all said, it\u2019s very, very hard to believe. Everything they else \u2014 they\nunderstand that I\u2019m telling them the truth, but to come to the house and tell us that\nyou have to leave and they taking you away, the reaction was, it\u2019s kind of\nimpossible.",
        "A: The reason I knew was because everything in Europe was rationed, and\neverything was blackmail. If you [indecipherable] anything, they used to put you\nin jail. You couldn\u2019t do business. But being that I was young, and my mother and\nmy father, they were very much afraid to do any kind of a business. I was very not\nafraid. I didn\u2019t think anything could happen, so I used to sell merchandise. My\nfather was a blacksmith, and if you wanted anything, clothing or shoes, you had to\ngive them food, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t get them, because all you had rationed, a\npair of shoes a year, or a pair of soles in the shoes. So the \u2014 the \u2014 in order to buy\nshoes, or to buy any kind of a food that you wanted, you had to exchange for\nsomething else. So, I used to go into the city, which was three miles. We had\neverything in the house. We had cows, we had chickens, and from the town you\nwere able to buy everything. Now, in order to go to the city and sell it on the black\nmarket, in case they catch me or something, I had to have connection. So I know the\nhead of the police, the captain, and I used to give him things for nothing, because I\ncouldn\u2019t charge him the black market price. And the price that 1t would have been to\ncharge, I may as well give him a present, because it was pennies. So I became very\nfriendly with him. And he was the one that told me, a couple of days before it\nhappened. And when I went home, and I mentioned it, nobody wanted to believe it.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: You see, my father was a blacksmith, and the ji\u2014 the Germans were in our town.\nThe soldiers. And we had the pa \u2014 a big house, compared to the rest of the people in\ntown. So, being that our house was the biggest, they came and they took my mother\nand father out of their bedroom, and there were officers of the German Reich, who\nwere sleeping by us in the house. And their horses were \u2014 my father was taking care\nof the horses in the \u2014 as blacksmith to put them \u2014 shoe the horses. And they liked\nthe food and the milk, so they ate by us. They used to pay us, and they used to tell\nmy mother, if she\u2019Il be kind enough to make them food for breakfast, some for\nlunch and supper. My mother had no choice, she cooked them, and she served them.\nAnd even when they came for us, my father was still with their horses. And they\nhad to wait til he finishes the horses in order to leave. At that point already they\nbelieve me, what I told them the days before, but it was kind of late.",
        "A: Yeah. We talked about it. We talked and we a \u2014 when I arrived in Auschwitz the\nfirst day, on the ghetto, we were outdoor on the ghettos. And there was raining, it\nwas right after Passover, between Passover and [indecipherable] we were in the\nghetto. Just before [indecipherable]. And it was rainy weather. And there was no\nOctober 22, 1997\nbunks, was nothing, it was out in the woods. And we took the blankets that we took\nwith ourself, and everybody made their own little sukkah. And that\u2019s where we\nslept, the kids all crying. There was no bathroom facilities, there was no wat \u2014\nrunning water. There was a little lake nearby, people went for water to wash, or\nfood, whatever they \u2014 they were giving out ration food. And we were in the ghetto\nabout three weeks. And at that time that we were in the ghetto, this particular person\nthat I knew used to take me out as \u2014 take \u2014 he used to come for the Jewish girls for\nmaids, to take them out in the city. So every day a truck used to come for the Jewish\ngirls to go to be a maid for the Hungarians. So this particular guy requested me to\ngo as his maid. But I used to go in there and I used to do nothing, just talk to\n[indecipherable] and at night he used to come and he used to drop a bread to \u2014 in\nour place and used to say, just close the lights already, it\u2019s getting late. And he had\nsuggested even then, that if we want to leave, he would give us a truck for 40\npeople to leave. Then my mother said, 40 people, who I\u2019m gonna take for that\u2019s\ngonna be with the rest, will be with us too. So we didn\u2019t go nowhere.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: Well, a lot of people had some ideas, because there were the American soldiers\nalready, that they used to write home and explain them what\u2019s was going on. That\ntime with \u2014 it was a little knowledge about it, not too much. A lot of people didn\u2019t\neven want to \u2014 they \u2014 they says it\u2019s hard to believe, but they know it had happened.",

Because\nat that point when I \u2014 it was st-still a lot of people still were coming. But nobody\nknew exactly how many.",
        "A: Yeah, when I went \u2014 when I came to my mother\u2019s cousin, she had two girls. One\nwas two years younger than me, and the other one was only about four years old.\nAnd I went at night school that time, and I went to \u2014 first a couple of months they\ndidn\u2019t let me do nothing.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. They just said I need a rest. And they asked me how I survived,\nand I said that when I arrived in Auschwitz, there was a Polish fellow who asked\nme how old I was. I already had [indecipherable] me and my mother, to go with\nher. And he asked me how old are you? I said 16. He says, well, say you are 17 \u2014\nsay you are 18.

I had fallen down and my wrist was\nbroken, but I just put my belt and I tied it around, and it didn\u2019t grow back properly.\nSo when the daughter become that time 16, she bought her a fur coat. So she bought\nme the same coat, and when I picked up the coat, I fainted. So when I fainted I \u2014\nthey took me to the doctor and the doctor took x-rays and they said my wrist was\nOctober 22, 1997\nbroken, but it didn\u2019t heal properly, and they had to re-break it again, and put it ina\ncast. So for awhile I was just home with a cast, and after a \u2014 they told me after what\nI went through, they want me to take it easy, and then I will go to school, or to\nwork, whatever I want. So they didn\u2019t want me to travel to the city, so they find me\na job there in that vicinity, but I was able to walk to it. And at night I would \u2014 used\nto go to school to learn English.",

        "A: Very little. It wasn\u2019t too much. I didn\u2019t understand it too much because\neverything was in English. So I used to ask a lot of questions in Hungarian what\nthey were saying, because I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t understand it. Later on I followed it,\nwhen they reviewed it on the television, later on. I was by the television, and I\nwatched it. But in the beginning I didn\u2019t understand it.",
        "A: Yeah, that we followed, because I \u2014 I used to get the Hungarian paper, they used\nto bring me the paper so I should understand it. Because that I understood.",
        "A: It was very thrilling, I co \u2014 I just couldn\u2019t believe it. I was crying for happiness\nwhen that happened.",

There were a couple of people from \u2014 also survivors that settled not too\nfar from where I lived, and they had girls mine age, and we used to go out together,\nand we had the \u2014 also a group of Americans that they were speaking Yiddish, and\nwe used to get together. And after I went to school, I used to speak a little bit. And I\ngot along with them fine.",
        "A: About two years after. I used to out in a group a lot, but not really dating. Two\nyears later I used to go out with \u2014 in a group, but not really dating.",
        "A: Mostly \u2014 at that time mostly we used to go to the HIAS, or to organizations that\nI used to be the newcomers, and I always wanted to find out who else is coming up,\nbecause the \u2014 there used to come boats \u2014 mostly then they used to come by the\nHIAS, we used to go to find out who came from our area, and what news they are\nbringing. So you find a lot of people that we knew from the DP camps and from the\nOctober 22, 1997\nunt \u2014 our own town. And then we starting \u2014 they used to have the special affairs for\nthe refugees camps. They used to have groups in the HIAS, they used to have it in\nthe Joint, they used to have it in the \u2014 with our diplomat, and they used to get\ntogether from all over. And we met all the people who used to say in the boat, we\nwill meet you whenever they gonna have a Hanukkah party, or a Purim party, we\nused to go together, just to see our friends from the other side.",
        "A: Well, we went to a Purim party, I assume. It was a Purim or Hanukkah party,\nand I went with my cousin\u2019s daughter, and with other people from our town, a\ngroup, because we lived out of the city. And we went there and somebody looked at\nme, I didn\u2019t recognize him. And one day I got a telephone call from him, and he\nsaid his name was Andrew, because he \u2014 Andrew. He said it\u2019s a Romanian name,\nso he start talking Romanian. He said he saw me, and he would like to meet me.\nAnd this is the way we had a blind date. So he came out with his brother and his\nsister-in-law, together with the car, and we had a blind date, the four of us together.\nAnd we met in early *51 or \u00b052, I don\u2019t rem \u2014 I think it was in \u201952 that we met the\nfirst time.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: We went out for a while, and then I went out with other people for a while. I\ncouldn\u2019t make up my mind. And then, eventually, I think the Korean War broke out,\nand my friend called me, and he told me that he was drafted. So I \u2014 it was just\nbefore New Year\u2019s, I send him a New Year card, and I wished him good luck in his\ncareer. So then he called me, and we got together again, and after then we started to\ngo out more steady, and we got engaged, and married in \u201953.",
        "A: Yes, my husband 1s a survivor, also from Romania, but from a different area.\nThat\u2019s like a different state.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t make big plans. He was working and I was working and that time it\nwas \u2014 it wasn\u2019t as easy as today, there were no apartments, it was difficult to find\napartments. In order to get an apartment, you actually had to buy the apartment,\nthrow out the old furniture, and get apartments. So we moved to the city, where he\nwas closer to work. And I gave up my job, and I went, in order to make it\nconvenience for him. But then, as I walked around on the area, there was a job\nopening there, and I walked in and I got a job. And I was working first as a\noperator, as a dressmaker. And then he \u2014 they approached me, the new owner, and\nOctober 22, 1997\nhe said look, our forelady is getting married and I would like you to take her job.\nAnd I said \u2014 I looked on him, I said, you must be kidding. You know I\u2019m expecting\na baby, I\u2019m only working temporarily. I said, you better look for another forelady.\nHe says, well, you know something? Take the job until we find somebody else. I\nsaid, but look, sometimes I don\u2019t feel good and I don\u2019t come in and I can\u2019t really\nwork so much. I\u2019d rather work piecework. This way I don\u2019t cheat you, and I know\nthat I\u2019m only getting what\u2019s coming to me. He says, don\u2019t worry about that. So he\ntook me, and I became the forelady in that place, and he was so nice to me. When I\nhad to go to the doctor, he used to come to the doctor with me, I shouldn\u2019t waste\ntime with the bus, going back and forth. He used to wait for me. The doctor even\nthought that he was my husband. He used to take me to the doctor for monthly\ncheck-ups, practically, til \u2014 I was working for him as a forelady til two hours \u2014 I\ncame home at night and I took home a sample to make for the next day to take to\nwork, to be able to show the girls how to do it. And I call them up the next day, I\nsaid \u2014 from the hospital, I said, pick up the sample, I\u2019m in the hospital, I have a boy.\nHe was first one to send me the flowers, before my husband send them to me. He\nwas very nice to me, and he wanted me to go back to work. By then my first son,\nwas Jerry, was a colic baby, and I couldn\u2019t put him down. He offered me a nurse\nplus my salary to go back to work, but I just couldn\u2019t do it. I used to go with the kid\nOctober 22, 1997\na little to look around and help him a little, til he found somebody. He was very\nnice. They were Italian people, very nice people. But he got the store, the factory,\nhe got, and he went in with a partner. And he put in the money, and the partner\ndidn\u2019t like it, and he walked out of him. And he really had no experience in\ndressmaking, so he was stuck. So I tried to help them out. So we helped each other.\nAnd that\u2019s when I stopped working in the dress line, when Jerry was born, two\nhours af \u2014 before he was born, practically. I wa \u2014 he took me to the doctor and\ndoctor says, see you in a week. Then I went home and I had to go into the hospital.",
        "A: Three. Three boys.",
        "A: Well, my first one, I was living ba \u2014 by my uncle, and his daughter was married\nbefore me, she got married \u2014 she was married three years and she had no children,\nso my uncle \u2014 my \u2014 actually my cousin\u2019s husband said gee, I\u2019Il never have my\nfather\u2019s name. So being he \u2014 they were so nice for \u2014 to me, and my father and my\nmother already had a name by my other sisters and brothers, so I figured it was just\nright to give his name. After that his daughter had three children, but it took her \u2014\nmy first name, [indecipherable] that she should have the children. So that\u2019s the\nway I picked the first time. And then my second name \u2014 my second child was\nOctober 22, 1997\nnamed after my husband\u2019s grandfather, and my other one that was born, the third\nson has the name of my father and my brother.",

When they went to school, they said, everybody has birthday parties, and\neverybody has grandparents, how come they don\u2019t have any? That\u2019s when we\nstarted to tell them what happened to their grandparents. And they kept on asking. I\nnever refused an answer. I didn\u2019t want to bring it up when they were too young, but\nafter then they start asking, and whenever they asked, I told them.",
        "A: I was telling them that we were very, very religious. I had a brother who was a\nrabbi, who was so religious, he came home from the yeshiva at 19 and a half, not\neven 20, and he told my father, th-they should both rest in peace, he says, I\u2019m\ngetting married. So my father jumped in this chair, he said, you\u2019re getting married?\nYou\u2019re in yeshiva, there is no girls there, how are you getting married? He says, my\nRebbe find me a wife. I said, and who\u2019s the wife? He says, my Rebbe\u2019s sister\u2019s\ndaughter. I said \u2014 my father said, did you see her? Nope, but if my Rabbi said that\nshe\u2019s the right girl for me, I am sure she\u2019s the right girl. So my father said, what if\nshe\u2019s blind? Or she has hand on her feet, you didn\u2019t see her, you don\u2019t know. He\nOctober 22, 1997\nsays, it'll be a bigger mitzvah. They went to an engagement party, I remember I was\nyoung that time, but I remember hearing them talk. My mother and father went and\nthey got engaged, and they came back and they were telling us, and they were\nsitting by the table, because the reason that the rabbi wanted them to get married is\nbecause her husband died. Th-The girl\u2019s mother\u2019s husband died, the girl\u2019s father\nhad died, and she \u2014 there\u2019s a family of four children and the oldest is 18, and there\nis no shochet, and there was no rabbi in town.

        "A: Yeah, we always talk about the wartimes experiences, what we went through.\nAnd I always wanted to be a lawyer when I was small. I told them that I \u2014 I want \u2014\nmy father, being that he was in America, he did not speak Romanian, and he was\nborn when it was Hungary. And when he came back, he didn\u2019t go to school back to\nlearn Romanian, and whenever he had to go someplace, I used to go with him to\nread what [indecipherable] and tell him if he could sign that or no. Cause he could\nspeak, but he didn\u2019t read and he didn\u2019t write in Romanian. He only was able to do it\nin English, which I didn\u2019t know that he knew it, and Jewish, Yiddish, or in\nHungarian. But Romanian he didn\u2019t know. So when I was seven \u2014 after I was seven\nOctober 22, 1997\nyears old, and I was his translator, he used to say, I\u2019m only gonna sign what my\nlawyer will say I can sign.

And whatever I felt that they didn\u2019t ask me, they didn\u2019t want to\nknow, or they already knew it. Because all of them are involved on the new\ngeneration Holocaust group.",
        "A: Well, when we got married, we weren\u2019t religious at all. My husband was way the\nother side, he didn\u2019t even keep kosher. I went out \u2014 if I ate fish or anything but treyf\nto go out to eat [indecipherable] the first meal mine was pig. I didn\u2019t eat it when I\nwas in this country. But he didn\u2019t keep kosher at all. Shabbas we didn\u2019t observe,\nnone of us. We lived by my cousin, who was a kosher butcher.

They used to play cards in Shabbas, but it wasn\u2019t Orthodox.\nThey were more Conservative than Orthodox. And it was sort of a \u2014 for me too, I\nmean, Saturday used to go to the city, meet my friends. Sunday \u2014 during the week\nOctober 22, 1997\nwe worked and went to school. Saturday and Sunday we used to go to the city\nshopping or meet our friends. And when I met my husband, we weren\u2019t thinking\nabout [indecipherable].

At that point I wasn\u2019t even married, didn\u2019t even think\nabout it, so I said to myself, it is just gorgeous. If I\u2019ll ever have children, I would\nlike to send them there. And this is the way it started out that I send them to the\nyeshiva. I didn\u2019t have no other dreams of making them religious, or anything else.\nDespite that, I came from a very, very Orthodox family. And then when they were\nborn, I send them to school. And Jerry went to school when the \u2014 got ready to go to\nschool \u2014 when Jerry went to school, the first week he came home, he says,\nMommy, you know what I learned? I said, if you\u2019 ll tell me, P\u2019Il know. He said,\nyou\u2019re not supposed to work on Shabbat, not you and not Daddy. Saturday is a day\nof rest. I said to him, Jerry, they are right and you are right. But you have a choice;\nif you go to a public school, I could stay home and you don\u2019t have \u2014 I don\u2019t have to\nwork. But if you want to go to that school, I have to work in order to pay for you\nOctober 22, 1997\nthey should take you into school. So I said to him, got time to decide, it\u2019s Friday.\nMonday you let me know, do you want to go to school, or do you want to go to\npublic school? So Sunday night I bathe him and I prepared the clothes and I said, so\nwhat is the situation for tomorrow? He said, well, I decided that while I go to\nschool, you work. But once I stop, then you should become shomer Shabbos. So I\nsaid, you got a deal. So I kept my promise. But we were working, Saturday was the\nbusiest day for both of us. My husband came from work and I took the car and I\nwent to work. And even when they went to s \u2014 to Yeshiva University High School,\nwhere I took Steven and I put him on [indecipherable], I went to the rabbi there for\nan interview, and the rabbi said, and I\u2019m sure you are shomer Shabbos. My\nhusband wouldn\u2019t say a word. I said, sorry. I said, the prices you charge, I have to\nwork in order to pay it. I don\u2019t have nobody to pay it for me. They didn\u2019t reduce the\nprice, so I had to work in order to pay it. And they continued yeshiva, but they \u2014\nJerry was even \u2014 when he finished high school and Yeshiva University, he applied\nto NYU and they called him for an interview. And being that they called him for an\ninterview in Shabbat, he refused to go to that school because they called him for a\ninterview in Shabbat. I said, Jerry, they don\u2019t have to know that you are Orthodox.\nHe said, but can they see I\u2019m in Yeshiva University? Would I be in Yeshiva\nUniversity if I wouldn\u2019t be Orthodox? So I told him, Jerry, there are many people\nOctober 22, 1997\nin Yeshiva University and they\u2019re not Orthodox, they travel in Shabbat. All you\nhave to do is write them a note or call them up and say you want another interview.\nBut he didn\u2019t want to go any more. And for that reason he went to Yeshiva College.\nAnd the other ones never asked me, and they continued it.",
        "A: Yeshiva College.",
        "A: Yes, they all went to law schools. And that time it was very difficult to get into\nlaw school because they ask where did your parents graduated from. And despite\nthat they were very good students, not because they were my children, they couldn\u2019t\nget into Columbia or to a school in the vicinity. So Jerry went to California,\nAlvin went to Saint Louis, and Steven went to Boston. Because we didn\u2019t go to\nschool here, so Yeshiva University, when they graduate over a hundred students in\na class, and they only took two or three students from ea \u2014 to each school in law\nschool, so I was in the bottom of the list, because we didn\u2019t go to no schools in here,\nin the state or colleges. So that\u2019s where they ended up, in very good schools. They\ngot a fairly good education, I hope.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: Well, we didn\u2019t ba \u2014 travel. We didn\u2019t have a big house or anything, we had a\nsmall apartment. It was expensive and the colleges were very high and the\nschooling was very expensive, although they didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t \u2014 when I start working\nalready, later on, I was able to \u2014 to get an \u2014 a\u2014a house before they went to high\nschool, but when they were small, we were sacrificing to that extent that I put them\nall three in one bedroom. We had a one bedroom apartment and that\u2019s where I\nraised them. We slept in a open couch in the living room. But we sacrificed in order\nto give them a good education.",
        "A: Yes, I followed the Eichmann trial a lot. [indecipherable] watched already on\ntelevision, that was televised.",
        "A: My thought was why it took them so long to find them? With all the knowledge\nand with all the new things that they have and they [indecipherable] spaces and\neverything, they had to take them so many years til they find somebody? They\nknew all along where it was. America had the records from all the Nazis that they\nOctober 22, 1997\nwere here in America, and the Nazis are there on \u2014 in \u2014 in Canada and all over the\nworld. It really didn\u2019t had to take them that long to find them. That was my\nreaction.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t think that he should be tried any other place, because the majority of\nthe people in Israel are survivors, and they were the one that knew him the best, so\nthey know mostly what he did. He would \u2014 even there, it took a long time to have a\ntrial for them. And here would have probably [indecipherable]\nOctober 22, 1997\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Well, the war in Vietnam and the Cold War th \u2014 every war that you look, even\nnow you can look on the Yugoslavia war and all those things, it\u2019s heartbreaking to\nsee all the refugees. You know, when you see the refugees, you remember of\nyourself, how you were. It\u2019s a very difficult situation, it\u2019s heartbreaking. The war is\nnever right to have. No matter na \u2014 no matter who the enemy is. It\u2019s \u2014 innocent\npeople will still suffer. It\u2019s not the army that suffers, it\u2019s not the soldiers. It\u2019s the\ninnocent people, you see children starving and all this thing in the streets. It\u2019s a\nterrible situation no matter where you go and you look on it, regardless what race\nthey are, or what kind of a people are.",
        "A: Always following the changes, I \u2014 I think they did the right thing, because the\nrights, no matter what \u2014 who you are and what you are then \u2014 and Martin Luther\nOctober 22, 1997\nKing was killed, and all those things, I followed them. I liked to look on all this, in\nthe history, from all this, people that they suffered and they tried to better\nthemselves. It\u2019s a terrible thing. I think that it should be equal right for everybody,\ndoesn\u2019t make a difference. They\u2019re not any better than we are, the color or \u2014 or the\nwhite. It should be equal opportunity to all. It doesn\u2019t make a difference, but it was\nhere terrible when they hold them back, too. It wasn\u2019t right to hold the colored\npeople back and everything. I don\u2019t think it was right.",
        "A: I cried. I couldn\u2019t believe it when it happened. I \u2014 I remember like today that I \u2014\nthat \u2014 when it happened in 1963, when they said that he got shot. First I thought it\nwas a joke. And then, when I saw it on television, it was heartbreaking. His father\nwas a anti-Semite, but the \u2014 the children \u2014 he suffered a lot. All his children, I think,\nhe got punished right and left.",
        "A: Well, I think that is a little too much for me. I don\u2019t \u2014 that I don\u2019t believe in. You\nsee, I was 17, and there was a lot of revolution, even between the people in the\nconcentration camps after \u2014 out of the concentration, in the DP camps, a lot of\npeople were free, and that \u2014 I don\u2019t believe in that. That is one thing I \u2014 I \u2014 I would\nstay away from it. I don\u2019t \u2014 I hope my grandchildren will stay away from it, I don\u2019t\nOctober 22, 1997\nbelieve in it. I believe the old-fashioned way. You love a person, you get married,\nyou settle them and you live. But that \u2014 this kind of a life, with all this disease\nespecially going around, I think is wrong.",
        "A: That is the right way. I mean, a woman shouldn\u2019t be lower than a man. They\nhave the same brain, they have the same ability to work. Matter of fact, in a lot of\nplaces you find women better than men. It should be equal opportunity if you\nqualify for a job, it shouldn\u2019t be a difference you\u2019re a woman or a man. Golda Meir\nwas a great woman, a great president.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I had a lot of problems. I had problems my family was all over,\nuntil I was able to bring my sister over from South America in the family, which\nthey came in 1962 to this country. I still have \u2014 my brother is in Uruguay. I have a\nsister that \u2014 from Canada that sh \u2014 I brought her over. Instead of coming to New\nYork, she went to California, and my other sister in \u2014 that was in Romania, now\nshe\u2019s in Israel. But to get the family together at \u2014 all at once, it\u2019s very difficult.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think I would say that I experienced anti-Semitism in this country.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think anybody with good knowledge would admit that. It only the people\nthat they are denying that, either they were Nazis, or they are anti-Semites.\nOtherwise they would not say it because it\u2019s open to the public and the museums\nand \u2014 and the newspapers and every place else. I don\u2019t think a normal person would\nreally say that there was no Holocaust",
        "A: I tell you, nobody would believe that it could happen again, and nobody would\nwant to believe that it could happen again, but unfortunately, nobody believed it in\nEurope either that it could happen. And the situation in here too, they have\nswastikas in synagogues, they have a lot of swastikas in Jewish homes that they put\non. And there 1s anti-Semite in here. I personally didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t see it in my\nimmediate area or my house, but there are people who could start something like\nthat, if it\u2019s not controlled in that.",
        "A: It\u2019s good in one say and not too good in the other thing, because I think they are\nputting too much effort into it now, and a lot of people resent it.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: There\u2019s a lot of people who feel that they shouldn\u2019t go too much in the past, they\nsh \u2014 instead of that, they should look for the future of the Jewish people, not so\nmuch on the past.",
        "A: I go to Israel often, I have family there, I have friends, very, very good friends\nthat we suffered together, and we correspond together and we meet as many times\nas we go there, if we can. Fortunately we go for three or \u2014 three weeks or four\nweeks and it\u2019s not enough time to see everybody, but \u2014 [break]",
        "A: Well, I really wanted to go to Israel, I wanted to move many times. When the\nchildren were small, I was hesitant, for the simple reason because they\u2019re constantly\non war there, and I didn\u2019t want the boys to throw it up to me and say gee, why did\nyou come? I was hoping they would go on their own and I would follow. So I send\nJerry over for the \u2014 a year to Israel to study, he loved it. And the only mistake that\nthey made 1s, when he applied to law school, he applied to Israel and they told him,\nfinish first, and then come. When he finished and he got married, they said, now\nyou have to go back to school. I was hoping that he wou \u2014 they would go on their\nOctober 22, 1997\nown and then I would follow. But now it\u2019s difficult that they all settled here, for me\nto pick up and go. I love Israel, my husband loves Israel. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t love\nAmerica, I love it here too, but there it\u2019s a different type of living. And I really\nwould enjoy it there maybe better than here. But the thing that the children are here,\nand most of all my grandchildren, I couldn\u2019t stay away from.",
        "A: Well, in the beginning the Jews that went to Israel, they were more Zionist type.\nThey were hardworking people, they really were depending on American fund that\nthey were getting, and they were living different life, very hard life. Like the people\nwho come from Europe, when they started here life wa-was difficult, for them it\nwas 10 times harder. They had to live like in DP camps after they were in Israel,\nand after Israel was declared a state, because they had no facilities there. And they\nworked really very hard. Today it\u2019s a very beautiful country. They work less than\nhere. They have a more normal life as far as social life, and they traveling a lot.\nThey are not settled as much as the American people are settled. They take life in\nday by day because all the time something happens in there. And they want to grab\nthem whatever they can while they\u2019re alive. So that\u2019s why they are more loose in\ntraveling and more loose in life in Israel than here. Life in Israel is beautiful.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m ver \u2014 I\u2019m very close with the family. ve always protected the\nchildren, I was always afraid something that\u2019s gonna happen. When they were small\nI used to get up from bed at night while they were sleeping to listen if they\u2019re\nbreathing. I was so surrounded with dead people, that if they didn\u2019t cry, or they to \u2014\nthey were sleeping, I went to see if they\u2019re alive. So it was fearful no matter how\nlong and no matter how much time after 1t happens. Would the children or even the\ngrandchildren, I watched them today. If I go over there, whatever they do, I said,\nyou do this, now your Mommy and Daddy\u2019s home, not when I\u2019m around you. They\n\u2014 they \u2014 cause they are daring, the children are daring. Mine, I kept them\n[indecipherable] cause I was \u2014 I was always afraid something shouldn\u2019t happen.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I still think that they should know more res-respect for others. I\n\u2014 I believe that today the children are raised a little too loose \u2014 in most of the places,\nnot all. Some of the children, the parents, you know, have a lot of things, they run\naround, they don \u2014 they have strangers watching the children. I don\u2019t approve of\nOctober 22, 1997\nthat. I believe if you have children you gotta be with them and raise them. Hired\nhelp is not the same as you do yourself.",
        "A: They don\u2019t ask too many questions lately. I think they are all up to date with it.\nThey all belong to the gathering, they all get the newspapers. But the \u2014 my little\ngrandchildren start to ask now. I have [indecipherable] and I have three little ones.\nOne is named after my husband\u2019s mother and sister. The other one is named after\nmy aunt and my grandmother, and the little one is named after my husband\u2019s father.\nAnd they all \u2014 we got all three names, and they\u2019 re after the Holocaust survivors\n[indecipherable]. And even her parents, they never requested a name, they \u2014 I\u2019m\nsure they have deaths on their family too, but they sti \u2014 they kept on telling my son,\nif that means so much, the names, to your parents, give it to them. So we have all\nthree names in there. And the children now, the older one is seven. She starts asking\nquestions. She didn\u2019t ask til now, but now she already knows why she\u2019s named after\nher mother and why she perished, and she starts asking questions.",
        "A: [indecipherable] claims he knows. He follows it in school, and he\u2019s reading\nabout it, and he gets some information in the computers.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: If they \u2014 whatever they ask me, if they ask me, I\u2019d be happy to talk to them. But\njust to sit down and starting stories about that, I don\u2019t bring it up. If they don\u2019t bring\nit up, I don\u2019t bring it [indecipherable]",
        "A: No. I figure they know about it. If they wouldn\u2019t know, and what they don\u2019t\nwant to know, then it would bother me, but they all know about it. I never kept it a\nsecret and they never kept it a secret. They all know that they are sur \u2014 that they\nchildren of survivors and they know about it.",
        "A: In a group for me, in the Hadassah occasionally, or in the \u2014 or in the sisterhood,\nif they have questions, or things like that. My husband spoke occasionally in city\nhall about it. But not going out strongly, like many people do.",
        "A: I belong to the groups, I get newspapers. I have an \u2014 wh-when they had the\ngatherings in \u201981 in Israel, we went and made a tape there, in Yad Vashem, I get\nmail from them, I belong to that group. I belong to the museum in here. I get the\nnewspapers in it and all the things that\u2019s happening. We have \u2014 occasionally we\nhave, in our area they have, in a church they have a gathering ever year about the\nOctober 22, 1997\nHolocaust. And they have the interracial groups talking about it and singing Hebrew\nsongs, and I attend them.",
        "A: Many times.",
        "A: I just feel sometimes like I\u2019m slipping in bed. I\u2019m sleeping, and\n[indecipherable] I slip, that somebody\u2019s behind me. And then when I wake up, I\nget ch-chills all over my body. Many times I dream I\u2019m in Auschwitz, many times I\ndream I\u2019m \u2014 I am carrying the ammunition, it explodes in front of me. I see the war\nconstantly, that\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t go out of your mind. [indecipherable]\neven if you think or you don\u2019t think about it. Especially for like I speak about it\nnow, it\u2019s gonna be a couple of weeks til I still gonna see it in front of me.",
        "A: My best surprise are my grandchildren. I adored my children, but nothing like\nmy grandchildren. This is the \u2014 this is the real dividends. And that\u2019s the reason that\nI ben \u2014 that I don\u2019t go too far away, and I always want to be in touch with them.",
        "A: Not really. I think I got more than I expected.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: I would like to see them grow up, my grandchildren and be happy and attend\ngood schools and be in the right side of the street. Know where they\u2019re going and\nwhere they\u2019re coming. I always want them to know where th-the roots are coming.",
        "A: I really haven\u2019t made too many plans. I just hope I'll be well to travel a little\nmore. My husband loves to travel, I don\u2019t. I\u2014 I love mami \u2014 my \u2014 my bed. I love to\nbe home, and I love to get company home.
