        "Answer: Thank you.",
        "Q: We\u2019re going to begin the interview, like we always do, at the beginning. We\u2019re\ngoing to want to know a little bit about your early life, who your family was, and so\non. So I shout \u2014 I shoot out the first question. Where were you born, when were you\nborn? Tell me a little bit about your father, your mother, and any siblings you might\nhave had.",
        "A: I was born in Berlin, in a place called Elssholzstrasse, which is located across a\npark which has something to do with what happens eventually. I was born\nNovember 30, 1925, and I lived in Berlin until 1938, when my family escaped from\nGermany. My father was a \u2014 at that time was working in textiles. He was also born\nin Berlin, as was his grandfather, and probably generations beyond that. And he\nwas in the army, and the World War I. He was a machine-gunner, and sp-spent four\nyears in \u2014 in the army. He survived without any injury, but he did suffer from\ndysentery and almost died, but survived, obviously. He fought in both the eastern\npart, that is in the Russian sector, as well as the western front. And he was a very\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection ;September 12, 2012\npatriotic German, and was highly decorated the end of the war, for his\nachievements.",
        "Q: Do you remember some of the decorations that he got?",
        "A: He \u2014 he \u2014 he earned the Iron Cross on the first and second class, and must have\ndone some outsta \u2014 he never talked about the war. The only thing I know about him\nis from a military pass, which is a little booklet that soldiers have, in which all of\ntheir battles are described. Every battle that\u2019s the unit that he was in, participated in,\nwas identified. And I was able to put all this on a map one day, and I saw that he\nindeed fought on all fronts. He was also \u2014 before he went into the war, he was a \u2014\nhe \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 a window decorator. He was apprenticed at one of the large\nBerlin department stores.",
        "Q: Do you remember the name\u2019?",
        "A: Well, it was probably Tietz, or one of the - Hermann Tietz. And he was quite\ngood in his field. But after the war, when he finally was relieved, he decided he\nwould change his trade. And I\u2019Il go into that later.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: While he was in the army, he was stationed 1n an occupation force, in Estonia.\nAnd in \u2014 in what was then Reval, now Tallinn, the capital of the ci \u2014 of the state.\nAnd he was in uniform. And I only assume that the occupation, at least in that part\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection ;September 12, 2012\nof the world, was quite peaceful. So\u2019s he \u2014 no one seemed to mind that he was in\nuniform. He went to Jewish services on Friday night, and at the end of the service,\nan elderly man came up to him and invited him to come to dinner at his home,\nwhich was [indecipherable] I guess, for Jewish soldiers, when they go to services.\nThere he met a young girl. He was born in 18 na \u2014 1889, and my mother was born\neight \u2014 no, he was born \u2014 and my mother was born in 1898.",
        "Q: That can get confusing.",
        "A: That can be confusing, but it \u2014 it does turn out that way, he \u2014 he was obviously a\nlittle bit older than she. But they apparently fell in love. And while I\u2019ve never had\nhim talk about it, or my mother, they were \u2014 there were letters that I saw, that he\u2019d\nwritten. I should add that he was an avid letter writer. He eventually learned to type\nwith one finger, and was quite good at it. And everything he typed, he made a\ncarbon copy, so that I now have v-volumes of his letters, which describe almost\nanything that ever happened to him. The war years are not there. The war years are\na f\u2014 World War I, that is, were not in any of his letters. But there was a postcard\nwhich he had sent to his then sweetheart, in Tallinn, probably from Berlin, which\nhe bemoans the fact that he is all alone. And he drew a picture of an umbrella\nstanding and leaning against the fence of the house that apparently they lived in.\nAnd he is as lonely as the umbrella.\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection ;September 12, 2012",

There was a \u2014 a Jewish textile section in Berlin, which was quite active,\nand that\u2019s where my father ended up. He decided that being a window trimmer is\nnot a job that a man, when he gets older, can perform, because he\u2019s standing in a\nwindow all day long. And it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s very hard on the body, and it\u2019s hot in the\nsummer and cold in the winter, and that\u2019s not something he wanted to do for the rest\nof his life. Ironically, that\u2019s exactly what he did to the rest of his life. But that was\nafter he came to the United States.

        "A: I\u2014I believe it was clothing. I\u2014 I\u2019m not sure about that, but I think it was\nclothing, that\u2019s what seemed to be the more main thing.",
        "Q: Can you tell me \u2014 well, I have two questions. One of them you anticipated and\nanswered in some way, which was o \u2014 what you knew of your father\u2019s war years,\nand of his family life, had he told you stories, and you say no, he never talked of it.\nAnd yet, you seem to know quite a bit about \u2014 about what his early years were like.\nHow did you find out?",
        "A: Well, these are, at best side remarks he might have made. Some of his letters, of\ncourse, do give me some insight in what happened. But there was never any session\nwith him where I would sit down and say, now tell me about the war years, even\nafter I became a soldier myself. He would tell me little bits and pieces about his\nexperience, which I guess was meant to teach me how to be \u2014 how to take care of\nmyself. It so happened I also became a heavy machine-gunner, which was in the\nfamily, I guess.\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 5September 12, 2012",
        "Q: But it completely by coincidence, huh?",

        "Q: The grain?",
        "A: \u2014 the grain, yes, so \u2014 so that was just his job. That\u2019s what I understand. He must\nhave done well, because th \u2014 we visited him about three or four times.",

So\nshe was fluent in Russian and German and I noticed also she spoke French at one\npoint. She had a musical ear, and languages just flowed into her. The moment she\nstepped foot on the United States, she spoke English.",
        "Q: That\u2019s amazing. There \u2014 there are people who have that \u2014",
        "A: And my father has totally opposite, no \u2014 which is the same, my \u2014 my problem.",

        "A: Well, I\u2014 I was a fairly pampered child. I \u2014 my \u2014 my parents took good care of\nme. I remember my first day in school, I had one of those cornucopias.",
        "Q: You mean, like a real basket of cornucopia?",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: My school years were very happy. I began school in a public school, which was\njust a block down from where we lived. A long block, but it was walkable, and I\nwalked every day to school. My teacher was a very kind man, even though his name\nwas Zorn, which also is the name of a red skinned coach that we had at one time.\nBut Zorn was not angry, which is what zorn means, he was a very kind person. I\nnever had the feeling as I was any different from anyone else. My \u2014 my integration\n DSeptember 12, 2012\n\u2014I played with whoever was willing to play cowboys and Indians, which was the\nmain game of the time, and it was inspired by a man named Karl May, who wrote\nvolumes and volumes about the Indians and cowboys in America, and I heard that\nhe never was in the United States, but he described it so beautifully, that 1t must\nhave been only he, that he thought what he saw was authentic.",
        "Q: Well, Karl May exists to this day in \u2014 in \u2014 when I went to school in Germany,\npeople would tell me about this great writer of Indian stories, who, as an American,\nI had never heard.",
        "A: No, I\u2014 every \u2014 every child was \u2014 was reading that.",
        "Q: Excuse us \u2014 excuse us for a second. [technical interruption] Before we go into\nschool, I wanted to dwell a little bit more about your family. Not only your\nmother\u2019s and father\u2019s background, but tell me a little bit about what their\npersonalities were like. Who did you feel closer to, if you did, and what did they \u2014\nwhat were they like at home\u2019?",
        "A: My \u2014 my father was a typical German businessman. I mean, he would come\nhome, and there would be dinner on the table. And my mother was a typical\nGerman housewife. Her interests were in playing piano. We always had a piano,\nand she was always practicing.

        "A: Well, it \u2014 it \u2014 a businessman went into the home, he never talked about his\nbusiness, but his schedule was very routine, and when he went to work, his mode of\ntransportation was a motorcycle with a sidecar. And the sidecar had the two\ncompartments, and we all fit into that; my mother, my sister, I was in back of my\nfather. And I even have a picture of the maid being in there somewhere. But we did\nhave maids. There was a maid who took care of the house, so that my mother really\nhad a lot of time to herself, and she had \u2014 she visited with people of her own age,\nher \u2014 her \u2014 her people with whom she had relations for many, many years.",

I mean,\nshe lives in Connecticut, and we telephone each other every week, and we speak,\nand this \u2014 but we \u2014 we \u2014 we are different in \u2014 in many ways.

She \u2014 she\u2019s married to an\noptometrist, and she live \u2014 they live in a very small town, you know, that\u2019s \u2014 all her\nlife. My mother, of course, was unhappy with that, because she felt someone should\nlive in a big city, and should participate in all the \u2014 all the cultural offerings that\nwere there. So, in ways, we were different. We \u2014 we did travel a little bit to \u2014 to \u2014 I\nthink we were once in Denmark, on seaside. And \u2014 but otherwise my \u2014 my\nfamily\u2019s weekend activity was in the Jewish rowing club.",

He had his own boat, a double boat, that is for two people, for my\nmother was also rowing with him. And I, on many occasions was the coxswain,\neven though I was just a little kid, I kept a seat there, and acted like I was steering\nthe boat.

But we were playing in this park, and all of a sudden there\nwas a crowd of people who gathered in front of a very large courthouse. On both\nsides of the steps were Gestapo, or actually, I guess they were Gestapo, but they\nwere dressed as Hitler \u2014 Hitler Stormtroopers.",
        "Q: Do you remember their uniforms, what they looked like?",
        "A: They were \u2014 yes, they were brown uniforms, with black pants, and a leather strap\nacross. The leather strap was used whenever there was a fight, they\u2019d take them off\nand just whip people with them. So it was not just a costume, it was a weapon of\nsorts. They stood on both sides of this entryway, which was rather large. And out\ncame a \u2014 a group of men, all dressed in black, carrying attach\u00e9 cases. And there was\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection mSeptember 12, 2012\na lot of booing. Many people had come to the scene by this time. There was a lot of\nnoise being made, shouts. And there was also many people yelling heil Hitler. So\nsomething was going on which was not pleasant. I did not know, as a child, what\nexactly this was. I also began to see now, that the newspapers had turned their\nattention to Jews. The Stormtroopers had their own publication called \u201cDer\nStiirmer,\u2019 which means Stormtrooper, this was their maga \u2014 which was\neverywhere, it was so widely publicized.

I mean, they had faces that no human would\nhave, and hands and hair and noses, and \u2014 ah, caricatures that were obviously highly\noffensive. And as a kid, it was offensive to me as well.

        "Q: How did this become clear? Was there an incident, or was it just you just knew\u2019?",
        "A: I must have felt it. If my parents were concerned about this, they did not\ndemonstrate it to me. I mean, I \u2014 I think they made a real effort not to let our home\nbecome infected by the lo \u2014 the hatred outside.",

        "A: And again, the piano was the center of the \u2014 of the room. My new school was not\na happy place for me, and I\u2014I can only attribute to the fact that I was \u2014 I was\nbeginning to get obviously more tense about what was happening at home.

        "A: And I\u2019m not aware that there was much that changed. My mother, and her\ngirlfriends began talking about jobs which one could do overseas, away from\nGermany. And they were usually either in the maids, or couples, man and wife\nwould go work for some [indecipherable] family, and he would do the yardwork,\nand she would do the home cleaning. They did not have any very ambitious future\nfor themselves.

And this \u2014 this seems\npeculiar to me now; it wasn\u2019t then. There was tension in the family. My father was\nan avid listener to the \u2014 to the radio, and he picked up BBC, which was a very\ndangerous thing to do, because if he got caught, he would certainly be arrested\nimmediately.

She \u2014 first of all, she seemed to know\nEnglish anyhow, from where I don\u2019t know, but she must have learned it somewhere.\nBut there was more. My father was an avid stamp collector. And like his decorating\nskills, his skills with stamps was remarkable. Every single stamp was specially\nprotected against any possible damage. His albums were the neatest and best\nlooking, and he was very careful to buy good stamps. He had a very good \u2014 a\nvaluable collection of stamps. That was his hobby, stamps was his hobby. Rowing\nwas his sport, and the motorcycle, I guess was part of his sport, because he \u2014 we did\ngo out with the cycle very often. I was not at all a sports-type person. I participated\nreluctantly in any sport that I had to participate in. I was good in nothing.

        "Q: But did you like the rowing?",

        "A: I\u2014 Thad the tension \u2014 yes, I clearly did realize. I mean, there were \u2014 there were\ncertain things said and done at home, which \u2014 which did bother me.",
        "Q: Can you tell us what they were?",
        "A: Well, there were discussions about how to get out, and how to find somebody to\nprovide us the help that we needed. And this leads to, you know, at a certain point,\nand \u2014 and it was so late in deciding that something had to be done, that it\u2019s almost\nmiraculous that something did get \u2014 come out of this. The first thing they did was\ntry to find somebody who could provide us with affidavit to go somewhere. And my\nmother, somehow became a ter \u2014 different person, all of a sudden. She turned from\na social, very light, butterfly-type person, into a real tiger. She remembered that her\nfather said at one point that he had a brother who had emigrated to the United\nStates, and he not only knew that, he also knew his name, which no longer was\nOrganitsky(ph), but now became Miller.

So that I could only imagine that my mother must have done a good bit of the\nstanding in line and \u2014 and talking. And she was a wonderful talker. I mean, she\ncould persuade anyone of anything that she needed done. So she should have been\nsuccessful, but this was not \u2014 not here. Anyhow, a letter went back to my Uncle\nMorris(ph), and told him this was not good enough. But he was obviously not\nsatisfied with that, and he found himself a \u2014 another man.

It was his\nbelief that the most dangerous \u2014 the greatest danger was for Jewish men; that they\nwere not after the women, or after the children, they were only after the men.

        "A: But the \u2014 but the Gestapo was there, and the Stormtroopers were there, and I\nimagine they were there not only for the purpose of \u2014 of watching them leave the\nbuilding, but maybe they also took them away. I\u2019m not sure.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what happened.",
        "Q: And then \u2014 so let\u2019s jump forward again, and you talk about Kristallnacht. Tell\nus about how Kristallnacht happened in your life.",
        "A: I was going to school, I was walking. There were all within walking distance, I\nwalked to school. At the corner of the street where I lived, there was a very large art\nsupply shop. Now, I was always interested in art, a-and drawing, an-and \u2014 and\npictures and things of that sort. And I stopped at that window almost every day I\nwent to school or came home, looking for anything that \u2014 new that might have\nappeared, any implement for artists. And while most of this was well beyond my\ncap-capability, it was interesting for me to do that. But one day I came by, and the\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection -September 12, 2012\nstore was totally demolished.

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And everything in the window was stole, there was nothing left. And that was \u2014\nmade a big impression. Not only did I lose my happy window shopping, but I saw\nsome \u2014 some very dangerous things were happening.",

        "A: I mean, my father was an astute listener to the news, and my mother was bright\nenough to know what was going on, yes, I would say they do. And \u2014 but I \u2014 I\u2019ve\nnever talked to them about that.",
        "Q: Now, was your father in London by the time Kristallnacht happened?",
        "A: Yes.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Before my father left, he did two things. He bought tickets for a sh \u2014 a sea\nvoyage to New York, on the Cunard lines, which left, that time, Hamburg. And\nhe had these tickets, I guess, or had them \u2014 at least bought and had some kind of\nreceipt for them. Cause when he was in London, he sent a letter to Cunard, saying,\nI bought these in Berlin, can I use them in London as well? And I guess, yes, they\ncould. And so he had tickets. He also hired a furniture moving company to take our\nfurniture and sell it to Scranton, Pennsylvania. And whereas every other home was\nimmediately ransacked by whoever was the Gestapo that time, when we were about\nto leave, my mother then was in charge, she couldn\u2019t take any money with her, or\nany jewelry, but she bought watches for all of us, so we were walking around with\nwatches. But otherwise, there was no money at all. And lo and behold, this huge\ntruck pulls up in front of our house with a lift van, these huge boxes that they put\nfurniture in, took our furniture and six months later when we came to Scranton,\nthere is was. The \u2014 they called us up, says pick it up in the port of New York.

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: This was paid for, he had receipt, and they\u2019re supposed to go get it, and that\u2019s\nwhat they did. They were not part of the Gestapo, obviously, and if the Gestapo\nwere there, they probably would have immediately interceded and stopped them.\nWe eventually were sorry that all that furniture came, because we had no place to\nput that furniture. But that\u2019s another story.",
        "Q: I want to ask a few thing \u2014 now, that means then, that those first denials by the\nU.S. embassy in Berlin were reversed, that eventually you did get permission to go\nto the US.",
        "A: Not \u2014 I\u2019m not there yet.",

        "A: I should have started that earlier, but 1t \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s important to note how well\nestablished, how confident, and how open they were, as a Jewish community. I have\na book here.",

        "Q: That\u2019s huge.",
        "A: Now, there were about 160,000 Jews in Berlin. I don\u2019t know whether this 1s\n160,000, or what that number is. But it lists every Jewish name, every Jewish\nhousehold, and a street address, and had an introduction, which is quite voluminous,\nto explain the position on all of the Jewish community in Berlin, and some of the\npeople who were exceptionally well-known, including Albert Einstein.",
        "Q: Yeah. Do you think his address is in there?",
        "A: Well, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it were in there.",

        "A: No, it was the only \u2014 no, this apparently is something that \u2014 that was designed to\nlet the ge \u2014 Nazi government know that the Jewish community in Berlin was sub \u2014\nsa \u2014 was substantial, it was well-endowed, and that it was \u2014 historically been there\nforever.",

        "A: They were anticipating what might come. They felt it was still a time where they\ncould influence the new government, if it were to come, of where the Jewish\ncommunity was. And all I could think of was that this must have been very helpful\nto the Gestapo, because it was now easy to find every Jew in Berlin.",

        "A: And they needed to go no further than this book, until pub \u2014 published in many\ncopies.",

        "Q: Okay.",

But at one point, after the Nazis came\ninto power, and the Nuremberg laws came into effect, the club was no longer\nallowed to participate in this effort, and it was obviously hurtful to them, that they\nwere all sad and left out of such an important \u2014",

And the albums are usually a fairly thick covers, filled with\n 49September 12, 2012\nsome kind of cotton, or material to make them soft. And what my father said, take\nall that stuff out of the covers, so you leave a \u2014 an empty space, and then put my\nstamps in there. He had a number of those made by him, and they all looked like\nphoto albums, but no pictures in them. I don\u2019t know whether he took pictures in\nthem or not. But he sent them out as photo albums. Martin Schwartz(ph) got\nseveral of them. And I am not sure whether he sent any to London.

I mean, the\n\u2014 the discussion among the women in the club now was only about who went\nwhere, and who can find someplace to go.

        "A: George Susskind(ph) had no way to leave Germany, he and his family were\njust unable to find any way, even though he was a prosperous banker, and obviously\nhad good connections, but there was no possible way for him to go out. As soon as\n\u2014 and be-because the orderly was so grateful to George, they had an annual meeting\nin Christmas time, when they had dinner together, I think at George\u2019s home,\nbecause he probably had a very ostentatious home. And when this man, who\n <6September 12, 2012\nbecame a policeman \u2014 but throughout the Nazi period, they would still have these\nannual meetings. At one point, when Jews were required to put on the star, the guy\nsaid to him, you know what? You better come see me in my office. And George\nwent to see him, and from that point on, this guy gave him identification papers of\nsome other name. And throughout the war, he was able to do that periodically, so\nthat he would always be able to move somewhere else, find a place to live, work\nsomewhere. And he was able to get his food stamps, which are needed, and a\npassport, through this police officer, who by this time became a senior police officer\nin the German police forces. His wife went \u2014 and I\u2019m not sure exactly what the\nsituation was, but he and \u2014 she and the daughter went to some family on the farm\nsomewhere, and hid, were in hiding, in fact. And stayed that way throughout the\nwar. Before I go into the after war story, I'd like to talk about the burning of the\nsynagogue. When Kristallnacht was the day, or the night during which every\nJewish store was not only demolished, but every synagogue was burned. The only\nexceptions were synagogues that were built within certain apartment blocks, and\nwould have been too dangerous to put them on fire, so they were \u2014 one, I think was\nsaved, that\u2019s it. Many years after this, my father received a letter from the rabbi of\nthe synagogue, with whom my father had corresponded before, and he sent him the\n\u2014 his own personal observation of the burning of the synagogue.\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection =nSeptember 12, 2012",

        "A: A-And that was wa \u2014 how we identified the synagogue. I have a picture of that\nsynagogue afterwards, burned. But he described exactly what happened that day. He\nwas called in the middle of the night by the caretaker of building, he was not\nJewish, who said, our synagogue 1s burning. And the rabbi immediately hastened to\nthe site, and stood there while the firemen, who were carefully hosing down all the\nbuildings nearby, so that they would not catch on fire, but left the synagogue\nburning. It burned into a shell. The walls were still standing, but everything else\nwas gone. It was a beautiful synagogue, and I used to go there and \u2014 and look up\ninto the ceiling, which was domed, and there were stars. And I knew that\u2019s where\nGod was. That was my connection to the synagogue. It was a very sad experience.\n <8September 12, 2012\nMartin Swarzenski, the rabbi was one of the great rabbis of the Jewish\ncommunity. The Jewish community, by the way, in Germany, I think to this day,\nrabbis and church officials are government employees, they get paid by the\ngovernment, so the community doesn\u2019t ever have to worry about paying for their\nministers. But h-he was a dedicated rabbi. He was a very courageous man. He\ninsisted on staying be \u2014 though he had an opportunity to leave, until they finally\narrested him, put him in a concentration camp, and because he had a visa or permit\nto leave Germany, he was eventually let go. He became a rabbi in the United\nStates, in Madison, Wisconsin. While I was working here at the museum, as a\nvisitor service, a man started talking to me about his community in Madison,\nWisconsin. And he said he was a member of one of those fraternal brotherhoods,\nwhich had an annual dedication, or ceremony when Swarzenski died. He was there\nthe rabbi \u2014 this man was not Jewish.

        "Q: I see.",

I\nmean, I could tell because of my early years on boats, I loved the water. I became a\nsailor eventually, but this was the early initiation to the season, I loved it. I used to\nbe on the fantail, which was the \u2014 one of the places we were permitted to go. In\nthose days these classes were very much separated, and you couldn\u2019t just walk in\nanywhere you want to. So I went up to a little \u2014 a boy who was my age, and we start\ntalking.

And again we had these\nmaids and cooks, and \u2014 and we lived a very \u2014 I must say, Vienna at that time was a\nvery sad place.

I remember being at a service for \u2014 not sure, probably a Seder. And there\nwere these people who, you know, wore old clothes that were given to them by\npeople that no longer could use these clothes, and \u2014 and it was a very sad looking\npeople. The \u2014 the Viennese themselves had little food. I remember some person\nwho was grateful to me for \u2014 an elderly woman who \u2014 whom I gave I don\u2019t know\nwhat to. I had all this \u2014 all these cigarettes and all this liquor, and I just gave it\naway, and \u2014 to whoever I thought might be able to make something out of it.

        "A: Was all new to me. Vienna was still an exciting city. We went to \u2014 the Soviets\noccupied one-quarter of the city, and we a \u2014 occupied a third. The French had a\nsection, the British had a section, the Americans had a section, and the fourth\nquarter was for the Soviets, they had most of it. And when \u2014 in this \u2014 they insisted\nthat the Austrians start their cultural programs, they insisted the \u2014 that the\nsymphony would play again. And I was there when it opened up, and it was a very\nfestive occasion, and the Russians were honored for having been so a-active in \u2014 in\ngetting the culture of the city moving.

My \u2014 my section was just concerned with\nthat, and m \u2014 you know, there was a tremendous fear, actually, in the \u2014 at first, as to\nwhy do they have all these Soviet troops?

I mean, it became clear eventually, the reason they had them there,\nbecause they had no jobs for them back in Russia. And obviously it was safer to\nkeep them a-at bay in \u2014 in Austria and Germany, than to bring them home. That\n 90September 12, 2012\nwas probably one of the main reasons they were there.

        "A: The one of our dues \u2014 before I came to Vienna, we were involved with what was\nactually an army project, but we were there assisting, I guess, which was to collect\nscientists.

        "A: Oh yes. The idea that they might go to the United States was enough of an\nattraction to \u2014 we \u2014 we practically had to shoo them away, and eventually we had so\nmany people who claimed to be scientists and had really nothing to offer. But I did\nhave one case, which I think was quite interesting. It\u2019s the -a\u2014a-\u2014a woman\nappeared, who was a very small \u2014 she was small stature, and her name was Hanna\nReitsch.",

        "A: She was a topmost German test pilot. She actually flew their latest developments\nin jet aircraft, and was obviously very valuable to our \u2014 our people. And for some\nreason she came to me, or I was assigned to talk to her. And it was not an\ninterrogation, these were discussions we had with people, because there was neither\nthe time, nor the facilities for doing anything more than that. And as I was talking to\nher, she pulls out of her handbag, whatever she had, a huge medal, which was a\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 93September 12, 2012\nswastika surrounded by diamonds.

It was just unbelievably heavy.\nShe gave it to me, and I held it and I looked at it, I said, I don\u2019t want anything to do\nwith this sort of stuff. I gave it back to her, and to this day I wonder what she ever\ndid with it, because she took it, I\u2019m sure, back.

        "A: No, you know, that-that\u2019s an interesting question, because I \u2014 I could never find\nthe answer to that. They \u2014 there were obviously teams doing that, I mean, the army\nhad far more facilities and personnel to do that kind of work than we did.

Not in my unit. I\u2014 I do \u2014 I don\u2019t speak for the OSS, because it\n 93September 12, 2012\nwas just too diverse, and there were too many different people doing too many\ndifferent things, for me to say what OSS was doing. I can only say my unit had this\none task, which was to interrogate, or at least to \u2014 to get to know a scientist well\nenough to make a judgment whether it\u2019s worthwhile to send him onto somebody\nmore technically competent to do the interrogation.

It \u2014 it certainly was, 1n some fashion, to see\nyour old neighborhood again, to be able to recognize it. And \u2014 and \u2014 but, if I did\nthis several times, I went back to Berlin a number of times. Last time I took the\nwhole family, all my kids, and grandchildren. And I wanted to show them where I\nlived, and by this time Berlin, cause was perfectly rebuilt. They rebuilt my street,\nHaberland Strasse to where it be \u2014 was exactly as it was before. They used the\nsame plans. The number on my \u2014 on the house where I lived, 30, was the same as it\nwas when I lived in it. Every inch of it looked exactly the same way as it did when I\nlived there. And so much of Berlin is actually been rebuilt that way, so the city still\nlooks like an old, well-kept \u2014 now well-kept city. The neighborhood where I was\nborn, where I played in the [indecipherable] the \u2014 the garden is still the pl \u2014 the\nlittle plaza, is still there, the justice building is still there. It became the headquarters\nof the four power allied conference. They had their meetings in that place, it was a \u2014\na very stately building, and certainly suitable for that purpose. And there it was,\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection \u2018opSeptember 12, 2012\nright in my neighborhood, and that\u2019s where I saw the Jewish la \u2014 the Jewish lawyers\nbeing whisked away, somewhere.",

But the Jewish community\nin Berlin now is tremendous. I mean, I think probably larger than it was when \u2014\nwhen we left there. It \u2014 the synagogues are flourishing.

I had reached the \u2014 the\nfabulous grade of Buck Sergeant, which is about as low as you can get in the\nsergeant business, and I thought I was doing pretty good.

So we went to Yale. And nobody wants to believe this story, because it was\nso odd. I took a test or two, talked to somebody, and next thing I knew, I was at\nYale, and I spent four years there.",
        "Q: What did you study?",
        "A: I studied, of all things, history and Russian. And Russian kind of escaped \u2014 even\nthough I went home every weekend \u2014 hitchhiked, re \u2014 I became a very \u2014 a very\ngood hitchhiker.

What should we know, what should we understand\nabout them? What would you say?",
        "A: First of all, we were \u2014 the American community was a very tightly knit\ncommunity. We had our own schools, we had the PX, we had our own movie\ntheater, and we could live totally in isolation from the German people.",

        "A: It makes a difference. I don\u2019t fi \u2014 I never really have felt any real animosity to\nGermans. I mean, I \u2014 I have \u2014 I have the philosophy that people are people, and that\nyou can take any group of people, and make anything you want out of them, if you\nhave the right tools for it. And Goebbels was actually the master of that genre. He\nwas able to persuade the German people that there was indeed a danger, that Jews\nhad to be eliminated, and most Germans seemed to believe that. And unfortunately,\nyou could do that anywhere. I mean, you \u2014 we\u2019ve seen this every day in our own\nhistory, and we see it today in \u2014 1n \u2014 in o \u2014 our efforts overseas, to create some kind\nof order.

        "A: The Holocaust is simply an example of how easy it is to mislead people into\nbelieving something. I mean, I must give credit to Goebbels, he did this with a\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 1September 12, 2012\ntactful \u2014 with a \u2014 with a tactics that were exceedingly professional. He made people\nbelieve the Jews were no longer human beings. That you could do anything you\nwant to with them, because they were not like us. They had different blood, they\nhad different \u2014 you \u2014 you see upstairs, when you go through the mi \u2014 exhibits, they\nmeasured heads of people to show how different our Aryans are from say non-\nAryans. Certainly different from people of different colors. You could measure that,\nyou can | \u2014 you can look at that from various aspects, and sure enough, they\u2019re not\nthe same people as pure blooded Aryans. And that was believed. This blood theory\nwent a long way towards making Germans believe that they are supermen, that they\nhad some powers other do not have. They deserve what was coming to them, one\nway or another. Today Germany has probably the most progressive education on\nthe Holocaust. I mean, I was in Berlin, went to the Jewish museum, and they had\nexhibited pictures of department stores which belonged to Jews. And most of the\nbig department stores were owned by Jews. And the people were surprised, you\nknow, they had no idea that this was actually the case. The museum also had to\nteach the German people what Jews were. All of a sudden, you walk in, the first \u2014\nand they change exhibits periodically, but when I went there for the first time, first\nthing you came across was the mikveh, to show people what ritual bath was like,\nwhy it was there. And then from there and so progressingly, here\u2019s what Judaism\u2019s\n113September 12, 2012\nall about. And it\u2019s being taught. I\u2019ve seen their schoolbooks, their curriculums, and\nthey are very careful to teach this, the Holocaust. So you can turn people from one\ndirection to another.",

Not only your\nmother\u2019s and father\u2019s background, but tell me a little bit about what their\npersonalities were like. Who did you feel closer to, if you did, and what did they \u2014\nwhat were they like at home\u2019?",

        "Q: Is this \u2014 on what \u2014 what body of water was this within Berlin? Was it the river\nSpree?",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: Yeah. Well, it sounds like a very happy childhood.",
        "Q: Can I interrupt just for a second, however? You say self-confident, but it also\nsounds self-contained, in that I don\u2019t hear that there would be much interaction with\npeople who were non-Jews.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about World War I.",
        "Q: Yeah. So did you have any interaction with kids who were not Jewish?",

        "Q: \u2014 Id like to get the sense from you, as through a child\u2019s eyes, how you perceived\nthem, and, you know, what one learns afterwards, can put it into context. But how\ndid you experience those larger political changes, 1n your own life?",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: Were you scared?",
        "Q: How did it become clear?",
        "Q: How did this become clear? Was there an incident, or was it just you just knew\u2019?",
        "Q: Did you sense though, that they themselves were more \u2014 or that they were less\neasygoing than earlier, or were they sadder, or more serious at home? Or you didn\u2019t\nsense these things?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So this would be the early 1930s?",

        "Q: So that would be a B grade, something \u2014",
        "Q: Like, what would they say? Do you remember any specific examples of what\nthey would say?",
        "Q: Okay. Now, do you think that might have been because the teachers were being\n\u2014 becoming more biased, or because your behavior was really that way?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: How many rooms?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. That\u2019s pretty large.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Did your mother not like that?",
        "Q: But did you like the rowing?",
        "Q: It sounds like the tension was internalized, without you even realizing it, when\nyou were, you know, during these school years. Or, is it that you did realize it?",
        "Q: Can you tell us what they were?",
        "Q: Well, he was in Estonia.",
        "Q: That\u2019s pretty late.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. His uncle\u2019s son.",
        "Q: So they would have been your sponsors, in other words, in the United States.",
        "Q: They would have been your sponsors, your uncle would have been the sponsor.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: We'll get to that, we\u2019ll get to that.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: This was the embassy in Berlin.",
        "Q: Can I stop, just for a second? Did your mother \u2014 I mean, can you des \u2014 were you\nthere, did you go to the embassy, did she go by herself, did your father go? Do you\nhave any \u2014 any details from how \u2014 what kind of experience they had?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: This is the U.S. embassy in Berlin.",
        "Q: Yes, I\u2019d like, very much. And at the same time, let\u2019s not forget, I\u2019d like to hear a\nlittle bit more about the Jewish communities, not just one, in Berlin. I believe you\nhave a book that shows just how many there were. So I\u2019d like to show that, but let\u2019s\nread the letter first. Okay. I think it\u2019s in the other side, the \u2014 the glasses.",
        "Q: So this is the letter he\u2019s written before he becomes a refugee?",
        "Q: How nerve-wracking.",
        "Q: But you \u2014 but he didn\u2019t pass it on to you at home.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and it \u2014 in such detail.",
        "Q: No, what I mean to say \u2014 I\u2014 I meant to express it this way, that he didn\u2019t \u2014 this\nknowledge that he had, he did not talk about it with you at home, in an effort to\nprotect you. That\u2019s what I\u2019m getting this \u2014",
        "Q: No?",
        "Q: Well, had you heard then, in your family, of acquaintances, or people that you\nknew, who were arrested all of a sudden on the street, like he mentions in this\nletter? Had that been something that was common knowledge in discussion?",
        "Q: Right, yeah.",
        "Q: My question 1s a little bit more precise, it is, do you remember hearing about\nsuch things?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back, just for a second. I know I\u2019m interrupting again.",
        "Q: That, and we never finished finding out who were these men who were with the\nblack suits and the suitcases, who were being booed out of that building?",
        "Q: And why were they being booed?",
        "Q: So, they \u2014 they \u2014 these were Jewish lawyers?",
        "Q: And that was \u2014 and you were eight years old when \u2014 1933, and \u2014 and so you saw\nthis probably, very soon thereafter.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Ah \u2014 okay, I just wanted to clear \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 I di\u2014 you know, address that \u2014 that they were being dismissed from their jobs,\nprobably.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: And then \u2014 so let\u2019s jump forward again, and you talk about Kristallnacht. Tell\nus about how Kristallnacht happened in your life.",
        "Q: Jude.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you feel like you were in danger at that point, by that point?",
        "Q: And your family, did they \u2014 did \u2014 you know, was your father still there?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Now, was your father in London by the time Kristallnacht happened?",
        "Q: He was. So you were alone in Berlin with your mom.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: I want to ask a few thing \u2014 now, that means then, that those first denials by the\nU.S. embassy in Berlin were reversed, that eventually you did get permission to go\nto the US.",
        "Q: Okay. All right. All right, so \u2014",
        "Q: Yes, let\u2019s do that.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, let\u2019s take a look at it.",
        "Q: That\u2019s huge.",
        "Q: Yeah. Do you think his address is in there?",
        "Q: It\u2019s a hu \u2014 that\u2019s a very thick book for just a Jewish com \u2014 1s it the only time that\nsuch a book was put together, or was it part of a regular printing?",
        "Q: So this was done in 1931 - 1932, that means that they were anticipating that the\nNazis were \u2014",
        "Q: How iron \u2014 how sadly ironic.",
        "Q: Can I take a look at that? Thank you very much. Can we focus on this a little?\nQ2: Yeah, and I did get a shot of it, but 1t\u2019s \u2014 it \u2014 you got it in the dark there, so I\nneed to \u2014",
        "Q: Okay. \u201cJudisches Adressbuch fur Gross-Berlin,\u2019 means Jewish Address book\nfrom Greater Berlin.\nQ2: Hold it there just a second.",
        "Q: And I saw earlier that \u2014\nQ2: Yeah, do me a favor then, just turn it a \u2014 turn it around and open it.",
        "Q: Turn it around and open it, yeah. Okay. And, if I can, I would like to look up two\nnames here. We talked about Mr. Einstein, let\u2019s see if he\u2019s in here. Einhorn,\nEinick(ph). Einstein, Albert, professor, West 30. I don\u2019t know if you can see that.\nQ2: Hold it so I can see it.",
        "Q: Pardon?\nQ2: No, no, no, no, just keep it there.",
        "Q: Okay. Einstein, second column. Okay, am I still in the way?\nQ2: No, you\u2019re good. Let me just find it, though. Point it out.",
        "Q: Right here.\nQ2: Oh, over here. There he is.",
        "Q: Got it?\nQ2: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: All right, and then we\u2019re going to look up Mr. Liebenau\u2019s family. It was very\nthorough, we found Albert. Excuse me. Liebenau, right here, Kurt(ph). Second\ncolumn again, right there. That was \u2014\nQ2: Now move your finger down.",
        "Q: Do you see? Kurt(ph) Liebenau above it. Mr. Liebenau\u2019s father. Thank you.\nWell, that\u2019s \u2014",

And the rabbi immediately hastened to\nthe site, and stood there while the firemen, who were carefully hosing down all the\nbuildings nearby, so that they would not catch on fire, but left the synagogue\nburning. It burned into a shell. The walls were still standing, but everything else\nwas gone. It was a beautiful synagogue, and I used to go there and \u2014 and look up\ninto the ceiling, which was domed, and there were stars. And I knew that\u2019s where\nGod was.

It was like somebody\nmust have watched this synagogue being burned, and all these houses next to them\nbeing saved, that a stick of bombs must have hit that whole neighborhood.

        "A: In the Soviet sector, the Jewish community, that whole area that east Berlin was\nin the Soviet sector. He actually took his gun off his shoulder, point it at me and\nsays, come. And I simply acted like I didn\u2019t understand the term, and I walked\naway. And to this day I wonder why he didn\u2019t shoot me.

And \u2014 and \u2014 but, if I did\nthis several times, I went back to Berlin a number of times. Last time I took the\nwhole family, all my kids, and grandchildren. And I wanted to show them where I\nlived, and by this time Berlin, cause was perfectly rebuilt. They rebuilt my street,\nHaberland Strasse to where it be \u2014 was exactly as it was before. They used the\nsame plans. The number on my \u2014 on the house where I lived, 30, was the same as it\nwas when I lived in it. Every inch of it looked exactly the same way as it did when I\nlived there. And so much of Berlin is actually been rebuilt that way, so the city still\nlooks like an old, well-kept \u2014 now well-kept city. The neighborhood where I was\nborn, where I played in the [indecipherable] the \u2014 the garden is still the pl \u2014 the\nlittle plaza, is still there, the justice building is still there.

It was never really\nmuch destroyed, because the allied moved into it as soon as they had got themselves\norganized, because that became the headquarters.

My father and my\nmother were totally different. They visited us eventually in Berlin, when I was\nstationed there, but they felt that every person of a certain age was a Nazi, and\ncouldn\u2019t get out of their heads that \u2014 that there was anybody else in Germany.

But the Jewish community\nin Berlin now is tremendous. I mean, I think probably larger than it was when \u2014\nwhen we left there. It \u2014 the synagogues are flourishing.

I had reached the \u2014 the\nfabulous grade of Buck Sergeant, which is about as low as you can get in the\nsergeant business, and I thought I was doing pretty good.

It\nwas middle of January, I had to get there, and when I did, you had to fly. But the\n109\nSeptember 12, 2012\nplanes were very slow. My \u2014 my wife was breastfeeding the boy, who was by that\ntime about two week \u2014 three weeks old, or \u2014 he was really a baby.

        "A: First of all, we were \u2014 the American community was a very tightly knit\ncommunity. We had our own schools, we had the PX, we had our own movie\ntheater, and we could live totally in isolation from the German people.",
        "A: Well, we almost did.",

I even had a daughter born in Berlin, and in Berlin Jewish \u2014\nI guess in the la \u2014 army hospital. But our lives were separate. Our neighbors were\nAmericans, our kids played with American children. Our contact with Germans was\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 1September 12, 2012\nminimal, and unless you went out of your way to go shopping in [indecipherable]\nor elsewhere, it was a \u2014 a different life. And we were the occupation.",
        "A: It makes a difference. I don\u2019t fi \u2014 I never really have felt any real animosity to\nGermans. I mean, I \u2014 I have \u2014 I have the philosophy that people are people, and that\nyou can take any group of people, and make anything you want out of them, if you\nhave the right tools for it. And Goebbels was actually the master of that genre. He\nwas able to persuade the German people that there was indeed a danger, that Jews\nhad to be eliminated, and most Germans seemed to believe that. And unfortunately,\nyou could do that anywhere. I mean, you \u2014 we\u2019ve seen this every day in our own\nhistory, and we see it today in \u2014 1n \u2014 in o \u2014 our efforts overseas, to create some kind\nof order. People can be made to believe anything. We are a very unfinished specie\nof animal. We still have a long ways to go.",
        "A: The Holocaust is simply an example of how easy it is to mislead people into\nbelieving something. I mean, I must give credit to Goebbels, he did this with a\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 1September 12, 2012\ntactful \u2014 with a \u2014 with a tactics that were exceedingly professional. He made people\nbelieve the Jews were no longer human beings. That you could do anything you\nwant to with them, because they were not like us. They had different blood, they\nhad different \u2014 you \u2014 you see upstairs, when you go through the mi \u2014 exhibits, they\nmeasured heads of people to show how different our Aryans are from say non-\nAryans. Certainly different from people of different colors. You could measure that,\nyou can | \u2014 you can look at that from various aspects, and sure enough, they\u2019re not\nthe same people as pure blooded Aryans. And that was believed. This blood theory\nwent a long way towards making Germans believe that they are supermen, that they\nhad some powers other do not have. They deserve what was coming to them, one\nway or another. Today Germany has probably the most progressive education on\nthe Holocaust. I mean, I was in Berlin, went to the Jewish museum, and they had\nexhibited pictures of department stores which belonged to Jews. And most of the\nbig department stores were owned by Jews. And the people were surprised, you\nknow, they had no idea that this was actually the case. The museum also had to\nteach the German people what Jews were. All of a sudden, you walk in, the first \u2014\nand they change exhibits periodically, but when I went there for the first time, first\nthing you came across was the mikveh, to show people what ritual bath was like,\nwhy it was there. And then from there and so progressingly, here\u2019s what Judaism\u2019s\n113September 12, 2012\nall about. And it\u2019s being taught. I\u2019ve seen their schoolbooks, their curriculums, and\nthey are very careful to teach this, the Holocaust. So you can turn people from one\ndirection to another.",
