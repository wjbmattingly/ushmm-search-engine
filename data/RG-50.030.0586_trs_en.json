        "Question: Good morning.",
        "Answer: Good morning, Joan.",
        "Q: It\u2019s really lovely to see you.",
        "A: Thank you. Lovely to see you.",
        "Q: Thank you. What was your name \u2014 what is your name now?",
        "A: My name is Ninetta Feldman.",
        "Q: And what was your name at birth?",
        "A: My name at birth was Ninetta. I was actually named after my grandmother, which\nwas the tradition in Greece, to have the daughter of \u2014 the first daughter to be named after\nthe mother of the father. So my grandmother\u2019s name was Sarah, so I became Sarah,\nSerena, Nina, Ninetta. So I ended up with Ninetta. I had many first cousins with name\nwas Nina, they also were named after my grandmother Sarah, but they used the Nina. I-\nIt -",
        "Q: Was her name Nina also?",
        "A: No, her \u2014 my grandmother\u2019s name was Sarah, Sarah, but the \u2014 the granddaughters\nwere named either Nina or \u2014 Nina, for the most part. I was an exception.",
        "Q: You were Ninetta.",
        "A: Ninetta.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "Q: And your last name?",
        "A: My n-\u2014my last name, maiden name is Matza.",
        "Q: Now, th \u2014 when it\u2019s a male, it\u2019s Matsas, is that correct?",
        "A: Matsas, right. And if it\u2019s a female 1s Matza, which really means you are the daughter\nof Matsas. In \u2014 in Greece, you\u2019re either the daughter of someone, or the wife of\nsomeone. So it\u2019s the \u2014 you \u2014 you decline the \u2014 the \u2014 the name, Matsas, of Matza \u2014 of\nMatsas, which becomes Matsas, the generative \u2014 you decline the name. And so my\nname, maiden name is Matza, not Matsas.",
        "Q: Right. Now, wh-wh-when one 1s named after the \u2014 your grandmother \u2014",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: Sarah \u2014 when you were named after your grandmother \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 was she still alive?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: So this is different than in the Ashkenazi tradition isn\u2019t it?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That you can be named in the Sephardic tradition with someone who\u2019s alive.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. I think the Greek Jews adopted this tradition from the Christians because\nthe Christian Greeks also name their children after the grandparents, regardless whether\nthey\u2019re living or not, and so the first son is named after the father of the father, after the\nSeptember 14, 2010\ngrandfather. The father of the father. The second son will be named after the father of the\nmother.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: The \u2014 if there\u2019s a daughter, the first daughter will be named after the mother of the\nfather, and the second daughter after the mother of the \u2014 the f\u2014 the mother, after the\nmother of the mother. So it creates a lot of confusion, because there are so many people\nwith the same first name and surname.",
        "Q: Right, right. And what \u2014 when were you born?",
        "A: I was born March 21\u2018, 1938.",
        "Q: Right, so you were a very young child at the time.",
        "A: Very young, yes.",
        "Q: Now was \u2014 y-you have a brother, Michael.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Was he named after \u2014",
        "A: After my grandfather Nahoum.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Now, to have a name like Nahoum in Greece does not make a child very comfortable,\nbecause it\u2019s very unusual. So he was \u2014 he grew up known by that \u2014 his nickname,\nMykas(ph), his friends called him Mykas(ph), but his official name is Nahoum. And\nSeptember 14, 2010\nthen when he came to the United States, he changed his name further, from \u2014 Mykas(ph)\nbecame Michael.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But his birth name is Nahoum, after my grandfather.",
        "Q: And his \u2014 and his middle name now, is Nahoum.",
        "A: Right, right, he retained the name, but became his middle name, yes.",
        "Q: Now, since you were so young at the time, do you think you can distinguish between\nwhat your earliest memories are, and what you were told happened, or is that difficult?",
        "A: That\u2019s a very, very good question, I often sort of struggle with it, trying to determine\nwhether my recollection is a firsthand experience, or it\u2019s a reconstruction of what I heard\nfrom \u2014 so many times from my parents and my brother. There are certain scenes that I\nknow for sure; I\u2019m talking about the earliest recollections, when I was perhaps three\nyears old. There\u2019s certain scenes that I \u2014 I know, I remember very vividly. And I know\nthese are firsthand recollections.",
        "Q: So perhaps when we speak, you can make a distinction between what you know, or\nyour f\u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 your own memories, and what you\u2019re not sure about \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 and what you were told.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Maybe we can do tho \u2014 all \u2014 all of those three things.",
        "A: Yes, yes, I can do that.",
        "Q: So what \u2014 what is \u2014 what are your earliest memories?",
        "A: My earliest memory is when I was three years old, and I was a \u2014 in 1941 \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 there was a time when my father was drafted to the army, and we decided, the whole\nfamily decided to move to Ioannina. He was supposed to report in Ioannina. That\u2019s\nwhere his company was going to assemble, and march north towards the Greek-Albanian\nborder. And we decided it would be better for all of us to move to Ioannina, since we\nhad so many relatives there. And so we \u2014 we lived at my aunt\u2019s house, my mother\u2019s\nsister\u2019s house. And there we were surrounded by \u2014 by so many close relatives, all our\nentire family was there; grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins. And I have this image of a\nvery long table in my grandmother\u2019s house, where all the grandchildren were assembled,\nand my grandmother serving rizogalo. Rizogalo is rice pudding, and I had to have this\nvery vivid scene in my mind of my grandmother and all the children gathered around the\ntable. That\u2019s my earliest recollection.",
        "Q: Do you remember moving to Ioannina, or \u2014 or you don\u2019t remember that?",
        "A: The actual move, the transportation?",
        "Q: Right, yes.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Not really, don\u2019t have recollection of that.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I just know I found myself in \u2014",
        "Q: In Ioannina.",
        "A: In Ioannina, right.",
        "Q: With the family.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Have you, with your brother or with your mother and father after the war, do you re \u2014\ndo you remember saying this about that scene and saying \u2014 do you remember that, or not?",
        "A: Do I remember saying, or describing this to them?",
        "Q: Yes, to \u2014 to them, an-and \u2014",
        "A: I\u2014I probably did, because it is a very fond memory. It was \u2014 it was probably the last\ntime that I remember seeing my grandmother.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was she \u2014 was she deported?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Oh, she was?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: From Ioannina.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The other vivid \u2014 vivid scene that I have is rushing to the shelter from my aunt\u2019s\nhouse. There was a f\u2014 an old fortress in Ioannina, which perhaps, I don\u2019t know exactly\nwhen it was built, perhaps Middle Ages, but then it was reinforced during the Turkish\noccupation, and it was a very thick wall, and it was used for shelter, and it was a very\nshort distance from my aunt\u2019s house to the shelter. So I remember being in this dark\nplace, and I remember that it was something dangerous that was going on, but we were\nsafe in this dark place. Th-Th-This was the time when Italian airplanes would fly over\nthat Epirus. This 1s the province in Greece where Ioannina 1s the capital.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And there was a fear of bombing of the city and so we would go into the shelter. So I\nremember that scene of this dark place, and a lot of people crowded down there for\nsafety. Tha-That\u2019s a first \u2014 I can say very clearly, this was a first re-recollection, first\nhand recollection.",
        "Q: And do you remember being held by your mother, or your father? I mean, do you have\na rec \u2014",
        "A: Yes. I\u2014I-\u2014 not \u2014 not my father, because my father was already drafted, but my\nmother, for \u2014 for me, my mother was my \u2014 my security blanket. I thought that as long as\nSeptember 14, 2010\nshe was with me, nothing bad was \u2014 would happen. A-And I always, I \u2014 throughout the\nwar period, I had that feeling, that as long as she is with me \u2014",
        "Q: That it\u2019s okay.",
        "A: \u2014 I\u2019m gonna be safe.",
        "Q: Now, did you a\u2014 do you remember feeling frightened, or being told that th \u2014 it was\ndangerous? I mean, do you remember what she told you?",
        "A: During this particular period, or later on?",
        "Q: No, this \u2014 in this \u2014 in this period.",
        "A: This is \u2014 yes \u2014",
        "Q: Cause this is when the Italians take over.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So the Germans are not there yet.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Not really. I just remember that it was day \u2014 1t was dangerous to be outside this \u2014 this\nfortress. Once you were there, you were safe, and \u2014 and it was \u2014 I didn\u2019t have a sense of\nfear, real fear, it was \u2014 I don\u2019t remember what the \u2014 my feelings. I knew that as long as\nmother was near me, I was okay.",
        "Q: You were okay.",
        "A: Yes.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It was \u2014 it was [indecipherable] there, when my brother, of course was probably 11\nyears at the time, he was \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember your brother at the time?",
        "A: Was another early recollection that I have. This is \u2014 this is in 1941 - 42, when there\nwere tremendous food shortages in \u2014 in Greece, and I remember, you know, my \u2014 my\nparents had to go to the nearby villages surrounding Agrinion, such as Moustafree(ph)\nwas one of the \u2014 one of the villages, and Verkini(ph) was another one, where they would\ngo to buy food supplies. So my mother would absent herself for long periods of time, and\nmy brother, who was 11 - 12 years old, was very concerned that when \u2014 that when I woke\nup in the morning and I opened my eyes and I realized Mother wasn\u2019t there, I would start\nto cry. So I remember him with his spoonful of fruit preserves, is like st \u2014 not strawberry,\npreserves like some other kinds of fruit, waiting for me to open my eyes and put this\nteaspoon full of \u2014 of jam, so that I wouldn\u2019t cry. I remember that very vividly. And we\nhave a thing, I remember where my brother was making dolls for me, massive\nproduction. They were very simple little dolls with sticks and you know, painted faces,\nbut he would do that to amuse me, and I remember that, too.",
        "Q: That\u2019s very sweet.",
        "A: Yeah, he was very sweet, very attentive, and very loving.",
        "Q: Well, you \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m suspecting that you were told how long you stayed in Ioannina.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Yes, we \u2014 we stayed in Ioannina from the time my father was drafted, which was \u2014 he\n\u2014he was supposed to report to his company April 1\u2018, 1940 \u2014 1941, until the Italians\nsurrendered, which was the end of April, and we \u2014 my father was actually among the last\nsoldiers to return from the front. He never saw battle, because as soon as he reached the\nfront, negotiations started, Germany came to the aid of Italy, and negotiations started for\na peace treaty. So he never saw battle, but he was \u2014 he was untrained. He was \u2014 he \u2014 this\nwas the second time he was drafted. The first time was when he was 21 years old. Now,\nhe was 35 - 37 years old, he was overweight. He was not trained the first time, he had an\noffice job. And certainly not trained the second time. So he didn\u2019t really know how to use\na rifle \u2014 basic, he never had basic training. And so he was forever not \u2014 he was not able to\nkeep up with the others \u2014 Greek soldiers. He was separated from his company several\ntimes. He had to deal with a mule that was not very cooperative. So, going to the front\nand returning, he was \u2014 was a struggle for him. So he was among the last soldiers to\nreturn, and so my \u2014 I \u2014I heard my mother and brother saying how they would go out to\nthe main street every morning, every day, waiting for my father to show up. It was a very\nanxious time for them. So, after he returned, we \u2014 we, the whole family returned to\nAgrinion. This is \u2014 this is the time when German and Italian troops began pouring into\nthe \u2014 the country. A-And Germans actually first came to \u2014 to Ioannina, but then later on,\nas we will discuss, later on the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the occupation zones were determined and\nthe Germans occupied the northern part of Greece, and the Bulgarians another section.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "Q: Yes, the ri \u2014",
        "A: Small section \u2014",
        "Q: Small section of the north, yes.",
        "A: \u2014 in the north, while the rest of the country was 1\u2014 occupied by the Italians, with the\nexception of half \u2014 half of Crete and some major islands in the Aegean. So \u2014 so we \u2014 we\nreturned to \u2014 to Agrinion after my father was discharged.",
        "Q: But you were born not in Agrinion, right? You were bo \u2014",
        "A: I was \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 you were born in Arta.",
        "A: Arta. Arta is a small city near Ioannina, because my father was transferred to \u2014 he\nhad several transfers. First he was transferred to Arta and then \u2014 then to Preveza, and\nfrom Preveza to Agrinion. So when we came to Agrinion, I was two years old, but I\u2014 I\nwas born in Arta. And I often think of how chance events determined, at that time at\nleast, your \u2014 whether you were going to live or die, because had my father not been\ntransferred to Agrinion, if he had stayed in Ioannina, or Arta, or Preveza, the chances\nof our survival would have been very ni \u2014 much diminished.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So this \u2014 this chance events determine \u2014",
        "Q: What happened.",
        "A: \u2014 what happened.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "Q: Now, he was working in bank, is that correct?",
        "A: Yes, he was working for the National Bank of Greece, yes. He started his career in \u2014\nin \u2014 in Ioannina. His father was in the milk and wine business.",
        "Q: Milk and wine?",
        "A: Yes, yes, dairy products. He made yogurt and cheese, and wine. And several of his\nsons worked in the business. And my father actually, when he became \u2014 finished high\nschool, he thought of going into the same business, but on a more sophisticated level, so\nhe decided to go to Athens and study in the school of agriculture in Athens, of the\nproduction of dairy products. But unfortunately the \u2014 the war caused the \u2014 the university\nto close, and he abandoned those studies, and he passed the entrance exam for the\nNational Bank of Greece, which was a \u2014 a rather prestigious job fo-for Greece. So he \u2014\nthis is \u2014 he started his career as a bank employee in \u2014 in Ioannina.",
        "Q: When did your parents marry? Do you know?",
        "A: Ah, they married \u2014 I should know that, right? See \u2014 my \u2014 19 \u2014 1927, I believe. Yeah, I\nbelieve it was, yes. My mother was 21 years old, my father 26, so \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 it was \u201927, \u201928, perhaps.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Maybe \u201929, I\u2019m not sure.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "Q: But eight or nine years before you were born. Something like that. And then your\nbrother obviously was born first.",
        "A: Yes, yes, right, right.",
        "Q: And your mother didn\u2019t work, she was 1-1-1n the house.",
        "A: No, my \u2014",
        "Q: I shouldn\u2019t say she didn\u2019t work, I mean she managed [indecipherable]",
        "A: Sh\u2014 my mother, no, she did not have a job, she \u2014 she was a housewife, like most\nGreek women of that middle class were. But she was a very \u2014 very dynamic person, and\nshe took great pride in the fact that, growing up in Albania \u2014 because my mother was\nborn in Albania \u2014 her parents moved to Albania from Ioannina, because there were\nbetter economic opportunities there. And she took great pride in the fact that she was \u2014\nshe worked in my father\u2019s fabric store, and she loved dealing with \u2014 with \u2014 with the\ncustomers, and they liked her. The customers liked her. And my grandfather would\nalways say, oh Esther \u2014 that\u2019s my mother\u2019s name \u2014 Esther is my right hand. So she was\na business minded woman, but she never, during that period, didn\u2019t have the opportunity\nto \u2014 or it was \u2014 1t was unusual for women to \u2014 to go into business at that time. As my \u2014\nmy father was born in Ioannina, and he attended the \u2014 a school that\u2019s called Alliance\nIsra\u00e9lite Universelle. These were schools that were established by the Rothschild\nfamily, th-the \u2014 the branch of France, to raise the educational level of the Jews of that\narea. So there were several of these schools established, and they were really excellent\nSeptember 14, 2010\nschools, where the children were taught Hebrew, French and Greek. And when you \u2014\nwhen you were graduated from this school, I think it ended up to the \u2014 went up to the\nsixth or seventh grade, you really had mastered French, because all the subjects were\ntaught in French, including history. Then, of course, Hebrew; the biblical Hebrew, and\nsome modern, conversational Hebrew, and of course, Greek. And then my father went to\nthe Greek high school, and he was fluent in \u2014 in Greek, of course. And [indecipherable]\nmy mother, she grew up in Albania where the, I think at the time, the illiteracy level was\nvery, very high. But her \u2014 her brother was well educated. He had gone to a private school\nsince he studied in Italy as well. And education was very important, so they send them to\na private school in Albania, in Delvina. But unfortunately there were some anti-Semitic\ncomments made that made my mother and her sister Eftyhia very uncomfortable. And so\ntheir parents send them to Corfu. In Corfu there was a school run by French nuns, and it\nwas an excellent \u2014 it was a boarding school, only the rich girls could go there, it was a\ngirls\u2019 school. And there she studied French. She was a very smart woman, and she\nentered the school know \u2014 not knowing a word of French, and within two years she b \u2014\nshe became fluent. So that was her education, took place in \u2014 in Corfu. So \u2014",
        "Q: When you were a small child, when you moved to Agrinion, you\u2019re three years old\nthen?",
        "A: At Agrinion was, when we first moved I was two years old, yes.",
        "Q: Two.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Two.",
        "Q: So that was 1940.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Does your \u2014 does your mother and father school you at all? I mean, clearly schools are\ngoing to be cl \u2014 I assume schools are closed, or you\u2019re too young to go to school at that\npoint.",
        "A: In Agrinion?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, I was too young to go to school. No, I\u2014 my \u2014 my f\u2014 my brother was in high\nschool at the time, but I was \u2014",
        "Q: So he \u2014 he was going to school?",
        "A: Yes, he was going to school.",
        "Q: So when the Italians occupied, the schools kept going; they didn\u2019t close down the\nschools?",
        "A: They had to close my brother\u2019s high school, because it was used as a hospital, along\nwith a tobacco warehouse [indecipherable] tobacco warehouse. Agrinion is a \u2014 a great\nproducer of tobacco, so there were a lot of tobacco warehouses in the city. So my\nbrother\u2019s high school closed because it was converted into a hospital and there were \u2014\nand Agrinion is in the main artery connecting Athens with Ioannina and the front, the\nGreek-Albanian front, so there were \u2014 so the soldiers, the wounded soldiers from the\nSeptember 14, 2010\nconflict with the \u2014 the Italians were brought \u2014 were passed through Agrinion, and so they\n\u2014 they had to close the high school because it was converted into a hospital.",
        "Q: Your father was working in the bank \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 in Agrinion.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And he didn\u2019t work that way through the entire war, I gather, because at a certain\npoint, when the Germans take over \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 from the Italians \u2014",
        "A: Right. This is the \u2014 the time my \u2014 my father worked at the bank until September \u2014 oh\nno, I\u2019m sorry, October \u2014 October, 1943. This is the time when we had to leave the city.",
        "Q: Do you remember that, that you had to leave?",
        "A: Yes, yes, I \u2014 by then I was already five years old, and I do remember quite vividly our\ndeparture from \u2014",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: Well, what happened, this is the time when Italy withdrew from the \u2014 surrendered,\nwithdrew from the war, and the \u2014 the Germans moved into the areas that were controlled\nby the Italians, so \u2014 so I remember \u2014 I remember seeing German soldiers in the streets. I\nremember the way they looked, the way they\u2019re dressed in their starched uniforms and\nSeptember 14, 2010\nthe \u2014 the \u2014 their cap was pushed down, and I remember that very vividly. Remember sole\n\u2014 German soldiers in the streets. So, this is the time when Yonas Mionis, who was a\nresident of Agrinion, and was a \u2014 he was a teacher, and he was a member of the Greek\nresistance, a leading member of the Greek res-resistance, he came to and met my father\nand told him that \u2014 that the Jews of Athens had gone into hiding, and that the Jewish\nfamilies of Agrinion have de-decided to leave the city. And so this \u2014 this is when I \u2014 I\nremember \u2014 I remember when my father, we \u2014 I remember this scene also, this is a\nfirsthand experience, I remember \u2014",
        "Q: Can you hold onto that?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Cause we have to change the tapes \u2014",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: \u2014 we can start with that.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Okay.\nEnd of Tape One\nSeptember 14, 2010\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: We\u2019ve come to a scene that you remember quite vividly, as a\u2014 as a memory of your \u2014\nof your own, with your f \u2014 your father in Agrinion, and when a Mr. Mionis \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 comes \u2014 ha-has already spoken to your fa \u2014",
        "A: Has already spoken to my father, yes, and it\u2019s actually Friday night, and my f\u2014 we \u2014\nwe were \u2014 my mother \u2014 remember, my mother, my brother and IJ are sitting on the\nbalcony, waiting for my father to come home from work. And w-we saw him and we \u2014\nand I remember my mother commenting that he looked very downcast, you know, his\nhead was sort of down and his shoulders bent over, and she said, something 1s wrong,\nsomething\u2019s wrong. And so my father comes in, and he takes us all inside, and he said, I\njust spoke with Yonas Mionis and he told us that the Jews of Athens have gone into\nhiding and that all the Jewish families in Agrinion, they\u2019re considering \u2014 no-not\neverybody had decided yet, but they\u2019re considering leaving the city. A-And so I\nremember that.",
        "Q: And you remember that conversation.",
        "A: That \u2014 that \u2014",
        "Q: Sort of.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: \u2014 the v \u2014 not in such great detail, but that \u2014 that \u2014 that th-the Jews of Athens have\ngone into hiding, I remember that. Now, the rest of it is very hard to tell, whether it\u2019s\nfirsthand experience or not.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Well, of course, you know, later on, as adults, we found out why the Jews of Athens\nhad gone into hiding. The reason was, you know, when the Germans occupied Athens,\nthey asked the chief rabbi of Athens, Barzilai, to supply them with names and addresses\nof all the families \u2014 of the Jewish families of Athens, and they gave him three days to do\nthat. And it\u2019s not very clear exactly what happened, but the Greek resistance that had\ngone \u2014 grown pretty strong by then in \u2014 in the cities, and they decided to \u2014 to help the\nrabbi leave the city, sort of almost abduction, and Baruch Shidis(ph), we learned later on\nwas a Jewish journalist, he was instrumental in arranging for this, the removal of the\nrabbi from the city, so to prevent him from providing the lists, and also give a message to\nthe Jews of Athens that they\u2019re in danger. Because as soon as he \u2014 the word got around\nthat he was \u2014 he ha \u2014 had left the city with his wife and daughter, they took him to the\nmainland, to the mountains in central Greece. Then the Jews of Athens either left the\ncity, went into the mountains, or hid in the \u2014 within the city. So the word got around that\nthe Jews of Athens had gone into hiding, and that was the message that Yonas brought\nfrom a merchant that had just returned from Athens; he had the information.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "Q: Do you remember feeling the fear in your parents? Do \u2014 do \u2014 would you remember\nthat part of it, or \u2014",
        "A: My mother was a very emotional person, very excitable, unlike my father, who was a\nvery calm person, and he \u2014 h-he \u2014 so my mother was \u2014 were very emotional an-and I\ncould sense that it was something wrong, something bad was about to happen. But \u2014 but\nmy father always tried to as \u2014 reassure us that everything was \u2014 he\u2019s a ver \u2014 perpetual\noptimist. Everything is going to work out fine. And they \u2014 they had a very nice \u2014 very\ndifferent personalities, but they complimented each other, and in our situation during the\nwar, it turned out that their traits and personality were very, very useful to have.",
        "Q: As a ch \u2014 for a child, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So, was the decision then made to move to the small village outside of Agrinion?",
        "A: The \u2014 the decision was made that we have to move, we have to leave the city. Where\nwe were going to go, there was a question mark. My parents immediately started\ndistributing our possessions to neighbors. And we had amassed a lot of food from the\nvillages during this period. People in \u2014 in Athens were starving to death, but we had\nplenty of food, because we had brought a lot of food from these surrounding villages, and\nthey were stored in the house. So, we get some of the food to neighbors, and \u2014 and also\nthe bank, the National Bank of Greece, they had a special room where they had stored\nfood for the employees. And they stored our \u2014 some of our food supplies also there. We \u2014\nSeptember 14, 2010\nwe moved our furniture into one room. We \u2014 we occupied the upper floor of a two story\nhouse, and we moved the furniture in one room, and we distributed our other clothing and\nother household items to neighbors. But we really didn\u2019t know where we were going to\ngo. That had not been decided yet. All we knew was that we have to leave the city.",
        "Q: Right. Now, do you remember all of this movement in the \u2014 in the house?",
        "A: Not firsthand.",
        "Q: Yeah, right.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember that. But I should say something that I remember very vividly,\nthat really goes back in my story, maybe.",
        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s funny, yes.",
        "A: This is before the \u2014 the Italian surrender. There was a \u2014 an Italian officer, or soldier, I\ndon\u2019t know his rank, who lived downstairs, the lower part of our house, and he liked me.\nAnd | have a picture of him with me, and he, one day sort of disappeared. We didn\u2019t\nknow where he went, and when he came back, he brought me a beautiful doll. It was the\nmost beautiful doll I ever owned in my life. I don\u2019t know where it is now, if it \u2014 IT \u2014I-1t\nwas misplaced, I lost it. But it was the most beautiful doll. And it was sort of a \u2014 I never\nquestioned at that time, you know, why he brought me the doll, because I didn\u2019t know\nthat he was the enemy, he was the occupying force \u2014 represented the occupying force.\nBut it was a very \u2014 have a very nice, fond memory of that \u2014 of that man.",
        "Q: But he was living on the fir \u2014 in the first floor.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Y-Yes, yes.",
        "Q: But you weren\u2019t afraid of him, were you?",
        "A: No, no. The ital \u2014 we were not afraid of the Italians. The Italians were not \u2014 they did\nnot list \u2014 create any fear in us. Although, in 1942, the Italian authorities requested that all\nthe Jewish families register with them. But we never thought that anything bad was going\nto happen. And so \u2014 and so my father later on, he tried to explain to me why this Italian\nofficer, soldier, brought me a doll, and he said maybe you remind him of his daughter,\nmaybe he wants to show that underneath his uniform, he is really a human being. And\nyou know, my parents, they both spoke Italian. At some point in their lives, they learned\nItalian in their youth. Albania was occupied by Italy for a period of time, and then \u2014 my\nfather was always interested in languages, the si\u2014 he managed to learn Italian and \u2014 and\nthey knew Italian songs, which they used to sing. And I always grew up with a love for\nItalians, Italian culture. I \u2014 I-I never felt afraid of Italians. And \u2014 and the house that we\nmoved in after the war had a beautiful garden, and it was a garden that was made by the\nItalian soldiers. Wherever they had \u2014 they went, they tried to \u2014 to create something\nbeautiful.",
        "Q: So for you, as a child, was \u2014 there\u2019s a real difference when the Germans \u2014 when you\nsee a German soldier.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: And you \u2014 you must have felt something different \u2014\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 when \u2014 when they occupied.",
        "A: Yes, the \u2014 the German soldiers are \u2014 are \u2014 cause I ha \u2014 I saw them in the streets. They\nwere \u2014 they were real \u2014 they elicited a sense of fear and just \u2014 and we were advised by\nour mother to avoid looking at them, or interacting with them, and \u2014 but there was a\ndifference, yes.",
        "Q: So, but \u2014 but you were also told \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 to be different with them.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So it must have all \u2014 so \u2014 elicited this is \u2014 must be menacing 1n some \u2014 and you\nweren\u2019t told that about the Italians.",
        "A: Right. Yes, we were not \u2014",
        "Q: So it\u2019s hard to know what the \u2014 what you\u2019re sensing, and what you\u2019 re being told to\nsense.",
        "A: Yes, right, that\u2019s true.",
        "Q: Yes, it\u2019s hard.",
        "A: Yes. So we \u2014 we didn\u2019t know where to go \u2014 coming back to the story. And at that time\nthere were two resistance movement in Greece. One was based in the countryside in\nEpirus, near Ioannina, the outskirts of Ioannina. EDES was headed by Napoleon\nSeptember 14, 2010\nZervas, and they were known as the \u2014 but, at that time, the country was polarized\nbetween the \u2014 the nationalists, the right wing people, and the leftists. And so the\nresistance movements were also polarized. You have EDES, headed by Napoleon\nZervas in Epirus, and then EAM-ELAS, much larger, very well organized resistance\nmovement in the countryside of Greece, but also within the cities of \u2014 of Greece. And so\nwe had neighbors, friends, who advised us to go to EDES, and other friends who advised\nus to go to a territory controlled by EAM-ELAS. So we had some very close family\nfriends, the Bokoros family; there were three brothers and two sisters, actually three\nsisters. There was Christos and Thermas(ph) Bokoros, and we knew them, we became\nfam \u2014 we became family friends because their sister Elestair(ph) was married to a man\nwho was a colleague of my father\u2019s in \u2014 in the bank. I think we met \u2014 they met them\neither in Preveza or Arta, I don\u2019t know. And unfortunately her husband, Elestair\u2019s\nhusband died, and the whole family moved to Agrinion and they lived \u2014 and so she and\nher children lived with her brothers, Christos and Thermas(ph) and Kostas Bokoros.\nSo, we decided to ask them for help, and they were wonderful people, they did everything\nthey could to assure us that we\u2019ll find you a place, we\u2019ll get you out of the city. And so\nafter we distributed our belongings to the neighbors, my mother, my brother and I, we \u2014\nwe sent some of the material, clothing and food and household utensils, with a porter to\ntransport these things to the Bokoros\u2019 house, and then we, the three of us, my mother, my\nbrother and I followed behind. My father went to work that day, he had to \u2014 they received\nSeptember 14, 2010\na very large amount of money, and he was replacing the \u2014 the cashier, so he had to go\nthere and to count the money. And so we reached the Bokoro \u2014 Bokoros\u2019 house, and a\nfew minutes later \u2014 I remember this very vividly, I know this is a firsthand recollection. I\nremember a German bursting into the house and \u2014 and then my mother, you know, she\nsaw this \u2014 she saw him, and she quickly pushed him in \u2014 pushed me into the adjacent\nroom and she quickly pulled the covers off the bed, and pretended to calmly make the\nbed, as though she belonged there. She\u2019s a very quick thinker, sh \u2014 amazing person. So\nth-the \u2014 the German sort of looked around. I don\u2019t \u2014 we don\u2019t know what \u2014 who he was\nlooking for, and then he left. But 1t was a very frightening experience for \u2014 for \u2014 for all \u2014\nfor my mother and \u2014 and my brother. I don\u2019t remember where my brother was at this\npoint. All I remember was my mother making the bed at this point. And she asked\nChristos, one of the Bokoros brothers to quickly go to the bank and tell my father to \u2014 to\ndrop everything and come to the house, we had to leave immediately. So Christos goes\nto the bank, and told my father that \u2014 does he have \u2014 even though you haven\u2019t finished\ncounting the money, you have to drop everything and leave. An-And certainly the people\nin the bank were very cooperative. They signed everything as though they had cou \u2014 as\nthe mon \u2014 as though the money had been counted and everything, or the transaction was\nvery orderly. And so my father comes to the Bokoros house. And then, where there\u2019s\nanother problem they confront is the lack of transportation. The Germans had\nrequisitioned all means of transportation; trucks, taxis, mules, horses. And so the brothers\nSeptember 14, 2010\ncouldn\u2019t find a way for us to leave that day, which was October second. And so we spent\nthe night in their house, and the following day they came with a taxi. They found a taxi\nthat was going to Kremasta. This was a spa near the river Acheloos river, nearby. Was\nso-some distance, few kilometers outside Agrinion. And he had \u2014 the taxi driver had\nother passengers to transport to the \u2014 the the Acheloos spa. And so this is we \u2014 we got in\nthe tax1 with some blankets, and you know, some household ma \u2014 equipment, materials\nthat we brought with us, and so we left the city. I remember that, I remember how my\nmother said we should crouch into the \u2014 the taxi, not to draw attention to ourselves,\nbecause people did not use taxis then to \u2014 to \u2014 to move around, we didn\u2019t want to \u2014 to\ndraw attention to ourselves. And then as soon as we \u2014 we came to the outskirts of the city\nof Agrinion, we had to pass through a German checkpoint. And the driver, who\napparently did this route quite often, he knew how to deal with the German guards there,\nand he gave them some raisins and cigarettes, and they let us pass. And then \u2014",
        "Q: Without checking you.",
        "A: Without checking, yes. It was \u2014 was actually, you know, we \u2014 we learned much later\nthat at that point, it was easy to go in and out of the cities, th-they were not checking. But\nthen \u2014 a-and then a few kilometers later, we encountered another checkpoint that was not\nGerman, those were the resistance fighters. These were the EAM-ELAS members. And\nthen, you know, we reassured that we were in safe ground.",
        "Q: Was your brother a member of ELAS?\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: No, my brother \u2014",
        "Q: Because it was \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 was very young then, he was 13. He wished he were. That was the dream of his life,\nhe \u2014 to this \u2014 to this day, he wished he had had \u2014 had had the opportunity to b \u2014 to be a\nmember of ELAS. There was a \u2014 a youth division of the resistance called EPON, e-p-o-\nn.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And they were \u2014 these were mostly young men and women. They were 15 - 16 years\nold. They were \u2014 they were doing very valuable services, carrying out very valuable\nservices for the resistance. They were used as runners, to \u2014 to carry messages for\ncommunication purposes. They would paint slogans in the cities at night, to lift up the\nspirits of the citizens. And then in the villages, where people didn\u2019t have radios, they\nwould call out or read the news of the day, using a megaphone, like it was taken probably\nfrom gramophones, and \u2014 like a bullhorn, carry \u2014 you know, shouting the news, or if \u2014 if\nthere was th \u2014 if the s \u2014 the village had to be evacuated, they would \u2014 they would carry\nout this service, very valuable. But no, my \u2014 my brother never had the opportunity.",
        "Q: When you were in this taxi, did \u2014 did you feel the tension? Do you remember feeling a\nlot of tension, or not?",
        "A: No, for me it was wonderful, because riding in a taxi was a unique experience. People\ndid not ride buses and taxis in \u2014 in \u2014\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 in the city where I grew up. And being in moving vehicle, no matter what it was,\nwhether it was a Jeep or a bus or a taxi, didn\u2019t matter, it was a thrilling experience. And\nso I remember it was \u2014 1t was a wonderful feeling that I had being in the taxi. And then\nthe anticipation of going up to the mountains, these are mountains that I could see from\nthe city, the \u2014 you could see them from the city, and I always wanted to go there.",
        "Q: So for you was an adventure \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 in a way.",
        "A: Yes, yes, an adventure.",
        "Q: And for your parents, it\u2019s not quite an adventure, right?",
        "A: No, it\u2019s a difference \u2014",
        "Q: Or if it\u2019s an adv \u2014 a different kind of adventure, yes.",
        "A: Right, right, right. It was a \u2014 actually a very beautiful ride, up to a certain point, the \u2014\nthe road was paved, and so we were able to go as far as the village of Houni, and \u2014 and\nthere, this is as far as the taxi could go. And this is another thing that I remember, and it\u2019s\na firsthand recollection, this very beautiful fountain that consisted of heads made out of\nkind of \u2014 some kind of ceramic material, and the water was spouting out of these heads. I\ndon\u2019t know, maybe there were seven or eight heads in a row. And e \u2014 thou \u2014 that \u2014 this\nwas a fountain that was also built by Italians. But this is as far as the taxi went, then he\nSeptember 14, 2010\nhad \u2014 he \u2014 he transported his passengers to the \u2014 the spa. And at that point, the driver, the\ntaxi driver found a \u2014 a mule driver to transport us to a village. Now, I don\u2019t know who\nmade the decision that Psilovrahos was the village where we should be taken. I don\u2019t\nknow whether it was the taxi driver recommended it, or \u2014 or the mule driver thought that\nthis would be \u2014 but he \u2014 but the \u2014 the information that was conveyed to the mule driver\nwas that it had to be a place that was off the beaten track, a remote village, and so the\nmule driver brought two mules and a donkey to transport us to the \u2014 the village.",
        "Q: So you don\u2019t think that your parents, before you left Agrinion were quite sure where\nthey were gonna go?",
        "A: I-I-",
        "Q: They knew the direction, but not necessarily where.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t even know whether the Bokoros brothers had told the taxi\ndriver th-th-this is the final destination. I \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019m not clear on that.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So you get out of the taxi with the few things that you\u2019re carrying.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And you get on a donkey, or a mu \u2014 or a mule?",
        "A: Not exactly.",
        "Q: No? Do you walk? What happens?\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: My \u2014 the mule driver and my father, they load all our belongings onto these mules.\nAnd we carry these rugs, they\u2019re used as blankets, they\u2019re called flokati. Flokati. It\u2019s\ntufted blanket. Very heavy. Very heavy. I think the United States, they use it as a rug, a\nvery elegant rug by the fireplace, but it \u2014 it has these tufts, very long ones. And it\u2019s made\nof wool, very heavy, and so they load all our belongings on these two mules, and they\ncover the mule with this tufted blankets, and they create sort of like a nest for me. And\nthey lifted me up and they place me on the mule in this \u2014 in this little nest that they\ncreated. And then my mother was riding the other mule, and my brother rode the donkey\nfor a little while, and my father on foot. So that was the scene. And there we are,\nfollowing this path that is \u2014 it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a path that only animals and people can walk on.\nIt\u2019s very rocky, I remember. And I remember a very \u2014 the rhythmic sound of a creek that\nwas flowing along this path. That I remember. This is probably why I love mountains,\nbecause of \u2014 of my experience in the mountains during this period of my life. I don\u2019t like\nthe sea very much, but I love the mountains, yes.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t we stop there \u2014",

        "A: No, no, I was wide awake and I \u2014 I just \u2014 I have this very vivid image of this trip up to\nPsilovrahos. It\u2019s very vivid in my mind; the sounds, the smells.",
        "Q: So what sort of sounds did you hear?\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Oh, well, first of all, the creek that was flowing along the path. The sounds \u2014 th-the\nsounds that I remember the most are when we were approaching the village, there were\nsounds of sheep braying, goats, the \u2014 the bells of \u2014 of the goats. They \u2014 goats always had\nbells so the villagers can locate them, you know, if they strayed away. And roosters\ncrowing. Those are the sou \u2014 th-the \u2014 the \u2014 the sounds of the village.",
        "Q: Did the mule also make sounds? The mule, and the donkeys, did they bray?",
        "A: Yeah, de-definitely the donkeys. The donkeys do, definitely very loud, very\ncharacteristic loud sound they make. And I remember my mother turning around and\ntelling my father, when we were approaching the village, we didn\u2019t get tired Leon, did\nwe? She was sitting on the mule and my poor father was perspiring and \u2014 and really\nhaving a hard time climbing the \u2014 this \u2014 this is a very steep mountain we were climbing,\nvery steep.",
        "Q: Right. So you\u2019re about five years old at this time?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re quite conscious of what\u2019s going \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 what\u2019s going on.",
        "A: Yes, Iam.",
        "Q: Now, did you ex \u2014 when the villagers ca \u2014 di-did they come out to greet you? I mean,\nwhat \u2014 what happened when you came into this village?\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Well, when we came into the village, there were villagers that came out, because this\nis a very small, small village in a very remote location. Not many things happen in the\ncourse of a day, and th-they \u2014 they were curious to see who are these people who just\narrived. We looked, obviously, city people, the way we were dressed, and so they were\nvery curious to \u2014 to see what was going on.",
        "Q: Did your parents say that you were Jewish, and that you were \u2014 you were escaping\nfrom the Germans, or were \u2014 didn\u2019t you \u2014 don\u2019t you \u2014 do you remember, do you know?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether my parents told the villagers that we were Jewish, but it was\nknown, it was known that we were Jewish. But we were trying not to act \u2014 you know,\nbehave differently than \u2014 than the j \u2014 than the villagers. We were trying not to draw\nattention to ourselves, to the point that we even went to church, to give them the\nimpression that, you know, we are like you, except that we don\u2019t make the sign of the\ncross. But my parents knew that \u2014 that as long as EAM-ELAS 1s in control of that region,\nwe were safe from spies. Because even if a villager had \u2014 got in his mind the notion of\nbetraying us, he would be afraid of retaliations by the \u2014 punishment by the resistance.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So we tried to sort of keep a \u2014 a low profile and not look different or act different.",
        "Q: Did you play with the kids?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: You did?\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Yes, I-",
        "Q: So this was good for you, this was nice.",
        "A: Yes, it was \u2014 it was a wa \u2014 the village kids were \u2014 village kids all \u2014 all around us\nbecause \u2014 and \u2014 and it \u2014 became friends with them because my father enrolled me, after\nwe settled down, enrolled me in the \u2014 the one room schoolhouse of the school. And I\nthink it had maybe four classes, four second, third, fourth grades, but it was mostly the\nyounger children that came to school. The older ones were taken away by their parents to\nhelp out with \u2014 with the \u2014 the farms, or to learn a trade. So the \u2014 the educational level of\nthe villagers was very, very low. Was an extremely poor village, with few exceptions.\nThere were a few rich families.",
        "Q: Do you remember going to school?",
        "A: Yes, I remember that very well.",
        "Q: Oh, what was that like?",
        "A: Well, I remember \u2014 first of all, the school was a \u2014 was just a plain building that had a\nfew desks, where the \u2014 the desk and the seat were attached. I think they were desks like\nthe ones that were used 1n colonial times in the United States. We had \u2014",
        "Q: Listen, I went to school and they had desks like that.",
        "A: And they had them. Okay, so I should \u2014",
        "Q: This was a long time ago [indecipherable] to school \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes, right, it was attached, yes.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And you would sit like three children, one next to the \u2014 the other. And the \u2014 the\nteacher was Mr. Alexandras(ph) Hemandritis(ph). And I remember him very well, he\nwas a very nice person. When my father brought me to the school the first day, they \u2014\nyou know, they didn\u2019t have books, they didn\u2019t have paper, it was \u2014 we \u2014 we had slates.\nYou prob \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you used slates also?",
        "Q: No, I didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Slates.",
        "Q: Slates.",
        "A: You know what slates are?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And he didn\u2019t have enough books for all the children, so he told my father that he\nwouldn\u2019t have a book for me, but \u2014 but my brother could \u2014 could make one, he would just\ncopy one of the books that was used \u2014 that were used in the class. There was a fireplace\nfor heat, and in fact, every day we had to bring a piece of wood, all the children had the\npiece \u2014 piece of wood for the \u2014 the fireplace. And I was rather uncomfortable at the\nbeginning, because of two reasons. One was I looked different than the village children. I\n\u2014 you know, my mother fussed over me a lot, I had very pretty clothes, and a huge bow\non my hair; that was the style, and curls like \u2014 my mother would say like Shirley\nTemple. And so I \u2014 I drew their attention from my appearance alone. The worst thing for\nSeptember 14, 2010\nme was that the day would start with the Lord\u2019s Prayer, Pater Hemon. And this is a\nChristian prayer, which after I analyzed it as an adult, you know, is very acceptable\nprayer, could say universal prayer. However, it had to be \u2014 was followed by the sign of\nthe cross, and I did not make the sign of the cross. I\u2014 I did not know much about Jewish\nreligion at that point. I knew that I was Jewish, I knew we celebrated Passover, and I\nknew that on Yom Kippur, we fasted. But other than that, I didn\u2019t know anything.\nHowever, I knew a lot about the Christian religion, because I was growing up in a\nChristian environment, and \u2014 and \u2014 and of course I knew about the \u2014 the accusation of the\nJews being responsible for the crucifixion and \u2014",
        "Q: So you knew that at that age?",
        "A: I knew that \u2014 I knew that \u2014 that \u2014 that there was something \u2014 not \u2014 not specifically. I di\n\u2014 perhaps it\u2019s \u2014 maybe I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m adding information that I acquired later on. But all I\nknew was that we did not make the sign of the cross, and so I did not. And I remember,\nyou know, the children turning around and looking at me. I was not making the sign of\nthe cross, and I didn\u2019t know what to do with my hands. I put them behind me, in my\npockets. I just had no \u2014 I felt extremely uncomfortable. And \u2014 and then of course, during\nrecess they \u2014 they asked me a lot of questions, you know, why didn\u2019t you make the sign\nof the cross? And I s \u2014 I did \u2014 just don\u2019t make it. A-And I didn\u2019t know how to answer the\nquestions. I was not prepared for this and I guess my parents never thought of I was going\nto experience this, and \u2014 and didn\u2019t prepare me.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "Q: Did you go home and say, what am I supposed to do now? I mean \u2014",
        "A: Yes, when I went home after the first day, I told my mother that I wanted to have\nbraids, because all the girls \u2014",
        "Q: Had braids.",
        "A: \u2014 had braids. I didn\u2019t want to have curls. And she protested, she said, but they\u2019re so\nbeautiful, like Shirley Temple. No braids, and no bow. I had a huge bow sitting on top of\nmy head. These children had very little, very little. Many of these children were barefoot,\nor they wore pigskin sandals, made out of a piece of a pigskin, and you know, rope to \u2014 to\ntie it to their feet. And I had shiny shoes, and pretty clothes and a bow and curls. All of\nthat had to go, I told my mother and sister, because I \u2014 children don\u2019t want to be\ndifferent.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So that was a \u2014 was that a difficult time for you in a certain way, or do \u2014",
        "A: It was uncomfortable, uncomfortable that I \u2014 I made friends easily and they accepted\nme no matter what I looked or how I acted. An-And I made friends, I \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 I never felt\nlonely, you know. There were times when I did, when I did, later on. And I used to go up\nin the \u2014 the fields, you know, my \u2014 our house was \u2014 our house was a very primitive\nlooking house. It was really \u2014 consisted of one room with a fireplace and an\n[indecipherable] window, and a table and \u2014 and chairs. There were no beds. I mean,\nSeptember 14, 2010\nwhen we arrived, my parents had to immediately buy wood sawhorses and boards to\nmake beds, two beds; one for my mother and me, and one for my father and my brother.\nAnd then of course, they had to purchase food supplies. This was the harvest time, this 1s\nOctober and there are dry figs and walnuts and corn, lentils, beans, dry beans and my\nparents immediately bought food supplies.",
        "Q: A-And from whom did they buy it? They \u2014 they buy it from the farmers, or \u2014",
        "A: Yes. Th-There were two sources of \u2014 of sa \u2014 food supplies. One was we \u2014 my parents\nhad, as I said earlier, they had stored a lot of food in the \u2014 the bank. And so they send a\nman with a horse to bring food supplies from \u2014 from ours \u2014 our supplies in storage in the\nbank. And the other food supplies were from the villagers. There were some that were\nvery affluent and they would \u2014 would sell in large quantities. And so my parents stuffed a\nlot of stacks of these food supplies and arranged them up against the wall, and it formed\nsort of a sofa. And so we had a place to sit and we had the table and chairs and beds to\nsleep on. But that was all. There was no running water, no electricity, no bathroom. But\nmy father was a very resource \u2014 resourceful person, he \u2014 he said just \u2014 just let\u2019s pretend\nwe are living 1n primitive times, before electricity was invented, and we just have to \u2014 to\nlearn from the villagers how they live, and we\u2019ll do the same.",
        "Q: And how \u2014 do you know how they found this place to live?",
        "A: The \u2014 the first place we lived in, you know, when we arrived, and there were villagers\nthat approached to see what was going on, one of them stepped forward and said, oh, I\nSeptember 14, 2010\nhave a room, and they \u2014 and they rented \u2014 we rented a room. The \u2014 one thing that my\nmother had brought, she insisted that we bring to the village was soap and sugar, because\nthe \u2014 the Greek money had lost its value because of inflation that the Germans had\nprinted a lot of money, and the ger \u2014 the Greek drachma had lost its value, so people\nconducted these transactions with goods, with bartering that was going on. So soap and\nsugar was a very desirable, important commodity, and we had brought a lot of that, yeah.",
        "Q: Interesting that she thought of that.",
        "A: Yeah, she was a very smart person, very smart.",
        "Q: So you stayed in this first place for a little while?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Like wa \u2014 like a couple of weeks or something, or less than that?",
        "A: Well, we stayed in \u2014 you see, after we \u2014 we \u2014 we purchased food, and we also \u2014 we\ngot a goat. Now, I\u2019m not sure whether we got a goat at this point, or later on, I\u2019m not\nsure. But I remember that for me, getting a goat was the dream of my life. It was a goat of\nmy own, and the \u2014 and it was really a \u2014 in order for us to have a source of milk. And th-\nthe goat spent most of the time with the Tsulamitsu(ph) family, they were very nice,\nvery hospitable, kind, generous people. And they spent the time there, they would milk\nthe goat and bring the milk for us to drink. But we also, you know, I spent a lot of time\nwith \u2014 with the goat, I \u2014 I really became very attached to her. So after we \u2014 we acquired\nall these food supplies, we felt very comfortable in the village. It felt like a vacation. I\nSeptember 14, 2010\nwas going to school, my brother had brought his high school books, and my father said,\nyou should start studying. And my father had brought a book of English method \u2014 how \u2014\na method to learn English without a teacher. I remember that book. My brother has it \u2014\nstill has it. And \u2014 and of course my mother didn\u2019t need any \u2014 any additional work. She\nreally had to work very hard because there was \u2014 she had to do the laundry and the\ncooking and all the washing of the dishes, without \u2014 without a stove, without running\nwater. It was a real hardship for her. And so we didn\u2019t felt comfortable at that point, and\nmy father started writing letters to our rel-relatives in Ioannina, urging them to leave the\ncity and \u2014 and go to the mountains. And we used friends t-to \u2014 to transport these letters\nfrom \u2014 from the village of Psilovrahos to a colleague of my father\u2019s, Evyanea(ph)\nPapadapoulou(ph) I believe was her name. And she would in turn send the letters to her\nsister or brother in Ioannina, and they would deliver them to our relatives. And\neverything was written in code, and we never used the word Psilovrahos, it was our \u2014 it\nwas a code word like, our place in the mountains, or our vacation place. And so we were\nurging them to leave, and the reply was that everything is fine here. We have plenty of\nfood, and they were actually worried about the children catching cold up in the\nmountains, because at that time, the ger \u2014 there \u2014 there was no indication of anything was\ngoing to happen to them now. Ioannina, or Ioannina at this point is occupied by the\nGermans, but there was no indication that anything bad was going to happen. So \u2014 so we\nfelt very secure in the village, and we actually began to enjoy our life there, vacation\nSeptember 14, 2010\nspot, until suddenly it was \u2014 I believe it was November, the end of November, when\nYonas Mionis, this is the same man \u2014",
        "Q: Same guy, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 same guy, he comes \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he was \u2014 he had been running, he \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he\narrived to the village, and from another \u2014 another village called 10s \u2014 Agios Vlassis, a\nnearby village, and told my parents that we have to leave and find another place, we have\nto leave the village immediately, or \u2014 or by \u2014 by tomorrow morning, and go to another\nplace, because the Germans have advanced to \u2014 ar-are-are \u2014 are in Agios Vlassis, and\nthey are advancing in the direction of Psilovrahos. By that time there were two more\nJewish men who had ended up in Psilovrahos, they had come from another city, I believe\nHelkese(ph). And of course you know we were \u2014 my parents, they panicked. They \u2014 they\nwere advised to go to a higher place up in the mountains. And we arranged with a mule\ndriver to come the following morning, to transport us to this higher place. And I\nremember th-the \u2014 oh well, during the night \u2014 during the night, was a very frightful night,\nbecause we didn\u2019t know whether the Germans were advancing during the night, but there\nwas a big explosion, a distant explosion. We didn\u2019t know where it was coming from. I\nshould say that when Yonas Mionis came to alert us of the advance of the Germans,\nthere was there \u2014 the church bells started to ring alarm, and these young men of EPON\nwas calling everybody to his feet, and urging able-bodied men to take their weapons,\nrifles, whatever they had, and go to Agios Vlassis to stop advance of the Germans. So,\nSeptember 14, 2010\nthe following morning, this mule driver arrives and \u2014 and now again, I don\u2019t know\nwhether I heard my mother say that, or I heard her say that much later, but 1t impressed\nme that these \u2014 what kind of mules are these? These are just a \u2014 they look like big \u2014 big\ndogs; they were very small. And of course, we were very grateful that there was a means\nof transportation, so we loaded a few \u2014 a few things and along with the other Jewish men,\nwe started climbing the mountain. Now, this part I know is firsthand experience. I\nremember my mother saying \u2014 I was getting tired, and my mother kept saying, keep\nwalking, keep walking, you have to \u2014 because I was behind everybody. And I don\u2019t know\nwhether she said the Germans are coming, but all she was urging me to walk faster. And\nso it \u2014 it was a \u2014 it was a rainy day, and I remember my mother insisted that we all wear\nextra clothing for warmth, and finally we reached a house, this mule driver took us to the\nhouse of a man called Chiandafelis(ph). It was a \u2014 th-there were no other houses there,\njust his house. And of course, he opens the door, sees this unlikely group of people, city\npeople at his doorstep, he didn\u2019t know what was going on. And \u2014 and it was revealed that\n\u2014 that wi \u2014 th-the \u2014 the mule driver told him who we were and why we were there. So\nthey probably \u2014 he probably told them that we are Jewish, and that the Germans were\nadvancing. I \u2014 I don\u2019t know exactly what he told him. But when the man, Mr.\nChiandafelis(ph) heard the word Agrinion, he became very excited, because he told us\nthat his daughter Theandafela(ph) was working for a family in Agrinion, the family of\nDavaroukas(ph). And it so happened that Davaroukas(ph) was a colleague of my\nSeptember 14, 2010\nfather\u2019s in the National Bank of Greece. So he became very excited, because my father\ntold him, oh I know your daughter, she came to the bank several times, and I know her,\nshe is a very nice girl. And you see, a lot of villagers would send their daughters into the\ncity to work as maids in hope that they would learn to grow \u2014 to learn \u2014 acquire some\nskills with city people. They would take them out of school and they would work as\nmaids to bring some income for the family, and also learn to be nice young ladies, the\nway city people were. So he welcomed us, you know, from strangers we became friends.\nHe welcomed us and \u2014 and offered us a place to \u2014 to sleep. The Greeks are very\nhospitable people.",
        "Q: Even \u2014 even in danger.",
        "A: Even in danger, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a tradition, and 1-in fact, in danger, they \u2014 they sense\nthat there is a common enemy, and we have to help one another. And that was from my\nmother\u2019s memoirs, when she describes her many visits into the countryside, this is the\nfeeling that I get, that the people were welcoming. The-They saw this woman and her\nson, because she would go around with my brother, and they\u2019d try to help as much as\nthey can. So we make arrangements to \u2014 to spend the night in Mr. Chiandafelis\u2019 (ph)\nhouse. And then the next morning \u2014 or rather it was, perhaps \u2014 no, I think it was the same\nday; it was raining and then when the rain stopped, we stepped outside. And it was at that\npoint that my brother saw a group of men with horses or mules, ascending the mountain.\nAnd \u2014 and he said, the Germans are coming, the Germans are coming. And that, you\nSeptember 14, 2010\nknow, created panic, and everybody just dispersed and hid behind rocks, behind trees.\nAnd then the Chiandafelis(ph) re-realized that we were terrified by the Germans. And so\nat this point they decide that it\u2019s best for us to spend the day in a cave. In Arapo(ph)\nKefalas(ph) was the name of the cave, and spend the day in \u2014 and spend the night in his\nhouse. And that\u2019s what we did.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what you did.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So let\u2019s start there on the next \u2014 on the next tape.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Okay? Okay, we can \u2014\nEnd of Tape Three\nSeptember 14, 2010\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "Q: I want to go back a little bit, right before the cave, when you\u2019ve tra \u2014 when you\u2019re\ntraveling \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 to go to the cave, do you remember what you brought with you?",
        "A: Yes, we \u2014 we brought some blankets, soap and sugar, in pillowcases, because as I said\nearlier, my mother used the soap and sugar to barter other items. And 1n this case, we\ndidn\u2019t know wh \u2014 where we were going, but this was a way of paying the people in\nwhose house we were gonna stay, soap or sugar.",
        "Q: But I wa \u2014 I was interested to know whether you as a child brought \u2014 brought a toy of\nsome kind, would you \u2014 would you bring one of the dolls that your brother had made?",
        "A: Oh yes, no, I didn\u2019t have any toys. I do not remember having any toys. I really did not\nhave toys. And I didn\u2019t miss them because none of the village children had toys.",
        "Q: Had toys.",
        "A: Yes, we \u2014 it was always improvising things. I remember one of the activities I used to\nengage in was building a clay oven, like the one my \u2014 a small one, like the one my father\nhad built, cause I had helped him build the clay oven on the side of the house.",
        "Q: This was in a \u2014 Agrinion, or \u2014",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no, no \u2014",
        "Q: No, this was \u2014\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: \u2014in Agrinion we lived in a \u2014a\u2014",
        "Q: In a regular house.",
        "A: \u2014 in a regular house with running water, and bathroom and a stove. But no, in the\nvillage. So my \u2014 I remember my father built a clay oven and \u2014 and I know exactly how to\nbuild a clay oven.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. If you want me to build one for you, I can do it.",
        "Q: You can do that?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So you helped him do this?",
        "A: Yes, all I had to do was I had to gather rocks, and there were plenty of rocks, because\nthis village is just covered with rocks. And so he made a \u2014 a mound of rocks, and then he\ndug up the soil and extracted some clay, mixed it with hay to reinforce the \u2014 the mud, and\nthen \u2014 oh we \u2014 we piled the rocks on the top of the \u2014 a large flagstone. You pile the rocks\nand then you cover the rocks with this mixture of clay and hay. And so you create a\ndome, and there\u2019s two o \u2014 there are two openings, one in front to put the food in, and out,\nand then one at the top for the smoke to escape. And so when the clay is dry, you remove\nthe rocks from inside and you create this hollow space, and you use wood to sh \u2014 heat up\nthe oven, and this is how you \u2014 you bake things, and \u2014",
        "Q: So did your mother bake in there? She \u2014 she \u2014\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Yes, yes \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 and she cooked food?",
        "A: Yes, there was the only way to cook, to bake something. We had the fireplace in \u2014 ins\n\u2014 in the room, and at first she used the \u2014 what they call a gastra. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a metal dome\npiece of like \u2014 well, the \u2014 the cover of a pot, but fairly large, and you light the fire and\nthen you, in the hot ashes and the smoldering charcoal, you can bake something, provided\nyou have this gastra on top of it, because it keeps the heat inside.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But in a\u2014 I believe gastra was something that we borrowed from \u2014 from the villagers.\nVillagers were very generous, very helpful, the \u2014 they realized that we were not equipped\nfor this kind of life, and they were willing to share their tools or \u2014 or kitchen materials of\n\u2014 to \u2014 to help us manage. But for some reason this gastra had to be returned to the\nvillager and so \u2014 so my father had to construct this oven. It was not his invention, it was\nvery common and I\u2019m sure the villagers told him how to construct one. But my father\nwas always interested in learning things and experimenting with different devices. So \u2014\nso, going up to the \u2014 so really, I did not have any toys, but this is \u2014 so I used to build\nsmall ovens fol \u2014 following that model.",
        "Q: Right, right, with other kids.",
        "A: With other kids, yes.",
        "Q: And did you do anything with these little ovens?\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Yes, we \u2014 I wanted to light a fire, but of course, you know, my mother, you know, was\nabsolutely against 1t, because it was dangerous. At some point in my life, in my\nchildhood, I did light a fire. I was fascinated by this \u2014 by these \u2014 this structure of the\noven.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And after the war, I think \u2014 I know that I \u2014 I lit a fire in there. It\u2019s quite interesting,\nyes.",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting, right. But you didn\u2019t bring any of those little doll \u2014 like one doll \u2014",
        "A: No, no \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 nothing. You \u2014 you \u2014 you were not attached to anything?",
        "A: No, not really.",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting.",
        "A: Yes. The thing that I was attached, in the village, was this goat. I\u2014 I really was \u2014\nbecame very attached to that animal.",
        "Q: So did you miss the animal when you left?",
        "A: Actually, I missed this animal when it had to be killed, because at the later point in our\nstay in \u2014 in the village, the \u2014 the goat became sick and had to be slaughtered. And so they\nkilled the goat and I wa \u2014 I was really \u2014 I don\u2019t think my parents realized how devastated\nI was. I was a rather quiet child that didn\u2019t share my feelings or talk about things. I don\u2019t\nthink I did. And so when they killed the goat, they \u2014 the villagers told us that you have to\nSeptember 14, 2010\ncut it into small pieces, and put it in a barrel with a lot of salt to preserve it for the winter.\nAnd that\u2019s what we did. And th \u2014 it turned out that the goat was pregnant, so \u2014",
        "Q: Not sick?",
        "A: Not sick, or perhaps it was both, and my father threw away the fetus, but one of the \u2014\nthe Jewish men in the village, those that had joined us at a la \u2014 later point, was told that\nthe fetus was thrown away, and he was starving, literally starving, and he went, picked up\nthe dead fetus, cooked it and \u2014 and they ate it.",
        "Q: Could you eat this goat?",
        "A: The goat? Yes \u2014",
        "Q: You could.",
        "A: \u2014 it\u2019s regular meat.",
        "Q: No, I mean, given your feelings about it \u2014",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: \u2014 I was wondering whether you could \u2014",
        "A: Oh, yes. I-I don\u2019t think I refused the meat. I was so hungry and by then it was no\nlonger a goat, 1t was just a piece of extremely salty meat, it wasn\u2019t even palatable.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something, cause you said that you were a quiet child. Do you think\nthat you became a quiet child because what was going on around you was so difficult,\nand you thought that maybe you shouldn\u2019t speak what you were feeling?\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: I know that my parents many times described situations where I was hungry or very\nthirsty, and they said, but Ninetta did not complain. So I don\u2019t know what was going on\nthrough my mind that we were \u2014 had all these hardships, and there\u2019s nothing that can be\ndone.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So I \u2014it\u2019s very hard for me to \u2014 to know \u2014 I don\u2019t think that the \u2014 the war experience\naffected me in the way that made me frightened and made me quiet, because for me, the\nexperience of \u2014 of living in this village, where I was free, I was really free to go\nanywhere I wanted as a child, surrounded by this wild beauty of the village; the animals,\ngoats and sheep and donkeys and chickens everywhere. It was \u2014 it was \u2014 it was a positive\nexperience, and I think \u2014 I have a feeling that this is where I developed my \u2014 my love for\nnature. I \u2014 I\u2014I just \u2014 cause I was so close to nature, so close to the animals, to this\nwilderness. So I don\u2019t think it had a negative impact on me.",
        "Q: Doesn\u2019t seem like it \u2014",
        "A: No, cause \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 when one meets you. Right. But you don\u2019t \u2014 you know, one doesn\u2019t know whether\nwe \u2014 when you talked about the fact that you didn\u2019t express your feelings about some\nthings, so they didn\u2019t know what you felt \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 that maybe that was a \u2014 that was partly a response to how difficult you saw that.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: It is possible that \u2014 I don\u2019t know how mature I was for my age \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 but maybe that \u2014 made that valuation, but I never felt I was hiding. I didn\u2019t go into\nhiding.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We were free.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And \u2014 and \u2014 and so, really a designation of a survivor, a survivor, it had never entered\nmy mind until I was identified as a survivor here in the United States.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Because for us in Greece, survivors were those who returned from the \u2014 survived the\nconcentration camps.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Not the ones who survived hiding 1n \u2014 1n the \u2014",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: \u2014 up in the mountains, or even within the cities.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And I compared notes with other people who had similar experience, and they felt the\nsame way. They were not survivors. We didn\u2019t have to \u2014 we didn\u2019t have to hide, really,\nduring that period.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "Q: Right, right, right.",
        "A: Although we were hiding from Germans.",
        "Q: Of course. But in a different \u2014 in a different way.",
        "A: Yes, exactly.",
        "Q: Yeah. And my suspicion is also that even in this country, the \u2014 the word survivor has\ntaken on different meanings as the decades have gone on.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, it has really expanded.",
        "Q: Expanded much more.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So you were going \u2014 you \u2014 you went from the \u2014 the small village \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 up the mountain \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 on me \u2014 on a mul \u2014 you were on a mule that \u2014",
        "A: On \u2014 on foot.",
        "Q: On foot.",
        "A: The \u2014 the mules were simply carrying \u2014",
        "Q: Carrying stuff.",
        "A: \u2014 our belongings, yes.",
        "Q: Okay. So now you know you\u2019re going to a cave? I mean, did you \u2014 did \u2014\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: N-No, we are going to this man\u2019s house.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And this is Mr. Chiandafelis(ph) \u2014",
        "Q: Right, who had the dau \u2014 the daughter who \u2014 who \u2014 so he was very comfortable with\nall of you.",
        "A: Yes, yes. But then there was this incident of my brother seeing this group of men and\nhorses or mules ascending this precipice and she panicked and said, oh the Germans are\ncoming, and created a lot of panic among all of us, because in addition to my family,\nthere were now three additional Jewish men; one of them was Yonas Mionis, the\nresistance leader. And we all dispersed behind rocks, behind trees and that 1s when \u2014 oh,\nand then Mr. Chiandafelis(ph) sent his son, Spyros down the mountain to see who these\npeople were and he discovered just villagers returning to their homes. But then they\nrecognized that we were terrified of the possibility of being discovered by the Germans,\nand so they rec \u2014 Chiandafelis(ph) recommended that we spend the day in this cave,\ncalled Arapo(ph). Kefalas(ph), and \u2014 and the night at his house. And that\u2019s exactly what\nwe did, this Spyros, Mr. Chiandafelis\u2019 son guided us to the \u2014 to the cave, and that again,\nI have a firsthand recollection. I remember this very vividly as a child going into a cave.\nIt was quite an experience, and I was \u2014 I was frightened. I was frightened at first, because\nit was so dark, especially, you know, before our eyes adjusted to the darkness, it was very\ndark, and there was all kinds of formations of stalactites and stalagmites. And my father\nSeptember 14, 2010\nfound a little ledge on the side, sort of halfway into the cave. It was like an alcove, and\nwe spread the blankets, and the four of us huddled together in this dark cave. And \u2014 and\nmy father, he \u2014 he always tried to calm everybody down, and \u2014 and he \u2014 this a \u2014 he\u2019s a \u2014\nwas a very good storyteller. So he would tell us different kinds of stories about his\nexploits, ab \u2014 as a soldier going up to the \u2014 to the front, the Albanian \u2014 Greek Albanian\nfront or \u2014 and then Bible stories, lots of Bible stories, which he embellished greatly to\nentertain us. And I don\u2019t know whether this is \u2014 actually happened. I don\u2019t know he \u2014 he\n\u2014 he \u2014 whether he explained to m \u2014 to us how these structures are formed in the cave. I-I\ndon\u2019t remember whether he explained, but I have a feeling that he did, but I\u2019m not\npositive. And so, it was hours that we had to s \u2014 to spend in this alcove, in the dark \u2014\nsemi-darkness. We could hear the dripping of the water in the back, as the water mixed\nwith minerals, would drip down into a \u2014 a pond at the bottom of the \u2014 of the cave. And\nthen suddenly we hear somebody call my father, you know, Mr. Matsas, Mr. Matsas.\nAnd we were frightened because we thought somebody discovered us. And so we\ndecided not to \u2014 to say anything, to keep quiet. But the voice persisted, Mr. Matsas, Mr.\nMatsas, then he said I\u2019m \u2014 this is Spyros. Come out, come out, it\u2019s safe, 1t\u2019s calm, this 1s\nSpyros, Chiandafelis\u2019(ph) son. And \u2014 and I don\u2019t remember whether we came out, or the\npeople outside came in, I don\u2019t remember. But later on my father said that he was afraid\nat first that they were going to throw a grenade, because at first we thought there were\nGermans, enemies. But what we discovered when we \u2014 we met the two people that\nSeptember 14, 2010\nSpyros had brought there, these were two other Jewish men who were seeking shelter,\nlike we were. They were in Agios Vlassis and when the Germans advanced, at that point\nthey left and they came to Psilovrahos, and then they were told that this Jewish family up\n\u2014there\u2019s another family up in \u2014 hiding up higher in the mountains. So now Mr.\nChiandafelis(ph) had several people to feed every night. But we decided that the villa \u2014\nthe \u2014 the cave was not safe either, so my father searched in the forest for a secluded place.\nAnd so we decided to spend the day in this secluded place, and the nights at the house.",
        "Q: So was it \u2014 was it your father who decided that it was not a safe place? And why\nwould he decide that, do you think?",
        "A: Because it was a place that was known by the villagers. This is not a cave, a remote\ncave that nobody knows about. He felt that 1t was known and it\u2019s best for the duration,\nyou know, while the Germans were in Psilovrahos, because they did come \u2014",
        "Q: They came to the town. They came from Psilovrahos.",
        "A: \u2014 they did come to Psilovrahos.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: It is best for us to be 1n a place that nobody knew, except perhaps Spyros and his\nfather.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And so I ev \u2014 again, I remember this secluded place. It was \u2014 1t was underneath a\nprotruding rock, to protect us from the rain. And so we \u2014 they gathered branches for trees\nSeptember 14, 2010\nto \u2014 to create a camouflage the opening. And so again we huddled together, the four of\nUS.",
        "Q: Was this another cave, or this is actually outside?",
        "A: It\u2019s outside.",
        "Q: It\u2019s outside.",
        "A: It\u2019s outside, but there\u2019s a rock, a very large rock that protrudes, creating a roof, and so\nwe \u2014 we Sat underneath and we blocked the opening with \u2014 with branches of fir trees and\nwhatever other materials that we\u2019re able to find. And we stand \u2014 we actually stand seven\nor eight day \u2014 days.",
        "Q: So you wou \u2014 would you go back \u2014",
        "A: Yes \u2014",
        "Q: And \u2014 at night \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 at night. At night we go back to Mr. Chiandafelis(ph) house, and Spyros would\ngive us some bread and olives or cheese for the day. And at night he would prepare a\nmeal. He acted like a waiter. He \u2014 his \u2014 Mr. Chiandafelis(ph) was very proud of his son,\nand Spyros sort of rose to the occasion, and he prepared bean soup, lentil soup or\nchickpea soup. That was the kind of food the villagers would eat. It would have meat\nperhaps once a week, or once every two weeks, if they could find it. And then we would\nspend the night on the floor. There were several people now. And then during the day, go\nback to that shelter.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "Q: A-An-And \u2014 and where did these men, these ex \u2014 th-the two \u2014 is it two or three \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, there were \u2014 actually at one point there were five.",
        "Q: So where did they go during the day?",
        "A: They \u2014 two of them decided that it wasn\u2019t safe for them to \u2014 to be even in\nPsilovrahos, maybe another village is safer. But later on they returned, because the\nsituation was not as good there as well. So, eventually there were only three additional\nJewish men that stayed in the village, plus the wife of one of them. Her name was orea \u2014\nAureo(ph) Zeelavee(ph). Now, these people were not ordinary people. One of them,\nAron(ph) Romano(ph) was a ship owner, very wealthy. And the other was an owner of a\nprivate bank. And Aron(ph) Romano(ph) always carried a little briefcase, which we\nthought was probably \u2014 contained gold coins, but did not want to use them, didn\u2019t want to\nreveal that he had gold. So he preferred to starve, because he didn\u2019t have the resources\nthat we had; sugar and soap and oil, to barter for other items to eat.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 did your parents barter with the person that \u2014 that had this house where you\nwere staying in \u2014 in at nights, so they gave them \u2014",
        "A: Yes, when we \u2014 you know, at the end of the eight days when \u2014 that was the period that\nthe Germans stayed in the village, my parents gave him sugar. This is how we paid. And\nhe was a very hospitable person, a very, very hard life.",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting, because everywhere you go, it appears as if people are willing to help.",
        "A: Yes, yes.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "Q: And it \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 you\u2019re not turned away by anybody.",
        "A: True.",
        "Q: It\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: There is \u2014 that is the truth. There was one family \u2014 actually he happened to be one of\nthe wealthiest people, who were not very helpful. There was a time when he could have\nhelped us tremendously to avoid experiencing literally starvation during the winter,\nbecause there was \u2014 well, I think I should tell you this part later in the story.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But \u2014 but he was the exception. Th-The villagers were very helpful, very helpful.",
        "Q: So \u2014 but you had no idea that the Germans were only going to stay in the village for\neight days \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: \u2014 clearly, cause they could have stayed for a month.",
        "A: True, true.",
        "Q: Right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But after eight days they left. And who told you that they left, so you could get out?\nDo you remember?",
        "A: The \u2014 the driver of the mules, who actually returned after he dropped us off, he\nreturned to the village, he came back to get us. And so we knew that it was time to come\nSeptember 14, 2010\nback, that th-the \u2014 the \u2014 the Germans had left the village. But at the same time, the rumor\ncirculated that \u2014 that the Germans, who had actually occupied the room, our room, had\nlooted our room that \u2014 you know, they looted Mr. Matsas\u2019 room, the Germans did. This\nwas the rumor that circulated. And so when we returned, soon as we returned, before we\neven entered the house \u2014 this is the story that I learned later on, the owner of the house\ncame and said, you know, the Germans occupied the room, and they looted your house.\nThey ate whatever you had, and they took away the remainder. And so we entered the\nroom, and everything was in disarray and all the food was gone. And there was a\nsubstantial supply of food, you know, sacks of all sorts of things. And so w-we became \u2014\nwe panicked. Especially my mother, what is going to happen, because this is the end of\nNovember, actually was probably already December and the winter is coming. The\nharvest is over, there\u2019s no possibility of us buying food from the villagers or elsewhere.\nSo \u2014 so my father tried to calm her down, saying well, we\u2019ll send a man down to\nAgrinion, we have a lot of food in the bank \u2014\nEnd of Tape Four\nSeptember 14, 2010\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "Q: Okay, so you come back to the village \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 and you find out that your stuff has been looted, and your mother is very upset.",
        "A: Very upset, and winter 1s coming and sources of food are scarce. And my father tried\nto calm her down, that we will send a man down in the village, in the \u2014 in Agrinion to get\nsome food from the bank. And this is something we did, but the man came back with one\nsmall ca \u2014 one can of oil, that was all he could bring, because he was bringing food\nsupplies for his family, and that was the only additional weight for the mule to carry. But\nI was friends with the \u2014 the children of the owner of the house, and they told me one day,\noh \u2014 they were boasting, oh, we have so much food now. We have rice and beans, we\nhave \u2014 we even have candles. We have things that we never had before. And I \u2014 I was\nvery impressed, and I reported this to my parents, you know, I said the \u2014 my friends, they\ntold me they have all this good stuff. And immediately my parents suspected that the\nowner of the house was the one who looted the room, and my father confronted him, and\nhe denied that he \u2014 he took anything. And my father persisted, and he had to accept to \u2014\nthe fact that \u2014 he had to admit that he did take a few things. He was afraid of my father\ntalking about this to the village, and that he was going to be embarrassed. And so he\nreturned a few items. But my parents knew that he probably had a lot more, and was\nhidden somewhere. And so my father searched the \u2014 the barn and other hidden \u2014 possible\nSeptember 14, 2010\nplaces where he could have hidden food, and sure enough they \u2014 he found a can of oil.\nAnd oil was a real treasure, because was \u2014 this is olive oil, was very hard to find, very\nvaluable, if you were going to use it as a commodity to exchange it for other kinds of\nfood. So my parents were infuriated with this man because he \u2014 he really \u2014 he created the\nsituation that we \u2014 we were trying to avoid, and that is lack of food in the winter. So they\nconsidered bringing this matter to the people\u2019s court. There were people\u2019s courts then, in\nvillages. They were not official courts, but they were \u2014 consisted of the elders of the\nvillage, and all sorts of ma \u2014 matters of \u2014 disputes were brought to the people\u2019s court.\nAnd the people\u2019s court was actually very severe in punishments that \u2014 that they imposed\non people. So my parents reconsidered that, because they were afraid he would be, who\nknows, imprisoned, or some very severe punishment; he had a young family, so they\ndecided to drop the matter. And that they also didn\u2019t want to draw attention to ourselves.\nSo they dropped the matter, and at this point we had to leave that room, and we went to\nanother house to live in. This was very similar to the one we occupied the first time. This\none had two rooms, one room was a Kafeneio, a caf\u00e9. And the other room was the room\nthat we occupied, and th \u2014 and it had a basement. And so \u2014 so that was a big change, it\nwas \u2014 we adjusted to it very quickly. But the main concern now was food. There was a\nfamily by the name Yovanos(ph) who lived in Agrinion, but had come to the village for\nthe summer, and they stayed on because of the \u2014 the war situation. But they had decided\nto return to Agrinion. And they had a lot of wheat with them. So my father, being a bank\nSeptember 14, 2010\nemployee, he conducted a transaction not with checks, but with wheat. He told him, if\nyou give us your wheat that is here, you can collect our wheat, which is stored in the\nbank. It was an exchange, and no wheat had to travel to Agrinion or from Agrinion to\nPsilovrahos, but it was a transaction that s-seemed reasonable to him, and he gave us a\ncertain amount of wheat. But he had more wheat, but this other villager that was wealthy,\nwho could have cooperated at this point and \u2014 and he could have made the Yovanos(ph)\nwheat available to us, he decided not to do that, and he kept the wheat for \u2014 for himself.\nAnd that was a very callous thing to do, and he, years later when \u2014 after the war, the man\nrecognized that he had done something very, very bad, and he came to my father and my\nparents and \u2014 and asked them for their forgiveness, because by \u2014 by not agreeing to make\nthis wheat available to us, he made life absolutely horrible for the family. So \u2014 so th-that\nis the situation now, we are \u2014 we have very little food. We do have this oil that the\nvillager brings from the village, and this wheat. Then my mother started exchanging\nsugar for a certain kind of cereal that is called Trachanas. It\u2019s a \u2014a coarsely ground\nwheat mixed with milk that is \u2014 that \u2014 that 1s in a dry state and when you add some milk,\nit expands, and it\u2019s a very nutritious food and very filling. So \u2014 so this is what my mother\nstarted doing, exchanging sugar for \u2014 for Trachanas or corn meal. Then some of the\nvillagers would give us some eggs from the chickens, some milk, a piece of cheese. It\nwas a very difficult situation and there\u2019s winter approaching, it\u2019s already winter. It 1s\ncold. And so then, my mother, wh-who is a very resourceful person, she decided that \u2014\nSeptember 14, 2010\nthat she is going to barter clothing, our personal clothes, for food. And so she became a\npeddler, and she went with my 13 year old brother from village to village, exchanging\nclothing for food. Or, she did other things. She knitted for people. She was \u2014 she had\nmany skills. She knew how to make lace. An-And one \u2014 one thought came to her mind is\nthat the girls in the village, they want to prepare their dowry, and I can teach them how to\n\u2014 to knit. I di\u2014 can teach them how to embroider, how to make lace, and so \u2014 and said,\nthere are a lot of girls in the village who would want this, and they would exchange my\nservices for food. And the one family that I mentioned earlier, the Tsulamitsu(ph)\nfamily, they had seven daughters. They had prepare seven dowries. So she went to \u2014\nstarted with them. And she\u2019d go there every day and help them, show them how to\nembroider, how to make lace and so on, in exchange for cheese or bread or whatever they\nhad. So they ha \u2014 my parents had to start rationing the food. It was less and less every\nday. And I \u2014 I remember it was winter, still winter, and there were some mulberry trees\nand fig trees. There are a lot of mulberry trees and fig trees in Greece. And my mother\nsaid, you know, when these, you know, these fig trees, when spring and summer come,\nth-they\u2019ll be full of figs. And so I remember this game very vividly, you know, walking\nunderneath those trees, waiting for someday to see figs up on the tree.",
        "Q: And that you remember as your own memory.",
        "A: That yes, I remember. In fact, at one point, it was in the summer when figs had\nformed, there was one fig tree that was growing on \u2014 on the edge of a retaining wall, and\nSeptember 14, 2010\nI reached to \u2014 to get a fig, and I fell off the retaining wall, and I \u2014 I remember that, of\ncourse. I didn\u2019t get hurt, but \u2014",
        "Q: Must have been a little scary.",
        "A: It was, it was. It was scary, yes. But \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember being hungry?",
        "A: Yes, I remember being hungry, and to this day, I cannot bear seeing people throw\naway food. You know for me food 1s something very, very valuable, and I\u2019m very\nconscious \u2014 I\u2019m very conscious of the waste that I see around me these days. But yes,\nhunger was pervasive. That\u2019s all we could think of was in our em \u2014 our stomachs were\nempty, was \u2014 it was \u2014 we were very hungry.",
        "Q: Now, were people in the village also hungry, or they were less so than you?",
        "A: The villagers \u2014 well, you know, they \u2014 they had chickens, so they could get eggs.\nThey would slaughter a chicken here and there to get meat. They had goats for milk. But\nwe had \u2014 didn\u2019t have any of these animals, and they had stored food, as they always do,\nfor the winter, like dry figs and walnuts, especially. Lentils and beans, dry beans. So\npoverty and hunger were pervasive, but we were \u2014 we were worse off than they were,\nbecause we didn\u2019t have these resources that they were used to; the animals that provided\nthem with nutritious food.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and your parents didn\u2019t have money either any more, an-and anyway, it was\nworthless.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: The money was worthless, yes, yes. One wonderful thing happened during this period\nof \u2014 of, literally, starvation. A group of partisans, or andartes, as they were known, they\ncame to the village and they camped there, they \u2014 they settled there for 20 days. There\nwere 60 of them. I don\u2019t know why they settled in the village, but my parents recognized\nthere was an opportunity for us to get food. And it was either my father or brother who\napproached the captain of this band, and described our desperate situation and asked them\nif they could help us. And the captain agreed to give us the equivalent of two portions of\na \u2014 of food for one partisan, for the four of us to share. And so my brother, when the \u2014 the\nbugle was sounded, he could go there with a pot, and they would give him the portion of\n\u2014 of a partisan, which was not very much. It was just corn soup and a piece of corn bread.\nBut for us it was God sent. And he did that twice a day, and we would share the food, and\n\u2014 and that was for 20 days. That was quite a \u2014 a long time. So that was the situation. I\ndon\u2019t know at what point my parents \u2014 my mother decided that she should use \u2014 not \u2014 to\nsell not only our personal clothing, but also household items. I don\u2019t know whether it was\nin that \u2014 in the wintertime or later on in the spring, but just all of a sudden she got this\nbright idea of \u2014 of using the cases \u2014 we had brought mattress cases. In Greece \u2014 in\nGreece you protect everything you have, like mattress, you have to have a case for the\nmattress, to protect it from dust. And so we \u2014 when we came to the village, we brought\nthese mattress cases with us, and we stuffed them with hay to make mattresses. So my\nmother, out of desperation she had this brilliant idea, said, I have these mattress cases. I\nSeptember 14, 2010\ncan \u2014 I can use them to make pants for \u2014 for boys, or men. These \u2014 the villagers are\ndressed in rags. And \u2014 but these mattress cases, usually, they have very bright stripes, red\nstripes. So my father said, nobody is going to wear these ridiculous looking pants, with\nthese bright stripes. And then he thought further and said well, we \u2014 we can dye them, we\ncan dye them brown. And that was my father\u2019s great opportunity to experiment and he \u2014\nhe said, we\u2019ll gather shells of \u2014 walnut shells, and they were plentiful in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in\nthe fields, and \u2014 and poppies. So this must have happened 1n the spring, early spring, and\nthere are lots of poppies in \u2014 growing in \u2014 in the mountains. So he made this concoction,\nboiled walnut shells with the poppies, creating this brown gooey material, and dipped\nthese mattress cases when they came, and boiled them for a few minutes, and then they\nturned brown. Later on I found out that \u2014 that in colonial times they used walnuts to dye\nwool and \u2014 and fabric. So \u2014 so my mother made pants for \u2014 for boys, and then she used\nsheets, the sheets that we brought, to make shirts for men. And so she had all these wares\nto exchange for food, then she went from village to village with my brother, doing that.\nAnd she\u2019d come home with \u2014 with cheese or bread or \u2014 everything was delicious to us,\nanything was delicious.",
        "Q: And she did all of this by hand, because \u2014",
        "A: Yes \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 of course, she had nothing else.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: \u2014 exactly. E-Everything by hand. It was \u2014 she\u2019d work long hours and in the daytime.\nShe had to do it in the daytime because one of the things we lost were candles, the\ncandles that we brought. And so it was winter, the days were short. But again my father,\nhe invented something, he experimented with pieces of rubber from the tires, car tires,\nthat the village cobbler was using to repair shoes. He would use the material from tires as\nsoles for shoes. And so he collected scraps of rubber and burned them. He \u2014 he mounted\nthem with a \u2014 an old rusty can by the fireplace and \u2014 and it burned. It gave off light, but a\nhorrible smell. The smell was absolutely horrible, but we had light at night. So \u2014 so he \u2014\nhe \u2014 both of my parents were very resourceful people, and they would always find the\nsolution to \u2014 to a problem.",
        "Q: Do you think your mother worked more than your father in some respects, that she \u2014\nshe had a harder time?",
        "A: Yes, definitely, she \u2014 she worked very hard. And my father, he was \u2014 he had a\nsedentary job at the bank, so he wasn\u2019t used to his long walks on rough terrain. So there\nwere times he had to cross a creek, or a \u2014 a river [indecipherable] that was not \u2014 not a\nvery deep river, but he \u2014 he came down with aches on his legs, and then he had the dizzy\nspells. He had a few medical problems that had \u2014 had the \u2014 they were left unattended,\nalthough there were a couple of occasions when my mother and brother, they walked a\nlong distance to a village called Tatarna that had a hospital for the partisans, and there\nwas a doctor there. They consulted with him, and the doctor gave them some medicine\nSeptember 14, 2010\nfor my father, but somehow the villagers and us had managed to recover whatever\nailments we had, on our own. So that was the situation in the winter. It was a very\ndesperate situation. Then when spring came, there were \u2014 things were a little better\nbecause they gave us a short \u2014 a small plot to cultivate. And then there were mulberries.\nThe mulberry trees plentiful, which caused \u2014 and we lived on mulberry berries for a\nnumber of days until we developed stomach cramps and we realized we had to stop that.\nBut it was a very difficult period, and my mother, she bore the brunt of it, she really did.\nThat is the reason why, throughout this period she kept saying that I will go myself down\nto the city and bring a horse-load of food. And \u2014 and there were groups of villagers that\nwere going to the city. And she said, Ill just join one of them and go down into the city.\nAnd my father and brother always say no, no, absolutely not. And she would say why?\nThe villagers go. And \u2014 and she \u2014 they would say, yeah, but you\u2019re not an ordinary\nvillager, you \u2014 you\u2019re Jewish. And she said, well, I have an I.D. card, because they \u2014 my\nparents had acquired I.D. cards issued by \u2014 by the Germans. The priests of the village\nprovided them with baptismal papers and so the papers were given to the German\nauthorities. The names had \u2014 were changed. And there was a picture and my \u2014 both my\nparents had an I.D. card with their picture and signed by German officials. But the \u2014 the\nironic thing 1s that in the I.D., they do not ask for religion. It\u2019s rather bizarre. Perhaps\nthey didn\u2019t want to raise suspicions that \u2014 because tha-that was one of the reasons why\nmany Jews in the cities, such as Ioannina did not feel threatened, did not feel that they\nSeptember 14, 2010\nshould leave, they should go into hiding, because the Germans were careful not to raise\nsuspicions of what was awaiting them. And \u2014 and in fact, the letters that we were\nreceiving from my relatives in Ioannina were \u2014 were, you know, why don\u2019t you come to\nIoannina, we have plenty of food. Why should you be starving up there? And the same\nletter from Evianir(ph) Papadapoulos(ph), our \u2014 my father\u2019s colleague, you know, come\nto Agrinion, there is plenty of food. And there were many cases of Jews who returned.\nThey had left the city and gone to the countryside to hide. And because nothing was\nhappening in the cities, they returned, and they were eventually arrested. But my \u2014 my\nfather, my brother were \u2014 an-and my mother were determined to stay in the village. So \u2014\nbut she, every time she saw a group of villagers going down to Agrinion, she would say,\nall I have to do is just join them and \u2014 and our situation will improve.",
        "Q: So she became more optimistic at a certain point?",
        "A: She just was so desperate that she was going to defy any danger that she was going to\nface. And eventually, in March, when the snow melted and the conditions for travel were\na little better, she \u2014 she joined one of these groups, and went down, started a long trek\ntowards the city of Agrinion. She walked for 12 hours, and on homemade shoes because\nher \u2014 she had a pair of shoes that was threadbare, and then the other pair were \u2014 had high\nheels. You can see how \u2014 how unprepared we were for this kind of life, she brought shoes\nwith high heels to Psilovrahos. And so she \u2014 she went with \u2014 with a group of villagers\ndown to Agrinion. This is very rough terrain, and all on foot. She walked for 12 hours,\nSeptember 14, 2010\nuntil she reached a village very close to Agrinion. I believe it was called\nFrangokisa(ph). Frangokisa(ph). And she had given \u2014 there was a young man, boy, who\n\u2014to whom my mother had given a slice of bread. She had \u2014 she brought two slices of\nbread, one for herself \u2014 well, for herself, both of them, but she was so tired, she asked\nhim, would you let me ride the mule if I gave you a slice of bread? And \u2014 and he did.\nAnd while they were doing this transaction, all of a sudden she hears her name, you\nknow, Mrs. Matsas, Mrs. Matsas. And that was \u2014 it turned out it was a friend of ours that\nthey knew from Arta, and her husband was the math teacher of my brother. What a\ncoincidence, in this wilderness. And her name was Zvolise(ph). And she said, Mrs.\nMatsas, where are you going, why are you here, where you should be far away from\nhere. And went on to say, haven\u2019t you heard, haven\u2019t you heard what happened to your\npeople? And then she went on to say, you know, the Jews of Arta and Preveza and\nIoannina have all been arrested. The Jews of Arta and Preveza are now housed in the\nPapapetrou tobacco warehouses and I don\u2019t know where they took the Jews of\nIoannina. And this 1s the first time that my mother learns of the fate of our relatives. It\nwas a very \u2014 a very painful, unbelievable news that she heard, 1t was \u2014 she was totally\ndevastated, crushed.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s stop the tape.\nEnd of Tape Five\nSeptember 14, 2010\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "Q: Okay, you \u2014 you wanted to go back to the hospital in \u2014 in Tartarna, is that \u2014",
        "A: Tartarna, Tartarna.",
        "Q: T-Tartarna.",
        "A: That was a very affluent village, and it had this hospital for the partisans and then the\nvillagers. One of the \u2014 the doctors there at one point was Thanos(ph) Papatheodoro(ph),\na very fine man, whose family also lived in the vicinity. And a \u2014 it\u2019s just a si \u2014 it was a \u2014\nquite a coincidence, my mother and brother met them, met the family and the doctor and\nthere were three daughters, Hera, Ephemia(ph) and Irini(ph), or Nini(ph). And the\nmiddle one, Ephemia(ph) became my best friend after the war. We\u2019re friends to this day.\nAnd there were \u2014 they were \u2014 played a very important role in the family, in my\ndevelopment. They were a very cultured family, and it was through them that I was\nexposed to classical music and paintings. Her father was an amateur painter. A very\nrefined person. And \u2014 and this 1s the hospital where my f\u2014 my brother was asked by the\ndoctor \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether it was Dr. Papatheodoro(ph) or Dr. Panopoulous(ph),\nthe earlier doctor, asked my father to sing the ma \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, my brother Mykas(ph), he\nwas known as Mykas(ph) partisan songs. And my \u2014 my f \u2014 brother loved those partisan\nsongs, they were in the air, everywhere. They were very idealistic, describing a\nwonderful society that is going to be built after the war, a society that was free of\nignorance and poverty and injustice. And all of these wonderful ideas appealed to him as\nSeptember 14, 2010\na young person. And so he \u2014 he learned all those wonderful songs. He sings them to this\nday. I\u2014I learned a few of them, but he was the one who \u2014 who sang them, and he had a\nbeautiful voice, he still does. So now I will come back to the \u2014 to this encounter of my\nmother with Mrs. Volis(ph). So Mrs. Volis(ph) tells her that you have to leave as soon as\npossible. She talked to her husband, Mr. Volis(ph), and he suggested that \u2014 n-now my\nmother actually, even at this point, she said \u2014 she insisted that she go into the city, in spite\nof all this. She said, we\u2019re starving, we \u2014 we have to get some food. And so her husband\nrecommended that she go to another village called Kamaroula, where he has a\nkombarro(ph). Kombarro(ph) is a godfather. And his name was Christos\nZambarros(ph), and he \u2014 he was a teacher, and he said, he will help you. So my mother\nstarted walking alone with this horrible knowledge of \u2014 of what had happened to our\npeople, to Kamaroula. She recognizes the house where this man lived, knocks on the\ndoor several time, they do not answer. Eventually they open the door very cautiously,\nthey let her in very quickly, and she \u2014 she told them who she was and who \u2014 who sent her\nto them, and she said, I\u2019m looking for Christos Zambarros(ph). These were the sisters\nof Christos, and they said \u2014 they were \u2014 they were frightened because the Germans has\nsearched their house moments before my mother arrived. They took her to the window\nand they said \u2014 pointed to the \u2014 to the square and said, look down there. You see, the\nGermans are still there and they\u2019re still searching for people there. They were searching\nfor partisans, because at this point the \u2014 the resistance had grown very strong and they\nSeptember 14, 2010\nwere sabotaging the German advance and German actions; blowing bridges and\ndestroying roads. And so they said, take this ker \u2014 they gave her a kerchief quickly, said\nput it on, and just pretend that you are our aunt from Psilovrahos. Don\u2019t say anything.\nThey sent for their brother and he came, and my mother explained to him what was ha \u2014\nwhat happened, and begged him to \u2014 to go \u2014 I think \u2014 I think what happened \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow \u2014 I\u2019m not so sure at this point whether she had to go to their country home where a\ndeaf mute aunt was guarding their store \u2014 the food supplies. I don\u2019t know where this\nmeeting with Christos Zambarros(ph) took place, but he was very, very nice, and\nunderstood the situation, and he said, don\u2019t worry. I will go down to \u2014 into the city, and I\nwill do my best to bring a horse-load of \u2014 of food. So in the meantime, my mother was\nwaiting in this country home with this deaf mute aunt. This \u2014 Kamaroula was very close\nto Agrinion. And a few hours later he returned, but without a horse-load of food, and\nexplained to my mother that the Germans were very watchful now, that they did not\nallow any food to leave the city. And they had \u2014 they had executed resistance fighters\nalready in the city, about 200 of them. So the situation had really become very hard, very\ntough. And they said, the only thing that I was able to bring from your friends, your\nneighbors, were tea, a bottle \u2014 a bottle of quinine tablets, and some matches. Very useful\nthings, but not what we expected. So \u2014 so my mother took this me \u2014 these few items and\nstarted walking back to our city \u2014 to the village. And at one point she \u2014 she met\nPepola(ph) Hannah(ph). He was a re \u2014 a Jewish resistance fighter, and he already knew\nSeptember 14, 2010\nwhat had happened. So they fell into each other\u2019s arms and they cried and it was a very,\nvery emotional experience for my mother. But she had to rush \u2014I should tell you that\nthere were a lot of Jewish young men that had joined the resistance up in the mountains.\nThey have left their \u2014 their families to \u2014 to save themselves, and they joined the\nresistance. Unfortunately, a number of them, they joined the resistance, the \u2014 the\nandartes, but then they were afraid of reprisals by the Germans against their families,\nand so they returned. But a number of them stayed in the mountains. So they had to rush\nto \u2014 Christos(ph) and my mother \u2014 th-the partisans did not allow anybody to walk after\nsundown, and it was close to sundown. So they climbed a hill, and at the top of the hill\nwas a little chapel, a little church that Christos\u2019 grandfather had built. And so they spent\nthe night there, and this was Saint Elias chapel. And then the next day they said goodbye,\nand there is my mother bearing this horrible news, alone, walking alone from this place,\nKamaroula, all the way to Psilovrahos, bearing the news alone, and crying all the time.\nSo when she came back, at that point my brother, my f\u2014 and my father were outdoors\nworking on this plot of land that they gave us to cultivate, and when they saw her\ncoming, she was walking very slowly, they started to laugh, and they said, didn\u2019t we tell\nyou not to go? You came back \u2014 she came back three days later and she \u2014 she was\nplanning to stay for seven or eight days in Agrinion. We told you not to go. And my\nmother was in terrible physical shape, bearing the horrible news and she said, don\u2019t\nlaugh. Come in the house and when I tell you what happened, you will cry with bitter\nSeptember 14, 2010\ntears. And so she told us, and we were \u2014 we were just devastated. And I remember this\nscene. I had never, ever seen my mother in that state. Her eyes were \u2014 her \u2014 her feet were\nswollen, her face was swollen, her eyes were red, and she was physically exhausted and\nemotionally just absolutely drained. So we were just \u2014 just \u2014 just shocked. It took us \u2014\ntook a long time for \u2014 to recover from this shock, and the only thing that sort of brought a\nray of hope that sustained us was the possibility that they were taken to Krak\u00e9w, Poland,\nbecause that was the rumors that circulated when they deported the Jews of Salonika,\nthat they were being relocated to \u2014 to Krakow to establish their own Jewish community,\nto be self-governed with their own mayor, to establish synagogues wherever they wanted.\nSo we thought that th \u2014 these Jews as well, from Ioannina, Arta and Preveza, that that\nwas their destination. And you know, my parents said, we have to do something, but \u2014\nbut what can we do in \u2014 we\u2019re in this remote village, what can we do? But my father\nknew that there was a contingent of the British mission in Greece in a nearby village,\nbecause the British, throughout the war, were there helping the war effort behind the\nscenes. Helping the resistance. The British were there helping the resistance, even though\nlater on, after the war, the British were instrumental in preventing communism from\nbecoming established in Greece. But we \u2014 my father knew of this British mission, and he\nsaid we \u2014 we \u2014 we have to contact them. We should write letters and we should send a\nletter to the \u2014 he said, the nations of the world have to know what\u2019s happening, they have\nto do something to stop it. We didn\u2019t really know what was \u2014 you know, anything about\nSeptember 14, 2010\nthe Final Solution or what diabolic plans of the Nazis were at this point. So \u2014 so my\nfather decided to write a letter addressed to the British government. And the letter, that\nwas going to be delivered to my aunt and uncle, who resided in Alexandria in Egypt,\nand they in turn would give the letter to the Greek government in exile, which was in\nEgypt. It all sounds so naive now, but at the time it was a way of doing something. And\nso sure enough, my father composed these letters and \u2014 and my mother and brother again,\nwere to deliver these letters to the village of Priantza. They didn\u2019t know where Priantza\nwas, they had to \u2014 to ask many people to find their way to Priantza. So they finally\narrive in Priantza and the \u2014 the British officials are willing to meet with them. And my\nmother, when she came back, she described that they \u2014 they walked into a large room,\nand they sat on two chairs, my brother and \u2014 and her, and facing these British officers,\nand they told them what had happened, and they \u2014 they begged them to deliver these\nletters. And the British officers, they accepted the letters, but they didn\u2019t sound very\nreassuring. In fact, one of them said to my mother, you know \u2014 and I don\u2019t know if it was\nhis wife and children or \u2014 or some other relative, they \u2014 you know, my wife and children\ndied in the bombing in London, and \u2014 and that \u2014 I have to bear that loss. So my mother\nwas in tears because she felt they were not giving her any encouraging words. And so\nthey left with my brother and felt that this was a fruitless mission. I don\u2019t know whether\nthese letters were ever de-delivered to \u2014 to anybody. But one \u2014 one good thing that they\ndiscovered while in Priantza, there were a lot of parachute drops that they were \u2014 th-they\nSeptember 14, 2010\nwere delivering supplies to the British officers in the British mission, and \u2014 and so the\nvillagers in Priantza had a lot of this material. So much of it they didn\u2019t know what to do\nwith it. And so when my mother discovered that this material was plentiful, she went\nfrom house to house asking for some of this parachute material, it\u2019s like a dark, khaki\nkind of greenish fabric, and rope from the parachutes. And so when they returned home\nafter their mission, my brother came into the hou \u2014 room with this big bundle of\nparachute material. And that was like gold for us, because my mother finally had fabric to\nsew dresses, blouses, and so on. But I \u2014 from what I recall, we did not dwell on this. Th-\nThere weren\u2019t many discussions about this between my parents, about the deportation of\nthe Jews. And \u2014 and th-the hope that we maintained throughout the war was that they\nwere relocated to Poland, and when the war is over, they will return. We were \u2014 my\nparents were primarily concerned with my grandparents, because they were in their late\nyears, and they were very concerned about them, if they would be \u2014 they\u2019II be able to\nsurvive. So then \u2014 so my mother started working again, sewing the dresses and blouses\nand resuming her bartering activities with my brother, from village to village. And that\nreally was very, very helpful, because now it\u2019s summertime, the villagers have more food\nto exchange for \u2014 for dresses, and so the situation, the food situation improved with the \u2014\nwith the weather, you know, spring and summer.\nSeptember 14, 2010",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And I was trying to figure out whether you were upset because your mother was so\ndistraught, because I-I didn\u2019t know whether you knew these rela \u2014 whether you\nunderstood how bad the situation was, or whether you were shocked by your own mother,\nand still are shocked by that.",
        "A: Yes, it is \u2014 it\u2019s really hard to distinguish, because I did have a recollection of my\ngrandmother, as I said earlier, and all these cousins sitting on this \u2014",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: \u2014 long table, my grandmother serving rice pudding, rizogalo. And \u2014 and \u2014 and so 1-it \u2014\nthis is very hard to distinguish, why I-I was very upset. Of course now, in retrospect, I\nwas upset by the loss, the enormous loss that we \u2014 we suffered. But at that point, it was\nmy mother, because my mother was, for me, a security blanket. And to see her in that\nstate, it was very upsetting. She was physically, and of course emotionally, a rag.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: It was \u2014 it was a very difficult moment.",
        "Q: But there really was no knowledge of the deportations from Salonika, or you knew\nthe deportations which \u2014 but the rumor was that they were relocated to Krakow.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Not that they were sent to Auschwitz.",
        "A: Right, exactly. When my father first learned about the deportations of the Jews of\nSalonika, which started I believe, in \u2014 in March of 1942 \u2014 was 40 \u2014",
        "Q: Or maybe earlier?",
        "A: \u2014 40 \u2014 no, it was \u00b042.",
        "Q: Was it \u00b042?",
        "A: I believe it was \u201942. He \u2014 was 1n April, he asked \u2014 this was the time when he asked \u2014\nwent to the \u2014 the manager of the bank and asked for a leave absence \u2014 he had the\npermission to use his leave of absence any time it became necessary. And my father told\nus later on the \u2014 the manager told him, you don\u2019t really have to worry about anything,\nyou are different. In other words, the Jews of Salonika are more Jewish than you are.\nAnd \u2014 and it \u2014 and it was true that the Jews of Salonika, they spoke Ladino and they\nspoke French, but they did not have good grasp of the Greek language, because it was a\nvery large community, with many educational institutions, and they could live isolated\nfrom the Greek Christian population. They were not assimilated the way the Jews are in\nother cities, who \u2014 who are known as the Romaniote Jews, who spoke grew \u2014 Greek\nfluently, and could blend in with the Greek population very easily and just disappear. So\nthere was that perception that those \u2014 you are different from those Jews. The fact of the\nmatter is that \u2014\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "Q: It didn\u2019t matter to the Nazis, did it?",
        "A: Didn\u2019t matter to the Nazis, right. This was \u2014 this \u2014 the \u2014 the Jews of Salonika were\ndescendants of the Jews that had come in 1492, expelled from Spain and they \u2014 they\nretained their language, while the Jews in the rest of there were known as Romaniote.\nThey had settled there, some of them even before the Romans. And others came later on\nand they \u2014 they spoke Greek fluently, and \u2014",
        "Q: Did the \u2014 do you think that that fact made it easier for you and your parents, your\nfamily to survive, because you could blend in wherever you were?",
        "A: Yes, yes, wherever we were. For example, the Jews of Athens, who were not seph \u2014\nthey \u2014 they were not Sephardim, strictly speaking, they were \u2014 they spoke Greek. A\nnumber of them hid in the city, and circulated in the city, and they could blend in with the\npopulation, but the Jews of Salonika had this added problem that hindered their \u2014",
        "Q: Well, let me ask you something. The resistance movement must have known what was\ngoing on. But that \u2014 but whatever they knew did not get filtered to your family, or to the\npopulation, 1s \u2014 is that correct? Or did they not know [indecipherable]",
        "A: What did they know about the di \u2014 I don\u2019t know if they knew about the Final Solution.\nI know in \u2014 years later I\u2014 I knew \u2014 I learned that the British government and the\nAmerican government knew as early as November 1942, of the Final Solution. But\nunfortunately \u2014 a-and \u2014 and \u2014 did not do anything to inform the Jews of what awaited\nthem. And that is the very painful thought that \u2014 that whatever was known by the author \u2014\nSeptember 14, 2010\nAmerican, British authorities was not disseminated on time for the Jews to \u2014 so survive,\nparticularly the Jews of Greece, and particularly these Jews that were arrested sort of late\nin the war.

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: There was plenty of time for the Jews to be informed of what awaited them, and \u2014 and\nalso Greece lended itself to \u2014 to the survival of the Jewish \u2014 first of all, there was a very\nstrong resistance group, very well organized, in the countryside. The countryside was\nfree, it was called \u2014 it was free Greece. Well organized, and then, they operated within\nthe cities. So, when we left Agrinion, it was October 1943, beginning of October, it was\neasy for anybody to go in and out of the city. It was October eighth, a few days after we\nleft, when the Greek press published orders prohibiting the Jews from leaving their place\nof residence. And if they were in another location, they were required to return to their\nplace of residence. So, it was as late as the beginning of October, 1943, when you could\nmove easily into the countryside.",

        "A: Yes, yes, I remember that very vividly, yes.",
        "Q: Why did you go? You went with your mother, 1s that correct?",
        "A: Yes, yes, the main reason I went \u2014 well, first of all I\u2014 I was always very anxious to\naccompany my mother on these many expeditions that she went with my brother.",
        "Q: Cause you really didn\u2019t like being without her.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t like to be \u2014 she was a pillar of strength for me, and I \u2014I felt lonely \u2014 oh, my\nfather tried to entertain me and keep me busy, but I \u2014 I \u2014 and \u2014 and of course, for me it\nwas a mystery, all these villages, you know. Cause they would come back with many\nstories to tell about oh, how a sheep was slaughtered, you know, because the village \u2014 it\nwas done, and it was a big event, and the dogs were barking. There were a lot of\nadventures that my brother and mother had on these expeditions. And so I felt it was just\n\u2014 when my mother suggested that, I \u2014 I was thrilled. I had some sort of a rash between\nmy fingers, and \u2014 and my mother was really exhausted from her travels in the villages,\nand so she needed to recuperate somehow. So \u2014 and I was very thin, a-and the villagers\nhad this belief that the spa can cure anything, anything you had, whether it was a skin\nproblem or orthopedic problem, whatever you had. The place to go was in Kremasta.\nSeptember 14, 2010\nAnd so my mother one day, it was August, it was summer, she told me, you\u2019re coming\nwith me and it will be a nice place, we\u2019ll be by the river. And so we walked \u2014 we re \u2014 you\nwalked to every place, you didn\u2019t take a mule or anything like this, it wasn\u2019t very far.\nAnd we went to Kremasta, and this place was just teeming with people. There were a lot\nof partisans, ardat \u2014 andartes, recuperating andartes. Many of them were injured, and\nthey were recuperating there. There were villagers that had orthopedic problems, and they\nwould \u2014 would \u2014 would come to Kremasta for the baths. The baths were supposed to\ncure everything. And my mother st \u2014 I remember her saying how people would come\ncurled up in a basket on a mule, take the baths and then they would walk straight, you\nknow, without the assistance of a cane or anything. I mean, there were miraculous cures.\nSo we \u2014 we shared a room with another woman and her child, and we started going into\nthese baths, they were constructed of cement, and they would get filled up with this water\nthat was \u2014 smelled of sulfur, like rotten eggs. And my mother kept saying, well this is\nvery good, you know. I couldn\u2019t bear the smell \u2014 this is \u2014 this is very good for you. And\nth-the following day my fa \u2014 my brother joined us, and it was a sort of a nice, little\nvacation. But unfortunately came to an abrupt end when the captain of the unit of the\npartisans that were stationed in Kremasta announced that th-the \u2014 first of all, the\npartisans had to go back to their units, wherever they belonged, and the villa \u2014 villagers\nhad to go back home because the Germans were advancing towards that area. So, people\npanicked, they immediately stopped their baths and they started just a huge group of\nSeptember 14, 2010\npeople, some on canes or sticks \u2014 not canes, but sticks, or \u2014 or mules and horses, going\nback to their homes. And so when we reached the village with my mother and brother,\nthe village was in a state of excitement, because this time all of the villagers were going\nto leave the village. They \u2014 with their animals, because the \u2014 at this point the Germans\nhad become very aggressive towards the villagers, who at the beginning they were trying\nto appease, but now the villagers were supporting the resistance by providing them with\nshelter and food and so these \u2014 th-the Germans were carrying out retaliations against the\nvillagers by executing them, or burning the villages. So that was known, and so\neverybody was leaving the village with their animals. And my father was in the process\nof baking bread in the \u2014",
        "Q: In the oven.",
        "A: \u2014 his famous homemade oven. And there was no time for the bread to \u2014 to \u2014 to bake\ncompletely. This reminds me of the exodus from Egypt, with Moses. And \u2014 and now we,\nagain we pack as many things as we possibly could. And this time we don\u2019t have any\nmules to transport things, so we have to travel light, with one blanket and very few food\nsupplies. And so everybody is leaving the village, and this time we go to another \u2014 a\nplace much higher than the earlier place of Chiandafelis. This place is called Kamaria.\nAnd so the entire village, with their animals, they camp this plateau at the top of the\nmountain, which offered a very good vantage point view of the villages below, not only\nPsilovrahos but the other surrounding villages. And so there we are, it\u2019s August, the sun\nSeptember 14, 2010\nis burning, there\u2019s no \u2014 they \u2014 we \u2014 we had brought the canteen, a small canteen full of\nwater, but it was very quickly exhausted. The villagers knew of a \u2014 a spring, which my\nbrother used to fill up the canteen again, but still not enough water. The villagers, because\nthey knew the terrain very well, and they were used to this rough terrain, they were able\nto discover other sources of water, but \u2014 but not us. So my father actually had to \u2014 to go\nfrom villager to villager begging for a little bit of water to fill the canteen. And I\nremember we were allowed only three gulps of water, you know, no more, because it had\nto last. The other problem was that we didn\u2019t have \u2014 we brought only one blanket and it\nwas very cold at night up at the top of the mountain, so my father borrowed a blanket\nfrom one of the villagers. And we decided \u2014 my parents decided that it would be best if\nwe didn\u2019t stay with the rest of the villagers, but went to a secluded place, so in case the\nGermans came to Kamaria, they wouldn\u2019t find us. So again we were separated, we were\nseparated from the rest of the villagers, and we found a secluded place and my mother or\nfather or Mykas(ph) caught a goat, a stray goat, and we milked it. So we had a little bit of\nmilk. And so we \u2014 we stayed in this place. Now, my mother was in \u2014 she was sick, she\nhad fever, she was in very, very bad shape, because she had gone to \u2014 to Kremasta to\nrecuperate from her ordeals, and now, all of a sudden, she has to go up to the mountains\nagain. And I \u2014 I remember this \u2014 my brother doesn\u2019t remember this, but my \u2014 but I do \u2014\nmy mother saying, if the Germans come here, Mykas(ph) will take Ninetta, climb a rock\nand then a tree. And Father should hide somewhere, and I will throw all of our\nSeptember 14, 2010\nbelongings off this \u2014 on the \u2014 off the precipice and I will get all \u2014 you know, fall off the\nprecipice as well, not to leave a trace of our presence there. And for me, you know my\nmother, who was a pillar of strength, to say such thing was a very \u2014 a very shaky \u2014 shook\nme up. And probably that\u2019s the reason why I remember it. So we \u2014 from \u2014 from this\nlocation, we were able to see fires being set on the villages below. And it was, you know,\none village after the other being set on fire, systematically. And they had reached our\nvillage, Psilovrahos, and they began to burn those houses as well. And \u2014 and it was \u2014 it\nwas horrible, because these people were very poor to begin with, and now they\u2019re losing\n\u2014 to lose their house and their household, it \u2014 it was awful. But then, suddenly, the fire\nstopped \u2014 the sa \u2014 fires in Psilovrahos. They had burned a few houses, but then the \u2014 the\nf\u2014 the fire stopped. And we didn\u2019t know what had happened, but later on \u2014 in fact, on my\nlast visit to Psilovrahos in 2005, some of the villagers told me what had happened. One\nof the villagers, his name was Bulumbashez(ph), a-an old, elderly person, became so\ninfuriated with what was happening, that he defied the danger and he started coming\ndown the m \u2014 the mountain with his cane and he had binoculars, creating a lot of\ncommotion as the rocks were tumbling down, and the two Germans with the torches that\nwere setting the houses on fire, they thought that the andartes were coming down. An-\nAnd so they stopped and left. And \u2014 and so this man really saved the village from \u2014 from\nbeing burned to the ground. So it \u2014 there\u2019s so many things that I learned afterwards, and\nat the time \u2014\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t know, right.",
        "A: \u2014 they were happening, but we didn\u2019t know what was happening. For example, that\nexplosion that we heard the first time that we had to leave the village at \u2014 at \u2014 that\nexplosion, we have an explanation now. We learned af-afterwards that the andartes in\nAgios Vlassis where they were supposed to stop the advance of the Germans, recognized\nthey didn\u2019t have enough forces and so they set the ammunition depot on fire, and so they\nex \u2014 that was the source of the explosion.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: But at the time, you hear sounds, we don\u2019t where \u2014 what the cause of it.",
        "Q: Did your hand get better from even your brief time at the \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes \u2014",
        "Q: They did get better.",
        "A:\u2014 yes. And my mother suffered of an ear infection, and that also got better. I mean,\nthere\u2019s no doubt that these waters had \u2014 and \u2014 and mud had medicinal \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 factors, but \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember having lice in your hair?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Do I remember that? That was a nightmare. That is a story in itself. The\nblanket that my father borrowed from one of the villagers in Kamaria was infested with\nlice. And so when the Germans retreated and the whole village returned, we came back,\nSeptember 14, 2010\nand suddenly our clothes, our hair was infested with lice. It was a horrible situation, and\nthere were no medicines, of course, to \u2014 and insecticides. So \u2014 and that again, I remember\nas a firsthand experience, how we went to a remote location. My parents had to borrow a\nlarge kettle and \u2014 and we had soap, so my parents, they washed all the clothes with soap,\nand then \u2014 and blankets, and everything, all of our possessions, and then they boiled them\nin water. They lit fire under this kettle and they boiled them to \u2014 to kill the lice. And we\nhad to dry our clothes and fortunately it was August, so it was easy to dry them. We\nwashed everything that we possessed. But unfortunately, I \u2014 I had the very thick, curly\nhair, and they \u2014 the lice were settled there \u2014",
        "Q: Comfortably.",
        "A: \u2014 comfortably. And my mother \u2014 one way to \u2014 to control the lice is to crush the insect\nbetween your thumbnails and also crush the very tiny eggs that they lay on your hair\nstrands. But it was impossible, and I had to scratch like mad. And then my mother said\none day, what if I cut off this side of your hair? And I said yes. We didn\u2019t have mirrors,\nso I didn\u2019t know what I looked like. And it felt much better, so I said, let me cut the other\nside as well. So that felt better. Little by little she cut off all of my hair totally, totally.",
        "Q: And this you remember?",
        "A: This I remember. And I remember that she put a hood on my head so the children\nwouldn\u2019t make fun of me. And the children, of course, you know, this is summer. They\u2019d\nask me \u2014\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 why are you wearing a hood? And IJ said, I like hoods \u2014 and I don\u2019t remember what I\nsaid, but I didn\u2019t care what they said. I was really \u2014 it was a great, great relief. I\nremember this so vividly, yes.",
        "Q: So did \u2014 did it actually remove all the lice when she did that?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Because they weren\u2019t resting on your scalp, they were ins \u2014 1n \u2014",
        "A: No, she was able to wash my scalp easily, and \u2014",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right, which she couldn\u2019t do \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 so \u2014 but it was the hair where they had \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with lice,\nbut \u2014",
        "Q: No, Pm not really familiar, no.",
        "A: Greeks who lived to the \u2014 with the \u2014 the war period are very familiar with lice, it was\npandemic, it was [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Well certainly when you talk to concentration camp survivors, they talk about lice all\nthe time.",
        "A: Of course, of course, of course.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Because that\u2019s one of the \u2014\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s interesting. So you were \u2014 oh \u2014",
        "A: Yes, the \u2014 the \u2014 the villager, I don\u2019t know whether it was the owner of the house or\nanother villager, they gave my family a plot of land that had never been cultivated before,\nand it was full of rocks. It was a very, very rocky village. And so my father had to borrow\ngardening tools to hoe and shovel.",
        "Q: This is after you come back?",
        "A: This is \u2014 this was done in the spring, so this is before going up to Kamaria \u2014",
        "Q: Uh-huh, okay.",
        "A: \u2014 because we started cultivating this piece of land in the s \u2014 in the spring. And so we\nhad to extract the rocks and my brother had to carry manure. That was another thing that\n\u2014 the villagers were \u2014 were willing to share whatever they had, so they had to share the\nma-manure from their animals and my brother would carry it on her \u2014 his back. And then\nmy father didn\u2019t know anything about gardening, but he learned quickly; he had to learn\nquickly. And so we made a garden, we planted onions and beans, maybe potatoes as well,\nI\u2019m not sure. So we did \u2014 we did get some \u2014 some food from the garden, not much.",
        "Q: But some.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I see. Do you remember the \u2014 what \u2014 what might be called liberation? I don\u2019t know\nwhat you called it in Greece, but there was an end in 1944, right?\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Earlier than in other places, actually.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. The first news about liberation reached us in \u2014 in September. There\nwere \u2014",
        "Q: Of \u201944?",
        "A: Of \u201944. There was this \u2014 the news that th-the Germans were being withdrawn \u2014 were \u2014\nwere with \u2014 withdrawing from Greece, because it didn\u2019t happen overnight.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But my parents reaction was caution. They did not want to \u2014 to return right away, so\nthey wanted to wait until we were certain that the Germans had retreated from Agrinion.",
        "Q: And did you notice? I mean, you were six now.",
        "A: Did I know that? I don\u2019t think I knew that. I don\u2019t think I \u2014 I was conscious of that at\nall, no, it\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: Right, okay. So when did they become certain, so that you could leave?",
        "A: It was in October when the Germans had \u2014 news had reached Agrinion that the\nGermans had retreated, and there were probably villagers that had gone into Agrinion\nand they witnessed that the \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 Germans indeed had \u2014 had left the city. And so we didn\u2019t all leave together to return\nto the city. First it was my father and mother that returned, because the house where we\nSeptember 14, 2010\nlived before the war was no longer available because the owner o-occupied the house.\nAnd so there was a housing shortage. There was always a housing shortage in Agrinion\nbecause the people preferred to grow tobacco than build houses. There were always\ntobacco fields everywhere, and it \u2014 it was a very big industry for Agrinion. After the war,\nthe family next door, that was their livelihood, planting and selling tobacco. So I know all\nabout the process of growing tobacco, from beginning to end, except for smoking, I never\nsmoked.",
        "Q: So your parents went first to try to find a place.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And di-did \u2014 did Mike \u2014 Michael \u2014 your brother take care of you? Is that wa \u2014",
        "A: Yes, Michael \u2014 Mike \u2014 Mykas(ph) \u2014",
        "Q: Mykas(ph).",
        "A: \u2014 and I stayed back, and he was supposed to be in charge of me and himself. And\napparently we must have eaten something that was stale or spoiled, and we both became\nill; very, very ill. I-It was \u2014 you know, having survived the war, here is a situation where\nwe could have lost our lives, had our parents not returned on time to \u2014 to rescue us.\nBecause I don\u2019t think any of the neighbors knew of our situation. We \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow what he cooked something that burned the pot, and then I don\u2019t know what kind of\nfood we ate, but we were very, very ill. But while my parents were in Agrinion, they\nreally had a hard time finding a house. And my mother in her memoirs describes their\nSeptember 14, 2010\nfirst night in \u2014 in the city. There were \u2014 we really did not look like city people any more.\nMy father had a long beard and he looked more like a partisan than a bank employee.\nAnd my mother was emaciated, and she was really transformed. And they were in the\nmain square, Letea(ph) Belu(ph) of Agrinion, and my mother describes how a friend of\nours approached them cautiously, because they looked vaguely familiar, and as he got\ncloser and closer, realized who they were. And he was overjoyed, because he was one of\nthe Agrinion residents that witnessed the incarceration of the Jews of Preveza and Arta\nin the warehouses of Papapetrou. And he probably thought that we also were among\nthem. So he was overjoyed. It was like he saw people who were resurrected. And he ba \u2014\nhe asked them where do you plan to spend the night, and then he \u2014 he suggested that they\nspend the night in the house of Mr. Zahoropoulos(ph), who was a bus driver, driving a\nbus from Agrinion to Athens. And he is the one who, when my mother and my brother\nwere leaving the house to go to the Bokoros house, he was on his way to our house, and\nhe encountered us on the street. And he said, oh, so Mrs. Matsas, I was just coming to\nyour house to tell you that the Jews of Athens have gone into hiding. See, he was \u2014 that\nwas his route. He was just returning from Athens and wanted to inform my family.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So this is where my parents spent their first night back in Agrinion, and my mother\ndescribes how hospitable people were, and they \u2014 they tried to do everything they could\nto make them feel comfortable. So they had a hard time finding a house, but eventually\nSeptember 14, 2010\neither Mrs. Huropoulos(ph) or someone else suggested to my parents that they go to an\nagency which was run by \u2014 by [indecipherable] who were really at this point sort of in\ncontrol of the city and they sent my parents to this house. And the house had two levels,\nwe were going to occupy the lower level, with a very beautiful garden, which we found\nout later that the Italians had constructed. And when the landlady found out that we were\nJewish, she immediately went to this agency and said, why did you send me the Jews?\nAnd the young woman there, the employee said \u2014 said, close your mouth, and what\ndifference does it make whether you\u2019re Christian or Jewish? They\u2019re people. And \u2014 and\nso she \u2014 she had to \u2014 to tolerate us.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And that\u2019s one of the stories that you were going to say about some people\nwho \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 who were not necessarily helpful, right?",
        "A: Right. There\u2019s \u2014 there were some people who were not very supportive.",
        "Q: Right. I think we have to stop the tape now.\nEnd of Tape Seven\nSeptember 14, 2010\nBeginning Tape Eight",
        "Q: So, do your parents co-come within a couple of weeks or less to \u2014",
        "A: No, it was a matter of days \u2014",
        "Q: Days.",
        "A: \u2014 days, days, yes.",
        "Q: Okay. And the two of you are sick in bed.",
        "A: Sick in bed, hardly able to speak, and they quickly had to \u2014 you know, there was no\nmedicine they could give us, and they didn\u2019t even know what was wrong with us, but\nthey \u2014 they gave us some nourishment, which we lacked for \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 many days.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And we recovered after a while, and \u2014",
        "Q: So that was okay.",
        "A: \u2014 we were revived, yes.",
        "Q: And so, did you then go to Agrinion?",
        "A: Yes, then my \u2014 I \u2014 I believe they sent my brother first, with \u2014 with Baba(ph)\nYoros(ph) with a horse loa \u2014 load of food, because by then we had \u2014 having sold all these\nlittle dresses made out of the parachute, my mother had collected a lot of wheat. Because\nshe would sell dresses to people who didn\u2019t have wheat, but with a promise that when\nSeptember 14, 2010\nthey harvest, they would \u2014 she would be paid at harvest time. So now we have quite a bit\nof wheat to transport into the city. So \u2014 so my brother and \u2014 and this Baba(ph) Yoros(ph)\nand the mule, or horse, I don\u2019t know what it was, they come down into the city. I \u2014 I-\nI\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m glad that I\u2014 you asked me this question, because I didn\u2019t say anything about\nBaba(ph) Yoros(ph). There was a time, after the first time that \u2014 which was in November\n\u2014 when we had to leave Psilovrahos and go to Chiandafelis\u2019 house. There was another\ntime when we had to leave the village. I don\u2019t remember which month it was, but this\ntime my father and Mykas(ph) decided to leave the village, but my mother decided to\nstay, to guard whatever food we had. So my mother and I stayed in the house, and we\nwere joined by the wife of Mr. Lavee(ph), her name was [indecipherable], and she\nspoke German, and at one point she actually spoke with the Germans, and she claims that\nshe protected the upper village of Psilovrahos from the Germans. I don\u2019t know, this is a\nstory that I\u2019m not very clear on. But \u2014 so my mother and I slept in the room, and then\nearly next morning we hear a knock on the door. And we woke up, and there was\nBaba(ph) Yoros(ph), who was a neighbor, he was a retired policeman, and his son was a\npartisan. And Baba(ph) Yoros(ph) said to my mother, what are you doing here with your\nchild? If the Germans were to come to the village and \u2014 and take you and your child, I\nwill never, ever forgive myself. And so when my mother heard that, she ha \u2014 didn\u2019t have\nto hear anything more, she packed quickly and \u2014 and \u2014 and she packed more than \u2014 than\nshe could carry, and she \u2014 in her memoir she says how she \u2014 she didn\u2019t want to leave the\nSeptember 14, 2010\n\u2014 the things that she packed, which was food and \u2014 and a blanket, but at the same time\nshe realized that she couldn\u2019t carry it. And at that point, Mrs. Tsulamitsu(ph), this \u2014 the \u2014\nthe mother of this \u2014 of the seven daughters who my mother was tutoring and knitting and\ncrocheting and making lace, she appeared with her mule, and \u2014 and she saw my mother in\n\u2014 in this \u2014 in distress, and she said, oh don\u2019t worry, I will carry all of your belongings.\nAnd so, with her, we reached the upper village, and \u2014 and so this is how we stand this\ntime when the \u2014 the Germans \u2014 that was their second foray into our region, but this time\nthey never reached the village, and \u2014 and so \u2014 and so we all returned. So this is Baba(ph)\nYoros(ph) who played a significant part in \u2014 in our story. As I said, th-the people really \u2014\nthey tried to \u2014 to help in any way they \u2014 they could, including th-the priest. You know,\nwe \u2014 we used to go to the church, first of all to \u2014 not to show that we were any different\nthan the other villagers, and also to eat some food there, because whenever there was a \u2014\na memorial service, they would serve koliva, which is a mixture of boiled wheat and\npomegranates, cinnamon and sugar. It\u2019s a very nutritious, delicious thing, but we\u2019d go\nthere and \u2014 and the relatives of the deceased would give everybody a handful of this and\nso there was another source of food for us. And the priest, I don\u2019t remember his name.\nPapa Demetrius(ph), perhaps. I don\u2019t remember his name. He used to come to our house\nquite often, because he befriended my parents. And my mother would always serve him\ncoffee, which was a rare find, a ra \u2014 a re \u2014 a real treat for him. And he would chat with\nmy father. I don\u2019t know what they talked about, but we went to \u2014 attended even Easter\n100\nSeptember 14, 2010\nservices \u2014 Friday, Good Friday services. And this is the ttme when \u2014 I learned later on,\nyou know, after the war, I \u2014 I used to go to the church with my friends a lot. And so as I\nsaid earlier, I knew a lot more about the Christian religion than \u2014 than the Jewish religion.\nBut on Fridays, when Jesus has been crucified and \u2014 and he\u2019s dead, and the priest is\nsupposed to exhort his flock to \u2014 to move them, that this wonderful human being\nsacrificed his \u2014 his life t-to save you. He\u2019s \u2014 and so he would \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he would ha \u2014\nhe had to give a sermon to make people cry, especially the old women cry, and so he had\nto go on and on with the crucifixion and the pain that he suffered on the cross. And so\nSunday they celebrated Easter, the resurrection, he came to our house and apologized to\nmy parents for having to give this kind of sermon in front of us. So 1-it was, of course,\nappreciated by my parents. He was a kind man, and he said, what can I do? I\u2019m expected\nto do that, I\u2019m expected to give this kind of sermon. So now, go back to my brother and\nBaba(ph) Yoros(ph), they\u2019re returning to the villa \u2014 to Agrinion. And so my \u2014 my\nbrother arrived with \u2014 with food, to Agrinion. And then, after a few days, my parents and\nI came down into the city.",
        "Q: What happened to the food in the bank?",
        "A: The food ca \u2014 we recovered the food in the bank, was \u2014",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yes, whatever food was \u2014",
        "Q: So-\n101September 14, 2010",
        "A: \u2014 was available, stored, it was returned. Then they established \u2014 the EAM-ELAS\nestablished ETA, which was an organization to distribute food, and they made my father\nin charge of it, and my father was very, very proud of this task because he felt he was part\nof the resistance, part of ELAS - EAM-ELAS, yes.",
        "Q: So the war is over, but then a civil war begins, doesn\u2019t it?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Does that begin almost right away?",
        "A: Almost right away, yes.",
        "Q: So you \u2014 you have a very long experience of w-war of various kinds, don\u2019t you?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. And the \u2014 the sad thing 1s that the \u2014 th-the country is polarized. It was\npolarized before the war, but now even more. And Agrinion was dominated by the \u2014 by\nthe people that were members of EAM-ELAS, and their personal friends that had joined\nthe resistance, EAM-ELAS. And there \u2014 there are trials that are taking place. It is an\nabsolutely horrible situation. Th-The people are drained from the war experience with the\nGermans, and now they have to confront the civil war, where literally brothers are\nfighting each other. There were \u2014 there were people belonged to the same family, and yet\nideologically they were \u2014",
        "Q: They were in different places.",
        "A: Different places, yes.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s goes on for four years.\n102September 14, 2010",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: 1945 until 1949.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a long time.",
        "A: Right. Long time.",
        "Q: So when it\u2019s over, you\u2019re 11.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: And how is your life during that period? Is it \u2014 is it as difficult as it was during the w \u2014\nI mean, now you\u2019re older \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 and you \u2014 you experience more in terms of your memory, I don\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: Right. Again, my life, my personal life as a child growing up was rather undisturbed. I\n\u2014 I was \u2014 you know, I was imbued with all these ideas of social justice and freedom, that\nhad been absorbed. You know, I would hear this all around me. People that admired, and\nhad fought s \u2014 and \u2014 during the \u2014 the \u2014 you know, y \u2014 they had joined the resistance, they\nwere my heroes. The people in EAM-ELAS, they were the ones who saved us. So I-I had\nno \u2014 I \u2014 for me, those were the people I was \u2014",
        "Q: You were rooting for them?",
        "A: I was rooting for them. The father of my friends, my best friends, who by the way,\nthey lived across the street from us, Dr. Papethadoro(ph) and the three daughters, they\n103\nSeptember 14, 2010\nlived across the street. I admired him and \u2014 and I knew that his relatives and friends, they\nwere \u2014 I knew the side they were with. So I just was sent to school, like \u2014 like all the\nother children, but I was \u2014 I was sent to the third elementary school, which served the \u2014\nthe children who lived in the outskirts of the city and the surrounding villages. So my\nfriends were these children who came from the surrounding villages, and by comparison,\nI was from a middle class family, and I was sort of a more sophisticated person. So I \u2014 I\nha \u2014 I always had the idea that my family was rich. We weren\u2019t, at all. But because my\nfriends and \u2014 and \u2014 and classmates were from the surrounding villages, who were\nimpoverished. But my association \u2014 a-and \u2014 and my friends, Dr. Papethadoro\u2019s(ph)\ndaughters went to the fourth elementary school, which served the city children. These\nwere girls who celebrate \u2014 had birthday parties. I had never heard of a birthday party.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But they had birthday parties and they invited their friends, and they would have very\ngood food, and they lived in the heart of the city. We lived in the outskirts. So there was\nthis \u2014 so I remember this very vividly, of course, because I was already, you know, six,\nseven, eight, nine years old. And \u2014 but my association with the daughters of Dr.\nPapethadoro(ph) was something that enriched my life and opened worlds that I wasn\u2019t\naware of. They \u2014 they had a record player, I remember, and they had a few records of\nclassical music. And we would listen to the music, and we would make plays with \u2014 write\nthe plays and produce them for the neighborhood children. And this \u2014 the \u2014 my friend\n104September 14, 2010\nHera, who \u2014 she\u2019s going to give a lecture in just a few days on art, she would make all\nthe costumes and the scenery. And \u2014 and my friend became eventually a professional\nactress, my best friend. So it was a\u2014a very rich and happy childhood that I had, th-\nthanks to \u2014 to my assoc \u2014 my friendship with this family.",
        "Q: Did they open you up to things that even your family wasn\u2019t doing, in some \u2014 in some\nways?",
        "A: Such as what?",
        "Q: Well, classical music \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes, oh yes \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 or art [indecipherable] because that was \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 definitely.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yeah, yes, and \u2014 and I very vividly remember a painting that their father \u2014 an oil\npainting that the father had done, and it was prominently displayed 1n their living room.\nBut I became a part of the family, they jokingly would say, oh, this is our fourth\ndaughter. And they were just beautiful people.",
        "Q: Were your parents jealous of this, or no?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No, they \u2014\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: \u2014no, not at all, they were actually very grateful, because my mother, when we\nreturned to the city, she \u2014 well, a few days after we returned, a trickling of survivors\nbecome \u2014 began to pass through Agrinion, and among them cousins who had joined the\npartisans. These are cousins that escaped in Larisa(ph) and they joined the partisans and\nthis is where they spent the war years. And they were returning home not knowing what\nhappened to their families. They had absolutely no idea what had happened. So my\nmother, after these cousins returned, she decided to go to Ioannina. And at this point, we\ndon\u2019t know what has happened to them. This is early on. Cause we didn\u2019t find out what\nhappened until \u2014 see, this is October 1944. We didn\u2019t find out the war ended in the spring\nof \u00b045, so we didn\u2019t know what was happening. So my mother decided to travel to\nIoannina, and this is a heartbreaking experience for her because she goes into the homes\nof her sisters, Eftyhia and Annetta(ph). Th-They had \u2014 they lived in Ioannina, they\nwere married there, they had children. And these houses are occupied by villagers who\nhad \u2014 whose villages had been devastated and they were coming into the city. They had\nbeen devastated because of the civil war. And there was nothing wrong with them\noccupying those houses, but for \u2014 for \u2014 for my mother \u2014",
        "Q: It was hard.",
        "A: \u2014 it was really horrible. She was knocking on the doors and \u2014 and they opened the\ndoor and these strange faces were there, occupying her sisters\u2019 homes. And my cousin\nSam, he was one of the young men who escaped and joined the resistance \u2014 Sam\n106\nSeptember 14, 2010\nMeyer(ph) was his name, he was the son of my Aunt Rezina(ph). Rezina(ph) was one of\nmy father\u2019s sisters. He kept on trying to console my mother, saying, you have me, you\nhave \u2014 Aunt Esther \u2014 Esthere(ph), you have me now. I'll take care of you; you have me.\nAnd he himself didn\u2019t know where his family was, where his parents were. Yet for \u2014 for\nmy mother it was an absolutely horrible, horrible time. So when she returned from\nIoannina, she wanted to occupy herself with whatever she could. Something that would\ntake her out of the house. And so she \u2014 oh, she says in her memoirs that while she was in\nIoannina, she met a merchant who was smuggling fabrics from Albania. And she\ndiscovered that the person who was providing him with the fabrics, was none else but her\nfather. Her father, in Delvina(ph), in al \u2014 Albania where he still had his fabric store\nbecause wa \u2014 he was still a merchant, because the Jews of Albania, even though they\nwent into hiding, they were never deported, and so they all survived. And y \u2014 in fact, my\ngrandparents never left the city of Delvina(ph) and the Germans occupied their house\nbecause it was a nice house. So they were never \u2014 never disturbed by the Germans. And\nthere were other European Jews that had come to Albania to survive, but so \u2014 so the\nsmuggler gave the idea that it\u2019s possible to \u2014 to get fabrics from Albania. And in fact, she\ngot some fabrics from him and told him, when you go back to Albania, have my father\npay you for the fabrics, because we didn\u2019t have any money, either. My father had not\nbeen paid in cash yet. There was no cash to be found, everything was bartering. So this is\nhow my mother started becoming a merchant. And for her it was a lifesaving activity\n107\nSeptember 14, 2010\nbecause it brought her out of the house with \u2014 had to trans \u2014 transactions with the public.\nAnd I remember, she also smoked at that time, which was not common for women to\nsmoke. It was sort of \u2014 people looked down on this.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But it was her state, psychological state was such that she probably experienced some\nrelief smoking. So she found a shoemaker, not far from our house. And she noticed that\nthere were some empty shelves there, and she said, do you mind if I bring some fabric\nhere and I \u2014 I sell 1t to the customers? And she said no, it\u2019s okay. So this is where she\nstarted going into business, becoming a merchant. And of course for her, becoming \u2014\nbeing a merchant was second nature because she had learned all of this in her father\u2019s\nstore in Albania. This didn\u2019t last very long because the owner of the shoemaker\u2019s store,\nshe was \u2014 became angry when she discovered that he \u2014 he was subletting the store to\nsomebody else. And my mother didn\u2019t want to make a fuss, so she removed the fabrics\nand she opened a small store in another location. But she was very, very successful,\nbecause \u2014 because of the civil war, these village women were coming from the villages\nthat were being devastated, into the city. And they were too shy to go to a store run by a\nman. They were too shy to talk with a man and transact business with \u2014 with \u2014 with a\nman, so they would flock to my mother, who was \u2014 then started dyeing less expensive\nfabrics. The fabrics that she brought from Albania were silk and really high class fabrics,\nwhich the villagers could not afford to buy. So she started buying less expensive fabrics\n108\nSeptember 14, 2010\nand she started traveling by herself, which was quite daring for a woman at that time, to\nPatress(ph) another city, to buy supplies and sell them to the villagers. So she was very,\nvery successful.",
        "Q: So it was both a psychological move, and \u2014 and \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 a financial move as well, but that wasn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: \u2014 the major reason in the beginning.",
        "A: Yes, yes, but in talking with my mother in later years, she told me how \u2014 how\nimportant it was for her to \u2014 to \u2014 to do this. And my parents did not talk about \u2014 you\nknow, throughout this period, until \u2014 until the war ended in Europe, we maintained hope\nthat they were going to come back. We didn\u2019t know about the camps of extermination,\nthe Final Solution. All of this was totally unknown to us. And it was in the spring of 1945\nwhen survivors \u2014 survivors of concentration camps \u2014",
        "Q: Started coming down \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 started trickling into the \u2014 int \u2014 in Greece. And among them was my father\u2019s\nbrother, Mikhail(ph) or Michael Matsas. He had lost his wife Rebecca, and his son.\nAnd then there were first cousins; my cousin Nina, who still lives in Ioannina, who I\nsaw on my last trip. And then there was my cousin Eftyhia and Sandra. So these were th\n109September 14, 2010\n\u2014 just a handful of people, handful of relatives who \u2014 who came back, and they tried to\npiece their lives together. It was \u2014 1t was a horrible time.",
        "Q: When did you become conscious of what the \u2014 what was going on with these people,\nand what was going on in the world? How \u2014 how old were you, do you think?",
        "A: I-I think it was when \u2014 when these concentration camp survivors returned, I became\nconscious of concentration camps, not through the people themselves, because they never\ntalked about their experiences. They never talked. Even my cousin Nina, who I saw in\n2005, I \u2014 I had seen her many, many times before while I was living in Greece, but never\ndared ask a question, until on my last visit, two thou \u2014 in 2005, and that was the first time\nthat she talked about it to me. This is a whole lifetime \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 of silence. It was too horrible for them to talk about.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s stop the tape and \u2014\nEnd of Tape Eight\n110September 14, 2010\nBeginning Tape Nine",
        "Q: You were talking about your cousin Nina, who only in 2005, began to speak with you.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So, is your knowledge of the Holocaust not from personal exper \u2014 not from what\npeople have said to you?",
        "A: Exactly. Not from survivors, relatives or friends who had survived. It was from other\nsources, not from them. And when I was visiting Nina, I remember she \u2014 I stayed with\nher f-for a number of days, and every morning she would serve breakfast, and I wanted to\nask her \u2014 and every morning I\u2019d say no, maybe she \u2014 she doesn\u2019t want to talk about it.\nUntil at one point, I don\u2019t remember exactly how it came up, she said to me, you know, I\nwas interviewed by Steven Spielberg\u2019s project. And \u2014 and I said, you did? A-And \u2014 and\n\u2014 and I \u2014 and this was the first time that I realized that she had talked about it. This is in\nIoannina now, there used to be \u2014 there used to be two synagogues before the war. One\nwas demolished and the adjacent school, the Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle was torn\ndown, and they used that spot \u2014 land to build an apartment house for the Jews from\nIoannina who survived either by going up in the mountains, or concentration camp\nsurvivors. And they live in that apartment house on Josef Elijia Street. And that is the\nname of \u2014 of a Greek Jewish poet from Ioannina, they named the street after him. But\nthe \u2014 the horrible thing that I discovered on \u2014 after I made a tour of the \u2014 of the\nneighborhood where my aunt \u2014 my cousin pointed out all the houses of our relatives. This\nSeptember 14, 2010\nis where Aunt ri\u2014 Annetta(ph) and Aunt Eftyhia lived, and where my grandparents\nlived. When I returned to the apartment house, I saw this graffiti written in an\nungrammatical way, saying, you die at 17 and we bury you at 70. It was obviously an\nanti-Semitic graffiti on this building that houses the remnants of that thriving community.\nThis is a community that numbered 2,000 \u2014 almost 2,000 Jews. An ancient community\nthat had existed there for many, many centuries. And there are th \u2014 a handful of people\nwho live in this apartment house with painful memories, and they have to \u2014 to read this\nevery day. So I asked her, why don\u2019t you \u2014 why don\u2019t you hire somebody to erase it? And\nsaid, we do it, and \u2014 and they come back, and they come back. I-It was \u2014 so my \u2014 my\nknowledge of concentration camps was not from our relatives that survived, yes.",
        "Q: Did your parents and \u2014 and Mykas(ph) talk with \u2014 talk with you about what happened\nwhen \u2014 and they said when you were a little girl this happened, and that happened? I\nmean, is that where some of your memories come from? Or it is mainly from the\nmemoirs that they wrote?",
        "A: They always talked about our adventure in the mountains, always. And they didn\u2019t put\nit down on paper until they were in the United States already. And it was really, as my\nfather says in his memoirs, always the driving force behind us. Because by then my\nbrother had two daughters, and I had the daughter, and we realized that they had this\ntreasure of information that should be recorded. And so we both, ma \u2014 my brother\nMykas(ph) and I urged them to \u2014 to write down their memoirs. And I promised my father\nSeptember 14, 2010\nI was going to translate them, and I did. But my mother, I do remember the stories she\ncame back with after her first visit of Ioannina, when she went to visit her sisters\u2019 house,\nEftyhia and Annetta(ph), they were both married, and they had, each of them, two\ndaughters. And they \u2014 and she said that the neighbors \u2014 there was also a woman,\nStavrypoulo(ph) I believe, who occupied my aunts\u2019 house at the time, and she was a\nmistress of one of the German officers who lived in my aunt\u2019s house, Aunt Eftyhia\u2019s\nhouse. And my aunt \u2014 my uncle \u2014 Aunt Eftyhia\u2019s husband Naseem(ph) Samwheel(ph)\nwas a dentist, and they were well-off, they had a very pretty house, very comfortable.\nAnd so the German officer chose to \u2014 their \u2014 that house to live in. And my aunt would\nserve him meals every day. She was actually expecting a child, and yet she had to go up\nand down to serve him. And my mother learned this story when she came to Ioannina\nthat first visit after the war, that the \u2014 this German officer asked my aunt to bring more\nwine that na \u2014 particular night. And she said, tomorrow we don\u2019t know who lives and\nwho dies. And so she brought more wine, it was a very sumptuous meal that she had\nprepared. And it was the very next day, March 21% \u2014 25\" \u2014 March 25\", when they\nrounded up the Jews of Ioannina \u2014 of Ioannina. They had to be awakened very early in\nthe morning. It was an unusually cold day, it was actually snowing. And \u2014 and they\nknocked the door very early in the morning, 5:30 in the morning, people were still\nsleeping, and they told them, you have, you know, 60 minutes to pack and assemble in\nthe sert \u2014 in a square by the \u2014 by the lake, Pamvotis Lake, of Ioannina. And this is what\n113September 14, 2010\nthey did, and \u2014 and so my aunt \u2014 this 1s all totally unexpected, because up until that point,\nthings were relatively calm in the city, and so this was an unsuspecting Jewish population\nthat all of a sudden is rounded up. And so my aunt approached the \u2014 this German officer,\nand said, we too? You know, you lived with us, and I served you so many meals, we too?\nHe said, yes, you too. And my uncle was still shaving, and it was a very \u2014 a horrible situa\n\u2014a horrible scene that my mother described. And now in retrospect, when I think \u2014 when\nI think of it, it\u2019s very, very painful. Because I can \u2014 I can just picture now my\ngrandparents being awakened early in the morning, in their later years 1n their lives; small\nchildren, pregnant women, they had to \u2014 to pack. What \u2014 what could \u2014 they didn\u2019t know\nwhat to pack, what to bri \u2014 they didn\u2019t know where they were going. And when I bring\nthat scene in my mind, I \u2014 I can\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s so painful, so painful. And then my grandmother\nwas a very kind person. She was \u2014 she had many children and she was a self-trained\nmidwife. And she was a \u2014 and \u2014 and my grandfather had a lot of transactions with the\nvillagers, because he used to buy milk from them. So she would \u2014 so they had a lot of\npeople that they knew in the villages, and whenever a woman was expecting a child, they\nwould always ask my mother \u2014 my grandmother to come and help her deliver the baby.\nSo my grandmother would always go around the neighborhood collecting baby clothes\nand food for \u2014 for the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the mother, the young mother and the baby. And so\nshe was that kind of person. And why was she taken away\u201d? There was a \u2014 a book that\nsomeone wrote, I can\u2019t remember her name right now, about the Jewish community of\n114\nSeptember 14, 2010\nIoannina, and the deportation. And she interviewed survivors that were brought in in the\nsame \u2014 the same truck with my grandmother. No, actually the same \u2014 they were\ntransported by trucks from Ioannina to Larisa(ph), and from Larisa(ph) in boxcars to\nAuschwitz. And these women survived the concentration camps and they were\ninterviewed by the author of this book, and they happened to be riding in the same\nboxcar. And their \u2014 a relative of theirs was expecting a baby, and her mother-in-law was\nfrantic, because what are we going to do? How 1s the \u2014 the mother and the baby going to\nsurvive? And \u2014 and they quoted my grandmother, saying, d-don\u2019t worry, Ill deliver the\nbaby. I know all about babies, I\u2019ll take care of you. So I don\u2019t know whether she\ndelivered \u2014 whether she delivered the baby in the boxcar, or when they arrived in the\nconcentration camp. But I do know that they were among the first people to \u2014 to go to the\ngas chambers, because they \u2014 they had \u2014 they \u2014 they took the elderly and the very young\nto the gas chambers. And so that was the end of these wonderful people. It\u2019s something\n[indecipherable] my brother and I live with this \u2014 this pain all our lives. And it\u2019s just \u2014\nthere\u2019s no \u2014 there\u2019s just no answer, there\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s no answer, and \u2014 and what makes it\nso painful for \u2014 for us 1s that there was a possibility they could have been s \u2014 they could\nhave survived, they could have \u2014 it was late enough in the war. The countryside was free.\nThe partisans were there. They could ha \u2014 Greece is a mountainous country, they could\nhave left, they could have survived. And it didn\u2019t happen. It \u2014 it\u2019s a\u2014 we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll just\nnever \u2014 we\u2019ll never rest. I-It\u2019s a pain we\u2019ll never \u2014 always carry with us. When I went to\n115\nSeptember 14, 2010\nIoannina in 2005, I went to the synagogue, the only remaining synagogue inside the \u2014\nthe walls, the castle, th-the frourio, as they call it, that\u2019s still standing there, and it was\nrenovated thanks to the generosity of American women o-of that background. And the\nwalls are lined with marble plaques on which the names of all the victims, all the people\nwho were deported, on marble plaques with the day of \u2014 the date of their birth \u2014 the\nnames and the date of their birth. And th-the entire synagogue interior is \u2014 1s covered\nwith these plaques. It was my Uncle Mikhail(ph) that the \u2014 a younger brother of my\nfather, wa \u2014 he\u2019s a survivor of the concentration camp, he\u2019s the one who collected all the\ninformation; the names, the occupations, date of births of all the people who perished,\nand then they etched their names in marble an-and \u2014 and there is a \u2014 it\u2019s a\u2014a good\nmonument, you know, a way to remember them. But it 1s \u2014 it is so painful to think \u2014\nwhen I was in that synagogue, I \u2014 I had already learned a lot about the history of \u2014 of the\ncommunity, and how rich their lives were, rich in \u2014 in long traditions, they \u2014 these\nunchanged traditions for hundreds of years. And it all perished overnight, literally\novernight. So with \u2014 with my aunt \u2014 with my cousin Nina, when we were in the\nsynagogue, and Mr. Samwheel(ph), who joined the partisans during the war, and this is\nhow he survived, he joined them as a young man. Now, when I visited he was an elderly\nperson. But he \u2014 he had a beautiful voice, and he knew how to play a musical instrument.\nAnd he took it upon himself to \u2014 to learn the liturgy, because he\u2019s the one who condu \u2014\nconducts services in the synagogue, only very few times, on like Yom Kippur. That is\n116\nSeptember 14, 2010\nwhen relatives and friends from other cities in Greece, they come to the synagogue. And\nso \u2014 so he \u2014 he chants the liturgy. And while we were there, the three of us; my cousin\nNina, a survivor of Auschwitz; he, a partisan; and I, we recited Kaddish. And it was the\nmost memorable moment of my life. And when I looked at the wall, there were the names\nof our relatives, and \u2014 and cousins that were my age when they were taken. And I s-sort\nof \u2014I\u2014I-\u2014TI appreciate life. I\u2019m very conscious that I was \u2014 I was just very, very, very\nlucky to survive. So I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m one of the very few \u2014 among the very few Greek Jewish\nsurvivors. And \u2014 and now I\u2019m \u2014 we\u2019re \u2014 I\u2019m eternally grateful to whoever ever helped us\nto survive those terrible years. And there were many people with small acts of \u2014 of \u2014 just\na kind word here and there, or giving us a sip of water up in Kamaria, or \u2014 or the\nblanket, 1n spite of the lice, they \u2014 they shared everything they had, and I am \u2014 we\u2019re the\n\u2014 eternally grateful t-to them an-and to the place of Psilovrahos. Psilovrahos is a very\nspecial, special, very special place for me. I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Q: No, don\u2019t apologize. When I think about what you\u2019re saying and what you\u2019re feeling\nis, you \u2014 you don\u2019t cry from your own experience, you cry because other people didn\u2019t\nsurvive. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s different.",
        "A: Yes. That is \u2014",
        "Q: Because your experience is \u2014 was not horrible for you \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: \u2014 in a certain way.\n117\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: No, not at all, 1t was \u2014 it is the loss that is so painful, the loss, and \u2014 and knowing that\n\u2014 that there\u2019s nothing you can do, and \u2014 and it isn\u2019t, you know, th \u2014 you know, people\nthink that, you know, da \u2014 time will \u2014 will \u2014 will heal the wound, and that is not so. Not\nfor me.",
        "Q: You think about this all the time, don\u2019t you?",
        "A: Yes, I do. And \u2014 a-and it\u2019s such an enormous loss. And a-as \u2014 as I advance in years,\nall I can do, I feel, is talk \u2014 talk about it so that people will remember them. They will\nhave a memory of their names, at least, they existed. They were kind people. So when my\nAunt Rebecca, who was my father\u2019s youngest sister, and she and her family survived in\nEgypt, see, because they lived in Alexandria during the war, then after the\n[indecipherable] took over, and they had to \u2014 to leave Egypt, they came to Paris. Well,\nshe came to visit us about maybe 10 years ago. And she had left Ioannina when she was\n17 years old. She got married to my Uncle Laylee(ph), and then they moved to \u2014 to\nAlexandria, Egypt. So she would come back to visit her family. So she retained that\nperiod of \u2014 of \u2014 of the family as though it was encased in amber. I always thought of that,\nthat \u2014 that 1t was like time stood still for her for that period. And so she would \u2014 she had\nso many stories to tell about my father\u2019s brothers and sister, about their wives, their \u2014\ntheir families, all of their \u2014 their lives. And she was a very articulate person and she loved\nto talk and I spent a lot of time with her. And then one day I realized, she 1s a treasure\ntrove of information. And so I asked her if she would be willing for me to interview her\n118\nSeptember 14, 2010\nusing the family album. And even though it was \u2014 I know it was painful for her to talk\nabout her brothers and their families and her sister that perished, an-and her parents, she \u2014\nshe let me interview her. I was not a professional interviewer, of course, but I \u2014 I really\ntreasure the information that she gave me, because for a brief period of time, she brought\nthese people to life. And they were \u2014 they had their own achievements in life, their own\ndisappointments and \u2014 and while in life perhaps they were ordinary people, having\nperished the way they did, they became extraordinary.",
        "Q: Well, I know there\u2019s much more to say, because your \u2014 your life went on for many\nyears.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But I think we have to end now, and I just want to thank you.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: I\u2019m very grateful to you for being willing to talk with us.",
        "A: Thank you for giving me the opportunity.",
        "Q: Well, it\u2019s been wonderful. Thank you so much.",
        "A: Thank you.",

        "A: This picture was taken in \u2014 on my first visit to Psilovrahos in 1991, and that\u2019s me\nsitting in front of the door, the entrance to the room where we spent a year in\nPsilovrahos. And then over on the left, and \u2014 on the left of that same picture.",

And this is the interior of the room.\nYou can see the narrow window, and \u2014 and the fireplace that was used. It\u2019s a little bit\n123September 14, 2010\ncovered with a cloth, but is a source of heat and cooking for us. And this is where my\nfather mounted the \u2014 this contraption with the \u2014 the rubber strips, that we were burning\nfor lighting.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And \u2014 and the \u2014 the contraption is still there. Things don\u2019t change \u2014",

        "Q: And that\u2019s the same house that we saw \u2014",
        "A: That is the very same house, yes, that we saw earlier. This is a fountain in Houni. This\nis the village where the taxi brought us, and is a fountain constructed by Italian soldiers at\nsome point during the occupation.",
        "Q: And this shot?",
        "A: This is taken in Ioannina, and it is the \u2014 called the frourio, it\u2019s sort of reinforced\nwalls of the original city of Ioannina. And this is where, in these thick walls \u2014 these thick\nwalls were used as a shelter during the air raids by \u2014 by the Italians during the Greek-\n124\nSeptember 14, 2010\nItalian war. And the Jews \u2014 the synagogue that still survives is inside the frourio. Behind\nthese walls is the synagogue.",
        "Q: And the top picture?",
        "A: These two pictures depict the same building. They\u2019re taking in Agrinion. They are the\ntobacco warehouses, Papapetrou tobacco warehouses. This is where the Jews of Arta\nand Preveza were taken before they boarded the trains to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: And this photograph?",
        "A: This 1s the first photograph my parents took of themselves in \u2014 they actually went to a\nphoto studio, soon as they returned from Psilovrahos, the very first day they arrived,\nafter the liberation.",
        "Q: That\u2019s when they were looking for an apartment, right?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: A house.",
        "A: A house, yes.",
        "Q: And what is this document?",
        "A: This is an I.D., my father\u2019s I.D., that was issued by German authorities. In the village,\nmy parents obtained baptismal papers from, I guess the priest, and they sent these\ndocuments to Agrinion and they were issued the I.D. cards by the German authorities.\nThe names have been changed to sound more like Greek Christian names. Names of my\ngrandparents are mentioned there, and \u2014 and my parents\u2019 names are mentioned but they\n125September 14, 2010\nhave all been changed to sound more Christian Greek. The interesting thing about these\nI.D.s is that there\u2019s no mention of religion, which is quite interesting.",
        "Q: And who 1s this good-looking group here?",
        "A: This is my family. This is a post-war picture, depicting my brother on \u2014 Mykas(ph),\nor Mike on the left, my mother, my father and me. I\u2019m \u2014 we don\u2019t have very much\nmoney to buy good clothes, but somehow we managed to look presentable. But I do wear\na pair of shoes that I borrowed from my friend Ephemia(ph), from the\nPapatheordoro(ph) family. And of course I have my huge bow perched on my head. It\nwas \u2014 it was the latest in fashion for little girls.",
        "Q: Do you remember what year this was?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know the exact year, but I believe that it was perhaps \u201946 \u2014 \u00b046 or \u201947, I\u2019m not\nsure.",
        "Q: And what does this represent?",
        "A: These are two fragments of stalactites from the \u2014 the cave of Arapo(ph) Kefalas(ph),\nwhere we had to hi \u2014",
        "Q: And where was that?",
        "A: This was in \u2014 in Psilovrahos. And the date is November fifth, 1s 1t? That was probably\nthe day \u2014 1943. That was probably the day that we were in that cave.\nEnd of Tape 10\nConclusion of Interview\n"

So I remember him with his spoonful of fruit preserves, is like st \u2014 not strawberry,\npreserves like some other kinds of fruit, waiting for me to open my eyes and put this\nteaspoon full of \u2014 of jam, so that I wouldn\u2019t cry. I remember that very vividly. And we\nhave a thing, I remember where my brother was making dolls for me, massive\nproduction.

So he didn\u2019t really know how to use\na rifle \u2014 basic, he never had basic training. And so he was forever not \u2014 he was not able to\nkeep up with the others \u2014 Greek soldiers. He was separated from his company several\ntimes. He had to deal with a mule that was not very cooperative. So, going to the front\nand returning, he was \u2014 was a struggle for him. So he was among the last soldiers to\nreturn, and so my \u2014 I \u2014I heard my mother and brother saying how they would go out to\nthe main street every morning, every day, waiting for my father to show up. It was a very\nanxious time for them. So, after he returned, we \u2014 we, the whole family returned to\nAgrinion. This is \u2014 this is the time when German and Italian troops began pouring into\nthe \u2014 the country. A-And Germans actually first came to \u2014 to Ioannina, but then later on,\nas we will discuss, later on the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the occupation zones were determined and\nthe Germans occupied the northern part of Greece, and the Bulgarians another section.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Small section \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 in the north, while the rest of the country was 1\u2014 occupied by the Italians, with the\nexception of half \u2014 half of Crete and some major islands in the Aegean. So \u2014 so we \u2014 we\nreturned to \u2014 to Agrinion after my father was discharged.",
        "A: I was \u2014",

First he was transferred to Arta and then \u2014 then to Preveza, and\nfrom Preveza to Agrinion. So when we came to Agrinion, I was two years old, but I\u2014 I\nwas born in Arta. And I often think of how chance events determined, at that time at\nleast, your \u2014 whether you were going to live or die, because had my father not been\ntransferred to Agrinion, if he had stayed in Ioannina, or Arta, or Preveza, the chances\nof our survival would have been very ni \u2014 much diminished.",

        "A: Yes, yes, dairy products. He made yogurt and cheese, and wine. And several of his\nsons worked in the business. And my father actually, when he became \u2014 finished high\nschool, he thought of going into the same business, but on a more sophisticated level, so\nhe decided to go to Athens and study in the school of agriculture in Athens, of the\nproduction of dairy products. But unfortunately the \u2014 the war caused the \u2014 the university\nto close, and he abandoned those studies, and he passed the entrance exam for the\nNational Bank of Greece, which was a \u2014 a rather prestigious job fo-for Greece. So he \u2014\nthis is \u2014 he started his career as a bank employee in \u2014 in Ioannina.",

        "A: Sh\u2014 my mother, no, she did not have a job, she \u2014 she was a housewife, like most\nGreek women of that middle class were. But she was a very \u2014 very dynamic person, and\nshe took great pride in the fact that, growing up in Albania \u2014 because my mother was\nborn in Albania \u2014 her parents moved to Albania from Ioannina, because there were\nbetter economic opportunities there. And she took great pride in the fact that she was \u2014\nshe worked in my father\u2019s fabric store, and she loved dealing with \u2014 with \u2014 with the\ncustomers, and they liked her. The customers liked her. And my grandfather would\nalways say, oh Esther \u2014 that\u2019s my mother\u2019s name \u2014 Esther is my right hand. So she was\na business minded woman, but she never, during that period, didn\u2019t have the opportunity\nto \u2014 or it was \u2014 1t was unusual for women to \u2014 to go into business at that time. As my \u2014\nmy father was born in Ioannina, and he attended the \u2014 a school that\u2019s called Alliance\nIsra\u00e9lite Universelle. These were schools that were established by the Rothschild\nfamily, th-the \u2014 the branch of France, to raise the educational level of the Jews of that\narea. So there were several of these schools established, and they were really excellent\nSeptember 14, 2010\nschools, where the children were taught Hebrew, French and Greek. And when you \u2014\nwhen you were graduated from this school, I think it ended up to the \u2014 went up to the\nsixth or seventh grade, you really had mastered French, because all the subjects were\ntaught in French, including history. Then, of course, Hebrew; the biblical Hebrew, and\nsome modern, conversational Hebrew, and of course, Greek. And then my father went to\nthe Greek high school, and he was fluent in \u2014 in Greek, of course. And [indecipherable]\nmy mother, she grew up in Albania where the, I think at the time, the illiteracy level was\nvery, very high. But her \u2014 her brother was well educated. He had gone to a private school\nsince he studied in Italy as well. And education was very important, so they send them to\na private school in Albania, in Delvina. But unfortunately there were some anti-Semitic\ncomments made that made my mother and her sister Eftyhia very uncomfortable. And so\ntheir parents send them to Corfu. In Corfu there was a school run by French nuns, and it\nwas an excellent \u2014 it was a boarding school, only the rich girls could go there, it was a\ngirls\u2019 school. And there she studied French. She was a very smart woman, and she\nentered the school know \u2014 not knowing a word of French, and within two years she b \u2014\nshe became fluent. So that was her education, took place in \u2014 in Corfu. So \u2014",

And so my father comes in, and he takes us all inside, and he said, I\njust spoke with Yonas Mionis and he told us that the Jews of Athens have gone into\nhiding and that all the Jewish families in Agrinion, they\u2019re considering \u2014 no-not\neverybody had decided yet, but they\u2019re considering leaving the city.

        "A: Well, of course, you know, later on, as adults, we found out why the Jews of Athens\nhad gone into hiding. The reason was, you know, when the Germans occupied Athens,\nthey asked the chief rabbi of Athens, Barzilai, to supply them with names and addresses\nof all the families \u2014 of the Jewish families of Athens, and they gave him three days to do\nthat. And it\u2019s not very clear exactly what happened, but the Greek resistance that had\ngone \u2014 grown pretty strong by then in \u2014 in the cities, and they decided to \u2014 to help the\nrabbi leave the city, sort of almost abduction, and Baruch Shidis(ph), we learned later on\nwas a Jewish journalist, he was instrumental in arranging for this, the removal of the\nrabbi from the city, so to prevent him from providing the lists, and also give a message to\nthe Jews of Athens that they\u2019re in danger. Because as soon as he \u2014 the word got around\nthat he was \u2014 he ha \u2014 had left the city with his wife and daughter, they took him to the\nmainland, to the mountains in central Greece. Then the Jews of Athens either left the\ncity, went into the mountains, or hid in the \u2014 within the city. So the word got around that\nthe Jews of Athens had gone into hiding, and that was the message that Yonas brought\nfrom a merchant that had just returned from Athens; he had the information.\nSeptember 14, 2010",

People in \u2014 in Athens were starving to death, but we had\nplenty of food, because we had brought a lot of food from these surrounding villages, and\nthey were stored in the house.

I don\u2019t know where it is now, if it \u2014 IT \u2014I-1t\nwas misplaced, I lost it. But it was the most beautiful doll. And it was sort of a \u2014 I never\nquestioned at that time, you know, why he brought me the doll, because I didn\u2019t know\nthat he was the enemy, he was the occupying force \u2014 represented the occupying force.\nBut it was a very \u2014 have a very nice, fond memory of that \u2014 of that man.\nSeptember 14, 2010",

Although, in 1942, the Italian authorities requested that all\nthe Jewish families register with them. But we never thought that anything bad was going\nto happen. And so \u2014 and so my father later on, he tried to explain to me why this Italian\nofficer, soldier, brought me a doll, and he said maybe you remind him of his daughter,\nmaybe he wants to show that underneath his uniform, he is really a human being. And\nyou know, my parents, they both spoke Italian. At some point in their lives, they learned\nItalian in their youth.

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right. Yes, we were not \u2014",
        "A: Yes, right, that\u2019s true.",
        "A: Yes. So we \u2014 we didn\u2019t know where to go \u2014 coming back to the story. And at that time\nthere were two resistance movement in Greece. One was based in the countryside in\nEpirus, near Ioannina, the outskirts of Ioannina. EDES was headed by Napoleon\nSeptember 14, 2010\nZervas, and they were known as the \u2014 but, at that time, the country was polarized\nbetween the \u2014 the nationalists, the right wing people, and the leftists. And so the\nresistance movements were also polarized. You have EDES, headed by Napoleon\nZervas in Epirus, and then EAM-ELAS, much larger, very well organized resistance\nmovement in the countryside of Greece, but also within the cities of \u2014 of Greece. And so\nwe had neighbors, friends, who advised us to go to EDES, and other friends who advised\nus to go to a territory controlled by EAM-ELAS. So we had some very close family\nfriends, the Bokoros family; there were three brothers and two sisters, actually three\nsisters. There was Christos and Thermas(ph) Bokoros, and we knew them, we became\nfam \u2014 we became family friends because their sister Elestair(ph) was married to a man\nwho was a colleague of my father\u2019s in \u2014 in the bank. I think we met \u2014 they met them\neither in Preveza or Arta, I don\u2019t know. And unfortunately her husband, Elestair\u2019s\nhusband died, and the whole family moved to Agrinion and they lived \u2014 and so she and\nher children lived with her brothers, Christos and Thermas(ph) and Kostas Bokoros.\nSo, we decided to ask them for help, and they were wonderful people, they did everything\nthey could to assure us that we\u2019ll find you a place, we\u2019ll get you out of the city. And so\nafter we distributed our belongings to the neighbors, my mother, my brother and I, we \u2014\nwe sent some of the material, clothing and food and household utensils, with a porter to\ntransport these things to the Bokoros\u2019 house, and then we, the three of us, my mother, my\nbrother and I followed behind. My father went to work that day, he had to \u2014 they received\nSeptember 14, 2010\na very large amount of money, and he was replacing the \u2014 the cashier, so he had to go\nthere and to count the money. And so we reached the Bokoro \u2014 Bokoros\u2019 house, and a\nfew minutes later \u2014 I remember this very vividly, I know this is a firsthand recollection. I\nremember a German bursting into the house and \u2014 and then my mother, you know, she\nsaw this \u2014 she saw him, and she quickly pushed him in \u2014 pushed me into the adjacent\nroom and she quickly pulled the covers off the bed, and pretended to calmly make the\nbed, as though she belonged there. She\u2019s a very quick thinker, sh \u2014 amazing person. So\nth-the \u2014 the German sort of looked around. I don\u2019t \u2014 we don\u2019t know what \u2014 who he was\nlooking for, and then he left. But 1t was a very frightening experience for \u2014 for \u2014 for all \u2014\nfor my mother and \u2014 and my brother. I don\u2019t remember where my brother was at this\npoint. All I remember was my mother making the bed at this point. And she asked\nChristos, one of the Bokoros brothers to quickly go to the bank and tell my father to \u2014 to\ndrop everything and come to the house, we had to leave immediately. So Christos goes\nto the bank, and told my father that \u2014 does he have \u2014 even though you haven\u2019t finished\ncounting the money, you have to drop everything and leave. An-And certainly the people\nin the bank were very cooperative. They signed everything as though they had cou \u2014 as\nthe mon \u2014 as though the money had been counted and everything, or the transaction was\nvery orderly. And so my father comes to the Bokoros house. And then, where there\u2019s\nanother problem they confront is the lack of transportation. The Germans had\nrequisitioned all means of transportation; trucks, taxis, mules, horses. And so the brothers\nSeptember 14, 2010\ncouldn\u2019t find a way for us to leave that day, which was October second. And so we spent\nthe night in their house, and the following day they came with a taxi. They found a taxi\nthat was going to Kremasta. This was a spa near the river Acheloos river, nearby. Was\nso-some distance, few kilometers outside Agrinion. And he had \u2014 the taxi driver had\nother passengers to transport to the \u2014 the the Acheloos spa. And so this is we \u2014 we got in\nthe tax1 with some blankets, and you know, some household ma \u2014 equipment, materials\nthat we brought with us, and so we left the city. I remember that, I remember how my\nmother said we should crouch into the \u2014 the taxi, not to draw attention to ourselves,\nbecause people did not use taxis then to \u2014 to \u2014 to move around, we didn\u2019t want to \u2014 to\ndraw attention to ourselves. And then as soon as we \u2014 we came to the outskirts of the city\nof Agrinion, we had to pass through a German checkpoint. And the driver, who\napparently did this route quite often, he knew how to deal with the German guards there,\nand he gave them some raisins and cigarettes, and they let us pass. And then \u2014",
        "A: Without checking, yes. It was \u2014 was actually, you know, we \u2014 we learned much later\nthat at that point, it was easy to go in and out of the cities, th-they were not checking. But\nthen \u2014 a-and then a few kilometers later, we encountered another checkpoint that was not\nGerman, those were the resistance fighters. These were the EAM-ELAS members. And\nthen, you know, we reassured that we were in safe ground.\nSeptember 14, 2010",

That was the dream of his life,\nhe \u2014 to this \u2014 to this day, he wished he had had \u2014 had had the opportunity to b \u2014 to be a\nmember of ELAS. There was a \u2014 a youth division of the resistance called EPON, e-p-o-\nn.",
        "A: And they were \u2014 these were mostly young men and women. They were 15 - 16 years\nold. They were \u2014 they were doing very valuable services, carrying out very valuable\nservices for the resistance. They were used as runners, to \u2014 to carry messages for\ncommunication purposes. They would paint slogans in the cities at night, to lift up the\nspirits of the citizens. And then in the villages, where people didn\u2019t have radios, they\nwould call out or read the news of the day, using a megaphone, like it was taken probably\nfrom gramophones, and \u2014 like a bullhorn, carry \u2014 you know, shouting the news, or if \u2014 if\nthere was th \u2014 if the s \u2014 the village had to be evacuated, they would \u2014 they would carry\nout this service, very valuable. But no, my \u2014 my brother never had the opportunity.",
        "A: No, for me it was wonderful, because riding in a taxi was a unique experience. People\ndid not ride buses and taxis in \u2014 in \u2014\nSeptember 14, 2010",

And this is another thing that I remember, and it\u2019s\na firsthand recollection, this very beautiful fountain that consisted of heads made out of\nkind of \u2014 some kind of ceramic material, and the water was spouting out of these heads. I\ndon\u2019t know, maybe there were seven or eight heads in a row. And e \u2014 thou \u2014 that \u2014 this\nwas a fountain that was also built by Italians. But this is as far as the taxi went, then he\nSeptember 14, 2010\nhad \u2014 he \u2014 he transported his passengers to the \u2014 the spa. And at that point, the driver, the\ntaxi driver found a \u2014 a mule driver to transport us to a village. Now, I don\u2019t know who\nmade the decision that Psilovrahos was the village where we should be taken. I don\u2019t\nknow whether it was the taxi driver recommended it, or \u2014 or the mule driver thought that\nthis would be \u2014 but he \u2014 but the \u2014 the information that was conveyed to the mule driver\nwas that it had to be a place that was off the beaten track, a remote village, and so the\nmule driver brought two mules and a donkey to transport us to the \u2014 the village.",
        "A: I-I-",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t even know whether the Bokoros brothers had told the taxi\ndriver th-th-this is the final destination. I \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019m not clear on that.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Not exactly.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: My \u2014 the mule driver and my father, they load all our belongings onto these mules.\nAnd we carry these rugs, they\u2019re used as blankets, they\u2019re called flokati. Flokati. It\u2019s\ntufted blanket. Very heavy. Very heavy. I think the United States, they use it as a rug, a\nvery elegant rug by the fireplace, but it \u2014 it has these tufts, very long ones. And it\u2019s made\nof wool, very heavy, and so they load all our belongings on these two mules, and they\ncover the mule with this tufted blankets, and they create sort of like a nest for me. And\nthey lifted me up and they place me on the mule in this \u2014 in this little nest that they\ncreated. And then my mother was riding the other mule, and my brother rode the donkey\nfor a little while, and my father on foot. So that was the scene. And there we are,\nfollowing this path that is \u2014 it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a path that only animals and people can walk on.\nIt\u2019s very rocky, I remember. And I remember a very \u2014 the rhythmic sound of a creek that\nwas flowing along this path. That I remember. This is probably why I love mountains,\nbecause of \u2014 of my experience in the mountains during this period of my life. I don\u2019t like\nthe sea very much, but I love the mountains, yes.",

        "A: Oh, well, first of all, the creek that was flowing along the path. The sounds \u2014 th-the\nsounds that I remember the most are when we were approaching the village, there were\nsounds of sheep braying, goats, the \u2014 the bells of \u2014 of the goats. They \u2014 goats always had\nbells so the villagers can locate them, you know, if they strayed away. And roosters\ncrowing. Those are the sou \u2014 th-the \u2014 the \u2014 the sounds of the village.",
        "A: Yeah, de-definitely the donkeys. The donkeys do, definitely very loud, very\ncharacteristic loud sound they make. And I remember my mother turning around and\ntelling my father, when we were approaching the village, we didn\u2019t get tired Leon, did\nwe? She was sitting on the mule and my poor father was perspiring and \u2014 and really\nhaving a hard time climbing the \u2014 this \u2014 this is a very steep mountain we were climbing,\nvery steep.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, Iam.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Well, when we came into the village, there were villagers that came out, because this\nis a very small, small village in a very remote location. Not many things happen in the\ncourse of a day, and th-they \u2014 they were curious to see who are these people who just\narrived. We looked, obviously, city people, the way we were dressed, and so they were\nvery curious to \u2014 to see what was going on.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether my parents told the villagers that we were Jewish, but it was\nknown, it was known that we were Jewish. But we were trying not to act \u2014 you know,\nbehave differently than \u2014 than the j \u2014 than the villagers. We were trying not to draw\nattention to ourselves, to the point that we even went to church, to give them the\nimpression that, you know, we are like you, except that we don\u2019t make the sign of the\ncross. But my parents knew that \u2014 that as long as EAM-ELAS 1s in control of that region,\nwe were safe from spies. Because even if a villager had \u2014 got in his mind the notion of\nbetraying us, he would be afraid of retaliations by the \u2014 punishment by the resistance.",
        "A: So we tried to sort of keep a \u2014 a low profile and not look different or act different.",
        "A: Oh, yes.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Yes, I-",
        "A: Yes, it was \u2014 it was a wa \u2014 the village kids were \u2014 village kids all \u2014 all around us\nbecause \u2014 and \u2014 and it \u2014 became friends with them because my father enrolled me, after\nwe settled down, enrolled me in the \u2014 the one room schoolhouse of the school. And I\nthink it had maybe four classes, four second, third, fourth grades, but it was mostly the\nyounger children that came to school. The older ones were taken away by their parents to\nhelp out with \u2014 with the \u2014 the farms, or to learn a trade. So the \u2014 the educational level of\nthe villagers was very, very low. Was an extremely poor village, with few exceptions.\nThere were a few rich families.",
        "A: Yes, I remember that very well.",
        "A: Well, I remember \u2014 first of all, the school was a \u2014 was just a plain building that had a\nfew desks, where the \u2014 the desk and the seat were attached. I think they were desks like\nthe ones that were used 1n colonial times in the United States. We had \u2014",
        "A: And they had them. Okay, so I should \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes, right, it was attached, yes.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: And you would sit like three children, one next to the \u2014 the other. And the \u2014 the\nteacher was Mr. Alexandras(ph) Hemandritis(ph). And I remember him very well, he\nwas a very nice person. When my father brought me to the school the first day, they \u2014\nyou know, they didn\u2019t have books, they didn\u2019t have paper, it was \u2014 we \u2014 we had slates.\nYou prob \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you used slates also?",
        "A: Slates.",
        "A: You know what slates are?",
        "A: And he didn\u2019t have enough books for all the children, so he told my father that he\nwouldn\u2019t have a book for me, but \u2014 but my brother could \u2014 could make one, he would just\ncopy one of the books that was used \u2014 that were used in the class. There was a fireplace\nfor heat, and in fact, every day we had to bring a piece of wood, all the children had the\npiece \u2014 piece of wood for the \u2014 the fireplace. And I was rather uncomfortable at the\nbeginning, because of two reasons. One was I looked different than the village children. I\n\u2014 you know, my mother fussed over me a lot, I had very pretty clothes, and a huge bow\non my hair; that was the style, and curls like \u2014 my mother would say like Shirley\nTemple. And so I \u2014 I drew their attention from my appearance alone. The worst thing for\nSeptember 14, 2010\nme was that the day would start with the Lord\u2019s Prayer, Pater Hemon. And this is a\nChristian prayer, which after I analyzed it as an adult, you know, is very acceptable\nprayer, could say universal prayer. However, it had to be \u2014 was followed by the sign of\nthe cross, and I did not make the sign of the cross. I\u2014 I did not know much about Jewish\nreligion at that point. I knew that I was Jewish, I knew we celebrated Passover, and I\nknew that on Yom Kippur, we fasted. But other than that, I didn\u2019t know anything.\nHowever, I knew a lot about the Christian religion, because I was growing up in a\nChristian environment, and \u2014 and \u2014 and of course I knew about the \u2014 the accusation of the\nJews being responsible for the crucifixion and \u2014",
        "A: I knew that \u2014 I knew that \u2014 that \u2014 that there was something \u2014 not \u2014 not specifically. I di\n\u2014 perhaps it\u2019s \u2014 maybe I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m adding information that I acquired later on. But all I\nknew was that we did not make the sign of the cross, and so I did not. And I remember,\nyou know, the children turning around and looking at me. I was not making the sign of\nthe cross, and I didn\u2019t know what to do with my hands. I put them behind me, in my\npockets. I just had no \u2014 I felt extremely uncomfortable. And \u2014 and then of course, during\nrecess they \u2014 they asked me a lot of questions, you know, why didn\u2019t you make the sign\nof the cross? And I s \u2014 I did \u2014 just don\u2019t make it. A-And I didn\u2019t know how to answer the\nquestions. I was not prepared for this and I guess my parents never thought of I was going\nto experience this, and \u2014 and didn\u2019t prepare me.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Yes, when I went home after the first day, I told my mother that I wanted to have\nbraids, because all the girls \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 had braids. I didn\u2019t want to have curls. And she protested, she said, but they\u2019re so\nbeautiful, like Shirley Temple. No braids, and no bow. I had a huge bow sitting on top of\nmy head. These children had very little, very little. Many of these children were barefoot,\nor they wore pigskin sandals, made out of a piece of a pigskin, and you know, rope to \u2014 to\ntie it to their feet. And I had shiny shoes, and pretty clothes and a bow and curls. All of\nthat had to go, I told my mother and sister, because I \u2014 children don\u2019t want to be\ndifferent.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It was uncomfortable, uncomfortable that I \u2014 I made friends easily and they accepted\nme no matter what I looked or how I acted. An-And I made friends, I \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 I never felt\nlonely, you know. There were times when I did, when I did, later on. And I used to go up\nin the \u2014 the fields, you know, my \u2014 our house was \u2014 our house was a very primitive\nlooking house. It was really \u2014 consisted of one room with a fireplace and an\n[indecipherable] window, and a table and \u2014 and chairs. There were no beds. I mean,\nSeptember 14, 2010\nwhen we arrived, my parents had to immediately buy wood sawhorses and boards to\nmake beds, two beds; one for my mother and me, and one for my father and my brother.\nAnd then of course, they had to purchase food supplies. This was the harvest time, this 1s\nOctober and there are dry figs and walnuts and corn, lentils, beans, dry beans and my\nparents immediately bought food supplies.",
        "A: Yes. Th-There were two sources of \u2014 of sa \u2014 food supplies. One was we \u2014 my parents\nhad, as I said earlier, they had stored a lot of food in the \u2014 the bank. And so they send a\nman with a horse to bring food supplies from \u2014 from ours \u2014 our supplies in storage in the\nbank. And the other food supplies were from the villagers. There were some that were\nvery affluent and they would \u2014 would sell in large quantities. And so my parents stuffed a\nlot of stacks of these food supplies and arranged them up against the wall, and it formed\nsort of a sofa. And so we had a place to sit and we had the table and chairs and beds to\nsleep on. But that was all. There was no running water, no electricity, no bathroom. But\nmy father was a very resource \u2014 resourceful person, he \u2014 he said just \u2014 just let\u2019s pretend\nwe are living 1n primitive times, before electricity was invented, and we just have to \u2014 to\nlearn from the villagers how they live, and we\u2019ll do the same.",
        "A: The \u2014 the first place we lived in, you know, when we arrived, and there were villagers\nthat approached to see what was going on, one of them stepped forward and said, oh, I\nSeptember 14, 2010\nhave a room, and they \u2014 and they rented \u2014 we rented a room. The \u2014 one thing that my\nmother had brought, she insisted that we bring to the village was soap and sugar, because\nthe \u2014 the Greek money had lost its value because of inflation that the Germans had\nprinted a lot of money, and the ger \u2014 the Greek drachma had lost its value, so people\nconducted these transactions with goods, with bartering that was going on. So soap and\nsugar was a very desirable, important commodity, and we had brought a lot of that, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, she was a very smart person, very smart.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Well, we stayed in \u2014 you see, after we \u2014 we \u2014 we purchased food, and we also \u2014 we\ngot a goat. Now, I\u2019m not sure whether we got a goat at this point, or later on, I\u2019m not\nsure. But I remember that for me, getting a goat was the dream of my life. It was a goat of\nmy own, and the \u2014 and it was really a \u2014 in order for us to have a source of milk. And th-\nthe goat spent most of the time with the Tsulamitsu(ph) family, they were very nice,\nvery hospitable, kind, generous people. And they spent the time there, they would milk\nthe goat and bring the milk for us to drink. But we also, you know, I spent a lot of time\nwith \u2014 with the goat, I \u2014 I really became very attached to her. So after we \u2014 we acquired\nall these food supplies, we felt very comfortable in the village. It felt like a vacation. I\nSeptember 14, 2010\nwas going to school, my brother had brought his high school books, and my father said,\nyou should start studying. And my father had brought a book of English method \u2014 how \u2014\na method to learn English without a teacher. I remember that book. My brother has it \u2014\nstill has it. And \u2014 and of course my mother didn\u2019t need any \u2014 any additional work. She\nreally had to work very hard because there was \u2014 she had to do the laundry and the\ncooking and all the washing of the dishes, without \u2014 without a stove, without running\nwater. It was a real hardship for her. And so we didn\u2019t felt comfortable at that point, and\nmy father started writing letters to our rel-relatives in Ioannina, urging them to leave the\ncity and \u2014 and go to the mountains. And we used friends t-to \u2014 to transport these letters\nfrom \u2014 from the village of Psilovrahos to a colleague of my father\u2019s, Evyanea(ph)\nPapadapoulou(ph) I believe was her name. And she would in turn send the letters to her\nsister or brother in Ioannina, and they would deliver them to our relatives. And\neverything was written in code, and we never used the word Psilovrahos, it was our \u2014 it\nwas a code word like, our place in the mountains, or our vacation place. And so we were\nurging them to leave, and the reply was that everything is fine here. We have plenty of\nfood, and they were actually worried about the children catching cold up in the\nmountains, because at that time, the ger \u2014 there \u2014 there was no indication of anything was\ngoing to happen to them now. Ioannina, or Ioannina at this point is occupied by the\nGermans, but there was no indication that anything bad was going to happen. So \u2014 so we\nfelt very secure in the village, and we actually began to enjoy our life there, vacation\nSeptember 14, 2010\nspot, until suddenly it was \u2014 I believe it was November, the end of November, when\nYonas Mionis, this is the same man \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 same guy, he comes \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he was \u2014 he had been running, he \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he\narrived to the village, and from another \u2014 another village called 10s \u2014 Agios Vlassis, a\nnearby village, and told my parents that we have to leave and find another place, we have\nto leave the village immediately, or \u2014 or by \u2014 by tomorrow morning, and go to another\nplace, because the Germans have advanced to \u2014 ar-are-are \u2014 are in Agios Vlassis, and\nthey are advancing in the direction of Psilovrahos. By that time there were two more\nJewish men who had ended up in Psilovrahos, they had come from another city, I believe\nHelkese(ph). And of course you know we were \u2014 my parents, they panicked. They \u2014 they\nwere advised to go to a higher place up in the mountains. And we arranged with a mule\ndriver to come the following morning, to transport us to this higher place. And I\nremember th-the \u2014 oh well, during the night \u2014 during the night, was a very frightful night,\nbecause we didn\u2019t know whether the Germans were advancing during the night, but there\nwas a big explosion, a distant explosion. We didn\u2019t know where it was coming from. I\nshould say that when Yonas Mionis came to alert us of the advance of the Germans,\nthere was there \u2014 the church bells started to ring alarm, and these young men of EPON\nwas calling everybody to his feet, and urging able-bodied men to take their weapons,\nrifles, whatever they had, and go to Agios Vlassis to stop advance of the Germans. So,\nSeptember 14, 2010\nthe following morning, this mule driver arrives and \u2014 and now again, I don\u2019t know\nwhether I heard my mother say that, or I heard her say that much later, but 1t impressed\nme that these \u2014 what kind of mules are these? These are just a \u2014 they look like big \u2014 big\ndogs; they were very small. And of course, we were very grateful that there was a means\nof transportation, so we loaded a few \u2014 a few things and along with the other Jewish men,\nwe started climbing the mountain. Now, this part I know is firsthand experience. I\nremember my mother saying \u2014 I was getting tired, and my mother kept saying, keep\nwalking, keep walking, you have to \u2014 because I was behind everybody. And I don\u2019t know\nwhether she said the Germans are coming, but all she was urging me to walk faster. And\nso it \u2014 it was a \u2014 it was a rainy day, and I remember my mother insisted that we all wear\nextra clothing for warmth, and finally we reached a house, this mule driver took us to the\nhouse of a man called Chiandafelis(ph). It was a \u2014 th-there were no other houses there,\njust his house. And of course, he opens the door, sees this unlikely group of people, city\npeople at his doorstep, he didn\u2019t know what was going on. And \u2014 and it was revealed that\n\u2014 that wi \u2014 th-the \u2014 the mule driver told him who we were and why we were there. So\nthey probably \u2014 he probably told them that we are Jewish, and that the Germans were\nadvancing. I \u2014 I don\u2019t know exactly what he told him. But when the man, Mr.\nChiandafelis(ph) heard the word Agrinion, he became very excited, because he told us\nthat his daughter Theandafela(ph) was working for a family in Agrinion, the family of\nDavaroukas(ph). And it so happened that Davaroukas(ph) was a colleague of my\nSeptember 14, 2010\nfather\u2019s in the National Bank of Greece. So he became very excited, because my father\ntold him, oh I know your daughter, she came to the bank several times, and I know her,\nshe is a very nice girl. And you see, a lot of villagers would send their daughters into the\ncity to work as maids in hope that they would learn to grow \u2014 to learn \u2014 acquire some\nskills with city people. They would take them out of school and they would work as\nmaids to bring some income for the family, and also learn to be nice young ladies, the\nway city people were. So he welcomed us, you know, from strangers we became friends.\nHe welcomed us and \u2014 and offered us a place to \u2014 to sleep. The Greeks are very\nhospitable people.",
        "A: Even in danger, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a tradition, and 1-in fact, in danger, they \u2014 they sense\nthat there is a common enemy, and we have to help one another. And that was from my\nmother\u2019s memoirs, when she describes her many visits into the countryside, this is the\nfeeling that I get, that the people were welcoming. The-They saw this woman and her\nson, because she would go around with my brother, and they\u2019d try to help as much as\nthey can. So we make arrangements to \u2014 to spend the night in Mr. Chiandafelis\u2019 (ph)\nhouse. And then the next morning \u2014 or rather it was, perhaps \u2014 no, I think it was the same\nday; it was raining and then when the rain stopped, we stepped outside. And it was at that\npoint that my brother saw a group of men with horses or mules, ascending the mountain.\nAnd \u2014 and he said, the Germans are coming, the Germans are coming. And that, you\nSeptember 14, 2010\nknow, created panic, and everybody just dispersed and hid behind rocks, behind trees.\nAnd then the Chiandafelis(ph) re-realized that we were terrified by the Germans. And so\nat this point they decide that it\u2019s best for us to spend the day in a cave. In Arapo(ph)\nKefalas(ph) was the name of the cave, and spend the day in \u2014 and spend the night in his\nhouse. And that\u2019s what we did.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, all I had to do was I had to gather rocks, and there were plenty of rocks, because\nthis village is just covered with rocks. And so he made a \u2014 a mound of rocks, and then he\ndug up the soil and extracted some clay, mixed it with hay to reinforce the \u2014 the mud, and\nthen \u2014 oh we \u2014 we piled the rocks on the top of the \u2014 a large flagstone. You pile the rocks\nand then you cover the rocks with this mixture of clay and hay. And so you create a\ndome, and there\u2019s two o \u2014 there are two openings, one in front to put the food in, and out,\nand then one at the top for the smoke to escape. And so when the clay is dry, you remove\nthe rocks from inside and you create this hollow space, and you use wood to sh \u2014 heat up\nthe oven, and this is how you \u2014 you bake things, and \u2014\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Yes, yes \u2014",
        "A: Yes, there was the only way to cook, to bake something. We had the fireplace in \u2014 ins\n\u2014 in the room, and at first she used the \u2014 what they call a gastra. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a metal dome\npiece of like \u2014 well, the \u2014 the cover of a pot, but fairly large, and you light the fire and\nthen you, in the hot ashes and the smoldering charcoal, you can bake something, provided\nyou have this gastra on top of it, because it keeps the heat inside.",
        "A: But in a\u2014 I believe gastra was something that we borrowed from \u2014 from the villagers.\nVillagers were very generous, very helpful, the \u2014 they realized that we were not equipped\nfor this kind of life, and they were willing to share their tools or \u2014 or kitchen materials of\n\u2014 to \u2014 to help us manage. But for some reason this gastra had to be returned to the\nvillager and so \u2014 so my father had to construct this oven. It was not his invention, it was\nvery common and I\u2019m sure the villagers told him how to construct one. But my father\nwas always interested in learning things and experimenting with different devices. So \u2014\nso, going up to the \u2014 so really, I did not have any toys, but this is \u2014 so I used to build\nsmall ovens fol \u2014 following that model.",
        "A: With other kids, yes.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Yes, we \u2014 I wanted to light a fire, but of course, you know, my mother, you know, was\nabsolutely against 1t, because it was dangerous. At some point in my life, in my\nchildhood, I did light a fire. I was fascinated by this \u2014 by these \u2014 this structure of the\noven.",
        "A: And after the war, I think \u2014 I know that I \u2014 I lit a fire in there. It\u2019s quite interesting,\nyes.",
        "A: No, no \u2014",
        "A: No, not really.",
        "A: Yes. The thing that I was attached, in the village, was this goat. I\u2014 I really was \u2014\nbecame very attached to that animal.",
        "A: Actually, I missed this animal when it had to be killed, because at the later point in our\nstay in \u2014 in the village, the \u2014 the goat became sick and had to be slaughtered. And so they\nkilled the goat and I wa \u2014 I was really \u2014 I don\u2019t think my parents realized how devastated\nI was. I was a rather quiet child that didn\u2019t share my feelings or talk about things. I don\u2019t\nthink I did. And so when they killed the goat, they \u2014 the villagers told us that you have to\nSeptember 14, 2010\ncut it into small pieces, and put it in a barrel with a lot of salt to preserve it for the winter.\nAnd that\u2019s what we did. And th \u2014 it turned out that the goat was pregnant, so \u2014",
        "A: Not sick, or perhaps it was both, and my father threw away the fetus, but one of the \u2014\nthe Jewish men in the village, those that had joined us at a la \u2014 later point, was told that\nthe fetus was thrown away, and he was starving, literally starving, and he went, picked up\nthe dead fetus, cooked it and \u2014 and they ate it.",
        "A: The goat? Yes \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it\u2019s regular meat.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: Oh, yes. I-I don\u2019t think I refused the meat. I was so hungry and by then it was no\nlonger a goat, 1t was just a piece of extremely salty meat, it wasn\u2019t even palatable.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: I know that my parents many times described situations where I was hungry or very\nthirsty, and they said, but Ninetta did not complain. So I don\u2019t know what was going on\nthrough my mind that we were \u2014 had all these hardships, and there\u2019s nothing that can be\ndone.",
        "A: So I \u2014it\u2019s very hard for me to \u2014 to know \u2014 I don\u2019t think that the \u2014 the war experience\naffected me in the way that made me frightened and made me quiet, because for me, the\nexperience of \u2014 of living in this village, where I was free, I was really free to go\nanywhere I wanted as a child, surrounded by this wild beauty of the village; the animals,\ngoats and sheep and donkeys and chickens everywhere. It was \u2014 it was \u2014 it was a positive\nexperience, and I think \u2014 I have a feeling that this is where I developed my \u2014 my love for\nnature. I \u2014 I\u2014I just \u2014 cause I was so close to nature, so close to the animals, to this\nwilderness. So I don\u2019t think it had a negative impact on me.",
        "A: No, cause \u2014",
        "A: Yes.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: It is possible that \u2014 I don\u2019t know how mature I was for my age \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 but maybe that \u2014 made that valuation, but I never felt I was hiding. I didn\u2019t go into\nhiding.",
        "A: We were free.",
        "A: And \u2014 and \u2014 and so, really a designation of a survivor, a survivor, it had never entered\nmy mind until I was identified as a survivor here in the United States.",
        "A: Because for us in Greece, survivors were those who returned from the \u2014 survived the\nconcentration camps.",
        "A: Not the ones who survived hiding 1n \u2014 1n the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 up in the mountains, or even within the cities.",
        "A: And I compared notes with other people who had similar experience, and they felt the\nsame way. They were not survivors. We didn\u2019t have to \u2014 we didn\u2019t have to hide, really,\nduring that period.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Although we were hiding from Germans.",
        "A: Yes, exactly.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, it has really expanded.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: On \u2014 on foot.",
        "A: The \u2014 the mules were simply carrying \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 our belongings, yes.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: N-No, we are going to this man\u2019s house.",
        "A: And this is Mr. Chiandafelis(ph) \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes. But then there was this incident of my brother seeing this group of men and\nhorses or mules ascending this precipice and she panicked and said, oh the Germans are\ncoming, and created a lot of panic among all of us, because in addition to my family,\nthere were now three additional Jewish men; one of them was Yonas Mionis, the\nresistance leader. And we all dispersed behind rocks, behind trees and that 1s when \u2014 oh,\nand then Mr. Chiandafelis(ph) sent his son, Spyros down the mountain to see who these\npeople were and he discovered just villagers returning to their homes. But then they\nrecognized that we were terrified of the possibility of being discovered by the Germans,\nand so they rec \u2014 Chiandafelis(ph) recommended that we spend the day in this cave,\ncalled Arapo(ph). Kefalas(ph), and \u2014 and the night at his house. And that\u2019s exactly what\nwe did, this Spyros, Mr. Chiandafelis\u2019 son guided us to the \u2014 to the cave, and that again,\nI have a firsthand recollection. I remember this very vividly as a child going into a cave.\nIt was quite an experience, and I was \u2014 I was frightened. I was frightened at first, because\nit was so dark, especially, you know, before our eyes adjusted to the darkness, it was very\ndark, and there was all kinds of formations of stalactites and stalagmites. And my father\nSeptember 14, 2010\nfound a little ledge on the side, sort of halfway into the cave. It was like an alcove, and\nwe spread the blankets, and the four of us huddled together in this dark cave. And \u2014 and\nmy father, he \u2014 he always tried to calm everybody down, and \u2014 and he \u2014 this a \u2014 he\u2019s a \u2014\nwas a very good storyteller. So he would tell us different kinds of stories about his\nexploits, ab \u2014 as a soldier going up to the \u2014 to the front, the Albanian \u2014 Greek Albanian\nfront or \u2014 and then Bible stories, lots of Bible stories, which he embellished greatly to\nentertain us. And I don\u2019t know whether this is \u2014 actually happened. I don\u2019t know he \u2014 he\n\u2014 he \u2014 whether he explained to m \u2014 to us how these structures are formed in the cave. I-I\ndon\u2019t remember whether he explained, but I have a feeling that he did, but I\u2019m not\npositive. And so, it was hours that we had to s \u2014 to spend in this alcove, in the dark \u2014\nsemi-darkness. We could hear the dripping of the water in the back, as the water mixed\nwith minerals, would drip down into a \u2014 a pond at the bottom of the \u2014 of the cave. And\nthen suddenly we hear somebody call my father, you know, Mr. Matsas, Mr. Matsas.\nAnd we were frightened because we thought somebody discovered us. And so we\ndecided not to \u2014 to say anything, to keep quiet. But the voice persisted, Mr. Matsas, Mr.\nMatsas, then he said I\u2019m \u2014 this is Spyros. Come out, come out, it\u2019s safe, 1t\u2019s calm, this 1s\nSpyros, Chiandafelis\u2019(ph) son. And \u2014 and I don\u2019t remember whether we came out, or the\npeople outside came in, I don\u2019t remember. But later on my father said that he was afraid\nat first that they were going to throw a grenade, because at first we thought there were\nGermans, enemies. But what we discovered when we \u2014 we met the two people that\nSeptember 14, 2010\nSpyros had brought there, these were two other Jewish men who were seeking shelter,\nlike we were. They were in Agios Vlassis and when the Germans advanced, at that point\nthey left and they came to Psilovrahos, and then they were told that this Jewish family up\n\u2014there\u2019s another family up in \u2014 hiding up higher in the mountains. So now Mr.\nChiandafelis(ph) had several people to feed every night. But we decided that the villa \u2014\nthe \u2014 the cave was not safe either, so my father searched in the forest for a secluded place.\nAnd so we decided to spend the day in this secluded place, and the nights at the house.",
        "A: Because it was a place that was known by the villagers. This is not a cave, a remote\ncave that nobody knows about. He felt that 1t was known and it\u2019s best for the duration,\nyou know, while the Germans were in Psilovrahos, because they did come \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 they did come to Psilovrahos.",
        "A: It is best for us to be 1n a place that nobody knew, except perhaps Spyros and his\nfather.",
        "A: And so I ev \u2014 again, I remember this secluded place. It was \u2014 1t was underneath a\nprotruding rock, to protect us from the rain. And so we \u2014 they gathered branches for trees\nSeptember 14, 2010\nto \u2014 to create a camouflage the opening. And so again we huddled together, the four of\nUS.",
        "A: It\u2019s outside.",
        "A: It\u2019s outside, but there\u2019s a rock, a very large rock that protrudes, creating a roof, and so\nwe \u2014 we Sat underneath and we blocked the opening with \u2014 with branches of fir trees and\nwhatever other materials that we\u2019re able to find. And we stand \u2014 we actually stand seven\nor eight day \u2014 days.",
        "A: Yes \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 at night. At night we go back to Mr. Chiandafelis(ph) house, and Spyros would\ngive us some bread and olives or cheese for the day. And at night he would prepare a\nmeal. He acted like a waiter. He \u2014 his \u2014 Mr. Chiandafelis(ph) was very proud of his son,\nand Spyros sort of rose to the occasion, and he prepared bean soup, lentil soup or\nchickpea soup. That was the kind of food the villagers would eat. It would have meat\nperhaps once a week, or once every two weeks, if they could find it. And then we would\nspend the night on the floor. There were several people now. And then during the day, go\nback to that shelter.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Yeah, there were \u2014 actually at one point there were five.",
        "A: They \u2014 two of them decided that it wasn\u2019t safe for them to \u2014 to be even in\nPsilovrahos, maybe another village is safer. But later on they returned, because the\nsituation was not as good there as well. So, eventually there were only three additional\nJewish men that stayed in the village, plus the wife of one of them. Her name was orea \u2014\nAureo(ph) Zeelavee(ph). Now, these people were not ordinary people. One of them,\nAron(ph) Romano(ph) was a ship owner, very wealthy. And the other was an owner of a\nprivate bank. And Aron(ph) Romano(ph) always carried a little briefcase, which we\nthought was probably \u2014 contained gold coins, but did not want to use them, didn\u2019t want to\nreveal that he had gold. So he preferred to starve, because he didn\u2019t have the resources\nthat we had; sugar and soap and oil, to barter for other items to eat.",
        "A: Yes, when we \u2014 you know, at the end of the eight days when \u2014 that was the period that\nthe Germans stayed in the village, my parents gave him sugar. This is how we paid. And\nhe was a very hospitable person, a very, very hard life.",
        "A: Yes, yes.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: True.",
        "A: There is \u2014 that is the truth. There was one family \u2014 actually he happened to be one of\nthe wealthiest people, who were not very helpful. There was a time when he could have\nhelped us tremendously to avoid experiencing literally starvation during the winter,\nbecause there was \u2014 well, I think I should tell you this part later in the story.",
        "A: But \u2014 but he was the exception. Th-The villagers were very helpful, very helpful.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: True, true.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The \u2014 the driver of the mules, who actually returned after he dropped us off, he\nreturned to the village, he came back to get us. And so we knew that it was time to come\nSeptember 14, 2010\nback, that th-the \u2014 the \u2014 the Germans had left the village. But at the same time, the rumor\ncirculated that \u2014 that the Germans, who had actually occupied the room, our room, had\nlooted our room that \u2014 you know, they looted Mr. Matsas\u2019 room, the Germans did. This\nwas the rumor that circulated. And so when we returned, soon as we returned, before we\neven entered the house \u2014 this is the story that I learned later on, the owner of the house\ncame and said, you know, the Germans occupied the room, and they looted your house.\nThey ate whatever you had, and they took away the remainder. And so we entered the\nroom, and everything was in disarray and all the food was gone. And there was a\nsubstantial supply of food, you know, sacks of all sorts of things. And so w-we became \u2014\nwe panicked. Especially my mother, what is going to happen, because this is the end of\nNovember, actually was probably already December and the winter is coming. The\nharvest is over, there\u2019s no possibility of us buying food from the villagers or elsewhere.\nSo \u2014 so my father tried to calm her down, saying well, we\u2019ll send a man down to\nAgrinion, we have a lot of food in the bank \u2014\nEnd of Tape Four\nSeptember 14, 2010\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Very upset, and winter 1s coming and sources of food are scarce. And my father tried\nto calm her down, that we will send a man down in the village, in the \u2014 in Agrinion to get\nsome food from the bank. And this is something we did, but the man came back with one\nsmall ca \u2014 one can of oil, that was all he could bring, because he was bringing food\nsupplies for his family, and that was the only additional weight for the mule to carry. But\nI was friends with the \u2014 the children of the owner of the house, and they told me one day,\noh \u2014 they were boasting, oh, we have so much food now. We have rice and beans, we\nhave \u2014 we even have candles. We have things that we never had before. And I \u2014 I was\nvery impressed, and I reported this to my parents, you know, I said the \u2014 my friends, they\ntold me they have all this good stuff. And immediately my parents suspected that the\nowner of the house was the one who looted the room, and my father confronted him, and\nhe denied that he \u2014 he took anything. And my father persisted, and he had to accept to \u2014\nthe fact that \u2014 he had to admit that he did take a few things. He was afraid of my father\ntalking about this to the village, and that he was going to be embarrassed. And so he\nreturned a few items. But my parents knew that he probably had a lot more, and was\nhidden somewhere. And so my father searched the \u2014 the barn and other hidden \u2014 possible\nSeptember 14, 2010\nplaces where he could have hidden food, and sure enough they \u2014 he found a can of oil.\nAnd oil was a real treasure, because was \u2014 this is olive oil, was very hard to find, very\nvaluable, if you were going to use it as a commodity to exchange it for other kinds of\nfood. So my parents were infuriated with this man because he \u2014 he really \u2014 he created the\nsituation that we \u2014 we were trying to avoid, and that is lack of food in the winter. So they\nconsidered bringing this matter to the people\u2019s court. There were people\u2019s courts then, in\nvillages. They were not official courts, but they were \u2014 consisted of the elders of the\nvillage, and all sorts of ma \u2014 matters of \u2014 disputes were brought to the people\u2019s court.\nAnd the people\u2019s court was actually very severe in punishments that \u2014 that they imposed\non people. So my parents reconsidered that, because they were afraid he would be, who\nknows, imprisoned, or some very severe punishment; he had a young family, so they\ndecided to drop the matter. And that they also didn\u2019t want to draw attention to ourselves.\nSo they dropped the matter, and at this point we had to leave that room, and we went to\nanother house to live in. This was very similar to the one we occupied the first time. This\none had two rooms, one room was a Kafeneio, a caf\u00e9. And the other room was the room\nthat we occupied, and th \u2014 and it had a basement. And so \u2014 so that was a big change, it\nwas \u2014 we adjusted to it very quickly. But the main concern now was food. There was a\nfamily by the name Yovanos(ph) who lived in Agrinion, but had come to the village for\nthe summer, and they stayed on because of the \u2014 the war situation. But they had decided\nto return to Agrinion. And they had a lot of wheat with them. So my father, being a bank\nSeptember 14, 2010\nemployee, he conducted a transaction not with checks, but with wheat. He told him, if\nyou give us your wheat that is here, you can collect our wheat, which is stored in the\nbank. It was an exchange, and no wheat had to travel to Agrinion or from Agrinion to\nPsilovrahos, but it was a transaction that s-seemed reasonable to him, and he gave us a\ncertain amount of wheat. But he had more wheat, but this other villager that was wealthy,\nwho could have cooperated at this point and \u2014 and he could have made the Yovanos(ph)\nwheat available to us, he decided not to do that, and he kept the wheat for \u2014 for himself.\nAnd that was a very callous thing to do, and he, years later when \u2014 after the war, the man\nrecognized that he had done something very, very bad, and he came to my father and my\nparents and \u2014 and asked them for their forgiveness, because by \u2014 by not agreeing to make\nthis wheat available to us, he made life absolutely horrible for the family. So \u2014 so th-that\nis the situation now, we are \u2014 we have very little food. We do have this oil that the\nvillager brings from the village, and this wheat. Then my mother started exchanging\nsugar for a certain kind of cereal that is called Trachanas. It\u2019s a \u2014a coarsely ground\nwheat mixed with milk that is \u2014 that \u2014 that 1s in a dry state and when you add some milk,\nit expands, and it\u2019s a very nutritious food and very filling. So \u2014 so this is what my mother\nstarted doing, exchanging sugar for \u2014 for Trachanas or corn meal. Then some of the\nvillagers would give us some eggs from the chickens, some milk, a piece of cheese. It\nwas a very difficult situation and there\u2019s winter approaching, it\u2019s already winter. It 1s\ncold. And so then, my mother, wh-who is a very resourceful person, she decided that \u2014\nSeptember 14, 2010\nthat she is going to barter clothing, our personal clothes, for food. And so she became a\npeddler, and she went with my 13 year old brother from village to village, exchanging\nclothing for food. Or, she did other things. She knitted for people. She was \u2014 she had\nmany skills. She knew how to make lace. An-And one \u2014 one thought came to her mind is\nthat the girls in the village, they want to prepare their dowry, and I can teach them how to\n\u2014 to knit. I di\u2014 can teach them how to embroider, how to make lace, and so \u2014 and said,\nthere are a lot of girls in the village who would want this, and they would exchange my\nservices for food. And the one family that I mentioned earlier, the Tsulamitsu(ph)\nfamily, they had seven daughters. They had prepare seven dowries. So she went to \u2014\nstarted with them. And she\u2019d go there every day and help them, show them how to\nembroider, how to make lace and so on, in exchange for cheese or bread or whatever they\nhad. So they ha \u2014 my parents had to start rationing the food. It was less and less every\nday. And I \u2014 I remember it was winter, still winter, and there were some mulberry trees\nand fig trees. There are a lot of mulberry trees and fig trees in Greece. And my mother\nsaid, you know, when these, you know, these fig trees, when spring and summer come,\nth-they\u2019ll be full of figs. And so I remember this game very vividly, you know, walking\nunderneath those trees, waiting for someday to see figs up on the tree.",
        "A: That yes, I remember. In fact, at one point, it was in the summer when figs had\nformed, there was one fig tree that was growing on \u2014 on the edge of a retaining wall, and\nSeptember 14, 2010\nI reached to \u2014 to get a fig, and I fell off the retaining wall, and I \u2014 I remember that, of\ncourse. I didn\u2019t get hurt, but \u2014",
        "A: It was, it was. It was scary, yes. But \u2014",
        "A: Yes, I remember being hungry, and to this day, I cannot bear seeing people throw\naway food. You know for me food 1s something very, very valuable, and I\u2019m very\nconscious \u2014 I\u2019m very conscious of the waste that I see around me these days. But yes,\nhunger was pervasive. That\u2019s all we could think of was in our em \u2014 our stomachs were\nempty, was \u2014 it was \u2014 we were very hungry.",
        "A: The villagers \u2014 well, you know, they \u2014 they had chickens, so they could get eggs.\nThey would slaughter a chicken here and there to get meat. They had goats for milk. But\nwe had \u2014 didn\u2019t have any of these animals, and they had stored food, as they always do,\nfor the winter, like dry figs and walnuts, especially. Lentils and beans, dry beans. So\npoverty and hunger were pervasive, but we were \u2014 we were worse off than they were,\nbecause we didn\u2019t have these resources that they were used to; the animals that provided\nthem with nutritious food.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: The money was worthless, yes, yes. One wonderful thing happened during this period\nof \u2014 of, literally, starvation. A group of partisans, or andartes, as they were known, they\ncame to the village and they camped there, they \u2014 they settled there for 20 days. There\nwere 60 of them. I don\u2019t know why they settled in the village, but my parents recognized\nthere was an opportunity for us to get food. And it was either my father or brother who\napproached the captain of this band, and described our desperate situation and asked them\nif they could help us. And the captain agreed to give us the equivalent of two portions of\na \u2014 of food for one partisan, for the four of us to share. And so my brother, when the \u2014 the\nbugle was sounded, he could go there with a pot, and they would give him the portion of\n\u2014 of a partisan, which was not very much. It was just corn soup and a piece of corn bread.\nBut for us it was God sent. And he did that twice a day, and we would share the food, and\n\u2014 and that was for 20 days. That was quite a \u2014 a long time. So that was the situation. I\ndon\u2019t know at what point my parents \u2014 my mother decided that she should use \u2014 not \u2014 to\nsell not only our personal clothing, but also household items. I don\u2019t know whether it was\nin that \u2014 in the wintertime or later on in the spring, but just all of a sudden she got this\nbright idea of \u2014 of using the cases \u2014 we had brought mattress cases. In Greece \u2014 in\nGreece you protect everything you have, like mattress, you have to have a case for the\nmattress, to protect it from dust. And so we \u2014 when we came to the village, we brought\nthese mattress cases with us, and we stuffed them with hay to make mattresses. So my\nmother, out of desperation she had this brilliant idea, said, I have these mattress cases. I\nSeptember 14, 2010\ncan \u2014 I can use them to make pants for \u2014 for boys, or men. These \u2014 the villagers are\ndressed in rags. And \u2014 but these mattress cases, usually, they have very bright stripes, red\nstripes. So my father said, nobody is going to wear these ridiculous looking pants, with\nthese bright stripes. And then he thought further and said well, we \u2014 we can dye them, we\ncan dye them brown. And that was my father\u2019s great opportunity to experiment and he \u2014\nhe said, we\u2019ll gather shells of \u2014 walnut shells, and they were plentiful in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in\nthe fields, and \u2014 and poppies. So this must have happened 1n the spring, early spring, and\nthere are lots of poppies in \u2014 growing in \u2014 in the mountains. So he made this concoction,\nboiled walnut shells with the poppies, creating this brown gooey material, and dipped\nthese mattress cases when they came, and boiled them for a few minutes, and then they\nturned brown. Later on I found out that \u2014 that in colonial times they used walnuts to dye\nwool and \u2014 and fabric. So \u2014 so my mother made pants for \u2014 for boys, and then she used\nsheets, the sheets that we brought, to make shirts for men. And so she had all these wares\nto exchange for food, then she went from village to village with my brother, doing that.\nAnd she\u2019d come home with \u2014 with cheese or bread or \u2014 everything was delicious to us,\nanything was delicious.",
        "A: Yes \u2014\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: \u2014 exactly. E-Everything by hand. It was \u2014 she\u2019d work long hours and in the daytime.\nShe had to do it in the daytime because one of the things we lost were candles, the\ncandles that we brought. And so it was winter, the days were short. But again my father,\nhe invented something, he experimented with pieces of rubber from the tires, car tires,\nthat the village cobbler was using to repair shoes. He would use the material from tires as\nsoles for shoes. And so he collected scraps of rubber and burned them. He \u2014 he mounted\nthem with a \u2014 an old rusty can by the fireplace and \u2014 and it burned. It gave off light, but a\nhorrible smell. The smell was absolutely horrible, but we had light at night. So \u2014 so he \u2014\nhe \u2014 both of my parents were very resourceful people, and they would always find the\nsolution to \u2014 to a problem.",
        "A: Yes, definitely, she \u2014 she worked very hard. And my father, he was \u2014 he had a\nsedentary job at the bank, so he wasn\u2019t used to his long walks on rough terrain. So there\nwere times he had to cross a creek, or a \u2014 a river [indecipherable] that was not \u2014 not a\nvery deep river, but he \u2014 he came down with aches on his legs, and then he had the dizzy\nspells. He had a few medical problems that had \u2014 had the \u2014 they were left unattended,\nalthough there were a couple of occasions when my mother and brother, they walked a\nlong distance to a village called Tatarna that had a hospital for the partisans, and there\nwas a doctor there. They consulted with him, and the doctor gave them some medicine\nSeptember 14, 2010\nfor my father, but somehow the villagers and us had managed to recover whatever\nailments we had, on our own. So that was the situation in the winter. It was a very\ndesperate situation. Then when spring came, there were \u2014 things were a little better\nbecause they gave us a short \u2014 a small plot to cultivate. And then there were mulberries.\nThe mulberry trees plentiful, which caused \u2014 and we lived on mulberry berries for a\nnumber of days until we developed stomach cramps and we realized we had to stop that.\nBut it was a very difficult period, and my mother, she bore the brunt of it, she really did.\nThat is the reason why, throughout this period she kept saying that I will go myself down\nto the city and bring a horse-load of food. And \u2014 and there were groups of villagers that\nwere going to the city. And she said, Ill just join one of them and go down into the city.\nAnd my father and brother always say no, no, absolutely not. And she would say why?\nThe villagers go. And \u2014 and she \u2014 they would say, yeah, but you\u2019re not an ordinary\nvillager, you \u2014 you\u2019re Jewish. And she said, well, I have an I.D. card, because they \u2014 my\nparents had acquired I.D. cards issued by \u2014 by the Germans. The priests of the village\nprovided them with baptismal papers and so the papers were given to the German\nauthorities. The names had \u2014 were changed. And there was a picture and my \u2014 both my\nparents had an I.D. card with their picture and signed by German officials. But the \u2014 the\nironic thing 1s that in the I.D., they do not ask for religion. It\u2019s rather bizarre. Perhaps\nthey didn\u2019t want to raise suspicions that \u2014 because tha-that was one of the reasons why\nmany Jews in the cities, such as Ioannina did not feel threatened, did not feel that they\nSeptember 14, 2010\nshould leave, they should go into hiding, because the Germans were careful not to raise\nsuspicions of what was awaiting them. And \u2014 and in fact, the letters that we were\nreceiving from my relatives in Ioannina were \u2014 were, you know, why don\u2019t you come to\nIoannina, we have plenty of food. Why should you be starving up there? And the same\nletter from Evianir(ph) Papadapoulos(ph), our \u2014 my father\u2019s colleague, you know, come\nto Agrinion, there is plenty of food. And there were many cases of Jews who returned.\nThey had left the city and gone to the countryside to hide. And because nothing was\nhappening in the cities, they returned, and they were eventually arrested. But my \u2014 my\nfather, my brother were \u2014 an-and my mother were determined to stay in the village. So \u2014\nbut she, every time she saw a group of villagers going down to Agrinion, she would say,\nall I have to do is just join them and \u2014 and our situation will improve.",
        "A: She just was so desperate that she was going to defy any danger that she was going to\nface. And eventually, in March, when the snow melted and the conditions for travel were\na little better, she \u2014 she joined one of these groups, and went down, started a long trek\ntowards the city of Agrinion. She walked for 12 hours, and on homemade shoes because\nher \u2014 she had a pair of shoes that was threadbare, and then the other pair were \u2014 had high\nheels. You can see how \u2014 how unprepared we were for this kind of life, she brought shoes\nwith high heels to Psilovrahos. And so she \u2014 she went with \u2014 with a group of villagers\ndown to Agrinion. This is very rough terrain, and all on foot. She walked for 12 hours,\nSeptember 14, 2010\nuntil she reached a village very close to Agrinion. I believe it was called\nFrangokisa(ph). Frangokisa(ph). And she had given \u2014 there was a young man, boy, who\n\u2014to whom my mother had given a slice of bread. She had \u2014 she brought two slices of\nbread, one for herself \u2014 well, for herself, both of them, but she was so tired, she asked\nhim, would you let me ride the mule if I gave you a slice of bread? And \u2014 and he did.\nAnd while they were doing this transaction, all of a sudden she hears her name, you\nknow, Mrs. Matsas, Mrs. Matsas. And that was \u2014 it turned out it was a friend of ours that\nthey knew from Arta, and her husband was the math teacher of my brother. What a\ncoincidence, in this wilderness. And her name was Zvolise(ph). And she said, Mrs.\nMatsas, where are you going, why are you here, where you should be far away from\nhere. And went on to say, haven\u2019t you heard, haven\u2019t you heard what happened to your\npeople? And then she went on to say, you know, the Jews of Arta and Preveza and\nIoannina have all been arrested. The Jews of Arta and Preveza are now housed in the\nPapapetrou tobacco warehouses and I don\u2019t know where they took the Jews of\nIoannina. And this 1s the first time that my mother learns of the fate of our relatives. It\nwas a very \u2014 a very painful, unbelievable news that she heard, 1t was \u2014 she was totally\ndevastated, crushed.",
        "A: Tartarna, Tartarna.",
        "A: That was a very affluent village, and it had this hospital for the partisans and then the\nvillagers. One of the \u2014 the doctors there at one point was Thanos(ph) Papatheodoro(ph),\na very fine man, whose family also lived in the vicinity. And a \u2014 it\u2019s just a si \u2014 it was a \u2014\nquite a coincidence, my mother and brother met them, met the family and the doctor and\nthere were three daughters, Hera, Ephemia(ph) and Irini(ph), or Nini(ph). And the\nmiddle one, Ephemia(ph) became my best friend after the war. We\u2019re friends to this day.\nAnd there were \u2014 they were \u2014 played a very important role in the family, in my\ndevelopment. They were a very cultured family, and it was through them that I was\nexposed to classical music and paintings. Her father was an amateur painter. A very\nrefined person. And \u2014 and this 1s the hospital where my f\u2014 my brother was asked by the\ndoctor \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether it was Dr. Papatheodoro(ph) or Dr. Panopoulous(ph),\nthe earlier doctor, asked my father to sing the ma \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, my brother Mykas(ph), he\nwas known as Mykas(ph) partisan songs. And my \u2014 my f \u2014 brother loved those partisan\nsongs, they were in the air, everywhere. They were very idealistic, describing a\nwonderful society that is going to be built after the war, a society that was free of\nignorance and poverty and injustice. And all of these wonderful ideas appealed to him as\nSeptember 14, 2010\na young person. And so he \u2014 he learned all those wonderful songs. He sings them to this\nday. I\u2014I learned a few of them, but he was the one who \u2014 who sang them, and he had a\nbeautiful voice, he still does. So now I will come back to the \u2014 to this encounter of my\nmother with Mrs. Volis(ph). So Mrs. Volis(ph) tells her that you have to leave as soon as\npossible. She talked to her husband, Mr. Volis(ph), and he suggested that \u2014 n-now my\nmother actually, even at this point, she said \u2014 she insisted that she go into the city, in spite\nof all this. She said, we\u2019re starving, we \u2014 we have to get some food. And so her husband\nrecommended that she go to another village called Kamaroula, where he has a\nkombarro(ph). Kombarro(ph) is a godfather. And his name was Christos\nZambarros(ph), and he \u2014 he was a teacher, and he said, he will help you. So my mother\nstarted walking alone with this horrible knowledge of \u2014 of what had happened to our\npeople, to Kamaroula. She recognizes the house where this man lived, knocks on the\ndoor several time, they do not answer. Eventually they open the door very cautiously,\nthey let her in very quickly, and she \u2014 she told them who she was and who \u2014 who sent her\nto them, and she said, I\u2019m looking for Christos Zambarros(ph). These were the sisters\nof Christos, and they said \u2014 they were \u2014 they were frightened because the Germans has\nsearched their house moments before my mother arrived. They took her to the window\nand they said \u2014 pointed to the \u2014 to the square and said, look down there. You see, the\nGermans are still there and they\u2019re still searching for people there. They were searching\nfor partisans, because at this point the \u2014 the resistance had grown very strong and they\nSeptember 14, 2010\nwere sabotaging the German advance and German actions; blowing bridges and\ndestroying roads. And so they said, take this ker \u2014 they gave her a kerchief quickly, said\nput it on, and just pretend that you are our aunt from Psilovrahos. Don\u2019t say anything.\nThey sent for their brother and he came, and my mother explained to him what was ha \u2014\nwhat happened, and begged him to \u2014 to go \u2014 I think \u2014 I think what happened \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow \u2014 I\u2019m not so sure at this point whether she had to go to their country home where a\ndeaf mute aunt was guarding their store \u2014 the food supplies. I don\u2019t know where this\nmeeting with Christos Zambarros(ph) took place, but he was very, very nice, and\nunderstood the situation, and he said, don\u2019t worry. I will go down to \u2014 into the city, and I\nwill do my best to bring a horse-load of \u2014 of food. So in the meantime, my mother was\nwaiting in this country home with this deaf mute aunt. This \u2014 Kamaroula was very close\nto Agrinion. And a few hours later he returned, but without a horse-load of food, and\nexplained to my mother that the Germans were very watchful now, that they did not\nallow any food to leave the city. And they had \u2014 they had executed resistance fighters\nalready in the city, about 200 of them. So the situation had really become very hard, very\ntough. And they said, the only thing that I was able to bring from your friends, your\nneighbors, were tea, a bottle \u2014 a bottle of quinine tablets, and some matches. Very useful\nthings, but not what we expected. So \u2014 so my mother took this me \u2014 these few items and\nstarted walking back to our city \u2014 to the village. And at one point she \u2014 she met\nPepola(ph) Hannah(ph). He was a re \u2014 a Jewish resistance fighter, and he already knew\nSeptember 14, 2010\nwhat had happened. So they fell into each other\u2019s arms and they cried and it was a very,\nvery emotional experience for my mother. But she had to rush \u2014I should tell you that\nthere were a lot of Jewish young men that had joined the resistance up in the mountains.\nThey have left their \u2014 their families to \u2014 to save themselves, and they joined the\nresistance. Unfortunately, a number of them, they joined the resistance, the \u2014 the\nandartes, but then they were afraid of reprisals by the Germans against their families,\nand so they returned. But a number of them stayed in the mountains. So they had to rush\nto \u2014 Christos(ph) and my mother \u2014 th-the partisans did not allow anybody to walk after\nsundown, and it was close to sundown. So they climbed a hill, and at the top of the hill\nwas a little chapel, a little church that Christos\u2019 grandfather had built. And so they spent\nthe night there, and this was Saint Elias chapel. And then the next day they said goodbye,\nand there is my mother bearing this horrible news, alone, walking alone from this place,\nKamaroula, all the way to Psilovrahos, bearing the news alone, and crying all the time.\nSo when she came back, at that point my brother, my f\u2014 and my father were outdoors\nworking on this plot of land that they gave us to cultivate, and when they saw her\ncoming, she was walking very slowly, they started to laugh, and they said, didn\u2019t we tell\nyou not to go? You came back \u2014 she came back three days later and she \u2014 she was\nplanning to stay for seven or eight days in Agrinion. We told you not to go. And my\nmother was in terrible physical shape, bearing the horrible news and she said, don\u2019t\nlaugh. Come in the house and when I tell you what happened, you will cry with bitter\nSeptember 14, 2010\ntears. And so she told us, and we were \u2014 we were just devastated. And I remember this\nscene. I had never, ever seen my mother in that state. Her eyes were \u2014 her \u2014 her feet were\nswollen, her face was swollen, her eyes were red, and she was physically exhausted and\nemotionally just absolutely drained. So we were just \u2014 just \u2014 just shocked. It took us \u2014\ntook a long time for \u2014 to recover from this shock, and the only thing that sort of brought a\nray of hope that sustained us was the possibility that they were taken to Krak\u00e9w, Poland,\nbecause that was the rumors that circulated when they deported the Jews of Salonika,\nthat they were being relocated to \u2014 to Krakow to establish their own Jewish community,\nto be self-governed with their own mayor, to establish synagogues wherever they wanted.\nSo we thought that th \u2014 these Jews as well, from Ioannina, Arta and Preveza, that that\nwas their destination. And you know, my parents said, we have to do something, but \u2014\nbut what can we do in \u2014 we\u2019re in this remote village, what can we do? But my father\nknew that there was a contingent of the British mission in Greece in a nearby village,\nbecause the British, throughout the war, were there helping the war effort behind the\nscenes. Helping the resistance. The British were there helping the resistance, even though\nlater on, after the war, the British were instrumental in preventing communism from\nbecoming established in Greece. But we \u2014 my father knew of this British mission, and he\nsaid we \u2014 we \u2014 we have to contact them. We should write letters and we should send a\nletter to the \u2014 he said, the nations of the world have to know what\u2019s happening, they have\nto do something to stop it. We didn\u2019t really know what was \u2014 you know, anything about\nSeptember 14, 2010\nthe Final Solution or what diabolic plans of the Nazis were at this point. So \u2014 so my\nfather decided to write a letter addressed to the British government. And the letter, that\nwas going to be delivered to my aunt and uncle, who resided in Alexandria in Egypt,\nand they in turn would give the letter to the Greek government in exile, which was in\nEgypt. It all sounds so naive now, but at the time it was a way of doing something. And\nso sure enough, my father composed these letters and \u2014 and my mother and brother again,\nwere to deliver these letters to the village of Priantza. They didn\u2019t know where Priantza\nwas, they had to \u2014 to ask many people to find their way to Priantza. So they finally\narrive in Priantza and the \u2014 the British officials are willing to meet with them. And my\nmother, when she came back, she described that they \u2014 they walked into a large room,\nand they sat on two chairs, my brother and \u2014 and her, and facing these British officers,\nand they told them what had happened, and they \u2014 they begged them to deliver these\nletters. And the British officers, they accepted the letters, but they didn\u2019t sound very\nreassuring. In fact, one of them said to my mother, you know \u2014 and I don\u2019t know if it was\nhis wife and children or \u2014 or some other relative, they \u2014 you know, my wife and children\ndied in the bombing in London, and \u2014 and that \u2014 I have to bear that loss. So my mother\nwas in tears because she felt they were not giving her any encouraging words. And so\nthey left with my brother and felt that this was a fruitless mission. I don\u2019t know whether\nthese letters were ever de-delivered to \u2014 to anybody. But one \u2014 one good thing that they\ndiscovered while in Priantza, there were a lot of parachute drops that they were \u2014 th-they\nSeptember 14, 2010\nwere delivering supplies to the British officers in the British mission, and \u2014 and so the\nvillagers in Priantza had a lot of this material. So much of it they didn\u2019t know what to do\nwith it. And so when my mother discovered that this material was plentiful, she went\nfrom house to house asking for some of this parachute material, it\u2019s like a dark, khaki\nkind of greenish fabric, and rope from the parachutes. And so when they returned home\nafter their mission, my brother came into the hou \u2014 room with this big bundle of\nparachute material. And that was like gold for us, because my mother finally had fabric to\nsew dresses, blouses, and so on. But I \u2014 from what I recall, we did not dwell on this. Th-\nThere weren\u2019t many discussions about this between my parents, about the deportation of\nthe Jews. And \u2014 and th-the hope that we maintained throughout the war was that they\nwere relocated to Poland, and when the war is over, they will return. We were \u2014 my\nparents were primarily concerned with my grandparents, because they were in their late\nyears, and they were very concerned about them, if they would be \u2014 they\u2019II be able to\nsurvive. So then \u2014 so my mother started working again, sewing the dresses and blouses\nand resuming her bartering activities with my brother, from village to village. And that\nreally was very, very helpful, because now it\u2019s summertime, the villagers have more food\nto exchange for \u2014 for dresses, and so the situation, the food situation improved with the \u2014\nwith the weather, you know, spring and summer.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, it is \u2014 it\u2019s really hard to distinguish, because I did have a recollection of my\ngrandmother, as I said earlier, and all these cousins sitting on this \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 long table, my grandmother serving rice pudding, rizogalo. And \u2014 and \u2014 and so 1-it \u2014\nthis is very hard to distinguish, why I-I was very upset. Of course now, in retrospect, I\nwas upset by the loss, the enormous loss that we \u2014 we suffered. But at that point, it was\nmy mother, because my mother was, for me, a security blanket. And to see her in that\nstate, it was very upsetting. She was physically, and of course emotionally, a rag.",
        "A: It was \u2014 it was a very difficult moment.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Right, exactly. When my father first learned about the deportations of the Jews of\nSalonika, which started I believe, in \u2014 in March of 1942 \u2014 was 40 \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 40 \u2014 no, it was \u00b042.",
        "A: I believe it was \u201942. He \u2014 was 1n April, he asked \u2014 this was the time when he asked \u2014\nwent to the \u2014 the manager of the bank and asked for a leave absence \u2014 he had the\npermission to use his leave of absence any time it became necessary. And my father told\nus later on the \u2014 the manager told him, you don\u2019t really have to worry about anything,\nyou are different. In other words, the Jews of Salonika are more Jewish than you are.\nAnd \u2014 and it \u2014 and it was true that the Jews of Salonika, they spoke Ladino and they\nspoke French, but they did not have good grasp of the Greek language, because it was a\nvery large community, with many educational institutions, and they could live isolated\nfrom the Greek Christian population. They were not assimilated the way the Jews are in\nother cities, who \u2014 who are known as the Romaniote Jews, who spoke grew \u2014 Greek\nfluently, and could blend in with the Greek population very easily and just disappear. So\nthere was that perception that those \u2014 you are different from those Jews. The fact of the\nmatter is that \u2014\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Didn\u2019t matter to the Nazis, right. This was \u2014 this \u2014 the \u2014 the Jews of Salonika were\ndescendants of the Jews that had come in 1492, expelled from Spain and they \u2014 they\nretained their language, while the Jews in the rest of there were known as Romaniote.\nThey had settled there, some of them even before the Romans. And others came later on\nand they \u2014 they spoke Greek fluently, and \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes, wherever we were. For example, the Jews of Athens, who were not seph \u2014\nthey \u2014 they were not Sephardim, strictly speaking, they were \u2014 they spoke Greek. A\nnumber of them hid in the city, and circulated in the city, and they could blend in with the\npopulation, but the Jews of Salonika had this added problem that hindered their \u2014",
        "A: What did they know about the di \u2014 I don\u2019t know if they knew about the Final Solution.\nI know in \u2014 years later I\u2014 I knew \u2014 I learned that the British government and the\nAmerican government knew as early as November 1942, of the Final Solution. But\nunfortunately \u2014 a-and \u2014 and \u2014 did not do anything to inform the Jews of what awaited\nthem. And that is the very painful thought that \u2014 that whatever was known by the author \u2014\nSeptember 14, 2010\nAmerican, British authorities was not disseminated on time for the Jews to \u2014 so survive,\nparticularly the Jews of Greece, and particularly these Jews that were arrested sort of late\nin the war. The arrests began for the Romaniote Jews in 1944, March 1944, and the war\nended in Greece, October 1944.",
        "A: There was plenty of time for the Jews to be informed of what awaited them, and \u2014 and\nalso Greece lended itself to \u2014 to the survival of the Jewish \u2014 first of all, there was a very\nstrong resistance group, very well organized, in the countryside. The countryside was\nfree, it was called \u2014 it was free Greece. Well organized, and then, they operated within\nthe cities. So, when we left Agrinion, it was October 1943, beginning of October, it was\neasy for anybody to go in and out of the city. It was October eighth, a few days after we\nleft, when the Greek press published orders prohibiting the Jews from leaving their place\nof residence. And if they were in another location, they were required to return to their\nplace of residence. So, it was as late as the beginning of October, 1943, when you could\nmove easily into the countryside.\nSeptember 14, 2010\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "A: Kremasta.",
        "A: Yes, yes, I remember that very vividly, yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, the main reason I went \u2014 well, first of all I\u2014 I was always very anxious to\naccompany my mother on these many expeditions that she went with my brother.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t like to be \u2014 she was a pillar of strength for me, and I \u2014I felt lonely \u2014 oh, my\nfather tried to entertain me and keep me busy, but I \u2014 I \u2014 and \u2014 and of course, for me it\nwas a mystery, all these villages, you know. Cause they would come back with many\nstories to tell about oh, how a sheep was slaughtered, you know, because the village \u2014 it\nwas done, and it was a big event, and the dogs were barking. There were a lot of\nadventures that my brother and mother had on these expeditions. And so I felt it was just\n\u2014 when my mother suggested that, I \u2014 I was thrilled. I had some sort of a rash between\nmy fingers, and \u2014 and my mother was really exhausted from her travels in the villages,\nand so she needed to recuperate somehow. So \u2014 and I was very thin, a-and the villagers\nhad this belief that the spa can cure anything, anything you had, whether it was a skin\nproblem or orthopedic problem, whatever you had. The place to go was in Kremasta.\nSeptember 14, 2010\nAnd so my mother one day, it was August, it was summer, she told me, you\u2019re coming\nwith me and it will be a nice place, we\u2019ll be by the river. And so we walked \u2014 we re \u2014 you\nwalked to every place, you didn\u2019t take a mule or anything like this, it wasn\u2019t very far.\nAnd we went to Kremasta, and this place was just teeming with people. There were a lot\nof partisans, ardat \u2014 andartes, recuperating andartes. Many of them were injured, and\nthey were recuperating there. There were villagers that had orthopedic problems, and they\nwould \u2014 would \u2014 would come to Kremasta for the baths. The baths were supposed to\ncure everything. And my mother st \u2014 I remember her saying how people would come\ncurled up in a basket on a mule, take the baths and then they would walk straight, you\nknow, without the assistance of a cane or anything. I mean, there were miraculous cures.\nSo we \u2014 we shared a room with another woman and her child, and we started going into\nthese baths, they were constructed of cement, and they would get filled up with this water\nthat was \u2014 smelled of sulfur, like rotten eggs. And my mother kept saying, well this is\nvery good, you know. I couldn\u2019t bear the smell \u2014 this is \u2014 this is very good for you. And\nth-the following day my fa \u2014 my brother joined us, and it was a sort of a nice, little\nvacation. But unfortunately came to an abrupt end when the captain of the unit of the\npartisans that were stationed in Kremasta announced that th-the \u2014 first of all, the\npartisans had to go back to their units, wherever they belonged, and the villa \u2014 villagers\nhad to go back home because the Germans were advancing towards that area. So, people\npanicked, they immediately stopped their baths and they started just a huge group of\nSeptember 14, 2010\npeople, some on canes or sticks \u2014 not canes, but sticks, or \u2014 or mules and horses, going\nback to their homes. And so when we reached the village with my mother and brother,\nthe village was in a state of excitement, because this time all of the villagers were going\nto leave the village. They \u2014 with their animals, because the \u2014 at this point the Germans\nhad become very aggressive towards the villagers, who at the beginning they were trying\nto appease, but now the villagers were supporting the resistance by providing them with\nshelter and food and so these \u2014 th-the Germans were carrying out retaliations against the\nvillagers by executing them, or burning the villages. So that was known, and so\neverybody was leaving the village with their animals. And my father was in the process\nof baking bread in the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 his famous homemade oven. And there was no time for the bread to \u2014 to \u2014 to bake\ncompletely. This reminds me of the exodus from Egypt, with Moses. And \u2014 and now we,\nagain we pack as many things as we possibly could. And this time we don\u2019t have any\nmules to transport things, so we have to travel light, with one blanket and very few food\nsupplies. And so everybody is leaving the village, and this time we go to another \u2014 a\nplace much higher than the earlier place of Chiandafelis. This place is called Kamaria.\nAnd so the entire village, with their animals, they camp this plateau at the top of the\nmountain, which offered a very good vantage point view of the villages below, not only\nPsilovrahos but the other surrounding villages. And so there we are, it\u2019s August, the sun\nSeptember 14, 2010\nis burning, there\u2019s no \u2014 they \u2014 we \u2014 we had brought the canteen, a small canteen full of\nwater, but it was very quickly exhausted. The villagers knew of a \u2014 a spring, which my\nbrother used to fill up the canteen again, but still not enough water. The villagers, because\nthey knew the terrain very well, and they were used to this rough terrain, they were able\nto discover other sources of water, but \u2014 but not us. So my father actually had to \u2014 to go\nfrom villager to villager begging for a little bit of water to fill the canteen. And I\nremember we were allowed only three gulps of water, you know, no more, because it had\nto last. The other problem was that we didn\u2019t have \u2014 we brought only one blanket and it\nwas very cold at night up at the top of the mountain, so my father borrowed a blanket\nfrom one of the villagers. And we decided \u2014 my parents decided that it would be best if\nwe didn\u2019t stay with the rest of the villagers, but went to a secluded place, so in case the\nGermans came to Kamaria, they wouldn\u2019t find us. So again we were separated, we were\nseparated from the rest of the villagers, and we found a secluded place and my mother or\nfather or Mykas(ph) caught a goat, a stray goat, and we milked it. So we had a little bit of\nmilk. And so we \u2014 we stayed in this place. Now, my mother was in \u2014 she was sick, she\nhad fever, she was in very, very bad shape, because she had gone to \u2014 to Kremasta to\nrecuperate from her ordeals, and now, all of a sudden, she has to go up to the mountains\nagain. And I \u2014 I remember this \u2014 my brother doesn\u2019t remember this, but my \u2014 but I do \u2014\nmy mother saying, if the Germans come here, Mykas(ph) will take Ninetta, climb a rock\nand then a tree. And Father should hide somewhere, and I will throw all of our\nSeptember 14, 2010\nbelongings off this \u2014 on the \u2014 off the precipice and I will get all \u2014 you know, fall off the\nprecipice as well, not to leave a trace of our presence there. And for me, you know my\nmother, who was a pillar of strength, to say such thing was a very \u2014 a very shaky \u2014 shook\nme up. And probably that\u2019s the reason why I remember it. So we \u2014 from \u2014 from this\nlocation, we were able to see fires being set on the villages below. And it was, you know,\none village after the other being set on fire, systematically. And they had reached our\nvillage, Psilovrahos, and they began to burn those houses as well. And \u2014 and it was \u2014 it\nwas horrible, because these people were very poor to begin with, and now they\u2019re losing\n\u2014 to lose their house and their household, it \u2014 it was awful. But then, suddenly, the fire\nstopped \u2014 the sa \u2014 fires in Psilovrahos. They had burned a few houses, but then the \u2014 the\nf\u2014 the fire stopped. And we didn\u2019t know what had happened, but later on \u2014 in fact, on my\nlast visit to Psilovrahos in 2005, some of the villagers told me what had happened. One\nof the villagers, his name was Bulumbashez(ph), a-an old, elderly person, became so\ninfuriated with what was happening, that he defied the danger and he started coming\ndown the m \u2014 the mountain with his cane and he had binoculars, creating a lot of\ncommotion as the rocks were tumbling down, and the two Germans with the torches that\nwere setting the houses on fire, they thought that the andartes were coming down. An-\nAnd so they stopped and left. And \u2014 and so this man really saved the village from \u2014 from\nbeing burned to the ground. So it \u2014 there\u2019s so many things that I learned afterwards, and\nat the time \u2014\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: \u2014 they were happening, but we didn\u2019t know what was happening. For example, that\nexplosion that we heard the first time that we had to leave the village at \u2014 at \u2014 that\nexplosion, we have an explanation now. We learned af-afterwards that the andartes in\nAgios Vlassis where they were supposed to stop the advance of the Germans, recognized\nthey didn\u2019t have enough forces and so they set the ammunition depot on fire, and so they\nex \u2014 that was the source of the explosion.",
        "A: But at the time, you hear sounds, we don\u2019t where \u2014 what the cause of it.",
        "A: Yes, yes \u2014",
        "A:\u2014 yes. And my mother suffered of an ear infection, and that also got better. I mean,\nthere\u2019s no doubt that these waters had \u2014 and \u2014 and mud had medicinal \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 factors, but \u2014",
        "A: Oh, yes. Do I remember that? That was a nightmare. That is a story in itself. The\nblanket that my father borrowed from one of the villagers in Kamaria was infested with\nlice. And so when the Germans retreated and the whole village returned, we came back,\nSeptember 14, 2010\nand suddenly our clothes, our hair was infested with lice. It was a horrible situation, and\nthere were no medicines, of course, to \u2014 and insecticides. So \u2014 and that again, I remember\nas a firsthand experience, how we went to a remote location. My parents had to borrow a\nlarge kettle and \u2014 and we had soap, so my parents, they washed all the clothes with soap,\nand then \u2014 and blankets, and everything, all of our possessions, and then they boiled them\nin water. They lit fire under this kettle and they boiled them to \u2014 to kill the lice. And we\nhad to dry our clothes and fortunately it was August, so it was easy to dry them. We\nwashed everything that we possessed. But unfortunately, I \u2014 I had the very thick, curly\nhair, and they \u2014 the lice were settled there \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 comfortably. And my mother \u2014 one way to \u2014 to control the lice is to crush the insect\nbetween your thumbnails and also crush the very tiny eggs that they lay on your hair\nstrands. But it was impossible, and I had to scratch like mad. And then my mother said\none day, what if I cut off this side of your hair? And I said yes. We didn\u2019t have mirrors,\nso I didn\u2019t know what I looked like. And it felt much better, so I said, let me cut the other\nside as well. So that felt better. Little by little she cut off all of my hair totally, totally.",
        "A: This I remember. And I remember that she put a hood on my head so the children\nwouldn\u2019t make fun of me. And the children, of course, you know, this is summer. They\u2019d\nask me \u2014\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: \u2014 why are you wearing a hood? And IJ said, I like hoods \u2014 and I don\u2019t remember what I\nsaid, but I didn\u2019t care what they said. I was really \u2014 it was a great, great relief. I\nremember this so vividly, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, she was able to wash my scalp easily, and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 so \u2014 but it was the hair where they had \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with lice,\nbut \u2014",
        "A: Greeks who lived to the \u2014 with the \u2014 the war period are very familiar with lice, it was\npandemic, it was [indecipherable]",
        "A: Of course, of course, of course.",
        "A: Yes.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, the \u2014 the \u2014 the villager, I don\u2019t know whether it was the owner of the house or\nanother villager, they gave my family a plot of land that had never been cultivated before,\nand it was full of rocks. It was a very, very rocky village. And so my father had to borrow\ngardening tools to hoe and shovel.",
        "A: This is \u2014 this was done in the spring, so this is before going up to Kamaria \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 because we started cultivating this piece of land in the s \u2014 in the spring. And so we\nhad to extract the rocks and my brother had to carry manure. That was another thing that\n\u2014 the villagers were \u2014 were willing to share whatever they had, so they had to share the\nma-manure from their animals and my brother would carry it on her \u2014 his back. And then\nmy father didn\u2019t know anything about gardening, but he learned quickly; he had to learn\nquickly. And so we made a garden, we planted onions and beans, maybe potatoes as well,\nI\u2019m not sure. So we did \u2014 we did get some \u2014 some food from the garden, not much.",
        "A: Yes.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. The first news about liberation reached us in \u2014 in September. There\nwere \u2014",
        "A: Of \u201944. There was this \u2014 the news that th-the Germans were being withdrawn \u2014 were \u2014\nwere with \u2014 withdrawing from Greece, because it didn\u2019t happen overnight.",
        "A: But my parents reaction was caution. They did not want to \u2014 to return right away, so\nthey wanted to wait until we were certain that the Germans had retreated from Agrinion.",
        "A: Did I know that? I don\u2019t think I knew that. I don\u2019t think I \u2014 I was conscious of that at\nall, no, it\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: It was in October when the Germans had \u2014 news had reached Agrinion that the\nGermans had retreated, and there were probably villagers that had gone into Agrinion\nand they witnessed that the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Germans indeed had \u2014 had left the city. And so we didn\u2019t all leave together to return\nto the city. First it was my father and mother that returned, because the house where we\nSeptember 14, 2010\nlived before the war was no longer available because the owner o-occupied the house.\nAnd so there was a housing shortage. There was always a housing shortage in Agrinion\nbecause the people preferred to grow tobacco than build houses. There were always\ntobacco fields everywhere, and it \u2014 it was a very big industry for Agrinion. After the war,\nthe family next door, that was their livelihood, planting and selling tobacco. So I know all\nabout the process of growing tobacco, from beginning to end, except for smoking, I never\nsmoked.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, Michael \u2014 Mike \u2014 Mykas(ph) \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and I stayed back, and he was supposed to be in charge of me and himself. And\napparently we must have eaten something that was stale or spoiled, and we both became\nill; very, very ill. I-It was \u2014 you know, having survived the war, here is a situation where\nwe could have lost our lives, had our parents not returned on time to \u2014 to rescue us.\nBecause I don\u2019t think any of the neighbors knew of our situation. We \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow what he cooked something that burned the pot, and then I don\u2019t know what kind of\nfood we ate, but we were very, very ill. But while my parents were in Agrinion, they\nreally had a hard time finding a house. And my mother in her memoirs describes their\nSeptember 14, 2010\nfirst night in \u2014 in the city. There were \u2014 we really did not look like city people any more.\nMy father had a long beard and he looked more like a partisan than a bank employee.\nAnd my mother was emaciated, and she was really transformed. And they were in the\nmain square, Letea(ph) Belu(ph) of Agrinion, and my mother describes how a friend of\nours approached them cautiously, because they looked vaguely familiar, and as he got\ncloser and closer, realized who they were. And he was overjoyed, because he was one of\nthe Agrinion residents that witnessed the incarceration of the Jews of Preveza and Arta\nin the warehouses of Papapetrou. And he probably thought that we also were among\nthem. So he was overjoyed. It was like he saw people who were resurrected. And he ba \u2014\nhe asked them where do you plan to spend the night, and then he \u2014 he suggested that they\nspend the night in the house of Mr. Zahoropoulos(ph), who was a bus driver, driving a\nbus from Agrinion to Athens. And he is the one who, when my mother and my brother\nwere leaving the house to go to the Bokoros house, he was on his way to our house, and\nhe encountered us on the street. And he said, oh, so Mrs. Matsas, I was just coming to\nyour house to tell you that the Jews of Athens have gone into hiding. See, he was \u2014 that\nwas his route. He was just returning from Athens and wanted to inform my family.",
        "A: So this is where my parents spent their first night back in Agrinion, and my mother\ndescribes how hospitable people were, and they \u2014 they tried to do everything they could\nto make them feel comfortable. So they had a hard time finding a house, but eventually\nSeptember 14, 2010\neither Mrs. Huropoulos(ph) or someone else suggested to my parents that they go to an\nagency which was run by \u2014 by [indecipherable] who were really at this point sort of in\ncontrol of the city and they sent my parents to this house. And the house had two levels,\nwe were going to occupy the lower level, with a very beautiful garden, which we found\nout later that the Italians had constructed. And when the landlady found out that we were\nJewish, she immediately went to this agency and said, why did you send me the Jews?\nAnd the young woman there, the employee said \u2014 said, close your mouth, and what\ndifference does it make whether you\u2019re Christian or Jewish? They\u2019re people. And \u2014 and\nso she \u2014 she had to \u2014 to tolerate us.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right. There\u2019s \u2014 there were some people who were not very supportive.",
        "A: No, it was a matter of days \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 days, days, yes.",
        "A: Sick in bed, hardly able to speak, and they quickly had to \u2014 you know, there was no\nmedicine they could give us, and they didn\u2019t even know what was wrong with us, but\nthey \u2014 they gave us some nourishment, which we lacked for \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 many days.",
        "A: And we recovered after a while, and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 we were revived, yes.",
        "A: Yes, then my \u2014 I \u2014 I believe they sent my brother first, with \u2014 with Baba(ph)\nYoros(ph) with a horse loa \u2014 load of food, because by then we had \u2014 having sold all these\nlittle dresses made out of the parachute, my mother had collected a lot of wheat. Because\nshe would sell dresses to people who didn\u2019t have wheat, but with a promise that when\nSeptember 14, 2010\nthey harvest, they would \u2014 she would be paid at harvest time. So now we have quite a bit\nof wheat to transport into the city. So \u2014 so my brother and \u2014 and this Baba(ph) Yoros(ph)\nand the mule, or horse, I don\u2019t know what it was, they come down into the city. I \u2014 I-\nI\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m glad that I\u2014 you asked me this question, because I didn\u2019t say anything about\nBaba(ph) Yoros(ph). There was a time, after the first time that \u2014 which was in November\n\u2014 when we had to leave Psilovrahos and go to Chiandafelis\u2019 house. There was another\ntime when we had to leave the village. I don\u2019t remember which month it was, but this\ntime my father and Mykas(ph) decided to leave the village, but my mother decided to\nstay, to guard whatever food we had. So my mother and I stayed in the house, and we\nwere joined by the wife of Mr. Lavee(ph), her name was [indecipherable], and she\nspoke German, and at one point she actually spoke with the Germans, and she claims that\nshe protected the upper village of Psilovrahos from the Germans. I don\u2019t know, this is a\nstory that I\u2019m not very clear on. But \u2014 so my mother and I slept in the room, and then\nearly next morning we hear a knock on the door. And we woke up, and there was\nBaba(ph) Yoros(ph), who was a neighbor, he was a retired policeman, and his son was a\npartisan. And Baba(ph) Yoros(ph) said to my mother, what are you doing here with your\nchild? If the Germans were to come to the village and \u2014 and take you and your child, I\nwill never, ever forgive myself. And so when my mother heard that, she ha \u2014 didn\u2019t have\nto hear anything more, she packed quickly and \u2014 and \u2014 and she packed more than \u2014 than\nshe could carry, and she \u2014 in her memoir she says how she \u2014 she didn\u2019t want to leave the\nSeptember 14, 2010\n\u2014 the things that she packed, which was food and \u2014 and a blanket, but at the same time\nshe realized that she couldn\u2019t carry it. And at that point, Mrs. Tsulamitsu(ph), this \u2014 the \u2014\nthe mother of this \u2014 of the seven daughters who my mother was tutoring and knitting and\ncrocheting and making lace, she appeared with her mule, and \u2014 and she saw my mother in\n\u2014 in this \u2014 in distress, and she said, oh don\u2019t worry, I will carry all of your belongings.\nAnd so, with her, we reached the upper village, and \u2014 and so this is how we stand this\ntime when the \u2014 the Germans \u2014 that was their second foray into our region, but this time\nthey never reached the village, and \u2014 and so \u2014 and so we all returned. So this is Baba(ph)\nYoros(ph) who played a significant part in \u2014 in our story. As I said, th-the people really \u2014\nthey tried to \u2014 to help in any way they \u2014 they could, including th-the priest. You know,\nwe \u2014 we used to go to the church, first of all to \u2014 not to show that we were any different\nthan the other villagers, and also to eat some food there, because whenever there was a \u2014\na memorial service, they would serve koliva, which is a mixture of boiled wheat and\npomegranates, cinnamon and sugar. It\u2019s a very nutritious, delicious thing, but we\u2019d go\nthere and \u2014 and the relatives of the deceased would give everybody a handful of this and\nso there was another source of food for us. And the priest, I don\u2019t remember his name.\nPapa Demetrius(ph), perhaps. I don\u2019t remember his name. He used to come to our house\nquite often, because he befriended my parents. And my mother would always serve him\ncoffee, which was a rare find, a ra \u2014 a re \u2014 a real treat for him. And he would chat with\nmy father. I don\u2019t know what they talked about, but we went to \u2014 attended even Easter\n100\nSeptember 14, 2010\nservices \u2014 Friday, Good Friday services. And this is the ttme when \u2014 I learned later on,\nyou know, after the war, I \u2014 I used to go to the church with my friends a lot. And so as I\nsaid earlier, I knew a lot more about the Christian religion than \u2014 than the Jewish religion.\nBut on Fridays, when Jesus has been crucified and \u2014 and he\u2019s dead, and the priest is\nsupposed to exhort his flock to \u2014 to move them, that this wonderful human being\nsacrificed his \u2014 his life t-to save you. He\u2019s \u2014 and so he would \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he would ha \u2014\nhe had to give a sermon to make people cry, especially the old women cry, and so he had\nto go on and on with the crucifixion and the pain that he suffered on the cross. And so\nSunday they celebrated Easter, the resurrection, he came to our house and apologized to\nmy parents for having to give this kind of sermon in front of us. So 1-it was, of course,\nappreciated by my parents. He was a kind man, and he said, what can I do? I\u2019m expected\nto do that, I\u2019m expected to give this kind of sermon. So now, go back to my brother and\nBaba(ph) Yoros(ph), they\u2019re returning to the villa \u2014 to Agrinion. And so my \u2014 my\nbrother arrived with \u2014 with food, to Agrinion. And then, after a few days, my parents and\nI came down into the city.",
        "A: The food ca \u2014 we recovered the food in the bank, was \u2014",
        "A: Yes, whatever food was \u2014\n101September 14, 2010",
        "A: \u2014 was available, stored, it was returned. Then they established \u2014 the EAM-ELAS\nestablished ETA, which was an organization to distribute food, and they made my father\nin charge of it, and my father was very, very proud of this task because he felt he was part\nof the resistance, part of ELAS - EAM-ELAS, yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Almost right away, yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. And the \u2014 the sad thing 1s that the \u2014 th-the country is polarized. It was\npolarized before the war, but now even more. And Agrinion was dominated by the \u2014 by\nthe people that were members of EAM-ELAS, and their personal friends that had joined\nthe resistance, EAM-ELAS. And there \u2014 there are trials that are taking place. It is an\nabsolutely horrible situation. Th-The people are drained from the war experience with the\nGermans, and now they have to confront the civil war, where literally brothers are\nfighting each other. There were \u2014 there were people belonged to the same family, and yet\nideologically they were \u2014",
        "A: Different places, yes.\n102September 14, 2010",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Right. Long time.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right. Again, my life, my personal life as a child growing up was rather undisturbed. I\n\u2014 I was \u2014 you know, I was imbued with all these ideas of social justice and freedom, that\nhad been absorbed. You know, I would hear this all around me. People that admired, and\nhad fought s \u2014 and \u2014 during the \u2014 the \u2014 you know, y \u2014 they had joined the resistance, they\nwere my heroes. The people in EAM-ELAS, they were the ones who saved us. So I-I had\nno \u2014 I \u2014 for me, those were the people I was \u2014",
        "A: I was rooting for them. The father of my friends, my best friends, who by the way,\nthey lived across the street from us, Dr. Papethadoro(ph) and the three daughters, they\n103\nSeptember 14, 2010\nlived across the street. I admired him and \u2014 and I knew that his relatives and friends, they\nwere \u2014 I knew the side they were with. So I just was sent to school, like \u2014 like all the\nother children, but I was \u2014 I was sent to the third elementary school, which served the \u2014\nthe children who lived in the outskirts of the city and the surrounding villages. So my\nfriends were these children who came from the surrounding villages, and by comparison,\nI was from a middle class family, and I was sort of a more sophisticated person. So I \u2014 I\nha \u2014 I always had the idea that my family was rich. We weren\u2019t, at all. But because my\nfriends and \u2014 and \u2014 and classmates were from the surrounding villages, who were\nimpoverished. But my association \u2014 a-and \u2014 and my friends, Dr. Papethadoro\u2019s(ph)\ndaughters went to the fourth elementary school, which served the city children. These\nwere girls who celebrate \u2014 had birthday parties. I had never heard of a birthday party.",
        "A: But they had birthday parties and they invited their friends, and they would have very\ngood food, and they lived in the heart of the city. We lived in the outskirts. So there was\nthis \u2014 so I remember this very vividly, of course, because I was already, you know, six,\nseven, eight, nine years old. And \u2014 but my association with the daughters of Dr.\nPapethadoro(ph) was something that enriched my life and opened worlds that I wasn\u2019t\naware of. They \u2014 they had a record player, I remember, and they had a few records of\nclassical music. And we would listen to the music, and we would make plays with \u2014 write\nthe plays and produce them for the neighborhood children. And this \u2014 the \u2014 my friend\n104September 14, 2010\nHera, who \u2014 she\u2019s going to give a lecture in just a few days on art, she would make all\nthe costumes and the scenery. And \u2014 and my friend became eventually a professional\nactress, my best friend. So it was a\u2014a very rich and happy childhood that I had, th-\nthanks to \u2014 to my assoc \u2014 my friendship with this family.",
        "A: Such as what?",
        "A: Yes, yes, oh yes \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 definitely.",
        "A: Yeah, yes, and \u2014 and I very vividly remember a painting that their father \u2014 an oil\npainting that the father had done, and it was prominently displayed 1n their living room.\nBut I became a part of the family, they jokingly would say, oh, this is our fourth\ndaughter. And they were just beautiful people.",
        "A: No.\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: \u2014no, not at all, they were actually very grateful, because my mother, when we\nreturned to the city, she \u2014 well, a few days after we returned, a trickling of survivors\nbecome \u2014 began to pass through Agrinion, and among them cousins who had joined the\npartisans. These are cousins that escaped in Larisa(ph) and they joined the partisans and\nthis is where they spent the war years. And they were returning home not knowing what\nhappened to their families. They had absolutely no idea what had happened. So my\nmother, after these cousins returned, she decided to go to Ioannina. And at this point, we\ndon\u2019t know what has happened to them. This is early on. Cause we didn\u2019t find out what\nhappened until \u2014 see, this is October 1944. We didn\u2019t find out the war ended in the spring\nof \u00b045, so we didn\u2019t know what was happening. So my mother decided to travel to\nIoannina, and this is a heartbreaking experience for her because she goes into the homes\nof her sisters, Eftyhia and Annetta(ph). Th-They had \u2014 they lived in Ioannina, they\nwere married there, they had children. And these houses are occupied by villagers who\nhad \u2014 whose villages had been devastated and they were coming into the city. They had\nbeen devastated because of the civil war. And there was nothing wrong with them\noccupying those houses, but for \u2014 for \u2014 for my mother \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it was really horrible. She was knocking on the doors and \u2014 and they opened the\ndoor and these strange faces were there, occupying her sisters\u2019 homes. And my cousin\nSam, he was one of the young men who escaped and joined the resistance \u2014 Sam\n106\nSeptember 14, 2010\nMeyer(ph) was his name, he was the son of my Aunt Rezina(ph). Rezina(ph) was one of\nmy father\u2019s sisters. He kept on trying to console my mother, saying, you have me, you\nhave \u2014 Aunt Esther \u2014 Esthere(ph), you have me now. I'll take care of you; you have me.\nAnd he himself didn\u2019t know where his family was, where his parents were. Yet for \u2014 for\nmy mother it was an absolutely horrible, horrible time. So when she returned from\nIoannina, she wanted to occupy herself with whatever she could. Something that would\ntake her out of the house. And so she \u2014 oh, she says in her memoirs that while she was in\nIoannina, she met a merchant who was smuggling fabrics from Albania. And she\ndiscovered that the person who was providing him with the fabrics, was none else but her\nfather. Her father, in Delvina(ph), in al \u2014 Albania where he still had his fabric store\nbecause wa \u2014 he was still a merchant, because the Jews of Albania, even though they\nwent into hiding, they were never deported, and so they all survived. And y \u2014 in fact, my\ngrandparents never left the city of Delvina(ph) and the Germans occupied their house\nbecause it was a nice house. So they were never \u2014 never disturbed by the Germans. And\nthere were other European Jews that had come to Albania to survive, but so \u2014 so the\nsmuggler gave the idea that it\u2019s possible to \u2014 to get fabrics from Albania. And in fact, she\ngot some fabrics from him and told him, when you go back to Albania, have my father\npay you for the fabrics, because we didn\u2019t have any money, either. My father had not\nbeen paid in cash yet. There was no cash to be found, everything was bartering. So this is\nhow my mother started becoming a merchant. And for her it was a lifesaving activity\n107\nSeptember 14, 2010\nbecause it brought her out of the house with \u2014 had to trans \u2014 transactions with the public.\nAnd I remember, she also smoked at that time, which was not common for women to\nsmoke. It was sort of \u2014 people looked down on this.",
        "A: But it was her state, psychological state was such that she probably experienced some\nrelief smoking. So she found a shoemaker, not far from our house. And she noticed that\nthere were some empty shelves there, and she said, do you mind if I bring some fabric\nhere and I \u2014 I sell 1t to the customers? And she said no, it\u2019s okay. So this is where she\nstarted going into business, becoming a merchant. And of course for her, becoming \u2014\nbeing a merchant was second nature because she had learned all of this in her father\u2019s\nstore in Albania. This didn\u2019t last very long because the owner of the shoemaker\u2019s store,\nshe was \u2014 became angry when she discovered that he \u2014 he was subletting the store to\nsomebody else. And my mother didn\u2019t want to make a fuss, so she removed the fabrics\nand she opened a small store in another location. But she was very, very successful,\nbecause \u2014 because of the civil war, these village women were coming from the villages\nthat were being devastated, into the city. And they were too shy to go to a store run by a\nman. They were too shy to talk with a man and transact business with \u2014 with \u2014 with a\nman, so they would flock to my mother, who was \u2014 then started dyeing less expensive\nfabrics. The fabrics that she brought from Albania were silk and really high class fabrics,\nwhich the villagers could not afford to buy. So she started buying less expensive fabrics\n108\nSeptember 14, 2010\nand she started traveling by herself, which was quite daring for a woman at that time, to\nPatress(ph) another city, to buy supplies and sell them to the villagers. So she was very,\nvery successful.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: Yes, yes, but in talking with my mother in later years, she told me how \u2014 how\nimportant it was for her to \u2014 to \u2014 to do this. And my parents did not talk about \u2014 you\nknow, throughout this period, until \u2014 until the war ended in Europe, we maintained hope\nthat they were going to come back. We didn\u2019t know about the camps of extermination,\nthe Final Solution. All of this was totally unknown to us. And it was in the spring of 1945\nwhen survivors \u2014 survivors of concentration camps \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 started trickling into the \u2014 int \u2014 in Greece. And among them was my father\u2019s\nbrother, Mikhail(ph) or Michael Matsas. He had lost his wife Rebecca, and his son.\nAnd then there were first cousins; my cousin Nina, who still lives in Ioannina, who I\nsaw on my last trip. And then there was my cousin Eftyhia and Sandra. So these were th\n109September 14, 2010\n\u2014 just a handful of people, handful of relatives who \u2014 who came back, and they tried to\npiece their lives together. It was \u2014 1t was a horrible time.",
        "A: I-I think it was when \u2014 when these concentration camp survivors returned, I became\nconscious of concentration camps, not through the people themselves, because they never\ntalked about their experiences. They never talked. Even my cousin Nina, who I saw in\n2005, I \u2014 I had seen her many, many times before while I was living in Greece, but never\ndared ask a question, until on my last visit, two thou \u2014 in 2005, and that was the first time\nthat she talked about it to me. This is a whole lifetime \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 of silence. It was too horrible for them to talk about.\n110September 14, 2010\nBeginning Tape Nine",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Exactly. Not from survivors, relatives or friends who had survived. It was from other\nsources, not from them. And when I was visiting Nina, I remember she \u2014 I stayed with\nher f-for a number of days, and every morning she would serve breakfast, and I wanted to\nask her \u2014 and every morning I\u2019d say no, maybe she \u2014 she doesn\u2019t want to talk about it.\nUntil at one point, I don\u2019t remember exactly how it came up, she said to me, you know, I\nwas interviewed by Steven Spielberg\u2019s project. And \u2014 and I said, you did? A-And \u2014 and\n\u2014 and I \u2014 and this was the first time that I realized that she had talked about it. This is in\nIoannina now, there used to be \u2014 there used to be two synagogues before the war. One\nwas demolished and the adjacent school, the Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle was torn\ndown, and they used that spot \u2014 land to build an apartment house for the Jews from\nIoannina who survived either by going up in the mountains, or concentration camp\nsurvivors. And they live in that apartment house on Josef Elijia Street. And that is the\nname of \u2014 of a Greek Jewish poet from Ioannina, they named the street after him. But\nthe \u2014 the horrible thing that I discovered on \u2014 after I made a tour of the \u2014 of the\nneighborhood where my aunt \u2014 my cousin pointed out all the houses of our relatives. This\nSeptember 14, 2010\nis where Aunt ri\u2014 Annetta(ph) and Aunt Eftyhia lived, and where my grandparents\nlived. When I returned to the apartment house, I saw this graffiti written in an\nungrammatical way, saying, you die at 17 and we bury you at 70. It was obviously an\nanti-Semitic graffiti on this building that houses the remnants of that thriving community.\nThis is a community that numbered 2,000 \u2014 almost 2,000 Jews. An ancient community\nthat had existed there for many, many centuries. And there are th \u2014 a handful of people\nwho live in this apartment house with painful memories, and they have to \u2014 to read this\nevery day. So I asked her, why don\u2019t you \u2014 why don\u2019t you hire somebody to erase it? And\nsaid, we do it, and \u2014 and they come back, and they come back. I-It was \u2014 so my \u2014 my\nknowledge of concentration camps was not from our relatives that survived, yes.",
        "A: They always talked about our adventure in the mountains, always. And they didn\u2019t put\nit down on paper until they were in the United States already. And it was really, as my\nfather says in his memoirs, always the driving force behind us. Because by then my\nbrother had two daughters, and I had the daughter, and we realized that they had this\ntreasure of information that should be recorded. And so we both, ma \u2014 my brother\nMykas(ph) and I urged them to \u2014 to write down their memoirs. And I promised my father\nSeptember 14, 2010\nI was going to translate them, and I did. But my mother, I do remember the stories she\ncame back with after her first visit of Ioannina, when she went to visit her sisters\u2019 house,\nEftyhia and Annetta(ph), they were both married, and they had, each of them, two\ndaughters. And they \u2014 and she said that the neighbors \u2014 there was also a woman,\nStavrypoulo(ph) I believe, who occupied my aunts\u2019 house at the time, and she was a\nmistress of one of the German officers who lived in my aunt\u2019s house, Aunt Eftyhia\u2019s\nhouse. And my aunt \u2014 my uncle \u2014 Aunt Eftyhia\u2019s husband Naseem(ph) Samwheel(ph)\nwas a dentist, and they were well-off, they had a very pretty house, very comfortable.\nAnd so the German officer chose to \u2014 their \u2014 that house to live in. And my aunt would\nserve him meals every day. She was actually expecting a child, and yet she had to go up\nand down to serve him. And my mother learned this story when she came to Ioannina\nthat first visit after the war, that the \u2014 this German officer asked my aunt to bring more\nwine that na \u2014 particular night. And she said, tomorrow we don\u2019t know who lives and\nwho dies. And so she brought more wine, it was a very sumptuous meal that she had\nprepared. And it was the very next day, March 21% \u2014 25\" \u2014 March 25\", when they\nrounded up the Jews of Ioannina \u2014 of Ioannina. They had to be awakened very early in\nthe morning. It was an unusually cold day, it was actually snowing. And \u2014 and they\nknocked the door very early in the morning, 5:30 in the morning, people were still\nsleeping, and they told them, you have, you know, 60 minutes to pack and assemble in\nthe sert \u2014 in a square by the \u2014 by the lake, Pamvotis Lake, of Ioannina. And this is what\n113September 14, 2010\nthey did, and \u2014 and so my aunt \u2014 this 1s all totally unexpected, because up until that point,\nthings were relatively calm in the city, and so this was an unsuspecting Jewish population\nthat all of a sudden is rounded up. And so my aunt approached the \u2014 this German officer,\nand said, we too? You know, you lived with us, and I served you so many meals, we too?\nHe said, yes, you too. And my uncle was still shaving, and it was a very \u2014 a horrible situa\n\u2014a horrible scene that my mother described. And now in retrospect, when I think \u2014 when\nI think of it, it\u2019s very, very painful. Because I can \u2014 I can just picture now my\ngrandparents being awakened early in the morning, in their later years 1n their lives; small\nchildren, pregnant women, they had to \u2014 to pack. What \u2014 what could \u2014 they didn\u2019t know\nwhat to pack, what to bri \u2014 they didn\u2019t know where they were going. And when I bring\nthat scene in my mind, I \u2014 I can\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s so painful, so painful. And then my grandmother\nwas a very kind person. She was \u2014 she had many children and she was a self-trained\nmidwife. And she was a \u2014 and \u2014 and my grandfather had a lot of transactions with the\nvillagers, because he used to buy milk from them. So she would \u2014 so they had a lot of\npeople that they knew in the villages, and whenever a woman was expecting a child, they\nwould always ask my mother \u2014 my grandmother to come and help her deliver the baby.\nSo my grandmother would always go around the neighborhood collecting baby clothes\nand food for \u2014 for the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the mother, the young mother and the baby. And so\nshe was that kind of person. And why was she taken away\u201d? There was a \u2014 a book that\nsomeone wrote, I can\u2019t remember her name right now, about the Jewish community of\n114\nSeptember 14, 2010\nIoannina, and the deportation. And she interviewed survivors that were brought in in the\nsame \u2014 the same truck with my grandmother. No, actually the same \u2014 they were\ntransported by trucks from Ioannina to Larisa(ph), and from Larisa(ph) in boxcars to\nAuschwitz. And these women survived the concentration camps and they were\ninterviewed by the author of this book, and they happened to be riding in the same\nboxcar. And their \u2014 a relative of theirs was expecting a baby, and her mother-in-law was\nfrantic, because what are we going to do? How 1s the \u2014 the mother and the baby going to\nsurvive? And \u2014 and they quoted my grandmother, saying, d-don\u2019t worry, Ill deliver the\nbaby. I know all about babies, I\u2019ll take care of you. So I don\u2019t know whether she\ndelivered \u2014 whether she delivered the baby in the boxcar, or when they arrived in the\nconcentration camp. But I do know that they were among the first people to \u2014 to go to the\ngas chambers, because they \u2014 they had \u2014 they \u2014 they took the elderly and the very young\nto the gas chambers. And so that was the end of these wonderful people. It\u2019s something\n[indecipherable] my brother and I live with this \u2014 this pain all our lives. And it\u2019s just \u2014\nthere\u2019s no \u2014 there\u2019s just no answer, there\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s no answer, and \u2014 and what makes it\nso painful for \u2014 for us 1s that there was a possibility they could have been s \u2014 they could\nhave survived, they could have \u2014 it was late enough in the war. The countryside was free.\nThe partisans were there. They could ha \u2014 Greece is a mountainous country, they could\nhave left, they could have survived. And it didn\u2019t happen. It \u2014 it\u2019s a\u2014 we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll just\nnever \u2014 we\u2019ll never rest. I-It\u2019s a pain we\u2019ll never \u2014 always carry with us. When I went to\n115\nSeptember 14, 2010\nIoannina in 2005, I went to the synagogue, the only remaining synagogue inside the \u2014\nthe walls, the castle, th-the frourio, as they call it, that\u2019s still standing there, and it was\nrenovated thanks to the generosity of American women o-of that background. And the\nwalls are lined with marble plaques on which the names of all the victims, all the people\nwho were deported, on marble plaques with the day of \u2014 the date of their birth \u2014 the\nnames and the date of their birth. And th-the entire synagogue interior is \u2014 1s covered\nwith these plaques. It was my Uncle Mikhail(ph) that the \u2014 a younger brother of my\nfather, wa \u2014 he\u2019s a survivor of the concentration camp, he\u2019s the one who collected all the\ninformation; the names, the occupations, date of births of all the people who perished,\nand then they etched their names in marble an-and \u2014 and there is a \u2014 it\u2019s a\u2014a good\nmonument, you know, a way to remember them. But it 1s \u2014 it is so painful to think \u2014\nwhen I was in that synagogue, I \u2014 I had already learned a lot about the history of \u2014 of the\ncommunity, and how rich their lives were, rich in \u2014 in long traditions, they \u2014 these\nunchanged traditions for hundreds of years. And it all perished overnight, literally\novernight. So with \u2014 with my aunt \u2014 with my cousin Nina, when we were in the\nsynagogue, and Mr. Samwheel(ph), who joined the partisans during the war, and this is\nhow he survived, he joined them as a young man. Now, when I visited he was an elderly\nperson. But he \u2014 he had a beautiful voice, and he knew how to play a musical instrument.\nAnd he took it upon himself to \u2014 to learn the liturgy, because he\u2019s the one who condu \u2014\nconducts services in the synagogue, only very few times, on like Yom Kippur. That is\n116\nSeptember 14, 2010\nwhen relatives and friends from other cities in Greece, they come to the synagogue. And\nso \u2014 so he \u2014 he chants the liturgy. And while we were there, the three of us; my cousin\nNina, a survivor of Auschwitz; he, a partisan; and I, we recited Kaddish. And it was the\nmost memorable moment of my life. And when I looked at the wall, there were the names\nof our relatives, and \u2014 and cousins that were my age when they were taken. And I s-sort\nof \u2014I\u2014I-\u2014TI appreciate life. I\u2019m very conscious that I was \u2014 I was just very, very, very\nlucky to survive. So I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m one of the very few \u2014 among the very few Greek Jewish\nsurvivors. And \u2014 and now I\u2019m \u2014 we\u2019re \u2014 I\u2019m eternally grateful to whoever ever helped us\nto survive those terrible years. And there were many people with small acts of \u2014 of \u2014 just\na kind word here and there, or giving us a sip of water up in Kamaria, or \u2014 or the\nblanket, 1n spite of the lice, they \u2014 they shared everything they had, and I am \u2014 we\u2019re the\n\u2014 eternally grateful t-to them an-and to the place of Psilovrahos. Psilovrahos is a very\nspecial, special, very special place for me. I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: Yes. That is \u2014",
        "A: No.\n117\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: No, not at all, 1t was \u2014 it is the loss that is so painful, the loss, and \u2014 and knowing that\n\u2014 that there\u2019s nothing you can do, and \u2014 and it isn\u2019t, you know, th \u2014 you know, people\nthink that, you know, da \u2014 time will \u2014 will \u2014 will heal the wound, and that is not so. Not\nfor me.",
        "A: Yes, I do. And \u2014 a-and it\u2019s such an enormous loss. And a-as \u2014 as I advance in years,\nall I can do, I feel, is talk \u2014 talk about it so that people will remember them. They will\nhave a memory of their names, at least, they existed. They were kind people. So when my\nAunt Rebecca, who was my father\u2019s youngest sister, and she and her family survived in\nEgypt, see, because they lived in Alexandria during the war, then after the\n[indecipherable] took over, and they had to \u2014 to leave Egypt, they came to Paris. Well,\nshe came to visit us about maybe 10 years ago. And she had left Ioannina when she was\n17 years old. She got married to my Uncle Laylee(ph), and then they moved to \u2014 to\nAlexandria, Egypt. So she would come back to visit her family. So she retained that\nperiod of \u2014 of \u2014 of the family as though it was encased in amber. I always thought of that,\nthat \u2014 that 1t was like time stood still for her for that period. And so she would \u2014 she had\nso many stories to tell about my father\u2019s brothers and sister, about their wives, their \u2014\ntheir families, all of their \u2014 their lives. And she was a very articulate person and she loved\nto talk and I spent a lot of time with her. And then one day I realized, she 1s a treasure\ntrove of information. And so I asked her if she would be willing for me to interview her\n118\nSeptember 14, 2010\nusing the family album. And even though it was \u2014 I know it was painful for her to talk\nabout her brothers and their families and her sister that perished, an-and her parents, she \u2014\nshe let me interview her. I was not a professional interviewer, of course, but I \u2014 I really\ntreasure the information that she gave me, because for a brief period of time, she brought\nthese people to life. And they were \u2014 they had their own achievements in life, their own\ndisappointments and \u2014 and while in life perhaps they were ordinary people, having\nperished the way they did, they became extraordinary.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Thank you for giving me the opportunity.",
        "A: Thank you.\nEnd of Tape Nine\n119September 14, 2010\nBeginning Tape Ten",
        "A: Start with my grandparents, perhaps?",
        "A: Okay. This is my grandfather Noam(ph). Noam(ph) Matsas. And this is my\ngrandmother Sarah, or Serena(ph) Matsas.",
        "A: Then now we can go to my \u2014 this is my father. My father and his younger brother, I\ncan\u2019t remember his name at this moment.",
        "A: And this is Raphael, is Raphael.",
        "A: Raphael a brother, yeah, these are all brothers and sisters of my father. This is my\nAunt Rozina(ph), my father\u2019s sister Rozina(ph). This is his youngest sister Rebecca.\nThis is Raphael.",
        "A: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Or no, wait. I-\u2019m sorry Elijusaf(ph) is the one on the left, extreme left, yes. And then\nthis is Hore(ph). His name, his real name is Yeshuah(ph), but he was known as\n120September 14, 2010\nHore(ph), the Hore(ph), the firstborn. And this is Elias, and this is Mikhail(ph). This is\nmy Uncle Mikhail(ph) who survived the concentration camp.",
        "A: This is my Aunt Annetta(ph), this is a sister of my mother, and her husband. This is a\nsister who was married in Ioannina \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and her \u2014 had two children, two daughters.",
        "A: She was deported. All of the people in these photographs \u2014 in this particular\nphotograph had been deported.",
        "A: This is my Aunt Eftyhia, sister of my mother, and her husband Naseem(ph)\nSamwheel(ph), he\u2019s a dentist. And it is in their house where the German officer stayed.",
        "A: Yes. And this is her wedding picture. And down below is Graziela(ph), my cousin\nGraziela(ph), she\u2019s the daughter of my Aunt Eftyhia, yes.",
        "A: Yes.\n121\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: And this is another photograph, a later photograph of my Aunt Eftyhia, yeah, the\nsame person.",
        "A: This 1s a picture depicting the deportation of the Jews of \u2014 of Ioannina. And this\nparticular portion of the photograph happens to have relatives of ours. This one is \u2014 we\nidentified it\u2019s Sam, my cousin Sam. She \u2014 he 1s the son of my Aunt Rozina(ph), who we\n\u2014 who we saw earlier in the family picture of my father. This is my Uncle Naseem(ph),\nhusband of Eftyhia, who is my mother\u2019s sister, in whose house the German officer\nresided. I don\u2019t know if this person was identified. Possibly \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, this is another person that we were able to identify.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it was a relative.",
        "A: And this is my Uncle Elijusaf(ph), brother of my grandfather. And then there\u2019s a \u2014\njust a very small portion of the head of someone, we\u2019re not really sure who that person is\nbehind Uncle Elijusaf(ph).",
        "A: This 1s a picture that has the name Psilovrahos. This is the entrance to the village\nPsilovrahos.\n122\nSeptember 14, 2010",
        "A: And the one above 1s sort of a picture taken from a distance that shows \u2014 the village is\nlocated at the bottom of this hill, or mountain. And it explains actually, the name of the \u2014\nthe village, the \u2014 Psilovrahos means high rock, and one can tell easily why the village\nwas named high rock. This is a very precipitous kind of mountain.",
        "A: It was not as high as \u2014 as that, but \u2014 but this is the mountain, yes.",
        "A: This picture was taken in \u2014 on my first visit to Psilovrahos in 1991, and that\u2019s me\nsitting in front of the door, the entrance to the room where we spent a year in\nPsilovrahos. And then over on the left, and \u2014 on the left of that same picture.",
        "A: Yeah, there. This is the exact location, a little bit below, where my father constructed\nthis primitive oven, with clay oven, right there.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: This shows the entrance to the room. The \u2014 the building material is stone; as you can\nsee, there\u2019s plenty of stone, plenty of rocks there. And this is the interior of the room.\nYou can see the narrow window, and \u2014 and the fireplace that was used. It\u2019s a little bit\n123September 14, 2010\ncovered with a cloth, but is a source of heat and cooking for us. And this is where my\nfather mounted the \u2014 this contraption with the \u2014 the rubber strips, that we were burning\nfor lighting.",
        "A: And \u2014 and the \u2014 the contraption is still there. Things don\u2019t change \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 very fast in these villages.",
        "A: This is Marika(ph) Surpano(ph). Here \u2014 she is the wife of the man in whose family\nhouse we stay \u2014 th-this \u2014 his family, his \u2014 her husband\u2019s family is the one that was\nrenting this room to us. And Marika(ph) Surpano(ph) was there when I visited the\nvillage in 1991, and recognized me, and it was a very, very emotional reunion.",
        "A: That is the very same house, yes, that we saw earlier. This is a fountain in Houni. This\nis the village where the taxi brought us, and is a fountain constructed by Italian soldiers at\nsome point during the occupation.",
        "A: This is taken in Ioannina, and it is the \u2014 called the frourio, it\u2019s sort of reinforced\nwalls of the original city of Ioannina. And this is where, in these thick walls \u2014 these thick\nwalls were used as a shelter during the air raids by \u2014 by the Italians during the Greek-\n124\nSeptember 14, 2010\nItalian war. And the Jews \u2014 the synagogue that still survives is inside the frourio. Behind\nthese walls is the synagogue.",
        "A: These two pictures depict the same building. They\u2019re taking in Agrinion. They are the\ntobacco warehouses, Papapetrou tobacco warehouses. This is where the Jews of Arta\nand Preveza were taken before they boarded the trains to Auschwitz.",
        "A: This 1s the first photograph my parents took of themselves in \u2014 they actually went to a\nphoto studio, soon as they returned from Psilovrahos, the very first day they arrived,\nafter the liberation.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: A house, yes.",
        "A: This is an I.D., my father\u2019s I.D., that was issued by German authorities. In the village,\nmy parents obtained baptismal papers from, I guess the priest, and they sent these\ndocuments to Agrinion and they were issued the I.D. cards by the German authorities.\nThe names have been changed to sound more like Greek Christian names. Names of my\ngrandparents are mentioned there, and \u2014 and my parents\u2019 names are mentioned but they\n125September 14, 2010\nhave all been changed to sound more Christian Greek. The interesting thing about these\nI.D.s is that there\u2019s no mention of religion, which is quite interesting.",
        "A: This is my family. This is a post-war picture, depicting my brother on \u2014 Mykas(ph),\nor Mike on the left, my mother, my father and me. I\u2019m \u2014 we don\u2019t have very much\nmoney to buy good clothes, but somehow we managed to look presentable. But I do wear\na pair of shoes that I borrowed from my friend Ephemia(ph), from the\nPapatheordoro(ph) family. And of course I have my huge bow perched on my head. It\nwas \u2014 it was the latest in fashion for little girls.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know the exact year, but I believe that it was perhaps \u201946 \u2014 \u00b046 or \u201947, I\u2019m not\nsure.",
        "A: These are two fragments of stalactites from the \u2014 the cave of Arapo(ph) Kefalas(ph),\nwhere we had to hi \u2014",
        "A: This was in \u2014 in Psilovrahos. And the date is November fifth, 1s 1t? That was probably\nthe day \u2014 1943. That was probably the day that we were in that cave.\nEnd of Tape 10\nConclusion of Interview\n"
