        "Question: Good morning, Hedy.",
        "Answer: Hi.",
        "Q: It\u2019s really lovely to see you after all these years, we met --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- maybe what? 10 years ago, I think.",
        "A: Right. I think you\u2019 re right.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s really lovely. Hedy, what was your name -- what is your name now? Tell us your\nname now.",
        "A: Well, sort of formally and legally, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s Hedwig C. Rose. On my passport it\u2019s Hedwig\nCohen Rose. I do have another middle name, it sort of got dropped along the way, which is\nHella. So I was Hedwig Hella Cohen, and then became Rose after I was married.",
        "Q: So, at birth you were Hedwig Hella --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Cohen.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Right. And when were you born?",
        "A: February eighth, 1936.",
        "Q: And where?",
        "A: In Amsterdam, in The Netherlands.",
        "Q: Right. Now, I -- I have no idea whether it\u2019s possible to do this, but as we\u2019re speaking, since\nyou were such a young person, if there\u2019s a way for you to distinguish what you really remember",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- as that kid, versus what you were told later, if there\u2019s a way of doing that as we speak --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- 1t would be -- it would be very helpful.",
        "A: I think so. Of course, it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess how accurate I am about that.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But it\u2019s -- it\u2019s certainly true that I am able to at least comment about what I think are later\ndeductions as opposed to early memories, mm-hm. Be glad to do that.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk a little bit about your family, your -- let\u2019s talk first about your father, who has one\nof those longest names that I\u2019ve ever heard in my life. Can you give us his full name?",
        "A: Jacque Theobold Alfred Karl Cohen. Did I leave out one? Oh, Frederick --",
        "Q: Jacque Theobold Alfred Karl --",
        "A: I may have left out --",
        "Q: Frederick.",
        "A: Frederick, right, Cohen.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Where do all these names come from, do you know?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know because my paternal grandparents had already died when I was old enough to\nremember anything as a toddler. So I have no idea where they came from. It may also have been\nthe fashion at the time to give people more than -- although that\u2019s not really true because my\nuncle who was born in Vienna, only had one name. So maybe it had to do with Sephardic as\nopposed to Ashkenazic Jews. Maybe it had to do with Holland versus Austria. Maybe it had to\ndo with whatever the background of my father\u2019s parents was, which I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know\nwhat their occupation was or anything.",
        "Q: Do you remember if he was called Jacque? Was he known by his first name, or --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: He was?",
        "A: He was.",
        "Q: And what did he do?",
        "A: He actually was a baker, but a baker in American parlance has sort of -- sort of a vague\nmeaning, but the kind of baker he was, was one of these European bakers who did all these\nspecialty desserts. And he -- I only recently learned from my sister, my older sister, that he was a\nbaker on the Holland-America line. And apparently before he was married, he -- that\u2019s what he\ndid. And at some point, I don\u2019t exactly know where in -- in the yearly chronology, he decided he\nwasn\u2019t going to do this any more. And they prevailed on him to do it once more, and do it once\nmore, and I guess he did it, he did -- went one more trip and they said we want you to take one\nmore trip, and I -- I guess he put his foot down and said, I\u2019m not doing it any more. And the --\nthat voyage, that ship that he said no to apparently was detonated by some torpedo that was left\nover from World War I. So that whatever it was, fate, whatever, saved him when he decided no,\nhe wasn\u2019t going to do this any more. But that\u2019s what he did. And he had a bakery in Amsterdam,\nbut I was never there, and we had already moved from there when I was born.",
        "Q: So when you were born, did he have the bakery?",
        "A: I think he still owned the bakery, but he didn\u2019t work at it. And I -- I know that he left the\nhouse every day, but I\u2019m not really sure where he went.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And the only baking that I was familiar with was what he did on Sunday mornings. It was\ntraditional that he baked a pound cake. And so the house was always filled with this wonderful\nsmell of baked goods, and his pound cake was incomparable.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: I have spent my life trying to find one like it, but it 1s impossible, 1t seems.",
        "Q: Is that one of your earliest memories --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- of your father, is -- is baking at -- the pound cake?",
        "A: Well actually, the more prevalent and early memory is probably one of -- of him playing\ngames with me. Being left at the dinner or breakfast table with my father is an early memory,\nbecause I didn\u2019t eat. And they used to say I lived off the air. I just was not a child who ate a lot,\nand I -- or at all, and so he was the one elected to amuse me and tell me stories. And he would\npull out the contents of his pockets and make up stories, and then occasionally try to slide a\nspoonful of something or other in my mouth. And that -- that\u2019s sort of my earliest recollection, it\n-- it\u2019s one of the very early ones.",
        "Q: Huh. You took walks with your father also. Was -- was that after the occupation, or do you\nremember [indecipherable]",
        "A: I very much remember it before also.",
        "Q: Also.",
        "A: It was sort of our special time of day together, and he would come home from -- as I say from\nwherever, I don\u2019t know from where. And -- and then he and I would go for a walk just the two of\nus, and we would walk in the neighborhood, around the block or whatever, and it -- it was both\nbefore the occupation and for a short time after.",
        "Q: Did he also walk with your sister, or was this very special for you? Do you know?",
        "A: If he walked with my sister I don\u2019t know about it, but he may have been one of these\nwonderful parents who knew how to make each child feel very special and -- and he probably\ndid something with her, or maybe a walk or something else with her. I-I don\u2019t know, I actually\nnever asked her. But there was always this little bit of time for us, and it was generally -- I don\u2019t\nremember if it was after or before supper, but it was either very late in the afternoon, or early\nevening.",
        "Q: And you\u2019d have conversations?",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: And would you tell -- would he ask you what your day was like, was that the -- or was it\ndifferent?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think he asked me what my day was like. My sort of recollection, and as I say here,\nI\u2019m not really sure this is a recollection or whether I imagined this, that we talked at a child\u2019s\nlevel about something very present. There wasn\u2019t stuff about what did you do, or what are you\ngoing to do, but more -- more about do you hear that bird singing, or s-something rooted in the\npresent that a -- a -- rooted in the experience we were having together at that time.",
        "Q: Was his way of behaving with you, it -- as -- from what you can remember, different from\nother fathers? It doesn\u2019t sound like the usual story of a father being so concerned about the kids.",
        "A: I -- if I say this is unusual, it comes from a -- a long backwards and adult perspective and\ncertainly not a child\u2019s memory because I had no idea what another father might have been like.\nBut I would say yes. I would say for several reasons. Number one, he was an extremely gentle\nand patient man, which is the reason he took -- took all the stuff out of his pocket forever and\never and ever, and in fact one of those things sort of backfired, because I knew that among the\ntreasures he had in his pocket was a small pair of scissors. And one time he and I were sitting in\nthe living room of our house, and we had very heavy oak, dark, dark oak furniture, sort of dark,\ndark -- you know that heavy European furniture. And over the big, big table in the middle of this\nliving room -- w-why this living room had this great big table sort of like -- more like a dining\nroom table, I don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s the way it was set up. And the table had these heavy\ncrosspieces underneath. And there was a plush tablecloth, if you can imagine, it\u2019s more the kind\nof thing you can imagine over a piano, but it was over the table, and it had long fringes on it, and\nit was over the table in such a way that the points of the cloth were on the ends and so forth. And\nit was great place for me, I always had my little hideout there, it was a little -- like a little house,\nand I asked to borrow the scissors one day, and I climbed under there and I gave the tablecloth a\nhaircut. Not fun at the time. But was he different? I think he was also different because I think\nmy mother was probably an early feminist in many ways, although I don\u2019t think she called\nherself that at the time. She was the working partner in the hou -- in the home at the time that I\nremember, anyway, and she had, apparently, a very unusual and important job for a woman in\nsome kind of financial activity. Just exactly what it was, I never really knew or understood, and -\n- so she was out of my circle for much of the day. She was also not the one who was either as\npatient or as fun loving as I re-remember my father being. Not that my father was necessarily fun\nloving, but he was -- h-he smiled readily, as opposed to maybe yelling at me, which is more what\nI remember from my mother.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So she was the disciplinarian.",
        "A: Probably, although from my point of view it wasn\u2019t -- you know, it was never fair, and it was\nnever --",
        "Q: Right. So who took care of you during the day then, if you -- both of your parents are out --\nyou don\u2019t know what your father\u2019s doing, but your mother\u2019s certainly working.",
        "A: Right. Well, it wasn\u2019t unusual for people of even modest means to have help in those days. I\nmean, this is now the 30\u2019s we\u2019re talking. And we did have what was known as a meisje, or a girl,\nwho -- who worked for us, and -- and in fact I remember -- I -- I remember s -- being served,\nwhen I was still in my crib, I remember her bringing me breakfast in the crib, and the breakfast\nconsisted of these things called Dutch rusk. I don\u2019t know if you know what those are, but it\u2019s sort\nof a light and airy kind of toasty thing of about a half an inch thick. And she always had them\ndrenched in honey. And so she would bring me these things in the crib, and the honey would be\nall over the place, and I hated it. I just despised it, and everything was st -- then sticky and\ndrippy, and you know, and you can imagine a toddler in the crib, and the honey. So yes, I think\nshe was probably one that took care of us.",
        "Q: So how old do you think you were when you were in the crib? Two, three? Ye -- ye -- I mean,\nthat\u2019s a clear memory for you.",
        "A: It\u2019s a very clear memory, and since it was a crib, I must have been two or so. Couldn\u2019t --\ncouldn\u2019t leave that sticky memory behind.",
        "Q: And your sist -- tell me what your mother -- what -- what was your mother\u2019s name?",
        "A: Rosa, Rosa Schwarz.",
        "Q: And was there difference in your parent\u2019s age, do you know? Or were they pretty close\ntogether?",
        "A: I-I\u2019m not really sure. It\u2019s possible that my mother was maybe a year older or so.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Or maybe more. I-I don\u2019t really know. I know my mother was a very -- with me was a very\nlate parent -- mother. I mean, there are eight years difference between my sister and me.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I think that she married rather late, as well, so I\u2019m -- yeah, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m sort of guessing\nthat she was in her 40\u2019s when I was born.",
        "Q: Right. Hm. Was pretty late then.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And your sister Betsy was eight years older than you. And do you have a recollection as a kid,\nof this older sister?",
        "A: Oh yes, very clearly, because I -- in addition to -- to a meisje who was taking care of us, she\nobviously as the big sister was often put in charge, and I always resented that terribly. And I\nthink my poor sister suffered horribly because of that, because I would probably always giver her\na hard time. I guess I was fairly headstrong. I\u2019m not above throwing a temper tantrum and\nscreaming, yelling and crying, and my poor sister had to put up with all that. So -- yeah, and --\nand basically, I think my sister and I are -- are -- are somewhat different personalities to begin\nwith. So I don\u2019t think that was an easy thing for her, and -- and it wasn\u2019t fun for me, you know,\nand there was -- it created this sister sibling sort of irritation. I because I didn\u2019t want to be told\nthat I couldn\u2019t do something, and she because I didn\u2019t want to do what she said I had to do.",
        "Q: Right, right. What was the house like where you lived? Did you live in an apartment, did you\nlive in a house?",
        "A: No, actually we lived in -- we lived in this very, very -- I guess bourgeois is probably the\nEnglish equivalent word for it, but in a -- a very, very nice residential area, not too far from the\nRiyksmuseum, on the Pieter de Hooch Straat. And it was all residential, so there was no\ncommercial activity going on there at all, which makes the presence of what was going on in our\nhouse even more puzzling, because my mother worked in the house, in -- in two rooms of our\nhouse was this contore or -- or office, as she would call it. And in Holland as you -- well,\ncertainly in Amsterdam, all the houses are built so that they are smack up against each other.\nAnd there is no sort of stand alone housing. And it goes all the way around the four sides of a\nblock that way. And what you have is people living on the ground floor, people living on the first\nfloor, and another couple second, and another on the third. And then the house part, what we\ncalled ground floor, or caw -- or house, has access to the backyards. And the backyards are all\npretty private, all surrounded by wooden fences, both in the middle and on the sides. So you\nreally have a-again, a -- a greater European sense of privacy, while at the same time you can see\ninto those yards from the first, second and third floor, not only of your building, but the one next\nto you on either side, and the one behind you from the other street. So there\u2019s -- yes, there is\nprivacy, and no there isn\u2019t privacy in -- in some way. And this house that we had was brick, as\nmost houses were, and there is not the front lawn kind of thing, and there\u2019s not the -- the curb\nlawn and so forth as we know it here, but -- but a city street, really, although it was residential.\nAnd we had -- that was unusual too, we had the ground floor, the house part and the first floor.\nBut the first f -- two rooms of the ground floor were this office. But there was nothing on the\nfront door, there was no mark of any kind, or title, or -- or -- or whatever. So I\u2019m still a little bit\nat a loss as to what this outfit was, I\u2019m only learning now from my sister who were the name --\nwhat were the names of some of the -- well, I did know one of the names, th-the boss was Mr.\nHalle. And I know that my mother disappeared in these two rooms for much of the day, but\nthat\u2019s about the extent of it.",
        "Q: So sh -- you don\u2019t know if she was an accountant, or she was a -- noth -- you have no idea?",
        "A: N-No. My sister might actually know that better.",
        "Q: She might. Uh-huh. But she didn\u2019t come out, for the most part, during those --",
        "A: No, she might come out, you know, for -- briefly for a couple of minutes during the day. At\nleast that\u2019s my memory.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t know --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- actually if --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- if it\u2019s accurate. For all I know she spent considerable time outside of it with me, only I\ndon\u2019t remember it.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember it. But you weren\u2019t as comfortable with your mother as you were with\nyour father at all, were you?",
        "A: Mm-mm, mm-mm. No, I th -- I think partly because -- I mean later on becoming a working\nwoman myself, I had a little more sympathy for that. Because you may have limited time, you\u2019re\ntrying to spend it with your child, the child doesn\u2019t understand that urgency of the moment. You\nwant him or her to do x, y and z before you go back to the office, and they\u2019re not doing it. It\ncreates a lot of stress and strain. And I always had the sense somehow that my mother was very\nnervous, that she was anxious, that she was tense. And I never had that with my father.",
        "Q: With your father.",
        "A: Now, as I say, that may all be -- I mean, the older I got the more appreciation I had of all of\nthe difficulties that these adults were going through, right throughout.",
        "Q: Yeah, right throughout the period. W-Were there kids around in the neighborhood so you had\nfriends?",
        "A: Well, the only child I remember being around was the child next door. And this child lived I -\n- it was either the second or the third story apartment next door. But because as I explained you\ncan look into these yards, very often I would run into the yard and call up to her and she would\ncome running out to the veranda, and so forth, and then she\u2019d say, oh I will come over, or\nwhatever. And she\u2019d come over and play in our yard because we had the yard and they didn\u2019t,\nthey only had the veranda. And -- and of course one of my very earliest hurtful and -- and\nshocking memories is of me doing exactly that, running out one day, as I did so many days and\ncalling up to her to come out and play and she came to the edge of the veranda and she yelled\ndirty Jew at me and spat on me from the veranda. And I think it was the first really sort of\ncrushing childhood blow for -- for what that means when someone does that to you. And\nsomething that we sort of underestimate always in terms of its impact when we, for example,\ndeal with kids in school and their interactions and the bullying that takes place and the yelling\nand the -- y-you know, the sticks and stones line doesn\u2019t hold.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Words can and do hurt.",
        "Q: That particular scene between you and -- and your friend, was that -- that\u2019s after the\noccupation of 1940, that you remember [indecipherable] happened --",
        "A: The thing that I have trouble with of course, is the chronology here.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, sure.",
        "A: \u2019'm not sure.",
        "Q: Cause you would have been four years old. During the occupation you would have been four,\nright?",
        "A: Yeah, right. So my guess is it was some -- it would have to be after. It would have had to be\nafter, I\u2019m guessing. What I don\u2019t remember is exactly when and where this happened in relation\nto my starting school, which was more of a -- what do you call that, sort of a marker, y -- a time,\nchronology marker for me. I just have the recollection of that incident, and -- and it\u2019s sort of a --\na little bit -- perhaps out of sequence maybe now.",
        "Q: But it doesn\u2019t matter, it doesn\u2019t matter. You started s -- so y-your -- y-you don\u2019t have a clear\nperception of the occupation, beginning of the occupation, or do you?",
        "A: I have a clear recollection of the beginning of this sort of -- what I later understood as a really\nsort of maniacal way of building up the fear in the population. So the first time that I was aware\nthat there was a major difference going on outside my home was the fact that I had started\nschool, and then I had stopped school. So that was probably the first, although it might have been\npreceded by taking one of these walks with my dad, and the same wonderful walks that we used\nto take, and going down the street, I remember the -- there was a school opposite our house. It\nwasn\u2019t the school that I went to, but it was some other school, and again there was no lawn in the\nfront, but they did have these sort of both ornamental and -- and physical heavy iron chains. And\nI used to love to sit on those and swing on them. But I wasn't doing that with my father, we were\n-- we were going out for a walk and going down the block and turning right as we did, and I\nremember there on the opposite, diagonally opposite side of the street used to be an empty lot.\nAnd all of a sudden this particular day we went there, and it was all surrounded in wooden\nfencing, but not your attractive fencing or whatever, but in these -- it\u2019s the stuff that they used to\nhave around baseball -- corner lot baseball thing -- I mean, I don\u2019t know -- exactly know how to\nsay it, but you couldn\u2019t -- there were these vertical planks next to each other and you couldn\u2019t\nlook through them. And so all of a sudden there is no empty lot except for this wooden fencing\nall around, and all of a sudden there is an opening in the fence, a door and a -- and a Nazi soldier\nwalks out. And he is striding down the street and he comes towards my father and he asks him\nfor a light for his cigarette. And I -- I remember almost as if it was yesterday, that my father, this\npatient, gentle man, really tensed, and lit the soldier\u2019s cigarette. And the soldier very politely said\nthank you and walked on. And my father swore under his breath. And I could sense this man\u2019s\nbehavior was so out of character from how I knew him, that I knew that there was something\namiss, but I, again had no -- no -- certainly no knowledge at the time what that meant. And what\nhe said under his breath was Rotmof. Rotmof being the -- mof being the derogatory term used for\nthe Nazis, and the rot meaning rotten. You know, so he was saying basically, rotten Nazi. And I\ndidn\u2019t know what Nazi meant, and I couldn\u2019t understand why he would be saying this. I -- when\nI saw this soldier coming out I didn\u2019t know s -- I didn\u2019t know from soldiers, I really didn\u2019t\nunderstand anything. If you\u2019re asking me what was my childhood memory, I knew he was a\nsoldier, that was --",
        "Q: That was it.",
        "A: -- that was it. And I only knew he was called a Rotmof, because that\u2019s what my father said.",
        "Q: Did you know at the time that it was a swearword, or -- or was it --",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Y-You did.",
        "A: Well, hard to say, I -- I knew that it was something that was probably not good because he\ndidn\u2019t say it out loud. And I knew that it was probably something that I wasn\u2019t supposed to copy,\nbecause he didn\u2019t say it out law -- loud. I don\u2019t think -- I don\u2019t remember, but I don\u2019t think I\nasked him what he said.",
        "Q: But you re -- but you do remember it.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Is it possible that you felt his anger, possibly even fear, and you were very hesitant to say\nwhat --",
        "A: I\u2019m sure.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] felt something.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure I must have felt something, because it wasn\u2019t like me not to either question, or to --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- I -- I -- I\u2019m sure I must have absorbed something that was of that nature. It was probably\nanger at that point, and not fear. I don\u2019t remember -- I do remember the anger. And I c -- I sensed\nthat he had suppressed anger. And it was a whole new emotion for me because that was not what\nhe ever displayed.",
        "Q: And you, when you went to school, were y -- are you five years old or six years old at --",
        "A: Six.",
        "Q: Oh, six. There\u2019s no ki --",
        "A: Th-There was no public kindergarten, no.",
        "Q: So you were -- it\u2019s 1942 when you go to school.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: So you were only able to go for a couple of weeks?",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: And as I understand it, that was really upsetting to you, because you very much wanted to go\nto school, yes?",
        "A: Yeah. Well, in talking -- in referring back to this tension between my sister and me, I mean\nhere she was not only this big girl who had all this responsibility and this power over me, and she\nwas a schoolgirl and she had time set aside for doing homework and it was very much respected\nwhat she did, and -- and actually she was in the -- a student in the gymnasium, which is the\nDutch so -- college preparatory, and the heavy duty curriculum of history and geography and\nalgebra and geometry and German and French and English and Greek and Latin. And here she\nwas partaking of these mysterious disciplines and this must have something to do with the fact\nthat she had the responsibility for me. So I thought, well if I can access that also, then she won\u2019t\nhave to do this any more, maybe. So I was very excited about starting school. I thought this was\njust going to be, you know, this was -- this was my way to heaven. And -- and -- and I couldn\u2019t\nwait, I really couldn\u2019t wait, I was so excited. And I don\u2019t think I really had more than a couple of\nweeks when I was no longer allowed to go to school.",
        "Q: We have to change the tape now.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: Hedy, do you have any recollection whether your sister was as unhappy about school\nstopping? Cause obviously she couldn\u2019t go to school either.",
        "A: Right. I don\u2019t have any real recollection, but having just visited her, as we are always wont to\ndo, we tend to try to spend some time both reminiscing and sort of corroborating memories. And\nwe\u2019 ve tried to make that a little bit more formal project, but that hasn\u2019t worked too well because\nof our individual lives sort of diverging and so on. But she shared with me, and I actually have it,\nI haven\u2019t had a chance to look at it, a book that was written about what happened at that time, to\nher school and her schoolmates. And -- and herself for that matter. What -- what happened was\nthat before the stopping of school, what -- what was done was one of these many decrees that\nwas offered. And the decree was that no -- that all the Jewish children had to go to the Jewish\nschool -- to a Jewish school, or a school that was set aside as a Jewish school. Now, why they\ndidn\u2019t do that with the elementary school kids, I don\u2019t know, and for all I know they did, except\nperhaps it was too far, or it -- my folks didn\u2019t think it was important, I don\u2019t know. But for the\nhigh school, they did set aside something wa -- which they called the joodse -- I think it was\ncalled the joodse lyceum. And so -- so all the Jewish kids were sort of pulled out of their s --\nrespective schools and told to go to this one school. And then they were tol -- and then were told\nthere wasn\u2019t going to be any more school at all for the Jewish kids. And then, what I just learned,\nwhich I didn\u2019t know, was that apparently many of the teachers continued to try to teach these\nkids, and that the kids were meeting at respective parent\u2019s homes, as many of -- of them as could.\nAnd this book that she showed me was a book that was written by her -- one of her teachers from\nthe gymnasium, who came with these kids and -- and taught them. I think I have this correct.\nAnd the book is basically not only a story of how this unfolded, and how they moved from\nwhose home to which home and where it was located, and what happened when a particular\nstudent wasn\u2019t there, and everyone knew what had happened, which was that that family had\nbeen called up and deported. So there was this constant threat that ran through the meetings for\nhowever long they were able to -- to -- to carry on, about people disappearing, and the students\nbeing quite aware of this, and the teachers being very aware of this. And yet, trying to continue\nto keep going and to keep going, and then as I say, I have not had a chance to look at this book,\nbut the book has since -- she was also interviewed for that. And one of the appendices in the\nbook has the lists of all the students by the year that they should have been in -- in this school,\nand basically tells you what, to the best of this man\u2019s a-ability, happened to each of these, and --\nand how -- how this all just came to pass. And it\u2019s -- it\u2019s all there documented and the -- and the\ndifficulties of meeting in the homes, and the -- and the effort on people to try to create some\nsense of normalcy for these kids, who were clearly much, much, much more aware of what was\nhappening than I certainly was. I mean, I had not a clue that she was even doing this at the time.",
        "Q: Right, and she would have, at your -- when you\u2019re five, she\u2019s what? Thirt --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 - 11 -- 13 - 14.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: 13 or 14 years old. So she\u2019s much -- she\u2019s clearly much older. Do you not have any schooling\nthen? The school stops, there\u2019s no tutoring, there\u2019s nothing?",
        "A: Nothing. But then again, it wasn\u2019t very long until -- until it stopped for everybody.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: For my sister, as well.",
        "Q: Right, right. Now, I -- as I understand it, your father is picked up on a number of occasions\nand then comes back. Do you have recollections of his being taken?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Were you in the house and saw it?",
        "A: Yes. I do remember seeing it, I do remember being aware of it. I had, for example a very -- I\nhave still, to this day, very clear memories of not being able to move about without wearing a\njacket that had the Jewish star on it. And I can\u2019t remember in the order of things when this came,\nbut I do distinctly remember that -- th-that our walks had to stop because we weren't allowed --\nafter dark we weren\u2019t allowed to come out -- s -- go outside. And I do remember him being\ntaken, and I remember the anxiety and the tension. And I do remember him coming back, and\nthis imme -- enormous relief when he came back. And this happened several times, and it\u2019s --\nagain in -- in reflecting about this time, and thinking about it over these many, many years, I\u2019m\njust struck by another psychological manipulation of the population, you know, th-this constant\ninstilling of some activity that would raise the level of anxiety, certainly among the Jews.",
        "Q: Do you remember learning later where your father went? I-I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t say anything\nto you when he came back, but do you have any idea where he was taken?",
        "A: [have no idea where he was taken except I remember being told or hearing -- overhearing\nthem say that he was being taken away for questioning. And I have no idea why they took my\nfather, I have no idea what they were questioning him about. I don\u2019t know whether my sister\nknows that, or whether this conceivably was now coinciding with the beginning of the\ndeportation of the eastern European Jews who had fled to Holland in an effort to escape what\nwas going on on the eastern front.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And -- and so many of these people were originally housed at Westerbork and -- cause there\nwas no place to keep them.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And so they, in a sense, were sort of sitting ducks for being the first de -- deportees. And --\nand that then later became a kind of holding camp, really. It\u2019s possible that they were trying to do\nthis kind of random questioning in order to make sure that the rest of the Jews didn\u2019t flee. I\nmean, Holland being what it is, and where it is, there wasn\u2019t really a lot we could do on -- as was\nthe unfortunate fate of those who fled to Holland. It\u2019s a tiny country, about the size of New\nJersey, I think, flat as a pancake, a lot of it reclaimed land from the sea. You know, you can kind\nof look -- stand in one place and look to the beach and the shore and so forth. There were no hills\nand mountain caves or thick forests where people could flee or hide. So you were in a s -- ina\nsense a captive, you know, with your back against the sea. And I know that all these countries\nmade a desperate ef -- or at least the Jews in those countries made a desperate effort to get across\nthe channel, get across the sea and -- and -- and go someplace else. But unfortunately that didn\u2019t\nwork for a lot of people.",
        "Q: D-Do you remember that you didn\u2019t have very much food during this -- this is -- I\u2019m -- \u2019m\nnow asking before your father is actually arrested and you don\u2019t see --",
        "A: No, I have no memory of not having enough food at that time.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t.",
        "A: No. Of course not -- not being a big eater, I might not have registered that. But I -- I re --\ndon\u2019t have any recollection of not having food at that time.",
        "Q: So you remained not a very good eater, which -- which ended up, I suppose, being fortunate.",
        "A: Perhaps.",
        "Q: In the e --",
        "A: Perhaps.",
        "Q: In the end.",
        "A: Yeah, I think that a -- in fact, I have an early memory -- I have early memories and they\nprobably were beforehand, before occupation -- maybe not -- of going to the market with my\nmother, but then again, that was one of the things that became forbidden. We couldn\u2019t go to the\npublic market, but I remember going at some point in this time with my mother, and I always\nloved animals, and I always wanted to pet the horses. I mean, the -- the market consisted of all\nthese horse drawn carriages lined up and -- and people peddled their wares from the -- from these\ncarts. And she was always, forever pulling me away from the horses, and I -- that was not where\nI wanted to be. But I -- I always wanted to talk to the animals and pet the animals and so forth.",
        "Q: Did you have an animal?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t. Did you want one in your house?",
        "A: At -- I think at that time I was so young that I didn\u2019t know that that might be a possibility.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Also I\u2019m not sure whether -- whether that was frequently the possibility in the city. Certainly\nwould have been very happy to have one, but I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know. My -- my limited world at\nthat time did not make that something I wanted, cause I didn\u2019t know it was possible.",
        "Q: Do you remember being bored, or did you -- did you have all sorts of things that you were\ndoing in the course of the day, so not going to school wasn\u2019t too bad?",
        "A: You mean, when I could no longer go to school?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: That time I think was fairly short, between the time that we had to go into hiding, and the time\nthat I was out of school. I -- I think there was a brief period I might have been bored.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, not so --",
        "A: But I don\u2019t remember it too well.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I remember a little bit sort of rummaging around the garden and sort of finding things to do. I-\nI don\u2019t remember toys at this time at all, no recollection of -- of things that were mine, I only had\nrecollections of things in the house, or things 1n the yard. I remember there must not have been\ngood and adequate refrigeration space because my parents kept limburger cheese in the\ncoalhouse in the backyard, you know, the house that contained the coal for the heating and so on.\nAnd so it must be that that was because it was cold. Or maybe it was because it was smelly, I\ndon\u2019t know. Or both?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So -- and no, I -- actually it must have been refrigeration because I have this vague\nrecollection sometimes of a pitcher of milk --",
        "Q: Being put there.",
        "A: -- also going back there.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Do you remember any religious observance in your house?",
        "A: None.",
        "Q: None.",
        "A: None. I -- I have actually no recollection of anything that I would tie to -- to a remotely\nreligious thing except that possibly there was a -- a large dinner with a lot of people, and that\nmight have been a holiday, or a Passover Seder or something, but I didn\u2019t register that way in my\nmind.",
        "Q: Did you know you were Jewish?",
        "A: N-No, I don\u2019t think I did. I remember once going to some -- some kind of Sunday school\nassembly hall or something, and I -- I -- I sort of think that my folks might have been sort of\nexploring the possibility of having me go there. And I didn\u2019t really like it, 1t was very chaotic,\nand th -- and there wasn\u2019t any fun as far as I could tell. I mean, it was nothing that I remember\nwith any positive or negative feeling, but I remember this sort of one time trip there, and then\nthat was more or less it. There was no -- there was no discuss -- no -- no keeping the Sabbath, n -\n- as far as I know. No candle lighting, no -- if there was, I don\u2019t know it, and I don\u2019t remember it.\nIt might have been part of the every day world, and -- but I don\u2019t recall it. I had no idea what it\nmeant to be Jewish, none. And wa -- and I think when this child called me a dirty Jew, I --",
        "Q: Cause I was just going to ask you that. Did 1t mean anything to you?",
        "A: Nothing. It was by the fact that she spat on me, and the manner in which she threw these\nwords at me that I understood it was something negative. But I had no sense of what that meant,\nnone.",
        "Q: Did you ask your father, or your mother? Did you go in the house and say why did she say\nthis? Do you remember?",
        "A: I don\u2019t have any recollection of it. It would seem strange that I would not have, because I\nremember being very upset. It\u2019s possible that there was no one around at the moment and I\ncouldn\u2019t talk to anyone about it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It\u2019s possible that I was given some answer by somebody but it didn\u2019t register.",
        "Q: What registered was what the -- what -- what --",
        "A: What registered was --",
        "Q: What the kid did.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Right. When you have to put on -- when you put on your jacket and it had a Jewish star on it,\ndid this mean anything to you, or was just well, this is what I have to do. Do you remember\u2019?",
        "A: It was th -- well, this is what I have to do, and it was also a way in which I began to put pieces\nof the puzzle together in a way, in the sense that I did realize there was some connection between\nwhat the girl said to me -- what this child spat at me, and the word on the jacket. There was a\nconnection and I did realize that there was -- that I basically was now being labeled, that I was,\nyou know, that I was Jew, and that that was -- that that was a way of making sure that everyone\nelse knew I was a Jew. And th-that left a kind of -- what\u2019s the word I want? Sort of an unclear,\nbut an -- a -- a -- it left a feeling of understanding what was happening, but not -- there was no\nunderstanding of why and how come and who was making us do that. I d -- I just began to sense\nthat there was a connection between what was on the jacket, and what the child had said, and that\nthere was some reason that people needed to be able to recognize me and knew that -- and know\nthat I was a Jew. And why, or how come, or what was it about being a Jew that needed\ndemarcation labeling, I had no idea.",
        "Q: So, when you\u2019re given the jacket with the Jew -- you -- it says Jood?",
        "A: Jo -- J-o-o-d.",
        "Q: J-o-o -- yeah -- on it, nobody explains this to you?",
        "A: If they did, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Do you remember seeing other people wearing it?",
        "A: I remember my -- yes, I think I did, actually. I certainly remember my family wearing it, and I\nthink that the -- there were -- I -- we were not actually living in a Jewish area, in a pronounced,\npredominantly Jewish area, so I didn\u2019t really know about the whole Jewish section of\nAmsterdam until I was an adult and went back to Amsterdam and -- and actually toured that area\nand saw the synagogues and was in the Jewish museum and saw the statue commemorating the\nuprising and the strike and so forth. I -- I knew nothing of that as a child, so that may account in\npart for why I didn\u2019t see more of that. And it wasn\u2019t really until I was an adult and I s-studied\nlots of stuff, including the whole psychological phenomena of -- of labeling and what that means.\nAnd -- and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar with a very, very powerful piece that was done right after\nMartin Luther King died, by the teacher in Riceville, Iowa, which \u201cFrontline\u201d featured on PBS,\nand I have since used with my students a good many times, which is just basically having the\nchildren experience what happens when you do -- do label and stigmatize people. Sometimes it\u2019s\ncalled -- the program is called, \u201cBlue Eyes, Brown Eyes.\u201d There\u2019s another version of it that also\ntakes this woman into prisons and other areas of -- in -- of human interaction where she tries the\nsame thing with adults, and it works almost more successfully even. And -- and that\u2019s called,\n\u201cThe Eye of the Storm.\u201d I\u2019ve forgotten which one comes first, but -- and then she also has\nanother -- she has a reunion with that first class with whom she tries it, and it 1s incredible how\npositive the influence on these people this early exercise was, where, you know, she -- she makes\nthe attempt to have the children understand what it\u2019s like when you do that to people. And she\nseparates them according to the color of their eyes. And then she says to the children, you know,\nI understand that -- first she tries it with whatever, blue eyes, and she says, I understand that you\n-- | -- | have just learned that -- that blue eyed people are just not as smart as brown eyed people.\nAnd then later in the day she says, you know, they\u2019re not even as attentive, and they\u2019re not as\ngood as -- you know, she goes on and on with this. And then she said, you know what, we should\nlabel these people so that we can more easily recognize them, and then we don\u2019t have to choose\nthem on the team, and we don\u2019t have to play with them, because they\u2019re not as smart as we are.\nAnd so why don\u2019t we put collars on them. And then you see this whole effect of what this\nlabeling does to these third or fourth graders. And -- and 1-1-1t\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s an eye opener. It\u2019s\nshocking.",
        "Q: Do you think that that\u2019s -- that happened to you, that -- that having this star on you made you\nfeel inferior, or you -- because you describe it as not really knowing what\u2019s going on.",
        "A: I -- not for me, but I was six years old.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Now, when kids are nine, there\u2019s a whole different ball game. And when you\u2019re an adult it\u2019s\ndifferent, and when you\u2019re 14 like my sister, it\u2019s altogether different.",
        "Q: Right. [indecipherable] right.",
        "A: And of course the -- the things that you associate with the label also have something to do\nwith it. If you put the collars on and you tell people they\u2019re smarter, then you get the reverse\neffect.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And you do, you do. You tell the kids they\u2019re smarter, they behave, th -- I mean that this is --\na lot of educational research is out there. You tell the kids they\u2019re smarter, they perform better.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But -- but that was not the intention here by the Nazis, clearly. And actually this is the kind of\nthing that -- that when I was talking to you earlier about sharing recollections of the war year, the\npre-war years with my Dutch friend, who became the professor of religion at Smith, he\nremembers when this was being -- this was going on in the town where he grew up, I think it was\nBreda. And he said all of a sudden the kids, his buddies at school took this as formal approval of\ndoing stuff like yelling epithets at people who were wearing the star. I -- I mean, th-they took this\nas open season, essentially, so that there was a yi -- and he -- he recalled -- I remember this very\nclearly, he recalled when we were doing our joint recollections, walking home from school with\na bunch of his friends, and there was an old man who was wearing the star and was clearly\nelderly and so forth and so on, and that the boys who the day before had been perfectly polite and\npassed this man without any events happening at all, started to stone him. Now, you know, here\nyou have this kind of institutional approval because as -- you now say to everybody, we\u2019ve\nlabeled these people as untermenschen, as dirt, as people that you can do anything you like with.\nI mean, it\u2019s unfortunately a little bit of I think what we did in Vietnam is we socialized the\nsoldiers to be willing to do unheard of, inhuman things. I mean, what these guys did in My Lai\ndidn\u2019t come about because someone wanted to have a heyday. So -- so the dehumanizing effect\nthat you can create, that you can program essentially, you can socialize people to participate in,\neven though their teachings and everything else would have you believe that they wouldn\u2019t and\nshouldn\u2019t. And happily there were people who didn\u2019t, and who stood up. But then -- then you see\nthen the Nazis come in and they manipulate that, so they arrest the people who were protecting\nJews, or they have a shooting in the square to basically call attention to anyone who was trying\nto live up to his or her Protestant or Catholic teachings, and not do this to their fellow human\nbeings. But it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it makes you think about how incredibly thin the layer of civilization\nreally is. And when the chips are down, you know, the scapegoating, the stereotyping, the\nlabeling all play one against, another against, but with the other, to -- to create -- I don\u2019t know\nwhat it is about us that we always have to feel better than somebody, and in order to feel better\nwe have to put someone else down. And that\u2019s what they were successfully doing.",
        "Q: Do -- do you remember any other instance before you go into hiding where somebody calls\nyou a dirty Jew, or uses an epithet, or -- or is that the one incident that you recol --",
        "A: No, it\u2019s really the one incident that I do remember. I d-don\u2019t know whether my sister had\nmore. It\u2019s the only incident I remember before the war. The next one that I remember actually\ncame after I came to America and went to elementary school, and I was -- I was always a bit of\nan activist I guess, and I was anxious to fit in and blend in and do all the things that all the other\nkids do, and lose my accent and learn to play baseball and all those kinds of things. But I was on\nthe safety patrol, and so I was -- my job was to see that the little kids got on the bus first and\nweren\u2019t trampled by the big kids, and all that stuff on the school bus. And -- and I remember I\nwas in sixth grade by then, and there was a boy who was trying to sneak into line and get on the\nbus and I yanked him out and said he couldn\u2019t do this, or whatever, whatever, he had to let the\nlittle kids go first. And he turned around and he called me a dirty Jew. He was a classmate of\nmine. That was my first experience with it in America.",
        "Q: Did you respond?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t really remember.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And of course, then you get in -- then you get caught up into something else which is by the\ntime you\u2019re 12 years old and you get the message that you don\u2019t want to be a squealer and you\ndon\u2019t want to this and that and the other. And I don\u2019t think I responded, and I don\u2019t think I told\nanybody. But I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Right. Your father is arrested and doesn\u2019t come back. And it\u2019s 1942, so you\u2019re now\nSIX --",

        "A: It\u2019s 1942.",
        "Q: Do you remember?",
        "A: Ido remember because I remember it so distinctly, and at first I thought that it was maybe in\nmy memory that had been clouded over or colored by the nature of the events. But that was in\nfact not the case because it\u2019s been corroborated that in fact it was twilight. It was early evening,\nand again that\u2019s sort of not a time when you expect people to come to the door. A-Again, I -- I\nsometimes think about these things much -- much -- I mean way after the fact in the sense that\nwhen I first remembered that -- th -- or any of these experiences, I didn\u2019t remember them with all\nof the stuff that I bring to 1t now, which 1s to say, lord, just think about the minds that devised all\nthese schemes. So usually by the time you think you\u2019re -- you know, you\u2019re in the evening, and\nunless you\u2019re expecting company you sort of think you\u2019re safe inside your house. Well -- and I\nthink this was the first time that he was called up by these Gestapo that was in the evening. The -\n- the other times had all been daylight. So they came in the evening and they knocked on the\ndoor, and I remember -- I think I was somewhere not far behind, watching the scene. And they\nasked for my father very politely, and they said to my mother, \u201cWe\u2019ll be back for you later.\u201d And\nto this day, I think and think of -- about this, and I keep asking myself, were these soldiers trying\nto give my mother the high sign? Were they trying to give her an opportunity to do something?\nWere they ineffective and inefficient Nazis and slipped, and shouldn\u2019t have said that? You know,\nwhat -- what was going on here in the minds of these guys?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Pll never know.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to continue asking you about this, but we have to change the tape, unfortunately.\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "Q: Are -- were you surmising that these were Nazis, or they were Dutch soldiers who came?",
        "A: Oh, definitely not Dutch soldiers.",
        "Q: They were def -- they were definitely --",
        "A: There were no s -- to my knowledge there were no soldiers in Dutch uniform around at this\ntime.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: The -- the capitulization -- capitulization of the Dutch to the Nazis, as I understood it -- and\nI\u2019ve only just recently begun to look at this, because for so many years, I felt this was not an area\nI wanted to study, this was not an area I wanted to look at as a scholar and so forth. Now, I\u2019m\nbeginning to have a little different sense, and -- and actually for a number of reasons. But a -- as I\nunderstood it, it was somewhere around this time that -- that the Dutch government basically was\na sort of government under the aegis of a Dutch -- a -- no, I think 1t was a Dutch Nazi general\nsome -- some sort of person like that, named Seyss-Inquart, who was basically put in charge,\nwhere the -- whereas the queen -- I guess the queen and the -- and the royalty wasn\u2019t exactly the\nruling figure anyway, given the Dutch combination of a constitutional monarchy, and so on. But\nthe queen left for England and the prince and princess and their children left for Canada. And --\nand actually later on I-I remember hearing some broadcasts of the queen speaking to us from\nEngland and so on. But so this -- this -- putting this person in charge again, was -- was one of\nthese pieces that I didn\u2019t -- I wasn't aware of at the time. I mean, what does a little kid know\nabout government and how it operates? I didn\u2019t know where the rules were coming from that\nwere being asked -- well, were being laid down. I knew that there was something about the fact\nthat we were not any longer having lots of red, white and blue flags out, and orange streamers on\nthe flag poles, which all represented Holland and the House of Orange. I don\u2019t remember seeing\nNazi flags either, but I didn\u2019t see the Dutch flags. And -- and it was again one of these ways of\nmaking things seem like they were normal. So there was a government and it was issuing\ndecrees, and this was a Dutch, presumably -- th-there was a fair amount of collusion among the\nDutch. Something that only has come to my knowledge somewhat from the experiences I had,\nbut much more -- more real when I became an adult and read a little bit more, and heard a little\nbit more, because I'd always grown up thinking, you know, the Dutch were so wonderful, and\nthe Dutch basically saved me, and my sister and my mother. And they did that also to some other\nJews. But there was also a lot of collusion going on. The NSB was -- the NSB was known as the\nparty that was in collusion with the Nazis. And it was -- 1-1t was probably a way in which -- in\nwhich all politics and occupation works, and which uncomfortably I\u2019m aware of, the United\nStates does likewise, which is you find your way in to some society by a group of people with\nwhom you associate and with whom you vision a common goal and you infiltrate, basically. And\nso the -- the amount of collusion there was rather shockingly high, from my perspective. Not one\nI\u2019m tremendously proud of. Holland, on the other hand, has had a long, historical tradition of\nreligious freedom, going back to William of Orange, and was probably also one of the reasons\nthat the Jews found receptive ground and receptive society, because they fled from so many\nplaces of persecution, including Spain. So -- and actually my -- my grandparents, my father\u2019s\nparents came -- now I don\u2019t know if they directly or their parents came up from Spain, but then\nactually that\u2019s something that I\u2019m hoping at some point to get back to The Netherlands and do\nsome of that research, because Holland and all other countries besides the U.S. have, of course,\nthis incredible record keeping and documents, archive stuff going back to the Middle Ages, and\nso I\u2019m hoping to do some of that research myself.",
        "Q: Right. Now, when -- when you remember back to that twilight when your father was taken, y-\nyl -- do you -- you remember these soldiers as being, or gestap -- we don\u2019t know what they are,\nyou don\u2019t th -- what th-they are.",
        "A: I think they were Gestapo, yeah.",
        "Q: You think they were Gestapo. They were polite with your father, so they weren\u2019t rough with\nhim?",
        "A: They very -- with -- these men, in my recollection were polite, they were soft-spoken, they\nwere not m -- you know th -- a -- I don\u2019t remember at that particular time whether there was a\nheil Hitler associated with the interaction. I don\u2019t remember if it was German or Dutch at that\ntime. I do remember at other times that it was German. And I do remember at other times -- a-\nand this is something now again, I can\u2019t swear to. I don\u2019t remember now whether I really heard\nthis, or whether my current knowledge fills in the heil Hitler, I don\u2019t know, but I am pretty sure\nthat some of those other times when he was arrested, I did hear it. I don\u2019t remember it the night\nthat he was arrested this time.",
        "Q: Did he say goodbye to you when he was arrested, do you remember?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. O-Or if he did it was probably -- again, I don\u2019t know if this was because he,\nas a parent he was trying not to create greater anxiety, or because he really thought he might be\ncoming back again, the way he always had in these past times. But I don\u2019t remember it.",
        "Q: But -- so does he leave with anything, or he simply leaves -- he just goes out?",
        "A: He just goes out.",
        "Q: He just goes out. So the door closes, and your mother now makes a very radical decision. And\nwhat 1s that?",
        "A: Well, in retrospect, I don\u2019t know how radical it was, but she basically grabbed a bag, and I\nstill remember the looks of the bag, it was sort of a yucky brown, n-no -- not an attractive bag,\nbut some sort of satchel [indecipherable] satchel of some sort of plastic or leather, or something,\nand throws in a hairbrush, and a toothbrush and -- for each of us, grabs our jackets, takes us by\nthe hand and walks out the door, literally walks out the door and closes the door behind her. And\nwe walked -- a -- a -- and we -- she -- we had to come down steps, it was up a couple steps, and\nwe came down s -- and walked into the street and I remember being aware of the fact that it was\ncurfew, because Jews were not allowed on the street, because there was a curfew. They were not\nallowed on the trolleys, they were not allowed in the libraries, they were not allowed in the\nparks. Alla -- aya -- they were not allowed in school. And -- and these decrees, by the way, were\nnot given all at once, they were -- this is why I keep reminding m-myself and others about the\nmind that was operating to keep upping the ante, to keep this level of normalcy, but just enough\nfear and enough intrusion into the way of life that 1t was clear who was in charge. So one decree\nwould be about you can\u2019t use the libraries, and you -- so you say to yourself, well, alright, we\ncan get along without the library. Next time it\u2019s the park. Well, you know, we\u2019ll play in the\nbackyard, we go -- we won\u2019t take walks. So it -- always it\u2019s also somehow to contain the\npopulation you\u2019re affecting, by making them adjust all the time. And -- and that adjustment,\nwhich is again something that if I -- if 1 can I may come back to later, but it\u2019s -- on the one hand,\nit\u2019s a peculiar characteristic of us humans, that we can adjust to an incredible amount of stuff\nbefore we say stop. And in one sense we should have said stop right there, and we should have\nrisen up and we should have said we won\u2019t take this. And of course there were efforts at doing\nthat, sporadically here and there. But by and large, the effect of this layering 1s to keep the people\nfrom not boiling the waters, and doing what I think Jewish populations have done since time\nimmemorial as guests in new societies, which is to say, well, you know, if we do what they ask,\nif we just comply with what people are asking us to do, then they\u2019Il leave us alone. But they\ndidn\u2019t leave us alone. And so that\u2019s -- that always is something that comes to my mind when\nthings happen, and I say, well should we accept this, or should we stand up and fight right here?\nAnd it a -- and one of these things happened in my town in Massachusetts where the question\ncame should we make a noise about this or should we not. And -- and the general feeling of the\nJewish community was led by the rabbi, which was, w-w-well, you know, we\u2019ll just let this go\nby kind of thing. And mine, s -- much to my surprise, cause I\u2019m not necessarily a person who\nmakes waves, but I said this is wrong. It\u2019s not right, and we should be -- here in America we\nshould be calling attention to the fact that this is wrong. But anyway, the effect of this layering,\nas I say, was -- w-was t-to keep people in compliance, and to, at the same time instill this\nmodicum of fear and anxiety. And -- and I -- I -- I don\u2019t know what my father\u2019s feeling was at\nthat point when he was taken away. I don\u2019t know whether he himself had an inkling that this was\ndifferent, or whether he really did think he was coming back, or -- I -- I -- I really don\u2019t know\nwhat they thought, and whether this is a question of radical behavior on my mother\u2019s part, yes\nand no, and it\u2019s probably a dual answer because as we walked across the city, and I longingly\nlooking at the trolleys, I remember that cause I was little kid and I was tired and I wanted to ride.\nAnd the trolleys, I remember this eerie feeling as the trolleys were going by and I was -- they\nwere totally empty. There would be one person sitting in the trolleys, because -- not that -- that\nthe non-Jews weren\u2019t allowed on the trolleys, but the general tenor in the -- in the country was\nbeginning to be much more concerned and so people weren\u2019t out going to the theater and doing\nstuff. And I remember us walking through the archway of the Rijksmuseum, which is a gorgeous\nVictorian building with all its towers and spires and so forth and part of it is arched over a\nroadway which at that time still had the old fashioned heavy cobblestones that were like little\nminiature hills, each one of them. And our steps were re-echoing in that archway as we walked\nthrough, and I remember feeling a certain amount of fear. Cause I knew we were not supposed to\nbe out. And I knew that my mother was afraid and that she was anxious and we had to hurry and\nwe had to be quiet. And I knew that we couldn\u2019t help ourselves, there was this clatter of the\nfootsteps. And so the sense that somebody might be coming for us, or coming after us was\ndefinitely there, in -- in my head at that time, because I remember the feeling. I didn\u2019t know why,\nbut I had the feeling. I knew that we were leaving and that we were going someplace else and we\n-- we -- the -- where we lived was called Amsterdam South, it was the southern part of the\ncountry, and -- o-of the city, and we went to Amsterdam West, which was across town, through\nthe western part, which was a much more commercial area.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s a big walk?",
        "A: It\u2019s a big walk. Well, for a little girl it was a big walk. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a horrendous walk\nnow. I -- I don\u2019t exactly know how far it is.",
        "Q: So you\u2019ve never retraced it?",
        "A: I\u2019ve never exactly retraced it, no. \u2019ve been to both neighborhoods again, but I don\u2019t think I\never walked it again.",
        "Q: Did your mother, when she was packing this bag, say, we\u2019re leaving? An-And do you recall\nthat it happened very quickly once the door was closed?",
        "A: It happened very quickly once the --",
        "Q: It did.",
        "A: -- door was closed. I sort of almost remember her giving us the jackets, and the fact that we\nwere leaving. How she did that, I don\u2019t know, but I think I knew we were leaving right away. I-I\ndon\u2019t think we even stopped to go to the bathroom. I [indecipherable] you always do what little\nkids are told to do before you go out. But it was just -- my recollection is there was no time to be\nlost. I mean, maybe she knew what these soldiers were trying to do. Maybe they were really\ngood people and trying to give her the high sign. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: But clearly, she probably had never heard the words, we\u2019ll come back for you later. Whatever\nthey were doing. Either they were really going to come back, or they were warning her.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Or they were just incompetent, who knows? But she may not have ever heard it.",
        "A: And -- that\u2019s right. I don\u2019t think they ever said it at any other time. I think any other time it\nwas a much more kind of belligerent, we\u2019re coming to take you to -- down to the station for\nquestioning, stuff. And questioning I -- I -- wi -- I have to ask my sister, but I have no idea what\nthis questioning was about.",
        "Q: Questioning was about.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t --",
        "Q: Well, you also don\u2019t know who your father was.",
        "A: Y-You mean --",
        "Q: A-As a --",
        "A: -- what else he might have been up to?",
        "Q: If -- as a -- [indecipherable] yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s true. Well, that\u2019s true, and of course there was this whole other activity that was going\non, that I only learned about later, which was -- well, some of which I n -- I was aware of, which\nis that everybody had to have identity cards, and the Jewish ones had a big J stamped on it. And I\nalso knew, and I -- this was before, I believe before my father was taken, that a friend of the\nfamily, who was a minister, actually provided us with fake baptism papers. Because -- I-I\nremember that at the time, and I remember sort of hearing about it, and perhaps even be -- being\ngiven one of those t-to have on my person. And of course, initially it was, I think as I mentioned,\nfirst when they started doing the calling up of Jews -- first of all, they also instituted another one\nof their pieces of madness. They started this thing called Joods Raad, which was basically\ntranslated as the Jewish councils. They -- they took various I-leaders within the Jewish\ncommunity and created a kind of a self governance piece, so that essentially they gave them the\norders of what they wanted done, and they made them responsible for carrying it out. So now\nwhat you\u2019re doing is you\u2019re creating this horrendous thing between people of the same marked,\nsteri -- stigmatized group and saying, you do the dirty work, you choose who\u2019s going to be called\nup next. You are the ones that promulgates the decrees of n-not -- no access of the schools and\nthis and that and the other. So the Jewish councils were having to do this to their own people.\nAnd the -- the -- the tendency to first of all condemn these people roundly, I think 1s very great,\nbecause you\u2019re saying, you know, what the hell were you doing tell -- sending us off to the -- be\nslaughtered. By the same token, I don\u2019t think they were all doing it from that perspective. I think\nsome of them were doing it because, as I said before, they thought that well, if we just comply\nwith that they\u2019re asking, and maybe I can help to keep my people sort of understanding that if we\njust keep calm and do what they ask, we can get through this all right. I think they were doing it\nfrom that perspective, some of them. I think others probably were doing it to save their own\nskins, sort of either realizing whatever was happening it wasn\u2019t good, but if they volunteered to\ndo this, then maybe they would not have to go. And I have to say that, coming through this\nexperience, I don\u2019t think any of us is ever able to say what we would or would not do under any\ncircumstances such as these. I don\u2019t think you know what you\u2019re capable of doing, I don\u2019t think\nyou know what you\u2019re capable of tolerating, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re cap -- yo-you have any sense of\nthe reality of w-what you might do if you or your family members were under siege or in peril of\nlosing their lives. I just think it\u2019s impossible.",
        "Q: D-Do you remember the certificate? W-Were you --",
        "A: Vaguely, I -- I --",
        "Q: -- actually carry -- you think you were carrying it?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if I was carrying it or whether my parents had them, to be able to produce them.\nBut the reason for these certificates also was that initially -- oh, I guess I lost track of the flow of\nthis, initially they called up the refugees from eastern Europe and deported those, and made nice\nspace available in Westerbork and so forth, and then they began to deport various among the\nJews. Now who they were and why these people were chosen, I don\u2019t know. And I don\u2019t know if\nperhaps my father was instrumental in perhaps helping other people get papers or something like\nthat, I don\u2019t know. This went -- first they started calling up the people who were full blooded\nJews. And then, when there were no more of those -- and of course, you say, or you might say,\nhow did they know who those people were? Well, this is where this incredible record keeping.\nAll they had to do was go to the municipal offices and get the birth records and the this and the\nthat and the other. And -- and they did that. They did an incredible amount of this kind of spade\nwork. So they would s -- first call up the ones who were hundred percent Jewish, and then they\nwould call up the people who were 75 percent Jewish. And then they would call up the people\nwho were 50 percent Jewish. And then they would call up the people who had -- the one ha-half\nof a couple who had intermarried, and they would leave the others. And this -- this is what gave\nrise to the papers. Could you show that you had not -- no -- were no longer Jewish? But it didn\u2019t\nhelp, because after awhile they said it didn\u2019t count, that -- you know, at first, yes, they\u2019d leave\nyou alone, cause now you were not Jewish. But then they would say, anybody who was born\nJewish. I mean they just --",

        "A: Ah, I certainly did not know at the time. I didn\u2019t know, for example, until much, much later,\nthat my uncle, my mother\u2019s brother had come from Vienna, and had fled Vienna and come to\nAmsterdam in order to take the boat to go to America. And this 1s the story I heard from him\nonce we came to the United States, that he talked to my folks and urged them to leave, and urged\nthem to drop everything and just come, and they didn\u2019t want to go.",
        "Q: And this was before the Nazi occupation?",
        "A: This would have had to be before --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- because he couldn\u2019t have gotten out, nor could they have gotten out. And apparently it was\nmy mother who didn\u2019t want to go, at least that\u2019s my recollection of the way this was told. And I -\n- I could be wrong about that, but -- and I often thought about this afterwards, and I thought, why\nwould she not want to go when this was on the horizon? And I think it was just such an\nincredible disbelief that this would ever. I mean, it\u2019s like so many things that face us, and you\nkind of think, no, I mean it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s probably just in human nature that you ke -- you have to\neither get your head in the wave rolling over you, or you have to be enormously courageous, or\nmaybe a little bit crazy, or even stupid by some people\u2019s judgment, to drop everything, to drop\nthis good job that she had, to leave this lovely house and all the -- the material things and take off\nfor no man\u2019s la -- I mean, America? [indecipherable] not that it was no man\u2019s land, in fact she\nhad an uncle I know who came back and brought her s -- her brother some gifts and brought her\nsome things from the United States and so on. So she knew about the United States. But she\napparently said no, but then my father -- so the story goes, my father who took my uncle to the\nboat, apparently said to him, if anything ever happens to us, will you see to my children? And,\nyou know, I\u2019ve heard this story repeated from my uncle, and then also from my sister, but I\ndidn\u2019t know about it. So if there was something pre-thought, or predicted, or anticipated, 1t must\nhave come from both the news and reading what happened around Europe and this was coming\ncloser and closer, and then actually having my father arrested. So, between my brother fleeing --\nmy -- her brother, my mother\u2019s brother fleeing, and saying to his sister, why don\u2019t you drop\neverything and come, and the actual things that happened after he left, they must have done some\nthings, including the fact that when we finally ended up at the home where we -- where we were\nhidden for the war, and led into the basement, there in the basement were two beds that I\nrecognized as having come from my home, and a quilt and some blankets that I knew were from\nhome. So --",
        "Q: So you haven\u2019t noticed that they were not in your house?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t notice that they were missing at all.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Had not registered this at all. Well, one of them was a trundle, and it was the bottom part of\nthe piece that would have gone under something. So that might be easy to miss. I\u2019m not sure\nwhere the other bed came from. I did not ever miss it, I didn\u2019t see it going out of the house. And\nthat must have been some doing cause it came off the first floor of the house, it had had to go\ndown the stairs, it had to be trucked. I-I don\u2019t know when that happened.",
        "Q: Right. I think that\u2019s what I mean when I say that\u2019s a kind of radical move, because while your\nmother was not willing to leave to go to America, she saw something as soon as your father --\nthat was a real arrest.",
        "A: Yeah, I think so.",
        "Q: And she knew she had to leave, and --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- they -- she didn\u2019t leave for nowhere. She knew exactly where she was going.",
        "A: Where she was going. And she must have done something to prepare for that eventuality.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I have no idea when those beds went there, because I never saw them go.",
        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Whether they were clandestinely moved in the middle of the night and I was asleep. No idea.\nNone. And the interesting thing about those things that were there also, was -- I mean there was\nno question that this quilt was from our house, and -- then of course there were three of us\nsharing these two beds then. There was something else there that I recognized. Upstairs in the\nlower shelves of the buffet were not only some staples that had been put there, which apparently\nmy folks had been responsible for putting there, there was also my mother\u2019s best china. It was a\nbeautiful set of china that I adored. It was sort of an ivory colored Rosenthal china with little\nroses on it. And I thought it was simply beautiful. And here my mother has chosen, of all the\nmaterial things, to bring that china. Not with her when we fled there --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- but obviously at some point beforehand.",
        "Q: And again, you hadn\u2019t noticed that that china was not in your house, or at least maybe she had\nsome pieces, so you wouldn't be confused.",

        "Q: And you were holding onto your mother\u2019s hand, and --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- your mother was holding both of the kids.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And also carrying this little bag. You --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- neither one of you were carrying anything, as far as you remember\u2019?",
        "A: Not in -- that I recollect. Not that I rem -- m-maybe my sister was, but I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Were you walking fast?",
        "A: Yes, you -- we were walking fast. Very -- it was very business-like --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- very quickly. A-And that probably also gave rise to my feeling of urgency, the fact that -- I\nnever thought about that, actually, til you asked that. But yes, we-well we were not sort of\nambling, by any means. We were very purposeful. And I think she was walking as quickly as she\ncould make me walk.",
        "Q: And she knew, obviously -- y-you didn\u2019t know this, but she knew exactly where she was\ngoing.",
        "A: Yes, no question.",
        "Q: She may have known the shortest route to get there.",
        "A: She may well have.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I mean, for all I know, there was only one, but she -- a-and maybe it wasn\u2019t the shortest,\nmaybe it\u2019s the one that might be le-least causing somebody to see us.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I-I -- I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: And this noise that you were hearing, was this only around the Rijksmuseum, or were -- there\nare a lot of cobblestones in Amsterdam.",
        "A: Ah, you\u2019re right. I think 1t was only because the cobblestone -- walking in the archway, re-\nechoed in that enclosed space.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right, right.",
        "A: So I was aware of both the sound as well as the echo of the sound, which I didn\u2019t hear\nelsewhere.",
        "Q: Well, we\u2019re going to stop the tape and then we\u2019 ll start with your going into this house. So\nlet\u2019s stop the tape.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "Q: Hedy, did your mother ever carry you in this trip, or you just -- you walked and ran to get to\nthis house?",
        "A: I-I don\u2019t remember her carrying me at all, no, if my recollection is right, h-he -- I am six years\nold.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So probably a little bit big for carrying. And I do have a recollection, actually, of my mother\nand my sister carrying me in some previous year when we were on vacation in what I think was\nScheveningen, which 1s the beach resort town not too far from Amsterdam. And for some reason\nmy dad wasn\u2019t either with us, or wasn\u2019t on this walk with us or whatever. And I got a thorn or\nsomething stuck in my foot, and I was complaining and making lots of unpleasant noises, I\u2019m\nsure. And my sister and mother made a little seat for me by crossing their hands like this, you\nknow, in four -- with four ways around, and carried me. So I\u2019m sure that if I felt the need to be\ncarried, I would have said something. And I have no recollection of her carrying me.",
        "Q: Of carrying you.",
        "A: Or the two of them carrying me.",
        "Q: Do you remember when you came to the house, where you were going to go 1n?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you know what happened? Remember?",
        "A: I -- Ido remember coming -- all three of us sort of huddling into this -- when we came to the\nstreet, the Jan Evertsenstraat, which I was not familiar with, I d-don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever been to\nbefore. And this s-street was different from my street, in that it was clearly a somewhat later\nperiod when it was built, because the housing was very much the same in the sense that the\nhouses were up tight against each other, there was not space in between. And it -- they went all\nthe way around the block, and it was a house floor and first, second and third apartment. But the\nhouse floor in this case, was the store, was the commercial establishment. And it had a store\nwindow. And so there was a portico between two stores, and in that portico, you had first of all\nthe -- on the left side the store entrance, then you had another entrance that went to the three\napartments upstairs, and then you had another apartment entrance for the three apartments in this\nside, and another store door that went into this place, which we now entered. And the store was a\nliquor store. And it turned out that my mom and my sister, which I now know, knew this person\nwho opened the door.",
        "Q: Your sister knew the person [indecipherable]",
        "A: My sister also knew her, but I don\u2019t think she knew of these preparations. I don\u2019t think so. In\nany case, we were basically whisked inside and -- a-and shown to -- through the store, into the\nback of the store, which was sort of -- these people were of very modest means, they were people\nwho were living in back of the store, which was not usually what people did. They had an\napartment someplace else in town, or perhaps upstairs above the store, but they tended not to\nhave as their permanent residence, the little bitty living spaces in the back of the ha -- of the\nstore. And when we came to the back of the store, and went out of the actual store part, there was\na little, small sort of in-between room, and in one end of the wall there was -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s often\nspoken of as a typical Dutch arrangement with the bed inside the wall. And in that recessed bed\nwas a much elderly man, and much older than the woman, and it was her husband, and he was\nalso ailing in some way, I don\u2019t remember exactly what. And -- and his name was Uncle John, I\nmean he was referred to as onc -- ome -- ome -- Oome Sjon. And then w-we were shown another\ndoor, and the door led down into the basement. And we went down the stairs in the basement,\nand there was a basement that ran all the way from underneath the storefront, all the way to the\nbackyard. And in the part underneath the storefront, this is how modestly, if not poor these\npeople were, their only son had a curtained off area that was his room, his place. And there were\nvery few material things there, or anyplace else in the house. And then we turned to go towards\nthe part that was closest to the backyard, and to these two sort of recessed, if you will, windows.\nI mean, it was sort of like -- I guess it\u2019s what you call a bulkhead, out in the yard. And instead of\na door there were these glass windows. But it meant that there was a sort of sunken well with --\nwith -- with some iron bars across the top where people stepped 1-in the yard. And -- and the only\nway to get any light or air would be to open those. And of course, it rains a lot in Holland as it\ndid then, and these wells would fill up with water, up to the top practically, and we had to -- I\nremember we took turns trying to siphon that out, by mouth, literally, to get the water out of\nthose things so that we could open them and have some air. But anyway, when we came into this\ncellar and went towards the yard part, that\u2019s where I saw two beds covered in quilts and blankets,\nor a quilt and -- and blanket that I remembered from my home. So that\u2019s when it first registered\non me, even at that young age, that somehow this was part of what the grown-ups had in mind,\nsomething that they\u2019d already planned. And that first night we just went to bed, that I remember.",
        "Q: Did -- did this woman ex -- do you think your mother called her before you left? Cause she\nclearly was not surprised when you came.",
        "A: No --",
        "Q: Cause you just --",
        "A: -- she wasn\u2019t surprised. I don\u2019t know. I really -- I have no recollection and I have also very\nlittle recollection of the use of the telephone the way we have it today. Well, never mind today,\nbut even some years ago, it just -- y --",
        "Q: But you had one?",
        "A: I don\u2019t even know that.",
        "Q: Ah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t even know that.",
        "Q: And who knows if this person had it, so I don\u2019t --",
        "A: Likely not. Likely not. I don\u2019t remember any use of the telephone in either family at any time,\nso it\u2019s very possible there wasn\u2019t one. And -- and I -- I do remember that there was no qu -- I -- I\ncan\u2019t say that we were expected, but it was sort of -- y -- she opened the door very quickly, and\nsort of very quickly saw us inside and closed the door. And then in the next few days, we were\ndown in the basement and we were -- the store was still operating, so the store was open and\nthere were people coming and going and so on. And -- and the -- the woman of the house, whose\nname was Katoos Koolhaas Revers, who we called Tante Toos, or cut -- it\u2019s a short form of\nKatoos, and tante, of course, is aunt. And she took care of the infirm husband, and the young son,\nwho was a few years older than my sister, so a teenager, and -- and the store, as long as it ran.\nAnd we were in the basement and then for a fairly short period of time, we were, every few days\nor so, were allowed to kind of come up in the yard and sit and have a cup of tea or something, for\na short while, as if to say to the neighbors who might have been looking in from three sides of\nthis block, 1f you remember how I spaced this out, who might have been wondering who were\nthese people that were suddenly over there. So we looked like visitors, or we were trying to act\nlike visitors. And during this period there were still lots of people on this commercial street.\nEvery day the stores would open, and of course you had your butcher and baker and gr-\ngreengrocer, and stationary store. I mean, you didn\u2019t go to the market there, th -- you went to the\nindividual stores, and you didn\u2019t have supermarkets, certainly, or grocery stores. And -- well,\nyou, yes you had grocery stores, but they only dealt with, let\u2019s say, dry good and so on. So at\nfirst it was decided that -- that it was okay for me to go out and meet -- mix and mingle with the\ncrowd because I -- and this is when I heard it said, that I looked the least Jewish. Now, what did\nthat mean? Uh-huh, and my guess is that since my sister is somewhat darker haired than I am,\nand also older, and might have been less comfortable pretending to be someone she wasn\u2019t, they\nthought it was okay for me to get out there and play and then just pretend that I was visiting an\naunt, in case I was stopped. And this was also when I was supposed to be somebody other than\nHedy Cohen, which was, of course, my maiden name, and in -- and I was drilled, actually, before\nbeing allowed out, to say that my name was Hedy Vermeulen, and that I lived at, you know,\nsome other place, but that I was visiting my aunt over here. That stopped fairly soon, that I\nwasn\u2019t allowed to go out any more.",
        "Q: Weeks, months, days? Do you have any recollection?",
        "A: I think weeks, but I certainly don\u2019t think it was months. In --",
        "Q: It was very dangerous for these people to keep you in the house.",
        "A: Oh, extremely dangerous, and there was a I-lot of -- and I didn\u2019t notice at the time, but having\ntalked to my sister about this in the meantime, there apparently was a lot of family dissension\nabout the fact that she had agreed to do this. And she apparently had a brother who was openly\nand outspokenly against it, and told her that she should just, you know, turn us in, that she\ncouldn\u2019t do this and shouldn\u2019t do this and so on. And somehow she prevailed. And -- and\nactually, when you asked before -- or maybe you didn\u2019t ask, but I said something about this -- the\nbusiness of the yards, and people being able to see. At this time the Nazis were doing something\nelse which 1s actually pretty well documented in -- in what\u2019s his name, Wyman\u2019s book.",
        "Q: David Wyman?",
        "A: David Wyman\u2019s book where he actually has photographs of these -- these broadsides that\nwould be appearing on corner kiosks and so forth, of which there were many, and it would\nannounce things like rewards for any tips that would lead to the arrest of someone who was\neither harboring Jews, or who was seen consorting with Jews, or who knew of Jews who were\nsomeplace or other. So the business of being seen, and the business of being in the yard, and the\nbi -- 1-1t -- 1t was a tremendous danger not just for us, but for the family who was sheltering us.\nAnd so this proved to be an enormous burden for -- for -- not only for the people who were doing\nthe hiding but the people who were being hidden, to the point that there is a lot of evidence of\npeople who apparently couldn\u2019t tolerate putting this kind of danger on the people they loved, and\nthey would get themselves arrested. They would either run out during a search, and run into the\nstreet somewhere far away from the house that they had been in. And they were usually shot, or\nrounded up, or brought in or whatever. But that was not an infrequent phenomenon, because it\nwas so terrible to -- everybody knew what was going to happen. And then the rewards were such\nthat, I mean, when you think of the pettiness of, you know, something the equivalent of a dollar,\nor five dollars, would be the reward if you could give the Nazis a tip that would lead to some\narrests or other. And people were out doing this. They were out trying to collect these rewards.\nAnd you didn\u2019t know who would and who wouldn\u2019t. So -- and in some cases I know it happened\nwithin families where -- and this might have been the case here, but it wasn\u2019t, where the brother\nwas So opposed to having his sister do this. But, to our knowledge he never --",
        "Q: He never did anything.",
        "A: He never did anything about it.",
        "Q: Once you are not allowed outside, because they were concerned, that meant you were inside\nfor a few years. Couple years.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Right?",
        "A: Well, was all told about th-three and a half.",
        "Q: Three -- three and a half years.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Wh-What was Tante Toos like?",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: Can you -- can you distinguish the -- the time when th -- that first year, cause unfortunately\nyour mother dies in 1944. So you\u2019re there for almost two years. And what 1s it like in the house\nwith all of you? The elderly father, Hans, the teenage boy, your sister, who is a teenager, your\nmother and this other woman. And the other woman is younger than your mother? Or about the\nsame?",
        "A: Yes. No, she\u2019s younger.",
        "Q: She\u2019s younger?",
        "A: She\u2019s younger.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Well, some of it actually is to be expected, in the sense that many people have the experience\nas parents of doing something together with other parents and there is a -- a disagreement about\nwhat youngsters can be allowed to do or not to do. So there was some of this tension between the\ntwo mothers. A-About what, I don\u2019t remember, do I have an example, no. I just knew it was\nthere. And because there was such a spread in ages, it was also difficult. There was s -- at least\nthen, before my mother died, there was this. There was also a kind of o-obvious -- and I -- and I\nhave to confess that this is a thought that came long after and not before. I knew there was\ntension between the two parents as mothers, and kids have an intuition about that stuff. But there\nwas something else and that had to do with the fact that clearly my mother -- my mother\u2019s\nfreedom as a mother and a parent, and her freedom as far as objecting to and disagreements, and\n-- | mean to -- to the kinds of disagreements, was severely limited because of the nature of this\nrelationship. We were totally and completely dependent on this family. So my mother must have,\nmany, many times, been severely pressed for patience and understanding and compromise and so\non. There was nothing she could do. I mean, basically her only alternative was to be quiet and\nacquiesce, or to leave. And -- and clearly she surely didn\u2019t want to do that, because there were\nthe two of us also. I don\u2019t know what she would have done if it was just herself. So there was\nprobably no real outlet for all that kind of frustration. Plus the fact that we were getting -- we\nwere getting some letters from my father, and they c -- apparently came from different camps as\nhe was being transported from one to the other, to the other, and then eventually the last |-letters\ncame from Auschwitz. And the letters were always censored. They were alway -- they had\nheavy, heavy black lines drawn through writing, and there was no way -- I remember my mother\nholding them up to the light and putting them over a bright light and on -- so forth and so on.\nThey could not see what was -- what was under that. And they came to us via a very roundabout\nroute, having to do with some of Tante Toos\u2019s family. I don\u2019t know if it was brother or brother-\nin-law, or how we got some of these things, but we did get these letters.",
        "Q: Because your father couldn't have sent them to you directly.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: Right? They would have had to have been sent -- so obviously, there are a number of people\nwho know where you are.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: There\u2019s -- there\u2019s some system going on.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And your parents must have been in touch not just with this woman, but within a context of a\nsystem, no?",
        "A: Within context of the system, I think that my mother or parents were only in touch with Tante\nToos. I think that she then did the --",
        "Q: Did the rest, I see.",
        "A: -- next steps and so on.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know this for positive, but I sort of think so. I-I -- I know that my sister has mentioned\nit several times, something of the family dynamic between the brothers and Tante Toos and --\nand how often there was friction because of the fact that they were not wanting the sister to do\nthis and so on. Then there was another dynamic that took place here in this confined quarter.\nFirst of all there was probably this -- this little kid who was always sort of -- sort of in-between\nand in the way and what have you. There was another dynamic going on between my sister and\nthe young boy, after a fairly short time. And every time I think about this whole experience, and\nas I then moved on in my life later and worked with young people and studied young people and\neverything else, I am always caught by the uniqueness of that ad-adolescent era that each of us\nhas, but which in my sister\u2019s case was so totally rent asunder, so that just at the point when life\nopens up for you and you\u2019re no longer quite a child and you\u2019re now moving into domains of\nknowledge and you\u2019re beginning to have some feeling of what the world\u2019s about, and when you\nstart thinking about future and making plans and having relationships, and having groups of\nfriends, and beginning to pull away from your -- your parental u-unit as the kids used to say. And\nthis must have been so hard for her to have this cut off. Yes, I was disappointed I couldn\u2019t go to\nschool and so on, but the -- to compare that to what must have happened to my sister, 1t must\nhave been so awful, to have everything just kind of collapsed, to have everything just sort of\nliterally having the rug pulled out from under you and now you are in this sort of prison, sort of\nconfinement, really. And then the knowledge that our very lives and futures depended on being\nable to s -- to make the most of what we have here, and to be able to get along, and to be able to\nmake it work. And -- and some of this has been written quite beautifully by Anne Frank, and --\nwhere she talks about some of these dynamics between the rescuer and the protectors, and the\nfamily and the internal stuff. And yeah, there was a lot of that going on.",
        "Q: So was there a kind of romance between Hans and Betsy, your sister?",
        "A: Yeah, I think so --",
        "Q: Or the beginnings of one, yeah.",
        "A: -- it -- certainly the beginnings of one, and I think certainly by the time the three and a half\nyears ended, there was more of it, and I think then, for that one year that we were still there after\nthe war, I think there was more of it, and then some knowledge of -- of some new people her age\nthat she -- his good friend and so forth. I th -- I think that this was really tough. A-And I think\nthere were expectations on her part when we came to America that this might continue and it\ndidn\u2019t and she had sort of no place to go with her feelings. So that -- that was terribly difficult.\nTerribly difficult. And I think that the -- the sense on the part of Tante Toos was very -- I mean, I\nthink she really -- she cared, if not immediately, she certainly came to care for us very deeply.\nAnd -- a-and again, as they say, afterwards, when my mother died, there was a new set of\ntangents, because she felt, I think in a very real sense, that it was her role as the adult maternal\nfigure, to be the caretaker and caregiver. I think my sister felt, as the person closest to me, and\nnow the older, responsible adult, that she should be the one to basically kind of take the initiative\nabout what I should do or not do and what things I might be criticized for or not, as the case may\nbe. So there\u2019s the tension between those two.",
        "Q: Between those two.",
        "A: During much of this time when we were in hiding, again my poor sister was put to the task of\nteaching me, because here I had two weeks of school and no schooling again, so it was her job to\nteach me basic arithmetic and reading and writing and -- and so forth. We -- and she did a great\njob with that, and I\u2019m not sure I could have equaled doing that, cause I must have been a real\npain in the neck to -- to -- to deal with. And there was no television and no VCR and no\ncomputer, and no Gameboy and no, you know, record player, n-no radios, we weren\u2019t allowed to\nhave radios, al-although we did have a radio, it was not permitted. Now again, really another\nexample of -- of this madness and planning. Here you have a -- an occupied population and you\ncut off all their means of getting news from the outside. You tell them they have to turn in all the\nradios. So this -- this clandestine radio virus was already a first move of rejection of these\ndecrees that our host family was part of, because there was -- no one was allowed radios, not just\nJews, no one. And initially there were -- there were beginning to be food shortages after the\nbeginning of this time when we were -- we -- we literally ducked under -- the Dutch word\nonderduiken 1s -- is to duck under, and that\u2019s literally what we were doing. And -- and --",
        "Q: What does that mean?",
        "A: Onderduiken means to duck under.",
        "Q: Wha -- wa -- duck under, but wa -- what are you ducking under? You mean, bu -- by hiding,\nyou --",
        "A: We were -- we -- we\u2019re saying onderherduiken, which is we went into hiding, this is how you\nwould translate it --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- but literally translated it is --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] under.",
        "A: -- we ducked under. You know, not necessarily what --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- but the fact 1s that we did that. And initially there were ration cards handed out for available\nfood. And of course, instead of three people there were now six people in this house. And so it\nfell to Hans to -- the young boy, to go out and scour up -- I don\u2019t know how, black market,\nwhatever, to go find more ration points, and -- cards. And so he did that reasonably successfully\nuntil there wasn\u2019t any more food that was handed out, and -- and little by little the shops all\nclosed, one after the other, after the other, and had heavy wooden shutters to protect them from\nvandalism and people growing quite desperate for food. And then for awhile they had set up\nsoup kitchens, where you could come with your ration points and get potato peel soup and that\ncame back with Hans and he would -- we would all share that, of course. And -- and even the --\nthe liquor store now was closing, cause there was nothing, there was -- there was no more liquor\nleft for the population and so that -- those doors closed. And there were bottles of colored water\nthat were in the display window and so on. But he would go and -- and occasionally try to dig up\nsomething and apparently came back once with a smoked eel, one eel. And Holland\u2019s specialty\nof course, 1s all versions of fish, of all kinds. Smoked and pickled and you name it. And the one\neel was divided among six people. And the piece that I got was the one that had the head. And\nwhat I didn\u2019t realize is that there was a h-hook in the head, and trying to get every last morsel of\nedible food out of this thing, I got the fishhook stuck in my tongue. And we are now in the\nbasement, right, and I knew somehow, don\u2019t ask me how, that I shouldn\u2019t make a noise, that I\nshouldn\u2019t scream, that I -- and even that spontaneous reaction that you think I would have had,\nwas suppressed. Which probably came from by now having lots of times being told, don\u2019t make\nany noise, you\u2019ve got to keep quiet, you can only whisper, and so on. Because for the first part of\nour hiding, the -- there was activity going on upstairs and there were people in and out of the\nstore. And so we couldn\u2019t really talk, we couldn't really make any noises. And -- and somehow I\nremembered this, and my mother came over and she worked the fishhook out of my mouth and --\nand that was that. But that -- again, how did I know how -- how did I control that impulse? I\ndon\u2019t know, I just did. You sort of wonder often about how it is that you do those things as a\nsmall child, or a big child. I mean, big child I think it\u2019s mo -- it\u2019s a little easier to figure it out.\nWhen you\u2019re a small child, you kind of say, how did that work, you know? What was in my\nhead? And I don\u2019t know what was in my head. I think I just felt it, just felt the whole\natmosphere, the whole -- whole sense of -- everything was dangerous, everything about life was\ndangerous. And so you -- you kept a low profile and you didn\u2019t talk loud and you didn\u2019t scream\nand -- awful really, when you think about the effect of that on a small kid.",

        "Q: Hedy, was there a special time when your sister was doing home -- essentially home\nschooling? Would she do it in the morning, or the afternoon, or the evening, or wasn\u2019t there a\nparticular time?",
        "A: I don\u2019t have a -- any recollection that there was a particular time. I don\u2019t even remember what\nactually transpired in those sessions. I don\u2019t think that they lasted all of the time that we were in\nhiding, but they lasted long enough to get me to be able to read. And -- and I\u2019m sure she did\nsome -- S-See again, we ha -- we had nothing, we ha -- we even had no paper. You couldn\u2019t get\nanything any more. You couldn\u2019t get crayons, you couldn\u2019t get colored -- well, we didn\u2019t really\nhave crayons like they have Crayolas here. We had colored pencils and we had a few because\nwhen the newspapers were still being published -- which also stopped, but while they were being\npublished we didn\u2019t have the comic section like you do here, but we did have one which I\nrecognized later was a political cartoon and -- and it was on the back of the front page of De\nTelegraaf, which was the sort of -- s-sa -- probably right of center newspaper. And I would cut\nout -- after people had gotten through with the paper, I would cut out this little two or three frame\nthing and -- and color it with a few colored pencils that we had and that\u2019s one way I kept busy.\nAnd I loved these characters, I thought they were just so much fun, but again, I was an animal\nlover. And this was tom poes, which was tomcat, and Ollie B. Bommel. And Ollie B. Bommel\nwas a bear, and he was a pretty dumb bear. And so it was always the smart cat who was rescuing\nhim out of awkward situations or correcting his erroneous thinking. And so the political stuff\nkind of came through that. And this was my p-precious possession from -- from all of those\nyears, and it\u2019s one of the few things that I had at the end of the war, cause I collected all these\nthings until they stopped publishing, and I took them with me to America, and I kept them in the\nattic and so forth and so on, and then at some later date many years later when I met my husband\nand he came to visit at the house and so forth, and I told him about this. And he said, \u201cOh,\u201d he\nsaid, \u201cdo you have those around?\u201d I said oh yeah, and so I brought them down from the attic, and\nhe opened the box and he grabbed them and the first thing he did was flip them over on the other\nside, because there were the headlines of what was going on during those early years. And I\nhaven\u2019t tried to piece those headlines together, but I have started to do some research now on --\nactually on the original newspapers, to see what was the context within which all of my personal\nexperience was taking place.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Because now, as an adult, I\u2019m interested in knowing -- a-and not only interested in knowing,\nbut I\u2019m so appalled at some of the things that you keep seeing repeated and repeated and\nrepeated in history. Not the least of which was these kinds of left, right and so forth debates\nabout how to interpret what the Nazis were doing, and so I actually have been looking at some of\nthe newspapers on the left, and some of them on the right and some of the underground\nnewspapers which were being published. And some of that has proven to be very interesting --\nvery interesting to read.",
        "Q: Were you bored?",
        "A: During these years?",
        "Q: Yeah. Or antsy, or --",
        "A: Well, I --",
        "Q: You know what I mean, I mean --",
        "A: It -- it\u2019s a very hard question to answer because on the one hand I must have been, but on the\nother hand I don\u2019t remember it. Now one thing that I remember doing, I -- I know that because of\nthe severely confined circumstances in which we were, and if you remember, I mentioned the\nfact that these people were not very well off in this little daytime place for -- for the proprietors\nof the -- of the shop, th -- but the shop was part of the Chrispijn liquor store chain. It was a big,\nwell-known company, and -- and Tante Toos was the proprietress of this -- this particular one\nstore. But part of what -- what was also very difficult is that because it was only meant for\ndaytime habitation, there was only a little half bathroom. There was only a toilet with a little\nteeny sink, just enough to wash your hands, as most toilet rooms are in -- in Europe. An-And\nthere was no shower, and there was no bathtub. So matters of hygiene had to be taken care of\nrather differently, in basins and lots of hand washing and so on. And lots of washing, I mean.\nAnd also, I think what was -- I mean, this actually took time, I mean you had to carry water in\nbasins and bring it downstairs and so on. And I remember my mother 1-in very short order,\ndecided I had to cut my -- or she was going to cut my long hair, cause I had long pigtails. And I\nremember not being very happy about that, but there wasn\u2019t any question, it wasn\u2019t do we have\nto, it was just -- it was done. Because she saw no way to keep washing hair in this difficult,\nconfined situation. The other thing that happened during this time is when I learned to read, I\nfound that Hans, our gentle, young man in the house, probably the only thing the guy owned was\na set of books that was in his part of the cellar, which had been curtained off, and it was on a\nshelf in his part of the cellar. It was a series of books about the American Indians, about the\nApaches in particular. And it was a series written by what I understand is an Austrian author,\nwho apparently never set foot in the States, and I understand has done amazingly accurate\nwritings and portraits of what went on among the Apaches. And I devoured those books,\nprobably --",
        "Q: This is Karl May, I think, yes?",
        "A: Yes --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Exactly, Karl May, and -- and the -- the image in my mind was always of this proud,\ncourageous American Indian, of course, the Apache. And I just read those books over and over\nand over again. There wasn\u2019t anything else, there was no paper, there were no magazines. There\nwas not a collection of children\u2019s books in the house. There was not -- there were very few books\nof any kind around the house. So this series, this whole series was just, you know, very precious\nto me, and -- and I spent a lot of time reading that.",
        "Q: So you learned to read very quickly, though, right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Cause you -- you s -- in \u00b042, you were six.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So by the time the war ends you\u2019re only nine anyway.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So when you\u2019re seven or eight, you\u2019re reading Karl May?",
        "A: Yeah. Probably seven.",
        "Q: Probably seven.",
        "A: Right. And they were big, thick, wonderful books. Yeah.",
        "Q: Did -- did you have to stay downstairs in the cellar all day and all night, or could you come\nupstairs in the evening, what --",
        "A: In the beginning, I-I think I mentioned we could go outside a little bit and that -- but that\nstopped within weeks. And then we had to stay downstairs certainly all day. And in the evening\nwhen it was really good and dark, we would come upstairs and spend some time upstairs, usually\nhuddled around this clandestine radio, or as -- in fact, I seem to remember that we did not eat\nupstairs, so -- and -- and speaking of the eating as -- I think I was telling you about the potato\npeel soup. You know, after that -- after that stopped, there was nothing. There was absolutely\nnothing, and everything was shuttered and everything was a ghost town, all the stores were\ncompletely shuttered down with wooden protection shutters and so on. And -- and we heard\nstories about people doing all kinds of desperate things, you know, hunting down pets that\nbelonged to somebody [indecipherable] or something, in the streets, and -- and going out to the\ncountry to try to find rabbits and so on. And another element of my parent\u2019s planning for this\npossible eventuality came in the sense that aside from the beds that I saw there, and the quilts\nthat I saw there, when I came upstairs one day and saw also this set of dishes that I mentioned\nbefore, there were, next to the set of dishes were bags, large bags of staples. Just the way you\nfind them in a natural food store, they were sacks of raw beans and peas and -- and barley and\nrice and -- I don\u2019t remember specifically which ones, but ther -- there were all these staples,\nwhich really saved all of our lives, because I was fr -- I-I was quite stunned, actually, to read in\none of the papers I had been looking at, that they figured that some -- something between 1700\nand 2500 people died simply of starvation in the city. And we were just very fortunate to have\nhad this that we could then share with our family. Which -- which certainly saved us. But then\nthat ran out, and that was still -- the war was still on. Also my -- my mother was a bit of a --\nprobably natural food type vitamin person and she had had -- also saved and put aside vitamins\nand -- and especially calcium pills, which -- I -- I -- I -- I\u2019ve had rather troubles with teeth, which\nare thought to have had some basis in the war deprivation. But that -- that was part of what was\nthere, and then when that ran out, then also electricity was out, gas was out, so you had nothing\nto cook on, you had n-no lights. There was -- for awhile there was wood for the woodstove, the\ncoal stove, 1 -- of course, coal was long gone -- in the living room, but then Hans would go out to\nthe countryside and -- and dig peat, blocks of peat that he would really, literally drag back to --\nu-undercover at night. And then after that, a-and there was no more food, he went out in the\nfields and dug up sugar beets and tulip bulbs, which we basically ground into some kind of\nmush, and tried to cook, as long as we had anything to cook on. And -- and that\u2019s how we\nsurvived during -- during this time. It was horrible stuff, but 1t was what kept us going.",
        "Q: There\u2019s no kitchen in the basement.",
        "A: There is no kitchen in the basement, right.",
        "Q: So did your mother cook for you upstairs, did Tante Toos --",
        "A: No, I believe Tante Toos did.",
        "Q: She cooked for everybody.",
        "A: At some --",
        "Q: And you ate downstairs, I think.",
        "A: I believe we ate downstairs most of the time. Certainly in the beginning and I think later on\nwhen the store was actually closed, and if we ate later we were upstairs, gen -- it was dark. Now,\nthe store, I have to also indicate to you, the store\u2019s display window was maybe at, you know, this\nchair height.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And ran in sort of a semi-circle from let\u2019s say the length of this room wall, and extended back\nmaybe three feet or so. And then starting at the height of the display window were mirrors\nembedded into a wooden screening. In other words, it was wood to the house side, and it was m-\nmirror to the street side, so that all these bottles were mirrored in -- and when you walked by you\nsaw this profusion of bottles and so on. But this wall of mirrors only came up to about five feet,\nso you could look over it and see people, and see into the living quarters in the back. So there\nwas never any movement above that height, or in the back of the house during the daytime. And\nat night it was only by -- by being lower than those things in the back or having the lights off --\nonce the lights were off anyway because there was no electricity, it was a little bit easier for us to\nmove around. But that\u2019s also when we were having these terrible street searches and house\nsearches, where these Gestapo would be patrolling and -- at random, or based on some word that\nthey got from somebody, would actually go and do a house search. You know, tear the place\napart, and --",
        "Q: Was your house ever searched, the house where you were staying?",
        "A: Several times, actually, and when the worry about this became so great that we were afraid to\nbe in the cellar -- again, I don\u2019t know whose idea it was, I don\u2019t know how the grown-ups\nplanned this and talked about it, but it was decided that we should hide under this display\nwindow in this three foot wide stretch that was under -- that -- that was, you know, probably\nthree feet off the ground and three feet wide, but maybe 10 or 18 feet long. I don\u2019t know how\nlong, 18 feet maybe. And there was a little door in the store side to this, and the little door could\nopen up and then they usu -- usually they kept cases of empty bottles there, or beer -- extra beer\nsupplies, or whatever. So what they did is they took those bottles and crates out of there, we\nwould go in there at night and they would put the empty crates back behind us and then close the\ndoor. So the three of us would be in there, and on the street side it was just a -- you saw brick up\nuntil the level of the display window, and there were two little grates where you could get some\nair in this part, and my recollection was always that we were either hunched over, or somehow in\nsome, you know, very uncomfortable position, cause there were three of us in this tiny space.\nAnd that one of us was always sort of on the alert that no one else would make noise. I know my\nguess 1s that my mother was always on the alert. Because the noises, the breathing, the sneezing,\nwhat have you, the snoring, could be heard through these vents outside. And you never knew if\nsomebody was actually patrolling the streets, or was out on the street and being silent because\nthey were waiting to catch you, or waiting to have -- to be able to observe one misstep, based on\nsome, you know, intuition they might have had. So you never knew whom to trust, you never\nknew what was going on, you never had -- you always had this sense of watchfulness, of -- and -\n- and I\u2019m sure that that was part of the anxiety, was probably watchfulness that I was feeling on\nthe part of the adults. And -- and we spent a lot of time in there, and it was a good thing because\nsome of those searches did, in fact, th -- the soldiers went into the basement. It was a logical\nthing, there was a door. I mean, you know, they would have been stupid not to open that door.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t even know if you know the answer to this question, but how would they account for\nthe fact that there is this bed there? These two beds?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, because I don\u2019t remember --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- if they did anything about those beds when we weren\u2019t in them. Whether they had some\nexplanation, like you know, so -- if -- if Hans\u2019s friends stayed over --",

        "A: -- I -- I have no idea.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: No, I can\u2019t answer that.",
        "Q: Were you more frightened by having to go into this little crawl space than you were -- I mean,\ndid you become more -- did you become more anxiety prone because of that, or was it all just\nsort of nerve-wracking in some way?",
        "A: Ah. Mm-hm. I don\u2019t remember. I -- I don\u2019t really know how to remember it, because --",
        "Q: But you remember going in there?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, and I remember having to duck down so that we wouldn\u2019t be seen, and of\ncourse we had to go into the store proper, and walk from the back of -- of --",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: -- of the store, which you could see when -- because you could look over this mirrored thing -",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- and get to that little entryway which was right below the mirrors. So we basically had to\nkind of keep -- duck out of sight and get in there.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So I do remember that very distinctly. And I also remember that -- that several things then\nhappen as the war got worse and worse. And I remember sitting in the dark and huddled around\nthe -- the radio, and sitting by moonlight, and -- and I remember listening to the BBC, and I\nremember, you know, occasionally hearing something from the queen, and then hearing\nsomething from Churchill. And I also began to recognize, even as a child, that somehow I made\nthe deduction that if you heard the words Churchill and Montgomery and Eisenhower and\nRoosevelt that things were going better, and the adults seemed somewhat less anxious. And if\nyou heard Hitler and Himmler and Goebbels and -- I could always -- I knew that they were going\nto be tense and upset. And -- and we did hear, actually, a fair amount of bombing, although\nAmsterdam was not flattened the way Rotterdam was. There were certainly constantly air raids\nand sirens and planes flying overhead and some areas were bombed because the -- I know some\npart of the hospital was bombed, and I know the hospital had -- and the reason I know that,\nbecause after the war I became very ill, and I had to go to that hospital. But -- but during this\ntime, there is that well documented difference in the way the allied planes sounded from the way\nthe axis planes sounded, that -- the Nazi planes. And I remember the first time going to some\nfilm that had that in it, that -- that sort of unnerved me because there it was, there were those\nsounds that I remembered.",
        "Q: What was the difference, do you remember?",
        "A: The -- the German planes were all sort of loud and sputtering and the motor sounds, probably\nwithout any mufflers and things like that. And also the nature of whatever the make was. And the\nMesserschmitts I think were some of those fighter planes that were always very noisy. And allied\nplanes had a sort of low, humming sound. Now this may have had to do both with the motor\ndesign and also with the altitude at which they flew, I don\u2019t know. But boy, did we know it. But\nthe end result often was the same in that you had to go into air -- air raid shelters, which we, of\ncourse, didn\u2019t. But the sirens would go off for that [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Where -- when you were sitting and listening to the radio, you said you were sitting at -- and\nthere was moonlight?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Were you sitting in the back of the house near the courtyard?",
        "A: Not in the courtyard, and probably not within view of any of the windows. I remember sort of\n-- the one side of the room had this little stove, so it\u2019s not likely we were sitting there, and it was\nsomewhere in the wall area, or near the wall area that separated the kitchen from the living area\nsomehow -- it was not in full view of that courtyard, no.",
        "Q: Could you use the bathroom during the day? Did you have to be careful of any sound so that\nnobody could think there were six people in the house?",
        "A: Right. I don\u2019t remember about the bathroom. I really don\u2019t remember about the bathroom. I\njust don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: When you got older, did you ask your sister about getting her period when she was there?",
        "A: I never asked her.",
        "Q: You never asked her.",
        "A: I never asked her. I didn\u2019t think about it, actually, until many, many years after that. But then\nsomehow it\u2019s not come up 1n the several times that we\u2019ve -- but yeah, there were those --",
        "Q: Because I imagine it would be tho --",
        "A: I thought about it. I thought about it --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- what it must have been like, yeah.",
        "Q: Cause it must have been very uncomfortable, I would think. Unless because you had so little\nfood, she didn\u2019t get her period very much.",

        "Q: A total -- right.",
        "A: A total blank. Yeah, the -- and the hygiene involved in all that must have been exceedingly\ndifficult, exceeding -- I -- I do have some vague recollection of my mother cooking big pots of\nwater on the stove, as long as we had the gas going, and washing clothes in the -- and bringing\nthat hot water downstairs and washing clothes.",
        "Q: Huh. And she would bring it downstairs?",
        "A: That\u2019s what I remember, but I don\u2019t know if I actually saw that, or if I just surmised that.",
        "Q: Cause it would seem to be difficult --",
        "A: Very difficult.",
        "Q: -- to do it.",

        "A: In the basement --",
        "Q: In the basement.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And far away from those front windows --",
        "Q: Yeah.",

        "A: Yes, oh yes.",
        "Q: You did? Was he nice to you?",
        "A: Oh, he was very nice. He was -- y-you know, I was this little kid, and he always knew how to\nhumor a little kid, and -- so I was probably a bit pest-y between those two and -- but -- but yeah,\nI did | -- I did like him. I did like him.",
        "Q: It seems like he was very helpful sort of a young man.",
        "A: He very much was, yeah, and I -- I guess one of the big, enormous differences of course in --\nin these situations, you -- you sort of think of your -- you know, sort of average teenager in -- in\nAmerica, in this land of -- of plenty and more than plenty, and you think about kids who, you\nknow, don\u2019t really seem to behave in a very mature way. And how is that these kids did? Well, I\nthink one big difference is the fact that this was for real. This wasn\u2019t any fun and games. And I\nthink that kids grow up very fast under demand of -- of survival. And I think that -- I -- I think\nthat you, on the one hand, have to have some ability to be resilient, but at the same time, you\nhave to have some judgment about what needs to be done in these situations, and being\nirresponsible just doesn\u2019t have a place here, although I have to say, I remember being -- having --\ncoming down with a cold or something like that, and -- and my sister bringing me a cup of tea,\nand I -- and a thermometer, and telling me to take my temperature, and I thought, oh this is hot\ntea, it might be fun to see what the temperature of the tea is. I stuck the thermometer in the tea\nand it promptly exploded, the mercury all over the place, and I was, you know, not in anybody\u2019s\ngood graces, cause there were no stores where you could get a new one, so that was it, the\nthermometer was gone. Had I thought it would explode I\u2019m sure I wouldn\u2019t have done it, but I\ndidn\u2019t know. And I thought, I wonder how hot the tea 1s.",
        "Q: And it was a little dangerous, although you wouldn\u2019t have known that, for the mercury to be\nrolling around. Not that there\u2019s that much, but it\u2019s dangerous.",
        "A: Certainly didn\u2019t know that.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I certainly didn\u2019t know that. You know, so that was a -- those were all very big issues, which\nsomehow in the overall scheme of things have either been suppressed or lost in my mind because\nthey didn\u2019t register, or -- somehow. And it\u2019s kind of interesting to ask yourself, why did this\nexperience register versus some other experience. And it\u2019s been very interesting in talking about\nthis too, is what suddenly triggers another bunch of memories, you know?",
        "Q: Right, right, right. It\u2019s hard to know the answer to that question, isn\u2019t it?",

        "A: I don\u2019t remember exactly. I don\u2019t know whether she did initially and then stopped, or whether\nshe kind of summarized the letter, or gave -- and I don\u2019t know if she read some to my sister, and\nsome to me. I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Do you get closer to your mother during this period than you were bef -- before, since you\nseemed to be much closer to your father? Does this intimate setting and being thrown together\nthis way create a different relationship?",

        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure that the proximity added a good deal to it. And I didn\u2019t mean to paint some of the\nearly years as necessarily negative, cause I have other r-recollections of, you know, of be --\nbeing -- playing out in a field with her or something, or -- in fact, I have some little pictures of\nme as a toddler playing in the Vondelpark, you know, the big park in Amsterdam.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I -- I guess as a small child the negatives outweighed the positives because perhaps I took for\ngranted all the positives and only remembered those things that she said no, I couldn\u2019t touch the\nhorse, and you know, don\u2019t get close to the horse cause he might kick you and so forth. And so\nthat was where my will was being thwarted in a sense, and so maybe that\u2019s why I remember that.\nNo, I remember -- and I remember -- I remember her death, unfortunately, very, very well,\nbecause I shared the bed with her, and she died in her sleep.",
        "Q: She died in her sleep? So she wasn\u2019t sick?",
        "A: She wasn\u2019t sick, and I remember that what I was told, or what maybe others were told or\nothers talked about, they kept saying that she dri -- died of a broken heart, given what was\nhappening to my father and so on. But what I\u2019m surmising now is that she probably died of a\nstroke.",
        "Q: So y -- you wake up, and she\u2019s dead? That must have been awful for you.",
        "A: It was awful. It was awful.",
        "Q: Did you scream? No.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember what I did. I -- I really don\u2019t remember what I did.",
        "Q: Do you remember knowing that she -- that sh -- sh-she wa -- did you try to wake her, do you\nthink?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I-I have no recollection of what I did immediately upon sensing -- upon\nwaking and sensing that she was not in her natural state. I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: But you knew that it was something extremely different. And she was maybe what, 50\nsomething years old, or less?",
        "A: I\u2019m guessing that she was in her early 50\u2019s, only because I was eight by then, and I think she\nhad me in her late 40\u2019s --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- but, like, you know, if she was -- well, mid-40\u2019s, so -- I -- I -- I don\u2019t know. I should\nactually figure that out because I -- I looked up her birthdate at some point, she was in August. I\ndon\u2019t know how old she was.",
        "Q: Do you now know --",
        "A: She was ol -- she was -- must have been born in 1896 now that I think about it, because my\nuncle was born in 1900, and she was the oldest, and then I think he was the middle, and then\nthere was another sister. And the other sister, in fact, I found all this material after -- after my\naunt died. I found a trunk of material in the garage, which was all of the correspondence that they\nhad had, and my uncle particularly had had over -- since he came to America, first of all,\napparently trying to get his parents out of Vienna and appealing to the em -- embassy about\ngetting his parents out of danger, and writing to them about the fact that he had come in 1930\nwhatever, and he was now able to take care of himself and his -- hi wa -- had brought his wife\nover and had a good job and so forth, and that he would vouch for them and take care of them,\nthat they would not be a burden on the welfare system and so forth. And that letter that came\nback was a letter from some state department person saying -- 1t was almost -- it was almost a\nlittle sharp, maybe wasn't meant that way, but it was sort of like we\u2019re glad that you -- that you\nare a-able to take care of yourself, and -- and self-sufficient and so forth and so on, but that does\nnot give you any special privileges. It does not push you ahead of the line of getting people into\nthe country. And then there were letters from ha -- my other aunt, who had apparently hoped to\nget to -- I think to South America and ended up in -- in Cuba, I think in Havana for awhile,\nbefore she was able to get to America. And my aunt -- and letters that my uncle and aunt sent to\neach other when she was still in Vienna and she stayed behind because she was trying to get\nvisas f -- to get her parents and her s -- older sister out to Australia, and all -- and also a meisje, a\nyoung woman who worked for them and who had been like their governess and so on. And she\nsucceeded in doing that, and some of the stories she told about how she did this, how she stood\nin line day after day after day to try to convince the authorities that they should give her these\nvisa for her parents. How she -- she told the stories about some young guy who was really very\nsweet on her, but she didn\u2019t care about him, and he turned out to be one of the soldiers guarding\nthe line of people standing in line for these visas, and how she kind of maneuvered her way\ntowards the front of the line in terms of this guy, who was now a Nazi, and who made no bones\nabout it. But still was kind of interested in her, and I guess allowed her a couple of notches up the\nline. And she described to me a couple of times, unfortunately I never got it down, as to what it\nwas like when she went into this enormous room where this Nazi commandant was, and where\nshe had to plead for these visa and exit permits and so forth. And immediately she was addressed\nas a Jewess, and -- and in German she quoted to me what he said to her, you know, what -- what\ndoes this Jewish -- Jewess want, kind of thing, and -- she was an amazing woman, just a gutsy\nlady with -- with, you know, just a sort of indomitable spirit that I hope all of us can have a piece\nof, but --",
        "Q: And so th --",
        "A: -- and she was -- then -- then she got them out. Her brother, who had been in medical school -\n- in fact, she had wanted to go to medical school, but her father, who had once been quite well-\nto-do, apparently had lost a lot of money and when she, who was older, started medical school,\nand then her brother came along, he said I\u2019m sorry, I only have money for one person to go to\nmedical school, and he yanked her out and he put him in. But she loved this brother, she -- she\nwould do anything for this brother. In fact, she used to tell me how -- how she got him to play\nthe -- the moonlights -- Beethoven\u2019s \u201cMoonlight Sonata\u201d by promising him a little money when\nhe was a student and he had no money. And then she went -- she became a clothes designer and\nseamstress, and she had this apparently lovely atelier in Vienna, where she designed clothing for\nthe opera, and for the stage and so on. And anyway, her f -- her brother married a young Dutch\nwoman who turned out to have been the daughter of the leading communist in Holland. So he\nemigrated to Russia. And when they got to Russia, he was promptly jailed because he was a Jew,\nand she was jailed because she was foreigner. So they were shipped off to Siberia, because they\nwere both doctors, medical doctors and they needed them. So they were saved because of -- of\nbeing doctors, and they were paid in bags of potatoes, basically, for their services. And he was in\n-- h-he was imprisoned and everything, he was ter -- a terrible life. Terrible li -- I mean, those are\nall the side pieces of the main pieces that --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- that happened here. Was just incredible. And -- and I remember my aunt telling me the\nstory of how she -- she had gotten her family out and then she had an elderly uncle that she was\ntaking care of, and he was really in terminal illness at this point in time. I think in -- but he had\nbeen a single uncle who had gone to America, and had come back and brought them things and\nso forth, and she -- very much loved in the family and she didn\u2019t want to abandon him, so she\ntook care of him until he died. And this was either a year and a half or two years later, so was\nmuch harder for her to get out. And she took the last -- she used to tell the story of going home to\nher apartment and boiling some potatoes and her girlfriend said to her, you know, if I had a\nhusband waiting for me in the United States, I wouldn\u2019t wait for the potatoes to boil. And she\ngrabbed her purse, and she said she walked out the door, and she got on the -- what turned out to\nbe the last train going to the border between Germany and Holland. And they had to get off the\ntrain, and she said, and the soldiers were directly behind them. And she said she w-w-walked\nvery quickly to where the railroad fencing was, and she said and then the Dutch people were\nthere, and they literally pulled her under the fence so the -- the soldiers couldn\u2019t get her. And she\nsaid then they were there with -- with hot coffee and -- and stuff, and helped people. And then\nshe got to Amsterdam and so forth, and saw my folks and saw me, I guess, when I was two and a\nhalf or something, and -- maybe a little older. And then she went to America, and then my uncle,\nwho was -- who was both a physicist and an electrical and mechanical engineer, had gone to -- to\nAmerica, wasn\u2019t allowed to take any money out, was apparently, so the story goes, in Grand\nCentral, and pulled a -- an old New York Times out of the wastebasket cause he didn\u2019t have any\nmoney, and saw that there were jobs for physicists and optical engineers and so on in Rochester,\nNew York. So then apparently wrote, and so forth and so on, was interviewed and got a job and -\n- and that\u2019s how he move o -- that\u2019s how he came to Rochester.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s your mother\u2019s brother?",
        "A: That\u2019s my mother\u2019s brother.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And he was -- I believe that he was the middle child, so -- and he was born in 1900, so that\nmakes -- I think my mother was four years older than he. So --",
        "Q: So your mother was -- was in her -- close to 50 when she passed.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So w-what did they -- they can\u2019t do a burial, I mean what did they do?",
        "A: Well, this is -- a-again, I -- a-a-actually it\u2019s the second time -- I'll have to tell you about the\nfirst time -- it\u2019s the second time that the -- that the adults -- and I don\u2019t know whether anybody in\nthe family knew him, but they took this person, this other Dutch person into their confidence and\ntold him what happened, and it was a doctor. And I don\u2019t know if it was the family doctor, or if it\nwas a doctor who was referred to them, or whether Tante Toos\u2019s brothers knew somebody who\nwould do this. In any case, this doctor came sometime in the evening or in the middle of the\nnight and took my mother\u2019s body out of the house and saw to it that she was buried. And in fact,\nat some point in time when I was back in Holland, I went to see him, he was still in practice at\nthe time, and I -- I wanted to express to him our thanks for not only doing that, but for not\nturning us in. And he -- he acknowledged my thanks, but he seemed very uncomfortable and\ndidn\u2019t -- seemed sort of aloof, and I don\u2019t know if he didn\u2019t want to remember this awful time, or\nwhether he in fact suffered because of it. I -- I -- I don\u2019t know what the reason was, but he was --\nhe -- he kept very much apart from -- you know, it was the very, sort of professional demeanor\nthat he showed. That was the second time, as I said. The first time we took somebody in our\nconfidence was as the war wore on, and the Germans were beginning to realize it -- that their lot\nwas going to likely be up, and they made their last ditch efforts. They were running short of\nsoldiers, so they took all the soldiers who were doing the domestic duties in these occupied\ncountries and put them in the front, 1-1-in the war front, and they replaced them by drafting the\nDutch boys. And now, our Hans is, of course, draft bait. So it became a matter of hiding him as\nwell. And so four of us couldn\u2019t get into this little -- under the display window thing. And so\nnow -- I don\u2019t know in my description if I made it clear, but we had, between the room where\nthis alcove bed was, and the kitchen, was a little teeny hallway, and there was a hallway on one\nside and on the other side was the half-bath. And over this hallway and half bath was a low\nceiling. But it f -- that low ceiling formed a kind of alcove in the kitchen area. And the kitchen\nceiling was very high and kind of extended over that alcove. So what they did is they brought\nsomebody in, a carpenter, who made a false wall for this whole upper alcove area. And he did it\nwith -- with wooden battens, so that it looked like it was part of a -- an existing wall. And one\nsquare with battens was left out, so that that provided the entrance, so we would get on a ladder\nat night and crawl in there, all of use including Hans, and we would leave this square off until\nsomebody gave us the high sign that we better put it on. But here there were -- there was no air\nintake at all, th -- if we put that thing there, w-we were totally without any -- never mind air\nflow, but -- but would have -- would have died of suffocation had we had to spend any long time\nthere. And -- and so we spent all the rest of our nights in the -- in the -- in the last parts -- years\nof the war, there.",
        "Q: And that included your mother for -- for a time.",
        "A: Initially, yeah.",
        "Q: Initially it did.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: Did you ever find the -- where they buried your mother?",
        "A: Yes, I went -- I went back to see the grave.",
        "Q: So there\u2019s a real place?",
        "A: There is a real grave.",
        "Q: And she\u2019s identified?",
        "A: Yes. Now, I don\u2019t know if my aunt and uncle took care of that part. I don\u2019t know if they had\nher reburied, I don\u2019t know if she was originally buried right there but not marked. I don\u2019t know. I\nknow that they gave money for her care, for the care of the grave in perpetuity because they did\ntell me that at some point.",
        "Q: Right. Di -- this is a question I don\u2019t think you can answer, cause I don\u2019t even know if there is\nan answer to the question, but when you\u2019re -- when -- do you have any idea when your mother\nreceived mail from your father when he was in Auschwitz? I\u2019m just wondering, and maybe you\ncan investigate it at some point, is there some connection between getting that letter, and her f --\nrealizing what Auschwitz was, which you wouldn\u2019t have known, but maybe she did. And --",
        "A: I can\u2019t believe that she didn\u2019t know what Auschwitz -- which -- what Auschwitz meant then.",
        "Q: Right, no, I\u2019m s -- I\u2019m assuming she did.",
        "A: She did, and I think what you\u2019re sort of implying is was this finally her real confrontation\nwith the meaning and what this meant for her husband, which is very possible, and -- and -- and\nthen the reason it may be possible 1s because the -- the -- when she died and -- and the adults, the\nremaining adults in the family said she died of a broken heart. Y-You may be onto something,\nthat that\u2019s in fact -- did create some kind of emotional stress, physical reaction, I-I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: But you could not, a-as a kid, have detected for a moment. And it could have been --",
        "A: I-I know that she was very, very distressed with the last -- I don\u2019t know if it was a letter or\nletters. But -- but it was very clear to me that there was a progression of news that got worse each\ntime.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t know if it was actually what was in the letter, or whether it was the postmarks on\nthe letter, because I don\u2019t think they let anything stay in the letter that was of any use.",
        "Q: Yeah, right.",
        "A: Or -- or any news. And the other thing that -- I -- I know that even papers, radio, whatever\nnotwithstanding, I know that there was a lot information that we got by word of mouth that was\nbeing -- for example the fact that after we went into hiding and the round-ups continued, we -- I\nknow that we got word of the fact that all my father\u2019s family was wiped out. He had five\nbrothers, each of whom had families and children and wives, and we got word of the fact that\nthey had all been deported, and everybody knew -- seemed to know what that meant. I didn\u2019t, but\nI knew that they knew. They got word of the fact that my grandmother, her husband had died\nbefore we went into hiding, and I remember my grandmother at our house, sitting Shiva in a\nblack -- black dress and -- and on a wooden bench and -- and so forth. So I knew what that meant\nlong before I knew any connection to Judaism or anything. But I knew that she was in mourning.\nAnd I spoke a little German for those early years, I must have been three years old at the time.\nBut then she was in a nursing home when we went into hiding. And the word came back to us\nthat -- th-that there had been a round-up of that nursing home, that the trucks had just pulled up\nin front, that they threw people out the doors and out the verandas like so many chickens going\nto slaughter. I know we heard that, cause I heard that then.",
        "Q: You heard it then?",
        "A: And so I -- In -- I-I don\u2019t think that there was -- that -- that\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard to listen to\npeople saying that they didn\u2019t know what was going on in that time. I th -- I think you -- you\ncouldn\u2019t help but know what was going on. And -- and some of the p -- some of the writers who\nhave written about these experiences also -- partly you knew what was going on because there\nwas -- there was the knowledge that happened in the east. You knew about the -- you know, they\n-- they pr -- they were first perhaps not extermination camps, but you knew that people were put\nto death. And th -- and this -- this came up in this film about Dachau for example, what people\nsaid, th-the residents said, well this was not -- this was not an extermination camp. Well the --\nsome of the first efforts of extermination were done in Dachau. And I -- I\u2019d -- I know there\nwasn\u2019t television and so forth, but th -- but people knew, people knew. And -- and America\nknew. America knew. And -- and again, in David Wyman\u2019s book, that\u2019s all documented line by\nline, what they knew. That just wasn\u2019t expedient to get involved. Just wasn\u2019t where they wanted\nto go at that time. But it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t -- I-I -- I don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t know what you do\nabout that, you know, I didn\u2019t -- I -- I mean here and now -- and this -- when you see these\nparallels of which is so horrible when you see the European nations apologizing to the Bosnians\nabout the fact that they didn\u2019t act when they should have to stop that bloodshed. W-W-Why\ndon\u2019t we do that? Why do we -- why don\u2019t we take action about values that are right and wrong\ninstead of well, you know, you have to play the political game, and I -- I think I used to be a\nwhole lot more optimistic than I am now, but I think when the whole Bosnian crisis broke, I just\n-- | -- ] felt as if the bottom had g-gone out from under my stomach, and I just kind of felt -- w-\nw-we just aren\u2019t going anywhere. I mean, how these families that could -- that intermarried,\nthese families that were neighbors and friends. You get the right manipulator out there doing the\nright PR stuff, and everybody loses everything that they supposedly claim is -- is what they\nbelieve. It\u2019s very hard. It\u2019s very hard to accept that. And -- and I think the -- I think when I first\ncame here, of course, people asked me all kinds of questions. I was still a little kid when I came,\nI mean when ha -- when the war ended, of course, there was such a sense of -- a-again, what did I\nas a child know? It\u2019s very difficult to know. I knew that we were being liberated. I knew that\nfreedom was once again back in Holland, and I knew what it meant for me. I knew that I could\nrun in the street, I knew I could open the door, I knew I could talk in a regular voice. I knew that\nI could find friends to play with on the street, and I did. There was a child across the street who -\n- whose father was also a baker, but an only child who was a year older than I, and we -- we\nneither of us knew about each other for -- for nearly three and a half years here. And -- and I\nwent to school, and she and I walked to school, and I had that life that had been on hold, that I\nhad been waiting for as a small child. And then about December, I got very sick. I had bronchitis,\nI had pneumonia, I had whooping cough. I had -- I\u2019ve forgotten, something else.",
        "Q: All together?",
        "A: All together at the same time. I was really very sick and they finally took me and put me in\nthe hospital. And I was on a ward, a huge room that was just filled with cribs, mostly infants and\ntoddlers, I was the oldest child by far on that floor, because most kids my age, I guess, wouldn\u2019t\nhave gotten whooping cough. And it\u2019s kind of funny because I don\u2019t know whether I missed\ngetting vaccinated or whether that\u2019s not a hundred percent foolproof. But I was so sick they\nweren't sure I was going to make it. And I certainly wasn\u2019t sure I was going to make it, although\nI don\u2019t know what that meant in my child\u2019s mind. But every night there would be children\ncarried -- dead children carried out of these cribs and I would see this around me all day long and\nall night long. I mean, that was a huge ward just -- just lined up crib after crib after crib. And you\nwould hear these babies convulsing and coughing, as I was also. And then not be able to breathe,\nand die. And I was in the hospital about three months, or at least I was sick for a very long time.\nAnd during this time there was some -- some effort made at -- at ca -- well, actually the effort\nmade to contact us ha-happened be -- prior to the time I got sick. But during -- but backtracking a\nlittle bit to the -- to the freedom thing, I remember the feeling of freedom. I remember being able\nto throw open the door and running down the street to this street we were trying to find, the\nHooftweg, which means basically, the headway. And running along with every citizen who could\nwalk or crawl, to line those streets to welcome the allied troops.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And you know, the joy, it -- it\u2019s -- on one of the pages of that newspaper e -- edition that I\ngave you, everybody who was anybody, as I say, who could get there, was there on the street.\nAnd the -- and the soldiers, mostly actually Canadian and British, not too many U.S., threw\ncandy in the crowds and stockings for the girls and the cheering went on and on and on, and I\ndon\u2019t know if I knew what I was doing and exactly what it meant to me at that time, except this\nincredible sense of freedom, just -- just physically feeling it.",
        "Q: Well sure, because physically, whatever you knew about the politics, or didn\u2019t know, was\nirrelevant in a way, because you were stuck. And now you weren\u2019t stuck any more.",
        "A: True, true, but that I could really feel that and participate in this -- it was incredible.",

        "Q: Hedy, when your mother dies, are you and Betsy afraid that Tante Toos will not keep you\nthere, or do you have no fear?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember fear as an emotion at all during this time, other than this constant anxiety\nkind of thing that something is going to happen and I don\u2019t know what that something is, which\nis why we have to be quiet and so forth, and that\u2019s why we can\u2019t be seen. I hadn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t --\ndon\u2019t think, at least I don\u2019t remember, personally thinking about what\u2019s going to happen to us\nnow. I didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know if I was just so young it didn\u2019t occur to me that this might be an\nissue. Whether my sister thought something else, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And there was certainly some change and shift in the dynamic now, because now Tante Toos\nfeels even more responsible for -- for us -- for both of us, and for me in particular, I think, and\nmy sister felt that she needed to rise to the occasion, because she was the -- the -- the next, the\nclosest relative.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And therefore she felt she needed to act in this mature, responsible way and -- and set the\nlimits for me and do all those kinds of things. And sometimes they clashed, and I was aware of\nthat. And I think this was very hard for both. I\u2019m sure it was difficult for this adult who had done\nall this for us and -- and so on, and -- and then therefore probably had occasional mixed feelings.\nAnd that was very hard for my sister, who must have had to walk a thin line between also being a\nchild, but also being the one that felt dutifully responsible for me, and -- and how to behave in a\nway that was not ungrateful, and yet try to put her perspective out there.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: A-And I -- and this must have been extremely difficult. I-I certainly was aware of it, but I\ndon\u2019t remember specifics.",
        "Q: Do you remember any -- anything that would be like a mourning period? I mean, do you\nremember your sister being depressed because your mother is gone, or do you remember a\nchange in the -- in the house because this happened? Or is it all a blur now?",
        "A: Is -- it\u2019s pretty much a blur. I don\u2019t remember -- as I say, the -- when you\u2019re asking me about\nmemory, I don\u2019t remember there being a mourning period. I don\u2019t remember there being a time\nthat was different from another time except my mother wasn\u2019t present. I-I don\u2019t remember any\nmarkers, or any things that I can hitch any kind of response to.",

        "A: Well, the things get worse in the sense that we now have, as they say, we\u2019ve gone through all\nof the food, all of our supplies, there is nothing H-Hans can\u2019t really go out in the country any\nmore, because th -- he runs the danger --",

But I\nsort of made up for it by being so very sick at that time.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And -- and my sister, who was trying to run around and -- and take care of the bureaucracy\nstuff while I was in the hospital, and getting passports, and papers signed, and so forth, broke out\ninto the -- first of all, she had terrible, terrible stomach problems right after the war, and I\u2019m sure\nthat they had to do with -- well, I\u2019m not sure, but I think they had to do with all this suppressed\nanxiety and fear, and trying to walk this delicate line between things. And she had -- I remember\nhaving terrible, she had terrible, terrible cramp attacks, and I remember being dispatched to go\ndown to the Hooftweg, to this [indecipherable] and -- and trying to find the open -- the only one\npharmacy that was still open, and get her Valerian, I remember Valerian drops. Valerian I guess\nis still occasionally used, but it\u2019s some kind of -- it has some sort of sedative reaction on the\nmuscles of the stomach and so on. And I remember when I got so sick and sh -- and I was in the\nhospital -- in fact, I had my 10\" birthday in the hospital, I remember this. And I remember this\nnew little friend I had made from across the street, I remember her not being allowed into the\nward, and there were some glass doors at one side at sort of roughly the same level where I was,\nexcept I was way into the center of the ward. And she was -- this is February now, she\u2019s looking\nat -- and her face pressed against the door, holding up a sign, happy birthday, and so forth,\ncoming to see me. But my sister had these terrible, what probably were staph infections, just\nthese running sores and one terrible one on her -- on the top of her foot and she couldn\u2019t get a\nshoe on, and she had to keep going and she had the shoemaker cut out some hunk of the shoe\nleather for her, so that she could continue to -- to go about her business and so on. Because by\nthis time in that -- immediately after the war, the first thing that --that we got right after the war,\nafter we had this incredible jubilation on the Hooftweg, was that everybody hauled out their\nclandestine radios and their record players and their hidden Dutch flags, and the orange\nstreamers for the House of Orange, and o -- suddenly this stuff came out of nowhere, and we had\nthree day block parties, essentially, the whole city that I remember, everywhere there were\nloudspeakers running, music, and there was dancing in the street and there was just unbridled\njoy. And the only people who were not unbridled in their joy were those -- especially the woman\nwho were known to have consorted with the Nazi soldiers. And they were rounded up and shorn\nin public and ended up having to wear scarves over their heads to hide their shame, and so on.\nThat was pretty awful.",
        "Q: Did you see that?",
        "A: Yeah, I did see it. I did see that. But there was this just -- this incredible, you know, there\u2019s --\nthere\u2019s n -- there are no words to describe this sense of freedom and this jubilation that took\nplace during this liberation time. And of course now we were seeing army uniforms and -- and --\nand the allied soldiers who were headquartered wherever they were, and -- and the soldiers were\n-- were walking the streets and my girlfriend and I had a little tiny pad each, because there was\nstill not stuff in the stores, they were still basically shuttered. And the two words of English --\nactually, I knew three by the time I came to this country, but the first two words I learned were\nsignature please. And it -- we invented this activity, we would go to a soldier and hand him this\npad an-and little stubby pencil and ask for his signature. And I still have those too, someplace.",
        "Q: You do?",
        "A: Little pad of signatures, even some X\u2019s where they didn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t obviously write. And\nagain, mostly British and Canadians. And I remember that the other one was candy and please.\nSo we would give them, we\u2019d ask for their signature and then we would ask for candy, please.\nBecause, of course, they had thrown the stuff from the --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- trucks as they came through, on the tanks and so on. And -- and there was this great loving,\nand -- and -- and rejoicing and -- and great love for the Americans and British and everyone. And\nthen w-we had -- we had these block parties, but we had them -- we -- I seem to remember that\nwe had three big ones in -- in fairly rapid succession, like with -- within two or three weeks there\nwas another one, and then there was another one. And what I think was happening is that th --\nthat they were celebrating different things happening as the war was really, completely ending.\nAnd -- and then I -- I started school, there was a -- a neighborhood school, and I went -- walked\nwith my girlfriend and she and I became great buddies and spent lots of time together. And after\nthe war she asked if I might -- would like to come on vacation with her and her parents, they\nwere going to a farm. And I was so excited, and I just loved going, and I was allowed to go, and\nit was a week. And I fell in love with the rooster\u2019s feathers, those sort of blue green feathers. And\nthe whole chicken yard was covered with these feathers, and I collected them. And I came back -\n- this was my great, you know, souvenir from this trip, which I just adored. I loved being on the\nfarm with the animals and everything, and I had this great bag of feathers which I took with me,\nwhich I also brought to America, which then got eaten by the moths somewheres along the way\nand had to get tossed.",
        "Q: They allowed you to bring these in?",
        "A: Yes, yes. How, I don\u2019t know, but they did. Well, Pll tell you how in a -- in -- in a minute, but\nthe -- that -- the happy days of this thing were then also made happier by the fact that we got air\nlifts from the Swedish Red Cross, we got air lifts of bread, and -- primarily bread, and then\npowdered milk were among the first things that came. And that was the first time that I tasted\nthis sort of soft, whitish bread. I don\u2019t know why they -- maybe it was because it kept well, so\nthat that\u2019s why they -- cause it really wasn\u2019t bread I was familiar with.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then we\u2019d began receiving parcels from both an -- my aunt, the other aunt, who was --\nhad meanwhile come to America, and my uncle and aunt. And they sent packages with clothing\nand food and peanut butter.",
        "Q: How did they know where you were?",
        "A: That I\u2019m not sure of, but I know that they contacted -- initially they contacted the American,\nwhat\u2019s now I guess called the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. I think then 1t was\ncalled the American Joint Distribution Committee. And they conti -- tacted them because that\norganization was in -- was somehow infiltrated with the troops, in fact they traveled -- their\nworkers traveled in American uniforms. And they apparently did a lot of -- of rounding up of\nrefugees in all the countries, and were the -- the -- the agency that you got in touch with if you\nwanted to know if your relatives were still alive, and they -- they located us, and found us, and\ngave -- and to serve as the intermediary and so forth. And then they helped to arrange for us to\ngo to America.",
        "Q: Did you want to go?",
        "A: No, no, I didn\u2019t want to go. I mean, if you can imagine how eager I had been before the war\nstarted, to go to school, to have a life and so forth and so on, and now I come through this period\nof intense confinement and containment and -- and life picks up again, and I can wave the flag\nand I can put the picture of Queen Wilhemina over my bed -- which I also brought to America\nand also had over my bed in Rochester, New York. And I could do the things that I had looked\nforward to doing, you know, and I loved school, and I did very we -- I did very well in\neverything in school except handwerken. And handwerken is embroidery and knitting and that\nkind of stuff, and I always either flunked it or was borderline. I could somehow never get my\nhands to do what they were supposed to do. And I remember -- I remember my teacher,\n[indecipherable] and I remember having school trips to the Rembrandt house and to the museum\nand seeing the night watch for the first time, and all these things were very exciting to me. And\nnow, all of a sudden we should stop again, and -- and go somewhere where -- all I knew about\nwere the Apaches, and that was sort of a saving grace, but I didn\u2019t -- I-I didn\u2019t know this aunt\nand uncle or if -- if they had seen me as a baby, I didn\u2019t remember them.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I was very happy with Tante Toos and living where I was, and I had this girlfriend and I\nplayed at her house and she had toys and I went on vacation with her family and I didn\u2019t want to\ngo at all. And I was finally sort of convinced of the fact that maybe it might be worth going\nbecause I was told that in America people were so wealthy that if you had a hole in your socks,\nthey just threw out the socks, whereas I had to learn how to darn socks, cause we hadn\u2019t had very\nmany socks and you just had to make it last, so --",
        "Q: And who told you this tale? Do you know? But wa --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: -- what was it like for Tante Toos, I mean here she was --",
        "A: Very hard.",
        "Q: -- taking you with her --",
        "A: Very hard.",
        "Q: -- for what? F -- three years?",
        "A: Three and a half years, three and a half years.",
        "Q: Three and a half years, and two years -- no -- almost two years, she\u2019s essentially your mother.",
        "A: Really for two years, cause I was still living there after the war, so --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: It was terrible, and I was aware that it was terrible. And she was very unhappy. I don\u2019t think\nsh -- to my knowledge, she didn\u2019t try to stop this, but I am pretty sure that she offered to foster\nus.",
        "Q: She did.",
        "A: To have us become part of her family. And I don\u2019t know with whom she\u2019d had any\ndeliberations about this, but I am pretty sure that that took place. And she was very unhappy\nabout the whole thing. I -- I don\u2019t know how my sister felt at that time, anyway. And -- and I\nthink it fell to my sister to try to sort of ease that difficulty and -- and so on. And I don\u2019t -- I think\nshe knew my aunt and uncle, but certainly not well, because they only passed through the -- you\nknow, they never spent any -- I think he -- be -- spent a week there, in Amsterdam on his way\nthrough, but --",
        "Q: But she wouldn\u2019t have known them.",

        "Q: Oh, your sister?",

        "A: And -- and it w -- I knew -- I was very well aware of the fact that sh -- that this was hard for\nher. I think at this point in time, I think certain things began to register on me.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And that was one of them.",
        "Q: And was it difficult for Hans, or you don\u2019t know?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, partly because for him also, liberation meant liberation, and he later on became\na photojournalist. I don\u2019t know exactly what were the goings on between him and my sister. I\nknow they were very close, and then there was a very close friend of his with whom the two of\nthem were very close, so it was kind of a tre -- a threesome. I -- I -- I think it was very hard on\nmy sister for a variety of reasons, not the least of which was leaving what now had become her --\nher -- maybe more than just a very close relationship.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And -- and that was very hard, and -- and then the -- the JDC, the Joint Distribution\nCommittee also funneled food and clothing and so forth. And then they sent a representative in\nuniform whose name was Mrs. Roosevelt, if you can believe it. And I f-fell in love with her, I\nthought she was just a lovely, lovely person, you know. Rich, dark hair and -- and this wonderful\nAmerican uniform. I mean, this American uniform was -- I-I -- I don\u2019t know how to say how\nhard it was for me during the anti-Vietnam times, when I took a strong anti- Vietnam stand. And I\nwas a girl scout leader at the time, and we were invited to march in the Memorial Day parade,\nand I had such a difficult time. And I actually sat the -- the kids down and explained to them that\nthey had been invited, and this is what Memorial Day was all about, and so forth and so on, and\nthat I myself owed something to the American soldiers, but at -- at this particular time, this also\nmeant something that I did not want to share, that I didn\u2019t believe in, and that I felt was wrong.\nAnd I wanted them to have two things out of that. One was, not a disrespect for Memorial Day,\nin fact, understanding that I owed my life to these men, and that I recognized that, and that I was\nvery torn up about this dilemma. And I also wanted them to understand that if you believe that\nthese values are important, then you have to do what this means for you, but you don\u2019t impose it\non someone else. So I made it clear to the 10 to 13 year old kids there that if it was important to\nshow your respect, and you did not have a reason not to do that, that they should go ahead and do\nthat. That just because I wasn\u2019t marching, I wasn\u2019t telling them that they shouldn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I think it was a lesson that went home to a number of them. But it was very upsetting to\nme. It was very upsetting to me, and I\u2019ve often thought of Memorial Day times during these\ndifficult times, and now here we are back again in a situation that is just so horrible to me, so\nhorrible to me, and I don\u2019t know what to say because every day you see not only all these\nAmericans -- all these young Americans and old Americans being killed, and thousands of Iraqis\nbeing killed, and each of these, like me, has a family, has a mother, a father, has children, some\nof them, brothers and sisters, and we just wipe them out, like so many ants, you know? And the\nfarther away we can do our destruction, it seems, the easier it is. We don\u2019t have to look these\npeople in the eye, we can just drop a bomb. And -- and I just can\u2019t over that. I just cannot get\nover that.",
        "Q: So what was it like to see this M-Ms. Rosa - Roosevelt? I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s in --",
        "A: Yeah, I think she was probably Miss, I\u2019m not sure, but in any case, it was wonderful, I mean,\nit made an almost -- and she was that kind of person anyway, but it made an instant connection\nfor us, and for me.",
        "Q: And the uniform mattered?",
        "A: And the uniform mattered. And apparently this is -- this uniform travel for these refugee\nworkers was done on purpose so that they would have more freedom of movement and so on. So\nshe gathered us up and made arrangements for us to go by train to Paris, and --",
        "Q: Do you remember leaving Tante Toos?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was that awful? That particular moment?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember it being awful, but I do remember the hugging and the kissing the tears and\nthe goodbyes.",
        "Q: There was crying, yes.",
        "A: And then I remember us going to Paris on the train, and I was very excited to be on a train,\nand -- and she -- ar -- I don\u2019t know where this all came from, and how wonderful it was that it\nhappened, but we were in Paris for a few days and she took us around Paris --",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And she took us to the amusement park outside of Paris, or wherever it was, and -- and it was\nwonderful. And I\u2019m sure especially wonderful to my sister, who had studied French and studied\nabout France and on -- so forth. And then she took us on the train from Paris to Marseille, and in\nMarseille we were put under the aegis of a French orphan group, whose name I can\u2019t quite\nremember, but was initials, OCS or something like that, I don\u2019t remember what it was. And they\nput all the children -- I mean, we were the only two, as far as I know, who didn\u2019t belong to that\nFrench group, but there were hundreds of -- hundreds of children of all ages, and they put them\nall in the hold of this ship on these layers of canvas and gave every child a dirty blanket and said\nthat you\u2019re a number so and so on the thing. And I didn\u2019t speak French, but every other child did,\nand my sister did and so on. And all I remember is seeing this big opening on -- big s -- huge\nsquare opening and seeing the sky from the hold of this ship, which had been originally a Greek\ntroop sh -- a Greek freighter, which had been ta -- taken over and converted into a troop ship, and\nwas now converted into a passenger liner. So the passengers, the other passengers were really all\nadults, and the kids were all in the hold. A-And I don\u2019t know if there was any other cargo. And\nwe go across the waters of the Atlantic and sail, and the -- part -- partway into this trip I get sick\nagain, and I get this pneumonia and the bronchitis and the stuff all over again.",
        "Q: So it comes back?",
        "A: Some sort of resmi -- respiratory stuff comes back, bronchitis, which I had fairly often after\nthat. And my sister, in the best of efforts, took me to the ship\u2019s dispensary, which had a Greek\ndoctor, who was kind of -- I -- I don\u2019t know where his training was from, but what they did to me\nthere was cupping. And I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever heard of or read about cupping, but cupping\nis taking something the equivalent of maybe a shot glass -- no, a little bigger, whatever, cocktail\nglass or something, and you create a vacuum in the glass by lighting a match into it, and you use\nup the air and the oxygen, and before you have a chance to fill that back in again, you press it\ndown on the back. And they put rows and rows of these glasses on my back. And then, of course,\nbecause there\u2019s a -- a vacuum in the glass, the glass pulls the skin and everything with the skin\ninto the glass. And then you yank these glasses off. So this provides -- what I decided the -- the\nreason for this was, to make you focus on some other pain, of such intensity that you forgot\nabout what you really came for. But it probably came from the medieval notion that if you get\nthe blood moving, that you could get the ill humors out, or something. And I was in huge pain,\nterrible pain, and I sat on a -- some -- some chair or other, some corner of the deck, swathed in\nblankets and the tears streaming down my face, for days. And the sa -- the -- the sailors kind of\ntook pity on me, and they would bring me an occasional piece of fruit or so -- the food on this\nboat was all spoiled. The only thing that was edible was some of the fruit. I -- I didn\u2019t eat\nanything except the fruit that they brought. And meanwhile I wasn\u2019t getting any better, so I had\nto report back to the dispensary and they would do it again and again. And I cried so bitterly and\npleaded with them to stop doing it, that they finally stopped doing it, but then they did something\nsomewhat similar which is -- which is, if you can imagine plaster that is like an emery board on\nthe other side, is like sandpaper. And they put this plaster on you with the sandpaper side\ntowards the skin, and then they rip it off in rapid succession. So you have again, a similar thing\ngoing on, but it\u2019s just horrendously painful. At least it wasn\u2019t as bad as the cupping. So partway\nacross the ocean, one of the engines dies, and then I became sort of aware of the fact there were\nall these adults on the boat, because then there was a lot of chaos, and a lot of crying, and a lot of\npeople who were certain we were never going to make it, and I saw how upset these people were.\nAnd I don\u2019t think it registered on me what it meant that one of the motors died and you couldn\u2019t\ndo anything. Well, we did make it over that ocean and we did get to New York, and when we\narrived in New York there was a dock strike. So now we\u2019re on this boat, twirling around in the\nharbor day after day after day with this dock strike going on, and --",
        "Q: Are you any better?",
        "A: N -- I must have been because I didn\u2019t -- don\u2019t remember any more of these treatments, and I\nremember coming into the harbor and I remember seeing the -- that big neon sign, that horse\nwith -- the winged red horse, I don\u2019t know if 1t was Texaco or Mobil or s --",
        "Q: Texaco, I think.",
        "A: Texaco?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I remember a huge, lit-up sign for Lorna Doone cookies, and all the city all lit up and\nthese skyscrapers looming up the air and so on. Anyway, finally, apparently the health\ndepartment stepped in and decided that this was a very bad situation, have all these children in\nthe hold of the ship. So they took just the children off on -- on one of these sightseeing water\nboats, or several decker boat things. And ki -- when we came into Ellis Island and unloaded, and\nmy aunt and uncle had both come to New York, but my uncle had had to go back, because of the\ndock strike, he couldn\u2019t take off from work so long. So we came into this enormous processing\nhall of some sort or other, and walked in there, and I remember my sister had her arm around me,\nand she was carrying whatever little baggage we had. And as we came in at either side of the --\nthis enormous doorway, were women standing with a stack of presents, and each child was given\nthis beautifully wrapped box. Now, what\u2019s in this box? A set of three handkerchiefs, and some\nwhite handkerchiefs for the -- for the boys. Well, not everybody -- ther--there wasn\u2019t the sort of\nuniversal prevalence of Kleenex, I mean yes they were on the market, but not the way they are\nnow, and women -- proper women carried handkerchiefs. And although these were not elegantly\nembroidered, they were -- they were beautifully stamped with pretty flowers and so forth and so\non. And I thought how wonderful that I\u2019m coming to this new country, and they don\u2019t even know\nme, and they\u2019re here to say welcome with a gift? This made an indelible impression on me, that\nthey would think enough to -- to -- to welcome me to the country. I don\u2019t know who the agency\nwas, I don\u2019t know who inspired that idea because it was both useful as well as a kind of a luxury.",

And I -- and how do you ever thank someone for having done\nwhat she did?

But you know,\nfirst of all, this is coming along after the fact, and -- and sh-she is now gone, although I was able\nto go back to Holland and meet with her and introduce her to my husband and --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- two small children. And I -- I -- oh, I had such trepidations about this meeting, but it went\njust flawlessly, even though she doesn\u2019t speak a -- didn\u2019t speak a word of English. But she\u2019s now\ngone also, and whatever honors and so forth, and so on -- which is not what she did this for in the\nfirst place, but -- but how do you rev -- repay someone for that kind of gift, for that kind of\nsacrifice? It\u2019s impossible. I c -- I couldn't even begin to brainstorm ideas about anything. And the\nolder I get, the more I understand it, and the more I admire here. She was not a complicated\nwoman, she was not well educated. She, as I say, worked for my father in the bakery as a\nsalesgirl, and they must have somehow kept in touch because even when she was -- m-my sister\ndid indicate that there was -- that they had kept in touch and so forth. I don\u2019t know if there was\nany socializing back and forth. But that\u2019s -- y-you know, I -- I -- why did she do this, did she do\nit because there was money to be had? I\u2019m sure that wasn\u2019t an issue. Did she do it -- there may\nhave well passed money, but I\u2019m sure this was not the reason. Did she do it for religious reasons?\nI don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t remember them being very religious -- I mean, I remember -- I remember\nthe neighbors after the war, I remember that the neighbors who ran the embroidery store next\ndoor were two -- two ladies who seemed -- who then seemed elderly to me, they probably\nweren\u2019t, and -- and they were very religious, and they asked if I would like to go to Catholic\nmass with them the following whatever, whatever, and -- and I was a child who really kept away\nfrom religion. Now why? It\u2019s not so easy to say. People make an easy assumption that it\u2019s\nbecause of my -- my experiences. I\u2019m not sure. Somehow these experiences are in a separate\ncategory. Whereas I was never a child who had great notions of -- of God and -- and so forth, I\nhad -- religion made me uncomfortable, and I just wasn\u2019t very keen on it. But -- but I don\u2019t think\nthat that was the motivating factor w-w-wh-why would she respond so differently than the other\nsiblings with whom she was raised? So I think some of that had to do, perhaps, with the personal\nrelationship that she had with my father. He had been very good to her, I understand, and maybe\n-- m-maybe that\u2019s sort of what I always preach about, which is that when -- when people get to\nknow each other, when people rub elbows together, when you see that -- that, you know, this\nperson is not some stereotypic, stigmatized non -- untouchable kind of person -- I-I don\u2019t know,\nm-maybe she had a crush on my father when she was young. I -- I -- I have no idea why she did\nit. Did she do it as wi -- what you said earlier, that she perhaps wasn\u2019t wild about Jews, but this is\na Jew she knew personally and she felt that she -- that he didn\u2019t deserve, and his family didn\u2019t\ndeserve this. I -- I don\u2019t know, and Ill never know. She never, to my knowledge, talked about,\neither then or later.",
        "Q: And you never -- you didn\u2019t say, why did you do this? Maybe she doesn\u2019t even know.",
        "A: That wa -- might well be the case. And I -- I -- whether it was a spontaneous action on her\npart, I think it might well have been, but she stayed with it, and she, you know, could easily have\nsort of changed her mind along the way, anywhere along the way, and -- and didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then when her own son was in danger as well, I mean, it was th-the -- the dangers just\nintensified.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It -- 1t was -- 1t was tough, and --",
        "Q: What the -- when liberation came, and people realized that you and Betsy -- I don\u2019t know\nwhat they thought about your mother, whether they even had any idea that your mother had been\nthere -- were there and you weren\u2019t related to Tante Toos, did they say, who are these people,\nwhere -- where\u2019d they come from, were there questions? Do you know?",
        "A: That would seem logical, but -- but I-I- think on the whole -- I\u2019m sort of generalizing, but it\ncertainly was true at that time; at that time, certainly, Europeans tended to be much more private\nand keep much more to themselves. So even if they felt this, I don\u2019t think they -- that they would\ngo to her and say this. And there was little, if any, social interaction between the neighbors and\nthis family. And I think that that was fairly typical, I don\u2019t think that people -- the other thing is\nthat social life and friendships, at least at that time, and to some degree still, were among people\nwho were much closer. There wasn\u2019t -- there isn\u2019t this level of sort of almost superficial\nfriendship and socializing that you have in -- in America. In fact, one of the things I always try to\n-- to talk to foreign students about when they come to America to study is the fact that people\nwill say, how are you, but they don\u2019t really want to know how you are. That\u2019s -- it\u2019s a greeting,\nit\u2019s not an -- an inquiry. And -- and some of our students did wonderful little take-offs on this,\nyou know. How -- how am I? Well, my knee hurts, and I wasn\u2019t able to get the laundry done\nyesterday, and so forth and so on, Meanwhile the other student\u2019s out the door. At this -- in -- in\nthe same way, they sometimes end up very disappointed because they say -- the students will\nsay, well, call me up some time, or we\u2019ll get together, but nobody ever follows it up with a\ndistinct invitation. And those are the same kinds of cultural differences even more so, that\noperated there. People kept to themselves, they had their little yards, they had the fences. If they\nobserved things, they didn\u2019t socialize about those things. So if some of that took place, I don\u2019t\nknow about it.",
        "Q: So w -- you weren't identified as Jewish after the war, and that was not an issue --",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m sure I was.",

        "A: I\u2019m sure I was.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I mean, I was called Hedy in Dutch. I-I was called Hady by my family, Hady, or Hedy being\nthe short form of Hedwig, but I didn\u2019t have to be Hedy Vermeulen --",

        "A: -- which was the equivalent of Jane Doe, or John Smith. I could -- I could be Hedy Cohen.",
        "Q: What happened to your original house, do you know?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s a good question. Initially, it apparently was used by the Nazis as a some kind of --\nI don\u2019t know if it was an office or headquarters or something, or -- or officer\u2019s quarters. I --\nactually when I was back in Holland at one time, tried to find out what happened to this house.\nIt\u2019s not clear to me that we actually owned it, it\u2019s possible that we rented it and I don\u2019t know that.\nBut I tried to get hold of the -- of the documents that would indicate what the story was, and\nthere is basically a large, blank space.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And at some point or other, the city of Amsterdam took it over, and for a brief period of time\nthey had orphans living there after the war. And then I think it was sold to a private party, and --\nwhich may well have been the one that I stopped to ask if I could see the place.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So you never got anything back from your -- your old things as a kid, right?",
        "A: Nothing from the house, nothing from all the stuff that we closed the door on.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Paintings, and rugs, and -- and beautiful furniture and so forth. Nothing, nothing. Holland as a\n-- acountry did finally make some blanket payment of a couple thousand dollars to everyone\nwho was caught up in this war, with the understanding that you then didn\u2019t try to sue them, or get\nanything back. But there was no quid pro quo for specifics.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Wh-Whether you had a house or not have a house. But it was very difficult to find out\nanything. And again, it was because of the expos\u00e9 of some journalist that it came to light that the\nnumber of Dutch banks apparently had in their v-vaults and safe deposit box, all kinds of jewelry\nand antiques and silver, and so forth and so on, that had been deposited there by Jews, which\nthey claimed they didn\u2019t have. And apparently the -- these banks had hidden this stuff in the\nattics of some houses on the canals and so forth, in Amsterdam. And some bright-eyed journalist\nexposed this whole mess, which is how this payment came about, how this sort of blanket\npayment was made. But you know -- I mean, f-for some people it\u2019s too late, it\u2019s -- a payment was\ntoo late for my aunt. She died in \u201997, and I was in Vienna, and I learned when I was in Vienna\nthat Austria, at some brief moment in time was shamed into making some kind of compensation,\nand that they -- it was so shamefully small, apparently, that there was a big -- I don\u2019t remember\nthis, but a big hullabaloo about it. And they stopped this small payment, and then they started\nagain, made it a little bit bigger. But they kept the time period within which you could apply for\nthat so narrow, and that the announcing of this worldwide so closed, that nobody knew about it. I\nmean, here my aunt reads and talks German, and so forth, reads the papers. Her brother was --\ncame back from Russia to live in Vienna, they didn\u2019t know about it. I talked to my -- my aunt\u2019s\nsister-in-law, who is now in a home for the aged in Vienna, and I asked her if she knew anything\nabout this and she said no. She doesn\u2019t know anything about this. And when I went to f -- inquire\nabout this and so forth, they in -- practically didn\u2019t say anything, but immediately said to me, it\u2019s\nnot for heirs, it\u2019s only for that person. Well -- or -- or persons. So they made it very clear that\nthey weren't about to do anything. But the N\u201c degree of this is how do you repay anybody? How\ndo you put a figure on what happened?",
        "Q: You don\u2019t.",
        "A: But there are many, many people, and I feel myself a very fortunate exception, but there are\nmany, many people living in poverty, living with very little means, elderly, who should have\nthat, and nobody should be asking them to have to go Vienna to rattle the cage there, and say --\nyou know, this is just so terrible. Or -- or what happened with the Swiss banks? My family\napparently put some money in Swiss banks, which we have not been able to get out. We have not\nbeen able to locate it, we have not been able to provide them adequate proof of the fact that this\nwas done. What am I supposed to do, get my parents back from the grave? It -- it\u2019s just very\nhard. And -- and the Swiss in their, you know, great neutrality, have profited enormously from\nthis neutrality, financially.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And every other way.",
        "Q: After you got the hankies on Ellis Island, did you have to stay in Ellis Island for a day or two,\nor would -- were you immediately able to see your aunt?",
        "A: N-No, we were immediately through the -- we processed through, and my aunt was waiting\nfor us in -- behind some whatever, whatever. And she used to tell me how she will never, ever --\nw-would never get out of her memory, out of her visual mind\u2019s eye, the -- this 18 year old with\nher hand around her little sister -- her arm around her little sister, carrying this little satchel in\nthese clothes that didn\u2019t exactly fit and so forth and so on. And by then I had pigtails again, and -\n- and 1-1 -- th-there is this school picture of me which shows how I -- I looked at the time. And\nmy farewell present from my dear friend across the street was this big, big ribbon, and the proper\npin to put those big ribbons in on top of your head, because that was the fashion of the kids at\nthat time, and I didn\u2019t have those. And she gave me one of hers, and it was a farewell present.\nAnd so I wore that for my first day of school in Rochester, but it was not appreciated by my\npeers, and so I quickly put it in a drawer.",
        "Q: Di -- had -- had your aunt and uncle sent you pictures of them so you could recognize them,\nor you didn\u2019t know what even they looked like? And she is the married wife of your mother\u2019s\nbrother.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: Right. So it isn\u2019t even the blood relative that you see at that moment.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: But she knew what you folks looked like? She had seen pictures?",
        "A: Oh yes, she had seen us as little -- little -- and as -- as a lot younger",

        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: But she recognized you, or so --",
        "A: Apparently.",
        "Q: Somehow.",
        "A: Apparently. I think probably my sister didn\u2019t change that much. I suspect I did, quite a lot.",
        "Q: Was that okay to see -- what was that like, seeing her?",
        "A: It was sort of -- I\u2019m not sure you can assign any -- any -- sort of anything to that, because I-I -\n- I guess for me it was, well this was the person who was my aunt. I mean, it was sort of like\nputting it out there, and saying, well this is -- because I didn\u2019t remember her coming through, I\nhad no idea what she looked like. And I guess I say I was -- wasn\u2019t thrill -- actually, my sister\nmay have sent them the passport pictures that we had taken.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And my passport ticsh -- picture was taken in the hospital when I was recovering, and I\u2019m\nsitting on one of these Victorian settees type things --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- that was out in the -- the lawn area or something, and there is this little tiny face, with little,\nskinny pigtails, which is swathed in this enormous Navy surplus, U.S. Navy surplus sweater.\nAnd right here in the middle is U.S. on the sweater, and this 1s the picture of me on my passport.\nAnd she may well have sent --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- copies of these picture to them. Never thought about it, but she may have done that.",
        "Q: Did they have kids? So you became their children.",
        "A: Absolutely. So imagine suddenly having an 18 and a 10 year old -- or almost 11 year old.\nThey -- I\u2019m sure they were full of trepidation --",
        "Q: I bet they were.",
        "A: -- \u2019'm sure they were. And I -- I -- well, you know, I just marvel at them when I think about it,\nand I think about the -- the difference in needs for an 18 years old and a 10 year old or an 11 year\nold, and -- and I remember coming into -- into New York and -- and going to -- to the hotel,\nwhere I had this incredible bath, which I hadn\u2019t had since God knows when. And I remember in\nwhatever hotel we were, at the Hotel York or Hotel New York, or whatever, and my aunt is\nscrubbing my hair back, or whatever, whatever, and the -- on the other side of the window are\nsome working men, who are either working on another building or washing windows or\nwhatever, starting to whistle at the scene in this -- and there was no comment from her that I can\nremember, but I remember thinking something a little strange. And -- and then I remember she\nhad one or two good friends who lived in New York who had also immigrated earlier, before\nthings all shut down. And the next day they came to meet us, one of them came, then the other\ncouple came, and so I quickly got to know these were their friends. And we went to have\nbreakfast at one of these automats, and I thought this was just wonderful, this thing where you\ncould keep moving stuff around --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and find -- and choose what you wanted, and I was very excited about that, and I remember\nbeing struck by the amount of food that was thrown out. Watching what people left on their\ntrays, and it got tossed. Right from day one when I arrived, that made an indelible impression.\nAnd then I remember liking very much we -- in the display counter where -- where you paid the\nbill or whatever -- it was either there or at some other restaurant. Once place had a v -- a soft sort\nof stuffed toy that was a -- a kitty, and it was sort of almost real fur, maybe it was, and I fell in\nlove with it, and one of my aunts friends bought that for me. And then in the other place I liked\nvery much, it was a little red shoulder bag for -- for a young child, and I loved it, and the other\none bought that for me. So immediately I was -- I ha -- I had these two very meaningful gifts,\nwhich I still have someplace. And then I remember being just so overwhelmed and excited about\nthe fact that there were these fruit stands on the streets, and bananas, which I loved bananas and I\nhad not had them since before the war. And oranges. And oranges used to be very special, and --\nfrom Spain, and here were just this -- just enormous supply, and I still to this day will walk into\nthese incredible supermarkets we have here, where you have these enormous amounts of\neverything, as much as you want. It -- 1f you only have the money to buy it, you can have it from\nall over the world. I -- it still blows my mind when I see it, and I -- 1t goes back to these carts on\nthe street corner having all these things that I had not had. And I wanted bananas, bananas and\nbananas, and my aunt said, you\u2019re going to burst if you keep on eating like this.",
        "Q: So you went from New York to Rochester.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Were they fairly comfortable financially?",
        "A: Well, I th -- they lived very carefully, they lived very carefully and I -- and in retrospect when\nI think about it, I think they st -- they started literally with nothing, and they had very few things\nthat they were able to bring, and very little money and they lived first in a apartment. Then I later\non saw pictures of them buying, you know, their furniture bit by bit and so forth and so on. And\nmy aunt took in some sewing, did work for some other seamster -- a --a person who had a\nclothing -- very fine clothing store in Rochester, and she would do hems and shorten things for\nthem, I mean, it was sort of menial stuff for someone who had done designer --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- apparel and so on. In fact, I -- I learned to do hems, and I used to get 35 cents a hem if I\nhelped her out, and -- to do that. And we immediately were sort of integrated into the household,\nand we each were given chores and responsibility in the house. And my sister and I always did\nthe dishes after dinner. And we took turns doing bathroom cleaning and each of us had to learn\nto cook certain things and once a week I had to bake something for everyone. So there was a\nkind of sense of pulling together, and -- and stuff. But I remember immediately that it was a very\nwarm and supportive environment. There was a lot of laughter, there was the -- and I had\npictures -- I-I remember I used to love to sit on my uncle\u2019s knees, and he would sing little\nrhymes of -- of being a rider on a horse kind of thing. And then I would -- I saw pictures of me\nwith a sprinkler in the backyard, and I think that they were -- they didn\u2019t have much money, and\neverything was budgeted. But they were -- they could take care of themselves, and they could put\nfood on the table, and -- good food, and -- there weren\u2019t luxuries. They didn\u2019t have a car, they\ndidn\u2019t have a television, they didn\u2019t have a radio, they didn\u2019t -- or a big radio, or a record player.\nIn fact, I remember when each of these things came into our lives, what a big occasion that was,\nand how special that was.",
        "Q: Wow. Did your uncle remind you of your mother in some way\u2019?",
        "A: Don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: If it was, it was at a level that I wasn\u2019t aware of.",
        "Q: Aware of. Did they ask you about what happened in -- in -- in the situation you were in. I\ndon\u2019t mean just about your mother, but --",
        "A: My guess is that more of that was done with my sister, if 1t was done at all. Maybe they felt\nthey should let us -- I-I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t remember being -- I do remember very\nmuch responding in a very negative way when their friends or other adults, or anybody for that\nmatter, tended to ask me. Because I always had the sense that they were looking at me like\nsomething ri -- strange, some -- somebody that they couldn't relate to when I would start to tell\nthings, so I'd stop telling them things. I just didn\u2019t -- I -- I would sort of politely -- literally work\nmy way out of the situation. And -- and it was years like that, that I didn\u2019t talk about the war.\nYears, years.",
        "Q: Is that because people responded as if you were some strange creature, or what --",
        "A: That\u2019s at least what I remember feeling, and sort of -- I began to feel like I don\u2019t want to be\nthis odd creature that they\u2019re going to be staring at for the next hour while we tal -- while they\nask me more questions. So I didn\u2019t want to do this. And -- and that was one feeling, and the other\nfeeling that I\u2019m sure played into that, was that I wanted to get on with my life, I wanted to be like\neverybody else, and don\u2019t forget, this was not in the days of cultural diversity, multicultural\neducation, or anything remotely resembling that. You were going to be an American as fast as\npossible. You were going to lose your accents, and your strange ways, and you were going to\nconform to what was the way of the world in this country. And being at an age now getting ready\nto move into adolescent, that was sort of partly what I wanted to do, too. I wanted to be accepted,\nI didn\u2019t want to be looked at as odd, I -- I -- it was hard enough to be the little girl from Holland,\nI was one of maybe six Jewish kids in an entire elementary school of 600. And it was not a\nJewish neighborhood, I did not want to explain why I didn\u2019t have blonde hair and blue eyes and\nwhy I didn\u2019t have wooden shoes. I didn\u2019t -- I wanted to desperately learn to hit a ball, for -- so\nthat when we went out for recess and played baseball, I wasn\u2019t always the last kid left there alone\nbecause nobody wanted me on their team. So that to me was a great day when I, you know, hit\nthat ball, and after that, boy, they vied for me on the teams.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But it was -- 1t was hard, I was different on so many levels. So I just wanted, I guess, to -- to I-\nlose my accent, and learn to speak English, and participate in American life. I -- I mean, now I\nwas here, it wasn\u2019t sort of like, well, do you want to go home again. I didn\u2019t want -- I mean, ad --\nnot that I had any choice in the matter, and I knew that, but I was now wanting to -- and I -- I -- I\ncan only say I was made to feel -- I-I have no negative recollections of coming to my aunt and\nuncle\u2019s home.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t.",
        "A: I think it was much harder for my sister on the other hand, because here she had been an\nadult, she had acted as an adult, she had been responsible as an adult, she had taken care of us --\na young child. And now suddenly she was again a -- an older child in the home, and my folks\nhad a lot of -- they -- they tried very hard, they -- they went to the high school guidance people,\nand they asked what should they do, after all my sister had this terrific education from the\ngymnasium, and should she apply to college and so on. And basically they recommended that\nmaybe she take her senior year, so that she\u2019d have and -- a more even grounding from which to\nmove into the college. And she did that, but it was hard, you know, the kids were not geared to\ntaking in somebody like her, and --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- she was so much more serious, and --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- I mean, sh -- what she went through, they couldn\u2019t even fathom.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So yeah, her way was much more difficult, much.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I mean, in spite of the fact that I didn\u2019t speak a word of English, and she did, because she had\nstudied it. But it was heavily accented, and she was clearly older and more mature, and clearly a\nvery good student, which doesn\u2019t always endear you to other high school peers.",
        "Q: No, mm-mm.",
        "A: It was tough.",
        "Q: And what language did you speak with your aunt and uncle?",
        "A: German.",
        "Q: German\u2019?",
        "A: German. They didn\u2019t speak Dutch.",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: I didn\u2019t think so, yeah.",
        "A: So my sister and I spoke Dutch with each other, German with them --",
        "Q: German with them.",
        "A: -- and English in school --",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: -- and on the outside.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: They did. Was that soon after you came, or later --",
        "A: N-No, officially it actually came much later.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But I -- I think that this may have been out of a certain respect of understanding that we\nneeded to kind of grow and develop our relationship and -- and so forth, that I-I -- maybe they\nfelt this was not a -- a good thing emotionally to do. I-I don\u2019t know exactly why.",
        "Q: But they seem like very sensitive people.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. They were, and -- and they also were very old world people in the sense\nthat they had trouble sort of understanding high school life as it existed here. And so I think that\ncreated a lot of problems for my sister. And also what I pointed out earlier is that she was so\nmuch older, and had had so much freedoms, and now suddenly --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- you know, you have to be in by x hour and -- and whatever. And -- and there was some\ntension even later when she went through college at the University of Rochester and she would\nbring home, or some boy would come calling for her, and he happened to be German. And they\napparently gave her the business about that. I don\u2019t re-remember too much about it except she\nwas pretty unhappy about it. They basically sort of said to her, how can you -- how can you\nconsider going with this boy when, you know, you\u2019ve lost your entire family. And -- I mean that\n-- that whole issue is a very tough one anyway.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: But I think at that time, it just was -- it -- I think it was extremely difficult -- it was extremely\ndifficult for her.",
        "Q: And less so for you.",
        "A: And less so for me. And again, par-partly the age, and partly the type of person. I mean, if\nthey were critical of her, and my -- my uncle was -- tended to be super-critical, he was a very\ndemanding father figure, a -- he was very bright, he couldn\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t\nunderstand your math. And when I would bring a report card home and it would have all\nexcellents and one satisfactory, he would say, what happened here? Why didn\u2019t you get -- you\nknow, it wa-was never isn\u2019t this a wonderful report card, but rather --",
        "Q: What\u2019s wrong.",
        "A: What\u2019s the pe -- he would always see the piece that was lacking. By the same token they both\nwere very strongly committed to the importance of education, and that was not something you\ntook lightly. And long decades afterwards, I understood from the story that he lived, that they\nlived, how important that was. They would have been in the poorhouse otherwise, if he hadn\u2019t\nbeen able to --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: An-And they always impressed on us the importance of education is something -- part of it is\nthe fact that it\u2019s not something anyone can take away from you.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And I -- it was long after, when I was doing my doctoral dissertation and I finally got to the\npoint where I was writing the -- the dedication, that I acknowledged that early teaching, because\nit hadn\u2019t actually registered on me, but I realized I had sort of come slowly to a point where I\nunderstood that they were in part responsible for my continuing to -- to go there, go that route.",
        "Q: Were they religious?",
        "A: N -- I wouldn\u2019t say they were -- I think my aunt was less religious than my uncle. I think that\nthey believed in the importance of maintaining certain traditions. They believed in the\nimportance of supporting the Jewish people as a people. They became founding members of the\nsynagogue in Westport, actually, and helped to -- to -- to set that up. They insisted that I go to\nSunday school, and I guess when I was an absolute, miserable person -- child, when I was little,\nand -- and given to tantrums, I guess that\u2019s the biggest one I ever threw, was when they said I\nhad to go to Sunday school. I instinctively didn\u2019t want Sunday school, I instinctively didn\u2019t want\npart of that, I instinctively rejected any notion of religiosity and religious stuff and all the rest of\nit, and I probably also rejected any other entrapment for being different again. I don\u2019t know how\ncognizant I was of that, but I think intuitively I was.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re not a religious person at all, do you think? I -- I don\u2019t mean in a traditional way,\neven in some metaphysical way, believing that there is a higher power of some kind.",
        "A: I\u2019m not an agnostic -- I mean, I\u2019m not an atheist, but I\u2019m probably an agnostic, if -- if you\nhave to pigeonhole me at all. But I --",
        "Q: I don\u2019t want to if I don\u2019t have to.",
        "A: I mean in -- in one sense, I have felt that the things that have been done in the name of\nreligion are so reprehensible throughout history, with no religion left outside of that blanket\nindictment, that I think it has not done good, it has done bad. And I -- it\u2019s only continuing that\nway.",
        "Q: And when you went to Sunday school, was it terrible for you?",
        "A: Well, it wasn\u2019t terrible, it was sort of ineffectual as far as I was concerned, it was, you know, I\ncouldn\u2019t sleep late on Sunday and I had to go there, and blah, blah, blah, and I hated it, and I\nwent. And I got -- I made some friends, and most of the Jewish kids didn\u2019t live in our\nneighborhood, so any friendships I made were difficult to follow up on because they were in\nother parts of Rochester. And they themselves were members of the Conservative Temple in -- in\nRochester, but they felt okay with me going to the Reformed synagogue, which was interesting.\nBut when it came to the high holidays, they walked, and they celebrated them, and they wanted\nme to do likewise, and I was supposed to go to services with them, and walk to Temple, and not\nbeing a great lover of walking from the days I went through the alley at the -- at the wax\nmuseum, I always sort of resented that, and I thought that the whole idea was crazy and foolish\nand you know, it just seemed to me sort of -- and then of course I was out of school on those\ndays, and I didn\u2019t like that, and I had to go back and explain why wasn\u2019t I in school. And those\nwere not the days when you were given to be excused because it was religious absence and stuff,\nso that was always a pain. On the other hand, by the time I got to about the eighth grade, I had a\nvery good teacher, and we had some real history, and the history of the Jewish people. And I\nended up actually valuing that because I did learn something here, and because I always found\nmyself in the position of being the only Jewish kid in a large gathering of non-Jews. And so I\nwas always the spokesperson, a not particularly willing] -- willingly, but people put me there. So\nI would have to answer questions about what do Jews believe and -- and why did they kill Christ,\nand all these kinds of things. And it made me rather unhappy, but I felt better having had the\nclass, so that I could in fact answer some questions. And so actually I stayed on, and stayed in\nthe Confirmation year, which was yet another year, and then I learn even more about what Jews\nbelieve and why they do what they do. And then I was Confirmed and I went on and stayed in --\nI-I was -- I sang in the choir in the synagogue and then I stayed on and did two more years of\nwhat was called post-Confirmation class. And we did comparative religion, and we did study of\nthe Torah and so forth, wi-with Rabbi Philip Bernstein who\u2019d been a -- a chapel -- chaplain at --\nduring the second war. And I think that there was a lot that I began to appreciate about what then\nbecame something more meaningful.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And as my life continued, it was always in this vein of being, for example, out of 1800 in the\nhigh school, there were probably 10 or fewer Jewish kids at that particular high school. S -- and\nthen I was -- I was very active in the girl scouts, and I was selected to represent New York state\nat a national encampment, and I was back in the same pool of, you know, well tell us about Jews.\nNow they didn\u2019t ask me stuff about the war yet, and -- and -- or -- well, some people did, but I\nsort of kept that still pretty much closed. But I did appreciate that, and I -- but I had such a\ncommitment to trying to improve the whole Sunday school experience for children that I\nvolunteered to teach Sunday school. I -- I had this presumptuous sense that I could do it better\nthan these other people.",
        "Q: Were you right?",
        "A: And I think I did.",
        "Q: Yes. You did?",
        "A: Yeah, well was a little bit -- little bit difficult. I mean, on the first year I was teaching, a -- one\nof the little kids of -- first or -- kindergarten, first grade or something, came up to me and said,\n\u201cYou know, Mrs. Cohen, I saw God on television last night.\u201d And the -- things like that were a\nlittle difficult to cope with, but there was definitely a sense on my part that I felt a -- a --a--a\nreason to be a teacher, to -- to teach kids something, and to not disperse or dispel any notions of\nGod, or the existence of God, which I would never do, but to bring in what is important about\nreligions, and beliefs and values. Wh-What -- what is there that\u2019s really worth fighting for here?\nAnd I think that that really was the sort of connecting thread to most of what I did all my life.\nGoing into education with a strong belief in -- in the value of education for teaching, and for\nopening up horizons and for having people learn to live with each other and so forth. I was a -- a\none world candidate, and in high school I was, you know, preaching -- or not preaching, but I\nwas s-supporting those kinds of organizations. I remember some very narrow-minded high\nschool teachers with whom I challenged their viewpoints and so forth. I was never afraid to stand\nup or to speak out, and as turns out, neither are my kids. But I didn\u2019t need to be pigeonholed, and\nI didn\u2019t want to be pigeonholed, and -- a-and it was -- it was -- it was a very much longer time\nbefore I began talking about the war, and as I said earlier, I -- I never thought of myself as a\nsurvivor. I thought only those people who had survived the camps, the people -- th-th-the -- the\ndisplaced persons, the people who had the numbers carved on their arms. I didn\u2019t have that, and I\nwas alive, and I was -- I was with a family, and I guess I was hidden, but -- so -- and -- and I\nremember the first time, the very first time that I saw any movie that related to anything having\nto do with the war. I-It was -- it -- it packed an enormous emotional wallop, and it was, \u201cThe\nPawnbroker.\u201d And I don\u2019t know if you remember the film.",
        "Q: I do, yeah.",
        "A: But this -- and this whole struggle of this poor man, who himself had been a displaced person,\nand you get that message as you see his arm and so forth. And he suspects this young, black guy\nof stealing from him. And then the struggle within himself about not wanting to stereotype and\nnot wanting to make assumptions because this kid\u2019s black. And then his head running over with\nthe re -- memories of the camps, and -- and then having this interspersed with the actual\nnewsreels of that period of the -- of the camps. I went home, I was wiped out. I had se -- Peter\nhad told me some months before, I don\u2019t think you want to see that, but I went to see it anyway.\nAnd by then I had one or two kids and we were at Smith, and I had a babysitter and wanted to go\nto the movies on the campus. And I came back and this babysitter opened the door, and she\ndidn\u2019t see the fact that I was really still speechless. And she sort of bubbled over and said, \u201cOh\nhi, Mrs. Rose, how\u2019d you enjoy the movie?\u201d And I was just stunned by her use of the word\nenjoy, and I -- she didn\u2019t see my face, didn\u2019t notice anything, and I said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think\nenjoy is the word you want to use with that film.\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, y-you know, my\nroommate and I kind of th-thought about going to see it, but then we figured it was so much\nHollywood make-believe.\u201d And this is in the early 60\u2019s and that\u2019s when I had one my early, sort\nof comeuppances about the fact that I have to speak, I can\u2019t remain silent if people are thinking\nthat.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And another time the same thing happened with when I was driving between Syracuse and\nRochester, or wherever, or Ithaca, and I was listening to a -- it mus -- must have been around\nPassover time, and I was looking for some station on the dial and twisting the dial and I heard\nthis rabbi speaking, and I -- something either made me stop -- maybe I put my hand on the\nwheel, and the rabbi said something like, someday we\u2019re going to have the story of the Holocaust\nbetween the covers of a little book, and we will have a holiday to commemorate that it happened,\nand everyone re -- will read what it says in the book and they\u2019ll say, this couldn\u2019t possibly have\nhappened. And all of a sudden I made the connection between the Hagadah and the story of the\nplagues and the exodus of -- from Egypt, and my own reaction at the table at home where I\nthought, oh this could never have happened. I\u2019m thinking, oh my God. Y-You know, he\u2019s\nabsolutely right. And this was long before we had the holiday and long before we set aside this\ntime, and -- and so forth, and I thought -- and that -- these two incidents, I think, sort of propelled\nme to get over my reluctance to speak, and when this girl -- this babysitter said to me -- she\u2019s\nfinally re-registered something of my face --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and she said, would I be willing to come and speak to them in the dorm? And I said of\ncourse, and that was sort of the beginning of tt.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And then I was asked in classes and assemblies and so on. So then many years followed of\nthat. But --",
        "Q: And was this before you got your degree?",
        "A: Before I got my doctorate, yes --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. It started before then.",
        "Q: And you married Peter when you were a sophomore in college?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So you were a young person.",
        "A: A very young bride.",
        "Q: Young person.",
        "A: A very young bride. Yeah, I met him in between my junior and senior year 1n high school.",
        "Q: And was he in high school also, or was he a little bit older?",
        "A: No, he was between junior and senior year in college, so --",
        "Q: Ah, wow.",
        "A: -- he was all bi -- already about fed up with college and all its stuff --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and then -- then here was this -- his girlfriend, and here I -- I was very active in school, and\nI had a lot of responsibilities and commitments and had a wonderful -- wonderful principal and\nso on. Then I -- I gave up some of those things once we started going together, but it was hard\nfor him to get into this scene --",
        "Q: Yes, I would imagine, right.",
        "A: -- the high school scene, after the college scene.",
        "Q: Did he find out very quickly about your war years, or did it take you a few years to be able to\ntell him as well?",
        "A: I think it was more gradual with him. I think things came out piecemeal over time and\ndiscussion and as we grew to know each other more, and so forth. And it was a -- after all, it was\nthree years before we were married, but yeah, it -- it -- well, it did not all come at once.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And -- and it was not -- and it was not a public thing, either, it was very much more private.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. So it doesn\u2019t become public for you until the 60\u2019s, until these --",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] first time.",
        "A: It does not become public.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Right. And --",
        "Q: Do you now consider yourself a survivor?",
        "A: I do now, and I also realize that more and more of us are gone. And that er -- that the -- the\nlittlest bit that I can do to bear testimony to this event is probably the only thing I can do to\njustify that I am among the living, and so many are among the dead. And if I\u2019m not willing to do\nthat, then I\u2019m really doing a grave disservice, both to humankind and to those who died, because\nno one was there to speak for them if it\u2019s not coming from us. And the -- the dilemma about not\nonly studying this whole human element to -- to realize -- well, I made mention for example of\nthe -- of \u201cThe Eye of the Storm,\u201d or the -- the, \u201cBlue Eyes, Brown Eyes,\u201d and all of those. Yes,\nwe can isolate those particular behaviors and we can call them by names and we can study them.\nStanley Milgrim, a social psychologist at Yale did these studies that are probably more telling\nabout what happened and why people and how people were able to do these terrible things. If\nyou know the -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m sure you do, but he -- he basically put somebody in a white coat in a\nlab with a one way mirror, and he brought people in off the street, and said we\u2019re running this\nexperiment. We\u2019re going to see how much pain these -- how much shock these subjects are\nwilling to endure. And below the one way mirror was a group of actors in a studio. And there\nwas a fake set of dials and people turned up the electricity. Up and up and up. And it didn\u2019t\nmatter that the actors were writhing on the floor and screaming and calling and saying stop, stop.\nIt apparently did not affect most of the people, not every single one. And now you couldn\u2019t do\nthat kind of experiment any more because of the upset to the people who -- who came to\nrecognize what they were capable of doing. But if we\u2019re capable of doing that, and we keep\ndoing it, and we keep doing it, and we keep turning our backs to what\u2019s going on 1n areas where\nother people are doing it, we\u2019re not advancing at all.",
        "Q: So what good 1s it to talk about, do you think?",
        "A: Well, I think that if there are enough people who hear it, and if there are enough people who\nare struck by the fact that this kind of behavior can lead to this kind of event, the Holocaust, that\nmaybe it behooves them to do something before we get there. Maybe. I -- I think th -- I only -- I\nhave to continue to believe that, because otherwise I can\u2019t continue to go on. And this is also\nback to what I said earlier about the fact you never know what you\u2019re able to sustain, you never\nknow what you are able to do, or what you\u2019d be willing to do in a situation where your life\ndepends on it, or the lifes of your loved ones. But the bottom line is that we should perhaps not\nbe so adaptable. We should not be able to do what these Jews did for so long, throughout history,\nwhich 1s to adjust to the behavior that was imposed on them, and the restrictions imposed on\nthem, and the tortures imposed on them. What can you do? You can\u2019t stand up and fight. I know\nthat they -- they were helpless, they had no weapons, they had no allies, they had nothing. So the\nquestion about why didn\u2019t they stand up and fight becomes a -- a moot question, really. But\nwhen you find yourself in a situation where we really must stop, I don\u2019t know why we, as a\nnation, aren\u2019t in the streets, and I consider myself equally guilty, because I don\u2019t know what to\ndo. But why are not in the street demanding that we stop killing? How far have we come if we\ncan\u2019t sit around the table and try to work things out. Why can\u2019t we -- I took training in\nmediation. Much of my work has been in -- in law in education, and first amendment rights. And\nthose liberties and freedoms that we have fought for in this country, since time immemorial as\nfar as the history of this country, why are we suddenly making different rules for different\npeople? I -- I don\u2019t know how to adjust to that, it -- 1t -- it\u2019s -- I think when people used to ask\nme, you know, do you wa -- well, how do you feel about this country and so forth, and I always\nhad felt this 1s the country where people can talk, where people can argue, where you can have a\ndialog, where we have an open press. And yet things keep coming out, and keep coming out and\nkeep coming out. In the papers every day, in the -- the general news. I don\u2019t have access to any\nprivate news any more than anybody else. But finally it\u2019s getting to people in the streets that this\npresident lied to us, and for whatever personal reasons went to war, killing not only Americans,\nbut also Iraqis, or Afghanis, and the -- and the justification for af -- Afghanistan, I think, is\ncertainly greater than Iraq. But there were no weapons of mass destruction. Why do we support a\nworld organization? Why do we say other countries have to adhere to the decisions of the world\norganization, but we\u2019re outside the law. This doesn\u2019t make any sense. That doesn\u2019t move us\nforward. It doesn\u2019t put us in the situation of -- of making unacceptable certain ways of warfare\nand torture and behavior. We -- we ti -- we say Amnesty International is wrong. They come in --\nthe Red Cross is bamboozled, just as they were by the Nazis. The Nazis came into the camps,\ninto some of those camps, and there is data that I have just seen this spring, actually, at Hoover,\nindicating what the men were told, what the soldiers were told, in order to dress up the camp so\nthat the Red Cross could come in and be impressed. How they had casual music groups, how\nthey had caf\u00e9s set up, they shipped half of the camp population off to another camp because they\n-- the -- otherwise the Red Cross would say you have too many people per square bed, or\nwhatever. Well, such as you might call it. It\u2019s unbelievable what these people did. And here, first\nperson accounts that I am now finding in the original languages about what the Nazis did in\norder to bamboozle the Red Cross. But we are in similar situations, uncomfortably similar\nsituations. And I can\u2019t live with this, I am finding this nightmarish. My daughter and I talk on the\nphone and we\u2019re either in tears, or we\u2019re so upset every phone call that I finally said to her,\nwe've got to put this off limits, we can\u2019t do this. Ic -- I can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t do this. But I am -- Iam\njust as bad as everybody else. I haven\u2019t done anything except signing petitions and trying to get\npeople to listen and read. But I haven\u2019t gone off in the street and demonstrated. I ha -- I don\u2019t\nknow what to do. And of course this -- this public relations campaign about making every\ndifference of opinion seem like an unpatriotic act has a very familiar ring to me. I heard this\nbefore. And there -- here we are celebrating 60 years til the end of the war. Where are we now?\nThat was the war to end all wars. So it tastes very bad.",
        "Q: The taste for you after the war, is a very bad one.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s only bad because as I say, this -- this was -- this was our hope for the future. We\nwere not going to as a world, let this kind of thing happen again.",
        "Q: But that\u2019s not true.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t see it as true, and I s-see such -- so many similar means. Yes, not all. You know,\nthere -- there aren\u2019t extermination camps, but we\u2019re doing many of the things 1n very similar\nways, that have to me a ring of danger. And I never thought that I would feel this way in this\ncountry, because -- and this is why I\u2019m such a strong believer in an absolutely free and\nindependent press. Because the press is the -- is the -- the only guide we have through darkness.\nAnd we depend on the press to lead us there so that we can ask the question and say to the\nadministration, how can you explain this? How can you explain that? And as long as there is\nlight on the subject, then you can stop it. But if you force people underground, you don\u2019t know\nwhat in God\u2019s name they\u2019re doing underground. You don\u2019t know what the Ku Klux Klan is\ndoing, what the neo-Nazis are doing, what the terrorists are doing if you force them underground.\nAnd if you -- if you contain the press and -- and sever its freedom, and -- or make it shut up and\nmake it become an arm of the government PR, then you can no longer trust the press to do that\nfor you.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure if you were particularly interested in this last, but this is why I\u2019m feeling so -- I --\nI don\u2019t know what to do with my feelings about this. And -- and yet my commitment all through\nmy professional life has been to support Constitutional liberties, the Bill of Rights, to teach my\nstudents, both elementary teachers and high school students, the importance of listening and\nrespecting the opinions of the children in their classes, whether they abide by them or not. But\nthat the essence of a free society 1s to listen and respect.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And you stop your respect at a certain point of course, if that other side is preaching your\ndeath, or somebody else\u2019s death, then you say, that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t have any compunction about\nsaying at a certain point that you have to restrain that freedom if that person or group 1s\npreaching that doctrine that certain people should be killed. But ne-nearly up to that point, I\u2019m\nsaying you -- this -- this is the only guide we have to remain a -- a country with the ideals that\npresumably we have led the world in and -- and have tried to teach others. I mean, what good 1s\nit to talk about democracy and then go in and behave the way we\u2019re doing and besides which\nthere\u2019s another piece of this teaching democracy, which right now I don\u2019t think this\nadministration has -- has reckoned with, and that is that if you really preach democracy, you may\nend up getting an election someplace with people that you don\u2019t really want. But if you believe\nin democracy, if that\u2019s what those people want, that\u2019s -- you have to respect that.",
        "Q: Right.",

I -- I think all the ti -- and -- and also actually all the years that I was getting older\nand so forth, I kept thinking about what it must have been like for my mother -- when I was 45 or\nsomething. You know, I would think, oh my God, my mother was such and such and age, and\nthis is what was happening, and what would I do, and so forth. And I was also -- and I think I\nhad very strong, not only values, but ideas, and also at the same time, I think, wanted very much\nfor my children to have as normal -- whatever that really means, but as normal a childhood as\npossible. And so I -- I know I\u2019m veering off your question a little bit, but I felt on the one hand\nthat they needed to learn what I could express about this from a learning point of view. So we did\nvery little by way of Jewish tradition in the home, partly because I didn\u2019t like the pulling apart of\nsome members of the Jewish community and I didn\u2019t like the sort of exclusiveness that one\nparticular rabbi had -- had communicated. So we didn\u2019t really want our kids exposed to that, so\nours was by contrast a much more inclusive home, and there was -- it wa -- it\u2019s really interesting\nbecause I-Leas, my daughter has often said, you know, this community, or that community, or\nthis group of people is -- is really the example of the kind of values that you and Dad taught us.\nAnd so clearly there was a -- a -- a very clear understanding of what those values were. And so\nwe neither the kids likes this exclusiveness that some communities will -- will -- will send out,\nwill radiate. And at the same time, I didn\u2019t want them to have the burden that so many children\nof survivors seem to carry. And I got to know about that, because as I was speaking around, so\nmany of the people came to me and said, oh now I understand what my parents didn\u2019t want to\ntell me, or now I understand why it\u2019s so difficult to talk about the second World War, or\nwhatever, whatever, whatever. And likewise in Europe, where I\u2019ve spoken in a number of places,\nincluding Austria, to high school teachers, who said, we cannot speak to our parents, they will\nnot answer questions, they will not tell us where they were, and so on, or what they did. And at\nthe same time I see that this presents a special kind of burden, and I didn\u2019t want to have our kids\nhave that. Now this commitment to normalcy, is that sort of -- that\u2019s probably not that unusual, I\nimagine any parent wants only the happiest and the best f-for their kids, and it\u2019s not always the\nhappy situations that build character, necessarily, but at the same time I made sure that the kids\nhad a sense of -- of inclusiveness, of one world ideas about respect for other people. So much so\nthat the kids were actually quite -- took on an activist role in school on behalf of other kids. Not\nJewish kids, necessarily, but I -- you know, speaking up on behalf of someone that the teacher\nwas picking on. The teacher probably didn\u2019t even know he was doing it, and so on. And then\nalso, I think, reflecting on the present role of Israel, vis-a-vis the Palestinians, taking classes in\nIsraeli-Arab dispute. Trying to be informed and to not be afraid to express an opinion in\nopposition to the Israeli government. Sometimes putting themselves at -- on the outs with other\nJews, perhaps. But I felt that that was terribly, terribly important. Now the same goes for putting\nyourself out for some of these people. And so far, I have not been able to do that in a personal\nsense -- back to your original question, other than in the monetary sense. And w-we have as a\nfamily, and as -- and my husband and I personally, have made big commitments to IRC, the\nInternational Rescue Committee, which seems in a major way to be helping refugees without any\nrespect to what their country or their nationa -- their nationality or their religion 1s, but going to\nthose places in the world where people are desperate, where people are suffering because of\nwhat\u2019s going on, whether it\u2019s internal or external strife, and so on. So we have done as much as\nwe could, maybe not as much as we can do, but still hope to be able to continue to do, in those\nterms, which -- which are important. And my husband, especially, I think in a professional way,\nhas brought the plight of the refugees to students, involved students in the work that\u2019s necessary\nto save these people around the world. To do even small things, like volunteer to teach English\nas a second language in the local church or school, wherever the classes are being held. To -- one\nof -- one of -- wo -- actually she wasn\u2019t a student of mine at Hampshire, but a -- a na -- a student,\nwho became a student of Peter\u2019s, and worked in the refugee camps and extended herself to the\npoint of taking a small inheritance that she had from her grandmother, and bringing three\nCambodian women back, who had been raped and tortured and so forth. And adopting them,\nbringing them back, getting them settled, getting them set up. Yeah, we\u2019re not saving the world,\nbut we are trying, and -- and I think sometimes when I have this great urgent sense of why am I\nsitting here in a classroom, I think, well, somebody has to sit in the classroom and try to keep\npart of the mission going that -- that we have got to change, and how do we do that. And that not\neverybody can run in the field, and do the medical stuff, or do the actual whatever. And\nsomehow I\u2019ve often felt that in my small way, given the values that I think I\u2019ve been able to\ncommunicate, even at the level of simply teaching teachers to have respect for the child, which\nsounds as if it should be nothing anyone would argue about. But if you watch clearly, you see\nthat not every adult, and not every person who\u2019s teaching, has that respect for that child. Even if\nthey are church-going and religion loving, and anti-abortion and so forth. Respect for that other\nlife, and the fact that that life has a will and some sense and justification for some freedom is not\nthere a -- often, in spite of the espousal of these other, so-called values. So I feel sometimes that\nmaybe this is a rationalization, but it is something I do believe I could do, and I could do it quite\nwell. And so I felt that to throw in the towel was not the right thing for me to do, at least at tho --\nin those years of my life. I would like very much to be out in the field now, and -- and now 1s\nprobably not a good time, having since had cancer and so forth. And I have to say that when I\nwas first diagnosed with the cancer, a friend of mine said, oh Hedy, you\u2019re a survivor, you\u2019re\ngoing to make it. And I have to say, although I understood perfectly where she was coming from,\nI quietly said to myself, why do I have to keep proving it all the time? But I -- I feel now\nsomewhat medically compromised about going out in the field, but it is something that I thought\nabout. I thought seriously about joining the Peace Corps after my kids were grown. And -- and I\nstill remember the horrible, horrible feeling I had during the Kosovo time, and when there was\ntalk about the draft and my son was draft age, and I thought to myself -- and I didn\u2019t say it out\nloud, but I just was devastated with the thought that I lost the family behind me, and now I was\ngoing to lose the family in front of me. It was something I could barely confront myself. And\nnow I\u2019m looking at my grandson. And if this continues, he will be draft age. Jordy and Robert\nare the two sons of my son. And I-I just -- I can\u2019t face that. I just can\u2019t face that. I just can\u2019t face\nthat.",

        "Q: So don\u2019t throw in the towel, cause the towel is made up of many different things, there\u2019s not\none towel. And I just want to thank you very much. It\u2019s been a long wait, 10 years, but it\u2019s been\nmore than worth it. And I thank you very much for spending the time with us.",
        "A: You\u2019re welcome.",
        "Q: Hedy, what is this picture here?",
        "A: Well that is my very proud, as you can see, school picture, of that one year that I spent in\nelementary school after the war. And I\u2019m growing my hair again, and so I\u2019ve got the beginnings\nof some skinny pigtails, and I\u2019m wearing a dress that came over in a package mailed from m-my\naunt and uncle from the States, in the classroom, at a desk. And behind me is probably a map of\nthe world, and on my head is one of those great big ribbons --",
        "Q: Oh yeah.",
        "A: -- that I was describing to you, with a special pin that allowed it to -- you didn\u2019t actually tie\nthe ribbon around the hair, you just created the bow effect, and then put this very special pin\naround it, you see, and then you clipped it to your hair. So that was my -- my -- my dressing up\nfor this -- this school picture.",
        "Q: Huh.",
        "A: And -- and tha -- it was a happy time, and you can see there was --",
        "Q: I can see it. Okay. Then --",
        "A: And that picture is one of the first probably informal snapshots of my husband-to-be and\nmyself, when I was working as a counselor in th -- in the camp that his parents owned at the\ntime, and which we then ran later on, and -- and directed for many years. At the time I think he\nwas a Senior -- going into his senior year in high school and I was going -- no, I\u2019m sorry, he was\nthe senior in college, and I was a senior in high school. Or it could have been the following\nsummer, which would have had us -- would have had him in graduate school, beginning graduate\nschool, and have me beginning college. I don\u2019t remember which of the two summers that might\nhave been, but we were together -- now almost 50 years. I mean, 50 years we\u2019ve been together,\nbut next year is our 50\" anniv -- wedding anniversary. And that is a picture -- and I don\u2019t know\nwho took these, by the way, either of these two, but they -- we were given copies of the\nsnapshots and the lower one was in my husband\u2019s wallet for many, many years, and my daughter\nnow has put in a special request for a copy. The one above is probably the same year or well,\nprobably not actually, cause I see that I had long hair, sort of pigtail like in the bottom picture, so\nit was probably still that first summer. The upper one my hair is short, and I\u2019m thinking this is\nprobably around 1960, and we now have been married a couple of years. I\u2019m running the camp\nalong with Peter, and I think I have one child at that time. Tho -- this is just a casual snapshot,\nsitting on the lawn at the camp in one of those Adirondack chairs. And that picture is struggling\nwith the bags, it looks like to me. I think we were coming from an extended stay in Italy at the\nBellagio Study Center, hence all those bags, because we usually don\u2019t have that many bags.",
        "Q: It says Norway.",
        "A: I think that\u2019s not correct --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- but we were also in Norway for some period of time. Peter was teaching the American\nstudies program up in Norway, and that would have been sort of 90 s -- 1971, but I don\u2019t think\nthis is from Norway, I think this was coming from Bellagio 1n -- in Italy.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And it was hot and humid, and I was -- it\u2019s one of many, many, many travels that we\u2019ve done\ntogether, and also that we\u2019ve done with the kids, both of whom have an enormous appreciation\nof o-other people and other lands, and other ways of living and behaving and so on.",
        "Q: And how -- wh-what year do you think this is?",
        "A: I think this is more like early 80\u2019s, but I -- I could be wrong, it could b -- it could be late 70\u2019s.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: The reason I think it\u2019s early 80\u2019s is because I think my daughter had already graduated and\nwas living in Italy at this time, but I\u2019m not positive. But I do think that was mislabeled. And I\nhope it wasn\u2019t in a book, therefore. But yeah, no, thi -- I\u2019m sorry about the passport picture,\nbecause had I been able to -- to bring that, I would have loved to have had you see that. And it\u2019s\nnot enormously different from this happy face here in the school picture. This picture by the way,\nis also at the Springfield Holocaust Museum. But -- but it is a wan little, skinny little face --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and the smile is not quite as full. And there is this little tiny face, as I say, Just swathed in\nthis enormous U.S. Navy surplus sweater, and -- I mean, there was th -- there was nothing in\nAmsterdam when the war ended, you know, th-there was nothing for those stores, there was no\nclothing, there was -- I don\u2019t even know how the hospitals operated. And here, clearly there are\nth-the U.S. armed services had come to the hospital\u2019s aid because I got the sweater in the\nhospital.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right, right.",
        "A: So I must have been given the sweater -- and not for keeps, but because I was allowed\noutside, and -- and Holland is generally --",
        "Q: Chilly.",
        "A: -- chilly.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And of course, having just been so sick, they weren\u2019t a-about to take chances, but I was\nallowed to get in the air, and I was so weak that I was on this -- this settee thing. And I don\u2019t\neven know who it was who came to the hospital to take that passport picture.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But -- but they did, and I -- I\u2019m so happy that I have that picture, because again, that -- that\nmeant to me this enormous sense of gratefulness to this U.S. surplus stuff, this wonderful, warm,\nwooly sweater that I could have. And it was cold during the war, we had no heat, and I -- all\nthose memories were very close to that time that passport picture was taken.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And -- and this picture as well. I don\u2019t know what the book is that I have opened on the desk,\nbut it\u2019s -- it\u2019s kind of fun to look at myself with that expression on my face, and it sort of like\nall\u2019s well with the world again, you know, it\u2019s sort of like, now here I am where I\u2019ve been\nwanting to be all this time.",
        "Q: You\u2019ve got a sparkle in your eyes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, they do sparkle.",
        "A: Yeah. And that\u2019s -- and that -- the -- and the picture that -- a-again, I don\u2019t have it, but I have\na picture of my sister and me together at this time as well, and there is not a sparkle in her eye,\nbut there is a kind of gentle being at peace kind of thing. It 1s not a distressing face, but it\u2019s not a\nsparkle, necessarily. But there is a sense of -- I -- I -- I -- to me again, there\u2019s a sense of some --\nsomething having come to rest in a way, in her probably more than me, looking forward to the --\nto going to the United States.",

There was another dynamic going on between my sister and\nthe young boy, after a fairly short time.

It may also have been\nthe fashion at the time to give people more than -- although that\u2019s not really true because my\nuncle who was born in Vienna, only had one name. So maybe it had to do with Sephardic as\nopposed to Ashkenazic Jews. Maybe it had to do with Holland versus Austria. Maybe it had to\ndo with whatever the background of my father\u2019s parents was, which I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know\nwhat their occupation was or anything.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: He was.",
        "A: He actually was a baker, but a baker in American parlance has sort of -- sort of a vague\nmeaning, but the kind of baker he was, was one of these European bakers who did all these\nspecialty desserts. And he -- I only recently learned from my sister, my older sister, that he was a\nbaker on the Holland-America line. And apparently before he was married, he -- that\u2019s what he\ndid. And at some point, I don\u2019t exactly know where in -- in the yearly chronology, he decided he\nwasn\u2019t going to do this any more. And they prevailed on him to do it once more, and do it once\nmore, and I guess he did it, he did -- went one more trip and they said we want you to take one\nmore trip, and I -- I guess he put his foot down and said, I\u2019m not doing it any more. And the --\nthat voyage, that ship that he said no to apparently was detonated by some torpedo that was left\nover from World War I. So that whatever it was, fate, whatever, saved him when he decided no,\nhe wasn\u2019t going to do this any more. But that\u2019s what he did. And he had a bakery in Amsterdam,\nbut I was never there, and we had already moved from there when I was born.",
        "A: I think he still owned the bakery, but he didn\u2019t work at it. And I -- I know that he left the\nhouse every day, but I\u2019m not really sure where he went.",
        "A: And the only baking that I was familiar with was what he did on Sunday mornings. It was\ntraditional that he baked a pound cake. And so the house was always filled with this wonderful\nsmell of baked goods, and his pound cake was incomparable.",
        "A: I have spent my life trying to find one like it, but it 1s impossible, 1t seems.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Well actually, the more prevalent and early memory is probably one of -- of him playing\ngames with me. Being left at the dinner or breakfast table with my father is an early memory,\nbecause I didn\u2019t eat. And they used to say I lived off the air. I just was not a child who ate a lot,\nand I -- or at all, and so he was the one elected to amuse me and tell me stories. And he would\npull out the contents of his pockets and make up stories, and then occasionally try to slide a\nspoonful of something or other in my mouth. And that -- that\u2019s sort of my earliest recollection, it\n-- it\u2019s one of the very early ones.",
        "A: I very much remember it before also.",
        "A: It was sort of our special time of day together, and he would come home from -- as I say from\nwherever, I don\u2019t know from where. And -- and then he and I would go for a walk just the two of\nus, and we would walk in the neighborhood, around the block or whatever, and it -- it was both\nbefore the occupation and for a short time after.",
        "A: If he walked with my sister I don\u2019t know about it, but he may have been one of these\nwonderful parents who knew how to make each child feel very special and -- and he probably\ndid something with her, or maybe a walk or something else with her. I-I don\u2019t know, I actually\nnever asked her. But there was always this little bit of time for us, and it was generally -- I don\u2019t\nremember if it was after or before supper, but it was either very late in the afternoon, or early\nevening.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think he asked me what my day was like. My sort of recollection, and as I say here,\nI\u2019m not really sure this is a recollection or whether I imagined this, that we talked at a child\u2019s\nlevel about something very present. There wasn\u2019t stuff about what did you do, or what are you\ngoing to do, but more -- more about do you hear that bird singing, or s-something rooted in the\npresent that a -- a -- rooted in the experience we were having together at that time.",
        "A: I -- if I say this is unusual, it comes from a -- a long backwards and adult perspective and\ncertainly not a child\u2019s memory because I had no idea what another father might have been like.\nBut I would say yes. I would say for several reasons. Number one, he was an extremely gentle\nand patient man, which is the reason he took -- took all the stuff out of his pocket forever and\never and ever, and in fact one of those things sort of backfired, because I knew that among the\ntreasures he had in his pocket was a small pair of scissors. And one time he and I were sitting in\nthe living room of our house, and we had very heavy oak, dark, dark oak furniture, sort of dark,\ndark -- you know that heavy European furniture. And over the big, big table in the middle of this\nliving room -- w-why this living room had this great big table sort of like -- more like a dining\nroom table, I don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s the way it was set up. And the table had these heavy\ncrosspieces underneath. And there was a plush tablecloth, if you can imagine, it\u2019s more the kind\nof thing you can imagine over a piano, but it was over the table, and it had long fringes on it, and\nit was over the table in such a way that the points of the cloth were on the ends and so forth. And\nit was great place for me, I always had my little hideout there, it was a little -- like a little house,\nand I asked to borrow the scissors one day, and I climbed under there and I gave the tablecloth a\nhaircut. Not fun at the time. But was he different? I think he was also different because I think\nmy mother was probably an early feminist in many ways, although I don\u2019t think she called\nherself that at the time. She was the working partner in the hou -- in the home at the time that I\nremember, anyway, and she had, apparently, a very unusual and important job for a woman in\nsome kind of financial activity. Just exactly what it was, I never really knew or understood, and -\n- so she was out of my circle for much of the day. She was also not the one who was either as\npatient or as fun loving as I re-remember my father being. Not that my father was necessarily fun\nloving, but he was -- h-he smiled readily, as opposed to maybe yelling at me, which is more what\nI remember from my mother.",
        "A: Probably, although from my point of view it wasn\u2019t -- you know, it was never fair, and it was\nnever --",
        "A: Right. Well, it wasn\u2019t unusual for people of even modest means to have help in those days. I\nmean, this is now the 30\u2019s we\u2019re talking. And we did have what was known as a meisje, or a girl,\nwho -- who worked for us, and -- and in fact I remember -- I -- I remember s -- being served,\nwhen I was still in my crib, I remember her bringing me breakfast in the crib, and the breakfast\nconsisted of these things called Dutch rusk. I don\u2019t know if you know what those are, but it\u2019s sort\nof a light and airy kind of toasty thing of about a half an inch thick. And she always had them\ndrenched in honey. And so she would bring me these things in the crib, and the honey would be\nall over the place, and I hated it. I just despised it, and everything was st -- then sticky and\ndrippy, and you know, and you can imagine a toddler in the crib, and the honey. So yes, I think\nshe was probably one that took care of us.",
        "A: It\u2019s a very clear memory, and since it was a crib, I must have been two or so. Couldn\u2019t --\ncouldn\u2019t leave that sticky memory behind.",
        "A: Rosa, Rosa Schwarz.",
        "A: I-I\u2019m not really sure. It\u2019s possible that my mother was maybe a year older or so.",
        "A: Or maybe more. I-I don\u2019t really know. I know my mother was a very -- with me was a very\nlate parent -- mother. I mean, there are eight years difference between my sister and me.",
        "A: And I think that she married rather late, as well, so I\u2019m -- yeah, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m sort of guessing\nthat she was in her 40\u2019s when I was born.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Oh yes, very clearly, because I -- in addition to -- to a meisje who was taking care of us, she\nobviously as the big sister was often put in charge, and I always resented that terribly. And I\nthink my poor sister suffered horribly because of that, because I would probably always giver her\na hard time. I guess I was fairly headstrong. I\u2019m not above throwing a temper tantrum and\nscreaming, yelling and crying, and my poor sister had to put up with all that. So -- yeah, and --\nand basically, I think my sister and I are -- are -- are somewhat different personalities to begin\nwith. So I don\u2019t think that was an easy thing for her, and -- and it wasn\u2019t fun for me, you know,\nand there was -- it created this sister sibling sort of irritation. I because I didn\u2019t want to be told\nthat I couldn\u2019t do something, and she because I didn\u2019t want to do what she said I had to do.",
        "A: No, actually we lived in -- we lived in this very, very -- I guess bourgeois is probably the\nEnglish equivalent word for it, but in a -- a very, very nice residential area, not too far from the\nRiyksmuseum, on the Pieter de Hooch Straat. And it was all residential, so there was no\ncommercial activity going on there at all, which makes the presence of what was going on in our\nhouse even more puzzling, because my mother worked in the house, in -- in two rooms of our\nhouse was this contore or -- or office, as she would call it. And in Holland as you -- well,\ncertainly in Amsterdam, all the houses are built so that they are smack up against each other.\nAnd there is no sort of stand alone housing. And it goes all the way around the four sides of a\nblock that way. And what you have is people living on the ground floor, people living on the first\nfloor, and another couple second, and another on the third. And then the house part, what we\ncalled ground floor, or caw -- or house, has access to the backyards. And the backyards are all\npretty private, all surrounded by wooden fences, both in the middle and on the sides. So you\nreally have a-again, a -- a greater European sense of privacy, while at the same time you can see\ninto those yards from the first, second and third floor, not only of your building, but the one next\nto you on either side, and the one behind you from the other street. So there\u2019s -- yes, there is\nprivacy, and no there isn\u2019t privacy in -- in some way. And this house that we had was brick, as\nmost houses were, and there is not the front lawn kind of thing, and there\u2019s not the -- the curb\nlawn and so forth as we know it here, but -- but a city street, really, although it was residential.\nAnd we had -- that was unusual too, we had the ground floor, the house part and the first floor.\nBut the first f -- two rooms of the ground floor were this office. But there was nothing on the\nfront door, there was no mark of any kind, or title, or -- or -- or whatever. So I\u2019m still a little bit\nat a loss as to what this outfit was, I\u2019m only learning now from my sister who were the name --\nwhat were the names of some of the -- well, I did know one of the names, th-the boss was Mr.\nHalle. And I know that my mother disappeared in these two rooms for much of the day, but\nthat\u2019s about the extent of it.",
        "A: N-No. My sister might actually know that better.",
        "A: No, she might come out, you know, for -- briefly for a couple of minutes during the day. At\nleast that\u2019s my memory.",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t know --",
        "A: -- actually if --",
        "A: -- if it\u2019s accurate. For all I know she spent considerable time outside of it with me, only I\ndon\u2019t remember it.",
        "A: Mm-mm, mm-mm. No, I th -- I think partly because -- I mean later on becoming a working\nwoman myself, I had a little more sympathy for that. Because you may have limited time, you\u2019re\ntrying to spend it with your child, the child doesn\u2019t understand that urgency of the moment. You\nwant him or her to do x, y and z before you go back to the office, and they\u2019re not doing it. It\ncreates a lot of stress and strain. And I always had the sense somehow that my mother was very\nnervous, that she was anxious, that she was tense. And I never had that with my father.",
        "A: Now, as I say, that may all be -- I mean, the older I got the more appreciation I had of all of\nthe difficulties that these adults were going through, right throughout.",
        "A: Well, the only child I remember being around was the child next door. And this child lived I -\n- it was either the second or the third story apartment next door. But because as I explained you\ncan look into these yards, very often I would run into the yard and call up to her and she would\ncome running out to the veranda, and so forth, and then she\u2019d say, oh I will come over, or\nwhatever. And she\u2019d come over and play in our yard because we had the yard and they didn\u2019t,\nthey only had the veranda. And -- and of course one of my very earliest hurtful and -- and\nshocking memories is of me doing exactly that, running out one day, as I did so many days and\ncalling up to her to come out and play and she came to the edge of the veranda and she yelled\ndirty Jew at me and spat on me from the veranda. And I think it was the first really sort of\ncrushing childhood blow for -- for what that means when someone does that to you. And\nsomething that we sort of underestimate always in terms of its impact when we, for example,\ndeal with kids in school and their interactions and the bullying that takes place and the yelling\nand the -- y-you know, the sticks and stones line doesn\u2019t hold.",
        "A: Words can and do hurt.",
        "A: The thing that I have trouble with of course, is the chronology here.",
        "A: \u2019'm not sure.",
        "A: Yeah, right. So my guess is it was some -- it would have to be after. It would have had to be\nafter, I\u2019m guessing. What I don\u2019t remember is exactly when and where this happened in relation\nto my starting school, which was more of a -- what do you call that, sort of a marker, y -- a time,\nchronology marker for me. I just have the recollection of that incident, and -- and it\u2019s sort of a --\na little bit -- perhaps out of sequence maybe now.",
        "A: I have a clear recollection of the beginning of this sort of -- what I later understood as a really\nsort of maniacal way of building up the fear in the population. So the first time that I was aware\nthat there was a major difference going on outside my home was the fact that I had started\nschool, and then I had stopped school. So that was probably the first, although it might have been\npreceded by taking one of these walks with my dad, and the same wonderful walks that we used\nto take, and going down the street, I remember the -- there was a school opposite our house. It\nwasn\u2019t the school that I went to, but it was some other school, and again there was no lawn in the\nfront, but they did have these sort of both ornamental and -- and physical heavy iron chains. And\nI used to love to sit on those and swing on them. But I wasn't doing that with my father, we were\n-- we were going out for a walk and going down the block and turning right as we did, and I\nremember there on the opposite, diagonally opposite side of the street used to be an empty lot.\nAnd all of a sudden this particular day we went there, and it was all surrounded in wooden\nfencing, but not your attractive fencing or whatever, but in these -- it\u2019s the stuff that they used to\nhave around baseball -- corner lot baseball thing -- I mean, I don\u2019t know -- exactly know how to\nsay it, but you couldn\u2019t -- there were these vertical planks next to each other and you couldn\u2019t\nlook through them. And so all of a sudden there is no empty lot except for this wooden fencing\nall around, and all of a sudden there is an opening in the fence, a door and a -- and a Nazi soldier\nwalks out. And he is striding down the street and he comes towards my father and he asks him\nfor a light for his cigarette. And I -- I remember almost as if it was yesterday, that my father, this\npatient, gentle man, really tensed, and lit the soldier\u2019s cigarette. And the soldier very politely said\nthank you and walked on. And my father swore under his breath. And I could sense this man\u2019s\nbehavior was so out of character from how I knew him, that I knew that there was something\namiss, but I, again had no -- no -- certainly no knowledge at the time what that meant. And what\nhe said under his breath was Rotmof. Rotmof being the -- mof being the derogatory term used for\nthe Nazis, and the rot meaning rotten. You know, so he was saying basically, rotten Nazi. And I\ndidn\u2019t know what Nazi meant, and I couldn\u2019t understand why he would be saying this. I -- when\nI saw this soldier coming out I didn\u2019t know s -- I didn\u2019t know from soldiers, I really didn\u2019t\nunderstand anything. If you\u2019re asking me what was my childhood memory, I knew he was a\nsoldier, that was --",
        "A: -- that was it. And I only knew he was called a Rotmof, because that\u2019s what my father said.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Well, hard to say, I -- I knew that it was something that was probably not good because he\ndidn\u2019t say it out loud. And I knew that it was probably something that I wasn\u2019t supposed to copy,\nbecause he didn\u2019t say it out law -- loud. I don\u2019t think -- I don\u2019t remember, but I don\u2019t think I\nasked him what he said.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Mm-hm.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure I must have felt something, because it wasn\u2019t like me not to either question, or to --",
        "A: -- I -- I -- I\u2019m sure I must have absorbed something that was of that nature. It was probably\nanger at that point, and not fear. I don\u2019t remember -- I do remember the anger. And I c -- I sensed\nthat he had suppressed anger. And it was a whole new emotion for me because that was not what\nhe ever displayed.",
        "A: Six.",
        "A: Th-There was no public kindergarten, no.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, in talking -- in referring back to this tension between my sister and me, I mean\nhere she was not only this big girl who had all this responsibility and this power over me, and she\nwas a schoolgirl and she had time set aside for doing homework and it was very much respected\nwhat she did, and -- and actually she was in the -- a student in the gymnasium, which is the\nDutch so -- college preparatory, and the heavy duty curriculum of history and geography and\nalgebra and geometry and German and French and English and Greek and Latin. And here she\nwas partaking of these mysterious disciplines and this must have something to do with the fact\nthat she had the responsibility for me. So I thought, well if I can access that also, then she won\u2019t\nhave to do this any more, maybe. So I was very excited about starting school. I thought this was\njust going to be, you know, this was -- this was my way to heaven. And -- and -- and I couldn\u2019t\nwait, I really couldn\u2019t wait, I was so excited. And I don\u2019t think I really had more than a couple of\nweeks when I was no longer allowed to go to school.\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: Right. I don\u2019t have any real recollection, but having just visited her, as we are always wont to\ndo, we tend to try to spend some time both reminiscing and sort of corroborating memories. And\nwe\u2019 ve tried to make that a little bit more formal project, but that hasn\u2019t worked too well because\nof our individual lives sort of diverging and so on. But she shared with me, and I actually have it,\nI haven\u2019t had a chance to look at it, a book that was written about what happened at that time, to\nher school and her schoolmates. And -- and herself for that matter. What -- what happened was\nthat before the stopping of school, what -- what was done was one of these many decrees that\nwas offered. And the decree was that no -- that all the Jewish children had to go to the Jewish\nschool -- to a Jewish school, or a school that was set aside as a Jewish school. Now, why they\ndidn\u2019t do that with the elementary school kids, I don\u2019t know, and for all I know they did, except\nperhaps it was too far, or it -- my folks didn\u2019t think it was important, I don\u2019t know. But for the\nhigh school, they did set aside something wa -- which they called the joodse -- I think it was\ncalled the joodse lyceum. And so -- so all the Jewish kids were sort of pulled out of their s --\nrespective schools and told to go to this one school. And then they were tol -- and then were told\nthere wasn\u2019t going to be any more school at all for the Jewish kids. And then, what I just learned,\nwhich I didn\u2019t know, was that apparently many of the teachers continued to try to teach these\nkids, and that the kids were meeting at respective parent\u2019s homes, as many of -- of them as could.\nAnd this book that she showed me was a book that was written by her -- one of her teachers from\nthe gymnasium, who came with these kids and -- and taught them. I think I have this correct.\nAnd the book is basically not only a story of how this unfolded, and how they moved from\nwhose home to which home and where it was located, and what happened when a particular\nstudent wasn\u2019t there, and everyone knew what had happened, which was that that family had\nbeen called up and deported. So there was this constant threat that ran through the meetings for\nhowever long they were able to -- to -- to carry on, about people disappearing, and the students\nbeing quite aware of this, and the teachers being very aware of this. And yet, trying to continue\nto keep going and to keep going, and then as I say, I have not had a chance to look at this book,\nbut the book has since -- she was also interviewed for that. And one of the appendices in the\nbook has the lists of all the students by the year that they should have been in -- in this school,\nand basically tells you what, to the best of this man\u2019s a-ability, happened to each of these, and --\nand how -- how this all just came to pass. And it\u2019s -- it\u2019s all there documented and the -- and the\ndifficulties of meeting in the homes, and the -- and the effort on people to try to create some\nsense of normalcy for these kids, who were clearly much, much, much more aware of what was\nhappening than I certainly was. I mean, I had not a clue that she was even doing this at the time.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",

I had, for example a very -- I\nhave still, to this day, very clear memories of not being able to move about without wearing a\njacket that had the Jewish star on it. And I can\u2019t remember in the order of things when this came,\nbut I do distinctly remember that -- th-that our walks had to stop because we weren't allowed --\nafter dark we weren\u2019t allowed to come out -- s -- go outside. And I do remember him being\ntaken, and I remember the anxiety and the tension. And I do remember him coming back, and\nthis imme -- enormous relief when he came back. And this happened several times, and it\u2019s --\nagain in -- in reflecting about this time, and thinking about it over these many, many years, I\u2019m\njust struck by another psychological manipulation of the population, you know, th-this constant\ninstilling of some activity that would raise the level of anxiety, certainly among the Jews.",
        "A: [have no idea where he was taken except I remember being told or hearing -- overhearing\nthem say that he was being taken away for questioning. And I have no idea why they took my\nfather, I have no idea what they were questioning him about. I don\u2019t know whether my sister\nknows that, or whether this conceivably was now coinciding with the beginning of the\ndeportation of the eastern European Jews who had fled to Holland in an effort to escape what\nwas going on on the eastern front.",
        "A: And -- and so many of these people were originally housed at Westerbork and -- cause there\nwas no place to keep them.",
        "A: And so they, in a sense, were sort of sitting ducks for being the first de -- deportees. And --\nand that then later became a kind of holding camp, really. It\u2019s possible that they were trying to do\nthis kind of random questioning in order to make sure that the rest of the Jews didn\u2019t flee. I\nmean, Holland being what it is, and where it is, there wasn\u2019t really a lot we could do on -- as was\nthe unfortunate fate of those who fled to Holland. It\u2019s a tiny country, about the size of New\nJersey, I think, flat as a pancake, a lot of it reclaimed land from the sea. You know, you can kind\nof look -- stand in one place and look to the beach and the shore and so forth. There were no hills\nand mountain caves or thick forests where people could flee or hide. So you were in a s -- ina\nsense a captive, you know, with your back against the sea. And I know that all these countries\nmade a desperate ef -- or at least the Jews in those countries made a desperate effort to get across\nthe channel, get across the sea and -- and -- and go someplace else.

We couldn\u2019t go to the\npublic market, but I remember going at some point in this time with my mother, and I always\nloved animals, and I always wanted to pet the horses. I mean, the -- the market consisted of all\nthese horse drawn carriages lined up and -- and people peddled their wares from the -- from these\ncarts. And she was always, forever pulling me away from the horses, and I -- that was not where\nI wanted to be. But I -- I always wanted to talk to the animals and pet the animals and so forth.",

I-\nI don\u2019t remember toys at this time at all, no recollection of -- of things that were mine, I only had\nrecollections of things in the house, or things 1n the yard. I remember there must not have been\ngood and adequate refrigeration space because my parents kept limburger cheese in the\ncoalhouse in the backyard, you know, the house that contained the coal for the heating and so on.\nAnd so it must be that that was because it was cold. Or maybe it was because it was smelly, I\ndon\u2019t know. Or both?",

I mean, it was nothing that I remember\nwith any positive or negative feeling, but I remember this sort of one time trip there, and then\nthat was more or less it.

No candle lighting, no -- if there was, I don\u2019t know it, and I don\u2019t remember it.\nIt might have been part of the every day world, and -- but I don\u2019t recall it.

There was a\nconnection and I did realize that there was -- that I basically was now being labeled, that I was,\nyou know, that I was Jew, and that that was -- that that was a way of making sure that everyone\nelse knew I was a Jew. And th-that left a kind of -- what\u2019s the word I want? Sort of an unclear,\nbut an -- a -- a -- it left a feeling of understanding what was happening, but not -- there was no\nunderstanding of why and how come and who was making us do that. I d -- I just began to sense\nthat there was a connection between what was on the jacket, and what the child had said, and that\nthere was some reason that people needed to be able to recognize me and knew that -- and know\nthat I was a Jew. And why, or how come, or what was it about being a Jew that needed\ndemarcation labeling, I had no idea.",

        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: I remember my -- yes, I think I did, actually. I certainly remember my family wearing it, and I\nthink that the -- there were -- I -- we were not actually living in a Jewish area, in a pronounced,\npredominantly Jewish area, so I didn\u2019t really know about the whole Jewish section of\nAmsterdam until I was an adult and went back to Amsterdam and -- and actually toured that area\nand saw the synagogues and was in the Jewish museum and saw the statue commemorating the\nuprising and the strike and so forth. I -- I knew nothing of that as a child, so that may account in\npart for why I didn\u2019t see more of that. And it wasn\u2019t really until I was an adult and I s-studied\nlots of stuff, including the whole psychological phenomena of -- of labeling and what that means.\nAnd -- and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar with a very, very powerful piece that was done right after\nMartin Luther King died, by the teacher in Riceville, Iowa, which \u201cFrontline\u201d featured on PBS,\nand I have since used with my students a good many times, which is just basically having the\nchildren experience what happens when you do -- do label and stigmatize people. Sometimes it\u2019s\ncalled -- the program is called, \u201cBlue Eyes, Brown Eyes.\u201d There\u2019s another version of it that also\ntakes this woman into prisons and other areas of -- in -- of human interaction where she tries the\nsame thing with adults, and it works almost more successfully even. And -- and that\u2019s called,\n\u201cThe Eye of the Storm.\u201d I\u2019ve forgotten which one comes first, but -- and then she also has\nanother -- she has a reunion with that first class with whom she tries it, and it 1s incredible how\npositive the influence on these people this early exercise was, where, you know, she -- she makes\nthe attempt to have the children understand what it\u2019s like when you do that to people. And she\nseparates them according to the color of their eyes. And then she says to the children, you know,\nI understand that -- first she tries it with whatever, blue eyes, and she says, I understand that you\n-- | -- | have just learned that -- that blue eyed people are just not as smart as brown eyed people.\nAnd then later in the day she says, you know, they\u2019re not even as attentive, and they\u2019re not as\ngood as -- you know, she goes on and on with this. And then she said, you know what, we should\nlabel these people so that we can more easily recognize them, and then we don\u2019t have to choose\nthem on the team, and we don\u2019t have to play with them, because they\u2019re not as smart as we are.\nAnd so why don\u2019t we put collars on them. And then you see this whole effect of what this\nlabeling does to these third or fourth graders. And -- and 1-1-1t\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s an eye opener. It\u2019s\nshocking.",
        "A: I -- not for me, but I was six years old.",
        "A: Now, when kids are nine, there\u2019s a whole different ball game. And when you\u2019re an adult it\u2019s\ndifferent, and when you\u2019re 14 like my sister, it\u2019s altogether different.",
        "A: And of course the -- the things that you associate with the label also have something to do\nwith it. If you put the collars on and you tell people they\u2019re smarter, then you get the reverse\neffect.",
        "A: And you do, you do. You tell the kids they\u2019re smarter, they behave, th -- I mean that this is --\na lot of educational research is out there. You tell the kids they\u2019re smarter, they perform better.",
        "A: But -- but that was not the intention here by the Nazis, clearly. And actually this is the kind of\nthing that -- that when I was talking to you earlier about sharing recollections of the war year, the\npre-war years with my Dutch friend, who became the professor of religion at Smith, he\nremembers when this was being -- this was going on in the town where he grew up, I think it was\nBreda. And he said all of a sudden the kids, his buddies at school took this as formal approval of\ndoing stuff like yelling epithets at people who were wearing the star. I -- I mean, th-they took this\nas open season, essentially, so that there was a yi -- and he -- he recalled -- I remember this very\nclearly, he recalled when we were doing our joint recollections, walking home from school with\na bunch of his friends, and there was an old man who was wearing the star and was clearly\nelderly and so forth and so on, and that the boys who the day before had been perfectly polite and\npassed this man without any events happening at all, started to stone him. Now, you know, here\nyou have this kind of institutional approval because as -- you now say to everybody, we\u2019ve\nlabeled these people as untermenschen, as dirt, as people that you can do anything you like with.\nI mean, it\u2019s unfortunately a little bit of I think what we did in Vietnam is we socialized the\nsoldiers to be willing to do unheard of, inhuman things. I mean, what these guys did in My Lai\ndidn\u2019t come about because someone wanted to have a heyday. So -- so the dehumanizing effect\nthat you can create, that you can program essentially, you can socialize people to participate in,\neven though their teachings and everything else would have you believe that they wouldn\u2019t and\nshouldn\u2019t. And happily there were people who didn\u2019t, and who stood up. But then -- then you see\nthen the Nazis come in and they manipulate that, so they arrest the people who were protecting\nJews, or they have a shooting in the square to basically call attention to anyone who was trying\nto live up to his or her Protestant or Catholic teachings, and not do this to their fellow human\nbeings. But it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it makes you think about how incredibly thin the layer of civilization\nreally is. And when the chips are down, you know, the scapegoating, the stereotyping, the\nlabeling all play one against, another against, but with the other, to -- to create -- I don\u2019t know\nwhat it is about us that we always have to feel better than somebody, and in order to feel better\nwe have to put someone else down. And that\u2019s what they were successfully doing.",
        "A: No, it\u2019s really the one incident that I do remember. I d-don\u2019t know whether my sister had\nmore. It\u2019s the only incident I remember before the war. The next one that I remember actually\ncame after I came to America and went to elementary school, and I was -- I was always a bit of\nan activist I guess, and I was anxious to fit in and blend in and do all the things that all the other\nkids do, and lose my accent and learn to play baseball and all those kinds of things. But I was on\nthe safety patrol, and so I was -- my job was to see that the little kids got on the bus first and\nweren\u2019t trampled by the big kids, and all that stuff on the school bus. And -- and I remember I\nwas in sixth grade by then, and there was a boy who was trying to sneak into line and get on the\nbus and I yanked him out and said he couldn\u2019t do this, or whatever, whatever, he had to let the\nlittle kids go first. And he turned around and he called me a dirty Jew. He was a classmate of\nmine. That was my first experience with it in America.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t really remember.",
        "A: And of course, then you get in -- then you get caught up into something else which is by the\ntime you\u2019re 12 years old and you get the message that you don\u2019t want to be a squealer and you\ndon\u2019t want to this and that and the other. And I don\u2019t think I responded, and I don\u2019t think I told\nanybody. But I don\u2019t remember.",

        "A: Ido remember because I remember it so distinctly, and at first I thought that it was maybe in\nmy memory that had been clouded over or colored by the nature of the events. But that was in\nfact not the case because it\u2019s been corroborated that in fact it was twilight. It was early evening,\nand again that\u2019s sort of not a time when you expect people to come to the door. A-Again, I -- I\nsometimes think about these things much -- much -- I mean way after the fact in the sense that\nwhen I first remembered that -- th -- or any of these experiences, I didn\u2019t remember them with all\nof the stuff that I bring to 1t now, which 1s to say, lord, just think about the minds that devised all\nthese schemes. So usually by the time you think you\u2019re -- you know, you\u2019re in the evening, and\nunless you\u2019re expecting company you sort of think you\u2019re safe inside your house. Well -- and I\nthink this was the first time that he was called up by these Gestapo that was in the evening. The -\n- the other times had all been daylight. So they came in the evening and they knocked on the\ndoor, and I remember -- I think I was somewhere not far behind, watching the scene. And they\nasked for my father very politely, and they said to my mother, \u201cWe\u2019ll be back for you later.\u201d And\nto this day, I think and think of -- about this, and I keep asking myself, were these soldiers trying\nto give my mother the high sign? Were they trying to give her an opportunity to do something?\nWere they ineffective and inefficient Nazis and slipped, and shouldn\u2019t have said that? You know,\nwhat -- what was going on here in the minds of these guys?",
        "A: Pll never know.\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "A: Oh, definitely not Dutch soldiers.",
        "A: There were no s -- to my knowledge there were no soldiers in Dutch uniform around at this\ntime.",
        "A: The -- the capitulization -- capitulization of the Dutch to the Nazis, as I understood it -- and\nI\u2019ve only just recently begun to look at this, because for so many years, I felt this was not an area\nI wanted to study, this was not an area I wanted to look at as a scholar and so forth. Now, I\u2019m\nbeginning to have a little different sense, and -- and actually for a number of reasons. But a -- as I\nunderstood it, it was somewhere around this time that -- that the Dutch government basically was\na sort of government under the aegis of a Dutch -- a -- no, I think 1t was a Dutch Nazi general\nsome -- some sort of person like that, named Seyss-Inquart, who was basically put in charge,\nwhere the -- whereas the queen -- I guess the queen and the -- and the royalty wasn\u2019t exactly the\nruling figure anyway, given the Dutch combination of a constitutional monarchy, and so on. But\nthe queen left for England and the prince and princess and their children left for Canada. And --\nand actually later on I-I remember hearing some broadcasts of the queen speaking to us from\nEngland and so on. But so this -- this -- putting this person in charge again, was -- was one of\nthese pieces that I didn\u2019t -- I wasn't aware of at the time. I mean, what does a little kid know\nabout government and how it operates? I didn\u2019t know where the rules were coming from that\nwere being asked -- well, were being laid down. I knew that there was something about the fact\nthat we were not any longer having lots of red, white and blue flags out, and orange streamers on\nthe flag poles, which all represented Holland and the House of Orange. I don\u2019t remember seeing\nNazi flags either, but I didn\u2019t see the Dutch flags. And -- and it was again one of these ways of\nmaking things seem like they were normal. So there was a government and it was issuing\ndecrees, and this was a Dutch, presumably -- th-there was a fair amount of collusion among the\nDutch. Something that only has come to my knowledge somewhat from the experiences I had,\nbut much more -- more real when I became an adult and read a little bit more, and heard a little\nbit more, because I'd always grown up thinking, you know, the Dutch were so wonderful, and\nthe Dutch basically saved me, and my sister and my mother. And they did that also to some other\nJews. But there was also a lot of collusion going on. The NSB was -- the NSB was known as the\nparty that was in collusion with the Nazis. And it was -- 1-1t was probably a way in which -- in\nwhich all politics and occupation works, and which uncomfortably I\u2019m aware of, the United\nStates does likewise, which is you find your way in to some society by a group of people with\nwhom you associate and with whom you vision a common goal and you infiltrate, basically. And\nso the -- the amount of collusion there was rather shockingly high, from my perspective. Not one\nI\u2019m tremendously proud of. Holland, on the other hand, has had a long, historical tradition of\nreligious freedom, going back to William of Orange, and was probably also one of the reasons\nthat the Jews found receptive ground and receptive society, because they fled from so many\nplaces of persecution, including Spain. So -- and actually my -- my grandparents, my father\u2019s\nparents came -- now I don\u2019t know if they directly or their parents came up from Spain, but then\nactually that\u2019s something that I\u2019m hoping at some point to get back to The Netherlands and do\nsome of that research, because Holland and all other countries besides the U.S. have, of course,\nthis incredible record keeping and documents, archive stuff going back to the Middle Ages, and\nso I\u2019m hoping to do some of that research myself.",

I don\u2019t remember if it was German or Dutch at that\ntime. I do remember at other times that it was German. And I do remember at other times -- a-\nand this is something now again, I can\u2019t swear to. I don\u2019t remember now whether I really heard\nthis, or whether my current knowledge fills in the heil Hitler, I don\u2019t know, but I am pretty sure\nthat some of those other times when he was arrested, I did hear it. I don\u2019t remember it the night\nthat he was arrested this time.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. O-Or if he did it was probably -- again, I don\u2019t know if this was because he,\nas a parent he was trying not to create greater anxiety, or because he really thought he might be\ncoming back again, the way he always had in these past times. But I don\u2019t remember it.",
        "A: He just goes out.",
        "A: Well, in retrospect, I don\u2019t know how radical it was, but she basically grabbed a bag, and I\nstill remember the looks of the bag, it was sort of a yucky brown, n-no -- not an attractive bag,\nbut some sort of satchel [indecipherable] satchel of some sort of plastic or leather, or something,\nand throws in a hairbrush, and a toothbrush and -- for each of us, grabs our jackets, takes us by\nthe hand and walks out the door, literally walks out the door and closes the door behind her. And\nwe walked -- a -- a -- and we -- she -- we had to come down steps, it was up a couple steps, and\nwe came down s -- and walked into the street and I remember being aware of the fact that it was\ncurfew, because Jews were not allowed on the street, because there was a curfew. They were not\nallowed on the trolleys, they were not allowed in the libraries, they were not allowed in the\nparks. Alla -- aya -- they were not allowed in school. And -- and these decrees, by the way, were\nnot given all at once, they were -- this is why I keep reminding m-myself and others about the\nmind that was operating to keep upping the ante, to keep this level of normalcy, but just enough\nfear and enough intrusion into the way of life that 1t was clear who was in charge. So one decree\nwould be about you can\u2019t use the libraries, and you -- so you say to yourself, well, alright, we\ncan get along without the library. Next time it\u2019s the park. Well, you know, we\u2019ll play in the\nbackyard, we go -- we won\u2019t take walks. So it -- always it\u2019s also somehow to contain the\npopulation you\u2019re affecting, by making them adjust all the time. And -- and that adjustment,\nwhich is again something that if I -- if 1 can I may come back to later, but it\u2019s -- on the one hand,\nit\u2019s a peculiar characteristic of us humans, that we can adjust to an incredible amount of stuff\nbefore we say stop. And in one sense we should have said stop right there, and we should have\nrisen up and we should have said we won\u2019t take this. And of course there were efforts at doing\nthat, sporadically here and there. But by and large, the effect of this layering 1s to keep the people\nfrom not boiling the waters, and doing what I think Jewish populations have done since time\nimmemorial as guests in new societies, which is to say, well, you know, if we do what they ask,\nif we just comply with what people are asking us to do, then they\u2019Il leave us alone. But they\ndidn\u2019t leave us alone. And so that\u2019s -- that always is something that comes to my mind when\nthings happen, and I say, well should we accept this, or should we stand up and fight right here?\nAnd it a -- and one of these things happened in my town in Massachusetts where the question\ncame should we make a noise about this or should we not. And -- and the general feeling of the\nJewish community was led by the rabbi, which was, w-w-well, you know, we\u2019ll just let this go\nby kind of thing. And mine, s -- much to my surprise, cause I\u2019m not necessarily a person who\nmakes waves, but I said this is wrong. It\u2019s not right, and we should be -- here in America we\nshould be calling attention to the fact that this is wrong. But anyway, the effect of this layering,\nas I say, was -- w-was t-to keep people in compliance, and to, at the same time instill this\nmodicum of fear and anxiety. And -- and I -- I -- I don\u2019t know what my father\u2019s feeling was at\nthat point when he was taken away. I don\u2019t know whether he himself had an inkling that this was\ndifferent, or whether he really did think he was coming back, or -- I -- I -- I really don\u2019t know\nwhat they thought, and whether this is a question of radical behavior on my mother\u2019s part, yes\nand no, and it\u2019s probably a dual answer because as we walked across the city, and I longingly\nlooking at the trolleys, I remember that cause I was little kid and I was tired and I wanted to ride.\nAnd the trolleys, I remember this eerie feeling as the trolleys were going by and I was -- they\nwere totally empty. There would be one person sitting in the trolleys, because -- not that -- that\nthe non-Jews weren\u2019t allowed on the trolleys, but the general tenor in the -- in the country was\nbeginning to be much more concerned and so people weren\u2019t out going to the theater and doing\nstuff. And I remember us walking through the archway of the Rijksmuseum, which is a gorgeous\nVictorian building with all its towers and spires and so forth and part of it is arched over a\nroadway which at that time still had the old fashioned heavy cobblestones that were like little\nminiature hills, each one of them. And our steps were re-echoing in that archway as we walked\nthrough, and I remember feeling a certain amount of fear. Cause I knew we were not supposed to\nbe out. And I knew that my mother was afraid and that she was anxious and we had to hurry and\nwe had to be quiet. And I knew that we couldn\u2019t help ourselves, there was this clatter of the\nfootsteps. And so the sense that somebody might be coming for us, or coming after us was\ndefinitely there, in -- in my head at that time, because I remember the feeling. I didn\u2019t know why,\nbut I had the feeling. I knew that we were leaving and that we were going someplace else and we\n-- we -- the -- where we lived was called Amsterdam South, it was the southern part of the\ncountry, and -- o-of the city, and we went to Amsterdam West, which was across town, through\nthe western part, which was a much more commercial area.",

I [indecipherable] you always do what little\nkids are told to do before you go out. But it was just -- my recollection is there was no time to be\nlost.

        "A: Y-You mean --",
        "A: -- what else he might have been up to?",
        "A: That\u2019s true. Well, that\u2019s true, and of course there was this whole other activity that was going\non, that I only learned about later, which was -- well, some of which I n -- I was aware of, which\nis that everybody had to have identity cards, and the Jewish ones had a big J stamped on it. And I\nalso knew, and I -- this was before, I believe before my father was taken, that a friend of the\nfamily, who was a minister, actually provided us with fake baptism papers. Because -- I-I\nremember that at the time, and I remember sort of hearing about it, and perhaps even be -- being\ngiven one of those t-to have on my person. And of course, initially it was, I think as I mentioned,\nfirst when they started doing the calling up of Jews -- first of all, they also instituted another one\nof their pieces of madness. They started this thing called Joods Raad, which was basically\ntranslated as the Jewish councils. They -- they took various I-leaders within the Jewish\ncommunity and created a kind of a self governance piece, so that essentially they gave them the\norders of what they wanted done, and they made them responsible for carrying it out. So now\nwhat you\u2019re doing is you\u2019re creating this horrendous thing between people of the same marked,\nsteri -- stigmatized group and saying, you do the dirty work, you choose who\u2019s going to be called\nup next. You are the ones that promulgates the decrees of n-not -- no access of the schools and\nthis and that and the other. So the Jewish councils were having to do this to their own people.\nAnd the -- the -- the tendency to first of all condemn these people roundly, I think 1s very great,\nbecause you\u2019re saying, you know, what the hell were you doing tell -- sending us off to the -- be\nslaughtered. By the same token, I don\u2019t think they were all doing it from that perspective. I think\nsome of them were doing it because, as I said before, they thought that well, if we just comply\nwith that they\u2019re asking, and maybe I can help to keep my people sort of understanding that if we\njust keep calm and do what they ask, we can get through this all right. I think they were doing it\nfrom that perspective, some of them. I think others probably were doing it to save their own\nskins, sort of either realizing whatever was happening it wasn\u2019t good, but if they volunteered to\ndo this, then maybe they would not have to go. And I have to say that, coming through this\nexperience, I don\u2019t think any of us is ever able to say what we would or would not do under any\ncircumstances such as these. I don\u2019t think you know what you\u2019re capable of doing, I don\u2019t think\nyou know what you\u2019re capable of tolerating, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re cap -- yo-you have any sense of\nthe reality of w-what you might do if you or your family members were under siege or in peril of\nlosing their lives. I just think it\u2019s impossible.",

        "A: I don\u2019t know if I was carrying it or whether my parents had them, to be able to produce them.\nBut the reason for these certificates also was that initially -- oh, I guess I lost track of the flow of\nthis, initially they called up the refugees from eastern Europe and deported those, and made nice\nspace available in Westerbork and so forth, and then they began to deport various among the\nJews. Now who they were and why these people were chosen, I don\u2019t know. And I don\u2019t know if\nperhaps my father was instrumental in perhaps helping other people get papers or something like\nthat, I don\u2019t know. This went -- first they started calling up the people who were full blooded\nJews. And then, when there were no more of those -- and of course, you say, or you might say,\nhow did they know who those people were? Well, this is where this incredible record keeping.\nAll they had to do was go to the municipal offices and get the birth records and the this and the\nthat and the other. And -- and they did that. They did an incredible amount of this kind of spade\nwork. So they would s -- first call up the ones who were hundred percent Jewish, and then they\nwould call up the people who were 75 percent Jewish. And then they would call up the people\nwho were 50 percent Jewish. And then they would call up the people who had -- the one ha-half\nof a couple who had intermarried, and they would leave the others. And this -- this is what gave\nrise to the papers. Could you show that you had not -- no -- were no longer Jewish? But it didn\u2019t\nhelp, because after awhile they said it didn\u2019t count, that -- you know, at first, yes, they\u2019d leave\nyou alone, cause now you were not Jewish.

And this 1s the story I heard from him\nonce we came to the United States, that he talked to my folks and urged them to leave, and urged\nthem to drop everything and just come, and they didn\u2019t want to go.",

And apparently it was\nmy mother who didn\u2019t want to go, at least that\u2019s my recollection of the way this was told. And I -\n- I could be wrong about that, but -- and I often thought about this afterwards, and I thought, why\nwould she not want to go when this was on the horizon? And I think it was just such an\nincredible disbelief that this would ever. I mean, it\u2019s like so many things that face us, and you\nkind of think, no, I mean it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s probably just in human nature that you ke -- you have to\neither get your head in the wave rolling over you, or you have to be enormously courageous, or\nmaybe a little bit crazy, or even stupid by some people\u2019s judgment, to drop everything, to drop\nthis good job that she had, to leave this lovely house and all the -- the material things and take off\nfor no man\u2019s la -- I mean, America? [indecipherable] not that it was no man\u2019s land, in fact she\nhad an uncle I know who came back and brought her s -- her brother some gifts and brought her\nsome things from the United States and so on. So she knew about the United States. But she\napparently said no, but then my father -- so the story goes, my father who took my uncle to the\nboat, apparently said to him, if anything ever happens to us, will you see to my children? And,\nyou know, I\u2019ve heard this story repeated from my uncle, and then also from my sister, but I\ndidn\u2019t know about it. So if there was something pre-thought, or predicted, or anticipated, 1t must\nhave come from both the news and reading what happened around Europe and this was coming\ncloser and closer, and then actually having my father arrested. So, between my brother fleeing --\nmy -- her brother, my mother\u2019s brother fleeing, and saying to his sister, why don\u2019t you drop\neverything and come, and the actual things that happened after he left, they must have done some\nthings, including the fact that when we finally ended up at the home where we -- where we were\nhidden for the war, and led into the basement, there in the basement were two beds that I\nrecognized as having come from my home, and a quilt and some blankets that I knew were from\nhome.

There was something else there that I recognized. Upstairs in the\nlower shelves of the buffet were not only some staples that had been put there, which apparently\nmy folks had been responsible for putting there, there was also my mother\u2019s best china.

And this s-street was different from my street, in that it was clearly a somewhat later\nperiod when it was built, because the housing was very much the same in the sense that the\nhouses were up tight against each other, there was not space in between. And it -- they went all\nthe way around the block, and it was a house floor and first, second and third apartment. But the\nhouse floor in this case, was the store, was the commercial establishment. And it had a store\nwindow. And so there was a portico between two stores, and in that portico, you had first of all\nthe -- on the left side the store entrance, then you had another entrance that went to the three\napartments upstairs, and then you had another apartment entrance for the three apartments in this\nside, and another store door that went into this place, which we now entered. And the store was a\nliquor store. And it turned out that my mom and my sister, which I now know, knew this person\nwho opened the door.",
        "A: My sister also knew her, but I don\u2019t think she knew of these preparations. I don\u2019t think so. In\nany case, we were basically whisked inside and -- a-and shown to -- through the store, into the\nback of the store, which was sort of -- these people were of very modest means, they were people\nwho were living in back of the store, which was not usually what people did. They had an\napartment someplace else in town, or perhaps upstairs above the store, but they tended not to\nhave as their permanent residence, the little bitty living spaces in the back of the ha -- of the\nstore. And when we came to the back of the store, and went out of the actual store part, there was\na little, small sort of in-between room, and in one end of the wall there was -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s often\nspoken of as a typical Dutch arrangement with the bed inside the wall. And in that recessed bed\nwas a much elderly man, and much older than the woman, and it was her husband, and he was\nalso ailing in some way, I don\u2019t remember exactly what. And -- and his name was Uncle John, I\nmean he was referred to as onc -- ome -- ome -- Oome Sjon. And then w-we were shown another\ndoor, and the door led down into the basement. And we went down the stairs in the basement,\nand there was a basement that ran all the way from underneath the storefront, all the way to the\nbackyard. And in the part underneath the storefront, this is how modestly, if not poor these\npeople were, their only son had a curtained off area that was his room, his place. And there were\nvery few material things there, or anyplace else in the house. And then we turned to go towards\nthe part that was closest to the backyard, and to these two sort of recessed, if you will, windows.\nI mean, it was sort of like -- I guess it\u2019s what you call a bulkhead, out in the yard. And instead of\na door there were these glass windows. But it meant that there was a sort of sunken well with --\nwith -- with some iron bars across the top where people stepped 1-in the yard. And -- and the only\nway to get any light or air would be to open those. And of course, it rains a lot in Holland as it\ndid then, and these wells would fill up with water, up to the top practically, and we had to -- I\nremember we took turns trying to siphon that out, by mouth, literally, to get the water out of\nthose things so that we could open them and have some air. But anyway, when we came into this\ncellar and went towards the yard part, that\u2019s where I saw two beds covered in quilts and blankets,\nor a quilt and -- and blanket that I remembered from my home. So that\u2019s when it first registered\non me, even at that young age, that somehow this was part of what the grown-ups had in mind,\nsomething that they\u2019d already planned. And that first night we just went to bed, that I remember.",

And then in the next few days, we were\ndown in the basement and we were -- the store was still operating, so the store was open and\nthere were people coming and going and so on. And -- and the -- the woman of the house, whose\nname was Katoos Koolhaas Revers, who we called Tante Toos, or cut -- it\u2019s a short form of\nKatoos, and tante, of course, is aunt. And she took care of the infirm husband, and the young son,\nwho was a few years older than my sister, so a teenager, and -- and the store, as long as it ran.\nAnd we were in the basement and then for a fairly short period of time, we were, every few days\nor so, were allowed to kind of come up in the yard and sit and have a cup of tea or something, for\na short while, as if to say to the neighbors who might have been looking in from three sides of\nthis block, 1f you remember how I spaced this out, who might have been wondering who were\nthese people that were suddenly over there. So we looked like visitors, or we were trying to act\nlike visitors. And during this period there were still lots of people on this commercial street.\nEvery day the stores would open, and of course you had your butcher and baker and gr-\ngreengrocer, and stationary store. I mean, you didn\u2019t go to the market there, th -- you went to the\nindividual stores, and you didn\u2019t have supermarkets, certainly, or grocery stores. And -- well,\nyou, yes you had grocery stores, but they only dealt with, let\u2019s say, dry good and so on. So at\nfirst it was decided that -- that it was okay for me to go out and meet -- mix and mingle with the\ncrowd because I -- and this is when I heard it said, that I looked the least Jewish. Now, what did\nthat mean? Uh-huh, and my guess is that since my sister is somewhat darker haired than I am,\nand also older, and might have been less comfortable pretending to be someone she wasn\u2019t, they\nthought it was okay for me to get out there and play and then just pretend that I was visiting an\naunt, in case I was stopped. And this was also when I was supposed to be somebody other than\nHedy Cohen, which was, of course, my maiden name, and in -- and I was drilled, actually, before\nbeing allowed out, to say that my name was Hedy Vermeulen, and that I lived at, you know,\nsome other place, but that I was visiting my aunt over here. That stopped fairly soon, that I\nwasn\u2019t allowed to go out any more.",

And she apparently had a brother who was openly\nand outspokenly against it, and told her that she should just, you know, turn us in, that she\ncouldn\u2019t do this and shouldn\u2019t do this and so on. And somehow she prevailed. And -- and\nactually, when you asked before -- or maybe you didn\u2019t ask, but I said something about this -- the\nbusiness of the yards, and people being able to see. At this time the Nazis were doing something\nelse which 1s actually pretty well documented in -- in what\u2019s his name, Wyman\u2019s book.",
        "A: David Wyman\u2019s book where he actually has photographs of these -- these broadsides that\nwould be appearing on corner kiosks and so forth, of which there were many, and it would\nannounce things like rewards for any tips that would lead to the arrest of someone who was\neither harboring Jews, or who was seen consorting with Jews, or who knew of Jews who were\nsomeplace or other. So the business of being seen, and the business of being in the yard, and the\nbi -- 1-1t -- 1t was a tremendous danger not just for us, but for the family who was sheltering us.\nAnd so this proved to be an enormous burden for -- for -- not only for the people who were doing\nthe hiding but the people who were being hidden, to the point that there is a lot of evidence of\npeople who apparently couldn\u2019t tolerate putting this kind of danger on the people they loved, and\nthey would get themselves arrested. They would either run out during a search, and run into the\nstreet somewhere far away from the house that they had been in. And they were usually shot, or\nrounded up, or brought in or whatever. But that was not an infrequent phenomenon, because it\nwas so terrible to -- everybody knew what was going to happen. And then the rewards were such\nthat, I mean, when you think of the pettiness of, you know, something the equivalent of a dollar,\nor five dollars, would be the reward if you could give the Nazis a tip that would lead to some\narrests or other. And people were out doing this. They were out trying to collect these rewards.\nAnd you didn\u2019t know who would and who wouldn\u2019t.

        "A: Yes. No, she\u2019s younger.",
        "A: She\u2019s younger.",
        "A: Well, some of it actually is to be expected, in the sense that many people have the experience\nas parents of doing something together with other parents and there is a -- a disagreement about\nwhat youngsters can be allowed to do or not to do. So there was some of this tension between the\ntwo mothers. A-About what, I don\u2019t remember, do I have an example, no. I just knew it was\nthere. And because there was such a spread in ages, it was also difficult. There was s -- at least\nthen, before my mother died, there was this. There was also a kind of o-obvious -- and I -- and I\nhave to confess that this is a thought that came long after and not before. I knew there was\ntension between the two parents as mothers, and kids have an intuition about that stuff. But there\nwas something else and that had to do with the fact that clearly my mother -- my mother\u2019s\nfreedom as a mother and a parent, and her freedom as far as objecting to and disagreements, and\n-- | mean to -- to the kinds of disagreements, was severely limited because of the nature of this\nrelationship. We were totally and completely dependent on this family. So my mother must have,\nmany, many times, been severely pressed for patience and understanding and compromise and so\non. There was nothing she could do. I mean, basically her only alternative was to be quiet and\nacquiesce, or to leave. And -- and clearly she surely didn\u2019t want to do that, because there were\nthe two of us also. I don\u2019t know what she would have done if it was just herself. So there was\nprobably no real outlet for all that kind of frustration. Plus the fact that we were getting -- we\nwere getting some letters from my father, and they c -- apparently came from different camps as\nhe was being transported from one to the other, to the other, and then eventually the last |-letters\ncame from Auschwitz. And the letters were always censored. They were alway -- they had\nheavy, heavy black lines drawn through writing, and there was no way -- I remember my mother\nholding them up to the light and putting them over a bright light and on -- so forth and so on.\nThey could not see what was -- what was under that. And they came to us via a very roundabout\nroute, having to do with some of Tante Toos\u2019s family. I don\u2019t know if it was brother or brother-\nin-law, or how we got some of these things, but we did get these letters.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Within context of the system, I think that my mother or parents were only in touch with Tante\nToos. I think that she then did the --",
        "A: -- next steps and so on.\nschool and so on, but the -- to compare that to what must have happened to my sister, 1t must\nhave been so awful, to have everything just kind of collapsed, to have everything just sort of\nliterally having the rug pulled out from under you and now you are in this sort of prison, sort of\nconfinement, really. And then the knowledge that our very lives and futures depended on being\nable to s -- to make the most of what we have here, and to be able to get along, and to be able to\nmake it work. And -- and some of this has been written quite beautifully by Anne Frank, and --\nwhere she talks about some of these dynamics between the rescuer and the protectors, and the\nfamily and the internal stuff. And yeah, there was a lot of that going on.",
        "A: Yeah, I think so --",
        "A: -- it -- certainly the beginnings of one, and I think certainly by the time the three and a half\nyears ended, there was more of it, and I think then, for that one year that we were still there after\nthe war, I think there was more of it, and then some knowledge of -- of some new people her age\nthat she -- his good friend and so forth. I th -- I think that this was really tough. A-And I think\nthere were expectations on her part when we came to America that this might continue and it\ndidn\u2019t and she had sort of no place to go with her feelings. So that -- that was terribly difficult.\nTerribly difficult. And I think that the -- the sense on the part of Tante Toos was very -- I mean, I\nthink she really -- she cared, if not immediately, she certainly came to care for us very deeply.\nAnd -- a-and again, as they say, afterwards, when my mother died, there was a new set of\ntangents, because she felt, I think in a very real sense, that it was her role as the adult maternal\nfigure, to be the caretaker and caregiver. I think my sister felt, as the person closest to me, and\nnow the older, responsible adult, that she should be the one to basically kind of take the initiative\nabout what I should do or not do and what things I might be criticized for or not, as the case may\nbe. So there\u2019s the tension between those two.",
        "A: During much of this time when we were in hiding, again my poor sister was put to the task of\nteaching me, because here I had two weeks of school and no schooling again, so it was her job to\nteach me basic arithmetic and reading and writing and -- and so forth. We -- and she did a great\njob with that, and I\u2019m not sure I could have equaled doing that, cause I must have been a real\npain in the neck to -- to -- to deal with. And there was no television and no VCR and no\ncomputer, and no Gameboy and no, you know, record player, n-no radios, we weren\u2019t allowed to\nhave radios, al-although we did have a radio, it was not permitted. Now again, really another\nexample of -- of this madness and planning. Here you have a -- an occupied population and you\ncut off all their means of getting news from the outside. You tell them they have to turn in all the\nradios. So this -- this clandestine radio virus was already a first move of rejection of these\ndecrees that our host family was part of, because there was -- no one was allowed radios, not just\nJews, no one. And initially there were -- there were beginning to be food shortages after the\nbeginning of this time when we were -- we -- we literally ducked under -- the Dutch word\nonderduiken 1s -- is to duck under, and that\u2019s literally what we were doing. And -- and --",
        "A: Onderduiken means to duck under.",
        "A: We were -- we -- we\u2019re saying onderherduiken, which is we went into hiding, this is how you\nwould translate it --",
        "A: -- but literally translated it is --",
        "A: -- we ducked under. You know, not necessarily what --",
        "A: -- but the fact 1s that we did that. And initially there were ration cards handed out for available\nfood. And of course, instead of three people there were now six people in this house. And so it\nfell to Hans to -- the young boy, to go out and scour up -- I don\u2019t know how, black market,\nwhatever, to go find more ration points, and -- cards. And so he did that reasonably successfully\nuntil there wasn\u2019t any more food that was handed out, and -- and little by little the shops all\nclosed, one after the other, after the other, and had heavy wooden shutters to protect them from\nvandalism and people growing quite desperate for food. And then for awhile they had set up\nsoup kitchens, where you could come with your ration points and get potato peel soup and that\ncame back with Hans and he would -- we would all share that, of course. And -- and even the --\nthe liquor store now was closing, cause there was nothing, there was -- there was no more liquor\nleft for the population and so that -- those doors closed. And there were bottles of colored water\nthat were in the display window and so on. But he would go and -- and occasionally try to dig up\nsomething and apparently came back once with a smoked eel, one eel. And Holland\u2019s specialty\nof course, 1s all versions of fish, of all kinds. Smoked and pickled and you name it. And the one\neel was divided among six people. And the piece that I got was the one that had the head. And\nwhat I didn\u2019t realize is that there was a h-hook in the head, and trying to get every last morsel of\nedible food out of this thing, I got the fishhook stuck in my tongue. And we are now in the\nbasement, right, and I knew somehow, don\u2019t ask me how, that I shouldn\u2019t make a noise, that I\nshouldn\u2019t scream, that I -- and even that spontaneous reaction that you think I would have had,\nwas suppressed. Which probably came from by now having lots of times being told, don\u2019t make\nany noise, you\u2019ve got to keep quiet, you can only whisper, and so on. Because for the first part of\nour hiding, the -- there was activity going on upstairs and there were people in and out of the\nstore. And so we couldn\u2019t really talk, we couldn't really make any noises. And -- and somehow I\nremembered this, and my mother came over and she worked the fishhook out of my mouth and --\nand that was that. But that -- again, how did I know how -- how did I control that impulse? I\ndon\u2019t know, I just did. You sort of wonder often about how it is that you do those things as a\nsmall child, or a big child. I mean, big child I think it\u2019s mo -- it\u2019s a little easier to figure it out.\nWhen you\u2019re a small child, you kind of say, how did that work, you know? What was in my\nhead? And I don\u2019t know what was in my head. I think I just felt it, just felt the whole\natmosphere, the whole -- whole sense of -- everything was dangerous, everything about life was\ndangerous. And so you -- you kept a low profile and you didn\u2019t talk loud and you didn\u2019t scream\nand -- awful really, when you think about the effect of that on a small kid.\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "A: I don\u2019t have a -- any recollection that there was a particular time. I don\u2019t even remember what\nactually transpired in those sessions. I don\u2019t think that they lasted all of the time that we were in\nhiding, but they lasted long enough to get me to be able to read. And -- and I\u2019m sure she did\nsome -- S-See again, we ha -- we had nothing, we ha -- we even had no paper. You couldn\u2019t get\nanything any more. You couldn\u2019t get crayons, you couldn\u2019t get colored -- well, we didn\u2019t really\nhave crayons like they have Crayolas here. We had colored pencils and we had a few because\nwhen the newspapers were still being published -- which also stopped, but while they were being\npublished we didn\u2019t have the comic section like you do here, but we did have one which I\nrecognized later was a political cartoon and -- and it was on the back of the front page of De\nTelegraaf, which was the sort of -- s-sa -- probably right of center newspaper. And I would cut\nout -- after people had gotten through with the paper, I would cut out this little two or three frame\nthing and -- and color it with a few colored pencils that we had and that\u2019s one way I kept busy.\nAnd I loved these characters, I thought they were just so much fun, but again, I was an animal\nlover. And this was tom poes, which was tomcat, and Ollie B. Bommel. And Ollie B. Bommel\nwas a bear, and he was a pretty dumb bear. And so it was always the smart cat who was rescuing\nhim out of awkward situations or correcting his erroneous thinking. And so the political stuff\nkind of came through that. And this was my p-precious possession from -- from all of those\nyears, and it\u2019s one of the few things that I had at the end of the war, cause I collected all these\nthings until they stopped publishing, and I took them with me to America, and I kept them in the\nattic and so forth and so on, and then at some later date many years later when I met my husband\nand he came to visit at the house and so forth, and I told him about this. And he said, \u201cOh,\u201d he\nsaid, \u201cdo you have those around?\u201d I said oh yeah, and so I brought them down from the attic, and\nhe opened the box and he grabbed them and the first thing he did was flip them over on the other\nside, because there were the headlines of what was going on during those early years. And I\nhaven\u2019t tried to piece those headlines together, but I have started to do some research now on --\nactually on the original newspapers, to see what was the context within which all of my personal\nexperience was taking place.",
        "A: Because now, as an adult, I\u2019m interested in knowing -- a-and not only interested in knowing,\nbut I\u2019m so appalled at some of the things that you keep seeing repeated and repeated and\nrepeated in history. Not the least of which was these kinds of left, right and so forth debates\nabout how to interpret what the Nazis were doing, and so I actually have been looking at some of\nthe newspapers on the left, and some of them on the right and some of the underground\nnewspapers which were being published. And some of that has proven to be very interesting --\nvery interesting to read.",
        "A: During these years?",
        "A: Well, I --",
        "A: It -- it\u2019s a very hard question to answer because on the one hand I must have been, but on the\nother hand I don\u2019t remember it. Now one thing that I remember doing, I -- I know that because of\nthe severely confined circumstances in which we were, and if you remember, I mentioned the\nfact that these people were not very well off in this little daytime place for -- for the proprietors\nof the -- of the shop, th -- but the shop was part of the Chrispijn liquor store chain. It was a big,\nwell-known company, and -- and Tante Toos was the proprietress of this -- this particular one\nstore. But part of what -- what was also very difficult is that because it was only meant for\ndaytime habitation, there was only a little half bathroom. There was only a toilet with a little\nteeny sink, just enough to wash your hands, as most toilet rooms are in -- in Europe. An-And\nthere was no shower, and there was no bathtub. So matters of hygiene had to be taken care of\nrather differently, in basins and lots of hand washing and so on. And lots of washing, I mean.\nAnd also, I think what was -- I mean, this actually took time, I mean you had to carry water in\nbasins and bring it downstairs and so on. And I remember my mother 1-in very short order,\ndecided I had to cut my -- or she was going to cut my long hair, cause I had long pigtails. And I\nremember not being very happy about that, but there wasn\u2019t any question, it wasn\u2019t do we have\nto, it was just -- it was done. Because she saw no way to keep washing hair in this difficult,\nconfined situation. The other thing that happened during this time is when I learned to read, I\nfound that Hans, our gentle, young man in the house, probably the only thing the guy owned was\na set of books that was in his part of the cellar, which had been curtained off, and it was on a\nshelf in his part of the cellar. It was a series of books about the American Indians, about the\nApaches in particular. And it was a series written by what I understand is an Austrian author,\nwho apparently never set foot in the States, and I understand has done amazingly accurate\nwritings and portraits of what went on among the Apaches. And I devoured those books,\nprobably --",
        "A: Yes --",
        "A: Exactly, Karl May, and -- and the -- the image in my mind was always of this proud,\ncourageous American Indian, of course, the Apache. And I just read those books over and over\nand over again. There wasn\u2019t anything else, there was no paper, there were no magazines. There\nwas not a collection of children\u2019s books in the house. There was not -- there were very few books\nof any kind around the house. So this series, this whole series was just, you know, very precious\nto me, and -- and I spent a lot of time reading that.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yeah. Probably seven.",
        "A: Right. And they were big, thick, wonderful books. Yeah.",
        "A: In the beginning, I-I think I mentioned we could go outside a little bit and that -- but that\nstopped within weeks. And then we had to stay downstairs certainly all day. And in the evening\nwhen it was really good and dark, we would come upstairs and spend some time upstairs, usually\nhuddled around this clandestine radio, or as -- in fact, I seem to remember that we did not eat\nupstairs, so -- and -- and speaking of the eating as -- I think I was telling you about the potato\npeel soup. You know, after that -- after that stopped, there was nothing. There was absolutely\nnothing, and everything was shuttered and everything was a ghost town, all the stores were\ncompletely shuttered down with wooden protection shutters and so on. And -- and we heard\nstories about people doing all kinds of desperate things, you know, hunting down pets that\nbelonged to somebody [indecipherable] or something, in the streets, and -- and going out to the\ncountry to try to find rabbits and so on. And another element of my parent\u2019s planning for this\npossible eventuality came in the sense that aside from the beds that I saw there, and the quilts\nthat I saw there, when I came upstairs one day and saw also this set of dishes that I mentioned\nbefore, there were, next to the set of dishes were bags, large bags of staples. Just the way you\nfind them in a natural food store, they were sacks of raw beans and peas and -- and barley and\nrice and -- I don\u2019t remember specifically which ones, but ther -- there were all these staples,\nwhich really saved all of our lives, because I was fr -- I-I was quite stunned, actually, to read in\none of the papers I had been looking at, that they figured that some -- something between 1700\nand 2500 people died simply of starvation in the city. And we were just very fortunate to have\nhad this that we could then share with our family. Which -- which certainly saved us. But then\nthat ran out, and that was still -- the war was still on. Also my -- my mother was a bit of a --\nprobably natural food type vitamin person and she had had -- also saved and put aside vitamins\nand -- and especially calcium pills, which -- I -- I -- I -- I\u2019ve had rather troubles with teeth, which\nare thought to have had some basis in the war deprivation. But that -- that was part of what was\nthere, and then when that ran out, then also electricity was out, gas was out, so you had nothing\nto cook on, you had n-no lights. There was -- for awhile there was wood for the woodstove, the\ncoal stove, 1 -- of course, coal was long gone -- in the living room, but then Hans would go out to\nthe countryside and -- and dig peat, blocks of peat that he would really, literally drag back to --\nu-undercover at night. And then after that, a-and there was no more food, he went out in the\nfields and dug up sugar beets and tulip bulbs, which we basically ground into some kind of\nmush, and tried to cook, as long as we had anything to cook on. And -- and that\u2019s how we\nsurvived during -- during this time. It was horrible stuff, but 1t was what kept us going.",
        "A: There is no kitchen in the basement, right.",
        "A: No, I believe Tante Toos did.",
        "A: At some --",
        "A: I believe we ate downstairs most of the time. Certainly in the beginning and I think later on\nwhen the store was actually closed, and if we ate later we were upstairs, gen -- it was dark. Now,\nthe store, I have to also indicate to you, the store\u2019s display window was maybe at, you know, this\nchair height.",
        "A: And ran in sort of a semi-circle from let\u2019s say the length of this room wall, and extended back\nmaybe three feet or so. And then starting at the height of the display window were mirrors\nembedded into a wooden screening. In other words, it was wood to the house side, and it was m-\nmirror to the street side, so that all these bottles were mirrored in -- and when you walked by you\nsaw this profusion of bottles and so on. But this wall of mirrors only came up to about five feet,\nso you could look over it and see people, and see into the living quarters in the back. So there\nwas never any movement above that height, or in the back of the house during the daytime. And\nat night it was only by -- by being lower than those things in the back or having the lights off --\nonce the lights were off anyway because there was no electricity, it was a little bit easier for us to\nmove around. But that\u2019s also when we were having these terrible street searches and house\nsearches, where these Gestapo would be patrolling and -- at random, or based on some word that\nthey got from somebody, would actually go and do a house search. You know, tear the place\napart, and --",
        "A: Several times, actually, and when the worry about this became so great that we were afraid to\nbe in the cellar -- again, I don\u2019t know whose idea it was, I don\u2019t know how the grown-ups\nplanned this and talked about it, but it was decided that we should hide under this display\nwindow in this three foot wide stretch that was under -- that -- that was, you know, probably\nthree feet off the ground and three feet wide, but maybe 10 or 18 feet long. I don\u2019t know how\nlong, 18 feet maybe. And there was a little door in the store side to this, and the little door could\nopen up and then they usu -- usually they kept cases of empty bottles there, or beer -- extra beer\nsupplies, or whatever. So what they did is they took those bottles and crates out of there, we\nwould go in there at night and they would put the empty crates back behind us and then close the\ndoor. So the three of us would be in there, and on the street side it was just a -- you saw brick up\nuntil the level of the display window, and there were two little grates where you could get some\nair in this part, and my recollection was always that we were either hunched over, or somehow in\nsome, you know, very uncomfortable position, cause there were three of us in this tiny space.\nAnd that one of us was always sort of on the alert that no one else would make noise. I know my\nguess 1s that my mother was always on the alert. Because the noises, the breathing, the sneezing,\nwhat have you, the snoring, could be heard through these vents outside. And you never knew if\nsomebody was actually patrolling the streets, or was out on the street and being silent because\nthey were waiting to catch you, or waiting to have -- to be able to observe one misstep, based on\nsome, you know, intuition they might have had. So you never knew whom to trust, you never\nknew what was going on, you never had -- you always had this sense of watchfulness, of -- and -\n- and I\u2019m sure that that was part of the anxiety, was probably watchfulness that I was feeling on\nthe part of the adults. And -- and we spent a lot of time in there, and it was a good thing because\nsome of those searches did, in fact, th -- the soldiers went into the basement. It was a logical\nthing, there was a door. I mean, you know, they would have been stupid not to open that door.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, because I don\u2019t remember --",
        "A: -- if they did anything about those beds when we weren\u2019t in them. Whether they had some\nexplanation, like you know, so -- if -- if Hans\u2019s friends stayed over --",
        "A: -- I -- I have no idea.",
        "A: No, I can\u2019t answer that.",

        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, and I remember having to duck down so that we wouldn\u2019t be seen, and of\ncourse we had to go into the store proper, and walk from the back of -- of --",
        "A: -- of the store, which you could see when -- because you could look over this mirrored thing -",
        "A: -- and get to that little entryway which was right below the mirrors. So we basically had to\nkind of keep -- duck out of sight and get in there.",
        "A: So I do remember that very distinctly. And I also remember that -- that several things then\nhappen as the war got worse and worse. And I remember sitting in the dark and huddled around\nthe -- the radio, and sitting by moonlight, and -- and I remember listening to the BBC, and I\nremember, you know, occasionally hearing something from the queen, and then hearing\nsomething from Churchill. And I also began to recognize, even as a child, that somehow I made\nthe deduction that if you heard the words Churchill and Montgomery and Eisenhower and\nRoosevelt that things were going better, and the adults seemed somewhat less anxious. And if\nyou heard Hitler and Himmler and Goebbels and -- I could always -- I knew that they were going\nto be tense and upset. And -- and we did hear, actually, a fair amount of bombing, although\nAmsterdam was not flattened the way Rotterdam was. There were certainly constantly air raids\nand sirens and planes flying overhead and some areas were bombed because the -- I know some\npart of the hospital was bombed, and I know the hospital had -- and the reason I know that,\nbecause after the war I became very ill, and I had to go to that hospital. But -- but during this\ntime, there is that well documented difference in the way the allied planes sounded from the way\nthe axis planes sounded, that -- the Nazi planes. And I remember the first time going to some\nfilm that had that in it, that -- that sort of unnerved me because there it was, there were those\nsounds that I remembered.",
        "A: The -- the German planes were all sort of loud and sputtering and the motor sounds, probably\nwithout any mufflers and things like that. And also the nature of whatever the make was. And the\nMesserschmitts I think were some of those fighter planes that were always very noisy. And allied\nplanes had a sort of low, humming sound. Now this may have had to do both with the motor\ndesign and also with the altitude at which they flew, I don\u2019t know. But boy, did we know it. But\nthe end result often was the same in that you had to go into air -- air raid shelters, which we, of\ncourse, didn\u2019t. But the sirens would go off for that [indecipherable]",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Not in the courtyard, and probably not within view of any of the windows. I remember sort of\n-- the one side of the room had this little stove, so it\u2019s not likely we were sitting there, and it was\nsomewhere in the wall area, or near the wall area that separated the kitchen from the living area\nsomehow -- it was not in full view of that courtyard, no.",
        "A: Right. I don\u2019t remember about the bathroom. I really don\u2019t remember about the bathroom. I\njust don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: I never asked her.",
        "A: I never asked her. I didn\u2019t think about it, actually, until many, many years after that. But then\nsomehow it\u2019s not come up 1n the several times that we\u2019ve -- but yeah, there were those --",

        "A: A total blank. Yeah, the -- and the hygiene involved in all that must have been exceedingly\ndifficult, exceeding -- I -- I do have some vague recollection of my mother cooking big pots of\nwater on the stove, as long as we had the gas going, and washing clothes in the -- and bringing\nthat hot water downstairs and washing clothes.",

        "A: He very much was, yeah, and I -- I guess one of the big, enormous differences of course in --\nin these situations, you -- you sort of think of your -- you know, sort of average teenager in -- in\nAmerica, in this land of -- of plenty and more than plenty, and you think about kids who, you\nknow, don\u2019t really seem to behave in a very mature way. And how is that these kids did? Well, I\nthink one big difference is the fact that this was for real. This wasn\u2019t any fun and games. And I\nthink that kids grow up very fast under demand of -- of survival. And I think that -- I -- I think\nthat you, on the one hand, have to have some ability to be resilient, but at the same time, you\nhave to have some judgment about what needs to be done in these situations, and being\nirresponsible just doesn\u2019t have a place here, although I have to say, I remember being -- having --\ncoming down with a cold or something like that, and -- and my sister bringing me a cup of tea,\nand I -- and a thermometer, and telling me to take my temperature, and I thought, oh this is hot\ntea, it might be fun to see what the temperature of the tea is. I stuck the thermometer in the tea\nand it promptly exploded, the mercury all over the place, and I was, you know, not in anybody\u2019s\ngood graces, cause there were no stores where you could get a new one, so that was it, the\nthermometer was gone. Had I thought it would explode I\u2019m sure I wouldn\u2019t have done it, but I\ndidn\u2019t know. And I thought, I wonder how hot the tea 1s.",
        "A: Certainly didn\u2019t know that.",
        "A: I certainly didn\u2019t know that. You know, so that was a -- those were all very big issues, which\nsomehow in the overall scheme of things have either been suppressed or lost in my mind because\nthey didn\u2019t register, or -- somehow. And it\u2019s kind of interesting to ask yourself, why did this\nexperience register versus some other experience. And it\u2019s been very interesting in talking about\nthis too, is what suddenly triggers another bunch of memories, you know?",
        "A: Exactly.\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "A: Seeing them?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember exactly. I don\u2019t know whether she did initially and then stopped, or whether\nshe kind of summarized the letter, or gave -- and I don\u2019t know if she read some to my sister, and\nsome to me. I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: I -- I\u2019m sure it did. I- I don\u2019t remember being conscious of a shift in relationship, but -- but\nthen again, you know, even under natural circumstances, as you get older and change your\nbehavior and so forth, your relationship with your parent changes.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure that the proximity added a good deal to it. And I didn\u2019t mean to paint some of the\nearly years as necessarily negative, cause I have other r-recollections of, you know, of be --\nbeing -- playing out in a field with her or something, or -- in fact, I have some little pictures of\nme as a toddler playing in the Vondelpark, you know, the big park in Amsterdam.",
        "A: I -- I guess as a small child the negatives outweighed the positives because perhaps I took for\ngranted all the positives and only remembered those things that she said no, I couldn\u2019t touch the\nhorse, and you know, don\u2019t get close to the horse cause he might kick you and so forth. And so\nthat was where my will was being thwarted in a sense, and so maybe that\u2019s why I remember that.\nNo, I remember -- and I remember -- I remember her death, unfortunately, very, very well,\nbecause I shared the bed with her, and she died in her sleep.",
        "A: She wasn\u2019t sick, and I remember that what I was told, or what maybe others were told or\nothers talked about, they kept saying that she dri -- died of a broken heart, given what was\nhappening to my father and so on. But what I\u2019m surmising now is that she probably died of a\nstroke.",
        "A: It was awful. It was awful.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember what I did. I -- I really don\u2019t remember what I did.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I-I have no recollection of what I did immediately upon sensing -- upon\nwaking and sensing that she was not in her natural state. I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: I\u2019m guessing that she was in her early 50\u2019s, only because I was eight by then, and I think she\nhad me in her late 40\u2019s --",
        "A: -- but, like, you know, if she was -- well, mid-40\u2019s, so -- I -- I -- I don\u2019t know. I should\nactually figure that out because I -- I looked up her birthdate at some point, she was in August. I\ndon\u2019t know how old she was.",
        "A: She was ol -- she was -- must have been born in 1896 now that I think about it, because my\nuncle was born in 1900, and she was the oldest, and then I think he was the middle, and then\nthere was another sister. And the other sister, in fact, I found all this material after -- after my\naunt died. I found a trunk of material in the garage, which was all of the correspondence that they\nhad had, and my uncle particularly had had over -- since he came to America, first of all,\napparently trying to get his parents out of Vienna and appealing to the em -- embassy about\ngetting his parents out of danger, and writing to them about the fact that he had come in 1930\nwhatever, and he was now able to take care of himself and his -- hi wa -- had brought his wife\nover and had a good job and so forth, and that he would vouch for them and take care of them,\nthat they would not be a burden on the welfare system and so forth. And that letter that came\nback was a letter from some state department person saying -- 1t was almost -- it was almost a\nlittle sharp, maybe wasn't meant that way, but it was sort of like we\u2019re glad that you -- that you\nare a-able to take care of yourself, and -- and self-sufficient and so forth and so on, but that does\nnot give you any special privileges. It does not push you ahead of the line of getting people into\nthe country. And then there were letters from ha -- my other aunt, who had apparently hoped to\nget to -- I think to South America and ended up in -- in Cuba, I think in Havana for awhile,\nbefore she was able to get to America. And my aunt -- and letters that my uncle and aunt sent to\neach other when she was still in Vienna and she stayed behind because she was trying to get\nvisas f -- to get her parents and her s -- older sister out to Australia, and all -- and also a meisje, a\nyoung woman who worked for them and who had been like their governess and so on. And she\nsucceeded in doing that, and some of the stories she told about how she did this, how she stood\nin line day after day after day to try to convince the authorities that they should give her these\nvisa for her parents. How she -- she told the stories about some young guy who was really very\nsweet on her, but she didn\u2019t care about him, and he turned out to be one of the soldiers guarding\nthe line of people standing in line for these visas, and how she kind of maneuvered her way\ntowards the front of the line in terms of this guy, who was now a Nazi, and who made no bones\nabout it. But still was kind of interested in her, and I guess allowed her a couple of notches up the\nline. And she described to me a couple of times, unfortunately I never got it down, as to what it\nwas like when she went into this enormous room where this Nazi commandant was, and where\nshe had to plead for these visa and exit permits and so forth. And immediately she was addressed\nas a Jewess, and -- and in German she quoted to me what he said to her, you know, what -- what\ndoes this Jewish -- Jewess want, kind of thing, and -- she was an amazing woman, just a gutsy\nlady with -- with, you know, just a sort of indomitable spirit that I hope all of us can have a piece\nof, but --",
        "A: -- and she was -- then -- then she got them out. Her brother, who had been in medical school -\n- in fact, she had wanted to go to medical school, but her father, who had once been quite well-\nto-do, apparently had lost a lot of money and when she, who was older, started medical school,\nand then her brother came along, he said I\u2019m sorry, I only have money for one person to go to\nmedical school, and he yanked her out and he put him in. But she loved this brother, she -- she\nwould do anything for this brother. In fact, she used to tell me how -- how she got him to play\nthe -- the moonlights -- Beethoven\u2019s \u201cMoonlight Sonata\u201d by promising him a little money when\nhe was a student and he had no money. And then she went -- she became a clothes designer and\nseamstress, and she had this apparently lovely atelier in Vienna, where she designed clothing for\nthe opera, and for the stage and so on. And anyway, her f -- her brother married a young Dutch\nwoman who turned out to have been the daughter of the leading communist in Holland. So he\nemigrated to Russia. And when they got to Russia, he was promptly jailed because he was a Jew,\nand she was jailed because she was foreigner. So they were shipped off to Siberia, because they\nwere both doctors, medical doctors and they needed them. So they were saved because of -- of\nbeing doctors, and they were paid in bags of potatoes, basically, for their services. And he was in\n-- h-he was imprisoned and everything, he was ter -- a terrible life. Terrible li -- I mean, those are\nall the side pieces of the main pieces that --",
        "A: -- that happened here. Was just incredible. And -- and I remember my aunt telling me the\nstory of how she -- she had gotten her family out and then she had an elderly uncle that she was\ntaking care of, and he was really in terminal illness at this point in time. I think in -- but he had\nbeen a single uncle who had gone to America, and had come back and brought them things and\nso forth, and she -- very much loved in the family and she didn\u2019t want to abandon him, so she\ntook care of him until he died. And this was either a year and a half or two years later, so was\nmuch harder for her to get out. And she took the last -- she used to tell the story of going home to\nher apartment and boiling some potatoes and her girlfriend said to her, you know, if I had a\nhusband waiting for me in the United States, I wouldn\u2019t wait for the potatoes to boil. And she\ngrabbed her purse, and she said she walked out the door, and she got on the -- what turned out to\nbe the last train going to the border between Germany and Holland. And they had to get off the\ntrain, and she said, and the soldiers were directly behind them. And she said she w-w-walked\nvery quickly to where the railroad fencing was, and she said and then the Dutch people were\nthere, and they literally pulled her under the fence so the -- the soldiers couldn\u2019t get her. And she\nsaid then they were there with -- with hot coffee and -- and stuff, and helped people. And then\nshe got to Amsterdam and so forth, and saw my folks and saw me, I guess, when I was two and a\nhalf or something, and -- maybe a little older. And then she went to America, and then my uncle,\nwho was -- who was both a physicist and an electrical and mechanical engineer, had gone to -- to\nAmerica, wasn\u2019t allowed to take any money out, was apparently, so the story goes, in Grand\nCentral, and pulled a -- an old New York Times out of the wastebasket cause he didn\u2019t have any\nmoney, and saw that there were jobs for physicists and optical engineers and so on in Rochester,\nNew York. So then apparently wrote, and so forth and so on, was interviewed and got a job and -\n- and that\u2019s how he move o -- that\u2019s how he came to Rochester.",
        "A: That\u2019s my mother\u2019s brother.",
        "A: And he was -- I believe that he was the middle child, so -- and he was born in 1900, so that\nmakes -- I think my mother was four years older than he. So --",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, this is -- a-again, I -- a-a-actually it\u2019s the second time -- I'll have to tell you about the\nfirst time -- it\u2019s the second time that the -- that the adults -- and I don\u2019t know whether anybody in\nthe family knew him, but they took this person, this other Dutch person into their confidence and\ntold him what happened, and it was a doctor. And I don\u2019t know if it was the family doctor, or if it\nwas a doctor who was referred to them, or whether Tante Toos\u2019s brothers knew somebody who\nwould do this. In any case, this doctor came sometime in the evening or in the middle of the\nnight and took my mother\u2019s body out of the house and saw to it that she was buried. And in fact,\nat some point in time when I was back in Holland, I went to see him, he was still in practice at\nthe time, and I -- I wanted to express to him our thanks for not only doing that, but for not\nturning us in. And he -- he acknowledged my thanks, but he seemed very uncomfortable and\ndidn\u2019t -- seemed sort of aloof, and I don\u2019t know if he didn\u2019t want to remember this awful time, or\nwhether he in fact suffered because of it. I -- I -- I don\u2019t know what the reason was, but he was --\nhe -- he kept very much apart from -- you know, it was the very, sort of professional demeanor\nthat he showed. That was the second time, as I said. The first time we took somebody in our\nconfidence was as the war wore on, and the Germans were beginning to realize it -- that their lot\nwas going to likely be up, and they made their last ditch efforts. They were running short of\nsoldiers, so they took all the soldiers who were doing the domestic duties in these occupied\ncountries and put them in the front, 1-1-in the war front, and they replaced them by drafting the\nDutch boys. And now, our Hans is, of course, draft bait. So it became a matter of hiding him as\nwell. And so four of us couldn\u2019t get into this little -- under the display window thing. And so\nnow -- I don\u2019t know in my description if I made it clear, but we had, between the room where\nthis alcove bed was, and the kitchen, was a little teeny hallway, and there was a hallway on one\nside and on the other side was the half-bath. And over this hallway and half bath was a low\nceiling. But it f -- that low ceiling formed a kind of alcove in the kitchen area. And the kitchen\nceiling was very high and kind of extended over that alcove. So what they did is they brought\nsomebody in, a carpenter, who made a false wall for this whole upper alcove area. And he did it\nwith -- with wooden battens, so that it looked like it was part of a -- an existing wall. And one\nsquare with battens was left out, so that that provided the entrance, so we would get on a ladder\nat night and crawl in there, all of use including Hans, and we would leave this square off until\nsomebody gave us the high sign that we better put it on. But here there were -- there was no air\nintake at all, th -- if we put that thing there, w-we were totally without any -- never mind air\nflow, but -- but would have -- would have died of suffocation had we had to spend any long time\nthere. And -- and so we spent all the rest of our nights in the -- in the -- in the last parts -- years\nof the war, there.",
        "A: Initially, yeah.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: Yes, I went -- I went back to see the grave.",
        "A: There is a real grave.",
        "A: Yes. Now, I don\u2019t know if my aunt and uncle took care of that part. I don\u2019t know if they had\nher reburied, I don\u2019t know if she was originally buried right there but not marked. I don\u2019t know. I\nknow that they gave money for her care, for the care of the grave in perpetuity because they did\ntell me that at some point.\ncan investigate it at some point, is there some connection between getting that letter, and her f --\nrealizing what Auschwitz was, which you wouldn\u2019t have known, but maybe she did. And --",
        "A: I can\u2019t believe that she didn\u2019t know what Auschwitz -- which -- what Auschwitz meant then.",
        "A: She did, and I think what you\u2019re sort of implying is was this finally her real confrontation\nwith the meaning and what this meant for her husband, which is very possible, and -- and -- and\nthen the reason it may be possible 1s because the -- the -- when she died and -- and the adults, the\nremaining adults in the family said she died of a broken heart. Y-You may be onto something,\nthat that\u2019s in fact -- did create some kind of emotional stress, physical reaction, I-I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I-I know that she was very, very distressed with the last -- I don\u2019t know if it was a letter or\nletters. But -- but it was very clear to me that there was a progression of news that got worse each\ntime.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t know if it was actually what was in the letter, or whether it was the postmarks on\nthe letter, because I don\u2019t think they let anything stay in the letter that was of any use.",
        "A: Or -- or any news. And the other thing that -- I -- I know that even papers, radio, whatever\nnotwithstanding, I know that there was a lot information that we got by word of mouth that was\nbeing -- for example the fact that after we went into hiding and the round-ups continued, we -- I\nknow that we got word of the fact that all my father\u2019s family was wiped out. He had five\nbrothers, each of whom had families and children and wives, and we got word of the fact that\nthey had all been deported, and everybody knew -- seemed to know what that meant. I didn\u2019t, but\nI knew that they knew. They got word of the fact that my grandmother, her husband had died\nbefore we went into hiding, and I remember my grandmother at our house, sitting Shiva in a\nblack -- black dress and -- and on a wooden bench and -- and so forth. So I knew what that meant\nlong before I knew any connection to Judaism or anything. But I knew that she was in mourning.\nAnd I spoke a little German for those early years, I must have been three years old at the time.\nBut then she was in a nursing home when we went into hiding. And the word came back to us\nthat -- th-that there had been a round-up of that nursing home, that the trucks had just pulled up\nin front, that they threw people out the doors and out the verandas like so many chickens going\nto slaughter. I know we heard that, cause I heard that then.",
        "A: And so I -- In -- I-I don\u2019t think that there was -- that -- that\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard to listen to\npeople saying that they didn\u2019t know what was going on in that time. I th -- I think you -- you\ncouldn\u2019t help but know what was going on. And -- and some of the p -- some of the writers who\nhave written about these experiences also -- partly you knew what was going on because there\nwas -- there was the knowledge that happened in the east. You knew about the -- you know, they\n-- they pr -- they were first perhaps not extermination camps, but you knew that people were put\nto death. And th -- and this -- this came up in this film about Dachau for example, what people\nsaid, th-the residents said, well this was not -- this was not an extermination camp. Well the --\nsome of the first efforts of extermination were done in Dachau. And I -- I\u2019d -- I know there\nwasn\u2019t television and so forth, but th -- but people knew, people knew. And -- and America\nknew. America knew. And -- and again, in David Wyman\u2019s book, that\u2019s all documented line by\nline, what they knew. That just wasn\u2019t expedient to get involved. Just wasn\u2019t where they wanted\nto go at that time. But it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t -- I-I -- I don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t know what you do\nabout that, you know, I didn\u2019t -- I -- I mean here and now -- and this -- when you see these\nparallels of which is so horrible when you see the European nations apologizing to the Bosnians\nabout the fact that they didn\u2019t act when they should have to stop that bloodshed. W-W-Why\ndon\u2019t we do that? Why do we -- why don\u2019t we take action about values that are right and wrong\ninstead of well, you know, you have to play the political game, and I -- I think I used to be a\nwhole lot more optimistic than I am now, but I think when the whole Bosnian crisis broke, I just\n-- | -- ] felt as if the bottom had g-gone out from under my stomach, and I just kind of felt -- w-\nw-we just aren\u2019t going anywhere. I mean, how these families that could -- that intermarried,\nthese families that were neighbors and friends. You get the right manipulator out there doing the\nright PR stuff, and everybody loses everything that they supposedly claim is -- is what they\nbelieve. It\u2019s very hard. It\u2019s very hard to accept that. And -- and I think the -- I think when I first\ncame here, of course, people asked me all kinds of questions. I was still a little kid when I came,\nI mean when ha -- when the war ended, of course, there was such a sense of -- a-again, what did I\nas a child know? It\u2019s very difficult to know. I knew that we were being liberated. I knew that\nfreedom was once again back in Holland, and I knew what it meant for me. I knew that I could\nrun in the street, I knew I could open the door, I knew I could talk in a regular voice. I knew that\nI could find friends to play with on the street, and I did. There was a child across the street who -\n- whose father was also a baker, but an only child who was a year older than I, and we -- we\nneither of us knew about each other for -- for nearly three and a half years here. And -- and I\nwent to school, and she and I walked to school, and I had that life that had been on hold, that I\nhad been waiting for as a small child. And then about December, I got very sick. I had bronchitis,\nI had pneumonia, I had whooping cough. I had -- I\u2019ve forgotten, something else.",
        "A: All together at the same time. I was really very sick and they finally took me and put me in\nthe hospital. And I was on a ward, a huge room that was just filled with cribs, mostly infants and\ntoddlers, I was the oldest child by far on that floor, because most kids my age, I guess, wouldn\u2019t\nhave gotten whooping cough. And it\u2019s kind of funny because I don\u2019t know whether I missed\ngetting vaccinated or whether that\u2019s not a hundred percent foolproof. But I was so sick they\nweren't sure I was going to make it. And I certainly wasn\u2019t sure I was going to make it, although\nI don\u2019t know what that meant in my child\u2019s mind. But every night there would be children\ncarried -- dead children carried out of these cribs and I would see this around me all day long and\nall night long. I mean, that was a huge ward just -- just lined up crib after crib after crib. And you\nwould hear these babies convulsing and coughing, as I was also. And then not be able to breathe,\nand die. And I was in the hospital about three months, or at least I was sick for a very long time.\nAnd during this time there was some -- some effort made at -- at ca -- well, actually the effort\nmade to contact us ha-happened be -- prior to the time I got sick. But during -- but backtracking a\nlittle bit to the -- to the freedom thing, I remember the feeling of freedom. I remember being able\nto throw open the door and running down the street to this street we were trying to find, the\nHooftweg, which means basically, the headway. And running along with every citizen who could\nwalk or crawl, to line those streets to welcome the allied troops.",
        "A: And you know, the joy, it -- it\u2019s -- on one of the pages of that newspaper e -- edition that I\ngave you, everybody who was anybody, as I say, who could get there, was there on the street.\nAnd the -- and the soldiers, mostly actually Canadian and British, not too many U.S., threw\ncandy in the crowds and stockings for the girls and the cheering went on and on and on, and I\ndon\u2019t know if I knew what I was doing and exactly what it meant to me at that time, except this\nincredible sense of freedom, just -- just physically feeling it.",
        "A: True, true, but that I could really feel that and participate in this -- it was incredible.\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember fear as an emotion at all during this time, other than this constant anxiety\nkind of thing that something is going to happen and I don\u2019t know what that something is, which\nis why we have to be quiet and so forth, and that\u2019s why we can\u2019t be seen. I hadn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t --\ndon\u2019t think, at least I don\u2019t remember, personally thinking about what\u2019s going to happen to us\nnow. I didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know if I was just so young it didn\u2019t occur to me that this might be an\nissue. Whether my sister thought something else, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: And there was certainly some change and shift in the dynamic now, because now Tante Toos\nfeels even more responsible for -- for us -- for both of us, and for me in particular, I think, and\nmy sister felt that she needed to rise to the occasion, because she was the -- the -- the next, the\nclosest relative.",
        "A: And therefore she felt she needed to act in this mature, responsible way and -- and set the\nlimits for me and do all those kinds of things. And sometimes they clashed, and I was aware of\nthat. And I think this was very hard for both. I\u2019m sure it was difficult for this adult who had done\nall this for us and -- and so on, and -- and then therefore probably had occasional mixed feelings.\nAnd that was very hard for my sister, who must have had to walk a thin line between also being a\nchild, but also being the one that felt dutifully responsible for me, and -- and how to behave in a\nway that was not ungrateful, and yet try to put her perspective out there.",
        "A: A-And I -- and this must have been extremely difficult. I-I certainly was aware of it, but I\ndon\u2019t remember specifics.",
        "A: Is -- it\u2019s pretty much a blur. I don\u2019t remember -- as I say, the -- when you\u2019re asking me about\nmemory, I don\u2019t remember there being a mourning period. I don\u2019t remember there being a time\nthat was different from another time except my mother wasn\u2019t present. I-I don\u2019t remember any\nmarkers, or any things that I can hitch any kind of response to.",
        "A: Just don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Well, the things get worse in the sense that we now have, as they say, we\u2019ve gone through all\nof the food, all of our supplies, there is nothing H-Hans can\u2019t really go out in the country any\nmore, because th -- he runs the danger --",
        "A: -- of getting picked up, so yeah, I think I was a total of -- ve forgotten how many pounds,\nbut I was one very skinny little kid at the end of the war, and I suppose probably when you ask\nme did the fish hook thing cause an infection, it\u2019s probably quite a miracle that it didn\u2019t. But I\nsort of made up for it by being so very sick at that time.",
        "A: And -- and my sister, who was trying to run around and -- and take care of the bureaucracy\nstuff while I was in the hospital, and getting passports, and papers signed, and so forth, broke out\ninto the -- first of all, she had terrible, terrible stomach problems right after the war, and I\u2019m sure\nthat they had to do with -- well, I\u2019m not sure, but I think they had to do with all this suppressed\nanxiety and fear, and trying to walk this delicate line between things. And she had -- I remember\nhaving terrible, she had terrible, terrible cramp attacks, and I remember being dispatched to go\ndown to the Hooftweg, to this [indecipherable] and -- and trying to find the open -- the only one\npharmacy that was still open, and get her Valerian, I remember Valerian drops. Valerian I guess\nis still occasionally used, but it\u2019s some kind of -- it has some sort of sedative reaction on the\nmuscles of the stomach and so on. And I remember when I got so sick and sh -- and I was in the\nhospital -- in fact, I had my 10\" birthday in the hospital, I remember this. And I remember this\nnew little friend I had made from across the street, I remember her not being allowed into the\nward, and there were some glass doors at one side at sort of roughly the same level where I was,\nexcept I was way into the center of the ward. And she was -- this is February now, she\u2019s looking\nat -- and her face pressed against the door, holding up a sign, happy birthday, and so forth,\ncoming to see me. But my sister had these terrible, what probably were staph infections, just\nthese running sores and one terrible one on her -- on the top of her foot and she couldn\u2019t get a\nshoe on, and she had to keep going and she had the shoemaker cut out some hunk of the shoe\nleather for her, so that she could continue to -- to go about her business and so on. Because by\nthis time in that -- immediately after the war, the first thing that --that we got right after the war,\nafter we had this incredible jubilation on the Hooftweg, was that everybody hauled out their\nclandestine radios and their record players and their hidden Dutch flags, and the orange\nstreamers for the House of Orange, and o -- suddenly this stuff came out of nowhere, and we had\nthree day block parties, essentially, the whole city that I remember, everywhere there were\nloudspeakers running, music, and there was dancing in the street and there was just unbridled\njoy. And the only people who were not unbridled in their joy were those -- especially the woman\nwho were known to have consorted with the Nazi soldiers. And they were rounded up and shorn\nin public and ended up having to wear scarves over their heads to hide their shame, and so on.\nThat was pretty awful.",
        "A: Yeah, I did see it. I did see that. But there was this just -- this incredible, you know, there\u2019s --\nthere\u2019s n -- there are no words to describe this sense of freedom and this jubilation that took\nplace during this liberation time. And of course now we were seeing army uniforms and -- and --\nand the allied soldiers who were headquartered wherever they were, and -- and the soldiers were\n-- were walking the streets and my girlfriend and I had a little tiny pad each, because there was\nstill not stuff in the stores, they were still basically shuttered. And the two words of English --\nactually, I knew three by the time I came to this country, but the first two words I learned were\nsignature please. And it -- we invented this activity, we would go to a soldier and hand him this\npad an-and little stubby pencil and ask for his signature. And I still have those too, someplace.",
        "A: Little pad of signatures, even some X\u2019s where they didn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t obviously write. And\nagain, mostly British and Canadians. And I remember that the other one was candy and please.\nSo we would give them, we\u2019d ask for their signature and then we would ask for candy, please.\nBecause, of course, they had thrown the stuff from the --",
        "A: -- trucks as they came through, on the tanks and so on. And -- and there was this great loving,\nand -- and -- and rejoicing and -- and great love for the Americans and British and everyone. And\nthen w-we had -- we had these block parties, but we had them -- we -- I seem to remember that\nwe had three big ones in -- in fairly rapid succession, like with -- within two or three weeks there\nwas another one, and then there was another one. And what I think was happening is that th --\nthat they were celebrating different things happening as the war was really, completely ending.\nAnd -- and then I -- I started school, there was a -- a neighborhood school, and I went -- walked\nwith my girlfriend and she and I became great buddies and spent lots of time together. And after\nthe war she asked if I might -- would like to come on vacation with her and her parents, they\nwere going to a farm. And I was so excited, and I just loved going, and I was allowed to go, and\nit was a week. And I fell in love with the rooster\u2019s feathers, those sort of blue green feathers. And\nthe whole chicken yard was covered with these feathers, and I collected them. And I came back -\n- this was my great, you know, souvenir from this trip, which I just adored. I loved being on the\nfarm with the animals and everything, and I had this great bag of feathers which I took with me,\nwhich I also brought to America, which then got eaten by the moths somewheres along the way\nand had to get tossed.",
        "A: Yes, yes. How, I don\u2019t know, but they did. Well, Pll tell you how in a -- in -- in a minute, but\nthe -- that -- the happy days of this thing were then also made happier by the fact that we got air\nlifts from the Swedish Red Cross, we got air lifts of bread, and -- primarily bread, and then\npowdered milk were among the first things that came. And that was the first time that I tasted\nthis sort of soft, whitish bread. I don\u2019t know why they -- maybe it was because it kept well, so\nthat that\u2019s why they -- cause it really wasn\u2019t bread I was familiar with.",
        "A: And then we\u2019d began receiving parcels from both an -- my aunt, the other aunt, who was --\nhad meanwhile come to America, and my uncle and aunt. And they sent packages with clothing\nand food and peanut butter.",
        "A: That I\u2019m not sure of, but I know that they contacted -- initially they contacted the American,\nwhat\u2019s now I guess called the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. I think then 1t was\ncalled the American Joint Distribution Committee. And they conti -- tacted them because that\norganization was in -- was somehow infiltrated with the troops, in fact they traveled -- their\nworkers traveled in American uniforms. And they apparently did a lot of -- of rounding up of\nrefugees in all the countries, and were the -- the -- the agency that you got in touch with if you\nwanted to know if your relatives were still alive, and they -- they located us, and found us, and\ngave -- and to serve as the intermediary and so forth. And then they helped to arrange for us to\ngo to America.",
        "A: No, no, I didn\u2019t want to go. I mean, if you can imagine how eager I had been before the war\nstarted, to go to school, to have a life and so forth and so on, and now I come through this period\nof intense confinement and containment and -- and life picks up again, and I can wave the flag\nand I can put the picture of Queen Wilhemina over my bed -- which I also brought to America\nand also had over my bed in Rochester, New York. And I could do the things that I had looked\nforward to doing, you know, and I loved school, and I did very we -- I did very well in\neverything in school except handwerken. And handwerken is embroidery and knitting and that\nkind of stuff, and I always either flunked it or was borderline. I could somehow never get my\nhands to do what they were supposed to do. And I remember -- I remember my teacher,\n[indecipherable] and I remember having school trips to the Rembrandt house and to the museum\nand seeing the night watch for the first time, and all these things were very exciting to me. And\nnow, all of a sudden we should stop again, and -- and go somewhere where -- all I knew about\nwere the Apaches, and that was sort of a saving grace, but I didn\u2019t -- I-I didn\u2019t know this aunt\nand uncle or if -- if they had seen me as a baby, I didn\u2019t remember them.",
        "A: I was very happy with Tante Toos and living where I was, and I had this girlfriend and I\nplayed at her house and she had toys and I went on vacation with her family and I didn\u2019t want to\ngo at all. And I was finally sort of convinced of the fact that maybe it might be worth going\nbecause I was told that in America people were so wealthy that if you had a hole in your socks,\nthey just threw out the socks, whereas I had to learn how to darn socks, cause we hadn\u2019t had very\nmany socks and you just had to make it last, so --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",

        "A: It was terrible, and I was aware that it was terrible. And she was very unhappy. I don\u2019t think\nsh -- to my knowledge, she didn\u2019t try to stop this, but I am pretty sure that she offered to foster\nus.",
        "A: To have us become part of her family. And I don\u2019t know with whom she\u2019d had any\ndeliberations about this, but I am pretty sure that that took place. And she was very unhappy\nabout the whole thing. I -- I don\u2019t know how my sister felt at that time, anyway. And -- and I\nthink it fell to my sister to try to sort of ease that difficulty and -- and so on. And I don\u2019t -- I think\nshe knew my aunt and uncle, but certainly not well, because they only passed through the -- you\nknow, they never spent any -- I think he -- be -- spent a week there, in Amsterdam on his way\nthrough, but --",

        "A: Y -- my sister.",
        "A: Was my sister, not Tante Toos.",
        "A: And -- and it w -- I knew -- I was very well aware of the fact that sh -- that this was hard for\nher. I think at this point in time, I think certain things began to register on me.",
        "A: And that was one of them.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, partly because for him also, liberation meant liberation, and he later on became\na photojournalist. I don\u2019t know exactly what were the goings on between him and my sister. I\nknow they were very close, and then there was a very close friend of his with whom the two of\nthem were very close, so it was kind of a tre -- a threesome. I -- I -- I think it was very hard on\nmy sister for a variety of reasons, not the least of which was leaving what now had become her --\nher -- maybe more than just a very close relationship.",
        "A: And -- and that was very hard, and -- and then the -- the JDC, the Joint Distribution\nCommittee also funneled food and clothing and so forth. And then they sent a representative in\nuniform whose name was Mrs. Roosevelt, if you can believe it. And I f-fell in love with her, I\nthought she was just a lovely, lovely person, you know. Rich, dark hair and -- and this wonderful\nAmerican uniform. I mean, this American uniform was -- I-I -- I don\u2019t know how to say how\nhard it was for me during the anti-Vietnam times, when I took a strong anti- Vietnam stand. And I\nwas a girl scout leader at the time, and we were invited to march in the Memorial Day parade,\nand I had such a difficult time. And I actually sat the -- the kids down and explained to them that\nthey had been invited, and this is what Memorial Day was all about, and so forth and so on, and\nthat I myself owed something to the American soldiers, but at -- at this particular time, this also\nmeant something that I did not want to share, that I didn\u2019t believe in, and that I felt was wrong.\nAnd I wanted them to have two things out of that. One was, not a disrespect for Memorial Day,\nin fact, understanding that I owed my life to these men, and that I recognized that, and that I was\nvery torn up about this dilemma. And I also wanted them to understand that if you believe that\nthese values are important, then you have to do what this means for you, but you don\u2019t impose it\non someone else. So I made it clear to the 10 to 13 year old kids there that if it was important to\nshow your respect, and you did not have a reason not to do that, that they should go ahead and do\nthat. That just because I wasn\u2019t marching, I wasn\u2019t telling them that they shouldn\u2019t.",
        "A: And I think it was a lesson that went home to a number of them. But it was very upsetting to\nme. It was very upsetting to me, and I\u2019ve often thought of Memorial Day times during these\ndifficult times, and now here we are back again in a situation that is just so horrible to me, so\nhorrible to me, and I don\u2019t know what to say because every day you see not only all these\nAmericans -- all these young Americans and old Americans being killed, and thousands of Iraqis\nbeing killed, and each of these, like me, has a family, has a mother, a father, has children, some\nof them, brothers and sisters, and we just wipe them out, like so many ants, you know? And the\nfarther away we can do our destruction, it seems, the easier it is. We don\u2019t have to look these\npeople in the eye, we can just drop a bomb. And -- and I just can\u2019t over that. I just cannot get\nover that.",
        "A: Yeah, I think she was probably Miss, I\u2019m not sure, but in any case, it was wonderful, I mean,\nit made an almost -- and she was that kind of person anyway, but it made an instant connection\nfor us, and for me.",
        "A: And the uniform mattered. And apparently this is -- this uniform travel for these refugee\nworkers was done on purpose so that they would have more freedom of movement and so on. So\nshe gathered us up and made arrangements for us to go by train to Paris, and --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember it being awful, but I do remember the hugging and the kissing the tears and\nthe goodbyes.",
        "A: And then I remember us going to Paris on the train, and I was very excited to be on a train,\nand -- and she -- ar -- I don\u2019t know where this all came from, and how wonderful it was that it\nhappened, but we were in Paris for a few days and she took us around Paris --",
        "A: And she took us to the amusement park outside of Paris, or wherever it was, and -- and it was\nwonderful. And I\u2019m sure especially wonderful to my sister, who had studied French and studied\nabout France and on -- so forth. And then she took us on the train from Paris to Marseille, and in\nMarseille we were put under the aegis of a French orphan group, whose name I can\u2019t quite\nremember, but was initials, OCS or something like that, I don\u2019t remember what it was. And they\nput all the children -- I mean, we were the only two, as far as I know, who didn\u2019t belong to that\nFrench group, but there were hundreds of -- hundreds of children of all ages, and they put them\nall in the hold of this ship on these layers of canvas and gave every child a dirty blanket and said\nthat you\u2019re a number so and so on the thing. And I didn\u2019t speak French, but every other child did,\nand my sister did and so on. And all I remember is seeing this big opening on -- big s -- huge\nsquare opening and seeing the sky from the hold of this ship, which had been originally a Greek\ntroop sh -- a Greek freighter, which had been ta -- taken over and converted into a troop ship, and\nwas now converted into a passenger liner. So the passengers, the other passengers were really all\nadults, and the kids were all in the hold. A-And I don\u2019t know if there was any other cargo. And\nwe go across the waters of the Atlantic and sail, and the -- part -- partway into this trip I get sick\nagain, and I get this pneumonia and the bronchitis and the stuff all over again.",
        "A: Some sort of resmi -- respiratory stuff comes back, bronchitis, which I had fairly often after\nthat. And my sister, in the best of efforts, took me to the ship\u2019s dispensary, which had a Greek\ndoctor, who was kind of -- I -- I don\u2019t know where his training was from, but what they did to me\nthere was cupping. And I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever heard of or read about cupping, but cupping\nis taking something the equivalent of maybe a shot glass -- no, a little bigger, whatever, cocktail\nglass or something, and you create a vacuum in the glass by lighting a match into it, and you use\nup the air and the oxygen, and before you have a chance to fill that back in again, you press it\ndown on the back. And they put rows and rows of these glasses on my back. And then, of course,\nbecause there\u2019s a -- a vacuum in the glass, the glass pulls the skin and everything with the skin\ninto the glass. And then you yank these glasses off. So this provides -- what I decided the -- the\nreason for this was, to make you focus on some other pain, of such intensity that you forgot\nabout what you really came for. But it probably came from the medieval notion that if you get\nthe blood moving, that you could get the ill humors out, or something. And I was in huge pain,\nterrible pain, and I sat on a -- some -- some chair or other, some corner of the deck, swathed in\nblankets and the tears streaming down my face, for days. And the sa -- the -- the sailors kind of\ntook pity on me, and they would bring me an occasional piece of fruit or so -- the food on this\nboat was all spoiled. The only thing that was edible was some of the fruit. I -- I didn\u2019t eat\nanything except the fruit that they brought. And meanwhile I wasn\u2019t getting any better, so I had\nto report back to the dispensary and they would do it again and again. And I cried so bitterly and\npleaded with them to stop doing it, that they finally stopped doing it, but then they did something\nsomewhat similar which is -- which is, if you can imagine plaster that is like an emery board on\nthe other side, is like sandpaper. And they put this plaster on you with the sandpaper side\ntowards the skin, and then they rip it off in rapid succession. So you have again, a similar thing\ngoing on, but it\u2019s just horrendously painful. At least it wasn\u2019t as bad as the cupping. So partway\nacross the ocean, one of the engines dies, and then I became sort of aware of the fact there were\nall these adults on the boat, because then there was a lot of chaos, and a lot of crying, and a lot of\npeople who were certain we were never going to make it, and I saw how upset these people were.\nAnd I don\u2019t think it registered on me what it meant that one of the motors died and you couldn\u2019t\ndo anything. Well, we did make it over that ocean and we did get to New York, and when we\narrived in New York there was a dock strike. So now we\u2019re on this boat, twirling around in the\nharbor day after day after day with this dock strike going on, and --",
        "A: N -- I must have been because I didn\u2019t -- don\u2019t remember any more of these treatments, and I\nremember coming into the harbor and I remember seeing the -- that big neon sign, that horse\nwith -- the winged red horse, I don\u2019t know if 1t was Texaco or Mobil or s --",
        "A: Texaco?",
        "A: And I remember a huge, lit-up sign for Lorna Doone cookies, and all the city all lit up and\nthese skyscrapers looming up the air and so on. Anyway, finally, apparently the health\ndepartment stepped in and decided that this was a very bad situation, have all these children in\nthe hold of the ship. So they took just the children off on -- on one of these sightseeing water\nboats, or several decker boat things. And ki -- when we came into Ellis Island and unloaded, and\nmy aunt and uncle had both come to New York, but my uncle had had to go back, because of the\ndock strike, he couldn\u2019t take off from work so long. So we came into this enormous processing\nhall of some sort or other, and walked in there, and I remember my sister had her arm around me,\nand she was carrying whatever little baggage we had. And as we came in at either side of the --\nthis enormous doorway, were women standing with a stack of presents, and each child was given\nthis beautifully wrapped box. Now, what\u2019s in this box? A set of three handkerchiefs, and some\nwhite handkerchiefs for the -- for the boys. Well, not everybody -- ther--there wasn\u2019t the sort of\nuniversal prevalence of Kleenex, I mean yes they were on the market, but not the way they are\nnow, and women -- proper women carried handkerchiefs. And although these were not elegantly\nembroidered, they were -- they were beautifully stamped with pretty flowers and so forth and so\non. And I thought how wonderful that I\u2019m coming to this new country, and they don\u2019t even know\nme, and they\u2019re here to say welcome with a gift? This made an indelible impression on me, that\nthey would think enough to -- to -- to welcome me to the country. I don\u2019t know who the agency\nwas, I don\u2019t know who inspired that idea because it was both useful as well as a kind of a luxury.",

        "A: Yes, yes.",

And I -- and how do you ever thank someone for having done\nwhat she did? I-I -- I know my sister has entered her papers and story and background and\neverything in the Yad Vashem Righteous Gentile history and archives and so on. But you know,\nfirst of all, this is coming along after the fact, and -- and sh-she is now gone, although I was able\nto go back to Holland and meet with her and introduce her to my husband and --",
        "A: -- two small children. And I -- I -- oh, I had such trepidations about this meeting, but it went\njust flawlessly, even though she doesn\u2019t speak a -- didn\u2019t speak a word of English. But she\u2019s now\ngone also, and whatever honors and so forth, and so on -- which is not what she did this for in the\nfirst place, but -- but how do you rev -- repay someone for that kind of gift, for that kind of\nsacrifice? It\u2019s impossible. I c -- I couldn't even begin to brainstorm ideas about anything. And the\nolder I get, the more I understand it, and the more I admire here. She was not a complicated\nwoman, she was not well educated. She, as I say, worked for my father in the bakery as a\nsalesgirl, and they must have somehow kept in touch because even when she was -- m-my sister\ndid indicate that there was -- that they had kept in touch and so forth. I don\u2019t know if there was\nany socializing back and forth. But that\u2019s -- y-you know, I -- I -- why did she do this, did she do\nit because there was money to be had? I\u2019m sure that wasn\u2019t an issue. Did she do it -- there may\nhave well passed money, but I\u2019m sure this was not the reason. Did she do it for religious reasons?\nI don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t remember them being very religious -- I mean, I remember -- I remember\nthe neighbors after the war, I remember that the neighbors who ran the embroidery store next\ndoor were two -- two ladies who seemed -- who then seemed elderly to me, they probably\nweren\u2019t, and -- and they were very religious, and they asked if I would like to go to Catholic\nmass with them the following whatever, whatever, and -- and I was a child who really kept away\nfrom religion. Now why? It\u2019s not so easy to say. People make an easy assumption that it\u2019s\nbecause of my -- my experiences. I\u2019m not sure. Somehow these experiences are in a separate\ncategory. Whereas I was never a child who had great notions of -- of God and -- and so forth, I\nhad -- religion made me uncomfortable, and I just wasn\u2019t very keen on it. But -- but I don\u2019t think\nthat that was the motivating factor w-w-wh-why would she respond so differently than the other\nsiblings with whom she was raised? So I think some of that had to do, perhaps, with the personal\nrelationship that she had with my father. He had been very good to her, I understand, and maybe\n-- m-maybe that\u2019s sort of what I always preach about, which is that when -- when people get to\nknow each other, when people rub elbows together, when you see that -- that, you know, this\nperson is not some stereotypic, stigmatized non -- untouchable kind of person -- I-I don\u2019t know,\nm-maybe she had a crush on my father when she was young. I -- I -- I have no idea why she did\nit. Did she do it as wi -- what you said earlier, that she perhaps wasn\u2019t wild about Jews, but this is\na Jew she knew personally and she felt that she -- that he didn\u2019t deserve, and his family didn\u2019t\ndeserve this. I -- I don\u2019t know, and Ill never know. She never, to my knowledge, talked about,\neither then or later.",
        "A: That wa -- might well be the case. And I -- I -- whether it was a spontaneous action on her\npart, I think it might well have been, but she stayed with it, and she, you know, could easily have\nsort of changed her mind along the way, anywhere along the way, and -- and didn\u2019t.",

        "A: That would seem logical, but -- but I-I- think on the whole -- I\u2019m sort of generalizing, but it\ncertainly was true at that time; at that time, certainly, Europeans tended to be much more private\nand keep much more to themselves. So even if they felt this, I don\u2019t think they -- that they would\ngo to her and say this. And there was little, if any, social interaction between the neighbors and\nthis family. And I think that that was fairly typical, I don\u2019t think that people -- the other thing is\nthat social life and friendships, at least at that time, and to some degree still, were among people\nwho were much closer. There wasn\u2019t -- there isn\u2019t this level of sort of almost superficial\nfriendship and socializing that you have in -- in America. In fact, one of the things I always try to\n-- to talk to foreign students about when they come to America to study is the fact that people\nwill say, how are you, but they don\u2019t really want to know how you are. That\u2019s -- it\u2019s a greeting,\nit\u2019s not an -- an inquiry. And -- and some of our students did wonderful little take-offs on this,\nyou know. How -- how am I? Well, my knee hurts, and I wasn\u2019t able to get the laundry done\nyesterday, and so forth and so on, Meanwhile the other student\u2019s out the door. At this -- in -- in\nthe same way, they sometimes end up very disappointed because they say -- the students will\nsay, well, call me up some time, or we\u2019ll get together, but nobody ever follows it up with a\ndistinct invitation. And those are the same kinds of cultural differences even more so, that\noperated there. People kept to themselves, they had their little yards, they had the fences. If they\nobserved things, they didn\u2019t socialize about those things. So if some of that took place, I don\u2019t\nknow about it.",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m sure I was.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure I was.",
        "A: But I didn\u2019t have to wear a star.",
        "A: And I was back to my n -- regular name.",
        "A: I mean, I was called Hedy in Dutch. I-I was called Hady by my family, Hady, or Hedy being\nthe short form of Hedwig, but I didn\u2019t have to be Hedy Vermeulen --",
        "A: -- which was the equivalent of Jane Doe, or John Smith. I could -- I could be Hedy Cohen.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s a good question. Initially, it apparently was used by the Nazis as a some kind of --\nI don\u2019t know if it was an office or headquarters or something, or -- or officer\u2019s quarters. I --\nactually when I was back in Holland at one time, tried to find out what happened to this house.\nIt\u2019s not clear to me that we actually owned it, it\u2019s possible that we rented it and I don\u2019t know that.\nBut I tried to get hold of the -- of the documents that would indicate what the story was, and\nthere is basically a large, blank space.",
        "A: And at some point or other, the city of Amsterdam took it over, and for a brief period of time\nthey had orphans living there after the war. And then I think it was sold to a private party, and --\nwhich may well have been the one that I stopped to ask if I could see the place.",
        "A: Nothing from the house, nothing from all the stuff that we closed the door on.",
        "A: Paintings, and rugs, and -- and beautiful furniture and so forth. Nothing, nothing. Holland as a\n-- acountry did finally make some blanket payment of a couple thousand dollars to everyone\nwho was caught up in this war, with the understanding that you then didn\u2019t try to sue them, or get\nanything back. But there was no quid pro quo for specifics.",
        "A: Wh-Whether you had a house or not have a house. But it was very difficult to find out\nanything. And again, it was because of the expos\u00e9 of some journalist that it came to light that the\nnumber of Dutch banks apparently had in their v-vaults and safe deposit box, all kinds of jewelry\nand antiques and silver, and so forth and so on, that had been deposited there by Jews, which\nthey claimed they didn\u2019t have. And apparently the -- these banks had hidden this stuff in the\nattics of some houses on the canals and so forth, in Amsterdam. And some bright-eyed journalist\nexposed this whole mess, which is how this payment came about, how this sort of blanket\npayment was made. But you know -- I mean, f-for some people it\u2019s too late, it\u2019s -- a payment was\ntoo late for my aunt. She died in \u201997, and I was in Vienna, and I learned when I was in Vienna\nthat Austria, at some brief moment in time was shamed into making some kind of compensation,\nand that they -- it was so shamefully small, apparently, that there was a big -- I don\u2019t remember\nthis, but a big hullabaloo about it. And they stopped this small payment, and then they started\nagain, made it a little bit bigger. But they kept the time period within which you could apply for\nthat so narrow, and that the announcing of this worldwide so closed, that nobody knew about it. I\nmean, here my aunt reads and talks German, and so forth, reads the papers. Her brother was --\ncame back from Russia to live in Vienna, they didn\u2019t know about it. I talked to my -- my aunt\u2019s\nsister-in-law, who is now in a home for the aged in Vienna, and I asked her if she knew anything\nabout this and she said no. She doesn\u2019t know anything about this. And when I went to f -- inquire\nabout this and so forth, they in -- practically didn\u2019t say anything, but immediately said to me, it\u2019s\nnot for heirs, it\u2019s only for that person. Well -- or -- or persons. So they made it very clear that\nthey weren't about to do anything. But the N\u201c degree of this is how do you repay anybody? How\ndo you put a figure on what happened?",
        "A: But there are many, many people, and I feel myself a very fortunate exception, but there are\nmany, many people living in poverty, living with very little means, elderly, who should have\nthat, and nobody should be asking them to have to go Vienna to rattle the cage there, and say --\nyou know, this is just so terrible. Or -- or what happened with the Swiss banks? My family\napparently put some money in Swiss banks, which we have not been able to get out. We have not\nbeen able to locate it, we have not been able to provide them adequate proof of the fact that this\nwas done. What am I supposed to do, get my parents back from the grave? It -- it\u2019s just very\nhard. And -- and the Swiss in their, you know, great neutrality, have profited enormously from\nthis neutrality, financially.",
        "A: And every other way.",
        "A: N-No, we were immediately through the -- we processed through, and my aunt was waiting\nfor us in -- behind some whatever, whatever. And she used to tell me how she will never, ever --\nw-would never get out of her memory, out of her visual mind\u2019s eye, the -- this 18 year old with\nher hand around her little sister -- her arm around her little sister, carrying this little satchel in\nthese clothes that didn\u2019t exactly fit and so forth and so on. And by then I had pigtails again, and -\n- and 1-1 -- th-there is this school picture of me which shows how I -- I looked at the time. And\nmy farewell present from my dear friend across the street was this big, big ribbon, and the proper\npin to put those big ribbons in on top of your head, because that was the fashion of the kids at\nthat time, and I didn\u2019t have those. And she gave me one of hers, and it was a farewell present.\nAnd so I wore that for my first day of school in Rochester, but it was not appreciated by my\npeers, and so I quickly put it in a drawer.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Oh yes, she had seen us as little -- little -- and as -- as a lot younger",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: Apparently.",
        "A: Apparently. I think probably my sister didn\u2019t change that much. I suspect I did, quite a lot.",
        "A: It was sort of -- I\u2019m not sure you can assign any -- any -- sort of anything to that, because I-I -\n- I guess for me it was, well this was the person who was my aunt. I mean, it was sort of like\nputting it out there, and saying, well this is -- because I didn\u2019t remember her coming through, I\nhad no idea what she looked like. And I guess I say I was -- wasn\u2019t thrill -- actually, my sister\nmay have sent them the passport pictures that we had taken.",
        "A: And my passport ticsh -- picture was taken in the hospital when I was recovering, and I\u2019m\nsitting on one of these Victorian settees type things --",
        "A: -- that was out in the -- the lawn area or something, and there is this little tiny face, with little,\nskinny pigtails, which is swathed in this enormous Navy surplus, U.S. Navy surplus sweater.\nAnd right here in the middle is U.S. on the sweater, and this 1s the picture of me on my passport.\nAnd she may well have sent --",
        "A: -- copies of these picture to them. Never thought about it, but she may have done that.",
        "A: Absolutely. So imagine suddenly having an 18 and a 10 year old -- or almost 11 year old.\nThey -- I\u2019m sure they were full of trepidation --",
        "A: -- \u2019'm sure they were. And I -- I -- well, you know, I just marvel at them when I think about it,\nand I think about the -- the difference in needs for an 18 years old and a 10 year old or an 11 year\nold, and -- and I remember coming into -- into New York and -- and going to -- to the hotel,\nwhere I had this incredible bath, which I hadn\u2019t had since God knows when. And I remember in\nwhatever hotel we were, at the Hotel York or Hotel New York, or whatever, and my aunt is\nscrubbing my hair back, or whatever, whatever, and the -- on the other side of the window are\nsome working men, who are either working on another building or washing windows or\nwhatever, starting to whistle at the scene in this -- and there was no comment from her that I can\nremember, but I remember thinking something a little strange. And -- and then I remember she\nhad one or two good friends who lived in New York who had also immigrated earlier, before\nthings all shut down. And the next day they came to meet us, one of them came, then the other\ncouple came, and so I quickly got to know these were their friends. And we went to have\nbreakfast at one of these automats, and I thought this was just wonderful, this thing where you\ncould keep moving stuff around --",
        "A: -- and find -- and choose what you wanted, and I was very excited about that, and I remember\nbeing struck by the amount of food that was thrown out. Watching what people left on their\ntrays, and it got tossed. Right from day one when I arrived, that made an indelible impression.\nAnd then I remember liking very much we -- in the display counter where -- where you paid the\nbill or whatever -- it was either there or at some other restaurant. Once place had a v -- a soft sort\nof stuffed toy that was a -- a kitty, and it was sort of almost real fur, maybe it was, and I fell in\nlove with it, and one of my aunts friends bought that for me. And then in the other place I liked\nvery much, it was a little red shoulder bag for -- for a young child, and I loved it, and the other\none bought that for me. So immediately I was -- I ha -- I had these two very meaningful gifts,\nwhich I still have someplace. And then I remember being just so overwhelmed and excited about\nthe fact that there were these fruit stands on the streets, and bananas, which I loved bananas and I\nhad not had them since before the war. And oranges. And oranges used to be very special, and --\nfrom Spain, and here were just this -- just enormous supply, and I still to this day will walk into\nthese incredible supermarkets we have here, where you have these enormous amounts of\neverything, as much as you want. It -- 1f you only have the money to buy it, you can have it from\nall over the world. I -- it still blows my mind when I see it, and I -- 1t goes back to these carts on\nthe street corner having all these things that I had not had. And I wanted bananas, bananas and\nbananas, and my aunt said, you\u2019re going to burst if you keep on eating like this.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, I th -- they lived very carefully, they lived very carefully and I -- and in retrospect when\nI think about it, I think they st -- they started literally with nothing, and they had very few things\nthat they were able to bring, and very little money and they lived first in a apartment. Then I later\non saw pictures of them buying, you know, their furniture bit by bit and so forth and so on. And\nmy aunt took in some sewing, did work for some other seamster -- a --a person who had a\nclothing -- very fine clothing store in Rochester, and she would do hems and shorten things for\nthem, I mean, it was sort of menial stuff for someone who had done designer --",
        "A: -- apparel and so on. In fact, I -- I learned to do hems, and I used to get 35 cents a hem if I\nhelped her out, and -- to do that. And we immediately were sort of integrated into the household,\nand we each were given chores and responsibility in the house. And my sister and I always did\nthe dishes after dinner. And we took turns doing bathroom cleaning and each of us had to learn\nto cook certain things and once a week I had to bake something for everyone. So there was a\nkind of sense of pulling together, and -- and stuff. But I remember immediately that it was a very\nwarm and supportive environment. There was a lot of laughter, there was the -- and I had\npictures -- I-I remember I used to love to sit on my uncle\u2019s knees, and he would sing little\nrhymes of -- of being a rider on a horse kind of thing. And then I would -- I saw pictures of me\nwith a sprinkler in the backyard, and I think that they were -- they didn\u2019t have much money, and\neverything was budgeted. But they were -- they could take care of themselves, and they could put\nfood on the table, and -- good food, and -- there weren\u2019t luxuries. They didn\u2019t have a car, they\ndidn\u2019t have a television, they didn\u2019t have a radio, they didn\u2019t -- or a big radio, or a record player.\nIn fact, I remember when each of these things came into our lives, what a big occasion that was,\nand how special that was.",
        "A: Don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: If it was, it was at a level that I wasn\u2019t aware of.",
        "A: My guess is that more of that was done with my sister, if 1t was done at all. Maybe they felt\nthey should let us -- I-I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t remember being -- I do remember very\nmuch responding in a very negative way when their friends or other adults, or anybody for that\nmatter, tended to ask me. Because I always had the sense that they were looking at me like\nsomething ri -- strange, some -- somebody that they couldn't relate to when I would start to tell\nthings, so I'd stop telling them things. I just didn\u2019t -- I -- I would sort of politely -- literally work\nmy way out of the situation. And -- and it was years like that, that I didn\u2019t talk about the war.\nYears, years.",
        "A: That\u2019s at least what I remember feeling, and sort of -- I began to feel like I don\u2019t want to be\nthis odd creature that they\u2019re going to be staring at for the next hour while we tal -- while they\nask me more questions. So I didn\u2019t want to do this. And -- and that was one feeling, and the other\nfeeling that I\u2019m sure played into that, was that I wanted to get on with my life, I wanted to be like\neverybody else, and don\u2019t forget, this was not in the days of cultural diversity, multicultural\neducation, or anything remotely resembling that. You were going to be an American as fast as\npossible. You were going to lose your accents, and your strange ways, and you were going to\nconform to what was the way of the world in this country. And being at an age now getting ready\nto move into adolescent, that was sort of partly what I wanted to do, too. I wanted to be accepted,\nI didn\u2019t want to be looked at as odd, I -- I -- it was hard enough to be the little girl from Holland,\nI was one of maybe six Jewish kids in an entire elementary school of 600. And it was not a\nJewish neighborhood, I did not want to explain why I didn\u2019t have blonde hair and blue eyes and\nwhy I didn\u2019t have wooden shoes. I didn\u2019t -- I wanted to desperately learn to hit a ball, for -- so\nthat when we went out for recess and played baseball, I wasn\u2019t always the last kid left there alone\nbecause nobody wanted me on their team. So that to me was a great day when I, you know, hit\nthat ball, and after that, boy, they vied for me on the teams.",
        "A: But it was -- 1t was hard, I was different on so many levels. So I just wanted, I guess, to -- to I-\nlose my accent, and learn to speak English, and participate in American life. I -- I mean, now I\nwas here, it wasn\u2019t sort of like, well, do you want to go home again. I didn\u2019t want -- I mean, ad --\nnot that I had any choice in the matter, and I knew that, but I was now wanting to -- and I -- I -- I\ncan only say I was made to feel -- I-I have no negative recollections of coming to my aunt and\nuncle\u2019s home.",
        "A: I think it was much harder for my sister on the other hand, because here she had been an\nadult, she had acted as an adult, she had been responsible as an adult, she had taken care of us --\na young child. And now suddenly she was again a -- an older child in the home, and my folks\nhad a lot of -- they -- they tried very hard, they -- they went to the high school guidance people,\nand they asked what should they do, after all my sister had this terrific education from the\ngymnasium, and should she apply to college and so on. And basically they recommended that\nmaybe she take her senior year, so that she\u2019d have and -- a more even grounding from which to\nmove into the college. And she did that, but it was hard, you know, the kids were not geared to\ntaking in somebody like her, and --",
        "A: -- she was so much more serious, and --",
        "A: -- I mean, sh -- what she went through, they couldn\u2019t even fathom.",
        "A: So yeah, her way was much more difficult, much.",
        "A: I mean, in spite of the fact that I didn\u2019t speak a word of English, and she did, because she had\nstudied it. But it was heavily accented, and she was clearly older and more mature, and clearly a\nvery good student, which doesn\u2019t always endear you to other high school peers.",
        "A: It was tough.",
        "A: German.",
        "A: German. They didn\u2019t speak Dutch.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: So my sister and I spoke Dutch with each other, German with them --",
        "A: -- and English in school --",
        "A: -- and on the outside.\nBeginning Tape Nine",
        "A: Alfred and Anne.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: N-No, officially it actually came much later.",
        "A: But I -- I think that this may have been out of a certain respect of understanding that we\nneeded to kind of grow and develop our relationship and -- and so forth, that I-I -- maybe they\nfelt this was not a -- a good thing emotionally to do. I-I don\u2019t know exactly why.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. They were, and -- and they also were very old world people in the sense\nthat they had trouble sort of understanding high school life as it existed here. And so I think that\ncreated a lot of problems for my sister. And also what I pointed out earlier is that she was so\nmuch older, and had had so much freedoms, and now suddenly --",
        "A: -- you know, you have to be in by x hour and -- and whatever. And -- and there was some\ntension even later when she went through college at the University of Rochester and she would\nbring home, or some boy would come calling for her, and he happened to be German. And they\napparently gave her the business about that. I don\u2019t re-remember too much about it except she\nwas pretty unhappy about it. They basically sort of said to her, how can you -- how can you\nconsider going with this boy when, you know, you\u2019ve lost your entire family. And -- I mean that\n-- that whole issue is a very tough one anyway.",
        "A: But I think at that time, it just was -- it -- I think it was extremely difficult -- it was extremely\ndifficult for her.",
        "A: And less so for me. And again, par-partly the age, and partly the type of person. I mean, if\nthey were critical of her, and my -- my uncle was -- tended to be super-critical, he was a very\ndemanding father figure, a -- he was very bright, he couldn\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t\nunderstand your math. And when I would bring a report card home and it would have all\nexcellents and one satisfactory, he would say, what happened here? Why didn\u2019t you get -- you\nknow, it wa-was never isn\u2019t this a wonderful report card, but rather --",
        "A: What\u2019s the pe -- he would always see the piece that was lacking. By the same token they both\nwere very strongly committed to the importance of education, and that was not something you\ntook lightly. And long decades afterwards, I understood from the story that he lived, that they\nlived, how important that was. They would have been in the poorhouse otherwise, if he hadn\u2019t\nbeen able to --",
        "A: An-And they always impressed on us the importance of education is something -- part of it is\nthe fact that it\u2019s not something anyone can take away from you.",
        "A: And I -- it was long after, when I was doing my doctoral dissertation and I finally got to the\npoint where I was writing the -- the dedication, that I acknowledged that early teaching, because\nit hadn\u2019t actually registered on me, but I realized I had sort of come slowly to a point where I\nunderstood that they were in part responsible for my continuing to -- to go there, go that route.",
        "A: N -- I wouldn\u2019t say they were -- I think my aunt was less religious than my uncle. I think that\nthey believed in the importance of maintaining certain traditions. They believed in the\nimportance of supporting the Jewish people as a people. They became founding members of the\nsynagogue in Westport, actually, and helped to -- to -- to set that up. They insisted that I go to\nSunday school, and I guess when I was an absolute, miserable person -- child, when I was little,\nand -- and given to tantrums, I guess that\u2019s the biggest one I ever threw, was when they said I\nhad to go to Sunday school. I instinctively didn\u2019t want Sunday school, I instinctively didn\u2019t want\npart of that, I instinctively rejected any notion of religiosity and religious stuff and all the rest of\nit, and I probably also rejected any other entrapment for being different again. I don\u2019t know how\ncognizant I was of that, but I think intuitively I was.",
        "A: I\u2019m not an agnostic -- I mean, I\u2019m not an atheist, but I\u2019m probably an agnostic, if -- if you\nhave to pigeonhole me at all. But I --",
        "A: I mean in -- in one sense, I have felt that the things that have been done in the name of\nreligion are so reprehensible throughout history, with no religion left outside of that blanket\nindictment, that I think it has not done good, it has done bad. And I -- it\u2019s only continuing that\nway.",
        "A: Well, it wasn\u2019t terrible, it was sort of ineffectual as far as I was concerned, it was, you know, I\ncouldn\u2019t sleep late on Sunday and I had to go there, and blah, blah, blah, and I hated it, and I\nwent. And I got -- I made some friends, and most of the Jewish kids didn\u2019t live in our\nneighborhood, so any friendships I made were difficult to follow up on because they were in\nother parts of Rochester. And they themselves were members of the Conservative Temple in -- in\nRochester, but they felt okay with me going to the Reformed synagogue, which was interesting.\nBut when it came to the high holidays, they walked, and they celebrated them, and they wanted\nme to do likewise, and I was supposed to go to services with them, and walk to Temple, and not\nbeing a great lover of walking from the days I went through the alley at the -- at the wax\nmuseum, I always sort of resented that, and I thought that the whole idea was crazy and foolish\nand you know, it just seemed to me sort of -- and then of course I was out of school on those\ndays, and I didn\u2019t like that, and I had to go back and explain why wasn\u2019t I in school. And those\nwere not the days when you were given to be excused because it was religious absence and stuff,\nso that was always a pain. On the other hand, by the time I got to about the eighth grade, I had a\nvery good teacher, and we had some real history, and the history of the Jewish people. And I\nended up actually valuing that because I did learn something here, and because I always found\nmyself in the position of being the only Jewish kid in a large gathering of non-Jews. And so I\nwas always the spokesperson, a not particularly willing] -- willingly, but people put me there. So\nI would have to answer questions about what do Jews believe and -- and why did they kill Christ,\nand all these kinds of things. And it made me rather unhappy, but I felt better having had the\nclass, so that I could in fact answer some questions. And so actually I stayed on, and stayed in\nthe Confirmation year, which was yet another year, and then I learn even more about what Jews\nbelieve and why they do what they do. And then I was Confirmed and I went on and stayed in --\nI-I was -- I sang in the choir in the synagogue and then I stayed on and did two more years of\nwhat was called post-Confirmation class. And we did comparative religion, and we did study of\nthe Torah and so forth, wi-with Rabbi Philip Bernstein who\u2019d been a -- a chapel -- chaplain at --\nduring the second war. And I think that there was a lot that I began to appreciate about what then\nbecame something more meaningful.",
        "A: And as my life continued, it was always in this vein of being, for example, out of 1800 in the\nhigh school, there were probably 10 or fewer Jewish kids at that particular high school. S -- and\nthen I was -- I was very active in the girl scouts, and I was selected to represent New York state\nat a national encampment, and I was back in the same pool of, you know, well tell us about Jews.\nNow they didn\u2019t ask me stuff about the war yet, and -- and -- or -- well, some people did, but I\nsort of kept that still pretty much closed. But I did appreciate that, and I -- but I had such a\ncommitment to trying to improve the whole Sunday school experience for children that I\nvolunteered to teach Sunday school. I -- I had this presumptuous sense that I could do it better\nthan these other people.",
        "A: And I think I did.",
        "A: Yeah, well was a little bit -- little bit difficult. I mean, on the first year I was teaching, a -- one\nof the little kids of -- first or -- kindergarten, first grade or something, came up to me and said,\n\u201cYou know, Mrs. Cohen, I saw God on television last night.\u201d And the -- things like that were a\nlittle difficult to cope with, but there was definitely a sense on my part that I felt a -- a --a--a\nreason to be a teacher, to -- to teach kids something, and to not disperse or dispel any notions of\nGod, or the existence of God, which I would never do, but to bring in what is important about\nreligions, and beliefs and values. Wh-What -- what is there that\u2019s really worth fighting for here?\nAnd I think that that really was the sort of connecting thread to most of what I did all my life.\nGoing into education with a strong belief in -- in the value of education for teaching, and for\nopening up horizons and for having people learn to live with each other and so forth. I was a -- a\none world candidate, and in high school I was, you know, preaching -- or not preaching, but I\nwas s-supporting those kinds of organizations. I remember some very narrow-minded high\nschool teachers with whom I challenged their viewpoints and so forth. I was never afraid to stand\nup or to speak out, and as turns out, neither are my kids. But I didn\u2019t need to be pigeonholed, and\nI didn\u2019t want to be pigeonholed, and -- a-and it was -- it was -- it was a very much longer time\nbefore I began talking about the war, and as I said earlier, I -- I never thought of myself as a\nsurvivor. I thought only those people who had survived the camps, the people -- th-th-the -- the\ndisplaced persons, the people who had the numbers carved on their arms. I didn\u2019t have that, and I\nwas alive, and I was -- I was with a family, and I guess I was hidden, but -- so -- and -- and I\nremember the first time, the very first time that I saw any movie that related to anything having\nto do with the war. I-It was -- it -- it packed an enormous emotional wallop, and it was, \u201cThe\nPawnbroker.\u201d And I don\u2019t know if you remember the film.",
        "A: But this -- and this whole struggle of this poor man, who himself had been a displaced person,\nand you get that message as you see his arm and so forth. And he suspects this young, black guy\nof stealing from him. And then the struggle within himself about not wanting to stereotype and\nnot wanting to make assumptions because this kid\u2019s black. And then his head running over with\nthe re -- memories of the camps, and -- and then having this interspersed with the actual\nnewsreels of that period of the -- of the camps. I went home, I was wiped out. I had se -- Peter\nhad told me some months before, I don\u2019t think you want to see that, but I went to see it anyway.\nAnd by then I had one or two kids and we were at Smith, and I had a babysitter and wanted to go\nto the movies on the campus. And I came back and this babysitter opened the door, and she\ndidn\u2019t see the fact that I was really still speechless. And she sort of bubbled over and said, \u201cOh\nhi, Mrs. Rose, how\u2019d you enjoy the movie?\u201d And I was just stunned by her use of the word\nenjoy, and I -- she didn\u2019t see my face, didn\u2019t notice anything, and I said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think\nenjoy is the word you want to use with that film.\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, y-you know, my\nroommate and I kind of th-thought about going to see it, but then we figured it was so much\nHollywood make-believe.\u201d And this is in the early 60\u2019s and that\u2019s when I had one my early, sort\nof comeuppances about the fact that I have to speak, I can\u2019t remain silent if people are thinking\nthat.",
        "A: And another time the same thing happened with when I was driving between Syracuse and\nRochester, or wherever, or Ithaca, and I was listening to a -- it mus -- must have been around\nPassover time, and I was looking for some station on the dial and twisting the dial and I heard\nthis rabbi speaking, and I -- something either made me stop -- maybe I put my hand on the\nwheel, and the rabbi said something like, someday we\u2019re going to have the story of the Holocaust\nbetween the covers of a little book, and we will have a holiday to commemorate that it happened,\nand everyone re -- will read what it says in the book and they\u2019ll say, this couldn\u2019t possibly have\nhappened. And all of a sudden I made the connection between the Hagadah and the story of the\nplagues and the exodus of -- from Egypt, and my own reaction at the table at home where I\nthought, oh this could never have happened. I\u2019m thinking, oh my God. Y-You know, he\u2019s\nabsolutely right. And this was long before we had the holiday and long before we set aside this\ntime, and -- and so forth, and I thought -- and that -- these two incidents, I think, sort of propelled\nme to get over my reluctance to speak, and when this girl -- this babysitter said to me -- she\u2019s\nfinally re-registered something of my face --",
        "A: -- and she said, would I be willing to come and speak to them in the dorm? And I said of\ncourse, and that was sort of the beginning of tt.",
        "A: And then I was asked in classes and assemblies and so on. So then many years followed of\nthat. But --",
        "A: Before I got my doctorate, yes --",
        "A: Yes. It started before then.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: A very young bride.",
        "A: A very young bride. Yeah, I met him in between my junior and senior year 1n high school.",
        "A: No, he was between junior and senior year in college, so --",
        "A: -- he was all bi -- already about fed up with college and all its stuff --",
        "A: -- and then -- then here was this -- his girlfriend, and here I -- I was very active in school, and\nI had a lot of responsibilities and commitments and had a wonderful -- wonderful principal and\nso on. Then I -- I gave up some of those things once we started going together, but it was hard\nfor him to get into this scene --",
        "A: -- the high school scene, after the college scene.",
        "A: I think it was more gradual with him. I think things came out piecemeal over time and\ndiscussion and as we grew to know each other more, and so forth. And it was a -- after all, it was\nthree years before we were married, but yeah, it -- it -- well, it did not all come at once.",
        "A: And -- and it was not -- and it was not a public thing, either, it was very much more private.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: It does not become public.",
        "A: Right. And --",
        "A: I do now, and I also realize that more and more of us are gone. And that er -- that the -- the\nlittlest bit that I can do to bear testimony to this event is probably the only thing I can do to\njustify that I am among the living, and so many are among the dead. And if I\u2019m not willing to do\nthat, then I\u2019m really doing a grave disservice, both to humankind and to those who died, because\nno one was there to speak for them if it\u2019s not coming from us. And the -- the dilemma about not\nonly studying this whole human element to -- to realize -- well, I made mention for example of\nthe -- of \u201cThe Eye of the Storm,\u201d or the -- the, \u201cBlue Eyes, Brown Eyes,\u201d and all of those. Yes,\nwe can isolate those particular behaviors and we can call them by names and we can study them.\nStanley Milgrim, a social psychologist at Yale did these studies that are probably more telling\nabout what happened and why people and how people were able to do these terrible things. If\nyou know the -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m sure you do, but he -- he basically put somebody in a white coat in a\nlab with a one way mirror, and he brought people in off the street, and said we\u2019re running this\nexperiment. We\u2019re going to see how much pain these -- how much shock these subjects are\nwilling to endure. And below the one way mirror was a group of actors in a studio. And there\nwas a fake set of dials and people turned up the electricity. Up and up and up. And it didn\u2019t\nmatter that the actors were writhing on the floor and screaming and calling and saying stop, stop.\nIt apparently did not affect most of the people, not every single one. And now you couldn\u2019t do\nthat kind of experiment any more because of the upset to the people who -- who came to\nrecognize what they were capable of doing. But if we\u2019re capable of doing that, and we keep\ndoing it, and we keep doing it, and we keep turning our backs to what\u2019s going on 1n areas where\nother people are doing it, we\u2019re not advancing at all.",
        "A: Well, I think that if there are enough people who hear it, and if there are enough people who\nare struck by the fact that this kind of behavior can lead to this kind of event, the Holocaust, that\nmaybe it behooves them to do something before we get there. Maybe. I -- I think th -- I only -- I\nhave to continue to believe that, because otherwise I can\u2019t continue to go on. And this is also\nback to what I said earlier about the fact you never know what you\u2019re able to sustain, you never\nknow what you are able to do, or what you\u2019d be willing to do in a situation where your life\ndepends on it, or the lifes of your loved ones. But the bottom line is that we should perhaps not\nbe so adaptable. We should not be able to do what these Jews did for so long, throughout history,\nwhich 1s to adjust to the behavior that was imposed on them, and the restrictions imposed on\nthem, and the tortures imposed on them. What can you do? You can\u2019t stand up and fight. I know\nthat they -- they were helpless, they had no weapons, they had no allies, they had nothing. So the\nquestion about why didn\u2019t they stand up and fight becomes a -- a moot question, really. But\nwhen you find yourself in a situation where we really must stop, I don\u2019t know why we, as a\nnation, aren\u2019t in the streets, and I consider myself equally guilty, because I don\u2019t know what to\ndo. But why are not in the street demanding that we stop killing? How far have we come if we\ncan\u2019t sit around the table and try to work things out. Why can\u2019t we -- I took training in\nmediation. Much of my work has been in -- in law in education, and first amendment rights. And\nthose liberties and freedoms that we have fought for in this country, since time immemorial as\nfar as the history of this country, why are we suddenly making different rules for different\npeople? I -- I don\u2019t know how to adjust to that, it -- 1t -- it\u2019s -- I think when people used to ask\nme, you know, do you wa -- well, how do you feel about this country and so forth, and I always\nhad felt this 1s the country where people can talk, where people can argue, where you can have a\ndialog, where we have an open press. And yet things keep coming out, and keep coming out and\nkeep coming out. In the papers every day, in the -- the general news. I don\u2019t have access to any\nprivate news any more than anybody else. But finally it\u2019s getting to people in the streets that this\npresident lied to us, and for whatever personal reasons went to war, killing not only Americans,\nbut also Iraqis, or Afghanis, and the -- and the justification for af -- Afghanistan, I think, is\ncertainly greater than Iraq. But there were no weapons of mass destruction. Why do we support a\nworld organization? Why do we say other countries have to adhere to the decisions of the world\norganization, but we\u2019re outside the law. This doesn\u2019t make any sense. That doesn\u2019t move us\nforward. It doesn\u2019t put us in the situation of -- of making unacceptable certain ways of warfare\nand torture and behavior. We -- we ti -- we say Amnesty International is wrong. They come in --\nthe Red Cross is bamboozled, just as they were by the Nazis. The Nazis came into the camps,\ninto some of those camps, and there is data that I have just seen this spring, actually, at Hoover,\nindicating what the men were told, what the soldiers were told, in order to dress up the camp so\nthat the Red Cross could come in and be impressed. How they had casual music groups, how\nthey had caf\u00e9s set up, they shipped half of the camp population off to another camp because they\n-- the -- otherwise the Red Cross would say you have too many people per square bed, or\nwhatever. Well, such as you might call it. It\u2019s unbelievable what these people did. And here, first\nperson accounts that I am now finding in the original languages about what the Nazis did in\norder to bamboozle the Red Cross. But we are in similar situations, uncomfortably similar\nsituations. And I can\u2019t live with this, I am finding this nightmarish. My daughter and I talk on the\nphone and we\u2019re either in tears, or we\u2019re so upset every phone call that I finally said to her,\nwe've got to put this off limits, we can\u2019t do this. Ic -- I can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t do this. But I am -- Iam\njust as bad as everybody else. I haven\u2019t done anything except signing petitions and trying to get\npeople to listen and read. But I haven\u2019t gone off in the street and demonstrated. I ha -- I don\u2019t\nknow what to do. And of course this -- this public relations campaign about making every\ndifference of opinion seem like an unpatriotic act has a very familiar ring to me. I heard this\nbefore. And there -- here we are celebrating 60 years til the end of the war. Where are we now?\nThat was the war to end all wars. So it tastes very bad.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s only bad because as I say, this -- this was -- this was our hope for the future. We\nwere not going to as a world, let this kind of thing happen again.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t see it as true, and I s-see such -- so many similar means. Yes, not all. You know,\nthere -- there aren\u2019t extermination camps, but we\u2019re doing many of the things 1n very similar\nways, that have to me a ring of danger. And I never thought that I would feel this way in this\ncountry, because -- and this is why I\u2019m such a strong believer in an absolutely free and\nindependent press. Because the press is the -- is the -- the only guide we have through darkness.\nAnd we depend on the press to lead us there so that we can ask the question and say to the\nadministration, how can you explain this? How can you explain that? And as long as there is\nlight on the subject, then you can stop it. But if you force people underground, you don\u2019t know\nwhat in God\u2019s name they\u2019re doing underground. You don\u2019t know what the Ku Klux Klan is\ndoing, what the neo-Nazis are doing, what the terrorists are doing if you force them underground.\nAnd if you -- if you contain the press and -- and sever its freedom, and -- or make it shut up and\nmake it become an arm of the government PR, then you can no longer trust the press to do that\nfor you.",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure if you were particularly interested in this last, but this is why I\u2019m feeling so -- I --\nI don\u2019t know what to do with my feelings about this. And -- and yet my commitment all through\nmy professional life has been to support Constitutional liberties, the Bill of Rights, to teach my\nstudents, both elementary teachers and high school students, the importance of listening and\nrespecting the opinions of the children in their classes, whether they abide by them or not. But\nthat the essence of a free society 1s to listen and respect.",
        "A: And you stop your respect at a certain point of course, if that other side is preaching your\ndeath, or somebody else\u2019s death, then you say, that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t have any compunction about\nsaying at a certain point that you have to restrain that freedom if that person or group 1s\npreaching that doctrine that certain people should be killed. But ne-nearly up to that point, I\u2019m\nsaying you -- this -- this is the only guide we have to remain a -- a country with the ideals that\npresumably we have led the world in and -- and have tried to teach others. I mean, what good 1s\nit to talk about democracy and then go in and behave the way we\u2019re doing and besides which\nthere\u2019s another piece of this teaching democracy, which right now I don\u2019t think this\nadministration has -- has reckoned with, and that is that if you really preach democracy, you may\nend up getting an election someplace with people that you don\u2019t really want. But if you believe\nin democracy, if that\u2019s what those people want, that\u2019s -- you have to respect that.",
        "A: But we -- we\u2019re not ready for that. Can\u2019t deal with that.\nBeginning Tape 10",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Boy and a girl. Girl and a boy, actually, in that order. Elizabeth Anne, and Daniel Eric. And --\nterrific kids.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: No --",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. No, there\u2019s -- there\u2019s no question about that, I -- I do think about that\nenormously. I -- I think all the ti -- and -- and also actually all the years that I was getting older\nand so forth, I kept thinking about what it must have been like for my mother -- when I was 45 or\nsomething. You know, I would think, oh my God, my mother was such and such and age, and\nthis is what was happening, and what would I do, and so forth. And I was also -- and I think I\nhad very strong, not only values, but ideas, and also at the same time, I think, wanted very much\nfor my children to have as normal -- whatever that really means, but as normal a childhood as\npossible. And so I -- I know I\u2019m veering off your question a little bit, but I felt on the one hand\nthat they needed to learn what I could express about this from a learning point of view. So we did\nvery little by way of Jewish tradition in the home, partly because I didn\u2019t like the pulling apart of\nsome members of the Jewish community and I didn\u2019t like the sort of exclusiveness that one\nparticular rabbi had -- had communicated. So we didn\u2019t really want our kids exposed to that, so\nours was by contrast a much more inclusive home, and there was -- it wa -- it\u2019s really interesting\nbecause I-Leas, my daughter has often said, you know, this community, or that community, or\nthis group of people is -- is really the example of the kind of values that you and Dad taught us.\nAnd so clearly there was a -- a -- a very clear understanding of what those values were. And so\nwe neither the kids likes this exclusiveness that some communities will -- will -- will send out,\nwill radiate. And at the same time, I didn\u2019t want them to have the burden that so many children\nof survivors seem to carry. And I got to know about that, because as I was speaking around, so\nmany of the people came to me and said, oh now I understand what my parents didn\u2019t want to\ntell me, or now I understand why it\u2019s so difficult to talk about the second World War, or\nwhatever, whatever, whatever. And likewise in Europe, where I\u2019ve spoken in a number of places,\nincluding Austria, to high school teachers, who said, we cannot speak to our parents, they will\nnot answer questions, they will not tell us where they were, and so on, or what they did. And at\nthe same time I see that this presents a special kind of burden, and I didn\u2019t want to have our kids\nhave that. Now this commitment to normalcy, is that sort of -- that\u2019s probably not that unusual, I\nimagine any parent wants only the happiest and the best f-for their kids, and it\u2019s not always the\nhappy situations that build character, necessarily, but at the same time I made sure that the kids\nhad a sense of -- of inclusiveness, of one world ideas about respect for other people. So much so\nthat the kids were actually quite -- took on an activist role in school on behalf of other kids. Not\nJewish kids, necessarily, but I -- you know, speaking up on behalf of someone that the teacher\nwas picking on. The teacher probably didn\u2019t even know he was doing it, and so on. And then\nalso, I think, reflecting on the present role of Israel, vis-a-vis the Palestinians, taking classes in\nIsraeli-Arab dispute. Trying to be informed and to not be afraid to express an opinion in\nopposition to the Israeli government. Sometimes putting themselves at -- on the outs with other\nJews, perhaps. But I felt that that was terribly, terribly important. Now the same goes for putting\nyourself out for some of these people. And so far, I have not been able to do that in a personal\nsense -- back to your original question, other than in the monetary sense. And w-we have as a\nfamily, and as -- and my husband and I personally, have made big commitments to IRC, the\nInternational Rescue Committee, which seems in a major way to be helping refugees without any\nrespect to what their country or their nationa -- their nationality or their religion 1s, but going to\nthose places in the world where people are desperate, where people are suffering because of\nwhat\u2019s going on, whether it\u2019s internal or external strife, and so on. So we have done as much as\nwe could, maybe not as much as we can do, but still hope to be able to continue to do, in those\nterms, which -- which are important. And my husband, especially, I think in a professional way,\nhas brought the plight of the refugees to students, involved students in the work that\u2019s necessary\nto save these people around the world. To do even small things, like volunteer to teach English\nas a second language in the local church or school, wherever the classes are being held. To -- one\nof -- one of -- wo -- actually she wasn\u2019t a student of mine at Hampshire, but a -- a na -- a student,\nwho became a student of Peter\u2019s, and worked in the refugee camps and extended herself to the\npoint of taking a small inheritance that she had from her grandmother, and bringing three\nCambodian women back, who had been raped and tortured and so forth. And adopting them,\nbringing them back, getting them settled, getting them set up. Yeah, we\u2019re not saving the world,\nbut we are trying, and -- and I think sometimes when I have this great urgent sense of why am I\nsitting here in a classroom, I think, well, somebody has to sit in the classroom and try to keep\npart of the mission going that -- that we have got to change, and how do we do that. And that not\neverybody can run in the field, and do the medical stuff, or do the actual whatever. And\nsomehow I\u2019ve often felt that in my small way, given the values that I think I\u2019ve been able to\ncommunicate, even at the level of simply teaching teachers to have respect for the child, which\nsounds as if it should be nothing anyone would argue about. But if you watch clearly, you see\nthat not every adult, and not every person who\u2019s teaching, has that respect for that child. Even if\nthey are church-going and religion loving, and anti-abortion and so forth. Respect for that other\nlife, and the fact that that life has a will and some sense and justification for some freedom is not\nthere a -- often, in spite of the espousal of these other, so-called values. So I feel sometimes that\nmaybe this is a rationalization, but it is something I do believe I could do, and I could do it quite\nwell. And so I felt that to throw in the towel was not the right thing for me to do, at least at tho --\nin those years of my life. I would like very much to be out in the field now, and -- and now 1s\nprobably not a good time, having since had cancer and so forth. And I have to say that when I\nwas first diagnosed with the cancer, a friend of mine said, oh Hedy, you\u2019re a survivor, you\u2019re\ngoing to make it. And I have to say, although I understood perfectly where she was coming from,\nI quietly said to myself, why do I have to keep proving it all the time? But I -- I feel now\nsomewhat medically compromised about going out in the field, but it is something that I thought\nabout. I thought seriously about joining the Peace Corps after my kids were grown. And -- and I\nstill remember the horrible, horrible feeling I had during the Kosovo time, and when there was\ntalk about the draft and my son was draft age, and I thought to myself -- and I didn\u2019t say it out\nloud, but I just was devastated with the thought that I lost the family behind me, and now I was\ngoing to lose the family in front of me. It was something I could barely confront myself. And\nnow I\u2019m looking at my grandson. And if this continues, he will be draft age. Jordy and Robert\nare the two sons of my son. And I-I just -- I can\u2019t face that. I just can\u2019t face that. I just can\u2019t face\nthat.",
        "A: So do I.",
        "A: You\u2019re welcome.",
        "A: Well that is my very proud, as you can see, school picture, of that one year that I spent in\nelementary school after the war. And I\u2019m growing my hair again, and so I\u2019ve got the beginnings\nof some skinny pigtails, and I\u2019m wearing a dress that came over in a package mailed from m-my\naunt and uncle from the States, in the classroom, at a desk. And behind me is probably a map of\nthe world, and on my head is one of those great big ribbons --",
        "A: -- that I was describing to you, with a special pin that allowed it to -- you didn\u2019t actually tie\nthe ribbon around the hair, you just created the bow effect, and then put this very special pin\naround it, you see, and then you clipped it to your hair. So that was my -- my -- my dressing up\nfor this -- this school picture.",
        "A: And -- and tha -- it was a happy time, and you can see there was --",
        "A: And that picture is one of the first probably informal snapshots of my husband-to-be and\nmyself, when I was working as a counselor in th -- in the camp that his parents owned at the\ntime, and which we then ran later on, and -- and directed for many years. At the time I think he\nwas a Senior -- going into his senior year in high school and I was going -- no, I\u2019m sorry, he was\nthe senior in college, and I was a senior in high school. Or it could have been the following\nsummer, which would have had us -- would have had him in graduate school, beginning graduate\nschool, and have me beginning college. I don\u2019t remember which of the two summers that might\nhave been, but we were together -- now almost 50 years. I mean, 50 years we\u2019ve been together,\nbut next year is our 50\" anniv -- wedding anniversary. And that is a picture -- and I don\u2019t know\nwho took these, by the way, either of these two, but they -- we were given copies of the\nsnapshots and the lower one was in my husband\u2019s wallet for many, many years, and my daughter\nnow has put in a special request for a copy. The one above is probably the same year or well,\nprobably not actually, cause I see that I had long hair, sort of pigtail like in the bottom picture, so\nit was probably still that first summer. The upper one my hair is short, and I\u2019m thinking this is\nprobably around 1960, and we now have been married a couple of years. I\u2019m running the camp\nalong with Peter, and I think I have one child at that time. Tho -- this is just a casual snapshot,\nsitting on the lawn at the camp in one of those Adirondack chairs. And that picture is struggling\nwith the bags, it looks like to me. I think we were coming from an extended stay in Italy at the\nBellagio Study Center, hence all those bags, because we usually don\u2019t have that many bags.",
        "A: I think that\u2019s not correct --",
        "A: -- but we were also in Norway for some period of time. Peter was teaching the American\nstudies program up in Norway, and that would have been sort of 90 s -- 1971, but I don\u2019t think\nthis is from Norway, I think this was coming from Bellagio 1n -- in Italy.",
        "A: And it was hot and humid, and I was -- it\u2019s one of many, many, many travels that we\u2019ve done\ntogether, and also that we\u2019ve done with the kids, both of whom have an enormous appreciation\nof o-other people and other lands, and other ways of living and behaving and so on.",
        "A: I think this is more like early 80\u2019s, but I -- I could be wrong, it could b -- it could be late 70\u2019s.",
        "A: The reason I think it\u2019s early 80\u2019s is because I think my daughter had already graduated and\nwas living in Italy at this time, but I\u2019m not positive. But I do think that was mislabeled. And I\nhope it wasn\u2019t in a book, therefore. But yeah, no, thi -- I\u2019m sorry about the passport picture,\nbecause had I been able to -- to bring that, I would have loved to have had you see that.

        "A: So I must have been given the sweater -- and not for keeps, but because I was allowed\noutside, and -- and Holland is generally --",
        "A: -- chilly.",
        "A: And of course, having just been so sick, they weren\u2019t a-about to take chances, but I was\nallowed to get in the air, and I was so weak that I was on this -- this settee thing. And I don\u2019t\neven know who it was who came to the hospital to take that passport picture.",
        "A: But -- but they did, and I -- I\u2019m so happy that I have that picture, because again, that -- that\nmeant to me this enormous sense of gratefulness to this U.S. surplus stuff, this wonderful, warm,\nwooly sweater that I could have. And it was cold during the war, we had no heat, and I -- all\nthose memories were very close to that time that passport picture was taken.",
        "A: And -- and this picture as well. I don\u2019t know what the book is that I have opened on the desk,\nbut it\u2019s -- it\u2019s kind of fun to look at myself with that expression on my face, and it sort of like\nall\u2019s well with the world again, you know, it\u2019s sort of like, now here I am where I\u2019ve been\nwanting to be all this time.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. And that\u2019s -- and that -- the -- and the picture that -- a-again, I don\u2019t have it, but I have\na picture of my sister and me together at this time as well, and there is not a sparkle in her eye,\nbut there is a kind of gentle being at peace kind of thing. It 1s not a distressing face, but it\u2019s not a\nsparkle, necessarily. But there is a sense of -- I -- I -- I -- to me again, there\u2019s a sense of some --\nsomething having come to rest in a way, in her probably more than me, looking forward to the --\nto going to the United States.\n"
