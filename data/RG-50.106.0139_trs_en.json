        "Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Helen Goldkind, conducted by Gail Schwartz on\nFebruary 21, 2001 in Bethesda, Maryland. This interview is part of the museum\u2019s\nproject to interview Holocaust survivors and witnesses who are also volunteers\nwith the museum. This is a follow up interview that will focus on Helen\nGoldkind\u2019s post-Holocaust experiences. In preparation for this interview, I read\nthe detailed summaries of the interview you conducted with the Jewish Community\nCouncil of Greater Washington on January 9\", 1985 on audio, and the video\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview on January 16\", 1990. I\nwill not ask you to repeat everything you said in those interviews. Instead, I will\nuse this interview as an opportunity to follow up and focus on your post-Holocaust\nexperiences. This 1s tape number one, side A. What is your full name?",
        "Answer: My name is Helen Goldkind.",
        "Q: And your maiden name?",
        "A: Was Helen Lebowitz.",
        "Q: And where were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Czechoslovakia in a small town by -- Volosyanka.",
        "Q: And when were you born?\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "A: I was born in 1928, July the ninth.",
        "Q: You\u2019ve already gone in detail in your previous interview, so before we begin, I\nwill summarize some o-of your experiences. You came from a large, religiously\nobservant family, of which you were the sixth of seven children, and you had many\nextended relatives. When the Germans occupied the town in 1944, you and your\nfamily were forced into a ghetto and then after one or two months transported by\ncattle car to Auschwitz. You and your sister Sylvia, who was three and a half years\nolder than you were in Auschwitz for five weeks. And the other members there of\nyour family did not survive. Then with a group of 1,000 girls, you and Sylvia were\ntaken to Germany to work in an ammunition factory, being exposed to the burning\ngun powder. You were then transported to Bergen-Belsen where you were\nliberated by the British on April 15\", 1945. Before we continue, I\u2019d like to clarify\nsome things. How would you describe yourself as a child? This is, of course,\nbefore the war. Were you very independent, were you physically strong? How\nwould you -- what would you say you were?",
        "A: Well, I think I was very strong and that probably saved my life when I got to\nAuschwitz.",
        "Q: Were you very independent?",
        "A: Well, when you\u2019re in a family of seven, you got to be independent.",
        "Q: Did you have a close relationship with your sister Sylvia before the war?\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "A: Yes. We were a close-knit family. I was very close to my whole family.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And with your parents, before conditions got worse, were they the\nkind of people that you could talk things over with?",
        "A: Absolutely. Now looking back on it, I think my parents were trying to hide\nmany things from me, that things will get better. I mean, I remember when they\nwere saying, honey, don\u2019t worry. Things will get better.",
        "Q: When Hitler came into power in 1933 and until the Germans occupied your --\nyour country, did your life change in any way? Preceding the time that the\nGermans occupied your town.",
        "A: Well, Czechoslovakia became Hungaria in 1939. It had changed somewhat,\nbut not to the extent what has happened in 19 f -- when the Germans came.",
        "Q: So life went on for you, relatively the same?",
        "A: Not the same at all. Was not --",
        "Q: What -- what were some of the changes?",
        "A: Well, I think the Jewish kids did not have the same opportunity going to school\nas the non-Jewish kids, where -- and I lived under the Czechs, my uncle was a\nCzech officer, and after we'll be finished with this interview, I\u2019ll show you a\npicture of him. So th-that -- that we lost. And we started sort of educating ourselves\non our own. What happened was we were allowed to go to school, but we wal --\nwe had to sit in the back and we were never called on. So what my father did is he\nFebruary 21, 2001\ngot a -- a teacher and we -- we s -- he -- he -- he was teaching us. And after awhile,\nthe whole communities, you know, the Jewish kids came to our house. So when a -\n- | think back, I feel like our house became the school, actually.",
        "Q: What was it like for you as a young person to experience anti-Semitism? What\ndid it mean to you as a young child?",
        "A: Well, when you\u2019re young you don\u2019t understand a lot of things. Here you had\nfriends today and tomorrow you lost them, and you wondered why. And that was\nvery painful for me.",
        "Q: And did you talk this over with your -- your siblings or your parents?",
        "A: We did. We constantly talked about it because we worried about it. But we were\nalways living in hope that things will get better, but they didn't get better, they got\nworse.",
        "Q: Did you know earlier that -- what was happening to the Jews in other countries,\nbefore the germ -- like all of this is before the German occupation of your town.\nDid you know what was happening?",
        "A: Well, you know, we had a radio and that was taken away from us. So people,\nsome people took a chance in keeping their radios, but you could have been\npunished for it. So we gave our radio away. But there was some people took the --\na chance on keeping it, so during the night they would be listening to the news. So\nFebruary 21, 2001\nthe news would come through, but we -- we -- we couldn\u2019t understand, we didn\u2019t\nunderstand how severe the tragedy was.",
        "Q: Did you have any other interests? You were still young, but besides school, did\nyou -- music or reading, anything th-that you did to occupy your time besides\nschoolwork?",
        "A: Constantly reading. Matter of fact, I loved books and well, actually our house\nal-always was full of books. And I had a little brother, he was six years old, and he\nhad a little book, they called it \u201cAll of Base,\u201d it\u2019s a ABC book and poor kid, he\nwas carrying this book with him until he came to Auschwitz and they told him to\nthrow this little book into a -- the -- the pit there. It was very difficult for him, he\ncried a lot about it, but --",
        "Q: And when it was time for you to have to wear a yellow star, what were your\nfeelings about that?",
        "A: My feelings were awful. I feared for every minute. At that time, no matter how\nmy parents wanted to protect me, it just was right there in front of me. I could no\nlonger -- I'll -- Pll never forget that. I -- my uncle gave me a quarter to go and get\nmyself ice cream, to a place where I used to go and get this ice cream, it was a big\ntreat for a child. And I got there -- at a certain time, we couldn\u2019t walk out of the\nhouse, I believe 1t was between five and six. And I got there, they told me they\nFebruary 21, 2001\ncannot sell me the ice cream because I was a Jewish child. Came home crying and\nI didn\u2019t understand it. So the pain was there.",
        "Q: So what do older relatives say to children your age to comfort them?",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: You -- wha-what did your relatives say to comfort you when these things\nhappened?",
        "A: There was very little to comfort me because everything was staring in my face.\nHow -- what could they say to me when a little kid comes home crying they didn't\nget a ice cream, even though I had my quarter. It was -- it was sad.",
        "Q: Yeah. Was the yellow star sewn on your coat, or pinned?",
        "A: Yes. No, on my arm.",
        "Q: It -- it was an armband?",
        "A: An armband, yes.",
        "Q: While you were in the camps, you had said that your sister kept you going.\nWhere do you think she got her strength from? What do you attribute that to?",
        "A: Well, when we parted in Auschwitz, I don\u2019t know if I should mention\nAuschwitz, how we parted. Can I an --",
        "Q: Absolutely.",
        "A: Well, when we got to Auschwitz, we came with the whole family and my --\nyou know, my parents -- but the two older brothers were taken away already for\nFebruary 21, 2001\nwork, to s-s -- t -- t-to the Russian front where they were picking mines. And my\nfather, and I had an older sister, and she took care of my grandmother, and my\ngrandfather came and my little brother and my mother and my sister that survived.\nIn Auschwitz they pushed my mother with my sister because she looked fairly\nyoung, but they pulled my little brother out of her hand. So my mother heard him\ncry, so she ran back to him and pleaded with the Germans to -- to let her go with\nmy little brother and they beat her up, and after she was bleeding, and they kicked\nher into the left lane. And she was screaming, please tell the world what is\nhappening to us, if you survive. Try to survive. Actually her words were like that,\ntry to survive, and if you do, tell the world what happened here. And of course, you\nknow, my grandfather also had a terrible experience there. I don\u2019t know if I can go\non talking about it.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Can I talk about it?",
        "Q: Whatever you wish.",
        "A: Okay. Well, my grandfather came -- well, they took him from home. He -- he\nhad the Torah scroll with him, because when they closed our synagogues, he\nmanaged to take out a Torah scroll. So our house became a school and I think his\nhouse became a house of worship. And when they told us we have to leave the\nhouse, he took the Torah scroll with him. And when we got to Auschwitz, he came\nFebruary 21, 2001\ndown from the train with this Torah scroll and they made -- they -- they told him to\n-- to throw the Torah scroll into the ditch and he wouldn\u2019t do that, so you know, he\n-- they were beating on him and we ran over to him and pleaded with him, please,\nplease throw the Torah scroll down and he just wouldn\u2019t do it and they kept on\nbeating on him and then th -- they really -- you know, they beat him to death and\nright in front of us he fell with the Torah scrolls, and -- so we saw this tragedy right\nin front of us, and I think in -- that\u2019s what f -- then they took my grandfather and\nthey threw him in a truck. And I think she kept that in mind all the time, that she\nneeds -- she has a need to tell this to someone. And that -- I think that -- that made\nher stronger, to say I have to survive to tell it to someone what happened, because I\ndon\u2019t think they\u2019 Il believe it.",
        "Q: Were there any other examples of women helping other women in the camp\nwhile you were there? Can you -- do you know of any other situations? Your sister,\nof course, helped you. Did you see that relationship between any other women, or\nother women to you?",
        "A: Well, you must understand, when people are put in a situation where survival is\nthe only thing, so it was very difficult to help each other because we were all in the\nsame boat, with the same thing. But we -- we did try. You know, if we saw\nsomebody fainted we were there for them, of course. But there was nothing we\nreally can do to help them, they probably, you know, they were fainting out of\nFebruary 21, 2001\nhunger or -- or weakness. And it was -- it was very, very difficult. It wasn\u2019t that\none had more than the other to be able to help each other, it wasn\u2019t like that. When\nmy sister tried keeping me alive when I was giving up, she just gave away her little\npiece of bread. You know, she like bribed me, sort of, to -- to want to -- to want to\nsurv -- you know, that I should survive. But I -- I -- I think what happened to me, I\nemotionally did not want to do it any more. And a -- and a -- of course, I was very\nweak because I had to work so hard in the munition factory.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. When you were in -- in the camps, did you talk about what was going\non with the other women, outside of your sister?",
        "A: We saw it. We were right there with them, we were in one barrack.",
        "Q: But I meant, did you exchange feelings with each other, the other women?",
        "A: I think everybody was just numb, and everybody -- everybody just didn\u2019t\nunderstand what is happening because we -- we weren\u2019t treated as human beings\nany more. So --",
        "Q: Were you with women from your town, or were you with women from other\ntown -- towns and villages when you were in Auschwitz?",
        "A: When I was in Auschwitz, the time when I was in Auschwitz, I was there with\na lady and my next door neighbor and her daughter. And I don\u2019t remember,\nsomebody else there. But then when they took us to work they took them\nsomeplace else and they took me and my sister someplace else.\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "Q: What -- what was the -- or -- the name of the munitions factory? Do you know\nwhere -- where in Germany it was, or what the name was?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t. I should really find out because it\u2019ll -- probably I have to -- I -- I -\n- | -- I\u2019ve -- I\u2019m going to try to find out where it was, but I don\u2019t think it was far\nfrom Bergen-Belsen. It wasn\u2019t far from Bergen-Belsen, but I don\u2019t reme -- I-I just\ndon\u2019t know, you know. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Now, you were almost 17 years old when you were liberated by the British. Did\nyou know what those tanks meant when you saw them at the time of -- the British\ntanks? What -- what did it mean to you to see them?",
        "A: Well -- well let me tell you first what position we were in. We -- we were full of\nlife, we were thrown in with other people that were half dead, and 1 -- I was burned\nup from the m -- from -- from the spring stuff. From the gunpowder, or whatever, I\n-- | remember it was yellow and very hot and while I was filling these bombs, you\nknow, of course some of it went on top of me. So we were really like half dead.\nBut my sister, you know, she noticed them first. And I sa -- you know, so she tells\nme, you know, there are some tanks out there and they don\u2019t look like they\u2019re\nGerman tanks. So I said to her, you know, maybe this is the end and things will be\nbetter. So she says, it\u2019ll be probably be better for the world, but for us it\u2019s too late.\nSo when the Germans came, we really didn\u2019t have the strength to be happy and --",
        "Q: When the British came, yeah.\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "A: When the British came, that my -- yeah. They came a little bit too late for m --\nactually for a lot of people. My -- when they came my sister was already sick in\nthat room, I remember she was delirious. And then the British opened up the\nbarracks, and when they looked into the barracks, it was terrible because they\nwouldn\u2019t let us out to the bathrooms. Everybody was doing everything they needed\nat -- in the barracks and a | -- a lot of them were very sick. It just -- they opened --\nthey probably thought it was worse -- it was -- really was worse than a crazy house.\nSo they were asking us what they can do for us, and they tried very hard to help us,\nbut as I said, it was a little too late. They took my sister and I didn\u2019t know where sh\n-- they took her. So she didn\u2019t return a few days, I went out to look for her because\nat that ti -- after the English came in they posted names who died in Bergen-\nBelsen and I couldn\u2019t find her. But the sight ve seen in Bergen-Belsen | still have\nnightmares about it.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: These big mountains of -- of corpse and everything. Anyway, I couldn\u2019t find my\nsister\u2019s name, but in the meantime I fell somewheres there on the street. I -- I don\u2019t\nremember how they picked me up and how I got to the hospital. They took me to\nthe hospital but I don\u2019t remember nothing of that. [phone ringing]",
        "Q: What languages did you speak then? What -- what did you understand? Did you\nunderstand German at that point, or English?\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "A: No, we spoke -- we spoke j -- Yiddish and Czech.",
        "Q: So when the British came, you did not understand them.",
        "A: No, I -- we didn't. No, I didn\u2019t. But -- but you know, you could see that they\nwanted to help us.",
        "Q: How could you tell?",
        "A: Oh, because they acted different than the Nazis did.",
        "Q: In what way?",
        "A: They acted like human beings, where the Nazis acted like they were monsters,\nin every which way. In every which way.",
        "Q: Did you, at the -- at that point think about going back to your hometown?",
        "A: Not when I got sick, when -- I-I was in Bergen-Belsen for a few weeks in the\nhospital because I got typhoid, it\u2019s a high fever, and --",
        "Q: What was your physical condition at the time of liberation?",
        "A: Horrible. It wa -- you know, I -- best to describe me as I looked like a skeleton\nwith a heartbeat. I mean, in a short -- it was awful the way I looked like. You\nknow, I weighed -- I don\u2019t even know how much I weigh -- I -- I was like a\nskeleton taken out of the earth.",
        "Q: Di-Did you know what you looked like? Could -- did you ever see yourself?",
        "A: Of course, I-I was so weak, I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t breathe, I couldn\u2019t eat, I mi -\n- | mean I couldn\u2019t eat, and I was sick, you know, I got sick. Got sick. I don\u2019t even\nFebruary 21, 2001\nremember how I got to the hospital, I just fell there fro -- on the street and what\nhappened was the ambulances were going around the s -- these s -- the street -- on\nthe streets and whoever, yet whoever\u2019s heart was beating, even though they looked\nlike they are dead, they were picking them up and trying to save them. And so I\nwound up in the hospital and I-I just -- after many, many weeks -- I remember\nasking for my sister, not for my family, because I -- I was just heartbroken that she\nwas tr -- you know, she didn\u2019t want to s -- she would tell me that I have to survive\nbecause she doesn\u2019t want to stay -- be alone. And after all that, I found myself\nalone. So I was crying all the time and they asked me why -- you know, I\u2019m crying.\nI says, I had a sister and she died here and I wa -- in Bergen-Belsen. So they really\nput an effort in to look whether she\u2019s dead or she\u2019s someplace. And you know,\nthey found her in another hospital. They had these makeshift hospitals and she was\nvery weak and I was very weak and sick, but they put us together.",
        "Q: What was that like to -- to get together with her again?",
        "A: It was like giving someone life, because I again didn\u2019t think [indecipherable]\nsurviving. You know, even though I was liberated, I still -- because I knew what\nhappened. I -- I didn't want to believe it too much, but we knew already what\nhappened, so --",
        "Q: You were saying that your sister Sylvia had said that you, Helen, had to stay\nalive because she didn\u2019t want to be alone. Can you talk a little more about that?\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "A: Well, one day I just didn't want to go out to the c\u2019est appel because I just\ndidn\u2019t have the strength and it was cold. So I was laying there and she saw not\ngetting up, she lifted me up and she started shaking me. So I thought that she went\ncrazy or something. And she says, you know, you\u2019re not going to leave me alone.\nAnd because she knew by the time she would come back, I -- they would do away\nwith me. And I got up and I went to the c\u2019est Pappel and she was trying to hold\nonto me so I shouldn\u2019t collapse out there and dragged me to work and then she\ncame to help me out. She was running back and forth and I didn't think she\u2019ll\nsurvive, you know, to help me a little bit, hard job. And that\u2019s how it went.",
        "Q: Before the war, did you -- di-did she exhibit these -- this strength that she had\nduring the war, in any way? Were there any situations pre-war that she showed\nhow strong she was?",
        "A: Ye -- I think she -- she -- she did show some strength, but I really don\u2019t think\nthat that would have kept her alive. I think it\u2019s the idea of what she saw and the\nmessage from my mother, I think that kept her alive. I -- I really think so, cause I\nsaw stronger people and just not the su -- not survive.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. So when you and she were together, did you talk about going\nback home?",
        "A: In the hospital?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know what we want to do. But what happened was the Swedish Red\nCross agreed on taking in the very sick ones to Sweden and we were lucky and we\nwere picked because we were very sick. And then when we got to Sweden, I --\nthere was another shocker, for me anyway, because I think I almost lost my o --\nbelief in humanity. And when they took over, I -- again, I hate to repeat myself, I\nlooked like -- I still looked like a skeleton because I was so sick, and they nurtured\nme, they bathed me, they fed me, I had no strength to eat. And I was looking at\nthem that maybe they\u2019re not on this earth, they -- they -- that they -- they just came\nfrom heaven or something. It\u2019s hard to describe. It is very hard to describe my\nfeeling when I got to Sweden. I -- every time, every day I get up, I bless them,\ncause you know, I -- I think that if I would have to take care of myself and I would\nhave a normal life, I wouldn\u2019t want to take of me, because the way I looked.",
        "Q: When -- before you left for Sweden, had you and your sister ever talked about\ngoing to Palestine? Did -- was that something important to you or your family?",
        "A: Well, the f -- the things that I remember in Europe, they had the chalutzim,\nthey called these kids chalutzim, but don\u2019t forget, we were -- I-I was next to the\nyoungest, which was six years old and then she was, so my father was trying to get\nthe older ones to 1 -- to Israel, but 1-1-1 -- you know, it was closed. Y-You had to\nwait for a quota, you know. Ou-Ou-Our -- our life was like, you know, they -- how\nFebruary 21, 2001\nshall I say? There was no place to go. Even we knew the horrible things, but there\nwas nothing to do and no place to go.",
        "Q: Had your parents, pre-war, been strong Zionists?",
        "A: Yes, they have. Even though they were religious, but they have, yeah, yeah.\nYeah.",
        "Q: So, let\u2019s talk a little bit about Sweden now. So there you are with your sister.\nAre you with anybody else that you knew, pre-war or during the war?",
        "A: Yeah, it was so funny. I was in Sweden -- wi -- the [indecipherable] I-I --\nwhen I was in be -- I have to backtrack a little. When I was in Bergen-Belsen\nlooking for my -- for my sister, I saw a man that was pulled by the ankles, because\nthey thought he was dead. And I took a look at him and I -- it looked like my\ncousin, and I was yelling to him, Freddie, Freddie and he opened up his eyes. But\nof course then I collapsed, I don\u2019t remember anything. So when I saw my sister, I\nsays, you know, I -- Freddie is alive and he -- he -- I saw him Bergen-Belsen, they\nwere pulling him on that mountain with the dead. She says, oh, you were sick, you\ndon\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. So at this point I really don\u2019t know whether\nit was Freddie or it wasn\u2019t Freddie. He was the one that was very sick and they\ntook him to Sweden too, and we met him there in Sweden.",
        "Q: What -- what was it like to see another member of your family?\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "A: Oh, you -- you wouldn\u2019t believe that. His name was Milbauer and our name\nwas Lebowitz. So when we met him, we were so scared that we\u2019re going to be\nseparated again that he says, I\u2019m going to become Lebowitz and they\u2019 re not going\nto separate me. So what happened was he became Lebowitz, he says he is\nLebowitz and we were there together as Lebowitz\u2019s. But then my sister found me\nin the papers in -- in Brooklyn. They took our names and they asked us whether\nwe have anybody out of Europe and I knew I had a sister. So, she found us in the\npapers, but --",
        "Q: When had this -- what was your sister\u2019s name in Brooklyn?",
        "A: My sister\u2019s name in Brooklyn, Arler. But wi -- she was mar --",
        "Q: Her first -- her first name?",
        "A: First name was Frances.",
        "Q: And -- and when did Frances leave to go to the United States?",
        "A: Just before the war in 1938. I had an uncle there and we were begging to be,\nyou know, taken out, but he didn\u2019t want to -- you know, he couldn\u2019t take out nine\npeople, because it was -- you know, it was very difficult. So he took my sister out.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Helen Goldkind. This is tape number one, side\nFebruary 21, 2001\nB. And you were talking about how your sister was in Brooklyn, and you and your\n-- and you and your sister Sylvia was in -- were in Sweden.",
        "A: Right. So then she sent us affidavits. Now here is the problem with my cousin,\nbec -- he -- he was Lebowitz and he had a -- a -- a aunt in -- 1 -- also in Brooklyn.\nSo her name was Milbauer. So there was a big problem because he had to change\nhis name in Sweden to Milbauer in order for them to send an affidavit. So he\nremained in Sweden for awhile, and then that aunt of his sent him an affidavit and\nhe came out to the United States.",
        "Q: When you were in Sweden, and you were with other survivors who were being\ntaken care of the way you were being taken care of, did you and they talk about\nwhat your wartime experiences were? Did you share with others what you and\nyour family had gone through while you -- during the war, while you were in\nSweden\u2019?",
        "A: Actually no, because -- I didn\u2019t talk about it for a long time. It was very\ndifficult. It was very, very, very difficult. And then when we were in Sweden a-\nafter we were in that sanitarium, I -- we felt better, of course. They fed us and they\nmade u -- you know, they gave us dark beer, I remember. A -- you know, just to\ngain some weight. And then we got s -- I got separated from my sister and I wasn\u2019t\nso happy about it, but they were explaining me and reassuring me that I was -- they\nsays I was under-aged and I have to go to a school, and my sister went to work. But\nFebruary 21, 2001\nthey treated her very nice. I mean, they paid her for her work, and -- and life was\nvery good in 1s -- in Sweden.",
        "Q: So di -- di -- you did not live with her once you got out of the hospital?",
        "A: No. I was in Fielgarden and she was in Goteborg.",
        "Q: And how did you stay in contact with her?",
        "A: Oh, we -- we could -- you know, we could write to each other. We had our 1 --\nwe lived normal, you know, it was a normal life, you know, to each other. And she\nknew where I was and I knew where she was and --",
        "Q: Was it hard to be away from her after all you had been through?",
        "A: Very. Very. But you know what happened to us, all the girls? I mean, all these\ngirls that I was with in school, I don\u2019t remember how many we were there --",
        "Q: This is school in Sweden?",
        "A: Right. In Fielgarden. And we became like sisters, and we -- you know,\neverybody lost everything, so we would say to each other, you know, we\u2019re going\nto be sisters now. And we did things together and we were -- I think we were ev --\ntrying to be even closer than sisters, you know. So it was wonderful, 1t was\nwonderful. Our teachers were great. They -- they tried being like our parents, more\nor less, too.",
        "Q: Did you live in a dormitory or in people\u2019s homes?\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "A: No, I lived in a dormitory, yeah. But we were maybe seven, eight kids in a\ndormitory, but -- but there were -- you know, there -- more -- there were a lot -- a\nlot of kids. It was like a house and it had these different rooms, yeah. It was --",
        "Q: And -- and what did you -- did you study Swedish, or English? What did you\nstudy?",
        "A: I studied English and Hebrew, and everything else, math and all these other\nthings that ne -- you know, that I missed.",
        "Q: Who were the teachers?",
        "A: The teachers were also survivors and they were teachers before, and they\nvolunteered to do that. Of course they were taken care of, they g -- you know, they\nhad shelter and food. They gave us -- you know, they fed us very nicely and it was\na beautiful place.",
        "Q: Did they teach you Swedish at all?",
        "A: Not really. We tried talking Swedish sort of, but 1-1-it -- it -- 1t wasn\u2019t -- I think\nthey had other plans for us. I don\u2019t know if the Swedish at that time took us in to be\ntheir citizens. I think they took us in there to take care of us, but I don\u2019t even\nremember or I don\u2019t even know what the deal was with them. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Now, at that time, did you and your sister talk about going back to your town at\nall?\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "A: Sa -- some people did try to tell us that it would be nice if we would come back.\nBut we -- we really felt in our hearts that we have no place there. We had no place\nthere.",
        "Q: And what made you think that?",
        "A: Well, all that that we had to go through from 1939 til -- to -- until the Germans\ncame. I mean, it wasn't just the Germans, it was how our life changed even before\nthe Germans. See, Czechoslovakia was sort of a -- tried to be a democracy in\nEurope. But the rest of the countries were -- you know, everybody made their own\nrules and their own laws, especially in the war. It wa -- you know, we knew we --\nwe -- we were pointed out as Jews, that we are not wanted there, but we had no\nplace to go. The world was closed for us.",
        "Q: Did you feel Czech at that time, or Jewish? How would you have described\nyourself?",
        "A: Well, I was very small in 30 -- how old was I in \u201939?",
        "Q: 11.",
        "A: 11. Well, I knew that I\u2019m Jewish because I -- I -- I -- you know, as I said, that\nwe had -- we -- we -- we were religious. But I loved being where I was, in the\nposition I was in, because I had a big family, I had my own support system, and I --\nI -- I -- we didn\u2019t experience the anti-Semitism that much, because a Jewish child\nFebruary 21, 2001\ncould, if -- 1f he was really smart, he could reach to be educated. But later on it was\nclosed completely.",
        "Q: Oh. So you -- you felt Czech also, besides being Jewish?",
        "A: Oh, definitely. If anything I -- I wanted to be Czech and nobody else -- I mean, I\n-- | was Jewish and I always feel like I want to be Jewish. But the Czech, yes, but\nnot the rest of them.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. And then when I -- it became a part of Hungary, did you feel\nany Hungarian connection?",
        "A: We -- not -- it\u2019s hard for me to explain because I was a child and I was trying\nnot to be -- I mean, y-y-you know, in a child you sort of try to see the bright side of\nit, see? But you know, I couldn\u2019t help feeling that I was not accepted. The only\nthing I think that really saved me is because, you know, my large family, as a child.\nI didn\u2019t feel -- I didn\u2019t need the outside to accept me and love me because my own\nfamily did that for me.",
        "Q: How long were you in Sweden, you and your sister?",
        "A: I was there over a year, yeah.",
        "Q: And then you said your -- your aunt tried to arrange for you to come to the\nUnited States?",
        "A: My s -- my sister.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, your sister.\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "A: My sister. And then it took no time, I think we were the first ones from the\nsurvivors to come out here to the United States. I think it took her maybe four or\nfive, a half a year maybe, and we were here after she contacted the Red Cross in --\nin Sweden.",
        "Q: Did you want to come to the United States?",
        "A: Well, I had a big problem again, you know, I didn\u2019t want to leave my sisters\nthere, you know, because I already connected with them. And I thought I\u2019m going\nto spend my life with them, they\u2019re gir -- my family. So --",
        "Q: Oh, these are the other survive -- when you say sisters you mean there this --",
        "A: The other survivors -- children.",
        "Q: -- the other survivors.",
        "A: Although I knew -- I remembered her, that she\u2019s my real sister, you know, here\nin the United States, Frances was my real sister. But believe me, if I would be\ngiven a choice, I think at that time I would have rather just stay with my family, the\nm -- with my friends. Because, I says, whatever will happen to them, it\u2019Il happen to\nme, because I no longer had a home and I didn't know what -- where I am, where\nI\u2019m going to be. And it felt comfortable to be with these girls. But of course, you\nknow, my sister says, look, she 1s our sister and she wants us out there, and we\nhave to go, and we went.\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "Q: So how di -- what was it like to say goodbye to these friends, these sister\nfriends?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t easy. I tell you, it wasn\u2019t easy. I tell you 1t wasn\u2019t easy. We kept on\npromising each other we\u2019ll -- let\u2019s be in touch, we want to know about each other.\nAnd I was in touch with many of them, and then, you know, after years go by, you\nlose touch, and you see a different world. You see that they were your friends, and\n-- you know? And we came va -- when I came out here I-I had a terrible -- both of\nus, I think we had little breakdowns. Because you know, when I saw a man witha\nbeard, I would say, 1s he -- you know, I s -- how come he wasn\u2019t destro -- you\nknow, it was -- e -- if I her -- if I heard a kid cry, I thought he\u2019s being destroyed,\nnot that he\u2019s unhappy. I had a difficult time. I had such a difficult time when I\ncame out here, you can -- you can\u2019t imagine. The -- what can I tell you? What can I\ntell you? It was very difficult for both of us, even though, you know, to be with my\nsister, but was difficult. Then reality set in, you see? While you\u2019re on the road, you\nsort of survive every day. But when you knew this was your last place that you\u2019re\ngoing to, it\u2019s -- reality set in and we realized we lost everybody and everything, I\nthink this is when we s -- really started mourning, to tell you the truth, when we got\nhere. Yeah.",
        "Q: When you were -- so you ca -- how did you come to the United States?",
        "A: We -- well, as I said, my sister sent us the papers, and --\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "Q: Yeah -- no, did you come by boat?",
        "A: Yes. With th -- I think it was the United States. I forgot the name of the boat --\nwith a boat.",
        "Q: And -- and when -- when was that?",
        "A: When was that?",
        "Q: Was it 1946?",
        "A: I don\u2019t even remember, I co -- have to look it up. I don\u2019t remember whether it\nwas \u00b046 or not [indecipherable] in between. Do you want me to --",
        "Q: No, that\u2019s okay. And so you -- you c-came by boat and you landed where?",
        "A: In Brooklyn. Na -- na -- in broo -- you know, I di -- we saw the Statue of\nLiberty. It wasn\u2019t Brooklyn, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s --",
        "Q: Ellis Island?",
        "A: Ellis Island. Ellis Island, you know.",
        "Q: Had you seen pictures of the Statue of Liberty before?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: Did you know what it represented?",
        "A: Well, I was told on the boat, I was told. I was told on the boat.",
        "Q: Was the boat filled with survivors?\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I do -- I don\u2019t think so. Because we came from Sweden and there\nweren\u2019t that many survivors in Sweden. I don\u2019t think so. No, they weren't all\nSUIVIVOTS.",
        "Q: And so then you -- you got to -- you landed. What was like to -- to put your foot\ndown on American soil?",
        "A: A miracle, to ex -- describe it, really. A miracle, because 1-1t took me, at that\ntime -- when I got to the United States it looked like it\u2019s the world. And when I\nwas in Europe, I -- I thought I\u2019m in hell. That\u2019s how I compared it. I don\u2019t know\nhow else to describe it. I don\u2019t know. But I was just thinking, I don\u2019t think hell\ncould be that bad.",
        "Q: Oh. Hm. Who -- and your sister met you at the boat?",
        "A: Yes, she met us at the boat. She had two kids, beautiful, beautiful, two boys and\n-- but you know, she wasn\u2019t a wealthy woman, so she took us in to her apartment,\nshe had a one bedroom apartment, walking up three flights. But she was so happy\nto have us there and we were so happy to be there together. I remember we slept in\nthe living room on a bed that closed up, you know, because she couldn\u2019t keep it\nopen, then the kids wouldn\u2019t have where to play. But it was very nice. I mean, you\nknow, she was just wonderful, she was just wonderful. And, you know, I wanted to\ngo to school but I saw that I had to go and provide for myself. You know, you\ncouldn\u2019t help seeing it. So, I went to school at night and I went to look -- actually, I\nFebruary 21, 2001\nthink what really saved me from not mourning there forever is because I knew I\nhave to get out and get a job. And so I tried getting a job, and you know, I wasn\u2019t\ntrained for anything, and I -- I -- although I-I-I was learning how to speak English\nfor n -- for close to a year, but still -- I understood most of it but I couldn\u2019t speak it\ntoo well. So there are so many drawbacks for me to get a job. Well, 1t took me\nabout two, three weeks going every day. My brother-in-law, he would take me and\npaid for my carfare, for my token because I had no money. And I was going around\nand he helped me, he came with me at times, and they were telling me they would\nlove to hire me, but I\u2019m not trained for anything. And of course, you know, when I\ncame from Sweden [ didn\u2019t have money to buy clothes, so I was walking around\nwith this big -- these big sweaters and these heavy pants. You know, I didn\u2019t really\nlook that presentable, either. So one day I -- there was a big place, a fur place, and\nmy brother-in-law took me up there to ask for a job and I went over to the boss and\nI asked for a job and he looked at me, and I told him my problem and he was very\nsympathetic, but he says to me, I wish I would, but I don\u2019t know where to put you\nbecause you do -- y-you don\u2019t know what to do. I mean you -- where -- wa -- how -\n- I says, I\u2019m going to do anything you want me to do, just -- just please give me a\njob. He looked around and sadly said, I\u2019m sorry. So, I wanted to see how this\nfactory looks like because I heard so much about it and how it works and all that.\nSo from the office I sneaked into the factory. I opened the door and I see that\u2019s the\nFebruary 21, 2001\nfactory. So I walk in there just to see the factory and while I was passing, I saw\nthere an old man standing and he had a beard and he wasn\u2019t working, he was just\nstanding, looking around. And I said to mys -- you know, in my -- my grandfather\ncame in front of me, he had a black hat like my grandfather ha-had, but he was a\nlittle shorter than my grandfather, my grandfather was very tall. So I walked over\nto him and I -- I felt that I can speak Yiddish to him and I did. And I told him my\nstory. I-I says, you know, y -- I don\u2019t know if you know the tragedy on what has\nhappened to the Jews in Europe, but I survived with my sister and I came out here,\nand I have a sister, but I -- I can see she cannot feed me or take care of me, I\u2019m\nforced to get a job and I don\u2019t know what to do. And the man listened and listened\nand listened. And then he says to me, wait a minute. So I said to myself, why not?\nI'll wait. I have no place to go and no -- nothing to do. Pll wait at -- and a -- I -- I --\nI was watching where he was going and I saw him go to the same man that just told\nme that he doesn\u2019t have a job for me and I thought I was going to faint. And he was\nstanding there and standing there with this man, and standing there and talking to\nhim. And then he finally comes back and he says to me, come back tomorrow. I\nsays, tomorrow? What time? He said nine o\u2019clock. When I came back, I stayed\nnear the door, eight o\u2019clock I was already there waiting the door -- for the door to\nbe opened. And finally I went in there, into the office. Shall I continue? A -- so\nanyway, I went to the office, they took one look at me and as I said, I didn\u2019t look\nFebruary 21, 2001\nso presentable. It was a problem. And he must have promised his father, that was\nthe son of this old man, he was the boss and I didn\u2019t know at that time. So this man\nwouldn\u2019t leave the son until he would promise him he\u2019ll give me some kind of a\njob. So they looked at me and they had -- it was a very big place and they had their\nown designers and were so many secretaries in this office. So the de -- I don\u2019t\nknow, I think she was one of the designers, or whatever. She takes one look at me\nand she says to me, you never go shopping. I's -- wi -- I said to her, you know,\nthere is a problem, I don\u2019t have no money. She takes another look at me, she says,\nwell don\u2019t worry about it, we'll -- we\u2019ll bill it to the -- to the company. So I had no\nchoice, I go with her and this lady, I tell you, she knew exactly what to do. She\nknew exactly what to do with me. She -- she took me in. I remember they were\nsmaller stores. Now that I know there\u2019s -- was Macy\u2019s and everything, but she\ndidn\u2019t want to waste time. So she took me into these smaller stores and took out\ndifferent dresses. And every time she brought a dress for me to put on -- first of all,\nI -- you know, I didn't have a bra, I didn\u2019t have anything. Sh -- so she got me a\nlittle bra and stockings, she put stockings on me, I never had stockings in my life.\nAnd she -- we -- we bought a pair of shoes with a little heel, I think it was an inch\nand a half, or -- and she tells me I should get dressed and then she brings these\ndresses. I says, you know, they\u2019re so expensive, I -- you know, and I don\u2019t have\nany money. She says, don\u2019t worry about it, just put it on. So I put it on and I tell\nFebruary 21, 2001\nyou, I looked like a different person. You know, I just looked like a different\nperson. Then she went and took my -- my hair was raw, you know. She took my\nhair and put it in a bun, and then she put a little lipstick on me. And she bought a\nlot of clothes that I wasn\u2019t paying much attention because it was scaring me. And\nwe went back and we got into the office and -- and I tell you, I did look different, I\nmust say. And so the boss came in and he took a look in the office because he was\nin the main place, you know, watching the workers. And I saw him looked at --\nlooking at me twice, like to say well, is that the same girl? So, anyway, then they\ngave me a job. They had a vy -- like a [indecipherable] house, where very rich\nladies came in to pick out skins for their coats. I didn\u2019t realize how rich these\nwomen were at that time. And they were training me on what to say to them and\nhow to deal with them and in no time I was so anxious to hold this job that -- and\nthen I-I didn\u2019t mind staying after the time, or I never went down for lunch. I would\n-- my sister would give me a Jell-o sandwich, I would quickly eat it right there, and\nI was trying my best they should keep me there. And after awhile -- after awhile\nthey saw how -- I became a good thing for them, too. You know, they paid me,\nthey paid me well and I became a good thing for them too, because whatever they\nneeded, or -- they could do with me. And then had models when -- whenever a\nbuyer would come from a different city, they would call a -- a model, or a few\nmodels, matter of fact, and they came in, it was a very big place. So one time I\nFebruary 21, 2001\nbecame lucky and a model didn\u2019t show up, and you know, that lady, she says, well,\nwhy don\u2019t we call in Helen? So they called Helen in and I came there and they\nsaid to me, listen, put on this coat and take a walk. You know, on a walk. I put on\nthe coat and I took a walk, and you know, I was younger, taller, I tell you. A-\nAnyway, I took a walk and this buyer said to me, take another walk. I smiled at\nhim and I took another walk. And it went well, you know, it went well. So finally\nthat lady said to the boss, let\u2019s send her to modeling school. So -- so they send me\nto modeling school for a few hours, but I still had to come into work to get my\npaycheck. After a few weeks, what happened was they told me the same thing, yen\n-- you know, put your chest out, you know, lift your head, walk graciously. You\nknow, how many times do you need to be told what to do? So I walked over to her,\nI says, listen, I don\u2019t mind going there, but it seems to me like I know everything\nalready what to do. And I did it, you know, I sort of did it -- evidently a good job\nbecause then, when a buyer would come in, they would ask, is Helen going to be\nthere? Somebody tipped me off that a -- a buyer was asking about me, then I felt\nalready secure with the job. Then I felt so happy. I was so happy, you have no idea.\nAnyway, I wound up with a beautiful job and people were very nice to me and they\npaid me a lot, I thought at that time, they paid me a lot. I think I was getting 75\ndollar a -- a week. You see, and what happened was, they paid these models by the\nFebruary 21, 2001\nhour. And here I\u2019m willing to anything they want me to do for 75 dollars a week.\nBut they paid me overtime if would come in on Saturday. And I ju --",

        "A: When I first came over, of course I felt different. Of course I felt different,\nmuch different. When I started working and I saw how the people were really nice\nto me, I think it\u2019s because they realized where I came from, what I went through.\nAnd I don\u2019t know if I should tell that. I felt th -- maybe because, you know, where\nI came from that rejection was difficult for me. There were two nephews, you\nknow, young boys that worked 1n that place, the bosses, and they felt like they\nwere big shots. And even though I had a beautiful job, you know, one was pretty\nnice to me, and the other one, for a reason or another, he was constantly bugging\nme.

I -- my -- my\nth -- a-after a few month, after I got the job -- after I got the job, you know, as -- so\n[ -- I had pretty clothes because th-the -- the company gave me this clothes and I di\n-- matter of fact, they even gave me a fur coat. So -- so I -- my sister says, you\nknow, why don\u2019t you just go out of the house on a Saturday night? You know, you\nsit in here and crying all the time, and just get out. So we -- my sister came with\nfour friends and I was the fifth one. Nobody came from the school at the time I --\nwhen I came. So we were like together five, and we kept together again because\n35February 21, 2001\nwe had this background. So finally on Saturday night, we decided we\u2019ll go to New\nYork. And as we walking th -- in New York, we heard music. So --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nFebruary 21, 2001\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Helen Goldkind. This is tape number two, side\nA. And you had begun your story about your life outside the furrier business and --\nand your friends.",
        "A: So anyway, one Saturday we did go to New York and we heard this music there\nand we peeked in to see people were having a wonderful time, with dancing and all\nthat, and we felt, let\u2019s just watch and see how people are living, you know? That\nwas the first time we went out into this world where we saw people living\nnormally, sort of. The youngsters, anyway. So we stood there for awhile. In the\nmeanti -- but you had to take your coats off in order -- you know, and check it in.\nSo we took our coats off and we checked in the coats and 1 -- you know, we were\nstanding there and a few guys came and asked these other girls to dance. But\nsomehow nobody asked me to dance. So anyway, I stayed there and two young\nman walked over and they talked to me and they saw I have an accent and they --\ntheir par -- ha -- their parents were Hungarians, and they knew a few words\nHungarian, so they were -- sure enough they were having a good time. And me\nbeing so depressed, I was looking at them, I says, why are they so happy? What is\nto -- so funny? You know, saying a word in Hungarian, I looked at them like\nthey\u2019re a -- you know, I didn\u2019t understand them. I didn\u2019t understand that they\u2019re\nFebruary 21, 2001\njust normal, happy young man. So they stood with me for awhile, but then they\nwalked away again. And I was waiting there for awhile, waiting for these girls to\ncome back, so a man with a girl comes over to me and he says, would you like to\ndance? I says to him, no, I don\u2019t dance. So he detected a -- an accent and he looked\nat me again and he wondered why I been standing there alone and I\u2019m not dancing,\nwhat are you doing here? So he says, look, would you like to have a drink? I says,\nno, I don\u2019t drink. I was -- I was thinking, you know, I\u2019m waiting for the girls. I\ndon\u2019t want to -- you know, start in with anything. So this girl that he came with had\nto say goodbye because she had to go home. In the meantime, this -- this young\nman is not leaving, a-a-and so he says to me, like he -- he -- then he got like, would\nyou like to -- would you like a Coke? I says n -- well, I don\u2019t know if I can go and\nhave a Coke because I\u2019m waiting for my friends and they\u2019re supposed to come\nsoon and we\u2019re gonna go home. So I says -- so he says, well come, we\u2019ll just get a\nCoke and we\u2019ll come right back. So that\u2019s what happened. In the meantime, I had\nto tell him who I was, that I\u2019m a survivor and I just came from where -- well, then I\nbecame an object to him, that he wanted to know what happened because he -- I\nwas the first survivor that he came -- he came in contact with. Well, I want to tell\nyou something, he started asking me questions and every question he gave me, it\njust -- I wanted to really hit him, because -- and he didn\u2019t realize what he was\nquestioning. And then he -- he -- so I told him, you know, you\u2019 re talking to me like\nFebruary 21, 2001\nit\u2019s -- like you\u2019re cross examining me. He says, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. I just want to\nknow what happened there, do you understand? And I wasn\u2019t ready to talk. And\nthe more I resisted not talking, the more he wanted to know. So our meet -- first\nmeeting didn\u2019t go too well. He -- he -- and like, you know, he -- he would ask me -\n- he -- he really didn\u2019t mean to hurt me or anything, but he didn\u2019t know how to deal\nwith me. So he says to me, you know, I read in the papers that they were taking\nyoung women for the Germans. I says, y-you heard right, but they were taking --\nwhat happened was whenever they -- they took the Czech girls, they picked them\nup from the street if they saw a Czech girl, a Polish girl, they did use them for the -\n- for the arm -- for the army, but the Jews were picked to be killed, not you know,\ntaking them there. At -- so I -- I said to myself, a lot of Jewish girls probably would\nfeel lucky if they -- you know, just to survive -- to -- to -- to be able to do that.\nAnyway -- but it was very, you know, it wasn\u2019t -- 1t wasn\u2019t good. So then he finally\nsays to me, listen, I want to take you home. I says no, you\u2019re not taking me home,\ncause I\u2019m going to go home with the five of these girls. So the girls finally came. I\n-- | think hey kept on staying there because he wanted to pull out words from me,\nyou see, because I wasn\u2019t ready to talk. I couldn\u2019t talk. And finally the girls came\nand you know, we are finished having a good time and we says, let\u2019s go home. So\nhe says to the girls, listen, I want to take you all home. So the girls says yeah, take\nme home. We were five of them. So I was between them, so -- he had a car. He had\nFebruary 21, 2001\na car. Matter of fact, he had a new car, a -- a Buick. So he sa -- we -- he took us\nhome and finally he dropped them all off and my sister and I were the last one and\nhe still wanted to talk and the guy says no, no, I have to go, you know, we\u2019re late,\nmy sister is going to worry, we\u2019re supposed to be home. So I -- I -- he says to me,\nI'll come and see you tomorrow. I says -- I heard him say it, but I didn\u2019t even\nanswer him, I just wanted to go in, because I was annoyed with him, the way he\ntalked. So finally we went in and my sister says, you know, I worried -- and then\nmy sister told us not to go into a car and we came in a car and we didn\u2019t want to lie\nto her. So we -- we told her what happened and nec -- next day I was washing the\nkitchen floor and I forgot about him, because I wasn\u2019t too nice to him. A-And the\nbell rings, and -- see, we didn\u2019t have a telephone in the apartment, a telephone was\ndownstairs and if there was a telephone for us, you know, somebody picked it up\nand rang our bell. And my sister was busy with the kids and I was washing the\nfloors. But -- so my sister says, Helen, run down and see who\u2019s on the telephone.\nSo I run down there barefooted, you know, because I was washing the kitchen on\nmy hands and knees. And I see this man standing there, I said to myself, what\nhappened here? Well, I did -- he did tell -- say that he\u2019s gonna come back, but I just\nwasn\u2019t paying any attention, my mind was so preoccupied with other things. So he\ncame back and he wants to go upstairs. I says look, I\u2019m in the middle of washing\nthe kitchen floor. I-It\u2019s very busy there, my sister is busy with the kids, I don\u2019t\nFebruary 21, 2001\nthink you can come upstairs. So he says, I'll tell you what, [Il wait in the hallway\nuntil you finish washing the floor. So he comes up and he stays in the hallway and\nmy sister says, who 1s he? So I says, you know, this is the guy that\n[indecipherable] yesterday. I told him that he can\u2019t come because we\u2019re busy here,\nbut he said -- he chose to stay in the hallway, so he\u2019s in the hallway. So my sister\nwas very nice, you know, she was normal, you know, she wasn\u2019t like me, you\nknow. So she walked out and she says, who are you, what are you? So he was very\ngood friends with the family of the Bestform. The -- their name was Benenfeld.\nYou see, he la -- he lan to the yeshiva with the Benenfeld\u2019s son-in-law. They had\none daughter and that son-in-law was a nephew of the geera rabba. So today\ngeera rabba don\u2019t mean anything, but in Europe it was a big situation. And my\nsister knew the Benenfelds, so she says -- so she felt a little embarrassed, she says,\nwell as soon as she finishes washing the kitchen, come on in. Because the kitchen\nwasn\u2019t that big, the apartment wasn\u2019t that big. So he came in and he talked, and my\nsister talked to him, you know, my sister talked to him. At that time -- at that point\nhe wasn\u2019t no longer a stranger, but he -- sh -- he made connections with my sister,\nactually. And he stood there, he says he\u2019s got to go to Richmond, he was from\nRichmond. He told me the truth, he had a place in Richmond, but then he -- he --\ne-everything he said he told the truth, but it didn't connect with me. So that night he\nleft for Richmond and he said that he wants to come back, and --\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Abe Goldkind. And so when he went to Richmond, he telephoned me a few\ntimes and then he says he is sorry that he cannot see me this week because -- but\ndid I get the flowers? I says yes, I got the flowers, but you know what? I don\u2019t\nwant you to send me any flowers. Because they were roses and you know, after\nthree days in this apartment, the roses started dying. And don\u2019t ask, I couldn\u2019t deal\nwith that. To me those roses represented life and all of a sudden I\u2019m faced with\ndeath again. So anyway, he -- he just didn\u2019t understand what I was talking about,\nnobody did. And then he -- he did come to see me and -- but my sister wouldn\u2019t let\nme go with him because, you know, I was so young and you see, even though I\nwas 17 - 18 years old at that time, right, I was still like a child of 12. I had no\nexperience with -- you know, interacting with what -- so I didn\u2019t go out with him\nbecau -- you know, he was just come to visit me in my sister\u2019s house. And after\nawhile he got tired of it, he says, I want to take her to the Benenfelds. So my sister\nsays, well, you\u2019re telling me you\u2019re going to the Benenfelds? So she says yes, so\nhe got a cab and we went to the Benenfelds and I saw that, you know, he knows\nthese Benenfelds and they were four brothers and they were, you know, very close\nfriends, from home yet. So yeah, came back, I says, here I was in the Benenfeld\u2019s\nhouse and -- and after awhile he wants to take me to the movies, you know, a few\nweeks later when he came from Richmond. So now my sister said no, sh -- you\nFebruary 21, 2001\ncan\u2019t take her to the movies. So she says, okay. So he says, fil -- you know me\nalready, you know, you -- you must understand, I have a background. And I\nwouldn\u2019t hurt her, she was hurt enough. At that point he already understood who I\nam, where I come from. So my sister says, all right, well if you take her with a cab,\nPll let you go. And he had to park the car downstairs and take a cab, and we went\nto see Al Jolson. And that\u2019s how it started, you know. So actually, I think what the\nbeginning was he -- he really wanted to know what happened there. He was a very\ncurious person, and --",
        "Q: Was he your age?",
        "A: No, he was a little older. He was a little older.",
        "Q: And was he born in the United States?",
        "A: No, he came from Poland, from L6\u00e9dz, just before the war.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So had he lost relatives in the war?",
        "A: Yeah, he -- but he was lucky, he came here with his family, with his parents and\nsisters and brothers, yes.",
        "Q: But he lost extended family?",
        "A: All of them. All of them. All of them, yeah.",
        "Q: Do you think that\u2019s why he kept asking you what --\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "A: Yes --",
        "Q: -- what happened, because he was thinking of his own family?",
        "A: -- yes, yes, yes, he really wanted to know. He really wanted to know what\nhappened there. I -- you know, there were lots of articles, but they were in the --\nthey were on the -- on the back pages. Nobody made a headline out of it. So -- you\nknow, and people were skeptical. If somebody would come and tell you they\u2019 re\ntaking hi -- little kids to the gas chamber, would you believe that? It has never\nhappened before, so people, even though they heard it, but they says, oh it\u2019s\nsomething, you know, that doesn\u2019t make sense.",
        "Q: When you and Frances and Sylvia would be together in the apartment, would\nyou talk about your parents and life before the war?",
        "A: Oh yeah, a lot, a lot. She wanted to know what happened and we had to tell her\nwhat happened, we had to tell her the truth and -- and yeah, they were sad stories, it\nwas a very sad time, you know. It was like a mixed situation. It was -- it was a\nmixed situation, it was -- I felt lime -- like again betwe -- I felt like I\u2019m again with\npeople that Hitler didn\u2019t destroy. I thought Hitler destroyed the world, to tell you\nthe truth. I really thought Hitler destroyed the world. And when I came here, I\nfound the world. And you know, I was -- but still, it\u2019s very hard to explain, when\nyou lose one person, yo-you know, like you lose your mother, you -- you -- you\nmourn and my mother, my mother. But when you lose 89 people at one time, it\u2019s\nFebruary 21, 2001\njust -- there is no compacity in you to bear it. I want to tell you that. And but you -\n- | think if w -- when I -- a-and of course, I got married. I -- you know, of course,\nafter awhile, after he was coming to see me from Richmond and he already felt\nlike he would want -- you know, he got interested in me, actually, after he was\nfinished with the stories of World War II, he moved his pla -- he had a -- a navy op\n-- army-navy store in Richmond and he said that I probably wouldn\u2019t want to live\nthere, so he moved it to Baltimore, just to show me that he will do anything I want\nto, because I told him I\u2019m not leaving my job, that he\u2019s got to get a job in -- in -- in\nNew York. And he says, you know, I-I-I\u2019m not a type of person to work for other\npeople, I need to work for myself. And back and forth. I didn\u2019t want to give up my\njob, my job meant so much to me because I was so happy there. I was so happy\nthere. But anyway, after awhile we came to an understanding, we will ga -- he\nwanted to get married. Now, I -- you see, I -- I don\u2019t think I was ready to do that,\nyou know. I -- I wanted to -- I don\u2019t know what I wanted to do, I don\u2019t know, I\ndon\u2019t know, I just wanted my job and I wanted to work and I wanted to go to\nschool, and -- but anyway, I agreed that -- you know, we all agreed because he\u2019s\nreally -- he really was a person with depth. He -- I just lost him two years ago, in\nMay.",
        "Q: When did you get married?",
        "A: We got married November the ninth.\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "Q: What year?",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I\u2019m ashame of it, but I can look it up. It -- 1t doesn\u2019t matter, does it?",
        "Q: So -- and what was your wedding like?",
        "A: Oh, you know, I -- even though I made up -- some money, but he wasn\u2019t a rich\nman either. He came here in \u201939, right before the war. But he was very educated.\nSo we had a small wedding that we paid for because there was nobody else to pay\nfor. And then I moved to Baltimore. But --",
        "Q: Was it hard to leave your two sisters?",
        "A: Very. Very hard. Th -- actually then I -- you know, after I -- I realized I have to\nlive in Baltimore, I -- I asked him that my sister please syl -- well, it\u2019s another\nlong story. My si -- I lost my sister Frances, yes.",
        "Q: Whe-When was that?",
        "A: When was that? Maybe -- maybe three years after we came.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: So there was another shock in my life that one sister should have lived, my s --\nyeah. Anyway, but after she died I says, le -- you know what, I can\u2019t deal with this\nworld any more. I need my sister near me. So he opened up a store for my sister in\nBaltimore and she came to Baltimore.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yes.\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "Q: What -- what did Frances die of?",
        "A: Kidney disease. Today she probably could have lived, they have dialysis and all\nthis, so yeah. So then she left these two little kids, so we took care of the --",
        "Q: So you moved to Baltimore and your sister came to Baltimore also --",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- and then you -- and you had children?",
        "A: Yes, then I had three children. But I really feel when my first child was born --\nmatter of fact it\u2019s sort of -- to me this kid represented not only life, but sort of like\nmy -- that -- that I -- I\u2019m alive again. You know, I ti -- I don\u2019t know how to explain\nit. So anyway -- and I looked at this kid and I said to her, I need to protect you\nfrom my past, because I was afraid that if I\u2019ll be talking to her what I went through,\nit\u2019s -- it\u2019s going to be a punishment to this kid. So I -- I promised myself I-I -- I no\nlonger have the luxury on being preoccupied with it. I need to put it away.",
        "Q: Ha-Had you been preoccupied with your past up to that point?",
        "A: Yes, I --",
        "Q: And how -- how did that manifest itself?",
        "A: All the time sad. You know, my husband really went through a tough time with\nme too, but he sort of understood it. I had nightmares. He was very understanding.\nI was married to a very good guy. And so I said to myself, I\u2019m going to put all this\nin an iron box and I\u2019m not going to open it up. And I was raising her and I kept on\nFebruary 21, 2001\n-- you know, she -- I gave her all my love, for the people that I no longer had. You\nknow, there is a little bit too much is no good either. You know what they say? I\nwould never put her down. I carried her around constantly. I mean, I carried her\naround constantly, so what happened, being I didn\u2019t put her -- I was afraid the floor\nis dirty, I was -- I was so afraid I'll lose her. So -- and then she was born with big --\nwe had a problem, she was born with big adenoids and she couldn't take her bottle.\nSo I ha -- we had a doctor come in every day to the f -- when we fed her, they\ncouldn\u2019t -- like this she was healthy, but -- but she had this problem, she couldn\u2019t\ntake the bottle. So we had a doctor come in every day to look at her and finally the\ndoctor saw the kid can\u2019t breathe when she closes her mouth. He took a look in the\nnose and her nose was clutter -- she made history. They took her to John Hopkins\nand they opened up her nose and that\u2019s -- she could have died if this doctor\nwouldn\u2019t of -- I would have lost her. And the doctors kept on saying that I was the\ncrazy mother. But then they found that I wa -- you know, I had a reason, because I\nsaw the kid is losing weight and can\u2019t eat. So that was that, and --",
        "Q: And her name?",
        "A: Is Rose. Right now her na -- her name is Rose Shainus. And so I -- I raised this\nchild and by ne -- never putting her on the floor she didn\u2019t know how to crawl or\nshe didn't know how to walk. So again with the doctors I keep on saying -- she was\nalready -- she was already 20 months and this kid wouldn\u2019t walk. So I take her to\nFebruary 21, 2001\nthe doctors and the doctors see a healthy child. They didn\u2019t know what to do with\nher. And -- so one day a doctor says to me, tell me, so how do you deal with her?\nSo accidentally I said to him, you know, I -- I -- I love to hold her so much that I\nnever -- I always hold her, I said to him, I always hold her. So he says, well, fa --\ntry putting her down the floor. Ee -- I -- e -- I says, but she\u2019s going to cry. So he\nsays, well let her cry a little bit, and move away from her. So I did that. You know,\nshe started crawling. Then she was looking, how can she get to me. So at 20 she\nstarted crawling. And then, you know, eventually, when I knew what the problem\nwas, I already, you know put her in a little wagon, and anyway, we dealt with the\nproblem. It was my problem, that I created, but this is the kind of mother I was. I\njust never put her down. Even I -- I was, you know, cooking, or I was giving my\nhusband to eat, she was always in my hands, she was like my hand. I could never\nput her down. It sounds crazy today. I never put her down. Anyway, but she grew\nolder and she\u2019s -- she\u2019s fine, she --",
        "Q: And then your other children?",
        "A: Then I had another daughter, her name was Michelle and I knew already more\nwhat to do. And then, four years later, we had a lit -- a son, Larry. So that was a\nhappy time of my life and I had my children, and of course I was forced to get rid\nof my past that I -- I didn\u2019t have that luxury to deal with it any more. Do you see\nwhat I\u2019m saying?\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "Q: What do you mean by that?",
        "A: What I mean by that is that I wallowed in my past and it made me a very hap --\nunhappy person. And I felt I need to raise these kids [phone ringing] [tape break]\nWell anyway, I try very hard to live for the future and not for the past, and I was --\nbecause of my kids. I wanted them to have a better life than I had and I wanted\nthem to grow up to be better people than I encountered in my young life. So this\nwas my decision and this is wa -- what I was out to do. I felt that -- that that was\nmy job now and I raised them and I was very, very happy with them. They were\nwonderful kids. They tried so hard. I never talked about my past, but I think that\nthey knew that it -- something in my life wasn\u2019t talked about. So -- so they really --\nmy husband and my children made my life. And I went on raising them. My oldest\ndaughter -- shall I tell you where they went to school or whatever? I should tell you\n-- okay. My oldest daughter, she went to Brandeis University, and my younger\ndaughter went to ithic -- no, sh -- she went to -- not Ithaca, there was another\ncollege, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Q: In Ithaca? Cornell?",
        "A: No. Anyway --",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay.\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "A: A-And my son went to University of Pennsylvania. And my older daughter\nbec -- got a PhD in psychology and my younger daughter has got a PhD -- no, my\nolder daughter has a PhD in microbiology and my younger daughter has a PhD in\npsychology and my son is a gastroenterologist. And they have families and I\u2019m\nblessed with 10 grandchildren that I | -- that I love them all.",
        "Q: When you say when you raised them you didn\u2019t talk about their -- your\nbackground, did they ever ask you, and if so, how did you answer them?",
        "A: They started asking me after they went to college, wi -- believe it or not. They\nstarted reading books. As --",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t say anything during high school years?",
        "A: They va -- they would throw out, but I did not volunteer my past with them. I\ndidn't [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So what did you say about their -- their grandparents, or their aunt? How did\nyou answer them?",

But when they started reading books,\nyou know, I had to be honest with them, and I felt at that time that they were\ncapable of dealing with this tragedy, where before I was afraid if Pll tell them what\nhas happened, they\u2019Il be very angry, and -- angry people, Ill bring up angry people\nbecause -- so -- and this is not what I wanted to do. So when they came to ar --\nFebruary 21, 2001\nwhen they read the books -- actually, what -- what -- what happened was, when\nbooks came out that this tragedy never happened, then they started questioning.\nYou know, they read the books -- I don\u2019t know the name of the professor from\nPrinceton, he was trying to -- he was trying to convince the world that that\ncouldn't have happened. So they came questioning me, how could it have\nhappened, and actually that\u2019s how I started with -- you know, telling them how it\nhappened and how it -- you know, what happened.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",

        "A: Well, just to give you a example, when the museum opened, the Holocaust\nMuseum opened, I was a volunteer and she says, Mommy, I want to go with you\nand I\u2019Il visit the museum. So I went to my job and she went upstairs to, you know,\nlook around. If -- at that time she already had three kids of her own, imagine. She\nwent upstairs and about 15 - 20 minutes later she came downstairs, pale. And so I\nsaid to her, what happened honey? Wha -- you know, you look so pale. She says,\nFebruary 21, 2001\nMommy, I think I saw you in these pictures. And it wa -- she didn't -- I -- I\u2019m not\nin these pictures, but I said to myself, my God, if I would have fed her with al --\nwith this tragedy when she was young, I know the kid probably would have not\nsurvived, if she couldn\u2019t deal with it at that point.",

        "A: Well, we didn\u2019t talk -- we didn\u2019t talk about it to my grandchildren either. That --\nw-we made these decisions actually, because we did not want to bring up angry\nkids, or -- you know. Matter of fact, my daughter would say to me, Mommy, when\nPll grow up, I\u2019m going to do something so I can help people. I says -- oh, you\u2019ll be\nproud of me, I\u2019ll ca -- I-I\u2019ll help people. I says, sweetheart, I\u2019m already proud of\nyou, you\u2019re wonderful. Anyway -- so anyway, she is the one who became a\nmicrobiologist so that she can help people.

I would be heartbroken if\nmy kids would have wound up hating, because I saw what hate does. And -- and\nFebruary 21, 2001\nthey sort of go around with their normal life. I am forever thankful that the United\nStates gave me this chance to -- for a new life, but my reward to them are my\nchildren and my grandchildren. You know, I\u2019m so glad I brought them to the\nUnited States and they are good citizens and that makes me very happy. And now\nyou want to know about my grandchildren.

        "Q: When -- wh -- when your children were growing up and they -- let\u2019s say your\ndaughter Rose reached the age that you did when things got very difficult for you\nas a child, was that a more difficult time for you? Did it bring back memories of\nwhat you had gone through, when she was, let\u2019s say 12 - 13 - 14 - 15? When --\nwhen life was so hard for you during the war, and when she reached that age, did\nthat trigger anything for you, when you would look at her and think what were you\ndoing when you were her age?",
        "A: Mm, mm-hm, I understand what you\u2019re saying, but my answer on that would be\nthis, I was so afraid being that I wasn\u2019t born here, and I have an accent that\nFebruary 21, 2001\nsomehow another my children m-might suffer from it, that I will not be able to\nguide them, you know, to the right places and do the right things. So I was\nconcentrating more or less on what\u2019s happening in their life. I was always on top of\nit. |always wanted to know how they\u2019re doing in school, and I always wanted\nthem to -- to go to Girl Scouts. And I always wanted them to do everything that\nother kids in the United States did. So this is where my energy went in, not saying\n-- well, I\u2019m delighted that my daughter has it better. I mean, I was delighted that\nmy daughter has it better, but I felt that I -- I -- I shouldn\u2019t touch that part. That was\na no-no for me to think back and say, what did I do when I was 12, because it\nwouldn\u2019t be good. I used to get these crying spells and I would just, for no reason,\nnobody would say much to me, I would cry and I couldn\u2019t stop for nothing. And\nthat bothers me even today. I would cry and cry and I couldn\u2019t explain it and I\ncouldn\u2019t stop. So the ki -- poor kids, they were such good kids, they would say did\n-- did we do something, Mommy, you\u2019re crying, did we -- I said, no, you\u2019re\nwonderful. I was trying to reassure them it\u2019s -- has nothing to do with them. But\nthey were just sad to see me cry. And here if I would start talking, it would be a\nbigger problem. I could have contr -- you see, what happened was, I could control\nmy mouth, the talking, but you can\u2019t control emotion, you can\u2019t control the\nnightmares. You can\u2019t control the -- I couldn\u2019t control the crying. I don\u2019t know\nhow to explain it, because you know, I wanted to stop because I didn\u2019t want my\nFebruary 21, 2001\nkids to see me that way. I couldn\u2019t control it until I cried myself out, for days, you\nknow, and then all of a sudden it like, stopped. It relieved me. I think maybe cause\nI couldn\u2019t talk, so this was my outburst.",

        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right, because you see, we were in so much trouble that we\ndidn\u2019t think we\u2019ll survive either, til the last minute. My sister got typhus and you\nknow how many people died in -- in Bergen-Belsen and -- and we didn't even\nthink -- one of us wanted to survive to tell the world, but it wasn\u2019t in our power\nreally, completely to control it.",
        "Q: But even in Sweden, you -- did you feel you could mourn your family?",
        "A: Not really. First of all, we were separated and then I had the responsibility of\nstudying. And we were isolo -- we -- not isolated, you know, isolated --",
        "Q: Separated?",
        "A: Separated, yeah. We were separated from society there. It was a little town,\nFielgarden, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s on the map, even. So my -- I think my energy went\nin to bond with these girls, you know. And of course we studied. We studied. No, it\nwas no time to mourn. It was no time --",

        "A: You know, you -- I don\u2019t know how to say this either, in order for people to\nunderstand it. When we got to Auschwitz, there was such a smell of burning\npeople that there was a smell. It was as -- definite smell. Sometimes when I walk\ninto something, you know, like the light goes on, it\u2019s the smell of Auschwitz. It\u2019s\nhard to explain what happens inside of me. You know, there 1s -- there are certain\nthings that are in there -- in -- in -- 1-in -- you know, things trigger it off, for\ndifferent reasons, for different -- if I see a chimney today, I have a reaction.

        "A: You know, it just depends, it just depends. A swastika. You know, when I see a\nswastika I feel I\u2019m in danger. It s -- it sounds crazy to other people, because other\npeople are not affected at all by a swastika. That swastika cannot hurt you. But\nwhat represents to me is something else. Well, you know, a lot -- a lot of things, a\nlot of things. To say that I completely have a pain free life, I don\u2019t. It feels that --\nFebruary 21, 2001\nyou know, I have -- I have s-so many nice things in my life right now that I try to\nfocus in on that.",
        "Q: If you have -- if you had had a different life, a different childhood, do you feel\nyou'd be a different person today?",
        "A: Absolutely. First of all I think I would be more of an educated person. I -- I hate\nto say it about myself, but Hitler took my years of education away from me and I\nmiss that. I remember when I -- I used to feed my daughter with a bottle, I would\ntell her stories. Some mothers tell their children, you know, all kinds of wonderful\nthings and I would tell her sweetheart, when you\u2019ll get -- grow older, you\u2019ll go to\ncollege. And looking back, she didn\u2019t know. She -- she would look at -- I think I\nwas telling myself that -- I was trying to comfort myself because that was robbed\nfrom me. And the simple reason that my children and my grandchildren are such\noverachievers, it might have something to do with it, but I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019m not sure,\nI\u2019m not sure.",
        "Q: You had said that you were a strong child before the war. Did that --",
        "A: I think my sister was stronger than I was. My sister was much stronger than I\nwas.",
        "Q: I\u2019m talking physically and emotionally.",
        "A: I-I -- I think -- I think emotion -- I think physically I was strong. Emotionally,\nbecause -- emotionally I don\u2019t think I was strong as my sister because I cracked\nFebruary 21, 2001\nfaster, I gave in faster. And a lot of people when they did that, they just took their\nlives. I remember in -- the first night in -- in Auschwitz, when I saw a lot of people\nhanging from these -- on these electric wires. I believe today that\u2019s what, they\ncracked and they fel -- they -- they knew that the -- there\u2019s no way they can escape.\nThey just did away with themselves the best way they knew how. And if not for\nmy sister I ba -- wonder if I wouldn\u2019t have been hanging on these wires, believe\nme. There are many times I| think about it.",

        "Q: D-D-Do you -- do you and she talk still about the war?",
        "A: She can deal with it less than I can, would you believe it or not? We were in\nYad Vashem and sh -- together, she couldn\u2019t walk in there. I walked in there, and\nshe couldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know why.",

        "Q: What are ye -- let\u2019s talk a little bit about your religious outlook, because of what\nyou went through, had to -- did it make you more religious, less religious? Your\nfeelings about being Jewish, because you suffered because you were a Jew?\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "A: Okay. I\u2019m trying to figure out how to explain it best. I would say that I take my\nJudaism very serious because I paid a big price. And a sad thing happened that I\ncannot be as religious as my grandfather and my father was. But what I did is put\nmy hope in Israel, because I feel if we will not have Israel, we Jews are not safe.\nSo therefore, when something goes on in Israel, it puts me though a lot of pain, the\nfear of losing Israel. I think I made my peace with God. I have a lot of questions\nfor him and maybe one day he\u2019s going to be able to explain, or something --\nsomebody will be able to explain fu -- why. The reason why the children come to\nmy mind is because when I look at my little grandchildren and I say to myself,\nthese -- kids like them went to the gas chamber and they never had a chance. So I\nwant to know why. I would very much like to know why. If there is a reason, I\nwould like to know. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. This is how I live today. I don\u2019t\nthink it made me more religious, it didn\u2019t. But I -- I respect everybody, whatever\nthey believe in and whatever, because the truth is we really don -- you know,\nunless somebody\u2019s a real believer, can he feel, you know, what you really read?\nBut you know, in the other hand, y-y-you know, God gave us a brain that\u2019s -- y-\nyou know, you -- you also think and examine things. E-Everything we read,\nactually, you know, wa-wa-was -- it was written by humans and so many years\nago. So I sometimes think, you know, I -- I -- I\u2019m very happy that we have this\nthings 1n -- in orbit. Maybe through that we will find out really, maybe something\nFebruary 21, 2001\nmore than w-we know now on earth. I\u2019m hoping anyway, I\u2019m really hoping for it,\nbut it\u2019s probably my great-grandchildren will know a little bit more than I know of,\nas far as the religions are going.",
        "Q: Do you -- do you still practice in any way, religiously?",

And of\ncourse the holidays, which are the toughest for me because I remember what\nhappened at home. It was such a happy time with my family. And -- and I\u2019m afraid\nto complain, I'll tell you the truth, because I feel like God gave me a lot back, and\nI\u2019m always scared something shouldn\u2019t happen to my family, cause I don\u2019t think\nthat I could survive any more, you know? So -- so I don\u2019t -- so most of the time I\njust say thank you God for what you gave me and I hope they stay well and go on\nwith their lives.",
        "Q: Are you angry that you had to go through what you did, whereas other people,\nlet\u2019s say in the United States, didn\u2019t have to?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m angry because they didn\u2019t have to. Matter of fact, I feel\nhappy that they didn\u2019t have to, because m -- why so much suffering? And\nunnecessary suffering. What we went through 1s not because I was a bad person. It\nisn\u2019t because I committed a crime. So it doesn\u2019t make sense for me to be angry.\nMatter of fact, I\u2019m the other way. I\u2019m happy that there were some people that did\nFebruary 21, 2001\nnot have to go through this. But I\u2019Il tell you the truth, I live in fear. I\u2019m hoping that\nmy grandchildren, great-grandchildren shouldn\u2019t have to go through what I have\ngone through. And therefore, when I go to the museum, I want to teach society,\nplease don\u2019t hate. Please don\u2019t hate. The outcome of it 1s no good, no good. I think\nthis is the message I would want to give the world. Don\u2019t hate.",

I think perhaps -- you see, everything too much is\nno good. I think I was s -- too protective of them. I lived in fear they shouldn\u2019t get\nsick.

        "Q: Th-This 1s all three children? In other words, it did not lessen as you had th --\nmore children?",
        "A: No, no, it didn\u2019t. Each and every one was different and just to tell you I was so\non top of my children, I remember my younger daughter, I was watching over her\nand she fell and she hit her lip. And so I rushed her to the doctor and I kept on\ncrying because it\u2019s my fault, I didn\u2019t watching -- you know, another mother would\nsay, well it happens. And this was my big fault, because my child fell and hit her\nlip and cr -- and -- and I couldn\u2019t forgive myself. So imagine my children what\nFebruary 21, 2001\nthey had to go through having me on top of them all the time. I think, you know,\nthat was a -- not the best thing for them. You know, I -- I should have | -- I should\nhave given them maybe more elbow space. See what I\u2019m saying? I should have\ngiven them a little bit more elbow space.",

And that\u2019s\nhow I\u2019m surviving. Don\u2019t forget, I have some responsibilities to my children, too.\nIt\u2019s not just me any more. So I think I am. There\u2019s a lot of sadness in me, although\nthere is so much for me to be happy. I don\u2019t have to -- I already mentioned that.\nBut there\u2019s a lot of sadness in me.

There is this sadness in me and -- and there is -- there is the good things that\nI -- I -- I enjoy. That\u2019s why my kids keeps on saying, Ma, why you so sad? Look at\nthe beautiful things you have. I says, you\u2019re right, you\u2019re right, I shouldn\u2019t be sad.\nBut you can\u2019t say this to your soul, you know?

When I see a young German today, I\u2019m willing to deal with him\none on one, it depends what kind of person he 1s. But let me tell you something,\nwhen I see a person in my age, I -- I doubt.

It\u2019s just that I was trying to look at him and trying to\nfigure him out, how he was created. Was he really created by God, or were there\nmon -- are there monsters in heaven? Bec-bec-because -- how -- how can anybody\ntake again, kids, put them in wagons to a gas chamber? How could any human\nbeing do that? You know, be -- I always want to talk too, about the kids. You feel\nadults, you know, had maybe a chance to life, but kids never did. How -- how\ncould this man -- I was looking at him and my mind was just going a mile a\nminute, where he comes from, why is -- was he the way he was? Of course, I never\nfigured it out, I don\u2019t know. Have no answer. But to my mind he didn\u2019t look -- you\nknow, when I looked at him, in my heart, I said, 1t\u2019s maybe in my eyes he looked\nlike a human being, but to my soul and my heart, I saw -- I saw a monster, a scary\nmonster. It\u2019s hard to explain because other people wouldn\u2019t understand it, unless\nyou go through this. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. So that\u2019s the way it is. You know,\nthe few years that I\u2019ve have left -- the few years that I have left to live, I -- you\nknow, I go and work in the museum and I talk to children. I really think that if -- if\n-- if I could just help a little bit, that much t -- help society to be a better society, I\nwould like to do that, very much so. If not -- if a -- if I leave this earth and I didn't\nchange anything in my small way, I think I\u2019m going to die with a fear what will\nFebruary 21, 2001\nhappen to my great-grandchildren, because I already know what human beings are\ncapable of. And if you let it go, it does no good. That\u2019s really -- that\u2019s how I live\ntoday. You know, I don\u2019t know if I too -- I was talking to little kids and I was\ntelling them about my little brother and I really, you know, I was making it mild. I\njust told them how we got separated and how, you know, he brou -- he -- he -- he |\n-- you know, he had to give up his book, and how sad he was. And there was a lady\nand -- with two children a-and I really didn\u2019t know who she was, because people\nwere coming and going and then after I had my say to the kids, this lady came up\nand she said to me, you know, I\u2019m an SS man\u2019s daughter, and well, he didn\u2019t tell\nme that it was so bad. And imagine, I didn\u2019t even scratch the surface when I was\ntalking to these little kids. She had two beautiful little girls with her and -- and she\nsaid that to me and it\u2019s like she would hit me over the head. And I said to her -- I\ndidn\u2019t have time to debate it with her how good or bad it was, so I pulled her aside\nand I say to her, listen, I\u2019m so glad that you came in here, because I need to ask\nyou some questions. Tell me, did your father tell you what his job was as an SS\nman? We didn\u2019t talk about it. So I says, you know, in Auschwitz, where I was,\nthere came a million and a half children to Auschwitz. And you know what the --\nthe SS people, they had their families there with their children, you know what\ntheir job was? Did you ever wonder what their job was? She says no. Watching\nover the people she says to me. I says, not really. Their job was to take little kids\nFebruary 21, 2001\nlike yours -- I pointed my finger to her children -- to the gas chamber. These kids\nhad no -- nobody had any mercy over them and they knew where these kids are\ngoing. And they were living there very happily with their own families. So I -- I --\nI don\u2019t know how more to explain it to you, how good and bad it was. You know,\nshe started crying. I think I scared her a little bit because I showed my f -- pointed\nmy fingers to her children. So I said to myself, you know, I -- I [indecipherable]\nto -- as angry I was in the beginning for her to saying this to me, I -- I -- you know,\nI was really upset. Well, I said, if she\u2019s starting to cry, maybe I touched a nerve in\nher. So I was going to hug her, and she stepped back. She says to me, you know, I\nwill never forget you. And I said to her, you know what? As long as you will never\nforget me, please remember what I want to tell you. If you see any children when\ntheir lives will be threatened, speak up. Because your father didn\u2019t. And that\u2019s how\nshe walked out. Now, re -- now I feel that I touched her, I touched one person. And\nthat makes me feel good, that maybe if she\u2019s going to see a child in danger,\nwhether it\u2019s a Jew, or a non-Jew, or green or yellow or purple, maybe she\u2019|l be\nthere and say wait a second, we cannot afford of doing that, we shouldn\u2019t do that.\nAnd you know, it makes me feel like maybe I touched someone. I would like to\ntouch the whole world and tell them don\u2019t hate.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk a little bit more about your experiences as a volunteer at the\nHolocaust Museum. When did you begin working there?\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "A: All right, I beca -- I became -- I became a volunteer there right away, as soon as\nthe museum has opened. And then my husband retired and we moved to Florida.\nAnd so I -- w-we moved and as I said before, my husband died -- itl] be two years\nin May, and --",
        "Q: So you started working in 1993, or --",
        "A: Yeah, as soon a -- as soon as it opened.",
        "Q: -- th-the building --",
        "A: Yeah, when it was --",
        "Q: -- wa -- wa -- you did not work with them preceding the building?",
        "A: -- when it was finished I worked in there. And --",
        "Q: Wha- What ins -- why did you go to work for them?",
        "A: Why I went to work for them? Because I think through this museum, hopefully\npeople will get the message what not to do to each other. And it\u2019s very important to\nme. You see, I cannot bring back my parents, my family. There\u2019s nothing I can do.\nBut what I -- there is left for me to do 1s perhaps it shouldn\u2019t happen to other\npeople and other children. And if I can do that, I would -- you know, this is my\nmain priority at this point in my life, anyway.",
        "Q: What kind of work do you do at the museum?\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "A: Now? I am at the donor desk, the membership desk, I work. And then I also --\nI\u2019m on the speaking bureau. And whenever they need me, if they call me, I make it\na priority to go there.",
        "Q: An-And where have you given talks?",
        "A: Well, in high schools. And sometimes I talk to kids when they come in, they\nsurround the desk there, and I will talk to them when they come in, if the teachers\nrequest it.",
        "Q: And -- and you tell them your story?",
        "A: Not the complete story, because it\u2019s impossible to tell the complete story. I just\nfocus in perhaps on -- I give them a -- I -- I give them a responsibility. I tell them\nthat it\u2019s in their hands to make a better society and what they saw there is reality.\nIt\u2019s not a motion picture, it was rea -- reality. And to go out and make a better\nworld. That\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping they do.",
        "Q: Do you think working at the museum has affected your life?",
        "A: I --",
        "Q: Or -- or your memories of the Holocaust? Has it affected those memories?",
        "A: I think working in the Holocaust is giving me a chance to take my mother\u2019s\nmessage to people, and so that makes me feel good. And I don\u2019t know, I just -- I\nthink I -- I enjoy working there, don\u2019t ask me why, but I -- I enjoy working there. I\ntalk to people, different people, and I like it. Some people have questions and I\nFebruary 21, 2001\ndon\u2019t blame them. If I probably wouldn\u2019t live through what I did, I probably would\nhave lots of questions. So I try to explain it the best way I know how that makes\nsense. And as you know, the Germans were very, very suf -- e-efficient, by keeping\n-- by keeping track on where the Jews were going and what happened and all that.\nSo if they doubting my words, they can always go and pick up with some\ndocuments that were -- that we have today. We don\u2019t have it all because it wasn\u2019t\njust Auschwitz that they were killing people in the Einsatzgruppen. And --",
        "Q: Are there any other special insights that you bring to the museum because you\nare a survivor?",
        "A: Special insights. Gee, I didn\u2019t think about it. The only th -- the -- well, the only\nthing that I feel I can explain this horror more than anybody else, because we all\nread about it and we all heard about it and we all saw -- see the documentaries that\nthey have today of it, but I lived it. And I think the person that lived it can really,\nreally get 1t across somewhat a little better maybe than the educated and the teacher\ncan. And I tell them my purpose on earth today, and I hope they take me serious.\nYou know, as I said before, I would just like to see a better society, and if I can do\nsomething about it I would like to, the best way I know how.",
        "Q: So you feel society could be made better?",
        "A: I think so. I'll tell you the truth, being that I was lucky enough to bring 1n thr-\nthree kids 1-into this world and given the chance to mold them, I think we can have\nFebruary 21, 2001\na better society, because I know exactly how my kids feel. I remember going to\nwork in Germany and kids would be -- you know, near their picket fences in the\nhouse. You know, kids 10 - 11 years old, something like that, playing. And when\nthey saw us pass by, they started spitting and screaming [speaks German here].\nYou see now, when kids are being brought up with this hate, I don\u2019t really think\nthey\u2019re capable of loving other people, even though at that time they were hating\nthe Jews. But I think when you bring up kids hating, they eventually hate. Their\nlife will be a hate. It\u2019s very destructive, very destructive. Very destructive. So now\nI -- I really feel if my kids would be different people, I -- I -- I would say well, you\nknow, there\u2019s nothing we can do. I understand -- I understand, being that my\ndaughter is -- you know, she\u2019s got a degree in microbiology that she -- she tells me\na lot of people are, you know, born with certain genes, and I understand that. I\nunderstand that, but you still have to nurture that gene. And he -- he might -- he\nmight have the gene of having red hair or black hair or whatever. But the nurturing\nto make a person, I think it -- it -- it\u2019s a big job. To tell you the truth, I think if I\nwould have known all that, maybe I would be afraid that I\u2019m not capable of doing\nit, at that time, anyway. But -- so I -- I definitely feel that if we can just somehow\nerase this hate, we will definitely have a better society, I do believe in that. I do\nbelieve in that.\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "Q: When you meet other survivors, or friends of yours who are survivors, do you\nencourage them to work at the museum as a volunteer?",
        "A: I do. But it is hard to explain. As much as I talk about it, I still have difficulties.\nAnd a lot of survivors grew older and weaker and they just cannot deal with their\npast, it\u2019s too painful. It\u2019s very painful. So everybody does the best they know how,\nbut I can also understand it. It\u2019s a painful situation.",
        "Q: Do you belong to -- outside the museum, do you belong to any survivor groups?",
        "A: Yes, I do. I do, and we get together and we try to support each other. Don\u2019t\nforget, we survivors -- I mean, thank God that I -- you know, I have children and\nthey made -- they made their own little families, one or two children, but we have\nnobody else on the outside. So, believe it or not there\u2019s some survivors that are\ndying, and if they -- you know, and if by some reason they could never have a\nchild, or they had a child and unfortunately it\u2019s not here, they really don\u2019t have\nanybody. So we -- we become their family.",
        "Q: Wh-What is your relationship with the other volunteers at the museum who are\nsurvivors or witnesses to the Holocaust? Do you -- you --",
        "A: Yes. How shall I say it? I have such strong, good feelings towards all the people\nthat work in the Holocaust, whether they get paid or not, because I feel n-not only\nare they do -- especially the volunteers, they are trying to right the wrong by\ncoming there and working there. I once asked a gentleman, why -- why are you\nFebruary 21, 2001\nworking here in this museum? I call 1t a cemetery. You could go out and get a job\nanyplace, at a happy place and have a happy day. But I have to understand that\nother people that didn\u2019t go through what I did, they have a different feeling. But he\n-- he told me a story about his life. He says, you know, I have a child -- I have a\nchild that I love dearly and she is not as focused as another child is. And when I\nthink, would I have had this child in Germany? I would have lost her. And she\nmakes my life. She means so much in my life. Because, as you know, the Germans\nwere gassing their own children first, the sick ones. Well, I don\u2019t know whether\nthis motivates him to be there, but I said to myself, 1f he told me this story, there\nmust be a spark underneath there. So everybody that works in this museum 1s\ntrying to right the wrong, I think. That\u2019s the way I look at them, and I -- I love\nthem all. I feel very comfortable with them. I almost feel like they\u2019re my relatives.\nI -- okay, no big deal. Pll just take a towel and wipe it off, no big deal. [tape\nbreak]",
        "Q: We were talking about the -- your relationship, and even with the non-Jewish\nvolunteers and staff at the museum.",
        "A: Absolutely. Absolutely. Matter of fact -- I don\u2019t know if I should say it, the\nJews, I expect them to be there, y-you know, but when I see a non-Jew as a\nvolunteer, I really -- I really feel very good about it, very good about it. Yes, I do,\nand I feel close to them, yeah.\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "Q: Have you exchanged your story with other volunteers that -- survivor volunteers\nat the museum?",
        "A: Well, we all had different experiences, I want you to know. We come from\ndifferent places. The truth is that we\u2019re -- [phone ringing][tape break] -- yeah --\nyeah, I -- I -- I like them all. I like them all.",
        "Q: And then I said something about -- talking about your experiences with the\nother survivors, but -- do you exchange your stories?",
        "A: S-Somewhat, but we really do not. What we do is talk about our grandchildren.\nCan -- I just feel bad that I forgot my daughter\u2019s college. Can I just mention it --",
        "Q: Course.",
        "A: -- it was -- she went to Syracuse. And Mishy, please forgive me, but sometimes\nmy mind goes blank. And -- and I have another grandson that went to Ithaca. So\nBrian, again, please forgive me, but I always think about you anyway. My mind\nsometimes goes blank.",
        "Q: You -- you did talk about some very memorable experiences you had in the\nmuseum, such as talking to that woman whose father was an SS officer. You -- you\nhad told us about this special experience you had with this woman whose father\nhad been an SS officer. Are there any other memorable experiences that you\u2019ve\nhad at the museum when you were down there volunteering?\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "A: Oh, I have a lot. You know, it will take forever for me to talk about it. Well, th -\n- that experience with this lady, it wasn\u2019t in the Holocaust Museum, it was in the\nChildren\u2019s Museum on -- on -- you know, on Third Street, I spoke there, too. In\nthe Holocaust Museum, I -- at one time -- he was from Germany, you know, and\nhe was very upset, and he s -- comes over to me and he says to me, you have a\nnerve to -- to -- to have this Holocaust Museum here in the United States. Why\ndon\u2019t you have a museum what you did to the Indians? I s -- and I saw he was very\nupset and I knew I can\u2019t make a lot of noises there, because people will come over\nand will make a scene. I begged him to sit down. Actually, you know, I was trying\nto be very nice to him to calm him down. And he did -- he did sit, he sat down and\nhe was shooting off at the nu -- United States, I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s not enough that I\nwas hurting from the Holocaust, but then he started about the United States, I'll\ntell you -- I -- I mean -- but I knew that I have to be patient with him, that I am in\nthe museum and I cannot afford on having a -- a scene there. So after he stopped\ntalking, I said to him, you know, I let you talk now for about five, six minutes,\nright? And now, allow me to say something, and I\u2019m not going to talk for five, six\nminutes. I just want you to know that the United States talks about what happened\nto the Indians. In the United States we teach our children what happened to the uni\n-- to the Indians. Tell me, do you teach your children what happened in the\nHolocaust, what your ancestors did? So don\u2019t tell me -- and come telling me what\nFebruary 21, 2001\nthe United States has the right to do and not the right to do. And as you see, we in\nthe United States constantly are trying to right the wrong. Are you doing the same\nthing? Even today, you know, there is a lot of Arab -- you know, different\ncountries people, there are -- still discriminated. They still cannot tolerate them.\nWe have a melting pot here. People from all over the world, they come here and\nthey find a -- a secure place. At least their life are -- aren\u2019t threatened. Does your\ncountry do the same thing? Well, then he left. Well, I -- you know, you get in\ndifferent characters. I-I\u2019m not blaming all German society about it, but you get\nthese people in. Some of them are very happy, some of them -- some of them --\nwell, I get so many, you know, I could talk for a di -- shall I tell you what\nhappened once? That was in the museum. You know, we work right there as\npeople come down from the museum, and she was a -- she was a mature lady and\nshe came down and I see her cry, so I thought maybe she got sick, so I took a chair\nand gave it to her to sit down and sh-she just you know, goes back and forth. I\nsays, lady, you know, I would very much like to help you. And she looks at me and\nshe still wouldn\u2019t talk to me. And then she stays there and cries. I says, you know, I\nwish I could help you. So I pulled her over to the desk and I says, please sit down.\nThen, after awhile sort of, she loosened up and she says to me, she\u2019s so upset. I\nsays, tell me, why are you so upset? She says, well you know -- she must have\nbeen a religious lady. She says, you know, Jesus was a Jew, and when he\u2019ll find\nFebruary 21, 2001\nout what happened to the Jews, how will I explain it? I says -- at first I didn\u2019t catch\non, but then I says to her, what do you mean? She says, well you know, when I die,\nPll meet Jesus and he might ask me and I will not know how to explain. I says,\nlook, lady --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Helen Goldkind, and this is tape number three,\nside B, and you were talking about the woman who was so upset about after she\ndied and she would have to tell Jesus what happened to the Jews.",
        "A: So I said to her, you know, I-I\u2019m Jewish, I said to her. But in our religion\neverybody is responsible of their own actions. So please, did you kill any of these\nJews? She says no, I wouldn\u2019t do that. I says, believe me, I know you wouldn\u2019t do\nthat. And -- so don\u2019t just -- maybe you\u2019ll tell him you didn\u2019t do that. And she still\ncouldn\u2019t swallow it, sh-she couldn\u2019t swallow it. But she was sitting there for awhile\nand we were exchanging what she believes in and what I believe in and somehow I\nmade her feel that, you know what? There are some very -- you know, there are a\nlot of guilty people. I mean, I don\u2019t want to say -- you know, I have to say first\nthere\u2019s a lot of guilty people, but also you know, we\u2019re all responsible. And I think\nthat\u2019s the way she felt. That\u2019s exactly the way she felt, that we are all responsible. I\nFebruary 21, 2001\nthink her religion made her feel like that. And I thought that was a nice lady, and I\ndon\u2019t think Pll ever forget her either.",
        "Q: You mean that we\u2019re all responsible for each other? Ri -- is that what you mean,\nor responsible for the guilt?",
        "A: In a way we all responsible because you see, if there would be enough people to\nsay, we cannot gas a million and a half children, then the world would hear it, but\nthere was a silence. So they didn\u2019t take the responsibility of -- of saying it. That sh\n-- he or she carries the responsibility, she is saying, wait a minute, I don\u2019t like that.\nIf there would be more people crying and saying that, 1-1 -- you know, a tragedy\nlike this wouldn\u2019t have happened. So she sticks out in my mind. I hugged her and\nwe parted as friends, sort of, and I was glad that I got an opportunity to talk to her,\nand it was a good experience for me too, yeah.",
        "Q: When you come into the museum, when you walk into the building every time,\ndo you have a special feeling? When you cross the threshold, when you walk in?",
        "A: Your -- your -- you\u2019re not going to believe this. Wi -- you know, I walk in here,\nI walk in there and if I see people coming, it makes me very happy. And if I see\nthat people stop coming, I s-say to myself, oh my God, I hope these doors never\nclose, because we need to learn, this place is so important. You know what, I think\nperhaps it\u2019s even more important than I -- you know -- even though, you know, I --\nI think universities are very important, especially to me, because I\u2019m not an\nFebruary 21, 2001\neducated person, a-and -- but I think this museum is even more important because\nmaybe we can educate people to be better. And you know, there are -- the reason\nwhy I say this is this, because at this point today we know that the uneducated\npeople were trying to save the Jew, and the educated people, like Mengele and\nthousands of others could commit this at-atrocity. You se -- you understand what\nI\u2019m trying to say? So, you know, I think if a person isn\u2019t educated, but if h-he 1s\nbrought up with the idea that we should be different and we can be different, it\u2019s\nvery important. We think we\u2019re very sophisticated and you know, as human\nbeings, but we\u2019re capable of doing a lot of unthinkable things, and that needs to\nchange.",
        "Q: Are there any particular parts of the museum and their exhibits that you identify\nwith?",
        "A: All of it, what shall I tell you? All of it. I went through all this, believe it or not.\nAll this, it\u2019s hard to believe. It\u2019s hard to believe, all this, wherever I go. I look at\nthe little windows and I remember I -- you know, every little thing has got a story\nfor me there. You know, as we were going to Auschwitz we didn\u2019t know where we\nwere going. So I was li -- you know, y -- a -- next to my brother, I was, you know,\nthe yo -- the younger. And they pulled me up to look outside, I wanted to see\nwhat\u2019s going on outside, and we were passing farms where people were working\non the farms. And they\u2019re motioning with their hands across their throat that we\u2019re\nFebruary 21, 2001\ngoing to be, you know -- and when I said it, I didn\u2019t even think about it twice,\nbecause who would think, I\u2019m a healthy person, that somebody 1s going to want to\nkill me. I just didn\u2019t think about it. To tell you the truth, I wasn\u2019t affected by it. So,\nthe window -- then I see these farmers, they\u2019re motioning this to me -- everything,\neverything, everything. I take a look around and I see my life. Everything, yes.",
        "Q: So you intend to keep working at the museum as long as you can?",
        "A: Definitely. Absolutely. I think I want this to be, how shall I say it? My last\nbreath. Maybe I\u2019m too strong about it, but as long as I can do it, Pll -- this is where\nI want to -- I think that\u2019s where I belong. Sometimes I go with the subway and I\nsay to -- you know, there\u2019s a funny feeling [indecipherable] says, you know, I\nthink I\u2019m gonna -- I\u2019m gonna visit my family, you know? I get such crazy\nthoughts. I don\u2019t know why, but it\u2019s silly.",
        "Q: You mean you -- you feel when you go in there you\u2019re visiting your family, is\nthat what you mean?",
        "A: Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes. I reach out to them, in my head, in my\nheart, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s -- you know, I hate to say it because it doesn\u2019t sound\nnormal, but sometimes yes.",

I really didn\u2019t, I\nwas fighting it off and finally he says, you know, ra -- Helen, I understand it\u2019s\ndifficult for you, but I have to go. [coughs] Excuse me. And so what -- he decided\nthat he has to go, I says, well, I have to go with him. So we went once to\nAuschwitz with a group. And he -- he made a prayer there, for all of them actually,\nfor all of them. Anyway --",
        "Q: Did -- did you go -- you went inside the camp? You were able to do that?",
        "A: Can you cut it, or not?",
        "Q: Yeah. [tape break]",
        "A: The most important thing in my life I already lost, so whatever, you know, I\ndon\u2019t take it to -- you know? Some people get upset, sometimes I look at them --\nover really things they shouldn\u2019t. So I --",
        "Q: We were talking about that you went back with your husband to Auschwitz and\nI asked if you went inside the camp when you went on your visit.",
        "A: You see, people that go to see this camp, really, they took apart the camp. They\nleft there a few barracks. The gas chamber was there. For me, I saw the whole\nthing the way it was, but my husband didn\u2019t really see it the way it was. So --\ncourse everybody was sad and crying there because we knew, we all knew the loss\nand what went on there. But it\u2019s different. It\u2019s different than when I was there. It\u2019s\ndifferent. And I was so upset, let me tell you that. They have a -- like a museum, at\nFebruary 21, 2001\nleast when I was there, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on there today. They have a\nmuseum there with pictures, and names. And we had a guide, and I looked at these\npictures, because you know, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re Jewish or not Jewish,\nyou look the same to me. People look the same. But then I noticed there was a lot -\n- that there wasn\u2019t any Jewish names that you would call. And I look around and I\nspend some time there, I couldn\u2019t believe this. So I said to myself, it\u2019s -- maybe it\u2019s\nme, because you know, it\u2019s maybe -- but there weren\u2019t any Jewish names under\nthese pictures. So I go over to the guide, I says, listen, can you explain me\nsomething, because I don\u2019t understand it. You know, I\u2019m the one who was here in\nAuschwitz and I brought here my whole family, 89 people, tell me how come that\nthere isn\u2019t a name that has a -- sort of a Jewish name. She says to me, well you\nknow -- you know, you remember when you came to Auschwitz you had to take\nyour valise and throw it in the ditch? I says yes, I remember, I -- I do remember.\nAnd so we don\u2019t have any documents who came here as a Jew, but we do have the\ndocuments who came here that weren\u2019t Jews. So I said to her, you know what?\nYou told me something new that I didn\u2019t realize. I didn\u2019t know that there were\nsome s -- because this is a destruction camp, and I didn't know that there were\nsome non-Jews came here to be destroyed. I knew there were in different camps,\nsome people that resisted Hitler, but I didn\u2019t think they came all the way to\nAuschwitz. So you just told me something new. So it\u2019s okay, now I will\nFebruary 21, 2001\nunderstand it. But [indecipherable]. So she told me there are no Jewish names\nbecause there is no record of it, that Jews were sent to Auschwitz. I says, you\nmean to say a million and a half children that you know went to the gas chamber\nhere and there wasn\u2019t one name of a child? I was so upset there, you have no idea. I\nwas very, very upset. I don\u2019t know what they did with the rest of it there now. I\ndon\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but I better don\u2019t go there because today I can\u2019t take\nthe pain any more. I-I\u2019m too old. So when you talk about this Holocaust Museum,\nwe scraped here a few documents, there a few documents. I mean, they can say a\nhundred years from today it doesn\u2019t even happen because we don\u2019t have no\ndocuments of any kind. So I think that\u2019s important there.",
        "Q: Well, the --",
        "A: That\u2019s my experience with Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Did you go back to where you lived? Did you go back?",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t le-let us go there because the Russians were there.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: So we -- I couldn\u2019t go there and I really didn\u2019t want to go there to face these\npeople, I don\u2019t think I could.",
        "Q: Why not?",
        "A: Because it would be very difficult for me. It would be very difficult for me. Not\nthat it wasn\u2019t difficult to go to Auschwitz, but it would be more -- it would be just\nFebruary 21, 2001\nas difficult over there. Don\u2019t forget, these people lived there for generations and\ngenerations and generations and generations. In the wit -- with -- way they made us\n-- way they made us look, like we were less than rats to these people. So how can\nthey look at me and have any respect for me? And why should I go there? The\nworld is plenty big and it will take generations and generations to come for Europe\nto recuperate to see a Jew as any other normal person, I want to tell you that. The\ndamage that was done there, that\u2019s the way I feel.",
        "Q: Do you get reparations?",
        "A: Yes, I do.",
        "Q: What is your feeling about that?",
        "A: Oh well, Il have to tell you the story about it. In the beginning I didn\u2019t want to\nhear about it. Oh, when I heard it, I -- Ic -- I cried, I carried on, and I says, there is\nno money to pay me what they took away from me, it\u2019s ridiculous, I says, I -- I\ndon\u2019t want it and I was fighting it. It took me maybe two years with my husband\nback and forth. You see, he -- I was emotional about it and he was realistic about it.\nHe couldn\u2019t reach me and I couldn\u2019t reach him. So finally, what did the sale from\nhim, where he, you know, sort of hit the nail o-o-on the head, is telling me, you\nknow, Helen, I know you don\u2019t want this money, but what you should do is take\nthis money and help other people that are suffering. And I said to myself, now\nmaybe -- maybe I\u2019m just -- maybe reality, that\u2019s what the -- realistically that\u2019s what\nFebruary 21, 2001\nI should do. But for a long time I was very emotional about it, that I couldn\u2019t even\nthink realistically. So -- but that\u2019s what I did, that\u2019s exactly what I do. I never use a\npenny of it, never, because I would feel like I want to, you know. So then I says,\nyou know, I did send this check there and there and I\u2019m hoping that m-made\nsomebody feel better. I do that. I do that.",
        "Q: What was it like for you to become an American citizen?",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: And what does it mean to you today?",
        "A: I need to get on my va -- vocabulary isn\u2019t too big, and I need -- sometimes when\nI\u2019m looking for a certain word I have to think about it, and I still don\u2019t get it. I was\ndelighted to become an American citizen. I -- I -- I bless America as much as --\nyou know, to me, being a -- I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s perfect, but for a person like me, I\nsee the United States a little bit different than other people do, different. Because\nthe other people feel that this is the way life is, and that\u2019s the way, you know -- I\nlove the United States and I am delighted that I, you know, 1-if I want to make\nmyself feel good, as I said before, I -- I says, I gave the United States three kids\nthat are the best of citizens and a -- [ -- I-I really love the United States. And you\nknow what? If I hear somebody complaining, which there\u2019s plenty complaints, I\nvery patiently listen, you know, I listen, and -- but I always want to debate it. I\ndon\u2019t let it just go. I feel th -- I showed the other side of the coin and I have so\nFebruary 21, 2001\nmuch material to show on the other side of the coin, but I never let it go. Just like I\nwould speak up for this child that is in danger, that\u2019s how I feel about the United\nStates. I need to speak up, and I do. I do.",
        "Q: Well, speaking of these three wonderful citizens that you gave to the United\nStates, is there any message that you wanted to leave for your children or your\ngrandchildren?",
        "A: I wish I could find some words of wisdom. I used to tell my husband to do that.\nWell first, I\u2019m just lucky to have -- to ha -- you know, I know life comes to an end,\nI\u2019m just lucky that I had the opportunity of experiencing even to have my children.\nAnd not only are -- are they wonderful children to me, but they\u2019re just -- they\u2019re\njust very good citizens. I feel if my children are around someplace or somewheres\nwhere somebody will be [indecipherable] I have a feeling that they will want to be\nthere the first ones. My grandchildren are like I can\u2019t believe it. They\u2019re such a big\npart of my good feeling in. They\u2019re such nice kids, all of them, all of them, all of\nthem. And well, in the end, I -- you know, I just want to say that God took away a\nlot from me, but he also gave me back a lot. And my hope and pray is that they\ntake good care of themselves and they continue in this world, being a model for\nsociety.",
        "A: Are your children named after anybody 1n particular?\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "Q: My daughter, when she was born there were so many names. In the meantime I\ndidn\u2019t have a mother and Abe didn\u2019t have a mother. So, how do -- what do we do\nwith all these names? I wanted to name her a dozen names. So I se -- I said to Abe,\nwell, you know what? Today we\u2019ll ma -- you know, Monday we\u2019ll call her this,\nTuesday we\u2019 ll call her that. It was such a crazy thought to me, honestly, I\nremember. So he was laughing, he says, you know you\u2019re not being realistic. We\nneed a name. So finally he said we\u2019ll -- half of my mother\u2019s name and a half of my\nhusband\u2019s name. So that was the compromise. My second daughter came and Abe\nhad his father. So here I -- I wanted to name her after my father, because I didn't\nthink I\u2019m gonna have more children. We just thought of having two children. So\nthat was big problem. Here this beautiful little kid is born and we want to name her\nafter my father. And so my husband went all over the city to look for a name that\nyou can translate from a man\u2019s name to a Jewish name. He went to the synagogues,\nto the library, he brought me all kinds of books to the hospital. And finally we\nfound the name, and so she is named after my father, and we named her Michelle.\nThis is my second. But I'll tell you, it was such an anxiety every time we would\nhave to pick a name, because we needed to give these kid -- kids 16 names, like\nnever before, you know? So it was a big thing to us, my husband spent a few days\non figuring out how should we name this beautiful child. So it -- and then my son.\nSo then my son came and, you know, so already my father had a name and of\nFebruary 21, 2001\ncourse my oldest brother also got killed by picking mines. So I wanted that name\nbadly and my husband was trying to accommodate me because e-even though he\nhad a big loss, too, you know, all of his relatives were in Europe. But he knew that\nmeant a lot to me, so he says okay, we going to name this child after your family,\nhe ga -- so he says -- so I says, you know, I want to name him after my oldest\nbrother, something. He says, but you know, in the Jewish faith, you cannot name a\nchild after a young person. So he says, I\u2019Il tell you what, let\u2019s name him after your\nbrother and after my grandfather, so [indecipherable] his name is Larry.

        "Q: You\u2019ve already gone in detail in your previous interview, so before we begin, I\nwill summarize some o-of your experiences. You came from a large, religiously\nobservant family, of which you were the sixth of seven children, and you had many\nextended relatives. When the Germans occupied the town in 1944, you and your\nfamily were forced into a ghetto and then after one or two months transported by\ncattle car to Auschwitz. You and your sister Sylvia, who was three and a half years\nolder than you were in Auschwitz for five weeks. And the other members there of\nyour family did not survive. Then with a group of 1,000 girls, you and Sylvia were\ntaken to Germany to work in an ammunition factory, being exposed to the burning\ngun powder. You were then transported to Bergen-Belsen where you were\nliberated by the British on April 15\", 1945. Before we continue, I\u2019d like to clarify\nsome things. How would you describe yourself as a child? This is, of course,\nbefore the war. Were you very independent, were you physically strong? How\nwould you -- what would you say you were?",

So finally he said we\u2019ll -- half of my mother\u2019s name and a half of my\nhusband\u2019s name. So that was the compromise. My second daughter came and Abe\nhad his father. So here I -- I wanted to name her after my father, because I didn't\nthink I\u2019m gonna have more children. We just thought of having two children. So\nthat was big problem. Here this beautiful little kid is born and we want to name her\nafter my father. And so my husband went all over the city to look for a name that\nyou can translate from a man\u2019s name to a Jewish name. He went to the synagogues,\nto the library, he brought me all kinds of books to the hospital. And finally we\nfound the name, and so she is named after my father, and we named her Michelle.\nThis is my second. But I'll tell you, it was such an anxiety every time we would\nhave to pick a name, because we needed to give these kid -- kids 16 names, like\nnever before, you know?

I -- my uncle gave me a quarter to go and get\nmyself ice cream, to a place where I used to go and get this ice cream, it was a big\ntreat for a child.

And she was screaming, please tell the world what is\nhappening to us, if you survive. Try to survive. Actually her words were like that,\ntry to survive, and if you do, tell the world what happened here. And of course, you\nknow, my grandfather also had a terrible experience there. I don\u2019t know if I can go\non talking about it.",
        "A: Can I talk about it?",
        "A: Okay. Well, my grandfather came -- well, they took him from home. He -- he\nhad the Torah scroll with him, because when they closed our synagogues, he\nmanaged to take out a Torah scroll. So our house became a school and I think his\nhouse became a house of worship. And when they told us we have to leave the\nhouse, he took the Torah scroll with him. And when we got to Auschwitz, he came\nFebruary 21, 2001\ndown from the train with this Torah scroll and they made -- they -- they told him to\n-- to throw the Torah scroll into the ditch and he wouldn\u2019t do that, so you know, he\n-- they were beating on him and we ran over to him and pleaded with him, please,\nplease throw the Torah scroll down and he just wouldn\u2019t do it and they kept on\nbeating on him and then th -- they really -- you know, they beat him to death and\nright in front of us he fell with the Torah scrolls, and -- so we saw this tragedy right\nin front of us, and I think in -- that\u2019s what f -- then they took my grandfather and\nthey threw him in a truck. And I think she kept that in mind all the time, that she\nneeds -- she has a need to tell this to someone. And that -- I think that -- that made\nher stronger, to say I have to survive to tell it to someone what happened, because I\ndon\u2019t think they\u2019 Il believe it.",
        "A: Well, you must understand, when people are put in a situation where survival is\nthe only thing, so it was very difficult to help each other because we were all in the\nsame boat, with the same thing. But we -- we did try. You know, if we saw\nsomebody fainted we were there for them, of course. But there was nothing we\nreally can do to help them, they probably, you know, they were fainting out of\nFebruary 21, 2001\nhunger or -- or weakness. And it was -- it was very, very difficult. It wasn\u2019t that\none had more than the other to be able to help each other, it wasn\u2019t like that.

And I sa -- you know, so she tells\nme, you know, there are some tanks out there and they don\u2019t look like they\u2019re\nGerman tanks. So I said to her, you know, maybe this is the end and things will be\nbetter.

And then the British opened up the\nbarracks, and when they looked into the barracks, it was terrible because they\nwouldn\u2019t let us out to the bathrooms. Everybody was doing everything they needed\nat -- in the barracks and a | -- a lot of them were very sick. It just -- they opened --\nthey probably thought it was worse -- it was -- really was worse than a crazy house.\nSo they were asking us what they can do for us, and they tried very hard to help us,\nbut as I said, it was a little too late. They took my sister and I didn\u2019t know where sh\n-- they took her.

And then when we got to Sweden, I --\nthere was another shocker, for me anyway, because I think I almost lost my o --\nbelief in humanity. And when they took over, I -- again, I hate to repeat myself, I\nlooked like -- I still looked like a skeleton because I was so sick, and they nurtured\nme, they bathed me, they fed me, I had no strength to eat.

But I was just thinking, I don\u2019t think hell\ncould be that bad.",
        "A: Yes, she met us at the boat. She had two kids, beautiful, beautiful, two boys and\n-- but you know, she wasn\u2019t a wealthy woman, so she took us in to her apartment,\nshe had a one bedroom apartment, walking up three flights. But she was so happy\nto have us there and we were so happy to be there together. I remember we slept in\nthe living room on a bed that closed up, you know, because she couldn\u2019t keep it\nopen, then the kids wouldn\u2019t have where to play. But it was very nice. I mean, you\nknow, she was just wonderful, she was just wonderful. And, you know, I wanted to\ngo to school but I saw that I had to go and provide for myself. You know, you\ncouldn\u2019t help seeing it. So, I went to school at night and I went to look -- actually, I\nFebruary 21, 2001\nthink what really saved me from not mourning there forever is because I knew I\nhave to get out and get a job. And so I tried getting a job, and you know, I wasn\u2019t\ntrained for anything, and I -- I -- although I-I-I was learning how to speak English\nfor n -- for close to a year, but still -- I understood most of it but I couldn\u2019t speak it\ntoo well. So there are so many drawbacks for me to get a job. Well, 1t took me\nabout two, three weeks going every day. My brother-in-law, he would take me and\npaid for my carfare, for my token because I had no money. And I was going around\nand he helped me, he came with me at times, and they were telling me they would\nlove to hire me, but I\u2019m not trained for anything. And of course, you know, when I\ncame from Sweden [ didn\u2019t have money to buy clothes, so I was walking around\nwith this big -- these big sweaters and these heavy pants. You know, I didn\u2019t really\nlook that presentable, either. So one day I -- there was a big place, a fur place, and\nmy brother-in-law took me up there to ask for a job and I went over to the boss and\nI asked for a job and he looked at me, and I told him my problem and he was very\nsympathetic, but he says to me, I wish I would, but I don\u2019t know where to put you\nbecause you do -- y-you don\u2019t know what to do. I mean you -- where -- wa -- how -\n- I says, I\u2019m going to do anything you want me to do, just -- just please give me a\njob. He looked around and sadly said, I\u2019m sorry. So, I wanted to see how this\nfactory looks like because I heard so much about it and how it works and all that.\nSo from the office I sneaked into the factory. I opened the door and I see that\u2019s the\nFebruary 21, 2001\nfactory. So I walk in there just to see the factory and while I was passing, I saw\nthere an old man standing and he had a beard and he wasn\u2019t working, he was just\nstanding, looking around. And I said to mys -- you know, in my -- my grandfather\ncame in front of me, he had a black hat like my grandfather ha-had, but he was a\nlittle shorter than my grandfather, my grandfather was very tall. So I walked over\nto him and I -- I felt that I can speak Yiddish to him and I did. And I told him my\nstory. I-I says, you know, y -- I don\u2019t know if you know the tragedy on what has\nhappened to the Jews in Europe, but I survived with my sister and I came out here,\nand I have a sister, but I -- I can see she cannot feed me or take care of me, I\u2019m\nforced to get a job and I don\u2019t know what to do. And the man listened and listened\nand listened. And then he says to me, wait a minute. So I said to myself, why not?\nI'll wait. I have no place to go and no -- nothing to do. Pll wait at -- and a -- I -- I --\nI was watching where he was going and I saw him go to the same man that just told\nme that he doesn\u2019t have a job for me and I thought I was going to faint. And he was\nstanding there and standing there with this man, and standing there and talking to\nhim. And then he finally comes back and he says to me, come back tomorrow. I\nsays, tomorrow? What time? He said nine o\u2019clock. When I came back, I stayed\nnear the door, eight o\u2019clock I was already there waiting the door -- for the door to\nbe opened. And finally I went in there, into the office. Shall I continue? A -- so\nanyway, I went to the office, they took one look at me and as I said, I didn\u2019t look\nFebruary 21, 2001\nso presentable. It was a problem. And he must have promised his father, that was\nthe son of this old man, he was the boss and I didn\u2019t know at that time. So this man\nwouldn\u2019t leave the son until he would promise him he\u2019ll give me some kind of a\njob. So they looked at me and they had -- it was a very big place and they had their\nown designers and were so many secretaries in this office. So the de -- I don\u2019t\nknow, I think she was one of the designers, or whatever. She takes one look at me\nand she says to me, you never go shopping. I's -- wi -- I said to her, you know,\nthere is a problem, I don\u2019t have no money. She takes another look at me, she says,\nwell don\u2019t worry about it, we'll -- we\u2019ll bill it to the -- to the company. So I had no\nchoice, I go with her and this lady, I tell you, she knew exactly what to do. She\nknew exactly what to do with me. She -- she took me in. I remember they were\nsmaller stores. Now that I know there\u2019s -- was Macy\u2019s and everything, but she\ndidn\u2019t want to waste time. So she took me into these smaller stores and took out\ndifferent dresses. And every time she brought a dress for me to put on -- first of all,\nI -- you know, I didn't have a bra, I didn\u2019t have anything. Sh -- so she got me a\nlittle bra and stockings, she put stockings on me, I never had stockings in my life.\nAnd she -- we -- we bought a pair of shoes with a little heel, I think it was an inch\nand a half, or -- and she tells me I should get dressed and then she brings these\ndresses. I says, you know, they\u2019re so expensive, I -- you know, and I don\u2019t have\nany money. She says, don\u2019t worry about it, just put it on. So I put it on and I tell\nFebruary 21, 2001\nyou, I looked like a different person. You know, I just looked like a different\nperson. Then she went and took my -- my hair was raw, you know. She took my\nhair and put it in a bun, and then she put a little lipstick on me. And she bought a\nlot of clothes that I wasn\u2019t paying much attention because it was scaring me. And\nwe went back and we got into the office and -- and I tell you, I did look different, I\nmust say. And so the boss came in and he took a look in the office because he was\nin the main place, you know, watching the workers. And I saw him looked at --\nlooking at me twice, like to say well, is that the same girl? So, anyway, then they\ngave me a job. They had a vy -- like a [indecipherable] house, where very rich\nladies came in to pick out skins for their coats. I didn\u2019t realize how rich these\nwomen were at that time. And they were training me on what to say to them and\nhow to deal with them and in no time I was so anxious to hold this job that -- and\nthen I-I didn\u2019t mind staying after the time, or I never went down for lunch. I would\n-- my sister would give me a Jell-o sandwich, I would quickly eat it right there, and\nI was trying my best they should keep me there. And after awhile -- after awhile\nthey saw how -- I became a good thing for them, too. You know, they paid me,\nthey paid me well and I became a good thing for them too, because whatever they\nneeded, or -- they could do with me. And then had models when -- whenever a\nbuyer would come from a different city, they would call a -- a model, or a few\nmodels, matter of fact, and they came in, it was a very big place. So one time I\nFebruary 21, 2001\nbecame lucky and a model didn\u2019t show up, and you know, that lady, she says, well,\nwhy don\u2019t we call in Helen? So they called Helen in and I came there and they\nsaid to me, listen, put on this coat and take a walk. You know, on a walk. I put on\nthe coat and I took a walk, and you know, I was younger, taller, I tell you. A-\nAnyway, I took a walk and this buyer said to me, take another walk. I smiled at\nhim and I took another walk. And it went well, you know, it went well. So finally\nthat lady said to the boss, let\u2019s send her to modeling school. So -- so they send me\nto modeling school for a few hours, but I still had to come into work to get my\npaycheck. After a few weeks, what happened was they told me the same thing, yen\n-- you know, put your chest out, you know, lift your head, walk graciously. You\nknow, how many times do you need to be told what to do? So I walked over to her,\nI says, listen, I don\u2019t mind going there, but it seems to me like I know everything\nalready what to do. And I did it, you know, I sort of did it -- evidently a good job\nbecause then, when a buyer would come in, they would ask, is Helen going to be\nthere? Somebody tipped me off that a -- a buyer was asking about me, then I felt\nalready secure with the job. Then I felt so happy. I was so happy, you have no idea.\nAnyway, I wound up with a beautiful job and people were very nice to me and they\npaid me a lot, I thought at that time, they paid me a lot. I think I was getting 75\ndollar a -- a week. You see, and what happened was, they paid these models by the\nFebruary 21, 2001\nhour. And here I\u2019m willing to anything they want me to do for 75 dollars a week.\nBut they paid me overtime if would come in on Saturday. And I ju --",

        "A: When I first came over, of course I felt different. Of course I felt different,\nmuch different. When I started working and I saw how the people were really nice\nto me, I think it\u2019s because they realized where I came from, what I went through.\nAnd I don\u2019t know if I should tell that. I felt th -- maybe because, you know, where\nI came from that rejection was difficult for me. There were two nephews, you\nknow, young boys that worked 1n that place, the bosses, and they felt like they\nwere big shots. And even though I had a beautiful job, you know, one was pretty\nnice to me, and the other one, for a reason or another, he was constantly bugging\nme. And I thought this is my problem, but then I -- I -- you know, my sister says,\nwhat do you even bother looking at him? I -- I says, well he\u2019s the bosses nephew\nand he keeps on coming in to the showroom and constantly bugging me, you know,\ntelling -- you know, he was -- he wasn\u2019t a nice person, I think. So that was about\nthat I felt at work. You know, everybody else was nice, somehow, everybody else\nwas very, very, very nice.",
        "A: It\u2019s much better, because I was going to night school, and I started speaking. I\nhad the background of English, but I didn\u2019t ta -- speak it. So -- matter of fact, I still\nhave the English dictionary brought from Sweden. And -- so I got along well. I -- I\n-- | picked it up quickly.

        "A: Right.",
        "A: Oh, I worked there for over a year and I don\u2019t know if you want me to go into\nthat story. I met -- shall I tell you what happened with me privately? I -- my -- my\nth -- a-after a few month, after I got the job -- after I got the job, you know, as -- so\n[ -- I had pretty clothes because th-the -- the company gave me this clothes and I di\n-- matter of fact, they even gave me a fur coat. So -- so I -- my sister says, you\nknow, why don\u2019t you just go out of the house on a Saturday night? You know, you\nsit in here and crying all the time, and just get out. So we -- my sister came with\nfour friends and I was the fifth one. Nobody came from the school at the time I --\nwhen I came. So we were like together five, and we kept together again because\n35February 21, 2001\nwe had this background. So finally on Saturday night, we decided we\u2019ll go to New\nYork. And as we walking th -- in New York, we heard music. So --\nFebruary 21, 2001\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: So anyway, one Saturday we did go to New York and we heard this music there\nand we peeked in to see people were having a wonderful time, with dancing and all\nthat, and we felt, let\u2019s just watch and see how people are living, you know? That\nwas the first time we went out into this world where we saw people living\nnormally, sort of. The youngsters, anyway. So we stood there for awhile. In the\nmeanti -- but you had to take your coats off in order -- you know, and check it in.\nSo we took our coats off and we checked in the coats and 1 -- you know, we were\nstanding there and a few guys came and asked these other girls to dance. But\nsomehow nobody asked me to dance. So anyway, I stayed there and two young\nman walked over and they talked to me and they saw I have an accent and they --\ntheir par -- ha -- their parents were Hungarians, and they knew a few words\nHungarian, so they were -- sure enough they were having a good time. And me\nbeing so depressed, I was looking at them, I says, why are they so happy? What is\nto -- so funny? You know, saying a word in Hungarian, I looked at them like\nthey\u2019re a -- you know, I didn\u2019t understand them. I didn\u2019t understand that they\u2019re\nFebruary 21, 2001\njust normal, happy young man. So they stood with me for awhile, but then they\nwalked away again. And I was waiting there for awhile, waiting for these girls to\ncome back, so a man with a girl comes over to me and he says, would you like to\ndance? I says to him, no, I don\u2019t dance. So he detected a -- an accent and he looked\nat me again and he wondered why I been standing there alone and I\u2019m not dancing,\nwhat are you doing here? So he says, look, would you like to have a drink? I says,\nno, I don\u2019t drink. I was -- I was thinking, you know, I\u2019m waiting for the girls. I\ndon\u2019t want to -- you know, start in with anything. So this girl that he came with had\nto say goodbye because she had to go home. In the meantime, this -- this young\nman is not leaving, a-a-and so he says to me, like he -- he -- then he got like, would\nyou like to -- would you like a Coke? I says n -- well, I don\u2019t know if I can go and\nhave a Coke because I\u2019m waiting for my friends and they\u2019re supposed to come\nsoon and we\u2019re gonna go home. So I says -- so he says, well come, we\u2019ll just get a\nCoke and we\u2019ll come right back. So that\u2019s what happened. In the meantime, I had\nto tell him who I was, that I\u2019m a survivor and I just came from where -- well, then I\nbecame an object to him, that he wanted to know what happened because he -- I\nwas the first survivor that he came -- he came in contact with. Well, I want to tell\nyou something, he started asking me questions and every question he gave me, it\njust -- I wanted to really hit him, because -- and he didn\u2019t realize what he was\nquestioning. And then he -- he -- so I told him, you know, you\u2019 re talking to me like\nFebruary 21, 2001\nit\u2019s -- like you\u2019re cross examining me. He says, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. I just want to\nknow what happened there, do you understand? And I wasn\u2019t ready to talk. And\nthe more I resisted not talking, the more he wanted to know. So our meet -- first\nmeeting didn\u2019t go too well. He -- he -- and like, you know, he -- he would ask me -\n- he -- he really didn\u2019t mean to hurt me or anything, but he didn\u2019t know how to deal\nwith me. So he says to me, you know, I read in the papers that they were taking\nyoung women for the Germans. I says, y-you heard right, but they were taking --\nwhat happened was whenever they -- they took the Czech girls, they picked them\nup from the street if they saw a Czech girl, a Polish girl, they did use them for the -\n- for the arm -- for the army, but the Jews were picked to be killed, not you know,\ntaking them there. At -- so I -- I said to myself, a lot of Jewish girls probably would\nfeel lucky if they -- you know, just to survive -- to -- to -- to be able to do that.\nAnyway -- but it was very, you know, it wasn\u2019t -- 1t wasn\u2019t good. So then he finally\nsays to me, listen, I want to take you home. I says no, you\u2019re not taking me home,\ncause I\u2019m going to go home with the five of these girls. So the girls finally came. I\n-- | think hey kept on staying there because he wanted to pull out words from me,\nyou see, because I wasn\u2019t ready to talk. I couldn\u2019t talk. And finally the girls came\nand you know, we are finished having a good time and we says, let\u2019s go home. So\nhe says to the girls, listen, I want to take you all home. So the girls says yeah, take\nme home. We were five of them. So I was between them, so -- he had a car. He had\nFebruary 21, 2001\na car. Matter of fact, he had a new car, a -- a Buick. So he sa -- we -- he took us\nhome and finally he dropped them all off and my sister and I were the last one and\nhe still wanted to talk and the guy says no, no, I have to go, you know, we\u2019re late,\nmy sister is going to worry, we\u2019re supposed to be home. So I -- I -- he says to me,\nI'll come and see you tomorrow. I says -- I heard him say it, but I didn\u2019t even\nanswer him, I just wanted to go in, because I was annoyed with him, the way he\ntalked. So finally we went in and my sister says, you know, I worried -- and then\nmy sister told us not to go into a car and we came in a car and we didn\u2019t want to lie\nto her. So we -- we told her what happened and nec -- next day I was washing the\nkitchen floor and I forgot about him, because I wasn\u2019t too nice to him. A-And the\nbell rings, and -- see, we didn\u2019t have a telephone in the apartment, a telephone was\ndownstairs and if there was a telephone for us, you know, somebody picked it up\nand rang our bell. And my sister was busy with the kids and I was washing the\nfloors. But -- so my sister says, Helen, run down and see who\u2019s on the telephone.\nSo I run down there barefooted, you know, because I was washing the kitchen on\nmy hands and knees. And I see this man standing there, I said to myself, what\nhappened here? Well, I did -- he did tell -- say that he\u2019s gonna come back, but I just\nwasn\u2019t paying any attention, my mind was so preoccupied with other things. So he\ncame back and he wants to go upstairs. I says look, I\u2019m in the middle of washing\nthe kitchen floor. I-It\u2019s very busy there, my sister is busy with the kids, I don\u2019t\nFebruary 21, 2001\nthink you can come upstairs. So he says, I'll tell you what, [Il wait in the hallway\nuntil you finish washing the floor. So he comes up and he stays in the hallway and\nmy sister says, who 1s he? So I says, you know, this is the guy that\n[indecipherable] yesterday. I told him that he can\u2019t come because we\u2019re busy here,\nbut he said -- he chose to stay in the hallway, so he\u2019s in the hallway. So my sister\nwas very nice, you know, she was normal, you know, she wasn\u2019t like me, you\nknow. So she walked out and she says, who are you, what are you? So he was very\ngood friends with the family of the Bestform. The -- their name was Benenfeld.\nYou see, he la -- he lan to the yeshiva with the Benenfeld\u2019s son-in-law. They had\none daughter and that son-in-law was a nephew of the geera rabba. So today\ngeera rabba don\u2019t mean anything, but in Europe it was a big situation. And my\nsister knew the Benenfelds, so she says -- so she felt a little embarrassed, she says,\nwell as soon as she finishes washing the kitchen, come on in. Because the kitchen\nwasn\u2019t that big, the apartment wasn\u2019t that big. So he came in and he talked, and my\nsister talked to him, you know, my sister talked to him. At that time -- at that point\nhe wasn\u2019t no longer a stranger, but he -- sh -- he made connections with my sister,\nactually. And he stood there, he says he\u2019s got to go to Richmond, he was from\nRichmond. He told me the truth, he had a place in Richmond, but then he -- he --\ne-everything he said he told the truth, but it didn't connect with me. So that night he\nleft for Richmond and he said that he wants to come back, and --\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "A: Abe Goldkind. And so when he went to Richmond, he telephoned me a few\ntimes and then he says he is sorry that he cannot see me this week because -- but\ndid I get the flowers? I says yes, I got the flowers, but you know what? I don\u2019t\nwant you to send me any flowers. Because they were roses and you know, after\nthree days in this apartment, the roses started dying. And don\u2019t ask, I couldn\u2019t deal\nwith that. To me those roses represented life and all of a sudden I\u2019m faced with\ndeath again. So anyway, he -- he just didn\u2019t understand what I was talking about,\nnobody did. And then he -- he did come to see me and -- but my sister wouldn\u2019t let\nme go with him because, you know, I was so young and you see, even though I\nwas 17 - 18 years old at that time, right, I was still like a child of 12. I had no\nexperience with -- you know, interacting with what -- so I didn\u2019t go out with him\nbecau -- you know, he was just come to visit me in my sister\u2019s house. And after\nawhile he got tired of it, he says, I want to take her to the Benenfelds. So my sister\nsays, well, you\u2019re telling me you\u2019re going to the Benenfelds? So she says yes, so\nhe got a cab and we went to the Benenfelds and I saw that, you know, he knows\nthese Benenfelds and they were four brothers and they were, you know, very close\nfriends, from home yet. So yeah, came back, I says, here I was in the Benenfeld\u2019s\nhouse and -- and after awhile he wants to take me to the movies, you know, a few\nweeks later when he came from Richmond. So now my sister said no, sh -- you\nFebruary 21, 2001\ncan\u2019t take her to the movies. So she says, okay. So he says, fil -- you know me\nalready, you know, you -- you must understand, I have a background. And I\nwouldn\u2019t hurt her, she was hurt enough. At that point he already understood who I\nam, where I come from. So my sister says, all right, well if you take her with a cab,\nPll let you go. And he had to park the car downstairs and take a cab, and we went\nto see Al Jolson. And that\u2019s how it started, you know. So actually, I think what the\nbeginning was he -- he really wanted to know what happened there. He was a very\ncurious person, and --",

If somebody would come and tell you they\u2019 re\ntaking hi -- little kids to the gas chamber, would you believe that? It has never\nhappened before, so people, even though they heard it, but they says, oh it\u2019s\nsomething, you know, that doesn\u2019t make sense.\nyou talk about your parents and life before the war?",
        "A: Oh yeah, a lot, a lot.

I -- you know, of course,\nafter awhile, after he was coming to see me from Richmond and he already felt\nlike he would want -- you know, he got interested in me, actually, after he was\nfinished with the stories of World War II, he moved his pla -- he had a -- a navy op\n-- army-navy store in Richmond and he said that I probably wouldn\u2019t want to live\nthere, so he moved it to Baltimore, just to show me that he will do anything I want\nto, because I told him I\u2019m not leaving my job, that he\u2019s got to get a job in -- in -- in\nNew York. And he says, you know, I-I-I\u2019m not a type of person to work for other\npeople, I need to work for myself. And back and forth. I didn\u2019t want to give up my\njob, my job meant so much to me because I was so happy there. I was so happy\nthere. But anyway, after awhile we came to an understanding, we will ga -- he\nwanted to get married. Now, I -- you see, I -- I don\u2019t think I was ready to do that,\nyou know. I -- I wanted to -- I don\u2019t know what I wanted to do, I don\u2019t know, I\ndon\u2019t know, I just wanted my job and I wanted to work and I wanted to go to\nschool, and -- but anyway, I agreed that -- you know, we all agreed because he\u2019s\nreally -- he really was a person with depth.

You know what they say? I\nwould never put her down. I carried her around constantly. I mean, I carried her\naround constantly, so what happened, being I didn\u2019t put her -- I was afraid the floor\nis dirty, I was -- I was so afraid I'll lose her. So -- and then she was born with big --\nwe had a problem, she was born with big adenoids and she couldn't take her bottle.\nSo I ha -- we had a doctor come in every day to the f -- when we fed her, they\ncouldn\u2019t -- like this she was healthy, but -- but she had this problem, she couldn\u2019t\ntake the bottle. So we had a doctor come in every day to look at her and finally the\ndoctor saw the kid can\u2019t breathe when she closes her mouth. He took a look in the\nnose and her nose was clutter -- she made history. They took her to John Hopkins\nand they opened up her nose and that\u2019s -- she could have died if this doctor\nwouldn\u2019t of -- I would have lost her. And the doctors kept on saying that I was the\ncrazy mother. But then they found that I wa -- you know, I had a reason, because I\nsaw the kid is losing weight and can\u2019t eat.

So again with the doctors I keep on saying -- she was\nalready -- she was already 20 months and this kid wouldn\u2019t walk. So I take her to\nFebruary 21, 2001\nthe doctors and the doctors see a healthy child. They didn\u2019t know what to do with\nher.

So he says, well, fa --\ntry putting her down the floor. Ee -- I -- e -- I says, but she\u2019s going to cry. So he\nsays, well let her cry a little bit, and move away from her. So I did that. You know,\nshe started crawling. Then she was looking, how can she get to me. So at 20 she\nstarted crawling. And then, you know, eventually, when I knew what the problem\nwas, I already, you know put her in a little wagon, and anyway, we dealt with the\nproblem. It was my problem, that I created, but this is the kind of mother I was. I\njust never put her down. Even I -- I was, you know, cooking, or I was giving my\nhusband to eat, she was always in my hands, she was like my hand. I could never\nput her down. It sounds crazy today. I never put her down.

And it wa -- she didn't -- I -- I\u2019m not\nin these pictures, but I said to myself, my God, if I would have fed her with al --\nwith this tragedy when she was young, I know the kid probably would have not\nsurvived, if she couldn\u2019t deal with it at that point.",
        "A: Well, we didn\u2019t talk -- we didn\u2019t talk about it to my grandchildren either. That --\nw-we made these decisions actually, because we did not want to bring up angry\nkids, or -- you know. Matter of fact, my daughter would say to me, Mommy, when\nPll grow up, I\u2019m going to do something so I can help people. I says -- oh, you\u2019ll be\nproud of me, I\u2019ll ca -- I-I\u2019ll help people. I says, sweetheart, I\u2019m already proud of\nyou, you\u2019re wonderful. Anyway -- so anyway, she is the one who became a\nmicrobiologist so that she can help people. So I\u2019m just -- I -- I-I\u2019m delighted that\nthey grew up that they would rather help and not hurt. Because once you start\nhurting one group, you wind up hurting the whole world.",
        "A: Oh yes, now -- now they all know my story. I would just -- can I talk about my\ngrandchildren a little bit, too? Because it means so much to me in my life, maybe\nmore than anything else that I -- me -- as a survivor could raise three kids that -- I\ndon\u2019t know how to say it -- that are real human beings. I would be heartbroken if\nmy kids would have wound up hating, because I saw what hate does. And -- and\nFebruary 21, 2001\nthey sort of go around with their normal life. I am forever thankful that the United\nStates gave me this chance to -- for a new life, but my reward to them are my\nchildren and my grandchildren. You know, I\u2019m so glad I brought them to the\nUnited States and they are good citizens and that makes me very happy. And now\nyou want to know about my grandchildren. I have two grandchildren that\ngraduated from Princeton and three grandchildren that graduated from Columbia\nUniversity, and four little grandchildren that go to the Jewish Day School. So I\u2019m\nvery happy about it.",
        "A: I have my daughter and son -- one my daughters and son living here in\nWashington and one of my daughters live in Tampa.",
        "A: Mm, mm-hm, I understand what you\u2019re saying, but my answer on that would be\nthis, I was so afraid being that I wasn\u2019t born here, and I have an accent that\nFebruary 21, 2001\nsomehow another my children m-might suffer from it, that I will not be able to\nguide them, you know, to the right places and do the right things. So I was\nconcentrating more or less on what\u2019s happening in their life. I was always on top of\nit. |always wanted to know how they\u2019re doing in school, and I always wanted\nthem to -- to go to Girl Scouts. And I always wanted them to do everything that\nother kids in the United States did. So this is where my energy went in, not saying\n-- well, I\u2019m delighted that my daughter has it better. I mean, I was delighted that\nmy daughter has it better, but I felt that I -- I -- I shouldn\u2019t touch that part. That was\na no-no for me to think back and say, what did I do when I was 12, because it\nwouldn\u2019t be good. I used to get these crying spells and I would just, for no reason,\nnobody would say much to me, I would cry and I couldn\u2019t stop for nothing. And\nthat bothers me even today. I would cry and cry and I couldn\u2019t explain it and I\ncouldn\u2019t stop. So the ki -- poor kids, they were such good kids, they would say did\n-- did we do something, Mommy, you\u2019re crying, did we -- I said, no, you\u2019re\nwonderful. I was trying to reassure them it\u2019s -- has nothing to do with them. But\nthey were just sad to see me cry. And here if I would start talking, it would be a\nbigger problem. I could have contr -- you see, what happened was, I could control\nmy mouth, the talking, but you can\u2019t control emotion, you can\u2019t control the\nnightmares. You can\u2019t control the -- I couldn\u2019t control the crying. I don\u2019t know\nhow to explain it, because you know, I wanted to stop because I didn\u2019t want my\nFebruary 21, 2001\nkids to see me that way. I couldn\u2019t control it until I cried myself out, for days, you\nknow, and then all of a sudden it like, stopped. It relieved me. I think maybe cause\nI couldn\u2019t talk, so this was my outburst.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right, because you see, we were in so much trouble that we\ndidn\u2019t think we\u2019ll survive either, til the last minute. My sister got typhus and you\nknow how many people died in -- in Bergen-Belsen and -- and we didn't even\nthink -- one of us wanted to survive to tell the world, but it wasn\u2019t in our power\nreally, completely to control it.",

        "A: Separated, yeah. We were separated from society there. It was a little town,\nFielgarden, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s on the map, even.

Sometimes when I walk\ninto something, you know, like the light goes on, it\u2019s the smell of Auschwitz. It\u2019s\nhard to explain what happens inside of me. You know, there 1s -- there are certain\nthings that are in there -- in -- in -- 1-in -- you know, things trigger it off, for\ndifferent reasons, for different -- if I see a chimney today, I have a reaction.

It s -- it sounds crazy to other people, because other\npeople are not affected at all by a swastika. That swastika cannot hurt you. But\nwhat represents to me is something else. Well, you know, a lot -- a lot of things, a\nlot of things. To say that I completely have a pain free life, I don\u2019t. It feels that --\nFebruary 21, 2001\nyou know, I have -- I have s-so many nice things in my life right now that I try to\nfocus in on that.",
        "A: Absolutely. First of all I think I would be more of an educated person. I -- I hate\nto say it about myself, but Hitler took my years of education away from me and I\nmiss that. I remember when I -- I used to feed my daughter with a bottle, I would\ntell her stories. Some mothers tell their children, you know, all kinds of wonderful\nthings and I would tell her sweetheart, when you\u2019ll get -- grow older, you\u2019ll go to\ncollege. And looking back, she didn\u2019t know. She -- she would look at -- I think I\nwas telling myself that -- I was trying to comfort myself because that was robbed\nfrom me. And the simple reason that my children and my grandchildren are such\noverachievers, it might have something to do with it, but I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019m not sure,\nI\u2019m not sure.",

Emotionally,\nbecause -- emotionally I don\u2019t think I was strong as my sister because I cracked\nFebruary 21, 2001\nfaster, I gave in faster. And a lot of people when they did that, they just took their\nlives. I remember in -- the first night in -- in Auschwitz, when I saw a lot of people\nhanging from these -- on these electric wires. I believe today that\u2019s what, they\ncracked and they fel -- they -- they knew that the -- there\u2019s no way they can escape.\nThey just did away with themselves the best way they knew how. And if not for\nmy sister I ba -- wonder if I wouldn\u2019t have been hanging on these wires, believe\nme. There are many times I| think about it.",

        "A: Okay. I\u2019m trying to figure out how to explain it best. I would say that I take my\nJudaism very serious because I paid a big price. And a sad thing happened that I\ncannot be as religious as my grandfather and my father was. But what I did is put\nmy hope in Israel, because I feel if we will not have Israel, we Jews are not safe.\nSo therefore, when something goes on in Israel, it puts me though a lot of pain, the\nfear of losing Israel. I think I made my peace with God. I have a lot of questions\nfor him and maybe one day he\u2019s going to be able to explain, or something --\nsomebody will be able to explain fu -- why. The reason why the children come to\nmy mind is because when I look at my little grandchildren and I say to myself,\nthese -- kids like them went to the gas chamber and they never had a chance. So I\nwant to know why. I would very much like to know why. If there is a reason, I\nwould like to know. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. This is how I live today. I don\u2019t\nthink it made me more religious, it didn\u2019t. But I -- I respect everybody, whatever\nthey believe in and whatever, because the truth is we really don -- you know,\nunless somebody\u2019s a real believer, can he feel, you know, what you really read?\nBut you know, in the other hand, y-y-you know, God gave us a brain that\u2019s -- y-\nyou know, you -- you also think and examine things. E-Everything we read,\nactually, you know, wa-wa-was -- it was written by humans and so many years\nago. So I sometimes think, you know, I -- I -- I\u2019m very happy that we have this\nthings 1n -- in orbit. Maybe through that we will find out really, maybe something\nFebruary 21, 2001\nmore than w-we know now on earth. I\u2019m hoping anyway, I\u2019m really hoping for it,\nbut it\u2019s probably my great-grandchildren will know a little bit more than I know of,\nas far as the religions are going.",
        "A: Yes, I belong to a synagogue. And I don\u2019t know whether it is a habit, or\nwhatever, I light candles on Fridays and whenever I can I go to synagogue. And of\ncourse the holidays, which are the toughest for me because I remember what\nhappened at home. It was such a happy time with my family. And -- and I\u2019m afraid\nto complain, I'll tell you the truth, because I feel like God gave me a lot back, and\nI\u2019m always scared something shouldn\u2019t happen to my family, cause I don\u2019t think\nthat I could survive any more, you know? So -- so I don\u2019t -- so most of the time I\njust say thank you God for what you gave me and I hope they stay well and go on\nwith their lives.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m angry because they didn\u2019t have to. Matter of fact, I feel\nhappy that they didn\u2019t have to, because m -- why so much suffering? And\nunnecessary suffering. What we went through 1s not because I was a bad person. It\nisn\u2019t because I committed a crime. So it doesn\u2019t make sense for me to be angry.\nMatter of fact, I\u2019m the other way. I\u2019m happy that there were some people that did\nFebruary 21, 2001\nnot have to go through this. But I\u2019Il tell you the truth, I live in fear. I\u2019m hoping that\nmy grandchildren, great-grandchildren shouldn\u2019t have to go through what I have\ngone through. And therefore, when I go to the museum, I want to teach society,\nplease don\u2019t hate. Please don\u2019t hate. The outcome of it 1s no good, no good.

I think perhaps -- you see, everything too much is\nno good. I think I was s -- too protective of them. I lived in fear they shouldn\u2019t get\nsick.

Bec-bec-because -- how -- how can anybody\ntake again, kids, put them in wagons to a gas chamber? How could any human\nbeing do that? You know, be -- I always want to talk too, about the kids. You feel\nadults, you know, had maybe a chance to life, but kids never did. How -- how\ncould this man -- I was looking at him and my mind was just going a mile a\nminute, where he comes from, why is -- was he the way he was? Of course, I never\nfigured it out, I don\u2019t know. Have no answer. But to my mind he didn\u2019t look -- you\nknow, when I looked at him, in my heart, I said, 1t\u2019s maybe in my eyes he looked\nlike a human being, but to my soul and my heart, I saw -- I saw a monster, a scary\nmonster. It\u2019s hard to explain because other people wouldn\u2019t understand it, unless\nyou go through this. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. So that\u2019s the way it is. You know,\nthe few years that I\u2019ve have left -- the few years that I have left to live, I -- you\nknow, I go and work in the museum and I talk to children.

And if you let it go, it does no good. That\u2019s really -- that\u2019s how I live\ntoday. You know, I don\u2019t know if I too -- I was talking to little kids and I was\ntelling them about my little brother and I really, you know, I was making it mild. I\njust told them how we got separated and how, you know, he brou -- he -- he -- he |\n-- you know, he had to give up his book, and how sad he was. And there was a lady\nand -- with two children a-and I really didn\u2019t know who she was, because people\nwere coming and going and then after I had my say to the kids, this lady came up\nand she said to me, you know, I\u2019m an SS man\u2019s daughter, and well, he didn\u2019t tell\nme that it was so bad. And imagine, I didn\u2019t even scratch the surface when I was\ntalking to these little kids. She had two beautiful little girls with her and -- and she\nsaid that to me and it\u2019s like she would hit me over the head. And I said to her -- I\ndidn\u2019t have time to debate it with her how good or bad it was, so I pulled her aside\nand I say to her, listen, I\u2019m so glad that you came in here, because I need to ask\nyou some questions. Tell me, did your father tell you what his job was as an SS\nman? We didn\u2019t talk about it. So I says, you know, in Auschwitz, where I was,\nthere came a million and a half children to Auschwitz. And you know what the --\nthe SS people, they had their families there with their children, you know what\ntheir job was? Did you ever wonder what their job was? She says no. Watching\nover the people she says to me. I says, not really. Their job was to take little kids\nFebruary 21, 2001\nlike yours -- I pointed my finger to her children -- to the gas chamber. These kids\nhad no -- nobody had any mercy over them and they knew where these kids are\ngoing. And they were living there very happily with their own families. So I -- I --\nI don\u2019t know how more to explain it to you, how good and bad it was. You know,\nshe started crying. I think I scared her a little bit because I showed my f -- pointed\nmy fingers to her children. So I said to myself, you know, I -- I [indecipherable]\nto -- as angry I was in the beginning for her to saying this to me, I -- I -- you know,\nI was really upset. Well, I said, if she\u2019s starting to cry, maybe I touched a nerve in\nher. So I was going to hug her, and she stepped back. She says to me, you know, I\nwill never forget you. And I said to her, you know what? As long as you will never\nforget me, please remember what I want to tell you. If you see any children when\ntheir lives will be threatened, speak up. Because your father didn\u2019t. And that\u2019s how\nshe walked out. Now, re -- now I feel that I touched her, I touched one person. And\nthat makes me feel good, that maybe if she\u2019s going to see a child in danger,\nwhether it\u2019s a Jew, or a non-Jew, or green or yellow or purple, maybe she\u2019|l be\nthere and say wait a second, we cannot afford of doing that, we shouldn\u2019t do that.\nAnd you know, it makes me feel like maybe I touched someone.

        "A: Why I went to work for them? Because I think through this museum, hopefully\npeople will get the message what not to do to each other. And it\u2019s very important to\nme. You see, I cannot bring back my parents, my family. There\u2019s nothing I can do.\nBut what I -- there is left for me to do 1s perhaps it shouldn\u2019t happen to other\npeople and other children. And if I can do that, I would -- you know, this is my\nmain priority at this point in my life, anyway.\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "A: Now? I am at the donor desk, the membership desk, I work. And then I also --\nI\u2019m on the speaking bureau. And whenever they need me, if they call me, I make it\na priority to go there.",
        "A: Well, in high schools. And sometimes I talk to kids when they come in, they\nsurround the desk there, and I will talk to them when they come in, if the teachers\nrequest it.",
        "A: Not the complete story, because it\u2019s impossible to tell the complete story. I just\nfocus in perhaps on -- I give them a -- I -- I give them a responsibility. I tell them\nthat it\u2019s in their hands to make a better society and what they saw there is reality.\nIt\u2019s not a motion picture, it was rea -- reality. And to go out and make a better\nworld. That\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping they do.",
        "A: I --",
        "A: I think working in the Holocaust is giving me a chance to take my mother\u2019s\nmessage to people, and so that makes me feel good. And I don\u2019t know, I just -- I\nthink I -- I enjoy working there, don\u2019t ask me why, but I -- I enjoy working there. I\ntalk to people, different people, and I like it. Some people have questions and I\nFebruary 21, 2001\ndon\u2019t blame them. If I probably wouldn\u2019t live through what I did, I probably would\nhave lots of questions. So I try to explain it the best way I know how that makes\nsense. And as you know, the Germans were very, very suf -- e-efficient, by keeping\n-- by keeping track on where the Jews were going and what happened and all that.\nSo if they doubting my words, they can always go and pick up with some\ndocuments that were -- that we have today. We don\u2019t have it all because it wasn\u2019t\njust Auschwitz that they were killing people in the Einsatzgruppen. And --",
        "A: Special insights. Gee, I didn\u2019t think about it. The only th -- the -- well, the only\nthing that I feel I can explain this horror more than anybody else, because we all\nread about it and we all heard about it and we all saw -- see the documentaries that\nthey have today of it, but I lived it. And I think the person that lived it can really,\nreally get 1t across somewhat a little better maybe than the educated and the teacher\ncan. And I tell them my purpose on earth today, and I hope they take me serious.\nYou know, as I said before, I would just like to see a better society, and if I can do\nsomething about it I would like to, the best way I know how.",
        "A: I think so. I'll tell you the truth, being that I was lucky enough to bring 1n thr-\nthree kids 1-into this world and given the chance to mold them, I think we can have\nFebruary 21, 2001\na better society, because I know exactly how my kids feel. I remember going to\nwork in Germany and kids would be -- you know, near their picket fences in the\nhouse. You know, kids 10 - 11 years old, something like that, playing. And when\nthey saw us pass by, they started spitting and screaming [speaks German here].\nYou see now, when kids are being brought up with this hate, I don\u2019t really think\nthey\u2019re capable of loving other people, even though at that time they were hating\nthe Jews. But I think when you bring up kids hating, they eventually hate. Their\nlife will be a hate. It\u2019s very destructive, very destructive. Very destructive. So now\nI -- I really feel if my kids would be different people, I -- I -- I would say well, you\nknow, there\u2019s nothing we can do. I understand -- I understand, being that my\ndaughter is -- you know, she\u2019s got a degree in microbiology that she -- she tells me\na lot of people are, you know, born with certain genes, and I understand that. I\nunderstand that, but you still have to nurture that gene. And he -- he might -- he\nmight have the gene of having red hair or black hair or whatever. But the nurturing\nto make a person, I think it -- it -- it\u2019s a big job. To tell you the truth, I think if I\nwould have known all that, maybe I would be afraid that I\u2019m not capable of doing\nit, at that time, anyway. But -- so I -- I definitely feel that if we can just somehow\nerase this hate, we will definitely have a better society, I do believe in that. I do\nbelieve in that.\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "A: I do. But it is hard to explain. As much as I talk about it, I still have difficulties.\nAnd a lot of survivors grew older and weaker and they just cannot deal with their\npast, it\u2019s too painful. It\u2019s very painful. So everybody does the best they know how,\nbut I can also understand it. It\u2019s a painful situation.",
        "A: Yes, I do. I do, and we get together and we try to support each other. Don\u2019t\nforget, we survivors -- I mean, thank God that I -- you know, I have children and\nthey made -- they made their own little families, one or two children, but we have\nnobody else on the outside. So, believe it or not there\u2019s some survivors that are\ndying, and if they -- you know, and if by some reason they could never have a\nchild, or they had a child and unfortunately it\u2019s not here, they really don\u2019t have\nanybody. So we -- we become their family.",
        "A: Yes. How shall I say it? I have such strong, good feelings towards all the people\nthat work in the Holocaust, whether they get paid or not, because I feel n-not only\nare they do -- especially the volunteers, they are trying to right the wrong by\ncoming there and working there. I once asked a gentleman, why -- why are you\nFebruary 21, 2001\nworking here in this museum? I call 1t a cemetery. You could go out and get a job\nanyplace, at a happy place and have a happy day. But I have to understand that\nother people that didn\u2019t go through what I did, they have a different feeling. But he\n-- he told me a story about his life. He says, you know, I have a child -- I have a\nchild that I love dearly and she is not as focused as another child is. And when I\nthink, would I have had this child in Germany? I would have lost her. And she\nmakes my life. She means so much in my life. Because, as you know, the Germans\nwere gassing their own children first, the sick ones. Well, I don\u2019t know whether\nthis motivates him to be there, but I said to myself, 1f he told me this story, there\nmust be a spark underneath there. So everybody that works in this museum 1s\ntrying to right the wrong, I think. That\u2019s the way I look at them, and I -- I love\nthem all. I feel very comfortable with them. I almost feel like they\u2019re my relatives.\nI -- okay, no big deal. Pll just take a towel and wipe it off, no big deal. [tape\nbreak]",
        "A: Absolutely. Absolutely. Matter of fact -- I don\u2019t know if I should say it, the\nJews, I expect them to be there, y-you know, but when I see a non-Jew as a\nvolunteer, I really -- I really feel very good about it, very good about it. Yes, I do,\nand I feel close to them, yeah.\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "A: Well, we all had different experiences, I want you to know. We come from\ndifferent places. The truth is that we\u2019re -- [phone ringing][tape break] -- yeah --\nyeah, I -- I -- I like them all. I like them all.",
        "A: S-Somewhat, but we really do not. What we do is talk about our grandchildren.\nCan -- I just feel bad that I forgot my daughter\u2019s college. Can I just mention it --",
        "A: -- it was -- she went to Syracuse. And Mishy, please forgive me, but sometimes\nmy mind goes blank. And -- and I have another grandson that went to Ithaca. So\nBrian, again, please forgive me, but I always think about you anyway. My mind\nsometimes goes blank.\nFebruary 21, 2001",
        "A: Oh, I have a lot. You know, it will take forever for me to talk about it. Well, th -\n- that experience with this lady, it wasn\u2019t in the Holocaust Museum, it was in the\nChildren\u2019s Museum on -- on -- you know, on Third Street, I spoke there, too. In\nthe Holocaust Museum, I -- at one time -- he was from Germany, you know, and\nhe was very upset, and he s -- comes over to me and he says to me, you have a\nnerve to -- to -- to have this Holocaust Museum here in the United States. Why\ndon\u2019t you have a museum what you did to the Indians? I s -- and I saw he was very\nupset and I knew I can\u2019t make a lot of noises there, because people will come over\nand will make a scene. I begged him to sit down. Actually, you know, I was trying\nto be very nice to him to calm him down. And he did -- he did sit, he sat down and\nhe was shooting off at the nu -- United States, I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s not enough that I\nwas hurting from the Holocaust, but then he started about the United States, I'll\ntell you -- I -- I mean -- but I knew that I have to be patient with him, that I am in\nthe museum and I cannot afford on having a -- a scene there. So after he stopped\ntalking, I said to him, you know, I let you talk now for about five, six minutes,\nright? And now, allow me to say something, and I\u2019m not going to talk for five, six\nminutes. I just want you to know that the United States talks about what happened\nto the Indians. In the United States we teach our children what happened to the uni\n-- to the Indians. Tell me, do you teach your children what happened in the\nHolocaust, what your ancestors did? So don\u2019t tell me -- and come telling me what\nFebruary 21, 2001\nthe United States has the right to do and not the right to do. And as you see, we in\nthe United States constantly are trying to right the wrong. Are you doing the same\nthing? Even today, you know, there is a lot of Arab -- you know, different\ncountries people, there are -- still discriminated. They still cannot tolerate them.\nWe have a melting pot here. People from all over the world, they come here and\nthey find a -- a secure place. At least their life are -- aren\u2019t threatened. Does your\ncountry do the same thing? Well, then he left. Well, I -- you know, you get in\ndifferent characters. I-I\u2019m not blaming all German society about it, but you get\nthese people in. Some of them are very happy, some of them -- some of them --\nwell, I get so many, you know, I could talk for a di -- shall I tell you what\nhappened once? That was in the museum. You know, we work right there as\npeople come down from the museum, and she was a -- she was a mature lady and\nshe came down and I see her cry, so I thought maybe she got sick, so I took a chair\nand gave it to her to sit down and sh-she just you know, goes back and forth. I\nsays, lady, you know, I would very much like to help you. And she looks at me and\nshe still wouldn\u2019t talk to me. And then she stays there and cries. I says, you know, I\nwish I could help you. So I pulled her over to the desk and I says, please sit down.\nThen, after awhile sort of, she loosened up and she says to me, she\u2019s so upset. I\nsays, tell me, why are you so upset? She says, well you know -- she must have\nbeen a religious lady. She says, you know, Jesus was a Jew, and when he\u2019ll find\nFebruary 21, 2001\nout what happened to the Jews, how will I explain it? I says -- at first I didn\u2019t catch\non, but then I says to her, what do you mean? She says, well you know, when I die,\nPll meet Jesus and he might ask me and I will not know how to explain. I says,\nlook, lady --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: So I said to her, you know, I-I\u2019m Jewish, I said to her. But in our religion\neverybody is responsible of their own actions. So please, did you kill any of these\nJews? She says no, I wouldn\u2019t do that. I says, believe me, I know you wouldn\u2019t do\nthat. And -- so don\u2019t just -- maybe you\u2019ll tell him you didn\u2019t do that. And she still\ncouldn\u2019t swallow it, sh-she couldn\u2019t swallow it. But she was sitting there for awhile\nand we were exchanging what she believes in and what I believe in and somehow I\nmade her feel that, you know what? There are some very -- you know, there are a\nlot of guilty people. I mean, I don\u2019t want to say -- you know, I have to say first\nthere\u2019s a lot of guilty people, but also you know, we\u2019re all responsible. And I think\nthat\u2019s the way she felt. That\u2019s exactly the way she felt, that we are all responsible. I\nFebruary 21, 2001\nthink her religion made her feel like that. And I thought that was a nice lady, and I\ndon\u2019t think Pll ever forget her either.",
        "A: In a way we all responsible because you see, if there would be enough people to\nsay, we cannot gas a million and a half children, then the world would hear it, but\nthere was a silence. So they didn\u2019t take the responsibility of -- of saying it. That sh\n-- he or she carries the responsibility, she is saying, wait a minute, I don\u2019t like that.\nIf there would be more people crying and saying that, 1-1 -- you know, a tragedy\nlike this wouldn\u2019t have happened. So she sticks out in my mind. I hugged her and\nwe parted as friends, sort of, and I was glad that I got an opportunity to talk to her,\nand it was a good experience for me too, yeah.",
        "A: Your -- your -- you\u2019re not going to believe this. Wi -- you know, I walk in here,\nI walk in there and if I see people coming, it makes me very happy. And if I see\nthat people stop coming, I s-say to myself, oh my God, I hope these doors never\nclose, because we need to learn, this place is so important. You know what, I think\nperhaps it\u2019s even more important than I -- you know -- even though, you know, I --\nI think universities are very important, especially to me, because I\u2019m not an\nFebruary 21, 2001\neducated person, a-and -- but I think this museum is even more important because\nmaybe we can educate people to be better. And you know, there are -- the reason\nwhy I say this is this, because at this point today we know that the uneducated\npeople were trying to save the Jew, and the educated people, like Mengele and\nthousands of others could commit this at-atrocity. You se -- you understand what\nI\u2019m trying to say? So, you know, I think if a person isn\u2019t educated, but if h-he 1s\nbrought up with the idea that we should be different and we can be different, it\u2019s\nvery important. We think we\u2019re very sophisticated and you know, as human\nbeings, but we\u2019re capable of doing a lot of unthinkable things, and that needs to\nchange.",
        "A: All of it, what shall I tell you? All of it. I went through all this, believe it or not.\nAll this, it\u2019s hard to believe. It\u2019s hard to believe, all this, wherever I go. I look at\nthe little windows and I remember I -- you know, every little thing has got a story\nfor me there. You know, as we were going to Auschwitz we didn\u2019t know where we\nwere going. So I was li -- you know, y -- a -- next to my brother, I was, you know,\nthe yo -- the younger. And they pulled me up to look outside, I wanted to see\nwhat\u2019s going on outside, and we were passing farms where people were working\non the farms. And they\u2019re motioning with their hands across their throat that we\u2019re\nFebruary 21, 2001\ngoing to be, you know -- and when I said it, I didn\u2019t even think about it twice,\nbecause who would think, I\u2019m a healthy person, that somebody 1s going to want to\nkill me. I just didn\u2019t think about it. To tell you the truth, I wasn\u2019t affected by it. So,\nthe window -- then I see these farmers, they\u2019re motioning this to me -- everything,\neverything, everything. I take a look around and I see my life. Everything, yes.",

And so what -- he decided\nthat he has to go, I says, well, I have to go with him. So we went once to\nAuschwitz with a group.

        "A: You see, people that go to see this camp, really, they took apart the camp. They\nleft there a few barracks. The gas chamber was there. For me, I saw the whole\nthing the way it was, but my husband didn\u2019t really see it the way it was. So --\ncourse everybody was sad and crying there because we knew, we all knew the loss\nand what went on there. But it\u2019s different. It\u2019s different than when I was there. It\u2019s\ndifferent. And I was so upset, let me tell you that. They have a -- like a museum, at\nFebruary 21, 2001\nleast when I was there, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on there today. They have a\nmuseum there with pictures, and names. And we had a guide, and I looked at these\npictures, because you know, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re Jewish or not Jewish,\nyou look the same to me. People look the same. But then I noticed there was a lot -\n- that there wasn\u2019t any Jewish names that you would call. And I look around and I\nspend some time there, I couldn\u2019t believe this. So I said to myself, it\u2019s -- maybe it\u2019s\nme, because you know, it\u2019s maybe -- but there weren\u2019t any Jewish names under\nthese pictures. So I go over to the guide, I says, listen, can you explain me\nsomething, because I don\u2019t understand it. You know, I\u2019m the one who was here in\nAuschwitz and I brought here my whole family, 89 people, tell me how come that\nthere isn\u2019t a name that has a -- sort of a Jewish name. She says to me, well you\nknow -- you know, you remember when you came to Auschwitz you had to take\nyour valise and throw it in the ditch? I says yes, I remember, I -- I do remember.\nAnd so we don\u2019t have any documents who came here as a Jew, but we do have the\ndocuments who came here that weren\u2019t Jews. So I said to her, you know what?\nYou told me something new that I didn\u2019t realize. I didn\u2019t know that there were\nsome s -- because this is a destruction camp, and I didn't know that there were\nsome non-Jews came here to be destroyed. I knew there were in different camps,\nsome people that resisted Hitler, but I didn\u2019t think they came all the way to\nAuschwitz. So you just told me something new. So it\u2019s okay, now I will\nFebruary 21, 2001\nunderstand it. But [indecipherable]. So she told me there are no Jewish names\nbecause there is no record of it, that Jews were sent to Auschwitz. I says, you\nmean to say a million and a half children that you know went to the gas chamber\nhere and there wasn\u2019t one name of a child? I was so upset there, you have no idea. I\nwas very, very upset. I don\u2019t know what they did with the rest of it there now. I\ndon\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but I better don\u2019t go there because today I can\u2019t take\nthe pain any more. I-I\u2019m too old. So when you talk about this Holocaust Museum,\nwe scraped here a few documents, there a few documents. I mean, they can say a\nhundred years from today it doesn\u2019t even happen because we don\u2019t have no\ndocuments of any kind. So I think that\u2019s important there.",

Don\u2019t forget, these people lived there for generations and\ngenerations and generations and generations. In the wit -- with -- way they made us\n-- way they made us look, like we were less than rats to these people. So how can\nthey look at me and have any respect for me? And why should I go there? The\nworld is plenty big and it will take generations and generations to come for Europe\nto recuperate to see a Jew as any other normal person, I want to tell you that.

It took me maybe two years with my husband\nback and forth. You see, he -- I was emotional about it and he was realistic about it.\nHe couldn\u2019t reach me and I couldn\u2019t reach him. So finally, what did the sale from\nhim, where he, you know, sort of hit the nail o-o-on the head, is telling me, you\nknow, Helen, I know you don\u2019t want this money, but what you should do is take\nthis money and help other people that are suffering. And I said to myself, now\nmaybe -- maybe I\u2019m just -- maybe reality, that\u2019s what the -- realistically that\u2019s what\nFebruary 21, 2001\nI should do. But for a long time I was very emotional about it, that I couldn\u2019t even\nthink realistically. So -- but that\u2019s what I did, that\u2019s exactly what I do. I never use a\npenny of it, never, because I would feel like I want to, you know.
