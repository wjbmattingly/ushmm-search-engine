        "A: He had a small farm fo -- when I recall him, but I don\u2019t really remember that much about him\nbecause he passed away, oh, guess somewhere around like thir -- 1930, something like that, and\nhis wife died about the same time. My father\u2019s father had already passed away before that --\nbefore I was born, and my father\u2019s mother passed away in the early 20\u2019s, I think I saw her once.",

So -- and that is the only pa -- only house I lived in in Denmark, in Copenhagen.",
        "Q: And did you know your neighbors? Or how -- what were your relations with the people who\nlived on either side of you?",
        "A: Well, my father believed that you tip your hat to your neighbors, you don\u2019t get too friendly\nwith them. You can get friendly with the people down the street, cause you can ignore them if\nyou want to, but your neighbors, you are kind of stuck with. So we didn\u2019t really know the\nneighbors. The people across the street, o-on -- other people on the street we knew well. There\nwas a polar explorer two houses down the street, Peter Franken, who won a 64,000 dollar\nquestion back what, 30 years ago, and had a daughter Pippanuk, she was half Eskimo. And they\nhad an ice winter in the back there and something like \u201828 I remember we were build an igloo.\nThat was a lot of fun.

        "A: Auditing.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",

        "Q: What about church or faith? Was that something that was discussed, or how was that a part of\nyour family life?",
        "A: Well, we used to go to church fairly regularly. Denmark has freedom of faith, with one\nexception, the king has to be Lutheran, or now the queen. But I was confirmed. I was -- see, we\nwent six months we went once a week for a couple of hours, and then after that, you know, pretty\nmuch up to me whether I -- I wanted to go or not.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. A-At what age?",
        "A: 16? Something like 16.",
        "Q: And was it something that was a part of daily life in any way, besides going to church?",
        "A: Well, I was -- did a lot of rowing I was a member of a rowing club, and I did a lot of that,\nalmost every evening in summertime, I would go out there, row. And then weekends we would\ntake off, usually three man to a boat, go up along the coast with a tent and put that up\nsomewhere, cook. Not always successfully, but -- and also in summertime you go off for a week\nor two with a boat and a tent. So you-- you know, somewhere out in a -- some of the smaller\nislands around.",

        "Q: -- everyone have a bicycle?",
        "A: Yep.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Never had a -- never had a car. I didn\u2019t learn to drive until I came to New York.",
        "Q: Oh. Did your mom get around on the bicycle?",
        "A: Yeah, she had one too. My father didn\u2019t, though, he used to walk, or streetcar.",
        "Q: Do you remember the make of the bicycle?",
        "A: There was a -- there was an outfit in Denmark that made them. No, I can\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know off\nhand.",
        "Q: Talk a little bit about the friends that you did have in the neighborhood as a young boy, and as\nyou began to get older, and that you might go out on these rowing excursions with.",
        "A: What happened to them -- well, for one thing, I went to a boy\u2019s school, and some of the\nfellows -- one or-- two of them I\u2019m still in contact with. One wound up in a real estate outfit, and\nsat in the same office in Copenhagen for about 60 -- 50 years or something like that. Then -- he -\n- he\u2019s now retired with Parkinson\u2019s, pretty bad shape. Another one wound up as a -- hada\nbookstore, and one was a professor in some medicine. One was the head tax man in -- on a small\nisland in Denmark. I was told once he was the most hated man on the island. I guess that goes\nwith being a tax collector. And that\u2019s about the only ones I know what happened to them.",
        "Q: You mentioned going out on the rowboat and even spending the week --",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: -- alone -- alone or with some friends. Can you talk about what that was like, you know, wh --\nho -- what kind of equipment did you take? How long did you spend --",
        "A: Hello there.",
        "Q: Stop for a second. [tape break] Can you describe one of these week -- weekend trips where\nyou went with a few friends and you stayed on the island, you went on the rowboat.",
        "A: Well, we would leave from the rowing club in Copenhagen, usually on Friday, usually after s\n-- after work, and -- which would be -- we leave about six, seven o\u2019clock. And of course, in the\nsummertime it\u2019s light until 11. So you go up the coast, and stop someplace up there, and we had\ns -- a certain place picked out we could stay in. Put up your tent and do some cooking and put\nyour sleeping bag out. And next day just fool around on the beach, just swimming and all that\nstuff. That was -- that would be on a Saturday and then on Sunday row back to the rowing club.",
        "Q: And how old were you when you were doing that?",
        "A: Oh, started when I was about 15.",
        "Q: Were you ever a -- a -- an explorer or a boy scout, or --",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: -- in any of those groups?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: What kind of values would you say your father and your mother taught you?",
        "A: Well, for -- the truth is worse than -- the -- honesty and not to be late. They tell you that thing\nabout not to be late when you have an appointment. Be on time and be ready. So those were\nsome of the important ones.",
        "Q: And the honesty, what would they say about that, that you remember\u2019?",
        "A: Well, there wasn\u2019t any doubt about it, you had to be honest, you know. Or, if you get caught\nnot being honest, that was not advisable.",
        "Q: A-And how were you with your parents, were you a rebellious young man, or were things\npretty smooth at home?",
        "A: Oh, pretty smooth. Didn\u2019t have many problems.",
        "Q: Can you tell us a little bit about the city at that time? Di-Did you leave your neighborhood a\nlot?",
        "A: Oh yeah, to go -to the rowing club that was about a half hour\u2019s ride or something like that.\nHalf hour by bicycle. See I started working when I was 15, so that kind of changed the whole\nsituation. Worked full time.",
        "Q: Tell us about that, why did you leave school?",
        "A: I finished school. I started school when I was five years old, in first grade, and then 10 years\nschools, so I was f-finished at 15, and then I got a job, I was supposed to start the first of\nSeptember, but they called from the office and a -- oh, a couple of weeks early and said they\nwere kind of short, could I start earlier. This was on a Thursday. And I was sitting -- my mother\npicked up the phone, I was sitting right there, so she told the gentleman, Mr. [indecipherable]\nthat sh -- sure, I could do that. So he want to know when I could start. I -- could I come in on\nMonday? My mother said, no, Monday, that\u2019s a bad day to start on. So how about tomorrow,\nFriday? Oh, Friday\u2019s a bad day to start. Well, when could he start? He can be there in a half hour.\nSo I went out, got on my bicycle, and went in and started work. That was in a Danish Steamship\nowner\u2019s association as a -- as a messenger, and I was there from August til the end of March, and\nthen I got a job in a steamship company as an apprentice, and I was there three years.",
        "Q: What year is this that you started at the steamship company?",
        "A: \u00b037? Yeah, \u00b037.",
        "Q: And you say you were a messenger, what did that entail?",
        "A: Ah, well, w-we -- I had to supply my own bicycle, of course. I had to drive around, deliver\nmail, and -- and run down to post office with telegrams and all those -- stuff like that.",
        "Q: So you were kind of a courier, you were moving things around?",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Okay. Why did your mom want you to start right then?",
        "A: Oh, I think she knew I was kind of bored. There comes a time, you know, on a vacation when\n-- this vacation, you know, if you want to do something else-- I was anxious to get started\nworking anyway. I wanted to work the ships, so I was lucky I got into that kind of business.",
        "Q: What was your attraction to the ships?",
        "A: Oh, I guess your -- Denmark is a small country, and I think the fact that you always work with\nships, you know, you -- you\u2019ve fooled around with the whole world. You have ships running all\nover and. You meet people from all over the world. Wind up working all over the world, too. So\nI -- I really liked that.",
        "Q: What do you remember about the Jewish community when you were growing up? Were you\naware of Jews living in the city, and what kind of contact did you have with them?",
        "A: We had, in the school, as a -- as a routine there was religious instruction one hour a week.\nAnd we had, I think about two Jews in my class, Leif Manyas, and [indecipherable] I think that\nwas, and they were both excused from the -- from the religious instruction, as a matter of routine.\nAnd that was really the first I ever heard about Jews. My sister had a girlfriend that was Jewish.",
        "Q: So there were Jews in your class, and your sister had her -- a girlfriend who was Jewish. Did\nthey live in the same neighborhoods, or where they lived, would they be living in the same\ncommunity as non-Jews?",
        "A: Oh, same community as non-Jews. Oh, just like everybody else. Oh yeah, there was no\ndifferent there, they would live in -- in the -- I don\u2019t know if there was anybody in the\nneighborhood we were, I am not so sure, but there might have been.",
        "Q: And in your rowing club, for instance?",
        "A: Yeah, you never -- you never kind of thought about whether anybody is Jewish or Catholic or\nMuhammadan or Lutheran, whatever they were. I mean, we all thought there wouldn't be any\ndifference between a Jew and a non-Jew, for instance.",
        "Q: What, for instance do -- in the -- the -- would you find that the Jews might be merchants in --\nin Copenhagen?",
        "A: Well, a lot of the stockbrokers, for instance, lot of stockbroker outfits were run by Jewish\npeople, in name, Jewish names. [indecipherable] was one name -- Goldsmith was one.\nHanseiger, I -- I knew those people. [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Were there synagogues nearby?",
        "A: There was one synagogue.",
        "Q: One synagogue, okay.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And where was that?",
        "A: In the middle of Copenhagen.",
        "Q: And did you ever go there for any reason?",
        "A: Inside? No, not inside. Oh, I passed it often, I -- my father\u2019s office was about a block down\nthe street, so I passed it regularly, but I never been inside.",
        "Q: Okay. Tell us a little bit more about your job as a courier. What would you be doing?",
        "A: Well, it was a matter o-of running around to the various steamship companies with mail and --\nand messages, and stuff like that. Also running to companies that was involved with shipping,\nlike companies that took care of the signing on of sailors, the customs, immigration. Certain o-\nofficial outfits.",
        "Q: And this is in the mid-30\u2019s? 1936 - \u00b037?",
        "A: \u00b036 to -- to the end of March in \u201940. About three years.",
        "Q: When the -- you can think back, and when you began to be aware of events going on in\nEurope, what do you remember first hearing, for instance, about Hitler? How did you hear about\nhim, originally?",
        "A: Well, probably, you know, the -- in the newscast on the -- on the newspapers. I was on the\nvacation in -- in May \u201939 in Germany on the youth hostel tour, friend of mine and I were down,\nand we took the train to Hamburg, stayed in a youth hostel, that was on a ship as a matter of fact.\nAnd then with a -- with boat, with train, walking, we went down to Koblenz and the Rhine went\ndown to Heidelberg, and then we came back through Berlin, we came back to Copenhagen,\nabout two weeks. The other vacations, when I worked for the steamship company they used to\nput -- put us on the ship as a deck boy and I\u2019d work on the ship for two or three weeks, to give\nyou some idea about the practical part of the shipping. And also that gave you a chance to go\nsome of the ports around, see them loading. I was in Riga one time, we were loading railroad\nties. In Finland one time we were loading props -- what they used in the -- in the mines in\nEngland.",
        "Q: Did you begin to notice more people coming through Copenhagen u-using the ships to\nperhaps leave Europe, or to leave the country of their origin?",
        "A: No, there really wasn\u2019t much feeling about that.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t notice an increase in the volume of traffic in any way, of people perhaps going to\nDenmark, and then leaving Denmark to go somewhere else?",
        "A: No. No. Then I got called in on the first of April for -- for conscription, and of course that --\non the ninth of April the Germans came in. That was a short affair.",
        "Q: Well, before we -- we -- we go to that, I just want to chart a lit -- a little more what was\nhappening that you -- I\u2019m wondering if you could think back and remember what your thoughts\nwere about what was going on in Europe. In 1939, things began to shift, Hitler was a figure, but\nhe was also invading, and I wonder what you thought about that.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, of course, I was down there in May of \u201939, in -- in the Germany, but then when\nthe war started in September, and being in the shipping business, that made a whale ofa\ndifference in -- in the way we had to operate. For one thing, there was a danger of -- of mines\nand -- and you know, torpedoes and all that stuff. And there was a danger in the ships going into\nGermany, they were down there to load coal for Denmark, and there was a danger of losing\nships, losing personnel. So, you know, the whole thing changed. Actually overnight there on --\non the -- the Sep-September, the first, I think, the ger -- German entered Poland on the 13\" and\nthe French declared war against Germany. That\u2019s when really the things started popping.",
        "Q: Y-You mentioned that it changed how shipping operated. What kinds of new orders came into\nthe ships, or did they stop going certain places because of danger?",
        "A: Well, there was -- of course the minute you go to a German port, they were more controlled\nby the German military. In Denmark there was -- oh, a lot of things you had to -- to secure the\nships against magnetic mines and things like that. You had to put extra lifesaving equipment on\nthem, all those kinds of things. You had special instructions from -- from the military which --\nwhere -- where to sail, where to avoid. So that meant running around and picking up instructions\nfrom the military whenever a ship was going to leave.",
        "Q: Did you go on any of these ships after Germany invaded Poland --",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: -- and these dangers began?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Okay. And what were your thoughts about what was going on? What -- how -- how did you\nunderstand what Hitler was doing?",
        "A: You know when y -- when you are -- when you are 18 or 19, you really don\u2019t think that much\nabout things like that. There was a lot of other things going on. You\u2019re kind of busy, so uh\nobviously it was kind of scary when you -- the Germans were never very popular in Denmark for\none thing. This goes back to a -- a war in 1864 when Germany and Denmark were fighting and\nDenmark lost that war. And part of Denmark was given over to -- to Germany. That was then\nreturned to Denmark in 1920. But there was still a lot of national [indecipherable] dislike in\nDenmark of the Germans, they were not very popular, never have been. So it -- it was --\nobviously it was scary when you see what was going on in Poland and in -- in -- in France.",
        "Q: Did you think that it would happen to your country, were there precautions or preparations?",
        "A: Well, there was -- you know, you couldn\u2019t have any lights outside at nighttime, everything\nhad to be turned off. You had to be careful walking or driving at night. Things started getting\nrationed. There was a lot of things you couldn\u2019t get. And what makes it hard was that when you\nsit in Denmark and you couldn\u2019t get all these thing -- movies, bananas, what have you, you\nwould see across to Sweden, which is only about a couple of miles, all the lights on, and you\nknew that they were having everything that they used to get. So that kind of makes you realize\nthat there\u2019s really something going on that\u2019s not very good.",
        "Q: Do you remember your father talking about this? What -- was there ever any thought of\nleaving Copenhagen --",
        "A: We were-- no.",
        "Q: -- of leaving Europe --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- because of the war?",
        "A: No, not in our case, no. I\u2019m sure that Jewish people, you know, they were concerned, they\nwould try to get away, but in our case there was no particular reason we should -- you consider\nthat. And in -- during the first World War Denmark was neutral and came through without any\nproblems, so everybody was hoping that it\u2019ll be the same this time.",
        "Q: At this point where were you living? When you s -- 15 - 16 - 17, are you still living at home?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, in the suburb.",
        "Q: Are you contributing to the family household?",
        "A: Half of what I made.",
        "Q: And what --",
        "A: Which wasn\u2019t very much, though.",
        "Q: What were you planning -- what were your career plans? What were you hoping to become?",
        "A: Yeah. I -- I was apprenticed in [indecipherable] three year deals, I will be fin -- that will be\nfinished the end of March in \u201840. And then I wanted to go overseas for f-further training. There\nwas at that time a -- a company in Jamaica called Jamaica Banana Producers Association and\nthat was run by a Danish fellow by the name of List, S.D. List, who was also the Danish consul,\nand I wrote him to try and -- to get involved with that outfit through the consulate. That didn\u2019t\nwork out. Then I tried to work something out with an outfit in Sweden and by the time we were\ngetting all ready to, you know, do something, then we got occupied and I couldn\u2019t get out.",
        "Q: You said you -- it was a three year apprenticeship when -- what was it an apprenticeship to,\nexactly? What was it that [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, it was a three year learning period.",
        "Q: Three year learning period.",
        "A: Yeah, you went three years and then after that you finished and then you can go get a job\nsomewhere else.",
        "Q: Did people in your country expect the invasion?",
        "A: No, no, no, that came as a complete surprise.",
        "Q: Can you talk a little bit about that?",
        "A: I remember that morning, I was in the navy and we got called out on the parade ground and\nthere were these bombers all over the place, which was -- I mean, the Danish air force didn\u2019t\nhave very many planes, so it was obvious that there was something going on and pretty soon we\nwere just told that the Germans had come in and they had started occupying Copenhagen, and for\nus just to stay in -- in the naval yard and not do anything. So was -- it was -- the officers, they\nwere kind of hard on them.",
        "Q: What do you mean?",
        "A: Well, they had, you know, some of them devote their whole life to -- to defend for Denmark\nand then to be told that can\u2019t do anything, that\u2019s not easy.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But no, there was -- a number of Danes got killed, unnecessarily, I think, because I think the\ngovernment had pretty good idea what was going to happen. And it was not right for the\ngovernment to expect the soldiers to put up a defense when they knew that there wasn\u2019t a chance\nof being successful.",
        "Q: So what were your feelings about being told not to fight?",
        "A: Kind of frustration, I guess. I hadn\u2019t been in that long, I'd in -- only been in for nine days,\nactually. So I hadn\u2019t really -- hadn\u2019t fired a gun yet. But even so, you know, you are -- you are\npri -- it -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s pretty upsetting, a thing like that. Everybody was pretty uptight about it.",
        "Q: H-How did the other sailors and people in the navy understand what the government did by\ntelling them not to \u2014 to fight? How did they make sense of it?",
        "A: It just didn\u2019t make any sense, because we \u2014 we had been told that this \u2014 there might be a thing\nlike that happening, and if it did, you know, then there \u2014 there was no purpose in \u2014 in \u2014 in start\nfighting it. We \u2014 if y \u2014 if the country had bombers all over the place, and th-that -- the soldiers\nare coming in, there was -- the Germans were putting soldiers ashore at a number of points.\nDenmark\u2019s a small country. I mean, you can drive from the northernmost point to the\nsouthernmost point in four hours. And you can go from the easternmost point to the westernmost\npoint in about the same, which we happen to do last year, so -- you know, it just isn\u2019t that big.\nAnd it\u2019s -- it\u2019s not like Norway with a lot of mountains and all that stuff, 1t\u2019s pretty flat. The\nhighest point is 180 feet, or something like that. So trying to put up mu-much of a defense when\nyou -- a-against the -- the German army is a -- a pretty hopeless task, I mean, bordering on\nsuicide almost. But even so, though I think most everybody thought at least there should be an\neffort. And it was -- it was kind of disappointing just to sit back, not do anything.",
        "Q: Describe that day. Where were you exactly? And what was the first awareness you had that\nyou were being invaded?",
        "A: When I was in the navy yard in -- in Copenhagen at boot camp, and we just got -- go up in the\nmorning very early, I don\u2019t know, at four o\u2019clock, something like -- like this, because the\nbombers were all over the place there.",
        "Q: And were they bombing?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Just flying?",
        "A: They were just flying around. They were trying to scare everybody.",
        "Q: These are German bombers?",
        "A: German bombers, yeah. And the -- a German ship was putting soldiers ashore in -- in th --\nright in Copenhagen for that matter, close to the navy yard. And then I had seen a number of\ncourse.",
        "Q: So you came out of your barracks, and what did you s -- what did you see, what did you --\nwhat were you told?",
        "A: We just told that there was nothing we could do, and the king had decided we\u2019re not going to\nfight, and we were just going to stand by and then see -- await developments. So we -- we were\nstaying in the camp for, I guess, about a week befo -- before we were -- permitted outside. Ours\nhad been assigned a ship that was supposed to go to Greenland on the 17\" of May. Remember\nthat day, that\u2019s a Norwegian national day. We were supposed to Greenland on the 17\" of May\nfor inspection and to make sure that foreign fishing trawlers did not start going into green\nterritorial waters, because Greenland is Danish. So we were supposed to go out there and I was\nlooking forward to that, that would have been quite an experience. But instead of that we went to\nsome small port in Denmark and sat there for -- until I got demobbed at the British say, 1-1n\nDecember of \u201940.",
        "Q: You got what?",
        "A: Dist -- discharged from the military. British used to call it demobbed.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Anyway, when I was sent home there, in the middle of December, that was the end of my\nmilitary career. So it was only about eight month, nine month.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to go back just to clarify something. You had been trying to get placed in some\ncompanies, the company in Jamaica and the other company, and then I guess that didn\u2019t work. Is\nthat when you signed up to be in the navy? Or did you get drafted?",
        "A: They have conscription, I got drafted.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: So you had to put in your time, and I was all set to put in my time there, and I was applying to\ngo to these places after the military service was over with.",
        "Q: Okay. So that first day when the planes were flying around, did the Germans come inside the\nnaval yard?",
        "A: No, no. That day they stayed outside.",
        "Q: And did you have any contact with your family?",
        "A: No. No, that -- that -- oh, I think that was almost a week before we could do anything. E-Even\ntelephone, or write a letter, an-anything like that.",
        "Q: Did it feel like you were sort of in prison there?",
        "A: Basically that\u2019s what it was.",
        "Q: And when you finally were able to leave or make telephone calls, what had changed in\nCopenhagen?",
        "A: Well, of course, there were German soldiers all over the place, so it -- it wa -- it was obvious\nthere wa -- it was not -- it had changed. I mean, it wasn\u2019t as nice as it used to be. When you get\noccupied like that, you know, it puts a kind of damp on everything else. The stores closed early.\nThey were running -- already that time there were certain things that were getting short of. So I -\n- | had a bicycle, I bicycled home. Rest of them went back to th -- to the boot camp.",
        "Q: What did your mother and father say to you?",
        "A: Well, of course, they were -- they were happy-- I -- I mean, th-there hadn\u2019t been any fighting\ngo on that I\u2019ve been involved with, actually. But they weren\u2019t too happy about the Germans\nbeing there.",
        "Q: Di -- can you describe one of your first encounters with a German? I mean, what was that like\nwhen you\u2019d see them on the street, and they knew you were in the navy.",
        "A: Well, I had the uniform on, the navy uniform. They didn\u2019t pay any attention. I mean, there\nwas so many of them and basically so few of us. I think the whole navy was something like, I\ndon\u2019t know, 8,000 -- eight -- 9,000 people, which is not much compared to the German army.",
        "Q: But did you have any interactions with German soldiers?",
        "A: No, none whatsoever.",
        "Q: So they sort of left you alone?",
        "A: Basically yeah, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Were they t-taking over people\u2019s homes at all, and using them as offices, and --",
        "A: No, in the beginning, everybody was supposed to be -- everything was supposed to be very\nfriendly and they took over some schools, took over some hotels, but not any private houses. Not\nin the beginning.",
        "Q: And what were your friends saying at that time about being occupied like that?",
        "A: Well, I -- cause all I -- I did was I -- I went out to my parent\u2019s house and spend the time with\nthem, then went back to the camp, so I didn\u2019t get around to talk much to -- to anybody. That time\nthere, the Germans announced that everything was supposed to be pretty much continued\noperating the way it had been, where the police were supposed to be Danish, and the courts were\nsupposed to be Danish, and all that. The basic government was supposed to be Danish, except of\ncourse the foreign office. So they had indicated that was not going to be much change of\nanything, which I suppose to an extent was right in the beginning but it didn\u2019t last very long.",
        "Q: How did it change? When did you notice that it began to change?",
        "A: The gers -- the Germans started trying to run more and more things, there were more\npropaganda, there were more things in a -- and in the radio. There were commentators that was\nvery much in favor of Germany. Some of the ones that used to be in favor of the British, they\nwere not on the radio any more. Denmark used to be primarily British oriented, one reason being\nthat the -- the biggest trade partner was -- was Britain. The Danish economy was a refining\neconomy in the sense that they brought grain in, and they exported bacon and -- and butter. And\nall that went to -- or almost all had went to England and so relationship between Denmark and\nEngland was very close. Also because royalty-wise there was family-wise between Denmark\nand Sweden and not much from Denmark to Germany.",
        "Q: So what did you do for eight months in the navy during this occupation -- period of\noccupation?",
        "A: I painted the ship. I think we must have painted our ship 14 times. There wasn\u2019t much else to\ndo, we are lying in this little harbor, you know, and just keep the thing shined up, keep it clean.\nOh, actually, I was only there for part of the time, then I got transferred to -- back to Copenhagen\nand I was working for an admiral, I was doing some office work for him, and then I got\ndemobbed in December, that was the end of that.",
        "Q: And that was -- was that earlier than usual, or they just didn\u2019t need you? You got\ndemobilized?",
        "A: Ah, yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But normally you\u2019ll be in between a year an-and a year and a half.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So it was a lot earlier than -- than normal.",
        "Q: And -- and why was that?",
        "A: Just sitting on a ship someplace, you know, there wasn\u2019t -- you didn\u2019t learn anything. And\nthey didn\u2019t need a full crew on a -- on -- on most of the -- the ships, so they just had too many\npeople. So that -- told to go home.",
        "Q: And at this point were y -- you get a salary, don\u2019t you?",
        "A: In the navy?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Well, yeah, but it -- 25 cents a day or whatever it was. It wasn\u2019t very much.",
        "Q: So were you giving some to your family, or --",
        "A: No, I wasn\u2019t living home.",
        "Q: Okay. And then what happened when you were demobilized, sent home, and --",
        "A: And then I and I start to look around for a job, and there was one ad in the paper, there was\nthis one steamship company that was looking for a junior clerk so I applied and I found later that\nI was the youngest that applied, and I was the one with the lowest requirements salary-wise, so I\ngot the job. And that was a company called [indecipherable] and that started in January of \u201941,\nand was there until sometime in September, October 43.",
        "Q: Okay. And how old were you at this point in \u00b041?",
        "A: I was 20 when I started, January of \u201941 I was 20.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re out of the navy now --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- how -- how is your life different from before, when the Germans weren\u2019t there?",
        "A: What I see, the work life is entirely different. As far as like the rowing was concerned, it\nstayed the same but the day Germany occupied or started go against the Russia, they prohibited\nrowing in Denmark. I think because they were afraid we would row to Sweden, which could\neasily have been done. But anyway, that took care of -- of all activities over the weekends. And\nthey a -- it was just, you couldn\u2019t go out in the evening, you know, you had to be home before it\ngot dark. There wasn\u2019t much partying going on. If they had a -- if you went to a party, it was an\nall night party. That\u2019s in the summertime, that was kind of nice. That was something else.",
        "Q: It was all night because you wouldn\u2019t walk home at --",
        "A: Weren\u2019t permitted.",
        "Q: -- late at night.",
        "A: You weren\u2019t permitted to. And you couldn\u2019t be more than I think like three people meeting in\nthe street, be -- anything beyond that was illegal. Stuff like that.",
        "Q: At what point do you begin to hear about friends or countrymen beginning to resist?",
        "A: That was probably in \u201940 -- \u00b042, I think. That\u2019s when the -- the illegal papers started coming\nout. We always tried to listen to the British forecast, news 1n the evening, and the -- the illegal\nnewspapers started somewhere around that time, late \u201940 -- \u201941, I think it must have been. So I\nwant to get involved and I -- a friend of my mother was married to a chap that was in the\nnewspaper business. So I went to see him -- went in to see him one day and told him that I was --\nkind of like to get involved with some of that stuff there, and so he hemmed and hawed a little\nbit, he wasn\u2019t going to admit he was involved, but he said why you come back in a week, and so\non. So I came back a week later on, he said okay, here\u2019s a -- a name of a guy, you could go and\ntalk to him. So I went down to see this fellow and he was pretty deep in one of the illegal\nnewspapers. I don\u2019t remember the name, free Danes, what it was. But there was quite a few of\nthem. The students had one, the Communists had one, the Republicans had one. I mean, there\nwere a whole batch of those being published.",
        "Q: But do y -- why do you think your mother\u2019s friend trusted you enough to send you to the -- to\nthe other person?",
        "A: Oh, they knew me pretty well. I mean, they\u2019d known me for years.",
        "Q: And when you went to see the person who was very involved --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- you thought maybe the paper was called free Danes, just tell us a little bit about what that\nmeeting was like. What did he ask you? What did you say to him?",
        "A: Well, I told him that I was, you know, where I came from and that I would like to -- to get\ninvolved with some of the stuff and I told him what I -- my background, you know, from the\nnavy, and -- and the steamship company, and all that. And that I was ready to do whatever was,\nyou know, with -- with a newspaper, either distribution or -- or to run copies of it, or whatever\nwas. And he just said well, I'll talk to you one of these days, and then I went home and then a\nfew days later I got word, I had to go -- come back in. And he ha -- must have done a little\nchecking other ways. So I came back in and he said okay, let\u2019s get at it. Then I went somewhere,\nI don\u2019t know where -- I don\u2019t remember where it was, but I went to this address and -- and\nstarted running copies of this paper. And --",
        "Q: And when you got to the address, what would you say? Ho-How would th -- you assure them\nthat you were to be trusted?",
        "A: I guess the fact that I came from the other chap. So then we -- we would run newspapers off,\nand then we would take care of the distribution, and then kind of one -- one thing took you, you\nknow, it -- you get more and more involved, get more and more mad at the Germans. So you get\n-- you get really -- you -- you -- you get pretty satisfied that you think that what you\u2019re doing is\nnot going to change the war, obviously. But at least, under the circumstances, it\u2019s kind of more\nor less the most you can do. You can\u2019t do a heck of a lot more than that, under those\ncircumstances. But that was a beginning. And in those years there wasn\u2019t much sabotage or any\nof that stuff going. That came later.",
        "Q: What gave you the desire to resist?",
        "A: Well, my whole career being ruined by this stuff, in a sense, you know, I mean here I was\ntrying to get to Jamaica or -- or whatever, and th-that\u2019s all ruined because they came in there.\nAnd after all, there wasn\u2019t much reason for the Germans coming in, just the fact that they want to\nbe sure that they would get the Swedish iron ore down along the coast of Norway, and they\nwanted protect a -- protect th-the ships. Didn\u2019t seem to be any particular reason for them to\noccupy Denmark and ruin my career, two of them at the same time. So I just didn\u2019t like it.",
        "Q: Ca -- the place where you made the newspapers, what -- where was it? Was it in a -- a hidden\nplace, or --",
        "A: Oh, somebody\u2019s basement somewhere.",
        "Q: Okay. And there was a printing press down there?",
        "A: No, it was a duplication. Every time around you get one sheet, you know, and there was a lot\nof times around, and then you had to put them together o-on -- you had to take them out and --\nand distribute them. We had to be a little bit careful when you do that, too. But there were var-\nvarious ways you could do that, one was to go into an apartment -- a high-rise, and then start\nfrom the top and leave one paper in front of each door and just run down as fast as you could and\nget out of there, in case there was some Germans living somewhere in an apartment. The other\nthing was driving around on a bicycle, if you see a bunch of people standing, say at a -- say at a\nbus stop, you throw a bunch of papers over there and then you peddle around the corner as fast as\nyou can. That worked pretty good, too. And then, of course there was the steady customers, you\nknow. So, oh, many ways of getting rid of them.",
        "Q: When you would go out to distribute, did you ever alter your appearance in any way so that --",
        "A: No. No, cause you don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s going to see you. I mean, if you run down the stairs\npall mall all the doors are closed. And if you just throw the papers, people are not going to get\nthat much of a chance to really look at you so they can report you, and so no, there wasn\u2019t much\nproblem with that one.",
        "Q: What would have happened if you\u2019d been caught with those newspapers, or maybe you were\nat one point?",
        "A: No, I never got caught- with the newspapers. In the beginning the Danish poleesh -- police\nwould have pick you up and probably put you in the jail for a week or two. It was illegal to do\nthat stuff, officially it was illegal. You weren't supposed to do that. But it, you know, it wasn\u2019t\nany major crime as such. And at that time, the -- the Germans were not in working as the police,\nor they were not -- didn\u2019t have any judges around. We\u2019re talking about \u00b041 - \u201942, and things got\nhotter after that.",
        "Q: Can you tell us about that?",
        "A: Well, then in -- in -- was in f-fort -- I mean in \u00b040 -- kind of hard to remember what happened\nwhat year. The -- the Germans threw the police out that is after I got in court. The Germans\nstarted to get more and more involved, as always, the police. And they started controlling a\nbunch of the courthouses, so if you did get caught, you could get really put in the slammer by the\n-- by the police. Also, the -- I think the Germans insisted the police pick up all the Communists\nand put them in the camps somewhere. And it -- it -- it\u2019s kind of hard to remember what\nhappened, what year that is.",
        "Q: Did you ever assume another name?",
        "A: Oh yeah. Yeah, everybody had a number of names. And that wa -- that\u2019s the reason people\nnow, ask me do you, you know, whatever, and what was his name during the war, you know --\noh, you know, something entirely different. I don\u2019t remember the names I used, but I know I had\nan I.D. card for several. But that was kind of standard -- standard -- everybody did that.",
        "Q: How did you get those I.D. cards?",
        "A: Well, there were -- there were people in official offices, that didn\u2019t like the Germans either,\nand they kind of slid it to you under the table, you know. That was not that difficult to get ahold\nof. You had an I.D. card, you get a driver\u2019s license, you get, you know, most -- you get rationing\nstamps too, which, you needed them that time if you wanted legal -- when you became illegal. So\nyou'd get all these things.",
        "Q: Okay, we'll stop.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: Can you tell us any name you remember that you used during that period?",
        "A: I\u2019m pretty sure of -- I used Jorgen for awhile. But, I mean, then after the war, right after the\nwar when I came back th-the liberation, then I had different names and different cards. I -- I can\u2019t\ntell you, changing our names, can\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: And you mentioned that you might not use a name for very long.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, we never knew whether whether -- particularly, you know, after the German got\nreal hot you never knew whether they knew of one of your names and it might -- if -- if you got\npicked up for something not very important, that might remind them of something that would\nhave been important.",
        "Q: Wh-When did you begin to think of yourself as someone who was resisting the Germans?",
        "A: The whole thing comes gradual. I mean, that 1-isn\u2019t one day all of a sudden, boom. And th-th-\nthe thing was, everybody was -- was involved all -- no, I shouldn\u2019t say everybody, an awful lot\nof people were involved, get to be more and more all the time. So it was nothing unusual. I\nmean, later on during the war, when I was in jail, my sister was involved with a newspaper, my\nfather contributed, and my mother would feed these fellows. The old system, you know, where\nyou have the plant in the -- in the left side of the window stay away, and the right side of the\nwindow, come on in and eat. So I -- everybody was kind of involved one way or the other, and I\n-- me -- I can\u2019t say th-that this happened this time or that time. I -- I -- that I\u2019d realized of -- how\ndeep it was. It just get deeper and deeper all the time.",
        "Q: Are you living at home at this point where you begin to do the underground newspapers?",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: Did you tell your parents you were doing this?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I really told them outright, but I\u2019m pretty sure they knew what was going. I mean\nthat -- you didn\u2019t -- you don\u2019t run around and talk much about those things there, to anybody.",
        "Q: Were you a member of any organization then? I mean, at some point did you affiliate with\none of the underground organizations?",
        "A: Well, you don\u2019t really join as a -- as a membership card and all those kinds of things. You just\nkind of get involved, you work with them. I don\u2019t think this newspaper group had any\nmembership roster or anything like that, you know, which would have -- not have been a very\npractical thing in case a German had gotten hold of it.",
        "Q: But you would go there and you\u2019d run off the newspapers, organize them and distribute them.\nWho would tell you where to distribute them?",
        "A: I don\u2019t really remember. I think you kind of worked that out between yourselves, you know,\nthat -- pretty much what area you were going to cover.",
        "Q: And when you were together with the people, let\u2019s say working on the newspapers, what\nwould your conversations be like? Would you be talking about other things you could possibly\ndo, or the war, or --",
        "A: Well, nights you -- you would talk about the news that was in the -- in the paper that day, and\nother things that you might have heard that hadn\u2019t gotten in the paper yet. You couldn\u2019t have\neverything in the paper, it was just a few mimeographed sheets. And as time went by there were -\n- there were just more and more things happening all the time. So you couldn\u2019t put everything in\nthere, so you would exchange news, what was happening.",
        "Q: What other kinds of things did you do to resist?",
        "A: Well, it started out with the papers.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And then in the fall of \u201943, the whole thing came up with the -- with the Germans wanted the\nJews to the camps in Germany.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: [indecipherable] intelligence that what they want. Anyway, they came up, and that must have\nbeen September, October of \u00b043.",
        "Q: This was when the Germans were going to actually round up the Jewish population?",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: Right around the weekend of Rosh Hashanah.",
        "A: Yeah. And there was a -- a fellow in the German embassy, Dukritch or something like that, he\nwas the shipping attach\u00e9, and he knew about it, and he had told some of the Danish politician\nabout it, and they had passed word out to who the Chief Rabbi was told to -- about it. And of\ncourse that went down the ranks, pretty soon we heard about it and then we started getting --\nhaving the Jews getting away to Sweden. You had -- you had to get out and -- and -- and warn\nthem, and then find out where they were going to be staying because a lot of them moved away\nfrom their own house. And then they would pick them up and take them out in the countryside to\nwhere the fishing boats were.",
        "Q: But let\u2019s go through that process, I mean, how do you remember hearing about it and saying\nokay, I\u2019m going to go warn some families? How did it actually work? One -- you know, give us\none day, one day that you helped.",
        "A: Details, they are somewhat blurred. There was one fellow, he was a doctor, he and his wife,\nthey had one child, and as I recall somebody asked me whether -- whether he had taken off, and I\nsaid, I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ll check him. So I went to see him, and -- and he was still there. So I\nsaid to him, well, you know, you better start moving. So he and his wife and the -- and the kid, I\ntook them to a safe house and then I don\u2019t know if it was that night or the next night, I took them\nout to a small town called Taarbek, that\u2019s on the coast just north of Copenhagen, and got them on\na boat to Sweden. That kind of the way it works. You hear about somebody who is somewhere\nand then you go out there and -- and the amazing thing was that -- I mean, I was what, 22 at that\ntime, 23, and you go out and talk to a -- a family, you never see them before 1n your life, and you\nsay, hey I\u2019m here to -- to help you get away, and they go to -- go with you.",
        "Q: No hesitation?",
        "A: No. Well, you know, they were desperate. And I guess that, what was the choice? There was\ngoing to Theresienstadt and that was not that desirable. So when you come there an-and tell\nthem, hey, I'll help you get to Sweden, and they -- they are inclined to go along with you.",
        "Q: So you went to his house, and then how did you get them to a safe house? Did you have to\nwait until the evening to do that?",
        "A: There were certain taxis we could use and there were certain ambulances. There was a -- there\nwas a Dr. Ole Sager at the hospital who was very involved with all this stuff, and we could also,\nthrough him get an ambulance, and take them out to a safe house. And then in the evening there\nwas certain taxis that were, yo-you know, th-the drivers were considered safe. Then take them --\nget ahold of one of them to take them out to Taarbek, it was called, just north of Copenhagen.\nAnd there was an inn right there, right on the water, right in the harbor, so put them in a -- they\nhad a big meeting room -- ballroom I guess it was, and they would go in there and wait, and then\nduring the night the fisherman decided when they were ready to go, and then you walked them\ndown, you get them on the boat, and they took off.",
        "Q: So they --",
        "A: We never loosed one -- lost one.",
        "Q: When they would be in the inn, they were in a big ballroom? How many people were in the\nballroom?",
        "A: Well, that all depends upon how many boats you had lined up for the night, but you couldn\u2019t\nput that many people on board, I don\u2019t know how many -- how many it was, it was 12 - 15 or\nsomething like that, on the fishing boat, it wasn\u2019t very big. But you might have, you know,\nenough for four or five boat. One time we had the place full and all a -- all of a sudden rumor\nstarted that the Gestapo was coming around. So everybody had to get outside and hide\nsomewhere. There were houses around it, you had to hide in the garden and all that stuff, that\nwas bit of a mess.",
        "Q: Did the Gestapo come that time?",
        "A: No, that was false rumors, we go -- we got everybody back 1n the -- in the ho -- inside, and\nthen down on the -- on the fishing boat and they took off then.",
        "Q: S-So when the fisherman were ready, you would go and get the people you were in charge of\nand walk them through the -- the coast, right up to the --",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t very far.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I mean you were in the harbor --",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: -- so you just walk down the pier to where the fishing boat was, and then they go aboard, then\nthey take off. Whenever the- fisherman is ready.",
        "Q: Do you think people in the town besides the innkeeper and the fishermen knew what was\ngoing on?",
        "A: [ll be very surprised if they didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: If they didn\u2019t?",
        "A: Oh yeah. I mean, you know, you have a lot of people running around there 1n the middle of\nthe night when you\u2019re not supposed to be outside. So obviously they know that something is\ncooking. And a lot of the fishermen lived there, so naturally their families would know about it.",
        "Q: So this was a -- an effort of many people in a sense, as a sort of network?",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.",
        "Q: That --",
        "A: I ope --",
        "Q: Uh-huh?",
        "A: No, I was just going to say there were -- had -- so happened that the people I was working\nwith used this port at Taarbek. There were other people who used ports south of Copenhagen.\nThere were some using ports north of -- there was one port north of Copenhagen called Gilleleje\nand one time they had several Jews hidden in the -- in the church, and somehow or the other the\nGestapo found out, and picked them all up, and they all wound up in -- I think they all went to\nTheresienstadt. But that was one of the few times anybody were lost. One time we were just up\naround Elsinore, and we were helping some people over and the Germans came and they started\nshooting, and one guy, he was a policeman, Larsen I think his name was, hit him in the stomach,\nwhich is pretty miserable. So I wasn\u2019t involved with that, they got him down to -- to the hospital\nwhere Hulsaker was and they operated on him and they shipped him to Sweden the next evening\nto a hospital an-and he came through okay.",
        "Q: Did you yourself ever go on one of the boats over?",
        "A: Mm-hm, yeah.",
        "Q: Could you describe what that trip is like?",
        "A: I went over three times. The first time I was told to go because somehow or the other they\nsaid that -- that somebody in -- in -- in the Germans I ha -- knew I was involved with the stuff, so\nthey said, you better get over to Sweden for awhile, lay low. So I went on a boat, and we went\nabout halfway across to Sweden, and then there was the Swedish fishing boat. And the two of\nthem went alongside, and we climbed over in the Swedish fishing boat and then went over to\nSweden. So --",
        "Q: How does that transfer actually work? It seems like it could be dangerous.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: No? To go -- you would physically just jump --",
        "A: From one fishing boat they were -- they were right next to each other.",
        "Q: Go right next to each other, okay.",
        "A: They go slow ahead you know, so --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: No, that wasn\u2019t any problem. That was one time. Another time I went over there, there was a\nbrewery in a small town, Elsinore, that\u2019s Hamlet\u2019s Castle, called Wiibroe, and they had an\narrangement with a boat that would go from Copenhagen to Elsinore, which is something like 20\nmiles, with empty beer bottles and cases. Well, they would leave a room in the middle of the --\nof the hold, so you would hide down there. And the time I -- I forgot the reason, I had to get over\nthere, was something I had to bring over and there was a couple with a baby that was going on\nthe same one. And th-the baby had gotten a shot, you know, of -- to be sure it was quiet, because\nwhen you get down there, then they put beer bo -- case with beer bottles all the way around, and\nthen the -- before the ship could leave Copenhagen the German harbor patrol er-whatever it was,\nwill come down as a matter of order and just check the ship out. So you could hear them walking\naround on the deck. And then we took off, and we got out on the sound and then the same thing\nalongside the Swedish fishing boat, and they take some of the beer cases away, and so you get\nout.",
        "Q: What kind of shot did the baby get to be quiet?",
        "A: I have no idea. There was a -- there was a doctor they had. But that was something there- to\ncalm her down you know, it wouldn\u2019t make any -- 1t wouldn\u2019t make her cry or anything like that.",
        "Q: At that moment when you were sort of hidden in this little area surrounded by beer cases, and\nyou can hear the Nazis walking around, what\u2019s going through your mind? What -- what are\npeople thinking and feeling?",
        "A: That wa -- that was one of the three scariest moments I -- I had during the war. I-It\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nscary. You know, you -- you don\u2019t want to do that too often. But we were lucky the baby stayed\nquiet, and -- and so we got off in good shape.",
        "Q: And you said th -- what was the third scariest moment [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh, the second time was -- well that was actually after I had been caught by the Gestapo had\nbeen in the jail for awhile, they were going to bring us down to Germany, they stopped -- they\nstopped the car somewhere, there were 13 of us in the -- in this truck. And you sit there, you\nhandcuffed with your -- in the back and you have a -- a wire going through so nobody get\nanywhere. So they went from Copenhagen down to [indecipherable] over the ferry to the island\nFunen and then we went a piece on this blacktop and then you could feel that you were going on\na -- on a dirt road. And then they stopped and they told us to get out, they took the -- the\nhandcuffs off and said, time to relieve yourself. So you stand there doing your thing and we\nknew that shortly before that the Germans -- the Gestapo had taken a bunch of fellows from the\ncamp out somewhere in the northern part of Zealand\nand they shot them all. So when you\u2019re do -- standing there doing that thing, one of the German\nsoldiers fired a -- a salvo, this machine pistol there. That was pretty scary. But he just fired in the\nair, you know, for the fun of it, or whatever, so -- and the third time was another time I\u2019d been in\nSweden, I came back to Copenhagen in an afternoon, and that was my own stupidity. I had\nbought a copy of the London Times, and I had that in my briefcase, and I was sitting the\nstreetcar, and through one end of the streetcar come these German soldiers and start -- want to\ncheck everybody\u2019s briefcase. Fortunately, before they got to me they stopped and they got off\nand went somewhere else. But that was -- I -- I was very scared, I -- I'll admit that.",
        "Q: Were you scared a lot when you were doing this kind of resistance work?",
        "A: I -- I think so, yeah. Y-You don\u2019t really get that used to it.",
        "Q: Can we go back to that two week period where so many of the Jews were saved in your\ncountry.",
        "A: \u00b043 --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Fall of \u201943.",
        "Q: Fall of \u00b043.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: It\u2019s been described as a -- as some sort of a two week period and there\u2019s a stream of people\ngoing over to Sweden. I-In that two week period, what -- what was going on for you? Were you\njust sort of up every day, hardly sleeping, or -- what was going on for you? Ho -- were you\ngetting assignments of other people to help, or --",
        "A: You don\u2019t get much sleep, that\u2019s one thing. And they had some kind of pill, I don\u2019t remember\nthe name of it, that I -- could keep you going for a long time. But usually, after two nights\nwithout hardly any sleep, then you had to have one night. The company I work for, I -- I worked\now -- a lot of times I -- I didn\u2019t show up, but they -- I think the boss knew very well what was\ngoing on -- he didn\u2019t ask me, I didn\u2019t tell him, but I think he knew what was happening. So then\nafter, you know, two -- two or three weeks, then it started easing off, and -- and you wouldn\u2019t be\non every night any more.",
        "Q: But when you say you\u2019re on, how do you know you\u2019re supposed to be on? Does someone\ncome and tell you we need you tonight?",
        "A: Well, you know, you -- you -- you -- you talk to these people all the time. Whether they\nspecifically said -- I -- I -- I don\u2019t remember. I just don\u2019t remember now. I -- I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s a\nlong time ago, you know, and I tried lot of things in between, so some of them -- those things in\nthat time, you know, they kind of -- ve forgotten about them.",
        "Q: Was there a point that you became known and relied upon for the work that you\u2019re able to do\nin the resistance?",
        "A: Oh, I suppose some of the fellows or the girls I worked with, you know, they kind of respect\neach other. There were a couple of fellows that were really out -- there was one girl that was\noutstanding, that I knew quite well.",
        "Q: And who was that?",
        "A: The girl\u2019s name was Jette Hec Johansson, she was quite well known, she was a great girl. And\nthe fellows, oh God, what was their names? Hec Johan -- Hed I remember her name because I\nmet her, oh what, 10 years ago at a reception in Copenhagen the queen had. And Jette was\ninvited and I was there, and so I happened to see her, and I hadn\u2019t seen her for so long, I went\nover to say, You\u2019re Jette, aren\u2019t you? That was it. So we had a -- a great reunion. Yeah, she was a\nwonderful person. So that was -- that was a bunch of -- of nice g -- nice people, you know,\nreliable.",
        "Q: It was -- did you ever receive any training for what you were doing?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No, there wasn\u2019t any of that stuff. I guess there wasn\u2019t really time for that. Besides that\nanything organized, you want to stay clear of.",
        "Q: So that was something conscious, you really stayed away from the organized --",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Oh, absolutely, you don\u2019t want to get involved with that.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Well, Germans have -- the Gestapo had a way of convincing people to talk, and if they got\nahold of one fellow in an organized thing like that, you know, they could kind of find out the\nnames of a bunch of other people. That\u2019s the reason from one group to the other, you didn\u2019t\nknow many people you know, who -- certainly didn\u2019t know the names. And there were usually\none, maybe yo -- one fellow in your group would know one fellow in the other group. And that\u2019s\nthe way you do the communications. Then th -- later on, you know, what -- when -- after I got\ncaught and sent and things got more organized, and I don\u2019t know what -- how it was done in that\ntime. But that was -- that was after the summer of \u00b044.",
        "Q: Okay. When you were to leave your home and you might be going -- I\u2019ll go back to the\nperiod where -- the two week period where all the rescues were taking place, when you would\nleave your home, would you be aware that someone might be following you?",
        "A: No. No, I never thought about that.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t feel like people knew what you were doing?",
        "A: Very, very, very few did. I mean, there wasn\u2019t anybody around where I lived that knew, as far\nas I know. I never asked anybody af-after the war.",
        "Q: And did you ever have any encounters with the Danish police?",
        "A: Well, yeah, I helped one policeman wanted to get to Sweden one time, Danish policeman, he\nhad gotten in trouble, so I -- I help him over. But that was about the only time I was involved,\nwas really involved in anything.",
        "Q: How did you regard them, though? I\u2019ve heard that it was a sort of an open secret that they --\nthey knew that some of this resistance was going on --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- and they didn\u2019t try very hard to stop it.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s absolutely right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: As a matter of fact, on occasion they helped.",
        "Q: Okay. Anything that you were involved with?",
        "A: No, just what I\u2019ve heard.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But poli -- police no -- was not very friendly toward the -- toward the Germans. And after the\nwar I met a fellow who was in the police at that time, and he was telling me things that was\ngoing on that showed the police was -- a lot of times was in -- in a sense against the Germans.",
        "Q: When you would take a family to the coast and get them to Sweden, did you -- was there\nanyone you had to report back to --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- that they were rescued?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: No. I think what they -- what they probably did when they got to Sweden, they were th -- I\nthink there was some kind of a -- an organization over there that took care -- I mean, you know,\nyou get over there with a couple of kids, you don\u2019t know anybody, you have no money, so\nsomebody got to look after you. And there was some organizations over there, both Swedish\nJews, and -- and Danish Jews who had escaped and -- and look after them.",
        "Q: Can you talk a little bit about the money. These -- these rescues did take money, you had to\ntake taxis, or trains, or pay the fishermen. Where were you getting the money to make this\nhappen?",
        "A: I never paid a fisherman, for one thing. There are stories that some fishermen got paid\nbecause they risked their boat, but I never heard of anybody, seen anybody do it. The ambulance,\nof course, we didn\u2019t pay them. Taxis, most of the time we didn\u2019t pay them either, cause they\nwere kind of part of the whole thing. Where you get money from -- you never use any. I didn\u2019t\nuse any. In those -- in those days I lived at home, and I got the salary for most of the time, even if\nI didn\u2019t show up. He was very nice about it. So -- no, I -- I -- I don\u2019t really know who -- who did\nthat.",
        "Q: So in the instances that you were involved in, no money was paid to the fishermen?",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: Did they ever say why they were doing this?",
        "A: Well, of course, a lot of those fellows didn\u2019t like the Germans either, so they were all -- that\nwas one of the reasons for it. And then the other thing 1s basically that this really wasn\u2019t so much\no-of Jews or not Jews, or whatever. They were -- it was maybe because they were, you know,\nDanish citizens, they were just like the rest of us, you know, and all of a sudden the Germans --\nif they had been going after the red haired, it would have been the same thing, probably. It just\nhappened that the Germans went after Jews, so then you help the Jews get off -- they wer --\nescape.",
        "Q: I read that one prominent activist, [indecipherable] Jacobsen said that -- that it really wasn\u2019t\nabout Jews, it was -- it was more about democracy, that the Danes were tired of the Germans\nbeing there --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- resented it.",
        "A: Yep. Oh yeah, no, it wasn\u2019t because they were Jews. And then of course, as time went on,\nthere were other than Jews that -- that had to get to Sweden. After -- after that fall of \u00b043 --",
        "Q: There were other Jews that had to get to Sweden?",
        "A: No, no, there were others, than Jews. I mean, there were -- there were like allied bombers\nwho\u2019d be shot down over Denmark, and then their crew had to be helped to get over to -- to\nSweden. A classmate of mine, Billy Talbotsa was flying for the Royal Air Force, and he got shot\ndown over Denmark, and he managed to get his way to Elsinore and they put him on a kayak.\nUnfortunately, he -- he didn\u2019t make it across, he drowned. But many others got over there. Also\nthere were parachute agents that had to get back. Niels Bohr you know, there was one guy that\ncame over illegally to Sweden on a fishing boat and then wound up at the Manhattan Project.\nHow in the hell where is- Las Cruces New Mexico. Poli -- certain Danish politicians, wound up\nin England for BBC. So, there were many others than just Jews that were shipped.",
        "Q: Were there people that you knew, that you admired 1-in your country, who -- for their\nresistance also? That inspired you, I guess.",
        "A: No, not really, because I didn\u2019t know who was, you know, the big mucky-mucks. They had\nthe Danish Freedom Council, but that was very secret, and I don\u2019t think anybo -- anybody knew\nwho was on -- at that thing. [indecipherable] Jacobsen was one, they come out after the war.\nThere was -- there were a -- there was -- I think there were a couple of doctors on that, one or\ntwo politicians. But no, there was -- there wasn\u2019t really much mentioning of names. It was just\ntoo dangerous. Wouldn\u2019t do any good.",
        "Q: Did you have a sense that there were a lot of people involved, resisting?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: You just didn't know who they were.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, there was -- I don\u2019t think there was any doubt that there were a lot of people, lot of\npeople involved many different ways.",
        "Q: Talk some about people who weren\u2019t involved and maybe even who were informing or\ncollaborating.",
        "A: We had that too.",
        "Q: Yeah. Tell us about that.",
        "A: That was one of the things that the resistance movement did was eliminate some of those\npeople. There were a number of them got -- got -- got shot. One guy who reported me into\nGestapo, that\u2019s the reason I got caught, and he got eliminated. So that happened to a number --",
        "Q: Do you remember who that was?",
        "A: No. No I never knew his name.",
        "Q: How did he know that you were --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know who he was, I never talked to him, but I heard\nafterwards that he was the one that had reported to Gestapo that we were -- we -- we were\nmeeting in this particular place with the -- with the parachute agent.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] Did you know anybody who was involved in that, that -- in the elimination\nof -- of informants?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you carry a weapon?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: What did you carry?",
        "A: Parabellum it was called. I don\u2019t remember whether it was made -- I think it was Belgium\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: And where did you carry it?",
        "A: Inside the jacket.",
        "Q: Where did you --",
        "A: But not all the time, you know, only when you -- when you had -- on a job.",
        "Q: Was it hard to get bullets for it?",
        "A: We didn't use very many, so no, I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t recall that. You didn\u2019t use it very much very\nseldom you had to -- I think that was only once or twice I had occasion to use it. You want to\navoid that as much as possible.",
        "Q: What were the circumstances that you did use it?",
        "A: Oh, there was one time some guy had got the idea that there was a -- a depot out somewhere\nthat was just absolutely full of -- full of weapons, and there wasn\u2019t many Germans taking care --\nlooking after -- guarding it. And there was like a small hill and up on top there was a fellow\nsitting with a machine gun. And then there were a couple of guys walking around inside of the\nfence. So the way it was set up, we had a friend of mine worked for -- for a brewery, so I had\narranged for us to borrow a couple of trucks. So we drove out there this morning, and the wa --\none guy had a rifle, and he was supposed to shoot the guy on top. And I had to get the rifle out to\nhim, which is kind of hard when you -- on a bicycle kind of hard to hide= So I borrowed a -- a\nrake and a spade, whatever it was, and then tied it on the bike and put the gun the middle of the\nburlap around it and took out the -- anyway, he was supposed to shoot the guy on top, and he\nmissed. The meantime we drive up alongside, we show -- throw the tarp over the barbed wire\nand jump inside. And -- but since he didn\u2019t get the guy up on top -- he was sitting up there with a\nmachine gun and he was doing a lot of shooting, so we got back over the f -- over the fence and\nran away. It was just -- you -- you couldn\u2019t. When you -- you have a revolver, you don\u2019t start\nfighting with machine guns, your odds are against you.",
        "Q: Oh, so you -- you shot it, but you also then decided you were outnumbered?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. So what were you going to do? Take all the guns?",
        "A: Yeah, we could always use some more.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That was in -- must have been \u201944, early \u201944, I think. When did I get caught? I got caught in ja\n-- June \u00b044, I think it was. Must have been early \u00b044.",
        "Q: So wa -- did you have any successful raids on German depots --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- where you did get guns?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Was a -- a lot of parachuting down of the allies. And then they also, they -- they started\nbuilding some over there, making some, you know, manufacturing some. They were primarily,\nthey were -- they were parachuted down.",
        "Q: When was the other time that you used your gun, or one of the other times? You said there\nwere a few occasions.",
        "A: There was -- there was this -- this girl out there, she had been reporting in, and so we were out\nthere, we were trying to eliminate her, but there were too many -- too many Gestapo people\nshowed up, so we had to forget about that one. There was a little shooting going on, but not very\nmuch.",
        "Q: Shoot and go?",
        "A: Shooting.",
        "Q: Oh, little shooting, uh-huh. So you were going to -- to kill her.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: Did she ever get killed?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, she got taken care of. I don\u2019t remember her name either. I probably didn\u2019t know her\nright name anyway, So --",
        "Q: So she was part of your group, but she had --",
        "A: No, no, she was -- she was telling the Germans about not our group, but some other people --",
        "Q: Other people.",
        "A: -- she had been reporting on [indecipherable] and then some might have been arrested and it\nwas her fault.",
        "Q: But something like that, the elimination of someone, is that something you took upon\nyourself, or was that -- did that come as an order from someone?",
        "A: That came from upstairs.",
        "Q: And what\u2019s that --",
        "A: I mean, well --",
        "Q: How would you hear? What is upstairs?",
        "A: The Freedom Council.",
        "Q: Oh, that came from the Freedom Council?",
        "A: Or close to that. Or close to that.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Close to that. There was also the -- the freedom no the -- the parachute people. They had a\nnumber one man there Flemming Muse. And he -- I think he had authority to do that. Then the --\nthe communists had a rather large group called BOPA --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- and known as the Borgelige Partisaner.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And they had [indecipherable] part of that [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Okay, mm-hm.",
        "A: And they -- they had, you know, could decide things like that, that\u2019s how prized they are.",
        "Q: And would you or someone you knew, how would you get the message that you were\nsupposed to go assassinate, for example, this -- this girl?",
        "A: Well, I -- I don\u2019t know how it came down, I only know that these people I was with at that\ntime, his name was [indecipherable] I think it was, and he had gotten word. How he got it, who\nhe got it from, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Okay. At this point are you beginning also to do some sabotage?",
        "A: No, In -- I never did any blowing up and such. I was a guard at some of -- yo-you always had\npeople standing around, watching and I was involved with that, but I didn\u2019t handle the\nexplosives, or -- didn\u2019t like the smell of it, for one thing. They smell like marzipan.",
        "Q: It smelled like?",
        "A: Marzipan.",
        "Q: Marzipan?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. What else are you doing to resist at this point?",
        "A: Well, we were -- actually, when I got caught we had just gotten a new shipment of -- of\nbombs parachuted down, they were not very big, but th -- the purpose was to put them under the\nGerman trucks because they were short of rubber, and they had a hard time getting tires. So if\nyou could blow their tires to pieces, you know, they couldn\u2019t drive their trucks around. So all you\nhad to do is put these things underneath the -- the tire, then when the -- th-the car-drove off, it\nwould blow the tire up. You will be 40 miles from there in the meantime. So we\u2019d just gotten\nthese -- a shipment down of that, and I was with, I think there were four, maybe five. One was a\nparachute agent, and he was showing us how to operate, how to use them and all that. But then\nthe -- the door busted open and in came the Gestapo with a machine gun, and all that stuff, and\nyou\u2019re told to hit the -- the floor. He ate the special agent\u2019s pill, and he died right there\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: In what amount of time?",
        "A: A minute? It was almost instantaneous. A minute, two minute. So we never got to use those,\nbut they were used pri -- a little afterwards, those tire bombers. They\u2019re only about this big.",
        "Q: The -- the parachute man who committed suicide, wa-was he Danish?",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: Did you have a pill?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Why -- why did he do that?",
        "A: Oh, I think he probably had heard what the Germans were inclined to do to parachute people.\nThey were pretty hard on them. So he is buried in Copenhagen.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Robert Johansson I think it was. Robert Johansson. Nice guy. Yeah.",
        "Q: How much had you worked with him?",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t remember. It wasn\u2019t that long, he hadn\u2019t been there that long, I don\u2019t think. I\nhadn\u2019t known him that long, at least.",
        "Q: Did you know he was going to do that if you were caught?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Well, you know, you know that they had this pill.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But I suppose it was up to each individual whether he want to -- to take it or not.",
        "Q: What were the Germans like with you, then?",
        "A: Well, we were the -- I forgot whether three or four -- anyway, we were taken to the place\nwhere they did their interrogation, place called the Shell house, used to belong to the old oil -- to\nthe oil company. And then they started the --",
        "Q: Oh, the Shell O1l Company?",
        "A: Shell Oil Company, yeah. Germans had taken -- Gestapo had taken that house over, and used\nfor their headquarters, and they did a lot of their interrogation in that one. So, we spent some\ntime in there, and I can do without that that wasn\u2019t very nice. There was a fellow from the\nsouthern part of Denmark, spoke both Danish and German, and he would kind of switch you\nback and forth. So after that was over, I was -- I was sent out to the -- the jail in Copenhagen.\nAnd had my own cell there, and then they would -- a couple of days I was pulled out and sent\nback in to the Shell House for a little more --",
        "Q: What did they do during the interrogation?",
        "A: Oh, they kind of hit you with a -- I don\u2019t -- rubber thing, about that -- like a nightstick, but all\nrubber, hit you over your kidneys, which 1s all uncomfortable. And then, you know, hit you other\nplaces, and kick you a little. Right to the jaw, left to the jaw, whatever they feel like. They\u2019 re\nthey\u2019re - just not very nice.",
        "Q: And how long did that go on?",
        "A: Well, 1 -- you really don\u2019t keep check on the time. I mean, you just hope it\u2019s gonna be over\nwith. But I forgot th -- what -- in there four or five times, something like that. And otherwise you\nsit out yourself, by yourself. So -- and that went on for -- I guess I was in that jail for a month.\nAnd then they came there one morning, I don\u2019t know, three o\u2019clock, told me to get dressed \u2014get\nmy gear. We went out, got in a bus -- a-a -- this truck, then they took us down. And they took us\ndown to just over the border, place called Flensburg and there were 13 of us, and that -- put us in\nthe jail there for -- oh, I don\u2019t know, two or three days. And then they took us by bus to Hamburg\nto the jail and we were just there one day. And then they took us down to the concentration\ncamp. And then it was strange because normally when you come down there, you get, you know,\nyour prison number at that time was somewhere in the 50 - 60 thousands. Ours was 500, and that\nwas because the 13 numbers were what they called politsi haftling. That means you are under\narrest, but your sentence has not been determined yet. So, we were politsi haftling until\nsomewhere around Christmas, and then we became Just a -- a normal, regular prisoner. But in the\nmeantime, that helped me because one time my name was on a list, I was told, I forgot, but\nanyway, I found out that I was supposed to be transferred to one of the work camps, which they\nwere building these trenches so the allied tanks couldn\u2019t get in. So you walk around in this water\nup to your knees or whatever. You never get dry clothes on, and it\u2019s cold, it was in the\nwintertime. So the fellows there usually didn\u2019t last very long. So I heard I\u2019d been transferred\nthere once, I didn\u2019t like that, so I got permission to go up to the camp office, and I said to the\nclerk up there that I was politsi haftling, which means I had to be -- available again -- in -- in\ncase Gestapo wanted me back and maybe he better not ship me off cause he could wind up and\nget in trouble. So he agreed, so he took me off the list, then some other poor bugger got on the\nlist there. Then I really got transferred. But the reason for that was that one of the 13 had found\nout afterwards- said we had been sentenced to be hanged, and somehow or other the -- the\ninstruction got lost, and that\u2019s the reason why we got into the camp, we got this strange number.\nThe sentence had actually had been pronounced.",
        "Q: What was the name of the camp?",
        "A: Neuengamme.",
        "Q: Did you know that camp existed before you were sent to it?",
        "A: No, no. We didn\u2019t know -- really know anything about concentration camps then. There had\nbeen some talk that there were camps like that somewhere around, and that was for anti-socials.\nThey had various marks, they had purple, they had red, they had green triangles on your -- on\nyour uniform. They had one camp [indecipherable] Denmark for political prisoners, that wasn\u2019t\ntoo bad, actually, I understand. But the ones down in Germany that -- that didn\u2019t get much\npublicity that time. After the war, I think that\u2019s when a lot was written about it.",
        "Q: And your camp was in your country, or were you --",
        "A: Germany.",
        "Q: It was in Germany.",
        "A: Just outside of Hamburg.",
        "Q: And -- but before we really move on to the -- to the camps, just wondering if you could talk a\nlittle bit about why you think the people in your country really sort of came up and in this\nspontaneous, organized fashion helped rescue so many people? What do you think gave them the\ndesire, the will to do that?",
        "A: You mean to help people get to Sweden?",
        "Q: Yes, particularly that. That two week period but just the ongoing --",
        "A: Well, you know, Denmark had been independent since, I don\u2019t know, a thousand years. Never\nbeen occupied. And then, naturally when somebody comes in like that, it\u2019s going to cause\nresentment and everything else. So it gets to the point anything you can do that can be anti-\nGerman, whether it was help people get to Sweden, whether it was blow a railroad car in the air,\nwhether it was put a bomb on a ship so it would sink, whether it was publish papers, whatever it\nwas. Anything that was kind of anti-German, people will be in favor of. 99 percent, I think, of\nthe people.",
        "Q: And the people who didn\u2019t, I mean, how did you feel about them?",
        "A: Well, because there always gonna be some who just sit back and watch life go by, and then\nthere\u2019s a certain percentage that will be in favor of the -- of the Germans. A part of that could be\npeople who lived in a part of Denmark that had been German f-from 1864 to 1920. And y-yeah,\nthat was [indecipherable] you could understand kind of, in a way, that -- that there were -- there\nwere certain reasons. But a lot of the other one no, there was no excuse for them, and they really\ngot taken care of after the war, I mean, they were -- lot of them went up in jail for simply being\ntoo nice to the Germans.",
        "Q: You haven\u2019t really mentioned the king much. Is he someone who inspired you?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: And can you talk about that?",
        "A: He was a pretty good guy. He used to ride around every day, and his son was A-one too. They\nwere -- you have to have something to hang on to. And politicians are not the real ones. Look at\npoliticians in France, Laval, P\u00e9tain, I mean they -- Laval got hanged, I think, P\u00e9tain wasn\u2019t -- or\nalmost 100- so he got away. But I mean, there was nothing there we had to look up to Belgium,\nthe -- the king gave up there, Leopold, he wasn\u2019t considered much of anything. But in Holland\nand Norway, king and queen took off for England and formed exile -- exile governments. They\ndidn\u2019t have any in Denmark, exile government in -- in the -- in the -- the allied countries, which\nwas a bit of a handicap in the beginning. But the -- the king proved to be pretty good anti-\nGerman, although his wife was German. But I think he was -- he was very good.",
        "Q: How could you tell he was anti-German?",
        "A: It was known from already before the war that he wasn\u2019t much in favor of them. I mean, he\ngot a -- he turned 70 -- yeah, he turned 70 in -- in 1940, and he got a very elaborate\ncongratulation telegram from Hitler, and he answered, thanks. Hitler got all teed off. That\u2019s not\nhow you thank the -- the fuehrer, just by one word. So it -- it was pretty well known that he\nwasn\u2019t much in favor of -- of the Germans.",
        "Q: Did you yourself ever see him riding his horse?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Can you describe that?",
        "A: Was just -- he wore an officer uniform, and he just rode. Was a red light, he stopped, wait\nuntil it turned green. He was very good. And his son the crown prince was trained in the navy,\nwhich of course made him much better as far as I was concerned. But he was pretty good guy,\ntoo.\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "Q: In this period in 1943 - 1944, what would you say is the most difficult thing you had to do?",
        "A: The one specific thing was after I went to Sweden in the fall of \u201944 -- no, fall of \u201943, I didn\u2019t\nsee my parents until after the war was over, except once. I was in a streetcar and I saw my\nmother standing, waiting for another one. And it was difficult not to get off and say hi. At that\ntime I hadn\u2019t seen her for about a year, and it would be another year before I saw her again.",
        "Q: Why wouldn\u2019t you get off and say hi?",
        "A: Cause she didn\u2019t know where I was, supposedly. She didn\u2019t know I was back in Denmark, she\nthought I was in Sweden.",
        "Q: Tell us about that, you -- you went to Sweden, why and what did you do there, and then how\ndid you come back?",
        "A: I went to Sweden in -- after the -- after we had helped the Jews get over at the tail end of, of\nthat one which was in the f-fall of \u201943. And then when I was over there I was working in a -- ina\nlumber camp for awhile, and then I -- I sent a letter to the British embassy in -- in Stockholm. I\nvolunteered for service in -- in the British forces, and I got a letter back asking me to come up for\nthis script, so I flew u -- I -- I took the train up there and -- and met the people in the -- in the\nembassy, and -- and the problem was that it would take, oh, I forgot, six months before there\nwould be room. They only had, that time, I think room for one or so every night, the flying a\nMosquito bomber back and forth. So I figured he -- by the time the war\u2019s over, it\u2019Il be too late to\ndo anything, so I went -- I went back to Denmark, and went back at the re -- the resistance stuff.\nAnd then I went -- twice more, I went over illegally to Sweden for whatever reason there was --\nsomebody had to get over there, and some had to -- had hotel some -- whatever. So I went over\nthere twice more and came back. So I was over -- all told, I was over there three times, back and\nforth.",
        "Q: So I -- that actually -- want to ask you a couple things. Just go back to that moment where you\ncan\u2019t talk to your mother, does she see you?",
        "A: No. No, she didn\u2019t. That must have been in the spring of \u201944, yeah, spring of 44.",
        "Q: Does she have any idea where you are at that point?",
        "A: She thought I was in Sweden.",
        "Q: So, were you wearing a disguise?",
        "A: No. No, but it was -- you know, you\u2019re in the street car, there\u2019s a lot of people and seeing one\nface out of many, she just didn't catch a glimpse of me. And I didn\u2019t want to call her, cause I\ndidn\u2019t want to cause any -- cau-cause her to get nervous or anything like that. If she figured I was\nin Sweden, she would figure I was, you know, safe and all that. So that\u2019s when I got caught; she\nfound out shortly after. Obviously she got kind of upset, so did my father. But then their -- when\nI -- when the war was over -- well okay, anyway, that\u2019s --",
        "Q: When you come back and you\u2019re not s -- well, let me ask it this way. When you come back\nand you see your mother on the streetcar, where are you living at that point?",
        "A: I was living at a house Lupine (Lupinvej) number nine that belonged to a Jewish family that\nhad taken off for Sweden. After I got caught, that was myself in the house and a young student,\nand when I got caught, the next day the Germans went out and blew the house up. Unfortunately,\nthey didn't tell the student, and he was sleeping upstairs. And in his bed he went through the\nwindow, out on the front lawn, still in his bed, without a scratch. That\u2019s rather unusual. Anyway,\nthe house was completely knee high. I\u2019m -- I -- I saw the people after the war, and they rebuild,\nand of course government paid for everything, so there wasn\u2019t any financial loss as far as they\nwere concerned.",
        "Q: Were you specifically sought after by the Germans? Did they know who you were?",
        "A: Well, when I got caught, and I got out to sh -- to Shell house and the fellow said my name --\nby that time it was too late to try to hide it. So I said what do you want, so he said oh, Steen, we\nbeen looking for you. Well, they may say that to everybody, just to try to scare you a little bit,\nbut anyway, it di -- it does kind of make you a little nervous. Whether they really did or not, I\ndon\u2019t know.",
        "Q: To their mind what -- what -- what were you up to? I mean wh -- why were you a danger?",
        "A: Well, you -- you c -- you got to admit to something. You can\u2019t just say that you -- you haven\u2019t\ndone anything. So you admit to as little as you think you can get by with. And then hope that\nthey\u2019re -- they\u2019re gonna buy it. Furthermore, they had -- they were -- they -- they -- they arrested\na lot of people at that time, so they were pretty busy, these fella -- these policeman that\ninterrogated you. And they couldn\u2019t spend that much time on you, so unless they got something\nout of you fairly soon in the game, they just usually shipped you down south and leave you there.",
        "Q: So what did you admit to?",
        "A: Somebu -- some with the -- with the papers, and there was one other thing, now what the hell\nwas that? There was one other thing, and I got by with that. It was something in connection with\nthe -- with this -- this parachute guy, cause they kind of tied it in. And he was dead, so he\ncouldn\u2019t say anything.",
        "Q: A-And you were caught with bombs?",
        "A: Yeah, we had bombs in the -- in the apartment.",
        "Q: Had you ever been involved in the bombing before?",
        "A: Oh yeah, with those little ones.",
        "Q: Can you just describe a situation where you bombed something?",
        "A: Well, this was with the tires. You -- you put them under the -- the German trucks and then\nwhen they -- when they drive over them they blow up and the tire\u2019s completely ruined. You\nknow, it\u2019s not as exciting as blowing up a factory, anything like that, but they had problem\ngetting enough tires for the trucks, so it was helpful.",
        "Q: Maybe you could take us through it. Wou -- would it be at night? Did you have the bombs in\na bag? Where would you go? How would you get them under the tires without being seen?\nHow\u2019d you do it?",
        "A: Well, you -- you try to do it when it\u2019s dark. You\u2019d go on -- on the -- on the -- you would go a\nbicycle if you have the proper lights. And you could go until, I forgot what it was, 11 o\u2019clock in\nthe evening there. So you could drive around, then if you saw one somewhere, you could just\nstop and stick one underneath and then peddle along.",
        "Q: So there was a kind of random quality to it --",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- you might just ride around and see what you could fin -- find.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct. When you found one you went after.",
        "Q: And did you go back and check later on to see if they had exploded?",
        "A: No. That wouldn\u2019t have done any good anyway, except if -- you would probably put another\none underneath them, but no, we didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: And how many tires do you think you were able to sabotage?",
        "A: Oh gee, I don\u2019t have any idea.",
        "Q: Like five, or 50?",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- I -- well, you know, with -- with those things, first of all, you never know when they\ngo off. You can put it underneath and it -- it may misfire. Or 1t may -- you may be lucky and get\nfour tires, the ones -- 1f you have those double -- double tires on the truck, so no, I wouldn\u2019t have\nany idea.",
        "Q: What other kinds of assignments were you getting? Were you being asked to go to Sweden\nand bring things back? Or people back?",
        "A: One time I went over with -- with some plans on -- for some fortifications on the -- on the\nwest coast of Denmark. I went to the -- as I recall it, delivered them to the police commissioner\nin Helsingborg a fellow name of Palm, and he -- he arranged for them to be shipped on.",
        "Q: Who were they being ultimately sent to?",
        "A: British embassy in -- in Stockholm. Delegation I think it was. British-Delegation.",
        "Q: And when you did go over to Sweden, how would you do it? How would you arrange getting\nover there?",
        "A: Well, go in one of the boats. We always knew somebody who was going, so -- so just go with\nthem over.",
        "Q: But was it suspicious for just a person to be on a fishing boat in the middle of the evening?",
        "A: Well, the fishermen were there.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Was --",
        "A: So I came -- oh, one time I came and I went up in a small town called Lanscona. And I didn\u2019t\nhave any place to stay that night so I called the Palm up in Helsingborg and he said -- he called\nme back shortly after, he said, well, the drunk tank is open tonight if you want it. So I went in\nthere and slept in a padded cell that night only time I ever been in one of those. But they were\nvery -- the Swedes were very good about everything, very helpful and did what they could.",
        "Q: And did you ever take any items, other than the -- the maps, the plans for the fortification,\nover to Sweden?",
        "A: No. No, just 0 -- what had to go. You didn\u2019t have that much room, so you just took what you\nhad to take, had to bring over.",
        "Q: And you -- did you ever bring guns back?",
        "A: No. No, the only thing I brought was that newspaper, British newspaper, which I shouldn\u2019t\nhave done. I only did that once.",
        "Q: In your daily life, what were your interactions like with the Germans, once you were 0 --\nactive in resisting them, what was it like to run into them on the street and maybe talk to them?\nWhat wa -- what was that like?",
        "A: You wouldn\u2019t talk to them, for one thing. And the other thing, they were -- they were running\naround on the -- you know, they were walking around on the street, and -- and you don\u2019t do\nanything special. I mean, you don\u2019t want to stand out in any way. Some -- some fellows tried to\njust stop them and -- and take their guns, you know, steal their gun, things like that, but that\ndidn\u2019t always work so well. They got caught, and then they were in trouble. And there was too\nmuch of a risk just for a gun. Wasn\u2019t worth it.",
        "Q: But on a daily basis, did you feel that you might get stopped and searched and caught? Was\nthat a fear you lived with every day?",
        "A: Well, yeah. You al -- al y -- you always worry about it, of course. Also, because there were\nthese people who would -- they would report people who were in the resistance to the Germans.\nSo you never know whether somebody like reported you in, and you know, you were likely to\nget picked up. That was one -- one thing you -- you kind of lived with. And that was about the\nhardest one of them all, because it\u2019s kind of a 24 hour a day proposition.",
        "Q: Can you remember a close call that you had, where you were very close to being discovered\nby the Nazis, besides the newspaper?",
        "A: Not offhand.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Was there any sense among the people that you did speak to, who were like yourself, in the\nresistance, what was the ultimate plan there? What was the goal?",
        "A: Oh take -- have the Germans lose. I mean, everybody was hoping for that, and after the --\nafter the inva -- I was still out when the invasion happened, and after that started -- that -- that\ncame about, you know, then there didn\u2019t seem to be much doubt who was going to win. And\nafter the invasion -- the German police got more difficult, was more active.",
        "Q: More what?",
        "A: There was more active.",
        "Q: More active, mm-hm.",
        "A: Particularly Gestapo fellows. So anyway, I mean, everybody -- everybody I think wa -- was\nconvinced that the allied was going to win.",
        "Q: Can you take us back then, to that night that you were caught? We -- we -- we\u2019ve mentioned\nit before, but let\u2019s just go back to there. You were with this parachute --",
        "A: Agent.",
        "Q: Agent.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And you were going to use these bombs on the tires. And just --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- what happened, the -- the ca -- the police came in, the Gestapo came in and what did they\nsay to you?",
        "A: Hit the floor. So you\u2019re down there, you\u2019re -- you don\u2019t argue when they come in, you know,\nwith a bunch of guns like that pointing at you, you just go ahead, and cooperate, do what they tell\nyou to do. So you get down on the floor and then pretty soon you -- you get the handcuffs. And\nthen the -- this was on the fifth floor, I think, in that apartment. Take you down, put you in a -- in\na truck and take you to that Shell house for interrogation.",
        "Q: And did they take the agent with you, even though he had died?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what happened to him. He was still lying on the floor when -- when I left. He is\nburied in the national cemetery over there now.",
        "Q: So there were a period of time and there were five interrogations, and this went over how long\na period of time?",
        "A: Oh, couple, three weeks. Couple of weeks, probably. Maybe three.",
        "Q: And are you see -- seeing anybody else at that time your -- that your fellow --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- fellow [indecipherable]",
        "A: Only that fellow that came with food.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Then after couple of weeks, another fellow came in, another prisoner come in, so we shared\nthe cell for the last -- I think I was there probably four weeks in that jail, so the last two weeks\nthere were two of us. I forgot -- I think he went -- he went to -- he went to Neuengamme too. He\nwas a baker.",
        "Q: Had you known him before?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Hm. Had you prepared in any way to be captured? Mentally?",
        "A: No. I mean, you al -- you always hope you\u2019re not gonna you're not going to get caught, but\nno I don\u2019t think you sit down and say, well if I\u2019m gonna get caught, I\u2019m gonna do so and so,\nthink so and so, you don\u2019t do that. I think it\u2019s simply too scary a thought.",
        "Q: So then what --",
        "A: And you se -- oh, oh, excuse me, but during that period, all the time the -- the Germans would\nshoot -- execute people, there was one innkeeper, he got caught because he and his family had\nbeen receiving some weapons parachuted down. And so he got shot, and I think he had two sons\nand a son-in-law, all -- all of them got shot at the same time. One of the kids was only 16 or 17.\nBut they were all executed. And the Germans would regularly execute people from the\nresistance, and they announced it in the -- in the paper, so it was no secret.",
        "Q: Why do you think you weren\u2019t ex -- executed?",
        "A: That is something that I will never know. They had to yo -- I mean, we were supposed to -- to\nget hanged, I was supposed to -- to -- supposedly sentenced to that, and this -- that happened on\nthe way. Why they did that I don\u2019t know it -- it -- I know one -- one of the 13 after the war met a\nguy, a German policeman -- shortly after the war, you know, and this fellow said to him, are you\nstill alive? This chap said, what do you mean by that? He said, Well, we heard you were gone\ndown Neuengamme he sent message that you were -- supposed to hang you down there. And I\nnever -- nothing ever -- and they used to hang people regularly down there. One time they -- they\nhanged eight Polish girls at one slot -- one time.",
        "Q: Danish police girls?",
        "A: No, Pol-Polish.",
        "Q: Oh, Polish girls, mm-hm.",
        "A: Polish girls. Yeah. Well, the fellow who was the head of the camp got hanged himself\neventually, after the war.",
        "Q: Talk a bit about the camp when you got there. What -- what happened when you first arrived\nthere?",
        "A: The first thing that you do is they take all your clothes. Then they shave you, anyplace they\ncan find, and -- and then you get some clothes that doesn\u2019t fit you very well. I wound up with a --\nwith a winter coat that was -- that wa -- must have been like from Poland because it was very\nthick material and there was like cotton in the middle. And it was nice and warm, but during\nthese long nights when we had these appelles, you stand out there for parade, and you were\nstanding out there for four, five or six hours until -- they had to count everybody, there were\n20,000 roughly, in the camp. And y -- if they only counted 19,999, we just stood there until they\nfound the last one. So at least the coat were nice and warm for that. So after they -- they put --\ngive you some clothes, then you\u2019re sent over to some barrack somewhere, and then you had to\nfind a place. There were usually oh, three guys to a bunk.",
        "Q: You say you had to find a place that -- so, you sort of walked in and you weren\u2019t assigned a\nplace --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- you had to see if you could sneak in somewhere [indecipherable]",
        "A: You know, you see if the -- well, one -- if there was one only, two people in --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- you know. One time I found one with only one fellow in, so I climbed in that one bed, then\nI found out why he was alone and I got out very quickly.",
        "Q: Why was he alone?",
        "A: Homosexual. So I was out, no time flat. Then we worked -- I think they woke us up at six.\nOh, there\u2019s been a lot written about that, you know, in -- people with better memory than mine.",
        "Q: Were there other people from the Danish resistance at that camp?",
        "A: The whole police force wound up there for awhile. All the Dane --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] the whole police force?",
        "A: Yeah, all the Danish policemen. They were there for awhile, then they got shipped to another\ncamp. My godparent\u2019s son was down there in the same place. I didn\u2019t even know he was -- been\npicked up, but I met him down there one time. So there were some other Danes, but the Danes\nwere all in -- in a number of different camps, they were not all in Neuengamme.",
        "Q: When you found someone you knew, did you try to stick with them, or bunk with them, or --",
        "A: No, but you were assigned to a barrack and you couldn\u2019t start running from one to the other.\nBe -- try to meet them when you can, you know. You had Sunday afternoon off, I think.",
        "Q: Off from what?",
        "A: Work.",
        "Q: What was your work?",
        "A: In the beginning we were keeping some -- they had some -- some -- two big buildings built o-\nof brick, and that\u2019s -- was meant originally as barracks for the -- th-the guards. Then later on they\nmoved the guards outside and then these were used for prisoners. But the basement was used for\n-- in -- in case of air raids. Not to protect the prisoners, but to make sure that in case a bomb hit\nsomeplace the prisoners couldn\u2019t run away. So our assignment for awhile was to keep them\nclean. Then for -- I was switched over one time to make some kind of machinery for volk -- for -\n- they had a -- a gun down there that the -- the home guard was using, supposedly more\ndangerous to be the guy f-firing it than the fellow who was in front of it, cause they blew up all\nthe time. And we were making some kind of a part to that Volksgewehr thing. And then -- oh\nthen I got jaundice, and -- and dysentery and went in -- in hospital and then the war was over.",
        "Q: What -- can you talk a little bit about the other people who were there? You said it wasn\u2019t just\nDanes, who else was there?",
        "A: There were Belgium, Holland, Polish, Russian. I got pretty friendly with a guy from Urkutsk,\nthat\u2019s way out in Siberia somewhere. I said Polish, and then there was some Czechs, and no\nItalians, no Norwegians that I know of, they were in another camp. But there were all told,\nroughly 20,000 there, and about on average 2,000 died every month.",
        "Q: How did you know?",
        "A: Well, you -- you hear this from the camp office, you know. I mean, there was a -- a f -- couple\no-of prisoners work in the camp office, and they were the one that wo -- w -- ha -- have access to\ninformation such as that.",
        "Q: Were there Jews in the camp?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know it specifically Jews, no. I don\u2019t think so. Ours w-were mostly political prisoners\nwhich was the red triangle. The green triangle was -- I think yellow was -- was -- was criminal,\nand there was some religious prisoners down there, because everybody had a sign on them. I had\n-- like I had a red D, for Danish political, and 67399.",
        "Q: That was your number?",
        "A: That was my number, yeah, after I got out of that politsi haftling.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: 67399, yeah.",
        "Q: And how were the barracks organized? Who was in charge?",
        "A: Some of the prisoners that had been there the longest was what they call camp, kind of camp\npolice kapo -- k-a-p-o, kapos. The kapo we had was a Polish guy. He\u2019d been there -- God, he\u2019d\nbeen there a long time, and he was supposed to kind of keep -- keep order in this barracks and\nmake sure everything worked out okay. He had a lot of authority from the -- from the Gestapo\npeople.",
        "Q: Well, what kind of person was he?",
        "A: He wasn\u2019t as bad as the Gestapo, but he was not a very friendly sort. It wasn\u2019t very easy for\nhim either probably because each -- I imagine each barrack had at least a thousand prisoners. So\nhe had to keep all that in order, and you know, had -- that\u2019s kind of a tall order, cause a I-lot of\nthem are pretty rough characters.",
        "Q: When they did execute people, was it done publicly, and were you made to watch?",
        "A: It was usually done Sunday -- see, Sunday we only worked half a day. So there we had the\nappelle, the counting in the morning and then on Sunday at 12 o\u2019clock. Regular days it would be\nin the morning and then again at six, at -- at a -- when work finished. But on Saturdays after the\nappelle was worked out they would hang them before we were excused from so we go back to\nour camp. Although the -- the Polish girls, they were hanged in the -- in the camp, they had a\nlittle jail there, and they took them in there and hanged them all.",
        "Q: And was that done in manner that you could observe?",
        "A: No, you couldn\u2019t see them.",
        "Q: Why were they hanged, do you know?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you usually know why people were hanged?",
        "A: Well, one guy was hanged because he tried to hide. He wa -- he was really a sa -- I think he\nwas kind of half -- half crazy. He had had so much of this camp that he wanted to get away, so he\nhid in a chimney somewhere. And so we were standing there waiting for this last one to count.\nFinally they found him, and then next Sunday they hanged him. So that was him. That was the\nend of that one.",
        "Q: Did you ever consider trying to escape?",
        "A: No. No, by the time you have these dog ruled barbed wire fencing and they were about what,\n12 feet high, and you have dogs running around in between, and you have people -- ma-machine\nguns all over. You had nightlights shining down these -- between the two. No, you don\u2019t stand a\nchance. I don\u2019t know of anybody who ever got out of Neuengamme anyway.",
        "Q: So once you got in and you saw that, how did you intend to survive?",
        "A: By surviving. I mean, there\u2019s -- we were fortunate in -- in a sense that after a few month we\nstarted getting food packages from -- from the Danish Red Cross. And there was -- the beginning\nthere was a -- th-there was soap -- soap in them, there was food in them, there was all kinds of\nthings. But in the beginning the Germans would open up the box, open all the packages and\ndump everything in -- in a -- in a bowl, so you get your soapsuds, and your salami and your\ncoffee beans all in one nice mess. But then after awhile then they would leave them alone and\nthen they worked out fine. One of the big things was salami, they used to ship us -- God knows\nhow much salami. You can get tired of that if you get too much. But that really is what -- what\nhelped again. And then this -- one time they sent us some clothes, you got a jacket, which was\nbadly needed.",
        "Q: Were the other groups of people, the Poles, the other groups you mentioned, were they getting\npackages?",
        "A: Not that I know of, never saw anybody get any.",
        "Q: Do you know if the resistance was involved in helping the Red Cross get you this stuff, or\nwas it just the Red Cross on its own?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if -- if the people in the resistance hadn\u2019t been involved\nin some of it, but I -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know one way or the other for sure.",
        "Q: Is that something where your parents could send you a package?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did they know where you were?",
        "A: We were permitted to write a letter, was every month or every six weeks, and we were told\nwhat we could say. You know, I\u2019m only -- I\u2019m fine, how are you, I hope you are fine, good-bye.",
        "Q: Did you write it?",
        "A: Oh yeah. Well, at least it was your handwriting. So they knew you were still alive, that\u2019s\nabout all it amounted to.",
        "Q: Was there any one person or couple people that you became particularly close to at the ca --\nin the camp?",
        "A: Well, of course, out of the -- the 13 of us that went down at the same time, we managed pretty\nmuch to stick together. The minister got shipped to another camp. The one fellow died, but the\nother one -- the two -- two got moved to another section, but there was about six or seven, and\nwe -- we managed to stick pretty much together.",
        "Q: Were you in the same barracks?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Oh, you were?",
        "A: And we -- we came back on the same bus.",
        "Q: Who -- do you remember any of their names? Or, which names do you remember?",
        "A: Well, the fellow that died, his name was Thompson.",
        "Q: That was the parachute agent?",
        "A: No, no, that was one of the 13.",
        "Q: Oh, one of the 13.",
        "A: He was an innkeeper from just south of Elsinore.",
        "Q: He was executed?",
        "A: No, he died of TB.",
        "Q: Oh, he died of TB.",
        "A: I think he died of TB.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: The other ones -- the one called Christenson, he\u2019s the guy that had the stroke after the war.\nNo, I don\u2019t remem -- remember their names.",
        "Q: Did you know those men -- they were all men?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Did you know them before you went in?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You call them the 13, okay. But you were rounded up together?",
        "A: We were --",
        "Q: You were interrogated together?",
        "A: No, we were pulled out of jail together and shipped down south together.",
        "Q: Okay, you were pulled out of jail together, and --",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know them.",
        "Q: -- you became a unit when you were shipped down south --",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: -- to the concentration camp.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. And when were you sent to the concentration camp?",
        "A: When?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: That must have been in July of \u201944, or August. Sometime in the summer of \u201944.",
        "Q: But not -- just to get all this clear in my mind then, so you didn\u2019t know each other before, but\nthen you got to know each other as you were shipped down.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Were you all Danish?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Had you all been in the resistance?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Okay. So, you don\u2019t remember their names, but if you could just talk a little bit about how\nyou stuck together when you were in the camp, what small things would you do for each other,\nor what might you talk about together?",
        "A: Well, like I say, the preferred subject was what are we going to do when we get out. There\nwasn\u2019t really much to talk about what we had done -- not much to talk about what we\u2019d done\nduring the war. That was kind of a item you didn\u2019t really talk much about. There wasn\u2019t really\nthat much to talk about either what you had done before the war, it was really mostly what --\nwhat you gonna do from now on, when the war\u2019s over, when you get out.",
        "Q: What kept you going when you were in the camp?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m -- I kind of wondered too once in awhile because you see, some people -- I\nn --6 there was one Danish fellow I knew, tall, strong, big, good looking, he didn't last a month.\nHe just seemed like he -- he collapsed, he just kind of fell apart. And all the small, skinny\nfellows, you know, that would ca -- kind of hang around. So it has nothing to do with physique.",
        "Q: Mm. Did you pray? Did you rely on your faith?",
        "A: Yeah, and that\u2019s where we -- we had that minister, which was very helpful.",
        "Q: Tell us about that.",
        "A: One of the 13 was a minister.",
        "Q: Tell us about that.",
        "A: I can\u2019t even think of his name any more, but he was good, he was very, very good. Very nice\nchap.",
        "Q: What would he do?",
        "A: Well, you know, he would ta -- he\u2019d talk to you an-and cheer you up, and pray a little and\nthings like that. Can\u2019t think of his name, but he was there an-and that must have been like in -- in\nJanuary of \u201945. The Germans ca -- ca -- I think they collected all the ministers in one particular\ncamp, and he was -- he was shipped down there.",
        "Q: When -- when did you get sick?",
        "A: Oh, it was on March or April of \u201945. Course, jaundice is something that kind of comes fairly\nslowly. I mean, it\u2019s not like all of a sudden boom. Dysentery kind of comes pretty quick, and I\nwas in so-called hospital for -- oh, I guess it was only three or four days before we were moved\nwith the buses back to Denmark.",
        "Q: So just give me the chronology, do you -- you got sick and then were you taken out of the\nconcentration camp to a separate hospital?",
        "A: No, it was just 00 --",
        "Q: You just were in the hospital in the concentration camp?",
        "A: Just one of the barracks, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. And how sick were you, I mean, were you -- could you get out of bed and walk?",
        "A: Yeah. But you know, yellow jaundice, you\u2019re all -- your eyes are yellow, your face yellow\nand --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- and then you -- when you have this dysentery on top of that, that makes it not so good.",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: Besides, they didn\u2019t have any medicine for anything.",
        "Q: Right. At what point -- what happens then?",
        "A: Well then, the head of the Swedish Red Cross, a fellow name -- name -- fe-fellow by the\nname of Bernadotte had made a deal with Himmler, that he would try to negotiate with the allied\nand get a peace going, and the price for that, Hitler had -- Himmler had to pay was to agree that\nall Danish and Norwegian concentrace -- concentration camp inmates should be shipped to\nSweden until the end of the war. So that\u2019s when several white buses came down to the camp.\nFirst they collected a bunch of prisoners from other camps in Neuengamme, Norwegian and the\nDanish. Then the buses came down, and then they took all the prisoners up to a camp just north\nof the Danish German border, fa -- a place called Froslev So we come up there and we were\nthere for a couple of days and then they took us by bus and they -- and train, we were supposed\nto go through Copenhagen and over to Sweden. But I didn't want to go back to Sweden. So just\nbefore the -- you get into Copenhagen there\u2019s fairly long hill. And I was in the first car, so I went\nup in the platform and ended up -- said to the -- to the engineer, I want to get off. So he said well,\nhe could slow down at that hill there, which he did, and then I jumped off the train. And then I\nwas in -- in Denmark.",
        "Q: You jumped off the train, did -- does that mean that you fell, and you had to roll?",
        "A: Well yeah, jump. I didn\u2019t fall, I jumped off.",
        "Q: You just jumped off and you ended up standing up?",
        "A: No, oh no, no, you roll. You roll a lot. I mean, they\u2019re moving fairly fast.",
        "Q: But you were sick.",
        "A: Well, no sicker than I got on the train. Yeah, I had been -- they took us from the camp in\nGermany, took us across the border to Denmark, put us in this camp down there just over the\nborder. We were there for maybe a week, and then the -- we were gonna go to Sweden. And as\nwe came with these buses o-over the border to Denmark, the first place they took us to was a\ndairy. We could have all the milk we wanted. And not having had any milk for about eight\nmonth, and I drank a lot you really get a tummy ache. It sure tasted good. So then I got off the\ntrain in Copenhagen, and s -- I went over to somebody I knew down there and couple of days\nlater I went and got the -- some I.D.. And then I went up to Elsinore and stayed for a few days\nwith a -- with a couple- And then I heard one night the war was over. So I called my parents and\nthen I spoke with them and bought a bicycle, drove home. That was a nice trip. And that was\nMay five, \u201945. Interesting years.",
        "Q: How did things seem at home, when you got home? How was your mom and dad and your\nsister?",
        "A: My father was at work and so was my sister, so I called them. My mother was there, she said,\nwhat can I do, you want a sandwich? Of course sure I did that. So I had something to eat. Then I\n-- I went out to the office I used to work, just to say hello and I was back. And they said,\nwhenever you\u2019re ready, come on back. So then I went back home again, my father got home.\nAnd then I was home for a couple of days, and then they told me to go to the hospital because of\nthe jaundice and that. So I was in the hospital for about a week I guess. And then I was on -- in\nthe -- in the countryside for a week, and then back to work. I think I was back to work within\nfour weeks after I come back from Germany. There wasn\u2019t any of the psychological\nstraightening out assistance and everything like that. So I went back. And then I worked for a\ncouple of month, then I heard about that job in England, went over there.",
        "Q: How did you celebrate your homecoming that night with your parents?",
        "A: Well, I guess we just talked. They wanted to know how it had been, and I wanted to know\nwhat had happened there, you know. So I\u2019m -- I\u2019m sure we talked until rather late in the evening.\nBut there wasn\u2019t any celebration in that sense. There was just -- I guess we were both pretty --\npretty pleased we were still alive.",
        "Q: Had the Germans left?",
        "A: Oh no, they were all over. They were all over the place. No, they didn\u2019t leave, but you know\nthey -- they -- the British and the -- and the American came in, and the Germans had given up in\nall but one very small part of Denmark where they want to fight, and eventually the Russians\nbumped them out of that Bornholm. But -- so the Germans start -- just started walking -- walking\nhome. Nice to see them leave.",
        "Q: Did people just let them go, or were people angry and did they retaliate?",
        "A: No, they -- they just let them go. A lot of the Germans would buy -- tried to buy food to take\nhome. But the time they get down to the border they just had to leave everything in one big pile.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: The -- the -- not to take them back to -- to Germany. For one thing, they were paying with --\nwith money that the German army had borrowed from the Danish government, which means that\nin a sense the Danish government was paying for all this stuff. So they didn\u2019t want to -- all that\nstuff to leave Denmark.",
        "Q: And how were people treating collaborators who -- who had survived the war?",
        "A: Well, the standard operation for the women, you cut their hair off. You have them standing on\na -- on a truck and you drive through Copenhagen. For the -- for the men, same thing, cut the --\ncut them bald and same thing, and then they put them all in jail and you kind of straighten out\nwithin a few weeks, you know, who should stay in jail, and -- and who hadn\u2019t been that bad, they\ncould let them out. There were -- some of the worst fellows, some of them who would be\nshooting Danes for instance there-was some of that going on, too. They wound up, and the com -\n- some of them got executed. They were shot. But I don\u2019t think there were more than 40 and 50\nall told, like that. And then there were some that were put in jail. The German general and the\nhead of the Gestapo in Denmark, people like that, they were -- they were put in jail, they were in\nfor six or seven years, then they shipped them out, back to Germany. So there was a big party\nthat night.",
        "Q: Which night?",
        "A: That night the war was over. You know, you would have all the -- all your doors, your\nwindows open, all the lights you wanted, you can -- you can put candles out in the street if you\nwant to do that. You could play all the music we want, with the doors open. Could do all those\nthings you couldn\u2019t do during the war.",
        "Q: So people did that?",
        "A: Yep. As I recall, my mother had one can of Portuguese sardines she had left. We ate that\nnight, celebration. Yeah, that was some party. And then we were back to work, and then the --\nthe daily routine started again.",
        "Q: Some way -- I\u2019m not sure exactly when, I think that you were in Sweden and you ran into\nsomebody who recognized you, that you had helped. A doctor and his wife?",
        "A: Oh, ah --",
        "Q: Can you tell that story?",
        "A: Yeah, that was Dr. Erstwag, I think.",
        "Q: Okay. Just tell us that story. How did that happen?",
        "A: Yeah, I met him sometime over there. Oh, I knew he was over naturally, cause I\u2019d helped him\nget over, but I didn't know where he was, and I met him on the street one day, I don\u2019t even\nremember what town it was. But he wa -- it was nice to see them, th-they both looked -- and the\nbaby was doing well. Started walking and everything else. Little girl.",
        "Q: Was this the couple that had been inside the beer cases?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: No, th-they went over with -- they went over with a fishing boat, I think.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t recognize them necessarily, but they recognized you?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And what did they say to you?",
        "A: Well, th-they told me they appreciate what I -- helped them get over and all that, and told me\nhow well they were doing and everything else. They were looking forward to getting back before\nlong. Back to Denmark. Then he died shortly after, but I met her years later.",
        "Q: How do you think your country dealt with the war after the war? Did people just push things\naside, or were there wounds that really had to be healed somehow? You think it was something\nthat really weighed on people?",
        "A: I think there was a -- a -- quite a lot of people who realized that the people who been resistant\nhad -- had taken some awful lumps, physically, financially. What they did on the physical part of\nit was built some old age homes specifically for people who had been involved with that. They\nhave five of them, I think, in Denmark now. On the financial part, they examined eventually\neverybody. That was -- I think it was five years before I ever wa-was checked out and -- to find\nout whether you have anything anything wrong, any -- any lowered ability of making your\nliving, And things like that.. And if -- decided, I think they decided I was 60 percent unable to\nwork full speed. So then they give you a certain amount of money to make up for that. Well I\nbeen working right along, but of course if -- if I hadn\u2019t been down there, things might have\nworked out a little bit better, because you do have certain problems after that. I mean ow -- you\ndon\u2019t sleep as good as you -- you normally would. There are -- there are certain disadvantages.\nBut I think they\u2019ve been very liberal over there in -- in what they\u2019ve been doing.",
        "Q: Do you have trouble sleeping?",
        "A: Yeah. But nothing compared to what I used to.",
        "Q: What was the problem wa -- before that was so bad?",
        "A: All of a sudden you -- you are back there, in -- in some of it, and -- then you kind of wake up,\nyou know, and you\u2019re a little unhappy and takes awhile before you go back to bed -- go back to\nsleep.",
        "Q: Nightmares. You\u2019re talking about nightmares.",
        "A: In a sense, yeah, that\u2019s what it is. But eventually, I think, you get pretty much over that.",
        "Q: But you had them for a long time?",
        "A: Yeah. But it doesn\u2019t bother me any more now, fortunately. So -- oh, I came out pretty good, I\nmean. Physically, mentally, everything else, I came out a lot better than a bunch of fellows did.",
        "Q: Is there something I haven\u2019t asked that you would like to say?",
        "A: Well, I think I gotta say the government has been very liberal, considerate and -- and\neverything else like that. Some of the -- some of the natives had a little different attitude, but --\nlittle bit more shortsighted. He didn\u2019t help me any, so what good he done for me? But that\u2019s a\nminority. I\u2019ve been over there, oh, I don\u2019t know, 20 times since then, and it -- it\u2019s nice to get over\nthere, but it\u2019s not like they used to be, I mean, like it was before the war. And I guess it\u2019ll never\nbe like that, at least won\u2019t -- it won\u2019t for me.",
        "Q: Well, how is it different?",
        "A: Oh, because you can\u2019t help, you walk around and you get to think, you know, this happened\nthere, and that happened there, you know, those things [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Yo-You can\u2019t be there without the war, you\u2019re saying?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: The war is always with you.",
        "A: Yeah. Yep.",
        "Q: Okay, and what is this here?",
        "A: That\u2019s my passport, issued in 1942 and worth ti -- valid until 1947.",
        "Q: Don\u2019t think, let\u2019s just double check. And this one here?",
        "A: And this one here is from \u201947 to \u201952.",
        "Q: Okay, when is this one here?",
        "A: Ah, when was that? From \u201950 -- 752 to \u00b058. 1952 to \u201950 -- \u201958, yeah. And that was the last\nDanish passport I had. Then \u201954, I became a U.S. citizen.\nEnd of Tape Three\nConclusion of Interview\n"

Were you\njust sort of up every day, hardly sleeping, or -- what was going on for you? Ho -- were you\ngetting assignments of other people to help, or --",
        "Q: But when you say you\u2019re on, how do you know you\u2019re supposed to be on? Does someone\ncome and tell you we need you tonight?",
        "Q: Was there a point that you became known and relied upon for the work that you\u2019re able to do\nin the resistance?",
        "Q: And who was that?",
        "Q: It was -- did you ever receive any training for what you were doing?",

        "Q: Oh.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "Q: Okay. When you were to leave your home and you might be going -- I\u2019ll go back to the\nperiod where -- the two week period where all the rescues were taking place, when you would\nleave your home, would you be aware that someone might be following you?",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t feel like people knew what you were doing?",
        "Q: And did you ever have any encounters with the Danish police?",
        "Q: How did you regard them, though? I\u2019ve heard that it was a sort of an open secret that they --\nthey knew that some of this resistance was going on --",
        "Q: -- and they didn\u2019t try very hard to stop it.",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: -- that they were rescued?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Can you talk a little bit about the money. These -- these rescues did take money, you had to\ntake taxis, or trains, or pay the fishermen. Where were you getting the money to make this\nhappen?",
        "Q: So in the instances that you were involved in, no money was paid to the fishermen?",
        "Q: Did they ever say why they were doing this?",
        "Q: I read that one prominent activist, [indecipherable] Jacobsen said that -- that it really wasn\u2019t\nabout Jews, it was -- it was more about democracy, that the Danes were tired of the Germans\nbeing there --",
        "Q: -- resented it.",
        "Q: There were other Jews that had to get to Sweden?",
        "Q: Were there people that you knew, that you admired 1-in your country, who -- for their\nresistance also? That inspired you, I guess.",

        "Q: Oh, so you -- you shot it, but you also then decided you were outnumbered?",
        "Q: Okay. So what were you going to do? Take all the guns?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: So wa -- did you have any successful raids on German depots --",
        "Q: -- where you did get guns?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: When was the other time that you used your gun, or one of the other times? You said there\nwere a few occasions.",
        "Q: Shoot and go?",
        "Q: Oh, little shooting, uh-huh. So you were going to -- to kill her.",
        "Q: Did she ever get killed?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So she was part of your group, but she had --",
        "Q: Other people.",
        "Q: But something like that, the elimination of someone, is that something you took upon\nyourself, or was that -- did that come as an order from someone?",
        "Q: And what\u2019s that --",
        "Q: How would you hear? What is upstairs?",
        "Q: Oh, that came from the Freedom Council?",

        "Q: Okay. At this point are you beginning also to do some sabotage?",
        "Q: It smelled like?",
        "Q: Marzipan?",
        "Q: Okay. What else are you doing to resist at this point?",
        "Q: In what amount of time?",
        "Q: The -- the parachute man who committed suicide, wa-was he Danish?",
        "Q: Did you have a pill?",
        "Q: Why -- why did he do that?",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "Q: How much had you worked with him?",
        "Q: Did you know he was going to do that if you were caught?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Yeah.",

        "Q: And how long did that go on?",
        "Q: What was the name of the camp?",
        "Q: Did you know that camp existed before you were sent to it?",
        "Q: And your camp was in your country, or were you --",
        "Q: It was in Germany.",
        "Q: And -- but before we really move on to the -- to the camps, just wondering if you could talk a\nlittle bit about why you think the people in your country really sort of came up and in this\nspontaneous, organized fashion helped rescue so many people? What do you think gave them the\ndesire, the will to do that?",
        "Q: Yes, particularly that. That two week period but just the ongoing --",
        "Q: And the people who didn\u2019t, I mean, how did you feel about them?",
        "Q: You haven\u2019t really mentioned the king much. Is he someone who inspired you?",
        "Q: And can you talk about that?",
        "Q: How could you tell he was anti-German?",
        "Q: Did you yourself ever see him riding his horse?",
        "Q: Can you describe that?",
        "Q: In this period in 1943 - 1944, what would you say is the most difficult thing you had to do?",
        "Q: Why wouldn\u2019t you get off and say hi?",
        "Q: Tell us about that, you -- you went to Sweden, why and what did you do there, and then how\ndid you come back?",
        "Q: So I -- that actually -- want to ask you a couple things. Just go back to that moment where you\ncan\u2019t talk to your mother, does she see you?",
        "Q: Does she have any idea where you are at that point?",
        "Q: So, were you wearing a disguise?",
        "Q: When you come back and you\u2019re not s -- well, let me ask it this way. When you come back\nand you see your mother on the streetcar, where are you living at that point?",
        "Q: Were you specifically sought after by the Germans? Did they know who you were?",
        "Q: To their mind what -- what -- what were you up to? I mean wh -- why were you a danger?",
        "Q: So what did you admit to?",
        "Q: A-And you were caught with bombs?",
        "Q: Had you ever been involved in the bombing before?",
        "Q: Can you just describe a situation where you bombed something?",
        "Q: Maybe you could take us through it. Wou -- would it be at night? Did you have the bombs in\na bag? Where would you go? How would you get them under the tires without being seen?\nHow\u2019d you do it?",
        "Q: So there was a kind of random quality to it --",
        "Q: -- you might just ride around and see what you could fin -- find.",
        "Q: And did you go back and check later on to see if they had exploded?",
        "Q: And how many tires do you think you were able to sabotage?",
        "Q: Like five, or 50?",
        "Q: What other kinds of assignments were you getting? Were you being asked to go to Sweden\nand bring things back? Or people back?",
        "Q: Who were they being ultimately sent to?",
        "Q: And when you did go over to Sweden, how would you do it? How would you arrange getting\nover there?",
        "Q: But was it suspicious for just a person to be on a fishing boat in the middle of the evening?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Was --",
        "Q: And did you ever take any items, other than the -- the maps, the plans for the fortification,\nover to Sweden?",
        "Q: And you -- did you ever bring guns back?",
        "Q: In your daily life, what were your interactions like with the Germans, once you were 0 --\nactive in resisting them, what was it like to run into them on the street and maybe talk to them?\nWhat wa -- what was that like?",
        "Q: But on a daily basis, did you feel that you might get stopped and searched and caught? Was\nthat a fear you lived with every day?",
        "Q: Can you remember a close call that you had, where you were very close to being discovered\nby the Nazis, besides the newspaper?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Was there any sense among the people that you did speak to, who were like yourself, in the\nresistance, what was the ultimate plan there? What was the goal?",
        "Q: More what?",
        "Q: More active, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Can you take us back then, to that night that you were caught? We -- we -- we\u2019ve mentioned\nit before, but let\u2019s just go back to there. You were with this parachute --",
        "Q: Agent.",
        "Q: And you were going to use these bombs on the tires. And just --",
        "Q: -- what happened, the -- the ca -- the police came in, the Gestapo came in and what did they\nsay to you?",
        "Q: And did they take the agent with you, even though he had died?",
        "Q: So there were a period of time and there were five interrogations, and this went over how long\na period of time?",
        "Q: And are you see -- seeing anybody else at that time your -- that your fellow --",
        "Q: -- fellow [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Had you known him before?",
        "Q: Hm. Had you prepared in any way to be captured? Mentally?",
        "Q: So then what --",
        "Q: Why do you think you weren\u2019t ex -- executed?",
        "Q: Danish police girls?",
        "Q: Oh, Polish girls, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Talk a bit about the camp when you got there. What -- what happened when you first arrived\nthere?",
        "Q: You say you had to find a place that -- so, you sort of walked in and you weren\u2019t assigned a\nplace --",
        "Q: -- you had to see if you could sneak in somewhere [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Why was he alone?",
        "Q: Were there other people from the Danish resistance at that camp?",

        "Q: When you found someone you knew, did you try to stick with them, or bunk with them, or --",
        "Q: Off from what?",
        "Q: What was your work?",
        "Q: What -- can you talk a little bit about the other people who were there? You said it wasn\u2019t just\nDanes, who else was there?",
        "Q: How did you know?",
        "Q: Were there Jews in the camp?",
        "Q: That was your number?",

        "Q: And how were the barracks organized? Who was in charge?",
        "Q: Well, what kind of person was he?",
        "Q: When they did execute people, was it done publicly, and were you made to watch?",
        "Q: And was that done in manner that you could observe?",
        "Q: Why were they hanged, do you know?",
        "Q: Did you usually know why people were hanged?",
        "Q: Did you ever consider trying to escape?",
        "Q: So once you got in and you saw that, how did you intend to survive?",
        "Q: Were the other groups of people, the Poles, the other groups you mentioned, were they getting\npackages?",
        "Q: Do you know if the resistance was involved in helping the Red Cross get you this stuff, or\nwas it just the Red Cross on its own?",
        "Q: Is that something where your parents could send you a package?",
        "Q: Did they know where you were?",
        "Q: Did you write it?",

        "Q: That was the parachute agent?",
        "Q: Oh, one of the 13.",
        "Q: He was executed?",
        "Q: Oh, he died of TB.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "Q: Did you know those men -- they were all men?",
        "Q: Did you know them before you went in?",
        "Q: You call them the 13, okay. But you were rounded up together?",
        "Q: You were interrogated together?",
        "Q: Okay, you were pulled out of jail together, and --",
        "Q: -- you became a unit when you were shipped down south --",

        "Q: Okay. And when were you sent to the concentration camp?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: But not -- just to get all this clear in my mind then, so you didn\u2019t know each other before, but\nthen you got to know each other as you were shipped down.",
        "Q: Were you all Danish?",
        "Q: Had you all been in the resistance?",
        "Q: Okay. So, you don\u2019t remember their names, but if you could just talk a little bit about how\nyou stuck together when you were in the camp, what small things would you do for each other,\nor what might you talk about together?",
        "Q: What kept you going when you were in the camp?",

        "Q: Was this the couple that had been inside the beer cases?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t recognize them necessarily, but they recognized you?",
        "Q: And what did they say to you?",
        "Q: How do you think your country dealt with the war after the war? Did people just push things\naside, or were there wounds that really had to be healed somehow? You think it was something\nthat really weighed on people?",
        "Q: Do you have trouble sleeping?",
        "Q: What was the problem wa -- before that was so bad?",
        "Q: Nightmares. You\u2019re talking about nightmares.",
        "Q: But you had them for a long time?",

        "Q: Well, how is it different?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Yo-You can\u2019t be there without the war, you\u2019re saying?",

The people across the street, o-on -- other people on the street we knew well.

        "A: Yeah, she had one too. My father didn\u2019t, though, he used to walk, or streetcar.",
        "A: There was a -- there was an outfit in Denmark that made them. No, I can\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know off\nhand.",
        "A: What happened to them -- well, for one thing, I went to a boy\u2019s school, and some of the\nfellows -- one or-- two of them I\u2019m still in contact with. One wound up in a real estate outfit, and\nsat in the same office in Copenhagen for about 60 -- 50 years or something like that. Then -- he -\n- he\u2019s now retired with Parkinson\u2019s, pretty bad shape. Another one wound up as a -- hada\nbookstore, and one was a professor in some medicine. One was the head tax man in -- on a small\nisland in Denmark. I was told once he was the most hated man on the island. I guess that goes\nwith being a tax collector. And that\u2019s about the only ones I know what happened to them.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: Hello there.",
        "A: Well, we would leave from the rowing club in Copenhagen, usually on Friday, usually after s\n-- after work, and -- which would be -- we leave about six, seven o\u2019clock. And of course, in the\nsummertime it\u2019s light until 11. So you go up the coast, and stop someplace up there, and we had\ns -- a certain place picked out we could stay in. Put up your tent and do some cooking and put\nyour sleeping bag out. And next day just fool around on the beach, just swimming and all that\nstuff. That was -- that would be on a Saturday and then on Sunday row back to the rowing club.",
        "A: Oh, started when I was about 15.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Well, for -- the truth is worse than -- the -- honesty and not to be late. They tell you that thing\nabout not to be late when you have an appointment. Be on time and be ready. So those were\nsome of the important ones.",
        "A: Well, there wasn\u2019t any doubt about it, you had to be honest, you know. Or, if you get caught\nnot being honest, that was not advisable.",
        "A: Oh, pretty smooth. Didn\u2019t have many problems.",
        "A: Oh yeah, to go -to the rowing club that was about a half hour\u2019s ride or something like that.\nHalf hour by bicycle. See I started working when I was 15, so that kind of changed the whole\nsituation. Worked full time.",
        "A: I finished school. I started school when I was five years old, in first grade, and then 10 years\nschools, so I was f-finished at 15, and then I got a job, I was supposed to start the first of\nSeptember, but they called from the office and a -- oh, a couple of weeks early and said they\nwere kind of short, could I start earlier. This was on a Thursday. And I was sitting -- my mother\npicked up the phone, I was sitting right there, so she told the gentleman, Mr. [indecipherable]\nthat sh -- sure, I could do that. So he want to know when I could start. I -- could I come in on\nMonday? My mother said, no, Monday, that\u2019s a bad day to start on. So how about tomorrow,\nFriday? Oh, Friday\u2019s a bad day to start. Well, when could he start? He can be there in a half hour.\nSo I went out, got on my bicycle, and went in and started work. That was in a Danish Steamship\nowner\u2019s association as a -- as a messenger, and I was there from August til the end of March, and\nthen I got a job in a steamship company as an apprentice, and I was there three years.",
        "A: \u00b037? Yeah, \u00b037.",
        "A: Ah, well, w-we -- I had to supply my own bicycle, of course. I had to drive around, deliver\nmail, and -- and run down to post office with telegrams and all those -- stuff like that.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Oh, I think she knew I was kind of bored. There comes a time, you know, on a vacation when\n-- this vacation, you know, if you want to do something else-- I was anxious to get started\nworking anyway. I wanted to work the ships, so I was lucky I got into that kind of business.",
        "A: Oh, I guess your -- Denmark is a small country, and I think the fact that you always work with\nships, you know, you -- you\u2019ve fooled around with the whole world. You have ships running all\nover and. You meet people from all over the world. Wind up working all over the world, too. So\nI -- I really liked that.",
        "A: We had, in the school, as a -- as a routine there was religious instruction one hour a week.\nAnd we had, I think about two Jews in my class, Leif Manyas, and [indecipherable] I think that\nwas, and they were both excused from the -- from the religious instruction, as a matter of routine.\nAnd that was really the first I ever heard about Jews. My sister had a girlfriend that was Jewish.",
        "A: Oh, same community as non-Jews. Oh, just like everybody else. Oh yeah, there was no\ndifferent there, they would live in -- in the -- I don\u2019t know if there was anybody in the\nneighborhood we were, I am not so sure, but there might have been.",
        "A: Yeah, you never -- you never kind of thought about whether anybody is Jewish or Catholic or\nMuhammadan or Lutheran, whatever they were. I mean, we all thought there wouldn't be any\ndifference between a Jew and a non-Jew, for instance.",
        "A: Well, a lot of the stockbrokers, for instance, lot of stockbroker outfits were run by Jewish\npeople, in name, Jewish names. [indecipherable] was one name -- Goldsmith was one.\nHanseiger, I -- I knew those people. [indecipherable |",
        "A: There was one synagogue.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: In the middle of Copenhagen.",
        "A: Inside? No, not inside. Oh, I passed it often, I -- my father\u2019s office was about a block down\nthe street, so I passed it regularly, but I never been inside.",
        "A: Well, it was a matter o-of running around to the various steamship companies with mail and --\nand messages, and stuff like that. Also running to companies that was involved with shipping,\nlike companies that took care of the signing on of sailors, the customs, immigration. Certain o-\nofficial outfits.",
        "A: \u00b036 to -- to the end of March in \u201940. About three years.",
        "A: Well, probably, you know, the -- in the newscast on the -- on the newspapers. I was on the\nvacation in -- in May \u201939 in Germany on the youth hostel tour, friend of mine and I were down,\nand we took the train to Hamburg, stayed in a youth hostel, that was on a ship as a matter of fact.\nAnd then with a -- with boat, with train, walking, we went down to Koblenz and the Rhine went\ndown to Heidelberg, and then we came back through Berlin, we came back to Copenhagen,\nabout two weeks. The other vacations, when I worked for the steamship company they used to\nput -- put us on the ship as a deck boy and I\u2019d work on the ship for two or three weeks, to give\nyou some idea about the practical part of the shipping. And also that gave you a chance to go\nsome of the ports around, see them loading. I was in Riga one time, we were loading railroad\nties. In Finland one time we were loading props -- what they used in the -- in the mines in\nEngland.",
        "A: No, there really wasn\u2019t much feeling about that.",
        "A: No. No. Then I got called in on the first of April for -- for conscription, and of course that --\non the ninth of April the Germans came in. That was a short affair.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, of course, I was down there in May of \u201939, in -- in the Germany, but then when\nthe war started in September, and being in the shipping business, that made a whale ofa\ndifference in -- in the way we had to operate. For one thing, there was a danger of -- of mines\nand -- and you know, torpedoes and all that stuff. And there was a danger in the ships going into\nGermany, they were down there to load coal for Denmark, and there was a danger of losing\nships, losing personnel. So, you know, the whole thing changed. Actually overnight there on --\non the -- the Sep-September, the first, I think, the ger -- German entered Poland on the 13\" and\nthe French declared war against Germany. That\u2019s when really the things started popping.",
        "A: Well, there was -- of course the minute you go to a German port, they were more controlled\nby the German military. In Denmark there was -- oh, a lot of things you had to -- to secure the\nships against magnetic mines and things like that. You had to put extra lifesaving equipment on\nthem, all those kinds of things. You had special instructions from -- from the military which --\nwhere -- where to sail, where to avoid. So that meant running around and picking up instructions\nfrom the military whenever a ship was going to leave.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t.",
        "A: You know when y -- when you are -- when you are 18 or 19, you really don\u2019t think that much\nabout things like that. There was a lot of other things going on. You\u2019re kind of busy, so uh\nobviously it was kind of scary when you -- the Germans were never very popular in Denmark for\none thing. This goes back to a -- a war in 1864 when Germany and Denmark were fighting and\nDenmark lost that war. And part of Denmark was given over to -- to Germany. That was then\nreturned to Denmark in 1920. But there was still a lot of national [indecipherable] dislike in\nDenmark of the Germans, they were not very popular, never have been. So it -- it was --\nobviously it was scary when you see what was going on in Poland and in -- in -- in France.",
        "A: Well, there was -- you know, you couldn\u2019t have any lights outside at nighttime, everything\nhad to be turned off. You had to be careful walking or driving at night. Things started getting\nrationed. There was a lot of things you couldn\u2019t get. And what makes it hard was that when you\nsit in Denmark and you couldn\u2019t get all these thing -- movies, bananas, what have you, you\nwould see across to Sweden, which is only about a couple of miles, all the lights on, and you\nknew that they were having everything that they used to get. So that kind of makes you realize\nthat there\u2019s really something going on that\u2019s not very good.",
        "A: We were-- no.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, not in our case, no. I\u2019m sure that Jewish people, you know, they were concerned, they\nwould try to get away, but in our case there was no particular reason we should -- you consider\nthat. And in -- during the first World War Denmark was neutral and came through without any\nproblems, so everybody was hoping that it\u2019ll be the same this time.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, in the suburb.",
        "A: Half of what I made.",
        "A: Which wasn\u2019t very much, though.",
        "A: Yeah. I -- I was apprenticed in [indecipherable] three year deals, I will be fin -- that will be\nfinished the end of March in \u201840. And then I wanted to go overseas for f-further training. There\nwas at that time a -- a company in Jamaica called Jamaica Banana Producers Association and\nthat was run by a Danish fellow by the name of List, S.D. List, who was also the Danish consul,\nand I wrote him to try and -- to get involved with that outfit through the consulate. That didn\u2019t\nwork out. Then I tried to work something out with an outfit in Sweden and by the time we were\ngetting all ready to, you know, do something, then we got occupied and I couldn\u2019t get out.",
        "A: Well, it was a three year learning period.",
        "A: Yeah, you went three years and then after that you finished and then you can go get a job\nsomewhere else.",
        "A: No, no, no, that came as a complete surprise.",
        "A: I remember that morning, I was in the navy and we got called out on the parade ground and\nthere were these bombers all over the place, which was -- I mean, the Danish air force didn\u2019t\nhave very many planes, so it was obvious that there was something going on and pretty soon we\nwere just told that the Germans had come in and they had started occupying Copenhagen, and for\nus just to stay in -- in the naval yard and not do anything. So was -- it was -- the officers, they\nwere kind of hard on them.",
        "A: Well, they had, you know, some of them devote their whole life to -- to defend for Denmark\nand then to be told that can\u2019t do anything, that\u2019s not easy.",
        "A: But no, there was -- a number of Danes got killed, unnecessarily, I think, because I think the\ngovernment had pretty good idea what was going to happen. And it was not right for the\ngovernment to expect the soldiers to put up a defense when they knew that there wasn\u2019t a chance\nof being successful.",
        "A: Kind of frustration, I guess. I hadn\u2019t been in that long, I'd in -- only been in for nine days,\nactually. So I hadn\u2019t really -- hadn\u2019t fired a gun yet. But even so, you know, you are -- you are\npri -- it -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s pretty upsetting, a thing like that. Everybody was pretty uptight about it.",
        "A: It just didn\u2019t make any sense, because we \u2014 we had been told that this \u2014 there might be a thing\nlike that happening, and if it did, you know, then there \u2014 there was no purpose in \u2014 in \u2014 in start\nfighting it. We \u2014 if y \u2014 if the country had bombers all over the place, and th-that -- the soldiers\nare coming in, there was -- the Germans were putting soldiers ashore at a number of points.\nDenmark\u2019s a small country. I mean, you can drive from the northernmost point to the\nsouthernmost point in four hours. And you can go from the easternmost point to the westernmost\npoint in about the same, which we happen to do last year, so -- you know, it just isn\u2019t that big.\nAnd it\u2019s -- it\u2019s not like Norway with a lot of mountains and all that stuff, 1t\u2019s pretty flat. The\nhighest point is 180 feet, or something like that. So trying to put up mu-much of a defense when\nyou -- a-against the -- the German army is a -- a pretty hopeless task, I mean, bordering on\nsuicide almost. But even so, though I think most everybody thought at least there should be an\neffort. And it was -- it was kind of disappointing just to sit back, not do anything.",
        "A: When I was in the navy yard in -- in Copenhagen at boot camp, and we just got -- go up in the\nmorning very early, I don\u2019t know, at four o\u2019clock, something like -- like this, because the\nbombers were all over the place there.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: They were just flying around. They were trying to scare everybody.",
        "A: German bombers, yeah. And the -- a German ship was putting soldiers ashore in -- in th --\nright in Copenhagen for that matter, close to the navy yard. And then I had seen a number of\ncourse.",
        "A: We just told that there was nothing we could do, and the king had decided we\u2019re not going to\nfight, and we were just going to stand by and then see -- await developments. So we -- we were\nstaying in the camp for, I guess, about a week befo -- before we were -- permitted outside. Ours\nhad been assigned a ship that was supposed to go to Greenland on the 17\" of May. Remember\nthat day, that\u2019s a Norwegian national day. We were supposed to Greenland on the 17\" of May\nfor inspection and to make sure that foreign fishing trawlers did not start going into green\nterritorial waters, because Greenland is Danish. So we were supposed to go out there and I was\nlooking forward to that, that would have been quite an experience. But instead of that we went to\nsome small port in Denmark and sat there for -- until I got demobbed at the British say, 1-1n\nDecember of \u201940.",
        "A: Dist -- discharged from the military. British used to call it demobbed.",
        "A: Anyway, when I was sent home there, in the middle of December, that was the end of my\nmilitary career. So it was only about eight month, nine month.",
        "A: They have conscription, I got drafted.",
        "A: So you had to put in your time, and I was all set to put in my time there, and I was applying to\ngo to these places after the military service was over with.",
        "A: No, no. That day they stayed outside.",
        "A: No. No, that -- that -- oh, I think that was almost a week before we could do anything. E-Even\ntelephone, or write a letter, an-anything like that.",
        "A: Basically that\u2019s what it was.",
        "A: Well, of course, there were German soldiers all over the place, so it -- it wa -- it was obvious\nthere wa -- it was not -- it had changed. I mean, it wasn\u2019t as nice as it used to be. When you get\noccupied like that, you know, it puts a kind of damp on everything else. The stores closed early.\nThey were running -- already that time there were certain things that were getting short of. So I -\n- | had a bicycle, I bicycled home. Rest of them went back to th -- to the boot camp.",
        "A: Well, of course, they were -- they were happy-- I -- I mean, th-there hadn\u2019t been any fighting\ngo on that I\u2019ve been involved with, actually. But they weren\u2019t too happy about the Germans\nbeing there.",
        "A: Well, I had the uniform on, the navy uniform. They didn\u2019t pay any attention. I mean, there\nwas so many of them and basically so few of us. I think the whole navy was something like, I\ndon\u2019t know, 8,000 -- eight -- 9,000 people, which is not much compared to the German army.",
        "A: No, none whatsoever.",
        "A: Basically yeah, mm-hm.",
        "A: No, in the beginning, everybody was supposed to be -- everything was supposed to be very\nfriendly and they took over some schools, took over some hotels, but not any private houses. Not\nin the beginning.",
        "A: Well, I -- cause all I -- I did was I -- I went out to my parent\u2019s house and spend the time with\nthem, then went back to the camp, so I didn\u2019t get around to talk much to -- to anybody. That time\nthere, the Germans announced that everything was supposed to be pretty much continued\noperating the way it had been, where the police were supposed to be Danish, and the courts were\nsupposed to be Danish, and all that. The basic government was supposed to be Danish, except of\ncourse the foreign office. So they had indicated that was not going to be much change of\nanything, which I suppose to an extent was right in the beginning but it didn\u2019t last very long.",
        "A: The gers -- the Germans started trying to run more and more things, there were more\npropaganda, there were more things in a -- and in the radio. There were commentators that was\nvery much in favor of Germany. Some of the ones that used to be in favor of the British, they\nwere not on the radio any more. Denmark used to be primarily British oriented, one reason being\nthat the -- the biggest trade partner was -- was Britain. The Danish economy was a refining\neconomy in the sense that they brought grain in, and they exported bacon and -- and butter. And\nall that went to -- or almost all had went to England and so relationship between Denmark and\nEngland was very close. Also because royalty-wise there was family-wise between Denmark\nand Sweden and not much from Denmark to Germany.",
        "A: I painted the ship. I think we must have painted our ship 14 times. There wasn\u2019t much else to\ndo, we are lying in this little harbor, you know, and just keep the thing shined up, keep it clean.\nOh, actually, I was only there for part of the time, then I got transferred to -- back to Copenhagen\nand I was working for an admiral, I was doing some office work for him, and then I got\ndemobbed in December, that was the end of that.",
        "A: Ah, yeah.",
        "A: But normally you\u2019ll be in between a year an-and a year and a half.",
        "A: So it was a lot earlier than -- than normal.",
        "A: Just sitting on a ship someplace, you know, there wasn\u2019t -- you didn\u2019t learn anything. And\nthey didn\u2019t need a full crew on a -- on -- on most of the -- the ships, so they just had too many\npeople. So that -- told to go home.",
        "A: In the navy?",
        "A: Well, yeah, but it -- 25 cents a day or whatever it was. It wasn\u2019t very much.",
        "A: No, I wasn\u2019t living home.",
        "A: And then I and I start to look around for a job, and there was one ad in the paper, there was\nthis one steamship company that was looking for a junior clerk so I applied and I found later that\nI was the youngest that applied, and I was the one with the lowest requirements salary-wise, so I\ngot the job. And that was a company called [indecipherable] and that started in January of \u201941,\nand was there until sometime in September, October 43.",
        "A: I was 20 when I started, January of \u201941 I was 20.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: What I see, the work life is entirely different. As far as like the rowing was concerned, it\nstayed the same but the day Germany occupied or started go against the Russia, they prohibited\nrowing in Denmark. I think because they were afraid we would row to Sweden, which could\neasily have been done. But anyway, that took care of -- of all activities over the weekends. And\nthey a -- it was just, you couldn\u2019t go out in the evening, you know, you had to be home before it\ngot dark. There wasn\u2019t much partying going on. If they had a -- if you went to a party, it was an\nall night party. That\u2019s in the summertime, that was kind of nice. That was something else.",
        "A: Weren\u2019t permitted.",
        "A: You weren\u2019t permitted to. And you couldn\u2019t be more than I think like three people meeting in\nthe street, be -- anything beyond that was illegal. Stuff like that.",
        "A: That was probably in \u201940 -- \u00b042, I think. That\u2019s when the -- the illegal papers started coming\nout. We always tried to listen to the British forecast, news 1n the evening, and the -- the illegal\nnewspapers started somewhere around that time, late \u201940 -- \u201941, I think it must have been. So I\nwant to get involved and I -- a friend of my mother was married to a chap that was in the\nnewspaper business. So I went to see him -- went in to see him one day and told him that I was --\nkind of like to get involved with some of that stuff there, and so he hemmed and hawed a little\nbit, he wasn\u2019t going to admit he was involved, but he said why you come back in a week, and so\non. So I came back a week later on, he said okay, here\u2019s a -- a name of a guy, you could go and\ntalk to him. So I went down to see this fellow and he was pretty deep in one of the illegal\nnewspapers. I don\u2019t remember the name, free Danes, what it was. But there was quite a few of\nthem. The students had one, the Communists had one, the Republicans had one. I mean, there\nwere a whole batch of those being published.",
        "A: Oh, they knew me pretty well. I mean, they\u2019d known me for years.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, I told him that I was, you know, where I came from and that I would like to -- to get\ninvolved with some of the stuff and I told him what I -- my background, you know, from the\nnavy, and -- and the steamship company, and all that. And that I was ready to do whatever was,\nyou know, with -- with a newspaper, either distribution or -- or to run copies of it, or whatever\nwas. And he just said well, I'll talk to you one of these days, and then I went home and then a\nfew days later I got word, I had to go -- come back in. And he ha -- must have done a little\nchecking other ways. So I came back in and he said okay, let\u2019s get at it. Then I went somewhere,\nI don\u2019t know where -- I don\u2019t remember where it was, but I went to this address and -- and\nstarted running copies of this paper. And --",
        "A: I guess the fact that I came from the other chap. So then we -- we would run newspapers off,\nand then we would take care of the distribution, and then kind of one -- one thing took you, you\nknow, it -- you get more and more involved, get more and more mad at the Germans. So you get\n-- you get really -- you -- you -- you get pretty satisfied that you think that what you\u2019re doing is\nnot going to change the war, obviously. But at least, under the circumstances, it\u2019s kind of more\nor less the most you can do. You can\u2019t do a heck of a lot more than that, under those\ncircumstances. But that was a beginning. And in those years there wasn\u2019t much sabotage or any\nof that stuff going. That came later.",
        "A: Well, my whole career being ruined by this stuff, in a sense, you know, I mean here I was\ntrying to get to Jamaica or -- or whatever, and th-that\u2019s all ruined because they came in there.\nAnd after all, there wasn\u2019t much reason for the Germans coming in, just the fact that they want to\nbe sure that they would get the Swedish iron ore down along the coast of Norway, and they\nwanted protect a -- protect th-the ships. Didn\u2019t seem to be any particular reason for them to\noccupy Denmark and ruin my career, two of them at the same time. So I just didn\u2019t like it.",
        "A: Oh, somebody\u2019s basement somewhere.",
        "A: No, it was a duplication. Every time around you get one sheet, you know, and there was a lot\nof times around, and then you had to put them together o-on -- you had to take them out and --\nand distribute them. We had to be a little bit careful when you do that, too. But there were var-\nvarious ways you could do that, one was to go into an apartment -- a high-rise, and then start\nfrom the top and leave one paper in front of each door and just run down as fast as you could and\nget out of there, in case there was some Germans living somewhere in an apartment. The other\nthing was driving around on a bicycle, if you see a bunch of people standing, say at a -- say at a\nbus stop, you throw a bunch of papers over there and then you peddle around the corner as fast as\nyou can. That worked pretty good, too. And then, of course there was the steady customers, you\nknow. So, oh, many ways of getting rid of them.",
        "A: No. No, cause you don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s going to see you. I mean, if you run down the stairs\npall mall all the doors are closed. And if you just throw the papers, people are not going to get\nthat much of a chance to really look at you so they can report you, and so no, there wasn\u2019t much\nproblem with that one.",
        "A: No, I never got caught- with the newspapers. In the beginning the Danish poleesh -- police\nwould have pick you up and probably put you in the jail for a week or two. It was illegal to do\nthat stuff, officially it was illegal. You weren't supposed to do that. But it, you know, it wasn\u2019t\nany major crime as such. And at that time, the -- the Germans were not in working as the police,\nor they were not -- didn\u2019t have any judges around. We\u2019re talking about \u00b041 - \u201942, and things got\nhotter after that.",
        "A: Well, then in -- in -- was in f-fort -- I mean in \u00b040 -- kind of hard to remember what happened\nwhat year. The -- the Germans threw the police out that is after I got in court. The Germans\nstarted to get more and more involved, as always, the police. And they started controlling a\nbunch of the courthouses, so if you did get caught, you could get really put in the slammer by the\n-- by the police. Also, the -- I think the Germans insisted the police pick up all the Communists\nand put them in the camps somewhere. And it -- it -- it\u2019s kind of hard to remember what\nhappened, what year that is.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Yeah, everybody had a number of names. And that wa -- that\u2019s the reason people\nnow, ask me do you, you know, whatever, and what was his name during the war, you know --\noh, you know, something entirely different. I don\u2019t remember the names I used, but I know I had\nan I.D. card for several. But that was kind of standard -- standard -- everybody did that.",
        "A: Well, there were -- there were people in official offices, that didn\u2019t like the Germans either,\nand they kind of slid it to you under the table, you know. That was not that difficult to get ahold\nof. You had an I.D. card, you get a driver\u2019s license, you get, you know, most -- you get rationing\nstamps too, which, you needed them that time if you wanted legal -- when you became illegal. So\nyou'd get all these things.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: I\u2019m pretty sure of -- I used Jorgen for awhile. But, I mean, then after the war, right after the\nwar when I came back th-the liberation, then I had different names and different cards. I -- I can\u2019t\ntell you, changing our names, can\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, we never knew whether whether -- particularly, you know, after the German got\nreal hot you never knew whether they knew of one of your names and it might -- if -- if you got\npicked up for something not very important, that might remind them of something that would\nhave been important.",
        "A: The whole thing comes gradual. I mean, that 1-isn\u2019t one day all of a sudden, boom. And th-th-\nthe thing was, everybody was -- was involved all -- no, I shouldn\u2019t say everybody, an awful lot\nof people were involved, get to be more and more all the time. So it was nothing unusual. I\nmean, later on during the war, when I was in jail, my sister was involved with a newspaper, my\nfather contributed, and my mother would feed these fellows. The old system, you know, where\nyou have the plant in the -- in the left side of the window stay away, and the right side of the\nwindow, come on in and eat. So I -- everybody was kind of involved one way or the other, and I\n-- me -- I can\u2019t say th-that this happened this time or that time. I -- I -- that I\u2019d realized of -- how\ndeep it was. It just get deeper and deeper all the time.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I really told them outright, but I\u2019m pretty sure they knew what was going. I mean\nthat -- you didn\u2019t -- you don\u2019t run around and talk much about those things there, to anybody.",
        "A: Well, you don\u2019t really join as a -- as a membership card and all those kinds of things. You just\nkind of get involved, you work with them. I don\u2019t think this newspaper group had any\nmembership roster or anything like that, you know, which would have -- not have been a very\npractical thing in case a German had gotten hold of it.",
        "A: I don\u2019t really remember. I think you kind of worked that out between yourselves, you know,\nthat -- pretty much what area you were going to cover.",
        "A: Well, nights you -- you would talk about the news that was in the -- in the paper that day, and\nother things that you might have heard that hadn\u2019t gotten in the paper yet. You couldn\u2019t have\neverything in the paper, it was just a few mimeographed sheets. And as time went by there were -\n- there were just more and more things happening all the time. So you couldn\u2019t put everything in\nthere, so you would exchange news, what was happening.",
        "A: Well, it started out with the papers.",
        "A: And then in the fall of \u201943, the whole thing came up with the -- with the Germans wanted the\nJews to the camps in Germany.",
        "A: [indecipherable] intelligence that what they want. Anyway, they came up, and that must have\nbeen September, October of \u00b043.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "A: Yeah. And there was a -- a fellow in the German embassy, Dukritch or something like that, he\nwas the shipping attach\u00e9, and he knew about it, and he had told some of the Danish politician\nabout it, and they had passed word out to who the Chief Rabbi was told to -- about it. And of\ncourse that went down the ranks, pretty soon we heard about it and then we started getting --\nhaving the Jews getting away to Sweden. You had -- you had to get out and -- and -- and warn\nthem, and then find out where they were going to be staying because a lot of them moved away\nfrom their own house. And then they would pick them up and take them out in the countryside to\nwhere the fishing boats were.",
        "A: Details, they are somewhat blurred. There was one fellow, he was a doctor, he and his wife,\nthey had one child, and as I recall somebody asked me whether -- whether he had taken off, and I\nsaid, I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ll check him. So I went to see him, and -- and he was still there. So I\nsaid to him, well, you know, you better start moving. So he and his wife and the -- and the kid, I\ntook them to a safe house and then I don\u2019t know if it was that night or the next night, I took them\nout to a small town called Taarbek, that\u2019s on the coast just north of Copenhagen, and got them on\na boat to Sweden. That kind of the way it works. You hear about somebody who is somewhere\nand then you go out there and -- and the amazing thing was that -- I mean, I was what, 22 at that\ntime, 23, and you go out and talk to a -- a family, you never see them before 1n your life, and you\nsay, hey I\u2019m here to -- to help you get away, and they go to -- go with you.",
        "A: No. Well, you know, they were desperate. And I guess that, what was the choice? There was\ngoing to Theresienstadt and that was not that desirable. So when you come there an-and tell\nthem, hey, I'll help you get to Sweden, and they -- they are inclined to go along with you.",
        "A: There were certain taxis we could use and there were certain ambulances. There was a -- there\nwas a Dr. Ole Sager at the hospital who was very involved with all this stuff, and we could also,\nthrough him get an ambulance, and take them out to a safe house. And then in the evening there\nwas certain taxis that were, yo-you know, th-the drivers were considered safe. Then take them --\nget ahold of one of them to take them out to Taarbek, it was called, just north of Copenhagen.\nAnd there was an inn right there, right on the water, right in the harbor, so put them in a -- they\nhad a big meeting room -- ballroom I guess it was, and they would go in there and wait, and then\nduring the night the fisherman decided when they were ready to go, and then you walked them\ndown, you get them on the boat, and they took off.",
        "A: We never loosed one -- lost one.",
        "A: Well, that all depends upon how many boats you had lined up for the night, but you couldn\u2019t\nput that many people on board, I don\u2019t know how many -- how many it was, it was 12 - 15 or\nsomething like that, on the fishing boat, it wasn\u2019t very big. But you might have, you know,\nenough for four or five boat. One time we had the place full and all a -- all of a sudden rumor\nstarted that the Gestapo was coming around. So everybody had to get outside and hide\nsomewhere. There were houses around it, you had to hide in the garden and all that stuff, that\nwas bit of a mess.",
        "A: No, that was false rumors, we go -- we got everybody back 1n the -- in the ho -- inside, and\nthen down on the -- on the fishing boat and they took off then.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t very far.",
        "A: I mean you were in the harbor --",
        "A: -- so you just walk down the pier to where the fishing boat was, and then they go aboard, then\nthey take off. Whenever the- fisherman is ready.",
        "A: [ll be very surprised if they didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Oh yeah. I mean, you know, you have a lot of people running around there 1n the middle of\nthe night when you\u2019re not supposed to be outside. So obviously they know that something is\ncooking. And a lot of the fishermen lived there, so naturally their families would know about it.",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.",
        "A: I ope --",
        "A: No, I was just going to say there were -- had -- so happened that the people I was working\nwith used this port at Taarbek. There were other people who used ports south of Copenhagen.\nThere were some using ports north of -- there was one port north of Copenhagen called Gilleleje\nand one time they had several Jews hidden in the -- in the church, and somehow or the other the\nGestapo found out, and picked them all up, and they all wound up in -- I think they all went to\nTheresienstadt. But that was one of the few times anybody were lost. One time we were just up\naround Elsinore, and we were helping some people over and the Germans came and they started\nshooting, and one guy, he was a policeman, Larsen I think his name was, hit him in the stomach,\nwhich is pretty miserable. So I wasn\u2019t involved with that, they got him down to -- to the hospital\nwhere Hulsaker was and they operated on him and they shipped him to Sweden the next evening\nto a hospital an-and he came through okay.",
        "A: Mm-hm, yeah.",
        "A: I went over three times. The first time I was told to go because somehow or the other they\nsaid that -- that somebody in -- in -- in the Germans I ha -- knew I was involved with the stuff, so\nthey said, you better get over to Sweden for awhile, lay low. So I went on a boat, and we went\nabout halfway across to Sweden, and then there was the Swedish fishing boat. And the two of\nthem went alongside, and we climbed over in the Swedish fishing boat and then went over to\nSweden. So --",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: From one fishing boat they were -- they were right next to each other.",
        "A: They go slow ahead you know, so --",
        "A: No, that wasn\u2019t any problem. That was one time. Another time I went over there, there was a\nbrewery in a small town, Elsinore, that\u2019s Hamlet\u2019s Castle, called Wiibroe, and they had an\narrangement with a boat that would go from Copenhagen to Elsinore, which is something like 20\nmiles, with empty beer bottles and cases. Well, they would leave a room in the middle of the --\nof the hold, so you would hide down there. And the time I -- I forgot the reason, I had to get over\nthere, was something I had to bring over and there was a couple with a baby that was going on\nthe same one. And th-the baby had gotten a shot, you know, of -- to be sure it was quiet, because\nwhen you get down there, then they put beer bo -- case with beer bottles all the way around, and\nthen the -- before the ship could leave Copenhagen the German harbor patrol er-whatever it was,\nwill come down as a matter of order and just check the ship out. So you could hear them walking\naround on the deck. And then we took off, and we got out on the sound and then the same thing\nalongside the Swedish fishing boat, and they take some of the beer cases away, and so you get\nout.",
        "A: I have no idea. There was a -- there was a doctor they had. But that was something there- to\ncalm her down you know, it wouldn\u2019t make any -- 1t wouldn\u2019t make her cry or anything like that.",
        "A: That wa -- that was one of the three scariest moments I -- I had during the war. I-It\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nscary. You know, you -- you don\u2019t want to do that too often. But we were lucky the baby stayed\nquiet, and -- and so we got off in good shape.",
        "A: Oh, the second time was -- well that was actually after I had been caught by the Gestapo had\nbeen in the jail for awhile, they were going to bring us down to Germany, they stopped -- they\nstopped the car somewhere, there were 13 of us in the -- in this truck. And you sit there, you\nhandcuffed with your -- in the back and you have a -- a wire going through so nobody get\nanywhere. So they went from Copenhagen down to [indecipherable] over the ferry to the island\nFunen and then we went a piece on this blacktop and then you could feel that you were going on\na -- on a dirt road. And then they stopped and they told us to get out, they took the -- the\nhandcuffs off and said, time to relieve yourself. So you stand there doing your thing and we\nknew that shortly before that the Germans -- the Gestapo had taken a bunch of fellows from the\ncamp out somewhere in the northern part of Zealand\nand they shot them all. So when you\u2019re do -- standing there doing that thing, one of the German\nsoldiers fired a -- a salvo, this machine pistol there. That was pretty scary. But he just fired in the\nair, you know, for the fun of it, or whatever, so -- and the third time was another time I\u2019d been in\nSweden, I came back to Copenhagen in an afternoon, and that was my own stupidity. I had\nbought a copy of the London Times, and I had that in my briefcase, and I was sitting the\nstreetcar, and through one end of the streetcar come these German soldiers and start -- want to\ncheck everybody\u2019s briefcase. Fortunately, before they got to me they stopped and they got off\nand went somewhere else. But that was -- I -- I was very scared, I -- I'll admit that.",
        "A: I -- I think so, yeah. Y-You don\u2019t really get that used to it.",
        "A: \u00b043 --",
        "A: Fall of \u201943.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You don\u2019t get much sleep, that\u2019s one thing. And they had some kind of pill, I don\u2019t remember\nthe name of it, that I -- could keep you going for a long time. But usually, after two nights\nwithout hardly any sleep, then you had to have one night. The company I work for, I -- I worked\now -- a lot of times I -- I didn\u2019t show up, but they -- I think the boss knew very well what was\ngoing on -- he didn\u2019t ask me, I didn\u2019t tell him, but I think he knew what was happening. So then\nafter, you know, two -- two or three weeks, then it started easing off, and -- and you wouldn\u2019t be\non every night any more.",
        "A: Well, you know, you -- you -- you -- you talk to these people all the time. Whether they\nspecifically said -- I -- I -- I don\u2019t remember. I just don\u2019t remember now. I -- I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s a\nlong time ago, you know, and I tried lot of things in between, so some of them -- those things in\nthat time, you know, they kind of -- ve forgotten about them.",
        "A: Oh, I suppose some of the fellows or the girls I worked with, you know, they kind of respect\neach other. There were a couple of fellows that were really out -- there was one girl that was\noutstanding, that I knew quite well.",
        "A: The girl\u2019s name was Jette Hec Johansson, she was quite well known, she was a great girl. And\nthe fellows, oh God, what was their names? Hec Johan -- Hed I remember her name because I\nmet her, oh what, 10 years ago at a reception in Copenhagen the queen had. And Jette was\ninvited and I was there, and so I happened to see her, and I hadn\u2019t seen her for so long, I went\nover to say, You\u2019re Jette, aren\u2019t you? That was it. So we had a -- a great reunion. Yeah, she was a\nwonderful person. So that was -- that was a bunch of -- of nice g -- nice people, you know,\nreliable.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, there wasn\u2019t any of that stuff. I guess there wasn\u2019t really time for that. Besides that\nanything organized, you want to stay clear of.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: Oh, absolutely, you don\u2019t want to get involved with that.",
        "A: Well, Germans have -- the Gestapo had a way of convincing people to talk, and if they got\nahold of one fellow in an organized thing like that, you know, they could kind of find out the\nnames of a bunch of other people. That\u2019s the reason from one group to the other, you didn\u2019t\nknow many people you know, who -- certainly didn\u2019t know the names. And there were usually\none, maybe yo -- one fellow in your group would know one fellow in the other group. And that\u2019s\nthe way you do the communications. Then th -- later on, you know, what -- when -- after I got\ncaught and sent and things got more organized, and I don\u2019t know what -- how it was done in that\ntime. But that was -- that was after the summer of \u00b044.",
        "A: No. No, I never thought about that.",
        "A: Very, very, very few did. I mean, there wasn\u2019t anybody around where I lived that knew, as far\nas I know. I never asked anybody af-after the war.",
        "A: Well, yeah, I helped one policeman wanted to get to Sweden one time, Danish policeman, he\nhad gotten in trouble, so I -- I help him over. But that was about the only time I was involved,\nwas really involved in anything.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s absolutely right.",
        "A: As a matter of fact, on occasion they helped.",
        "A: No, just what I\u2019ve heard.",
        "A: But poli -- police no -- was not very friendly toward the -- toward the Germans. And after the\nwar I met a fellow who was in the police at that time, and he was telling me things that was\ngoing on that showed the police was -- a lot of times was in -- in a sense against the Germans.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. I think what they -- what they probably did when they got to Sweden, they were th -- I\nthink there was some kind of a -- an organization over there that took care -- I mean, you know,\nyou get over there with a couple of kids, you don\u2019t know anybody, you have no money, so\nsomebody got to look after you. And there was some organizations over there, both Swedish\nJews, and -- and Danish Jews who had escaped and -- and look after them.",
        "A: I never paid a fisherman, for one thing. There are stories that some fishermen got paid\nbecause they risked their boat, but I never heard of anybody, seen anybody do it. The ambulance,\nof course, we didn\u2019t pay them. Taxis, most of the time we didn\u2019t pay them either, cause they\nwere kind of part of the whole thing. Where you get money from -- you never use any. I didn\u2019t\nuse any. In those -- in those days I lived at home, and I got the salary for most of the time, even if\nI didn\u2019t show up. He was very nice about it. So -- no, I -- I -- I don\u2019t really know who -- who did\nthat.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "A: Well, of course, a lot of those fellows didn\u2019t like the Germans either, so they were all -- that\nwas one of the reasons for it. And then the other thing 1s basically that this really wasn\u2019t so much\no-of Jews or not Jews, or whatever. They were -- it was maybe because they were, you know,\nDanish citizens, they were just like the rest of us, you know, and all of a sudden the Germans --\nif they had been going after the red haired, it would have been the same thing, probably. It just\nhappened that the Germans went after Jews, so then you help the Jews get off -- they wer --\nescape.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yep. Oh yeah, no, it wasn\u2019t because they were Jews. And then of course, as time went on,\nthere were other than Jews that -- that had to get to Sweden. After -- after that fall of \u00b043 --",
        "A: No, no, there were others, than Jews. I mean, there were -- there were like allied bombers\nwho\u2019d be shot down over Denmark, and then their crew had to be helped to get over to -- to\nSweden. A classmate of mine, Billy Talbotsa was flying for the Royal Air Force, and he got shot\ndown over Denmark, and he managed to get his way to Elsinore and they put him on a kayak.\nUnfortunately, he -- he didn\u2019t make it across, he drowned. But many others got over there. Also\nthere were parachute agents that had to get back. Niels Bohr you know, there was one guy that\ncame over illegally to Sweden on a fishing boat and then wound up at the Manhattan Project.\nHow in the hell where is- Las Cruces New Mexico. Poli -- certain Danish politicians, wound up\nin England for BBC. So, there were many others than just Jews that were shipped.",
        "A: No, not really, because I didn\u2019t know who was, you know, the big mucky-mucks. They had\nthe Danish Freedom Council, but that was very secret, and I don\u2019t think anybo -- anybody knew\nwho was on -- at that thing. [indecipherable] Jacobsen was one, they come out after the war.\nThere was -- there were a -- there was -- I think there were a couple of doctors on that, one or\ntwo politicians. But no, there was -- there wasn\u2019t really much mentioning of names. It was just\ntoo dangerous. Wouldn\u2019t do any good.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Yeah, there was -- I don\u2019t think there was any doubt that there were a lot of people, lot of\npeople involved many different ways.",
        "A: We had that too.",
        "A: That was one of the things that the resistance movement did was eliminate some of those\npeople. There were a number of them got -- got -- got shot. One guy who reported me into\nGestapo, that\u2019s the reason I got caught, and he got eliminated. So that happened to a number --",
        "A: No. No I never knew his name.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know who he was, I never talked to him, but I heard\nafterwards that he was the one that had reported to Gestapo that we were -- we -- we were\nmeeting in this particular place with the -- with the parachute agent.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Parabellum it was called. I don\u2019t remember whether it was made -- I think it was Belgium\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: Inside the jacket.",
        "A: But not all the time, you know, only when you -- when you had -- on a job.",
        "A: We didn't use very many, so no, I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t recall that. You didn\u2019t use it very much very\nseldom you had to -- I think that was only once or twice I had occasion to use it. You want to\navoid that as much as possible.",
        "A: Oh, there was one time some guy had got the idea that there was a -- a depot out somewhere\nthat was just absolutely full of -- full of weapons, and there wasn\u2019t many Germans taking care --\nlooking after -- guarding it. And there was like a small hill and up on top there was a fellow\nsitting with a machine gun. And then there were a couple of guys walking around inside of the\nfence. So the way it was set up, we had a friend of mine worked for -- for a brewery, so I had\narranged for us to borrow a couple of trucks. So we drove out there this morning, and the wa --\none guy had a rifle, and he was supposed to shoot the guy on top. And I had to get the rifle out to\nhim, which is kind of hard when you -- on a bicycle kind of hard to hide= So I borrowed a -- a\nrake and a spade, whatever it was, and then tied it on the bike and put the gun the middle of the\nburlap around it and took out the -- anyway, he was supposed to shoot the guy on top, and he\nmissed. The meantime we drive up alongside, we show -- throw the tarp over the barbed wire\nand jump inside. And -- but since he didn\u2019t get the guy up on top -- he was sitting up there with a\nmachine gun and he was doing a lot of shooting, so we got back over the f -- over the fence and\nran away. It was just -- you -- you couldn\u2019t. When you -- you have a revolver, you don\u2019t start\nfighting with machine guns, your odds are against you.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, we could always use some more.",

        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Was a -- a lot of parachuting down of the allies. And then they also, they -- they started\nbuilding some over there, making some, you know, manufacturing some. They were primarily,\nthey were -- they were parachuted down.",
        "A: There was -- there was this -- this girl out there, she had been reporting in, and so we were out\nthere, we were trying to eliminate her, but there were too many -- too many Gestapo people\nshowed up, so we had to forget about that one. There was a little shooting going on, but not very\nmuch.",
        "A: Shooting.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, she got taken care of. I don\u2019t remember her name either. I probably didn\u2019t know her\nright name anyway, So --",
        "A: No, no, she was -- she was telling the Germans about not our group, but some other people --",
        "A: -- she had been reporting on [indecipherable] and then some might have been arrested and it\nwas her fault.",
        "A: That came from upstairs.",
        "A: I mean, well --",
        "A: The Freedom Council.",
        "A: Or close to that. Or close to that.",
        "A: Close to that. There was also the -- the freedom no the -- the parachute people. They had a\nnumber one man there Flemming Muse. And he -- I think he had authority to do that. Then the --\nthe communists had a rather large group called BOPA --",
        "A: -- and known as the Borgelige Partisaner.",
        "A: And they had [indecipherable] part of that [indecipherable]",
        "A: And they -- they had, you know, could decide things like that, that\u2019s how prized they are.",
        "A: Well, I -- I don\u2019t know how it came down, I only know that these people I was with at that\ntime, his name was [indecipherable] I think it was, and he had gotten word. How he got it, who\nhe got it from, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: No, In -- I never did any blowing up and such. I was a guard at some of -- yo-you always had\npeople standing around, watching and I was involved with that, but I didn\u2019t handle the\nexplosives, or -- didn\u2019t like the smell of it, for one thing. They smell like marzipan.",
        "A: Marzipan.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, we were -- actually, when I got caught we had just gotten a new shipment of -- of\nbombs parachuted down, they were not very big, but th -- the purpose was to put them under the\nGerman trucks because they were short of rubber, and they had a hard time getting tires. So if\nyou could blow their tires to pieces, you know, they couldn\u2019t drive their trucks around. So all you\nhad to do is put these things underneath the -- the tire, then when the -- th-the car-drove off, it\nwould blow the tire up. You will be 40 miles from there in the meantime. So we\u2019d just gotten\nthese -- a shipment down of that, and I was with, I think there were four, maybe five. One was a\nparachute agent, and he was showing us how to operate, how to use them and all that. But then\nthe -- the door busted open and in came the Gestapo with a machine gun, and all that stuff, and\nyou\u2019re told to hit the -- the floor. He ate the special agent\u2019s pill, and he died right there\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: A minute? It was almost instantaneous. A minute, two minute. So we never got to use those,\nbut they were used pri -- a little afterwards, those tire bombers. They\u2019re only about this big.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Oh, I think he probably had heard what the Germans were inclined to do to parachute people.\nThey were pretty hard on them. So he is buried in Copenhagen.",
        "A: Robert Johansson I think it was. Robert Johansson. Nice guy. Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t remember. It wasn\u2019t that long, he hadn\u2019t been there that long, I don\u2019t think. I\nhadn\u2019t known him that long, at least.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well, you know, you know that they had this pill.",
        "A: But I suppose it was up to each individual whether he want to -- to take it or not.",
        "A: Well, we were the -- I forgot whether three or four -- anyway, we were taken to the place\nwhere they did their interrogation, place called the Shell house, used to belong to the old oil -- to\nthe oil company. And then they started the --",
        "A: Shell Oil Company, yeah. Germans had taken -- Gestapo had taken that house over, and used\nfor their headquarters, and they did a lot of their interrogation in that one. So, we spent some\ntime in there, and I can do without that that wasn\u2019t very nice. There was a fellow from the\nsouthern part of Denmark, spoke both Danish and German, and he would kind of switch you\nback and forth. So after that was over, I was -- I was sent out to the -- the jail in Copenhagen.\nAnd had my own cell there, and then they would -- a couple of days I was pulled out and sent\nback in to the Shell House for a little more --",
        "A: Oh, they kind of hit you with a -- I don\u2019t -- rubber thing, about that -- like a nightstick, but all\nrubber, hit you over your kidneys, which 1s all uncomfortable. And then, you know, hit you other\nplaces, and kick you a little. Right to the jaw, left to the jaw, whatever they feel like. They\u2019 re\nthey\u2019re - just not very nice.",
        "A: Well, 1 -- you really don\u2019t keep check on the time. I mean, you just hope it\u2019s gonna be over\nwith. But I forgot th -- what -- in there four or five times, something like that. And otherwise you\nsit out yourself, by yourself. So -- and that went on for -- I guess I was in that jail for a month.\nAnd then they came there one morning, I don\u2019t know, three o\u2019clock, told me to get dressed \u2014get\nmy gear. We went out, got in a bus -- a-a -- this truck, then they took us down. And they took us\ndown to just over the border, place called Flensburg and there were 13 of us, and that -- put us in\nthe jail there for -- oh, I don\u2019t know, two or three days. And then they took us by bus to Hamburg\nto the jail and we were just there one day. And then they took us down to the concentration\ncamp. And then it was strange because normally when you come down there, you get, you know,\nyour prison number at that time was somewhere in the 50 - 60 thousands. Ours was 500, and that\nwas because the 13 numbers were what they called politsi haftling. That means you are under\narrest, but your sentence has not been determined yet. So, we were politsi haftling until\nsomewhere around Christmas, and then we became Just a -- a normal, regular prisoner. But in the\nmeantime, that helped me because one time my name was on a list, I was told, I forgot, but\nanyway, I found out that I was supposed to be transferred to one of the work camps, which they\nwere building these trenches so the allied tanks couldn\u2019t get in. So you walk around in this water\nup to your knees or whatever. You never get dry clothes on, and it\u2019s cold, it was in the\nwintertime. So the fellows there usually didn\u2019t last very long. So I heard I\u2019d been transferred\nthere once, I didn\u2019t like that, so I got permission to go up to the camp office, and I said to the\nclerk up there that I was politsi haftling, which means I had to be -- available again -- in -- in\ncase Gestapo wanted me back and maybe he better not ship me off cause he could wind up and\nget in trouble. So he agreed, so he took me off the list, then some other poor bugger got on the\nlist there. Then I really got transferred. But the reason for that was that one of the 13 had found\nout afterwards- said we had been sentenced to be hanged, and somehow or other the -- the\ninstruction got lost, and that\u2019s the reason why we got into the camp, we got this strange number.\nThe sentence had actually had been pronounced.",
        "A: Neuengamme.",
        "A: No, no. We didn\u2019t know -- really know anything about concentration camps then. There had\nbeen some talk that there were camps like that somewhere around, and that was for anti-socials.\nThey had various marks, they had purple, they had red, they had green triangles on your -- on\nyour uniform. They had one camp [indecipherable] Denmark for political prisoners, that wasn\u2019t\ntoo bad, actually, I understand. But the ones down in Germany that -- that didn\u2019t get much\npublicity that time. After the war, I think that\u2019s when a lot was written about it.",
        "A: Germany.",
        "A: Just outside of Hamburg.",
        "A: You mean to help people get to Sweden?",
        "A: Well, you know, Denmark had been independent since, I don\u2019t know, a thousand years. Never\nbeen occupied. And then, naturally when somebody comes in like that, it\u2019s going to cause\nresentment and everything else. So it gets to the point anything you can do that can be anti-\nGerman, whether it was help people get to Sweden, whether it was blow a railroad car in the air,\nwhether it was put a bomb on a ship so it would sink, whether it was publish papers, whatever it\nwas. Anything that was kind of anti-German, people will be in favor of. 99 percent, I think, of\nthe people.",
        "A: Well, because there always gonna be some who just sit back and watch life go by, and then\nthere\u2019s a certain percentage that will be in favor of the -- of the Germans. A part of that could be\npeople who lived in a part of Denmark that had been German f-from 1864 to 1920. And y-yeah,\nthat was [indecipherable] you could understand kind of, in a way, that -- that there were -- there\nwere certain reasons. But a lot of the other one no, there was no excuse for them, and they really\ngot taken care of after the war, I mean, they were -- lot of them went up in jail for simply being\ntoo nice to the Germans.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: He was a pretty good guy. He used to ride around every day, and his son was A-one too. They\nwere -- you have to have something to hang on to. And politicians are not the real ones. Look at\npoliticians in France, Laval, P\u00e9tain, I mean they -- Laval got hanged, I think, P\u00e9tain wasn\u2019t -- or\nalmost 100- so he got away. But I mean, there was nothing there we had to look up to Belgium,\nthe -- the king gave up there, Leopold, he wasn\u2019t considered much of anything. But in Holland\nand Norway, king and queen took off for England and formed exile -- exile governments. They\ndidn\u2019t have any in Denmark, exile government in -- in the -- in the -- the allied countries, which\nwas a bit of a handicap in the beginning. But the -- the king proved to be pretty good anti-\nGerman, although his wife was German. But I think he was -- he was very good.",
        "A: It was known from already before the war that he wasn\u2019t much in favor of them. I mean, he\ngot a -- he turned 70 -- yeah, he turned 70 in -- in 1940, and he got a very elaborate\ncongratulation telegram from Hitler, and he answered, thanks. Hitler got all teed off. That\u2019s not\nhow you thank the -- the fuehrer, just by one word. So it -- it was pretty well known that he\nwasn\u2019t much in favor of -- of the Germans.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Was just -- he wore an officer uniform, and he just rode. Was a red light, he stopped, wait\nuntil it turned green. He was very good. And his son the crown prince was trained in the navy,\nwhich of course made him much better as far as I was concerned. But he was pretty good guy,\ntoo.\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "A: The one specific thing was after I went to Sweden in the fall of \u201944 -- no, fall of \u201943, I didn\u2019t\nsee my parents until after the war was over, except once. I was in a streetcar and I saw my\nmother standing, waiting for another one. And it was difficult not to get off and say hi. At that\ntime I hadn\u2019t seen her for about a year, and it would be another year before I saw her again.",
        "A: Cause she didn\u2019t know where I was, supposedly. She didn\u2019t know I was back in Denmark, she\nthought I was in Sweden.",
        "A: I went to Sweden in -- after the -- after we had helped the Jews get over at the tail end of, of\nthat one which was in the f-fall of \u201943. And then when I was over there I was working in a -- ina\nlumber camp for awhile, and then I -- I sent a letter to the British embassy in -- in Stockholm. I\nvolunteered for service in -- in the British forces, and I got a letter back asking me to come up for\nthis script, so I flew u -- I -- I took the train up there and -- and met the people in the -- in the\nembassy, and -- and the problem was that it would take, oh, I forgot, six months before there\nwould be room. They only had, that time, I think room for one or so every night, the flying a\nMosquito bomber back and forth. So I figured he -- by the time the war\u2019s over, it\u2019Il be too late to\ndo anything, so I went -- I went back to Denmark, and went back at the re -- the resistance stuff.\nAnd then I went -- twice more, I went over illegally to Sweden for whatever reason there was --\nsomebody had to get over there, and some had to -- had hotel some -- whatever. So I went over\nthere twice more and came back. So I was over -- all told, I was over there three times, back and\nforth.",
        "A: No. No, she didn\u2019t. That must have been in the spring of \u201944, yeah, spring of 44.",
        "A: She thought I was in Sweden.",
        "A: No. No, but it was -- you know, you\u2019re in the street car, there\u2019s a lot of people and seeing one\nface out of many, she just didn't catch a glimpse of me. And I didn\u2019t want to call her, cause I\ndidn\u2019t want to cause any -- cau-cause her to get nervous or anything like that. If she figured I was\nin Sweden, she would figure I was, you know, safe and all that. So that\u2019s when I got caught; she\nfound out shortly after. Obviously she got kind of upset, so did my father. But then their -- when\nI -- when the war was over -- well okay, anyway, that\u2019s --",
        "A: I was living at a house Lupine (Lupinvej) number nine that belonged to a Jewish family that\nhad taken off for Sweden. After I got caught, that was myself in the house and a young student,\nand when I got caught, the next day the Germans went out and blew the house up. Unfortunately,\nthey didn't tell the student, and he was sleeping upstairs. And in his bed he went through the\nwindow, out on the front lawn, still in his bed, without a scratch. That\u2019s rather unusual. Anyway,\nthe house was completely knee high. I\u2019m -- I -- I saw the people after the war, and they rebuild,\nand of course government paid for everything, so there wasn\u2019t any financial loss as far as they\nwere concerned.",
        "A: Well, when I got caught, and I got out to sh -- to Shell house and the fellow said my name --\nby that time it was too late to try to hide it. So I said what do you want, so he said oh, Steen, we\nbeen looking for you. Well, they may say that to everybody, just to try to scare you a little bit,\nbut anyway, it di -- it does kind of make you a little nervous. Whether they really did or not, I\ndon\u2019t know.",
        "A: Well, you -- you c -- you got to admit to something. You can\u2019t just say that you -- you haven\u2019t\ndone anything. So you admit to as little as you think you can get by with. And then hope that\nthey\u2019re -- they\u2019re gonna buy it. Furthermore, they had -- they were -- they -- they -- they arrested\na lot of people at that time, so they were pretty busy, these fella -- these policeman that\ninterrogated you. And they couldn\u2019t spend that much time on you, so unless they got something\nout of you fairly soon in the game, they just usually shipped you down south and leave you there.",
        "A: Somebu -- some with the -- with the papers, and there was one other thing, now what the hell\nwas that? There was one other thing, and I got by with that. It was something in connection with\nthe -- with this -- this parachute guy, cause they kind of tied it in. And he was dead, so he\ncouldn\u2019t say anything.",
        "A: Yeah, we had bombs in the -- in the apartment.",
        "A: Oh yeah, with those little ones.",
        "A: Well, this was with the tires. You -- you put them under the -- the German trucks and then\nwhen they -- when they drive over them they blow up and the tire\u2019s completely ruined. You\nknow, it\u2019s not as exciting as blowing up a factory, anything like that, but they had problem\ngetting enough tires for the trucks, so it was helpful.",
        "A: Well, you -- you try to do it when it\u2019s dark. You\u2019d go on -- on the -- on the -- you would go a\nbicycle if you have the proper lights. And you could go until, I forgot what it was, 11 o\u2019clock in\nthe evening there. So you could drive around, then if you saw one somewhere, you could just\nstop and stick one underneath and then peddle along.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct. When you found one you went after.",
        "A: No. That wouldn\u2019t have done any good anyway, except if -- you would probably put another\none underneath them, but no, we didn\u2019t.",

        "A: I don\u2019t -- I -- well, you know, with -- with those things, first of all, you never know when they\ngo off. You can put it underneath and it -- it may misfire.

And I didn\u2019t\nhave any place to stay that night so I called the Palm up in Helsingborg and he said -- he called\nme back shortly after, he said, well, the drunk tank is open tonight if you want it. So I went in\nthere and slept in a padded cell that night only time I ever been in one of those. But they were\nvery -- the Swedes were very good about everything, very helpful and did what they could.",
        "A: No. No, just 0 -- what had to go. You didn\u2019t have that much room, so you just took what you\nhad to take, had to bring over.",
        "A: No. No, the only thing I brought was that newspaper, British newspaper, which I shouldn\u2019t\nhave done. I only did that once.",
        "A: You wouldn\u2019t talk to them, for one thing. And the other thing, they were -- they were running\naround on the -- you know, they were walking around on the street, and -- and you don\u2019t do\nanything special. I mean, you don\u2019t want to stand out in any way. Some -- some fellows tried to\njust stop them and -- and take their guns, you know, steal their gun, things like that, but that\ndidn\u2019t always work so well. They got caught, and then they were in trouble. And there was too\nmuch of a risk just for a gun. Wasn\u2019t worth it.",
        "A: Well, yeah. You al -- al y -- you always worry about it, of course. Also, because there were\nthese people who would -- they would report people who were in the resistance to the Germans.\nSo you never know whether somebody like reported you in, and you know, you were likely to\nget picked up. That was one -- one thing you -- you kind of lived with. And that was about the\nhardest one of them all, because it\u2019s kind of a 24 hour a day proposition.",
        "A: Not offhand.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Oh take -- have the Germans lose. I mean, everybody was hoping for that, and after the --\nafter the inva -- I was still out when the invasion happened, and after that started -- that -- that\ncame about, you know, then there didn\u2019t seem to be much doubt who was going to win. And\nafter the invasion -- the German police got more difficult, was more active.",
        "A: There was more active.",
        "A: Particularly Gestapo fellows. So anyway, I mean, everybody -- everybody I think wa -- was\nconvinced that the allied was going to win.",

        "A: Yeah.",

So you\u2019re down there, you\u2019re -- you don\u2019t argue when they come in, you know,\nwith a bunch of guns like that pointing at you, you just go ahead, and cooperate, do what they tell\nyou to do. So you get down on the floor and then pretty soon you -- you get the handcuffs. And\nthen the -- this was on the fifth floor, I think, in that apartment. Take you down, put you in a -- in\na truck and take you to that Shell house for interrogation.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what happened to him. He was still lying on the floor when -- when I left. He is\nburied in the national cemetery over there now.",
        "A: Oh, couple, three weeks. Couple of weeks, probably. Maybe three.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Only that fellow that came with food.",
        "A: Then after couple of weeks, another fellow came in, another prisoner come in, so we shared\nthe cell for the last -- I think I was there probably four weeks in that jail, so the last two weeks\nthere were two of us. I forgot -- I think he went -- he went to -- he went to Neuengamme too. He\nwas a baker.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. I mean, you al -- you always hope you\u2019re not gonna you're not going to get caught, but\nno I don\u2019t think you sit down and say, well if I\u2019m gonna get caught, I\u2019m gonna do so and so,\nthink so and so, you don\u2019t do that. I think it\u2019s simply too scary a thought.",
        "A: And you se -- oh, oh, excuse me, but during that period, all the time the -- the Germans would\nshoot -- execute people, there was one innkeeper, he got caught because he and his family had\nbeen receiving some weapons parachuted down. And so he got shot, and I think he had two sons\nand a son-in-law, all -- all of them got shot at the same time. One of the kids was only 16 or 17.\nBut they were all executed. And the Germans would regularly execute people from the\nresistance, and they announced it in the -- in the paper, so it was no secret.",
        "A: That is something that I will never know. They had to yo -- I mean, we were supposed to -- to\nget hanged, I was supposed to -- to -- supposedly sentenced to that, and this -- that happened on\nthe way. Why they did that I don\u2019t know it -- it -- I know one -- one of the 13 after the war met a\nguy, a German policeman -- shortly after the war, you know, and this fellow said to him, are you\nstill alive? This chap said, what do you mean by that? He said, Well, we heard you were gone\ndown Neuengamme he sent message that you were -- supposed to hang you down there. And I\nnever -- nothing ever -- and they used to hang people regularly down there. One time they -- they\nhanged eight Polish girls at one slot -- one time.",
        "A: No, Pol-Polish.",
        "A: Polish girls. Yeah. Well, the fellow who was the head of the camp got hanged himself\neventually, after the war.",
        "A: The first thing that you do is they take all your clothes. Then they shave you, anyplace they\ncan find, and -- and then you get some clothes that doesn\u2019t fit you very well. I wound up with a --\nwith a winter coat that was -- that wa -- must have been like from Poland because it was very\nthick material and there was like cotton in the middle. And it was nice and warm, but during\nthese long nights when we had these appelles, you stand out there for parade, and you were\nstanding out there for four, five or six hours until -- they had to count everybody, there were\n20,000 roughly, in the camp. And y -- if they only counted 19,999, we just stood there until they\nfound the last one. So at least the coat were nice and warm for that. So after they -- they put --\ngive you some clothes, then you\u2019re sent over to some barrack somewhere, and then you had to\nfind a place. There were usually oh, three guys to a bunk.",

        "A: Homosexual. So I was out, no time flat. Then we worked -- I think they woke us up at six.\nOh, there\u2019s been a lot written about that, you know, in -- people with better memory than mine.",
        "A: The whole police force wound up there for awhile. All the Dane --",
        "A: Yeah, all the Danish policemen. They were there for awhile, then they got shipped to another\ncamp. My godparent\u2019s son was down there in the same place. I didn\u2019t even know he was -- been\npicked up, but I met him down there one time. So there were some other Danes, but the Danes\nwere all in -- in a number of different camps, they were not all in Neuengamme.",
        "A: No, but you were assigned to a barrack and you couldn\u2019t start running from one to the other.\nBe -- try to meet them when you can, you know. You had Sunday afternoon off, I think.",
        "A: Work.",
        "A: In the beginning we were keeping some -- they had some -- some -- two big buildings built o-\nof brick, and that\u2019s -- was meant originally as barracks for the -- th-the guards. Then later on they\nmoved the guards outside and then these were used for prisoners. But the basement was used for\n-- in -- in case of air raids. Not to protect the prisoners, but to make sure that in case a bomb hit\nsomeplace the prisoners couldn\u2019t run away. So our assignment for awhile was to keep them\nclean. Then for -- I was switched over one time to make some kind of machinery for volk -- for -\n- they had a -- a gun down there that the -- the home guard was using, supposedly more\ndangerous to be the guy f-firing it than the fellow who was in front of it, cause they blew up all\nthe time. And we were making some kind of a part to that Volksgewehr thing. And then -- oh\nthen I got jaundice, and -- and dysentery and went in -- in hospital and then the war was over.",
        "A: There were Belgium, Holland, Polish, Russian. I got pretty friendly with a guy from Urkutsk,\nthat\u2019s way out in Siberia somewhere. I said Polish, and then there was some Czechs, and no\nItalians, no Norwegians that I know of, they were in another camp. But there were all told,\nroughly 20,000 there, and about on average 2,000 died every month.",
        "A: Well, you -- you hear this from the camp office, you know. I mean, there was a -- a f -- couple\no-of prisoners work in the camp office, and they were the one that wo -- w -- ha -- have access to\ninformation such as that.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know it specifically Jews, no. I don\u2019t think so. Ours w-were mostly political prisoners\nwhich was the red triangle. The green triangle was -- I think yellow was -- was -- was criminal,\nand there was some religious prisoners down there, because everybody had a sign on them. I had\n-- like I had a red D, for Danish political, and 67399.",
        "A: That was my number, yeah, after I got out of that politsi haftling.",
        "A: 67399, yeah.",
        "A: Some of the prisoners that had been there the longest was what they call camp, kind of camp\npolice kapo -- k-a-p-o, kapos. The kapo we had was a Polish guy. He\u2019d been there -- God, he\u2019d\nbeen there a long time, and he was supposed to kind of keep -- keep order in this barracks and\nmake sure everything worked out okay. He had a lot of authority from the -- from the Gestapo\npeople.",
        "A: He wasn\u2019t as bad as the Gestapo, but he was not a very friendly sort. It wasn\u2019t very easy for\nhim either probably because each -- I imagine each barrack had at least a thousand prisoners. So\nhe had to keep all that in order, and you know, had -- that\u2019s kind of a tall order, cause a I-lot of\nthem are pretty rough characters.",
        "A: It was usually done Sunday -- see, Sunday we only worked half a day. So there we had the\nappelle, the counting in the morning and then on Sunday at 12 o\u2019clock. Regular days it would be\nin the morning and then again at six, at -- at a -- when work finished. But on Saturdays after the\nappelle was worked out they would hang them before we were excused from so we go back to\nour camp. Although the -- the Polish girls, they were hanged in the -- in the camp, they had a\nlittle jail there, and they took them in there and hanged them all.",
        "A: No, you couldn\u2019t see them.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well, one guy was hanged because he tried to hide. He wa -- he was really a sa -- I think he\nwas kind of half -- half crazy. He had had so much of this camp that he wanted to get away, so he\nhid in a chimney somewhere. And so we were standing there waiting for this last one to count.\nFinally they found him, and then next Sunday they hanged him. So that was him. That was the\nend of that one.",
        "A: No. No, by the time you have these dog ruled barbed wire fencing and they were about what,\n12 feet high, and you have dogs running around in between, and you have people -- ma-machine\nguns all over. You had nightlights shining down these -- between the two. No, you don\u2019t stand a\nchance. I don\u2019t know of anybody who ever got out of Neuengamme anyway.",
        "A: By surviving. I mean, there\u2019s -- we were fortunate in -- in a sense that after a few month we\nstarted getting food packages from -- from the Danish Red Cross. And there was -- the beginning\nthere was a -- th-there was soap -- soap in them, there was food in them, there was all kinds of\nthings. But in the beginning the Germans would open up the box, open all the packages and\ndump everything in -- in a -- in a bowl, so you get your soapsuds, and your salami and your\ncoffee beans all in one nice mess. But then after awhile then they would leave them alone and\nthen they worked out fine. One of the big things was salami, they used to ship us -- God knows\nhow much salami. You can get tired of that if you get too much. But that really is what -- what\nhelped again. And then this -- one time they sent us some clothes, you got a jacket, which was\nbadly needed.",
        "A: Not that I know of, never saw anybody get any.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if -- if the people in the resistance hadn\u2019t been involved\nin some of it, but I -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know one way or the other for sure.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: We were permitted to write a letter, was every month or every six weeks, and we were told\nwhat we could say. You know, I\u2019m only -- I\u2019m fine, how are you, I hope you are fine, good-bye.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Well, at least it was your handwriting. So they knew you were still alive, that\u2019s\nabout all it amounted to.",
        "A: Well, of course, out of the -- the 13 of us that went down at the same time, we managed pretty\nmuch to stick together. The minister got shipped to another camp. The one fellow died, but the\nother one -- the two -- two got moved to another section, but there was about six or seven, and\nwe -- we managed to stick pretty much together.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And we -- we came back on the same bus.",
        "A: Well, the fellow that died, his name was Thompson.",
        "A: No, no, that was one of the 13.",
        "A: He was an innkeeper from just south of Elsinore.",
        "A: No, he died of TB.",
        "A: I think he died of TB.",
        "A: The other ones -- the one called Christenson, he\u2019s the guy that had the stroke after the war.\nNo, I don\u2019t remem -- remember their names.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: We were --",
        "A: No, we were pulled out of jail together and shipped down south together.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know them.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: When?",
        "A: That must have been in July of \u201944, or August. Sometime in the summer of \u201944.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, like I say, the preferred subject was what are we going to do when we get out. There\nwasn\u2019t really much to talk about what we had done -- not much to talk about what we\u2019d done\nduring the war. That was kind of a item you didn\u2019t really talk much about. There wasn\u2019t really\nthat much to talk about either what you had done before the war, it was really mostly what --\nwhat you gonna do from now on, when the war\u2019s over, when you get out.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m -- I kind of wondered too once in awhile because you see, some people -- I\nn --6 there was one Danish fellow I knew, tall, strong, big, good looking, he didn't last a month.\nHe just seemed like he -- he collapsed, he just kind of fell apart. And all the small, skinny\nfellows, you know, that would ca -- kind of hang around. So it has nothing to do with physique.",
        "A: Yeah, and that\u2019s where we -- we had that minister, which was very helpful.",
        "A: One of the 13 was a minister.",
        "A: I can\u2019t even think of his name any more, but he was good, he was very, very good. Very nice\nchap.",
        "A: Well, you know, he would ta -- he\u2019d talk to you an-and cheer you up, and pray a little and\nthings like that. Can\u2019t think of his name, but he was there an-and that must have been like in -- in\nJanuary of \u201945. The Germans ca -- ca -- I think they collected all the ministers in one particular\ncamp, and he was -- he was shipped down there.",
        "A: Oh, it was on March or April of \u201945. Course, jaundice is something that kind of comes fairly\nslowly. I mean, it\u2019s not like all of a sudden boom. Dysentery kind of comes pretty quick, and I\nwas in so-called hospital for -- oh, I guess it was only three or four days before we were moved\nwith the buses back to Denmark.",
        "A: No, it was just 00 --",
        "A: Just one of the barracks, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. But you know, yellow jaundice, you\u2019re all -- your eyes are yellow, your face yellow\nand --",
        "A: -- and then you -- when you have this dysentery on top of that, that makes it not so good.",
        "A: Besides, they didn\u2019t have any medicine for anything.",
        "A: Well then, the head of the Swedish Red Cross, a fellow name -- name -- fe-fellow by the\nname of Bernadotte had made a deal with Himmler, that he would try to negotiate with the allied\nand get a peace going, and the price for that, Hitler had -- Himmler had to pay was to agree that\nall Danish and Norwegian concentrace -- concentration camp inmates should be shipped to\nSweden until the end of the war. So that\u2019s when several white buses came down to the camp.\nFirst they collected a bunch of prisoners from other camps in Neuengamme, Norwegian and the\nDanish. Then the buses came down, and then they took all the prisoners up to a camp just north\nof the Danish German border, fa -- a place called Froslev So we come up there and we were\nthere for a couple of days and then they took us by bus and they -- and train, we were supposed\nto go through Copenhagen and over to Sweden. But I didn't want to go back to Sweden. So just\nbefore the -- you get into Copenhagen there\u2019s fairly long hill. And I was in the first car, so I went\nup in the platform and ended up -- said to the -- to the engineer, I want to get off. So he said well,\nhe could slow down at that hill there, which he did, and then I jumped off the train. And then I\nwas in -- in Denmark.",
        "A: Well yeah, jump. I didn\u2019t fall, I jumped off.",
        "A: No, oh no, no, you roll. You roll a lot. I mean, they\u2019re moving fairly fast.",
        "A: Well, no sicker than I got on the train. Yeah, I had been -- they took us from the camp in\nGermany, took us across the border to Denmark, put us in this camp down there just over the\nborder. We were there for maybe a week, and then the -- we were gonna go to Sweden. And as\nwe came with these buses o-over the border to Denmark, the first place they took us to was a\ndairy. We could have all the milk we wanted. And not having had any milk for about eight\nmonth, and I drank a lot you really get a tummy ache. It sure tasted good. So then I got off the\ntrain in Copenhagen, and s -- I went over to somebody I knew down there and couple of days\nlater I went and got the -- some I.D.. And then I went up to Elsinore and stayed for a few days\nwith a -- with a couple- And then I heard one night the war was over. So I called my parents and\nthen I spoke with them and bought a bicycle, drove home. That was a nice trip. And that was\nMay five, \u201945. Interesting years.",
        "A: My father was at work and so was my sister, so I called them. My mother was there, she said,\nwhat can I do, you want a sandwich? Of course sure I did that. So I had something to eat. Then I\n-- I went out to the office I used to work, just to say hello and I was back. And they said,\nwhenever you\u2019re ready, come on back. So then I went back home again, my father got home.\nAnd then I was home for a couple of days, and then they told me to go to the hospital because of\nthe jaundice and that. So I was in the hospital for about a week I guess. And then I was on -- in\nthe -- in the countryside for a week, and then back to work. I think I was back to work within\nfour weeks after I come back from Germany. There wasn\u2019t any of the psychological\nstraightening out assistance and everything like that. So I went back. And then I worked for a\ncouple of month, then I heard about that job in England, went over there.",
        "A: Well, I guess we just talked. They wanted to know how it had been, and I wanted to know\nwhat had happened there, you know. So I\u2019m -- I\u2019m sure we talked until rather late in the evening.\nBut there wasn\u2019t any celebration in that sense. There was just -- I guess we were both pretty --\npretty pleased we were still alive.",
        "A: Oh no, they were all over. They were all over the place. No, they didn\u2019t leave, but you know\nthey -- they -- the British and the -- and the American came in, and the Germans had given up in\nall but one very small part of Denmark where they want to fight, and eventually the Russians\nbumped them out of that Bornholm. But -- so the Germans start -- just started walking -- walking\nhome. Nice to see them leave.",
        "A: No, they -- they just let them go. A lot of the Germans would buy -- tried to buy food to take\nhome. But the time they get down to the border they just had to leave everything in one big pile.",
        "A: The -- the -- not to take them back to -- to Germany. For one thing, they were paying with --\nwith money that the German army had borrowed from the Danish government, which means that\nin a sense the Danish government was paying for all this stuff. So they didn\u2019t want to -- all that\nstuff to leave Denmark.",
        "A: Well, the standard operation for the women, you cut their hair off. You have them standing on\na -- on a truck and you drive through Copenhagen. For the -- for the men, same thing, cut the --\ncut them bald and same thing, and then they put them all in jail and you kind of straighten out\nwithin a few weeks, you know, who should stay in jail, and -- and who hadn\u2019t been that bad, they\ncould let them out. There were -- some of the worst fellows, some of them who would be\nshooting Danes for instance there-was some of that going on, too. They wound up, and the com -\n- some of them got executed. They were shot. But I don\u2019t think there were more than 40 and 50\nall told, like that. And then there were some that were put in jail. The German general and the\nhead of the Gestapo in Denmark, people like that, they were -- they were put in jail, they were in\nfor six or seven years, then they shipped them out, back to Germany. So there was a big party\nthat night.",
        "A: That night the war was over. You know, you would have all the -- all your doors, your\nwindows open, all the lights you wanted, you can -- you can put candles out in the street if you\nwant to do that. You could play all the music we want, with the doors open. Could do all those\nthings you couldn\u2019t do during the war.",
        "A: Yep. As I recall, my mother had one can of Portuguese sardines she had left. We ate that\nnight, celebration. Yeah, that was some party. And then we were back to work, and then the --\nthe daily routine started again.",
        "A: Oh, ah --",
        "A: Yeah, that was Dr. Erstwag, I think.",
        "A: Yeah, I met him sometime over there. Oh, I knew he was over naturally, cause I\u2019d helped him\nget over, but I didn't know where he was, and I met him on the street one day, I don\u2019t even\nremember what town it was. But he wa -- it was nice to see them, th-they both looked -- and the\nbaby was doing well. Started walking and everything else. Little girl.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, th-they went over with -- they went over with a fishing boat, I think.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, th-they told me they appreciate what I -- helped them get over and all that, and told me\nhow well they were doing and everything else. They were looking forward to getting back before\nlong. Back to Denmark. Then he died shortly after, but I met her years later.",
        "A: I think there was a -- a -- quite a lot of people who realized that the people who been resistant\nhad -- had taken some awful lumps, physically, financially. What they did on the physical part of\nit was built some old age homes specifically for people who had been involved with that. They\nhave five of them, I think, in Denmark now. On the financial part, they examined eventually\neverybody. That was -- I think it was five years before I ever wa-was checked out and -- to find\nout whether you have anything anything wrong, any -- any lowered ability of making your\nliving, And things like that.. And if -- decided, I think they decided I was 60 percent unable to\nwork full speed. So then they give you a certain amount of money to make up for that. Well I\nbeen working right along, but of course if -- if I hadn\u2019t been down there, things might have\nworked out a little bit better, because you do have certain problems after that. I mean ow -- you\ndon\u2019t sleep as good as you -- you normally would. There are -- there are certain disadvantages.\nBut I think they\u2019ve been very liberal over there in -- in what they\u2019ve been doing.",
        "A: Yeah. But nothing compared to what I used to.",
        "A: All of a sudden you -- you are back there, in -- in some of it, and -- then you kind of wake up,\nyou know, and you\u2019re a little unhappy and takes awhile before you go back to bed -- go back to\nsleep.",
        "A: In a sense, yeah, that\u2019s what it is. But eventually, I think, you get pretty much over that.",
        "A: Yeah. But it doesn\u2019t bother me any more now, fortunately. So -- oh, I came out pretty good, I\nmean. Physically, mentally, everything else, I came out a lot better than a bunch of fellows did.",
        "A: Well, I think I gotta say the government has been very liberal, considerate and -- and\neverything else like that. Some of the -- some of the natives had a little different attitude, but --\nlittle bit more shortsighted. He didn\u2019t help me any, so what good he done for me? But that\u2019s a\nminority. I\u2019ve been over there, oh, I don\u2019t know, 20 times since then, and it -- it\u2019s nice to get over\nthere, but it\u2019s not like they used to be, I mean, like it was before the war. And I guess it\u2019ll never\nbe like that, at least won\u2019t -- it won\u2019t for me.",
        "A: Oh, because you can\u2019t help, you walk around and you get to think, you know, this happened\nthere, and that happened there, you know, those things [indecipherable]",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah. Yep.",
        "A: That\u2019s my passport, issued in 1942 and worth ti -- valid until 1947.",
        "A: And this one here is from \u201947 to \u201952.",
        "A: Ah, when was that? From \u201950 -- 752 to \u00b058. 1952 to \u201950 -- \u201958, yeah. And that was the last\nDanish passport I had. Then \u201954, I became a U.S. citizen.\nEnd of Tape Three\nConclusion of Interview\n"
