        "Malden, Massachusetts\n[After Mr. Fishman interjected, the remainder of the interview was\nconducted with him. ]\nWe're speaking with Mrs. Lonia Fishman and the date is March 29,\n1992. We're in Malden, Massachusetts. Mrs. Fishman can you tell\nus about yourself, what was your name before you were married?\nMy name before I married was Lonia Goldman.\nWhere were you born?\nWegrow Pooluski\nin Poland\nPoland\nAnd your date of birth?\nMy date of birth is May 3, 1920.\nWhat can you tell us about your childhood? What was your family\nlike? Did you have brothers and sisters? What did your parents\ndo?\nYes, we were four sisters and one brother. We had a factory from\ncotton. My mother was a housewife. This was very nice. We went\nto school.\nWhere did you go to school?\nIn Poland, in *?[13]\nIn a public school?\nPublic school.\nDid you have a Jewish education, too?\nYes. We do not have over there private schools. We have just one",

        "private school. In separate we went to a Hebrew school *Bais Yakov\n[ph1i5] they called it, as a child. When the child doesn't want to\ngo to the Beis Yaakov we have a man, a rabbi, coming into the house\nand teach us Jewish.\nThe Beis Yaakov was just for the girls?\nRight.\nAnd the boys went to a Cheder?\nThat's right. This was nice. We lived a very nice life, quiet,\nnice. We loved each other, all the four children.\nDid you have anything that you liked to do in particular, any\nhobbies, any interests?\nHobbies, yes. Everybody had a different hobby. The hobby most was\nlike you make shawls from the yarn. That's what we liked to do,\nknitting a lot.\nHow did you learn how to do it?\nWe learned from people, from school. And it was a very, very happy\nhouse. It was not like here. You get married, one lives here and\none lives there. Everybody lives close to each other. That makes\na very, very nice family, a close family. Here in this country\nit's different. When they get married one goes to California, the\nother, goes to Florida, you don't see each other. You see just one\nthing, on wedding or by death. It's the truth. We were very happy,\nhappy and healthy kids. By us my mother never worked. My father\njust worked. My mother was a housewife, cooking very nice, cleaning\nthe house was the girls. And this was every day. We were very\nhappy.\nDid you go to high school or gymnasium?\nNo. Over there is just high schools, seven years high school.\nOver there it was very hard for the Jewish people to attend college,\nlike gymnasium. Here they call a college, by us it's gymnasium.\nSome maybe they went - very, very, very little. When we grow up,\nfinish the high school, everybody was learning a trade. The man\nwas Shoemakers, the other was a ?[42] and the third one was how to\nsew dresses. Everybody when they liked it they made, they had a",

Me and my sister, the\nolder sister, we made quilts.\nAnd you sold them?\nYes, a lot. And we went to Warsaw. The last couple of years we\nmoved to Warsaw.\nThe whole family?\nYes, the whole family. And I was making over there, too, the\nguilts.\n(Voice of her husband asking to interrupt) Her mother in the ghetto\nwhen she was cooking, she cooked up a meal and she put in six\npotatoes ina big pot of water and we had to share. She shared out\nthe meal and she remembered Shloime the shoemaker didn't have a\nwife and doesn't have nothing to eat, she took him a plate and\nbrought it in to *Schleuma.\nThat was in Europe, not in this country. Everybody knows about\nthis. In this country a lot of people came from Europe, too, not\nnow today, maybe 50 years ago, they remember a lot of good things\ntoo. But the new generation today is different. Like I spoke with\nmy granddaughter, God bless her, she's eighteen. Ah, she says,\nbubby, here it's different when you were in Europe, everything the\nworld changes. I told her the world doesn't change, the people is\nchanging. And it's the truth, it's the people.\nHow old were you when you got married?\nEighteen. My mother was alive, my father was alive. His family\nwas alive.\nBut the ghetto already existed.",

        "Yes, existed, in Warsaw. We married in Warsaw.\nBut it was permitted? I know at a certain point it wasn't\npermitted.\nIt was permitted.\n(Mr. Fishman speaks) It was in the forty. It was only a few months\ntill the Germans come in. You were staying in the line when the\nGermans came in for a loaf of bread and a Polish guy saw you and\nsaid a Jew. The Germans took you out and wouldn't let you get a\nloaf of bread. I happened to say, I don't know what it was in me,\nI was not afraid for anything. I was staying in line. If they\ngive bread, it wasn't written down here I'm a Jew. I took off my\narm band, I took off the star and just put it in the pocket. In my\ncity I couldn't do this. Everybody knew me. But when I was staying\nwhere nobody knew me and when they shared out bread to the Poles I\nwas right in the line.\nSo you moved out of your family's home when you got married, is\nthat right?\nThat's right. We lived together in an apartment. They say they\ngonna make an *upshtong[ph82] how do they say this in English, an\nuprising. We went to the small city, to Wegrow, to our city, and\nwe lived with our parents.\nDid you speak Yiddish at home?\nYes. We speak Yiddish. We don't use Polish. We use Polish when\nwe went to school, with our pupil, with the kids, and the boys you\nknow what I mean. Polish school, Polish talking. But Jewish we\nspeak in the house. We wrote Jewish letters. And I can write\nPolish letters. Like here, you can write English. When we went\nto the fourth grade, to the fifth grade they told us we can pick a\nforeign language. Who wants German or who wants French? But for\nus, the Jewish people, we took German because it was easier.\nClose to Yiddish.\nThat's why. That's all. It was very nice.\nWe heard a lot from your husband about what was going through his\nmind, his determination and whatever. What was going through your",

You gonna be alive, its okay, no, is I going to be in between\nthe six million. It was miracles.\n(Husband) What she told me, your heart tells you to go, you go,\nyou leave me here.\nBecause I was afraid. I was thinking soon I go out from this house,\nI give you an example, the Germans were after me and they're going\nto shoot me. It's not better than they going to come in here and\nlet them shoot me here.\n(Husband) No, when I have to go, you have to come with me as a\ncompany.\nIt was very hard. From the Polish man when he told you we went out\nfrom him he told us we were hiding over there but he came from the\nlittle city when he said would be better when you poison yourself\n(Husband) He was a friend. He tried how to say look it's easier\nhow to say to get the poison and get it over with. My mind is a\ndifferent mind.\nAnd we were thinking it's better for us just to leave them.\n(Husband) It is the truth. When you fight and you get killed,\nit's all right. But to go the way I saw the people went, how to\nSay, it's a shame to repeat like going like cows to. the\nslaughterhouses. It was not in my vocabulary. It was not in my\ndictionary. You kill me or I'll kill you. No, it's not in my\nphilosophy, maybe in my father's philosophy. Maybe he understood\nif he hits you on one side you'll put up the other side, not me.\nYou lift an arm and I'll break it.\nBut the first thing nobody believed, you know what I mean, that\nit's going to be something like this. They believed just one thing.\nThe war 1S a war. It's going to be maybe a week, two weeks, three",

        "weeks and then it's going to get over. Who believed that's it\ngoing to be like a slaughterhouse. You see what I mean?\n(Husband) The first thing my father didn't believe for this weapon.\nHe remembered the World War I and he said the German is a cultured\nnation. Would never do anything like this. Everything is\npropaganda. But when the major was in our house and he said to my\nmother. He stood in the light. He felt sorry because it's such a\nnice family. He knew that they're going to be eliminated. But it\nwas too late. You couldn't go no place. We have now a different\ngeneration in Israel and I'm proud of it. When it was the war, the\nSix day war, I have a passport. I still have a passport. I flew\ndown over there to Israel and I was with my friends in the jeeps.\nI took my daughter, too, with me, Eva, the oldest. I was over\nthere in the jeeps when they took *El Arish[ph134] and where King\nHussein had his palace, Ramala. I was there. I was there when\nthey hung out the sheets in the window, they're giving up, they're\nblowing them apart. Oh no, not me.\nWhat about your wife?\n(Husband) She is different. In me is still the ache what they did\nto our people. No nation in the world tried to stop this murderers.\nOur blood was swimming up in rivers. The world tried to forget.\nNot me. How old I am, I wouldn't mind to go. Now we have a\ncountry. We have something to stand in our own land. No more. I\ntaught this to my kids.\nNot a lot of people thinks like he thinks.\nDid you want to add anything to the story. We know what happened\nto you during the war period but is there anything from your\nperspective that you would like to tell me?\nAbout what?\nAbout your experiences. Fven though you were together the whole\ntime, you're a still different individual. Obviously you have a\ndifferent idea.\nNo the same, we lived through exactly the same....\n(Husband) Listen you can tell when I went into the ghetto and I\ngot shot through the collar.",

        "(wife) I'll tell you just one thing. How much you say, they're\ngoing to put in just one third.\n(Husband) No, it's in the tape. Tell them the way I went in the\nnight and when we decided to go into the cellar and take out the\n*?leather[ph 170] and when we're going to share out in the\nmorning....\n(wife) You said it, you said it. Finish up.\n(Husband) When we was in the colony, when I give you the address\n*Lofa[phl174]. We were the whole family, six or seven people. They\nwere producing *?leather. One time the father came over to me and\nsaid to me *Vascha[177] would you like to go with my sons, hide it,\nbury it, some leather? See the agreement was between us they will\nstay *?all secure-------------the city from-------[179]. He'll\ngive me two sons for this, *Libel and?[181]. If I'll take out\nthree sacks of *?leather, one sack will be mine and two, this is\nhis stuff. So the two brothers was outside the city. I went in\nthe city but when it's no people in the city, when you go in with\nthe shoes, it makes an echo. What I did, I took off the shoes and\nI took off the shoelaces, make a knot and put it around my neck and\nI went in the stockings. I brought it out. Before I brought it\nout, the *leather, the reflector, it was going around, cut me. A\nseries of bullets went in my direction. One bullet went through\nthe collar. The collar of cotton, the cotton was sticking out from\nthe other side. The bullets went through. I didn't get hurt\nbecause I dropped on the ground. But I went into the cellar. I\ntook it out three sacks of *leather because I didn't have nothing.\nI couldn't trade with a promise. I didn't have nothing. I had to\nhave a half a loaf of bread. The farmer is not going to give you\nanything if you don't give him something in exchange. So when I\nbrought out the *leather from the cellar and we come back to the\nvillage, I was very tired. I went to sleep. We climbed into the\nhay. When we got up, it was noontime my sack was a half. They\ntook it off, a half a sack. It was over there the tops of the\n*leather. When I have this I could trade with the farmers, give\nthem a piece of *leather they could give me a loaf of bread, a pot\nof water, some milk. The father, like I told you there were six or\nseven people, I think there were four brothers...I went over to the\nfather and I told him look I went down to the ghetto. I took out\nthe *leather. Now you stole from me half a sack. Let me tell you\nsomething. I'm not afraid for you all of them. The only thing",

I said the\nonly thing I have to do when you sit down shitting - in the morning\neverybody used go down and gather around the barn, let down the\npants and make your duty. I said when you do your duty the only\nthing what I have to do, grab your hat and run away. I don't need\nanything. I come around better than you and I'm not afraid of your\nfamily. Finally he decided to put it back in and he put it back\nin, everything. I didn't have to fight with him. I just said\nlook, the only thing that I have to do is just grab your hat and\nthat's it. They're alive, the whole family. Only I think the\nmother passed away after the war. But they're all alive. I think\ntwo sons. They're in New York. One brother had a son. He's a\nrabbi like I told you in Rhode Island, in Providence. One brother\nis here in Boston. He was working in a factory where they're making\nSausages. He comes from a family of butchers. So he was working\nover there until he retired. He got married with a German girl, in\nGermany, not Jewish. He paid for it. He came over here. He saved\nup some money. She took the bank book, took out the money, left\nhim, and she went back to Germany. He paid for it. So I don't\nfeel sorry for him. A lot of Jews did it this way. I'm a\nnationalist. You can call me a fascist. You can call me anything\nyou want. The Jewish people are my people. We paid for it. We\npaid for it very dear with our blood. I can't help it. I am what\nI am, like me or hate me.\nYou have all these pictures of your family members. Maybe to\npreserve their memory just a little bit we could talk about\nindividuals, at least your parents. Could we do that?\n(Husband) I told you my parents were wonderful people. They're\ncharitable people.\nCan we do is specifically, like your father.

I remember the way he\nhad brothers. He had sisters. My zaida took me to his father, the\nelter zaida. He was a hundred and twelve years old. He was white.\nThe kids were taking care of him, I'll never forget. I remember\nthe kids the way they were taking care of him, washing his stockings.\nHe was like a prince in bed. When the Germans came in it's\nunfortunate how they took a man like this and they shot him. A\nhundred and twelve years old and blind. I remember when my zaida\ntook me, he shall bless me. They used to tell me stories. I used\nto be the oldest from the whole *eineklas[ph274] from all the\ngrandchildren and naturally I was the oldest and I tried to be, I\nrun the group. I was how to say the leader, the bully. So my\ngrandfather took me to his father.

And you're doing it, pretty good. I\nsays look, I want to give you a test. Look how are you going to do\nit. He had a box of matches, wooden matches in Europe. Let me see\nthe way you break them. You take them between the fingers like\nthis and break them. So he took a match and I took it and I broke\nit. Oh he says to me, you're strong. So he gives me two matches.\nI broke them. And he said to me, I'll give you three matches.\nWhat 1s the three matches? You're taking them and you're breaking\nthem. He says to me you know you're very strong. He says how many\ngrandchildren do we have here right now? He counted them up. 4dHe\nsays, what? twelve. He says I want to see how strong you are. He\ntook the twelve matches and put them together and he took a little\nthread and he wind them around. And he says, now you break them.\nI couldn't.

What was his occupation, do you\nknow?\n(Husband) He was in business. He had a stand like a market, like\na booth. He was selling fish and he was selling cherries, corn,\nvegetables. This was my grandfather. Then when he retired he gave\nit up he used to go lay down in the field and he used to give me a\nJewish newspaper and used to say, keep away the flies, I can sleep.\nIt was not a bad life.\nDo you Know about your grandmother?\n(Husband) It was in Europe usually the Jewish women were housewives.\nMy mother used to be a businesswoman because we had a business. We\nhad to do it. You know Friday you come in the house, if you had\nfour plates, all four plates was cooking. Everything was for\nSaturday. You never know how many people you have to bring home\nfor supper. You know always was enough. When it was not enough\nshe gave away a plate because she can have later on another plate.\nDoesn't mean anything.\nDo you know about your father's education?

Every merchant what he was well off, you take them for two\ndays, the other take them for two days and that's the way they were\nSitting and learning.

They had like a little union. It was not a luxury life,\nbut everybody was making a living, an honest living. We had Jews\nwe used to say were *Jokers[ph355] You know what *Jokers[ph356]\nis? I give you an example. The farmer brought into the city once\na week chicken to sell. You take a Jewish man he wanted to see if\nthe chicken is fat. He used to put it in his finger in the side,\nfrom the chicken is always fat. He used to talk to the farmer and\nhe says look you wanted so much money take a look the chicken\ndoesn't weigh enough. The meat you let the chicken run away and\nthe farmer used to chase the chicken. There was a couple and the\nman couldn't make a living. He was not a craftsman, he was not a\nbusinessman and the wife used to say to the man, look why don't you\ngo out and grab anything to bring home a loaf of bread, anything.\nSo he went out to the city and saw that a farmer was carrying a big\ntree. They had to put a pole to put on the electric lights and the\nhorse was pulling the tree. The horse had to pull the wagon with\nthe tree. So the farmer said hey Jew get off. Oh he said no my\nwife told me I had to grab anything so he took the whip and whipped\nhim up and then he come home. He was whipped up and his wife says\nto him how come you're whipped up.

They\nused to have some cigarettes. They used to go out and sell it.\nThey used to have thread, they used to have things when the ghetto\nwas still open, the Polish people used to come in and buy it or\ntrade. They used to take it out to the other side and sell it.\nTill they closed the ghetto. Once they closed the ghetto you\ncouldn't go in, you couldn't go out.

In the late\nthing they used to make Jewish money. You couldn't do nothing\noutside with it. Just the Jews used to do between themselves.\nWas your family deported or did they die in the ghetto?\nI don't know.

Then my father said take your wife and try to leave.\nSee if you can survive. I said to the family, how about you? In\nour family they believe we don't want to live anyway without each\nother. It was a very tight family. Or we live together or we die\ntogether. Instead of saying to the kids run, try to survive, split.\nNo, or we live together or we die together. Nobody wants to live\nwithout each other anyway. Because I was married\nmy father pushed me out and said take your wife and try to survive.\nAnd I managed. I don't know how, I survived. I can tell the story\nabout it.\nDo you want to talk a little bit about your mother?\nMy mother was from Kaluszyn. You know over there the Jews they\nknew each other and they married to the grade. Rich are married to\nthe rich, the poor are married to the poor. Sometimes you fall in\nlove, a poor could marry to a rich. You know love is a very strong\nweapon. It breaks all the weapons in the world. The king of\nEngland gave up his throne for the woman he loved so I think the\nstrongest power in the world is love. I'm surprised about the\nJewish people. Fven today Israel, I thought Israel would be the\nmirror for the world, what we went through, how we can show an\nexample to the world, how we can live like a family. When I was in\nIsrael, I was riding in a taxi I had an argument with my own. Not\na born Israeli, she was emigrated to Israel. Why I emigrated to\nAmerica is because my wife she had her father's sister was here in\nMassachusetts they had shoe factories.
