        "Q: So people started talking about that?",
        "A: Yes, yes, they did \u2014 I \u2014 I don\u2019t remember [indecipherable] but I \u2014 I \u2014 I cannot\ncon \u2014 yes, every family already knew that this is bad.",

So \u2014 and so that \u2014 that\u2019s how we found out what\nhappened.",
        "Q: Okay. The background to this, from what I \u2014 from what I have read, is that that\nMolotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed in August, 1939 \u2014 August 23\", and one week\nlater, September first, is when Hitler attacks Poland. And sometime in the fall, I\nbelieve it was October, I could be wrong, the Soviets start marching in, and that 1\u2014\nthen \u2014 start marching in, but do not take over the country until 1940.",

If I tell him\nmaybe \u2014 you know, she like, had a picture of me. But then I thought, maybe she\nplayed double game. Maybe she worked also for the underground.

To \u2014 to \u2014 to see that we\nare again of controlled by somebody else, if not tsars, then Jews, somebody. I think\nthat these un \u2014 it was not \u2014 I could feel that.

        "Q: Okay. This is the winter of \u201945.",
        "A: Because the bomb [indecipherable] other factories. They could not get metal,\nthey could not get thi \u2014 so suddenly, from 16 hours a day of work, or somewhere\nthere, they began cutting. First they cut one hour, then another hour, and of course,\nthe more hours they cut, as they were cutting down, our \u2014 our spirits got \u2014 went the\nsame speed up. We knew that oh, they\u2019re running out of stuff.",
        "Q: Yeah.",

Keep cleaning and\ncleaning, and like 1-1t was, we came so bor \u2014 to work, you will work, you do,\nautomatically you begin to forget even that you are working. You begin to dream,\nand your future fa \u2014 fantasies. But when you just cleaning and cleaning, the boredom\nof it is \u2014 1s \u2014 1s \u2014 1s suffering.",
        "Q: Okay. And so \u2014",
        "A: So eventually \u2014 and that\u2019s when we concocted a \u2014 when it was reduced to like\nfive or six hours of actual work, and the rest was cleaning, we thought, with Adolfas\nwhat \u2014 okay, when we came \u2014 when we left with \u2014 on the same train \u2014 not on the\n214July 1, 2018\nsame, had later somehow, they joined \u2014 they transferred from some other train, into\nour train, two Karaims, Tinfavichas(ph). And then, when we arrived, already they\nbrought us to Elmshorn, we found that there was one \u2014 one more Lithuanian, and he\nwas \u2014 and I knew him from Birzai. He was a young graduate of medical school in\nRiga, Kregzde, Jonas KregZde, who was very, very, very, very bright, he spoke\nmany \u2014 Riga had at that time \u2014 was a university where you could study Sanskrit, you\ncould \u2014 oriental languages and philosophies and \u2014 and he spoke them all, and he was\nin music. We learned really a lot from him. So for some time they put him into our\nbarracks, also. And it\u2019s from him \u2014 and he was very close to Jakub\u00e9nas \u2014\nJakub\u00e9nas, prof \u2014 Professor Jakub\u00e9nas was a \u2014 a \u2014 a te \u2014 te-teaching in Kaunas,\nand there was some religious institute, a Protestant religion institute, and he was\nquite, you know, prominent in his field in Lithuania. And he had the top \u2014 when\nsome of the intellectuals left the be \u2014 because they\u2019re so \u2014 so even he left a \u2014 during\nthe first weeks, I think, or months of German occupation, and \u2014 and settled down in\nlud \u2014 in hoi \u2014 Holstein \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, Schleswig-Holstein?",
        "A: Schleswig-Holstein. And Kregzde knew him, and the \u2014 a-a-and he was ver \u2014\nJakub\u00e9nas was respected by local Germans there, and they \u2014 he persuaded them to\ngive \u2014 to crack the \u2014 to \u2014 a job in one of the local hospitals \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.\nJuly 1, 2018",
        "A: \u2014 because he was a medical \u2014 you know, he had just graduated. So he ended up\nhere in \u2014 in Schleswig-Holstein, in \u2014 in \u2014 in that area. But before he left, he said, if\none day you want to try to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 if you think it\u2019s realistic to run to Sweden to\nescape, I will give you some leads. He \u2014 he knew beca \u2014 from Riga, during his\nstudies, he had made contacts with \u2014 with Sweden.

        "Q: In Denmark. Oh, okay.",
        "A: No. So, we \u2014 we talked. Somehow when the \u2014 the hours became shorter, we\nthought, why don\u2019t we tell brothers Neunert that since there is no work here, you\nknow, we could \u2014 maybe we\u2019re willing to go to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 they could send us to\nKiel.",
        "Q: Okay.\nJuly 1, 2018",
        "A: But we also, when we said this, we knew that Kiel was bombed almost every day,\nevery night. So somehow, I \u2014 he did not know what to do with the workers.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So, I think the idea came first \u2014 we overheard from him, that he was with his\nbrother, he had a brother who was a very, actually nice supervisor there. He used to\nbe a teacher, and when the war started, they put him in the factory. So, he never\nliked, he was o \u2014 and he, that helped me \u2014 you see, I had the machine, I was working\nwith the machine. I all \u2014 always had little pieces of paper with German let \u2014 with\nGerman words. I was studying there, my language. So he used to come to me like a\nteacher, and then examine me. So, I think we overheard there was, then figured out \u2014\nout what do do with the workers, and that\u2019s when we dropped this Kiel idea. So said,\noh, yes, I think we \u2014 we will be sending some people, some of the workers, because\nthere they still have materials.",

        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: Naively thinking that, you know, we can very easily \u2014 but before that, we\ncontinued to Flensburg, and from there to \u2014 we walked to Husum.",

But just before we boarded the train, and the police comes and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n218July 1, 2018\nasks for our papers. So we had the basic papers fro \u2014 that Germans had given to all\ntheir workers. So that it \u2014 identification was there, but the fact that wet \u2014 we\u2019re\nsupposed to report to Kiel, that was not there. They \u2014 that did not know. So, is it \u2014\nno, you cannot \u2014 you cannot cross the border. So, they threw us out. So we \u2014 we\nwalk around, and we took our time, we walk around, and we \u2014 we go into like two or\nthree wagons, la \u2014 and we \u2014 and we \u2014 we walked there around, and we \u2014 we \u2014 we\nsort of jumped into \u2014 on a train that was already like moving out. But it \u2014 like in 15\nminutes we realized that it was not going to Denmark, it was going back to \u2014 to\nSchleswig, or \u2014 or another town, back to where you \u2014 we came from.",

Like the po \u2014 and in which way? Not in crimes, in the \u2014 that the\npoet Matuzevicius(ph), who had \u2014 was in the \u2014 from gymnasium Birzai, two or\nthree years earlier than me, and some of his friends \u2014 and so I understood from\n249July 1, 2018\nMichael that he has \u2014 that he has confessed to the Soviet secret police that during the\nshooting of the Jews, he was asked with his friends to take care to protect their home\n\u2014 their home belongings [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Okay, their \u2014 their items, their assets, yeah.",
        "A: Their assets. So that is the \u2014 so I\u2014 I knew, and \u2014 and actually admired li \u2014 like the\n\u2014 like the younger, budding, you know, poets cal \u2014 you know, want to be published,\nand want to be know \u2014 every young poet wants the \u2014 and has it \u2014 some people, close,\nthat he \u2014 older poets that he or she admires. At that time Matuzevicius(ph) was the\npoet of [indecipherable]. He was the young, like [indecipherable]. And he was\ngood, and very promising. It did not happen, because he was arrested, he went to\nSiberia, etcetera. He was destroyed. But we, all the younger of ones who \u2014 who\nwere writing poetry, wanted to be poet, admired. So, it was \u2014 when I heard this from\nMichael, to me was a little bit of a shock. But he was also one of \u2018the six.\u2019 He said \u2014\nso, in those six \u2014 and he wrote a poem about six with \u2014 which was pub-published in\nBirZy Zinios, at \u2014 I don\u2019t know what \u2014 what \u2014 what month. And \u2018the six\u2019 became\nlike heroes. People did not know that such \u2014 that they existed, when \u2014 and they\nfound out tha-that somebody was in the underground. Whatever they did, some of\nthem later, I\u2014 I\u2014 I don\u2019t know, but I think they were instrumental to \u2014 to star \u2014 help\nothers to decide that they should, you know, work underground also, like \u2014 like those\nsix who worked against the Soviets.\n250July 1, 2018",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Now, I thought it was \u2014 when I read it, I thought I \u2014 I als-also like admired that\nthey did it, but I also thought, why is he publishing this? Though they \u2014 he did not\nname the names. The poem does not name names. But I thought \u2014 I didn\u2019t know \u2014 of\ncourse, already, you see, I was in \u2014 connected to the underground, my own \u2014",
        "Q: So \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 by distributing leaflets, that is why. And then, this was already under Germans.\nAnd then, somehow it was clear that this was like wrong time to \u2014 to publish some \u2014\nsomething like that.",
        "Q: So what you \u2014 if I interpret what you\u2019re saying, is that Matuzevicius(ph) was a\npoet you admired \u2014",

        "Q: I understand that. I understand that. It is \u2014 excuse us \u2014 okay. There are \u2014 I\u2019m\ngoing to talk now, more than I usually do, but it will be in two parts. One, in trying\nto say back to you what I think I understood. Second, about the purpose of\ninterviews like this, and the whole idea of oral histories. When \u2014 when we \u2014 when\nwe conduct them, the strengths of oral histories are exactly what you say, you know\nyou\u2019re right. It is in the impressions, it is in the experiences, it is in the memories.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Well, that \u2014 people say that about art.",
        "Q: That \u2014 but in the \u2014 in the purpose of what we\u2019re doing here, is we\u2019re trying to\nestablish an historical record, through the memories of people, decades after the\nevents happened. And \u2014 and that\u2019s why, in some ways, it is a counter kind of\npurpose. And, I would say, you know \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 forgive me for that. Because as much as possible, I need to anchor things in\ncontext, in dates, in understanding. So I think \u2014 a-and I think it \u2014",
        "Q: I know. But here\u2019s the thing. What you are telling me, makes sense to me. But\nthat is because I know of a lot of the history that people who will be looking at this\ninterview, may not. So that\u2019s why I want to repeat it back, and see if I have\nunderstood it properly, so that someone else can understand it properly.",
        "Q: Okay. So, here\u2019s what I\u2019m under \u2014 here\u2019s the impression I\u2019m getting, 1s that at\nsome point in 1936, or 1937, because that\u2019s the time of the Spanish Civil War, and it\nis a topic that is discussed, you remember being in your bed area, you know, the \u2014\nseparate from the living room, and lying and hearing \u2014 lying down in your bed, and\nhearing others in your family, behind the curtains, talking about politics.",
        "Q: Ah, okay, not your father \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 no \u2014 not anybody else.",
        "Q: And so these are young men.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So you \u2014 for example, at that time, you\u2019re about 14 years old. Your brother is\nalready a young man, he\u2019s around 23 - 24 years old. And he invites his friends over,\nand they\u2019re talking about the Spanish Civil War, and they\u2019re talking about social\ndemocracy of a certain kind, and in the end, they sing \u201cThe Internationale,\u201d in\nLithuanian. And then you remember, but you didn\u2019t know this at the time, but you\nremember at some point in later years, hearing that when Justas Paleckis, who is\nsomeone most American or English speaking people would not know about, but\nJustas Paleckis was a leftist writer, who, when the Soviets came into the country,\nbecame the president, quote, unquote. I don\u2019t remember his exact title, but Snie\u00a2kus\nwas the first party secretary, Paleckis was the president, and under his signature, a\nlot of people get sent to Siberia, both then, and later. And what you are saying is that\nyou intuit that your brother was somehow or other, a trusted person, because\nPaleckis \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Joniemas(ph).",

        "Q: Okay, so during independence times.",
        "Q: Okay. And so, your brother is trusted enough by Paleckis wa \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 to \u2014 for his opinion to be asked, should Paleckis take that post, which was quite",
        "Q: What does later mean?",
        "Q: Okay, when you went back.",
        "Q: Okay. So this is 30 years \u2014 33 years later, something li \u2014 well, sa \u2014 30 years later.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay. But he had it. In other words, if there was a direction of political thinking\nin your family, through po \u2014 and Povilas sounds like the most political \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And your father as well?",
        "Q: Okay. But Povilas was an influence on you.",

That\u2019s what ga \u2014 that\u2019s what I wanted to get a sense of,\nof what was the \u2014 not only the facts of pre-war life, of you know, the circumstances\nof your family, but also the atmosphere. You know, what did people talk about?\nWhat was their world, what mattered to them? And in \u2014 in \u2014 in very specific ways \u2014",

        "Q: Yeah. Yeah. So, let\u2019s come to 1939. Do you remember whether there was any\nreaction in SemeniSkiai, or Birzai, or Papilys, about the German attack on Poland,\nSeptember first?",
        "Q: Because of the controversy with Poland on Vilnius.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "Q: For \u2014 we have five \u2014",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So you said there was another. There was \u2014 there were two reactions. One was\nnice \u2014",
        "Q: So people started talking about that?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay. Now, was the \u2014 when you mention that \u2014 that Russia attached Vilnius\nback to Lithuania, why would Russia do \u2014",

        "Q: Okay. The background to this, from what I \u2014 from what I have read, is that that\nMolotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed in August, 1939 \u2014 August 23\", and one week\nlater, September first, is when Hitler attacks Poland. And sometime in the fall, I\nbelieve it was October, I could be wrong, the Soviets start marching in, and that 1\u2014\nthen \u2014 start marching in, but do not take over the country until 1940.",
        "Q: Okay. So, during that \u2014 those several months, did you continue going to school,\ndid you \u2014",
        "Q: You were then \u2014 if it was \u2014 if you were born December 24\", 1922, you would\nhave been 17 years old in December 1939. And were you then \u2014 by then in\ngymnasium in BirZai, or still \u2014",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did your schoolteachers change?",
        "Q: Did that mean that the teacher who might have formerly been a friendly teacher,\nnow became more closed, or did it mean it was a new teacher?",

        "Q: Did you speak of this to anyone at the time?",
        "Q: And they wo \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: Oh, no kidding.",
        "Q: That\u2019s quite a significant step. Now, was he \u2014 he was the mayor, and then comes\nthe Soviet system, and then comes Mr. Karibel(ph), or Draugas(ph) Karibel(ph),\nComrade Karibel from Moscow. Did \u2014 does that mean that Mr. Kleibas(ph) was\nthrown out, or did he stay?",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: Some were older.",
        "Q: But still your generation.",
        "Q: Oh yeah, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So now that, you know, you got this very pointed warning from the politruka \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 did you put those newspapers in another part of your clothing, or did you\ncontinue with your hat?",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t \u2014 you didn\u2019t continue, and \u2014",
        "Q: During this time, was there any violence \u2014",
        "Q: So that would have been spring 1941, because they march in June, in 1941.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay. Now, during the Soviet time, was there any open \u2014 you talk about this\natmosphere of fear, that\u2019s even hard to describe, but it kind of descends. Was there\nviolence? Did you see people beaten up in the street?",
        "Q: I even mean violence by Soviets. Was there any \u2014",
        "Q: I\u2019m talking before the deportations, the actual deportations, in that intra-months,\nand so on, when you talk about that, was there \u2014",
        "Q: So, is that sort of total control, you\u2019re talking.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, what was going on with your brother Povilas at this time? The Soviets have\ncome in \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",

        "Q: Okay. In BirZai?",
        "Q: Area. Okay.",
        "Q: Hm. Well, you know, it was, for someone who has leftist leanings, this kind of\nexperience was quite traumatic, because it is belying the idealism that a person could",
        "Q: I want to touch on something else that you mentioned earlier. And you said \u2014 and\nthat\u2019s on the \u2014 the anti-Semitic aspect. You say that both the politruka \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 and the mayor, were hated \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: Okay, what \u2014",
        "Q: Not that you \u2014 does it mean that when you had no emotional response, you didn\u2019t\ncare, or it was too big?",
        "Q: Well, you know \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, you know, that reminds me of what Stalin said, which many people say was\nhis strategy and his tactic, that the death of six million, or \u2014 he didn\u2019t use the word\nsix million, but the death of a million is a statistic, the death of one person is a\ntragedy.",
        "Q: You know, I\u2019m paraphrasing here, but it\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: So here is my question. When you \u2014",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re talking \u2014 if I can \u2014 I\u2019m going to try to anchor this \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 in as pa \u2014 particular time. You\u2019re talking about BBC transmissions that you are\ninvolved in distributing, not yet transcribing, but still distributing \u2014",
        "Q: With the sa \u2014 yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: That was real. That was actually \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 real. Okay.",
        "Q: But was the BBC, at this time, while they\u2019re still allies, the Soviets and the\nGermans, were they transmitting already, the crimes of the Germans against the\nJews? That is, was that something that you were picking up?",
        "Q: Yeah, that\u2019s right. That could have ve \u2014 very well been.",
        "Q: That \u2014 that it was happening in Poland.",
        "Q: So you would have been getting news of these atrocities through the BBC.",
        "Q: While the Soviets are still in power.",
        "Q: Okay. And \u2014 and people were a-at \u2014 in their circumstances, non-Jewish people,\nthe Lithuanians, and whoever else was not Jewish, was looking at the Jews who\nmight have been put in power, and saying, look at, they have brought a new regime,\nwe\u2019re not independent any more. And at the same time, if they get news from some\nunderground press, they don\u2019t believe it too much.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "Q: But you knew it, yes? When you \u2014 you knew it.",
        "Q: What was going on in Poland, you know at that time?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay. So this \u2014 this time when the teacher \u2014 the politruka \u2014 the \u2014 the political\nofficer, gives you this warning, is coming close to when the Soviet Nazi \u2014",
        "Q: The last months.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay.",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay. Now we come to June 1941. Do you remember the actual\ndeportations? Did you see any of it?",
        "Q: So someone told you, as you\u2019re going back, that \u2014 first of all, the train station 1s\nnot in the center of town, it\u2019s on the outskirts, in Birzai.",
        "Q: On the side.",
        "Q: And did you see the guards? Did you see guards?",
        "Q: During 14-15 -",

        "Q: And \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, so we\u2019re talking now for the camera, for those who will not know about\nthis, the Soviets implemented a series of deportations in the territories that they\ncontrolled. And in the Baltics, the first wave took place June 14\", 15 \u2014",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Country.",
        "Q: Here is another thought, though, and it also has a certain parallel into how people\nin the cultural sphere dealt with in Soviet times, that you have \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Yes. But when you\u2019re talking about the Soviets, ye \u2014 I assume you were meaning\nthe Soviet presence at that time, as well. That is, that was [indecipherable] at that\ntime.",
        "Q: Yeah, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, is that in later decades, there was also\nwiggle room, where people in the arts, and the culture would te \u2014 1n the Soviet\nUnion in general, and this included Lithuania, would \u2014 would write their\nperfunctory introductory paragraph, or \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 give perfunctory play \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 that was political, and that was acceptable, and then they\u2019d do what they want\nto, you know.",
        "Q: And so that in some ways, it is saying okay, we will work within the system,\nbecause this is all that we\u2019ve got, and we\u2019ll give them their duorkle(ph), their due,\nand then we\u2019ll \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay, duorkle(ph), how do we say that in English? I can even think \u2014",
        "Q: Jeepers. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s sort of like taxes, it\u2019s sort like give to Caesar what is\nCaesar\u2019s, but I don\u2019t know what \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: But here, I \u2014 when you talk about that, here is another effect, and that is, perhaps,\nthe price one pays. I mean, there have been a lot of artistic works, whether they\u2019ve",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about those who were left at \u2014",

        "Q: Were there cultural figures, let\u2019s say, than when the Germans came, that pretty\nmuch did the same thing with the Germans? That said, Adolf is the future?",
        "Q: In the world of culture.",

And he had the top \u2014 when\nsome of the intellectuals left the be \u2014 because they\u2019re so \u2014 so even he left a \u2014 during\nthe first weeks, I think, or months of German occupation, and \u2014 and settled down in\nlud \u2014 in hoi \u2014 Holstein \u2014",

        "A: \u2014 because he was a medical \u2014 you know, he had just graduated. So he ended up\nhere in \u2014 in Schleswig-Holstein, in \u2014 in \u2014 in that area. But before he left, he said, if\none day you want to try to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 if you think it\u2019s realistic to run to Sweden to\nescape, I will give you some leads. He \u2014 he knew beca \u2014 from Riga, during his\nstudies, he had made contacts with \u2014 with Sweden.

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: So, I think the idea came first \u2014 we overheard from him, that he was with his\nbrother, he had a brother who was a very, actually nice supervisor there. He used to\nbe a teacher, and when the war started, they put him in the factory. So, he never\nliked, he was o \u2014 and he, that helped me \u2014 you see, I had the machine, I was working\nwith the machine. I all \u2014 always had little pieces of paper with German let \u2014 with\nGerman words. I was studying there, my language. So he used to come to me like a\nteacher, and then examine me. So, I think we overheard there was, then figured out \u2014\nout what do do with the workers, and that\u2019s when we dropped this Kiel idea. So said,\noh, yes, I think we \u2014 we will be sending some people, some of the workers, because\nthere they still have materials.",

        "A: Naively thinking that, you know, we can very easily \u2014 but before that, we\ncontinued to Flensburg, and from there to \u2014 we walked to Husum.",

So we had the basic papers fro \u2014 that Germans had given to all\ntheir workers. So that it \u2014 identification was there, but the fact that wet \u2014 we\u2019re\nsupposed to report to Kiel, that was not there. They \u2014 that did not know. So, is it \u2014\nno, you cannot \u2014 you cannot cross the border. So, they threw us out. So we \u2014 we\nwalk around, and we took our time, we walk around, and we \u2014 we go into like two or\nthree wagons, la \u2014 and we \u2014 and we \u2014 we walked there around, and we \u2014 we \u2014 we\nsort of jumped into \u2014 on a train that was already like moving out. But it \u2014 like in 15\nminutes we realized that it was not going to Denmark, it was going back to \u2014 to\nSchleswig, or \u2014 or another town, back to where you \u2014 we came from.",

So\nwe said, why don\u2019t we mix up with them?",
