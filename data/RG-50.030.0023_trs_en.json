        "Q: Will you tell me your name please?",
        "A: Kate Bernath.",
        "Q: Where were you born and when?",
        "A: I was born August 27, 1927 in Szikszo, Hungary.",
        "Q: Tell me about your family and and your life in Szikszo.",
        "A: Uh, I come from a family of three children. I had two brothers and I was the youngest, a\ngirl, and my father was a businessman and we were sort of middle-class Jews in town and,\nuh, I look back on my childhood as quite happy and, uh, even though there were a lot of\ndark clouds on the sky, we children were always protected and and, uh, shielded sort of and,\nuh, had quite a happy life. I, we thought so anyway. Until the... it really began to get bad\nand we started to hear all the the different rumors about, uh, what's happening all around us\nbut we thought that maybe some people are exaggerating it and, uh, it would never happen\nto us. We are loyal Hungarian citizens and, uh, nobody would harm us. Our father,\ngrandfathers fought for the country and, uh, and, uh, it's really just scaring us with these\nthings. But then in, uh, April, March actually, 1944, when the Germans came in, we had to\nput on the yellow star and Jews were not allowed to leave leave their houses actually and,\nuh, we were not allowed to travel, have businesses or go to school or do anything. I mean\nwe knew that it is happening. It is happening. And, uh, within a few weeks we were all\nrounded up and sent to a ghetto in, uh, the nearest bigger town named Kassa' where we\nwere in, uh, very bad circumstances already. No money was allowed to brought with, only\ncertain amount and we had to leave all our possessions at home. Just everybody was\nallowed, uh, uh, backpack of some little clothes and and no food and no money and then we\ndidn't, no, no future. Didn't know what's going to happen to us. As and surely enough, uh,\nwe were, uh, there four weeks maybe in the ghetto when the Germans took us out from the\ncountry.",
        "Q: Before we get to that, were you seeing a young man in the middle of all this?",
        "A: Oh yes. I, I was, uh, quite, uh, popular (laughter) and, and, uh, seeing we were ri...as I said\nwe had a very social life and, and, and very happy life in a way. When we were not, we\n' KoSice, Czechoslovakia.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ncouldn't go to, we couldn't go to, uh, the movies so we entertained ourselves at home. I\nmean we tried to make the best of a bad situation and, uh, this certain young man was, uh,\nmore attentive than others and (laughter) we sort of became semi-officially engaged. Uh, he\nhad to go off to the forced labor camp, but, uh, we promised each other that if we both come\nback, we going to get married someday. But that was, uh, a very iffy situation of course\nbecause you really didn't know what was going on, but but when you're young you don't\nreally think that way. Imean you don't really think you're going to die. You may say it, but,\nbut it doesn't feel like, you know, you don't feel it. You don't realize 1t what the word really\nmeans. So we (pause) going back to back going back to Kassa, one, one, uh, day the\nGermans brought in these, uh, wagons and we were rounded up, I think eighty of us in a\nwagon, old and young and and sick and, uh, crying and and, uh, even whatever little we had\nthey took away from us. No food. And the doors were locked on us and was, everybody\nwas looking out under little windows in the cracks which way we're heading, because\nnobody told us anything. I mean we, everything was rumored but no...nobody said you're\ngoing here or you're going there and we thought we're going to work. Everybody said, oh,\nyou're going to work so it's not the worst thing. We're going to work but, uh, my father sort\nof, uh, he was, uh, we called him a pessimist. (laughter) He he felt that he knew what that\nthat it's going to be terrible and, uh, he said that we're heading for the, out of the country. I\nmean because if we were going to work, they would have bring us to the other direction.\nThe trains would go to the other direction. And, uh, sure enough, in three days time--it took\nus, wait a minute, three days--yes, three days to arrive to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Tell me about that trip. What was the trip like?",
        "A: Well, you hardly could sit down in the wagons and, uh, and, uh, I don't even remember\nhaving any food. We must have some food with us but, uh, I don't really recall recall it.\nAnd, uh, some people were sick, really out of their mind, old people, senile people and they\nwere crying and yelling all night long and if somebody had to go to the bathroom, then then\nthere was a little, uh, little pail there, and everybody, men and women together, everybody,\nuh, seeing that you're going to the bathroom. It's, it was just so humiliating, humiliating and,\nand, uh, horrible. So all they can do is cry or pray or or or try to soothe each other and, and\nsitting down on the floor and and mothers with their children and, uh, resting in their heads\nin their lap and it was just an awful trip. And, uh, little did we know that at least we were\ntogether. As soon as we arrived to Auschwitz, uh, they were waiting for us. We didn't\nknow what Auschwitz was or where we were and was all of a sudden they opened the doors\nand these these, uh, men with, uh, striped uniforms started to drag us out and the Germans,\nuh, patrolling with their German Shepherds and and yelling, \" ; , schnell,\nschnell.\" Everything has to be done \"schnell\" all the time. And as soon as we got off, even\nour backsack what we could carry with us, uh, we tried to get it. They threw, they threw it\nall out on the side and we didn't need it anymore actually, but we didn't know that. And, uh,\nand men and women were separated right away. Separate lines. And, uh, when we were\ngoing in the lines, uh, this this, uh, German officer in a uniform, he was just telling which\nway to go for everybody, left or right. I remember him asking my mother how old she was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nand she said, \"Vierzig\" [GER: forty] That's all she was. And he sent her to the other side.\n(Crying) But at that point we thought we going to see each other yet. I mean we had no idea\nof, of, uh, what was waiting for us. And then they told us that you're going to see them\nlater, that you're going to see them at night. They're taking the young people to work and,\nuh, at night or or on the weekend you're going to be together.\nUh, first they asked for the twins, if we had any twins between us. I remember some who\nwere twins and they took them out and then they were asking for other occupations, uh, to\nstep aside. They wanted. The rest of us were marched to the bath, to, to take a shower, to a\nbath. We had to take all our clothes off and put them nicely in a pile when we come out to\nfind them, and they brought us into this huge room where the showers were overhead and\nthey locked the doors on us and, uh, and, uh, hot steaming water came out. Little did we\nknow that our parents got the same showers with the gas on. Uh, when we came out from\nthe showers we came out on the other door so we never got our clothes back, our shoes or\nanything. Even the last pin from my hair was taken out and, uh, we got a a dress, a grey\ncotton dress. No underwear. I got a pair of shoes which was three sizes too big on my feet,\nwooden shoes. And we were marched into a barrack where there were these, uh, so-called\nbleachers (ph) what we were sleeping, uh, lay ourself, uh, bunks. Twelve of us on one, so if\none turned around, all twelve had to turn. Uh, one bowl of, uh, soup without a spoon or cup\nor anything for the twelve of us, so each took one sip and and handed to the others. And,\nuh, these, uh, Jewish girls, uh, were Czechoslovak, from Czechoslovakia, were our\nBlockaltesters. They were the overseers. And they were telling us, tried to orient us of the\ncamp routine, what, how, what was waiting for us and they told us that, uh, you'll never see\nyour parents again. You might as well forget about it because they are already in the,\nmarched into the gas chambers. We just couldn't believe them you know in our wildest\ndream that that something like this could happen. We thought they were just, uh, being\nrude to us. They they wanted to punish us for, for not being here the same way like they\nwere for so many years already. And, uh, we just shrugged it off.\nWe we, but in the meantime they told us if there will be a selection, just volunteer,\nvolunteer for anything. Go out of here. This is a death camp, and, and, uh, the farther you\nget away from it the better it is. So happens after three days we were shipped, uh, the, the\ntransports were coming in day and night from Hungary. Actually I was in the first transport\nto leave Hungary to Auschwitz, and, uh, day and night they were bringing 1n people and\neven the gas chambers couldn't work fast enough for it, so they had to make room. We had\nto make room for the newcomers. We were sent to, uh, Cracow, P_aszow the Lager was\ncalled. It was the most horrible place on earth. I think it was worse than Auschwitz, even\nthough it had no crematorium. But we worked very, very hard there. Four o'clock in the\nmorning we had to get up to for Zahlappells, uh, counting of the rolls, and stay there for\nhours under the stars in our one piece of clothes and it was freezing cold. This was in May,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nbut it was in the mountains, and we had no clothes on and we had no food and and\neverybody was cold. And, uh, staying there after after the Zahlappell we were marched out\nto work. The camp was situated on a, on a mountainside and our work was to carry these\nbig wooden planks up on the steep mountain, that we we stood like three girls or five girls\non there, one of these big wooden plank and carried it on our shoulders up on the\nmountains. And, uh, German...of course like I said everything had to be done \"schnell\" and,\nuh, and, uh, they were coming with the German Shepherds to chase us to go fast. Now\nwhen you have a three size too big pair of shoes on your feet and the mud, and it's muddy\nand and go up on the mountainside, it's, it's terribly hard, and we were doing this work all\nday long. And by the time we came back home on the other side of the mountain, uh,\nsometimes the food ran out already. Uh, the last people didn't get any or or else we got some\nsoup with, uh, some barley, barley soup. That was our mainstay for three months, every\nsingle day. Barley soup.\nAnd, uh, lot of, uh, after a while we were issued some clothes because it was, like I said it\nwas very cold there in them. We had some sweaters and, and coats and by the time we\nrealized it, it was full of lice, this clothes. So, so whenever we could escape a little, hide\nfrom the work, our pastime was to kill the lice, the, the; 1t was, uh, we suffered a lot there\nfrom, from, uh, from the other people. From the other camp-mates who were, who were\nnot, uh, not good to us because they felt that we were, uh, spoiled or, or we just coming\nfrom, from our, our, uh, homes and they were already suffering for years and years and they\nthought we're not even Jewish, Jewish, uh, prisoners because you don't speak the language.\nWe don't belong. But nevertheless, uh, we settled down sort of a routine until until the\npartisans began to really raid on the, make a lot of raids around the camps and, and the front\nwas coming closer I suppose, so, so one day we were evacuated from there. And we were\nsent, we were sent back to Auschwitz.\nOf course we didn't know we're going there and this is, uh, uh, maybe a three-hour trip\nAuschwitz betwe...between Auschwitz and Cracow, the distance should be three hours. It\ntook us three days to get back in the hottest summer, August 5th I remember. Hundred and\nthirty us of us in one wagon. It was so hot that I remember one night I, I must have dozed\noff and I, the train stopped so I woke up and it was raining and water was coming down on\nmy head. I thought to myself I must be losing my mind because I know that we started out\nwith a covered wagon. How can it be raining? Until I found out that the humidity in the\nwagons was so high that 1t was coming down in drops from the ceiling. We had absolutely\nno water, no food, no air. After three days when we finally arrived in Auschwitz and they\nopened the wagon doors, we give thank God, thanks to God that we are in Auschwitz and\nwe're perhaps going to the gas chambers, and this will be the end of our journey. (Pause)\nUh, but we didn't go to the gas chambers. We went back to another lag...uh, camp. I think\nit was the C Lager they called it. And, uh, our, we were full of lice I told you, so our hair\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwas shaved. Before they didn't have time because usually when a transport arrives, the\nwomen are all shaved. Their hair is shaved off but when I first came there, it did...1t didn't,\nthey were such, in such a rush that they didn't, they didn't do it to us but when we fir...came\nback to Auschwitz, they shaved our heads which was good because we were full of lice, like\nI told you. And, uh, they tattooed me.\nThis was just another...we really didn't care at that point. We didn't think that that we, we,\nwe really ex...ceased to be human beings. We were just a number already but who care...I\nmean it was beyond us already. And, uh, in Auschwitz, in Auschwitz I didn't work. It was\njust a transport Lager alread...an an an experimenting Lager. We...we didn't have to work.\nBut, of course, the food was very, uh, skimpy and, uh, and also we had to stay in li...in, uh,\nZahlappell for hours long in the cold nights, so much so that I remember we used to, a\ngroup of us used to huddle together and keep each other warm. And, uh, I don't know. The\nrest of our times just, uh, went by, uh, without doing anything. Just...just waiting,\nand...and... and...and uh (pause) they kept saying, uh, there were constantly selections.\nSelections from us, but we didn't, uh, know where the selections were going. So everybody\nwas trying to avoid it. But nevertheless these, uh, inmates who were there a longer time\nkept telling us, \"Just try to get out from here. Because it's, uh...here it's, uh, the crematorium\nis always working. Uh, if...1f you go away, maybe you'll be lucky and, uh, survive.\" So one\nday, when there was a selection in our block, uh, I was together with a cousin of mine. We\ndecided that, uh, \"Let's...let's go for the selection.\" They needed five hundred girls for this\nselection; and, uh, I was the four hundred and ninety-ninth and she was the fifth...fifth...five\nhundred|th] to be selected. And there was two more girls with us--also cousins--who were\ncut off, and they remained in Auschwitz. They never came back alive. We were...we were,\nuh, really lucky ones. We were sent to, uh, a factory to work in Augsburg, Germany. Uh, I\nbelieve the factory belonged to Messerschmitt. That's what I was told. It was, uh, situated\non Ulmerstrasse in Augsburg; and it was not a concentration camp in the regular sense,\nbecau...we were locked up. I mean, we were not allowed to leave the buildings; but, uh, we\nwere living in the factory building. It was a huge L-shaped building and we were living in\none on one side of it with the Ger...with our German guards and, uh, we were working in\nthe other side of the building, so we never left the building.\nWe went through the basement, up to the other side to work and, uh, our food was a little\nbetter than if we were not working. And our guards were not hitting us like they were in\nCracow with the, with the leather--uh, I don't know what you call them--and there were\nplenty of beatings there and and so we were, uh, handled more humanely. Nevertheless, uh,\nwe were hungry constantly but, uh, there was five hundred of us. Five hundred Hungarian\ngirls and, uh, we were working hard for the Germans. The German civilians worked in the\nsame place but not together with us. Separate, separate departments. Uh, had a lot of air\nraids in those days in Germany. The Americans came constantly. Every night we could set\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nour clock by it that what time the air raid is going to be and we were happy about it. We\nwere glad. We were wishing they would bomb the place down and, uh, with us together\n(laughter) whatever but, uh, the Germans didn't--we had to go to the air shelters every night\nbecause the Germans wouldn't leave us up there. They were afraid we, we might signal the\nairplanes. One day there was a bomb fell on our courtyard and it never exploded. The\nGerman workers said that it's because the Jews are here. They, they already felt that they\nlost the war. Actually the Germans felt it. They knew it. But of course everybody was\nafraid. They were afraid. We were afraid. They wouldn't talk to us, uh, but, uh, they they\nthey knew that, uh, it's getting out of hand. Don't forget this was toward the end of the war\nand, uh, we tried we tried to do our work so we should sabotage a few of their airplanes but\nI don't know if it succeeded or not (laughter) but uh...",
        "Q: How did you do that?",
        "A: Well we were we were I was working in the they called it where our job was to,\nto these parts we were dipping into these chemicals so they shouldn't oxidize because when\nthey put them in the planes they're, you know, rusty, they're not treated, uh, good enough so\nwe tried to manipulate a little that 1t shouldn't be so good but I don't know. It was just a\nhope that maybe we did some good. And, uh, I don't know. Our, uh, German the, the\nHauptscharfthrer (ph) who was, uh, the after a while he became very mean and we, we\nheard rumors that his son was killed at the Russian front and he took his frustrations out on\nthe Jews of course and, uh, but we were, we were--uh, in the midst of all our troubles we\nwere trying to cheer each other up. If one was feeling very low, we, we tried to tell them,\nwe, we dreamed about things what we were going to do when we got liberated. We were\nall...we never thought for a minute, I never thought for a minute that I'm really going to die.\nI, 1t just did not sink in. I mean with all these horrors around me I, I always thought that we\nwere dreaming of, of things--when I got home I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that\nand I just want to see this, this war end and just live for the day when we see the Germans\ndefeated. And that kept us alive. Never to lose hope. If you lost hope that was the end of\nit. It was so easy in Auschwitz. All you had to do is reach out for the barbed wires. They\nwere electrified. We will not do them the favor. We said if they want to kill us, they'll have\nto kill us. We are not going to die (laughter) becau...because it's, it's, uh, if we knew that\nour parents would be alive or, or we said we, we, we fight. We can do it. We, we, we are\ngoing to stay alive.\nBut of course it, it became more and more heated the the war. It it, uh, to us, uh, middle of,\nbeginning of April we had to leave Augsburg because the bombings were unbearable and,\nuh, I suppose the factory shut down for whatever reasons. They, they put us back into the\nwagons and, and, uh, we were headed for wherever camp would take us and we were taken\nactually to several camps where they had no room for us. And finally we wound up, uh, a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nplace called Muhldorf. At this time we belonged to, we were under Dachau jurisdiction I\nsuppose. Uh, this, this belonged to the camps Dachau already and, uh, we stayed in, in\nMuhldorf. When we arrived there we saw people there who were in much worse shape than\nwe were. I mean they really looked, uh, walking corpses. And, uh, we had to go out to\nwork, uh, mostly these bombed out places. They took us to the town of Muhldorf I suppose\nand, uh, cleaning, uh, bricks of the house that were bombed out and uh ...the middle of the\narea was such a bombing... that my ...cousin was laying next. We were laying on, uh, on the\nground, uh, during the attack, next to a tree and and we couldn't see each other from from\nthe smoke. But, uh, nevertheless, we didn't care about the bombs. I mean we were happy\nthat there were bombings. One, uh, I just you, just didn't think about, uh, living or dying or\nwhatever may come or, or you were a fanatic just to see the Germans defeated. That's all\nwe lived for. And we knew it full well it, 1t will be done but the question was will we see it.\nWith all our dreams and our deep-down each and every one of us knew that they're going to\nkill us in the last minute. They're not going to let us live to, to come and testify. It was just\nby accident.",
        "Q: What happened to you?",
        "A: What happened to me? This Muhldorf, Muhldorf was evacuated. About six thousand\npeople altogether I suppose. I'm really not good at, uh, these things because I don't know. I\nwas just shoved here and I was shoved there. Nobody told me anything and, uh, and, uh, we\nwere in, as I said put into wagons again and, uh, supposedly, I heard rumors we were\nheading to Innsbruck which was, uh, exterminating pla...uh, Lager again to to finish us all\noff. But, uh, the Ger...the the front was over more, all around us, the fightings and, uh, there\nwere more important things for the locomotives than to transport us. So we were stranded\nfor days here and days there. I mean the train didn't move. We were just left, uh, left there\non the tracks. And, uh, one day, one day somebody noticed that all our guards left. And,\nuh, somebody, I don't know how, some man or broke out of their their wagons and opened\nall the wagon doors and they said, \"Uh, we have no guards. The war is over. You're free.\"\nLet's go wherever. So where should we go. You know, we were a group of, uh, girls\ntogether who were all the time sticking it out and, uh, finally we saw everybody is running\naway from the wagons. We started to walk. This was, uh, fields there and, uh, finally we\ncame to a farmhouse. Uh, came to this farmhouse. Uh, somebody who spoke German told\nthe German man there that we are from a neighboring, uh, concentration camp and we were\nleft on our own, and we were very hungry. Could he please give us something to eat? So\nhe said to go up to, for us to go in the back and, uh, he's going to try to find us something to\neat.\nA little later he came back and brought some, some food and no sooner we started to eat,\nthis SS soldier came with his machine gun pointed at us and tells to the German guy that uh\nJuden so and uh Raus, Raus, everybody. Raus. They brought these these, uh,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ntrucks. They rounded up all six thousand people back to the wagons, but it was beating and\nshooting and and, uh, it was just a terrible, uh, situation. On top of all there was a big\nthunderstorm and, and, uh, we were pulled back and and bleeding and, and, uh, wounded\nand pushed back into the wagons. No sooner we were back in the wagons, the American\nfighter planes came and started to bomb all around us. So much so that there were a lot of,\nlot of casualties at that point and, uh, and, uh, in the middle of the night finally the wag...the\ntrain started to move again. We, we were going to, to, uh, we were on our way. People\nwere crying and, and, uh, it was a hopeless situation. After a couple of days one night when\nwe were standing on the tracks, the, somebody opened the door and asked if we had any\nwounded or dead in our wagons, because they are from the Swiss Red Cross and we were\nliberated. We were near the Swiss borders. We couldn't believe it. We were so, so we\ndidn't care anymore and, uh, and, uh, the girls started to shout they're not moving out of this\nwagon anymore. Come what may, we're staying there. And, uh, so we stayed the night and\nin the morning we saw the American soldiers coming by with the trucks and, and, uh, and\nthey started to bring us some food and, and, and, uh, then we knew that that the war was\nover and this was May Ist, 19467\nand, uh, from then on and, uh, from then on, uh, they took us into a neighboring, uh, place\ncalled Feldafing which was, uh, it originally a Hitlerjugend camp. It was a beautiful place.\nIt was on the Starnbergsee. It's a big lake. And, uh, they they disinfected us. They took us,\ntook away all our clothes whatever we had. They gave us, they didn't have any clothes for\nus, So they gave us pajamas, whatever they could find and, uh, fed us and, uh, from then on\nit was, uh, much easier. But of course, uh, we didn't know what happened to our families\nand, and, uh, anybody around us and it's just, uh, you couldn't think. You couldn't, uh, do\nanything and it, it took many, many months before we became human again. It's, uh,\n(pause) I, I of course I skipped a lot of things over, over a lot of things which, uh, which\nwas, which was worse than the camp itself, all the dehumanizing, all the suffering, the not-\nknowing what happened to, to our loved ones, whether we're going to see them again or not,\nand our properties, without we're left without everything and anybody and and it was just a\nhorrible horrible experience. But uh....",
        "Q: Did you go, did you go back home?",
        "A: Yes, I went back home after after a good while because the transportation was very bad. I\nmean there was none. There was none, and we just had no way of, uh, turning. There was\nno papers, no money, no, no transportation. So I remained in this camp for, uh, three, four\nmonths I believe after the liberation. No, well in September, September when we heard\nthere were some trains going already back to Hungary. I went back to Hungary and I found\n* 1945,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthe brother who was already home. He was, survived the camps. My other brother who\nwas with him was killed in the last days of the war. And, uh, he was on one of these\nmarches uh--they were, they were together all the time and and, uh, and this younger brother\nof mine became sick so he was taken to another camp and my older brother thinking that he\nwas going to go that camp to be with my younger brother again, he went on this march and\nhe never came out from there, in the last days, yes.",
        "Q: Did you meet up with your fiance again?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Tell us about it?",
        "A: Well, he was, uh, waiting with open arms (laughter) and he was waiting with open arms,\nbut, uh, we were not ready to get married. I was, uh, there was no, uh, nothing and nobody\nand we really had to get ba...back to normal life to get adjusted. We, we didn't know what,\nuh, was happening to us. And, uh, but after a few months back in Hungary we, we felt that\nthis is not the, we could not live here any longer. All the feelings what was in us made it\nimpossible to, to readjust to life in Hungary. With all the hatred and all the non-caring what\nwe received from our Hungarian friends and neighbors, we just did not see life possible\nthere anymore. So we decided to try to get back to Germany and there, from there as\ndisplaced people we were going to be able emigrate either to Israel, uh, Palestine or\nAmerica.\nHe had relatives in America who wanted him to come here and, uh, so we went back. We\nbecame engaged in Hungary and, uh, started out on our journey and, uh, finally we got\nmarried in Germany in Leipheim . This was DP camp, and on the way we got of course a\nlot of help from Jewish organizations, mainly from Joint, United Jewish Appeal and, and,\nuh, UNRRA kept these camps open. Of course the life was very harsh in these DP camps,\nbut, uh, I suppose, uh, we had our freedom. Our freedom to go nowheres because actually\nnobody wanted us until finally the Congress passed an act in 1948 or 9 and we were allowed\nto come to America. And we're ever grateful because we found that, uh, we had a good life,\nuh, with all our memories and all the, even even more so because we appreciate it more,\nwhatever we got and, uh, whatever we achieved, uh, we are, we are allowed to achieve,\nwe're very thankful for 1t and we see the contrast, how people are. It was really\nunbelievable to us that, that it could happen that, uh, that, uh, of course the German people\npaid for, for their mistakes and everybody does for the mass hysteria what swept through\nEurope.",

        "A: Kate Bernath.",
        "A: I was born August 27, 1927 in Szikszo, Hungary.",
        "A: Uh, I come from a family of three children. I had two brothers and I was the youngest, a\ngirl, and my father was a businessman and we were sort of middle-class Jews in town and,\nuh, I look back on my childhood as quite happy and, uh, even though there were a lot of\ndark clouds on the sky, we children were always protected and and, uh, shielded sort of and,\nuh, had quite a happy life. I, we thought so anyway. Until the... it really began to get bad\nand we started to hear all the the different rumors about, uh, what's happening all around us\nbut we thought that maybe some people are exaggerating it and, uh, it would never happen\nto us. We are loyal Hungarian citizens and, uh, nobody would harm us. Our father,\ngrandfathers fought for the country and, uh, and, uh, it's really just scaring us with these\nthings. But then in, uh, April, March actually, 1944, when the Germans came in, we had to\nput on the yellow star and Jews were not allowed to leave leave their houses actually and,\nuh, we were not allowed to travel, have businesses or go to school or do anything. I mean\nwe knew that it is happening. It is happening. And, uh, within a few weeks we were all\nrounded up and sent to a ghetto in, uh, the nearest bigger town named Kassa' where we\nwere in, uh, very bad circumstances already. No money was allowed to brought with, only\ncertain amount and we had to leave all our possessions at home. Just everybody was\nallowed, uh, uh, backpack of some little clothes and and no food and no money and then we\ndidn't, no, no future. Didn't know what's going to happen to us. As and surely enough, uh,\nwe were, uh, there four weeks maybe in the ghetto when the Germans took us out from the\ncountry.",
        "A: Oh yes. I, I was, uh, quite, uh, popular (laughter) and, and, uh, seeing we were ri...as I said\nwe had a very social life and, and, and very happy life in a way. When we were not, we\n' KoSice, Czechoslovakia.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ncouldn't go to, we couldn't go to, uh, the movies so we entertained ourselves at home. I\nmean we tried to make the best of a bad situation and, uh, this certain young man was, uh,\nmore attentive than others and (laughter) we sort of became semi-officially engaged. Uh, he\nhad to go off to the forced labor camp, but, uh, we promised each other that if we both come\nback, we going to get married someday. But that was, uh, a very iffy situation of course\nbecause you really didn't know what was going on, but but when you're young you don't\nreally think that way. Imean you don't really think you're going to die. You may say it, but,\nbut it doesn't feel like, you know, you don't feel it. You don't realize 1t what the word really\nmeans. So we (pause) going back to back going back to Kassa, one, one, uh, day the\nGermans brought in these, uh, wagons and we were rounded up, I think eighty of us in a\nwagon, old and young and and sick and, uh, crying and and, uh, even whatever little we had\nthey took away from us. No food. And the doors were locked on us and was, everybody\nwas looking out under little windows in the cracks which way we're heading, because\nnobody told us anything. I mean we, everything was rumored but no...nobody said you're\ngoing here or you're going there and we thought we're going to work. Everybody said, oh,\nyou're going to work so it's not the worst thing. We're going to work but, uh, my father sort\nof, uh, he was, uh, we called him a pessimist. (laughter) He he felt that he knew what that\nthat it's going to be terrible and, uh, he said that we're heading for the, out of the country. I\nmean because if we were going to work, they would have bring us to the other direction.\nThe trains would go to the other direction. And, uh, sure enough, in three days time--it took\nus, wait a minute, three days--yes, three days to arrive to Auschwitz.",
        "A: Well, you hardly could sit down in the wagons and, uh, and, uh, I don't even remember\nhaving any food. We must have some food with us but, uh, I don't really recall recall it.\nAnd, uh, some people were sick, really out of their mind, old people, senile people and they\nwere crying and yelling all night long and if somebody had to go to the bathroom, then then\nthere was a little, uh, little pail there, and everybody, men and women together, everybody,\nuh, seeing that you're going to the bathroom. It's, it was just so humiliating, humiliating and,\nand, uh, horrible. So all they can do is cry or pray or or or try to soothe each other and, and\nsitting down on the floor and and mothers with their children and, uh, resting in their heads\nin their lap and it was just an awful trip. And, uh, little did we know that at least we were\ntogether. As soon as we arrived to Auschwitz, uh, they were waiting for us. We didn't\nknow what Auschwitz was or where we were and was all of a sudden they opened the doors\nand these these, uh, men with, uh, striped uniforms started to drag us out and the Germans,\nuh, patrolling with their German Shepherds and and yelling, \" ; , schnell,\nschnell.\" Everything has to be done \"schnell\" all the time. And as soon as we got off, even\nour backsack what we could carry with us, uh, we tried to get it. They threw, they threw it\nall out on the side and we didn't need it anymore actually, but we didn't know that. And, uh,\nand men and women were separated right away. Separate lines. And, uh, when we were\ngoing in the lines, uh, this this, uh, German officer in a uniform, he was just telling which\nway to go for everybody, left or right. I remember him asking my mother how old she was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nand she said, \"Vierzig\" [GER: forty] That's all she was. And he sent her to the other side.\n(Crying) But at that point we thought we going to see each other yet. I mean we had no idea\nof, of, uh, what was waiting for us. And then they told us that you're going to see them\nlater, that you're going to see them at night. They're taking the young people to work and,\nuh, at night or or on the weekend you're going to be together.\nUh, first they asked for the twins, if we had any twins between us. I remember some who\nwere twins and they took them out and then they were asking for other occupations, uh, to\nstep aside. They wanted. The rest of us were marched to the bath, to, to take a shower, to a\nbath. We had to take all our clothes off and put them nicely in a pile when we come out to\nfind them, and they brought us into this huge room where the showers were overhead and\nthey locked the doors on us and, uh, and, uh, hot steaming water came out. Little did we\nknow that our parents got the same showers with the gas on. Uh, when we came out from\nthe showers we came out on the other door so we never got our clothes back, our shoes or\nanything. Even the last pin from my hair was taken out and, uh, we got a a dress, a grey\ncotton dress. No underwear. I got a pair of shoes which was three sizes too big on my feet,\nwooden shoes. And we were marched into a barrack where there were these, uh, so-called\nbleachers (ph) what we were sleeping, uh, lay ourself, uh, bunks. Twelve of us on one, so if\none turned around, all twelve had to turn. Uh, one bowl of, uh, soup without a spoon or cup\nor anything for the twelve of us, so each took one sip and and handed to the others. And,\nuh, these, uh, Jewish girls, uh, were Czechoslovak, from Czechoslovakia, were our\nBlockaltesters. They were the overseers. And they were telling us, tried to orient us of the\ncamp routine, what, how, what was waiting for us and they told us that, uh, you'll never see\nyour parents again. You might as well forget about it because they are already in the,\nmarched into the gas chambers. We just couldn't believe them you know in our wildest\ndream that that something like this could happen. We thought they were just, uh, being\nrude to us. They they wanted to punish us for, for not being here the same way like they\nwere for so many years already. And, uh, we just shrugged it off.\nWe we, but in the meantime they told us if there will be a selection, just volunteer,\nvolunteer for anything. Go out of here. This is a death camp, and, and, uh, the farther you\nget away from it the better it is. So happens after three days we were shipped, uh, the, the\ntransports were coming in day and night from Hungary. Actually I was in the first transport\nto leave Hungary to Auschwitz, and, uh, day and night they were bringing 1n people and\neven the gas chambers couldn't work fast enough for it, so they had to make room. We had\nto make room for the newcomers. We were sent to, uh, Cracow, P_aszow the Lager was\ncalled. It was the most horrible place on earth. I think it was worse than Auschwitz, even\nthough it had no crematorium. But we worked very, very hard there. Four o'clock in the\nmorning we had to get up to for Zahlappells, uh, counting of the rolls, and stay there for\nhours under the stars in our one piece of clothes and it was freezing cold. This was in May,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nbut it was in the mountains, and we had no clothes on and we had no food and and\neverybody was cold. And, uh, staying there after after the Zahlappell we were marched out\nto work. The camp was situated on a, on a mountainside and our work was to carry these\nbig wooden planks up on the steep mountain, that we we stood like three girls or five girls\non there, one of these big wooden plank and carried it on our shoulders up on the\nmountains. And, uh, German...of course like I said everything had to be done \"schnell\" and,\nuh, and, uh, they were coming with the German Shepherds to chase us to go fast. Now\nwhen you have a three size too big pair of shoes on your feet and the mud, and it's muddy\nand and go up on the mountainside, it's, it's terribly hard, and we were doing this work all\nday long. And by the time we came back home on the other side of the mountain, uh,\nsometimes the food ran out already. Uh, the last people didn't get any or or else we got some\nsoup with, uh, some barley, barley soup. That was our mainstay for three months, every\nsingle day. Barley soup.\nAnd, uh, lot of, uh, after a while we were issued some clothes because it was, like I said it\nwas very cold there in them. We had some sweaters and, and coats and by the time we\nrealized it, it was full of lice, this clothes. So, so whenever we could escape a little, hide\nfrom the work, our pastime was to kill the lice, the, the; 1t was, uh, we suffered a lot there\nfrom, from, uh, from the other people. From the other camp-mates who were, who were\nnot, uh, not good to us because they felt that we were, uh, spoiled or, or we just coming\nfrom, from our, our, uh, homes and they were already suffering for years and years and they\nthought we're not even Jewish, Jewish, uh, prisoners because you don't speak the language.\nWe don't belong. But nevertheless, uh, we settled down sort of a routine until until the\npartisans began to really raid on the, make a lot of raids around the camps and, and the front\nwas coming closer I suppose, so, so one day we were evacuated from there. And we were\nsent, we were sent back to Auschwitz.\nOf course we didn't know we're going there and this is, uh, uh, maybe a three-hour trip\nAuschwitz betwe...between Auschwitz and Cracow, the distance should be three hours. It\ntook us three days to get back in the hottest summer, August 5th I remember. Hundred and\nthirty us of us in one wagon. It was so hot that I remember one night I, I must have dozed\noff and I, the train stopped so I woke up and it was raining and water was coming down on\nmy head. I thought to myself I must be losing my mind because I know that we started out\nwith a covered wagon. How can it be raining? Until I found out that the humidity in the\nwagons was so high that 1t was coming down in drops from the ceiling. We had absolutely\nno water, no food, no air. After three days when we finally arrived in Auschwitz and they\nopened the wagon doors, we give thank God, thanks to God that we are in Auschwitz and\nwe're perhaps going to the gas chambers, and this will be the end of our journey. (Pause)\nUh, but we didn't go to the gas chambers. We went back to another lag...uh, camp. I think\nit was the C Lager they called it. And, uh, our, we were full of lice I told you, so our hair\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwas shaved. Before they didn't have time because usually when a transport arrives, the\nwomen are all shaved. Their hair is shaved off but when I first came there, it did...1t didn't,\nthey were such, in such a rush that they didn't, they didn't do it to us but when we fir...came\nback to Auschwitz, they shaved our heads which was good because we were full of lice, like\nI told you. And, uh, they tattooed me.\nThis was just another...we really didn't care at that point. We didn't think that that we, we,\nwe really ex...ceased to be human beings. We were just a number already but who care...I\nmean it was beyond us already. And, uh, in Auschwitz, in Auschwitz I didn't work. It was\njust a transport Lager alread...an an an experimenting Lager. We...we didn't have to work.\nBut, of course, the food was very, uh, skimpy and, uh, and also we had to stay in li...in, uh,\nZahlappell for hours long in the cold nights, so much so that I remember we used to, a\ngroup of us used to huddle together and keep each other warm. And, uh, I don't know. The\nrest of our times just, uh, went by, uh, without doing anything. Just...just waiting,\nand...and... and...and uh (pause) they kept saying, uh, there were constantly selections.\nSelections from us, but we didn't, uh, know where the selections were going. So everybody\nwas trying to avoid it. But nevertheless these, uh, inmates who were there a longer time\nkept telling us, \"Just try to get out from here. Because it's, uh...here it's, uh, the crematorium\nis always working. Uh, if...1f you go away, maybe you'll be lucky and, uh, survive.\" So one\nday, when there was a selection in our block, uh, I was together with a cousin of mine. We\ndecided that, uh, \"Let's...let's go for the selection.\" They needed five hundred girls for this\nselection; and, uh, I was the four hundred and ninety-ninth and she was the fifth...fifth...five\nhundred|th] to be selected. And there was two more girls with us--also cousins--who were\ncut off, and they remained in Auschwitz. They never came back alive. We were...we were,\nuh, really lucky ones. We were sent to, uh, a factory to work in Augsburg, Germany. Uh, I\nbelieve the factory belonged to Messerschmitt. That's what I was told. It was, uh, situated\non Ulmerstrasse in Augsburg; and it was not a concentration camp in the regular sense,\nbecau...we were locked up. I mean, we were not allowed to leave the buildings; but, uh, we\nwere living in the factory building. It was a huge L-shaped building and we were living in\none on one side of it with the Ger...with our German guards and, uh, we were working in\nthe other side of the building, so we never left the building.\nWe went through the basement, up to the other side to work and, uh, our food was a little\nbetter than if we were not working. And our guards were not hitting us like they were in\nCracow with the, with the leather--uh, I don't know what you call them--and there were\nplenty of beatings there and and so we were, uh, handled more humanely. Nevertheless, uh,\nwe were hungry constantly but, uh, there was five hundred of us. Five hundred Hungarian\ngirls and, uh, we were working hard for the Germans. The German civilians worked in the\nsame place but not together with us. Separate, separate departments. Uh, had a lot of air\nraids in those days in Germany. The Americans came constantly. Every night we could set\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nour clock by it that what time the air raid is going to be and we were happy about it. We\nwere glad. We were wishing they would bomb the place down and, uh, with us together\n(laughter) whatever but, uh, the Germans didn't--we had to go to the air shelters every night\nbecause the Germans wouldn't leave us up there. They were afraid we, we might signal the\nairplanes. One day there was a bomb fell on our courtyard and it never exploded. The\nGerman workers said that it's because the Jews are here. They, they already felt that they\nlost the war. Actually the Germans felt it. They knew it. But of course everybody was\nafraid. They were afraid. We were afraid. They wouldn't talk to us, uh, but, uh, they they\nthey knew that, uh, it's getting out of hand. Don't forget this was toward the end of the war\nand, uh, we tried we tried to do our work so we should sabotage a few of their airplanes but\nI don't know if it succeeded or not (laughter) but uh...",
        "A: Well we were we were I was working in the they called it where our job was to,\nto these parts we were dipping into these chemicals so they shouldn't oxidize because when\nthey put them in the planes they're, you know, rusty, they're not treated, uh, good enough so\nwe tried to manipulate a little that 1t shouldn't be so good but I don't know. It was just a\nhope that maybe we did some good. And, uh, I don't know. Our, uh, German the, the\nHauptscharfthrer (ph) who was, uh, the after a while he became very mean and we, we\nheard rumors that his son was killed at the Russian front and he took his frustrations out on\nthe Jews of course and, uh, but we were, we were--uh, in the midst of all our troubles we\nwere trying to cheer each other up. If one was feeling very low, we, we tried to tell them,\nwe, we dreamed about things what we were going to do when we got liberated. We were\nall...we never thought for a minute, I never thought for a minute that I'm really going to die.\nI, 1t just did not sink in. I mean with all these horrors around me I, I always thought that we\nwere dreaming of, of things--when I got home I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that\nand I just want to see this, this war end and just live for the day when we see the Germans\ndefeated. And that kept us alive. Never to lose hope. If you lost hope that was the end of\nit. It was so easy in Auschwitz. All you had to do is reach out for the barbed wires. They\nwere electrified. We will not do them the favor. We said if they want to kill us, they'll have\nto kill us. We are not going to die (laughter) becau...because it's, it's, uh, if we knew that\nour parents would be alive or, or we said we, we, we fight. We can do it. We, we, we are\ngoing to stay alive.\nBut of course it, it became more and more heated the the war. It it, uh, to us, uh, middle of,\nbeginning of April we had to leave Augsburg because the bombings were unbearable and,\nuh, I suppose the factory shut down for whatever reasons. They, they put us back into the\nwagons and, and, uh, we were headed for wherever camp would take us and we were taken\nactually to several camps where they had no room for us. And finally we wound up, uh, a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nplace called Muhldorf. At this time we belonged to, we were under Dachau jurisdiction I\nsuppose. Uh, this, this belonged to the camps Dachau already and, uh, we stayed in, in\nMuhldorf. When we arrived there we saw people there who were in much worse shape than\nwe were. I mean they really looked, uh, walking corpses. And, uh, we had to go out to\nwork, uh, mostly these bombed out places. They took us to the town of Muhldorf I suppose\nand, uh, cleaning, uh, bricks of the house that were bombed out and uh ...the middle of the\narea was such a bombing... that my ...cousin was laying next. We were laying on, uh, on the\nground, uh, during the attack, next to a tree and and we couldn't see each other from from\nthe smoke. But, uh, nevertheless, we didn't care about the bombs. I mean we were happy\nthat there were bombings. One, uh, I just you, just didn't think about, uh, living or dying or\nwhatever may come or, or you were a fanatic just to see the Germans defeated. That's all\nwe lived for. And we knew it full well it, 1t will be done but the question was will we see it.\nWith all our dreams and our deep-down each and every one of us knew that they're going to\nkill us in the last minute. They're not going to let us live to, to come and testify. It was just\nby accident.",
        "A: What happened to me? This Muhldorf, Muhldorf was evacuated. About six thousand\npeople altogether I suppose. I'm really not good at, uh, these things because I don't know. I\nwas just shoved here and I was shoved there. Nobody told me anything and, uh, and, uh, we\nwere in, as I said put into wagons again and, uh, supposedly, I heard rumors we were\nheading to Innsbruck which was, uh, exterminating pla...uh, Lager again to to finish us all\noff. But, uh, the Ger...the the front was over more, all around us, the fightings and, uh, there\nwere more important things for the locomotives than to transport us. So we were stranded\nfor days here and days there. I mean the train didn't move. We were just left, uh, left there\non the tracks. And, uh, one day, one day somebody noticed that all our guards left. And,\nuh, somebody, I don't know how, some man or broke out of their their wagons and opened\nall the wagon doors and they said, \"Uh, we have no guards. The war is over. You're free.\"\nLet's go wherever. So where should we go. You know, we were a group of, uh, girls\ntogether who were all the time sticking it out and, uh, finally we saw everybody is running\naway from the wagons. We started to walk. This was, uh, fields there and, uh, finally we\ncame to a farmhouse. Uh, came to this farmhouse. Uh, somebody who spoke German told\nthe German man there that we are from a neighboring, uh, concentration camp and we were\nleft on our own, and we were very hungry. Could he please give us something to eat? So\nhe said to go up to, for us to go in the back and, uh, he's going to try to find us something to\neat.\nA little later he came back and brought some, some food and no sooner we started to eat,\nthis SS soldier came with his machine gun pointed at us and tells to the German guy that uh\nJuden so and uh Raus, Raus, everybody. Raus. They brought these these, uh,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ntrucks. They rounded up all six thousand people back to the wagons, but it was beating and\nshooting and and, uh, it was just a terrible, uh, situation. On top of all there was a big\nthunderstorm and, and, uh, we were pulled back and and bleeding and, and, uh, wounded\nand pushed back into the wagons. No sooner we were back in the wagons, the American\nfighter planes came and started to bomb all around us. So much so that there were a lot of,\nlot of casualties at that point and, uh, and, uh, in the middle of the night finally the wag...the\ntrain started to move again. We, we were going to, to, uh, we were on our way. People\nwere crying and, and, uh, it was a hopeless situation. After a couple of days one night when\nwe were standing on the tracks, the, somebody opened the door and asked if we had any\nwounded or dead in our wagons, because they are from the Swiss Red Cross and we were\nliberated. We were near the Swiss borders. We couldn't believe it. We were so, so we\ndidn't care anymore and, uh, and, uh, the girls started to shout they're not moving out of this\nwagon anymore. Come what may, we're staying there. And, uh, so we stayed the night and\nin the morning we saw the American soldiers coming by with the trucks and, and, uh, and\nthey started to bring us some food and, and, and, uh, then we knew that that the war was\nover and this was May Ist, 19467\nand, uh, from then on and, uh, from then on, uh, they took us into a neighboring, uh, place\ncalled Feldafing which was, uh, it originally a Hitlerjugend camp. It was a beautiful place.\nIt was on the Starnbergsee. It's a big lake. And, uh, they they disinfected us. They took us,\ntook away all our clothes whatever we had. They gave us, they didn't have any clothes for\nus, So they gave us pajamas, whatever they could find and, uh, fed us and, uh, from then on\nit was, uh, much easier. But of course, uh, we didn't know what happened to our families\nand, and, uh, anybody around us and it's just, uh, you couldn't think. You couldn't, uh, do\nanything and it, it took many, many months before we became human again. It's, uh,\n(pause) I, I of course I skipped a lot of things over, over a lot of things which, uh, which\nwas, which was worse than the camp itself, all the dehumanizing, all the suffering, the not-\nknowing what happened to, to our loved ones, whether we're going to see them again or not,\nand our properties, without we're left without everything and anybody and and it was just a\nhorrible horrible experience. But uh....",
        "A: Yes, I went back home after after a good while because the transportation was very bad. I\nmean there was none. There was none, and we just had no way of, uh, turning. There was\nno papers, no money, no, no transportation. So I remained in this camp for, uh, three, four\nmonths I believe after the liberation. No, well in September, September when we heard\nthere were some trains going already back to Hungary. I went back to Hungary and I found\n* 1945,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthe brother who was already home. He was, survived the camps. My other brother who\nwas with him was killed in the last days of the war. And, uh, he was on one of these\nmarches uh--they were, they were together all the time and and, uh, and this younger brother\nof mine became sick so he was taken to another camp and my older brother thinking that he\nwas going to go that camp to be with my younger brother again, he went on this march and\nhe never came out from there, in the last days, yes.",

And, uh, but after a few months back in Hungary we, we felt that\nthis is not the, we could not live here any longer. All the feelings what was in us made it\nimpossible to, to readjust to life in Hungary. With all the hatred and all the non-caring what\nwe received from our Hungarian friends and neighbors, we just did not see life possible\nthere anymore. So we decided to try to get back to Germany and there, from there as\ndisplaced people we were going to be able emigrate either to Israel, uh, Palestine or\nAmerica.\nHe had relatives in America who wanted him to come here and, uh, so we went back. We\nbecame engaged in Hungary and, uh, started out on our journey and, uh, finally we got\nmarried in Germany in Leipheim . This was DP camp, and on the way we got of course a\nlot of help from Jewish organizations, mainly from Joint, United Jewish Appeal and, and,\nuh, UNRRA kept these camps open. Of course the life was very harsh in these DP camps,\nbut, uh, I suppose, uh, we had our freedom. Our freedom to go nowheres because actually\nnobody wanted us until finally the Congress passed an act in 1948 or 9 and we were allowed\nto come to America. And we're ever grateful because we found that, uh, we had a good life,\nuh, with all our memories and all the, even even more so because we appreciate it more,\nwhatever we got and, uh, whatever we achieved, uh, we are, we are allowed to achieve,\nwe're very thankful for 1t and we see the contrast, how people are. It was really\nunbelievable to us that, that it could happen that, uh, that, uh, of course the German people\npaid for, for their mistakes and everybody does for the mass hysteria what swept through\nEurope.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Yes. We are, uh, I mean happy. Of course, we miss our families terribly and we, we never\nforget about them. We always talk about them. It's became part of our lives. No matter\nhow much we don't want to, whenever I get together with my friends or relatives, the\nsubject comes up. We always wind up in the concentration camps. But, uh, we somehow\nwe learned to live with it. I suppose it's, uh, some...uh, sometimes you don't believe it\nyourself that, uh, you really went through all this and you are, you, you still are a human\nbeing.",
        "A: Uh, what I want to add 1s that, uh, people should be vigilant all the time not to, not to think\nthat, uh, this really doesn't matter. All these all these, uh, hate mongrels what come up in\nthe world and and people, if they're not personally marked they think that it's nothing. It\nwill pass by. It will blow away. But, but if you let it go out of hand, then this, this can\nhappen. Also I want to add that never lose hope. Until there is life there is always hope. If\nI, if I wouldn't give two cents for my life. I, like I said, I always felt that no matter how\nmuch, uh, front we're going to put up, they, they at the end they're going to kill us. And and\nbut we did not give up hope. We didn't go around--I'm going to lay down and die. At the\nend, uh, some of us survived.",
