        "Q: Dr. Miller, could you please tell me your name, your name during the war, your date of birth,\nyour place of birth, and anything you possibly can about your childhood and your family.",
        "A: All right. I was born in Poland, October 16, 1923. My family name was Rosenblum, Eugene in\nPolish, it was Eugeniusz. And I grew up in the city of Lodz. Lodz was an industrial city. It\nwas used to be called Polish Manchester, of about 600,000 inhabitants. Today is about\n1,000,000 people. It was 2\u2122 largest Jewish community in Poland. It was inhabited by about\n200,000 Jews. It was a vibrant Jewish community. My parents came to Lodz after fleeing\nRussia. They were married in Russia. My mother was studying at the University in Russia.\nMy father fled Russia with my mother in 1923 during the Gurinsky regime.\nwhich was really the forerunner of KGB. They were arresting all the people who were by them\nthe . So my mother went to Lithuania, to the border, 1923, she was pregnant.\n, she\u2019s going to parents to wait for birth and my father crossed the Russian-Polish\nboundary and he was wounded by the way the Russians were shooting when they were crossing\nand arrived in the Polish city of Lodz. My mother joined him. There where I was born. I was\nborn in middle class family. My father . We lived in a very nice section of town.",
        "Q: Do you know the name of that section of town?",
        "A: Notobicuk 41. Well, at that point, I better tell you something about Jewish community in Lodz.\nIt was divided largely three different segments. The Orthodox Jews which occupied section of\ntown. They wore Hasidic garb. That was about 40% of Jewish people in Lodz. That was a\nlarge section of the working class people and that was substantial amount of the middle\nclass or upper middle class Jews who were rather prosperous and they lived, for lack of other\nwords, in the nicer part of town. Most of the people lived in apartments. In Poland, you didn\u2019t\nhave the , the land was too expensive so you have big apartment buildings. We had\nabout five or six room apartment and like all of the people who live in this section of town, we\nhave a maid, a live-in maid. We have a girl who came to cook and you always have somebody\nwho came to the door, no washing machine, ever so often and done the wash. I was attending\nprivate schools. I was going to Hebrew gymnasium. It was one of the few gymnasiums in\nPoland from which one could go straight to Polish University with government rights. We\ndidn\u2019t have to pass any exams. At the same time, when they issued the anfamatura which was\nprobably the closest to it in the United States is the regents exams that you get in New York.\nWhen they issue the certificate of completion. It was also recognized in the Hebrew University\nin Jerusalem and you could enter right away the University to pass a special\nexamination. There were three schools, they called it 1S' gymnasium and 2\" gymnasium. They\nwere just across from each other and there was a girls gymnasium. As I grew up, we participate\nmost, most of the children attended the school were members of Zionist organizations. At that\ntime, probably what organization you belonged, it wasn\u2019t determined by your political views\nbecause we were just teached at that time but it was determined by the shahim the\nrepresentative of the kibbutz movement, who was a better organizer was able to attract more\nchildren. I belonged to Hashoma Hatsayeer, although my parents were well off, it was left wing\norganization. Poland by itself, even before Hitler, was anti-Semitic state. When we were going\nto school, I remember very often we have to cross the so-called people university, and we went\nthrough a hail of stones thrown at us. I remember when I was growing up after the dictator of\nPoland died in 1935, who understood that Poland needed the middle class and Jews\nwere the middle class. They were the profession, they were the merchants, they were the\nmanufacturers. After he died, Poland became openly anti-Semitic. When I went to school, oh it\nwas about 15-20 minutes walk, I passed at least five or ten intersections and there was always\nscribble on the corner, \u201cJews to Palestine\u201d. So, since Poland was verantly nationalistic and they\nwere afraid of Russia, it bordered on hysteria how they were afraid of Communism. Jews, even\nfrom affluent home, just as a purpose of what they saw and the atmosphere 1n which they grew\nup, were drawn to left wing organization. And I find myself Hashoma Hatsayeer where we all\nrealize although we were children and I was fifteen and a half when the war started, we all\nrealize that there is no future in Poland. My parents wanted me to go to France, my father had a\nbrother over there who was manufacturer, a silk manufacturer, he felt he wanted me to go and\nstudy in France. Polish Jews were not admitted, there were some Polish University but there\nwere numerous clauses. Numerous clauses mean restricted quota for Jews. It was very hard to\nget, so most of the Jews went to a university town of Nance near Strasburg and they lost a year.\nThey learned French and they got the degrees there. I was slated to go over there. My\nchildhood was a happy one but we knew there was no future in Poland.",
        "Q: What can you tell me, was your family observant?",
        "A: Well, it was maybe in sense of American values. There was on big, great synagogue in Lodz.\nTo Orthodox Jews, it was probably worse than going to a reformed synagogue here. But yet,\nthe women were on the balcony, the men sit on the first floor and my parents attend the high\nholy days.",
        "Q: Did you keep kosher at home?",
        "A: Quasi kosher. Because of my grandfather, was quasi kosher. We are not a very observant\nfamily in the usual standards of Polish Jewry but still I went to Hebrew gymnasium and\nculturally we were very much Jews but quote, unquote emancipated Jews and not religious\nJews. My father belonged to Hartzerarde. In Hebrew this is . That was the\n. My mother worked as a volunteer for ORT which organization\nsupported the teaching of trades to the Jewish kids who didn\u2019t have the financial means to go to\ngymnasium. Not that many in Poland, a very small percent of children went to gymnasium.\nProbably, no more than five or ten percent. By Jews, much larger percent. I cannot put the\nexact percentage but most of the children did not finish gymnasium. This kids were trained by\nORT, they were in dire straits and so forth. Naturally, the religious Jews tried to educate their\nchildren in the religious schools, did not have government rights.",
        "Q: What language did you speak at home?",
        "A: My parents spoke Russian among themselves, that was the language they knew the best but they\nspoke fluently Polish. As a matter of fact, my father spoke fluently Polish, German and\nRussian. So did my mother. My mother also spoke French. But to me they spoke Polish. I\ndidn\u2019t know that much Yiddish. I don\u2019t know for the purpose of a background maybe, the\nZionist begged the parents not to teach the kids Jewish, to teach Hebrew. I went to Hebrew\ngymnasium. I learned Yiddish already from my father-in-law a little bit after I got married and\nin ghetto but no, no, we spoke Polish. We spoke probably Polish better than Poles because the\nway they were able to recognize that a girl which had Aryan look but was Jewish that she was\nJewish. Jews spoke pure Polish without any regional inflection. Almost every Pole had a little\nbit regional inflection. Our Polish was colorless or classic. So we spoke very well Polish. I\nliked the language. I don\u2019t like the people but I still like Polish literature, and so forth. But our\norientation was very much Zionist, because in our mind there was no other solution to the\nJewish problem in Poland but to immigrate; immigration to Israel, to Palestine was restricted so\nprobably most of us knew we would have to go to some countries but Poland\nwas not in our future. When the war started, I was fifteen and a half years old. Polish radio\nstarted to broadcast the third or fourth day of war, urgent appeal all men should go in direction\nof center of Warsaw which is about 120 kilos, that\u2019s from Lodz. Most of the men left. I went\ntogether with my father. We reached Warsaw before the Germans were able to lay siege around\nWarsaw. We lived through the battle of Warsaw. When I returned home, we were not allowed\nto have a maid. No gentile could work for Jew. But, we still had our apartment. I had a big\ndog, a Great Dane.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Rex.The dog was seven or eight years old at that time. I remember it was two or three weeks\nafter we returned. It was still probably middle of October or end of October. My mother took\nall of her jewelry except one small ring off of her hands and somebody knocked on the door.\nMy mother opened and a German, a German non-commissioned officer pushed the door open,\ngrabbed my mother\u2019s hand and tried to take the ring off. He didn\u2019t see the dog. The dog\njumped. The dog was 140-130 pounds Great Dane. He went to the floor and he went to his\nthroat. He pointed the gun at my mother and he told to me you won\u2019t take the dog away, Ill\nshoot your mother. I said \u201cput your gun away and I\u2019ll try to take the dog but don\u2019t move\u201d\u2019. I\ntook the dog away and he told my mother should take her coat, she is going to the criminal\npolice and he will charge that we instigated the dog to attack a German soldier. Well, my\nmother spoke very well German. She told, \u201call right, I want also to ask if the German soldier is\nallowed to act as common robbers if all that we have belongs to the German government, you\ncertain of the German government\u2019. Well, after long negotiations, my mother gave him some\nvaluables. He relented but I had to take the dog down and I had to tie him, that was a\ncontraption that was used to beat the rocks, clean the rocks and I had to tie the dog. And he shot\nthe dog. That was the first thing I lost. I was sick for three weeks. That was the first loss of\nsomebody I love. I loved the dog because I grew up with him. Well, things got worse. We\nwere ordered to put Stars of David, the yellow patches in the shape of the star. We wore one on\nthe left breast and one on the back. I said I\u2019m not going to put it on and I went out and I was\ncaught and I was very badly beaten. When I came home, I told my father that I wanted to go to\nRussia. At that time, to Russia occupied zone. At that time, Russia allowed every few weeks,\nthe people who come there divided demarcation line to cross Russia occupied part of Poland.\nMy father told me he doesn\u2019t have the strength or inclination to go. He said son, you might not\nrealize but to go to Russia 1s one-way ticket. You will be able to get in but you will never be\nable to get out. I fled from there. I'll take my chances with Germans. And that wasn\u2019t just my\nfather. To them the Russians were the occult Bolsheviks and this and they still felt the Hitler\nregime was aberration and whatever will happen, they\u2019Il survive the war and things return to\nnormal and they will live in free Europe. So they gave me some valuables and sent me off. My\nmother told me when I was leaving on my way to Russia, \u201cSon, take a good look at your\nparents. You will never see them again.\u201d And I went and I was an only child, 16 years old,\nnever away from home except when I went to summer camp. And these words, I could hear the\nwords in my ears to the entire way I reached the Russian boundary and they were supposed to\nopen the day before. I waited for about three or four days. I decided, well whatever is going to\nhappen is going to happen to me and my parents and when I returned, they were already in\nprocess of setting up ghetto. The ghetto, I think, was established in the first month, I don\u2019t\nremember the exact month, sometimes around April of 1940. The ghetto boundaries were\nalready established and the Jews were encouraged to move there. Nobody was moving. At that\ntime, the Russians had deported or repatriated rather, the German population from Latvia, from\nVolhynia, from the parts of Poland, in particle, they were mostly by Germans, in the states\nwhich Russia occupied after 1939 and they were given the choice of Jewish apartments as we\nlived in the nice section of town where one of the parents were to go. Two German officials\ncame and told us we had one hour and we could take whatever we could carry plus .\n(couldn\u2019t hear) to go, so we went. We were able to get a room in one of the two or three homes\nwhich had modern conveniences like water, flush toilets and so forth. The ghetto to which they\npress around 150,000 -- 160,000 Jews, was occupied before probably by 10,000 -- 15,000\npeople and that was the worst slums by looting. There were very few buildings\nwhich really resembled anything we know before we got the room in one of these buildings.\nThey closed the ghetto and in the beginning it was already no more horrors by the Germans,\nthere were no more beatings, there were no more shootings. The ghetto started to organize\nitself but almost from the beginning the rations of food became much smaller and we got\nprogressively less and less to eat. I didn\u2019t finish gymnasium before the war. I finish in ghetto.\nPolish didn\u2019t have right. They forbid Polish to have any kind of schools. They close all Polish\nschools. Somehow, they probably knew they were going to liquidate the population sooner or\nlater they pay no attention so schools open in ghetto so I finish in ghetto. What happen in\nghetto in beginning years, it was a slow starvation. The , aman in his early 60\u2019s, he was\na minor official in the Jewish community. He was active in Jewish orphanages. He never had\nchildren. He raise quite a bit of money for the orphans. He was one of the few people who\ndidn\u2019t flee when all the men left Lodz and went to Warsaw. When the Germans came and he\nwas there and they told him he 1s the alderman of the Jews. He started to organize Jewish life.\nThe men were already had their blood which he bought by the grave of his wife which was\nburied there. He was really widening up his ears. Evidently, all the power of the Germans was\nvested in him. He became absolute ruler of the ghetto and to us he seemed like a man that was\ndrugged with power On the other feeling of course was that if we are going to make useful our\nservices to the Germans, good part of the Jews might survive. No bodies even worst fears\nbelieved that the Germans would try to physically annihilate every woman and child. Well, he\nestablish schools. He started to establish so-called \u201carbisin\u201d, they were shops which\nmanufacture various things with the Germans farvartung with the Germans were the people\nwho administer the ghetto brought to the ghetto and they have a large number of people\nworking in the resorts and in exchange they were sending food to the ghetto. What I remember\nfrom now on, I was still young but was rather a shielded childhood and we grew up in a hurry.\nWhat I remember was hunger, terrible hunger. And it started very, very slowly by the people\nwho were middle aged. And I say people after 40, 45. They had started to deprive. More and\nmore you saw people who had swollen feet, swollen hands. The winters are very harsh in\nPoland and there was nothing to heat their apartments with or the rooms with. There was very\nlittle even wood or coal briquettes to be able to cook something. People were very hungry. A lot\nof them tried to crumble the bread and cook the bread and make a soup out of this so that\nphysically they could pacify their hunger pangs. But, they consumed a lot of liquid and the\nheart was not able to pump and the water settled in the feet and people started to die out. And\nwe had 60, 70 funerals a day. 50 funerals a day will be 1,500 people a month. That was in the\nbeginning. In the beginning, the funerals resembles more or less which were held before the\nwar but sooner or later there was only mass grave. Well, like a mass grave, one mount under\nthe other unmarked graves. My father was taken 1941 to Gestapo. They had the registers.\n(can\u2019t understand). He came very badly beaten and he died a few weeks later. I\nwas left with my mother. Things got even worse as far as the food was concerned. But yet the\nyounger people organize themselves, called Self-Help Organization. The morale was, well, we\nstill felt that we had a chance to survive. This had changed in 1942. In 1942, the runcoston\nhada assembly. It\u2019s 92, 50 years before and I still remember. He said to us, he\nstand before us as broken man, that he devoted all of his later years to helping orphans, he\norganized orphanages even un ghetto and he tried to give him as much resources to survive as\nhe could and yet he was ordered by the Germans that he was to deliver 24,000 Jews. Jews over\n60 years old and children under 10. He told us, you have a choice. Our police would take them\nand it would be dark in semi-orderly fashion or the Germans would come and take them and it\nwould be much worse. If we want to survive, the 100,000 Jews which at the point were locked\nup in the ghetto want to survive, they have to give up 20,000. Well, the chorus arise, no, no, we\nall go. And if the reaction was the people concerned to this, it was emphatically, no. Yet, they\ndeclare curfew and nobody was allowed out of their homes and the Jewish police went from\nhouse to house and there were some doctors among them and they make the selections. All the\nsickly people and the older people and the children were taken away. But what the Jewish\npolice did was not good enough for Germans and they came. Some people were shot. They\ntore the children from the mothers\u2019 arms. They beat the people. The mothers who resisted were\nshot on the spot. In most cases, the women remained frozen when the Germans took the\nchildren away. Only when the child was already on the horse drawn wagon, they realize what\nhappen, they start to chase and cry. Well, they took the 20,000, 25,000 people. And from then\non, almost every able -bodied man or woman or teenager or this, had to work. The food supply\ndidn\u2019t improve -- deteriorate, more and more. There was a lot of mismanagement, in ghetto.\nHe tried Rumkoski tried to store some of the potatoes, you know, which were supposed to be\nrationed to the population. And the whole thing, the entire crop got spoiled. In 1942, I think,\n1943, the Germans appointed Gertler, who was one of the collaborators in trying to extract as\nmuch valuables and this from the Jews, from the Germans, he appointed him head of the so\ncalled sondokommando. He tried to bring some order to the ghetto. In a way he did. He made\nthe thing look a little more efficient. In the meanwhile, more and more, the demand for more\nwere given and people were left in apartments. 3,000, 5,000, 10,000 and when\nyou walk the streets of the ghetto 1943, 1944 you saw, they used to call mussermench,\nbecause the people pattern of working and bending looked like a praying Muslim. The people\nbecame living skeleton, some of them were swollen, some of them looked like skeletons and\nyou could see a good part of the population was so emaciated that the war is not going to end\nsoon, they are going to die. Well, the ghetto lived until 1944.",
        "Q: What were you doing this whole time?",
        "A: I was working. I was working in the office of a sort of a shop getting my rations. In 1943, my\nmother died of starvation. She lost weight progressively and finally she was not able to walk\nany more. She stayed in bed constantly. (very low -- can\u2019t hear).",
        "Q: Had she been working?",
        "A: Well, she had been working until she got sick. She did ina shop. Then she got sick.\nShe got the typhoid fever. She got sick, she never recovered. She died. I was left alone. In\n1944, the Germans started to evacuate the ghetto. They ordered that people will report, about\n5,000 people a day, for deportation. Of course, they refused. So to give the order for\ndeportation. So the Germans took the enslight the head of the ghetto administration, went from\nshop to shop promising that people will go into Germany, living conditions would be better,\nthey will be better fed and so forth but nobody trusted him. People tried to avoid deportation as\nlong as they could. I left Lodz in August 23 1944. We didn\u2019t know where we go. Probably if\nwe would know where we go and what Auschwitz is, we would get vicious to board the trains\nand probably shot, but that would be at least passive resistance but we really didn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Had you heard about the camps at that point?",
        "A: Lodz ghetto was the most isolated ghetto in Poland. Every hundred feet you get a German\nguard. We didn\u2019t get no papers, nothing. Supposedly, few survivors from Chedno were able to\nescape but the population didn\u2019t know. We knew that clothes came back to the\nghetto from the people who were deported, the old and the sick people and people had\nforeboding that nothing good comes and they probably perish but they didn\u2019t know that\nsystematic extermination and this. Well, we boarded the train. There was hundred people in a\ncattle car in which we were transported. We went for about three or four days.",
        "Q: Can I stop you? I want to flip the tape over.\n(END OF SIDE A)",
        "A: All right. So, when we boarded the train, there were 100 people in our, whatever you call this,\nand what they gave us, there was one bucket which was supposed to serve if people wanted to\nrelieve themselves. There was no water. A little bit of food we took with. I think it took us\nabout four days out to reach Auschwitz. We came at night. We were allowed to take hand\nbaggage. When the doors opened, we saw people pointing to us looked like a fine striped\npajamas uniforms. But they spoke to us Polish and told us, \u201cplease leave all the things inside\nthe car. Just get out, get out, get out.\u201d Before we could do anything else, we form a line, we\nsaw a lot of SS running with the pistols and with guns, whipping people and we were marching\ntop a well lighted platform and Mengele was standing there and conducted the selection. And\nwith a flip of the hand, some went to the right, some went to the left. We had no idea what it\nmeans. I went to the right. They took us, they took all the clothes away, they shave us\ncompletely and they give us the striped uniforms and a number and we were led to a barracks.\nBarrack that were former quarters of Austrian cavalry from before WWI and when you slept\nover there you could lay down on one side but we were pressed so much that there was no place\nto turn around. I still have, 50 years, I have scars about size of half dollar because we were all\nbones at that time and laying and pressing, the bones were pressing against the wood and the\nthings got infected. I was about two weeks -- I wasn\u2019t in Auschwitz, I was in Birkenau.\nBirkenau was part of Auschwitz complex but there was, people didn\u2019t work over there. People\nwere either sent to the gas chamber, either sent out to other German concentration camps at that\ntime. You could see when we went to the barrack, the flames shooting and the block leader told\nus what it is, that the people from the selections are having appointment with their forefathers.\nWell, anyway, I was there for two weeks and I was selected and put into a transport and I met\none of my former classmates, Jerry Malikoff and we decided that we stick together. And we\nwere, together, almost to the end of the war. We were deported to the commander of\nDachau. That was a separate camps of Dachau. Dachau was much minor camp in\ncomparison. . There were just camps in which the Jews worked until they\ndropped dead and they send us more and more and more people.. I was in the lager 4 which\nwas I was in lager 11 which was , and we work on Commander Morris. All\nday we had to carry 50 pounds cement sacks from early dawn till it got dark and we always\ncarry number of people who died. If you couldn\u2019t work, they beat you to death. And we had to\ncarry the dead bodies back because they have to count every day. We stood on the appell platz,\nthat was the place where they counted the prisoners and the number of the prisoners had to tally,\neven if we stood late in the night. I was lucky for a short while to get the job . Then\nthey used us to take care of other prisoners. When you are sick, when you get your slice of\nbread you couldn\u2019t eat everything and there was a lot of bread left. At that time, I gained some\nweight but after a while the Germans got tired of it and they took away with the transport all the\nsick people, the block was liquidated and we went back.",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t too sick to leave, you recovered?",
        "A: That\u2019s right. At that time, I got infected feet and I got blood poisoning and they took me and\ndoctor , the physician was later -- he attended at our wedding. My wife went to\nnursing school and he was director of nursing school after the war. He attended our wedding\nHe told me, you come son, I have to amputate or you die. And they didn\u2019t have no anesthetics\nand he told me \u201cbut look, you\u2019ll be in pain but you\u2019ll faint\u2019. And few people put me on the\ntable, they help me and I just realize at that moment that they are going to take away the toes of\nmy foot. They are going to amputate, I\u2019Il be sent away to the gas chambers. So with all the\nstrength I have, I tore myself out and I run away. I run away and I went to the working detail.\nAt that time, I had no feeling in my foot and I must have stepped on a very sharp\nstone and it cut deeply but that saved me and the pus and everything started to drain. After the\nwar I still had operation and I had pieces of bone taken out of my toes but I survived this.\nWhen the Allies started to come in and they started to come in direction of Dachau from\nAusborg, which was miles away, they put us all on the trains. Then they started to gather all the\nprisoners into the main camp in Dachau, although we were probably no more than twenty, thirty\nmiles to Dachau, everything wass bombed, and I was in transit for about four or five days.\nThere was no water, there was no food. Some people went crazy and they drank their own\nurine. When my train came to Dachau, they unloaded boxcar. They unloaded\nmy boxcar. That was the last boxcar they unloaded. There were more dead than alive and when\nthe American army came two days later, they found the entire train, say the first five boxcars,\nboxcars full of dead prisoners. Well, and what the Americans done -- they put us. I was in the\nhospital for quite a few months and I decided to go back to Poland to see if anyone had\nsurvived. We had, during the war, when we knew that they are going to take our apartment\naway, that sooner or later we had to move to ghetto, we had neighbors. Their name was\nMitchelene, they were Poles. He was, the father of the man was Italian and the mother was\nPolish but they lived in Poland and we knew them very, very well. As a matter of fact, the\nwoman was carrying , my mother was carrying her . I knew the people\nfor fourteen years, from the time I moved in the house to the time I was deported. My mother\ntook all the crystals, all the china, all the silver up to them and said, \u201cLook, I doubt if we will\nget alive from the ghetto. That\u2019s all yours.\u201d We survived. We didn\u2019t expect. Well, I went over\nthere when I came. I went with the transport to Poland, Polish transport of course, repatriated to\nPoland, it was very easy to get on the train. I came over there, I went on the tenth floor. I\nknocked on the door. A woman opened the door and she tried to slam in my face. \u201cWe have\nnothing, we have nothing.\u201d I was just able to hold the door open and I said \u201clook, I don\u2019t want\nnothing from you. I came from Auschwitz and I saw the silver and the money and the crystals\nall mingled with blood. All I want to know, did somebody from my family, my cousins, did\nsurvive, look for me\u201d. She said \u201cnobody\u201d and she slammed the door in my face. I was three\ndays in Poland and didn\u2019t find nobody and went back. In the beginning, the liberated prisoners\nwho were in Munich, which is twenty miles from Dachau but I north to\nFrankfort on Meine and opened and I enrolled . (Couldn\u2019t\nunderstand him).university and started to study pharmacy. I got married in 1948. My wife was\nin nursing school at that time. We came here. Well, my story is for all the people who came\ndisplaced persons, who came to this country. We worked for a couple of years and then I went\nback to school. I got my PhD from medical school from the University of Chicago and came to\nWashington, started with the government. For the last ten years before retirement, I directed the\nresearch department that was the only large animal where my\nmedical research was conducted. I retired in 1989.",

        "A: You mean from before?",
        "Q: Before the war, during the war, episodes that stand out? I know you told me a number of them.",
        "A: Episodes that stands in my mind was the deportation in 1942. It was a nightmare. The cries of\nthe people; the children torn from the mother\u2019s arms. The old people who went in such a\nresigned way, with the look in their eyes -- they know that that\u2019s their last trip. They didn\u2019t\nknow what\u2019s going to happen to them. But they knew that that\u2019s the end. That was one. The\nsecond was the shock of coming to Auschwitz. The selection. The realization. The flames that\nwere shooting toward the sky when we were told that all the people who went to the left side\nwere selected by Mengele. This probably I remember still most deeply. I saw Mengele for\nabout ten minutes. Pass the line until I pass him by. I probably, if he would look like he looked\nthen, I would recognize him immediately. The other thing which I remember was the will to\nlive. People wanted to survive. People wanted to survive. They wanted to tell the story. We\nnever believed at that time that the world really know what\u2019s happening to us. People were\nclinging to their lives and they wanted to preserve something. The other thing, I never attended\nsynagogue till my daughter was born and she was about six or seven years old, we lived in\nChicago. One day, , she came \u201cDaddy, Daddy, look, sisters are coming\u201d\u2019. I said what\nare you mumbling, what sisters? I look and I saw two nuns. And I said, \u201cJudy, tomorrow you\ngo to Sunday School.\u201d And I took her to Sunday school. But it took years for us to reconcile\nand regain some kind of emotional balance although we are outwardly very, very well balanced,\nbut the whole coming to the United States, trying to work, trying to get degree. Well,\npeople were really subconsciously trying to do, they try to do that many things, that they went\nfinally to sleep, they collapse. There was no time to think. It was, I don\u2019t know, I know there\nwas no neurotic drive, only that there was self- preservation. But people tried, not to forget, but\npeople simply were haunted. It was almost in everybody\u2019s mind, the question, people question\n\u201cWhy did I survive? Why didn\u2019t the other one survive?\u201d And you know what was probably the\nmost painful question was when you talk to people and they didn\u2019t meant nothing. We did hear,\njust very innocently asking, \u201cWhy and how did you survive?\u201d We couldn\u2019t -- it helped them.\nWe couldn\u2019t answer the question ourselves but people felt guilty without being able to explain\nto themselves that they are not guilty of nothing and it took number of years. It took quite a few\nyears until, you know, the children came and life went on, and we\u2019re young and the things\nwhich happened receded and accepting from God then, life went on and we raised\nfamilies and we became part of American society. And I hope we contributed.",
        "Q: From what I can see, you certainly have.",
        "A: When I finished, I had around seventy or eighty papers and presentations on my city.",
        "Q: Amazing. Can I ask you one specific question that you made a reference earlier to that you\nwent to summer camp as a child, was that a Zionist summer camp?",
        "A: That was school camp. Well, it was a Zionist, not be definition, it was Zionist by what\npermeated. I remember as children we made the campfires and we stood and we sang Hebrew\nZionist songs, yes, yes. It was not a Zionist organized, but culturally it was a Zionist camp.",
        "Q: Thanks. Can we go on, would you mind talking a little bit about your mother now? Can we do\nthat?",
        "A: Yes, sure. My mother, like most of the women in the middle class, around a hundred middle\nclass families, didn\u2019t work. She was active, she was active in Jewish life. She traveled. As a\nmatter of fact, my mother was in the United States attending the World Fair in 1939. She came\nto see her brothers. When she returned to Poland two weeks before the war started, her brother\nbegged her to stay but you know, she said \u201clook, I have a child and my husband over there.\u201d\nWhen she crossed Germany, the train was seeing, nobody could get, you know, she just\ntransited into Germany, into Poland. If the war had broken out two weeks earlier, I would still\nhave probably my mother alive. I remember in 1938, Germans expelled the Jews who were\nonce Polish citizens. We were not at that far from the border. Lodz, I don\u2019t know, maybe two,\nthree hundred miles from the border, from the western border in Germany. We kept a young\nboy and I shared the room for a while, I don\u2019t remember, for half a year.",
        "Q: He came and lived with you?",
        "A: Yes. The Jewish community took the children and then his parents came and took him away.\nThey got situated. The brothers of my mother tried to talk us into leaving Poland and coming to\nthe States but my father was a metal agent at that time. We had , We were very, very\nfinancially comfortable and he felt, his reasoning was, I don\u2019t know the language, you can take\nno money out of Poland. You could just go as you were. What am I going to do over there?\nAnd he didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t want to go and they paid with their lives, my parents.",
        "Q: Can we go back, do you know your mother\u2019s birth date by any chance? Anything, the town\nwhere she came from?",
        "A: Oh, yes. My mother came -- just a second. Yes, my mother was about 23 when I was born so\nshe was born probably around 1900. She lived in a small town in Lithuania, Batinia, Lithuania.\nMy grandfather was very well to do. He owned quite a bit of land. He owned a sawmill. He\nowned a flourmill ad my grandparents sent us packages in 1941 to the ghetto from Lithuania.\nThe packages reached the ghetto. They were killed -- the Lithuanians killed them even before\nthe Germans. In the two to three days when the Russians pulled away and before the Germans\noccupied physically the town, the entire Jewish population was finished.",
        "Q: Do you know about your mother\u2019s education?",
        "A: My mother attended the university, in Russia . She was interned a year",
        "Q: What was she studying?",
        "A: Languages.",
        "Q: What about the Jewish life in her home? Were they observant?",
        "A: Oh, yes, oh yes. My mother\u2019s family certain was more, they were not Hasidic, but they were\nmore observant. Entire generation, my grandparents were much more observant. My dad\u2019s\nfather was much more observant than we were. But you have to understand one thing. My\nparents went through WW1. They lived already under the communist regime for a while, for a\nfew years before they were able to extricate themselves from Russia. And probably just like\ntoday\u2019s generation of the people veer from the strict religious practices of their parents, they\nveer from the strict religious practices of their parents. In other words, the meat was kosher still\nat home but when we ate dinner, we could have coffee or tea with milk, you know. It was\nkosher but not in the strictest sense of this. We had two sets of dishes and so forth. I remember,\nI went for Rosh Hashonah and Yom Kippur with my dad to the synagogue.",
        "Q: For Shabbat, you would work on Shabbat?",
        "A: Well, there were candles. There were candles at home but you took the streetcar. My father\nrode the car, he had a car which was in Poland, there were not too many cars but he had a car.\nShabbat was much more a tradition than a religious observance. We never went for Sabbath\nday and Friday services. The synagogue was quite a distance from where we lived and it was\nthe only one big synagogue in Lodz. Our home was a Zionist home, much more than\na religious home.",
        "Q: I understand. I was just asking. Can you tell me something more about your mother\u2019s\npersonality? Anything you can remember?",
        "A: She was young and she was full of life. My mother played beautiful violin. She was not a\nconcert violinist but I remember her playing for her friends and so forth. She got active with\nseveral of her friends. I\u2019ve got a large family. All three sisters of my mother and they got\nchildren, they are my cousins. From the entire family, that\u2019s what I went to look for, I\u2019m the\nonly survivor. She had two brothers in this country. One of them, we took the name of my\nuncle in L.A.",
        "Q: He sponsored you to come here?",
        "A: Yes, but when we came here, it is hard to explain. The only thing what we were able to salvage\nfrom the old country was the . I remember we came to Chicago and I already got\nmy job. I started very low class, then I got into the lab. When I got in touch with my uncle,\nwhen he called, my wife\u2019s on the phone. All he wanted to know, if she\u2019s Jewish. After talking\nto her, my wife left Chicago, she was at NIH, at the time she worked as a nurse. My wife has\nwe have a large home in L.A. Why don\u2019t you come out, you will live with us, I'll put\nmy nephew on the payroll ad he could go to school. When I came my wife was almost ready to\npack. And I told her look. He has two children. In spite of what he said, the kids will say that a\npair of refugees came and moved smack into our parent\u2019s home.\u201d I said you cannot have it both\nways. If you want to be independent you have to stay independent. I went to visit my uncle.\nThey were very nice to me. When I was going to school for every Jewish holiday and Christian\nholiday, he sent me $100 check and he tried to do it in a quiet sort of way. And it helped, at that\ntime it helped. But what we did, we did on our own. We pulled ourselves up.",
        "Q: Have you tried to find out about family members?",
        "A: I wrote them a letter. I remember my father-in-law was a very, very bitter man. He never\nreconciled himself to what happened. He just could not reconcile that people have wives,\nfamily and this, you know, and his wife perish and his mother perish. I was younger, but we\nwere also bitter at that time. We\u2019re not bitter at nobody in particular. I wrote them a letter and I\nsaid \u201clook, I\u2019m at the university, I\u2019m studying, I\u2019m not asking for nothing, I don\u2019t need nothing\nbut you are entitled to know what happened to your family.\u201d And I wrote it. And the answer\nwas \u201cLook you never asked us for nothing, we didn\u2019t refuse you nothing.\u201d They couldn\u2019t\nunderstand probably , why the letters were so bitter. When I came here, you see\nthis is the difference probably between the immigration, between the displaced persons who\ncame here at that time. We spent very little, just wanted a chance. Russian Jews, and I quite\nactive now with Russian Jews, they expect much more. They expect much from society. We\nwere so disillusioned, that we didn\u2019t expect nothing from nobody. But, yes, I have contact with\nthem, but I lived in Chicago, they lived in L.A. I saw them a few times. As a matter of fact\nwhen I got out from undergraduate school in Annapolis, his wife came to my graduation. My\nwife has a family in Chicago. They showed us when we came. They are not wealthy\npeople but the children were pretty well off. They\u2019re professionals and we got quite close to\nthem. We finally realized that they tried to be family to us and we integrated\n(couldn\u2019t hear) into the family.",
        "Q: So you still have other cousins?",
        "A: Oh, yeah, we still go to the weddings and Bar Mitzvahs and to this and that. Yes, these cousins\n. (voice faded out).",
        "Q: Is there anything else you would like to add about your mother? Either about her personality or\nanything else you might know. If I\u2019m going to write this, I\u2019d like to know a little more about\nher youth or anything you know about it.",
        "A: I was, you know, I was very much of a child before the war. I know my mother was a very out-\ngoing person. She was quite well --, fora woman were after WW1, quite well educated. She\nwas very musical. She attended and she liked concerts and this. She traveled a lot. Every\nsummer she was traveling in Italy and Yugoslavia and this. While I was in summer camp, she\nwas traveling.",
        "Q: With your father?",
        "A: My father joined her but not for that much because he has in the business, the factory.\nYes, but, so she was well traveled. Spoke languages, was active in the Jewish life. She was a\nvery good-looking woman, she was tall.",
        "Q: Do you know what year your parents married?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. They married in 1922. She was pregnant in 1923. (speaking very fast)\nbecause she joined my father.",
        "Q: Did they meet in university?",
        "A: No. My father was in Moscow when my mother started and he already had his own business.\nAnd he married my mother and they decided, he lost his business in the revolution but they\nrealized that they are probably going to be arrested as a part of the campaign against the\nmerchants and this of the in Russia, they decided to flee and thy fled. My grandfather\nalso fled but he fled to but he fled a year later. All my uncles, the brothers of my\nfather, also left Russia and they also settled in Lodz. I have a large family. It was a family of\nabout seventy or eighty people and I am the only survivor.",
        "Q: Did you spend a lot of time with them?",

    "answers": [
        "A: All right. I was born in Poland, October 16, 1923. My family name was Rosenblum, Eugene in\nPolish, it was Eugeniusz. And I grew up in the city of Lodz. Lodz was an industrial city. It\nwas used to be called Polish Manchester, of about 600,000 inhabitants. Today is about\n1,000,000 people. It was 2\u2122 largest Jewish community in Poland. It was inhabited by about\n200,000 Jews. It was a vibrant Jewish community. My parents came to Lodz after fleeing\nRussia. They were married in Russia. My mother was studying at the University in Russia.\nMy father fled Russia with my mother in 1923 during the Gurinsky regime.\nwhich was really the forerunner of KGB. They were arresting all the people who were by them\nthe . So my mother went to Lithuania, to the border, 1923, she was pregnant.\n, she\u2019s going to parents to wait for birth and my father crossed the Russian-Polish\nboundary and he was wounded by the way the Russians were shooting when they were crossing\nand arrived in the Polish city of Lodz. My mother joined him. There where I was born. I was\nborn in middle class family. My father . We lived in a very nice section of town.",
        "A: Notobicuk 41. Well, at that point, I better tell you something about Jewish community in Lodz.\nIt was divided largely three different segments. The Orthodox Jews which occupied section of\ntown. They wore Hasidic garb. That was about 40% of Jewish people in Lodz. That was a\nlarge section of the working class people and that was substantial amount of the middle\nclass or upper middle class Jews who were rather prosperous and they lived, for lack of other\nwords, in the nicer part of town. Most of the people lived in apartments. In Poland, you didn\u2019t\nhave the , the land was too expensive so you have big apartment buildings. We had\nabout five or six room apartment and like all of the people who live in this section of town, we\nhave a maid, a live-in maid. We have a girl who came to cook and you always have somebody\nwho came to the door, no washing machine, ever so often and done the wash. I was attending\nprivate schools. I was going to Hebrew gymnasium. It was one of the few gymnasiums in\nPoland from which one could go straight to Polish University with government rights. We\ndidn\u2019t have to pass any exams. At the same time, when they issued the anfamatura which was\nprobably the closest to it in the United States is the regents exams that you get in New York.\nWhen they issue the certificate of completion. It was also recognized in the Hebrew University\nin Jerusalem and you could enter right away the University to pass a special\nexamination. There were three schools, they called it 1S' gymnasium and 2\" gymnasium. They\nwere just across from each other and there was a girls gymnasium. As I grew up, we participate\nmost, most of the children attended the school were members of Zionist organizations. At that\ntime, probably what organization you belonged, it wasn\u2019t determined by your political views\nbecause we were just teached at that time but it was determined by the shahim the\nrepresentative of the kibbutz movement, who was a better organizer was able to attract more\nchildren. I belonged to Hashoma Hatsayeer, although my parents were well off, it was left wing\norganization. Poland by itself, even before Hitler, was anti-Semitic state. When we were going\nto school, I remember very often we have to cross the so-called people university, and we went\nthrough a hail of stones thrown at us. I remember when I was growing up after the dictator of\nPoland died in 1935, who understood that Poland needed the middle class and Jews\nwere the middle class. They were the profession, they were the merchants, they were the\nmanufacturers. After he died, Poland became openly anti-Semitic. When I went to school, oh it\nwas about 15-20 minutes walk, I passed at least five or ten intersections and there was always\nscribble on the corner, \u201cJews to Palestine\u201d. So, since Poland was verantly nationalistic and they\nwere afraid of Russia, it bordered on hysteria how they were afraid of Communism. Jews, even\nfrom affluent home, just as a purpose of what they saw and the atmosphere 1n which they grew\nup, were drawn to left wing organization. And I find myself Hashoma Hatsayeer where we all\nrealize although we were children and I was fifteen and a half when the war started, we all\nrealize that there is no future in Poland. My parents wanted me to go to France, my father had a\nbrother over there who was manufacturer, a silk manufacturer, he felt he wanted me to go and\nstudy in France. Polish Jews were not admitted, there were some Polish University but there\nwere numerous clauses. Numerous clauses mean restricted quota for Jews. It was very hard to\nget, so most of the Jews went to a university town of Nance near Strasburg and they lost a year.\nThey learned French and they got the degrees there. I was slated to go over there. My\nchildhood was a happy one but we knew there was no future in Poland.",
        "A: Well, it was maybe in sense of American values. There was on big, great synagogue in Lodz.\nTo Orthodox Jews, it was probably worse than going to a reformed synagogue here. But yet,\nthe women were on the balcony, the men sit on the first floor and my parents attend the high\nholy days.",
        "A: Quasi kosher. Because of my grandfather, was quasi kosher. We are not a very observant\nfamily in the usual standards of Polish Jewry but still I went to Hebrew gymnasium and\nculturally we were very much Jews but quote, unquote emancipated Jews and not religious\nJews. My father belonged to Hartzerarde. In Hebrew this is . That was the\n. My mother worked as a volunteer for ORT which organization\nsupported the teaching of trades to the Jewish kids who didn\u2019t have the financial means to go to\ngymnasium. Not that many in Poland, a very small percent of children went to gymnasium.\nProbably, no more than five or ten percent. By Jews, much larger percent. I cannot put the\nexact percentage but most of the children did not finish gymnasium. This kids were trained by\nORT, they were in dire straits and so forth. Naturally, the religious Jews tried to educate their\nchildren in the religious schools, did not have government rights.",
        "A: My parents spoke Russian among themselves, that was the language they knew the best but they\nspoke fluently Polish. As a matter of fact, my father spoke fluently Polish, German and\nRussian. So did my mother. My mother also spoke French. But to me they spoke Polish. I\ndidn\u2019t know that much Yiddish. I don\u2019t know for the purpose of a background maybe, the\nZionist begged the parents not to teach the kids Jewish, to teach Hebrew. I went to Hebrew\ngymnasium. I learned Yiddish already from my father-in-law a little bit after I got married and\nin ghetto but no, no, we spoke Polish. We spoke probably Polish better than Poles because the\nway they were able to recognize that a girl which had Aryan look but was Jewish that she was\nJewish. Jews spoke pure Polish without any regional inflection. Almost every Pole had a little\nbit regional inflection. Our Polish was colorless or classic. So we spoke very well Polish. I\nliked the language. I don\u2019t like the people but I still like Polish literature, and so forth. But our\norientation was very much Zionist, because in our mind there was no other solution to the\nJewish problem in Poland but to immigrate; immigration to Israel, to Palestine was restricted so\nprobably most of us knew we would have to go to some countries but Poland\nwas not in our future. When the war started, I was fifteen and a half years old. Polish radio\nstarted to broadcast the third or fourth day of war, urgent appeal all men should go in direction\nof center of Warsaw which is about 120 kilos, that\u2019s from Lodz. Most of the men left. I went\ntogether with my father. We reached Warsaw before the Germans were able to lay siege around\nWarsaw. We lived through the battle of Warsaw. When I returned home, we were not allowed\nto have a maid. No gentile could work for Jew. But, we still had our apartment. I had a big\ndog, a Great Dane.",
        "A: Rex.The dog was seven or eight years old at that time. I remember it was two or three weeks\nafter we returned. It was still probably middle of October or end of October. My mother took\nall of her jewelry except one small ring off of her hands and somebody knocked on the door.\nMy mother opened and a German, a German non-commissioned officer pushed the door open,\ngrabbed my mother\u2019s hand and tried to take the ring off. He didn\u2019t see the dog. The dog\njumped. The dog was 140-130 pounds Great Dane. He went to the floor and he went to his\nthroat. He pointed the gun at my mother and he told to me you won\u2019t take the dog away, Ill\nshoot your mother. I said \u201cput your gun away and I\u2019ll try to take the dog but don\u2019t move\u201d\u2019. I\ntook the dog away and he told my mother should take her coat, she is going to the criminal\npolice and he will charge that we instigated the dog to attack a German soldier. Well, my\nmother spoke very well German. She told, \u201call right, I want also to ask if the German soldier is\nallowed to act as common robbers if all that we have belongs to the German government, you\ncertain of the German government\u2019. Well, after long negotiations, my mother gave him some\nvaluables. He relented but I had to take the dog down and I had to tie him, that was a\ncontraption that was used to beat the rocks, clean the rocks and I had to tie the dog. And he shot\nthe dog. That was the first thing I lost. I was sick for three weeks. That was the first loss of\nsomebody I love. I loved the dog because I grew up with him. Well, things got worse. We\nwere ordered to put Stars of David, the yellow patches in the shape of the star. We wore one on\nthe left breast and one on the back. I said I\u2019m not going to put it on and I went out and I was\ncaught and I was very badly beaten. When I came home, I told my father that I wanted to go to\nRussia. At that time, to Russia occupied zone. At that time, Russia allowed every few weeks,\nthe people who come there divided demarcation line to cross Russia occupied part of Poland.\nMy father told me he doesn\u2019t have the strength or inclination to go. He said son, you might not\nrealize but to go to Russia 1s one-way ticket. You will be able to get in but you will never be\nable to get out. I fled from there. I'll take my chances with Germans. And that wasn\u2019t just my\nfather. To them the Russians were the occult Bolsheviks and this and they still felt the Hitler\nregime was aberration and whatever will happen, they\u2019Il survive the war and things return to\nnormal and they will live in free Europe. So they gave me some valuables and sent me off. My\nmother told me when I was leaving on my way to Russia, \u201cSon, take a good look at your\nparents. You will never see them again.\u201d And I went and I was an only child, 16 years old,\nnever away from home except when I went to summer camp. And these words, I could hear the\nwords in my ears to the entire way I reached the Russian boundary and they were supposed to\nopen the day before. I waited for about three or four days. I decided, well whatever is going to\nhappen is going to happen to me and my parents and when I returned, they were already in\nprocess of setting up ghetto. The ghetto, I think, was established in the first month, I don\u2019t\nremember the exact month, sometimes around April of 1940. The ghetto boundaries were\nalready established and the Jews were encouraged to move there. Nobody was moving. At that\ntime, the Russians had deported or repatriated rather, the German population from Latvia, from\nVolhynia, from the parts of Poland, in particle, they were mostly by Germans, in the states\nwhich Russia occupied after 1939 and they were given the choice of Jewish apartments as we\nlived in the nice section of town where one of the parents were to go. Two German officials\ncame and told us we had one hour and we could take whatever we could carry plus .\n(couldn\u2019t hear) to go, so we went. We were able to get a room in one of the two or three homes\nwhich had modern conveniences like water, flush toilets and so forth. The ghetto to which they\npress around 150,000 -- 160,000 Jews, was occupied before probably by 10,000 -- 15,000\npeople and that was the worst slums by looting. There were very few buildings\nwhich really resembled anything we know before we got the room in one of these buildings.\nThey closed the ghetto and in the beginning it was already no more horrors by the Germans,\nthere were no more beatings, there were no more shootings. The ghetto started to organize\nitself but almost from the beginning the rations of food became much smaller and we got\nprogressively less and less to eat. I didn\u2019t finish gymnasium before the war. I finish in ghetto.\nPolish didn\u2019t have right. They forbid Polish to have any kind of schools. They close all Polish\nschools. Somehow, they probably knew they were going to liquidate the population sooner or\nlater they pay no attention so schools open in ghetto so I finish in ghetto. What happen in\nghetto in beginning years, it was a slow starvation. The , aman in his early 60\u2019s, he was\na minor official in the Jewish community. He was active in Jewish orphanages. He never had\nchildren. He raise quite a bit of money for the orphans. He was one of the few people who\ndidn\u2019t flee when all the men left Lodz and went to Warsaw. When the Germans came and he\nwas there and they told him he 1s the alderman of the Jews. He started to organize Jewish life.\nThe men were already had their blood which he bought by the grave of his wife which was\nburied there. He was really widening up his ears. Evidently, all the power of the Germans was\nvested in him. He became absolute ruler of the ghetto and to us he seemed like a man that was\ndrugged with power On the other feeling of course was that if we are going to make useful our\nservices to the Germans, good part of the Jews might survive. No bodies even worst fears\nbelieved that the Germans would try to physically annihilate every woman and child. Well, he\nestablish schools. He started to establish so-called \u201carbisin\u201d, they were shops which\nmanufacture various things with the Germans farvartung with the Germans were the people\nwho administer the ghetto brought to the ghetto and they have a large number of people\nworking in the resorts and in exchange they were sending food to the ghetto. What I remember\nfrom now on, I was still young but was rather a shielded childhood and we grew up in a hurry.\nWhat I remember was hunger, terrible hunger. And it started very, very slowly by the people\nwho were middle aged. And I say people after 40, 45. They had started to deprive. More and\nmore you saw people who had swollen feet, swollen hands. The winters are very harsh in\nPoland and there was nothing to heat their apartments with or the rooms with. There was very\nlittle even wood or coal briquettes to be able to cook something. People were very hungry. A lot\nof them tried to crumble the bread and cook the bread and make a soup out of this so that\nphysically they could pacify their hunger pangs. But, they consumed a lot of liquid and the\nheart was not able to pump and the water settled in the feet and people started to die out. And\nwe had 60, 70 funerals a day. 50 funerals a day will be 1,500 people a month. That was in the\nbeginning. In the beginning, the funerals resembles more or less which were held before the\nwar but sooner or later there was only mass grave. Well, like a mass grave, one mount under\nthe other unmarked graves. My father was taken 1941 to Gestapo. They had the registers.\n(can\u2019t understand). He came very badly beaten and he died a few weeks later. I\nwas left with my mother. Things got even worse as far as the food was concerned. But yet the\nyounger people organize themselves, called Self-Help Organization. The morale was, well, we\nstill felt that we had a chance to survive. This had changed in 1942. In 1942, the runcoston\nhada assembly. It\u2019s 92, 50 years before and I still remember. He said to us, he\nstand before us as broken man, that he devoted all of his later years to helping orphans, he\norganized orphanages even un ghetto and he tried to give him as much resources to survive as\nhe could and yet he was ordered by the Germans that he was to deliver 24,000 Jews. Jews over\n60 years old and children under 10. He told us, you have a choice. Our police would take them\nand it would be dark in semi-orderly fashion or the Germans would come and take them and it\nwould be much worse. If we want to survive, the 100,000 Jews which at the point were locked\nup in the ghetto want to survive, they have to give up 20,000. Well, the chorus arise, no, no, we\nall go. And if the reaction was the people concerned to this, it was emphatically, no. Yet, they\ndeclare curfew and nobody was allowed out of their homes and the Jewish police went from\nhouse to house and there were some doctors among them and they make the selections. All the\nsickly people and the older people and the children were taken away. But what the Jewish\npolice did was not good enough for Germans and they came. Some people were shot. They\ntore the children from the mothers\u2019 arms. They beat the people. The mothers who resisted were\nshot on the spot. In most cases, the women remained frozen when the Germans took the\nchildren away. Only when the child was already on the horse drawn wagon, they realize what\nhappen, they start to chase and cry. Well, they took the 20,000, 25,000 people. And from then\non, almost every able -bodied man or woman or teenager or this, had to work. The food supply\ndidn\u2019t improve -- deteriorate, more and more. There was a lot of mismanagement, in ghetto.\nHe tried Rumkoski tried to store some of the potatoes, you know, which were supposed to be\nrationed to the population. And the whole thing, the entire crop got spoiled. In 1942, I think,\n1943, the Germans appointed Gertler, who was one of the collaborators in trying to extract as\nmuch valuables and this from the Jews, from the Germans, he appointed him head of the so\ncalled sondokommando. He tried to bring some order to the ghetto. In a way he did. He made\nthe thing look a little more efficient. In the meanwhile, more and more, the demand for more\nwere given and people were left in apartments. 3,000, 5,000, 10,000 and when\nyou walk the streets of the ghetto 1943, 1944 you saw, they used to call mussermench,\nbecause the people pattern of working and bending looked like a praying Muslim. The people\nbecame living skeleton, some of them were swollen, some of them looked like skeletons and\nyou could see a good part of the population was so emaciated that the war is not going to end\nsoon, they are going to die. Well, the ghetto lived until 1944.",
        "A: I was working. I was working in the office of a sort of a shop getting my rations. In 1943, my\nmother died of starvation. She lost weight progressively and finally she was not able to walk\nany more. She stayed in bed constantly. (very low -- can\u2019t hear).",
        "A: Well, she had been working until she got sick. She did ina shop. Then she got sick.\nShe got the typhoid fever. She got sick, she never recovered. She died. I was left alone. In\n1944, the Germans started to evacuate the ghetto. They ordered that people will report, about\n5,000 people a day, for deportation. Of course, they refused. So to give the order for\ndeportation. So the Germans took the enslight the head of the ghetto administration, went from\nshop to shop promising that people will go into Germany, living conditions would be better,\nthey will be better fed and so forth but nobody trusted him. People tried to avoid deportation as\nlong as they could. I left Lodz in August 23 1944. We didn\u2019t know where we go. Probably if\nwe would know where we go and what Auschwitz is, we would get vicious to board the trains\nand probably shot, but that would be at least passive resistance but we really didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: Lodz ghetto was the most isolated ghetto in Poland. Every hundred feet you get a German\nguard. We didn\u2019t get no papers, nothing. Supposedly, few survivors from Chedno were able to\nescape but the population didn\u2019t know. We knew that clothes came back to the\nghetto from the people who were deported, the old and the sick people and people had\nforeboding that nothing good comes and they probably perish but they didn\u2019t know that\nsystematic extermination and this. Well, we boarded the train. There was hundred people in a\ncattle car in which we were transported. We went for about three or four days.\n(END OF SIDE A)",
        "A: All right. So, when we boarded the train, there were 100 people in our, whatever you call this,\nand what they gave us, there was one bucket which was supposed to serve if people wanted to\nrelieve themselves. There was no water. A little bit of food we took with. I think it took us\nabout four days out to reach Auschwitz. We came at night. We were allowed to take hand\nbaggage. When the doors opened, we saw people pointing to us looked like a fine striped\npajamas uniforms. But they spoke to us Polish and told us, \u201cplease leave all the things inside\nthe car. Just get out, get out, get out.\u201d Before we could do anything else, we form a line, we\nsaw a lot of SS running with the pistols and with guns, whipping people and we were marching\ntop a well lighted platform and Mengele was standing there and conducted the selection. And\nwith a flip of the hand, some went to the right, some went to the left. We had no idea what it\nmeans. I went to the right. They took us, they took all the clothes away, they shave us\ncompletely and they give us the striped uniforms and a number and we were led to a barracks.\nBarrack that were former quarters of Austrian cavalry from before WWI and when you slept\nover there you could lay down on one side but we were pressed so much that there was no place\nto turn around. I still have, 50 years, I have scars about size of half dollar because we were all\nbones at that time and laying and pressing, the bones were pressing against the wood and the\nthings got infected. I was about two weeks -- I wasn\u2019t in Auschwitz, I was in Birkenau.\nBirkenau was part of Auschwitz complex but there was, people didn\u2019t work over there. People\nwere either sent to the gas chamber, either sent out to other German concentration camps at that\ntime. You could see when we went to the barrack, the flames shooting and the block leader told\nus what it is, that the people from the selections are having appointment with their forefathers.\nWell, anyway, I was there for two weeks and I was selected and put into a transport and I met\none of my former classmates, Jerry Malikoff and we decided that we stick together. And we\nwere, together, almost to the end of the war. We were deported to the commander of\nDachau. That was a separate camps of Dachau. Dachau was much minor camp in\ncomparison. . There were just camps in which the Jews worked until they\ndropped dead and they send us more and more and more people.. I was in the lager 4 which\nwas I was in lager 11 which was , and we work on Commander Morris. All\nday we had to carry 50 pounds cement sacks from early dawn till it got dark and we always\ncarry number of people who died. If you couldn\u2019t work, they beat you to death. And we had to\ncarry the dead bodies back because they have to count every day. We stood on the appell platz,\nthat was the place where they counted the prisoners and the number of the prisoners had to tally,\neven if we stood late in the night. I was lucky for a short while to get the job . Then\nthey used us to take care of other prisoners. When you are sick, when you get your slice of\nbread you couldn\u2019t eat everything and there was a lot of bread left. At that time, I gained some\nweight but after a while the Germans got tired of it and they took away with the transport all the\nsick people, the block was liquidated and we went back.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. At that time, I got infected feet and I got blood poisoning and they took me and\ndoctor , the physician was later -- he attended at our wedding. My wife went to\nnursing school and he was director of nursing school after the war. He attended our wedding\nHe told me, you come son, I have to amputate or you die. And they didn\u2019t have no anesthetics\nand he told me \u201cbut look, you\u2019ll be in pain but you\u2019ll faint\u2019. And few people put me on the\ntable, they help me and I just realize at that moment that they are going to take away the toes of\nmy foot. They are going to amputate, I\u2019Il be sent away to the gas chambers. So with all the\nstrength I have, I tore myself out and I run away. I run away and I went to the working detail.\nAt that time, I had no feeling in my foot and I must have stepped on a very sharp\nstone and it cut deeply but that saved me and the pus and everything started to drain. After the\nwar I still had operation and I had pieces of bone taken out of my toes but I survived this.\nWhen the Allies started to come in and they started to come in direction of Dachau from\nAusborg, which was miles away, they put us all on the trains. Then they started to gather all the\nprisoners into the main camp in Dachau, although we were probably no more than twenty, thirty\nmiles to Dachau, everything wass bombed, and I was in transit for about four or five days.\nThere was no water, there was no food. Some people went crazy and they drank their own\nurine. When my train came to Dachau, they unloaded boxcar. They unloaded\nmy boxcar. That was the last boxcar they unloaded. There were more dead than alive and when\nthe American army came two days later, they found the entire train, say the first five boxcars,\nboxcars full of dead prisoners. Well, and what the Americans done -- they put us. I was in the\nhospital for quite a few months and I decided to go back to Poland to see if anyone had\nsurvived. We had, during the war, when we knew that they are going to take our apartment\naway, that sooner or later we had to move to ghetto, we had neighbors. Their name was\nMitchelene, they were Poles. He was, the father of the man was Italian and the mother was\nPolish but they lived in Poland and we knew them very, very well. As a matter of fact, the\nwoman was carrying , my mother was carrying her . I knew the people\nfor fourteen years, from the time I moved in the house to the time I was deported. My mother\ntook all the crystals, all the china, all the silver up to them and said, \u201cLook, I doubt if we will\nget alive from the ghetto. That\u2019s all yours.\u201d We survived. We didn\u2019t expect. Well, I went over\nthere when I came. I went with the transport to Poland, Polish transport of course, repatriated to\nPoland, it was very easy to get on the train. I came over there, I went on the tenth floor. I\nknocked on the door. A woman opened the door and she tried to slam in my face. \u201cWe have\nnothing, we have nothing.\u201d I was just able to hold the door open and I said \u201clook, I don\u2019t want\nnothing from you. I came from Auschwitz and I saw the silver and the money and the crystals\nall mingled with blood. All I want to know, did somebody from my family, my cousins, did\nsurvive, look for me\u201d. She said \u201cnobody\u201d and she slammed the door in my face. I was three\ndays in Poland and didn\u2019t find nobody and went back. In the beginning, the liberated prisoners\nwho were in Munich, which is twenty miles from Dachau but I north to\nFrankfort on Meine and opened and I enrolled . (Couldn\u2019t\nunderstand him).university and started to study pharmacy. I got married in 1948. My wife was\nin nursing school at that time. We came here. Well, my story is for all the people who came\ndisplaced persons, who came to this country. We worked for a couple of years and then I went\nback to school. I got my PhD from medical school from the University of Chicago and came to\nWashington, started with the government. For the last ten years before retirement, I directed the\nresearch department that was the only large animal where my\nmedical research was conducted. I retired in 1989.",
        "A: You mean from before?",
        "A: Episodes that stands in my mind was the deportation in 1942. It was a nightmare. The cries of\nthe people; the children torn from the mother\u2019s arms. The old people who went in such a\nresigned way, with the look in their eyes -- they know that that\u2019s their last trip. They didn\u2019t\nknow what\u2019s going to happen to them. But they knew that that\u2019s the end. That was one. The\nsecond was the shock of coming to Auschwitz. The selection. The realization. The flames that\nwere shooting toward the sky when we were told that all the people who went to the left side\nwere selected by Mengele. This probably I remember still most deeply. I saw Mengele for\nabout ten minutes. Pass the line until I pass him by. I probably, if he would look like he looked\nthen, I would recognize him immediately. The other thing which I remember was the will to\nlive. People wanted to survive. People wanted to survive. They wanted to tell the story. We\nnever believed at that time that the world really know what\u2019s happening to us. People were\nclinging to their lives and they wanted to preserve something. The other thing, I never attended\nsynagogue till my daughter was born and she was about six or seven years old, we lived in\nChicago. One day, , she came \u201cDaddy, Daddy, look, sisters are coming\u201d\u2019. I said what\nare you mumbling, what sisters? I look and I saw two nuns. And I said, \u201cJudy, tomorrow you\ngo to Sunday School.\u201d And I took her to Sunday school. But it took years for us to reconcile\nand regain some kind of emotional balance although we are outwardly very, very well balanced,\nbut the whole coming to the United States, trying to work, trying to get degree. Well,\npeople were really subconsciously trying to do, they try to do that many things, that they went\nfinally to sleep, they collapse. There was no time to think. It was, I don\u2019t know, I know there\nwas no neurotic drive, only that there was self- preservation. But people tried, not to forget, but\npeople simply were haunted. It was almost in everybody\u2019s mind, the question, people question\n\u201cWhy did I survive? Why didn\u2019t the other one survive?\u201d And you know what was probably the\nmost painful question was when you talk to people and they didn\u2019t meant nothing. We did hear,\njust very innocently asking, \u201cWhy and how did you survive?\u201d We couldn\u2019t -- it helped them.\nWe couldn\u2019t answer the question ourselves but people felt guilty without being able to explain\nto themselves that they are not guilty of nothing and it took number of years. It took quite a few\nyears until, you know, the children came and life went on, and we\u2019re young and the things\nwhich happened receded and accepting from God then, life went on and we raised\nfamilies and we became part of American society. And I hope we contributed.",
        "A: When I finished, I had around seventy or eighty papers and presentations on my city.",
        "A: That was school camp. Well, it was a Zionist, not be definition, it was Zionist by what\npermeated. I remember as children we made the campfires and we stood and we sang Hebrew\nZionist songs, yes, yes. It was not a Zionist organized, but culturally it was a Zionist camp.",
        "A: Yes, sure. My mother, like most of the women in the middle class, around a hundred middle\nclass families, didn\u2019t work. She was active, she was active in Jewish life. She traveled. As a\nmatter of fact, my mother was in the United States attending the World Fair in 1939. She came\nto see her brothers. When she returned to Poland two weeks before the war started, her brother\nbegged her to stay but you know, she said \u201clook, I have a child and my husband over there.\u201d\nWhen she crossed Germany, the train was seeing, nobody could get, you know, she just\ntransited into Germany, into Poland. If the war had broken out two weeks earlier, I would still\nhave probably my mother alive. I remember in 1938, Germans expelled the Jews who were\nonce Polish citizens. We were not at that far from the border. Lodz, I don\u2019t know, maybe two,\nthree hundred miles from the border, from the western border in Germany. We kept a young\nboy and I shared the room for a while, I don\u2019t remember, for half a year.",
        "A: Yes. The Jewish community took the children and then his parents came and took him away.\nThey got situated. The brothers of my mother tried to talk us into leaving Poland and coming to\nthe States but my father was a metal agent at that time. We had , We were very, very\nfinancially comfortable and he felt, his reasoning was, I don\u2019t know the language, you can take\nno money out of Poland. You could just go as you were. What am I going to do over there?\nAnd he didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t want to go and they paid with their lives, my parents.",
        "A: Oh, yes. My mother came -- just a second. Yes, my mother was about 23 when I was born so\nshe was born probably around 1900. She lived in a small town in Lithuania, Batinia, Lithuania.\nMy grandfather was very well to do. He owned quite a bit of land. He owned a sawmill. He\nowned a flourmill ad my grandparents sent us packages in 1941 to the ghetto from Lithuania.\nThe packages reached the ghetto. They were killed -- the Lithuanians killed them even before\nthe Germans. In the two to three days when the Russians pulled away and before the Germans\noccupied physically the town, the entire Jewish population was finished.",
        "A: My mother attended the university, in Russia . She was interned a year",
        "A: Languages.",
        "A: Oh, yes, oh yes. My mother\u2019s family certain was more, they were not Hasidic, but they were\nmore observant. Entire generation, my grandparents were much more observant. My dad\u2019s\nfather was much more observant than we were. But you have to understand one thing. My\nparents went through WW1. They lived already under the communist regime for a while, for a\nfew years before they were able to extricate themselves from Russia. And probably just like\ntoday\u2019s generation of the people veer from the strict religious practices of their parents, they\nveer from the strict religious practices of their parents. In other words, the meat was kosher still\nat home but when we ate dinner, we could have coffee or tea with milk, you know. It was\nkosher but not in the strictest sense of this. We had two sets of dishes and so forth. I remember,\nI went for Rosh Hashonah and Yom Kippur with my dad to the synagogue.",
        "A: Well, there were candles. There were candles at home but you took the streetcar. My father\nrode the car, he had a car which was in Poland, there were not too many cars but he had a car.\nShabbat was much more a tradition than a religious observance. We never went for Sabbath\nday and Friday services. The synagogue was quite a distance from where we lived and it was\nthe only one big synagogue in Lodz. Our home was a Zionist home, much more than\na religious home.",
        "A: She was young and she was full of life. My mother played beautiful violin. She was not a\nconcert violinist but I remember her playing for her friends and so forth. She got active with\nseveral of her friends. I\u2019ve got a large family. All three sisters of my mother and they got\nchildren, they are my cousins. From the entire family, that\u2019s what I went to look for, I\u2019m the\nonly survivor. She had two brothers in this country. One of them, we took the name of my\nuncle in L.A.",
        "A: Yes, but when we came here, it is hard to explain. The only thing what we were able to salvage\nfrom the old country was the . I remember we came to Chicago and I already got\nmy job. I started very low class, then I got into the lab. When I got in touch with my uncle,\nwhen he called, my wife\u2019s on the phone. All he wanted to know, if she\u2019s Jewish. After talking\nto her, my wife left Chicago, she was at NIH, at the time she worked as a nurse. My wife has\nwe have a large home in L.A. Why don\u2019t you come out, you will live with us, I'll put\nmy nephew on the payroll ad he could go to school. When I came my wife was almost ready to\npack. And I told her look. He has two children. In spite of what he said, the kids will say that a\npair of refugees came and moved smack into our parent\u2019s home.\u201d I said you cannot have it both\nways. If you want to be independent you have to stay independent. I went to visit my uncle.\nThey were very nice to me. When I was going to school for every Jewish holiday and Christian\nholiday, he sent me $100 check and he tried to do it in a quiet sort of way. And it helped, at that\ntime it helped. But what we did, we did on our own. We pulled ourselves up.",
        "A: I wrote them a letter. I remember my father-in-law was a very, very bitter man. He never\nreconciled himself to what happened. He just could not reconcile that people have wives,\nfamily and this, you know, and his wife perish and his mother perish. I was younger, but we\nwere also bitter at that time. We\u2019re not bitter at nobody in particular. I wrote them a letter and I\nsaid \u201clook, I\u2019m at the university, I\u2019m studying, I\u2019m not asking for nothing, I don\u2019t need nothing\nbut you are entitled to know what happened to your family.\u201d And I wrote it. And the answer\nwas \u201cLook you never asked us for nothing, we didn\u2019t refuse you nothing.\u201d They couldn\u2019t\nunderstand probably , why the letters were so bitter. When I came here, you see\nthis is the difference probably between the immigration, between the displaced persons who\ncame here at that time. We spent very little, just wanted a chance. Russian Jews, and I quite\nactive now with Russian Jews, they expect much more. They expect much from society. We\nwere so disillusioned, that we didn\u2019t expect nothing from nobody. But, yes, I have contact with\nthem, but I lived in Chicago, they lived in L.A. I saw them a few times. As a matter of fact\nwhen I got out from undergraduate school in Annapolis, his wife came to my graduation. My\nwife has a family in Chicago. They showed us when we came. They are not wealthy\npeople but the children were pretty well off. They\u2019re professionals and we got quite close to\nthem. We finally realized that they tried to be family to us and we integrated\n(couldn\u2019t hear) into the family.",

        "A: My father joined her but not for that much because he has in the business, the factory.\nYes, but, so she was well traveled. Spoke languages, was active in the Jewish life. She was a\nvery good-looking woman, she was tall.",

My grandfather\nalso fled but he fled to but he fled a year later. All my uncles, the brothers of my\nfather, also left Russia and they also settled in Lodz. I have a large family.
