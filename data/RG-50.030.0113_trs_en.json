We didn't know. We knew what\nthere is in the work. There will be, any day we didn't know the date. We went out in the\nmorning. We went away in the morning. The site was the tunnel, and we was waiting maybe\nan hour, an hour and a half. We didn't have our German. He came out so drunk, he with four\nlitvish. He took out the gun. There was for everyday, every time we went out. He would\nwith this what was working there. He took out the gun. He took to the four\nlitvish away. He don't worry to go out with us alone, with us alone. He want to go out with\nus alone. Ah, we was with him every day for for for seven months, eight months, and every\nday we was with him and he he knew everybody. He knew everything. And he was drunk.\nHe couldn't stand up straight. We took him and went out. The four litvish went away. And\nwe went out from camp, maybe a hundred feet, maybe more, and he showed the four litvish\ngone. They went away. They went. He took out again the gun, and he start to shoot. I told\nyou, away. They wentaway. he d_ ___ don't want, he don't want. We went out and\nwe went not . We wasn't there. We, nobody would would find us in in the in the\nforest. And usually he drink again when they brought the pots, brought food to us. We\nbought from them food, and we was eating outside. We didn't eat very very small, very very\nin camp. We had food. We bought when the, from the Poles. And they bring vodka, too.\nAnd he was drinking more and fall asleep. That we could take his gun. We could kill him\nand we could go away. All twenty people escape. Here's one said yes, and one said no and\none said yes and one said no and where we go, twenty people. We don't have where to go\nand if we go, somebody, if we go we know that is in the work an escape an uprising in\ncamp, and if we doing it's finished uprising again. We had somebody older than our kapo.\nHe was our our kapo. Everybody has a kapo, and same thing with us. He was not much. He\nwas . So he said we make, what's the name, (pause) are we are democrats, yes. We\nmake a voting. If the if there will be the most will be to escape, we escape. If the most will\nbe we go back in camp, we go back in camp. The most was we have to go back in camp. We\nwas worried for the for the uprising, which the second time the uprising. And we didn't want\nto take on us the responsibility. I was in the same in the same way. I was voting to go back.\nWhen I, we knew there is an uprising, today, tomorrow. Today, no. Tomorrow can be.\nAfter tomorrow can be. We know there is an uprising. We knew a hundred percent there is\nan uprising. We went back, tookhim = ~\u2014____one took him this side and one took him this\nside and we went back in camp lunch hour. We went back in camp. We went back in camp,\nall Germans, and all Litvish?, what there was in camp, they were standing in a line. And\nlooking at us like we was coming from the moon. They didn't expect us back. They knew he\nwas drunk. Knew there was twenty people, strong guys, and knew we could...we came back.\nThey looked at us and they was laughing and Kiwo said, oh our Juden wouldn't go away.\nThey they have 01:43 so good here, they don't they don't want to go away. This what he\nsaid. I heard him say it. Shortly we got back in camp and after after lunch we didn't went\nout, and he was too drunk and alright, we was in camp. This was maybe two weeks, maybe\nsomething more before the uprising. And we saved the uprising. If we went away was ??\nand we saved the uprising. Uprising. There was, make the day October 2nd. We knew eight\ndays, five days before. April 2nd, four o'clock in the afternoon. There was there was another\ncamp, Treblinka camp, nothing to do with us. Only Poles. No Jewh. Only Poles I don't\nknow, of(?) other nations, I don't know. There passed by everyday in the morning, nine\no'clock, they passed by to work. I don't know where to work, where they went to work, to\nWarsaw ?, I don't know where to, to the forest? Four o'clock they went back. Exactly to the\nminute. Four o'clock the train took them back. And there was five kilometer from us, five,\nsix kilometer from us, was another, a camp, a working camp. I don't know how many\npeople there was there. No, we knew in the morning and at four o'clock like the watch. So\nwe wanted to take, we want to make the uprising four o'clock. Ten minutes before, fifteen\nminutes before, to catch the train, and to take them too. Maybe they have with them too\nsomething. Our staff maybe, I don't know, maybe the committee, maybe they have\nsomething with them. Supposed to be like this. At a quarter to four, ten to four, quarter to\nfour supposed to be the uprising. Three o'clock, ten after three, we supposed to go, every\nsection supposed to go for the arms. Each one has to have arms. What we took out from the\nGermans. Not me.

There was other people working\nfor Germans, ordnances, working in the kitchen and in German kitchen and workers there.\nBut they went in and out and they, where the Germans was. The Germans was staying, the\nGerman, the Litvish ? . And they took out the arms, and what I told you wasn't, it was so\nhot. Was a very hot day that day, and in camp was maybe two Germans. Maybe was more\naround. We know in our camp, our camp, the number one, didn't have not one German.\nOnly the Litvish. All German went to swim. To the Bukh. Not far away, maybe ten\nkilometers or fifteen kilometers [from] there. They went to swim. And they took out all\narms. They cut the elect...the telephone. The workers, our workers, the Jewish.

The\nkitchen was the main place, for the kitchen was in the middle of our camp and everybody\nhas to go in the kitchen and take out arms. And they didn't have hundred percent. They had\nsome arms, not a hundred percent. There was arms that didn't get ready. There wasn't time\nalready. When we was there, quarter after three, I was there with another guy near the\nkitchen. It was already too late. We saw what's happen before I don't know. They didn't have\nall arms. This I heard 01:53 later. We had our our kapo, from Warsaw, an older guy. He\nwas he wasn't a kapo from where we slept. He was a kapo of everything. When the plates\nand pots from the kitchen, where we took the Lumpen (rags), that where we sorted, he was\neverywhere. There was kapos where we were sleeping, in the bunks. There was kapos,\nworking kapos. He was everybody's. He was over. He came in the kitchen and he saw\nsomething happen in the kitchen. There wasn't, the soup wasn't made. Supposed to be three\no'clock, after three supposed to be the soup already maked, the soup for for for for the\ndinner, for supper. I don't know, (why?)he came.

Another day, it's something. When they saw in the kitchen, he brought\nwith him. And they come into the kitchen. They start to shoot the man and they threw hand\ngrenades on them, and I saw Kiwa with the Kapo fall. I told already they are finished. And\nwe didn't have the guns. We, right away we escaped back to our place where we was\nworking to be with our with our group and this was the best place to way to escape. We was\nwaiting by the , by the gate. This was the best place. We were went back to our to\nour group by the gate. Not on, not by the gates, nobody around the gates. And there was\nthere wasn't happen like 1t was supposed to happen. It was shooting here, shooting all over\nand they start to burn the the place, the camp. Where we sleep, the bunks, everything.\nEverything. They start to burn. After twenty minutes we saw there's a , there isn't\nlike this like supposed to be, so we start with the gates, with the wires on the gates. There\nwas heavy wires and high. We thought that the wires are electric, with electric, electricity.\nThere, after we make the we saw the wires are clean. We start to cut the wires, anyplace\nwhere we got where we saw the wires, we cut the wires and we take the wires on the side to\nmake openings. And we escaped. There was the forest, there was the forest. We escaped.\nAfter this, after the wires was other wires. Was worst than our wires. The other wires we\ncouldn't we couldn't cut. Was a special wire, anti-tank wire. Was a special wire for the\narmy, army wire. The, we couldn't go through. We we took off jackets and we threw on the\nwire and we escaped through them. And one, one on the other and so we escaped in the\nforest and we escaped deep in the forest. 01:58 What we heard later, there was maybe about\ntwenty there was maybe five hundred, four or five hundred people escaped. Through this\nplace where we was working. Only through this place. There was kapos there.

And we started to walk by the moon,\nwith the moon. We walked the whole night. The first night we was we walked the whole\nnight. We came in the morning. We saw we are in the same place. We went around. And\ncame the same place where we start to walk in the forest. We walk and walk and walk, the\nwhole night, and the daytime we didn't want to walk. We were sitting. We didn't want to\nwalk in the daytime. Maybe for the Poles. Not for the Germans. Germans didn't want to\ncome in in in the forest. They didn't come in the forest. Only the Poles from around. We\nwere sitting. The second night, we start to walk in another direction. We came in the\nmorning, again the same thing. Maybe a hundred, maybe a maybe a half a half a kilometer\nthis side. We saw we are in the same place. We sit the whole day again, and at night we start\nto start to walk in another direction. This was the third night.

He said we saw in the daytime, we saw from from the\nyou know, blueberries (ph). They catching blueberries. They coming, kids with\nthe women, they coming for blueberries, from us. So we figured so we figured out it's not\nfar. There must be something here when the people _ if it 1s far from from town or\nsomething, the people wouldn't come. If they come, it's not far maybe. A couple of\nkilometers, . The people come for the blueberries. There was all over blueberries.\nAt night he went out in the same direction we make the direction from where the kids came,\nand where the kids went away. They went in the same direction. And he went out. It wasn't\nfar. We didn't, we knew, we figured _ he went out and he went out in the forest and he\nthought there are workers on the on the on the fields.

He\nwas he wasn't a kapo from where we slept. He was a kapo of everything. When the plates\nand pots from the kitchen, where we took the Lumpen (rags), that where we sorted, he was\neverywhere. There was kapos where we were sleeping, in the bunks. There was kapos,\nworking kapos. He was everybody's. He was over. He came in the kitchen and he saw\nsomething happen in the kitchen. There wasn't, the soup wasn't made. Supposed to be three\no'clock, after three supposed to be the soup already maked, the soup for for for for the\ndinner, for supper. I don't know, (why?)he came.

I don't know why, why was happen.\nSupposed, doesn't supposed to happen like this, and it's happened. I don't know how. We\ncame there. We couldn't go inside. We went inside in the kitchen but they shoot out in the\nkitchen already. They shoot on the kapo, and on Kiwa?. We heared went from the\nkitchen in second camp, and they brought back in our camp to see what's\nhappen. He smelled something nothing. It's not it's not like everyday, day by day. It's\nsomething. Another day, it's something. When they saw in the kitchen, he brought\nwith him. And they come into the kitchen. They start to shoot the man and they threw hand\ngrenades on them, and I saw Kiwa with the Kapo fall. I told already they are finished. And\nwe didn't have the guns.

This was the best place. We were went back to our to\nour group by the gate. Not on, not by the gates, nobody around the gates. And there was\nthere wasn't happen like 1t was supposed to happen. It was shooting here, shooting all over\nand they start to burn the the place, the camp. Where we sleep, the bunks, everything.\nEverything. They start to burn. After twenty minutes we saw there's a , there isn't\nlike this like supposed to be, so we start with the gates, with the wires on the gates. There\nwas heavy wires and high. We thought that the wires are electric, with electric, electricity.\nThere, after we make the we saw the wires are clean. We start to cut the wires, anyplace\nwhere we got where we saw the wires, we cut the wires and we take the wires on the side to\nmake openings. And we escaped. There was the forest, there was the forest. We escaped.\nAfter this, after the wires was other wires. Was worst than our wires. The other wires we\ncouldn't we couldn't cut. Was a special wire, anti-tank wire. Was a special wire for the\narmy, army wire. The, we couldn't go through. We we took off jackets and we threw on the\nwire and we escaped through them. And one, one on the other and so we escaped in the\nforest and we escaped deep in the forest. 01:58 What we heard later, there was maybe about\ntwenty there was maybe five hundred, four or five hundred people escaped. Through this\nplace where we was working. Only through this place. There was kapos there.
