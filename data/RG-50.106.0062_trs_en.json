I went to the\nJewish elementary school, and basically in 1939 I was a nice supposed to go to starting\nmy gymnasium, which is high school, in Hungary and when the classes started. And\nnumerous classes means that we have a relatively small percentage of Jewish students\nthat are admitted to the high schools. I believe it was 4 percent of the total of student\npopulation. I'm really not sure about the percentage. But, yes, in May, I was between\nthose fortunate ones that were admitted to high school and four of us four Jew in class\nof about 50 started our high school years. The school which I went to, it happened to be a\nrather revisionist national and rather anti Semitic school. And as far as discrimination,\ncertainly it was, but nevertheless, it was tolerated.

And we saw the first German soldier. That was a somewhat rainy day. I\nrecollect that the guys there at the wore a long, black rain coat, and they had a kind of\nplaque that on their neck, and it turned to be the military German military police.\nAnd that was the day that the Germans had invaded Hungary.

Maybe it was some kind ofa a how should I say? The\nconsciousness? I really don't know what was the reason, but we didn't feel that this\nyellow staris makes any difference in the relationship.

So about\n2,000 families were kicked out very swiftly from their home. That was the first one. And\nsubsequently I believe it was in May that the law came that Jews has to be has to\nmove to certain houses. There is a clear distinction with the marked houses.

        "Q: What's the next thing you do remember?",
        "A: Well, the next thing which I do remember, very vividly remember, it was the 15th of\nOctober. That's what happened. On the 14th of October, there was a proclamation in\nHungarian radio in which the governor, Horthy, declared that that Hungary is jumping\nout of the war. So that was the tremendous jubilation, obviously. We were still on the\nsame Jewish yellow star house that I already described. Though we were exceedingly\nhappy that, my goodness, that's the end of the story, after all. The Russians got in the\nHungarian border. They are progressing beautifully. And this is really now that half\nafter Romania Romania wanted to jump out of the war and Italy, obviously. So that\nwas in 1990 in 1944, October. So we thought that maybe we_ we will be able to\nsalvage ourselves inthe meantime. The the they through the Swedish embassy, we\nknew that the SS left the country, basically. There was special SS dealing with Jewish\nthings. So we thought that's the end of the story. And then on the 15th, which there was\nnext morning, we look out in the window, and we saw the trucks for this the Hungarian\nNazis with the Arrow Cross part in the automobiles with full regalia and the German |\ndon't really know the realm of the SS, but I know that the presence become very heavy in\nthe area that we lived. And that that was the turning point, obviously, which, as you\nknow, for the Budapest Jews, because the Hungarian Jews _ the rest of the Hungarian\nJews crossed the 700,000 already was killed in Auschwitz. But still at that time we didn't\nstill, at that time we didn't know really about about Auschwitz whatsoever. No. We\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And then the all the women and the all the males were\nordered to one of the one of the large assembly places. And they then the march\nstarted. As you know, the fact being that there were no possibility already to deport from\nthe from the capital. The fact 1s that the Russians already closed over all the roads to\nAuschwitz. So it was after October, there was no way that the deportation could be. The\nthe Budapest Jews deportation couldn't be done because the roads are already fortunately\nnot the Red Army that occupied them already. So that ttme I about two weeks later, a\nproclamation from the from the Arrow Cross party and the Parliament came that you\nhave to move in the ghetto. They established a ghetto. I believe it was in __1n the first\nweek of November, if I am not mistaken. But, nevertheless, we were very, very fortunate\nbecause we moved into international ghetto, which is basically the protected houses. We\nhad Schutz Passes from the from the Swedish government, the fact being that probably\ndecent connections I would think that, because as a matter of fact, my wife and uncle is in\nStockholm, but I don't know how much would that affect us, because I didn't know my\nwife at the time. She was only ten years old. So anyway, at I made it too complicated.\nThey had Schutz Passes. Asareason as aresult of the Schutz Passes, we may have\nbeen protected in the house, the Swedish house, which was _ they were around the city.\nThere were a couple of houses. I believe there were around eight or ten center houses\nwhere the Swedish Schutz Pass bearers could move in. And I mean, you have half a\nroom, but nevertheless, you had some kind of protection. So my father was at the time in\nin the forced arm forced camp in Szolnok, which 1s about, I would say, 80 miles from\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And somehow, through the grapevine, we heard that they are going to transfer\nthem through, and supposed to taking them to Germany. So I, being the head of the _ the\nfamily at that time, obviously. SoI I took off my yellow star, and I went out to the\nrailway station that generally the transport is going through. I think it was about three or\nfour days after my first visit there, indeed, they _ the train arrived. I didn't know at that\ntime that my father was on this train or not. But suddenly, Wallenberg appeared, his\npeople at least three other people. And suddenly, I saw my father coming out of the\nrailway station. And said, \"What's going on?\" Said, \"Well, had Schutz Pass, and they let\nme off the train.\" So we, without any major incidents, were protected in the Swedish\nhouse. All right. The things were more or less, besides the fact that obviously tension\nwas tremendous and the ghetto had horrible problems, the | = +the hunger or the or\nthe only three months was the ghetto. But still, over 120 or 130,000 people were pushed\nin less than a square mile to a square area. The situation was horrible. And we were\nmuch better off because we lived in a protected house, and we had a half a room for\nourselves, and water was running. And as a matter of fact, the telephone was working\nstill in the building. And I do remember very, very, very clearly that it was Christmas\nmorning that the first Russian show arrived to our neighborhood. That was a tremendous\nturn. Budapest was already surrounded. And they started, basically, the last stage of the\nof the Red Army. The front moved closer and closer and closer. And as the front moved\ncloser and closer and closer, the the Arrow Cross people become more and more wide,\nand unbelievable atrocities happened.

So we knew that,\nof course, we were fine. Through the consulate s+. ~ So we arrived on the 28th of\nDecember. On the 28th of December, suddenly broke the door of the house, and the\nArrow Cross appeared, and everybody down from the apartments. And and it was the\nvery similar procedure that happened in the other houses which were taken and executed.\nOkay\u201d? And it happened to be that my uncle was a lawyer, and as a lawyer, he had a big\nmouth, and the big mouth he was staying the responsible person for the whole bloody\nhouse. He was the he was the kind of supervisor of the house, if you want to. So this\nstory, by the way, is written down very well in one of Wallenberg's book. It's by name,\nand it's it's very well documented. So I am just now quoting, as a matter of fact, from\nthe book, telling of what happened. Basically what happened was there was a one\nworking telephone, and my dear uncle called the consulate, which was in a different part\nof the city. And for some unbelievable luck, Wallenberg just happened to be in the\nconsulate inthis in acertain location.

        "A: Well, the next thing which I do remember, very vividly remember, it was the 15th of\nOctober. That's what happened. On the 14th of October, there was a proclamation in\nHungarian radio in which the governor, Horthy, declared that that Hungary is jumping\nout of the war. So that was the tremendous jubilation, obviously. We were still on the\nsame Jewish yellow star house that I already described. Though we were exceedingly\nhappy that, my goodness, that's the end of the story, after all. The Russians got in the\nHungarian border. They are progressing beautifully. And this is really now that half\nafter Romania Romania wanted to jump out of the war and Italy, obviously. So that\nwas in 1990 in 1944, October. So we thought that maybe we_ we will be able to\nsalvage ourselves inthe meantime. The the they through the Swedish embassy, we\nknew that the SS left the country, basically. There was special SS dealing with Jewish\nthings. So we thought that's the end of the story. And then on the 15th, which there was\nnext morning, we look out in the window, and we saw the trucks for this the Hungarian\nNazis with the Arrow Cross part in the automobiles with full regalia and the German |\ndon't really know the realm of the SS, but I know that the presence become very heavy in\nthe area that we lived.

And then the all the women and the all the males were\nordered to one of the one of the large assembly places. And they then the march\nstarted. As you know, the fact being that there were no possibility already to deport from\nthe from the capital. The fact 1s that the Russians already closed over all the roads to\nAuschwitz. So it was after October, there was no way that the deportation could be. The\nthe Budapest Jews deportation couldn't be done because the roads are already fortunately\nnot the Red Army that occupied them already. So that ttme I about two weeks later, a\nproclamation from the from the Arrow Cross party and the Parliament came that you\nhave to move in the ghetto. They established a ghetto. I believe it was in __1n the first\nweek of November, if I am not mistaken. But, nevertheless, we were very, very fortunate\nbecause we moved into international ghetto, which is basically the protected houses. We\nhad Schutz Passes from the from the Swedish government, the fact being that probably\ndecent connections I would think that, because as a matter of fact, my wife and uncle is in\nStockholm, but I don't know how much would that affect us, because I didn't know my\nwife at the time. She was only ten years old. So anyway, at I made it too complicated.\nThey had Schutz Passes. Asareason as aresult of the Schutz Passes, we may have\nbeen protected in the house, the Swedish house, which was _ they were around the city.\nThere were a couple of houses. I believe there were around eight or ten center houses\nwhere the Swedish Schutz Pass bearers could move in. And I mean, you have half a\nroom, but nevertheless, you had some kind of protection.

And somehow, through the grapevine, we heard that they are going to transfer\nthem through, and supposed to taking them to Germany. So I, being the head of the _ the\nfamily at that time, obviously. SoI I took off my yellow star, and I went out to the\nrailway station that generally the transport is going through. I think it was about three or\nfour days after my first visit there, indeed, they _ the train arrived. I didn't know at that\ntime that my father was on this train or not. But suddenly, Wallenberg appeared, his\npeople at least three other people. And suddenly, I saw my father coming out of the\nrailway station. And said, \"What's going on?\" Said, \"Well, had Schutz Pass, and they let\nme off the train.\" So we, without any major incidents, were protected in the Swedish\nhouse. All right. The things were more or less, besides the fact that obviously tension\nwas tremendous and the ghetto had horrible problems, the | = +the hunger or the or\nthe only three months was the ghetto. But still, over 120 or 130,000 people were pushed\nin less than a square mile to a square area. The situation was horrible. And we were\nmuch better off because we lived in a protected house, and we had a half a room for\nourselves, and water was running. And as a matter of fact, the telephone was working\nstill in the building. And I do remember very, very, very clearly that it was Christmas\nmorning that the first Russian show arrived to our neighborhood. That was a tremendous\nturn. Budapest was already surrounded. And they started, basically, the last stage of the\nof the Red Army. The front moved closer and closer and closer. And as the front moved\ncloser and closer and closer, the the Arrow Cross people become more and more wide,\nand unbelievable atrocities happened.

So we knew that,\nof course, we were fine. Through the consulate s+. ~ So we arrived on the 28th of\nDecember. On the 28th of December, suddenly broke the door of the house, and the\nArrow Cross appeared, and everybody down from the apartments. And and it was the\nvery similar procedure that happened in the other houses which were taken and executed.\nOkay\u201d? And it happened to be that my uncle was a lawyer, and as a lawyer, he had a big\nmouth, and the big mouth he was staying the responsible person for the whole bloody\nhouse. He was the he was the kind of supervisor of the house, if you want to. So this\nstory, by the way, is written down very well in one of Wallenberg's book. It's by name,\nand it's it's very well documented. So I am just now quoting, as a matter of fact, from\nthe book, telling of what happened. Basically what happened was there was a one\nworking telephone, and my dear uncle called the consulate, which was in a different part\nof the city. And for some unbelievable luck, Wallenberg just happened to be in the\nconsulate inthis in acertain location.
